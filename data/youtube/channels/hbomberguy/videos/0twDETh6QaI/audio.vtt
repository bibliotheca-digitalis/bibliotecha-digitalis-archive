00:00.000 --> 00:02.760
If you've consumed any media in the last 70 years,

00:02.760 --> 00:04.760
there's a good chance you've heard this voice.

00:04.760 --> 00:08.880
This sound, man being eaten by alligator,

00:08.880 --> 00:11.640
was recorded for distant drums in 1951

00:11.640 --> 00:14.560
for a scene where a guy randomly drowns all by himself.

00:14.560 --> 00:17.940
This recording then became part of the library

00:17.940 --> 00:20.600
of sound effects people at Super Warnio Brothers used.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.900
Another scream from that recording then appeared

00:22.900 --> 00:25.440
in 1953's The Charge at Feather River

00:25.440 --> 00:28.400
where a certain Private Wilhelm gets shot by an arrow.

00:29.260 --> 00:32.720
They also use it, like, two more times in the same movie.

00:32.720 --> 00:37.720
Sound designer Ben Burtt noticed this reuse

00:37.720 --> 00:40.020
and started reusing it himself in student films

00:40.020 --> 00:41.280
because he thought it was funny.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.480
As a silly little joke, he hid it in the background

00:43.480 --> 00:45.860
of a B-movie he was hired to work on.

00:45.860 --> 00:49.820
Oops, looks like culture's been changed forever.

00:49.820 --> 00:55.700
Burtt had accidentally started a career-long running joke.

00:56.060 --> 00:57.880
-'Help me!'-

00:57.880 --> 00:59.380
-'Help!'-

00:59.380 --> 01:01.380
-'Help!'-

01:01.380 --> 01:03.380
-'Help!'-

01:03.380 --> 01:05.380
-'Help!'-

01:05.380 --> 01:07.600
In his big cameo in Jedi, he does an impression

01:07.600 --> 01:09.260
of the scream when he gets killed

01:09.260 --> 01:11.320
by an OSHA-violating guardrail.

01:11.320 --> 01:12.820
-'Help!'-

01:12.820 --> 01:14.600
Then other people started using it too,

01:14.600 --> 01:15.940
and now it's everywhere.

01:15.940 --> 01:16.940
-'Help!'-

01:16.940 --> 01:18.940
-'Help!'-

01:18.940 --> 01:20.940
-'Help!'-

01:20.940 --> 01:22.940
-'Help!'-

01:22.940 --> 01:24.940
-'Help!'-

01:24.940 --> 01:26.940
-'Help!'-

01:26.940 --> 01:28.940
-'Help!'-

01:28.940 --> 01:30.940
-'Help!'-

01:30.940 --> 01:31.940
Getting in on someone else's in-joke

01:31.940 --> 01:33.440
kind of risks ruining it,

01:33.440 --> 01:34.940
but I wouldn't know anything about that.

01:34.940 --> 01:35.940
-'Help!'-

01:35.940 --> 01:37.940
And there's a bunch of other iconic screams like this.

01:37.940 --> 01:39.940
-'Help!'-

01:39.940 --> 01:41.940
-'Help!'-

01:41.940 --> 01:43.940
-'Help!'-

01:43.940 --> 01:45.940
-'Help!'-

01:45.940 --> 01:47.940
-'Help!'-

01:47.940 --> 01:49.940
-'Help!'-

01:49.940 --> 01:50.940
Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:50.940 --> 01:52.940
Like with Wilhelm, the source of these sounds

01:52.940 --> 01:54.440
are usually well-documented.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.940
That scream comes from a popular sound effects library,

01:56.940 --> 01:58.440
and while we're ruining things,

01:58.440 --> 01:59.940
those sheep-slash-goat-

01:59.940 --> 02:01.940
screaming-like-a-human videos

02:01.940 --> 02:03.440
you love so much?

02:03.440 --> 02:04.440
-'Help!'-

02:04.440 --> 02:05.440
Yeah, they're all fake.

02:05.440 --> 02:07.440
That's just a sound that comes free with Apple software.

02:07.440 --> 02:09.440
-'Help!'-

02:09.440 --> 02:11.440
You're welcome, but for over a decade,

02:11.440 --> 02:14.440
one sound's original source was unknown.

02:14.440 --> 02:15.440
This one.

02:15.440 --> 02:16.440
-'Help!'-

02:16.440 --> 02:18.440
This is all over Internet video nowadays,

02:18.440 --> 02:19.940
but where's it from?

02:19.940 --> 02:21.440
Most people under a certain age

02:21.440 --> 02:23.440
are yelling Roblox at the screen right now.

02:23.440 --> 02:26.440
Roblox is a free online game-slash-platform

02:26.440 --> 02:28.440
people can make additional content and games for,

02:28.440 --> 02:30.440
and they can even monetize what they make

02:30.440 --> 02:31.940
for, uh, uh, pittance.

02:31.940 --> 02:33.440
According to YouTube journalist's

02:33.440 --> 02:34.440
People Make Games,

02:34.440 --> 02:37.440
Roblox developers receive less than 25%

02:37.440 --> 02:40.440
of the money from sales of content they make.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.440
This has led to the Roblox Corporation

02:42.440 --> 02:46.440
attaining a net worth of roughly $7 quadspillion,

02:46.440 --> 02:48.940
and one of, if not the, most iconic things

02:48.940 --> 02:50.940
about this game is its death sound effect,

02:50.940 --> 02:52.940
also known as the Roblox oof.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.940
Videos of just this sound get millions

02:54.940 --> 02:56.440
upon millions of views.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.440
It has its own separate existence as a meme

02:58.440 --> 02:59.940
across thousands of videos,

02:59.940 --> 03:01.940
and one video claiming to be its origin

03:01.940 --> 03:04.440
has 117 million views,

03:04.440 --> 03:06.440
shockingly close to the lifetime views

03:06.440 --> 03:07.940
of my entire channel.

03:07.940 --> 03:10.440
This sound effect is a phenomenon,

03:10.440 --> 03:12.440
but it's not from Roblox,

03:12.440 --> 03:14.940
and this child is a liar.

03:15.440 --> 03:16.440
Mmm.

03:16.440 --> 03:18.940
Ah! Ah!

03:21.940 --> 03:22.940
Now, I—

03:22.940 --> 03:23.440
Ah!

03:23.440 --> 03:25.440
I haven't played Roblox.

03:25.440 --> 03:26.940
I play mature games for grownups,

03:26.940 --> 03:27.940
like Fortnite.

03:29.940 --> 03:30.940
Oh!

03:30.940 --> 03:32.440
When I was the age Roblox would have

03:32.440 --> 03:33.940
definitely controlled my life,

03:33.940 --> 03:35.440
it was instead being controlled

03:35.440 --> 03:36.940
by stop-motion animation

03:36.940 --> 03:38.440
and then later by Garry's Mod,

03:38.440 --> 03:40.940
a game which did not monetize its content

03:40.940 --> 03:42.940
in increasingly horrifying ways,

03:42.940 --> 03:45.440
transforming its community into a digital sweatshop,

03:45.440 --> 03:47.440
but I'm sure the new way is fine too,

03:47.440 --> 03:49.440
so no, I haven't played Roblox,

03:49.440 --> 03:50.940
but I have played Messiah.

03:50.940 --> 03:53.940
["Messiah"]

03:53.940 --> 03:56.940
♪♪

03:56.940 --> 03:58.440
Oh, for Christ's sake!

03:58.440 --> 03:59.440
Oh!

03:59.440 --> 04:01.440
Messiah was released in the year 2000

04:01.440 --> 04:03.440
and developed by Shiny Entertainment.

04:03.440 --> 04:04.940
They made Path of Neo,

04:04.940 --> 04:06.440
so they're insane and I love them.

04:06.440 --> 04:08.440
You play as a cute little cherub named Bob

04:08.440 --> 04:10.940
who gets blasted down to Earth to help out.

04:10.940 --> 04:12.940
This is the best opening cutscene ever.

04:12.940 --> 04:15.440
Bob has no combat abilities whatsoever.

04:15.440 --> 04:17.940
Instead, though, he can possess other people.

04:17.940 --> 04:19.940
I'm a cop.

04:19.940 --> 04:21.440
You know, in real life, a huge portion

04:21.440 --> 04:22.940
of the angels who come to Earth

04:22.940 --> 04:24.940
end up in the bodies of police officers.

04:24.940 --> 04:26.940
It's true. Google 40% cops.

04:26.940 --> 04:28.940
Bob can possess basically any living thing,

04:28.940 --> 04:30.440
including rats when the developers

04:30.440 --> 04:31.940
feel like making you save scum.

04:31.940 --> 04:33.940
The player is constantly switching bodies

04:33.940 --> 04:36.440
using their different abilities, credentials, and weapons.

04:36.440 --> 04:37.940
The pacing is breakneck

04:37.940 --> 04:39.940
because doing so doesn't slow you down.

04:39.940 --> 04:41.940
I played Messiah in the mid-2000s

04:41.940 --> 04:43.940
when I found it in a Christian charity shop.

04:43.940 --> 04:45.440
I assume they didn't see the words

04:45.440 --> 04:47.940
sex, religion, possession, death on the cover,

04:47.940 --> 04:49.940
and then I threw it away.

04:49.940 --> 04:52.440
I bought this copy on eBay to use as a prop.

04:52.440 --> 04:54.440
I have to get this out for the rest of the video now.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.940
Then a decade passes, and in a random YouTube video,

04:56.940 --> 04:58.440
I hear a familiar sound.

04:58.440 --> 05:00.940
Ooh! People tell me it's from Roblox,

05:00.940 --> 05:02.940
but I swear I've heard it somewhere else.

05:02.940 --> 05:04.940
Obviously, I immediately forgot about it

05:04.940 --> 05:06.940
and moved on with my life until 2019

05:06.940 --> 05:08.440
when someone else figured it out.

05:08.440 --> 05:10.440
User PlasmaNode on Reddit

05:10.440 --> 05:12.440
was watching the ending cinematic on YouTube

05:12.440 --> 05:15.440
for some reason and noticed a very familiar sound.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.440
Ah!

05:16.440 --> 05:17.440
Boo!

05:17.440 --> 05:18.440
Ah!

05:18.440 --> 05:19.940
He posted his discovery on Reddit

05:19.940 --> 05:21.440
along with a clip from the ending.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.440
Someone stole and reposted his clip on Twitter.

05:23.440 --> 05:26.440
A large Roblox YouTuber made a video about that tweet,

05:26.440 --> 05:28.440
and then journalists started picking up on it,

05:28.440 --> 05:30.440
although the articles do credit the wrong person

05:30.440 --> 05:32.440
with the discovery because their one source

05:32.440 --> 05:33.940
is a video that got it wrong.

05:33.940 --> 05:35.940
Why did the sound get so popular anyway?

05:35.940 --> 05:38.940
Well, if TV has taught me anything,

05:38.940 --> 05:41.440
children being injured is just universally funny.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.440
Let's not think about what that says about us.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.940
Here's an interesting fact,

05:44.940 --> 05:47.940
which I hope justifies me playing the entire game

05:47.940 --> 05:49.440
in preparation for this video.

05:49.440 --> 05:51.440
Everyone involved seems to think the sound effect

05:51.440 --> 05:53.440
is specifically in the ending,

05:53.440 --> 05:54.940
but it's actually all over the game.

05:54.940 --> 05:57.440
You can fly around and flap your little wings to float,

05:57.440 --> 05:59.940
and whenever you slam into a wall, Bob makes a noise,

05:59.940 --> 06:01.440
and that's one of the noises.

06:01.440 --> 06:03.940
It's also in the opening cutscene too.

06:04.440 --> 06:06.440
Whoa!

06:06.440 --> 06:08.940
It's kind of funny it was discovered in the ending,

06:08.940 --> 06:10.940
the last possible place you would hear it

06:10.940 --> 06:12.440
if you played the game.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.940
Interestingly enough, there was proof in Roblox

06:14.940 --> 06:16.940
the sound was from Messiah all along,

06:16.940 --> 06:18.940
and no one thought to check.

06:18.940 --> 06:20.940
You see, sound files have this thing in them

06:20.940 --> 06:22.440
called metadata.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.440
It's extra information that comes with a file.

06:24.440 --> 06:26.940
You know, album art, list of the artists

06:26.940 --> 06:28.440
and people who worked on it and so on.

06:28.440 --> 06:30.440
You know those pirated Weird Al Yankovic albums

06:30.440 --> 06:31.940
your friend gave you when you were 14?

06:31.940 --> 06:33.940
Uh, that's why the album art was in there.

06:33.940 --> 06:35.440
It was in the metadata.

06:35.440 --> 06:36.940
I think that anecdote might be a bit too specific.

06:36.940 --> 06:38.940
The oof sound in Roblox's game files,

06:38.940 --> 06:43.440
ur.wav, has metadata in it saying it was made in 1999

06:43.440 --> 06:45.440
while Messiah was being made

06:45.440 --> 06:47.940
with the engineer listed as Joey Kouros.

06:47.940 --> 06:50.440
Joey Kouros is an extremely prolific

06:50.440 --> 06:51.940
video game sound designer.

06:51.940 --> 06:53.940
He's worked on Tony Hawk's Pro Skater,

06:53.940 --> 06:55.940
Spider-Man, Gears of War,

06:55.940 --> 06:57.440
and even Fortnite.

06:57.440 --> 06:58.940
That clip I showed earlier,

06:58.940 --> 07:00.940
that wasn't just me showing off my sick skills.

07:00.940 --> 07:02.940
That was a clever setup for this bit.

07:02.940 --> 07:04.940
No, it wasn't actually. I wrote a Fortnite joke

07:04.940 --> 07:06.940
and then it turned out he'd worked on Fortnite, but still.

07:06.940 --> 07:10.940
And here's Joey on page XXXVI of Messiah's manual

07:10.940 --> 07:12.940
as one of the sound effects guys.

07:12.940 --> 07:14.440
See? Look? See?

07:14.440 --> 07:15.940
I don't have a camera person this time,

07:15.940 --> 07:18.940
so I'll have to cut to a close-up that I shot later.

07:18.940 --> 07:20.440
Uh, Rachel stopped responding

07:20.440 --> 07:21.940
when she found out what the video was about.

07:21.940 --> 07:22.940
So there we go.

07:22.940 --> 07:24.440
We know where the sound effect was from.

07:24.440 --> 07:26.440
We even have a good idea who might have made it.

07:26.440 --> 07:27.940
Mystery solved.

07:27.940 --> 07:29.940
We can all go home to our families.

07:29.940 --> 07:31.440
I'm just kidding. There's more.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.940
That's only the beginning of the story, you worm.

07:33.940 --> 07:36.940
I can't say that.

07:36.940 --> 07:39.940
We haven't even talked about who owns the sound effect yet.

07:39.940 --> 07:41.440
It doesn't belong to Joey.

07:41.440 --> 07:43.440
It belongs to the company he was working for

07:43.440 --> 07:46.440
when it was made, Tommy Tallarico Studios,

07:46.440 --> 07:48.440
along with its owner, Tommy T...

07:48.440 --> 07:49.940
I don't need to say his name.

07:49.940 --> 07:51.940
He named his studio after himself.

07:51.940 --> 07:52.940
Are you ready?

07:52.940 --> 07:55.940
Yeah!

07:55.940 --> 07:56.940
Ooh!

07:56.940 --> 08:00.440
Tommy Tallarico is a veritable video game industry icon

08:00.440 --> 08:03.440
according to the first line of his biography on his website.

08:03.440 --> 08:04.940
I wouldn't personally go that far,

08:04.940 --> 08:07.440
but he was a fairly well-known musician and composer

08:07.440 --> 08:09.440
for video games in the 90s and 2000s.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.440
His most notable soundtracks include

08:11.440 --> 08:13.940
Earthworm Jim, MDK, and Advent Rising.

08:13.940 --> 08:15.940
His company was involved with the sound effects

08:15.940 --> 08:17.940
on lots of other games from this period too.

08:17.940 --> 08:19.940
That's why if you're my age or older,

08:19.940 --> 08:22.940
this is burned into your brain.

08:22.940 --> 08:24.940
Tommy Tallarico Studios.

08:24.940 --> 08:27.940
He was also on TV on the show's electric playground

08:27.940 --> 08:28.940
and Judgment Day,

08:28.940 --> 08:30.940
some of the earliest shows about video games,

08:30.940 --> 08:33.440
reviewing new releases and interviewing developers.

08:33.440 --> 08:36.440
If you were around for a certain era of game history,

08:36.440 --> 08:37.940
you remember Tommy from TV

08:37.940 --> 08:39.940
or played something his company worked on.

08:39.940 --> 08:41.940
He also co-founded Video Games Live

08:41.940 --> 08:43.440
which produced symphony performances

08:43.440 --> 08:45.440
of popular video game soundtracks.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.940
VGL is universally recognized among gamers

08:47.940 --> 08:50.440
as a thing they think they remember hearing about

08:50.440 --> 08:51.440
that seems nice.

08:51.440 --> 08:52.940
Through royalties from his company's work

08:52.940 --> 08:53.940
over the years,

08:53.940 --> 08:55.440
Tommy's doing pretty well for himself

08:55.440 --> 08:56.940
and he's spent his money on living

08:56.940 --> 08:58.440
in a very interesting house.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.940
It has themed rooms, a Spider-Man room

09:00.940 --> 09:01.940
full of all the original comics.

09:01.940 --> 09:04.440
Probably have about $50,000

09:04.440 --> 09:05.440
in your hands right there.

09:05.440 --> 09:06.940
Giant statues of Lara Croft

09:06.940 --> 09:08.440
and the Fifth Element Lady,

09:08.440 --> 09:10.940
an ancient Egypt-themed dining room.

09:10.940 --> 09:11.940
The list goes on.

09:11.940 --> 09:14.440
The first thing I built in my house

09:14.440 --> 09:16.440
when I bought this was a seven-foot waterfall,

09:16.440 --> 09:19.440
but it kind of sucks because at night sometimes

09:19.440 --> 09:20.940
I have to go to the bathroom.

09:20.940 --> 09:22.440
Tommy is proud of his insane mansion.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.440
That's why I've got so much footage of it.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.440
He's given numerous tours of the place over the years

09:26.440 --> 09:28.940
and it was even on MTV's Cribs.

09:28.940 --> 09:30.940
He's so proud of that he re-uploaded it

09:30.940 --> 09:32.940
to his own YouTube channel years later.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.440
He's very happy about the fact

09:34.440 --> 09:36.940
he was specifically on MTV's Cribs.

09:36.940 --> 09:38.940
He says it a lot in interviews

09:38.940 --> 09:40.940
and that's what he calls the video

09:40.940 --> 09:42.940
he uploaded onto his own channel

09:42.940 --> 09:45.940
and there's no way he would tell an obvious lie like that.

09:45.940 --> 09:47.940
Would he?

09:47.940 --> 09:49.940
Foreshadowing is a literary device

09:49.940 --> 09:52.440
in which he also re-uploaded an old UK show

09:52.440 --> 09:54.940
where the presenter clearly hates his house.

09:54.940 --> 09:56.440
This is absolutely hideous.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.440
You've got to sort yourself out, Tommy.

09:58.440 --> 09:59.940
You've got too much money.

09:59.940 --> 10:01.940
This is silly.

10:01.940 --> 10:02.940
It's not right, Tommy.

10:02.940 --> 10:03.940
No, but it is.

10:03.940 --> 10:05.940
There's children starving.

10:05.940 --> 10:07.940
And if you're the sort of person who's impressed

10:07.940 --> 10:08.940
by Guinness World Records,

10:08.940 --> 10:10.440
Tommy has a huge stack of them

10:10.440 --> 10:11.940
leaning up against a cabinet

10:11.940 --> 10:15.440
in the corner of his awards slash Indiana Jones nook.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.440
The big one is person who has worked

10:17.440 --> 10:19.440
on the most video games in their lifetime.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.940
I actually have the Guinness World Record

10:21.940 --> 10:24.940
for the person who's worked on the most video games

10:24.940 --> 10:25.940
in their lifetime.

10:25.940 --> 10:27.940
He's such a big deal he was handpicked

10:27.940 --> 10:30.940
by Shigeru Miyamoto to work on Metroid Prime.

10:30.940 --> 10:33.440
Metroid Prime with Shigeru Miyamoto.

10:33.440 --> 10:36.440
I worked with him for, uh, many years.

10:36.440 --> 10:37.940
And he was also the first American

10:37.940 --> 10:40.440
to work on the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.940
I was the first American ever hired, uh,

10:42.940 --> 10:44.940
to work on the Sonic franchise.

10:44.940 --> 10:47.440
Can you believe that?

10:47.440 --> 10:49.940
Can you believe that?

10:49.940 --> 10:51.440
Do you really believe that?

10:51.440 --> 10:53.440
Tommy's been kind of resting on his laurels

10:53.440 --> 10:55.440
doing video games live for a while now.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.440
He hasn't done much new music for games

10:57.440 --> 10:58.940
since the late 2000s.

10:58.940 --> 11:00.940
One of the last things he did was donate music

11:00.940 --> 11:03.940
to Super Tofu Boy, a game made by PETA.

11:03.940 --> 11:05.940
It's a really bad Super Meat Boy clone

11:05.940 --> 11:08.440
interspersed with quite good music

11:08.440 --> 11:10.440
and interesting meat facts.

11:10.440 --> 11:12.440
Listen, PETA, I've eaten a lot of tofu,

11:12.440 --> 11:14.440
but meat doesn't scream either.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.940
If it did, people would probably stop eating it.

11:16.940 --> 11:18.940
Tommy is a vocal PETA supporter,

11:18.940 --> 11:20.940
doing an interview for them in the Egyptian wing

11:20.940 --> 11:22.940
of his house about cruelty to animals

11:22.940 --> 11:24.440
and put out a statement on Facebook

11:24.440 --> 11:26.940
responding to criticism of his involvement with Tofu Boy.

11:26.940 --> 11:28.940
It's the only press release I've ever read

11:28.940 --> 11:30.440
that has emoticons in it.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.440
We can't really talk about Tommy

11:33.440 --> 11:35.440
without talking about what he was doing

11:35.440 --> 11:37.440
while the OOF was being discovered.

11:37.440 --> 11:38.940
Tommy is most well-known nowadays

11:38.940 --> 11:41.940
for what has become known as the Amico disaster.

11:41.940 --> 11:44.440
In 2018, Tommy acquired the rights to Intellivision,

11:44.440 --> 11:46.440
a game company from the 70s and 80s,

11:46.440 --> 11:48.940
and announced he was making a brand new console,

11:48.940 --> 11:50.440
the Intellivision Amico.

11:50.440 --> 11:53.940
Amico aimed to be a truly family-friendly games console

11:53.940 --> 11:55.940
with low age ratings on its games

11:55.940 --> 11:58.440
and the bonus selling point of, uh,

11:58.440 --> 12:00.440
not having online play.

12:00.440 --> 12:03.440
Apparently to get people playing in the same room together?

12:03.440 --> 12:04.940
Together again. Aw.

12:04.940 --> 12:06.440
Some people would tell you online play

12:06.440 --> 12:08.440
is one of the best features of modern gaming

12:08.440 --> 12:10.440
and a nice option for people who can't easily

12:10.440 --> 12:11.940
be physically next to each other,

12:11.940 --> 12:14.440
and to that, Tommy's reply was no.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.940
When I was growing up in the 70s, 80s,

12:16.940 --> 12:18.940
and even when I was working in the game industries

12:18.940 --> 12:22.440
in the 90s, you know, we didn't have the Internet, right?

12:22.440 --> 12:24.940
With this pitch in hand, how did the Amico do?

12:24.940 --> 12:26.440
It didn't.

12:26.440 --> 12:28.940
It was delayed, supposedly due to the global pandemic,

12:28.940 --> 12:30.940
but then it was delayed many more times,

12:30.940 --> 12:34.440
and it still isn't out two years after the intended launch.

12:34.440 --> 12:36.940
It seems less like unfortunate supply chain issues

12:36.940 --> 12:39.440
and more like management underestimated

12:39.440 --> 12:42.440
how hard it is to make a new game console from scratch.

12:42.440 --> 12:44.440
As CEO, Tommy made the decision

12:44.440 --> 12:47.440
to open two company offices in Irvine, California,

12:47.440 --> 12:48.940
and Salt Lake City, Utah,

12:48.940 --> 12:51.440
two really expensive places to open offices

12:51.440 --> 12:53.440
in the middle of the pandemic.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.440
In his video tours, the large, expensive spaces

12:56.440 --> 12:58.440
are mostly empty and unused,

12:58.440 --> 13:00.440
with the money guy in the back looking like

13:00.440 --> 13:02.940
he's working overtime trying to keep this operation afloat

13:02.940 --> 13:04.440
without a finished product.

13:04.440 --> 13:06.440
This is where the magic happens.

13:06.440 --> 13:07.940
Tommy wants money.

13:07.940 --> 13:10.440
This is, this is, and this box is where it all happens.

13:10.440 --> 13:11.940
As the money started to run out,

13:11.940 --> 13:14.940
they turned to crowdfunding investment website Fig.

13:14.940 --> 13:17.440
Tommy produced a video in his Spider-Man room

13:17.440 --> 13:19.940
with other company leadership in his Egypt room

13:19.940 --> 13:21.940
and Tomb Raider-themed movie theater room

13:21.940 --> 13:24.440
claiming the console just needs a bit more money

13:24.440 --> 13:27.440
to get going and release is just around the corner.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.940
The rocket ship has been built.

13:29.940 --> 13:31.940
We are on the launch pad,

13:31.940 --> 13:35.440
and we just need the fuel to take off,

13:35.440 --> 13:37.440
so strap yourself in because it's gonna be

13:37.440 --> 13:38.940
one hell of a ride.

13:38.940 --> 13:40.940
They raised $7 million more

13:40.940 --> 13:42.440
and the Amico still didn't come out,

13:42.440 --> 13:43.940
so they tried again,

13:43.940 --> 13:46.940
turning to second crowdfunding investment website Republic.

13:46.940 --> 13:48.940
They even used the same pitch video.

13:48.940 --> 13:50.440
Come on, guys, the rocket ship just needs

13:50.440 --> 13:51.940
a couple more million dollars.

13:51.940 --> 13:53.440
Strap yourself in.

13:53.440 --> 13:56.440
They raised over $11.5 million more

13:56.440 --> 13:59.440
so they could continue to not release a console.

13:59.440 --> 14:00.940
They tried a third time on a weird,

14:00.940 --> 14:03.940
shady investor website that pretends to be a livestream

14:03.940 --> 14:05.440
but is clearly prerecorded.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.440
The rocket ship is built, folks.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.440
We are on the launch pad.

14:09.440 --> 14:11.440
We just need a little more fuel.

14:11.440 --> 14:12.940
And then they turned to yet another

14:12.940 --> 14:14.440
crowdfunding website for more

14:14.440 --> 14:16.940
and canceled it partway through when it became clear

14:16.940 --> 14:18.440
there's no one left to invest.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.440
When internal documents leaked

14:20.440 --> 14:22.440
revealing the console's internal hardware

14:22.440 --> 14:24.440
was cheap, old, and rubbish,

14:24.440 --> 14:26.440
Tommy threatened people who reported on it

14:26.440 --> 14:28.440
with legal action, and when another journalist

14:28.440 --> 14:30.440
asked what the reporters had done wrong

14:30.440 --> 14:32.440
reporting publicly available information,

14:32.440 --> 14:33.940
he deleted all the tweets.

14:33.940 --> 14:36.440
The Amico's difficult non-launch,

14:36.440 --> 14:37.940
fearful tossing of investor money

14:37.940 --> 14:39.440
into two large holes...

14:39.440 --> 14:42.940
There's not too many people here in the office yet.

14:42.940 --> 14:45.440
...and its CEO's increasingly aggressive behavior

14:45.440 --> 14:47.940
towards people trying to report what was happening

14:47.940 --> 14:50.940
netted the company and Tommy some criticisms.

14:50.940 --> 14:52.440
Tommy did the responsible thing

14:52.440 --> 14:54.440
and started messaging people to call them names.

14:54.440 --> 14:56.440
He defended the Amico on internet forums

14:56.440 --> 14:58.440
calling detractors morons, idiots,

14:58.440 --> 15:01.440
mentally unstable, narcissists, and cowards,

15:01.440 --> 15:03.440
comparing criticism of his business decisions

15:03.440 --> 15:05.440
to racism, eventually settling

15:05.440 --> 15:07.440
on calling his detractors gaming racists,

15:07.440 --> 15:09.440
the funniest term I've ever heard.

15:09.440 --> 15:12.440
But these elitists, they're racists.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.940
They're literally gaming racists.

15:14.940 --> 15:17.940
He did this while following a bunch of actual racists,

15:17.940 --> 15:20.440
white supremacists, and far-right personalities

15:20.440 --> 15:22.440
on Twitter. This caused people to check

15:22.440 --> 15:24.440
for his other hot takes and discover his opinion

15:24.440 --> 15:26.440
on people who kneel for the national anthem.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.440
Apparently racism is bad,

15:28.440 --> 15:30.440
but protesting it is for douchebags.

15:30.440 --> 15:33.940
Somebody just said I sound like a social justice warrior.

15:33.940 --> 15:36.440
Uh, you couldn't be farther from the truth,

15:36.440 --> 15:38.940
and I'm the most un-politically correct person

15:38.940 --> 15:39.940
on the planet.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.940
Don't call me an SJW.

15:41.940 --> 15:43.940
You have no idea how racist I am.

15:43.940 --> 15:44.940
People are saying I got triggered.

15:44.940 --> 15:47.440
No, I'm just having fun and being passionate.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.440
The folks in there that are, that are,

15:49.440 --> 15:51.440
that are peeing their pants right now.

15:51.440 --> 15:52.940
Things just got worse from there.

15:52.940 --> 15:54.440
It hit the point where Tommy,

15:54.440 --> 15:57.940
the CEO of a family-friendly games console company

15:57.940 --> 15:59.940
in desperate need of investment,

15:59.940 --> 16:01.940
would only give interviews with an ever-dwindling group

16:01.940 --> 16:04.940
of diehard fans who completely agreed with this behavior.

16:04.940 --> 16:06.940
The kind of normal person who wear a serial killer mask

16:06.940 --> 16:08.440
while they interview you.

16:08.440 --> 16:10.940
My wife told me to cancel my amigo,

16:10.940 --> 16:12.440
and I still did not.

16:12.440 --> 16:13.940
This is one of the last people

16:13.940 --> 16:15.940
Tommy was willing to speak to.

16:15.940 --> 16:18.940
And then if you want to hear me, um, uh,

16:18.940 --> 16:22.940
pwn some noobs and, um, and, and punch back

16:22.940 --> 16:26.940
at some haters, follow me on Twitter,

16:26.940 --> 16:29.940
TommyTellerico, and, uh, you know,

16:29.940 --> 16:32.940
I don't mind punching back to some of these losers.

16:32.940 --> 16:35.940
He has since stepped down as CEO

16:35.940 --> 16:37.940
with his replacement announcing the company

16:37.940 --> 16:39.940
is entering a quiet period,

16:39.940 --> 16:41.940
which is a hell of a subtweet if I've ever seen one.

16:41.940 --> 16:43.440
The amigo still isn't out,

16:43.440 --> 16:45.940
and a lot of people want their money back.

16:45.940 --> 16:49.940
In the middle of all this,

16:49.940 --> 16:51.440
right before the first big delay,

16:51.440 --> 16:52.940
before things got super bad,

16:52.940 --> 16:55.940
back when Tommy had a reputation to burn,

16:55.940 --> 16:57.940
the oof discovery was made.

16:57.940 --> 16:59.940
Due to his contract with Shiny Entertainment,

16:59.940 --> 17:02.940
TommyTellerico Studios owns all the sound effects

17:02.940 --> 17:04.940
he and his employees made for the game.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.440
Shiny could use them in Messiah,

17:06.440 --> 17:07.940
but they belong to Tommy,

17:07.940 --> 17:10.440
and he can use them again or sell them if he wishes.

17:10.440 --> 17:12.940
And when Tommy found out a sound effect he owned

17:12.940 --> 17:14.940
was being used in Roblox,

17:14.940 --> 17:17.440
oh, boy, did the butter begin to churn.

17:17.440 --> 17:18.940
Tommy stepped up to the plate

17:18.940 --> 17:20.440
and did a stream on YouTube called

17:20.440 --> 17:22.940
Talking About the Roblox Oof Sound and Controversy.

17:22.940 --> 17:24.440
It's hard going back to this stream

17:24.440 --> 17:26.440
because he spends a good chunk of it

17:26.440 --> 17:28.940
pitching a soon-to-be-released game console

17:28.940 --> 17:30.940
that still doesn't exist.

17:30.940 --> 17:34.940
We're actually coming out with a brand-new video game machine.

17:34.940 --> 17:37.440
It's called the Intellivision Amico.

17:37.440 --> 17:39.440
We actually don't allow online play.

17:39.440 --> 17:41.440
It's weirdly anxiety-inducing

17:41.440 --> 17:43.940
watching a man in January 2020,

17:43.940 --> 17:45.940
right before a global pandemic,

17:45.940 --> 17:47.940
pitching a console whose central feature

17:47.940 --> 17:49.940
is trapping people in a room together.

17:49.940 --> 17:51.940
Everybody can kind of come together

17:51.940 --> 17:55.440
and play in the same room together.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.940
But when he wasn't pitching

17:58.940 --> 18:01.940
his scam-adjacent business venture,

18:01.940 --> 18:06.940
Tommy was demanding Roblox give him $100 million.

18:06.940 --> 18:09.940
Tommy wants money.

18:11.940 --> 18:13.940
Okay, for legal reasons, I'd like to specify

18:13.940 --> 18:16.940
that was a joke. He didn't ask for that much.

18:16.940 --> 18:18.440
Probably.

18:18.440 --> 18:20.940
He didn't say how much he wanted.

18:20.940 --> 18:23.440
Almost like he was embarrassed to.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.440
Tommy made it clear he didn't want Roblox

18:25.440 --> 18:26.940
to remove the sound.

18:26.940 --> 18:29.940
He wanted them to keep using it but to pay him for it,

18:29.940 --> 18:32.440
and if they didn't, things were going to court.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.440
They may think that, you know,

18:34.440 --> 18:37.940
I'm trying to get the sound taken out of the game.

18:37.940 --> 18:39.440
I'm not.

18:39.440 --> 18:42.440
They may think that I'm currently suing Roblox.

18:42.440 --> 18:44.940
I'm not currently.

18:44.940 --> 18:46.440
But it's also not fair to me

18:46.440 --> 18:48.940
that I don't get compensated for this.

18:48.940 --> 18:52.440
This situation is, legally speaking, very funny.

18:52.440 --> 18:54.940
Allow me to pretend I understand it for a few minutes.

18:54.940 --> 18:57.440
A key point here is, at least as far as I can tell,

18:57.440 --> 18:58.940
so probably wrong,

18:58.940 --> 19:01.940
Tommy isn't owed any compensation.

19:01.940 --> 19:03.940
According to Roblox, the oeuvre came on a CD

19:03.940 --> 19:05.940
of sound effects the original creators purchased

19:05.940 --> 19:08.440
when they were making the game in the mid-2000s.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.440
If this is true, they used the sound

19:10.440 --> 19:12.440
with the reasonable belief they had the right

19:12.440 --> 19:13.940
to do so at the time.

19:13.940 --> 19:15.940
Whoever took the sound out of Messiah

19:15.940 --> 19:18.440
and sold it on a CD could be in trouble,

19:18.440 --> 19:21.440
but the two guys who started Roblox in 2006

19:21.440 --> 19:24.940
didn't do anything wrong apart from create Roblox.

19:24.940 --> 19:26.940
Okay, I've spoken to a couple of lawyers

19:26.940 --> 19:27.940
after filming this bit.

19:27.940 --> 19:29.440
Should have done beforehand, really,

19:29.440 --> 19:31.440
and they clarified something I think I should add here

19:31.440 --> 19:33.440
about them not doing anything wrong.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.940
They did still technically do copyright infringement.

19:35.940 --> 19:38.440
If you use a sound effect you bought from someone

19:38.440 --> 19:40.440
and it turns out they stole it and lied to you,

19:40.440 --> 19:42.440
you're still guilty of copyright infringement.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.440
However, if this actually went to court,

19:44.440 --> 19:47.440
there is something called the innocent infringer defense.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.940
If an infringer can demonstrate they had no reason

19:49.940 --> 19:52.440
to believe they had committed copyright infringement

19:52.440 --> 19:54.440
and it looks like Roblox might be able to do that,

19:54.440 --> 19:56.440
the court can reduce the statutory damages

19:56.440 --> 19:58.940
to as low as $200 per infringement.

19:58.940 --> 20:01.440
There are other types of damages like actual damages,

20:01.440 --> 20:02.940
the losses suffered by the owner

20:02.940 --> 20:04.440
as a result of the infringement,

20:04.440 --> 20:05.940
but that's something that could only be answered

20:05.940 --> 20:06.940
in a courtroom.

20:06.940 --> 20:07.940
As you're about to see, however,

20:07.940 --> 20:09.440
Roblox directly told Tommy

20:09.440 --> 20:11.440
they don't think they owe him anything,

20:11.440 --> 20:13.940
so it sounds like they think they have a good defense

20:13.940 --> 20:15.440
if things go to court.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.440
In these tweets a few days before the stream,

20:17.440 --> 20:19.940
Tommy seems a bit annoyed that no one owes him money,

20:19.940 --> 20:22.440
although in his version, Roblox feel like

20:22.440 --> 20:23.940
they don't owe him anything,

20:23.940 --> 20:27.440
which is a strange way of describing a large corporation.

20:27.440 --> 20:29.940
I think what Tommy means is Roblox's lawyers

20:29.940 --> 20:31.440
know what the law is,

20:31.440 --> 20:33.940
but he still would like to have some money.

20:33.940 --> 20:36.440
All Roblox are required to do in this situation

20:36.440 --> 20:37.940
is remove the sound,

20:37.940 --> 20:39.940
and Tommy could send a cease and desist

20:39.940 --> 20:42.440
and trigger that happening whenever he wanted.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.440
I could have sent a letter very easy.

20:44.440 --> 20:47.940
Cease and desist. Stop using the sound.

20:47.940 --> 20:50.940
It's mine. You don't have permission to use it.

20:50.940 --> 20:52.440
Take it out of your game.

20:52.440 --> 20:53.940
But Tommy isn't doing that

20:53.940 --> 20:56.440
because he doesn't want it taken out.

20:56.440 --> 20:57.940
Tommy wants money.

20:57.940 --> 20:59.440
If he can get them to keep it in

20:59.440 --> 21:01.940
and pay him a license fee to use it

21:01.940 --> 21:03.440
or just buy the sound off him outright,

21:03.440 --> 21:05.440
he could make a lot of money.

21:05.440 --> 21:08.440
I'd rather them just, uh, pay me

21:08.440 --> 21:10.440
and them own the sound forever

21:10.440 --> 21:11.940
so that it stays in the game.

21:11.940 --> 21:13.440
Tommy cannot stress enough

21:13.440 --> 21:15.940
how much he doesn't want Roblox to remove the sound

21:15.940 --> 21:18.440
because that's how he makes money from this.

21:18.440 --> 21:21.440
Uh, I never asked Roblox to remove the sound.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.440
I don't want it to be removed.

21:23.440 --> 21:26.940
I haven't told them to take the sound out of the game.

21:26.940 --> 21:29.440
I want to keep the sound in the game, so...

21:29.440 --> 21:31.440
And Roblox probably want to keep

21:31.440 --> 21:33.940
the immensely popular sound in their game.

21:33.940 --> 21:36.440
However, they are a business.

21:36.440 --> 21:38.440
Their ultimate goal is to keep

21:38.440 --> 21:40.440
as much of their money as possible.

21:40.440 --> 21:41.940
A majority of Roblox's income

21:41.940 --> 21:43.440
comes from underpaying the people

21:43.440 --> 21:45.440
who actually make the game's content.

21:45.440 --> 21:47.440
How much do you think they're willing to pay

21:47.440 --> 21:50.440
for .3 seconds of a child saying ow,

21:50.440 --> 21:52.440
especially when they could replace it for free?

21:52.440 --> 21:54.940
Uh, Roblox could remove the sound tomorrow

21:54.940 --> 21:56.440
if they wanted to.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.440
So when Tommy approached them asking for money,

21:58.440 --> 22:00.440
Roblox offered him less.

22:00.440 --> 22:01.940
We approached Roblox.

22:01.940 --> 22:03.940
We said, hey, there's a situation,

22:03.940 --> 22:06.940
and we're gonna ask for this much.

22:06.940 --> 22:09.940
Roblox said, eh,

22:09.940 --> 22:11.940
we think you should get this much.

22:11.940 --> 22:16.440
So, so, you know, this much is what we think.

22:16.440 --> 22:17.940
Just to put it in plain English,

22:17.940 --> 22:19.940
the purpose of this stream is for Tommy

22:19.940 --> 22:21.940
to complain that Roblox will not offer him

22:21.940 --> 22:24.940
enough money to buy a sound effect they don't need.

22:24.940 --> 22:29.940
I think they're, they're nuts and disrespectful to me.

22:29.940 --> 22:32.940
This is an all-time classic Tallarico moment right here.

22:32.940 --> 22:36.940
Complaining about respect while calling someone nuts

22:36.940 --> 22:39.440
and asking them for more money.

22:39.440 --> 22:40.940
It's just incredible.

22:40.940 --> 22:43.940
I'm hoping that we can come together,

22:43.940 --> 22:46.440
I don't know, maybe somewhere in the middle,

22:46.440 --> 22:48.440
uh, to make everyone happy.

22:48.440 --> 22:50.440
One question really starts to stand out

22:50.440 --> 22:52.440
in this 90-minute stream.

22:52.440 --> 22:53.940
How much money does he want?

22:53.940 --> 22:56.440
He's very careful to never say how much he thinks

22:56.440 --> 22:58.940
the sound effect is worth, how much he asked for,

22:58.940 --> 23:00.440
or how much they offered him.

23:00.440 --> 23:02.440
And I can't tell you, people are gonna say,

23:02.440 --> 23:03.440
well, how much did you ask for?

23:03.440 --> 23:05.440
Look, you have to understand

23:06.440 --> 23:09.440
that it is not professional of me

23:09.440 --> 23:13.440
to go around stating how much money I'm asking

23:13.440 --> 23:15.440
and how much they are offering.

23:15.440 --> 23:16.940
Just to be clear, unless there's some kind

23:16.940 --> 23:18.440
of non-disclosure agreement,

23:18.440 --> 23:20.440
which he probably would have said if there was,

23:20.440 --> 23:22.440
there isn't anything actually stopping Tommy

23:22.440 --> 23:24.940
from saying how much he wants for the sound effect.

23:24.940 --> 23:27.940
The Amico saga has proven irrefutably

23:27.940 --> 23:30.440
that Tommy does not care in the slightest

23:30.440 --> 23:31.440
about appearing professional.

23:31.440 --> 23:33.440
That excuse doesn't work.

23:33.440 --> 23:35.440
He's choosing not to say it

23:35.440 --> 23:37.440
and getting increasingly defensive

23:37.440 --> 23:40.940
as viewers keep asking and he runs out of explanations.

23:40.940 --> 23:42.940
To be honest, none of your damn business.

23:42.940 --> 23:43.940
No, no.

23:43.940 --> 23:46.440
How much did you say for them to pay for the oof sound?

23:46.440 --> 23:48.940
Okay, well, I've already gone over that,

23:48.940 --> 23:50.440
that I can't talk about that.

23:50.440 --> 23:52.440
To an outside observer and the chat

23:52.440 --> 23:53.940
whose questions he was dodging,

23:53.940 --> 23:55.940
it started to feel like Tommy just wanted

23:55.940 --> 23:58.440
a embarrassingly large amount of money

23:58.440 --> 24:00.440
for a single sound effect

24:00.440 --> 24:02.940
and knew that it would make him look

24:02.940 --> 24:04.440
really greedy if he said it.

24:04.440 --> 24:06.940
People are never gonna know, you know, what it is

24:06.940 --> 24:10.440
and there doesn't need to be that knowledge.

24:10.440 --> 24:12.440
He's in the fascinatingly awkward position

24:12.440 --> 24:15.440
of not being able to say how much he wants

24:15.440 --> 24:17.940
even though that's what the stream is about.

24:17.940 --> 24:20.440
It would be unprofessional to talk about that,

24:20.440 --> 24:23.940
um, but I think I did describe that it's,

24:23.940 --> 24:27.440
um, a lot more than what, you know,

24:27.440 --> 24:31.940
they were offering which was barely anything at all.

24:31.940 --> 24:34.940
I think it's worth asking how much barely anything is

24:34.940 --> 24:37.940
to a millionaire with a dedicated Spider-Man room

24:37.940 --> 24:40.440
and an indoor waterfall in his mansion.

24:40.440 --> 24:42.440
Everyone should have a seven-foot waterfall,

24:42.440 --> 24:43.940
I think, installed in your room,

24:43.940 --> 24:45.940
but the thing that's kind of bad about it

24:45.940 --> 24:47.440
is that at night,

24:47.440 --> 24:48.940
I always have to go to the bathroom.

24:48.940 --> 24:50.940
Wait a minute. Didn't he already make that joke?

24:50.940 --> 24:52.940
Later in the stream, he started taking questions

24:52.940 --> 24:54.940
and someone asked him to give the ratio

24:54.940 --> 24:56.440
how different the counteroffer was.

24:56.440 --> 25:00.440
Tommy, percentage-wise, how far is Roblox offer

25:00.440 --> 25:01.940
compared to what you ask for?

25:01.940 --> 25:05.940
At least 100 times...

25:05.940 --> 25:06.940
less.

25:06.940 --> 25:11.440
So that, you know, if they offered me $1,

25:11.440 --> 25:12.940
I'm asking for $100.

25:12.940 --> 25:17.440
So, you know, if they offered me $1,000,

25:17.440 --> 25:20.440
that means I'm asking for $100,000, right?

25:20.440 --> 25:23.440
So that's how far it is off.

25:23.940 --> 25:25.440
I find it very curious that he will say

25:25.440 --> 25:26.940
how much he asked for,

25:26.940 --> 25:28.940
but only in the form of a riddle.

25:28.940 --> 25:31.940
Even more curiously, he uses very small amounts

25:31.940 --> 25:33.440
of money as examples.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.440
He chooses not to say, for example,

25:35.440 --> 25:36.940
if they offered me $50,000,

25:36.940 --> 25:39.440
that means I asked for $5,000,000,

25:39.440 --> 25:41.440
or if they offered me $100,000, okay,

25:41.440 --> 25:42.440
I can see why he didn't.

25:42.440 --> 25:44.440
And I hope they come to their senses.

25:44.440 --> 25:46.440
And I know they're probably watching.

25:46.440 --> 25:47.440
I don't know. Maybe they're not.

25:47.440 --> 25:48.940
It's Saturday morning.

25:48.940 --> 25:51.440
So that was the situation in January 2020.

25:51.440 --> 25:53.440
Roblox were offering to buy the sound.

25:53.440 --> 25:56.440
Tommy wanted 100 times more money

25:56.440 --> 25:57.440
than they were offering,

25:57.440 --> 25:58.940
and if things didn't go his way,

25:58.940 --> 26:00.940
he was threatening to take things to court.

26:00.940 --> 26:05.440
You know, I have attorneys that I have teams of attorneys.

26:05.440 --> 26:08.940
I usually have about 20 different lawyers.

26:08.940 --> 26:11.440
It's just a difference of opinion

26:11.440 --> 26:15.940
on whether or not I helped to bring millions of people

26:15.940 --> 26:19.440
to their game or not and what that is worth.

26:19.440 --> 26:20.940
That last thing is, I think,

26:20.940 --> 26:22.440
why Tommy thinks he can ask

26:22.440 --> 26:24.440
for whatever massive amount of money he won't say.

26:24.440 --> 26:26.940
In his mind, this one sound effect

26:26.940 --> 26:30.440
single-handedly launched the Roblox franchise.

26:30.440 --> 26:33.940
But the idea is that this is a sound

26:33.940 --> 26:37.440
that helped to create the franchise, right?

26:37.440 --> 26:40.940
Some may say even that the reason Roblox

26:40.940 --> 26:43.940
is as popular as it is now

26:43.940 --> 26:47.940
may be because of the fact

26:47.940 --> 26:50.440
that so many people share this oof sound.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.940
So, some may say,

26:52.940 --> 26:55.440
Tommy, you don't need to launder your arguments like that.

26:55.440 --> 26:58.440
You are the one saying that right now.

26:58.440 --> 27:00.440
This is something that helped

27:00.440 --> 27:02.940
to create the franchise itself.

27:02.940 --> 27:07.440
It's made the game Roblox go supersonic.

27:07.440 --> 27:08.440
It was part of the reason.

27:08.440 --> 27:11.440
How many millions of people found out

27:11.440 --> 27:14.440
about the game Roblox because of a meme

27:14.440 --> 27:17.440
that used because of the sound, right?

27:17.440 --> 27:20.440
We think we're asking for something extremely fair

27:20.440 --> 27:23.940
considering what it has done for the franchise.

27:23.940 --> 27:26.440
These claims are hilarious, exaggerated,

27:26.440 --> 27:28.440
but most of all, wrong.

27:28.440 --> 27:29.940
Take the sound effects from Minecraft

27:29.940 --> 27:32.940
that are really popular and people use a lot in videos too.

27:32.940 --> 27:34.940
They have a huge presence online as well,

27:34.940 --> 27:37.440
but they didn't make Minecraft popular.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.440
They're popular because they're in a game

27:39.440 --> 27:41.440
millions of children have played.

27:41.440 --> 27:43.940
The Roblox oof took off in mid-2017

27:43.940 --> 27:46.940
when Roblox was already a pretty mainstream thing.

27:46.940 --> 27:49.440
The cause and effect is completely backwards here.

27:49.440 --> 27:51.440
While it might not be entirely impossible

27:51.440 --> 27:54.440
for a single sound effect to make a game very popular,

27:54.440 --> 27:56.440
I would like to remind everyone

27:56.440 --> 27:58.440
that this sound effect was already in a game,

27:58.440 --> 28:00.440
and that game was such a massive critical

28:00.440 --> 28:02.940
and commercial failure that no one noticed

28:02.940 --> 28:06.440
the sound effect had been stolen for 20 fucking years.

28:06.440 --> 28:07.440
Come on, bud.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.440
Roblox didn't become a multi-billion dollar company

28:09.440 --> 28:10.940
because of a sound effect.

28:10.940 --> 28:12.440
They got there by being evil.

28:12.440 --> 28:15.440
Speaking of evil, Roblox eventually worked with Tommy

28:15.440 --> 28:17.940
to turn all of this into a whole new way

28:17.940 --> 28:20.440
of monetizing their empire of nightmares.

28:20.440 --> 28:22.440
Instead of paying Tommy for the sound,

28:22.440 --> 28:24.440
they're making the players pay for it.

28:24.440 --> 28:26.440
In November 2020, Roblox announced

28:26.440 --> 28:28.440
the oof sound was going to be removed,

28:28.440 --> 28:30.440
but they were updating their developer marketplace

28:30.440 --> 28:32.940
so players could purchase sounds to use in their games,

28:32.940 --> 28:34.940
and once this update was complete,

28:34.940 --> 28:37.440
the oof sound could be purchased and used through there.

28:37.440 --> 28:39.440
I assume Tommy would get a cut from this.

28:39.440 --> 28:41.940
Simultaneously, Tommy announced he had produced

28:41.940 --> 28:43.440
a sound effects pack for creators

28:43.440 --> 28:45.940
to use in their Roblox games, including the oof.

28:45.940 --> 28:50.940
I have done a brand new sound design library

28:50.940 --> 28:52.940
just for Roblox.

28:52.940 --> 28:55.440
Creators could buy a range of sound effects packs

28:55.440 --> 28:57.940
costing from $10 to $250

28:57.940 --> 28:59.940
and use these in the games they make.

28:59.940 --> 29:02.940
Roblox and Tommy agreed to keep the sound in the game

29:02.940 --> 29:04.940
as is for a while so the sound marketplace

29:04.940 --> 29:06.440
had time to get up and running

29:06.440 --> 29:08.940
and no one had to go oof-less in the meantime.

29:08.940 --> 29:10.440
But this functionality still hasn't been added

29:10.440 --> 29:11.940
a year and a half later.

29:11.940 --> 29:13.440
Eventually, in July this year,

29:13.440 --> 29:16.440
Roblox, citing a licensing issue,

29:16.440 --> 29:18.940
removed the sound and replaced it with this one.

29:18.940 --> 29:21.940
Gah! Which is rubbish, frankly,

29:21.940 --> 29:24.440
but it might be bad on purpose to incentivize paying

29:24.440 --> 29:26.940
to replace it once they get the marketplace up.

29:26.940 --> 29:29.940
So clever move, I guess.

29:29.940 --> 29:31.940
You bags of scum!

29:31.940 --> 29:34.440
Tommy also got to make some official oof merch,

29:34.440 --> 29:35.940
so that was nice for him, I suppose.

29:35.940 --> 29:39.440
I've created an oof T-shirt.

29:39.440 --> 29:41.940
It doesn't look like he got the massive payday he wanted,

29:41.940 --> 29:43.940
especially since the audio marketplace

29:43.940 --> 29:45.440
hasn't manifested yet,

29:45.440 --> 29:46.940
but at least he got something out of it.

29:46.940 --> 29:48.440
So there we go.

29:48.440 --> 29:50.440
Wasn't that an interesting story?

29:50.440 --> 29:52.440
That's the end of the video essay.

29:52.440 --> 29:53.940
Don't look at the run time.

29:53.940 --> 29:55.440
Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it.

29:55.440 --> 29:58.440
If you came here to find the origins of a sound effect,

29:58.440 --> 29:59.440
you can go.

29:59.440 --> 30:00.940
Subscribe on the way out if you'd like,

30:00.940 --> 30:02.440
but take care.

30:02.440 --> 30:04.440
Go play Roblox or something.

30:04.440 --> 30:06.940
And, uh, Tommy, I know you're watching.

30:06.940 --> 30:08.440
I've seen you arguing with people in the comments

30:08.440 --> 30:10.440
of videos with 100 views.

30:10.440 --> 30:11.440
You can go as well.

30:11.440 --> 30:14.440
Go do whatever it is you do in your fun house.

30:14.440 --> 30:16.440
I'm just chilling out.

30:16.440 --> 30:17.440
See ya.

30:17.440 --> 30:23.440
♪

30:23.440 --> 30:25.440
Okay, I think they're gone.

30:25.440 --> 30:29.440
♪

30:29.440 --> 30:31.940
This video is being filmed at an undisclosed location

30:31.940 --> 30:33.440
to avoid being traced.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.940
Also, Mom went on holiday and she locked the garage

30:35.940 --> 30:36.940
so I can't get to my set.

30:36.940 --> 30:39.440
And no, I have no idea why the back wall

30:39.440 --> 30:41.440
of this room is also green.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.940
The last guy who lived here had terrible taste.

30:43.940 --> 30:47.440
Anyway, I think he's gone.

30:47.440 --> 30:50.440
Okay, we need to talk about Tommy.

30:50.440 --> 30:52.940
This is where the video was supposed to finish.

30:52.940 --> 30:55.440
So I was writing up the script and doing a bit more research,

30:55.440 --> 30:58.940
and then I re-watched Tommy's E3 2021 pitch

30:58.940 --> 31:01.440
for the Amico, and I realized something.

31:01.440 --> 31:04.440
He takes credit for creating the oomph

31:04.440 --> 31:06.940
in a very particular way.

31:06.940 --> 31:10.940
I'm even the guy who did the oomph sound for Roblox.

31:10.940 --> 31:13.940
He made the sound for Roblox?

31:13.940 --> 31:16.440
I thought I misheard him or maybe he misspoke,

31:16.440 --> 31:17.940
but no, that's how he says it.

31:17.940 --> 31:20.440
The thing that you might know me the most from

31:20.440 --> 31:23.440
is the guy who created

31:23.440 --> 31:26.940
the beloved oomph sound for Roblox.

31:26.940 --> 31:27.940
That's right.

31:27.940 --> 31:29.440
The sound wasn't made for Roblox.

31:29.440 --> 31:31.940
It was made for another game and reused by mistake.

31:31.940 --> 31:33.940
That's what this whole thing was about, Tommy.

31:33.940 --> 31:35.440
He said that one in the commercial

31:35.440 --> 31:37.440
for his sound design kits he's selling

31:37.440 --> 31:38.940
to put it back in the game.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.440
Why is he saying it like that?

31:40.440 --> 31:43.940
Well, obviously the idea he made it for Roblox,

31:43.940 --> 31:45.940
this massive, important corporation,

31:45.940 --> 31:48.940
is slightly more prestigious than the truth, isn't it?

31:48.940 --> 31:50.940
So he's slightly altering the story

31:50.940 --> 31:52.440
to give himself a bit more credit,

31:52.440 --> 31:54.440
and that's fine. Like, whatever. Who cares?

31:54.440 --> 31:55.940
But then I thought, you know,

31:55.940 --> 31:58.440
for a sound with another guy's name on it,

31:58.440 --> 32:01.940
he seems pretty happy to say he personally made it

32:01.940 --> 32:03.440
for Roblox.

32:03.440 --> 32:04.940
From an outsider's perspective,

32:04.940 --> 32:07.440
it looks a bit like Tommy is taking credit

32:07.440 --> 32:09.940
for something someone who worked for him did

32:09.940 --> 32:11.440
decades later.

32:11.440 --> 32:13.940
And yeah, sure, my script was almost done,

32:13.940 --> 32:16.940
but I couldn't let that possibility sit unexplored.

32:16.940 --> 32:20.940
So I tried to figure out who actually made the sound,

32:20.940 --> 32:22.940
and what I discovered was...

32:22.940 --> 32:24.440
interesting.

32:24.440 --> 32:25.940
And then a bunch more other shit happened,

32:25.940 --> 32:27.940
and now the video is this long.

32:27.940 --> 32:29.440
I'm so sorry.

32:29.440 --> 32:33.940
♪

32:33.940 --> 32:35.940
Yes, Joey's name is on the file,

32:35.940 --> 32:38.940
but that doesn't necessarily mean he created it.

32:38.940 --> 32:40.940
If he did the final exporting of the sounds

32:40.940 --> 32:42.940
Tallarico Studios made for Messiah,

32:42.940 --> 32:45.440
his audio program would put his name on them

32:45.440 --> 32:47.940
regardless of who recorded, edited, or mastered them.

32:47.940 --> 32:51.940
Instead, let's look at how Tommy talks about who made it.

32:51.940 --> 32:54.440
Let's rewind the clock a little.

32:54.440 --> 32:57.440
Back in 2019, Tommy quote-tweeted that one video

32:57.440 --> 32:59.940
that was a repost of the thing PlasmaNode put on Reddit.

32:59.940 --> 33:02.440
He indicates that his company created

33:02.440 --> 33:04.440
and owns the sounds used for Messiah

33:04.440 --> 33:06.940
and that the sound effects was created

33:06.940 --> 33:09.440
by my lead sound designer Joey Kouros.

33:09.440 --> 33:12.940
Notice that he specifically doesn't say that he made it.

33:12.940 --> 33:14.940
He says his company created and owns it

33:14.940 --> 33:16.940
and then specifically credits Joey,

33:16.940 --> 33:19.940
implying little to no direct personal involvement.

33:19.940 --> 33:23.440
I believe this version of Tommy's story is true.

33:23.440 --> 33:25.440
However, soon after writing this,

33:25.940 --> 33:28.440
to put it bluntly, it looks like Tommy realized

33:28.440 --> 33:29.940
how popular the sound was.

33:29.940 --> 33:31.940
He's said in many places, including the livestream,

33:31.940 --> 33:34.440
that he didn't really know that much about Roblox

33:34.440 --> 33:36.440
until he found out one of his sounds was in it.

33:36.440 --> 33:39.440
So on a timeline, it looks like he wrote that tweet

33:39.440 --> 33:42.440
and then started looking at the sound's presence online.

33:42.440 --> 33:44.940
In his next tweet, he says he's surprised

33:44.940 --> 33:48.440
to discover the sound has tens of millions of views online

33:48.440 --> 33:52.440
and then all of a sudden it's a sound we created

33:52.440 --> 33:54.440
and then, and he adds this in parenthesis

33:54.440 --> 33:56.440
like he's trying to sneak it into the story

33:56.440 --> 33:57.440
at the last minute,

33:57.440 --> 33:59.940
and I myself recorded.

33:59.940 --> 34:01.440
This is a bit of a change, isn't it?

34:01.440 --> 34:03.440
It's also just a weird way of talking

34:03.440 --> 34:04.940
about something you created.

34:04.940 --> 34:07.440
Like, if you found out something you had made,

34:07.440 --> 34:10.440
you, was in a huge game, you would go,

34:10.440 --> 34:11.440
hey, I made that.

34:11.440 --> 34:12.940
You wouldn't go, as you can see,

34:12.940 --> 34:15.440
my company created and owns that.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.940
It was made by someone who worked for me decades ago.

34:17.940 --> 34:19.440
Oh, wait, the sound's really popular.

34:19.440 --> 34:22.440
I mean, we made it and I myself recorded it.

34:22.440 --> 34:23.440
And to his credit,

34:23.440 --> 34:25.440
I think Tommy noticed how this sounds too

34:25.440 --> 34:28.440
because 30 minutes later, he tried again.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.440
He started a second thread where this time

34:30.440 --> 34:34.440
it's a sound he created, Joey edited, and he owns.

34:34.440 --> 34:37.440
Note that he specifically used the word created again.

34:37.440 --> 34:39.440
So he got his story straight in the end at least.

34:39.440 --> 34:40.440
Good for him.

34:40.440 --> 34:42.440
But that does mean this first tweet

34:42.440 --> 34:44.440
is a bit embarrassing, isn't it?

34:44.440 --> 34:46.440
Now, you tell me,

34:46.440 --> 34:49.440
what one thing would make Tommy look more like

34:49.440 --> 34:53.440
he was trying to rewrite the history after the fact here?

34:53.440 --> 34:55.440
Deleting the tweet, right?

34:55.440 --> 34:56.440
From my perspective,

34:56.440 --> 34:58.440
that would be a very stupid thing to do.

34:58.440 --> 35:00.440
But I must be missing something because he did delete it.

35:00.440 --> 35:01.440
It's gone.

35:01.440 --> 35:04.440
I am not accusing famous industry veteran

35:04.440 --> 35:07.440
Tommy Tallarico of lying about who made a sound here.

35:07.440 --> 35:10.440
I don't know for sure who did what on this sound.

35:10.440 --> 35:13.440
But Tommy should.

35:13.440 --> 35:15.440
And if he's telling the truth,

35:15.440 --> 35:17.440
why did the truth change

35:17.440 --> 35:20.440
when he was surprised by how popular the sound was?

35:20.440 --> 35:22.440
In a very short span of time,

35:22.440 --> 35:24.440
Tommy's version of history went from

35:24.440 --> 35:27.440
Joey created it to we created it

35:27.440 --> 35:29.440
to I created it,

35:29.440 --> 35:31.440
and then later an attempt to delete the fact

35:31.440 --> 35:33.440
he said Joey created it.

35:33.440 --> 35:34.440
I know how it sounds.

35:34.440 --> 35:36.440
It would be weird to assume someone just wants to brag

35:36.440 --> 35:39.440
about making this one sound effect this badly.

35:39.440 --> 35:41.440
But he does brag about it.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.440
He put it in his Twitter handle.

35:43.440 --> 35:45.440
It's part of his pitch for the Amico.

35:45.440 --> 35:47.440
It seems very important to Tommy

35:47.440 --> 35:49.440
that he doesn't just own the sound,

35:49.440 --> 35:51.440
that he personally created it.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.440
To most people younger than me,

35:53.440 --> 35:55.440
that sound effect could be the most well-known thing

35:55.440 --> 35:58.440
on his resume, which is a bit depressing, really.

35:58.440 --> 36:00.440
And when he tries to describe the process

36:00.440 --> 36:03.440
of creating the sound, things get even weirder.

36:03.440 --> 36:05.440
In the OOF livestream,

36:05.440 --> 36:07.440
Tommy's happy to say he made the sound,

36:07.440 --> 36:10.440
but then he tries to go into detail about how it was made.

36:10.440 --> 36:12.440
I thought what first I would do

36:12.440 --> 36:17.440
is talk about how the OOF sound was created.

36:17.440 --> 36:19.440
When he talks about the work

36:19.440 --> 36:20.440
that went into making the sound,

36:20.440 --> 36:22.440
he doesn't say he did anything.

36:22.440 --> 36:24.440
He says we.

36:24.440 --> 36:27.440
Then what we did is we went through,

36:27.440 --> 36:28.440
you know, all the different lines.

36:28.440 --> 36:32.440
We did a whole bunch of other stuff to it as well.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.440
So after we pitch shifted it down and then...

36:34.440 --> 36:37.440
Sometimes he accidentally says I and then corrects himself.

36:37.440 --> 36:41.440
I wanted to let folks know how I created the sound,

36:41.440 --> 36:42.440
how we created the sound,

36:42.440 --> 36:46.440
myself and my sound designer Joey Kuras.

36:46.440 --> 36:47.440
It just keeps going like this.

36:47.440 --> 36:50.440
We start to tweak the sound, each individual sound.

36:50.440 --> 36:53.440
So again, in OOF, we might have spent, you know,

36:53.440 --> 36:56.440
a half hour trying to figure out exactly

36:56.440 --> 36:58.440
which way we should have pitched it down

36:58.440 --> 37:01.440
and what thing we would have taken and this and that.

37:02.440 --> 37:03.440
OOF!

37:03.440 --> 37:07.440
This is a strange way to describe something you did.

37:07.440 --> 37:10.440
Far from being a sound he created and Joey merely edited,

37:10.440 --> 37:12.440
whenever he has to describe any specifics,

37:12.440 --> 37:15.440
all of a sudden it was done by committee.

37:15.440 --> 37:17.440
Tommy isn't lying about who did what here.

37:17.440 --> 37:18.440
Quite the opposite, really.

37:18.440 --> 37:20.440
He's specifically avoiding lying

37:20.440 --> 37:22.440
by being as vague as possible about something

37:22.440 --> 37:24.440
it would be easy to talk about

37:24.440 --> 37:26.440
if he actually made the sound himself.

37:26.440 --> 37:30.440
So I took this little girl's, uh,

37:30.440 --> 37:32.440
we took the clip, right,

37:32.440 --> 37:36.440
and then what we did is we edited it

37:36.440 --> 37:40.440
and we kept the length of the sound.

37:40.440 --> 37:44.440
He struggles to come up with anything he actually did.

37:44.440 --> 37:47.440
Like, his knowledge helped?

37:47.440 --> 37:51.440
And, um, we'll say, uh...

37:52.440 --> 37:53.440
I want to say this right.

37:53.440 --> 37:59.440
I mean, it took a lot of my knowledge of audio

37:59.440 --> 38:03.440
to create this sound and make it sound unique.

38:03.440 --> 38:05.440
Now that people know about me,

38:05.440 --> 38:08.440
they know about how I created the Roblox sound.

38:08.440 --> 38:11.440
After seeing a guy specifically avoid saying I

38:11.440 --> 38:13.440
and say we dozens of times

38:13.440 --> 38:15.440
and then finish the story by saying,

38:15.440 --> 38:17.440
so that's how I made the sound,

38:17.440 --> 38:19.440
it just comes off really disingenuous.

38:19.440 --> 38:22.440
One quick indicator of what he could mean by we is

38:22.440 --> 38:25.440
at one point he uses it to describe the act

38:25.440 --> 38:27.440
of exporting the sound out of the program.

38:27.440 --> 38:30.440
You know, compressing it and making it all,

38:30.440 --> 38:32.440
EQing it and doing all these crazy things to it.

38:32.440 --> 38:35.440
Uh, before we ended up saving it out, so...

38:35.440 --> 38:38.440
When he says we here, he just means Joey.

38:38.440 --> 38:41.440
It only takes one person to hit save on a file,

38:41.440 --> 38:45.440
and that's the one thing we know for sure Joey did.

38:45.440 --> 38:46.440
Like with the money situation,

38:46.440 --> 38:49.440
it's hard not to read into why Tommy is talking strangely.

38:49.440 --> 38:52.440
It starts to sound like Joey did most of the work,

38:52.440 --> 38:54.440
but then that would mean someone else

38:54.440 --> 38:56.440
deserves the credit for creating the sound,

38:56.440 --> 39:00.440
so all of a sudden this .3 second sound effect

39:00.440 --> 39:01.440
becomes a team effort.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.440
That's Tommy's version of how the sound was made.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.440
He says we, but sometimes when he says we,

39:06.440 --> 39:09.440
he just means Joey, so what's Joey's version?

39:09.440 --> 39:12.440
Joey's been pretty quiet about all this,

39:12.440 --> 39:13.440
and good for him.

39:13.440 --> 39:15.440
His career's still going strong,

39:15.440 --> 39:16.440
unlike some people's,

39:16.440 --> 39:18.440
and I'm sure he has better things to do

39:18.440 --> 39:20.440
than litigate who made an ancient sound effect,

39:20.440 --> 39:22.440
unlike me who apparently has plenty of time for that shit.

39:22.440 --> 39:24.440
However, Kuras does have a website

39:24.440 --> 39:26.440
where he maintains credits for every game

39:26.440 --> 39:28.440
he's worked on since 1993,

39:28.440 --> 39:30.440
and he's still updating it today.

39:30.440 --> 39:32.440
Next to Messiah, Joey puts,

39:32.440 --> 39:34.440
design of all sound effects.

39:34.440 --> 39:37.440
After witnessing someone claim Joey did it,

39:37.440 --> 39:39.440
change their mind, delete the story,

39:39.440 --> 39:41.440
and then talk in very vague terms

39:41.440 --> 39:42.440
about who did what,

39:42.440 --> 39:44.440
seeing someone just say,

39:44.440 --> 39:45.440
I designed all the sound effects

39:45.440 --> 39:47.440
is like a breath of fresh air.

39:47.440 --> 39:49.440
This is another reason why I find Tommy's first version

39:49.440 --> 39:51.440
of the story more believable.

39:51.440 --> 39:53.440
Not only is it untainted by his later discovery

39:53.440 --> 39:54.440
how popular the sound was,

39:54.440 --> 39:56.440
it's also what the other person

39:56.440 --> 39:57.440
who worked on the game said,

39:57.440 --> 39:59.440
but this really makes it look like

39:59.440 --> 40:01.440
Tommy's stealing credit from someone else

40:01.440 --> 40:02.440
who worked for him now.

40:02.440 --> 40:03.440
It was just a hunch before,

40:03.440 --> 40:05.440
but now, I dunno.

40:05.440 --> 40:07.440
And here's when the fun, easy video

40:07.440 --> 40:10.440
about the Roblox oof I was trying to make ended

40:10.440 --> 40:12.440
and the horror of my new life began

40:12.440 --> 40:14.440
because while I was on Joey's page,

40:14.440 --> 40:15.440
I noticed something else.

40:15.440 --> 40:17.440
Design of all sound effects

40:17.440 --> 40:19.440
for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.

40:19.440 --> 40:21.440
This was very confusing to read

40:21.440 --> 40:23.440
because Tommy spent the last several decades

40:23.440 --> 40:25.440
saying he worked on Pro Skater.

40:25.440 --> 40:26.440
Tony Hawk Pro Skater.

40:26.440 --> 40:28.440
Tony Hawk Pro Skater.

40:28.440 --> 40:29.440
Tony Hawk Pro Skater.

40:29.440 --> 40:30.440
Uh, I was on the original

40:30.440 --> 40:33.440
Tony Hawk Pro Skater, uh, team.

40:33.440 --> 40:35.440
I was on the original Tony Hawk Pro Skater team.

40:35.440 --> 40:37.440
I'm not saying Tommy didn't work on it.

40:37.440 --> 40:40.440
It's just some places seem to disagree with him.

40:40.440 --> 40:43.440
Places like the credits of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.

40:43.440 --> 40:45.440
According to them,

40:45.440 --> 40:47.440
someone else did the in-game sound effects.

40:47.440 --> 40:49.440
I'll give you three guesses.

40:49.440 --> 40:50.440
It was, it was Joey. It was Joey.

40:50.440 --> 40:52.440
Although the company he was at is credited as well.

40:52.440 --> 40:54.440
It's like they're saying sound effects

40:54.440 --> 40:56.440
done by this guy from this company.

40:56.440 --> 40:59.440
But Tommy's acting like he personally did it again.

40:59.440 --> 41:01.440
I'm starting to feel a bit bad for Joey.

41:01.440 --> 41:02.440
Just to kind of add to the mystery,

41:02.440 --> 41:04.440
he talks about how small

41:04.440 --> 41:05.440
the development team was at the time.

41:05.440 --> 41:08.440
To kind of add to the exclusivity of it, I guess.

41:08.440 --> 41:11.440
You know, being a part of the original,

41:11.440 --> 41:13.440
uh, Tony Hawk Pro Skater team,

41:13.440 --> 41:16.440
you know, there's only about maybe 10 or 12 of us.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.440
This means very few people exist

41:18.440 --> 41:20.440
who could possibly contradict him.

41:20.440 --> 41:21.440
How convenient.

41:21.440 --> 41:23.440
It does make it even weirder though

41:23.440 --> 41:25.440
for such a small team to leave his name

41:25.440 --> 41:27.440
out of the credits.

41:27.440 --> 41:29.440
I guess Tommy could say his name is in there

41:29.440 --> 41:30.440
but only because his company is named

41:30.440 --> 41:32.440
Tommy Tallarico Studios.

41:32.440 --> 41:35.440
So who is responsible for the sounds in Pro Skater?

41:35.440 --> 41:37.440
The guy credited for it or his boss

41:37.440 --> 41:39.440
who says he did it now?

41:39.440 --> 41:41.440
In an older interview slash house tour,

41:41.440 --> 41:43.440
Tommy got a bit more specific.

41:43.440 --> 41:44.440
He said he'd buy skateboards.

41:44.440 --> 41:45.440
Oh, sorry.

41:45.440 --> 41:47.440
I mean we'd buy skateboards.

41:47.440 --> 41:48.440
We'd buy skateboards.

41:48.440 --> 41:50.440
And then Tommy would help

41:50.440 --> 41:52.440
this mysterious other person record the sounds.

41:52.440 --> 41:54.440
He says one of the pain sound effects,

41:54.440 --> 41:56.440
ironically also a kind of oof,

41:56.440 --> 41:57.440
is his actual voice.

41:57.440 --> 41:59.440
The actual sound in Tony Hawk

41:59.440 --> 42:02.440
that you hear when the guy falls off the skateboard

42:02.440 --> 42:03.440
and cracks his head open.

42:03.440 --> 42:04.440
Uh, pfft.

42:04.440 --> 42:05.440
Ugh.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.440
That's me falling off, cracking my head.

42:07.440 --> 42:10.440
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

42:10.440 --> 42:12.440
So Tommy might have helped with some of the sounds

42:12.440 --> 42:14.440
or at least at some point Joey recorded him

42:14.440 --> 42:16.440
falling off a skateboard.

42:16.440 --> 42:17.440
Strangely though, while he says he was

42:17.440 --> 42:19.440
on the Pro Skater team nowadays,

42:19.440 --> 42:21.440
at the time things were very different.

42:21.440 --> 42:23.440
You see, as I mentioned earlier,

42:23.440 --> 42:25.440
Tommy was on a TV show about games

42:25.440 --> 42:27.440
while Pro Skater was being made.

42:27.440 --> 42:30.440
The thing about journalism is it's usually frowned upon

42:30.440 --> 42:32.440
to cover or review a product you helped create

42:32.440 --> 42:34.440
without disclosing you worked on it

42:34.440 --> 42:37.440
and to his credit, Tommy's very good at this.

42:37.440 --> 42:39.440
When he and co-host Victor cover games

42:39.440 --> 42:41.440
he was involved with, they make sure to say it.

42:41.440 --> 42:42.440
Take Advent Rising,

42:42.440 --> 42:44.440
a game he composed a ton of music for.

42:44.440 --> 42:45.440
Advent Rising.

42:45.440 --> 42:47.440
I'm not gonna comment on any of the music

42:47.440 --> 42:49.440
in the game because I am completely biased.

42:50.440 --> 42:52.440
This is, and I mean this unironically,

42:52.440 --> 42:54.440
ethical gaming journalism.

42:54.440 --> 42:56.440
Also, you might have noticed,

42:56.440 --> 42:59.440
but Tommy kind of likes to brag about games he's worked on.

42:59.440 --> 43:01.440
One time they reviewed an Aladdin game

43:01.440 --> 43:03.440
and they brought up that Tommy worked on

43:03.440 --> 43:06.440
a different Aladdin games music eight years before.

43:06.440 --> 43:09.440
It was a great throwback to the 16-bit platformer days

43:09.440 --> 43:11.440
and I know you worked on the original Aladdin game

43:11.440 --> 43:13.440
so you must have felt like you were coming home.

43:13.440 --> 43:14.440
Deja vu!

43:14.440 --> 43:15.440
Yeah.

43:15.440 --> 43:17.440
Tommy not only understands disclosure,

43:17.440 --> 43:18.440
he loves doing it.

43:18.440 --> 43:20.440
If Tommy worked on a game

43:20.440 --> 43:22.440
or a game similar to the one being reviewed,

43:22.440 --> 43:24.440
you hear about it on this show.

43:24.440 --> 43:26.440
So what does it mean when Tommy doesn't say

43:26.440 --> 43:28.440
he worked on a game?

43:28.440 --> 43:30.440
While Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was being made,

43:30.440 --> 43:32.440
it was featured on the show.

43:32.440 --> 43:34.440
Tommy interviewed one of the developers.

43:34.440 --> 43:36.440
Later, when it came out, Tommy and Victor reviewed it

43:36.440 --> 43:39.440
and both gave it a 9.5 out of 10.

43:39.440 --> 43:41.440
If Tommy worked on this game's sound effects,

43:41.440 --> 43:43.440
he would have said so, wouldn't he?

43:43.440 --> 43:44.440
Well, he doesn't.

43:44.440 --> 43:46.440
At no point whatsoever in the coverage

43:46.440 --> 43:49.440
does Tommy disclose he worked on the game.

43:49.440 --> 43:51.440
Tommy behaves like a TV guy

43:51.440 --> 43:53.440
interviewing a game developer,

43:53.440 --> 43:55.440
which would be a bit weird if he was also

43:55.440 --> 43:56.440
on that development team, right?

43:56.440 --> 43:58.440
I can only think of a few reasons

43:58.440 --> 44:00.440
why Tommy wouldn't mention he worked on the game

44:00.440 --> 44:02.440
when he goes out of his way to do so normally.

44:02.440 --> 44:05.440
One is he randomly decided not to take credit

44:05.440 --> 44:07.440
for something which seems out of character

44:07.440 --> 44:09.440
and pretty dishonest considering how hard

44:09.440 --> 44:10.440
he promoted the game

44:10.440 --> 44:12.440
and he seems to know better than that.

44:12.440 --> 44:13.440
The alternative is,

44:13.440 --> 44:15.440
while he had helped Joey out a little,

44:15.440 --> 44:16.440
Tommy, at the time,

44:16.440 --> 44:18.440
didn't consider whatever input he gave

44:18.440 --> 44:20.440
big enough to justify telling people

44:20.440 --> 44:21.440
he was involved,

44:21.440 --> 44:23.440
which is fascinating to me.

44:23.440 --> 44:25.440
There is potentially a past version of Tommy

44:25.440 --> 44:27.440
who, if he honestly thought about it,

44:27.440 --> 44:30.440
would choose not to say he worked on Pro Skater,

44:30.440 --> 44:31.440
which is cool of him.

44:31.440 --> 44:33.440
However, then Pro Skater went on

44:33.440 --> 44:35.440
to be a really famous franchise

44:35.440 --> 44:37.440
and it became very cool to say you worked on it.

44:37.440 --> 44:41.440
I was on the original Tony Hawk Pro Skater team.

44:41.440 --> 44:42.440
And over the years,

44:42.440 --> 44:43.440
Tommy's story has grown a bit

44:44.440 --> 44:46.440
from helping with some of the sounds

44:46.440 --> 44:48.440
to, uh, doing all of them.

44:48.440 --> 44:51.440
I was on the original Tony Hawk Pro Skater team

44:51.440 --> 44:53.440
so I did all those, uh, sounds.

44:53.440 --> 44:55.440
I was audio director on that.

44:55.440 --> 44:56.440
Uh...

44:56.440 --> 44:58.440
Wait, now he's saying he was the audio director?

44:58.440 --> 45:00.440
He's not even in the credit!

45:00.440 --> 45:02.440
Let's quickly look at who did what

45:02.440 --> 45:04.440
on games Tallarico Studios worked on.

45:04.440 --> 45:05.440
On the vast majority,

45:05.440 --> 45:07.440
Tommy is often credited for music

45:07.440 --> 45:09.440
but he doesn't do sound effects much.

45:09.440 --> 45:12.440
Sound effects, or sound design as it was later called,

45:12.440 --> 45:14.440
is usually done by Joey.

45:14.440 --> 45:16.440
A game Tallarico Studios worked on

45:16.440 --> 45:18.440
almost always has music by Tommy,

45:18.440 --> 45:20.440
sound effects by Joey in the credits.

45:20.440 --> 45:22.440
Basically, when Tommy and Joey work on games together,

45:22.440 --> 45:24.440
it's pretty clear who did what.

45:24.440 --> 45:26.440
In fact, in the early 2000s,

45:26.440 --> 45:28.440
Tallarico Studios put out a sound effects library

45:28.440 --> 45:30.440
you could buy and use in your own projects

45:30.440 --> 45:33.440
with over 19,500 sound effects in it.

45:33.440 --> 45:35.440
Tommy's the executive producer

45:35.440 --> 45:38.440
so I'm sure he was involved in some capacity

45:38.440 --> 45:40.440
but three other recorders and editors are credited

45:40.440 --> 45:42.440
along with the sound designer.

45:42.440 --> 45:43.440
I wonder who it could be.

45:43.440 --> 45:45.440
It's Joey. It's always Joey.

45:45.440 --> 45:47.440
Joey credits himself as the lead sound designer

45:47.440 --> 45:49.440
at Tallarico Studios for 13 years.

45:49.440 --> 45:51.440
The thing he did was sound effects.

45:51.440 --> 45:54.440
Even on electric playground, Tommy's show,

45:54.440 --> 45:56.440
Joey is credited for additional sound effects

45:56.440 --> 45:58.440
so maybe Tommy didn't say he did the sound effects

45:58.440 --> 46:01.440
on Pro Skater because he knew Joey would see it.

46:01.440 --> 46:03.440
Given Tommy's tendency to take games

46:03.440 --> 46:05.440
his sound effects guy is credited for

46:05.440 --> 46:07.440
and say he did all the sounds,

46:07.440 --> 46:08.440
what does that sort of thing mean

46:08.440 --> 46:11.440
for his later claims about Messiah and Making the OOF?

46:11.440 --> 46:13.440
Well, wouldn't it be funny

46:13.440 --> 46:16.440
if Tommy also reviewed Messiah on TV

46:16.440 --> 46:18.440
and when he did, he again did not mention

46:18.440 --> 46:20.440
he worked on the game?

46:20.440 --> 46:23.440
Wouldn't that be very, very funny?

46:23.440 --> 46:25.440
Yeah, it is funny. That is what happened.

46:25.440 --> 46:27.440
Even funnier, on that same episode,

46:27.440 --> 46:30.440
they also reviewed the Dreamcast version of Pro Skater

46:30.440 --> 46:33.440
giving Tommy yet another opportunity

46:33.440 --> 46:35.440
to say he worked on it, which he didn't.

46:35.440 --> 46:37.440
There's starting to be a precedent

46:37.440 --> 46:40.440
for Joey doing things, being the one credited for it,

46:40.440 --> 46:43.440
Tommy reviewing it and not mentioning he worked on it,

46:43.440 --> 46:45.440
and then years later deciding he did.

46:45.440 --> 46:47.440
Coming back to how he talks on the stream,

46:47.440 --> 46:50.440
we could mean we both worked on this sound,

46:50.440 --> 46:53.440
but to be cynical, it can also mean

46:53.440 --> 46:56.440
Joey did it while working for me.

46:56.440 --> 46:58.440
Messiah is one of the two or so games

46:58.440 --> 47:00.440
I could find that Tallarico Studios made

47:00.440 --> 47:03.440
where they are both credited for the sound effects at once

47:03.440 --> 47:05.440
so potentially Tommy might have been more involved

47:05.440 --> 47:07.440
with the sound effects on this than normal.

47:07.440 --> 47:10.440
So our candidates are a guy who mostly did music

47:10.440 --> 47:13.440
and not sound effects, reviewed the game on television

47:13.440 --> 47:15.440
and chose not to say he worked on it,

47:15.440 --> 47:18.440
and when he later decided he did and he made this sound,

47:18.440 --> 47:21.440
carefully avoided taking credit for anything specific.

47:21.440 --> 47:23.440
Um...or the guy credited for sound effects

47:23.440 --> 47:26.440
on almost every other game who says he did it,

47:26.440 --> 47:28.440
who Tommy said did it before he changed his mind

47:28.440 --> 47:31.440
the first time, and whose name is on the file.

47:32.440 --> 47:36.440
In conclusion, who knows?

47:36.440 --> 47:38.440
Could have been either of them.

47:38.440 --> 47:39.440
Maybe it was both.

47:39.440 --> 47:41.440
Art is really a collaborative process.

47:41.440 --> 47:43.440
Okay, that was written as a joke

47:43.440 --> 47:45.440
about how heavily the deck is stacked here,

47:45.440 --> 47:46.440
but let's be serious.

47:46.440 --> 47:49.440
I haven't found any definitive proof here.

47:49.440 --> 47:52.440
I think it's interesting just how much Joey is credited

47:52.440 --> 47:54.440
for sound effects everywhere else,

47:54.440 --> 47:56.440
and I think it's weird that Tommy didn't really have

47:56.440 --> 47:59.440
any specifics to say about what he did on the sound,

47:59.440 --> 48:01.440
and I think if he did work on the game that closely,

48:01.440 --> 48:03.440
he should have said so when he reviewed

48:03.440 --> 48:04.440
the game on television,

48:04.440 --> 48:06.440
but none of that is specific proof

48:06.440 --> 48:09.440
of who recorded or mastered a specific sound effect.

48:09.440 --> 48:11.440
However, given all of this additional context

48:11.440 --> 48:14.440
and information, I can say at least for myself

48:14.440 --> 48:16.440
that I have some trouble believing Tommy

48:16.440 --> 48:18.440
when he says he made the sound,

48:18.440 --> 48:21.440
but when you decide something a well-known industry figure

48:21.440 --> 48:23.440
like him has said is suspect,

48:23.440 --> 48:27.440
you start to ask, well, what else has he said?

48:28.440 --> 48:29.440
This guy's been around for decades,

48:29.440 --> 48:31.440
and he's said a lot of things.

48:31.440 --> 48:33.440
I started investigating some of his other claims.

48:33.440 --> 48:35.440
I did it mostly to prove to myself

48:35.440 --> 48:37.440
I was just being silly so I could believe him

48:37.440 --> 48:39.440
when he said that he made the sound.

48:39.440 --> 48:41.440
I wanted to be able to put this to bed

48:41.440 --> 48:42.440
and move on with my life.

48:42.440 --> 48:45.440
I just couldn't accept that the first American

48:45.440 --> 48:48.440
to ever work on Sonic would lie like that.

48:48.440 --> 48:50.440
Hey, wait a second!

48:50.440 --> 48:54.440
♪♪

48:54.440 --> 48:56.440
Yes, Tommy has repeatedly said

48:56.440 --> 48:59.440
he's the first American to ever work on Sonic.

48:59.440 --> 49:02.440
In fact, I was the very first American

49:02.440 --> 49:06.440
to ever be hired by the Sonic team back in the day.

49:06.440 --> 49:07.440
Are you serious?

49:07.440 --> 49:08.440
Very first American.

49:08.440 --> 49:11.440
Yeah, very first American to be hired.

49:11.440 --> 49:16.440
One of the first Americans to ever be hired

49:16.440 --> 49:19.440
by Sega of Japan for the Sonic team.

49:19.440 --> 49:22.440
I was the first American to ever be hired

49:22.440 --> 49:25.440
to work on the Sonic the Hedgehog series.

49:25.440 --> 49:27.440
But if you don't take Tommy's word for it

49:27.440 --> 49:28.440
and do your own research,

49:28.440 --> 49:30.440
by which I mean basically Google Sonic for two seconds,

49:30.440 --> 49:32.440
you start to see red flags.

49:32.440 --> 49:35.440
Sonic was being developed in America as early as 1992

49:35.440 --> 49:38.440
when Sonic 2 was being made in California.

49:38.440 --> 49:40.440
Americans are all over Sonic's game development

49:40.440 --> 49:41.440
since almost the beginning.

49:41.440 --> 49:43.440
Which game did Tommy work on anyway?

49:43.440 --> 49:46.440
Sonic, uh, some of the, uh,

49:46.440 --> 49:48.440
or one of the Sonic games, Black Knight.

49:48.440 --> 49:50.440
That might have been in the 2000s.

49:50.440 --> 49:52.440
So Tommy was about 20 years late

49:52.440 --> 49:54.440
to the party of Americans working on Sonic.

49:54.440 --> 49:56.440
Okay, let's be charitable.

49:56.440 --> 49:59.440
Maybe he means first American to do music for the series?

49:59.440 --> 50:00.440
But if he thinks that,

50:00.440 --> 50:02.440
Tommy's been crushing too many 40s.

50:02.440 --> 50:03.440
That was terrible.

50:03.440 --> 50:04.440
I promise to live and learn from this.

50:04.440 --> 50:05.440
Oh, fu-

50:05.440 --> 50:08.440
But this first American stuff gets even deeper.

50:08.440 --> 50:10.440
There are layers to this shit.

50:10.440 --> 50:12.440
One particular American musician,

50:12.440 --> 50:14.440
Michael Jackson, was rumored for decades

50:14.440 --> 50:16.440
to have worked on Sonic 3.

50:16.440 --> 50:18.440
This was seemingly confirmed

50:18.440 --> 50:20.440
by Yuji Naka earlier this year, actually.

50:20.440 --> 50:22.440
This would make Jackson the first American

50:22.440 --> 50:24.440
to do a Sonic soundtrack.

50:24.440 --> 50:27.440
Maybe there are some Americans who worked on one earlier?

50:27.440 --> 50:28.440
I'm not sure.

50:28.440 --> 50:29.440
I'm not deep into Sonic lore.

50:29.440 --> 50:31.440
I'm no Heriton Splimby.

50:31.440 --> 50:33.440
Now, you could say, well, sure.

50:33.440 --> 50:34.440
Maybe that means Tommy is wrong

50:34.440 --> 50:36.440
about being the first American.

50:36.440 --> 50:38.440
But there's no way he could have known that.

50:38.440 --> 50:39.440
We only found out for sure recently.

50:39.440 --> 50:44.440
And yeah, to be fair, that would be true.

50:44.440 --> 50:46.440
Were it not for the fact Tommy has also been bragging

50:46.440 --> 50:49.440
about knowing back in the 90s that Jackson worked on Sonic.

50:49.440 --> 50:51.440
So I was really close with the, uh,

50:51.440 --> 50:54.440
the Sega folks back in the early 90s.

50:54.440 --> 50:56.440
I don't know if it was ever confirmed or not,

50:56.440 --> 50:57.440
but, uh, but I can tell you

50:57.440 --> 51:00.440
that he did do the music for Sonic 3.

51:00.440 --> 51:02.440
This was at a con in 2014

51:02.440 --> 51:05.440
before he started saying he was the first American.

51:05.440 --> 51:08.440
So either he knew he was lying when he started saying that

51:08.440 --> 51:10.440
or he made this shit up too.

51:10.440 --> 51:12.440
Which one is the lie?

51:12.440 --> 51:13.440
At this point, why not both?

51:13.440 --> 51:15.440
I don't trust this story about knowing

51:15.440 --> 51:17.440
about Jackson either, frankly.

51:17.440 --> 51:20.440
I think he just made up a story to seem involved

51:20.440 --> 51:22.440
with another important piece of history.

51:22.440 --> 51:24.440
That seems to be his M.O. at this point.

51:24.440 --> 51:26.440
This is just one example of what we could

51:26.440 --> 51:28.440
charitably call exaggeration,

51:28.440 --> 51:30.440
but realistically we call lies.

51:30.440 --> 51:32.440
The more I tried to check things Tommy said

51:32.440 --> 51:34.440
to prove to myself that any of it was true,

51:34.440 --> 51:36.440
the more it all came apart.

51:36.440 --> 51:38.440
Okay, so what about the Metroid Prime thing?

51:38.440 --> 51:41.440
He said in a bunch of places, including the OOF stream,

51:41.440 --> 51:43.440
that he worked on Metroid Prime.

51:43.440 --> 51:46.440
Uh, Metroid Prime with Shigeru Miyamoto,

51:46.440 --> 51:49.440
uh, worked on that for, uh, for a couple of years.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.440
And I worked with him on Metroid Prime,

51:51.440 --> 51:54.440
the first one, and we worked together for about,

51:54.440 --> 51:56.440
gosh, I wanna say four or five years.

51:56.440 --> 51:58.440
Metroid Prime, I worked with that

51:58.440 --> 52:00.440
with Shigeru Miyamoto for five years.

52:00.440 --> 52:02.440
I worked with Shigeru Miyamoto,

52:02.440 --> 52:04.440
the creator of Mario and Zelda,

52:04.440 --> 52:08.440
worked with him for five years on, uh, Metroid Prime.

52:08.440 --> 52:10.440
He doesn't just say he worked on it, actually.

52:10.440 --> 52:13.440
He says Shigeru Miyamoto was a personal huge fan of his work

52:13.440 --> 52:15.440
and always wanted to work on a game with him.

52:15.440 --> 52:17.440
We always talked about working together.

52:17.440 --> 52:20.440
Like, oh, man, I really love all your Mario stuff,

52:20.440 --> 52:23.440
and he'd say, oh, man, I love all your stuff that you do.

52:23.440 --> 52:26.440
Like, oh, we gotta work together sometime, you know?

52:26.440 --> 52:28.440
I don't know if that part of the story is true,

52:28.440 --> 52:31.440
but Tallarico Studios was contracted to work on Prime.

52:31.440 --> 52:33.440
Not music, by the way. Prime already had a composer.

52:33.440 --> 52:35.440
They just did sound effects.

52:35.440 --> 52:37.440
That might turn out to be important later.

52:37.440 --> 52:39.440
But early in development, Retro cancelled

52:39.440 --> 52:41.440
all their other projects to focus on Prime

52:41.440 --> 52:43.440
and suddenly didn't need outside help to get the audio done

52:43.440 --> 52:45.440
and his contract wasn't renewed.

52:45.440 --> 52:47.440
Tommy will confirm this part of the story himself.

52:47.440 --> 52:49.440
My contract was coming to an end

52:49.440 --> 52:53.440
was around the same time that Retro's projects

52:53.440 --> 52:55.440
were all getting cancelled except for Metroid,

52:55.440 --> 52:58.440
and they had an internal audio department.

52:58.440 --> 53:00.440
So he did work on it, briefly,

53:00.440 --> 53:02.440
but again with the exaggeration.

53:02.440 --> 53:04.440
For him to be dropped so easily implies Miyamoto

53:04.440 --> 53:07.440
wasn't as invested in working with Tommy as he says.

53:07.440 --> 53:09.440
Tommy doesn't just say he worked

53:09.440 --> 53:11.440
on Prime's sound effects for a bit

53:11.440 --> 53:13.440
and Miyamoto was a huge fan though.

53:13.440 --> 53:15.440
His story gets way more exotic.

53:15.440 --> 53:17.440
He tells people Miyamoto didn't give him

53:17.440 --> 53:19.440
any direction or visuals or animations

53:19.440 --> 53:21.440
to make sound effects to.

53:21.440 --> 53:23.440
He told him to just make what he thought was cool

53:23.440 --> 53:25.440
and the development team designed the weapons

53:25.440 --> 53:27.440
and animations around his sounds.

53:27.440 --> 53:31.440
Give us a bunch of epic weapon sounds

53:31.440 --> 53:33.440
and then what we're gonna do

53:33.440 --> 53:35.440
is I'm gonna give those to my artists

53:35.440 --> 53:39.440
and then they are gonna be inspired

53:39.440 --> 53:42.440
by the sounds that you make

53:42.440 --> 53:45.440
and we're gonna inspire the art and the thing.

53:45.440 --> 53:47.440
Wow, so cool.

53:47.440 --> 53:49.440
This is an unprecedented amount of control

53:49.440 --> 53:51.440
for an external audio contractor

53:51.440 --> 53:53.440
to have over a project.

53:53.440 --> 53:55.440
Plus it just doesn't mix very well with the fact

53:55.440 --> 53:57.440
he left really early in development.

53:57.440 --> 53:59.440
Did Miyamoto change his mind?

53:59.440 --> 54:01.440
Why didn't he make Retro keep him on board

54:01.440 --> 54:03.440
if he had such an important job?

54:03.440 --> 54:05.440
It also doesn't mix with other stories

54:05.440 --> 54:07.440
from Retro Studios' actual audio department.

54:07.440 --> 54:09.440
He did an interview for ShineSparkers

54:09.440 --> 54:11.440
where he told this story about Miyamoto

54:11.440 --> 54:13.440
letting him design the weapon sounds first.

54:13.440 --> 54:15.440
However, ShineSparkers then went on

54:15.440 --> 54:17.440
to interview Clark Wen, Prime's audio lead,

54:17.440 --> 54:19.440
who came on board after the other games

54:19.440 --> 54:21.440
were canceled and Tommy was gone.

54:21.440 --> 54:23.440
Wen is well-respected in the game audio industry.

54:23.440 --> 54:25.440
He's worked on a bunch of stuff,

54:25.440 --> 54:27.440
including Tony Hawk games, interestingly enough.

54:27.440 --> 54:29.440
According to him, they did sound effects

54:29.440 --> 54:31.440
the normal way, basing their work off the art

54:31.440 --> 54:33.440
and animations. There's something amazing

54:33.440 --> 54:35.440
about reading an interview with Tommy

54:35.440 --> 54:37.440
where he's blessed to the project

54:37.440 --> 54:39.440
with a radical new technique where the sound designer

54:39.440 --> 54:41.440
had massive creative control over the game

54:41.440 --> 54:43.440
and then going to the interview with Wen

54:43.440 --> 54:45.440
where they say, we interviewed Tommy

54:45.440 --> 54:47.440
and he said you did this and he goes,

54:47.440 --> 54:49.440
that sounds cool but no.

54:49.440 --> 54:51.440
Wen says one or two weapon sound effects

54:51.440 --> 54:53.440
were done when he got there and he left them

54:53.440 --> 54:55.440
mostly untouched, so a few of the sounds

54:55.440 --> 54:57.440
in the game are done by Tallarico Studios

54:57.440 --> 54:59.440
and they might have been done the way Tommy said

54:59.440 --> 55:01.440
but his overall involvement with the game

55:01.440 --> 55:03.440
was very small. How small?

55:03.440 --> 55:05.440
He left so early in development

55:05.440 --> 55:07.440
they forgot he had worked on it

55:07.440 --> 55:09.440
by the time the game was done and forgot

55:09.440 --> 55:11.440
to put his name in the credits.

55:11.440 --> 55:13.440
A bunch of other audio contractors made it in though.

55:13.440 --> 55:15.440
They must have kept contracting people

55:15.440 --> 55:17.440
after he left and not got him back.

55:17.440 --> 55:19.440
Weird. I wonder why. After seeing Tommy

55:19.440 --> 55:21.440
repeatedly take credit for the work

55:21.440 --> 55:23.440
of people under him, it's kind of cathartic

55:23.440 --> 55:25.440
seeing a bunch of other people get credited

55:25.440 --> 55:27.440
and for him to be forgotten.

55:27.440 --> 55:29.440
However, he's not the only one.

55:29.440 --> 55:31.440
Someone's missing from Tommy's version

55:31.440 --> 55:33.440
of the story again. Can you guess?

55:33.440 --> 55:35.440
In a now-deleted page on his website

55:35.440 --> 55:37.440
accessible via the Internet Archive,

55:37.440 --> 55:39.440
Tommy wrote about leaving early in development

55:39.440 --> 55:41.440
although he still claims he did a lot

55:41.440 --> 55:43.440
of the main sound design somehow.

55:43.440 --> 55:45.440
Funnily enough, he doesn't say

55:45.440 --> 55:47.440
I too much. He says we.

55:47.440 --> 55:49.440
I wonder who the other per-

55:49.440 --> 55:51.440
It's Joey! It's always Joey!

55:51.440 --> 55:53.440
He shared a recent email from Retro's

55:53.440 --> 55:55.440
new audio manager to prove he worked

55:55.440 --> 55:57.440
on it and he compliments the work

55:57.440 --> 55:59.440
Tallarico Studios did but he says

55:59.440 --> 56:01.440
it like this.

56:01.440 --> 56:03.440
My hat is off to you, Tommy and Joey!

56:03.440 --> 56:05.440
It's always Joey!

56:05.440 --> 56:07.440
What makes the story even funnier is how,

56:07.440 --> 56:09.440
you know, Tommy was on a TV show that reviewed

56:09.440 --> 56:11.440
games when Prime came out. Tommy didn't

56:11.440 --> 56:13.440
mention he worked on it, which makes sense.

56:13.440 --> 56:15.440
He was barely involved but one fascinating

56:15.440 --> 56:17.440
thing that hasn't come up yet is Tommy

56:17.440 --> 56:19.440
just has terrible taste.

56:19.440 --> 56:21.440
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure?

56:21.440 --> 56:23.440
The characters are incredibly stupid.

56:23.440 --> 56:25.440
He complained about Prime's backtracking

56:25.440 --> 56:27.440
and scanning system, stuff people

56:27.440 --> 56:29.440
love about the game, and absolutely refused

56:29.440 --> 56:31.440
to let Victor get a word in edgewise.

56:31.440 --> 56:33.440
I had to scan every little thing.

56:33.440 --> 56:35.440
There's a great story in there as well.

56:35.440 --> 56:37.440
And that's a problem for me. I enjoyed all of that.

56:37.440 --> 56:39.440
The worst problem about this game is that-

56:39.440 --> 56:41.440
He gave it a 7.5, which

56:41.440 --> 56:43.440
according to Metacritic would be the absolute

56:43.440 --> 56:45.440
lowest score any remotely professional

56:45.440 --> 56:47.440
critic gave it at the time.

56:47.440 --> 56:49.440
Even less than the 8 the guy who wrote the text

56:49.440 --> 56:51.440
reviews for EP gave it. Tommy was

56:51.440 --> 56:53.440
not the biggest fan of this game

56:53.440 --> 56:55.440
but now it's universally recognized as a

56:55.440 --> 56:57.440
masterpiece, he can't wait to tell you

56:57.440 --> 56:59.440
he was a huge part of it. It's kind of

56:59.440 --> 57:01.440
fascinating how these two supposed

57:01.440 --> 57:03.440
industry professionals each talk about

57:03.440 --> 57:05.440
their work. Joey doesn't mention Prime

57:05.440 --> 57:07.440
at all on his site. Presumably

57:07.440 --> 57:09.440
he doesn't consider his work a large enough part

57:09.440 --> 57:11.440
of the finished game to go on a resume.

57:11.440 --> 57:13.440
Meanwhile, Tommy talks like he worked

57:13.440 --> 57:15.440
hand-in-hand with Shigeru Miyamoto

57:15.440 --> 57:17.440
for five years on Metroid Prime.

57:17.440 --> 57:19.440
Oh, come on, H1. Be reasonable. He doesn't say

57:19.440 --> 57:21.440
it like that. No, he says it like that.

57:21.440 --> 57:23.440
I worked hand-in-hand with Shigeru

57:23.440 --> 57:25.440
Miyamoto for five years on Metroid

57:25.440 --> 57:27.440
Prime. But he said on his own

57:27.440 --> 57:29.440
website he left early. He left

57:29.440 --> 57:31.440
so early they forgot to put him in

57:31.440 --> 57:33.440
the credits. He knows he's not telling

57:33.440 --> 57:35.440
the truth when he says this. Okay, look,

57:35.440 --> 57:37.440
maybe I'm just a gaming racist

57:37.440 --> 57:39.440
but is it okay at this point to

57:39.440 --> 57:41.440
call this an obvious lie? It must

57:41.440 --> 57:43.440
be very difficult to work hand-in-hand

57:43.440 --> 57:45.440
with someone on a game they famously did

57:45.440 --> 57:47.440
not work on very much. Retro Studios

57:47.440 --> 57:49.440
is based in Texas. Miyamoto

57:49.440 --> 57:51.440
was a distant producer who occasionally

57:51.440 --> 57:53.440
gave notes. Several former

57:53.440 --> 57:55.440
retro employees have even suggested he

57:55.440 --> 57:57.440
gave Metroid to a new company in America

57:57.440 --> 57:59.440
that hadn't made any games yet because he didn't

57:59.440 --> 58:01.440
like Metroid that much. Some insinuating

58:01.440 --> 58:03.440
he didn't really get Metroid's

58:03.440 --> 58:05.440
type of gameplay. Miyamoto pawned off

58:05.440 --> 58:07.440
IPs like this repeatedly, actually.

58:07.440 --> 58:09.440
He visited Rare one day and made them turn

58:09.440 --> 58:11.440
a game they were making into a Star Fox game

58:11.440 --> 58:13.440
because he had no idea what else to do

58:13.440 --> 58:15.440
with Star Fox and we all know how that

58:15.440 --> 58:17.440
turned out. It's actually pretty good. People are

58:17.440 --> 58:19.440
just mean. Prime is great but it happened

58:19.440 --> 58:21.440
because Miyamoto outsourced an IP he didn't

58:21.440 --> 58:23.440
like to a bunch of Americans so he didn't

58:23.440 --> 58:25.440
have to think about it, which gives very different

58:25.440 --> 58:27.440
implications to Miyamoto asking

58:27.440 --> 58:29.440
Tommy to do the sound effects. So now

58:29.440 --> 58:31.440
almost every game he's bragged about working on

58:31.440 --> 58:33.440
has turned out to be a gross exaggeration.

58:33.440 --> 58:35.440
The only other games he talks about are

58:35.440 --> 58:37.440
Earthworm Jim and Aladdin. I guess

58:37.440 --> 58:39.440
there's one more. Uh, Guitar Hero.

58:39.440 --> 58:41.440
Guitar Hero. Guitar Hero,

58:41.440 --> 58:43.440
uh, franchise.

58:43.440 --> 58:45.440
Uh, did some work on

58:45.440 --> 58:47.440
some of the, uh, the first three

58:47.440 --> 58:49.440
Guitar Hero games? You know, like some

58:49.440 --> 58:51.440
of the games I've worked on. Disney's Aladdin,

58:51.440 --> 58:53.440
Earthworm Jim, Guitar Hero.

58:53.440 --> 58:55.440
Any of his songs on the soundtrack?

58:55.440 --> 58:57.440
Uh, no. Did he do sound effects?

58:57.440 --> 58:59.440
It doesn't look like it. Is he credited

58:59.440 --> 59:01.440
on any of the games? On one of them,

59:01.440 --> 59:03.440
yeah. According to a Joystick interview,

59:03.440 --> 59:05.440
rest in peace comrade, he helped them

59:05.440 --> 59:07.440
get an Aerosmith song on too because

59:07.440 --> 59:09.440
his cousin is Steven Tyler of Aerosmith.

59:09.440 --> 59:11.440
He's in the credits of Guitar Hero

59:11.440 --> 59:13.440
too in the industry thanks section.

59:13.440 --> 59:15.440
His involvement seems, I don't know,

59:15.440 --> 59:17.440
kind of small. It's mostly people who

59:17.440 --> 59:19.440
championed the first Guitar Hero when it came

59:19.440 --> 59:21.440
out. You know, game journalists and celebrities

59:21.440 --> 59:23.440
and Wil Wheaton. Interestingly,

59:23.440 --> 59:25.440
alongside Brad Shoemaker, Ryan Davis,

59:25.440 --> 59:27.440
and of course Jeff Gershman, also in these credits

59:27.440 --> 59:29.440
is Patrick Klepek who 15 years

59:29.440 --> 59:31.440
later would go on to make him delete a legal

59:31.440 --> 59:33.440
threat by asking him a basic question.

59:33.440 --> 59:35.440
This is the total extent I can find

59:35.440 --> 59:37.440
of Tommy's involvement with the Guitar Hero

59:37.440 --> 59:39.440
games, but I must be missing something.

59:39.440 --> 59:41.440
The way he brings it up, you'd think he was massively

59:41.440 --> 59:43.440
involved. I've worked on the Guitar Hero

59:43.440 --> 59:45.440
games, the first

59:45.440 --> 59:47.440
three, um,

59:47.440 --> 59:49.440
the third one was Guitar Hero Aerosmith.

59:49.440 --> 59:51.440
Um, now you know

59:51.440 --> 59:53.440
why. I want to assume Tommy was

59:53.440 --> 59:55.440
joking there, but at this point I

59:55.440 --> 59:57.440
don't know. The more you look at Tommy's weird

59:57.440 --> 59:59.440
exaggerations, overstatements

59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.440
of credit, his use of we to

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.440
mean Joey, the more you see it.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.440
It starts to take over your mind.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.440
You start to ask yourself if even the stuff he couldn't

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.440
possibly be lying about is a lie.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.440
Like, okay, are those

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.440
Guinness World Records real?

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:15.440
I assumed even if everything else was fake,

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.440
they would be real at least. There's no way

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.440
anyone could get away with such an obvious

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:21.440
lie. It would be too easy to check, but it turns

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.440
out if something is easy to check,

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.440
no one actually does.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.440
["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"]

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.440
["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"]

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.440
["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"]

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.440
["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"]

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.440
Let's start with the big one. The person

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.440
who has worked on the most video games in their

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.440
lifetime.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.440
That's what he calls it, at least.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.440
I hold the Guinness world record for the

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.440
person who's worked on the most video games in their

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.440
life. My mother's very proud.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.440
The person who's worked on the most video

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.440
games in their lifetime. My mother

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.440
is very proud for the person who's worked on

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.440
for the person who's worked on the most video games in their lifetime.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.440
So that was pretty cool. My mother's very

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.440
proud for the person who's worked on

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.440
the most video games in their

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.440
lifetime, which is kinda, kinda crazy.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.440
Kind of a cool honor. My mother

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.440
is very proud. The person who's worked

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.440
on the most video games in their life.

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.440
Yeah, my, uh...

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:16.440
My mother is very proud.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.440
There's several problems

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.440
with this one. Let's start with how the number

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.440
of games he's worked on keeps expanding

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.440
and not in the sexy way.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.440
By the time of his first Guinness world record in

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.440
2008, he'd worked on the production of

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.440
272 games. Around

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.440
this time, he stopped doing music for games

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.440
and started focusing on Video Games Live.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.440
Video Games Live takes up such a huge

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:38.440
part of your time and your career,

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.440
so have you ever considered going

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.440
back to, like, full-time video game composing?

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.440
No. There was this period

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:46.440
in the early 2010s where the last game

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.440
he'd officially worked on outside of

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:50.440
Super Tofu Boy was Sonic and the Black Knight.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.440
The last game I composed for was

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.440
actually a Sonic game, and that was a couple

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.440
years ago, but yeah. But somehow, two years

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:58.440
later, he had a record with over 300

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.440
games on it. In October 2017,

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:02.440
he said he'd worked on over 300 games.

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.440
In fact, I have a Guinness world record

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.440
for the person who's worked on the most video

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.440
games in their lifetime. Over 300 games.

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.440
But by the time of the OOF stream in January

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.440
2020, just over two

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.440
years later, it was over 350.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.440
And, uh, I've worked on

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.440
over 350

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:20.440
video games. He had a busy

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:22.440
couple of years there. I read today

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:24.440
300 video

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.440
games you've had your hands in.

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:28.440
That can't be a real number. That's actually

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.440
350. Yeah, it's up to

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.440
350 now. That I know a lot

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.440
of people in the industry.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.440
I've worked on 200, uh, 350

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.440
games in my career. Okay, Tommy

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.440
seems a little confused himself how many

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.440
he's done, so, you know, just for his

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.440
sake, we should probably double check how

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.440
many. So, uh,

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.440
is there a list somewhere? His Wikipedia

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:50.440
page lists far less games than

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.440
he says he's worked on. Fewer.

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.440
God damn it. I used Wikipedia for that visual

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.440
earlier showing the games he'd worked on in the early

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.440
2010s. Let's show everything else he did

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.440
afterwards. Nothing. He cameoed

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:02.440
in Retro City Rampage and that's it according

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:04.440
to Wikipedia. His IMDB splits

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.440
his credits into a dozen different

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:08.440
categories but not games, television

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.440
and movies because it's a horrible website,

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.440
and the composer and sound department credits have

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.440
a bunch of games repeated in both.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.440
Wow.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.440
He's credited for some of them three times.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:20.440
Even Messiah's in there twice.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.440
Earthworm Jim 2's in there

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:24.440
four times? But even adding literally

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.440
all the video game credits together

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:28.440
including all the duplicates, you get

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.440
less than half the number he said he'd done

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.440
15 years ago. What

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.440
the fuck is happening? His Moby Games page

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.440
lists about 100? Uh,

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.440
it's 6.13 AM right now

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.440
and my eyes went a bit blurry while I was counting.

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.440
It could be like 98. Either way,

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.440
it's a lot less than 350 and I'm not

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.440
recounting this shit. And that's counting a bunch

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:48.440
he's just in the thanks for like Guitar Hero 2.

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:50.440
He doesn't list Pro Skater because

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.440
he's not in the credits for that even though Moby

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.440
Games appear to have copy-pasted the official

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:56.440
biography from his website which claims he

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.440
did. They somehow managed to get Pro Skater

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.440
to link to the correct game page

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.440
but not to get the spelling right.

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:04.440
Okay, none of these websites can be trusted.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.440
Thankfully, Tommy has taken it upon himself

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:08.440
to make his own list of games on his website.

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:10.440
This list is larger and I mean

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.440
a lot larger than the others

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.440
and since Tommy wrote it, there's some

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.440
dubious names on here. Pro Skater

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:18.440
and Guitar Hero are on there and so is Metroid

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:20.440
Prime. Obviously, he personally held

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.440
hands with the development team while they made it

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:24.440
but so is Prime 2, a game I've never

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.440
seen any mention of him touching anyone's

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.440
hands on. Did they reuse some sounds

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.440
him slash Joey made?

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.440
So that counts as working on both?

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:34.440
And I guess I can now add Roblox

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.440
to that list of games.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.440
If Tommy thinks he can put Roblox

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:40.440
on the list of games he has worked

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:42.440
on...

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:44.440
imagine what justifications other

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.440
games are on this list for. One of Tommy's

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:48.440
actually interesting contributions to game

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:50.440
history is early PlayStation 1

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:52.440
models came with a demo disc to show what the

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.440
console could do and some of his music

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.440
is in the menus and titles. The first

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.440
sounds ever made by some early

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:00.440
PlayStations would be music made by Tommy.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:02.440
This is kind of neat and cool

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.440
and it's also weird seeing

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:06.440
PlayStation demo disc in a list

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:08.440
of games composed for. In general,

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.440
this list has quite a bit of what we

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.440
call padding. Tallarico Studios

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:14.440
did additional music for the first

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:16.440
Blood Rain so that's one game

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:18.440
worked on, right? Well, it's on Tommy's list

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.440
five times as each console version

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.440
along with PC and Mac.

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.440
I'm not sure why you'd wanna give Blood Rain such a

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.440
strong presence on your resume but

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:28.440
each to their own. He also did the music for

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:30.440
Earthworm Jim 1 and 2.

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:32.440
An Earthworm Jim game is on his list

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.440
18 times!

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.440
Super Tofu Boy, a free Flash game

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.440
Peter made he donated music to

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.440
is on here twice! You can run

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:42.440
Flash games on the Mac too? Wow,

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:44.440
that's an extra game worked on.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.440
Fuck you, Tommy! But even counting

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.440
all of this, all the games he wasn't credited

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.440
for but still puts on his list,

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.440
the multiple times the same game is counted

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.440
across many different consoles or

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.440
computers or demo discs

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.440
as specific games worked on,

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:00.440
it's still a lot less than

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:02.440
the number he says. If you decide

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.440
to be a bit mean and remove all the repeat

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.440
games, you get around 175.

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:08.440
Almost 100 less than his

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.440
first Guinness World Record said

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.440
15 years ago. So either

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.440
he stopped updating his website and

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.440
IMDB, MobyGames, Wikipedia

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.440
and everywhere else also stopped tracking

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.440
the games he worked on or

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:22.440
Bob, forgive me, the first American

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.440
to ever work on Sonic is

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:26.440
exaggerating again. In an interview in 2010,

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.440
he said he worked on

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.440
280 video games, which is a Guinness

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:32.440
World Record. Actually inside

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.440
the Guinness Book as the person who worked

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:36.440
on the most video games in their life.

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:38.440
This sentence almost

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.440
made me cut my fucking head off.

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.440
Tommy isn't actually inside

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.440
the Guinness Book of World Records he's talking about

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.440
here. Trust me, I checked.

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.440
He is, however, inside that year's

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:50.440
Guinness Book of World Records

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.440
Gamer's Edition. The Gamer's Edition

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.440
is full of more game-centric records.

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.440
Notice that it's also much smaller

01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:58.440
and the print quality is much worse and

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.440
generally it's a lot less prestigious than being in

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.440
the actual book. My producer,

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.440
Kat, left a comment on that line in the

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.440
script saying, it's a bit like saying you gave a

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.440
TED talk when really you just gave a TEDx

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.440
talk, not realizing how fucking

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.440
funny she was being because

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.440
Tommy has done a TEDx talk.

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.440
My mother's very proud. When his biography

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:18.440
on his website calls it a TED

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.440
talk. He is exactly that guy.

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:22.440
She is so cool. I

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:24.440
love her. Tommy is at least featured

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.440
in the Gamer's Edition. It's a two-page interview

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.440
about his career and video games live.

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.440
At the beginning of the interview, the author

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:32.440
claims Tommy has worked on more

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:34.440
game soundtracks than anyone else.

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.440
They don't say how they verified this

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.440
or provide the list of games.

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:40.440
It seems a bit like Tommy just told

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:42.440
the interviewer this in the interview

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.440
and they repeated it as a factoid assuming

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.440
it was true because why would

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:48.440
someone tell such an obvious lie?

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:50.440
Whatever evidence he has backing up his claim

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:52.440
is becoming difficult to find. Luckily

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:54.440
this wasn't too expensive on eBay.

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.440
Uh, supplies are quite low but

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.440
the demand...it's just me

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.440
basically. I mentioned how surprisingly cheap these

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:02.440
were to Mandalore Gaming and he started bulk

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:04.440
buying them to leave in Airbnbs he

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:06.440
stays in, like a sort of gamer-dian

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.440
Bible. So if they seem

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:10.440
more expensive now it's because he's artificially

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:12.440
inflated the price. Speaking of

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:14.440
artificial inflation, even if the amount

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.440
of games Tommy says he's worked on

01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:18.440
was completely true, there are

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.440
still people who've worked on way more games.

01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.440
The record is just wrong.

01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:24.440
Even Guinness at some point recognized

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:26.440
this. They actually changed the

01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:28.440
wording of the record at some point after

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:30.440
he first got it. It's not person who

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:32.440
has worked on the most games in a lifetime

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:34.440
anymore. It's most prolific

01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:36.440
composer of game soundtracks.

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:38.440
The Guinness website says that now and

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.440
the updated versions of Tommy's plaque

01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.440
say that too. So Guinness have done their

01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:44.440
best to correct this mistake.

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:46.440
Tommy, however, has continued using the original

01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:48.440
name anyway for over a decade.

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.440
In fact, I own the Guinness

01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:52.440
world record for the person who's worked on

01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:54.440
the most video games in their lifetime.

01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.440
My mother's very proud.

01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:58.440
Another one of those sweet little lies we've

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:00.440
become accustomed to Tommy using.

01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.440
Although I can kind of understand this one

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:04.440
because the new name is even more

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.440
obviously a lie. I know for a fact

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:08.440
Tommy has not made 280

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:10.440
video game soundtracks.

01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:12.440
We need to acknowledge just how bonkers this clip is.

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:14.440
He's saying most video games in a

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:16.440
lifetime while showing footage of

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.440
the new record with a different name.

01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:20.440
Bonus points for the fact the record says more

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:22.440
than 300 games but then it cuts to

01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:24.440
a list he wrote with less than 300

01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:26.440
games on it. And just in case it needs to

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:28.440
be said, no, Guinness are not a real record

01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:30.440
keeping organization. They're a novelty

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:32.440
book company. It's already a pretty

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:34.440
common joke that most of their records

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:36.440
are just silly stuff someone made up so

01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:38.440
they can have a record. Like,

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:40.440
most baseball bats broken

01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:42.440
in one minute. That's a silly one

01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:44.440
I just made up now. Just kidding. It's real.

01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:46.440
I don't really mind if Guinness track a bunch of

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:48.440
silly records. It's just a

01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:50.440
bit of fun really, but they are an utterly

01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.440
for-profit organization.

01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:54.440
Not just in terms of sales of books

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.440
but also sales of records.

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:58.440
Guinness has an entire subsection on their

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.440
website dedicated to business marketing

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.440
solutions, promising they can help with

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:04.440
PR and marketing campaigns, complete

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:06.440
with a case studies section showing over a

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.440
dozen pages of companies they got attention

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:10.440
for by helping them come up with a new record

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.440
to break, like Canon with its

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:14.440
longest digitally printed photograph.

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:16.440
If you have the money, you can pay them

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.440
to help you break a record. I have my

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:20.440
suspicions a lot of the silly record holders

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.440
are independently wealthy people. You know,

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.440
some people just want a record to call their own

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.440
to give their empty lives a sense

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.440
of meaning. Guinness aren't purposefully keeping

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:30.440
track of who's broken the most bats

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:32.440
or wasted the most money on a Pokemon

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.440
card. Having a Guinness adjudicator

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:36.440
on site to verify and give out the

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.440
award on the day is super expensive.

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:40.440
At minimum, $10,000

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:42.440
plus transport and hotel costs.

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.440
This stuff gets expensive fast.

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.440
They aren't a neutral party tracking human

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:48.440
achievements. They are a paid service

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:50.440
and many of their record holders are basically

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.440
just customers. You'll notice

01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:54.440
that when it became clear someone else

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.440
should have the record for most games made in a

01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:58.440
lifetime, they didn't give someone else

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:00.440
the record. They changed it to one

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:02.440
Tommy was more likely to have. I'm

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.440
curious how much they charge for this service.

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.440
Guinness' record search function claims

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:08.440
Tommy is involved with two more. These are

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:10.440
for video games live. What great marketing

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.440
these must have been. They are most video

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.440
game concerts performed and

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.440
largest audience for a live video game

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.440
music concert. Let's quickly appreciate

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:20.440
how sneaky these records are.

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:22.440
VGL haven't come close to

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:24.440
performing the most concerts, but

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.440
for most video game concerts,

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:28.440
now that's a record, and it's highly

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.440
specific so no one can challenge it.

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:32.440
In fact, you literally can't challenge it.

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.440
The Guinness website says these records are not

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.440
accepting active submissions. This is

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:38.440
a special record only Tommy

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:40.440
can get. And wouldn't you believe it?

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.440
At his 357th concert, one of

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:44.440
those prohibitively expensive adjudicators

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:46.440
turned up to hand him the latest version

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.440
of these two records, but let's look

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:50.440
closer at largest audience for a live

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.440
video game music concert for a second.

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:54.440
Uh, the biggest symphony show

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:56.440
ever seen live. Over

01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.440
752,000

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:00.440
people watching us

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:02.440
live in Beijing, China. This

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:04.440
would be pretty impressive.

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.440
Would you be shocked

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.440
if I told you Tommy's story is inaccurate?

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.440
Not all of those 752,000

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:12.440
people were watching in person

01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:14.440
in Beijing. Some of them were watching it

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:16.440
digitally on a live stream on a Chinese

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.440
video website. Biggest symphony show

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.440
ever seen live. 752,000

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:22.440
people

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:24.440
watching me live on stage.

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.440
That was in Beijing. It's a bit deceptive

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.440
to say they were watching you live

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:30.440
on stage when they were nowhere

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:32.440
near the stage. How many people were actually

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:34.440
there? Uh, the famous

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.440
um, uh,

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:38.440
Bird's Nest National Olympic Stadium.

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:40.440
We played there. 130,000 people

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:42.440
inside. 600,000

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.440
people outside. I love that he says

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:46.440
outside when he means we're watching

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.440
a live stream. Like, is he trying to imply

01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:50.440
that hundreds of thousands of people stood

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.440
outside just to hear his show?

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.440
But 100K people attending a concert

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.440
is still a lot.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.440
Still alive-o! You know, I couldn't help

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.440
but overhear what venue he said

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:02.440
this took place at. Bird's Nest

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:04.440
National Olympic Stadium. The Bird's Nest is

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:06.440
a beautiful stadium, and it must be amazing

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.440
to play in front of 130,000

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:10.440
people there. In case you're not familiar

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:12.440
with the Bird's Nest, allow me to read you

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:14.440
the beginning of its Wikipedia page.

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:16.440
You're an hour deep into a video about the Roblox oof.

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:18.440
I don't have anything better to do.

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:20.440
The National Stadium, also known as the Bird's Nest,

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:22.440
is an 80,000 capacity

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.440
stadium in Beijing.

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.440
I think I might have noticed

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:28.440
a very small discrepancy.

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:30.440
During the 2008 Olympics, it hit its record

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.440
attendance of 89,000 people.

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.440
Tommy is claiming he got better

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:36.440
attendance than the Olympics and can

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:38.440
fold space, but because it's Tommy,

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:40.440
there are layers of mistruth happening here.

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.440
You see, Tommy has the name of the venue

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:44.440
wrong. Guinness has an article about

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.440
his record, and they say it was set at the

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.440
Beijing Exhibition Theater, which is a

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:50.440
different place. At first, I thought this

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.440
was just a one-off mistake. VGL

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:54.440
have played both venues, but the thing

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:56.440
is, though, he always says it's the

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:58.440
Bird's Nest. Uh, there was the Bird's Nest

01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:00.440
in China, Beijing National

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:02.440
Olympic Stadium, 750,000

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:04.440
people. Now, maybe he just has

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.440
the names really mixed up in his head. They are

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:08.440
both in Beijing, after all, although it is

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:10.440
a bit weird to forget where you set

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.440
your Guinness world record, but whatever.

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.440
But is there maybe a reason he

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.440
says the name of this theater while claiming

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.440
he played to hundreds of thousands of people?

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:20.440
Well, there's one.

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.440
It would be even more impossible to play to

01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:24.440
130,000 people at a theater

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.440
with only 2,700 seats.

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.440
The Guinness article also

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.440
happens to mention the actual number

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.440
of people physically at the concert.

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:34.440
2,086 people.

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:36.440
So even when Guinness has the numbers,

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.440
he still makes shit up.

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.440
Tommy, anyone can check this.

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:42.440
What are you doing? I don't trust that many

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.440
people were watching the live stream either.

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:46.440
There's no easily obtainable record of the live

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:48.440
viewership from the Chinese streaming platform

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:50.440
this appeared on, so we, and apparently

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:52.440
also Guinness, just have to take Tommy's

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.440
word for it that almost exactly 750,000

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:56.440
people watched this live.

01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:58.440
And considering we just caught him

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:00.440
lying about this exact thing,

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:02.440
I have my doubts. Even though

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:04.440
he has a record with a specific

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.440
number written on it,

01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:08.440
the number keeps changing. In an interview

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:10.440
in the 2017 Guinness Book

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.440
of World Records, the gamers edition

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.440
of course, he directly claims over

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.440
a million people saw that show live.

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:20.440
I cannot stress this enough.

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.440
He is literally lying

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.440
to Guinness

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:26.440
about a record Guinness just

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:28.440
gave him.

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.440
I just can't fucking believe

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:32.440
it.

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:34.440
I can't fucking

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.440
believe it. That's all three

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.440
of the records Guinness appears to have on file

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.440
for Tommy Tallarico. Tommy seems

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:42.440
to know better though. His list of awards

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:44.440
on his website says he has four,

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:46.440
the fourth one being most video

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.440
game concerts in a year, a record

01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:50.440
I cannot find anywhere other than

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:52.440
his list of awards and other interviews

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.440
with Tommy, so I don't know. Maybe

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.440
he has four. Well, his biography says

01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:58.440
he currently holds five, so I don't know.

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:00.440
The numbers just keep going up.

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:02.440
Can he at least get the record straight

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.440
on the number of records?

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.440
Okay, to be fair, he has recently

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:08.440
updated it. Lately, he started

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:10.440
saying he has...

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.440
seven.

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:14.440
Um, I have seven. Seven Guinness world

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:16.440
records for different things.

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.440
So what are all the others? You know, for a guy

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.440
who, let's be frank, fucking

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:22.440
loves bragging about all the shit he's done...

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:24.440
I've worked with everybody.

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:26.440
I was the first American...

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.440
Tommy is uncharacteristically modest about

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:30.440
saying what these other four records are.

01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:32.440
In a Reddit AMA a few years back,

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:34.440
he said he has seven, but just to avoid

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:36.440
wasting people's time, he only listed three of them.

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.440
Would you like to guess which three?

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:40.440
When someone directly asks him to list

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:42.440
the records, he sheepishly adds

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.440
most game concerts in a year, but that's it.

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:46.440
The others are like ghosts.

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:48.440
Tommy, how many Guinness world

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:50.440
records do you have?

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:52.440
Um, that's... so I have seven.

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.440
Um...

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.440
one of the ones I have is

01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:58.440
the most symphony

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.440
shows in a

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:02.440
single year, but I would say there's

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:04.440
three big ones. The three big ones are

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.440
most shows,

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:08.440
biggest live show ever

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:10.440
seen, and then the, um,

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:12.440
the most video games. So I have

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.440
a total of seven, but there's three big ones.

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.440
He doesn't even have a riddle prepared for this one.

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.440
He just refuses to tell people.

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:20.440
He's so shy all of a sudden.

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:22.440
Luckily for us in Tommy's investor

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:24.440
videos for the Amico, we can see at least

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.440
five of them, so let's just take a look and find

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:28.440
out for ourselves. In the center we have

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.440
most prolific composer of soundtracks.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.440
Okay, can't verify he's done that many

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.440
games, but we at least know that one. The two either

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.440
sides say most video game concerts

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:38.440
and largest audience. Those are the three we

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:40.440
know he has. Now for the mystery ones.

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:42.440
To the right we have the record

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:44.440
for the most video game concerts perfo...

01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:46.440
This is the same record.

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:48.440
This is the previous version. This one's from 2014

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:50.440
with 293 shows.

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:52.440
What about the one on the left? The longest

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:54.440
video game concert video

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.440
games live which has performed 260...

01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:58.440
These are the same three records!

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:00.440
It's starting to look like there's a good reason

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.440
the other four records don't get mentioned much.

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.440
In one house tour he gave in 2017

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.440
he has them all laid out on the floor

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:08.440
where they appear to have sat for five years now.

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.440
Look at that dust bunny. And Tommy calls them

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.440
seven different Guinness World Records.

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.440
There's seven of them.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:16.440
Uh, seven different Guinness World Records,

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:18.440
so... I'm not sure how these can be

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:20.440
seven different records if when you pause

01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:22.440
the video and look, several of them are the same

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.440
and I think when people get too up close

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:26.440
and personal with his records they start

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:28.440
to notice this too. In this clip

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:30.440
he talks about two of them, ones we know,

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:32.440
and then this weird cut happens.

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:34.440
That was the first one. That was the first one. Yep.

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:36.440
And then, uh, and then the... for the shows

01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:38.440
and then the... Where is he?

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:40.440
I didn't edit that in, I swear.

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.440
I'd love to know what happened between

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:44.440
these two clips. Here's yet another

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:46.440
fun fact. Guinness charges separately

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:48.440
for the award certificate and the plaque it

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:50.440
comes in. They have a unique design they don't

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:52.440
change very often and they're pretty expensive.

01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:54.440
When Tommy got these two in 2014

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:56.440
it looks like he just bought two picture

01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:58.440
frames from a store. I guess when you

01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:00.440
have so many versions of the same record

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:02.440
already you get sick of paying full price

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.440
for them. I'm not just bringing this up

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.440
to make fun of him, although I am, but it's

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:08.440
actually really useful data. You know how

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:10.440
I mentioned Guinness renamed his most

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.440
games record? In this one tour with the

01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:14.440
Super Awkward Edit, another funny thing

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:16.440
happens. Tommy reads out that record,

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:18.440
right? This is, uh, the Guinness

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:20.440
World Record for the person who's worked on the

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:22.440
most video games in a lifetime.

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:24.440
Wow. But because he got a

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.440
shitty frame for this one, we can

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:28.440
check and see the record

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:30.440
he's reading from says something else.

01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:32.440
For the person who's worked on the most

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:34.440
video games in a lifetime. Wow.

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:36.440
Tommy refuses to acknowledge

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:38.440
the new title and pretends it has

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.440
the old wrong name because it's a

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:42.440
bit more prestigious. He's lying

01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.440
about the text of a record he is

01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:46.440
literally holding in his hands and

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:48.440
pretending to read from. This guy's

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:50.440
a fucking genius. How has he

01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:52.440
never been caught? I feel like I'm going

01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:54.440
crazy. You know how the concert records

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:56.440
say video game concerts?

01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.440
If you've been paying attention, you'll notice Tommy

01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:00.440
always says it's for symphony concerts

01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:02.440
or symphonic concerts.

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:04.440
Biggest symphony show ever seen live.

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:06.440
The most symphony shows ever

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:08.440
done. Uh, the biggest symphony

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.440
show ever seen live.

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:12.440
Biggest symphony show ever seen live.

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.440
Tommy knows his video game concert

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:16.440
record is extremely stupid and out

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:18.440
of embarrassment he calls it something else.

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:20.440
Oh, maybe it's not deliberate. Maybe he just got the

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:22.440
name wrong. No, I can prove it. Here's a time

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.440
he does that while pointing at it and

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:26.440
pretending to read it. Here's one.

01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:28.440
Largest audience. Largest audience

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:30.440
ever to see a

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:32.440
symphonic concert live.

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:34.440
752,000 people.

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:36.440
We can see what the record says in the

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.440
previous shot, Tommy. Okay, let's wrap this up.

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:40.440
How many records does

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:42.440
Tommy have? Through a list of games

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:44.440
that cannot be found but keeps exploding

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:46.440
and by making up new definitions of

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:48.440
concert, it looks like Tommy has about

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:50.440
three but he owns seven plaques of them

01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:52.440
so he tells people he has seven

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:54.440
different Guinness World Records and

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.440
maybe he does have a most video game

01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:58.440
concerts in a year one and it's just

01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:00.440
never visible in shots of his records.

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:02.440
Guinness only has three records in their search

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.440
though. Well, had.

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:06.440
Um, I was gonna move on from Guinness

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:08.440
at this point but then there was a new development

01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:10.440
in the search for Tommy's list of games.

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:12.440
After looking everywhere for the list

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:14.440
of 350 plus games

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:16.440
Tommy supposedly worked on or I guess

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:18.440
composed for now, we realized

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.440
there was one place that would definitely

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:22.440
have one. Guinness themselves.

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:24.440
So, we emailed them

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.440
and by we I mean Kat did it

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:28.440
for me, she did all the work.

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:30.440
That's what people mean when they say we.

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:32.440
They mean someone else did it for me.

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:34.440
We worked on the oof sound. Yeah, right.

01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:36.440
I know this trick, Tommy. We,

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:38.440
Kat, asked them what evidence was

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:40.440
provided for the record and how it was verified.

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.440
Guinness were really polite and got back

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.440
to us very quickly. Here was their response.

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.440
The record title in question is one of our

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:48.440
consultant records which are not

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:50.440
open to standard applications.

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:52.440
They are confirmed by specialist consultants

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.440
that we approve.

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:56.440
Our expert external consultants that

01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:58.440
we use for records of this kind often have

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.440
professional links to the field in question,

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.440
i.e. video games.

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:04.440
These titles are research based rather than

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:06.440
evidence based. Thanks.

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:08.440
First off, this email provides me the incredible

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:10.440
quote that the record is not evidence

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:12.440
based, which is just fantastic.

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:14.440
Thank you very much for that. This is one of the

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:16.440
situations where if you did the research,

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:18.440
you would have the evidence. This doesn't

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:20.440
require specialist consultation.

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:22.440
It's a list of games. On top of that,

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:24.440
this implies Guinness have never seen a list

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:26.440
either. The record was verified

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:28.440
by a consultant, so someone

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:30.440
somewhere says

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.440
Tommy has worked on this many games

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:34.440
and Guinness believes them.

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.440
But then, something even

01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:38.440
stranger happened. Previously, when

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:40.440
you typed Tommy's name into Guinness' record

01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:42.440
search, that record came up.

01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:44.440
One of the other VGL records came up because

01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:46.440
he's mentioned by name on that record. The other

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:48.440
one doesn't. So those are the ones that came up.

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:50.440
This is a screenshot I took in

01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:52.440
early September. Anyway,

01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:54.440
after we emailed them asking how they verified

01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:56.440
it, I realized I needed to take another

01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.440
screenshot because I'd scribbled all over one of them,

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:00.440
so I went back

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:02.440
and the record didn't come up.

01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:04.440
Just the other one did.

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.440
Right after we emailed them asking

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:08.440
them where their evidence was

01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:10.440
and they said they didn't have it,

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:12.440
the record disappeared.

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:14.440
Did we...did we

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.440
just get one of Tommy's records deleted?

01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:18.440
Oh, no!

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:20.440
I didn't mean to do this.

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:22.440
I just wanted to see a list of games.

01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:24.440
Tommy, if you're watching this, it wasn't me.

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.440
It was Cat. Please don't...

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:30.440
So now the brakes have come off and this video

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:32.440
is spiraling out of my control.

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.440
We've lost all hope of figuring out

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:36.440
what Tommy is doing or why.

01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:38.440
Doing the early research before

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:40.440
this all happened, it got kind of

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:42.440
nostalgic going back and re-watching ancient

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:44.440
episodes of Electric Playground and

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:46.440
reviews on the run and watching Tommy do his

01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.440
wacky boobery and yell at Victor when

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:50.440
he says normal things like,

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:52.440
Metroid Prime is fun. I was trying to remember

01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:54.440
if I ever found Tommy funny or if I

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:56.440
was always just laughing at him,

01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:57.440
you know?

01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:59.440
You know what I gotta say to you?

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:01.440
I don't care what you think!

01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:03.440
After doing that level of research,

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:05.440
I fell back into an ancient drama I saw

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.440
unfold as a kid and completely forgot about.

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:09.440
Tommy's awful opinions used to be a running joke

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:11.440
on forums discussing his show's reviews.

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.440
People would bring up he gave Smash Bros. Melee,

01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:15.440
one of the most beloved games in human history,

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:17.440
a 2.5 out of 10.

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.440
It was a huge running joke.

01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:21.440
I learned about this because I was a pretty big

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:23.440
Mega64 fan as a teenager and they shot some videos

01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:25.440
at his house and even did an episode

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.440
of their podcast there. I remember watching this

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:29.440
on my iPod Nano on the bus.

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.440
This was shot just as Smash Bros. Brawl

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:33.440
had come out and the gang made fun of his

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:35.440
old review as well.

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:01.440
Tommy is pointing to the giant model dinosaur

01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:03.440
he has in his garden.

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:05.440
Anyway, it's clear this rumor really gets to him.

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:07.440
In an IGN thread about his Mario Galaxy review,

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:09.440
this comes up and Tommy T.

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:11.440
shows up to defend himself

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:13.440
because he Googles his name and has nothing

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:15.440
better to do. He claims it's not true

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:17.440
but refuses to say what the real score was

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:19.440
because he thinks it's fun watching people

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:21.440
spout nonsense, so Tommy never

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:23.440
gave Melee a 2.5. That's just a rumor.

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:25.440
Leave him alone.

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:27.440
Here's Tommy's review of Smash Bros. Melee.

01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:29.440
What do you think about Super Smash Bros. Melee

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:31.440
for the Nintendo GameCube?

01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:33.440
Well, you know, I gotta tell you, it's another GameCube

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:35.440
letdown, another GameCube

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:37.440
disappointment in my book. 3 out of 10.

01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:39.440
I give it a 2.5.

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:41.440
He said this on TV. People saw him.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:43.440
The footage exists. This isn't speculation.

01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:45.440
When Tommy does something people criticize

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.440
him for, even something dumb that doesn't

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:49.440
need defending like a video game opinion,

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:51.440
he just lies and says he never did it.

01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:53.440
Like, why would you lie about

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:55.440
something so stupid and easy

01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:57.440
to check? I'm reaching the point where if Tommy

01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:59.440
says something, it's easier to

01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:01.440
assume he made it up. His website

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:03.440
used to have a page of famous people seen

01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:05.440
wearing Tallarico Studios T-shirts

01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:07.440
which is a weird thing to document in the first

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:09.440
place but the thing is though, every

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:11.440
single picture on it is photoshopped.

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:13.440
Like, what was his goal here?

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:15.440
What is he even trying to do?

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:17.440
Tommy's stratospheric levels of clout

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:19.440
chasing have hit a point where I literally

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:21.440
can't tell if he's joking. He has a

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:23.440
gallery page with pictures of him performing

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:25.440
and in magazines and so on and there's a

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:27.440
celebrities section showing off all the cool people

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:29.440
he's stood next to. Wow.

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:31.440
He's really proud of some of them because he keeps

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.440
reposting them. This Jamie Lee Curtis

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:35.440
picture pops up on his Twitter when she's in the

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:37.440
news or it's her birthday. She's a wonderful,

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:39.440
kind, and talented human being and

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:41.440
a fan of my video games live show

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:43.440
but one of the pictures on here is really strange.

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:45.440
This one is of the Dalai Lama apparently.

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:47.440
Before the Amico situation deteriorated

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:49.440
to the point he stepped down, he used

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:51.440
to post on the Atari Age forums and people

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.440
were discussing the Amico's Karma gaming

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:55.440
engine, a feature Tommy later

01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:57.440
admitted he made up by the way.

01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:59.440
During the conversation about Karma, someone

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:01.440
referenced the Dalai Lama so of course

01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:03.440
he reposted that picture and said he met him

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.440
in London and he liked his music.

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:07.440
The issue here is this later turned out to be

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:09.440
a wax statue of the Dalai Lama

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:11.440
from the Madame Tussauds in London.

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.440
This is an example of what I've decided to call

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:15.440
the Tallarico event horizon.

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:17.440
Tommy has lied so much

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:19.440
about so many things, I can't

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:21.440
even tell if this is meant to be a joke.

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:23.440
Is he doing a bit?

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.440
Is Tommy Tallarico a CIA experiment

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.440
to see how far you can get in the liberal

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:29.440
games industry by just making shit

01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:31.440
up? Is Tommy Tallarico just

01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:33.440
a shadow on the wall of a cave?

01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:35.440
I...I started making

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:37.440
this video because I thought a sound effect

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:39.440
was funny! I can't tell if he's joking

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:41.440
or if he genuinely wants to convince

01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:43.440
people he met the Dalai Lama. Like I

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:45.440
said, this was in a conversation about an Amico

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:47.440
feature it turned out he made up.

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:49.440
We have something that's called a

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:51.440
karma gaming engine

01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:53.440
and what that means is that

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:55.440
everybody, no matter what your

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.440
skill level, can feel

01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:59.440
like you have a chance and that you're

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.440
in the game. I'm interested

01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:03.440
in the fact that you're using the karma gaming

01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:05.440
engine. Uh, where, where did that come

01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:07.440
from? Okay, so the karma gaming

01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:09.440
engine is just some shit we made up.

01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:11.440
Okay! Like he literally

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:13.440
made it up to get people to invest

01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:15.440
and admitted it later. Everywhere

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:17.440
you look, Tommy is trying to build

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:19.440
more prestige in ways that make no

01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:21.440
sense. Once Tommy had fled the

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.440
Atari Age forums after calling everyone

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:25.440
a gaming racist and stepping down,

01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:27.440
people started posting about how weird

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:29.440
he was being and a guy told a story there

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:31.440
about how he ran a display at the Houston Arcade

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:33.440
Expo in 2018 showing off old

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:35.440
Intellivision stuff right when the Amico

01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:37.440
had just been announced, so he asked Tommy

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:39.440
if he wanted him to put out some business cards

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:41.440
advertising the Amico, which he did.

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:43.440
His display won an award at the show and

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:45.440
mentioned this to Tommy. He allegedly asked

01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:47.440
him to mail him the award. If this

01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:49.440
story is true, Tommy just assumed

01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:51.440
that this award belonged to him.

01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:53.440
This is just an allegation. Normally

01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:55.440
I wouldn't bother putting this in the video,

01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:57.440
but the problem is it tracks so well with a

01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:59.440
lifetime of taking credit for things he didn't

01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:01.440
do and making up awards.

01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:03.440
I find this story too believable

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:05.440
not to mention. Still, this doesn't

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.440
mean Tommy hasn't done good work

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.440
in the industry or had any legitimate

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:11.440
achievements. To properly recognize the good

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:13.440
work he's done, we ought to talk about

01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:15.440
GANG. The Game Audio Network

01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:17.440
Guild is a group of industry professionals

01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:19.440
dedicated to improving the craft,

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:21.440
helping people network, and recognizing

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:23.440
people's achievements with awards.

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:25.440
Tommy has won a lot of awards from

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:27.440
the Guild over the years, at least 16

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:29.440
by my count, and he's clearly very proud

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:31.440
of them because he puts them all up next to his

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:33.440
Guinness World Records.

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:35.440
Tommy Tallarico

01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:37.440
is also the founder of GANG.

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:39.440
Recently, uh, I founded a non-profit

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.440
organization called the Game

01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:43.440
Audio Network Guild or

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:45.440
GANG. It's really funny seeing

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:47.440
Tommy give tours of his house in his GANG

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:49.440
t-shirt and of his office with his GANG

01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:51.440
desktop background and then going to his

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:53.440
website and seeing 16 awards from

01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:55.440
the group he founded and was on the board of directors

01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:57.440
of at the time. Tommy Tallarico,

01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:59.440
composer and sound designer

01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:01.440
for video games, also the

01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:03.440
president of the Game Audio Network Guild

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:05.440
also known as GANG.

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:07.440
GANG even gave an award for best

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:09.440
sound library to that sound pack he

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:11.440
made with Joey's help. They've only given

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:13.440
out that award four times in their 20

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:14.940
year existence by the way.

01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:16.940
And again, these are award

01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:18.940
winning sound effects.

01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:20.940
At least we know the sounds in the Roblox kit

01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:22.940
really are award winning. Like, at this

01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:24.940
point, research for a video that was

01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:26.940
supposed to be about the Roblox oof

01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:28.940
has gone so far off course

01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:30.940
that I needed, like,

01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:32.940
something that was baseline obviously

01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:34.940
true to hang on to so I could

01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:36.940
return to sanity. So

01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:38.940
I asked myself what I thought

01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:40.940
would be the most obvious question.

01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:42.940
Was Tommy even on

01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:43.940
Cribs?

01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:45.940
On YouTube, like I said, there's a lot, there's videos

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:47.940
of your house and MTV

01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:49.940
Cribs I was on. It's awesome,

01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:51.940
right? You did an MTV Cribs?

01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:53.940
Yeah.

01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:55.940
Yeah, they were my house. Didn't you have

01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:57.940
an episode of MTV Cribs back in the day?

01:30:57.940 --> 01:30:59.940
Yeah! Like he tells

01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:01.940
people it was Cribs, he uploaded a video

01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:03.940
to his YouTube channel saying it

01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:05.940
was Cribs.

01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:07.940
So was it?

01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:09.940
No!

01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:11.940
Cribs is, you know, a TV

01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:13.940
show. It has lists of

01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:15.940
episodes. You can just check.

01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:17.940
It was obviously a lie the

01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:19.940
entire time. I don't know how no one

01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:21.940
called him on it. Do gamers just not know

01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:23.940
what Cribs is? Cribs went

01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:25.940
to the home of massively successful

01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:27.940
musicians like Snoop Dogg and Maroon 5

01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:29.940
or other really big celebrities

01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:31.940
like Tony fucking Hawk.

01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:33.940
They did not go to the home of the guy

01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:35.940
who might have made some of the

01:31:35.940 --> 01:31:37.940
skateboard sounds for his game.

01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:39.940
Absolutely no normal person

01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:41.940
watching MTV in the mid-2000s

01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:43.940
is gonna know who Thomas the Tallarico

01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:45.940
engine even is. He did the soundtrack

01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:47.940
to Earthworm Jim. He's not

01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:49.940
a celebrity. Nobody gives a shit

01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:51.940
about his fucking fountain.

01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:53.940
Waterfall here.

01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:55.940
Which makes me wanna

01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:57.940
pee at night, oddly enough.

01:31:57.940 --> 01:31:59.940
My mother's very proud. Cribs

01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:01.940
had very specific motion graphics and they

01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:03.940
always showed the same factoids at the beginning

01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:05.940
every time, using the same visual.

01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:07.940
This video just has a wall of text.

01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:09.940
MTV had a very specific vibe

01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:11.940
with its backing tracks. This thing uses

01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:13.940
easily identifiable stock music.

01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:15.940
So identifiable, YouTube flagged it.

01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:17.940
But if it wasn't Cribs, then

01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:19.940
what was it? Someone in the comments says they saw

01:32:19.940 --> 01:32:21.940
this on a disc that came with a gaming magazine

01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:23.940
back in the day, but I think they're thinking

01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:25.940
of the other times he did that. Because

01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:27.940
Tommy's a massive narcissist, his website

01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:29.940
has a video section with a meticulous

01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:31.940
collection of his appearances and links to them

01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:33.940
on YouTube, some of which he uploaded himself.

01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:35.940
He links this one and calls it MTV

01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:37.940
Cribs Here Too, along with two of his

01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:39.940
PlayStation Magazine appearances. But here's

01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:41.940
the thing. Tommy's website is ancient

01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:43.940
and has several much older versions preserved

01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:45.940
on the Internet Archive. On the version

01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:47.940
from 2004, before YouTube was a

01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:49.940
thing, he would just put the videos on his own

01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:51.940
site. Many of the videos on the old site

01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:53.940
ended up as links to YouTube videos on the

01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:55.940
new one. The PlayStation Magazine house tour

01:32:55.940 --> 01:32:57.940
and interviews are here, along with this around

01:32:57.940 --> 01:32:59.940
the world in 80 games thing. There doesn't

01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:01.940
seem to be a Cribs video on the old version

01:33:01.940 --> 01:33:03.940
of the site, which is a bit of a red flag.

01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:05.940
Additionally, there's one house tour that didn't

01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:07.940
seem to make it to the new one, done by

01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:09.940
GamerTV. The video itself

01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:11.940
on Tommy's site wasn't archived,

01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:13.940
but Gamer.TV was a show from the UK

01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:15.940
about gaming hosted by Sam Delaney.

01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:17.940
One episode had a feature on ways to make

01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:19.940
money in the game industry, professional gamers,

01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:21.940
voice actors, and of course,

01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:22.940
a certain composer.

01:33:22.940 --> 01:33:24.940
Hey, I'm Tommy Tallarico, composer

01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:26.940
and sound designer for video games.

01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:28.940
Hey, wait a second!

01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:30.940
Hey, I'm Tommy Tallarico, composer

01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:32.940
and sound designer for video games.

01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:34.940
So this episode is using a cut-down

01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:36.940
version of the footage we saw in Tommy's video.

01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:38.940
So now we know who really shot

01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:40.940
this footage. Gamer.TV used

01:33:40.940 --> 01:33:42.940
to have a website, Gamer.TV.

01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:44.940
Oh, that's clever. It's down now, but in

01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:46.940
archives, it's clear the site used to have a video

01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:48.940
section with extra stuff. One of the extra

01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:50.940
videos appears to be about a gamer

01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:52.940
with a Ferrari and a luxury home.

01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:54.940
I think Gamer.TV met

01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:56.940
Tommy and toured his house, used

01:33:56.940 --> 01:33:58.940
clips from this in their show, and uploaded

01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:00.940
the entire house tour as a bonus feature

01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:02.940
to their website. The video linked here

01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:04.940
is sadly not archived either. At least

01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:06.940
not directly. It was preserved

01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:08.940
if, say, Tommy downloaded

01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:10.940
it and put it on his own website and then later

01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:12.940
moved his video archive to YouTube.

01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:14.940
This is a kind of cool act of video

01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:16.940
preservation except for the part where it

01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:18.940
somehow ended up being called MTV

01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:20.940
Cribs. How did that happen?

01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:22.940
I mean, the file on his website

01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:24.940
was named correctly. This would be

01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:26.940
a difficult thing to get wrong unless

01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:28.940
he did it on purpose.

01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:30.940
It's awesome, right?

01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:32.940
Is Tommy just, like, a

01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:34.940
pathological liar? Does he have to

01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:36.940
lie to sound more interesting no matter

01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:38.940
what? Like how he went from saying he did

01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:40.940
some sounds for Prime to saying he worked

01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:42.940
on it with Miyamoto for five years or how

01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:44.940
he went from being one of the voices in

01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:46.940
Pro Skater to the audio director or

01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:48.940
how he went from doing three songs for Sonic

01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:50.940
and the Black Knight in 2009 to

01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:52.940
being the first American to ever get to kiss

01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:54.940
Sonic on his little mouth? Every time

01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:56.940
something comes up again, the lie has to get bigger.

01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:58.940
In that newer house tour I showed,

01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:00.940
the guy asks Tommy about if it was featured

01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:02.940
on Cribs and he says it was on there more than

01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:04.940
once. Tommy Tallarica

01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:06.940
has invited me to his

01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:08.940
MTV Crib. This hasn't been on

01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:10.940
the MTV Crib, right? Uh, a couple times.

01:35:10.940 --> 01:35:12.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why is he like this?

01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:14.940
Why are you like

01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:16.940
this? I know you're still watching,

01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:18.940
Tommy. Explain yourself.

01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:20.940
What are you doing? What are you

01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:22.940
fucking doing?

01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:28.940
So...

01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:30.940
yeah. Maybe

01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:32.940
every single thing Tommy

01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:34.940
has ever said is a lie. Maybe

01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:36.940
some of it is true, but bear in mind

01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:38.940
that even if Tommy has

01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:40.940
lied, that isn't, like,

01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:42.940
a crime. You can just lie to people.

01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:44.940
Watch. I am a trained

01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:46.940
helicopter pilot. See? You can

01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:48.940
just say things. No one can stop you.

01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:50.940
However, there are times when lying

01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:52.940
does become a crime, and Tommy

01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:54.940
would know this intimately because it cost him

01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:56.940
$100,000. In 2009,

01:35:56.940 --> 01:35:58.940
after putting on a video games live event

01:35:58.940 --> 01:36:00.940
in Brazil, Tommy returned to America

01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:02.940
with over $100,000

01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:04.940
in cash on his person. When you

01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:06.940
enter America with more than $10,000,

01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:08.940
you have to declare it for money laundering

01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:10.940
and trafficking reasons. Tommy knew

01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:12.940
he had to do this, but for some reason,

01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:14.940
he didn't. His business associate,

01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:16.940
who was also his brother, filed a customs

01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:18.940
declaration on their common behalf, denying

01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:20.940
they were bringing that much money into the country.

01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:22.940
Tommy knew this was false. When he

01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:24.940
was caught at a TSA checkpoint with a bag

01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:26.940
with $100,000 in it, there were some

01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:28.940
serious questions. He quickly made up

01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:30.940
a story to explain himself. He told them he

01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:32.940
didn't need to declare the money because he had

01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:34.940
distributed it among his band members during

01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:36.940
the flight in amounts less than $10,000

01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:38.940
and then took the money back once they

01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:40.940
were through customs, so no one needed to declare

01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:42.940
anything. Tommy thought he was being clever,

01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:44.940
but he had just accidentally confessed

01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:46.940
to the crime of structuring, where you

01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:48.940
deliberately avoid regulations by pulling

01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:50.940
stunts like this. Structuring is a

01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:52.940
federal felony with huge fines and

01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:54.940
up to five years in prison attached to it.

01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:56.940
Later, he came clean and told investigators

01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:58.940
he lied and made up that story,

01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:00.940
and actually he just took the money over the border

01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:02.940
himself, so when I call Tommy a liar,

01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:04.940
that's not just my opinion. There is

01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:06.940
also a legal document signed by him

01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:08.940
admitting to it. Looking deeper into

01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:10.940
United States v. Tallarico,

01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:12.940
that's its name. Tommy pled guilty,

01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:14.940
was placed on probation for a year,

01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:16.940
forfeited the $102,000 seized

01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:18.940
by customs, and had to pay a $1,000

01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:20.940
fine, plus a $25

01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:22.940
assessment fee.

01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:24.940
America! There's a really interesting lesson

01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:26.940
here. In the game industry, you can just

01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:28.940
lie about what games you worked on,

01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:30.940
what sounds you made, and whether you worked

01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:32.940
on cribs, and the only real repercussion

01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:34.940
is people finding you unpleasant,

01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:36.940
but if you try that with the TSA while carrying

01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:38.940
a large, unexplained bag of money,

01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:40.940
there can be consequences.

01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:42.940
There are other ways lying can be a crime

01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:44.940
too. For example,

01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:46.940
if you lie to potential investors

01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:48.940
to get their money. During one of Tommy's many

01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:50.940
attempts to find investors for the Amico,

01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:52.940
he told the exact kind of Tommy-esque

01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:54.940
tall tales you would expect from him

01:37:54.940 --> 01:37:56.940
but in a situation where doing so can get

01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:58.940
you in serious trouble. In February

01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:00.940
2021, he recorded this video

01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:02.940
for potential investors and lists the team

01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:04.940
of so-called Avengers working at

01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:06.940
Intellivision, one of whom was Kara Acker,

01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:08.940
a former marketing manager at Mattel

01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:10.940
on Disney Princesses and especially Frozen,

01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:12.940
which would be a great find for the company

01:38:12.940 --> 01:38:14.940
and thinking she was on board might

01:38:14.940 --> 01:38:16.940
well have helped convince investors to part

01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:18.940
with their money. If we scroll slightly higher

01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:20.940
on her LinkedIn though, we can see she actually

01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:22.940
left Intellivision...

01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:24.940
in 2020. But here's Tommy

01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:26.940
telling people in 2021

01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:28.940
after she was gone, he has

01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:30.940
her on board, so you should definitely

01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:31.940
invest.

01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:33.940
Our VP of global

01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:35.940
marketing used to work at Mattel

01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:37.940
as one of the global

01:38:37.940 --> 01:38:39.940
brand managers over there, right?

01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:41.940
And she was in charge of the Disney

01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:43.940
brand within Mattel, so

01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:45.940
that's a double bonus there.

01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:47.940
Um, is there a word for

01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:49.940
lying to people? For money?

01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:51.940
If this convinced people to invest,

01:38:51.940 --> 01:38:53.940
they have grounds to say they were lied to

01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:55.940
about the status of the company. You can't

01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:57.940
just pretend people still work for

01:38:57.940 --> 01:38:59.940
you. On their Republic crowdfunding campaign,

01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:01.940
which raised $11.5 million,

01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:03.940
the pitch video for these investors

01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:05.940
featured Aka heavily in Tommy's

01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:07.940
disgusting Egypt room as VP of

01:39:07.940 --> 01:39:09.940
global marketing. She was front and center

01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:11.940
as one of the intended draws to investors.

01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:13.940
She was basically the company's pharaoh.

01:39:13.940 --> 01:39:15.940
She's also still shown on

01:39:15.940 --> 01:39:17.940
the list of team members, including,

01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:19.940
ironically, a link to her LinkedIn, which

01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:21.940
will tell you she's actually gone. This

01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:23.940
crowdfunding campaign ended in 2021.

01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:25.940
There was a period of four

01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:27.940
months minimum where people were investing

01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:29.940
based on a video and information

01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:31.940
which was not accurate at the time and

01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:33.940
never corrected. The Intellivision website

01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:35.940
listed Aka as VP of global marketing

01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:37.940
as late as July 2021

01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:39.940
according to the Internet Archive. Did the

01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:41.940
guy who ran the website quit too?

01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:43.940
Investors using this website as a source

01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:45.940
of information would have a hard time confirming

01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:47.940
who was actually at the company.

01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:49.940
People don't give, investors don't give

01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:51.940
you millions of dollars unless you have hard,

01:39:51.940 --> 01:39:53.940
cold facts. I certainly hope

01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:55.940
there's some facts I missed here. People gave

01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:57.940
this company millions of dollars.

01:39:57.940 --> 01:39:59.940
Like, seriously, I hope for Intellivision's sake

01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:01.940
Aka just put the wrong date on her LinkedIn.

01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:03.940
Well, there's gonna be some questions.

01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:05.940
In fact, if you click the invest button

01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:07.940
on the Intellivision website, it takes you

01:40:07.940 --> 01:40:09.940
to the same video with Aka still in it.

01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:11.940
You know the Avengers, right? Marvel Avengers.

01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:13.940
You know, they're the super team of superheroes

01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:15.940
ready to save the world. Also on

01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:17.940
Tommy's list of Avengers was Jay Allard,

01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:19.940
the co-founder of the Xbox and Xbox Live.

01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:21.940
This would make the company look like

01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:23.940
it was on the right track and had some really

01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:25.940
good minds attached to it. However,

01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:27.940
Allard decided he wasn't a good fit

01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:29.940
and left the company.

01:40:29.940 --> 01:40:31.940
In 2020. Here's another one.

01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:33.940
How about the guy who co-founded

01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:35.940
and co-created

01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:37.940
the Xbox, right? When Tommy

01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:39.940
was saying Allard was on the team in this

01:40:39.940 --> 01:40:41.940
footage, to get people's money,

01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:43.940
Allard was already gone.

01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:45.940
He was gone to such an extent

01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:47.940
he didn't just change his LinkedIn to say he wasn't

01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:49.940
at the company anymore. He removed

01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:51.940
it from his page completely. Allard

01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:53.940
unworked at Intellivision

01:40:53.940 --> 01:40:55.940
and after this happened, Tommy

01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:57.940
was shooting a new video telling people

01:40:57.940 --> 01:40:59.940
he was in the Amico Avengers.

01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:01.940
I mean, this guy doesn't even need to work anymore,

01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:03.940
but he loves our idea

01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:05.940
and concept so much that

01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:07.940
he joined the team and has been making

01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:09.940
huge, huge contributions.

01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:11.940
This particular comment

01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:13.940
is incredible because on another

01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:15.940
investment platform, remember Fig? Tommy

01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:17.940
had previously bragged about Allard's involvement

01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:19.940
in that investor video too. He was actually

01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:21.940
at the company when this one was made

01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:23.940
at least and Intellivision's share offering

01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:25.940
documents on Fig also claimed Allard

01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:27.940
was involved and that he was the global

01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:29.940
managing director. A while after Allard

01:41:29.940 --> 01:41:31.940
had left, the SEC noticed

01:41:31.940 --> 01:41:33.940
Intellivision's Fig was still advertising

01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:35.940
he was there. Investors were technically

01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:37.940
being deceived. Also, a major

01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:39.940
member of staff like the global managing

01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:41.940
director leaving could be causing

01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:43.940
problems with making the product they were

01:41:43.940 --> 01:41:45.940
promising to investors, you know? So

01:41:45.940 --> 01:41:47.940
they asked Fig what was going on.

01:41:47.940 --> 01:41:49.940
Orally, someone at a government

01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:51.940
agency physically asked

01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:53.940
someone at Fig what the hell was happening

01:41:53.940 --> 01:41:55.940
at Intellivision. Fig asked Intellivision

01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:57.940
to clarify. Intellivision panicked

01:41:57.940 --> 01:41:59.940
and said they would change the documents

01:41:59.940 --> 01:42:01.940
and product development was unaffected by his

01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:03.940
leaving because, to quote Fig quoting

01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:05.940
Intellivision, he has not played a material

01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:07.940
role in product development

01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:09.940
considering his contributions.

01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:11.940
He joined the team and has been making

01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:13.940
huge, huge contributions.

01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:15.940
Uh... This is footage

01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:17.940
of a CEO right before his company

01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:19.940
tells a major government agency

01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:21.940
Allard is gone and hadn't made meaningful

01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:23.940
contributions telling people he's

01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:25.940
on the team and has been making huge,

01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:27.940
huge contributions to get

01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:29.940
their money. I'm not a lawyer.

01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:31.940
I'm just a helicopter pilot,

01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:33.940
but I don't think it gets worse

01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:35.940
than this. You know, this is the kind

01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:37.940
of thing that's like, really? I mean,

01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:39.940
talk about a slam dunk. The people

01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:41.940
working at the company are the main pitch

01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:43.940
for the Amico. Invest in me.

01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:45.940
I don't lose. I have the best team.

01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:47.940
I've been a winner in this industry

01:42:47.940 --> 01:42:49.940
my whole career. I

01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:51.940
don't lose, and what

01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:53.940
I've done is packed our team

01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:55.940
with other people who are winners.

01:42:55.940 --> 01:42:57.940
Several of his key team members weren't

01:42:57.940 --> 01:42:59.940
working there anymore when he recorded

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:01.940
this. One of them had even scrubbed it from his

01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:03.940
LinkedIn. I don't think this is giving potential

01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:05.940
investors an accurate impression of what they're

01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:07.940
buying into. This is the exact kind of thing

01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:09.940
Tommy normally does, but in this context

01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:11.940
it's really bad, and this brings

01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:13.940
us to the real question at the center

01:43:13.940 --> 01:43:15.940
of all this. The big thing we've been avoiding

01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:17.940
for the last hour while we circle

01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:19.940
the drain, but we can't avoid it

01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:21.940
anymore. Did Tommy make

01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:23.940
the funny baby sound effect?

01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:25.940
Remember when that was the point of the video?

01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:27.940
When we look at the sum collective of all

01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:29.940
of his claims, the Tallarico

01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:31.940
totality if you will, and we put

01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:33.940
it in context with, uh,

01:43:33.940 --> 01:43:35.940
reality, when Tommy says he

01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:37.940
created the oof, this might just

01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:39.940
be me, but I don't believe

01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:41.940
him. Although at this point, if Tommy confessed to

01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:43.940
a murder, I would assume he was just trying to

01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:45.940
be cool. I'm sure if I was a more reasonable person

01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:47.940
I could say the evidence is all inconclusive

01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:49.940
and Tommy could have worked on the sound

01:43:49.940 --> 01:43:51.940
maybe, but right now all I

01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:53.940
know is Tommy is a huge liar, and

01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:55.940
I hate him, and he made me forget what this

01:43:55.940 --> 01:43:57.940
video is about!

01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:01.940
I promise you when I started making

01:44:01.940 --> 01:44:03.940
this video, my goal was to make something

01:44:03.940 --> 01:44:05.940
short for once. Take a break from

01:44:05.940 --> 01:44:07.940
my longer projects to make a quick video

01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:09.940
quickly so people knew I was

01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:11.940
alive. I did not expect while I was

01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:13.940
doing research for a rabbit hole to open

01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:15.940
beneath my feet and to fall Wile E.

01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:17.940
Coyote style into an abyss of lies

01:44:17.940 --> 01:44:19.940
and madness and seemingly getting one of

01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:21.940
his Guinness World Records sent to the fucking

01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:23.940
Shadow Realm. I didn't choose this!

01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:25.940
This happened to me,

01:44:25.940 --> 01:44:27.940
and I'm not happy about it. I wanted this

01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:29.940
to be a story about how in our modern age

01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:31.940
we don't take ownership of artists' work

01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:33.940
seriously enough through the lens of

01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:35.940
a sound effect that had been reused without

01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:37.940
credit for over a decade, but

01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:39.940
the people not being credited in this story are

01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:41.940
hard-working folks under Tommy who he

01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:43.940
has taken credit from over the years

01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:45.940
and the original voice actor, none

01:44:45.940 --> 01:44:47.940
of whom will see any of the money Tommy makes

01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:49.940
from selling their sound today.

01:44:49.940 --> 01:44:51.940
It is incredibly easy for hard work

01:44:51.940 --> 01:44:53.940
to be exploited by corporations,

01:44:53.940 --> 01:44:55.940
and one of those corporations happens to

01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:57.940
be called Tommy Tallarico Studios

01:44:57.940 --> 01:44:59.940
Incorporated, but that's really a

01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:01.940
structural problem, and we already all know

01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:03.940
capitalism is bad. Statistically, your

01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:05.940
most formative memories are of a global financial

01:45:05.940 --> 01:45:07.940
crisis. You don't need that lecture from

01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:09.940
me. I think the unique lesson of this story

01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:11.940
is about, well, records

01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:13.940
in multiple senses of the word.

01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:15.940
What's really at stake here is history,

01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:17.940
how these events and people

01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:19.940
will be remembered. Tommy has cultivated

01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:21.940
such a reputation that when I asked about

01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:23.940
the origins of a famous punch sound effect

01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:25.940
on Twitter, someone independently

01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:27.940
brought him up and said they assume he

01:45:27.940 --> 01:45:29.940
must have done it. He seems to have done everything.

01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:31.940
At least he says he has.

01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:33.940
The man has successfully inserted himself into

01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:35.940
conversations about sound effects he didn't even

01:45:35.940 --> 01:45:37.940
make, while the people who did the work

01:45:37.940 --> 01:45:39.940
attributed to him evaporate into

01:45:39.940 --> 01:45:41.940
namelessness. No one knows who Joey

01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:43.940
Kouros is, and he made the sound effects

01:45:43.940 --> 01:45:45.940
people think Tommy did. He worked on

01:45:45.940 --> 01:45:47.940
fucking Fortnite. I've heard his

01:45:47.940 --> 01:45:49.940
sound effects as they blast my silver

01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:51.940
surfer into dust. It's not

01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:53.940
right for him and people like him to be

01:45:53.940 --> 01:45:55.940
forgotten. Games have always had problems

01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:57.940
crediting authors correctly. Early

01:45:57.940 --> 01:45:59.940
games were seen as products first and

01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:01.940
creative work second, so credit wasn't

01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:03.940
taken seriously. Creators used

01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:05.940
to not be allowed to put their name on the game

01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:07.940
and had to hide them in Easter eggs.

01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:09.940
Mark Cerny, ironically another good candidate

01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:11.940
for first American to work on Sonic,

01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:13.940
wasn't allowed to keep any of his work or design

01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:15.940
documents when he was working at Atari,

01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:17.940
and his games were considered Atari creations,

01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:19.940
not his. His source code,

01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:21.940
notes, and documentation were only

01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:23.940
preserved because someone got them out of a dumpster

01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:25.940
when Atari closed the office and threw

01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:27.940
it all out. This problem has especially

01:46:27.940 --> 01:46:29.940
contributed to the perception of women working

01:46:29.940 --> 01:46:31.940
in games. Yoko Shimomura, one of the

01:46:31.940 --> 01:46:33.940
most well-known video game music composers

01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:35.940
today, a veritable industry icon

01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:37.940
one might say, composed all but

01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:39.940
three of the tracks on the original arcade

01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:41.940
version of Street Fighter II, but due to

01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:43.940
Capcom's crediting policy at the time,

01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:45.940
she was credited via a pseudonym. For her

01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:47.940
music's appearance on console releases and

01:46:47.940 --> 01:46:49.940
updated versions of the game, she was not credited

01:46:49.940 --> 01:46:51.940
for her compositions at all. All credit

01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:53.940
was given to the people who translated them to the

01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:55.940
new formats. Her contributions to game

01:46:55.940 --> 01:46:57.940
music history are only recognized

01:46:57.940 --> 01:46:59.940
properly decades afterwards because

01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:01.940
her early career was rendered invisible,

01:47:01.940 --> 01:47:03.940
music she wrote often being credited to

01:47:03.940 --> 01:47:05.940
someone else. This was widespread at

01:47:05.940 --> 01:47:07.940
the company. The Capcom sound team throughout

01:47:07.940 --> 01:47:09.940
the 80s and early 90s was almost

01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:11.940
entirely women. Just think about

01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:13.940
that for a second. An extremely influential

01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:15.940
group of female early game

01:47:15.940 --> 01:47:17.940
composers, all credited through pseudonyms

01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:19.940
or sometimes not at all, and with the

01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:21.940
ports of music they composed credited

01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:23.940
to someone else. Maybe one of the reasons

01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:25.940
game development is perceived as a male

01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:27.940
dominated industry is because all the women

01:47:27.940 --> 01:47:29.940
who've always been here keep getting

01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:31.940
left out of the history they wrote.

01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:33.940
If you're interested in the topic, I recommend

01:47:33.940 --> 01:47:35.940
the Street Fighter Lady and Female Credit

01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:37.940
by Andy Lemon and Hillegonda Rietveld.

01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:39.940
I've linked them in the description and plagiarized

01:47:39.940 --> 01:47:41.940
them heavily in this section of the video,

01:47:41.940 --> 01:47:43.940
but even when people are credited, the recognition

01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:45.940
can easily be minimized. Joey did

01:47:45.940 --> 01:47:47.940
some of the music for the Terminator Sega

01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:49.940
CD game, but as you can imagine, this

01:47:49.940 --> 01:47:51.940
information has been rendered obscure thanks to

01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:53.940
a much larger musician making sure his name

01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:55.940
is remembered first. The official

01:47:55.940 --> 01:47:57.940
CD release of the soundtrack has

01:47:57.940 --> 01:47:59.940
Tommy V. Tallarico stamped on the

01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:01.940
front. Its booklet says composed,

01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:03.940
produced, and performed by Tommy Tallarico

01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:05.940
and calls Tommy a veritable video game

01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:07.940
industry icon, of course. The half a

01:48:07.940 --> 01:48:09.940
dozen people who collaborated with him and

01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:11.940
wrote the other half of the songs only

01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:13.940
appear on the back of the case at the bottom

01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:15.940
as footnotes with stars corresponding

01:48:15.940 --> 01:48:17.940
to which songs they actually made,

01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:19.940
so their names don't get noticed quite as much.

01:48:19.940 --> 01:48:21.940
Joey's song was so good, Tommy saw

01:48:21.940 --> 01:48:23.940
fit to put it on another album with his name

01:48:23.940 --> 01:48:25.940
and face on it. Tommy Tallarico, Virgin

01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:27.940
Games' greatest hits. Joey's name

01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:29.940
is even smaller on the back of this one.

01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:31.940
It's not difficult to see

01:48:31.940 --> 01:48:33.940
why Joey's contributions to game history

01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:35.940
are being forgotten. Reuploads

01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:37.940
of the full Terminator CD soundtrack onto

01:48:37.940 --> 01:48:39.940
YouTube just say composed by Tommy.

01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:41.940
There's a reupload of specifically Joey's

01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:43.940
song too. The uploader who understandably

01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:45.940
missed the tiny note on the back

01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:47.940
of the CD case credits it to Tommy.

01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:49.940
The top comment is a guy called

01:48:49.940 --> 01:48:51.940
Joey Kouros explaining that he

01:48:51.940 --> 01:48:53.940
actually made it, but also thanking people

01:48:53.940 --> 01:48:55.940
for their kind words. We're at the point

01:48:55.940 --> 01:48:57.940
the actual composers have to

01:48:57.940 --> 01:48:59.940
explain they made the song in the

01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:01.940
comments of reuploads of their work

01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:03.940
misattributed to their old boss.

01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:05.940
This extends back into the regular music

01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:07.940
industry as a whole, of course, but also

01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:09.940
into material we covered here. Michael Jackson's

01:49:09.940 --> 01:49:11.940
long-rumored, now semi-confirmed

01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:13.940
work on Sonic 3 isn't all it's

01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:15.940
cracked up to be either. Like a certain other

01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:17.940
composer, Michael had people who worked

01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:19.940
for him. According to Brad Buxer,

01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:21.940
an American keyboardist and composer who did

01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:23.940
a lot of work with Jackson and actually is

01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:25.940
credited on Sonic 3, Jackson basically

01:49:25.940 --> 01:49:27.940
made him do most of it. Once you're well

01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:29.940
enough established, it only gets easier to exploit

01:49:29.940 --> 01:49:31.940
the talents of people working for you

01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:33.940
and build up your own status on the back

01:49:33.940 --> 01:49:35.940
of something you made someone else do.

01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:37.940
The industry is still constructed

01:49:37.940 --> 01:49:39.940
in a way that treats individual creators,

01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:41.940
usually the biggest names on the project,

01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:43.940
as the true authors, attributing a game's

01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:45.940
success to them and not the many

01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:47.940
people who did the work. Things are

01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:49.940
so bad even the recipients of this

01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:51.940
praise have called it out. To quote one of

01:49:51.940 --> 01:49:53.940
the worst articles ever written,

01:49:53.940 --> 01:49:55.940
there's a tendency among the press to attribute

01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:57.940
the creation of a game to a single person,

01:49:57.940 --> 01:49:59.940
says Warren Spector,

01:49:59.940 --> 01:50:01.940
creator of Thief and Deus Ex.

01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:03.940
The journalistic attitude to credit in gaming

01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:05.940
used to be so awful it's not even

01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:07.940
clear who wrote this. The article

01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:09.940
is credited to IGN staff.

01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:11.940
Basically all success and

01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:13.940
appreciation pours directly into

01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:15.940
selected industry figureheads even

01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:17.940
they're actively trying to stop it from

01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:19.940
happening and a lot of them aren't because

01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:21.940
even if it's a problem, it's a problem that

01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:23.940
benefits them. You can tell a lot about

01:50:23.940 --> 01:50:25.940
an industry by how it treats the people

01:50:25.940 --> 01:50:27.940
who actually do the work. In terms

01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:29.940
of the scope of time, the average

01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:31.940
game developer is...fucked.

01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:33.940
The hundreds and sometimes thousands

01:50:33.940 --> 01:50:35.940
of people who work on games now throw

01:50:35.940 --> 01:50:37.940
away years of their lives and so many

01:50:37.940 --> 01:50:39.940
of them go completely unappreciated.

01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:41.940
Meanwhile, the most asshole-ish men

01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:43.940
in the industry continue to promote themselves

01:50:43.940 --> 01:50:45.940
off the back of the efforts of the people working

01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:47.940
for them. Imagine making great sound effects

01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:49.940
for years and years only for your boss

01:50:49.940 --> 01:50:51.940
to tell some guy in a Halloween

01:50:51.940 --> 01:50:53.940
mask on a live stream with a hundred views

01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:55.940
that he did it. We don't recognize

01:50:55.940 --> 01:50:57.940
the work and achievements of people who

01:50:57.940 --> 01:50:59.940
make games. We recognize the people

01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:01.940
who exploited that work the best.

01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:03.940
It's so easy for history and

01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:05.940
credit to get wiped away. Case in

01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:07.940
point, we could have never learned

01:51:07.940 --> 01:51:09.940
that the oof was from Messiah and assumed

01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:11.940
Roblox made it forever.

01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:13.940
But it's not even the Roblox oof.

01:51:13.940 --> 01:51:15.940
In my household, we call it the Messiah

01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:17.940
oof. There are thousands of people whose

01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:19.940
good work on games will never be properly credited

01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:21.940
who we might have already forgotten

01:51:21.940 --> 01:51:23.940
about. Gaming is still a young medium

01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:25.940
but already the sands of our

01:51:25.940 --> 01:51:27.940
history are spilling through our monster

01:51:27.940 --> 01:51:29.940
energy sodden fingers. Entire

01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:31.940
games are at risk of being forgotten

01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:33.940
never mind the human beings who created

01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:35.940
them. The most valuable contribution

01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:37.940
Tommy has made to the story is mentioning

01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:39.940
that the voice actress was the daughter of someone

01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:41.940
who worked at Shiny Entertainment at the time.

01:51:41.940 --> 01:51:43.940
Her father

01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:45.940
worked at

01:51:45.940 --> 01:51:47.940
Shiny Entertainment. The girl

01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:49.940
whose voice was the oof would be close to

01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:51.940
30 now. She might even have heard it

01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:53.940
and not even known it was her. She might not

01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:55.940
even remember recording it. The people who know

01:51:55.940 --> 01:51:57.940
who this was and the parent who worked

01:51:57.940 --> 01:51:59.940
on the game, those people aren't gonna be around

01:51:59.940 --> 01:52:01.940
forever. We have a limited time

01:52:01.940 --> 01:52:03.940
to learn who this was. The thing

01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:05.940
about history is it happens

01:52:05.940 --> 01:52:07.940
and then it's gone. If we don't

01:52:07.940 --> 01:52:09.940
work to preserve it, eventually

01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:11.940
it becomes impossible. To quote a famous

01:52:11.940 --> 01:52:13.940
Nintendo quitscreen,

01:52:13.940 --> 01:52:15.940
everything not saved will be lost.

01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:17.940
And just as a kicker how hard it is to remember

01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:19.940
things accurately, the popularized

01:52:19.940 --> 01:52:21.940
version of the quote is wrong. It's actually

01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:23.940
anything not saved. I'm not trying

01:52:23.940 --> 01:52:25.940
to be a pedant for once. It's kind of

01:52:25.940 --> 01:52:27.940
poignant how easy it is for things to shift

01:52:27.940 --> 01:52:29.940
like that. If we don't set a precedent

01:52:29.940 --> 01:52:31.940
of taking people's work and the accuracy

01:52:31.940 --> 01:52:33.940
of records of who did what seriously,

01:52:33.940 --> 01:52:35.940
we leave it to the liars and opportunists

01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:37.940
of the world to make up

01:52:37.940 --> 01:52:39.940
that history to the spin-off of a

01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:41.940
beer company to tell us who did what

01:52:41.940 --> 01:52:43.940
and it honestly, on a spiritual

01:52:43.940 --> 01:52:45.940
level, fills me with immense

01:52:45.940 --> 01:52:47.940
grief thinking about the people who made

01:52:47.940 --> 01:52:49.940
the things I care about dying

01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:51.940
unrecognized for what they did and being

01:52:51.940 --> 01:52:53.940
forgotten. Gaming is just old

01:52:53.940 --> 01:52:55.940
enough that we're losing that first generation.

01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:57.940
Tommy got the rights to

01:52:57.940 --> 01:52:59.940
Intellivision because he bought them from the estate

01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:01.940
of its last president when he passed away.

01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:03.940
The name, the branding, it's his

01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:05.940
now. The original Intellivision

01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:07.940
YouTube channel with some of the final appearances

01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:09.940
of its former president, one of

01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:11.940
the world's first ever game designers

01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:13.940
along with the original Intellivision website

01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:15.940
with its beautiful web 1.0 history

01:53:15.940 --> 01:53:17.940
of the company are now relegated

01:53:17.940 --> 01:53:19.940
to obscurity under another name

01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:21.940
while Tommy continues to use

01:53:21.940 --> 01:53:23.940
that name to advertise a product that

01:53:23.940 --> 01:53:25.940
doesn't even exist. The damage

01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:27.940
to a history people are at real risk of forgetting

01:53:27.940 --> 01:53:29.940
whose main characters

01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:31.940
are dying might already

01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:33.940
have been done. What history will look

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:35.940
like 20, 30, 100 years

01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:37.940
in the future is being decided

01:53:37.940 --> 01:53:39.940
now. Now is the time to

01:53:39.940 --> 01:53:41.940
decide if Tommy Tallarico

01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:43.940
made the oomph for Roblox

01:53:43.940 --> 01:53:45.940
or if Joey Kuras made it for Messiah

01:53:45.940 --> 01:53:47.940
and Tommy has already put his finger on the

01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:49.940
scale, decided how he wants all this

01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:51.940
to be remembered. If you buy his new

01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:53.940
sound pack, the metadata in the

01:53:53.940 --> 01:53:55.940
Roblox oomph has been changed to say

01:53:55.940 --> 01:53:57.940
Tommy Tallarico. Those who fail

01:53:57.940 --> 01:53:59.940
to learn from history are doomed to

01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:01.940
repeat it. That's a quote commonly

01:54:01.940 --> 01:54:03.940
attributed to Winston Churchill, but he

01:54:03.940 --> 01:54:05.940
was actually probably paraphrasing George Santayana.

01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:07.940
That was me being a pedant.

01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:09.940
Old habits die hard, but here's a corollary

01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:11.940
I came up with all by myself.

01:54:11.940 --> 01:54:13.940
Those who let hucksters write

01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:15.940
the history they're trying to learn from

01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:17.940
are doomed in some other horrible

01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:19.940
way, and for one, I

01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:21.940
don't think history gets to be written by

01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:23.940
a guy who wasn't even on Cribs.

01:54:23.940 --> 01:54:25.940
It wasn't even Cribs!

01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:27.940
Oh, hello there!

01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:29.940
Thank you for watching this

01:54:29.940 --> 01:54:31.940
30-minute video and a couple of

01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:33.940
other videos.

01:54:33.940 --> 01:54:35.940
I hope you enjoyed it, and I'll see you

01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:37.940
in the next one.

01:54:37.940 --> 01:54:39.940
Bye!

01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:57.940
...accompanying feature-length meltdown.

01:54:57.940 --> 01:54:59.940
The boom mic is slowly, uh,

01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:01.940
peeking into frame.

01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:03.940
Anyway, thank you all so much

01:55:03.940 --> 01:55:05.940
for watching all of this, and, uh,

01:55:05.940 --> 01:55:07.940
I hope you had a good time, and

01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:09.940
I hope to see you again soon...

01:55:09.940 --> 01:55:11.940
for once.

01:56:55.940 --> 01:56:59.940
...

01:56:59.940 --> 01:57:01.940
When I bought this, uh,

01:57:01.940 --> 01:57:03.940
gamers edition on eBay, you know, when I was

01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:05.940
flipping through it, a bookmark fell out.

01:57:07.940 --> 01:57:09.940
This is a bookmark for Alexander.

01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:11.940
Well done for all your hard work

01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:13.940
in year two this year from Miss Dunn.

01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:15.940
Goodbye. So,

01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:17.940
Alexander, uh, I've no

01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:19.940
idea who you are or where you are

01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:21.940
now or if you'll ever watch

01:57:21.940 --> 01:57:23.940
this video. Um...

01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:25.940
I hope you made Miss Dunn proud.

01:57:25.940 --> 01:57:27.940
I've no idea how old you are now. This book came out in, like,

01:57:27.940 --> 01:57:29.940
2008. I'm not gonna do the maths on that.

01:57:29.940 --> 01:57:31.940
Um, but if you want your

01:57:31.940 --> 01:57:33.940
bookmark back, email me,

01:57:33.940 --> 01:57:35.940
and I'll happily send it to you.

01:57:35.940 --> 01:57:37.940
Please do email me, in fact, because

01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:39.940
I can't throw this out

01:57:39.940 --> 01:57:41.940
like that would be wrong.

01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:43.940
So this is just gonna be in my life

01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:45.940
forever until someone claims it, so

01:57:45.940 --> 01:57:47.940
please take this back.
