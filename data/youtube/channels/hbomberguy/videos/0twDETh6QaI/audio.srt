1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
If you've consumed any media in the last 70 years,

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,760
there's a good chance you've heard this voice.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,880
This sound, man being eaten by alligator,

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,640
was recorded for distant drums in 1951

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,560
for a scene where a guy randomly drowns all by himself.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,940
This recording then became part of the library

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,600
of sound effects people at Super Warnio Brothers used.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,900
Another scream from that recording then appeared

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,440
in 1953's The Charge at Feather River

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,400
where a certain Private Wilhelm gets shot by an arrow.

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,720
They also use it, like, two more times in the same movie.

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,720
Sound designer Ben Burtt noticed this reuse

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,020
and started reusing it himself in student films

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,280
because he thought it was funny.

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,480
As a silly little joke, he hid it in the background

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,860
of a B-movie he was hired to work on.

17
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,820
Oops, looks like culture's been changed forever.

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:55,700
Burtt had accidentally started a career-long running joke.

19
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,880
-'Help me!'-

20
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,380
-'Help!'-

21
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,380
-'Help!'-

22
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,380
-'Help!'-

23
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,380
-'Help!'-

24
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,600
In his big cameo in Jedi, he does an impression

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,260
of the scream when he gets killed

26
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,320
by an OSHA-violating guardrail.

27
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,820
-'Help!'-

28
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,600
Then other people started using it too,

29
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,940
and now it's everywhere.

30
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,940
-'Help!'-

31
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,940
-'Help!'-

32
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,940
-'Help!'-

33
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,940
-'Help!'-

34
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,940
-'Help!'-

35
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,940
-'Help!'-

36
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,940
-'Help!'-

37
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,940
-'Help!'-

38
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,940
Getting in on someone else's in-joke

39
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,440
kind of risks ruining it,

40
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,940
but I wouldn't know anything about that.

41
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,940
-'Help!'-

42
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,940
And there's a bunch of other iconic screams like this.

43
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,940
-'Help!'-

44
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,940
-'Help!'-

45
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,940
-'Help!'-

46
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,940
-'Help!'-

47
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,940
-'Help!'-

48
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,940
-'Help!'-

49
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,940
Oh, Jesus Christ!

50
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,940
Like with Wilhelm, the source of these sounds

51
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,440
are usually well-documented.

52
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,940
That scream comes from a popular sound effects library,

53
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,440
and while we're ruining things,

54
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,940
those sheep-slash-goat-

55
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,940
screaming-like-a-human videos

56
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,440
you love so much?

57
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,440
-'Help!'-

58
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,440
Yeah, they're all fake.

59
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,440
That's just a sound that comes free with Apple software.

60
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,440
-'Help!'-

61
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,440
You're welcome, but for over a decade,

62
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,440
one sound's original source was unknown.

63
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,440
This one.

64
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,440
-'Help!'-

65
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,440
This is all over Internet video nowadays,

66
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,940
but where's it from?

67
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,440
Most people under a certain age

68
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,440
are yelling Roblox at the screen right now.

69
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,440
Roblox is a free online game-slash-platform

70
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,440
people can make additional content and games for,

71
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,440
and they can even monetize what they make

72
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,940
for, uh, uh, pittance.

73
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,440
According to YouTube journalist's

74
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,440
People Make Games,

75
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,440
Roblox developers receive less than 25%

76
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,440
of the money from sales of content they make.

77
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,440
This has led to the Roblox Corporation

78
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,440
attaining a net worth of roughly $7 quadspillion,

79
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,940
and one of, if not the, most iconic things

80
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,940
about this game is its death sound effect,

81
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,940
also known as the Roblox oof.

82
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,940
Videos of just this sound get millions

83
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,440
upon millions of views.

84
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,440
It has its own separate existence as a meme

85
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,940
across thousands of videos,

86
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,940
and one video claiming to be its origin

87
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,440
has 117 million views,

88
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,440
shockingly close to the lifetime views

89
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,940
of my entire channel.

90
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,440
This sound effect is a phenomenon,

91
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,440
but it's not from Roblox,

92
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,940
and this child is a liar.

93
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
Mmm.

94
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,940
Ah! Ah!

95
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,940
Now, I—

96
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,440
Ah!

97
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,440
I haven't played Roblox.

98
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,940
I play mature games for grownups,

99
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,940
like Fortnite.

100
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,940
Oh!

101
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,440
When I was the age Roblox would have

102
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,940
definitely controlled my life,

103
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,440
it was instead being controlled

104
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,940
by stop-motion animation

105
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,440
and then later by Garry's Mod,

106
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,940
a game which did not monetize its content

107
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,940
in increasingly horrifying ways,

108
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,440
transforming its community into a digital sweatshop,

109
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,440
but I'm sure the new way is fine too,

110
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,440
so no, I haven't played Roblox,

111
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,940
but I have played Messiah.

112
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,940
["Messiah"]

113
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,940
♪♪

114
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,440
Oh, for Christ's sake!

115
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,440
Oh!

116
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,440
Messiah was released in the year 2000

117
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,440
and developed by Shiny Entertainment.

118
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,940
They made Path of Neo,

119
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,440
so they're insane and I love them.

120
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,440
You play as a cute little cherub named Bob

121
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,940
who gets blasted down to Earth to help out.

122
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,940
This is the best opening cutscene ever.

123
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,440
Bob has no combat abilities whatsoever.

124
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,940
Instead, though, he can possess other people.

125
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,940
I'm a cop.

126
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,440
You know, in real life, a huge portion

127
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,940
of the angels who come to Earth

128
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,940
end up in the bodies of police officers.

129
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,940
It's true. Google 40% cops.

130
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,940
Bob can possess basically any living thing,

131
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,440
including rats when the developers

132
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,940
feel like making you save scum.

133
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,940
The player is constantly switching bodies

134
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,440
using their different abilities, credentials, and weapons.

135
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,940
The pacing is breakneck

136
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,940
because doing so doesn't slow you down.

137
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,940
I played Messiah in the mid-2000s

138
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,940
when I found it in a Christian charity shop.

139
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,440
I assume they didn't see the words

140
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,940
sex, religion, possession, death on the cover,

141
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,940
and then I threw it away.

142
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,440
I bought this copy on eBay to use as a prop.

143
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,440
I have to get this out for the rest of the video now.

144
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,940
Then a decade passes, and in a random YouTube video,

145
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,440
I hear a familiar sound.

146
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,940
Ooh! People tell me it's from Roblox,

147
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,940
but I swear I've heard it somewhere else.

148
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,940
Obviously, I immediately forgot about it

149
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,940
and moved on with my life until 2019

150
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,440
when someone else figured it out.

151
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,440
User PlasmaNode on Reddit

152
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,440
was watching the ending cinematic on YouTube

153
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,440
for some reason and noticed a very familiar sound.

154
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Ah!

155
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
Boo!

156
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,440
Ah!

157
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,940
He posted his discovery on Reddit

158
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,440
along with a clip from the ending.

159
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
Someone stole and reposted his clip on Twitter.

160
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,440
A large Roblox YouTuber made a video about that tweet,

161
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,440
and then journalists started picking up on it,

162
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,440
although the articles do credit the wrong person

163
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,440
with the discovery because their one source

164
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,940
is a video that got it wrong.

165
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,940
Why did the sound get so popular anyway?

166
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,940
Well, if TV has taught me anything,

167
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,440
children being injured is just universally funny.

168
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,440
Let's not think about what that says about us.

169
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,940
Here's an interesting fact,

170
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,940
which I hope justifies me playing the entire game

171
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,440
in preparation for this video.

172
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,440
Everyone involved seems to think the sound effect

173
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,440
is specifically in the ending,

174
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,940
but it's actually all over the game.

175
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,440
You can fly around and flap your little wings to float,

176
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,940
and whenever you slam into a wall, Bob makes a noise,

177
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,440
and that's one of the noises.

178
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,940
It's also in the opening cutscene too.

179
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,440
Whoa!

180
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,940
It's kind of funny it was discovered in the ending,

181
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,940
the last possible place you would hear it

182
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,440
if you played the game.

183
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,940
Interestingly enough, there was proof in Roblox

184
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,940
the sound was from Messiah all along,

185
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,940
and no one thought to check.

186
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,940
You see, sound files have this thing in them

187
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,440
called metadata.

188
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,440
It's extra information that comes with a file.

189
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,940
You know, album art, list of the artists

190
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,440
and people who worked on it and so on.

191
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,440
You know those pirated Weird Al Yankovic albums

192
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,940
your friend gave you when you were 14?

193
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,940
Uh, that's why the album art was in there.

194
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,440
It was in the metadata.

195
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,940
I think that anecdote might be a bit too specific.

196
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,940
The oof sound in Roblox's game files,

197
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,440
ur.wav, has metadata in it saying it was made in 1999

198
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,440
while Messiah was being made

199
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,940
with the engineer listed as Joey Kouros.

200
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,440
Joey Kouros is an extremely prolific

201
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,940
video game sound designer.

202
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,940
He's worked on Tony Hawk's Pro Skater,

203
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,940
Spider-Man, Gears of War,

204
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,440
and even Fortnite.

205
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,940
That clip I showed earlier,

206
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,940
that wasn't just me showing off my sick skills.

207
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,940
That was a clever setup for this bit.

208
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,940
No, it wasn't actually. I wrote a Fortnite joke

209
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,940
and then it turned out he'd worked on Fortnite, but still.

210
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,940
And here's Joey on page XXXVI of Messiah's manual

211
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,940
as one of the sound effects guys.

212
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,440
See? Look? See?

213
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,940
I don't have a camera person this time,

214
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,940
so I'll have to cut to a close-up that I shot later.

215
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,440
Uh, Rachel stopped responding

216
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,940
when she found out what the video was about.

217
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,940
So there we go.

218
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,440
We know where the sound effect was from.

219
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,440
We even have a good idea who might have made it.

220
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,940
Mystery solved.

221
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,940
We can all go home to our families.

222
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,440
I'm just kidding. There's more.

223
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,940
That's only the beginning of the story, you worm.

224
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,940
I can't say that.

225
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,940
We haven't even talked about who owns the sound effect yet.

226
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,440
It doesn't belong to Joey.

227
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,440
It belongs to the company he was working for

228
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,440
when it was made, Tommy Tallarico Studios,

229
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,440
along with its owner, Tommy T...

230
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,940
I don't need to say his name.

231
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,940
He named his studio after himself.

232
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,940
Are you ready?

233
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,940
Yeah!

234
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,940
Ooh!

235
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,440
Tommy Tallarico is a veritable video game industry icon

236
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,440
according to the first line of his biography on his website.

237
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,940
I wouldn't personally go that far,

238
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,440
but he was a fairly well-known musician and composer

239
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,440
for video games in the 90s and 2000s.

240
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,440
His most notable soundtracks include

241
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,940
Earthworm Jim, MDK, and Advent Rising.

242
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,940
His company was involved with the sound effects

243
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,940
on lots of other games from this period too.

244
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,940
That's why if you're my age or older,

245
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,940
this is burned into your brain.

246
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,940
Tommy Tallarico Studios.

247
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,940
He was also on TV on the show's electric playground

248
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,940
and Judgment Day,

249
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,940
some of the earliest shows about video games,

250
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,440
reviewing new releases and interviewing developers.

251
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,440
If you were around for a certain era of game history,

252
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,940
you remember Tommy from TV

253
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,940
or played something his company worked on.

254
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,940
He also co-founded Video Games Live

255
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,440
which produced symphony performances

256
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
of popular video game soundtracks.

257
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,940
VGL is universally recognized among gamers

258
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,440
as a thing they think they remember hearing about

259
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,440
that seems nice.

260
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,940
Through royalties from his company's work

261
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,940
over the years,

262
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,440
Tommy's doing pretty well for himself

263
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,940
and he's spent his money on living

264
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,440
in a very interesting house.

265
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,940
It has themed rooms, a Spider-Man room

266
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,940
full of all the original comics.

267
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,440
Probably have about $50,000

268
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
in your hands right there.

269
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,940
Giant statues of Lara Croft

270
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,440
and the Fifth Element Lady,

271
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,940
an ancient Egypt-themed dining room.

272
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,940
The list goes on.

273
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,440
The first thing I built in my house

274
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,440
when I bought this was a seven-foot waterfall,

275
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,440
but it kind of sucks because at night sometimes

276
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,940
I have to go to the bathroom.

277
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,440
Tommy is proud of his insane mansion.

278
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,440
That's why I've got so much footage of it.

279
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,440
He's given numerous tours of the place over the years

280
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,940
and it was even on MTV's Cribs.

281
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,940
He's so proud of that he re-uploaded it

282
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,940
to his own YouTube channel years later.

283
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,440
He's very happy about the fact

284
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,940
he was specifically on MTV's Cribs.

285
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,940
He says it a lot in interviews

286
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,940
and that's what he calls the video

287
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,940
he uploaded onto his own channel

288
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,940
and there's no way he would tell an obvious lie like that.

289
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,940
Would he?

290
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,940
Foreshadowing is a literary device

291
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,440
in which he also re-uploaded an old UK show

292
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,940
where the presenter clearly hates his house.

293
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,440
This is absolutely hideous.

294
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,440
You've got to sort yourself out, Tommy.

295
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,940
You've got too much money.

296
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,940
This is silly.

297
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,940
It's not right, Tommy.

298
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,940
No, but it is.

299
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,940
There's children starving.

300
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,940
And if you're the sort of person who's impressed

301
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,940
by Guinness World Records,

302
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,440
Tommy has a huge stack of them

303
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,940
leaning up against a cabinet

304
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,440
in the corner of his awards slash Indiana Jones nook.

305
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
The big one is person who has worked

306
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
on the most video games in their lifetime.

307
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,940
I actually have the Guinness World Record

308
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,940
for the person who's worked on the most video games

309
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,940
in their lifetime.

310
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,940
He's such a big deal he was handpicked

311
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,940
by Shigeru Miyamoto to work on Metroid Prime.

312
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,440
Metroid Prime with Shigeru Miyamoto.

313
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,440
I worked with him for, uh, many years.

314
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,940
And he was also the first American

315
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,440
to work on the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise.

316
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,940
I was the first American ever hired, uh,

317
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,940
to work on the Sonic franchise.

318
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,440
Can you believe that?

319
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,940
Can you believe that?

320
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,440
Do you really believe that?

321
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,440
Tommy's been kind of resting on his laurels

322
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
doing video games live for a while now.

323
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,440
He hasn't done much new music for games

324
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,940
since the late 2000s.

325
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,940
One of the last things he did was donate music

326
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,940
to Super Tofu Boy, a game made by PETA.

327
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,940
It's a really bad Super Meat Boy clone

328
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,440
interspersed with quite good music

329
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,440
and interesting meat facts.

330
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,440
Listen, PETA, I've eaten a lot of tofu,

331
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,440
but meat doesn't scream either.

332
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,940
If it did, people would probably stop eating it.

333
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,940
Tommy is a vocal PETA supporter,

334
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,940
doing an interview for them in the Egyptian wing

335
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,940
of his house about cruelty to animals

336
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,440
and put out a statement on Facebook

337
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,940
responding to criticism of his involvement with Tofu Boy.

338
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,940
It's the only press release I've ever read

339
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,440
that has emoticons in it.

340
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,440
We can't really talk about Tommy

341
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,440
without talking about what he was doing

342
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,440
while the OOF was being discovered.

343
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,940
Tommy is most well-known nowadays

344
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,940
for what has become known as the Amico disaster.

345
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,440
In 2018, Tommy acquired the rights to Intellivision,

346
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,440
a game company from the 70s and 80s,

347
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,940
and announced he was making a brand new console,

348
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,440
the Intellivision Amico.

349
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,940
Amico aimed to be a truly family-friendly games console

350
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,940
with low age ratings on its games

351
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,440
and the bonus selling point of, uh,

352
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,440
not having online play.

353
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,440
Apparently to get people playing in the same room together?

354
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,940
Together again. Aw.

355
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,440
Some people would tell you online play

356
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,440
is one of the best features of modern gaming

357
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,440
and a nice option for people who can't easily

358
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,940
be physically next to each other,

359
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,440
and to that, Tommy's reply was no.

360
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,940
When I was growing up in the 70s, 80s,

361
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,940
and even when I was working in the game industries

362
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,440
in the 90s, you know, we didn't have the Internet, right?

363
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,940
With this pitch in hand, how did the Amico do?

364
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,440
It didn't.

365
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,940
It was delayed, supposedly due to the global pandemic,

366
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,940
but then it was delayed many more times,

367
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,440
and it still isn't out two years after the intended launch.

368
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,940
It seems less like unfortunate supply chain issues

369
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,440
and more like management underestimated

370
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,440
how hard it is to make a new game console from scratch.

371
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,440
As CEO, Tommy made the decision

372
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,440
to open two company offices in Irvine, California,

373
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,940
and Salt Lake City, Utah,

374
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,440
two really expensive places to open offices

375
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,440
in the middle of the pandemic.

376
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,440
In his video tours, the large, expensive spaces

377
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,440
are mostly empty and unused,

378
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,440
with the money guy in the back looking like

379
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,940
he's working overtime trying to keep this operation afloat

380
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,440
without a finished product.

381
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,440
This is where the magic happens.

382
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,940
Tommy wants money.

383
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,440
This is, this is, and this box is where it all happens.

384
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,940
As the money started to run out,

385
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,940
they turned to crowdfunding investment website Fig.

386
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,440
Tommy produced a video in his Spider-Man room

387
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,940
with other company leadership in his Egypt room

388
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,940
and Tomb Raider-themed movie theater room

389
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,440
claiming the console just needs a bit more money

390
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,440
to get going and release is just around the corner.

391
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,940
The rocket ship has been built.

392
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,940
We are on the launch pad,

393
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,440
and we just need the fuel to take off,

394
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
so strap yourself in because it's gonna be

395
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,940
one hell of a ride.

396
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,940
They raised $7 million more

397
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,440
and the Amico still didn't come out,

398
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,940
so they tried again,

399
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,940
turning to second crowdfunding investment website Republic.

400
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,940
They even used the same pitch video.

401
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,440
Come on, guys, the rocket ship just needs

402
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,940
a couple more million dollars.

403
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,440
Strap yourself in.

404
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,440
They raised over $11.5 million more

405
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,440
so they could continue to not release a console.

406
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,940
They tried a third time on a weird,

407
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,940
shady investor website that pretends to be a livestream

408
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,440
but is clearly prerecorded.

409
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,440
The rocket ship is built, folks.

410
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,440
We are on the launch pad.

411
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
We just need a little more fuel.

412
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,940
And then they turned to yet another

413
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,440
crowdfunding website for more

414
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,940
and canceled it partway through when it became clear

415
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,440
there's no one left to invest.

416
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,440
When internal documents leaked

417
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,440
revealing the console's internal hardware

418
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,440
was cheap, old, and rubbish,

419
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
Tommy threatened people who reported on it

420
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,440
with legal action, and when another journalist

421
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,440
asked what the reporters had done wrong

422
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,440
reporting publicly available information,

423
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,940
he deleted all the tweets.

424
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,440
The Amico's difficult non-launch,

425
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,940
fearful tossing of investor money

426
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,440
into two large holes...

427
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,940
There's not too many people here in the office yet.

428
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,440
...and its CEO's increasingly aggressive behavior

429
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,940
towards people trying to report what was happening

430
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,940
netted the company and Tommy some criticisms.

431
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,440
Tommy did the responsible thing

432
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,440
and started messaging people to call them names.

433
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,440
He defended the Amico on internet forums

434
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,440
calling detractors morons, idiots,

435
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,440
mentally unstable, narcissists, and cowards,

436
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
comparing criticism of his business decisions

437
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,440
to racism, eventually settling

438
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,440
on calling his detractors gaming racists,

439
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,440
the funniest term I've ever heard.

440
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,440
But these elitists, they're racists.

441
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,940
They're literally gaming racists.

442
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,940
He did this while following a bunch of actual racists,

443
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,440
white supremacists, and far-right personalities

444
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,440
on Twitter. This caused people to check

445
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,440
for his other hot takes and discover his opinion

446
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,440
on people who kneel for the national anthem.

447
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,440
Apparently racism is bad,

448
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,440
but protesting it is for douchebags.

449
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,940
Somebody just said I sound like a social justice warrior.

450
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,440
Uh, you couldn't be farther from the truth,

451
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,940
and I'm the most un-politically correct person

452
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,940
on the planet.

453
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,940
Don't call me an SJW.

454
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,940
You have no idea how racist I am.

455
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,940
People are saying I got triggered.

456
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,440
No, I'm just having fun and being passionate.

457
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
The folks in there that are, that are,

458
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
that are peeing their pants right now.

459
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,940
Things just got worse from there.

460
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,440
It hit the point where Tommy,

461
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,940
the CEO of a family-friendly games console company

462
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,940
in desperate need of investment,

463
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,940
would only give interviews with an ever-dwindling group

464
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,940
of diehard fans who completely agreed with this behavior.

465
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,940
The kind of normal person who wear a serial killer mask

466
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,440
while they interview you.

467
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,940
My wife told me to cancel my amigo,

468
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,440
and I still did not.

469
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,940
This is one of the last people

470
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,940
Tommy was willing to speak to.

471
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,940
And then if you want to hear me, um, uh,

472
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,940
pwn some noobs and, um, and, and punch back

473
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,940
at some haters, follow me on Twitter,

474
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,940
TommyTellerico, and, uh, you know,

475
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,940
I don't mind punching back to some of these losers.

476
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,940
He has since stepped down as CEO

477
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,940
with his replacement announcing the company

478
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,940
is entering a quiet period,

479
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,940
which is a hell of a subtweet if I've ever seen one.

480
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,440
The amigo still isn't out,

481
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,940
and a lot of people want their money back.

482
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,940
In the middle of all this,

483
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,440
right before the first big delay,

484
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,940
before things got super bad,

485
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,940
back when Tommy had a reputation to burn,

486
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,940
the oof discovery was made.

487
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,940
Due to his contract with Shiny Entertainment,

488
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,940
TommyTellerico Studios owns all the sound effects

489
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,940
he and his employees made for the game.

490
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,440
Shiny could use them in Messiah,

491
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,940
but they belong to Tommy,

492
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,440
and he can use them again or sell them if he wishes.

493
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,940
And when Tommy found out a sound effect he owned

494
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,940
was being used in Roblox,

495
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,440
oh, boy, did the butter begin to churn.

496
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,940
Tommy stepped up to the plate

497
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,440
and did a stream on YouTube called

498
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,940
Talking About the Roblox Oof Sound and Controversy.

499
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,440
It's hard going back to this stream

500
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,440
because he spends a good chunk of it

501
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,940
pitching a soon-to-be-released game console

502
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,940
that still doesn't exist.

503
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,940
We're actually coming out with a brand-new video game machine.

504
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,440
It's called the Intellivision Amico.

505
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,440
We actually don't allow online play.

506
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,440
It's weirdly anxiety-inducing

507
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,940
watching a man in January 2020,

508
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,940
right before a global pandemic,

509
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,940
pitching a console whose central feature

510
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,940
is trapping people in a room together.

511
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,940
Everybody can kind of come together

512
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,440
and play in the same room together.

513
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,940
But when he wasn't pitching

514
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,940
his scam-adjacent business venture,

515
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,940
Tommy was demanding Roblox give him $100 million.

516
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,940
Tommy wants money.

517
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,940
Okay, for legal reasons, I'd like to specify

518
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,940
that was a joke. He didn't ask for that much.

519
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,440
Probably.

520
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,940
He didn't say how much he wanted.

521
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,440
Almost like he was embarrassed to.

522
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Tommy made it clear he didn't want Roblox

523
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,940
to remove the sound.

524
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,940
He wanted them to keep using it but to pay him for it,

525
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,440
and if they didn't, things were going to court.

526
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,440
They may think that, you know,

527
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,940
I'm trying to get the sound taken out of the game.

528
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,440
I'm not.

529
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,440
They may think that I'm currently suing Roblox.

530
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,940
I'm not currently.

531
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,440
But it's also not fair to me

532
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,940
that I don't get compensated for this.

533
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,440
This situation is, legally speaking, very funny.

534
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,940
Allow me to pretend I understand it for a few minutes.

535
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,440
A key point here is, at least as far as I can tell,

536
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,940
so probably wrong,

537
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,940
Tommy isn't owed any compensation.

538
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,940
According to Roblox, the oeuvre came on a CD

539
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,940
of sound effects the original creators purchased

540
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,440
when they were making the game in the mid-2000s.

541
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,440
If this is true, they used the sound

542
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,440
with the reasonable belief they had the right

543
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,940
to do so at the time.

544
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,940
Whoever took the sound out of Messiah

545
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,440
and sold it on a CD could be in trouble,

546
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,440
but the two guys who started Roblox in 2006

547
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,940
didn't do anything wrong apart from create Roblox.

548
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,940
Okay, I've spoken to a couple of lawyers

549
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,940
after filming this bit.

550
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,440
Should have done beforehand, really,

551
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
and they clarified something I think I should add here

552
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,440
about them not doing anything wrong.

553
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,940
They did still technically do copyright infringement.

554
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,440
If you use a sound effect you bought from someone

555
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,440
and it turns out they stole it and lied to you,

556
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,440
you're still guilty of copyright infringement.

557
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,440
However, if this actually went to court,

558
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,440
there is something called the innocent infringer defense.

559
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,940
If an infringer can demonstrate they had no reason

560
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,440
to believe they had committed copyright infringement

561
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,440
and it looks like Roblox might be able to do that,

562
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,440
the court can reduce the statutory damages

563
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,940
to as low as $200 per infringement.

564
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,440
There are other types of damages like actual damages,

565
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,940
the losses suffered by the owner

566
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,440
as a result of the infringement,

567
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,940
but that's something that could only be answered

568
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,940
in a courtroom.

569
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,940
As you're about to see, however,

570
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,440
Roblox directly told Tommy

571
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
they don't think they owe him anything,

572
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,940
so it sounds like they think they have a good defense

573
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,440
if things go to court.

574
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
In these tweets a few days before the stream,

575
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,940
Tommy seems a bit annoyed that no one owes him money,

576
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,440
although in his version, Roblox feel like

577
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,940
they don't owe him anything,

578
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,440
which is a strange way of describing a large corporation.

579
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,940
I think what Tommy means is Roblox's lawyers

580
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,440
know what the law is,

581
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,940
but he still would like to have some money.

582
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,440
All Roblox are required to do in this situation

583
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,940
is remove the sound,

584
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,940
and Tommy could send a cease and desist

585
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,440
and trigger that happening whenever he wanted.

586
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,440
I could have sent a letter very easy.

587
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,940
Cease and desist. Stop using the sound.

588
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,940
It's mine. You don't have permission to use it.

589
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,440
Take it out of your game.

590
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,940
But Tommy isn't doing that

591
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,440
because he doesn't want it taken out.

592
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,940
Tommy wants money.

593
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,440
If he can get them to keep it in

594
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,940
and pay him a license fee to use it

595
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,440
or just buy the sound off him outright,

596
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,440
he could make a lot of money.

597
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,440
I'd rather them just, uh, pay me

598
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,440
and them own the sound forever

599
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,940
so that it stays in the game.

600
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,440
Tommy cannot stress enough

601
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,940
how much he doesn't want Roblox to remove the sound

602
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,440
because that's how he makes money from this.

603
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,440
Uh, I never asked Roblox to remove the sound.

604
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,440
I don't want it to be removed.

605
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,940
I haven't told them to take the sound out of the game.

606
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,440
I want to keep the sound in the game, so...

607
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,440
And Roblox probably want to keep

608
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,940
the immensely popular sound in their game.

609
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,440
However, they are a business.

610
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,440
Their ultimate goal is to keep

611
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,440
as much of their money as possible.

612
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,940
A majority of Roblox's income

613
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,440
comes from underpaying the people

614
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,440
who actually make the game's content.

615
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,440
How much do you think they're willing to pay

616
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,440
for .3 seconds of a child saying ow,

617
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,440
especially when they could replace it for free?

618
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,940
Uh, Roblox could remove the sound tomorrow

619
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,440
if they wanted to.

620
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,440
So when Tommy approached them asking for money,

621
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,440
Roblox offered him less.

622
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,940
We approached Roblox.

623
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,940
We said, hey, there's a situation,

624
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,940
and we're gonna ask for this much.

625
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,940
Roblox said, eh,

626
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,940
we think you should get this much.

627
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,440
So, so, you know, this much is what we think.

628
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,940
Just to put it in plain English,

629
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,940
the purpose of this stream is for Tommy

630
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,940
to complain that Roblox will not offer him

631
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,940
enough money to buy a sound effect they don't need.

632
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,940
I think they're, they're nuts and disrespectful to me.

633
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,940
This is an all-time classic Tallarico moment right here.

634
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,940
Complaining about respect while calling someone nuts

635
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,440
and asking them for more money.

636
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,940
It's just incredible.

637
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,940
I'm hoping that we can come together,

638
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,440
I don't know, maybe somewhere in the middle,

639
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,440
uh, to make everyone happy.

640
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
One question really starts to stand out

641
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,440
in this 90-minute stream.

642
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,940
How much money does he want?

643
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,440
He's very careful to never say how much he thinks

644
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,940
the sound effect is worth, how much he asked for,

645
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,440
or how much they offered him.

646
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,440
And I can't tell you, people are gonna say,

647
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,440
well, how much did you ask for?

648
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,440
Look, you have to understand

649
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,440
that it is not professional of me

650
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,440
to go around stating how much money I'm asking

651
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,440
and how much they are offering.

652
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,940
Just to be clear, unless there's some kind

653
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,440
of non-disclosure agreement,

654
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,440
which he probably would have said if there was,

655
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,440
there isn't anything actually stopping Tommy

656
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,940
from saying how much he wants for the sound effect.

657
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,940
The Amico saga has proven irrefutably

658
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,440
that Tommy does not care in the slightest

659
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
about appearing professional.

660
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,440
That excuse doesn't work.

661
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,440
He's choosing not to say it

662
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
and getting increasingly defensive

663
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,940
as viewers keep asking and he runs out of explanations.

664
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,940
To be honest, none of your damn business.

665
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,940
No, no.

666
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,440
How much did you say for them to pay for the oof sound?

667
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,940
Okay, well, I've already gone over that,

668
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,440
that I can't talk about that.

669
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,440
To an outside observer and the chat

670
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,940
whose questions he was dodging,

671
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,940
it started to feel like Tommy just wanted

672
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,440
a embarrassingly large amount of money

673
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for a single sound effect

674
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,940
and knew that it would make him look

675
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,440
really greedy if he said it.

676
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,940
People are never gonna know, you know, what it is

677
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,440
and there doesn't need to be that knowledge.

678
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,440
He's in the fascinatingly awkward position

679
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,440
of not being able to say how much he wants

680
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,940
even though that's what the stream is about.

681
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,440
It would be unprofessional to talk about that,

682
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,940
um, but I think I did describe that it's,

683
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,440
um, a lot more than what, you know,

684
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,940
they were offering which was barely anything at all.

685
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,940
I think it's worth asking how much barely anything is

686
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,940
to a millionaire with a dedicated Spider-Man room

687
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,440
and an indoor waterfall in his mansion.

688
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,440
Everyone should have a seven-foot waterfall,

689
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,940
I think, installed in your room,

690
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,940
but the thing that's kind of bad about it

691
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,440
is that at night,

692
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,940
I always have to go to the bathroom.

693
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,940
Wait a minute. Didn't he already make that joke?

694
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,940
Later in the stream, he started taking questions

695
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,940
and someone asked him to give the ratio

696
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,440
how different the counteroffer was.

697
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,440
Tommy, percentage-wise, how far is Roblox offer

698
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,940
compared to what you ask for?

699
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,940
At least 100 times...

700
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,940
less.

701
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:11,440
So that, you know, if they offered me $1,

702
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,940
I'm asking for $100.

703
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,440
So, you know, if they offered me $1,000,

704
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,440
that means I'm asking for $100,000, right?

705
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,440
So that's how far it is off.

706
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,440
I find it very curious that he will say

707
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,940
how much he asked for,

708
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,940
but only in the form of a riddle.

709
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,940
Even more curiously, he uses very small amounts

710
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,440
of money as examples.

711
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,440
He chooses not to say, for example,

712
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,940
if they offered me $50,000,

713
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,440
that means I asked for $5,000,000,

714
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,440
or if they offered me $100,000, okay,

715
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,440
I can see why he didn't.

716
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,440
And I hope they come to their senses.

717
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,440
And I know they're probably watching.

718
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,440
I don't know. Maybe they're not.

719
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,940
It's Saturday morning.

720
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,440
So that was the situation in January 2020.

721
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
Roblox were offering to buy the sound.

722
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,440
Tommy wanted 100 times more money

723
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,440
than they were offering,

724
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,940
and if things didn't go his way,

725
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,940
he was threatening to take things to court.

726
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:05,440
You know, I have attorneys that I have teams of attorneys.

727
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,940
I usually have about 20 different lawyers.

728
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,440
It's just a difference of opinion

729
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,940
on whether or not I helped to bring millions of people

730
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,440
to their game or not and what that is worth.

731
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,940
That last thing is, I think,

732
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,440
why Tommy thinks he can ask

733
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,440
for whatever massive amount of money he won't say.

734
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,940
In his mind, this one sound effect

735
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,440
single-handedly launched the Roblox franchise.

736
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,940
But the idea is that this is a sound

737
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,440
that helped to create the franchise, right?

738
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,940
Some may say even that the reason Roblox

739
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,940
is as popular as it is now

740
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,940
may be because of the fact

741
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,440
that so many people share this oof sound.

742
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,940
So, some may say,

743
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,440
Tommy, you don't need to launder your arguments like that.

744
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,440
You are the one saying that right now.

745
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,440
This is something that helped

746
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,940
to create the franchise itself.

747
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,440
It's made the game Roblox go supersonic.

748
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,440
It was part of the reason.

749
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,440
How many millions of people found out

750
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,440
about the game Roblox because of a meme

751
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,440
that used because of the sound, right?

752
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,440
We think we're asking for something extremely fair

753
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,940
considering what it has done for the franchise.

754
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,440
These claims are hilarious, exaggerated,

755
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,440
but most of all, wrong.

756
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,940
Take the sound effects from Minecraft

757
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,940
that are really popular and people use a lot in videos too.

758
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,940
They have a huge presence online as well,

759
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,440
but they didn't make Minecraft popular.

760
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,440
They're popular because they're in a game

761
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,440
millions of children have played.

762
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,940
The Roblox oof took off in mid-2017

763
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,940
when Roblox was already a pretty mainstream thing.

764
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,440
The cause and effect is completely backwards here.

765
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,440
While it might not be entirely impossible

766
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,440
for a single sound effect to make a game very popular,

767
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,440
I would like to remind everyone

768
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,440
that this sound effect was already in a game,

769
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,440
and that game was such a massive critical

770
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,940
and commercial failure that no one noticed

771
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,440
the sound effect had been stolen for 20 fucking years.

772
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,440
Come on, bud.

773
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,440
Roblox didn't become a multi-billion dollar company

774
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,940
because of a sound effect.

775
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,440
They got there by being evil.

776
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,440
Speaking of evil, Roblox eventually worked with Tommy

777
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,940
to turn all of this into a whole new way

778
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,440
of monetizing their empire of nightmares.

779
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,440
Instead of paying Tommy for the sound,

780
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,440
they're making the players pay for it.

781
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,440
In November 2020, Roblox announced

782
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,440
the oof sound was going to be removed,

783
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,440
but they were updating their developer marketplace

784
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,940
so players could purchase sounds to use in their games,

785
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,940
and once this update was complete,

786
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,440
the oof sound could be purchased and used through there.

787
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,440
I assume Tommy would get a cut from this.

788
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,940
Simultaneously, Tommy announced he had produced

789
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,440
a sound effects pack for creators

790
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,940
to use in their Roblox games, including the oof.

791
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:50,940
I have done a brand new sound design library

792
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,940
just for Roblox.

793
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,440
Creators could buy a range of sound effects packs

794
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,940
costing from $10 to $250

795
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,940
and use these in the games they make.

796
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,940
Roblox and Tommy agreed to keep the sound in the game

797
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,940
as is for a while so the sound marketplace

798
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,440
had time to get up and running

799
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,940
and no one had to go oof-less in the meantime.

800
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,440
But this functionality still hasn't been added

801
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,940
a year and a half later.

802
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,440
Eventually, in July this year,

803
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,440
Roblox, citing a licensing issue,

804
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,940
removed the sound and replaced it with this one.

805
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,940
Gah! Which is rubbish, frankly,

806
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,440
but it might be bad on purpose to incentivize paying

807
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,940
to replace it once they get the marketplace up.

808
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,940
So clever move, I guess.

809
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,940
You bags of scum!

810
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,440
Tommy also got to make some official oof merch,

811
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,940
so that was nice for him, I suppose.

812
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,440
I've created an oof T-shirt.

813
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,940
It doesn't look like he got the massive payday he wanted,

814
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,940
especially since the audio marketplace

815
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,440
hasn't manifested yet,

816
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,940
but at least he got something out of it.

817
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,440
So there we go.

818
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,440
Wasn't that an interesting story?

819
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,440
That's the end of the video essay.

820
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,940
Don't look at the run time.

821
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,440
Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it.

822
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,440
If you came here to find the origins of a sound effect,

823
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,440

Go play Roblox or something.

827

Go do whatever it is you do in your fun house.

837
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,940
This video is being filmed at an undisclosed location

838
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,440
to avoid being traced.

839
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,940
Also, Mom went on holiday and she locked the garage

840
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,940
so I can't get to my set.

841
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,440
And no, I have no idea why the back wall

842
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,440
of this room is also green.

843
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,940
The last guy who lived here had terrible taste.

00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,440
Anyway, I think he's gone.

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,440
Okay, we need to talk about Tommy.

846
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,940
This is where the video was supposed to finish.

847
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,440
So I was writing up the script and doing a bit more research,

848
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,940
and then I re-watched Tommy's E3 2021 pitch

849
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,440
for the Amico, and I realized something.

850
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,440
He takes credit for creating the oomph

851
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,940
in a very particular way.

852
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:10,940
I'm even the guy who did the oomph sound for Roblox.

853
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,940
He made the sound for Roblox?

854
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,440
I thought I misheard him or maybe he misspoke,

855
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,940
but no, that's how he says it.

856
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,440
The thing that you might know me the most from

857
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,440
is the guy who created

858
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,940
the beloved oomph sound for Roblox.

859
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,940
That's right.

860
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,440
The sound wasn't made for Roblox.

861
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,940
It was made for another game and reused by mistake.

862
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,940
That's what this whole thing was about, Tommy.

863
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,440
He said that one in the commercial

864
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,440
for his sound design kits he's selling

865
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,940
to put it back in the game.

866
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,440
Why is he saying it like that?

867
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,940
Well, obviously the idea he made it for Roblox,

868
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,940
this massive, important corporation,

869
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,940
is slightly more prestigious than the truth, isn't it?

870
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,940
So he's slightly altering the story

871
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,440
to give himself a bit more credit,

872
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,440
and that's fine. Like, whatever. Who cares?

873
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,940
But then I thought, you know,

874
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,440
for a sound with another guy's name on it,

875
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,940
he seems pretty happy to say he personally made it

876
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,440
for Roblox.

877
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,940
From an outsider's perspective,

878
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,440
it looks a bit like Tommy is taking credit

879
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,940
for something someone who worked for him did

880
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,440
decades later.

881
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,940
And yeah, sure, my script was almost done,

882
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,940
but I couldn't let that possibility sit unexplored.

883
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:20,940
So I tried to figure out who actually made the sound,

884
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,940
and what I discovered was...

885
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,440
interesting.

886
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,940
And then a bunch more other shit happened,

887
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,940
and now the video is this long.

888
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,440

Back in 2019, Tommy quote-tweeted that one video

899
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,940
that was a repost of the thing PlasmaNode put on Reddit.

900
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,440
He indicates that his company created

901
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,440
and owns the sounds used for Messiah

902
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,940
and that the sound effects was created

903
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,440
by my lead sound designer Joey Kouros.

904
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,940
Notice that he specifically doesn't say that he made it.

905
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,940
He says his company created and owns it

906
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,940
and then specifically credits Joey,

907
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,940
implying little to no direct personal involvement.

908
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:23,440
I believe this version of Tommy's story is true.

909
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,440
However, soon after writing this,

910
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,440
to put it bluntly, it looks like Tommy realized

911
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,940
how popular the sound was.

912
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,940
He's said in many places, including the livestream,

913
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,440
that he didn't really know that much about Roblox

914
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,440
until he found out one of his sounds was in it.

915
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,440
So on a timeline, it looks like he wrote that tweet

916
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,440
and then started looking at the sound's presence online.

917
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,940
In his next tweet, he says he's surprised

918
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,440
to discover the sound has tens of millions of views online

919
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,440
and then all of a sudden it's a sound we created

920
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,440
and then, and he adds this in parenthesis

921
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,440
like he's trying to sneak it into the story

922
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,440
at the last minute,

923
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,940
and I myself recorded.

924
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,440
This is a bit of a change, isn't it?

925
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,440
It's also just a weird way of talking

926
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,940
about something you created.

927
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,440
Like, if you found out something you had made,

928
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,440
you, was in a huge game, you would go,

929
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,440
hey, I made that.

930
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,940
You wouldn't go, as you can see,

931
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,440
my company created and owns that.

932
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,940
It was made by someone who worked for me decades ago.

933
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,440
Oh, wait, the sound's really popular.

934
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,440
I mean, we made it and I myself recorded it.

935
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,440
And to his credit,

936
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,440
I think Tommy noticed how this sounds too

937
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,440
because 30 minutes later, he tried again.

938
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,440
He started a second thread where this time

939
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,440
it's a sound he created, Joey edited, and he owns.

940
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,440
Note that he specifically used the word created again.

941
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,440
So he got his story straight in the end at least.

942
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,440
Good for him.

943
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,440
But that does mean this first tweet

944
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,440
is a bit embarrassing, isn't it?

945
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,440
Now, you tell me,

946
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,440
what one thing would make Tommy look more like

947
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,440
he was trying to rewrite the history after the fact here?

948
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,440
Deleting the tweet, right?

949
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,440
From my perspective,

950
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,440
that would be a very stupid thing to do.

951
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,440
But I must be missing something because he did delete it.

952
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,440
It's gone.

953
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,440
I am not accusing famous industry veteran

954
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,440
Tommy Tallarico of lying about who made a sound here.

955
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,440
I don't know for sure who did what on this sound.

956
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,440
But Tommy should.

957
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,440
And if he's telling the truth,

958
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,440
why did the truth change

959
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,440
when he was surprised by how popular the sound was?

960
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,440
In a very short span of time,

961
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,440
Tommy's version of history went from

962
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,440
Joey created it to we created it

963
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,440
to I created it,

964
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,440
and then later an attempt to delete the fact

965
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,440
he said Joey created it.

966
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,440
I know how it sounds.

967
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,440
It would be weird to assume someone just wants to brag

968
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,440
about making this one sound effect this badly.

969
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,440
But he does brag about it.

970
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,440
He put it in his Twitter handle.

971
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,440
It's part of his pitch for the Amico.

972
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,440
It seems very important to Tommy

973
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,440
that he doesn't just own the sound,

974
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,440
that he personally created it.

975
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,440
To most people younger than me,

976
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,440
that sound effect could be the most well-known thing

977
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,440
on his resume, which is a bit depressing, really.

978
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,440
And when he tries to describe the process

979
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,440
of creating the sound, things get even weirder.

980
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,440
In the OOF livestream,

981
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,440
Tommy's happy to say he made the sound,

982
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,440
but then he tries to go into detail about how it was made.

983
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,440
I thought what first I would do

984
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,440
is talk about how the OOF sound was created.

985
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,440
When he talks about the work

986
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,440
that went into making the sound,

987
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,440
he doesn't say he did anything.

988
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,440
He says we.

989
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,440
Then what we did is we went through,

990
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,440
you know, all the different lines.

991
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,440
We did a whole bunch of other stuff to it as well.

992
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,440
So after we pitch shifted it down and then...

993
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,440
Sometimes he accidentally says I and then corrects himself.

994
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,440
I wanted to let folks know how I created the sound,

995
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,440
how we created the sound,

996
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,440
myself and my sound designer Joey Kuras.

997
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,440
It just keeps going like this.

998
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,440
We start to tweak the sound, each individual sound.

999
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,440
So again, in OOF, we might have spent, you know,

1000
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,440
a half hour trying to figure out exactly

1001
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,440
which way we should have pitched it down

1002
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,440
and what thing we would have taken and this and that.

1003
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,440
OOF!

1004
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,440
This is a strange way to describe something you did.

1005
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,440
Far from being a sound he created and Joey merely edited,

1006
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,440
whenever he has to describe any specifics,

1007
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,440
all of a sudden it was done by committee.

1008
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
Tommy isn't lying about who did what here.

1009
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,440
Quite the opposite, really.

1010
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,440
He's specifically avoiding lying

1011
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,440
by being as vague as possible about something

1012
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,440
it would be easy to talk about

1013
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,440
if he actually made the sound himself.

1014
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,440
So I took this little girl's, uh,

1015
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,440
we took the clip, right,

1016
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,440
and then what we did is we edited it

1017
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,440
and we kept the length of the sound.

1018
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,440
He struggles to come up with anything he actually did.

1019
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,440
Like, his knowledge helped?

1020
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,440
And, um, we'll say, uh...

1021
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,440
I want to say this right.

1022
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,440
I mean, it took a lot of my knowledge of audio

1023
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,440
to create this sound and make it sound unique.

1024
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,440
Now that people know about me,

1025
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,440
they know about how I created the Roblox sound.

1026
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,440
After seeing a guy specifically avoid saying I

1027
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
and say we dozens of times

1028
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,440
and then finish the story by saying,

1029
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,440
so that's how I made the sound,

1030
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
it just comes off really disingenuous.

1031
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,440
One quick indicator of what he could mean by we is

1032
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,440
at one point he uses it to describe the act

1033
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,440
of exporting the sound out of the program.

1034
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,440
You know, compressing it and making it all,

1035
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,440
EQing it and doing all these crazy things to it.

1036
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,440
Uh, before we ended up saving it out, so...

1037
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,440
When he says we here, he just means Joey.

1038
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,440
It only takes one person to hit save on a file,

1039
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,440
and that's the one thing we know for sure Joey did.

1040
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,440
Like with the money situation,

1041
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,440
it's hard not to read into why Tommy is talking strangely.

1042
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,440
It starts to sound like Joey did most of the work,

1043
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,440
but then that would mean someone else

1044
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,440
deserves the credit for creating the sound,

1045
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,440
so all of a sudden this .3 second sound effect

1046
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,440
becomes a team effort.

1047
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,440
That's Tommy's version of how the sound was made.

1048
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,440
He says we, but sometimes when he says we,

1049
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,440
he just means Joey, so what's Joey's version?

1050
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,440
Joey's been pretty quiet about all this,

1051
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,440
and good for him.

1052
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,440
His career's still going strong,

1053
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,440
unlike some people's,

1054
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,440
and I'm sure he has better things to do

1055
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,440
than litigate who made an ancient sound effect,

1056
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,440
unlike me who apparently has plenty of time for that shit.

1057
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,440
However, Kuras does have a website

1058
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,440
where he maintains credits for every game

1059
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,440
he's worked on since 1993,

1060
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,440
and he's still updating it today.

1061
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,440
Next to Messiah, Joey puts,

1062
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,440
design of all sound effects.

1063
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,440
After witnessing someone claim Joey did it,

1064
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,440
change their mind, delete the story,

1065
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,440
and then talk in very vague terms

1066
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
about who did what,

1067
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,440
seeing someone just say,

1068
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,440
I designed all the sound effects

1069
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,440
is like a breath of fresh air.

1070
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,440
This is another reason why I find Tommy's first version

1071
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,440
of the story more believable.

1072
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
Not only is it untainted by his later discovery

1073
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,440
how popular the sound was,

1074
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,440
it's also what the other person

1075
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,440
who worked on the game said,

1076
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,440
but this really makes it look like

1077
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
Tommy's stealing credit from someone else

1078
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,440
who worked for him now.

1079
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
It was just a hunch before,

1080
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
but now, I dunno.

1081
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,440
And here's when the fun, easy video

1082
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,440
about the Roblox oof I was trying to make ended

1083
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,440
and the horror of my new life began

1084
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,440
because while I was on Joey's page,

1085
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,440
I noticed something else.

1086
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,440
Design of all sound effects

1087
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,440
for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.

1088
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,440
This was very confusing to read

1089
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
because Tommy spent the last several decades

1090
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,440
saying he worked on Pro Skater.

1091
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,440
Tony Hawk Pro Skater.

1092
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,440
Tony Hawk Pro Skater.

1093
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,440
Tony Hawk Pro Skater.

1094
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,440
Uh, I was on the original

1095
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,440
Tony Hawk Pro Skater, uh, team.

1096
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,440
I was on the original Tony Hawk Pro Skater team.

1097
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,440
I'm not saying Tommy didn't work on it.

1098
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,440
It's just some places seem to disagree with him.

1099
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,440
Places like the credits of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.

1100
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,440
According to them,

1101
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,440
someone else did the in-game sound effects.

1102
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,440
I'll give you three guesses.

1103
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,440
It was, it was Joey. It was Joey.

1104
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,440
Although the company he was at is credited as well.

1105
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,440
It's like they're saying sound effects

1106
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,440
done by this guy from this company.

1107
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,440
But Tommy's acting like he personally did it again.

1108
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,440
I'm starting to feel a bit bad for Joey.

1109
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,440
Just to kind of add to the mystery,

1110
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,440
he talks about how small

1111
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,440
the development team was at the time.

1112
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,440
To kind of add to the exclusivity of it, I guess.

1113
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,440
You know, being a part of the original,

1114
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,440
uh, Tony Hawk Pro Skater team,

1115
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,440
you know, there's only about maybe 10 or 12 of us.

1116
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,440
This means very few people exist

1117
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,440
who could possibly contradict him.

1118
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
How convenient.

1119
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,440
It does make it even weirder though

1120
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,440
for such a small team to leave his name

1121
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,440
out of the credits.

1122
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,440
I guess Tommy could say his name is in there

1123
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,440
but only because his company is named

1124
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,440
Tommy Tallarico Studios.

1125
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,440
So who is responsible for the sounds in Pro Skater?

1126
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,440
The guy credited for it or his boss

1127
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,440
who says he did it now?

1128
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
In an older interview slash house tour,

1129
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,440
Tommy got a bit more specific.

1130
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,440
He said he'd buy skateboards.

1131
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,440
Oh, sorry.

1132
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,440
I mean we'd buy skateboards.

1133
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,440
We'd buy skateboards.

1134
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,440
And then Tommy would help

1135
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,440
this mysterious other person record the sounds.

1136
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,440
He says one of the pain sound effects,

1137
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,440
ironically also a kind of oof,

1138
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,440
is his actual voice.

1139
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,440
The actual sound in Tony Hawk

1140
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,440
that you hear when the guy falls off the skateboard

1141
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,440
and cracks his head open.

1142
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,440
Uh, pfft.

1143
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,440
Ugh.

1144
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,440
That's me falling off, cracking my head.

1145
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

1146
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,440
So Tommy might have helped with some of the sounds

1147
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,440
or at least at some point Joey recorded him

1148
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,440
falling off a skateboard.

1149
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,440
Strangely though, while he says he was

1150
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,440
on the Pro Skater team nowadays,

1151
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,440
at the time things were very different.

1152
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,440
You see, as I mentioned earlier,

1153
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,440
Tommy was on a TV show about games

1154
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,440
while Pro Skater was being made.

1155
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,440
The thing about journalism is it's usually frowned upon

1156
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,440
to cover or review a product you helped create

1157
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,440
without disclosing you worked on it

1158
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,440
and to his credit, Tommy's very good at this.

1159
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,440
When he and co-host Victor cover games

1160
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,440
he was involved with, they make sure to say it.

1161
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,440
Take Advent Rising,

1162
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,440
a game he composed a ton of music for.

1163
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,440
Advent Rising.

1164
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,440
I'm not gonna comment on any of the music

1165
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,440
in the game because I am completely biased.

1166
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,440
This is, and I mean this unironically,

1167
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,440
ethical gaming journalism.

1168
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,440
Also, you might have noticed,

1169
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,440
but Tommy kind of likes to brag about games he's worked on.

1170
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,440
One time they reviewed an Aladdin game

1171
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,440
and they brought up that Tommy worked on

1172
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,440
a different Aladdin games music eight years before.

1173
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,440
It was a great throwback to the 16-bit platformer days

1174
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,440
and I know you worked on the original Aladdin game

1175
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,440
so you must have felt like you were coming home.

1176
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,440
Deja vu!

1177
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,440
Yeah.

1178
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,440
Tommy not only understands disclosure,

1179
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,440
he loves doing it.

1180
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,440
If Tommy worked on a game

1181
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,440
or a game similar to the one being reviewed,

1182
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,440
you hear about it on this show.

1183
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,440
So what does it mean when Tommy doesn't say

1184
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,440
he worked on a game?

1185
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,440
While Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was being made,

1186
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,440
it was featured on the show.

1187
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,440
Tommy interviewed one of the developers.

1188
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,440
Later, when it came out, Tommy and Victor reviewed it

1189
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,440
and both gave it a 9.5 out of 10.

1190
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,440
If Tommy worked on this game's sound effects,

1191
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,440
he would have said so, wouldn't he?

1192
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,440
Well, he doesn't.

1193
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,440
At no point whatsoever in the coverage

1194
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,440
does Tommy disclose he worked on the game.

1195
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,440
Tommy behaves like a TV guy

1196
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,440
interviewing a game developer,

1197
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,440
which would be a bit weird if he was also

1198
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,440
on that development team, right?

1199
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,440
I can only think of a few reasons

1200
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,440
why Tommy wouldn't mention he worked on the game

1201
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,440
when he goes out of his way to do so normally.

1202
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,440
One is he randomly decided not to take credit

1203
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,440
for something which seems out of character

1204
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,440
and pretty dishonest considering how hard

1205
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,440
he promoted the game

1206
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,440
and he seems to know better than that.

1207
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,440
The alternative is,

1208
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,440
while he had helped Joey out a little,

1209
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,440
Tommy, at the time,

1210
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,440
didn't consider whatever input he gave

1211
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,440
big enough to justify telling people

1212
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,440
he was involved,

1213
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,440
which is fascinating to me.

1214
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,440
There is potentially a past version of Tommy

1215
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,440
who, if he honestly thought about it,

1216
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,440
would choose not to say he worked on Pro Skater,

1217
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,440
which is cool of him.

1218
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,440
However, then Pro Skater went on

1219
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,440
to be a really famous franchise

1220
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,440
and it became very cool to say you worked on it.

1221
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,440
I was on the original Tony Hawk Pro Skater team.

1222
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,440
And over the years,

1223
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,440
Tommy's story has grown a bit

1224
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,440
from helping with some of the sounds

1225
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,440
to, uh, doing all of them.

1226
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,440
I was on the original Tony Hawk Pro Skater team

1227
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,440
so I did all those, uh, sounds.

1228
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,440
I was audio director on that.

1229
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,440
Uh...

1230
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,440
Wait, now he's saying he was the audio director?

1231
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,440
He's not even in the credit!

1232
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,440
Let's quickly look at who did what

1233
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,440
on games Tallarico Studios worked on.

1234
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,440
On the vast majority,

1235
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,440
Tommy is often credited for music

1236
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,440
but he doesn't do sound effects much.

1237
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,440
Sound effects, or sound design as it was later called,

1238
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,440
is usually done by Joey.

1239
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,440
A game Tallarico Studios worked on

1240
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,440
almost always has music by Tommy,

1241
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,440
sound effects by Joey in the credits.

1242
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,440
Basically, when Tommy and Joey work on games together,

1243
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,440
it's pretty clear who did what.

1244
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,440
In fact, in the early 2000s,

1245
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,440
Tallarico Studios put out a sound effects library

1246
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,440
you could buy and use in your own projects

1247
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,440
with over 19,500 sound effects in it.

1248
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,440
Tommy's the executive producer

1249
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,440
so I'm sure he was involved in some capacity

1250
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,440
but three other recorders and editors are credited

1251
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,440
along with the sound designer.

1252
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,440
I wonder who it could be.

1253
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,440
It's Joey. It's always Joey.

1254
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,440
Joey credits himself as the lead sound designer

1255
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,440
at Tallarico Studios for 13 years.

1256
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,440
The thing he did was sound effects.

1257
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,440
Even on electric playground, Tommy's show,

1258
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,440
Joey is credited for additional sound effects

1259
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,440
so maybe Tommy didn't say he did the sound effects

1260
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,440
on Pro Skater because he knew Joey would see it.

1261
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,440
Given Tommy's tendency to take games

1262
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,440
his sound effects guy is credited for

1263
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,440
and say he did all the sounds,

1264
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,440
what does that sort of thing mean

1265
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,440
for his later claims about Messiah and Making the OOF?

1266
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,440
Well, wouldn't it be funny

1267
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,440
if Tommy also reviewed Messiah on TV

1268
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,440
and when he did, he again did not mention

1269
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,440
he worked on the game?

1270
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:23,440
Wouldn't that be very, very funny?

1271
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,440
Yeah, it is funny. That is what happened.

1272
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,440
Even funnier, on that same episode,

1273
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,440
they also reviewed the Dreamcast version of Pro Skater

1274
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,440
giving Tommy yet another opportunity

1275
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,440
to say he worked on it, which he didn't.

1276
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,440
There's starting to be a precedent

1277
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,440
for Joey doing things, being the one credited for it,

1278
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,440
Tommy reviewing it and not mentioning he worked on it,

1279
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,440
and then years later deciding he did.

1280
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,440
Coming back to how he talks on the stream,

1281
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,440
we could mean we both worked on this sound,

1282
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,440
but to be cynical, it can also mean

1283
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,440
Joey did it while working for me.

1284
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,440
Messiah is one of the two or so games

1285
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,440
I could find that Tallarico Studios made

1286
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,440
where they are both credited for the sound effects at once

1287
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,440
so potentially Tommy might have been more involved

1288
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,440
with the sound effects on this than normal.

1289
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,440
So our candidates are a guy who mostly did music

1290
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,440
and not sound effects, reviewed the game on television

1291
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,440
and chose not to say he worked on it,

1292
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,440
and when he later decided he did and he made this sound,

1293
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,440
carefully avoided taking credit for anything specific.

1294
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,440
Um...or the guy credited for sound effects

1295
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,440
on almost every other game who says he did it,

1296
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,440
who Tommy said did it before he changed his mind

1297
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,440
the first time, and whose name is on the file.

1298
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,440
In conclusion, who knows?

1299
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,440
Could have been either of them.

1300
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,440
Maybe it was both.

1301
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,440
Art is really a collaborative process.

1302
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,440
Okay, that was written as a joke

1303
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,440
about how heavily the deck is stacked here,

1304
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,440
but let's be serious.

1305
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,440
I haven't found any definitive proof here.

1306
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,440
I think it's interesting just how much Joey is credited

1307
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,440
for sound effects everywhere else,

1308
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,440
and I think it's weird that Tommy didn't really have

1309
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,440
any specifics to say about what he did on the sound,

1310
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,440
and I think if he did work on the game that closely,

1311
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,440
he should have said so when he reviewed

1312
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,440
the game on television,

1313
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,440
but none of that is specific proof

1314
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,440
of who recorded or mastered a specific sound effect.

1315
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,440
However, given all of this additional context

1316
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,440
and information, I can say at least for myself

1317
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,440
that I have some trouble believing Tommy

1318
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,440
when he says he made the sound,

1319
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,440
but when you decide something a well-known industry figure

1320
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,440
like him has said is suspect,

1321
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,440
you start to ask, well, what else has he said?

1322
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,440
This guy's been around for decades,

1323
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,440
and he's said a lot of things.

1324
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,440
I started investigating some of his other claims.

1325
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,440
I did it mostly to prove to myself

1326
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,440
I was just being silly so I could believe him

1327
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,440
when he said that he made the sound.

1328
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,440
I wanted to be able to put this to bed

1329
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,440
and move on with my life.

1330
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,440
I just couldn't accept that the first American

1331
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,440
to ever work on Sonic would lie like that.

1332
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,440
Hey, wait a second!

1333
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,440
♪♪

1334
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,440
Yes, Tommy has repeatedly said

1335
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,440
he's the first American to ever work on Sonic.

1336
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,440
In fact, I was the very first American

1337
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,440
to ever be hired by the Sonic team back in the day.

1338
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,440
Are you serious?

1339
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,440
Very first American.

1340
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,440
Yeah, very first American to be hired.

1341
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,440
One of the first Americans to ever be hired

1342
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,440
by Sega of Japan for the Sonic team.

1343
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,440
I was the first American to ever be hired

1344
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,440
to work on the Sonic the Hedgehog series.

1345
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,440
But if you don't take Tommy's word for it

1346
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,440
and do your own research,

1347
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,440
by which I mean basically Google Sonic for two seconds,

1348
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,440
you start to see red flags.

1349
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,440
Sonic was being developed in America as early as 1992

1350
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,440
when Sonic 2 was being made in California.

1351
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,440
Americans are all over Sonic's game development

1352
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,440
since almost the beginning.

1353
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,440
Which game did Tommy work on anyway?

1354
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,440
Sonic, uh, some of the, uh,

1355
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,440
or one of the Sonic games, Black Knight.

1356
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,440
That might have been in the 2000s.

1357
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,440
So Tommy was about 20 years late

1358
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,440
to the party of Americans working on Sonic.

1359
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,440
Okay, let's be charitable.

1360
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,440
Maybe he means first American to do music for the series?

1361
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,440
But if he thinks that,

1362
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,440
Tommy's been crushing too many 40s.

1363
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,440
That was terrible.

1364
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,440
I promise to live and learn from this.

1365
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,440
Oh, fu-

1366
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,440
But this first American stuff gets even deeper.

1367
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,440
There are layers to this shit.

1368
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,440
One particular American musician,

1369
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,440
Michael Jackson, was rumored for decades

1370
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,440
to have worked on Sonic 3.

1371
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,440
This was seemingly confirmed

1372
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,440
by Yuji Naka earlier this year, actually.

1373
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,440
This would make Jackson the first American

1374
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,440
to do a Sonic soundtrack.

1375
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,440
Maybe there are some Americans who worked on one earlier?

1376
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,440
I'm not sure.

1377
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,440
I'm not deep into Sonic lore.

1378
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,440
I'm no Heriton Splimby.

1379
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,440
Now, you could say, well, sure.

1380
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,440
Maybe that means Tommy is wrong

1381
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,440
about being the first American.

1382
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,440
But there's no way he could have known that.

1383
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,440
We only found out for sure recently.

1384
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,440
And yeah, to be fair, that would be true.

1385
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,440
Were it not for the fact Tommy has also been bragging

1386
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,440
about knowing back in the 90s that Jackson worked on Sonic.

1387
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,440
So I was really close with the, uh,

1388
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,440
the Sega folks back in the early 90s.

1389
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,440
I don't know if it was ever confirmed or not,

1390
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,440
but, uh, but I can tell you

1391
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,440
that he did do the music for Sonic 3.

1392
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,440
This was at a con in 2014

1393
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,440
before he started saying he was the first American.

1394
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,440
So either he knew he was lying when he started saying that

1395
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,440
or he made this shit up too.

1396
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,440
Which one is the lie?

1397
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,440
At this point, why not both?

1398
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,440
I don't trust this story about knowing

1399
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,440
about Jackson either, frankly.

1400
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,440
I think he just made up a story to seem involved

1401
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,440
with another important piece of history.

1402
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,440
That seems to be his M.O. at this point.

1403
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,440
This is just one example of what we could

1404
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,440
charitably call exaggeration,

1405
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,440
but realistically we call lies.

1406
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,440
The more I tried to check things Tommy said

1407
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,440
to prove to myself that any of it was true,

1408
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,440
the more it all came apart.

1409
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,440
Okay, so what about the Metroid Prime thing?

1410
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,440
He said in a bunch of places, including the OOF stream,

1411
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,440
that he worked on Metroid Prime.

1412
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,440
Uh, Metroid Prime with Shigeru Miyamoto,

1413
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,440
uh, worked on that for, uh, for a couple of years.

1414
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,440
And I worked with him on Metroid Prime,

1415
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,440
the first one, and we worked together for about,

1416
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,440
gosh, I wanna say four or five years.

1417
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,440
Metroid Prime, I worked with that

1418
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,440
with Shigeru Miyamoto for five years.

1419
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,440
I worked with Shigeru Miyamoto,

1420
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,440
the creator of Mario and Zelda,

1421
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,440
worked with him for five years on, uh, Metroid Prime.

1422
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,440
He doesn't just say he worked on it, actually.

1423
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:13,440
He says Shigeru Miyamoto was a personal huge fan of his work

1424
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,440
and always wanted to work on a game with him.

1425
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,440
We always talked about working together.

1426
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,440
Like, oh, man, I really love all your Mario stuff,

1427
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,440
and he'd say, oh, man, I love all your stuff that you do.

1428
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,440
Like, oh, we gotta work together sometime, you know?

1429
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,440
I don't know if that part of the story is true,

1430
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,440
but Tallarico Studios was contracted to work on Prime.

1431
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,440
Not music, by the way. Prime already had a composer.

1432
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,440
They just did sound effects.

1433
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,440
That might turn out to be important later.

1434
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,440
But early in development, Retro cancelled

1435
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,440
all their other projects to focus on Prime

1436
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,440
and suddenly didn't need outside help to get the audio done

1437
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,440
and his contract wasn't renewed.

1438
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,440
Tommy will confirm this part of the story himself.

1439
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,440
My contract was coming to an end

1440
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,440
was around the same time that Retro's projects

1441
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,440
were all getting cancelled except for Metroid,

1442
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,440
and they had an internal audio department.

1443
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,440
So he did work on it, briefly,

1444
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,440
but again with the exaggeration.

1445
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,440
For him to be dropped so easily implies Miyamoto

1446
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,440
wasn't as invested in working with Tommy as he says.

1447
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,440
Tommy doesn't just say he worked

1448
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,440
on Prime's sound effects for a bit

1449
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,440
and Miyamoto was a huge fan though.

1450
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,440
His story gets way more exotic.

1451
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,440
He tells people Miyamoto didn't give him

1452
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,440
any direction or visuals or animations

1453
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,440
to make sound effects to.

1454
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,440
He told him to just make what he thought was cool

1455
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,440
and the development team designed the weapons

1456
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,440
and animations around his sounds.

1457
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,440
Give us a bunch of epic weapon sounds

1458
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,440
and then what we're gonna do

1459
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,440
is I'm gonna give those to my artists

1460
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,440
and then they are gonna be inspired

1461
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,440
by the sounds that you make

1462
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,440
and we're gonna inspire the art and the thing.

1463
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,440
Wow, so cool.

1464
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,440
This is an unprecedented amount of control

1465
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,440
for an external audio contractor

1466
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,440
to have over a project.

1467
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,440
Plus it just doesn't mix very well with the fact

1468
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,440
he left really early in development.

1469
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,440
Did Miyamoto change his mind?

1470
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,440
Why didn't he make Retro keep him on board

1471
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,440
if he had such an important job?

1472
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,440
It also doesn't mix with other stories

1473
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,440
from Retro Studios' actual audio department.

1474
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,440
He did an interview for ShineSparkers

1475
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,440
where he told this story about Miyamoto

1476
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,440
letting him design the weapon sounds first.

1477
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,440
However, ShineSparkers then went on

1478
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,440
to interview Clark Wen, Prime's audio lead,

1479
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,440
who came on board after the other games

1480
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,440
were canceled and Tommy was gone.

1481
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,440
Wen is well-respected in the game audio industry.

1482
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,440
He's worked on a bunch of stuff,

1483
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,440
including Tony Hawk games, interestingly enough.

1484
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,440
According to him, they did sound effects

1485
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,440
the normal way, basing their work off the art

1486
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,440
and animations. There's something amazing

1487
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,440
about reading an interview with Tommy

1488
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,440
where he's blessed to the project

1489
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,440
with a radical new technique where the sound designer

1490
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,440
had massive creative control over the game

1491
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,440
and then going to the interview with Wen

1492
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,440
where they say, we interviewed Tommy

1493
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,440
and he said you did this and he goes,

1494
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,440
that sounds cool but no.

1495
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,440
Wen says one or two weapon sound effects

1496
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,440
were done when he got there and he left them

1497
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,440
mostly untouched, so a few of the sounds

1498
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,440
in the game are done by Tallarico Studios

1499
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,440
and they might have been done the way Tommy said

1500
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,440
but his overall involvement with the game

1501
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,440
was very small. How small?

1502
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,440
He left so early in development

1503
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,440
they forgot he had worked on it

1504
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,440
by the time the game was done and forgot

1505
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,440
to put his name in the credits.

1506
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,440
A bunch of other audio contractors made it in though.

1507
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,440
They must have kept contracting people

1508
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,440
after he left and not got him back.

1509
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,440
Weird. I wonder why. After seeing Tommy

1510
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,440
repeatedly take credit for the work

1511
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,440
of people under him, it's kind of cathartic

1512
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,440
seeing a bunch of other people get credited

1513
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,440
and for him to be forgotten.

1514
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,440
However, he's not the only one.

1515
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,440
Someone's missing from Tommy's version

1516
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,440
of the story again. Can you guess?

1517
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,440
In a now-deleted page on his website

1518
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,440
accessible via the Internet Archive,

1519
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,440
Tommy wrote about leaving early in development

1520
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,440
although he still claims he did a lot

1521
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,440
of the main sound design somehow.

1522
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,440
Funnily enough, he doesn't say

1523
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,440
I too much. He says we.

1524
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,440
I wonder who the other per-

1525
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,440
It's Joey! It's always Joey!

1526
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,440
He shared a recent email from Retro's

1527
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,440
new audio manager to prove he worked

1528
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,440
on it and he compliments the work

1529
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,440
Tallarico Studios did but he says

1530
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,440
it like this.

1531
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,440
My hat is off to you, Tommy and Joey!

1532
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,440
It's always Joey!

1533
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,440
What makes the story even funnier is how,

1534
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,440
you know, Tommy was on a TV show that reviewed

1535
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,440
games when Prime came out. Tommy didn't

1536
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,440
mention he worked on it, which makes sense.

1537
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,440
He was barely involved but one fascinating

1538
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,440
thing that hasn't come up yet is Tommy

1539
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,440
just has terrible taste.

1540
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,440
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure?

1541
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,440
The characters are incredibly stupid.

1542
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,440
He complained about Prime's backtracking

1543
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,440
and scanning system, stuff people

1544
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,440
love about the game, and absolutely refused

1545
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,440
to let Victor get a word in edgewise.

1546
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,440
I had to scan every little thing.

1547
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,440
There's a great story in there as well.

1548
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,440
And that's a problem for me. I enjoyed all of that.

1549
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,440
The worst problem about this game is that-

1550
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,440
He gave it a 7.5, which

1551
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,440
according to Metacritic would be the absolute

1552
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,440
lowest score any remotely professional

1553
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,440
critic gave it at the time.

1554
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,440
Even less than the 8 the guy who wrote the text

1555
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,440
reviews for EP gave it. Tommy was

1556
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,440
not the biggest fan of this game

1557
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,440
but now it's universally recognized as a

1558
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,440
masterpiece, he can't wait to tell you

1559
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,440
he was a huge part of it. It's kind of

1560
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,440
fascinating how these two supposed

1561
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,440
industry professionals each talk about

1562
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,440
their work. Joey doesn't mention Prime

1563
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,440
at all on his site. Presumably

1564
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,440
he doesn't consider his work a large enough part

1565
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,440
of the finished game to go on a resume.

1566
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,440
Meanwhile, Tommy talks like he worked

1567
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,440
hand-in-hand with Shigeru Miyamoto

1568
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,440
for five years on Metroid Prime.

1569
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,440
Oh, come on, H1. Be reasonable. He doesn't say

1570
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,440
it like that. No, he says it like that.

1571
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,440
I worked hand-in-hand with Shigeru

1572
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,440
Miyamoto for five years on Metroid

1573
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,440
Prime. But he said on his own

1574
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,440
website he left early. He left

1575
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,440
so early they forgot to put him in

1576
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,440
the credits. He knows he's not telling

1577
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,440
the truth when he says this. Okay, look,

1578
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,440
maybe I'm just a gaming racist

1579
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,440
but is it okay at this point to

1580
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,440
call this an obvious lie? It must

1581
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,440
be very difficult to work hand-in-hand

1582
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,440
with someone on a game they famously did

1583
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,440
not work on very much. Retro Studios

1584
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,440
is based in Texas. Miyamoto

1585
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,440
was a distant producer who occasionally

1586
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,440
gave notes. Several former

1587
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,440
retro employees have even suggested he

1588
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,440
gave Metroid to a new company in America

1589
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,440
that hadn't made any games yet because he didn't

1590
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,440
like Metroid that much. Some insinuating

1591
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,440
he didn't really get Metroid's

1592
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,440
type of gameplay. Miyamoto pawned off

1593
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,440
IPs like this repeatedly, actually.

1594
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,440
He visited Rare one day and made them turn

1595
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,440
a game they were making into a Star Fox game

1596
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,440
because he had no idea what else to do

1597
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,440
with Star Fox and we all know how that

1598
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,440
turned out. It's actually pretty good. People are

1599
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,440
just mean. Prime is great but it happened

1600
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,440
because Miyamoto outsourced an IP he didn't

1601
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,440
like to a bunch of Americans so he didn't

1602
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,440
have to think about it, which gives very different

1603
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,440
implications to Miyamoto asking

1604
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,440
Tommy to do the sound effects. So now

1605
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,440
almost every game he's bragged about working on

1606
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,440
has turned out to be a gross exaggeration.

1607
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,440
The only other games he talks about are

1608
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,440
Earthworm Jim and Aladdin. I guess

1609
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,440
there's one more. Uh, Guitar Hero.

1610
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,440
Guitar Hero. Guitar Hero,

1611
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,440
uh, franchise.

1612
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,440
Uh, did some work on

1613
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,440
some of the, uh, the first three

1614
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,440
Guitar Hero games? You know, like some

1615
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,440
of the games I've worked on. Disney's Aladdin,

1616
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,440
Earthworm Jim, Guitar Hero.

1617
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,440
Any of his songs on the soundtrack?

1618
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,440
Uh, no. Did he do sound effects?

1619
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,440
It doesn't look like it. Is he credited

1620
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,440
on any of the games? On one of them,

1621
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,440
yeah. According to a Joystick interview,

1622
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,440
rest in peace comrade, he helped them

1623
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,440
get an Aerosmith song on too because

1624
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,440
his cousin is Steven Tyler of Aerosmith.

1625
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,440
He's in the credits of Guitar Hero

1626
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,440
too in the industry thanks section.

1627
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,440
His involvement seems, I don't know,

1628
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,440
kind of small. It's mostly people who

1629
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,440
championed the first Guitar Hero when it came

1630
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,440
out. You know, game journalists and celebrities

1631
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,440
and Wil Wheaton. Interestingly,

1632
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,440
alongside Brad Shoemaker, Ryan Davis,

1633
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,440
and of course Jeff Gershman, also in these credits

1634
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,440
is Patrick Klepek who 15 years

1635
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,440
later would go on to make him delete a legal

1636
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,440
threat by asking him a basic question.

1637
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,440
This is the total extent I can find

1638
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,440
of Tommy's involvement with the Guitar Hero

1639
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,440
games, but I must be missing something.

1640
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,440
The way he brings it up, you'd think he was massively

1641
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,440
involved. I've worked on the Guitar Hero

1642
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,440
games, the first

1643
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,440
three, um,

1644
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,440
the third one was Guitar Hero Aerosmith.

1645
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,440
Um, now you know

1646
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,440
why. I want to assume Tommy was

1647
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,440
joking there, but at this point I

1648
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,440
don't know. The more you look at Tommy's weird

1649
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,440
exaggerations, overstatements

1650
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,440
of credit, his use of we to

1651
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,440
mean Joey, the more you see it.

1652
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,440
It starts to take over your mind.

1653
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,440
You start to ask yourself if even the stuff he couldn't

1654
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,440
possibly be lying about is a lie.

1655
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,440
Like, okay, are those

1656
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,440
Guinness World Records real?

1657
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,440
I assumed even if everything else was fake,

1658
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,440
they would be real at least. There's no way

1659
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,440
anyone could get away with such an obvious

1660
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,440
lie. It would be too easy to check, but it turns

1661
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,440
out if something is easy to check,

1662
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,440
no one actually does.

1663
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,440
["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"]

1664
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,440
["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"]

1665
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,440
["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"]

1666
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,440
["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"]

1667
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,440
Let's start with the big one. The person

1668
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,440
who has worked on the most video games in their

1669
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,440
lifetime.

1670
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,440
That's what he calls it, at least.

1671
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,440
I hold the Guinness world record for the

1672
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,440
person who's worked on the most video games in their

1673
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,440
life. My mother's very proud.

1674
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,440
The person who's worked on the most video

1675
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,440
games in their lifetime. My mother

1676
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,440
is very proud for the person who's worked on

1677
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,440
for the person who's worked on the most video games in their lifetime.

1678
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,440
So that was pretty cool. My mother's very

1679
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,440
proud for the person who's worked on

1680
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,440
the most video games in their

1681
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,440
lifetime, which is kinda, kinda crazy.

1682
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,440
Kind of a cool honor. My mother

1683
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,440
is very proud. The person who's worked

1684
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,440
on the most video games in their life.

1685
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,440
Yeah, my, uh...

1686
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:16,440
My mother is very proud.

1687
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,440
There's several problems

1688
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,440
with this one. Let's start with how the number

1689
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,440
of games he's worked on keeps expanding

1690
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,440
and not in the sexy way.

1691
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,440
By the time of his first Guinness world record in

1692
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,440
2008, he'd worked on the production of

1693
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,440
272 games. Around

1694
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,440
this time, he stopped doing music for games

1695
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,440
and started focusing on Video Games Live.

1696
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,440
Video Games Live takes up such a huge

1697
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,440
part of your time and your career,

1698
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,440
so have you ever considered going

1699
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,440
back to, like, full-time video game composing?

1700
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,440
No. There was this period

1701
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,440
in the early 2010s where the last game

1702
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,440
he'd officially worked on outside of

1703
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,440
Super Tofu Boy was Sonic and the Black Knight.

1704
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,440
The last game I composed for was

1705
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,440
actually a Sonic game, and that was a couple

1706
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,440
years ago, but yeah. But somehow, two years

1707
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,440
later, he had a record with over 300

1708
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,440
games on it. In October 2017,

1709
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,440
he said he'd worked on over 300 games.

1710
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,440
In fact, I have a Guinness world record

1711
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,440
for the person who's worked on the most video

1712
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,440
games in their lifetime. Over 300 games.

1713
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,440
But by the time of the OOF stream in January

1714
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,440
2020, just over two

1715
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,440
years later, it was over 350.

1716
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,440
And, uh, I've worked on

1717
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,440
over 350

1718
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,440
video games. He had a busy

1719
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,440
couple of years there. I read today

1720
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,440
300 video

1721
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,440
games you've had your hands in.

1722
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,440
That can't be a real number. That's actually

1723
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,440
350. Yeah, it's up to

1724
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,440
350 now. That I know a lot

1725
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,440
of people in the industry.

1726
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,440
I've worked on 200, uh, 350

1727
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,440
games in my career. Okay, Tommy

1728
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,440
seems a little confused himself how many

1729
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,440
he's done, so, you know, just for his

1730
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,440
sake, we should probably double check how

1731
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,440
many. So, uh,

1732
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,440
is there a list somewhere? His Wikipedia

1733
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,440
page lists far less games than

1734
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,440
he says he's worked on. Fewer.

1735
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,440
God damn it. I used Wikipedia for that visual

1736
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,440
earlier showing the games he'd worked on in the early

1737
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,440
2010s. Let's show everything else he did

1738
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,440
afterwards. Nothing. He cameoed

1739
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,440
in Retro City Rampage and that's it according

1740
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,440
to Wikipedia. His IMDB splits

1741
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,440
his credits into a dozen different

1742
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,440
categories but not games, television

1743
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,440
and movies because it's a horrible website,

1744
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,440
and the composer and sound department credits have

1745
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,440
a bunch of games repeated in both.

1746
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,440
Wow.

1747
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,440
He's credited for some of them three times.

1748
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:20,440
Even Messiah's in there twice.

1749
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,440
Earthworm Jim 2's in there

1750
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,440
four times? But even adding literally

1751
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,440
all the video game credits together

1752
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,440
including all the duplicates, you get

1753
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,440
less than half the number he said he'd done

1754
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,440
15 years ago. What

1755
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,440
the fuck is happening? His Moby Games page

1756
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,440
lists about 100? Uh,

1757
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,440
it's 6.13 AM right now

1758
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,440
and my eyes went a bit blurry while I was counting.

1759
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,440
It could be like 98. Either way,

1760
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,440
it's a lot less than 350 and I'm not

1761
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,440
recounting this shit. And that's counting a bunch

1762
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,440
he's just in the thanks for like Guitar Hero 2.

1763
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,440
He doesn't list Pro Skater because

1764
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,440
he's not in the credits for that even though Moby

1765
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,440
Games appear to have copy-pasted the official

1766
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,440
biography from his website which claims he

1767
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,440
did. They somehow managed to get Pro Skater

1768
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,440
to link to the correct game page

1769
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,440
but not to get the spelling right.

1770
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,440
Okay, none of these websites can be trusted.

1771
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,440
Thankfully, Tommy has taken it upon himself

1772
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:08,440
to make his own list of games on his website.

1773
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,440
This list is larger and I mean

1774
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,440
a lot larger than the others

1775
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,440
and since Tommy wrote it, there's some

1776
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,440
dubious names on here. Pro Skater

1777
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,440
and Guitar Hero are on there and so is Metroid

1778
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,440
Prime. Obviously, he personally held

1779
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,440
hands with the development team while they made it

1780
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,440
but so is Prime 2, a game I've never

1781
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,440
seen any mention of him touching anyone's

1782
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,440
hands on. Did they reuse some sounds

1783
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,440
him slash Joey made?

1784
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,440
So that counts as working on both?

1785
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,440
And I guess I can now add Roblox

1786
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,440
to that list of games.

1787
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,440
If Tommy thinks he can put Roblox

1788
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,440
on the list of games he has worked

1789
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,440
on...

1790
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,440
imagine what justifications other

1791
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,440
games are on this list for. One of Tommy's

1792
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,440
actually interesting contributions to game

1793
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,440
history is early PlayStation 1

1794
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,440
models came with a demo disc to show what the

1795
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,440
console could do and some of his music

1796
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,440
is in the menus and titles. The first

1797
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,440
sounds ever made by some early

1798
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,440
PlayStations would be music made by Tommy.

1799
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,440
This is kind of neat and cool

1800
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,440
and it's also weird seeing

1801
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,440
PlayStation demo disc in a list

1802
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,440
of games composed for. In general,

1803
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,440
this list has quite a bit of what we

1804
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,440
call padding. Tallarico Studios

1805
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,440
did additional music for the first

1806
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,440
Blood Rain so that's one game

1807
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,440
worked on, right? Well, it's on Tommy's list

1808
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,440
five times as each console version

1809
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,440
along with PC and Mac.

1810
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:24,440
I'm not sure why you'd wanna give Blood Rain such a

1811
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,440
strong presence on your resume but

1812
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:28,440
each to their own. He also did the music for

1813
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,440
Earthworm Jim 1 and 2.

1814
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,440
An Earthworm Jim game is on his list

1815
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,440
18 times!

1816
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,440
Super Tofu Boy, a free Flash game

1817
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,440
Peter made he donated music to

1818
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,440
is on here twice! You can run

1819
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,440
Flash games on the Mac too? Wow,

1820
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,440
that's an extra game worked on.

1821
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,440
Fuck you, Tommy! But even counting

1822
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,440
all of this, all the games he wasn't credited

1823
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,440
for but still puts on his list,

1824
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,440
the multiple times the same game is counted

1825
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,440
across many different consoles or

1826
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,440
computers or demo discs

1827
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,440
as specific games worked on,

1828
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,440
it's still a lot less than

1829
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,440
the number he says. If you decide

1830
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,440
to be a bit mean and remove all the repeat

1831
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,440
games, you get around 175.

1832
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,440
Almost 100 less than his

1833
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,440
first Guinness World Record said

1834
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,440
15 years ago. So either

1835
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,440
he stopped updating his website and

1836
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,440
IMDB, MobyGames, Wikipedia

1837
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,440
and everywhere else also stopped tracking

1838
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,440
the games he worked on or

1839
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,440
Bob, forgive me, the first American

1840
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,440
to ever work on Sonic is

1841
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,440
exaggerating again. In an interview in 2010,

1842
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,440
he said he worked on

1843
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,440
280 video games, which is a Guinness

1844
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:32,440
World Record. Actually inside

1845
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,440
the Guinness Book as the person who worked

1846
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,440
on the most video games in their life.

1847
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:38,440
This sentence almost

1848
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,440
made me cut my fucking head off.

1849
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,440
Tommy isn't actually inside

1850
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,440
the Guinness Book of World Records he's talking about

1851
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,440
here. Trust me, I checked.

1852
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,440
He is, however, inside that year's

1853
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,440
Guinness Book of World Records

1854
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,440
Gamer's Edition. The Gamer's Edition

1855
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,440
is full of more game-centric records.

1856
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,440
Notice that it's also much smaller

1857
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,440
and the print quality is much worse and

1858
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,440
generally it's a lot less prestigious than being in

1859
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,440
the actual book. My producer,

1860
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,440
Kat, left a comment on that line in the

1861
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,440
script saying, it's a bit like saying you gave a

1862
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,440
TED talk when really you just gave a TEDx

1863
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,440
talk, not realizing how fucking

1864
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,440
funny she was being because

1865
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,440
Tommy has done a TEDx talk.

1866
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,440
My mother's very proud. When his biography

1867
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,440
on his website calls it a TED

1868
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,440
talk. He is exactly that guy.

1869
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,440
She is so cool. I

1870
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,440
love her. Tommy is at least featured

1871
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,440
in the Gamer's Edition. It's a two-page interview

1872
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,440
about his career and video games live.

1873
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,440
At the beginning of the interview, the author

1874
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,440
claims Tommy has worked on more

1875
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,440
game soundtracks than anyone else.

1876
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,440
They don't say how they verified this

1877
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:38,440
or provide the list of games.

1878
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,440
It seems a bit like Tommy just told

1879
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,440
the interviewer this in the interview

1880
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,440
and they repeated it as a factoid assuming

1881
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,440
it was true because why would

1882
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,440
someone tell such an obvious lie?

1883
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,440
Whatever evidence he has backing up his claim

1884
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,440
is becoming difficult to find. Luckily

1885
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,440
this wasn't too expensive on eBay.

1886
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,440
Uh, supplies are quite low but

1887
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,440
the demand...it's just me

1888
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,440
basically. I mentioned how surprisingly cheap these

1889
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,440
were to Mandalore Gaming and he started bulk

1890
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,440
buying them to leave in Airbnbs he

1891
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,440
stays in, like a sort of gamer-dian

1892
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,440
Bible. So if they seem

1893
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:10,440
more expensive now it's because he's artificially

1894
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,440
inflated the price. Speaking of

1895
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,440
artificial inflation, even if the amount

1896
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,440
of games Tommy says he's worked on

1897
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,440
was completely true, there are

1898
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:20,440
still people who've worked on way more games.

1899
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:22,440
The record is just wrong.

1900
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,440
Even Guinness at some point recognized

1901
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:26,440
this. They actually changed the

1902
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,440
wording of the record at some point after

1903
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,440
he first got it. It's not person who

1904
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,440
has worked on the most games in a lifetime

1905
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,440
anymore. It's most prolific

1906
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,440
composer of game soundtracks.

1907
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,440
The Guinness website says that now and

1908
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:40,440
the updated versions of Tommy's plaque

1909
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,440
say that too. So Guinness have done their

1910
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,440
best to correct this mistake.

1911
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,440
Tommy, however, has continued using the original

1912
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,440
name anyway for over a decade.

1913
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,440
In fact, I own the Guinness

1914
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:52,440
world record for the person who's worked on

1915
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:54,440
the most video games in their lifetime.

1916
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,440
My mother's very proud.

1917
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,440
Another one of those sweet little lies we've

1918
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,440
become accustomed to Tommy using.

1919
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,440
Although I can kind of understand this one

1920
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,440
because the new name is even more

1921
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,440
obviously a lie. I know for a fact

1922
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,440
Tommy has not made 280

1923
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:10,440
video game soundtracks.

1924
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,440
We need to acknowledge just how bonkers this clip is.

1925
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,440
He's saying most video games in a

1926
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,440
lifetime while showing footage of

1927
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:18,440
the new record with a different name.

1928
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,440
Bonus points for the fact the record says more

1929
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,440
than 300 games but then it cuts to

1930
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,440
a list he wrote with less than 300

1931
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,440
games on it. And just in case it needs to

1932
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,440
be said, no, Guinness are not a real record

1933
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:30,440
keeping organization. They're a novelty

1934
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,440
book company. It's already a pretty

1935
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,440
common joke that most of their records

1936
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,440
are just silly stuff someone made up so

1937
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,440
they can have a record. Like,

1938
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,440
most baseball bats broken

1939
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,440
in one minute. That's a silly one

1940
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:44,440
I just made up now. Just kidding. It's real.

1941
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,440
I don't really mind if Guinness track a bunch of

1942
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:48,440
silly records. It's just a

1943
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,440
bit of fun really, but they are an utterly

1944
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,440
for-profit organization.

1945
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:54,440
Not just in terms of sales of books

1946
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,440
but also sales of records.

1947
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,440
Guinness has an entire subsection on their

1948
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,440
website dedicated to business marketing

1949
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,440
solutions, promising they can help with

1950
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:04,440
PR and marketing campaigns, complete

1951
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,440
with a case studies section showing over a

1952
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:08,440
dozen pages of companies they got attention

1953
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,440
for by helping them come up with a new record

1954
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,440
to break, like Canon with its

1955
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:14,440
longest digitally printed photograph.

1956
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,440
If you have the money, you can pay them

1957
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,440
to help you break a record. I have my

1958
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,440
suspicions a lot of the silly record holders

1959
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,440
are independently wealthy people. You know,

1960
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,440
some people just want a record to call their own

1961
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,440
to give their empty lives a sense

1962
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,440
of meaning. Guinness aren't purposefully keeping

1963
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,440
track of who's broken the most bats

1964
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,440
or wasted the most money on a Pokemon

1965
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:34,440
card. Having a Guinness adjudicator

1966
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,440
on site to verify and give out the

1967
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,440
award on the day is super expensive.

1968
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,440
At minimum, $10,000

1969
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,440
plus transport and hotel costs.

1970
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,440
This stuff gets expensive fast.

1971
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,440
They aren't a neutral party tracking human

1972
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,440
achievements. They are a paid service

1973
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,440
and many of their record holders are basically

1974
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,440
just customers. You'll notice

1975
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,440
that when it became clear someone else

1976
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,440
should have the record for most games made in a

1977
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,440
lifetime, they didn't give someone else

1978
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,440
the record. They changed it to one

1979
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:02,440
Tommy was more likely to have. I'm

1980
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,440
curious how much they charge for this service.

1981
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,440
Guinness' record search function claims

1982
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,440
Tommy is involved with two more. These are

1983
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:10,440
for video games live. What great marketing

1984
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,440
these must have been. They are most video

1985
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,440
game concerts performed and

1986
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,440
largest audience for a live video game

1987
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,440
music concert. Let's quickly appreciate

1988
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,440
how sneaky these records are.

1989
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,440
VGL haven't come close to

1990
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,440
performing the most concerts, but

1991
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,440
for most video game concerts,

1992
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,440
now that's a record, and it's highly

1993
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,440
specific so no one can challenge it.

1994
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,440
In fact, you literally can't challenge it.

1995
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:34,440
The Guinness website says these records are not

1996
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,440
accepting active submissions. This is

1997
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,440
a special record only Tommy

1998
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:40,440
can get. And wouldn't you believe it?

1999
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,440
At his 357th concert, one of

2000
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:44,440
those prohibitively expensive adjudicators

2001
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,440
turned up to hand him the latest version

2002
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,440
of these two records, but let's look

2003
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,440
closer at largest audience for a live

2004
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,440
video game music concert for a second.

2005
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,440
Uh, the biggest symphony show

2006
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,440
ever seen live. Over

2007
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:58,440
752,000

2008
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,440
people watching us

2009
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,440
live in Beijing, China. This

2010
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:04,440
would be pretty impressive.

2011
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,440
Would you be shocked

2012
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:08,440
if I told you Tommy's story is inaccurate?

2013
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:10,440
Not all of those 752,000

2014
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,440
people were watching in person

2015
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:14,440
in Beijing. Some of them were watching it

2016
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:16,440
digitally on a live stream on a Chinese

2017
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,440
video website. Biggest symphony show

2018
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,440
ever seen live. 752,000

2019
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,440
people

2020
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,440
watching me live on stage.

2021
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,440
That was in Beijing. It's a bit deceptive

2022
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:28,440
to say they were watching you live

2023
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,440
on stage when they were nowhere

2024
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,440
near the stage. How many people were actually

2025
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:34,440
there? Uh, the famous

2026
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,440
um, uh,

2027
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,440
Bird's Nest National Olympic Stadium.

2028
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,440
We played there. 130,000 people

2029
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,440
inside. 600,000

2030
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,440
people outside. I love that he says

2031
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,440
outside when he means we're watching

2032
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,440
a live stream. Like, is he trying to imply

2033
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,440
that hundreds of thousands of people stood

2034
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,440
outside just to hear his show?

2035
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,440
But 100K people attending a concert

2036
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:56,440
is still a lot.

2037
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,440
Still alive-o! You know, I couldn't help

2038
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,440
but overhear what venue he said

2039
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,440
this took place at. Bird's Nest

2040
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,440
National Olympic Stadium. The Bird's Nest is

2041
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,440
a beautiful stadium, and it must be amazing

2042
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,440
to play in front of 130,000

2043
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:10,440
people there. In case you're not familiar

2044
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,440
with the Bird's Nest, allow me to read you

2045
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,440
the beginning of its Wikipedia page.

2046
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,440
You're an hour deep into a video about the Roblox oof.

2047
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,440
I don't have anything better to do.

2048
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,440
The National Stadium, also known as the Bird's Nest,

2049
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,440
is an 80,000 capacity

2050
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,440
stadium in Beijing.

2051
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,440
I think I might have noticed

2052
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,440
a very small discrepancy.

2053
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,440
During the 2008 Olympics, it hit its record

2054
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,440
attendance of 89,000 people.

2055
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,440
Tommy is claiming he got better

2056
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,440
attendance than the Olympics and can

2057
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,440
fold space, but because it's Tommy,

2058
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:40,440
there are layers of mistruth happening here.

2059
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:42,440
You see, Tommy has the name of the venue

2060
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:44,440
wrong. Guinness has an article about

2061
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:46,440
his record, and they say it was set at the

2062
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,440
Beijing Exhibition Theater, which is a

2063
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,440
different place. At first, I thought this

2064
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,440
was just a one-off mistake. VGL

2065
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,440
have played both venues, but the thing

2066
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,440
is, though, he always says it's the

2067
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,440
Bird's Nest. Uh, there was the Bird's Nest

2068
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:00,440
in China, Beijing National

2069
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,440
Olympic Stadium, 750,000

2070
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:04,440
people. Now, maybe he just has

2071
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,440
the names really mixed up in his head. They are

2072
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:08,440
both in Beijing, after all, although it is

2073
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,440
a bit weird to forget where you set

2074
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,440
your Guinness world record, but whatever.

2075
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,440
But is there maybe a reason he

2076
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,440
says the name of this theater while claiming

2077
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,440
he played to hundreds of thousands of people?

2078
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,440
Well, there's one.

2079
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,440
It would be even more impossible to play to

2080
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:24,440
130,000 people at a theater

2081
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:26,440
with only 2,700 seats.

2082
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,440
The Guinness article also

2083
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,440
happens to mention the actual number

2084
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,440
of people physically at the concert.

2085
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,440
2,086 people.

2086
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,440
So even when Guinness has the numbers,

2087
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,440
he still makes shit up.

2088
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,440
Tommy, anyone can check this.

2089
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,440
What are you doing? I don't trust that many

2090
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,440
people were watching the live stream either.

2091
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,440
There's no easily obtainable record of the live

2092
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,440
viewership from the Chinese streaming platform

2093
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:50,440
this appeared on, so we, and apparently

2094
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:52,440
also Guinness, just have to take Tommy's

2095
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,440
word for it that almost exactly 750,000

2096
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,440
people watched this live.

2097
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,440
And considering we just caught him

2098
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,440
lying about this exact thing,

2099
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:02,440
I have my doubts. Even though

2100
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,440
he has a record with a specific

2101
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,440
number written on it,

2102
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,440
the number keeps changing. In an interview

2103
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,440
in the 2017 Guinness Book

2104
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,440
of World Records, the gamers edition

2105
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,440
of course, he directly claims over

2106
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,440
a million people saw that show live.

2107
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,440
I cannot stress this enough.

2108
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,440
He is literally lying

2109
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,440
to Guinness

2110
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,440
about a record Guinness just

2111
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:28,440
gave him.

2112
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,440
I just can't fucking believe

2113
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:32,440
it.

2114
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,440
I can't fucking

2115
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,440
believe it. That's all three

2116
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,440
of the records Guinness appears to have on file

2117
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,440
for Tommy Tallarico. Tommy seems

2118
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,440
to know better though. His list of awards

2119
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:44,440
on his website says he has four,

2120
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,440
the fourth one being most video

2121
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,440
game concerts in a year, a record

2122
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,440
I cannot find anywhere other than

2123
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:52,440
his list of awards and other interviews

2124
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,440
with Tommy, so I don't know. Maybe

2125
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,440
he has four. Well, his biography says

2126
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,440
he currently holds five, so I don't know.

2127
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:00,440
The numbers just keep going up.

2128
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:02,440
Can he at least get the record straight

2129
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:04,440
on the number of records?

2130
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:06,440
Okay, to be fair, he has recently

2131
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,440
updated it. Lately, he started

2132
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,440
saying he has...

2133
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,440
seven.

2134
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,440
Um, I have seven. Seven Guinness world

2135
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,440
records for different things.

2136
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,440
So what are all the others? You know, for a guy

2137
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,440
who, let's be frank, fucking

2138
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,440
loves bragging about all the shit he's done...

2139
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,440
I've worked with everybody.

2140
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:26,440
I was the first American...

2141
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:28,440
Tommy is uncharacteristically modest about

2142
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,440
saying what these other four records are.

2143
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,440
In a Reddit AMA a few years back,

2144
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,440
he said he has seven, but just to avoid

2145
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:36,440
wasting people's time, he only listed three of them.

2146
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,440
Would you like to guess which three?

2147
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,440
When someone directly asks him to list

2148
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,440
the records, he sheepishly adds

2149
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,440
most game concerts in a year, but that's it.

2150
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:46,440
The others are like ghosts.

2151
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,440
Tommy, how many Guinness world

2152
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:50,440
records do you have?

2153
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,440
Um, that's... so I have seven.

2154
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,440
Um...

2155
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:56,440
one of the ones I have is

2156
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,440
the most symphony

2157
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,440
shows in a

2158
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:02,440
single year, but I would say there's

2159
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,440
three big ones. The three big ones are

2160
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,440
most shows,

2161
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:08,440
biggest live show ever

2162
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,440
seen, and then the, um,

2163
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,440
the most video games. So I have

2164
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,440
a total of seven, but there's three big ones.

2165
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:16,440
He doesn't even have a riddle prepared for this one.

2166
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,440
He just refuses to tell people.

2167
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,440
He's so shy all of a sudden.

2168
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,440
Luckily for us in Tommy's investor

2169
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,440
videos for the Amico, we can see at least

2170
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,440
five of them, so let's just take a look and find

2171
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:28,440
out for ourselves. In the center we have

2172
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,440
most prolific composer of soundtracks.

2173
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,440
Okay, can't verify he's done that many

2174
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:34,440
games, but we at least know that one. The two either

2175
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,440
sides say most video game concerts

2176
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,440
and largest audience. Those are the three we

2177
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:40,440
know he has. Now for the mystery ones.

2178
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,440
To the right we have the record

2179
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:44,440
for the most video game concerts perfo...

2180
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,440
This is the same record.

2181
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,440
This is the previous version. This one's from 2014

2182
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:50,440
with 293 shows.

2183
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,440
What about the one on the left? The longest

2184
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:54,440
video game concert video

2185
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,440
games live which has performed 260...

2186
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,440
These are the same three records!

2187
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,440
It's starting to look like there's a good reason

2188
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,440
the other four records don't get mentioned much.

2189
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,440
In one house tour he gave in 2017

2190
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,440
he has them all laid out on the floor

2191
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,440
where they appear to have sat for five years now.

2192
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,440
Look at that dust bunny. And Tommy calls them

2193
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:12,440
seven different Guinness World Records.

2194
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,440
There's seven of them.

2195
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,440
Uh, seven different Guinness World Records,

2196
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,440
so... I'm not sure how these can be

2197
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:20,440
seven different records if when you pause

2198
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,440
the video and look, several of them are the same

2199
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,440
and I think when people get too up close

2200
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,440
and personal with his records they start

2201
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,440
to notice this too. In this clip

2202
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,440
he talks about two of them, ones we know,

2203
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,440
and then this weird cut happens.

2204
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,440
That was the first one. That was the first one. Yep.

2205
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,440
And then, uh, and then the... for the shows

2206
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,440
and then the... Where is he?

2207
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,440
I didn't edit that in, I swear.

2208
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,440
I'd love to know what happened between

2209
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:44,440
these two clips. Here's yet another

2210
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,440
fun fact. Guinness charges separately

2211
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,440
for the award certificate and the plaque it

2212
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:50,440
comes in. They have a unique design they don't

2213
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:52,440
change very often and they're pretty expensive.

2214
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,440
When Tommy got these two in 2014

2215
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,440
it looks like he just bought two picture

2216
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,440
frames from a store. I guess when you

2217
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,440
have so many versions of the same record

2218
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:02,440
already you get sick of paying full price

2219
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,440
for them. I'm not just bringing this up

2220
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,440
to make fun of him, although I am, but it's

2221
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:08,440
actually really useful data. You know how

2222
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:10,440
I mentioned Guinness renamed his most

2223
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:12,440
games record? In this one tour with the

2224
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,440
Super Awkward Edit, another funny thing

2225
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:16,440
happens. Tommy reads out that record,

2226
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:18,440
right? This is, uh, the Guinness

2227
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:20,440
World Record for the person who's worked on the

2228
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:22,440
most video games in a lifetime.

2229
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,440
Wow. But because he got a

2230
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:26,440
shitty frame for this one, we can

2231
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,440
check and see the record

2232
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,440
he's reading from says something else.

2233
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,440
For the person who's worked on the most

2234
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,440
video games in a lifetime. Wow.

2235
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,440
Tommy refuses to acknowledge

2236
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:38,440
the new title and pretends it has

2237
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,440
the old wrong name because it's a

2238
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,440
bit more prestigious. He's lying

2239
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,440
about the text of a record he is

2240
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,440
literally holding in his hands and

2241
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:48,440
pretending to read from. This guy's

2242
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,440
a fucking genius. How has he

2243
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,440
never been caught? I feel like I'm going

2244
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:54,440
crazy. You know how the concert records

2245
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,440
say video game concerts?

2246
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:58,440
If you've been paying attention, you'll notice Tommy

2247
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,440
always says it's for symphony concerts

2248
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:02,440
or symphonic concerts.

2249
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:04,440
Biggest symphony show ever seen live.

2250
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,440
The most symphony shows ever

2251
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,440
done. Uh, the biggest symphony

2252
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,440
show ever seen live.

2253
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,440
Biggest symphony show ever seen live.

2254
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,440
Tommy knows his video game concert

2255
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:16,440
record is extremely stupid and out

2256
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,440
of embarrassment he calls it something else.

2257
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,440
Oh, maybe it's not deliberate. Maybe he just got the

2258
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,440
name wrong. No, I can prove it. Here's a time

2259
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,440
he does that while pointing at it and

2260
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,440
pretending to read it. Here's one.

2261
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:28,440
Largest audience. Largest audience

2262
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,440
ever to see a

2263
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:32,440
symphonic concert live.

2264
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:34,440
752,000 people.

2265
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:36,440
We can see what the record says in the

2266
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,440
previous shot, Tommy. Okay, let's wrap this up.

2267
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:40,440
How many records does

2268
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,440
Tommy have? Through a list of games

2269
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:44,440
that cannot be found but keeps exploding

2270
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,440
and by making up new definitions of

2271
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,440
concert, it looks like Tommy has about

2272
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:50,440
three but he owns seven plaques of them

2273
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:52,440
so he tells people he has seven

2274
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,440
different Guinness World Records and

2275
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,440
maybe he does have a most video game

2276
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,440
concerts in a year one and it's just

2277
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:00,440
never visible in shots of his records.

2278
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,440
Guinness only has three records in their search

2279
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,440
though. Well, had.

2280
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,440
Um, I was gonna move on from Guinness

2281
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:08,440
at this point but then there was a new development

2282
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:10,440
in the search for Tommy's list of games.

2283
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,440
After looking everywhere for the list

2284
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,440
of 350 plus games

2285
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:16,440
Tommy supposedly worked on or I guess

2286
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:18,440
composed for now, we realized

2287
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,440
there was one place that would definitely

2288
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,440
have one. Guinness themselves.

2289
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:24,440
So, we emailed them

2290
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,440
and by we I mean Kat did it

2291
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:28,440
for me, she did all the work.

2292
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,440
That's what people mean when they say we.

2293
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:32,440
They mean someone else did it for me.

2294
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:34,440
We worked on the oof sound. Yeah, right.

2295
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:36,440
I know this trick, Tommy. We,

2296
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,440
Kat, asked them what evidence was

2297
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:40,440
provided for the record and how it was verified.

2298
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,440
Guinness were really polite and got back

2299
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,440
to us very quickly. Here was their response.

2300
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:46,440
The record title in question is one of our

2301
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,440
consultant records which are not

2302
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,440
open to standard applications.

2303
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:52,440
They are confirmed by specialist consultants

2304
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,440
that we approve.

2305
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,440
Our expert external consultants that

2306
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,440
we use for records of this kind often have

2307
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,440
professional links to the field in question,

2308
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:02,440
i.e. video games.

2309
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:04,440
These titles are research based rather than

2310
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:06,440
evidence based. Thanks.

2311
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,440
First off, this email provides me the incredible

2312
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:10,440
quote that the record is not evidence

2313
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,440
based, which is just fantastic.

2314
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,440
Thank you very much for that. This is one of the

2315
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:16,440
situations where if you did the research,

2316
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,440
you would have the evidence. This doesn't

2317
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,440
require specialist consultation.

2318
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:22,440
It's a list of games. On top of that,

2319
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:24,440
this implies Guinness have never seen a list

2320
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,440
either. The record was verified

2321
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:28,440
by a consultant, so someone

2322
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,440
somewhere says

2323
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:32,440
Tommy has worked on this many games

2324
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:34,440
and Guinness believes them.

2325
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:36,440
But then, something even

2326
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:38,440
stranger happened. Previously, when

2327
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:40,440
you typed Tommy's name into Guinness' record

2328
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:42,440
search, that record came up.

2329
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,440
One of the other VGL records came up because

2330
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:46,440
he's mentioned by name on that record. The other

2331
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:48,440
one doesn't. So those are the ones that came up.

2332
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:50,440
This is a screenshot I took in

2333
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:52,440
early September. Anyway,

2334
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,440
after we emailed them asking how they verified

2335
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:56,440
it, I realized I needed to take another

2336
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,440
screenshot because I'd scribbled all over one of them,

2337
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,440
so I went back

2338
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:02,440
and the record didn't come up.

2339
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:04,440
Just the other one did.

2340
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:06,440
Right after we emailed them asking

2341
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:08,440
them where their evidence was

2342
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:10,440
and they said they didn't have it,

2343
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,440
the record disappeared.

2344
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:14,440
Did we...did we

2345
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,440
just get one of Tommy's records deleted?

2346
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,440
Oh, no!

2347
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,440
I didn't mean to do this.

2348
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:22,440
I just wanted to see a list of games.

2349
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:24,440
Tommy, if you're watching this, it wasn't me.

2350
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:26,440
It was Cat. Please don't...

2351
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:30,440
So now the brakes have come off and this video

2352
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:32,440
is spiraling out of my control.

2353
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,440
We've lost all hope of figuring out

2354
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,440
what Tommy is doing or why.

2355
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:38,440
Doing the early research before

2356
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:40,440
this all happened, it got kind of

2357
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:42,440
nostalgic going back and re-watching ancient

2358
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:44,440
episodes of Electric Playground and

2359
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:46,440
reviews on the run and watching Tommy do his

2360
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,440
wacky boobery and yell at Victor when

2361
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,440
he says normal things like,

2362
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,440
Metroid Prime is fun. I was trying to remember

2363
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,440
if I ever found Tommy funny or if I

2364
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:56,440
was always just laughing at him,

2365
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:57,440
you know?

2366
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,440
You know what I gotta say to you?

2367
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,440
I don't care what you think!

2368
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,440
After doing that level of research,

2369
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,440
I fell back into an ancient drama I saw

2370
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,440
unfold as a kid and completely forgot about.

2371
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,440
Tommy's awful opinions used to be a running joke

2372
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,440
on forums discussing his show's reviews.

2373
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,440
People would bring up he gave Smash Bros. Melee,

2374
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,440
one of the most beloved games in human history,

2375
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,440
a 2.5 out of 10.

2376
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,440
It was a huge running joke.

2377
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,440
I learned about this because I was a pretty big

2378
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,440
Mega64 fan as a teenager and they shot some videos

2379
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,440
at his house and even did an episode

2380
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:27,440
of their podcast there. I remember watching this

2381
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,440
on my iPod Nano on the bus.

2382
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,440
This was shot just as Smash Bros. Brawl

2383
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,440
had come out and the gang made fun of his

2384
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,440
old review as well.

2385
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:01,440
Tommy is pointing to the giant model dinosaur

2386
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,440
he has in his garden.

2387
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,440
Anyway, it's clear this rumor really gets to him.

2388
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,440
In an IGN thread about his Mario Galaxy review,

2389
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,440
this comes up and Tommy T.

2390
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,440
shows up to defend himself

2391
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,440
because he Googles his name and has nothing

2392
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,440
better to do. He claims it's not true

2393
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,440
but refuses to say what the real score was

2394
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,440
because he thinks it's fun watching people

2395
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,440
spout nonsense, so Tommy never

2396
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,440
gave Melee a 2.5. That's just a rumor.

2397
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,440
Leave him alone.

2398
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,440
Here's Tommy's review of Smash Bros. Melee.

2399
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,440
What do you think about Super Smash Bros. Melee

2400
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,440
for the Nintendo GameCube?

2401
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,440
Well, you know, I gotta tell you, it's another GameCube

2402
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,440
letdown, another GameCube

2403
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:37,440
disappointment in my book. 3 out of 10.

2404
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,440
I give it a 2.5.

2405
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:41,440
He said this on TV. People saw him.

2406
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,440
The footage exists. This isn't speculation.

2407
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,440
When Tommy does something people criticize

2408
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,440
him for, even something dumb that doesn't

2409
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:49,440
need defending like a video game opinion,

2410
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,440
he just lies and says he never did it.

2411
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:53,440
Like, why would you lie about

2412
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,440
something so stupid and easy

2413
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,440
to check? I'm reaching the point where if Tommy

2414
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,440
says something, it's easier to

2415
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,440
assume he made it up. His website

2416
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,440
used to have a page of famous people seen

2417
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:05,440
wearing Tallarico Studios T-shirts

2418
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,440
which is a weird thing to document in the first

2419
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,440
place but the thing is though, every

2420
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,440
single picture on it is photoshopped.

2421
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,440
Like, what was his goal here?

2422
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,440
What is he even trying to do?

2423
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,440
Tommy's stratospheric levels of clout

2424
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,440
chasing have hit a point where I literally

2425
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,440
can't tell if he's joking. He has a

2426
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,440
gallery page with pictures of him performing

2427
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,440
and in magazines and so on and there's a

2428
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,440
celebrities section showing off all the cool people

2429
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,440
he's stood next to. Wow.

2430
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,440
He's really proud of some of them because he keeps

2431
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,440
reposting them. This Jamie Lee Curtis

2432
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,440
picture pops up on his Twitter when she's in the

2433
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,440
news or it's her birthday. She's a wonderful,

2434
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,440
kind, and talented human being and

2435
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,440
a fan of my video games live show

2436
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,440
but one of the pictures on here is really strange.

2437
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:45,440
This one is of the Dalai Lama apparently.

2438
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,440
Before the Amico situation deteriorated

2439
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,440
to the point he stepped down, he used

2440
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,440
to post on the Atari Age forums and people

2441
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,440
were discussing the Amico's Karma gaming

2442
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,440
engine, a feature Tommy later

2443
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,440
admitted he made up by the way.

2444
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,440
During the conversation about Karma, someone

2445
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,440
referenced the Dalai Lama so of course

2446
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,440
he reposted that picture and said he met him

2447
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,440
in London and he liked his music.

2448
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,440
The issue here is this later turned out to be

2449
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,440
a wax statue of the Dalai Lama

2450
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:11,440
from the Madame Tussauds in London.

2451
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,440
This is an example of what I've decided to call

2452
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:15,440
the Tallarico event horizon.

2453
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,440
Tommy has lied so much

2454
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,440
about so many things, I can't

2455
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:21,440
even tell if this is meant to be a joke.

2456
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,440
Is he doing a bit?

2457
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,440
Is Tommy Tallarico a CIA experiment

2458
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,440
to see how far you can get in the liberal

2459
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,440
games industry by just making shit

2460
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,440
up? Is Tommy Tallarico just

2461
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:33,440
a shadow on the wall of a cave?

2462
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,440
I...I started making

2463
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,440
this video because I thought a sound effect

2464
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,440
was funny! I can't tell if he's joking

2465
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:41,440
or if he genuinely wants to convince

2466
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,440
people he met the Dalai Lama. Like I

2467
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,440
said, this was in a conversation about an Amico

2468
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,440
feature it turned out he made up.

2469
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,440
We have something that's called a

2470
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:51,440
karma gaming engine

2471
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,440
and what that means is that

2472
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,440
everybody, no matter what your

2473
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,440
skill level, can feel

2474
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,440
like you have a chance and that you're

2475
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,440
in the game. I'm interested

2476
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,440
in the fact that you're using the karma gaming

2477
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,440
engine. Uh, where, where did that come

2478
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,440
from? Okay, so the karma gaming

2479
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,440
engine is just some shit we made up.

2480
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:11,440
Okay! Like he literally

2481
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,440
made it up to get people to invest

2482
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,440
and admitted it later. Everywhere

2483
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:17,440
you look, Tommy is trying to build

2484
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,440
more prestige in ways that make no

2485
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:21,440
sense. Once Tommy had fled the

2486
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,440
Atari Age forums after calling everyone

2487
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,440
a gaming racist and stepping down,

2488
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,440
people started posting about how weird

2489
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,440
he was being and a guy told a story there

2490
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,440
about how he ran a display at the Houston Arcade

2491
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,440
Expo in 2018 showing off old

2492
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:35,440
Intellivision stuff right when the Amico

2493
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,440
had just been announced, so he asked Tommy

2494
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,440
if he wanted him to put out some business cards

2495
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,440
advertising the Amico, which he did.

2496
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,440
His display won an award at the show and

2497
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:45,440
mentioned this to Tommy. He allegedly asked

2498
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,440
him to mail him the award. If this

2499
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,440
story is true, Tommy just assumed

2500
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,440
that this award belonged to him.

2501
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,440
This is just an allegation. Normally

2502
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,440
I wouldn't bother putting this in the video,

2503
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,440
but the problem is it tracks so well with a

2504
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:59,440
lifetime of taking credit for things he didn't

2505
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,440
do and making up awards.

2506
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,440
I find this story too believable

2507
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:05,440
not to mention. Still, this doesn't

2508
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,440
mean Tommy hasn't done good work

2509
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,440
in the industry or had any legitimate

2510
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,440
achievements. To properly recognize the good

2511
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:13,440
work he's done, we ought to talk about

2512
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,440
GANG. The Game Audio Network

2513
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,440
Guild is a group of industry professionals

2514
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,440
dedicated to improving the craft,

2515
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,440
helping people network, and recognizing

2516
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,440
people's achievements with awards.

2517
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,440
Tommy has won a lot of awards from

2518
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,440
the Guild over the years, at least 16

2519
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,440
by my count, and he's clearly very proud

2520
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,440
of them because he puts them all up next to his

2521
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,440
Guinness World Records.

2522
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,440
Tommy Tallarico

2523
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,440
is also the founder of GANG.

2524
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,440
Recently, uh, I founded a non-profit

2525
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,440
organization called the Game

2526
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:43,440
Audio Network Guild or

2527
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:45,440
GANG. It's really funny seeing

2528
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,440
Tommy give tours of his house in his GANG

2529
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:49,440
t-shirt and of his office with his GANG

2530
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,440
desktop background and then going to his

2531
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,440
website and seeing 16 awards from

2532
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,440
the group he founded and was on the board of directors

2533
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,440
of at the time. Tommy Tallarico,

2534
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:59,440
composer and sound designer

2535
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,440
for video games, also the

2536
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,440
president of the Game Audio Network Guild

2537
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,440
also known as GANG.

2538
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,440
GANG even gave an award for best

2539
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,440
sound library to that sound pack he

2540
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:11,440
made with Joey's help. They've only given

2541
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,440
out that award four times in their 20

2542
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:14,940
year existence by the way.

2543
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:16,940
And again, these are award

2544
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:18,940
winning sound effects.

2545
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:20,940
At least we know the sounds in the Roblox kit

2546
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:22,940
really are award winning. Like, at this

2547
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:24,940
point, research for a video that was

2548
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:26,940
supposed to be about the Roblox oof

2549
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:28,940
has gone so far off course

2550
01:30:28,940 --> 01:30:30,940
that I needed, like,

2551
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:32,940
something that was baseline obviously

2552
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:34,940
true to hang on to so I could

2553
01:30:34,940 --> 01:30:36,940
return to sanity. So

2554
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:38,940
I asked myself what I thought

2555
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:40,940
would be the most obvious question.

2556
01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:42,940
Was Tommy even on

2557
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:43,940
Cribs?

2558
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:45,940
On YouTube, like I said, there's a lot, there's videos

2559
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:47,940
of your house and MTV

2560
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:49,940
Cribs I was on. It's awesome,

2561
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:51,940
right? You did an MTV Cribs?

2562
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:53,940
Yeah.

2563
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:55,940
Yeah, they were my house. Didn't you have

2564
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:57,940
an episode of MTV Cribs back in the day?

2565
01:30:57,940 --> 01:30:59,940
Yeah! Like he tells

2566
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:01,940
people it was Cribs, he uploaded a video

2567
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:03,940
to his YouTube channel saying it

2568
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:05,940
was Cribs.

2569
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:07,940
So was it?

2570
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:09,940
No!

2571
01:31:09,940 --> 01:31:11,940
Cribs is, you know, a TV

2572
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:13,940
show. It has lists of

2573
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:15,940
episodes. You can just check.

2574
01:31:15,940 --> 01:31:17,940
It was obviously a lie the

2575
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:19,940
entire time. I don't know how no one

2576
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:21,940
called him on it. Do gamers just not know

2577
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:23,940
what Cribs is? Cribs went

2578
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:25,940
to the home of massively successful

2579
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:27,940
musicians like Snoop Dogg and Maroon 5

2580
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:29,940
or other really big celebrities

2581
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:31,940
like Tony fucking Hawk.

2582
01:31:31,940 --> 01:31:33,940
They did not go to the home of the guy

2583
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:35,940
who might have made some of the

2584
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:37,940
skateboard sounds for his game.

2585
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:39,940
Absolutely no normal person

2586
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:41,940
watching MTV in the mid-2000s

2587
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:43,940
is gonna know who Thomas the Tallarico

2588
01:31:43,940 --> 01:31:45,940
engine even is. He did the soundtrack

2589
01:31:45,940 --> 01:31:47,940
to Earthworm Jim. He's not

2590
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:49,940
a celebrity. Nobody gives a shit

2591
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:51,940
about his fucking fountain.

2592
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:53,940
Waterfall here.

2593
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:55,940
Which makes me wanna

2594
01:31:55,940 --> 01:31:57,940
pee at night, oddly enough.

2595
01:31:57,940 --> 01:31:59,940
My mother's very proud. Cribs

2596
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:01,940
had very specific motion graphics and they

2597
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:03,940
always showed the same factoids at the beginning

2598
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:05,940
every time, using the same visual.

2599
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:07,940
This video just has a wall of text.

2600
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:09,940
MTV had a very specific vibe

2601
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:11,940
with its backing tracks. This thing uses

2602
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:13,940
easily identifiable stock music.

2603
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:15,940
So identifiable, YouTube flagged it.

2604
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:17,940
But if it wasn't Cribs, then

2605
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:19,940
what was it? Someone in the comments says they saw

2606
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:21,940
this on a disc that came with a gaming magazine

2607
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:23,940
back in the day, but I think they're thinking

2608
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:25,940
of the other times he did that. Because

2609
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:27,940
Tommy's a massive narcissist, his website

2610
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:29,940
has a video section with a meticulous

2611
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:31,940
collection of his appearances and links to them

2612
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:33,940
on YouTube, some of which he uploaded himself.

2613
01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:35,940
He links this one and calls it MTV

2614
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:37,940
Cribs Here Too, along with two of his

2615
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:39,940
PlayStation Magazine appearances. But here's

2616
01:32:39,940 --> 01:32:41,940
the thing. Tommy's website is ancient

2617
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:43,940
and has several much older versions preserved

2618
01:32:43,940 --> 01:32:45,940
on the Internet Archive. On the version

2619
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:47,940
from 2004, before YouTube was a

2620
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:49,940
thing, he would just put the videos on his own

2621
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:51,940
site. Many of the videos on the old site

2622
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:53,940
ended up as links to YouTube videos on the

2623
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:55,940
new one. The PlayStation Magazine house tour

2624
01:32:55,940 --> 01:32:57,940
and interviews are here, along with this around

2625
01:32:57,940 --> 01:32:59,940
the world in 80 games thing. There doesn't

2626
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:01,940
seem to be a Cribs video on the old version

2627
01:33:01,940 --> 01:33:03,940
of the site, which is a bit of a red flag.

2628
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:05,940
Additionally, there's one house tour that didn't

2629
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:07,940
seem to make it to the new one, done by

2630
01:33:07,940 --> 01:33:09,940
GamerTV. The video itself

2631
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:11,940
on Tommy's site wasn't archived,

2632
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:13,940
but Gamer.TV was a show from the UK

2633
01:33:13,940 --> 01:33:15,940
about gaming hosted by Sam Delaney.

2634
01:33:15,940 --> 01:33:17,940
One episode had a feature on ways to make

2635
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:19,940
money in the game industry, professional gamers,

2636
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:21,940
voice actors, and of course,

2637
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:22,940
a certain composer.

2638
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:24,940
Hey, I'm Tommy Tallarico, composer

2639
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:26,940
and sound designer for video games.

2640
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:28,940
Hey, wait a second!

2641
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:30,940
Hey, I'm Tommy Tallarico, composer

2642
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:32,940
and sound designer for video games.

2643
01:33:32,940 --> 01:33:34,940
So this episode is using a cut-down

2644
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:36,940
version of the footage we saw in Tommy's video.

2645
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:38,940
So now we know who really shot

2646
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:40,940
this footage. Gamer.TV used

2647
01:33:40,940 --> 01:33:42,940
to have a website, Gamer.TV.

2648
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:44,940
Oh, that's clever. It's down now, but in

2649
01:33:44,940 --> 01:33:46,940
archives, it's clear the site used to have a video

2650
01:33:46,940 --> 01:33:48,940
section with extra stuff. One of the extra

2651
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:50,940
videos appears to be about a gamer

2652
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:52,940
with a Ferrari and a luxury home.

2653
01:33:52,940 --> 01:33:54,940
I think Gamer.TV met

2654
01:33:54,940 --> 01:33:56,940
Tommy and toured his house, used

2655
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:58,940
clips from this in their show, and uploaded

2656
01:33:58,940 --> 01:34:00,940
the entire house tour as a bonus feature

2657
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:02,940
to their website. The video linked here

2658
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:04,940
is sadly not archived either. At least

2659
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:06,940
not directly. It was preserved

2660
01:34:06,940 --> 01:34:08,940
if, say, Tommy downloaded

2661
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:10,940
it and put it on his own website and then later

2662
01:34:10,940 --> 01:34:12,940
moved his video archive to YouTube.

2663
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:14,940
This is a kind of cool act of video

2664
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:16,940
preservation except for the part where it

2665
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:18,940
somehow ended up being called MTV

2666
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:20,940
Cribs. How did that happen?

2667
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:22,940
I mean, the file on his website

2668
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:24,940
was named correctly. This would be

2669
01:34:24,940 --> 01:34:26,940
a difficult thing to get wrong unless

2670
01:34:26,940 --> 01:34:28,940
he did it on purpose.

2671
01:34:28,940 --> 01:34:30,940
It's awesome, right?

2672
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:32,940
Is Tommy just, like, a

2673
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:34,940
pathological liar? Does he have to

2674
01:34:34,940 --> 01:34:36,940
lie to sound more interesting no matter

2675
01:34:36,940 --> 01:34:38,940
what? Like how he went from saying he did

2676
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:40,940
some sounds for Prime to saying he worked

2677
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:42,940
on it with Miyamoto for five years or how

2678
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:44,940
he went from being one of the voices in

2679
01:34:44,940 --> 01:34:46,940
Pro Skater to the audio director or

2680
01:34:46,940 --> 01:34:48,940
how he went from doing three songs for Sonic

2681
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:50,940
and the Black Knight in 2009 to

2682
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:52,940
being the first American to ever get to kiss

2683
01:34:52,940 --> 01:34:54,940
Sonic on his little mouth? Every time

2684
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:56,940
something comes up again, the lie has to get bigger.

2685
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:58,940
In that newer house tour I showed,

2686
01:34:58,940 --> 01:35:00,940
the guy asks Tommy about if it was featured

2687
01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:02,940
on Cribs and he says it was on there more than

2688
01:35:02,940 --> 01:35:04,940
once. Tommy Tallarica

2689
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:06,940
has invited me to his

2690
01:35:06,940 --> 01:35:08,940
MTV Crib. This hasn't been on

2691
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:10,940
the MTV Crib, right? Uh, a couple times.

2692
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:12,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why is he like this?

2693
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:14,940
Why are you like

2694
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:16,940
this? I know you're still watching,

2695
01:35:16,940 --> 01:35:18,940
Tommy. Explain yourself.

2696
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:20,940
What are you doing? What are you

2697
01:35:20,940 --> 01:35:22,940
fucking doing?

2698
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:28,940
So...

2699
01:35:28,940 --> 01:35:30,940
yeah. Maybe

2700
01:35:30,940 --> 01:35:32,940
every single thing Tommy

2701
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:34,940
has ever said is a lie. Maybe

2702
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:36,940
some of it is true, but bear in mind

2703
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:38,940
that even if Tommy has

2704
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:40,940
lied, that isn't, like,

2705
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:42,940
a crime. You can just lie to people.

2706
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:44,940
Watch. I am a trained

2707
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:46,940
helicopter pilot. See? You can

2708
01:35:46,940 --> 01:35:48,940
just say things. No one can stop you.

2709
01:35:48,940 --> 01:35:50,940
However, there are times when lying

2710
01:35:50,940 --> 01:35:52,940
does become a crime, and Tommy

2711
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:54,940
would know this intimately because it cost him

2712
01:35:54,940 --> 01:35:56,940
$100,000. In 2009,

2713
01:35:56,940 --> 01:35:58,940
after putting on a video games live event

2714
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:00,940
in Brazil, Tommy returned to America

2715
01:36:00,940 --> 01:36:02,940
with over $100,000

2716
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:04,940
in cash on his person. When you

2717
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:06,940
enter America with more than $10,000,

2718
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:08,940
you have to declare it for money laundering

2719
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:10,940
and trafficking reasons. Tommy knew

2720
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:12,940
he had to do this, but for some reason,

2721
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:14,940
he didn't. His business associate,

2722
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:16,940
who was also his brother, filed a customs

2723
01:36:16,940 --> 01:36:18,940
declaration on their common behalf, denying

2724
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:20,940
they were bringing that much money into the country.

2725
01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:22,940
Tommy knew this was false. When he

2726
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:24,940
was caught at a TSA checkpoint with a bag

2727
01:36:24,940 --> 01:36:26,940
with $100,000 in it, there were some

2728
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:28,940
serious questions. He quickly made up

2729
01:36:28,940 --> 01:36:30,940
a story to explain himself. He told them he

2730
01:36:30,940 --> 01:36:32,940
didn't need to declare the money because he had

2731
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:34,940
distributed it among his band members during

2732
01:36:34,940 --> 01:36:36,940
the flight in amounts less than $10,000

2733
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:38,940
and then took the money back once they

2734
01:36:38,940 --> 01:36:40,940
were through customs, so no one needed to declare

2735
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:42,940
anything. Tommy thought he was being clever,

2736
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:44,940
but he had just accidentally confessed

2737
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:46,940
to the crime of structuring, where you

2738
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:48,940
deliberately avoid regulations by pulling

2739
01:36:48,940 --> 01:36:50,940
stunts like this. Structuring is a

2740
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:52,940
federal felony with huge fines and

2741
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:54,940
up to five years in prison attached to it.

2742
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:56,940
Later, he came clean and told investigators

2743
01:36:56,940 --> 01:36:58,940
he lied and made up that story,

2744
01:36:58,940 --> 01:37:00,940
and actually he just took the money over the border

2745
01:37:00,940 --> 01:37:02,940
himself, so when I call Tommy a liar,

2746
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:04,940
that's not just my opinion. There is

2747
01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:06,940
also a legal document signed by him

2748
01:37:06,940 --> 01:37:08,940
admitting to it. Looking deeper into

2749
01:37:08,940 --> 01:37:10,940
United States v. Tallarico,

2750
01:37:10,940 --> 01:37:12,940
that's its name. Tommy pled guilty,

2751
01:37:12,940 --> 01:37:14,940
was placed on probation for a year,

2752
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:16,940
forfeited the $102,000 seized

2753
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:18,940
by customs, and had to pay a $1,000

2754
01:37:18,940 --> 01:37:20,940
fine, plus a $25

2755
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:22,940
assessment fee.

2756
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:24,940
America! There's a really interesting lesson

2757
01:37:24,940 --> 01:37:26,940
here. In the game industry, you can just

2758
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:28,940
lie about what games you worked on,

2759
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:30,940
what sounds you made, and whether you worked

2760
01:37:30,940 --> 01:37:32,940
on cribs, and the only real repercussion

2761
01:37:32,940 --> 01:37:34,940
is people finding you unpleasant,

2762
01:37:34,940 --> 01:37:36,940
but if you try that with the TSA while carrying

2763
01:37:36,940 --> 01:37:38,940
a large, unexplained bag of money,

2764
01:37:38,940 --> 01:37:40,940
there can be consequences.

2765
01:37:40,940 --> 01:37:42,940
There are other ways lying can be a crime

2766
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:44,940
too. For example,

2767
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:46,940
if you lie to potential investors

2768
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:48,940
to get their money. During one of Tommy's many

2769
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:50,940
attempts to find investors for the Amico,

2770
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:52,940
he told the exact kind of Tommy-esque

2771
01:37:52,940 --> 01:37:54,940
tall tales you would expect from him

2772
01:37:54,940 --> 01:37:56,940
but in a situation where doing so can get

2773
01:37:56,940 --> 01:37:58,940
you in serious trouble. In February

2774
01:37:58,940 --> 01:38:00,940
2021, he recorded this video

2775
01:38:00,940 --> 01:38:02,940
for potential investors and lists the team

2776
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:04,940
of so-called Avengers working at

2777
01:38:04,940 --> 01:38:06,940
Intellivision, one of whom was Kara Acker,

2778
01:38:06,940 --> 01:38:08,940
a former marketing manager at Mattel

2779
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:10,940
on Disney Princesses and especially Frozen,

2780
01:38:10,940 --> 01:38:12,940
which would be a great find for the company

2781
01:38:12,940 --> 01:38:14,940
and thinking she was on board might

2782
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:16,940
well have helped convince investors to part

2783
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:18,940
with their money. If we scroll slightly higher

2784
01:38:18,940 --> 01:38:20,940
on her LinkedIn though, we can see she actually

2785
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:22,940
left Intellivision...

2786
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:24,940
in 2020. But here's Tommy

2787
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:26,940
telling people in 2021

2788
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:28,940
after she was gone, he has

2789
01:38:28,940 --> 01:38:30,940
her on board, so you should definitely

2790
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:31,940
invest.

2791
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:33,940
Our VP of global

2792
01:38:33,940 --> 01:38:35,940
marketing used to work at Mattel

2793
01:38:35,940 --> 01:38:37,940
as one of the global

2794
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:39,940
brand managers over there, right?

2795
01:38:39,940 --> 01:38:41,940
And she was in charge of the Disney

2796
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:43,940
brand within Mattel, so

2797
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:45,940
that's a double bonus there.

2798
01:38:45,940 --> 01:38:47,940
Um, is there a word for

2799
01:38:47,940 --> 01:38:49,940
lying to people? For money?

2800
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:51,940
If this convinced people to invest,

2801
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:53,940
they have grounds to say they were lied to

2802
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:55,940
about the status of the company. You can't

2803
01:38:55,940 --> 01:38:57,940
just pretend people still work for

2804
01:38:57,940 --> 01:38:59,940
you. On their Republic crowdfunding campaign,

2805
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:01,940
which raised $11.5 million,

2806
01:39:01,940 --> 01:39:03,940
the pitch video for these investors

2807
01:39:03,940 --> 01:39:05,940
featured Aka heavily in Tommy's

2808
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:07,940
disgusting Egypt room as VP of

2809
01:39:07,940 --> 01:39:09,940
global marketing. She was front and center

2810
01:39:09,940 --> 01:39:11,940
as one of the intended draws to investors.

2811
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:13,940
She was basically the company's pharaoh.

2812
01:39:13,940 --> 01:39:15,940
She's also still shown on

2813
01:39:15,940 --> 01:39:17,940
the list of team members, including,

2814
01:39:17,940 --> 01:39:19,940
ironically, a link to her LinkedIn, which

2815
01:39:19,940 --> 01:39:21,940
will tell you she's actually gone. This

2816
01:39:21,940 --> 01:39:23,940
crowdfunding campaign ended in 2021.

2817
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:25,940
There was a period of four

2818
01:39:25,940 --> 01:39:27,940
months minimum where people were investing

2819
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:29,940
based on a video and information

2820
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:31,940
which was not accurate at the time and

2821
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:33,940
never corrected. The Intellivision website

2822
01:39:33,940 --> 01:39:35,940
listed Aka as VP of global marketing

2823
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:37,940
as late as July 2021

2824
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:39,940
according to the Internet Archive. Did the

2825
01:39:39,940 --> 01:39:41,940
guy who ran the website quit too?

2826
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:43,940
Investors using this website as a source

2827
01:39:43,940 --> 01:39:45,940
of information would have a hard time confirming

2828
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:47,940
who was actually at the company.

2829
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:49,940
People don't give, investors don't give

2830
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:51,940
you millions of dollars unless you have hard,

2831
01:39:51,940 --> 01:39:53,940
cold facts. I certainly hope

2832
01:39:53,940 --> 01:39:55,940
there's some facts I missed here. People gave

2833
01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:57,940
this company millions of dollars.

2834
01:39:57,940 --> 01:39:59,940
Like, seriously, I hope for Intellivision's sake

2835
01:39:59,940 --> 01:40:01,940
Aka just put the wrong date on her LinkedIn.

2836
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:03,940
Well, there's gonna be some questions.

2837
01:40:03,940 --> 01:40:05,940
In fact, if you click the invest button

2838
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:07,940
on the Intellivision website, it takes you

2839
01:40:07,940 --> 01:40:09,940
to the same video with Aka still in it.

2840
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:11,940
You know the Avengers, right? Marvel Avengers.

2841
01:40:11,940 --> 01:40:13,940
You know, they're the super team of superheroes

2842
01:40:13,940 --> 01:40:15,940
ready to save the world. Also on

2843
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:17,940
Tommy's list of Avengers was Jay Allard,

2844
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:19,940
the co-founder of the Xbox and Xbox Live.

2845
01:40:19,940 --> 01:40:21,940
This would make the company look like

2846
01:40:21,940 --> 01:40:23,940
it was on the right track and had some really

2847
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:25,940
good minds attached to it. However,

2848
01:40:25,940 --> 01:40:27,940
Allard decided he wasn't a good fit

2849
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:29,940
and left the company.

2850
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:31,940
In 2020. Here's another one.

2851
01:40:31,940 --> 01:40:33,940
How about the guy who co-founded

2852
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:35,940
and co-created

2853
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:37,940
the Xbox, right? When Tommy

2854
01:40:37,940 --> 01:40:39,940
was saying Allard was on the team in this

2855
01:40:39,940 --> 01:40:41,940
footage, to get people's money,

2856
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:43,940
Allard was already gone.

2857
01:40:43,940 --> 01:40:45,940
He was gone to such an extent

2858
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:47,940
he didn't just change his LinkedIn to say he wasn't

2859
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:49,940
at the company anymore. He removed

2860
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:51,940
it from his page completely. Allard

2861
01:40:51,940 --> 01:40:53,940
unworked at Intellivision

2862
01:40:53,940 --> 01:40:55,940
and after this happened, Tommy

2863
01:40:55,940 --> 01:40:57,940
was shooting a new video telling people

2864
01:40:57,940 --> 01:40:59,940
he was in the Amico Avengers.

2865
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:01,940
I mean, this guy doesn't even need to work anymore,

2866
01:41:01,940 --> 01:41:03,940
but he loves our idea

2867
01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:05,940
and concept so much that

2868
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:07,940
he joined the team and has been making

2869
01:41:07,940 --> 01:41:09,940
huge, huge contributions.

2870
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:11,940
This particular comment

2871
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:13,940
is incredible because on another

2872
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:15,940
investment platform, remember Fig? Tommy

2873
01:41:15,940 --> 01:41:17,940
had previously bragged about Allard's involvement

2874
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:19,940
in that investor video too. He was actually

2875
01:41:19,940 --> 01:41:21,940
at the company when this one was made

2876
01:41:21,940 --> 01:41:23,940
at least and Intellivision's share offering

2877
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:25,940
documents on Fig also claimed Allard

2878
01:41:25,940 --> 01:41:27,940
was involved and that he was the global

2879
01:41:27,940 --> 01:41:29,940
managing director. A while after Allard

2880
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:31,940
had left, the SEC noticed

2881
01:41:31,940 --> 01:41:33,940
Intellivision's Fig was still advertising

2882
01:41:33,940 --> 01:41:35,940
he was there. Investors were technically

2883
01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:37,940
being deceived. Also, a major

2884
01:41:37,940 --> 01:41:39,940
member of staff like the global managing

2885
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:41,940
director leaving could be causing

2886
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:43,940
problems with making the product they were

2887
01:41:43,940 --> 01:41:45,940
promising to investors, you know? So

2888
01:41:45,940 --> 01:41:47,940
they asked Fig what was going on.

2889
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:49,940
Orally, someone at a government

2890
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:51,940
agency physically asked

2891
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:53,940
someone at Fig what the hell was happening

2892
01:41:53,940 --> 01:41:55,940
at Intellivision. Fig asked Intellivision

2893
01:41:55,940 --> 01:41:57,940
to clarify. Intellivision panicked

2894
01:41:57,940 --> 01:41:59,940
and said they would change the documents

2895
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:01,940
and product development was unaffected by his

2896
01:42:01,940 --> 01:42:03,940
leaving because, to quote Fig quoting

2897
01:42:03,940 --> 01:42:05,940
Intellivision, he has not played a material

2898
01:42:05,940 --> 01:42:07,940
role in product development

2899
01:42:07,940 --> 01:42:09,940
considering his contributions.

2900
01:42:09,940 --> 01:42:11,940
He joined the team and has been making

2901
01:42:11,940 --> 01:42:13,940
huge, huge contributions.

2902
01:42:13,940 --> 01:42:15,940
Uh... This is footage

2903
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:17,940
of a CEO right before his company

2904
01:42:17,940 --> 01:42:19,940
tells a major government agency

2905
01:42:19,940 --> 01:42:21,940
Allard is gone and hadn't made meaningful

2906
01:42:21,940 --> 01:42:23,940
contributions telling people he's

2907
01:42:23,940 --> 01:42:25,940
on the team and has been making huge,

2908
01:42:25,940 --> 01:42:27,940
huge contributions to get

2909
01:42:27,940 --> 01:42:29,940
their money. I'm not a lawyer.

2910
01:42:29,940 --> 01:42:31,940
I'm just a helicopter pilot,

2911
01:42:31,940 --> 01:42:33,940
but I don't think it gets worse

2912
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:35,940
than this. You know, this is the kind

2913
01:42:35,940 --> 01:42:37,940
of thing that's like, really? I mean,

2914
01:42:37,940 --> 01:42:39,940
talk about a slam dunk. The people

2915
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:41,940
working at the company are the main pitch

2916
01:42:41,940 --> 01:42:43,940
for the Amico. Invest in me.

2917
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:45,940
I don't lose. I have the best team.

2918
01:42:45,940 --> 01:42:47,940
I've been a winner in this industry

2919
01:42:47,940 --> 01:42:49,940
my whole career. I

2920
01:42:49,940 --> 01:42:51,940
don't lose, and what

2921
01:42:51,940 --> 01:42:53,940
I've done is packed our team

2922
01:42:53,940 --> 01:42:55,940
with other people who are winners.

2923
01:42:55,940 --> 01:42:57,940
Several of his key team members weren't

2924
01:42:57,940 --> 01:42:59,940
working there anymore when he recorded

2925
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:01,940
this. One of them had even scrubbed it from his

2926
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:03,940
LinkedIn. I don't think this is giving potential

2927
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:05,940
investors an accurate impression of what they're

2928
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:07,940
buying into. This is the exact kind of thing

2929
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:09,940
Tommy normally does, but in this context

2930
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:11,940
it's really bad, and this brings

2931
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:13,940
us to the real question at the center

2932
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:15,940
of all this. The big thing we've been avoiding

2933
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:17,940
for the last hour while we circle

2934
01:43:17,940 --> 01:43:19,940
the drain, but we can't avoid it

2935
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:21,940
anymore. Did Tommy make

2936
01:43:21,940 --> 01:43:23,940
the funny baby sound effect?

2937
01:43:23,940 --> 01:43:25,940
Remember when that was the point of the video?

2938
01:43:25,940 --> 01:43:27,940
When we look at the sum collective of all

2939
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:29,940
of his claims, the Tallarico

2940
01:43:29,940 --> 01:43:31,940
totality if you will, and we put

2941
01:43:31,940 --> 01:43:33,940
it in context with, uh,

2942
01:43:33,940 --> 01:43:35,940
reality, when Tommy says he

2943
01:43:35,940 --> 01:43:37,940
created the oof, this might just

2944
01:43:37,940 --> 01:43:39,940
be me, but I don't believe

2945
01:43:39,940 --> 01:43:41,940
him. Although at this point, if Tommy confessed to

2946
01:43:41,940 --> 01:43:43,940
a murder, I would assume he was just trying to

2947
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:45,940
be cool. I'm sure if I was a more reasonable person

2948
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:47,940
I could say the evidence is all inconclusive

2949
01:43:47,940 --> 01:43:49,940
and Tommy could have worked on the sound

2950
01:43:49,940 --> 01:43:51,940
maybe, but right now all I

2951
01:43:51,940 --> 01:43:53,940
know is Tommy is a huge liar, and

2952
01:43:53,940 --> 01:43:55,940
I hate him, and he made me forget what this

2953
01:43:55,940 --> 01:43:57,940
video is about!

2954
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:01,940
I promise you when I started making

2955
01:44:01,940 --> 01:44:03,940
this video, my goal was to make something

2956
01:44:03,940 --> 01:44:05,940
short for once. Take a break from

2957
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:07,940
my longer projects to make a quick video

2958
01:44:07,940 --> 01:44:09,940
quickly so people knew I was

2959
01:44:09,940 --> 01:44:11,940
alive. I did not expect while I was

2960
01:44:11,940 --> 01:44:13,940
doing research for a rabbit hole to open

2961
01:44:13,940 --> 01:44:15,940
beneath my feet and to fall Wile E.

2962
01:44:15,940 --> 01:44:17,940
Coyote style into an abyss of lies

2963
01:44:17,940 --> 01:44:19,940
and madness and seemingly getting one of

2964
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:21,940
his Guinness World Records sent to the fucking

2965
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:23,940
Shadow Realm. I didn't choose this!

2966
01:44:23,940 --> 01:44:25,940
This happened to me,

2967
01:44:25,940 --> 01:44:27,940
and I'm not happy about it. I wanted this

2968
01:44:27,940 --> 01:44:29,940
to be a story about how in our modern age

2969
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:31,940
we don't take ownership of artists' work

2970
01:44:31,940 --> 01:44:33,940
seriously enough through the lens of

2971
01:44:33,940 --> 01:44:35,940
a sound effect that had been reused without

2972
01:44:35,940 --> 01:44:37,940
credit for over a decade, but

2973
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:39,940
the people not being credited in this story are

2974
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:41,940
hard-working folks under Tommy who he

2975
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:43,940
has taken credit from over the years

2976
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:45,940
and the original voice actor, none

2977
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:47,940
of whom will see any of the money Tommy makes

2978
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:49,940
from selling their sound today.

2979
01:44:49,940 --> 01:44:51,940
It is incredibly easy for hard work

2980
01:44:51,940 --> 01:44:53,940
to be exploited by corporations,

2981
01:44:53,940 --> 01:44:55,940
and one of those corporations happens to

2982
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:57,940
be called Tommy Tallarico Studios

2983
01:44:57,940 --> 01:44:59,940
Incorporated, but that's really a

2984
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:01,940
structural problem, and we already all know

2985
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:03,940
capitalism is bad. Statistically, your

2986
01:45:03,940 --> 01:45:05,940
most formative memories are of a global financial

2987
01:45:05,940 --> 01:45:07,940
crisis. You don't need that lecture from

2988
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:09,940
me. I think the unique lesson of this story

2989
01:45:09,940 --> 01:45:11,940
is about, well, records

2990
01:45:11,940 --> 01:45:13,940
in multiple senses of the word.

2991
01:45:13,940 --> 01:45:15,940
What's really at stake here is history,

2992
01:45:15,940 --> 01:45:17,940
how these events and people

2993
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:19,940
will be remembered. Tommy has cultivated

2994
01:45:19,940 --> 01:45:21,940
such a reputation that when I asked about

2995
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:23,940
the origins of a famous punch sound effect

2996
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:25,940
on Twitter, someone independently

2997
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:27,940
brought him up and said they assume he

2998
01:45:27,940 --> 01:45:29,940
must have done it. He seems to have done everything.

2999
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:31,940
At least he says he has.

3000
01:45:31,940 --> 01:45:33,940
The man has successfully inserted himself into

3001
01:45:33,940 --> 01:45:35,940
conversations about sound effects he didn't even

3002
01:45:35,940 --> 01:45:37,940
make, while the people who did the work

3003
01:45:37,940 --> 01:45:39,940
attributed to him evaporate into

3004
01:45:39,940 --> 01:45:41,940
namelessness. No one knows who Joey

3005
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:43,940
Kouros is, and he made the sound effects

3006
01:45:43,940 --> 01:45:45,940
people think Tommy did. He worked on

3007
01:45:45,940 --> 01:45:47,940
fucking Fortnite. I've heard his

3008
01:45:47,940 --> 01:45:49,940
sound effects as they blast my silver

3009
01:45:49,940 --> 01:45:51,940
surfer into dust. It's not

3010
01:45:51,940 --> 01:45:53,940
right for him and people like him to be

3011
01:45:53,940 --> 01:45:55,940
forgotten. Games have always had problems

3012
01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:57,940
crediting authors correctly. Early

3013
01:45:57,940 --> 01:45:59,940
games were seen as products first and

3014
01:45:59,940 --> 01:46:01,940
creative work second, so credit wasn't

3015
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:03,940
taken seriously. Creators used

3016
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:05,940
to not be allowed to put their name on the game

3017
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:07,940
and had to hide them in Easter eggs.

3018
01:46:07,940 --> 01:46:09,940
Mark Cerny, ironically another good candidate

3019
01:46:09,940 --> 01:46:11,940
for first American to work on Sonic,

3020
01:46:11,940 --> 01:46:13,940
wasn't allowed to keep any of his work or design

3021
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:15,940
documents when he was working at Atari,

3022
01:46:15,940 --> 01:46:17,940
and his games were considered Atari creations,

3023
01:46:17,940 --> 01:46:19,940
not his. His source code,

3024
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:21,940
notes, and documentation were only

3025
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:23,940
preserved because someone got them out of a dumpster

3026
01:46:23,940 --> 01:46:25,940
when Atari closed the office and threw

3027
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:27,940
it all out. This problem has especially

3028
01:46:27,940 --> 01:46:29,940
contributed to the perception of women working

3029
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:31,940
in games. Yoko Shimomura, one of the

3030
01:46:31,940 --> 01:46:33,940
most well-known video game music composers

3031
01:46:33,940 --> 01:46:35,940
today, a veritable industry icon

3032
01:46:35,940 --> 01:46:37,940
one might say, composed all but

3033
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:39,940
three of the tracks on the original arcade

3034
01:46:39,940 --> 01:46:41,940
version of Street Fighter II, but due to

3035
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:43,940
Capcom's crediting policy at the time,

3036
01:46:43,940 --> 01:46:45,940
she was credited via a pseudonym. For her

3037
01:46:45,940 --> 01:46:47,940
music's appearance on console releases and

3038
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:49,940
updated versions of the game, she was not credited

3039
01:46:49,940 --> 01:46:51,940
for her compositions at all. All credit

3040
01:46:51,940 --> 01:46:53,940
was given to the people who translated them to the

3041
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:55,940
new formats. Her contributions to game

3042
01:46:55,940 --> 01:46:57,940
music history are only recognized

3043
01:46:57,940 --> 01:46:59,940
properly decades afterwards because

3044
01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:01,940
her early career was rendered invisible,

3045
01:47:01,940 --> 01:47:03,940
music she wrote often being credited to

3046
01:47:03,940 --> 01:47:05,940
someone else. This was widespread at

3047
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:07,940
the company. The Capcom sound team throughout

3048
01:47:07,940 --> 01:47:09,940
the 80s and early 90s was almost

3049
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:11,940
entirely women. Just think about

3050
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:13,940
that for a second. An extremely influential

3051
01:47:13,940 --> 01:47:15,940
group of female early game

3052
01:47:15,940 --> 01:47:17,940
composers, all credited through pseudonyms

3053
01:47:17,940 --> 01:47:19,940
or sometimes not at all, and with the

3054
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:21,940
ports of music they composed credited

3055
01:47:21,940 --> 01:47:23,940
to someone else. Maybe one of the reasons

3056
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:25,940
game development is perceived as a male

3057
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:27,940
dominated industry is because all the women

3058
01:47:27,940 --> 01:47:29,940
who've always been here keep getting

3059
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:31,940
left out of the history they wrote.

3060
01:47:31,940 --> 01:47:33,940
If you're interested in the topic, I recommend

3061
01:47:33,940 --> 01:47:35,940
the Street Fighter Lady and Female Credit

3062
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:37,940
by Andy Lemon and Hillegonda Rietveld.

3063
01:47:37,940 --> 01:47:39,940
I've linked them in the description and plagiarized

3064
01:47:39,940 --> 01:47:41,940
them heavily in this section of the video,

3065
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:43,940
but even when people are credited, the recognition

3066
01:47:43,940 --> 01:47:45,940
can easily be minimized. Joey did

3067
01:47:45,940 --> 01:47:47,940
some of the music for the Terminator Sega

3068
01:47:47,940 --> 01:47:49,940
CD game, but as you can imagine, this

3069
01:47:49,940 --> 01:47:51,940
information has been rendered obscure thanks to

3070
01:47:51,940 --> 01:47:53,940
a much larger musician making sure his name

3071
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:55,940
is remembered first. The official

3072
01:47:55,940 --> 01:47:57,940
CD release of the soundtrack has

3073
01:47:57,940 --> 01:47:59,940
Tommy V. Tallarico stamped on the

3074
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:01,940
front. Its booklet says composed,

3075
01:48:01,940 --> 01:48:03,940
produced, and performed by Tommy Tallarico

3076
01:48:03,940 --> 01:48:05,940
and calls Tommy a veritable video game

3077
01:48:05,940 --> 01:48:07,940
industry icon, of course. The half a

3078
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:09,940
dozen people who collaborated with him and

3079
01:48:09,940 --> 01:48:11,940
wrote the other half of the songs only

3080
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:13,940
appear on the back of the case at the bottom

3081
01:48:13,940 --> 01:48:15,940
as footnotes with stars corresponding

3082
01:48:15,940 --> 01:48:17,940
to which songs they actually made,

3083
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:19,940
so their names don't get noticed quite as much.

3084
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:21,940
Joey's song was so good, Tommy saw

3085
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:23,940
fit to put it on another album with his name

3086
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:25,940
and face on it. Tommy Tallarico, Virgin

3087
01:48:25,940 --> 01:48:27,940
Games' greatest hits. Joey's name

3088
01:48:27,940 --> 01:48:29,940
is even smaller on the back of this one.

3089
01:48:29,940 --> 01:48:31,940
It's not difficult to see

3090
01:48:31,940 --> 01:48:33,940
why Joey's contributions to game history

3091
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:35,940
are being forgotten. Reuploads

3092
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:37,940
of the full Terminator CD soundtrack onto

3093
01:48:37,940 --> 01:48:39,940
YouTube just say composed by Tommy.

3094
01:48:39,940 --> 01:48:41,940
There's a reupload of specifically Joey's

3095
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:43,940
song too. The uploader who understandably

3096
01:48:43,940 --> 01:48:45,940
missed the tiny note on the back

3097
01:48:45,940 --> 01:48:47,940
of the CD case credits it to Tommy.

3098
01:48:47,940 --> 01:48:49,940
The top comment is a guy called

3099
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:51,940
Joey Kouros explaining that he

3100
01:48:51,940 --> 01:48:53,940
actually made it, but also thanking people

3101
01:48:53,940 --> 01:48:55,940
for their kind words. We're at the point

3102
01:48:55,940 --> 01:48:57,940
the actual composers have to

3103
01:48:57,940 --> 01:48:59,940
explain they made the song in the

3104
01:48:59,940 --> 01:49:01,940
comments of reuploads of their work

3105
01:49:01,940 --> 01:49:03,940
misattributed to their old boss.

3106
01:49:03,940 --> 01:49:05,940
This extends back into the regular music

3107
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:07,940
industry as a whole, of course, but also

3108
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:09,940
into material we covered here. Michael Jackson's

3109
01:49:09,940 --> 01:49:11,940
long-rumored, now semi-confirmed

3110
01:49:11,940 --> 01:49:13,940
work on Sonic 3 isn't all it's

3111
01:49:13,940 --> 01:49:15,940
cracked up to be either. Like a certain other

3112
01:49:15,940 --> 01:49:17,940
composer, Michael had people who worked

3113
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:19,940
for him. According to Brad Buxer,

3114
01:49:19,940 --> 01:49:21,940
an American keyboardist and composer who did

3115
01:49:21,940 --> 01:49:23,940
a lot of work with Jackson and actually is

3116
01:49:23,940 --> 01:49:25,940
credited on Sonic 3, Jackson basically

3117
01:49:25,940 --> 01:49:27,940
made him do most of it. Once you're well

3118
01:49:27,940 --> 01:49:29,940
enough established, it only gets easier to exploit

3119
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:31,940
the talents of people working for you

3120
01:49:31,940 --> 01:49:33,940
and build up your own status on the back

3121
01:49:33,940 --> 01:49:35,940
of something you made someone else do.

3122
01:49:35,940 --> 01:49:37,940
The industry is still constructed

3123
01:49:37,940 --> 01:49:39,940
in a way that treats individual creators,

3124
01:49:39,940 --> 01:49:41,940
usually the biggest names on the project,

3125
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:43,940
as the true authors, attributing a game's

3126
01:49:43,940 --> 01:49:45,940
success to them and not the many

3127
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:47,940
people who did the work. Things are

3128
01:49:47,940 --> 01:49:49,940
so bad even the recipients of this

3129
01:49:49,940 --> 01:49:51,940
praise have called it out. To quote one of

3130
01:49:51,940 --> 01:49:53,940
the worst articles ever written,

3131
01:49:53,940 --> 01:49:55,940
there's a tendency among the press to attribute

3132
01:49:55,940 --> 01:49:57,940
the creation of a game to a single person,

3133
01:49:57,940 --> 01:49:59,940
says Warren Spector,

3134
01:49:59,940 --> 01:50:01,940
creator of Thief and Deus Ex.

3135
01:50:01,940 --> 01:50:03,940
The journalistic attitude to credit in gaming

3136
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:05,940
used to be so awful it's not even

3137
01:50:05,940 --> 01:50:07,940
clear who wrote this. The article

3138
01:50:07,940 --> 01:50:09,940
is credited to IGN staff.

3139
01:50:09,940 --> 01:50:11,940
Basically all success and

3140
01:50:11,940 --> 01:50:13,940
appreciation pours directly into

3141
01:50:13,940 --> 01:50:15,940
selected industry figureheads even

3142
01:50:15,940 --> 01:50:17,940
they're actively trying to stop it from

3143
01:50:17,940 --> 01:50:19,940
happening and a lot of them aren't because

3144
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:21,940
even if it's a problem, it's a problem that

3145
01:50:21,940 --> 01:50:23,940
benefits them. You can tell a lot about

3146
01:50:23,940 --> 01:50:25,940
an industry by how it treats the people

3147
01:50:25,940 --> 01:50:27,940
who actually do the work. In terms

3148
01:50:27,940 --> 01:50:29,940
of the scope of time, the average

3149
01:50:29,940 --> 01:50:31,940
game developer is...fucked.

3150
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:33,940
The hundreds and sometimes thousands

3151
01:50:33,940 --> 01:50:35,940
of people who work on games now throw

3152
01:50:35,940 --> 01:50:37,940
away years of their lives and so many

3153
01:50:37,940 --> 01:50:39,940
of them go completely unappreciated.

3154
01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:41,940
Meanwhile, the most asshole-ish men

3155
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:43,940
in the industry continue to promote themselves

3156
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:45,940
off the back of the efforts of the people working

3157
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:47,940
for them. Imagine making great sound effects

3158
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:49,940
for years and years only for your boss

3159
01:50:49,940 --> 01:50:51,940
to tell some guy in a Halloween

3160
01:50:51,940 --> 01:50:53,940
mask on a live stream with a hundred views

3161
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:55,940
that he did it. We don't recognize

3162
01:50:55,940 --> 01:50:57,940
the work and achievements of people who

3163
01:50:57,940 --> 01:50:59,940
make games. We recognize the people

3164
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:01,940
who exploited that work the best.

3165
01:51:01,940 --> 01:51:03,940
It's so easy for history and

3166
01:51:03,940 --> 01:51:05,940
credit to get wiped away. Case in

3167
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:07,940
point, we could have never learned

3168
01:51:07,940 --> 01:51:09,940
that the oof was from Messiah and assumed

3169
01:51:09,940 --> 01:51:11,940
Roblox made it forever.

3170
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:13,940
But it's not even the Roblox oof.

3171
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:15,940
In my household, we call it the Messiah

3172
01:51:15,940 --> 01:51:17,940
oof. There are thousands of people whose

3173
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:19,940
good work on games will never be properly credited

3174
01:51:19,940 --> 01:51:21,940
who we might have already forgotten

3175
01:51:21,940 --> 01:51:23,940
about. Gaming is still a young medium

3176
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:25,940
but already the sands of our

3177
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:27,940
history are spilling through our monster

3178
01:51:27,940 --> 01:51:29,940
energy sodden fingers. Entire

3179
01:51:29,940 --> 01:51:31,940
games are at risk of being forgotten

3180
01:51:31,940 --> 01:51:33,940
never mind the human beings who created

3181
01:51:33,940 --> 01:51:35,940
them. The most valuable contribution

3182
01:51:35,940 --> 01:51:37,940
Tommy has made to the story is mentioning

3183
01:51:37,940 --> 01:51:39,940
that the voice actress was the daughter of someone

3184
01:51:39,940 --> 01:51:41,940
who worked at Shiny Entertainment at the time.

3185
01:51:41,940 --> 01:51:43,940
Her father

3186
01:51:43,940 --> 01:51:45,940
worked at

3187
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:47,940
Shiny Entertainment. The girl

3188
01:51:47,940 --> 01:51:49,940
whose voice was the oof would be close to

3189
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:51,940
30 now. She might even have heard it

3190
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:53,940
and not even known it was her. She might not

3191
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:55,940
even remember recording it. The people who know

3192
01:51:55,940 --> 01:51:57,940
who this was and the parent who worked

3193
01:51:57,940 --> 01:51:59,940
on the game, those people aren't gonna be around

3194
01:51:59,940 --> 01:52:01,940
forever. We have a limited time

3195
01:52:01,940 --> 01:52:03,940
to learn who this was. The thing

3196
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:05,940
about history is it happens

3197
01:52:05,940 --> 01:52:07,940
and then it's gone. If we don't

3198
01:52:07,940 --> 01:52:09,940
work to preserve it, eventually

3199
01:52:09,940 --> 01:52:11,940
it becomes impossible. To quote a famous

3200
01:52:11,940 --> 01:52:13,940
Nintendo quitscreen,

3201
01:52:13,940 --> 01:52:15,940
everything not saved will be lost.

3202
01:52:15,940 --> 01:52:17,940
And just as a kicker how hard it is to remember

3203
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:19,940
things accurately, the popularized

3204
01:52:19,940 --> 01:52:21,940
version of the quote is wrong. It's actually

3205
01:52:21,940 --> 01:52:23,940
anything not saved. I'm not trying

3206
01:52:23,940 --> 01:52:25,940
to be a pedant for once. It's kind of

3207
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:27,940
poignant how easy it is for things to shift

3208
01:52:27,940 --> 01:52:29,940
like that. If we don't set a precedent

3209
01:52:29,940 --> 01:52:31,940
of taking people's work and the accuracy

3210
01:52:31,940 --> 01:52:33,940
of records of who did what seriously,

3211
01:52:33,940 --> 01:52:35,940
we leave it to the liars and opportunists

3212
01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:37,940
of the world to make up

3213
01:52:37,940 --> 01:52:39,940
that history to the spin-off of a

3214
01:52:39,940 --> 01:52:41,940
beer company to tell us who did what

3215
01:52:41,940 --> 01:52:43,940
and it honestly, on a spiritual

3216
01:52:43,940 --> 01:52:45,940
level, fills me with immense

3217
01:52:45,940 --> 01:52:47,940
grief thinking about the people who made

3218
01:52:47,940 --> 01:52:49,940
the things I care about dying

3219
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:51,940
unrecognized for what they did and being

3220
01:52:51,940 --> 01:52:53,940
forgotten. Gaming is just old

3221
01:52:53,940 --> 01:52:55,940
enough that we're losing that first generation.

3222
01:52:55,940 --> 01:52:57,940
Tommy got the rights to

3223
01:52:57,940 --> 01:52:59,940
Intellivision because he bought them from the estate

3224
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:01,940
of its last president when he passed away.

3225
01:53:01,940 --> 01:53:03,940
The name, the branding, it's his

3226
01:53:03,940 --> 01:53:05,940
now. The original Intellivision

3227
01:53:05,940 --> 01:53:07,940
YouTube channel with some of the final appearances

3228
01:53:07,940 --> 01:53:09,940
of its former president, one of

3229
01:53:09,940 --> 01:53:11,940
the world's first ever game designers

3230
01:53:11,940 --> 01:53:13,940
along with the original Intellivision website

3231
01:53:13,940 --> 01:53:15,940
with its beautiful web 1.0 history

3232
01:53:15,940 --> 01:53:17,940
of the company are now relegated

3233
01:53:17,940 --> 01:53:19,940
to obscurity under another name

3234
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:21,940
while Tommy continues to use

3235
01:53:21,940 --> 01:53:23,940
that name to advertise a product that

3236
01:53:23,940 --> 01:53:25,940
doesn't even exist. The damage

3237
01:53:25,940 --> 01:53:27,940
to a history people are at real risk of forgetting

3238
01:53:27,940 --> 01:53:29,940
whose main characters

3239
01:53:29,940 --> 01:53:31,940
are dying might already

3240
01:53:31,940 --> 01:53:33,940
have been done. What history will look

3241
01:53:33,940 --> 01:53:35,940
like 20, 30, 100 years

3242
01:53:35,940 --> 01:53:37,940
in the future is being decided

3243
01:53:37,940 --> 01:53:39,940
now. Now is the time to

3244
01:53:39,940 --> 01:53:41,940
decide if Tommy Tallarico

3245
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:43,940
made the oomph for Roblox

3246
01:53:43,940 --> 01:53:45,940
or if Joey Kuras made it for Messiah

3247
01:53:45,940 --> 01:53:47,940
and Tommy has already put his finger on the

3248
01:53:47,940 --> 01:53:49,940
scale, decided how he wants all this

3249
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:51,940
to be remembered. If you buy his new

3250
01:53:51,940 --> 01:53:53,940
sound pack, the metadata in the

3251
01:53:53,940 --> 01:53:55,940
Roblox oomph has been changed to say

3252
01:53:55,940 --> 01:53:57,940
Tommy Tallarico. Those who fail

3253
01:53:57,940 --> 01:53:59,940
to learn from history are doomed to

3254
01:53:59,940 --> 01:54:01,940
repeat it. That's a quote commonly

3255
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:03,940
attributed to Winston Churchill, but he

3256
01:54:03,940 --> 01:54:05,940
was actually probably paraphrasing George Santayana.

3257
01:54:05,940 --> 01:54:07,940
That was me being a pedant.

3258
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:09,940
Old habits die hard, but here's a corollary

3259
01:54:09,940 --> 01:54:11,940
I came up with all by myself.

3260
01:54:11,940 --> 01:54:13,940
Those who let hucksters write

3261
01:54:13,940 --> 01:54:15,940
the history they're trying to learn from

3262
01:54:15,940 --> 01:54:17,940
are doomed in some other horrible

3263
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:19,940
way, and for one, I

3264
01:54:19,940 --> 01:54:21,940
don't think history gets to be written by

3265
01:54:21,940 --> 01:54:23,940
a guy who wasn't even on Cribs.

3266
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:25,940
It wasn't even Cribs!

3267
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:27,940
Oh, hello there!

3268
01:54:27,940 --> 01:54:29,940
Thank you for watching this

3269
01:54:29,940 --> 01:54:31,940
30-minute video and a couple of

3270
01:54:31,940 --> 01:54:33,940
other videos.

3271
01:54:33,940 --> 01:54:35,940
I hope you enjoyed it, and I'll see you

3272
01:54:35,940 --> 01:54:37,940
in the next one.

3273
01:54:37,940 --> 01:54:39,940
Bye!

3274
01:54:55,940 --> 01:54:57,940
...accompanying feature-length meltdown.

3275
01:54:57,940 --> 01:54:59,940
The boom mic is slowly, uh,

3276
01:54:59,940 --> 01:55:01,940
peeking into frame.

3277
01:55:01,940 --> 01:55:03,940
Anyway, thank you all so much

3278
01:55:03,940 --> 01:55:05,940
for watching all of this, and, uh,

3279
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:07,940
I hope you had a good time, and

3280
01:55:07,940 --> 01:55:09,940
I hope to see you again soon...

3281
01:55:09,940 --> 01:55:11,940
for once.

3282
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:15,940
...

3283
01:55:15,940 --> 01:55:19,940
...

3284
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:23,940
...

3285
01:55:23,940 --> 01:55:27,940
...

3286
01:55:27,940 --> 01:55:31,940
...

3287
01:55:31,940 --> 01:55:35,940
...

3288
01:55:35,940 --> 01:55:39,940

3289
01:55:39,940 --> 01:55:43,940

...

3292
01:55:51,940 --> 01:55:55,940
...

3293
01:55:55,940 --> 01:55:59,940
...

3294
01:55:59,940 --> 01:56:03,940
...

3295
01:56:03,940 --> 01:56:07,940
...

3296
01:56:07,940 --> 01:56:11,940
...

3297
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:15,940
...

3298
01:56:15,940 --> 01:56:19,940
...

3299
01:56:19,940 --> 01:56:23,940
...

3300
01:56:23,940 --> 01:56:27,940
...

3301
01:56:27,940 --> 01:56:31,940
...

3302
01:56:31,940 --> 01:56:35,940
...

3303
01:56:35,940 --> 01:56:39,940
...

3304
01:56:39,940 --> 01:56:43,940
...

3305
01:56:43,940 --> 01:56:47,940
...

3306
01:56:47,940 --> 01:56:51,940
...

3307
01:56:51,940 --> 01:56:55,940
...

3308
01:56:55,940 --> 01:56:59,940
...

3309
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:01,940
When I bought this, uh,

3310
01:57:01,940 --> 01:57:03,940
gamers edition on eBay, you know, when I was

3311
01:57:03,940 --> 01:57:05,940
flipping through it, a bookmark fell out.

3312
01:57:07,940 --> 01:57:09,940
This is a bookmark for Alexander.

3313
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:11,940
Well done for all your hard work

3314
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:13,940
in year two this year from Miss Dunn.

3315
01:57:13,940 --> 01:57:15,940
Goodbye. So,

3316
01:57:15,940 --> 01:57:17,940
Alexander, uh, I've no

3317
01:57:17,940 --> 01:57:19,940
idea who you are or where you are

3318
01:57:19,940 --> 01:57:21,940
now or if you'll ever watch

3319
01:57:21,940 --> 01:57:23,940
this video. Um...

3320
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:25,940
I hope you made Miss Dunn proud.

3321
01:57:25,940 --> 01:57:27,940
I've no idea how old you are now. This book came out in, like,

3322
01:57:27,940 --> 01:57:29,940
2008. I'm not gonna do the maths on that.

3323
01:57:29,940 --> 01:57:31,940
Um, but if you want your

3324
01:57:31,940 --> 01:57:33,940
bookmark back, email me,

3325
01:57:33,940 --> 01:57:35,940
and I'll happily send it to you.

3326
01:57:35,940 --> 01:57:37,940
Please do email me, in fact, because

3327
01:57:37,940 --> 01:57:39,940
I can't throw this out

3328
01:57:39,940 --> 01:57:41,940
like that would be wrong.

3329
01:57:41,940 --> 01:57:43,940
So this is just gonna be in my life

3330
01:57:43,940 --> 01:57:45,940
forever until someone claims it, so

3331
01:57:45,940 --> 01:57:47,940
please take this back.
