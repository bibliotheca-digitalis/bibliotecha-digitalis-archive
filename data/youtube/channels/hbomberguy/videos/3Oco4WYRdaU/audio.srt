00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,720
Hi, I'm Harris Bomaguy and welcome to Serious Law Analysis.

2
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,400
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

3
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,440
Today we're looking at the truly radical Sonic the Hedgehog.

4
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,240
I remember commercials with people chanting Sonic's name in urban environments like he

5
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,520
was a revolutionary coming to rescue them from their plight, so I grew up assuming Sonic

6
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,400
was some kind of deep social commentary about fighting a revolution against the desolate

7
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,800
urban terror of Americana.

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,320
And after finally playing them, I can tell you that those commercials were spot on.

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,880
Sonic's really dark and serious if you stop to think about it for, like, 12 seconds.

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,720
I mean, let's begin with the name.

11
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,440
He's Sonic the Hedgehog.

12
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,440
Why V?

13
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,560
Because he's the last one.

14
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,280
What happened to all the other hedgehogs?

15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:16,200
Well, maybe the genocide doomsday robots have something to do with it.

16
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,640
The world of Sonic is threatened by the evil Dr. Robotnik.

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,760
But that's in the inferior western dub for the gaijins out there.

18
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,080
In the original Japanese version I got on import, his name is far more thematically

19
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,080
relevant.

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,080
He's called Dr. Eggman.

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:38,560
Because, well, he looks a bit like an egg, don't he?

22
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,360
Robotneggman has almost completely taken over the world of the story with his machines,

23
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,640
leaving very few free animals remaining and doubtlessly killing many others.

24
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,920
Sonic is THE hedgehog because he's the last one.

25
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,120
Sonic has decided to identify with this status, making it his literal title.

26
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,740
It is a message of peace and justice to the free animals that remain, hiding in the cracks

27
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,920
of the world.

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,320
As long as any of them are left, even one, there is still hope.

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,280
But to his enemies, it is a reminder of what they have done, the things they have taken,

30
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,520
and of the sins that will be repaid.

31
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,600
For the forces of darkness, the last hedgehog is like an emissary from hell, an angel of

32
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,760
vengeance.

33
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,480
The level progression functions to represent the transition from the idyllic, prelapsarian

34
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,640
world to the man-made dystopia of Robotnik.

35
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,400
You slowly go from lush greens, rolling fields so free they have NATURALLY OCCURRING LOOP-DE-LOOPS

36
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,720
all the way to the Starlight Zone, a massive industrial superhighway for Robotnik's new

37
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,080
world, where the loop-de-loops are mechanistic and devoid of soul.

38
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,400
The game designers reused the loops just enough that by the time you get to the areas taken

39
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,280
over by Robotnik, they feel like a silly gimmick.

40
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,160
The Mona Lisa used to be a unique, beautiful spectacle that many would come to see for

41
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,520
miles around, hanging in... whatever museum it's in.

42
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,600
But now, you can Google it or get it on a postcard, and the images become replicated

43
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,320
so endlessly that it's meaningless, thus, also, to loop-de-loops.

44
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,340
In mass-producing the loopies, Robotnik has thereby ruined them and reduced their spectacle.

45
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:15,160
It sends a strong message that his world is technologically advanced, but feels fake and

46
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,160
uncanny.

47
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,520
A copy of something beautiful, reused so much that its value is lost.

48
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,200
Or you could say it just represents how SEGA were running out of ideas, which is a pretty

49
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,200
accurate reading, probably, but in the words of Roland Barthes,

50
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
FUCK OFF!

51
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
JUST FUCK OFF, ALRIGHT?

52
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,760
IT WORKS AS A METAPHOR, AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME!

53
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,520
At the end of each level, instead of taking over the castle of an inferior king and raising

54
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,000
the flag of his personal favorite in the style of a certain authoritarian monarchist war

55
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,960
Sonic simply graffitis over a sign with Robotnik's face on it, in an act of pure symbolic protest.

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,000
This is important characterization for Sonic, Sonic's devil-may-care attitude as a method

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,400
of dealing with the utmost depression he feels fighting a near-impossible battle as he copes

58
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,240
with the loss of his race.

59
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,920
Imagine having to get up every morning and fight a one-man revolution knowing that you'll

60
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:06,380
never have a hedgehog wife to hug, 2.5 hedgehog children to watch get on the bus to school,

61
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,640
or a white picket fence and fluffy hedgehog dog.

62
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,640
Hedge dog.

63
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,400
All those moments will be lost in time, like my train of thought once I thought of the

64
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,960
pun hedge dog.

65
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,440
What a terrifying fate to have to live with every day.

66
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,900
That's why Sonic goes into the fetal position every time he attacks.

67
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,760
Every moment of his battle is an attempt to stave off his existential angst.

68
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:32,080
Beneath that happy smiley and waggy finger lies a hearty serving of depressive personality

69
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,080
disorders.

70
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,920
More like Sonic the Herzog, am I right?

71
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,680
Death is certain.

72
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,600
After crossing the highways and miraculously not getting run over like most actual hedgehogs

73
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:50,320
I've seen on the motorway, Sonic enters the Scrap Brain Zone.

74
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,760
One giant literal machine, a nightmare of steam and steel.

75
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,220
The Scrap Brain Zone is Eggman's vision for the future, a world of grim uniformity

76
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,320
and pure order, everything in its rightful place but devoid of life or a soul.

77
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,480
This zone features numerous allusions to the Charlie Chaplin film Modern Times, specifically

78
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,040
the sequence where Chaplin's character falls onto the conveyor belt he works on and into

79
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,280
the machine within.

80
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,880
It spits him out as a bizarre, monstrous version of his former self, his mind warped by the

81
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,880
experience.

82
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,520
This was a metaphor for the effects of capitalism's work environments on its workers.

83
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,280
It literally altered them, made them more like machines themselves.

84
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,920
Chaplin would revisit this idea in The Great Dictator, in which the Nazi ideology metaphorically

85
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,280
turned people into machines with machine minds and machine hearts but not machine penises

86
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,920
because robots don't need to have sex, the poor bastards.

87
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,080
There, I've just taught you everything you need to know about film interpretation.

88
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,740
Now you can share my degree and my unpayable amounts of debt!

89
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,520
As a true successor to Chaplin, Sonic is fighting a battle against the evil robots in order

90
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,800
to free the good people trapped within them.

91
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,080
Inside the heart of your enemy is a good person who has lost their way.

92
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,080
But you can't make a freedom omelette without breaking a few Robotniks.

93
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,320
Robotnik leads Sonic into a trap and then violates the Geneva Convention by attempting

94
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,440
to kill a prisoner of war.

95
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,520
Oh, no.

96
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,320
Sonic falls into the garbage dump, a reappropriated piece of the labyrinth that runs throughout

97
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,560
the planet, covered in sewage, and the water's tinted purple by the pollution spewing from

98
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,760
the machines above.

99
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,780
Luckily, Robotnik left a spring here that leads directly into his office.

100
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,800
I'm not sure what this is a metaphor for, and the Sonic Wiki is too busy figuring out

101
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Robotnik's canon-heightened weight to figure out the implications of the spring that causes

102
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,080
Sonic not to die in an otherwise inescapable sewer.

103
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,880
But don't worry, we've carefully chronicled that he's 282 pounds and his skin is beige.

104
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,680
Yes, that is a word that we use to describe colors of skin.

105
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,680
Yeah, yeah.

106
00:06:43,680 --> 00:07:06,360
At last, it's over.

107
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,120
Robotnik's dead?

108
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,160
Okay, look, I was told this game was for children, right?

109
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:32,120
But I just helped the last of an extinct race gank a dictator by sabotaging his flying hoverchair

110
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:40,760
thing and watching as he crashes and burns and dies in the immolating flames of vengeance.

111
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,280
What kind of child is supposed to play this?

112
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,400
Officially an actual, literal murderer, Sonic returns home to a hero's welcome and leaps

113
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,720
towards the screen, thanking the player directly for their help, making you complicit in an

114
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,120
act of terror.

115
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,320
With Eggman dead, all that's left of civilization is a bunch of tiny animals who'll probably

116
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,240
need years of therapy to undo the horrors of being trapped in a machine and forced to

117
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,600
watch it destroy their entire family.

118
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,160
But if you got all the Chaos Emeralds, there's a couple more flowers.

119
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,160
Aw, that's nice.

120
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,200
Sonic the Hedgehog is a surprisingly morally complex story about the importance of extrajudicial

121
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,160
murder, and there's some deeply resonant themes going on in there about man's battle with

122
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,360
the machine.

123
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,640
You can't really rate depth on any kind of scale, because it's a kind of nebulous concept

124
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:31,680
to begin with, but if you could, I would give Sonic the Hedgehog a 7.5 out of 10.

125
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,040
On the depth scale that I just made up.

126
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,800
It asks a vital question of our society.

127
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,320
Is it right to unleash bloody war and death against authoritarianism?

128
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,440
And it answers, yes, definitely.

129
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,920
Fucking kill those guys.

130
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,120
You can say that Blair and Bush's invasion of Iraq had a needlessly high civilian death

131
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,120
toll and ignored the will of the international community and they deserved to be locked up,

132
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,160
and you'd be right, but you can't say they aren't 90s kids at heart.

133
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,200
By which I mean, if they had a single heart between them, they probably stole it from

134
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,600
a child.

135
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,200
If you have a suggestion for the next game you want me to do a deep lore analysis of,

136
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,400
please let me know in the comments, and I'll look for the one that's the one I already

137
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,560
wanted to do and pretend you picked it.

138
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
See you around!

139
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:54,360
Oh, hey, thanks for watching.

140
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,400
This week I'd like to thank...

141
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,560
Joseph Grieco

142
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,280
Two Armed Blues and Red Drapes

143
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,840
Zachariah Taylor

144
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,040
I Am Turnip

145
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,280
and Rick Hemi

146
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,640
Thanks so much, and...

147
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,240
Fucking eyes are killing me.
