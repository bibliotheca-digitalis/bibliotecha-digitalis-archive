0	22720	Hi, I'm Harris Bomaguy and welcome to Serious Law Analysis.
22720	28400	It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
28400	33440	Today we're looking at the truly radical Sonic the Hedgehog.
33440	37240	I remember commercials with people chanting Sonic's name in urban environments like he
37240	41520	was a revolutionary coming to rescue them from their plight, so I grew up assuming Sonic
41520	46400	was some kind of deep social commentary about fighting a revolution against the desolate
46400	47800	urban terror of Americana.
47800	52320	And after finally playing them, I can tell you that those commercials were spot on.
52320	57880	Sonic's really dark and serious if you stop to think about it for, like, 12 seconds.
57880	59720	I mean, let's begin with the name.
59720	62440	He's Sonic the Hedgehog.
62440	63440	Why V?
63440	65560	Because he's the last one.
65560	67280	What happened to all the other hedgehogs?
67280	76200	Well, maybe the genocide doomsday robots have something to do with it.
76200	80640	The world of Sonic is threatened by the evil Dr. Robotnik.
80640	84760	But that's in the inferior western dub for the gaijins out there.
84760	89080	In the original Japanese version I got on import, his name is far more thematically
89080	90080	relevant.
90080	91080	He's called Dr. Eggman.
91080	98560	Because, well, he looks a bit like an egg, don't he?
98560	102360	Robotneggman has almost completely taken over the world of the story with his machines,
102360	106640	leaving very few free animals remaining and doubtlessly killing many others.
106640	109920	Sonic is THE hedgehog because he's the last one.
109920	114120	Sonic has decided to identify with this status, making it his literal title.
114120	118740	It is a message of peace and justice to the free animals that remain, hiding in the cracks
118740	119920	of the world.
119920	123320	As long as any of them are left, even one, there is still hope.
123320	128280	But to his enemies, it is a reminder of what they have done, the things they have taken,
128280	130520	and of the sins that will be repaid.
130520	135600	For the forces of darkness, the last hedgehog is like an emissary from hell, an angel of
135600	140760	vengeance.
140760	144480	The level progression functions to represent the transition from the idyllic, prelapsarian
144480	147640	world to the man-made dystopia of Robotnik.
147640	153400	You slowly go from lush greens, rolling fields so free they have NATURALLY OCCURRING LOOP-DE-LOOPS
153400	158720	all the way to the Starlight Zone, a massive industrial superhighway for Robotnik's new
158720	162080	world, where the loop-de-loops are mechanistic and devoid of soul.
162080	166400	The game designers reused the loops just enough that by the time you get to the areas taken
166400	169280	over by Robotnik, they feel like a silly gimmick.
169280	173160	The Mona Lisa used to be a unique, beautiful spectacle that many would come to see for
173160	176520	miles around, hanging in... whatever museum it's in.
176520	180600	But now, you can Google it or get it on a postcard, and the images become replicated
180600	185320	so endlessly that it's meaningless, thus, also, to loop-de-loops.
185320	190340	In mass-producing the loopies, Robotnik has thereby ruined them and reduced their spectacle.
190340	195160	It sends a strong message that his world is technologically advanced, but feels fake and
195160	196160	uncanny.
196160	200520	A copy of something beautiful, reused so much that its value is lost.
200520	204200	Or you could say it just represents how SEGA were running out of ideas, which is a pretty
204200	207200	accurate reading, probably, but in the words of Roland Barthes,
207200	208200	FUCK OFF!
208200	209200	JUST FUCK OFF, ALRIGHT?
209200	212760	IT WORKS AS A METAPHOR, AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME!
212760	216520	At the end of each level, instead of taking over the castle of an inferior king and raising
216520	221000	the flag of his personal favorite in the style of a certain authoritarian monarchist war
221480	226960	Sonic simply graffitis over a sign with Robotnik's face on it, in an act of pure symbolic protest.
226960	231000	This is important characterization for Sonic, Sonic's devil-may-care attitude as a method
231000	235400	of dealing with the utmost depression he feels fighting a near-impossible battle as he copes
235400	237240	with the loss of his race.
237240	240920	Imagine having to get up every morning and fight a one-man revolution knowing that you'll
240920	246380	never have a hedgehog wife to hug, 2.5 hedgehog children to watch get on the bus to school,
246380	249640	or a white picket fence and fluffy hedgehog dog.
249640	250640	Hedge dog.
250640	254400	All those moments will be lost in time, like my train of thought once I thought of the
254400	255960	pun hedge dog.
255960	258440	What a terrifying fate to have to live with every day.
258440	261900	That's why Sonic goes into the fetal position every time he attacks.
261900	266760	Every moment of his battle is an attempt to stave off his existential angst.
266760	272080	Beneath that happy smiley and waggy finger lies a hearty serving of depressive personality
272080	273080	disorders.
273080	275920	More like Sonic the Herzog, am I right?
275920	277680	Death is certain.
277680	281600	After crossing the highways and miraculously not getting run over like most actual hedgehogs
281600	290320	I've seen on the motorway, Sonic enters the Scrap Brain Zone.
290320	294760	One giant literal machine, a nightmare of steam and steel.
294760	299220	The Scrap Brain Zone is Eggman's vision for the future, a world of grim uniformity
299220	304320	and pure order, everything in its rightful place but devoid of life or a soul.
304320	308480	This zone features numerous allusions to the Charlie Chaplin film Modern Times, specifically
308480	312040	the sequence where Chaplin's character falls onto the conveyor belt he works on and into
312040	313280	the machine within.
313280	317880	It spits him out as a bizarre, monstrous version of his former self, his mind warped by the
317880	318880	experience.
318880	322520	This was a metaphor for the effects of capitalism's work environments on its workers.
322520	326280	It literally altered them, made them more like machines themselves.
326280	329920	Chaplin would revisit this idea in The Great Dictator, in which the Nazi ideology metaphorically
329920	334280	turned people into machines with machine minds and machine hearts but not machine penises
334280	336920	because robots don't need to have sex, the poor bastards.
336920	341080	There, I've just taught you everything you need to know about film interpretation.
341080	344740	Now you can share my degree and my unpayable amounts of debt!
344740	348520	As a true successor to Chaplin, Sonic is fighting a battle against the evil robots in order
348520	350800	to free the good people trapped within them.
350800	354080	Inside the heart of your enemy is a good person who has lost their way.
354080	359080	But you can't make a freedom omelette without breaking a few Robotniks.
359080	364320	Robotnik leads Sonic into a trap and then violates the Geneva Convention by attempting
364320	366440	to kill a prisoner of war.
366440	368520	Oh, no.
368520	372320	Sonic falls into the garbage dump, a reappropriated piece of the labyrinth that runs throughout
372320	377560	the planet, covered in sewage, and the water's tinted purple by the pollution spewing from
377560	378760	the machines above.
378760	382780	Luckily, Robotnik left a spring here that leads directly into his office.
382780	386800	I'm not sure what this is a metaphor for, and the Sonic Wiki is too busy figuring out
386800	390800	Robotnik's canon-heightened weight to figure out the implications of the spring that causes
390800	394080	Sonic not to die in an otherwise inescapable sewer.
394080	398880	But don't worry, we've carefully chronicled that he's 282 pounds and his skin is beige.
398880	402680	Yes, that is a word that we use to describe colors of skin.
402680	403680	Yeah, yeah.
403680	426360	At last, it's over.
433680	440120	Robotnik's dead?
440120	444160	Okay, look, I was told this game was for children, right?
444160	452120	But I just helped the last of an extinct race gank a dictator by sabotaging his flying hoverchair
452120	460760	thing and watching as he crashes and burns and dies in the immolating flames of vengeance.
460760	463280	What kind of child is supposed to play this?
463280	468400	Officially an actual, literal murderer, Sonic returns home to a hero's welcome and leaps
468400	472720	towards the screen, thanking the player directly for their help, making you complicit in an
472720	474120	act of terror.
474120	478320	With Eggman dead, all that's left of civilization is a bunch of tiny animals who'll probably
478320	482240	need years of therapy to undo the horrors of being trapped in a machine and forced to
482240	484600	watch it destroy their entire family.
484600	487160	But if you got all the Chaos Emeralds, there's a couple more flowers.
487160	489160	Aw, that's nice.
489160	494200	Sonic the Hedgehog is a surprisingly morally complex story about the importance of extrajudicial
494200	499160	murder, and there's some deeply resonant themes going on in there about man's battle with
499160	500360	the machine.
500360	505640	You can't really rate depth on any kind of scale, because it's a kind of nebulous concept
505640	511680	to begin with, but if you could, I would give Sonic the Hedgehog a 7.5 out of 10.
511680	514040	On the depth scale that I just made up.
514040	516800	It asks a vital question of our society.
516800	521320	Is it right to unleash bloody war and death against authoritarianism?
521320	524440	And it answers, yes, definitely.
524440	526920	Fucking kill those guys.
526920	531120	You can say that Blair and Bush's invasion of Iraq had a needlessly high civilian death
531120	535120	toll and ignored the will of the international community and they deserved to be locked up,
535120	539160	and you'd be right, but you can't say they aren't 90s kids at heart.
539160	543200	By which I mean, if they had a single heart between them, they probably stole it from
543200	545600	a child.
545600	549200	If you have a suggestion for the next game you want me to do a deep lore analysis of,
549200	552400	please let me know in the comments, and I'll look for the one that's the one I already
552400	554560	wanted to do and pretend you picked it.
554560	555560	See you around!
569160	594360	Oh, hey, thanks for watching.
594360	595400	This week I'd like to thank...
624360	626560	Joseph Grieco
654360	656280	Two Armed Blues and Red Drapes
656280	657840	Zachariah Taylor
657840	659040	I Am Turnip
659040	660280	and Rick Hemi
660280	662640	Thanks so much, and...
665000	666240	Fucking eyes are killing me.
