00:00.000 --> 00:22.720
Hi, I'm Harris Bomaguy and welcome to Serious Law Analysis.

00:22.720 --> 00:28.400
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

00:28.400 --> 00:33.440
Today we're looking at the truly radical Sonic the Hedgehog.

00:33.440 --> 00:37.240
I remember commercials with people chanting Sonic's name in urban environments like he

00:37.240 --> 00:41.520
was a revolutionary coming to rescue them from their plight, so I grew up assuming Sonic

00:41.520 --> 00:46.400
was some kind of deep social commentary about fighting a revolution against the desolate

00:46.400 --> 00:47.800
urban terror of Americana.

00:47.800 --> 00:52.320
And after finally playing them, I can tell you that those commercials were spot on.

00:52.320 --> 00:57.880
Sonic's really dark and serious if you stop to think about it for, like, 12 seconds.

00:57.880 --> 00:59.720
I mean, let's begin with the name.

00:59.720 --> 01:02.440
He's Sonic the Hedgehog.

01:02.440 --> 01:03.440
Why V?

01:03.440 --> 01:05.560
Because he's the last one.

01:05.560 --> 01:07.280
What happened to all the other hedgehogs?

01:07.280 --> 01:16.200
Well, maybe the genocide doomsday robots have something to do with it.

01:16.200 --> 01:20.640
The world of Sonic is threatened by the evil Dr. Robotnik.

01:20.640 --> 01:24.760
But that's in the inferior western dub for the gaijins out there.

01:24.760 --> 01:29.080
In the original Japanese version I got on import, his name is far more thematically

01:29.080 --> 01:30.080
relevant.

01:30.080 --> 01:31.080
He's called Dr. Eggman.

01:31.080 --> 01:38.560
Because, well, he looks a bit like an egg, don't he?

01:38.560 --> 01:42.360
Robotneggman has almost completely taken over the world of the story with his machines,

01:42.360 --> 01:46.640
leaving very few free animals remaining and doubtlessly killing many others.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.920
Sonic is THE hedgehog because he's the last one.

01:49.920 --> 01:54.120
Sonic has decided to identify with this status, making it his literal title.

01:54.120 --> 01:58.740
It is a message of peace and justice to the free animals that remain, hiding in the cracks

01:58.740 --> 01:59.920
of the world.

01:59.920 --> 02:03.320
As long as any of them are left, even one, there is still hope.

02:03.320 --> 02:08.280
But to his enemies, it is a reminder of what they have done, the things they have taken,

02:08.280 --> 02:10.520
and of the sins that will be repaid.

02:10.520 --> 02:15.600
For the forces of darkness, the last hedgehog is like an emissary from hell, an angel of

02:15.600 --> 02:20.760
vengeance.

02:20.760 --> 02:24.480
The level progression functions to represent the transition from the idyllic, prelapsarian

02:24.480 --> 02:27.640
world to the man-made dystopia of Robotnik.

02:27.640 --> 02:33.400
You slowly go from lush greens, rolling fields so free they have NATURALLY OCCURRING LOOP-DE-LOOPS

02:33.400 --> 02:38.720
all the way to the Starlight Zone, a massive industrial superhighway for Robotnik's new

02:38.720 --> 02:42.080
world, where the loop-de-loops are mechanistic and devoid of soul.

02:42.080 --> 02:46.400
The game designers reused the loops just enough that by the time you get to the areas taken

02:46.400 --> 02:49.280
over by Robotnik, they feel like a silly gimmick.

02:49.280 --> 02:53.160
The Mona Lisa used to be a unique, beautiful spectacle that many would come to see for

02:53.160 --> 02:56.520
miles around, hanging in... whatever museum it's in.

02:56.520 --> 03:00.600
But now, you can Google it or get it on a postcard, and the images become replicated

03:00.600 --> 03:05.320
so endlessly that it's meaningless, thus, also, to loop-de-loops.

03:05.320 --> 03:10.340
In mass-producing the loopies, Robotnik has thereby ruined them and reduced their spectacle.

03:10.340 --> 03:15.160
It sends a strong message that his world is technologically advanced, but feels fake and

03:15.160 --> 03:16.160
uncanny.

03:16.160 --> 03:20.520
A copy of something beautiful, reused so much that its value is lost.

03:20.520 --> 03:24.200
Or you could say it just represents how SEGA were running out of ideas, which is a pretty

03:24.200 --> 03:27.200
accurate reading, probably, but in the words of Roland Barthes,

03:27.200 --> 03:28.200
FUCK OFF!

03:28.200 --> 03:29.200
JUST FUCK OFF, ALRIGHT?

03:29.200 --> 03:32.760
IT WORKS AS A METAPHOR, AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME!

03:32.760 --> 03:36.520
At the end of each level, instead of taking over the castle of an inferior king and raising

03:36.520 --> 03:41.000
the flag of his personal favorite in the style of a certain authoritarian monarchist war

03:41.480 --> 03:46.960
Sonic simply graffitis over a sign with Robotnik's face on it, in an act of pure symbolic protest.

03:46.960 --> 03:51.000
This is important characterization for Sonic, Sonic's devil-may-care attitude as a method

03:51.000 --> 03:55.400
of dealing with the utmost depression he feels fighting a near-impossible battle as he copes

03:55.400 --> 03:57.240
with the loss of his race.

03:57.240 --> 04:00.920
Imagine having to get up every morning and fight a one-man revolution knowing that you'll

04:00.920 --> 04:06.380
never have a hedgehog wife to hug, 2.5 hedgehog children to watch get on the bus to school,

04:06.380 --> 04:09.640
or a white picket fence and fluffy hedgehog dog.

04:09.640 --> 04:10.640
Hedge dog.

04:10.640 --> 04:14.400
All those moments will be lost in time, like my train of thought once I thought of the

04:14.400 --> 04:15.960
pun hedge dog.

04:15.960 --> 04:18.440
What a terrifying fate to have to live with every day.

04:18.440 --> 04:21.900
That's why Sonic goes into the fetal position every time he attacks.

04:21.900 --> 04:26.760
Every moment of his battle is an attempt to stave off his existential angst.

04:26.760 --> 04:32.080
Beneath that happy smiley and waggy finger lies a hearty serving of depressive personality

04:32.080 --> 04:33.080
disorders.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.920
More like Sonic the Herzog, am I right?

04:35.920 --> 04:37.680
Death is certain.

04:37.680 --> 04:41.600
After crossing the highways and miraculously not getting run over like most actual hedgehogs

04:41.600 --> 04:50.320
I've seen on the motorway, Sonic enters the Scrap Brain Zone.

04:50.320 --> 04:54.760
One giant literal machine, a nightmare of steam and steel.

04:54.760 --> 04:59.220
The Scrap Brain Zone is Eggman's vision for the future, a world of grim uniformity

04:59.220 --> 05:04.320
and pure order, everything in its rightful place but devoid of life or a soul.

05:04.320 --> 05:08.480
This zone features numerous allusions to the Charlie Chaplin film Modern Times, specifically

05:08.480 --> 05:12.040
the sequence where Chaplin's character falls onto the conveyor belt he works on and into

05:12.040 --> 05:13.280
the machine within.

05:13.280 --> 05:17.880
It spits him out as a bizarre, monstrous version of his former self, his mind warped by the

05:17.880 --> 05:18.880
experience.

05:18.880 --> 05:22.520
This was a metaphor for the effects of capitalism's work environments on its workers.

05:22.520 --> 05:26.280
It literally altered them, made them more like machines themselves.

05:26.280 --> 05:29.920
Chaplin would revisit this idea in The Great Dictator, in which the Nazi ideology metaphorically

05:29.920 --> 05:34.280
turned people into machines with machine minds and machine hearts but not machine penises

05:34.280 --> 05:36.920
because robots don't need to have sex, the poor bastards.

05:36.920 --> 05:41.080
There, I've just taught you everything you need to know about film interpretation.

05:41.080 --> 05:44.740
Now you can share my degree and my unpayable amounts of debt!

05:44.740 --> 05:48.520
As a true successor to Chaplin, Sonic is fighting a battle against the evil robots in order

05:48.520 --> 05:50.800
to free the good people trapped within them.

05:50.800 --> 05:54.080
Inside the heart of your enemy is a good person who has lost their way.

05:54.080 --> 05:59.080
But you can't make a freedom omelette without breaking a few Robotniks.

05:59.080 --> 06:04.320
Robotnik leads Sonic into a trap and then violates the Geneva Convention by attempting

06:04.320 --> 06:06.440
to kill a prisoner of war.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.520
Oh, no.

06:08.520 --> 06:12.320
Sonic falls into the garbage dump, a reappropriated piece of the labyrinth that runs throughout

06:12.320 --> 06:17.560
the planet, covered in sewage, and the water's tinted purple by the pollution spewing from

06:17.560 --> 06:18.760
the machines above.

06:18.760 --> 06:22.780
Luckily, Robotnik left a spring here that leads directly into his office.

06:22.780 --> 06:26.800
I'm not sure what this is a metaphor for, and the Sonic Wiki is too busy figuring out

06:26.800 --> 06:30.800
Robotnik's canon-heightened weight to figure out the implications of the spring that causes

06:30.800 --> 06:34.080
Sonic not to die in an otherwise inescapable sewer.

06:34.080 --> 06:38.880
But don't worry, we've carefully chronicled that he's 282 pounds and his skin is beige.

06:38.880 --> 06:42.680
Yes, that is a word that we use to describe colors of skin.

06:42.680 --> 06:43.680
Yeah, yeah.

06:43.680 --> 07:06.360
At last, it's over.

07:13.680 --> 07:20.120
Robotnik's dead?

07:20.120 --> 07:24.160
Okay, look, I was told this game was for children, right?

07:24.160 --> 07:32.120
But I just helped the last of an extinct race gank a dictator by sabotaging his flying hoverchair

07:32.120 --> 07:40.760
thing and watching as he crashes and burns and dies in the immolating flames of vengeance.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.280
What kind of child is supposed to play this?

07:43.280 --> 07:48.400
Officially an actual, literal murderer, Sonic returns home to a hero's welcome and leaps

07:48.400 --> 07:52.720
towards the screen, thanking the player directly for their help, making you complicit in an

07:52.720 --> 07:54.120
act of terror.

07:54.120 --> 07:58.320
With Eggman dead, all that's left of civilization is a bunch of tiny animals who'll probably

07:58.320 --> 08:02.240
need years of therapy to undo the horrors of being trapped in a machine and forced to

08:02.240 --> 08:04.600
watch it destroy their entire family.

08:04.600 --> 08:07.160
But if you got all the Chaos Emeralds, there's a couple more flowers.

08:07.160 --> 08:09.160
Aw, that's nice.

08:09.160 --> 08:14.200
Sonic the Hedgehog is a surprisingly morally complex story about the importance of extrajudicial

08:14.200 --> 08:19.160
murder, and there's some deeply resonant themes going on in there about man's battle with

08:19.160 --> 08:20.360
the machine.

08:20.360 --> 08:25.640
You can't really rate depth on any kind of scale, because it's a kind of nebulous concept

08:25.640 --> 08:31.680
to begin with, but if you could, I would give Sonic the Hedgehog a 7.5 out of 10.

08:31.680 --> 08:34.040
On the depth scale that I just made up.

08:34.040 --> 08:36.800
It asks a vital question of our society.

08:36.800 --> 08:41.320
Is it right to unleash bloody war and death against authoritarianism?

08:41.320 --> 08:44.440
And it answers, yes, definitely.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.920
Fucking kill those guys.

08:46.920 --> 08:51.120
You can say that Blair and Bush's invasion of Iraq had a needlessly high civilian death

08:51.120 --> 08:55.120
toll and ignored the will of the international community and they deserved to be locked up,

08:55.120 --> 08:59.160
and you'd be right, but you can't say they aren't 90s kids at heart.

08:59.160 --> 09:03.200
By which I mean, if they had a single heart between them, they probably stole it from

09:03.200 --> 09:05.600
a child.

09:05.600 --> 09:09.200
If you have a suggestion for the next game you want me to do a deep lore analysis of,

09:09.200 --> 09:12.400
please let me know in the comments, and I'll look for the one that's the one I already

09:12.400 --> 09:14.560
wanted to do and pretend you picked it.

09:14.560 --> 09:15.560
See you around!

09:29.160 --> 09:54.360
Oh, hey, thanks for watching.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.400
This week I'd like to thank...

10:24.360 --> 10:26.560
Joseph Grieco

10:54.360 --> 10:56.280
Two Armed Blues and Red Drapes

10:56.280 --> 10:57.840
Zachariah Taylor

10:57.840 --> 10:59.040
I Am Turnip

10:59.040 --> 11:00.280
and Rick Hemi

11:00.280 --> 11:02.640
Thanks so much, and...

11:05.000 --> 11:06.240
Fucking eyes are killing me.
