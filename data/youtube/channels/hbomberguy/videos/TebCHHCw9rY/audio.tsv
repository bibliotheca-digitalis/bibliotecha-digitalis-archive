0	7000	Hi, I'm Harriton Splimby, and welcome to Serious Law Analysis.
31000	33000	Oh, fucking...
34000	36000	Just... fucking...
60000	63000	You will pay for what you have done.
91000	92000	...
92000	93000	...
93000	94000	...
94000	95000	...
95000	96000	...
96000	98000	Today on Serious Law Analysis,
98000	101000	we're covering a creative work that I heavily implied
101000	104000	might have been coming next in the last few videos.
104000	106000	And that's right, today we're covering
106000	109000	the Control-Alt-Delete Webcomic and Animated series.
109000	112000	In retrospect, I think I might have made it too obvious.
112000	116000	For those of you too young to remember the early days of the world,
116000	119000	before we had the Internet and hadn't yet achieved the dream
119000	121000	of having to argue with Holocaust deniers all day,
121000	125000	humans would amuse themselves by painting stuff on the walls of their caves
125000	128000	or later drawing it onto paper or canvas.
128000	130000	These scribbles became known as...
130000	133000	...
133000	136000	Eventually, however, humans evolved past this bullshit
136000	140000	and realized you could divide up your space into smaller subspaces
140000	144000	called Parnells and then use that to create several sequential images,
144000	146000	which when read in order could tell a story.
146000	149000	This sequence art later became known as comics
149000	152000	for reasons we forgot because it doesn't matter.
152000	154000	Fast forward to the late 90s and early 2000s
154000	157000	where we played video games and things were finally good.
157000	160000	Then people who enjoyed video games gained access to the Internet.
160000	162000	But because they didn't yet have the bandwidth
162000	165000	to play most games online or watch puppy compilations all day
165000	167000	and argue in the comments about 9-11,
167000	171000	people instead would amuse themselves online by using webcomics,
171000	175000	also known as digital versions of comics that you find on the web.
175000	178000	And since the bar for publishing onto the Internet
178000	180000	was as low as being able to afford server hosting
180000	182000	or even lower if you used a free website,
182000	184000	people were finally free to create comics
184000	187000	for a small or niche in audiences they liked
187000	189000	without any need for mass market appeal
189000	192000	or the production costs of ink and paper and printing
192000	194000	or, um, quality.
194000	196000	Enter the gaming webcomic,
196000	200000	a form of webcomic centering around jokes about games and gaming culture,
200000	202000	the most popular of these was Penny Arcade,
202000	204000	a comic still going to this day,
204000	207000	rife with hilarious and well-thought-out humor.
207000	209000	Don't state me, bro! Ha ha ha!
209000	212000	Hilarious! It's just like the thing!
212000	214000	With the guy!
216000	219000	The bedrock of this type of comic tends to feature several characters,
219000	221000	often representative of the authors,
221000	223000	sitting on a couch making hilarious jokes
223000	225000	about video games that are out right now
225000	227000	or inside the fiction of a video game
227000	229000	interacting with it to hilarious consequences.
229000	231000	These two forms were the bedrock
231000	233000	of many early gaming webcomics
233000	235000	from the late 90s to the early 2000s,
235000	237000	and there were many successful comics using this format
237000	240000	like Penny Arcade, PvP, Little Gamers,
240000	242000	Bob & George, 8-Bit Theater, and others.
242000	244000	All tremendous pieces of art
244000	246000	with a lot to say about games
246000	249000	and how bad it is that our games are being usurped by money men
249000	251000	and how funny it would be if you died
251000	254000	in a way a lot bigger like it's just like in the game.
254000	256000	But for every one of these comics,
256000	258000	there were dozens of poor imitators
258000	260000	out to replicate their popularity and profit
260000	262000	by reusing the same tropes.
262000	265000	An explosion in the gaming webcomic had begun,
265000	267000	and it would continue for over a decade.
267000	270000	Enter Tim Buckley with his own webcomic,
270000	272000	Control-Alt-Delete, often referred to as CAD.
272000	274000	CAD isn't like the other webcomics.
274000	277000	It's not art. It doesn't have value or meaning.
277000	280000	It's trash, and it doesn't say anything at all.
280000	283000	It's full of worthless jokes where the punchline is violence.
283000	287000	It's not like Penny Arcade. CAD is the story of Ethan,
287000	289000	a character who looks suspiciously like
289000	291000	how Buckley draws himself.
291000	293000	Ethan and his roommate Lucas talk about video games
293000	295000	and occasionally are inside the games
295000	297000	where something bad happens to them or people they don't like.
297000	299000	Wow, that's original.
299000	302000	Let's compare and contrast this with a good comic, shall we?
302000	304000	In this 2002 page from Penny Arcade,
304000	306000	the author insert characters burn a voodoo doll
306000	308000	hurting George Romero.
308000	310000	Oh, my God, look how much better these guys are.
310000	312000	This is great. Meanwhile, look over here
312000	314000	at CAD in the slow lane for Idiots
314000	316000	using violence as a punchline.
316000	319000	What a stupid thing to put in a comic.
319000	322000	Over time, CAD stopped even trying to tell jokes,
322000	324000	and it started spending more and more time exploring
324000	327000	the personal lives and development of its characters.
327000	329000	The main characters, Ethan and Lucas, went on dates,
329000	331000	moved apartments, made and lost friends,
331000	333000	and started long-term relationships.
333000	336000	Ethan quickly meets and begins dating Lila,
336000	338000	a girl who plays video games, which, as we all know,
338000	340000	is like finding a unicorn,
340000	342000	and like all girls who do play games,
342000	343000	it's her only character trait.
343000	345000	The two inexplicably fall in love
345000	347000	even though Ethan has nothing to offer anyone
347000	348000	and is basically unlikable.
348000	350000	It's pretty clear from reading this
350000	353000	that Buckley doesn't know how human relationships work.
353000	355000	You could almost point out this...
355000	357000	almost says something
357000	359000	about how people who play video games a lot
359000	361000	view human relationships, but...
365000	367000	No, no, no, no, no.
367000	370000	No, it's bad, and it doesn't mean anything.
370000	373000	Tim Buckley's just really bad at making comics.
373000	375000	Oh, also, despite being basically unable
375000	377000	to do anything but play video games,
377000	380000	Ethan eventually builds a sentient AI robot
380000	382000	who becomes the fourth main character.
382000	384000	Zeke exists to occasionally joke
384000	386000	about how humans are made of meat and bad
386000	387000	and he's better than them.
387000	389000	It's clearly inspired by characters
389000	392000	like HK-47 from KOTOR or Bender from Futurama,
392000	394000	but there's no actual jokes here.
394000	396000	It's what I like to call a joke by association.
396000	397000	It's not really a joke.
397000	399000	It's just a vague gesture
399000	401000	in the direction of a joke
401000	403000	that you might remember from somewhere else.
405000	407000	Somewhere else.
408000	410000	I'm somewhere else.
423000	425000	Why are you doing this?
426000	428000	Don't do this to yourself.
428000	430000	Don't become one of them.
431000	433000	One of what?
438000	440000	The worst thing about this comic
440000	443000	is that it doesn't know what it wants to be.
443000	444000	No, wait.
444000	446000	Actually, the worst thing is CAD Premium.
446000	449000	For a few years, you could pay a monthly fee
449000	452000	to get access to episodes of the CAD animated series,
452000	455000	which the comic inexplicably had.
455000	457000	It ran for two seasons,
457000	459000	and some episodes ran up to six minutes.
459000	462000	If you thought a story featuring cartoon violence,
462000	464000	a futuristic killer robot,
464000	466000	video game opinions on a couch,
466000	469000	and awkward, boring, serious relationship drama
469000	471000	had trouble finding its identity in comic form,
471000	473000	just wait until it comes in a box set
473000	475000	containing barely two hours of animation
475000	477000	made in about a week that you paid
477000	481000	35 entire dollars of your actual human money for.
481000	483000	Three episodes of the 12-episode first season
483000	487000	are dedicated entirely to an extended Star Wars reference.
487000	489000	They reenact an entire Star Wars film
489000	491000	in each five-minute episode,
491000	493000	compressing it down so much you'd barely even realize
493000	495000	that's what they're doing unless you listen
495000	496000	to the director's commentary track,
496000	499000	which this show has for some reason.
499000	501000	The villain, instead of Darth Vader,
501000	504000	is Jack Thompson, a lawyer who tried to sue game developers
504000	506000	for making their players violent.
506000	509000	The Death Star is a sign that makes people
509000	511000	stop playing video games?
511000	513000	It's time to test the power
513000	517000	of this fully operational anti-gamer billboard.
517000	518000	Speaking of Jack Thompson,
518000	520000	Thompson appeared to have struck a nerve with Buckley.
520000	522000	One page of the comic is straight-up
522000	523000	an open letter to Jack,
523000	525000	a four-panel, long mini-novel
525000	527000	spoken directly by Buckley himself
527000	529000	from within the comic.
529000	531000	What's amazing about it is how it manages to,
531000	533000	while claiming gamers are peaceful
533000	535000	even though they've played a lot of violent games,
535000	537000	ends with the threatening phrase,
537000	540000	which, by the way,
540000	542000	is also a line from that scene in Fight Club
542000	544000	where they threaten to cut off a guy's testicles
544000	546000	if he defies them.
548000	550000	Do not bother us.
550000	552000	Imagine writing something like that
552000	555000	and thinking, yeah,
555000	557000	that proves that gamers are peaceful
557000	560000	and intelligent and can be reasoned with.
560000	563000	It almost says something about gamers
563000	566000	when people sit down and write things like that.
566000	569000	Where's that fucking noise coming from?
569000	571000	Where's...
571000	573000	What?
587000	590000	Don't you think you might be reading a little too much into it
590000	593000	about what a bad comic that sucks might say?
593000	596000	Stick to thinking about real art.
596000	599000	Ugh, this is just like that Sonic thing, isn't it?
600000	602000	The Sonic thing?
602000	604000	You're overthinking a blue hedgehog, man.
604000	606000	Why can't you be objective?
606000	609000	Why can't you talk about the level design and mechanics instead?
609000	612000	You could be talking about how Mario 1-1
612000	614000	teaches you how to play it.
614000	616000	But it's not just a hedgehog, is it?
616000	619000	I mean, it's animals fighting a developed machine empire.
619000	622000	Like, there's very, very obvious themes going on here,
622000	625000	a discussion of ecology versus technology.
625000	627000	If you want to talk about how great nature is
627000	629000	and how bad technology is,
629000	631000	why don't you go live in the woods?
631000	633000	You wouldn't do that, though, would you?
633000	635000	You wouldn't have your precious lattes to drink
635000	638000	while you complain on your iPhone about capitalism.
638000	641000	I don't drink lattes. What the fuck are you talking about?
644000	646000	By now, you've probably noticed
646000	648000	a fairly strong contradiction in the comic.
648000	651000	Between the crass, random, non-canon of the many parts
651000	654000	intended purely for no-strings-attached comedy,
654000	656000	the serious parts where Buckley himself
656000	659000	definitely doesn't personally threaten someone,
659000	661000	and the actual serious lives of the main characters
661000	664000	who have problems that don't go away,
664000	666000	the comic keeps reverberating back and forth,
666000	668000	going to further and further extremes.
668000	671000	Sometimes you'd get a story where Lucas goes on a date
671000	673000	with a woman who turns out to be fat,
673000	675000	so he awkwardly pretends to be interested
675000	678000	for hilarious comedy,
678000	680000	and then they go back to her place,
680000	682000	and it turns out she was only pretending
682000	684000	to be fat as a test,
684000	686000	and they start a relationship that lasts
686000	688000	for five years of the comic?
688000	691000	Then you'd get a chef character saying nonsense for a joke,
691000	693000	and then something random happens,
693000	695000	or maybe you'd get the players, four characters
695000	697000	whose whole deal is they murder each other
697000	699000	in different ways over and over.
699000	701000	Then it turns out Ethan's girlfriend is pregnant.
701000	703000	Then they joke about what if the guns in the new
703000	705000	Gears of War game were guns with trains
705000	707000	instead of chainsaws?
707000	709000	You snap back and forth so quickly,
709000	711000	you get whiplash of the mind.
711000	713000	The tension between the comic's supposed reality
713000	715000	and meaningless comic fantasy world
715000	717000	eventually snapped when,
717000	719000	during a scene at Ethan's job where he's making a joke
719000	721000	about consumers being stupid
721000	723000	and not knowing as much about games as him,
723000	725000	he gets a phone call.
725000	728000	Lila, the comedy video game girlfriend character,
728000	730000	is in the hospital
730000	733000	because she's had a miscarriage.
733000	735000	This culminates in perhaps
735000	738000	the most well-known page of a comic
738000	740000	in history.
740000	754000	♪
754000	756000	When asked by a noted art scholar
756000	758000	the appropriate distance from which to stand
758000	760000	when viewing his magnum opus,
760000	762000	plainly entitled
762000	763000	Loss,
763000	765000	Tim Buckley famously responded,
765000	766000	What?
766000	768000	Fuck you!
768000	770000	and banned me from his forum.
771000	773000	The release of Loss profoundly shook
773000	775000	the edifice of its audience.
775000	777000	People were equal parts
777000	780000	shocked, horrified, surprised,
780000	782000	offended,
782000	784000	and completely mystified.
784000	787000	The semi-serious but still mostly jokey
787000	789000	plot parts of the story are utterly shattered,
789000	791000	giving way to a harsh and cold reality
791000	793000	where characters in other contexts
793000	795000	have committed or received
795000	797000	tremendous acts of violence,
797000	798000	only capable of a genuine moment
798000	800000	of horrific suffering.
800000	802000	A comic famous for using too many words
802000	804000	to say nothing at all about a video game
804000	806000	on a stationary couch
806000	808000	takes four panels and zero words
808000	810000	to show a horrifying discovery
810000	812000	and a trip through an entire hospital.
812000	813000	A gaming webcomic,
813000	815000	a comedy gaming webcomic,
815000	817000	has an arc in it about the characters
817000	819000	having to deal with the miscarriage
819000	820000	of their child!
820000	823000	This comic struck a nerve on the Internet.
823000	825000	Over nine years later,
825000	827000	people are still making fun of it.
827000	829000	This comic has been parodied
829000	830000	and referenced in memes
830000	832000	an uncountable amount of times.
832000	834000	Entire webpages have been dedicated
834000	835000	to tracking them all
835000	837000	and failed to contain them.
837000	839000	In the next two comics,
839000	841000	the characters struggle to even react
841000	842000	to what has happened.
842000	844000	It's breaking my heart
844000	846000	to watch her hurt like this.
846000	848000	The next comic is a joke about how there aren't
848000	850000	enough dragons in Dungeons & Dragons anymore.
850000	852000	The next comic is a single panel
852000	854000	of the four players about to murder each other.
854000	856000	For the next little while,
856000	858000	the comic switched between dumb video game jokes
858000	860000	and Buckley trying desperately
860000	862000	to restore the comfortable,
862000	864000	consequence-free tone he had developed
864000	866000	over the five years of the comic.
866000	868000	It takes at least eight pages
868000	870000	before Ethan can go back
870000	872000	to making goggles out of pineapples.
872000	874000	By late November,
874000	876000	the characters have fully patched up their problems
876000	877000	and they get married,
877000	879000	and we get tearful speeches
879000	881000	about how important these characters are to each other.
881000	885000	Life dropped an epic husband,
885000	888000	the rarest of its loot table,
888000	890000	and I was lucky enough
890000	892000	to win the need roll.
892000	894000	["Cheering"]
894000	895000	Then, for about four years,
895000	897000	the comic was basically stand-alone silly jokes
897000	899000	interspersed with bits where there were
899000	901000	mini-comics set in a universe like Star Wars
901000	902000	for some reason.
902000	904000	One could say that,
904000	905000	with the advent of Loss,
905000	907000	a lesson had been learned.
907000	909000	Don't put one of the most
909000	911000	emotionally traumatizing events
911000	913000	a human can experience
913000	915000	in your...
915000	917000	comedy gaming webcomic!
917000	919000	Then, in September 2012,
919000	921000	Ethan tried to build a time machine
921000	923000	and a future version of Ethan comes through it
923000	925000	and kidnaps him into the future.
925000	927000	The next two months of comics were an extended storyline
927000	929000	in which it turns out that Ethan's actions
929000	931000	destroy most of humanity
931000	933000	as the robot he builds eventually goes insane
933000	935000	and murders everyone he loves
935000	936000	and takes over the world,
936000	937000	but in the process,
937000	939000	the time machine is damaged
939000	941000	and threatens to destroy all of time,
941000	943000	so Ethan has to sacrifice himself
943000	945000	to turn the machine off,
945000	947000	killing him and saving the future
947000	949000	as his inner monologue makes a tearful goodbye
949000	951000	to a character no one really cares about
951000	953000	because she's basically just written to be
953000	955000	a love interest for the author stand-in.
955000	957000	Ethan, our main character, dies.
957000	960000	He dies in the most convoluted fashion possible
960000	962000	and no one ever learns what happened.
963000	965000	Now that's how you end a...
966000	967000	gaming webcomic.
967000	968000	Except it didn't end.
968000	970000	It's still been going for five more years,
970000	972000	but with just the self-contained sketches
972000	974000	and the characters from the old version
974000	975000	in a rebooted form,
975000	977000	the comic somehow continues to limp on.
977000	980000	It literally killed its main character
980000	983000	and then it just sort of started again.
983000	985000	So that...
985000	987000	THAT was CAD.
987000	989000	CAD was mean-spirited,
989000	991000	hateful, and angry.
991000	993000	CAD was, uh, uh,
993000	995000	judgmental, tone-deaf,
995000	998000	self-righteous screed of a webcomic.
998000	999000	And...
1000000	1001000	Wait.
1003000	1004000	I'm warning you.
1004000	1006000	Don't do this, man.
1006000	1007000	Don't go there.
1007000	1009000	Sorry, are you talking to someone?
1009000	1010000	Is there someone here?
1010000	1011000	Doesn't CAD...
1011000	1014000	say something about gamer culture?
1018000	1019000	Stop!
1019000	1020000	No! No!
1020000	1021000	What have you done?!
1021000	1022000	What have you done?!
1030000	1031000	What's happening?
1051000	1052000	Why?
1052000	1053000	It's caused this crisis.
1053000	1054000	It's caused this virus.
1054000	1056000	These games aren't fitting for one of us.
1056000	1057000	They are responsible.
1057000	1058000	We are responsible.
1058000	1060000	We haven't done hyving these people,
1060000	1061000	They know bemoaning them.
1061000	1063000	Don't fuck with us.
1063000	1064000	What...?
1064000	1066000	Hi, I'm Heritan Splimbi,
1066000	1067000	and welcome to...
1067000	1069000	What the fuck is happening?!
1069000	1070000	What just happened here?
1071000	1073000	Tommy Wiseau's infamous film,
1073000	1074000	The Room,
1074000	1076000	asks some really interesting questions
1076000	1077000	about how we look at art.
1077000	1079000	No, seriously, come on!
1079000	1080000	Stay with me here!
1080000	1082000	In terms of pure filmmaking skill,
1082000	1083000	of course, it's awful.
1083000	1084000	The script is a nightmare.
1084000	1085000	It's poorly edited,
1085000	1087000	with random shots of San Francisco
1087000	1089000	just kind of slammed in there.
1089000	1091000	It has such below-average shot composition
1091000	1092000	and mise-en-scene
1092000	1093000	that I actually feel bad
1093000	1095000	for even saying those words,
1095000	1097000	and the ADR is terrible, too.
1097000	1100000	Yeah, can I have a dozen red roses, please?
1100000	1102000	Oh, hi, Johnny. I didn't know it was you.
1102000	1103000	Here you go.
1103000	1105000	That's me.
1105000	1106000	How much is it?
1106000	1107000	It'll be $18.
1107000	1108000	Here you go. Keep the change.
1108000	1109000	Hi, doggie.
1109000	1110000	You're my favorite customer.
1110000	1111000	Thanks a lot. Bye.
1111000	1113000	It has a reputation
1113000	1114000	for being a hilariously bad film
1114000	1116000	everyone can laugh at for being bad.
1116000	1118000	He's a bad movie!
1118000	1120000	Made even more interesting
1120000	1123000	by the incredibly weird performance of Wiseau.
1123000	1125000	I've fed up with this world!
1125000	1128000	But I think, under the proper lens,
1128000	1131000	the film has a little more to say to its audience
1131000	1133000	than, look at me, I'm so bad.
1133000	1135000	Tommy Wiseau didn't write a film
1135000	1136000	about a perfect guy
1136000	1138000	who gets cheated on by his girlfriend
1138000	1140000	and basically has his life ruined for no reason,
1140000	1142000	and he didn't choose to play that perfect guy
1142000	1144000	for no reason either.
1144000	1146000	And here, taking a particular critical look,
1146000	1148000	I think a valuable message
1148000	1150000	can be learned from the film.
1150000	1151000	The film has often been criticized
1151000	1153000	in terms of its base components
1153000	1155000	like writing or acting.
1155000	1156000	Lisa, for example,
1156000	1157000	behaves completely irrationally
1157000	1160000	or perhaps with deliberate malice towards Johnny.
1160000	1162000	I have him wrapped around my little finger.
1162000	1164000	Oh, you should be happy then.
1164000	1166000	But I don't love him.
1166000	1168000	Suddenly falling out of love with him
1168000	1170000	and cheating on him and then spreading lies about him
1170000	1172000	for seemingly no reason.
1172000	1174000	You are lying. I never hit you.
1174000	1177000	You are tearing me apart, Lisa!
1177000	1179000	Why are you so hysterical?
1179000	1180000	I contend here
1180000	1182000	that Wiseau based the play script
1182000	1184000	that would later become the film
1184000	1186000	on an actual life experience,
1186000	1188000	an actual breakup that really happened
1188000	1190000	at some point in his life.
1190000	1192000	I treat you like a princess,
1192000	1194000	and you stab me in the back.
1194000	1196000	I loved you, and I did anything for you
1196000	1197000	to just please you,
1197000	1199000	and now you betray me.
1199000	1201000	How could you love him?
1201000	1203000	Aah!
1203000	1205000	I'm not saying the events happened
1205000	1206000	exactly as Tommy writes them.
1206000	1208000	In fact, they definitely didn't.
1208000	1210000	Obviously, Tommy didn't kill himself,
1210000	1211000	and obviously, women don't grow distant
1211000	1213000	from the people they're in a relationship with
1213000	1214000	for no reason.
1214000	1216000	Women change their minds all the time.
1216000	1218000	The Room is a fictionalized,
1218000	1219000	exaggerated representation
1219000	1221000	of what Tommy thinks happened
1221000	1223000	in this real relationship,
1223000	1226000	being completely, perhaps even incoherently honest
1226000	1228000	about why he thinks it fell apart,
1228000	1230000	and it's clear that he thinks it fell apart
1230000	1232000	because his girlfriend started acting weird
1232000	1234000	and crazy and trying to hurt him.
1234000	1236000	What's important here is to understand
1236000	1237000	that to Tommy,
1237000	1239000	this is genuinely how he views this woman.
1239000	1241000	This character is to him
1241000	1243000	an honest expression of that person,
1243000	1246000	but there has to have been a real Lisa once,
1246000	1247000	and her perspective,
1247000	1249000	her side of the story, isn't told.
1249000	1251000	We don't get to see the things Tommy did
1251000	1253000	that led her to move on from him or cheat on him,
1253000	1255000	and we only have Tommy's word
1255000	1257000	that he wasn't abusive and was a really good guy,
1257000	1259000	and maybe the fact he genuinely thought
1259000	1261000	to depict this woman as a monster
1261000	1263000	trying to ruin his life
1263000	1265000	says something about how he understands
1265000	1267000	other people and their feelings.
1267000	1270000	The Room, precisely with its unrealistic,
1270000	1272000	biased inaccuracy,
1272000	1276000	accurately depicts why breakups actually happen.
1276000	1277000	People don't fully understand
1277000	1279000	how the other person feels
1279000	1281000	and begin to think of them as malicious figures
1281000	1284000	because that's the only way we can make sense of people
1284000	1286000	when we don't fully understand them.
1286000	1288000	I've talked to plenty of guys about breakups,
1288000	1290000	and very often you get the same old story
1290000	1292000	just like this one where their partner
1292000	1294000	turned out to be a crazy bitch
1294000	1296000	who just wanted to hurt them,
1296000	1297000	but if you're ever lucky enough
1297000	1299000	to hear the other side of a story like that,
1299000	1301000	they're often just frustrated with people
1301000	1303000	who can so easily view them like that
1303000	1305000	if they have a few arguments.
1305000	1308000	Wiseau tried to make a film about his breakup,
1308000	1310000	but it turned out to be a film about his inability
1310000	1312000	to understand why it happened.
1313000	1315000	No. No.
1316000	1317000	No more.
1317000	1318000	The Room is a filmed version
1318000	1320000	of the real, heavily distorted perspective
1320000	1324000	on breakups that many heterosexual men often have,
1324000	1326000	and in many ways, when you look at the film this way,
1326000	1328000	it serves as a call to action
1328000	1331000	to learn to see past the leases we think we see
1331000	1333000	and understand that relationships
1333000	1335000	tend to fall apart for a reason,
1335000	1336000	and we can learn to do better
1336000	1338000	by seeing people for who they are.
1338000	1339000	For all its actual flaws,
1339000	1341000	and even because of some of its clearly
1341000	1344000	deeply flawed misogynistic writing,
1344000	1345000	The Room ends up being
1345000	1347000	an actually valuable demonstration
1347000	1350000	of the distorted ways people perceive relationships
1350000	1352000	and how this eventually destroys them
1352000	1355000	better than any film made by, say,
1355000	1357000	I don't know, any man actually working
1357000	1358000	in Hollywood right now,
1358000	1360000	especially the ones currently cashing in
1360000	1362000	on the popularity of The Room.
1362000	1364000	Hi! I'm he...
1364000	1365000	AH!
1366000	1367000	Gah!
1369000	1370000	Ah!
1382000	1383000	As you might be aware,
1383000	1385000	EA recently closed Visceral Games,
1385000	1387000	the studio working on a Star Wars game
1387000	1389000	that had been in the works for a long time,
1389000	1391000	being worked on by M. Night Shyamalan
1391000	1393000	being worked on by, among many others,
1393000	1395000	the director and writer of most of the Uncharted games,
1395000	1398000	but also one of the best-written game series ever,
1398000	1399000	Legacy of Kain,
1399000	1402000	and pivoting the entire game away from what was being made.
1402000	1405000	This update, posted on EA's website by Patrick Suderland,
1405000	1407000	vice president of EA,
1407000	1408000	cites
1408000	1410000	fundamental shifts in the marketplace.
1410000	1412000	Single-player linear experiences
1412000	1414000	simply aren't profitable enough,
1414000	1417000	at least compared to certain other recent kinds of experience
1417000	1419000	that emphasize time investment
1419000	1421000	and incentivize further transactions
1421000	1423000	made over the course of a single product
1423000	1425000	rather than a simple one-off purchase.
1425000	1427000	This is one of many management decisions
1427000	1429000	that exists in a marketplace
1429000	1432000	driven by the forces inherent to a capitalist society.
1432000	1433000	The decision is, sadly,
1433000	1435000	the result of the overall company goal
1435000	1438000	to continue to grow and satisfy investors,
1438000	1440000	and this practice trumps creative freedom
1440000	1443000	or what games players might actually want to see.
1443000	1445000	Penny Arcade covered this story
1445000	1447000	by featuring one of the two main characters,
1447000	1448000	a stand-in for the author,
1448000	1451000	directly, personally calling Patrick Suderland
1451000	1454000	an incoherent, art-destroying monster.
1454000	1456000	Literally, the only thing I know about you
1456000	1458000	is that you destroy things.
1458000	1460000	Jobs, art.
1460000	1462000	I mean, where should I even start?
1462000	1465000	What you did is bad for games,
1465000	1466000	bad for gamers,
1466000	1469000	and trying to frame it as anything but cowardice
1469000	1471000	is offensive.
1471000	1474000	Penny Arcade is consistently cited as far better than CAD
1474000	1477000	because CAD's just a bunch of nonsensical rants,
1477000	1479000	and it keeps just using violence as a punch.
1479000	1480000	No, wait.
1480000	1481000	This is Penny Arcade's violence.
1481000	1482000	How did this get in here?
1482000	1483000	This is obviously hilarious.
1483000	1485000	Oh, my God, he was killed by a gun.
1485000	1486000	Ha ha ha.
1486000	1490000	Here's to another two decades of comedy gold
1490000	1492000	and insightful commentary
1492000	1495000	on the future of gaming.
1495000	1497000	Penny Arcade got so popular and influential
1497000	1499000	on the back of this stuff
1499000	1500000	that its convention, PAX,
1500000	1503000	is one of the biggest industry events of the year
1503000	1506000	with even major companies showing off games there.
1506000	1508000	CAD also had a convention of its own
1508000	1511000	for a couple of years labeled Digital Overload,
1511000	1513000	and I hesitate to admit,
1513000	1515000	things don't get popular enough
1515000	1517000	to have an entire convention
1517000	1520000	without being at least partially accurate reflections
1520000	1521000	of their audience.
1531000	1533000	I hope the problem here is clear.
1533000	1535000	Even the most intelligent,
1535000	1537000	well-paid, popular,
1537000	1539000	and, uh, verbose writers
1539000	1541000	gaming culture has to offer
1541000	1543000	seem unaware that these decisions
1543000	1544000	are not made in a vacuum,
1544000	1546000	that games are threatened not
1546000	1548000	by a secretive anti-art coward
1548000	1551000	but by an environment that systematically crushes
1551000	1553000	most of the people who work on them
1553000	1555000	in order to make its owners and shareholders
1555000	1558000	vastly rich and which has no interest
1558000	1560000	in anything's intrinsic value.
1560000	1562000	Gaming culture is largely unable
1562000	1565000	to conceive of this level of socioeconomic criticism,
1565000	1567000	of analysis of systemic problems
1567000	1569000	and wider issues with society
1569000	1571000	beyond one person's individual failings
1571000	1573000	and therefore cannot accurately fathom
1573000	1576000	exactly what is damaging the things they love.
1576000	1578000	Instead, they have to fantasize
1578000	1581000	about their very own Lisa hiding somewhere in EA
1581000	1583000	trying to kill art
1583000	1585000	like some kind of fucking Disney villain.
1585000	1589000	This is why people hate CAD so much.
1589000	1590000	Not because it's bad.
1590000	1592000	No, bad things come and go all day.
1592000	1593000	Every day.
1593000	1596000	CAD is such a source of focus and aggression
1596000	1598000	with millions and millions of words
1598000	1600000	written about how awful it and its creator is
1600000	1602000	because it's an embarrassment.
1602000	1605000	It makes everyone else near it look bad
1605000	1607000	because as bad as it is,
1607000	1609000	it managed to be honest.
1609000	1611000	So people have to try as hard as they can
1611000	1613000	to project these things away from them,
1613000	1616000	try to shift the blame onto Buckley himself
1616000	1618000	and away from the fact they share
1618000	1620000	a lot of the same perspectives.
1620000	1623000	Think again about that Jack Thompson comic.
1623000	1625000	No one just ends up in a position
1625000	1627000	where they'll write something like this all on their own.
1627000	1630000	Jack Thompson, wrong and dishonest as he was,
1630000	1632000	received thousands of death threats
1632000	1635000	and messages full of harassment for years
1635000	1637000	from people just like Tim
1637000	1639000	or people who had been influenced by this comic.
1639000	1642000	No, CAD is merely a particularly silly
1642000	1645000	and vulgar expression of a broader set of bad ideas
1645000	1648000	that continue to go largely unexamined
1648000	1650000	by the people who hold them.
1650000	1652000	Tim Buckley's disjointed personal philosophy
1652000	1655000	and lack of skill didn't come from nowhere.
1655000	1658000	We don't get to pretend he's just some random guy.
1658000	1662000	Blaming one man for the flaws of a broken economic system
1662000	1665000	is making the same mistake as blaming Tim Buckley
1665000	1668000	for accurately presenting the culture in which he exists.
1668000	1670000	We just have to learn to accept
1670000	1673000	that there might be a lesson in things we hate about us,
1673000	1675000	that even if it's bad and we don't like it,
1675000	1678000	we have more in common with it than we want to admit
1678000	1680000	and can even learn something from it.
1680000	1682000	CAD turned out to be reflective
1682000	1684000	of the cultural reality that produced it,
1684000	1686000	and people are only angry at it this much
1686000	1689000	because they don't like what they saw in the mirror.
1689000	1691000	You all right?
1719000	1722000	Oh, my God.
1749000	1752000	Oh, my God.
1779000	1794000	When we look at ridiculous behaviour within our sphere,
1794000	1797000	instead of trying to project it out of ourselves,
1797000	1800000	say it's just some random idiot somewhere
1800000	1803000	doing something dumb,
1803000	1807000	maybe we should accept that CAD, Penny Arcade, Visceral Games,
1807000	1809000	and even EA's business decisions
1809000	1811000	are aspects of a wider culture
1811000	1814000	that can be reflective of our own feelings
1814000	1816000	and beliefs and values,
1816000	1819000	even if we don't like what comes out of them.
1819000	1823000	And maybe if we learn to criticise ourselves
1823000	1825000	and change our own behaviour,
1825000	1832000	we can start to change the wider culture.
1832000	1834000	Thank you for your time.
1837000	1844000	I must set aright that which has been made wrong.
