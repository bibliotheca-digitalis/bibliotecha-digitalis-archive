00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hi, I'm Harriton Splimby, and welcome to Serious Law Analysis.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Oh, fucking...

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Just... fucking...

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You will pay for what you have done.

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
...

6
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
...

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
...

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
...

9
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
...

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Today on Serious Law Analysis,

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
we're covering a creative work that I heavily implied

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
might have been coming next in the last few videos.

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And that's right, today we're covering

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
the Control-Alt-Delete Webcomic and Animated series.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
In retrospect, I think I might have made it too obvious.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
For those of you too young to remember the early days of the world,

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
before we had the Internet and hadn't yet achieved the dream

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
of having to argue with Holocaust deniers all day,

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
humans would amuse themselves by painting stuff on the walls of their caves

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
or later drawing it onto paper or canvas.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
These scribbles became known as...

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
...

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Eventually, however, humans evolved past this bullshit

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and realized you could divide up your space into smaller subspaces

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
called Parnells and then use that to create several sequential images,

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
which when read in order could tell a story.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This sequence art later became known as comics

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
for reasons we forgot because it doesn't matter.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Fast forward to the late 90s and early 2000s

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
where we played video games and things were finally good.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Then people who enjoyed video games gained access to the Internet.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But because they didn't yet have the bandwidth

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
to play most games online or watch puppy compilations all day

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and argue in the comments about 9-11,

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
people instead would amuse themselves online by using webcomics,

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
also known as digital versions of comics that you find on the web.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And since the bar for publishing onto the Internet

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
was as low as being able to afford server hosting

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
or even lower if you used a free website,

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
people were finally free to create comics

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
for a small or niche in audiences they liked

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
without any need for mass market appeal

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
or the production costs of ink and paper and printing

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
or, um, quality.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Enter the gaming webcomic,

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
a form of webcomic centering around jokes about games and gaming culture,

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
the most popular of these was Penny Arcade,

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
a comic still going to this day,

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
rife with hilarious and well-thought-out humor.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Don't state me, bro! Ha ha ha!

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Hilarious! It's just like the thing!

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
With the guy!

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The bedrock of this type of comic tends to feature several characters,

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
often representative of the authors,

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
sitting on a couch making hilarious jokes

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
about video games that are out right now

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
or inside the fiction of a video game

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
interacting with it to hilarious consequences.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
These two forms were the bedrock

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
of many early gaming webcomics

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
from the late 90s to the early 2000s,

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and there were many successful comics using this format

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
like Penny Arcade, PvP, Little Gamers,

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Bob & George, 8-Bit Theater, and others.

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
All tremendous pieces of art

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
with a lot to say about games

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and how bad it is that our games are being usurped by money men

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and how funny it would be if you died

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
in a way a lot bigger like it's just like in the game.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But for every one of these comics,

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
there were dozens of poor imitators

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
out to replicate their popularity and profit

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
by reusing the same tropes.

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
An explosion in the gaming webcomic had begun,

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and it would continue for over a decade.

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Enter Tim Buckley with his own webcomic,

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Control-Alt-Delete, often referred to as CAD.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
CAD isn't like the other webcomics.

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's not art. It doesn't have value or meaning.

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's trash, and it doesn't say anything at all.

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's full of worthless jokes where the punchline is violence.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's not like Penny Arcade. CAD is the story of Ethan,

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
a character who looks suspiciously like

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
how Buckley draws himself.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Ethan and his roommate Lucas talk about video games

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and occasionally are inside the games

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
where something bad happens to them or people they don't like.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Wow, that's original.

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Let's compare and contrast this with a good comic, shall we?

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
In this 2002 page from Penny Arcade,

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
the author insert characters burn a voodoo doll

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
hurting George Romero.

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh, my God, look how much better these guys are.

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This is great. Meanwhile, look over here

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
at CAD in the slow lane for Idiots

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
using violence as a punchline.

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What a stupid thing to put in a comic.

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Over time, CAD stopped even trying to tell jokes,

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and it started spending more and more time exploring

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
the personal lives and development of its characters.

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The main characters, Ethan and Lucas, went on dates,

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
moved apartments, made and lost friends,

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and started long-term relationships.

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Ethan quickly meets and begins dating Lila,

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
a girl who plays video games, which, as we all know,

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
is like finding a unicorn,

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and like all girls who do play games,

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
it's her only character trait.

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The two inexplicably fall in love

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
even though Ethan has nothing to offer anyone

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and is basically unlikable.

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's pretty clear from reading this

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
that Buckley doesn't know how human relationships work.

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You could almost point out this...

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
almost says something

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
about how people who play video games a lot

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
view human relationships, but...

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No, no, no, no, no.

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
No, it's bad, and it doesn't mean anything.

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Tim Buckley's just really bad at making comics.

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Oh, also, despite being basically unable

122
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
to do anything but play video games,

123
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Ethan eventually builds a sentient AI robot

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
who becomes the fourth main character.

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Zeke exists to occasionally joke

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
about how humans are made of meat and bad

127
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and he's better than them.

128
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's clearly inspired by characters

129
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
like HK-47 from KOTOR or Bender from Futurama,

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
but there's no actual jokes here.

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's what I like to call a joke by association.

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's not really a joke.

133
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's just a vague gesture

134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
in the direction of a joke

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
that you might remember from somewhere else.

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Somewhere else.

137
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm somewhere else.

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Why are you doing this?

139
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't do this to yourself.

140
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Don't become one of them.

141
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
One of what?

142
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The worst thing about this comic

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
is that it doesn't know what it wants to be.

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
No, wait.

145
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Actually, the worst thing is CAD Premium.

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
For a few years, you could pay a monthly fee

147
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
to get access to episodes of the CAD animated series,

148
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
which the comic inexplicably had.

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It ran for two seasons,

150
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and some episodes ran up to six minutes.

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If you thought a story featuring cartoon violence,

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
a futuristic killer robot,

153
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
video game opinions on a couch,

154
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
and awkward, boring, serious relationship drama

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
had trouble finding its identity in comic form,

156
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
just wait until it comes in a box set

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
containing barely two hours of animation

158
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
made in about a week that you paid

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
35 entire dollars of your actual human money for.

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Three episodes of the 12-episode first season

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
are dedicated entirely to an extended Star Wars reference.

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
They reenact an entire Star Wars film

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
in each five-minute episode,

164
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
compressing it down so much you'd barely even realize

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
that's what they're doing unless you listen

166
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
to the director's commentary track,

167
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
which this show has for some reason.

168
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The villain, instead of Darth Vader,

169
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
is Jack Thompson, a lawyer who tried to sue game developers

170
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
for making their players violent.

171
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The Death Star is a sign that makes people

172
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
stop playing video games?

173
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's time to test the power

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
of this fully operational anti-gamer billboard.

175
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Speaking of Jack Thompson,

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Thompson appeared to have struck a nerve with Buckley.

177
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
One page of the comic is straight-up

178
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
an open letter to Jack,

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
a four-panel, long mini-novel

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
spoken directly by Buckley himself

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
from within the comic.

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What's amazing about it is how it manages to,

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
while claiming gamers are peaceful

184
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
even though they've played a lot of violent games,

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
ends with the threatening phrase,

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
which, by the way,

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
is also a line from that scene in Fight Club

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
where they threaten to cut off a guy's testicles

189
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
if he defies them.

190
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Do not bother us.

191
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Imagine writing something like that

192
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
and thinking, yeah,

193
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
that proves that gamers are peaceful

194
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and intelligent and can be reasoned with.

195
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It almost says something about gamers

196
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
when people sit down and write things like that.

197
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Where's that fucking noise coming from?

198
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Where's...

199
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What?

200
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Don't you think you might be reading a little too much into it

201
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
about what a bad comic that sucks might say?

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Stick to thinking about real art.

203
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Ugh, this is just like that Sonic thing, isn't it?

204
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The Sonic thing?

205
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You're overthinking a blue hedgehog, man.

206
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Why can't you be objective?

207
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Why can't you talk about the level design and mechanics instead?

208
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You could be talking about how Mario 1-1

209
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
teaches you how to play it.

210
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But it's not just a hedgehog, is it?

211
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I mean, it's animals fighting a developed machine empire.

212
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Like, there's very, very obvious themes going on here,

213
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
a discussion of ecology versus technology.

214
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
If you want to talk about how great nature is

215
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
and how bad technology is,

216
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
why don't you go live in the woods?

217
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You wouldn't do that, though, would you?

218
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You wouldn't have your precious lattes to drink

219
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
while you complain on your iPhone about capitalism.

220
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't drink lattes. What the fuck are you talking about?

221
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
By now, you've probably noticed

222
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
a fairly strong contradiction in the comic.

223
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Between the crass, random, non-canon of the many parts

224
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
intended purely for no-strings-attached comedy,

225
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
the serious parts where Buckley himself

226
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
definitely doesn't personally threaten someone,

227
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
and the actual serious lives of the main characters

228
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
who have problems that don't go away,

229
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
the comic keeps reverberating back and forth,

230
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
going to further and further extremes.

231
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Sometimes you'd get a story where Lucas goes on a date

232
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
with a woman who turns out to be fat,

233
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
so he awkwardly pretends to be interested

234
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
for hilarious comedy,

235
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and then they go back to her place,

236
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
and it turns out she was only pretending

237
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
to be fat as a test,

238
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
and they start a relationship that lasts

239
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
for five years of the comic?

240
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Then you'd get a chef character saying nonsense for a joke,

241
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
and then something random happens,

242
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
or maybe you'd get the players, four characters

243
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
whose whole deal is they murder each other

244
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
in different ways over and over.

245
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Then it turns out Ethan's girlfriend is pregnant.

246
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Then they joke about what if the guns in the new

247
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Gears of War game were guns with trains

248
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
instead of chainsaws?

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You snap back and forth so quickly,

250
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
you get whiplash of the mind.

251
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The tension between the comic's supposed reality

252
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
and meaningless comic fantasy world

253
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
eventually snapped when,

254
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
during a scene at Ethan's job where he's making a joke

255
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
about consumers being stupid

256
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
and not knowing as much about games as him,

257
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
he gets a phone call.

258
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Lila, the comedy video game girlfriend character,

259
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
is in the hospital

260
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
because she's had a miscarriage.

261
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
This culminates in perhaps

262
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
the most well-known page of a comic

263
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
in history.

264
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:34,000
♪

265
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
When asked by a noted art scholar

266
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
the appropriate distance from which to stand

267
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
when viewing his magnum opus,

268
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
plainly entitled

269
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Loss,

270
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Tim Buckley famously responded,

271
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What?

272
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Fuck you!

273
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and banned me from his forum.

274
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The release of Loss profoundly shook

275
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
the edifice of its audience.

276
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
People were equal parts

277
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
shocked, horrified, surprised,

278
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
offended,

279
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
and completely mystified.

280
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The semi-serious but still mostly jokey

281
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
plot parts of the story are utterly shattered,

282
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
giving way to a harsh and cold reality

283
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
where characters in other contexts

284
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
have committed or received

285
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
tremendous acts of violence,

286
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
only capable of a genuine moment

287
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
of horrific suffering.

288
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
A comic famous for using too many words

289
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
to say nothing at all about a video game

290
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
on a stationary couch

291
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
takes four panels and zero words

292
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
to show a horrifying discovery

293
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and a trip through an entire hospital.

294
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
A gaming webcomic,

295
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
a comedy gaming webcomic,

296
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
has an arc in it about the characters

297
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
having to deal with the miscarriage

298
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
of their child!

299
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
This comic struck a nerve on the Internet.

300
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Over nine years later,

301
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
people are still making fun of it.

302
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
This comic has been parodied

303
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
and referenced in memes

304
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
an uncountable amount of times.

305
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Entire webpages have been dedicated

306
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
to tracking them all

307
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
and failed to contain them.

308
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
In the next two comics,

309
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
the characters struggle to even react

310
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
to what has happened.

311
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's breaking my heart

312
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
to watch her hurt like this.

313
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The next comic is a joke about how there aren't

314
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
enough dragons in Dungeons & Dragons anymore.

315
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
The next comic is a single panel

316
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
of the four players about to murder each other.

317
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
For the next little while,

318
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
the comic switched between dumb video game jokes

319
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
and Buckley trying desperately

320
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
to restore the comfortable,

321
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
consequence-free tone he had developed

322
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
over the five years of the comic.

323
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It takes at least eight pages

324
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
before Ethan can go back

325
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
to making goggles out of pineapples.

326
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
By late November,

327
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
the characters have fully patched up their problems

328
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
and they get married,

329
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
and we get tearful speeches

330
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
about how important these characters are to each other.

331
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Life dropped an epic husband,

332
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
the rarest of its loot table,

333
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
and I was lucky enough

334
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
to win the need roll.

335
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
["Cheering"]

336
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Then, for about four years,

337
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
the comic was basically stand-alone silly jokes

338
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
interspersed with bits where there were

339
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
mini-comics set in a universe like Star Wars

340
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
for some reason.

341
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
One could say that,

342
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
with the advent of Loss,

343
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
a lesson had been learned.

344
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Don't put one of the most

345
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
emotionally traumatizing events

346
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
a human can experience

347
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
in your...

348
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
comedy gaming webcomic!

349
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Then, in September 2012,

350
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Ethan tried to build a time machine

351
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
and a future version of Ethan comes through it

352
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
and kidnaps him into the future.

353
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The next two months of comics were an extended storyline

354
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
in which it turns out that Ethan's actions

355
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
destroy most of humanity

356
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
as the robot he builds eventually goes insane

357
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and murders everyone he loves

358
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and takes over the world,

359
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
but in the process,

360
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
the time machine is damaged

361
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
and threatens to destroy all of time,

362
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
so Ethan has to sacrifice himself

363
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
to turn the machine off,

364
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
killing him and saving the future

365
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
as his inner monologue makes a tearful goodbye

366
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
to a character no one really cares about

367
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
because she's basically just written to be

368
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
a love interest for the author stand-in.

369
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Ethan, our main character, dies.

370
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
He dies in the most convoluted fashion possible

371
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
and no one ever learns what happened.

372
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Now that's how you end a...

373
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
gaming webcomic.

374
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Except it didn't end.

375
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's still been going for five more years,

376
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
but with just the self-contained sketches

377
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and the characters from the old version

378
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
in a rebooted form,

379
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
the comic somehow continues to limp on.

380
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It literally killed its main character

381
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
and then it just sort of started again.

382
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So that...

383
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
THAT was CAD.

384
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
CAD was mean-spirited,

385
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
hateful, and angry.

386
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
CAD was, uh, uh,

387
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
judgmental, tone-deaf,

388
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
self-righteous screed of a webcomic.

389
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And...

390
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Wait.

391
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm warning you.

392
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Don't do this, man.

393
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Don't go there.

394
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Sorry, are you talking to someone?

395
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Is there someone here?

396
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Doesn't CAD...

397
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
say something about gamer culture?

398
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Stop!

399
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
No! No!

400
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What have you done?!

401
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
What have you done?!

402
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What's happening?

403
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Why?

404
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's caused this crisis.

405
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's caused this virus.

406
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
These games aren't fitting for one of us.

407
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
They are responsible.

408
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
We are responsible.

409
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
We haven't done hyving these people,

410
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
They know bemoaning them.

411
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Don't fuck with us.

412
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What...?

413
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Hi, I'm Heritan Splimbi,

414
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
and welcome to...

415
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What the fuck is happening?!

416
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What just happened here?

417
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Tommy Wiseau's infamous film,

418
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The Room,

419
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
asks some really interesting questions

420
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
about how we look at art.

421
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
No, seriously, come on!

422
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Stay with me here!

423
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
In terms of pure filmmaking skill,

424
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
of course, it's awful.

425
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The script is a nightmare.

426
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's poorly edited,

427
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
with random shots of San Francisco

428
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
just kind of slammed in there.

429
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It has such below-average shot composition

430
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
and mise-en-scene

431
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
that I actually feel bad

432
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
for even saying those words,

433
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
and the ADR is terrible, too.

434
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yeah, can I have a dozen red roses, please?

435
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh, hi, Johnny. I didn't know it was you.

436
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Here you go.

437
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
That's me.

438
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
How much is it?

439
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It'll be $18.

440
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Here you go. Keep the change.

441
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Hi, doggie.

442
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You're my favorite customer.

443
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Thanks a lot. Bye.

444
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It has a reputation

445
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
for being a hilariously bad film

446
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
everyone can laugh at for being bad.

447
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
He's a bad movie!

448
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Made even more interesting

449
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
by the incredibly weird performance of Wiseau.

450
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I've fed up with this world!

451
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But I think, under the proper lens,

452
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
the film has a little more to say to its audience

453
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
than, look at me, I'm so bad.

454
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Tommy Wiseau didn't write a film

455
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
about a perfect guy

456
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
who gets cheated on by his girlfriend

457
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
and basically has his life ruined for no reason,

458
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
and he didn't choose to play that perfect guy

459
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
for no reason either.

460
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And here, taking a particular critical look,

461
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I think a valuable message

462
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
can be learned from the film.

463
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The film has often been criticized

464
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
in terms of its base components

465
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
like writing or acting.

466
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Lisa, for example,

467
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
behaves completely irrationally

468
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
or perhaps with deliberate malice towards Johnny.

469
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I have him wrapped around my little finger.

470
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Oh, you should be happy then.

471
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But I don't love him.

472
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Suddenly falling out of love with him

473
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and cheating on him and then spreading lies about him

474
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
for seemingly no reason.

475
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You are lying. I never hit you.

476
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You are tearing me apart, Lisa!

477
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Why are you so hysterical?

478
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I contend here

479
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
that Wiseau based the play script

480
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
that would later become the film

481
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
on an actual life experience,

482
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
an actual breakup that really happened

483
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
at some point in his life.

484
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I treat you like a princess,

485
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
and you stab me in the back.

486
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I loved you, and I did anything for you

487
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
to just please you,

488
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
and now you betray me.

489
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
How could you love him?

490
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Aah!

491
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm not saying the events happened

492
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
exactly as Tommy writes them.

493
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
In fact, they definitely didn't.

494
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Obviously, Tommy didn't kill himself,

495
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
and obviously, women don't grow distant

496
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
from the people they're in a relationship with

497
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
for no reason.

498
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Women change their minds all the time.

499
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
The Room is a fictionalized,

500
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
exaggerated representation

501
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
of what Tommy thinks happened

502
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
in this real relationship,

503
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
being completely, perhaps even incoherently honest

504
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
about why he thinks it fell apart,

505
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
and it's clear that he thinks it fell apart

506
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
because his girlfriend started acting weird

507
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and crazy and trying to hurt him.

508
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What's important here is to understand

509
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
that to Tommy,

510
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
this is genuinely how he views this woman.

511
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
This character is to him

512
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
an honest expression of that person,

513
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
but there has to have been a real Lisa once,

514
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
and her perspective,

515
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
her side of the story, isn't told.

516
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
We don't get to see the things Tommy did

517
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
that led her to move on from him or cheat on him,

518
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
and we only have Tommy's word

519
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
that he wasn't abusive and was a really good guy,

520
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
and maybe the fact he genuinely thought

521
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
to depict this woman as a monster

522
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
trying to ruin his life

523
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
says something about how he understands

524
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
other people and their feelings.

525
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The Room, precisely with its unrealistic,

526
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
biased inaccuracy,

527
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
accurately depicts why breakups actually happen.

528
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
People don't fully understand

529
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
how the other person feels

530
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
and begin to think of them as malicious figures

531
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
because that's the only way we can make sense of people

532
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
when we don't fully understand them.

533
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I've talked to plenty of guys about breakups,

534
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and very often you get the same old story

535
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
just like this one where their partner

536
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
turned out to be a crazy bitch

537
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
who just wanted to hurt them,

538
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
but if you're ever lucky enough

539
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
to hear the other side of a story like that,

540
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
they're often just frustrated with people

541
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
who can so easily view them like that

542
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
if they have a few arguments.

543
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Wiseau tried to make a film about his breakup,

544
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
but it turned out to be a film about his inability

545
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
to understand why it happened.

546
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
No. No.

547
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
No more.

548
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The Room is a filmed version

549
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
of the real, heavily distorted perspective

550
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
on breakups that many heterosexual men often have,

551
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
and in many ways, when you look at the film this way,

552
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
it serves as a call to action

553
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
to learn to see past the leases we think we see

554
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
and understand that relationships

555
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
tend to fall apart for a reason,

556
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
and we can learn to do better

557
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
by seeing people for who they are.

558
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
For all its actual flaws,

559
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
and even because of some of its clearly

560
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
deeply flawed misogynistic writing,

561
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
The Room ends up being

562
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
an actually valuable demonstration

563
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
of the distorted ways people perceive relationships

564
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and how this eventually destroys them

565
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
better than any film made by, say,

566
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I don't know, any man actually working

567
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
in Hollywood right now,

568
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
especially the ones currently cashing in

569
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
on the popularity of The Room.

570
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Hi! I'm he...

571
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
AH!

572
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Gah!

573
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Ah!

574
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
As you might be aware,

575
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
EA recently closed Visceral Games,

576
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
the studio working on a Star Wars game

577
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
that had been in the works for a long time,

578
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
being worked on by M. Night Shyamalan

579
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
being worked on by, among many others,

580
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
the director and writer of most of the Uncharted games,

581
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
but also one of the best-written game series ever,

582
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Legacy of Kain,

583
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
and pivoting the entire game away from what was being made.

584
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
This update, posted on EA's website by Patrick Suderland,

585
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
vice president of EA,

586
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
cites

587
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
fundamental shifts in the marketplace.

588
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Single-player linear experiences

589
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
simply aren't profitable enough,

590
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
at least compared to certain other recent kinds of experience

591
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
that emphasize time investment

592
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and incentivize further transactions

593
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
made over the course of a single product

594
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
rather than a simple one-off purchase.

595
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
This is one of many management decisions

596
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
that exists in a marketplace

597
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
driven by the forces inherent to a capitalist society.

598
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
The decision is, sadly,

599
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
the result of the overall company goal

600
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
to continue to grow and satisfy investors,

601
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
and this practice trumps creative freedom

602
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
or what games players might actually want to see.

603
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Penny Arcade covered this story

604
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
by featuring one of the two main characters,

605
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
a stand-in for the author,

606
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
directly, personally calling Patrick Suderland

607
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
an incoherent, art-destroying monster.

608
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Literally, the only thing I know about you

609
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
is that you destroy things.

610
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Jobs, art.

611
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I mean, where should I even start?

612
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
What you did is bad for games,

613
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
bad for gamers,

614
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
and trying to frame it as anything but cowardice

615
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
is offensive.

616
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Penny Arcade is consistently cited as far better than CAD

617
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
because CAD's just a bunch of nonsensical rants,

618
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and it keeps just using violence as a punch.

619
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
No, wait.

620
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
This is Penny Arcade's violence.

621
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
How did this get in here?

622
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
This is obviously hilarious.

623
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Oh, my God, he was killed by a gun.

624
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Ha ha ha.

625
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Here's to another two decades of comedy gold

626
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
and insightful commentary

627
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
on the future of gaming.

628
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Penny Arcade got so popular and influential

629
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
on the back of this stuff

630
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
that its convention, PAX,

631
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
is one of the biggest industry events of the year

632
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
with even major companies showing off games there.

633
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
CAD also had a convention of its own

634
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
for a couple of years labeled Digital Overload,

635
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
and I hesitate to admit,

636
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
things don't get popular enough

637
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
to have an entire convention

638
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
without being at least partially accurate reflections

639
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
of their audience.

640
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I hope the problem here is clear.

641
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Even the most intelligent,

642
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
well-paid, popular,

643
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
and, uh, verbose writers

644
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
gaming culture has to offer

645
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
seem unaware that these decisions

646
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
are not made in a vacuum,

647
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
that games are threatened not

648
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
by a secretive anti-art coward

649
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
but by an environment that systematically crushes

650
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
most of the people who work on them

651
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
in order to make its owners and shareholders

652
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
vastly rich and which has no interest

653
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
in anything's intrinsic value.

654
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Gaming culture is largely unable

655
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
to conceive of this level of socioeconomic criticism,

656
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
of analysis of systemic problems

657
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
and wider issues with society

658
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
beyond one person's individual failings

659
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
and therefore cannot accurately fathom

660
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
exactly what is damaging the things they love.

661
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Instead, they have to fantasize

662
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
about their very own Lisa hiding somewhere in EA

663
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
trying to kill art

664
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
like some kind of fucking Disney villain.

665
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
This is why people hate CAD so much.

666
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Not because it's bad.

667
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
No, bad things come and go all day.

668
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Every day.

669
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
CAD is such a source of focus and aggression

670
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
with millions and millions of words

671
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
written about how awful it and its creator is

672
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
because it's an embarrassment.

673
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
It makes everyone else near it look bad

674
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
because as bad as it is,

675
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
it managed to be honest.

676
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
So people have to try as hard as they can

677
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
to project these things away from them,

678
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
try to shift the blame onto Buckley himself

679
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
and away from the fact they share

680
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
a lot of the same perspectives.

681
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Think again about that Jack Thompson comic.

682
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
No one just ends up in a position

683
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
where they'll write something like this all on their own.

684
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Jack Thompson, wrong and dishonest as he was,

685
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
received thousands of death threats

686
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
and messages full of harassment for years

687
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
from people just like Tim

688
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
or people who had been influenced by this comic.

689
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
No, CAD is merely a particularly silly

690
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
and vulgar expression of a broader set of bad ideas

691
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
that continue to go largely unexamined

692
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
by the people who hold them.

693
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Tim Buckley's disjointed personal philosophy

694
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
and lack of skill didn't come from nowhere.

695
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
We don't get to pretend he's just some random guy.

696
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Blaming one man for the flaws of a broken economic system

697
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
is making the same mistake as blaming Tim Buckley

698
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
for accurately presenting the culture in which he exists.

699
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
We just have to learn to accept

700
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
that there might be a lesson in things we hate about us,

701
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
that even if it's bad and we don't like it,

702
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
we have more in common with it than we want to admit

703
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
and can even learn something from it.

704
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
CAD turned out to be reflective

705
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
of the cultural reality that produced it,

706
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
and people are only angry at it this much

707
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
because they don't like what they saw in the mirror.

708
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
You all right?

709
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Oh, my God.

710
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Oh, my God.

711
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:54,000
When we look at ridiculous behaviour within our sphere,

712
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
instead of trying to project it out of ourselves,

713
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
say it's just some random idiot somewhere

714
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
doing something dumb,

715
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
maybe we should accept that CAD, Penny Arcade, Visceral Games,

716
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
and even EA's business decisions

717
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
are aspects of a wider culture

718
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
that can be reflective of our own feelings

719
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
and beliefs and values,

720
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
even if we don't like what comes out of them.

721
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And maybe if we learn to criticise ourselves

722
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
and change our own behaviour,

723
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
we can start to change the wider culture.

724
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Thank you for your time.

725
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I must set aright that which has been made wrong.

my best friend,

the love of my life.

I promise,

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I promised

735
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I would never hurt you,

736
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
that I would never leave you.

737
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I have to break that promise.

738
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I'm so sorry.

739
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Video games,

740
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I love you.

741
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Ah!

742
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It's time.

743
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Yes.

744
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Yes!

745
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Yes.

746
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Yes!

747
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Sing Now

748
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Come on, come on.

749
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Come on, come on.
