00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hi, I'm Harriton Splimby, and welcome to Serious Law Analysis.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Oh, fucking...

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Just... fucking...

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
You will pay for what you have done.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
...

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
...

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
...

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
...

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
...

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Today on Serious Law Analysis,

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
we're covering a creative work that I heavily implied

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
might have been coming next in the last few videos.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
And that's right, today we're covering

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
the Control-Alt-Delete Webcomic and Animated series.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
In retrospect, I think I might have made it too obvious.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
For those of you too young to remember the early days of the world,

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
before we had the Internet and hadn't yet achieved the dream

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
of having to argue with Holocaust deniers all day,

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
humans would amuse themselves by painting stuff on the walls of their caves

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
or later drawing it onto paper or canvas.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
These scribbles became known as...

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
...

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Eventually, however, humans evolved past this bullshit

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
and realized you could divide up your space into smaller subspaces

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
called Parnells and then use that to create several sequential images,

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
which when read in order could tell a story.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
This sequence art later became known as comics

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
for reasons we forgot because it doesn't matter.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Fast forward to the late 90s and early 2000s

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
where we played video games and things were finally good.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Then people who enjoyed video games gained access to the Internet.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
But because they didn't yet have the bandwidth

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
to play most games online or watch puppy compilations all day

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
and argue in the comments about 9-11,

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
people instead would amuse themselves online by using webcomics,

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
also known as digital versions of comics that you find on the web.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
And since the bar for publishing onto the Internet

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
was as low as being able to afford server hosting

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
or even lower if you used a free website,

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
people were finally free to create comics

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
for a small or niche in audiences they liked

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
without any need for mass market appeal

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
or the production costs of ink and paper and printing

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
or, um, quality.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Enter the gaming webcomic,

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
a form of webcomic centering around jokes about games and gaming culture,

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
the most popular of these was Penny Arcade,

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
a comic still going to this day,

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
rife with hilarious and well-thought-out humor.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Don't state me, bro! Ha ha ha!

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Hilarious! It's just like the thing!

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
With the guy!

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
The bedrock of this type of comic tends to feature several characters,

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
often representative of the authors,

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
sitting on a couch making hilarious jokes

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
about video games that are out right now

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
or inside the fiction of a video game

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
interacting with it to hilarious consequences.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
These two forms were the bedrock

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
of many early gaming webcomics

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
from the late 90s to the early 2000s,

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
and there were many successful comics using this format

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
like Penny Arcade, PvP, Little Gamers,

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Bob & George, 8-Bit Theater, and others.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
All tremendous pieces of art

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
with a lot to say about games

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
and how bad it is that our games are being usurped by money men

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
and how funny it would be if you died

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
in a way a lot bigger like it's just like in the game.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
But for every one of these comics,

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
there were dozens of poor imitators

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
out to replicate their popularity and profit

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
by reusing the same tropes.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
An explosion in the gaming webcomic had begun,

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
and it would continue for over a decade.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Enter Tim Buckley with his own webcomic,

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Control-Alt-Delete, often referred to as CAD.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
CAD isn't like the other webcomics.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
It's not art. It doesn't have value or meaning.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
It's trash, and it doesn't say anything at all.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
It's full of worthless jokes where the punchline is violence.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
It's not like Penny Arcade. CAD is the story of Ethan,

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
a character who looks suspiciously like

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
how Buckley draws himself.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Ethan and his roommate Lucas talk about video games

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
and occasionally are inside the games

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
where something bad happens to them or people they don't like.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Wow, that's original.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
Let's compare and contrast this with a good comic, shall we?

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
In this 2002 page from Penny Arcade,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
the author insert characters burn a voodoo doll

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
hurting George Romero.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Oh, my God, look how much better these guys are.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
This is great. Meanwhile, look over here

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
at CAD in the slow lane for Idiots

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
using violence as a punchline.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
What a stupid thing to put in a comic.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Over time, CAD stopped even trying to tell jokes,

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
and it started spending more and more time exploring

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
the personal lives and development of its characters.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
The main characters, Ethan and Lucas, went on dates,

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
moved apartments, made and lost friends,

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
and started long-term relationships.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
Ethan quickly meets and begins dating Lila,

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
a girl who plays video games, which, as we all know,

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
is like finding a unicorn,

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
and like all girls who do play games,

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
it's her only character trait.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
The two inexplicably fall in love

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
even though Ethan has nothing to offer anyone

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
and is basically unlikable.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
It's pretty clear from reading this

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
that Buckley doesn't know how human relationships work.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
You could almost point out this...

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
almost says something

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
about how people who play video games a lot

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
view human relationships, but...

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
No, no, no, no, no.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
No, it's bad, and it doesn't mean anything.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
Tim Buckley's just really bad at making comics.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Oh, also, despite being basically unable

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
to do anything but play video games,

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Ethan eventually builds a sentient AI robot

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
who becomes the fourth main character.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Zeke exists to occasionally joke

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
about how humans are made of meat and bad

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
and he's better than them.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
It's clearly inspired by characters

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
like HK-47 from KOTOR or Bender from Futurama,

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
but there's no actual jokes here.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
It's what I like to call a joke by association.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
It's not really a joke.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
It's just a vague gesture

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
in the direction of a joke

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
that you might remember from somewhere else.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Somewhere else.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
I'm somewhere else.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Why are you doing this?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Don't do this to yourself.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Don't become one of them.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
One of what?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
The worst thing about this comic

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
is that it doesn't know what it wants to be.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
No, wait.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Actually, the worst thing is CAD Premium.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
For a few years, you could pay a monthly fee

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
to get access to episodes of the CAD animated series,

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
which the comic inexplicably had.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
It ran for two seasons,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
and some episodes ran up to six minutes.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
If you thought a story featuring cartoon violence,

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
a futuristic killer robot,

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
video game opinions on a couch,

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
and awkward, boring, serious relationship drama

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
had trouble finding its identity in comic form,

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
just wait until it comes in a box set

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
containing barely two hours of animation

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
made in about a week that you paid

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
35 entire dollars of your actual human money for.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Three episodes of the 12-episode first season

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
are dedicated entirely to an extended Star Wars reference.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
They reenact an entire Star Wars film

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
in each five-minute episode,

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
compressing it down so much you'd barely even realize

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
that's what they're doing unless you listen

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
to the director's commentary track,

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
which this show has for some reason.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
The villain, instead of Darth Vader,

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
is Jack Thompson, a lawyer who tried to sue game developers

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
for making their players violent.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
The Death Star is a sign that makes people

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
stop playing video games?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
It's time to test the power

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
of this fully operational anti-gamer billboard.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Speaking of Jack Thompson,

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Thompson appeared to have struck a nerve with Buckley.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
One page of the comic is straight-up

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
an open letter to Jack,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
a four-panel, long mini-novel

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
spoken directly by Buckley himself

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
from within the comic.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
What's amazing about it is how it manages to,

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
while claiming gamers are peaceful

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
even though they've played a lot of violent games,

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
ends with the threatening phrase,

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
which, by the way,

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
is also a line from that scene in Fight Club

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
where they threaten to cut off a guy's testicles

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
if he defies them.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Do not bother us.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Imagine writing something like that

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
and thinking, yeah,

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
that proves that gamers are peaceful

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
and intelligent and can be reasoned with.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
It almost says something about gamers

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
when people sit down and write things like that.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Where's that fucking noise coming from?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Where's...

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
What?

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Don't you think you might be reading a little too much into it

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
about what a bad comic that sucks might say?

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
Stick to thinking about real art.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
Ugh, this is just like that Sonic thing, isn't it?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
The Sonic thing?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
You're overthinking a blue hedgehog, man.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Why can't you be objective?

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Why can't you talk about the level design and mechanics instead?

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
You could be talking about how Mario 1-1

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
teaches you how to play it.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
But it's not just a hedgehog, is it?

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
I mean, it's animals fighting a developed machine empire.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Like, there's very, very obvious themes going on here,

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
a discussion of ecology versus technology.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
If you want to talk about how great nature is

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
and how bad technology is,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
why don't you go live in the woods?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
You wouldn't do that, though, would you?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
You wouldn't have your precious lattes to drink

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
while you complain on your iPhone about capitalism.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
I don't drink lattes. What the fuck are you talking about?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
By now, you've probably noticed

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
a fairly strong contradiction in the comic.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
Between the crass, random, non-canon of the many parts

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
intended purely for no-strings-attached comedy,

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
the serious parts where Buckley himself

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
definitely doesn't personally threaten someone,

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
and the actual serious lives of the main characters

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
who have problems that don't go away,

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
the comic keeps reverberating back and forth,

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
going to further and further extremes.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
Sometimes you'd get a story where Lucas goes on a date

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
with a woman who turns out to be fat,

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
so he awkwardly pretends to be interested

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
for hilarious comedy,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
and then they go back to her place,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
and it turns out she was only pretending

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
to be fat as a test,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
and they start a relationship that lasts

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
for five years of the comic?

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
Then you'd get a chef character saying nonsense for a joke,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
and then something random happens,

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
or maybe you'd get the players, four characters

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
whose whole deal is they murder each other

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
in different ways over and over.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Then it turns out Ethan's girlfriend is pregnant.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Then they joke about what if the guns in the new

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Gears of War game were guns with trains

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
instead of chainsaws?

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
You snap back and forth so quickly,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
you get whiplash of the mind.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
The tension between the comic's supposed reality

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
and meaningless comic fantasy world

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
eventually snapped when,

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
during a scene at Ethan's job where he's making a joke

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
about consumers being stupid

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
and not knowing as much about games as him,

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
he gets a phone call.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Lila, the comedy video game girlfriend character,

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
is in the hospital

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
because she's had a miscarriage.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
This culminates in perhaps

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
the most well-known page of a comic

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
in history.

12:20.000 --> 12:34.000
♪

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
When asked by a noted art scholar

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
the appropriate distance from which to stand

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
when viewing his magnum opus,

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
plainly entitled

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Loss,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Tim Buckley famously responded,

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
What?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Fuck you!

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
and banned me from his forum.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
The release of Loss profoundly shook

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
the edifice of its audience.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
People were equal parts

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
shocked, horrified, surprised,

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
offended,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
and completely mystified.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
The semi-serious but still mostly jokey

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
plot parts of the story are utterly shattered,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
giving way to a harsh and cold reality

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
where characters in other contexts

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
have committed or received

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
tremendous acts of violence,

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
only capable of a genuine moment

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
of horrific suffering.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
A comic famous for using too many words

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
to say nothing at all about a video game

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
on a stationary couch

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
takes four panels and zero words

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
to show a horrifying discovery

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
and a trip through an entire hospital.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
A gaming webcomic,

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
a comedy gaming webcomic,

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
has an arc in it about the characters

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
having to deal with the miscarriage

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
of their child!

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
This comic struck a nerve on the Internet.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Over nine years later,

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
people are still making fun of it.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
This comic has been parodied

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
and referenced in memes

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
an uncountable amount of times.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Entire webpages have been dedicated

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
to tracking them all

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
and failed to contain them.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
In the next two comics,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
the characters struggle to even react

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
to what has happened.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
It's breaking my heart

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
to watch her hurt like this.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
The next comic is a joke about how there aren't

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
enough dragons in Dungeons & Dragons anymore.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
The next comic is a single panel

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
of the four players about to murder each other.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
For the next little while,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
the comic switched between dumb video game jokes

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
and Buckley trying desperately

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
to restore the comfortable,

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
consequence-free tone he had developed

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
over the five years of the comic.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
It takes at least eight pages

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
before Ethan can go back

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
to making goggles out of pineapples.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
By late November,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
the characters have fully patched up their problems

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
and they get married,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
and we get tearful speeches

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
about how important these characters are to each other.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
Life dropped an epic husband,

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
the rarest of its loot table,

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
and I was lucky enough

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
to win the need roll.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
["Cheering"]

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Then, for about four years,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
the comic was basically stand-alone silly jokes

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
interspersed with bits where there were

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
mini-comics set in a universe like Star Wars

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
for some reason.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
One could say that,

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
with the advent of Loss,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
a lesson had been learned.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Don't put one of the most

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
emotionally traumatizing events

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
a human can experience

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
in your...

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
comedy gaming webcomic!

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Then, in September 2012,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Ethan tried to build a time machine

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
and a future version of Ethan comes through it

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
and kidnaps him into the future.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
The next two months of comics were an extended storyline

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
in which it turns out that Ethan's actions

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
destroy most of humanity

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
as the robot he builds eventually goes insane

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
and murders everyone he loves

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
and takes over the world,

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
but in the process,

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
the time machine is damaged

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
and threatens to destroy all of time,

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
so Ethan has to sacrifice himself

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
to turn the machine off,

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
killing him and saving the future

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
as his inner monologue makes a tearful goodbye

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
to a character no one really cares about

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
because she's basically just written to be

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
a love interest for the author stand-in.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Ethan, our main character, dies.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
He dies in the most convoluted fashion possible

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
and no one ever learns what happened.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Now that's how you end a...

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
gaming webcomic.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Except it didn't end.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
It's still been going for five more years,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
but with just the self-contained sketches

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
and the characters from the old version

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
in a rebooted form,

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
the comic somehow continues to limp on.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
It literally killed its main character

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
and then it just sort of started again.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
So that...

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
THAT was CAD.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
CAD was mean-spirited,

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
hateful, and angry.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
CAD was, uh, uh,

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
judgmental, tone-deaf,

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
self-righteous screed of a webcomic.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
And...

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Wait.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
I'm warning you.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Don't do this, man.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Don't go there.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Sorry, are you talking to someone?

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Is there someone here?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Doesn't CAD...

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
say something about gamer culture?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Stop!

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
No! No!

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
What have you done?!

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
What have you done?!

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
What's happening?

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Why?

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
It's caused this crisis.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
It's caused this virus.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
These games aren't fitting for one of us.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
They are responsible.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
We are responsible.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
We haven't done hyving these people,

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
They know bemoaning them.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Don't fuck with us.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
What...?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Hi, I'm Heritan Splimbi,

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
and welcome to...

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
What the fuck is happening?!

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
What just happened here?

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Tommy Wiseau's infamous film,

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
The Room,

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
asks some really interesting questions

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
about how we look at art.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
No, seriously, come on!

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Stay with me here!

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
In terms of pure filmmaking skill,

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
of course, it's awful.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
The script is a nightmare.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
It's poorly edited,

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
with random shots of San Francisco

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
just kind of slammed in there.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
It has such below-average shot composition

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
and mise-en-scene

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
that I actually feel bad

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
for even saying those words,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
and the ADR is terrible, too.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
Yeah, can I have a dozen red roses, please?

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Oh, hi, Johnny. I didn't know it was you.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Here you go.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
That's me.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
How much is it?

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
It'll be $18.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Here you go. Keep the change.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Hi, doggie.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
You're my favorite customer.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Thanks a lot. Bye.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
It has a reputation

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
for being a hilariously bad film

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
everyone can laugh at for being bad.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
He's a bad movie!

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Made even more interesting

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
by the incredibly weird performance of Wiseau.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
I've fed up with this world!

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
But I think, under the proper lens,

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
the film has a little more to say to its audience

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
than, look at me, I'm so bad.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Tommy Wiseau didn't write a film

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
about a perfect guy

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
who gets cheated on by his girlfriend

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
and basically has his life ruined for no reason,

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
and he didn't choose to play that perfect guy

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
for no reason either.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
And here, taking a particular critical look,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
I think a valuable message

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
can be learned from the film.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
The film has often been criticized

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
in terms of its base components

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
like writing or acting.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Lisa, for example,

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
behaves completely irrationally

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
or perhaps with deliberate malice towards Johnny.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
I have him wrapped around my little finger.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Oh, you should be happy then.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
But I don't love him.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Suddenly falling out of love with him

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
and cheating on him and then spreading lies about him

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
for seemingly no reason.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
You are lying. I never hit you.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
You are tearing me apart, Lisa!

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Why are you so hysterical?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
I contend here

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
that Wiseau based the play script

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
that would later become the film

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
on an actual life experience,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
an actual breakup that really happened

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
at some point in his life.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
I treat you like a princess,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
and you stab me in the back.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
I loved you, and I did anything for you

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
to just please you,

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
and now you betray me.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
How could you love him?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Aah!

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
I'm not saying the events happened

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
exactly as Tommy writes them.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
In fact, they definitely didn't.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Obviously, Tommy didn't kill himself,

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
and obviously, women don't grow distant

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
from the people they're in a relationship with

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
for no reason.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Women change their minds all the time.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
The Room is a fictionalized,

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
exaggerated representation

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
of what Tommy thinks happened

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
in this real relationship,

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
being completely, perhaps even incoherently honest

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
about why he thinks it fell apart,

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
and it's clear that he thinks it fell apart

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
because his girlfriend started acting weird

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
and crazy and trying to hurt him.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
What's important here is to understand

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
that to Tommy,

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
this is genuinely how he views this woman.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
This character is to him

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
an honest expression of that person,

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
but there has to have been a real Lisa once,

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
and her perspective,

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
her side of the story, isn't told.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
We don't get to see the things Tommy did

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
that led her to move on from him or cheat on him,

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
and we only have Tommy's word

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
that he wasn't abusive and was a really good guy,

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
and maybe the fact he genuinely thought

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
to depict this woman as a monster

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
trying to ruin his life

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
says something about how he understands

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
other people and their feelings.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
The Room, precisely with its unrealistic,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
biased inaccuracy,

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
accurately depicts why breakups actually happen.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
People don't fully understand

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
how the other person feels

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
and begin to think of them as malicious figures

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
because that's the only way we can make sense of people

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
when we don't fully understand them.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
I've talked to plenty of guys about breakups,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
and very often you get the same old story

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
just like this one where their partner

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
turned out to be a crazy bitch

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
who just wanted to hurt them,

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
but if you're ever lucky enough

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
to hear the other side of a story like that,

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
they're often just frustrated with people

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
who can so easily view them like that

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
if they have a few arguments.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
Wiseau tried to make a film about his breakup,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
but it turned out to be a film about his inability

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
to understand why it happened.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
No. No.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
No more.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
The Room is a filmed version

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
of the real, heavily distorted perspective

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
on breakups that many heterosexual men often have,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
and in many ways, when you look at the film this way,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
it serves as a call to action

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
to learn to see past the leases we think we see

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
and understand that relationships

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
tend to fall apart for a reason,

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
and we can learn to do better

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
by seeing people for who they are.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
For all its actual flaws,

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
and even because of some of its clearly

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
deeply flawed misogynistic writing,

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
The Room ends up being

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
an actually valuable demonstration

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
of the distorted ways people perceive relationships

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
and how this eventually destroys them

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
better than any film made by, say,

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
I don't know, any man actually working

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
in Hollywood right now,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
especially the ones currently cashing in

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
on the popularity of The Room.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Hi! I'm he...

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
AH!

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Gah!

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Ah!

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
As you might be aware,

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
EA recently closed Visceral Games,

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
the studio working on a Star Wars game

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
that had been in the works for a long time,

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
being worked on by M. Night Shyamalan

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
being worked on by, among many others,

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
the director and writer of most of the Uncharted games,

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
but also one of the best-written game series ever,

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Legacy of Kain,

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
and pivoting the entire game away from what was being made.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
This update, posted on EA's website by Patrick Suderland,

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
vice president of EA,

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
cites

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
fundamental shifts in the marketplace.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Single-player linear experiences

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
simply aren't profitable enough,

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
at least compared to certain other recent kinds of experience

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
that emphasize time investment

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
and incentivize further transactions

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
made over the course of a single product

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
rather than a simple one-off purchase.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
This is one of many management decisions

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
that exists in a marketplace

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
driven by the forces inherent to a capitalist society.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
The decision is, sadly,

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
the result of the overall company goal

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
to continue to grow and satisfy investors,

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
and this practice trumps creative freedom

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
or what games players might actually want to see.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Penny Arcade covered this story

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
by featuring one of the two main characters,

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
a stand-in for the author,

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
directly, personally calling Patrick Suderland

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
an incoherent, art-destroying monster.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Literally, the only thing I know about you

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
is that you destroy things.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Jobs, art.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
I mean, where should I even start?

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
What you did is bad for games,

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
bad for gamers,

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
and trying to frame it as anything but cowardice

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
is offensive.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
Penny Arcade is consistently cited as far better than CAD

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
because CAD's just a bunch of nonsensical rants,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
and it keeps just using violence as a punch.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
No, wait.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
This is Penny Arcade's violence.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
How did this get in here?

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
This is obviously hilarious.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Oh, my God, he was killed by a gun.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Ha ha ha.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
Here's to another two decades of comedy gold

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
and insightful commentary

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
on the future of gaming.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Penny Arcade got so popular and influential

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
on the back of this stuff

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
that its convention, PAX,

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
is one of the biggest industry events of the year

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
with even major companies showing off games there.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
CAD also had a convention of its own

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
for a couple of years labeled Digital Overload,

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
and I hesitate to admit,

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
things don't get popular enough

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
to have an entire convention

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
without being at least partially accurate reflections

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
of their audience.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
I hope the problem here is clear.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Even the most intelligent,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
well-paid, popular,

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
and, uh, verbose writers

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
gaming culture has to offer

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
seem unaware that these decisions

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
are not made in a vacuum,

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
that games are threatened not

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
by a secretive anti-art coward

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
but by an environment that systematically crushes

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
most of the people who work on them

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
in order to make its owners and shareholders

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
vastly rich and which has no interest

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
in anything's intrinsic value.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Gaming culture is largely unable

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
to conceive of this level of socioeconomic criticism,

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
of analysis of systemic problems

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
and wider issues with society

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
beyond one person's individual failings

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
and therefore cannot accurately fathom

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
exactly what is damaging the things they love.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Instead, they have to fantasize

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
about their very own Lisa hiding somewhere in EA

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
trying to kill art

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
like some kind of fucking Disney villain.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
This is why people hate CAD so much.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Not because it's bad.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
No, bad things come and go all day.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
Every day.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
CAD is such a source of focus and aggression

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
with millions and millions of words

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
written about how awful it and its creator is

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
because it's an embarrassment.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
It makes everyone else near it look bad

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
because as bad as it is,

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
it managed to be honest.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
So people have to try as hard as they can

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
to project these things away from them,

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
try to shift the blame onto Buckley himself

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
and away from the fact they share

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
a lot of the same perspectives.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
Think again about that Jack Thompson comic.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
No one just ends up in a position

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
where they'll write something like this all on their own.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
Jack Thompson, wrong and dishonest as he was,

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
received thousands of death threats

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
and messages full of harassment for years

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
from people just like Tim

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
or people who had been influenced by this comic.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
No, CAD is merely a particularly silly

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
and vulgar expression of a broader set of bad ideas

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
that continue to go largely unexamined

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
by the people who hold them.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Tim Buckley's disjointed personal philosophy

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
and lack of skill didn't come from nowhere.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
We don't get to pretend he's just some random guy.

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
Blaming one man for the flaws of a broken economic system

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
is making the same mistake as blaming Tim Buckley

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
for accurately presenting the culture in which he exists.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
We just have to learn to accept

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
that there might be a lesson in things we hate about us,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
that even if it's bad and we don't like it,

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
we have more in common with it than we want to admit

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
and can even learn something from it.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
CAD turned out to be reflective

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
of the cultural reality that produced it,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
and people are only angry at it this much

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
because they don't like what they saw in the mirror.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
You all right?

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
Oh, my God.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
Oh, my God.

29:39.000 --> 29:54.000
When we look at ridiculous behaviour within our sphere,

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
instead of trying to project it out of ourselves,

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
say it's just some random idiot somewhere

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
doing something dumb,

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
maybe we should accept that CAD, Penny Arcade, Visceral Games,

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
and even EA's business decisions

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
are aspects of a wider culture

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
that can be reflective of our own feelings

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
and beliefs and values,

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
even if we don't like what comes out of them.

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
And maybe if we learn to criticise ourselves

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
and change our own behaviour,

30:25.000 --> 30:32.000
we can start to change the wider culture.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Thank you for your time.

30:37.000 --> 30:44.000
I must set aright that which has been made wrong.

my best friend,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
the love of my life.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
I promise,

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
I promised

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
I would never hurt you,

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
that I would never leave you.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
I have to break that promise.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
I'm so sorry.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Video games,

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
I love you.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Ah!

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
It's time.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
Yes.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
Yes!

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
Yes.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
Yes!

33:19.000 --> 33:24.000
Sing Now

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Come on, come on.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Come on, come on.
