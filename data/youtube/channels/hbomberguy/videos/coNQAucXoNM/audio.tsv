0	2500	We need to save Tracer's victory pose.
2500	4300	The feminazis are coming to get us!
4300	6800	Oh no, he's too sexy! Change him!
6800	8080	Change him! EEEEH!
8080	10700	["Metal Gear Solid 3 Main Theme"]
10700	11400	["Metal Gear Solid 3 Main Theme"]
11400	14300	An argument I see fairly often is that male characters in video games
14300	17500	set just as many ridiculous standards for men as their female counterparts
17500	19400	and are objectified just as much.
19400	22200	So the question is, objectified by who?
22200	25800	To understand objectification, we really need to understand power fantasy.
25800	28600	A power fantasy is designed to make you feel powerful.
28600	30400	Stop me if I'm going too quickly for you.
30400	34200	Games are especially good at this because player interaction gives a sense of direct involvement
34200	35400	in the events on screen.
35400	39000	You get to pretend you're the muscle man badass inside your flicker box,
39000	42300	and given that you're literally controlling their actions, you kind of are.
42300	44800	When beated in God of War, the player doesn't say,
44800	48600	"'Oh dear, Kratos, the character over whom I exert control has been killed,'
48600	49300	they say,
49300	50500	"'I'm dead!'
50500	51300	I'm dead.
51900	54000	Noooo! They killed me!
54000	56500	The player is encouraged to identify with Kratos
56500	60400	and vicariously feel the effects of his actions, which they literally control.
60400	64800	And together, the player helps Kratos get his various flimsily justified revenges
64800	68400	by being very good at committing killicide on a variety of fantasy creatures
68400	70000	and having sex with ladies.
70000	72500	The game even gives you an achievement for it, as if to say,
72500	74500	"'Yeah, well done. You did it.'"
76500	79600	He's also ridiculously buff because it's nice to briefly pretend
79600	82000	to be someone the opposite sex might find attractive.
82000	85300	But is Kratos an actually, objectively attractive character?
85300	88800	Or is he merely what the creators and players might think is attractive?
88800	92400	There's the old joke that men grow beards in order to try and look more attractive to women,
92400	96900	but their newfound hirsute pursuits tend to only get them compliments from other straight men.
97300	101100	Brad Pitt thinks he looks really cool in this picture,
101100	104300	but women think Brad looks really cool in this picture.
104700	107000	Is it generalizing to say women don't like beards?
107300	110400	No. No women like beards. They all hate them.
110400	113900	If you say you like beards, you are wrong! You hate them!
113900	115500	Obviously, there are lots of tastes out there,
115500	120700	but would you say a majority of wombs or gams want to go out on the town and run into this guy?
120700	122900	Watch out! He might score you an achievement,
122900	127100	but he might tie you to a gear and murder you just to keep the washroom open.
127100	129900	Kratos doesn't set ridiculous standards for men
129900	134200	because the objective is to make the male player feel like they already are that person
134200	135900	through the simulation of the game world.
135900	140000	Let's stop and think for a moment about how players view their avatars as they play games.
140000	141300	Let's look at Bayonetta.
141300	145800	In Bayonetta, the plot is laid out in such a way that Bayonetta engages with it directly,
145800	147300	but you don't.
147300	150400	Two hours in, they're still introducing characters you haven't seen before,
150400	154100	but Bayonetta has a clear history with that goes just unexplained enough
154100	157600	that you're kept at arm's length from really identifying with her and her struggle.
157600	160800	She's externalized from the player, keeping you at arm's length.
160800	163400	Kratos has an explicit mission and a straightforward story.
163400	165300	It's bland, but it's understandable.
165300	167500	You're invited to identify on some level with him,
167500	170700	or at least be able to put yourself in his shoes during murder-thons.
170700	173400	But Bayonetta's kept mysterious, doing her own thing.
173400	176800	The game never really invites the player to sympathize with her situation.
176800	180900	Bayonetta is someone else who you happen to control to help achieve her goals.
180900	183100	Also, instead of simply being a good fighter,
183100	187900	her animations are worked out to be dances and pseudo-strip-teases for your amusement as you play.
187900	189900	This even extends to the female enemies.
189900	194400	Sometimes pulling off a special on a boss nets the sort of thing I would normally watch incognito in my browser.
194400	197900	I'm not feeling engaged by the characters or getting immersed in the story.
197900	200900	This is happening because someone thought I would enjoy seeing it happen,
200900	203400	but I didn't need to be pandered to like this, you know?
203400	205100	I was enjoying the game already.
205100	209700	All this do is make it a lot more embarrassing if someone walks in while you're recording this footage.
209700	211800	Now, you see, Mum, this is really empowering.
211800	212700	Don't you get it?
212700	214800	This is what progressive video games look like.
214800	217600	Oh, boy, I can dress her up in a sexy Samus cosplay.
217600	220900	Hang on. Why do they need to alter the Samus costume to be more sexy?
220900	223400	They already made a sexy costume for Samus.
223400	225300	It's called the Phazon suit.
225300	226700	Aw, yeah!
226700	231500	No, I'm not going to decry Bayonetta's character designs or overt sexuality.
231500	234100	I'm what people seem to call a sex-positive feminist.
234100	237600	I've heard some really good things about sex, and I'd love to try it sometime.
237600	241500	Numerous think pieces have been written on the Tumblrs about how Bayonetta is a feminist character
241500	244400	and the games generally have a progressive message, and I kind of agree.
244400	248000	The characters' powers are implied to be literally powered by feminine sexuality
248000	250700	in a way that presents it as something to be truly reckoned with,
250700	255800	a force that transgresses garbage patriarchal religious figures and heralds major systemic change.
255900	260100	It's cool and a nice twist on the rather more traditional types of female character
260100	262000	who dress like this for no reason.
262000	265900	Please leave a comment explaining how it's actually very empowering to be a tit ninja.
265900	272800	All I'm saying is Hideki Kamiu's character doesn't feel like a fulfillment of his fantasies of who he wants to be like.
272800	275200	It feels like a fantasy of someone he wants to watch.
275200	278700	I kind of think he's trying to have his cheesecake and eat it
278700	281600	by making a game about an empowered woman being heroic
281600	285100	but making sure you get a nice long look at all of her as she does it.
285100	289600	So between the two games, we're seeing two different sides of what's ultimately the same fantasy.
289600	292000	Bayonetta may be an empowered female character,
292000	295900	but she's empowered strictly within the confines of a straight male fantasy.
295900	300100	Games as a whole are sadly lacking explorations of other people's fantasies.
300100	304700	We're at the point where women actually liking your character is unexpected to the creators themselves.
304700	309200	The developers of the Prince of Persia reboot in 2008 were genuinely surprised to discover
309200	312100	that they'd somehow accrued quite a large female demographic.
312100	314400	In surprising contrast to G.O.W.,
314400	317400	Pop is about a young man who acts vaguely like a human,
317400	319300	learns he can't do everything alone,
319300	323300	and grows to respect another person enough to risk his life with them on an adventure together
323300	325300	where they function as two halves of a team.
325300	328700	Perhaps accidentally, the Prince of Prince of Persia of Persia
328700	331500	functions well as a figure of someone else's fantasy.
331500	333500	So now we find out what the real problem is.
333500	336800	People would love to say how great it is that some homosexuals or wombs
336800	339500	might get turned on by revenge man beheads a lot,
339600	341800	but ultimately the target audience isn't those people
341800	346300	because the creators often genuinely don't understand what that part of the audience would want.
346300	350500	Stories that actually cater to those audiences are more likely to happen by accident,
350500	353500	and when a story maybe actively caters to that audience,
353500	355300	guess who starts complaining?
355300	359100	Square Enix even had to change a male character's outfit in Mobius Final Fantasy
359100	361000	because it was deemed too much.
361000	365200	We're seeing a game space consciously being altered to suit the ideals of a specific group
365200	366500	at the exclusion of others.
366500	369900	They didn't cover up this guy because women or gay men preferred him covered up.
369900	372600	They covered it up because someone found it icky.
372600	375600	But where's the uproar? The complaints about self-censorship?
375600	379400	If you move a character two pixels over on the Western version of your box art,
379400	381400	there's an army of people crying foul,
381400	386100	hearts ready to bleed for the creator's vision of how their panties were supposed to look
386100	387600	on an advertisement.
387600	392000	People seem to only care about waging internet war to defend a creator's artistic freedom
392000	394700	when it's the freedom to service them in particular.
394700	399200	The freedom to service someone else is treated like a mistake or mostly ignored.
399200	400500	Save Tracer's butt!
400500	402500	But, eh, whatever.
402500	404100	It's just a costume change.
404100	405300	Why get hot and bothered aboutâ€”
405300	406700	THEY DID WHAT?!
406700	411600	So ultimately what happens is one particular group's fantasies, expectations, and preoccupations
411600	416900	get normalized, and what that group happens to prefer becomes synonymous with good game design.
416900	421900	And this obsession with fulfilling a very specific power fantasy for one particular demographic
421900	425600	isn't just some theoretically bad thing for the feminazis to worry about, eugh.
425600	428500	It genuinely impacts the quality of the games.
428500	430300	Let's look back at God of War's story.
430300	434400	This is a game set in a time of myths which are literally defined as cool stories
434400	436200	that are fun and interesting and timeless,
436200	441600	and yet the game does everything it can to not have a story that isn't an incredibly generic revenge fantasy.
441600	446200	The player isn't made to really care about Kratos' loss or what his family was like or whatever.
446200	449000	They receive the information that his family's dead and he wants revenge
449000	452300	as a flimsy justification for what they were already doing in the game.
452300	454100	It's uncompelling, to say the least.
454100	457800	You can say the story doesn't need to be deep, and it doesn't need to be.
457800	460700	I mean, if you think about it, no story needs to be good.
460700	463300	Heart of Darkness didn't need to be a masterpiece, either.
463300	468100	But imagine for a second if God of War's story was surprisingly meditative on the nature of vengeance
468100	472600	and used the death of the ancient gods as a metaphor for the actual collapse of those belief systems
472600	475800	and Kratos was relatable on some actual emotional level.
475800	479200	You got all the murder, but you got some real character and story with it, too.
479200	482000	Wouldn't players be holding this up as the game they'd always wanted?
482000	484900	Or would it really totally ruin the experience?
484900	489200	When Gears of War 3 inserted some small elements of genuine pathos to the story,
489200	491200	just a smidge, just a whisper, a sniffle,
491200	493900	oh, he took off his hat because his friend died.
493900	495300	Now I know he's sad.
495300	499100	The players who weren't deriding this as gay emotional complexity crap
499100	503100	found it surprisingly touching and that it added something to their experience.
503100	506300	Gears of War 3 delivers some truly emotional moments
506300	509700	and boasts the best storytelling the series has seen so far.
509700	512300	The video I stole this footage from is literally titled
512300	514700	The Saddest Moment in Video Game History.
514700	520400	Gears of War 3 got players to actually feel something about their otherwise bland, one-note characters
520400	523500	and some people heralded that as a beautiful thing,
523500	524700	as well they should.
524700	530200	When Bioshock Infinite bothered to have a vaguely human person attached to this elaborately designed cleavage,
530200	535500	the director of the aforementioned Gears of War lauded it as proof that games had finally become art.
535500	538500	Yeah, sure, maybe more of this isn't needed,
538500	540900	but maybe it would be better.
540900	545000	As games become more recognized as an art form and more differing voices start to be heard,
545000	546500	more visions are emerging,
546500	551200	and people are starting to appreciate them as different visions instead of as objective mistakes.
551200	556100	Even games that used to be action schlock and didn't need a good story are starting to get them.
556100	557600	That's a good thing.
557600	558700	Remember God of War?
558700	563500	Well, now it's back, and it's actually made Kratos into a compelling and interesting human being.
563500	565300	You're still running around hitting stuff with an axe,
565300	569400	but now you're teaching this kid to fight, too, in this scary new world.
569400	571200	You're watching Kratos be a dad.
571200	573200	He's a little out of shape and older and he has a kid,
573200	578300	but he's actually a more attractive character to some people now because he's remotely relatable as a human,
578300	580200	which it turns out is a real turn-on.
580200	581100	That's right.
581100	583500	We're finally getting an interesting God of War story.
583500	585700	It took 11 years, but we did it!
585700	588800	But now the bar's been raised, the sequel needs to go even further.
588800	592000	How about a QuickTime event where, if you press X with the right timing,
592000	593500	Kratos marries Brad Pitt,
593500	596100	and he convinces him to never grow a beard,
596100	599700	and they spend their old age together raising dogs in an old folks' home.
599700	601600	And in the next game, you play as the dog.
601600	606900	The dog ties little chainsaws to his arms to save his dog husband from Zoroastrianism or something,
606900	611400	and it's a gay dog who got married and they had a cute ceremony in the beginning before he gets kidnapped.
611400	612800	Look, Sony, just give me a call.
612800	615700	I have a 156-page treatment for Dog of War.
628900	629700	Thanks for watching.
629700	631400	This week, I'd like to personally thank...
642800	650300	...Williams, David Rose, Desmond R., Ed Costigan, Femininja, Graf and Blackpaw, and...
650300	650900	...eh...
650900	651900	...eh...
651900	653500	...HEROINE!
653500	656300	If you'd like to make a video response explaining how I'm a dumb cuck
656300	658200	and straight men need to be the demographic
658200	661400	and how I'm the real sexist and all women secretly love beards,
661400	664900	please make it quickly because I'm working on a video about video responses to my work,
664900	668800	and it would be a shame if your objective, rational, true facts didn't get included.
668800	670800	Wait. What's that noise?
670800	672100	No. Stop!
672100	673100	You can't kill me!
673100	674300	I created you!
674300	675200	I created...
675200	676000	RAAAAAAAGH!
