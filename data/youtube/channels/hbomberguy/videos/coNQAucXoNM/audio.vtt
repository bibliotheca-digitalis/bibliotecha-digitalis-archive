WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.500
We need to save Tracer's victory pose.

00:02.500 --> 00:04.300
The feminazis are coming to get us!

00:04.300 --> 00:06.800
Oh no, he's too sexy! Change him!

00:06.800 --> 00:08.080
Change him! EEEEH!

00:08.080 --> 00:10.700
["Metal Gear Solid 3 Main Theme"]

00:10.700 --> 00:11.400
["Metal Gear Solid 3 Main Theme"]

00:11.400 --> 00:14.300
An argument I see fairly often is that male characters in video games

00:14.300 --> 00:17.500
set just as many ridiculous standards for men as their female counterparts

00:17.500 --> 00:19.400
and are objectified just as much.

00:19.400 --> 00:22.200
So the question is, objectified by who?

00:22.200 --> 00:25.800
To understand objectification, we really need to understand power fantasy.

00:25.800 --> 00:28.600
A power fantasy is designed to make you feel powerful.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.400
Stop me if I'm going too quickly for you.

00:30.400 --> 00:34.200
Games are especially good at this because player interaction gives a sense of direct involvement

00:34.200 --> 00:35.400
in the events on screen.

00:35.400 --> 00:39.000
You get to pretend you're the muscle man badass inside your flicker box,

00:39.000 --> 00:42.300
and given that you're literally controlling their actions, you kind of are.

00:42.300 --> 00:44.800
When beated in God of War, the player doesn't say,

00:44.800 --> 00:48.600
"'Oh dear, Kratos, the character over whom I exert control has been killed,'

00:48.600 --> 00:49.300
they say,

00:49.300 --> 00:50.500
"'I'm dead!'

00:50.500 --> 00:51.300
I'm dead.

00:51.900 --> 00:54.000
Noooo! They killed me!

00:54.000 --> 00:56.500
The player is encouraged to identify with Kratos

00:56.500 --> 01:00.400
and vicariously feel the effects of his actions, which they literally control.

01:00.400 --> 01:04.800
And together, the player helps Kratos get his various flimsily justified revenges

01:04.800 --> 01:08.400
by being very good at committing killicide on a variety of fantasy creatures

01:08.400 --> 01:10.000
and having sex with ladies.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.500
The game even gives you an achievement for it, as if to say,

01:12.500 --> 01:14.500
"'Yeah, well done. You did it.'"

01:16.500 --> 01:19.600
He's also ridiculously buff because it's nice to briefly pretend

01:19.600 --> 01:22.000
to be someone the opposite sex might find attractive.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.300
But is Kratos an actually, objectively attractive character?

01:25.300 --> 01:28.800
Or is he merely what the creators and players might think is attractive?

01:28.800 --> 01:32.400
There's the old joke that men grow beards in order to try and look more attractive to women,

01:32.400 --> 01:36.900
but their newfound hirsute pursuits tend to only get them compliments from other straight men.

01:37.300 --> 01:41.100
Brad Pitt thinks he looks really cool in this picture,

01:41.100 --> 01:44.300
but women think Brad looks really cool in this picture.

01:44.700 --> 01:47.000
Is it generalizing to say women don't like beards?

01:47.300 --> 01:50.400
No. No women like beards. They all hate them.

01:50.400 --> 01:53.900
If you say you like beards, you are wrong! You hate them!

01:53.900 --> 01:55.500
Obviously, there are lots of tastes out there,

01:55.500 --> 02:00.700
but would you say a majority of wombs or gams want to go out on the town and run into this guy?

02:00.700 --> 02:02.900
Watch out! He might score you an achievement,

02:02.900 --> 02:07.100
but he might tie you to a gear and murder you just to keep the washroom open.

02:07.100 --> 02:09.900
Kratos doesn't set ridiculous standards for men

02:09.900 --> 02:14.200
because the objective is to make the male player feel like they already are that person

02:14.200 --> 02:15.900
through the simulation of the game world.

02:15.900 --> 02:20.000
Let's stop and think for a moment about how players view their avatars as they play games.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.300
Let's look at Bayonetta.

02:21.300 --> 02:25.800
In Bayonetta, the plot is laid out in such a way that Bayonetta engages with it directly,

02:25.800 --> 02:27.300
but you don't.

02:27.300 --> 02:30.400
Two hours in, they're still introducing characters you haven't seen before,

02:30.400 --> 02:34.100
but Bayonetta has a clear history with that goes just unexplained enough

02:34.100 --> 02:37.600
that you're kept at arm's length from really identifying with her and her struggle.

02:37.600 --> 02:40.800
She's externalized from the player, keeping you at arm's length.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.400
Kratos has an explicit mission and a straightforward story.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.300
It's bland, but it's understandable.

02:45.300 --> 02:47.500
You're invited to identify on some level with him,

02:47.500 --> 02:50.700
or at least be able to put yourself in his shoes during murder-thons.

02:50.700 --> 02:53.400
But Bayonetta's kept mysterious, doing her own thing.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.800
The game never really invites the player to sympathize with her situation.

02:56.800 --> 03:00.900
Bayonetta is someone else who you happen to control to help achieve her goals.

03:00.900 --> 03:03.100
Also, instead of simply being a good fighter,

03:03.100 --> 03:07.900
her animations are worked out to be dances and pseudo-strip-teases for your amusement as you play.

03:07.900 --> 03:09.900
This even extends to the female enemies.

03:09.900 --> 03:14.400
Sometimes pulling off a special on a boss nets the sort of thing I would normally watch incognito in my browser.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.900
I'm not feeling engaged by the characters or getting immersed in the story.

03:17.900 --> 03:20.900
This is happening because someone thought I would enjoy seeing it happen,

03:20.900 --> 03:23.400
but I didn't need to be pandered to like this, you know?

03:23.400 --> 03:25.100
I was enjoying the game already.

03:25.100 --> 03:29.700
All this do is make it a lot more embarrassing if someone walks in while you're recording this footage.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.800
Now, you see, Mum, this is really empowering.

03:31.800 --> 03:32.700
Don't you get it?

03:32.700 --> 03:34.800
This is what progressive video games look like.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.600
Oh, boy, I can dress her up in a sexy Samus cosplay.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.900
Hang on. Why do they need to alter the Samus costume to be more sexy?

03:40.900 --> 03:43.400
They already made a sexy costume for Samus.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.300
It's called the Phazon suit.

03:45.300 --> 03:46.700
Aw, yeah!

03:46.700 --> 03:51.500
No, I'm not going to decry Bayonetta's character designs or overt sexuality.

03:51.500 --> 03:54.100
I'm what people seem to call a sex-positive feminist.

03:54.100 --> 03:57.600
I've heard some really good things about sex, and I'd love to try it sometime.

03:57.600 --> 04:01.500
Numerous think pieces have been written on the Tumblrs about how Bayonetta is a feminist character

04:01.500 --> 04:04.400
and the games generally have a progressive message, and I kind of agree.

04:04.400 --> 04:08.000
The characters' powers are implied to be literally powered by feminine sexuality

04:08.000 --> 04:10.700
in a way that presents it as something to be truly reckoned with,

04:10.700 --> 04:15.800
a force that transgresses garbage patriarchal religious figures and heralds major systemic change.

04:15.900 --> 04:20.100
It's cool and a nice twist on the rather more traditional types of female character

04:20.100 --> 04:22.000
who dress like this for no reason.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.900
Please leave a comment explaining how it's actually very empowering to be a tit ninja.

04:25.900 --> 04:32.800
All I'm saying is Hideki Kamiu's character doesn't feel like a fulfillment of his fantasies of who he wants to be like.

04:32.800 --> 04:35.200
It feels like a fantasy of someone he wants to watch.

04:35.200 --> 04:38.700
I kind of think he's trying to have his cheesecake and eat it

04:38.700 --> 04:41.600
by making a game about an empowered woman being heroic

04:41.600 --> 04:45.100
but making sure you get a nice long look at all of her as she does it.

04:45.100 --> 04:49.600
So between the two games, we're seeing two different sides of what's ultimately the same fantasy.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.000
Bayonetta may be an empowered female character,

04:52.000 --> 04:55.900
but she's empowered strictly within the confines of a straight male fantasy.

04:55.900 --> 05:00.100
Games as a whole are sadly lacking explorations of other people's fantasies.

05:00.100 --> 05:04.700
We're at the point where women actually liking your character is unexpected to the creators themselves.

05:04.700 --> 05:09.200
The developers of the Prince of Persia reboot in 2008 were genuinely surprised to discover

05:09.200 --> 05:12.100
that they'd somehow accrued quite a large female demographic.

05:12.100 --> 05:14.400
In surprising contrast to G.O.W.,

05:14.400 --> 05:17.400
Pop is about a young man who acts vaguely like a human,

05:17.400 --> 05:19.300
learns he can't do everything alone,

05:19.300 --> 05:23.300
and grows to respect another person enough to risk his life with them on an adventure together

05:23.300 --> 05:25.300
where they function as two halves of a team.

05:25.300 --> 05:28.700
Perhaps accidentally, the Prince of Prince of Persia of Persia

05:28.700 --> 05:31.500
functions well as a figure of someone else's fantasy.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.500
So now we find out what the real problem is.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.800
People would love to say how great it is that some homosexuals or wombs

05:36.800 --> 05:39.500
might get turned on by revenge man beheads a lot,

05:39.600 --> 05:41.800
but ultimately the target audience isn't those people

05:41.800 --> 05:46.300
because the creators often genuinely don't understand what that part of the audience would want.

05:46.300 --> 05:50.500
Stories that actually cater to those audiences are more likely to happen by accident,

05:50.500 --> 05:53.500
and when a story maybe actively caters to that audience,

05:53.500 --> 05:55.300
guess who starts complaining?

05:55.300 --> 05:59.100
Square Enix even had to change a male character's outfit in Mobius Final Fantasy

05:59.100 --> 06:01.000
because it was deemed too much.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.200
We're seeing a game space consciously being altered to suit the ideals of a specific group

06:05.200 --> 06:06.500
at the exclusion of others.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.900
They didn't cover up this guy because women or gay men preferred him covered up.

06:09.900 --> 06:12.600
They covered it up because someone found it icky.

06:12.600 --> 06:15.600
But where's the uproar? The complaints about self-censorship?

06:15.600 --> 06:19.400
If you move a character two pixels over on the Western version of your box art,

06:19.400 --> 06:21.400
there's an army of people crying foul,

06:21.400 --> 06:26.100
hearts ready to bleed for the creator's vision of how their panties were supposed to look

06:26.100 --> 06:27.600
on an advertisement.

06:27.600 --> 06:32.000
People seem to only care about waging internet war to defend a creator's artistic freedom

06:32.000 --> 06:34.700
when it's the freedom to service them in particular.

06:34.700 --> 06:39.200
The freedom to service someone else is treated like a mistake or mostly ignored.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.500
Save Tracer's butt!

06:40.500 --> 06:42.500
But, eh, whatever.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.100
It's just a costume change.

06:44.100 --> 06:45.300
Why get hot and bothered about—

06:45.300 --> 06:46.700
THEY DID WHAT?!

06:46.700 --> 06:51.600
So ultimately what happens is one particular group's fantasies, expectations, and preoccupations

06:51.600 --> 06:56.900
get normalized, and what that group happens to prefer becomes synonymous with good game design.

06:56.900 --> 07:01.900
And this obsession with fulfilling a very specific power fantasy for one particular demographic

07:01.900 --> 07:05.600
isn't just some theoretically bad thing for the feminazis to worry about, eugh.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.500
It genuinely impacts the quality of the games.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.300
Let's look back at God of War's story.

07:10.300 --> 07:14.400
This is a game set in a time of myths which are literally defined as cool stories

07:14.400 --> 07:16.200
that are fun and interesting and timeless,

07:16.200 --> 07:21.600
and yet the game does everything it can to not have a story that isn't an incredibly generic revenge fantasy.

07:21.600 --> 07:26.200
The player isn't made to really care about Kratos' loss or what his family was like or whatever.

07:26.200 --> 07:29.000
They receive the information that his family's dead and he wants revenge

07:29.000 --> 07:32.300
as a flimsy justification for what they were already doing in the game.

07:32.300 --> 07:34.100
It's uncompelling, to say the least.

07:34.100 --> 07:37.800
You can say the story doesn't need to be deep, and it doesn't need to be.

07:37.800 --> 07:40.700
I mean, if you think about it, no story needs to be good.

07:40.700 --> 07:43.300
Heart of Darkness didn't need to be a masterpiece, either.

07:43.300 --> 07:48.100
But imagine for a second if God of War's story was surprisingly meditative on the nature of vengeance

07:48.100 --> 07:52.600
and used the death of the ancient gods as a metaphor for the actual collapse of those belief systems

07:52.600 --> 07:55.800
and Kratos was relatable on some actual emotional level.

07:55.800 --> 07:59.200
You got all the murder, but you got some real character and story with it, too.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.000
Wouldn't players be holding this up as the game they'd always wanted?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.900
Or would it really totally ruin the experience?

08:04.900 --> 08:09.200
When Gears of War 3 inserted some small elements of genuine pathos to the story,

08:09.200 --> 08:11.200
just a smidge, just a whisper, a sniffle,

08:11.200 --> 08:13.900
oh, he took off his hat because his friend died.

08:13.900 --> 08:15.300
Now I know he's sad.

08:15.300 --> 08:19.100
The players who weren't deriding this as gay emotional complexity crap

08:19.100 --> 08:23.100
found it surprisingly touching and that it added something to their experience.

08:23.100 --> 08:26.300
Gears of War 3 delivers some truly emotional moments

08:26.300 --> 08:29.700
and boasts the best storytelling the series has seen so far.

08:29.700 --> 08:32.300
The video I stole this footage from is literally titled

08:32.300 --> 08:34.700
The Saddest Moment in Video Game History.

08:34.700 --> 08:40.400
Gears of War 3 got players to actually feel something about their otherwise bland, one-note characters

08:40.400 --> 08:43.500
and some people heralded that as a beautiful thing,

08:43.500 --> 08:44.700
as well they should.

08:44.700 --> 08:50.200
When Bioshock Infinite bothered to have a vaguely human person attached to this elaborately designed cleavage,

08:50.200 --> 08:55.500
the director of the aforementioned Gears of War lauded it as proof that games had finally become art.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.500
Yeah, sure, maybe more of this isn't needed,

08:58.500 --> 09:00.900
but maybe it would be better.

09:00.900 --> 09:05.000
As games become more recognized as an art form and more differing voices start to be heard,

09:05.000 --> 09:06.500
more visions are emerging,

09:06.500 --> 09:11.200
and people are starting to appreciate them as different visions instead of as objective mistakes.

09:11.200 --> 09:16.100
Even games that used to be action schlock and didn't need a good story are starting to get them.

09:16.100 --> 09:17.600
That's a good thing.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.700
Remember God of War?

09:18.700 --> 09:23.500
Well, now it's back, and it's actually made Kratos into a compelling and interesting human being.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.300
You're still running around hitting stuff with an axe,

09:25.300 --> 09:29.400
but now you're teaching this kid to fight, too, in this scary new world.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.200
You're watching Kratos be a dad.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.200
He's a little out of shape and older and he has a kid,

09:33.200 --> 09:38.300
but he's actually a more attractive character to some people now because he's remotely relatable as a human,

09:38.300 --> 09:40.200
which it turns out is a real turn-on.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.100
That's right.

09:41.100 --> 09:43.500
We're finally getting an interesting God of War story.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.700
It took 11 years, but we did it!

09:45.700 --> 09:48.800
But now the bar's been raised, the sequel needs to go even further.

09:48.800 --> 09:52.000
How about a QuickTime event where, if you press X with the right timing,

09:52.000 --> 09:53.500
Kratos marries Brad Pitt,

09:53.500 --> 09:56.100
and he convinces him to never grow a beard,

09:56.100 --> 09:59.700
and they spend their old age together raising dogs in an old folks' home.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.600
And in the next game, you play as the dog.

10:01.600 --> 10:06.900
The dog ties little chainsaws to his arms to save his dog husband from Zoroastrianism or something,

10:06.900 --> 10:11.400
and it's a gay dog who got married and they had a cute ceremony in the beginning before he gets kidnapped.

10:11.400 --> 10:12.800
Look, Sony, just give me a call.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.700
I have a 156-page treatment for Dog of War.

10:28.900 --> 10:29.700
Thanks for watching.

10:29.700 --> 10:31.400
This week, I'd like to personally thank...

10:42.800 --> 10:50.300
...Williams, David Rose, Desmond R., Ed Costigan, Femininja, Graf and Blackpaw, and...

10:50.300 --> 10:50.900
...eh...

10:50.900 --> 10:51.900
...eh...

10:51.900 --> 10:53.500
...HEROINE!

10:53.500 --> 10:56.300
If you'd like to make a video response explaining how I'm a dumb cuck

10:56.300 --> 10:58.200
and straight men need to be the demographic

10:58.200 --> 11:01.400
and how I'm the real sexist and all women secretly love beards,

11:01.400 --> 11:04.900
please make it quickly because I'm working on a video about video responses to my work,
