1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
We need to save Tracer's victory pose.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,300
The feminazis are coming to get us!

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,800
Oh no, he's too sexy! Change him!

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,080
Change him! EEEEH!

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,700
["Metal Gear Solid 3 Main Theme"]

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,400
["Metal Gear Solid 3 Main Theme"]

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,300
An argument I see fairly often is that male characters in video games

8
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,500
set just as many ridiculous standards for men as their female counterparts

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,400
and are objectified just as much.

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,200
So the question is, objectified by who?

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,800
To understand objectification, we really need to understand power fantasy.

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,600
A power fantasy is designed to make you feel powerful.

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,400
Stop me if I'm going too quickly for you.

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,200
Games are especially good at this because player interaction gives a sense of direct involvement

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,400
in the events on screen.

16
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,000
You get to pretend you're the muscle man badass inside your flicker box,

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,300
and given that you're literally controlling their actions, you kind of are.

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,800
When beated in God of War, the player doesn't say,

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,600
"'Oh dear, Kratos, the character over whom I exert control has been killed,'

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,300
they say,

21
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,500
"'I'm dead!'

22
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,300
I'm dead.

23
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,000
Noooo! They killed me!

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,500
The player is encouraged to identify with Kratos

25
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,400
and vicariously feel the effects of his actions, which they literally control.

26
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,800
And together, the player helps Kratos get his various flimsily justified revenges

27
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,400
by being very good at committing killicide on a variety of fantasy creatures

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,000
and having sex with ladies.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,500
The game even gives you an achievement for it, as if to say,

30
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,500
"'Yeah, well done. You did it.'"

31
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,600
He's also ridiculously buff because it's nice to briefly pretend

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,000
to be someone the opposite sex might find attractive.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,300
But is Kratos an actually, objectively attractive character?

34
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,800
Or is he merely what the creators and players might think is attractive?

35
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,400
There's the old joke that men grow beards in order to try and look more attractive to women,

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,900
but their newfound hirsute pursuits tend to only get them compliments from other straight men.

37
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,100
Brad Pitt thinks he looks really cool in this picture,

38
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,300
but women think Brad looks really cool in this picture.

39
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,000
Is it generalizing to say women don't like beards?

40
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,400
No. No women like beards. They all hate them.

41
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,900
If you say you like beards, you are wrong! You hate them!

42
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,500
Obviously, there are lots of tastes out there,

43
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,700
but would you say a majority of wombs or gams want to go out on the town and run into this guy?

44
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,900
Watch out! He might score you an achievement,

45
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,100
but he might tie you to a gear and murder you just to keep the washroom open.

46
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,900
Kratos doesn't set ridiculous standards for men

47
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,200
because the objective is to make the male player feel like they already are that person

48
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,900
through the simulation of the game world.

49
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,000
Let's stop and think for a moment about how players view their avatars as they play games.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,300
Let's look at Bayonetta.

51
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,800
In Bayonetta, the plot is laid out in such a way that Bayonetta engages with it directly,

52
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,300
but you don't.

53
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,400
Two hours in, they're still introducing characters you haven't seen before,

54
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,100
but Bayonetta has a clear history with that goes just unexplained enough

55
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,600
that you're kept at arm's length from really identifying with her and her struggle.

56
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,800
She's externalized from the player, keeping you at arm's length.

57
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,400
Kratos has an explicit mission and a straightforward story.

58
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,300
It's bland, but it's understandable.

59
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,500
You're invited to identify on some level with him,

60
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,700
or at least be able to put yourself in his shoes during murder-thons.

61
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,400
But Bayonetta's kept mysterious, doing her own thing.

62
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,800
The game never really invites the player to sympathize with her situation.

63
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,900
Bayonetta is someone else who you happen to control to help achieve her goals.

64
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,100
Also, instead of simply being a good fighter,

65
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,900
her animations are worked out to be dances and pseudo-strip-teases for your amusement as you play.

66
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,900
This even extends to the female enemies.

67
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,400
Sometimes pulling off a special on a boss nets the sort of thing I would normally watch incognito in my browser.

68
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,900
I'm not feeling engaged by the characters or getting immersed in the story.

69
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,900
This is happening because someone thought I would enjoy seeing it happen,

70
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,400
but I didn't need to be pandered to like this, you know?

71
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,100
I was enjoying the game already.

72
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,700
All this do is make it a lot more embarrassing if someone walks in while you're recording this footage.

73
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,800
Now, you see, Mum, this is really empowering.

74
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,700
Don't you get it?

75
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,800
This is what progressive video games look like.

76
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,600
Oh, boy, I can dress her up in a sexy Samus cosplay.

77
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,900
Hang on. Why do they need to alter the Samus costume to be more sexy?

78
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,400
They already made a sexy costume for Samus.

79
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,300
It's called the Phazon suit.

80
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,700
Aw, yeah!

81
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,500
No, I'm not going to decry Bayonetta's character designs or overt sexuality.

82
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,100
I'm what people seem to call a sex-positive feminist.

83
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,600
I've heard some really good things about sex, and I'd love to try it sometime.

84
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,500
Numerous think pieces have been written on the Tumblrs about how Bayonetta is a feminist character

85
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,400
and the games generally have a progressive message, and I kind of agree.

86
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,000
The characters' powers are implied to be literally powered by feminine sexuality

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,700
in a way that presents it as something to be truly reckoned with,

88
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,800
a force that transgresses garbage patriarchal religious figures and heralds major systemic change.

89
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,100
It's cool and a nice twist on the rather more traditional types of female character

90
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,000
who dress like this for no reason.

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,900
Please leave a comment explaining how it's actually very empowering to be a tit ninja.

92
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:32,800
All I'm saying is Hideki Kamiu's character doesn't feel like a fulfillment of his fantasies of who he wants to be like.

93
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,200
It feels like a fantasy of someone he wants to watch.

94
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,700
I kind of think he's trying to have his cheesecake and eat it

95
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,600
by making a game about an empowered woman being heroic

96
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,100
but making sure you get a nice long look at all of her as she does it.

97
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,600
So between the two games, we're seeing two different sides of what's ultimately the same fantasy.

98
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,000
Bayonetta may be an empowered female character,

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,900
but she's empowered strictly within the confines of a straight male fantasy.

100
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,100
Games as a whole are sadly lacking explorations of other people's fantasies.

101
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,700
We're at the point where women actually liking your character is unexpected to the creators themselves.

102
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,200
The developers of the Prince of Persia reboot in 2008 were genuinely surprised to discover

103
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,100
that they'd somehow accrued quite a large female demographic.

104
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,400
In surprising contrast to G.O.W.,

105
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Pop is about a young man who acts vaguely like a human,

106
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,300
learns he can't do everything alone,

107
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,300
and grows to respect another person enough to risk his life with them on an adventure together

108
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,300
where they function as two halves of a team.

109
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,700
Perhaps accidentally, the Prince of Prince of Persia of Persia

110
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,500
functions well as a figure of someone else's fantasy.

111
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
So now we find out what the real problem is.

112
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,800
People would love to say how great it is that some homosexuals or wombs

113
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,500
might get turned on by revenge man beheads a lot,

114
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,800
but ultimately the target audience isn't those people

115
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,300
because the creators often genuinely don't understand what that part of the audience would want.

116
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,500
Stories that actually cater to those audiences are more likely to happen by accident,

117
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,500
and when a story maybe actively caters to that audience,

118
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,300
guess who starts complaining?

119
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,100
Square Enix even had to change a male character's outfit in Mobius Final Fantasy

120
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,000
because it was deemed too much.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,200
We're seeing a game space consciously being altered to suit the ideals of a specific group

122
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,500
at the exclusion of others.

123
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,900
They didn't cover up this guy because women or gay men preferred him covered up.

124
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,600
They covered it up because someone found it icky.

125
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,600
But where's the uproar? The complaints about self-censorship?

126
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,400
If you move a character two pixels over on the Western version of your box art,

127
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
there's an army of people crying foul,

128
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,100
hearts ready to bleed for the creator's vision of how their panties were supposed to look

129
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,600
on an advertisement.

130
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,000
People seem to only care about waging internet war to defend a creator's artistic freedom

131
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,700
when it's the freedom to service them in particular.

132
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,200
The freedom to service someone else is treated like a mistake or mostly ignored.

133
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,500
Save Tracer's butt!

134
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
But, eh, whatever.

135
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,100
It's just a costume change.

136
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,300
Why get hot and bothered about—

137
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,700
THEY DID WHAT?!

138
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,600
So ultimately what happens is one particular group's fantasies, expectations, and preoccupations

139
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,900
get normalized, and what that group happens to prefer becomes synonymous with good game design.

140
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,900
And this obsession with fulfilling a very specific power fantasy for one particular demographic

141
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,600
isn't just some theoretically bad thing for the feminazis to worry about, eugh.

142
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,500
It genuinely impacts the quality of the games.

143
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,300
Let's look back at God of War's story.

144
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,400
This is a game set in a time of myths which are literally defined as cool stories

145
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,200
that are fun and interesting and timeless,

146
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,600
and yet the game does everything it can to not have a story that isn't an incredibly generic revenge fantasy.

147
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,200
The player isn't made to really care about Kratos' loss or what his family was like or whatever.

148
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,000
They receive the information that his family's dead and he wants revenge

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,300
as a flimsy justification for what they were already doing in the game.

150
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,100
It's uncompelling, to say the least.

151
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,800
You can say the story doesn't need to be deep, and it doesn't need to be.

152
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,700
I mean, if you think about it, no story needs to be good.

153
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,300
Heart of Darkness didn't need to be a masterpiece, either.

154
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,100
But imagine for a second if God of War's story was surprisingly meditative on the nature of vengeance

155
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,600
and used the death of the ancient gods as a metaphor for the actual collapse of those belief systems

156
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,800
and Kratos was relatable on some actual emotional level.

157
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,200
You got all the murder, but you got some real character and story with it, too.

158
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,000
Wouldn't players be holding this up as the game they'd always wanted?

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,900
Or would it really totally ruin the experience?

160
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,200
When Gears of War 3 inserted some small elements of genuine pathos to the story,

161
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
just a smidge, just a whisper, a sniffle,

162
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,900
oh, he took off his hat because his friend died.

163
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,300
Now I know he's sad.

164
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,100
The players who weren't deriding this as gay emotional complexity crap

165
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,100
found it surprisingly touching and that it added something to their experience.

166
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,300
Gears of War 3 delivers some truly emotional moments

167
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,700
and boasts the best storytelling the series has seen so far.

168
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,300
The video I stole this footage from is literally titled

169
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,700
The Saddest Moment in Video Game History.

170
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:40,400
Gears of War 3 got players to actually feel something about their otherwise bland, one-note characters

171
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,500
and some people heralded that as a beautiful thing,

172
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,700
as well they should.

173
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,200
When Bioshock Infinite bothered to have a vaguely human person attached to this elaborately designed cleavage,

174
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,500
the director of the aforementioned Gears of War lauded it as proof that games had finally become art.

175
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Yeah, sure, maybe more of this isn't needed,

176
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,900
but maybe it would be better.

177
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,000
As games become more recognized as an art form and more differing voices start to be heard,

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,500
more visions are emerging,

179
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,200
and people are starting to appreciate them as different visions instead of as objective mistakes.

180
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,100
Even games that used to be action schlock and didn't need a good story are starting to get them.

181
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,600
That's a good thing.

182
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,700
Remember God of War?

183
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,500
Well, now it's back, and it's actually made Kratos into a compelling and interesting human being.

184
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,300
You're still running around hitting stuff with an axe,

185
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,400
but now you're teaching this kid to fight, too, in this scary new world.

186
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,200
You're watching Kratos be a dad.

187
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
He's a little out of shape and older and he has a kid,

188
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,300
but he's actually a more attractive character to some people now because he's remotely relatable as a human,

189
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,200
which it turns out is a real turn-on.

190
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,100
That's right.

191
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,500
We're finally getting an interesting God of War story.

192
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,700
It took 11 years, but we did it!

193
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,800
But now the bar's been raised, the sequel needs to go even further.

194
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,000
How about a QuickTime event where, if you press X with the right timing,

195
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,500
Kratos marries Brad Pitt,

196
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,100
and he convinces him to never grow a beard,

197
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,700
and they spend their old age together raising dogs in an old folks' home.

198
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,600
And in the next game, you play as the dog.

199
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,900
The dog ties little chainsaws to his arms to save his dog husband from Zoroastrianism or something,

200
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,400
and it's a gay dog who got married and they had a cute ceremony in the beginning before he gets kidnapped.

201
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,800
Look, Sony, just give me a call.

202
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,700
I have a 156-page treatment for Dog of War.

203
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,700
Thanks for watching.

204
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,400
This week, I'd like to personally thank...

205
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:50,300
...Williams, David Rose, Desmond R., Ed Costigan, Femininja, Graf and Blackpaw, and...

206
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,900
...eh...

207
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,900
...eh...

208
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,500
...HEROINE!

209
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,300
If you'd like to make a video response explaining how I'm a dumb cuck

210
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,200
and straight men need to be the demographic

211
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,400
and how I'm the real sexist and all women secretly love beards,

212
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,900
please make it quickly because I'm working on a video about video responses to my work,

213
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,800
and it would be a shame if your objective, rational, true facts didn't get included.

214
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
Wait. What's that noise?

215
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,100
No. Stop!

216
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,100
You can't kill me!

217
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,300
I created you!

218
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,200
I created...

219
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,000
RAAAAAAAGH!

220
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,400
