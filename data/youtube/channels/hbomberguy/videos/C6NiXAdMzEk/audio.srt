1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Happy New Year, friends and allies! I got this Christmas present from my aunt, it's a party cannon for indoor-slash-outdoor use.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Well, we're between some amount of doors. I think you're supposed to twist it.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So, let's celebrate New Year together, for the Queen.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is my... this is my duvet.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's fucked.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Fuck it, we're gonna celebrate New Year's the old-fashioned way.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I recently had a Twitter poll of which of three videos I should make this December, and in addition to it being decided that I shouldn't talk about Lisa again,

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
it was decided that I should make a glorious return to my staple of explaining how and why Bethesda are a garbage company that is bad.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So, this is gonna be kind of a long thing, because the problem with Bethesda is actually a problem that's inherent to a lot of the problems with companies nowadays,

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and their business practices, and in a way I'm talking about a much wider problem.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So this is gonna be a bit of a fucking slog, you know, I've gone with the Jimquisition technique of trying to, like, write well,

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and put kind of... not all that relevant footage underneath it, because it's hard to, you know, elucidate this long-form point easily without taking years,

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and this is a thing that happened recently, I want to address it in a timely fashion, and also I'm late for board games at a friend's house,

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
so we're gonna do it, it's gonna be like that.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So, strap yourselves in... oh, I should've got a strap, I should've got, like, a prop strap for this, and that...

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
One second...

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh, that's right, fuckers, strap yourselves in!

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I found a belt.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's time to get sanctimonious about the future of the games industry.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
My stance on Bethesda games is already well-known, but Mr. Softworks, if that IS his real name, well, actually, I guess it's Zenimax,

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
recently managed to sink to a level beyond simply remaking the previous Elder Scrolls game,

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
but worse, each time culminating in straight-up putting out the last game with better water textures and somehow more bugs?

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
All that stuff was obviously bad, you don't need anyone to point that out.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So when the multiplayer beta of Doom didn't do so well, and they decided not to send out review copies ahead of time,

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
citing that the multiplayer component of the latest in the famously multiplayer-component-having Doom franchise

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
was so important that they wanted critics to experience it in its actual release environment, I was hardly surprised.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It was very clear that it was just a flimsy justification for trying to ensure people buy the game

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
before critics have a chance to get a look at it and recommend otherwise.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Luckily, though, a miracle happened.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So it turns out there's this game developer called id Software that have been making good games for quite a while now,

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and actually put a lot of time and effort into making the game,

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and it was good, because Bethesda didn't actually make it, they just published it.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Doom was a masterpiece of shooter design, the likes of which has never been seen before or since, which is great!

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I like it when games are good, personally.

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So did Bethesda learn that maybe they should have some faith in the developers they're paying to work on those games,

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
or at least learn not to avoid critics?

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Of course not.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This is Bethesda, the publisher behind Horse Armor,

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and the fix the purposefully broken ending that you can't come back from for 10 quid DLC.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Bethesda instead announced that the financial and eventual critical success of Doom

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
has proven that they don't need to bother with critics at all,

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and will in fact be doing the same for all their games in future,

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
starting with Dishonored 2 and the Â£20 costing high quality water effects mod for Skyrim.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Which is weird, because Dishonored 2 and Skyrim don't even have multiplayer components at all to protect the sanctity of.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So, what's their new justification?

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Well, this time it's because they want both critics and audiences to experience the game at the same time.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And this generous new practice obviously worked great for Skyrim Special Edition,

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
which released Broken to millions of unhappy players who'd bought it

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
because there wasn't anyone to tell them it was broken and to wait.

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You can see the problem here.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Developers might care about making a good game,

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
but they're at the beck and call of producers, publishers, executives, and shareholders

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
who have a very specific top priority.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And that means making a game as quickly as possible, as cheaply as possible,

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and selling it to as many people as possible any way they can.

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So when these aforementioned goals start leading to worse games

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
that are basically broken and worse for the consumer,

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and critics threaten to reduce sales by telling people this,

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
well, it's simple, isn't it?

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Cut the critics out.

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Make it hard for anyone to possibly criticize your game before the bulk of sales can happen.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Send out review copies with no time to review them.

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Bethesda isn't the first company to start doing stuff like this, and they won't be the last.

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Others, unhappy with simply shielding themselves from the effects of the criticism they might get,

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
go one further and astroturf positive word of mouth.

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Maybe pay a couple of YouTubers to release positive videos

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
of all the unscripted, totally-not-carefully-cut-together fun they had with the game,

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and put a line of text in the description mentioning it's a commercial.

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh God, I set the whole cave on fire!

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I knew I should have got cave insurance.

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Hey guys, look at all this fun I was paid to have in a game that I'm selling.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Game critics were allowed to be in the loop when they were being psychopathically positive about Bethesda's games.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
They couldn't get enough of critics back then,

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
even releasing a Game of the Year edition,

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
an open declaration about an award literally given to the game by critics.

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Incidentally, Game of the Year edition stopped meaning anything, too,

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
once publishers realized there's no legal reason not to just put out an edition with Game of the Year written on it.

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But when critics finally started becoming, like, really, like, decent at their jobs,

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and realized that Fallout 4 had released literally broken on day one,

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and started telling people that,

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
well, all of a sudden, it's very important that everyone plays our games at once

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and doesn't have a chance of warning people that the games are bad and broken.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Of course, immediately after announcing that they wouldn't be doing early review copies,

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
they happily sent some early copies of Skyrim to popular and relatively uncritical YouTubers

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
who would be happy to put up playthroughs that amount to long-form uncritical commercials for the game.

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Hey, it's me, GV, and wow am I excited to bring you guys this.

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So Bethesda got in contact with me, yes, THE Bethesda,

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
and said that since I had been such a great supporter of all of their series,

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
they decided to send me Skyrim the Special Edition early, about a month early, honestly.

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Bethesda have kindly sent me Skyrim early so I can show you guys early Skyrim gameplay.

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Hm, a month before release, let me check. Is that, is that the same as a day before release?

92
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Hold on, let me do the math. No, no, no, it's not.

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This is the only kind of criticism, the only kind of conversation

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
that Bethesda wants being had about their games,

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and they're going out of their way to try and ensure that.

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
These people seem lovely, and they just seem like actually really big fans of Bethesda

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
and their games and the Elder Scrolls series, and that's, that's fine.

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You know, you're allowed to like bad games, that's okay.

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But isn't the purposeful choice by Bethesda to only send early copies out

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
to these people really telling about the kind of audience they want to cultivate?

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
About the level of uncritical love for a company you need to have

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
to be permitted to play their games in advance and talk about them?

103
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Now, it would be easy to just say this thing is bad and a shitty business practice,

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
because of course it is, but it's worse in the context of all the other ways

105
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
this same problem is manifesting in the games industry.

106
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
For example, there's the aforementioned fiasco where positive press was given to a game

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
with only a whisper of admission that the content was in fact

108
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
LITERALLY A FUCKING COMMERCIAL.

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
On top of that, there's the fact that Steam, being a platform that makes money through game sales,

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
has thrown open the doors to selling unfinished games in early access

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
with no guarantee of completion or of ever even being worked on,

112
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
along with often actually copyright-infringing nightmare factories

113
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
posing as actually completed games on their platform

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
and doing very little to combat the flood of games onto the store,

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
oversaturating the market, and leaving a lot of poor indie developers

116
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
to die in the choking smog of DLC, bad games, and asset flips.

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Steam have very little inclination to do anything about this,

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
because their purpose is to sell you games and make money from doing it.

119
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Why take anything off their shelves?

120
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Just don't buy it! Or make sure you play it for under two hours!

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So what we're seeing is actually a very consistent pattern.

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Business decisions that are bad for consumers and games

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and the overall health of the entire marketplace,

124
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
but which work out just fine for the bottom line of the people running the company

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
making the decisions in question.

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Which is the worst kind of problem,

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
because it means the people causing it have no reason to fix it,

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
or in the case of Bethesda's stance on critics, are causing it on purpose.

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And this affects the quality of games and gaming culture in a very direct way.

130
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Good criticism is the soul of media.

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What scares me about these business practices

132
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
is that they cut out not only the presence of criticism in the process at all,

133
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
but also, effectively, the need for the game to even be good.

134
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I want there to be another game like Doom,

135
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
another revolutionary thing that pushes the envelope,

136
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and what chance does that have of happening

137
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
if the big developers can get away with selling you any old crap

138
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
or a re-release of the crap from 2011 because there was a fancy pre-order bonus?

139
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Game publishing is far from the pure happy-go-lucky relationship

140
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I expected as a wee bairn,

141
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
where a developer works on something,

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
helped by a publisher that wants quality

143
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and makes sure it's good and sells it to an audience that finds themselves satisfied

144
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
and the company could possibly rise to the top

145
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
based on praise from a healthy, critical environment.

146
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's more like an active war between the company's ultimate goal of profit margins

147
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and everyone else, the people who want to not get a shitty, broken game,

148
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
the people who want to warn them about it,

149
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and the people who actually want to do a good job and make games for a living.

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You see stories about Crytek not even bothering to pay its employees

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
when the company isn't making enough money,

152
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
even though we can all be sure the people who made that decision

153
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and their shareholders won't see any kind of pay cut at all,

154
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
treating their employees like, well,

155
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
expendable playthings for whom decency is optional.

156
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The CEO of ZeniMax doubtless wishes his company's games were good

157
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and on some level cares about making a quality product.

158
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm sure he does. That would certainly help.

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But the bottom line clearly matters more than that, doesn't it?

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
A spreadsheet said there would be more money if the critical establishment was circumvented,

161
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
people were kept ignorant and were viral marketed to

162
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
by the less critically discerning people they're subscribed to on YouTube.

163
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And so that was the decision that was made.

164
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It becomes frighteningly clear that companies acting in their own best interest

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
is almost inherently bad for everyone involved.

166
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But you didn't click on a video about video games to get a lecture

167
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
about the inherent structural antagonisms

168
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
of free market liberal capitalist economics, did you?

169
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
All this talk of problems and complaining.

170
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Where's talk of the solutions, you whiny twerp?

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I hear you ask.

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Well, firstly, thanks for trusting me personally

173
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
with coming up with how to save the games industry.

174
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I appreciate the support.

175
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And secondly, one thing I'm definitely sure isn't the solution

176
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
is simply talking about how bad this stuff is

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
whenever it does happen, you know?

178
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Just talking about it doesn't really help.

179
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And neither does this attitude I've seen quite often on YouTube

180
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
where people will talk about the bad thing that's happened

181
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
and then be like, hey, companies, start treating us better

182
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
out of the goodness of your hearts.

183
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Publishers, stop pushing out incomplete games.

184
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Be brave and push back the release date if you have to.

185
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Give us games that are complete, that are in full working order

186
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and that aren't missing any features.

187
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
If I'm giving you 40 of my hard-earned pounds,

188
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
that's not too much to ask in return.

189
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yeah, just tell them to be brave.

190
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That'll fix it.

191
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Again, you already bought the game,

192
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and all you did was expect better from a company

193
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
that already has your money.

194
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
If I'm giving you 40 of my hard-earned pounds...

195
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Do you think developers are really gonna start delaying games

196
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
in order to release a finished product

197
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
when the business model works?

198
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So what's the alternative?

199
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Now, I could just say, buyer beware,

200
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
scream caveat emptor,

201
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and run off into my survival shelter

202
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
with backup Bitcoin wallets and posters of Ayn Rand,

203
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Rand Paul, Paul Ryan, Ryan Rand,

204
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Nand Paul, Ranin, and Skeletor,

205
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
but short of giving you directions to your local library

206
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
where you can find a copy of the Grundrisse,

207
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
the unfortunate thing is there isn't any other option

208
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
than to become better consumers.

209
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
We have to become more savvy than ever,

210
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
not just for the short-term benefit of not playing bad games,

211
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
but the long-term one of protecting the industry

212
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
from profiting from business practices

213
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
that will lead to good games being less likely

214
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
to actually happen, so with that in mind,

215
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I've thought of a list of some concrete,

216
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
useful advice for progress.

217
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
This isn't some, oh, here's a couple of vague suggestions,

218
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
maybe ask them nicely to stop being bad nonsense.

219
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
This is...

220
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Harris Bomberguy's Comprehensive Manifesto

221
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
for Saving Games and Thoroughly Decriming

222
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
the Industry as a Whole 2017.

223
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
One, do not buy games from publishers

224
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
who support bad business practices.

225
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Straight up, if a company no longer cares

226
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
about the critical process or about being good,

227
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
you should no longer care about paying them for it.

228
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
This means you might not get to play Fallout 4,

229
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
remastered with slightly prettier water edition

230
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
that I guarantee you is in the works right now,

231
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
or you might not get Watch Dogs 3's protagonist's

232
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
iconic Frozen-themed Poundland tat

233
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
when you pre-order.

234
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Oh, for fuck's sake!

235
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But by buying into it,

236
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
you're literally supporting them doing that.

237
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Don't let it continue to be profitable to do it.

238
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Please, you will thank me for this.

239
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Just don't.

240
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
If you do, you are helping make gaming worse

241
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
and should probably be arrested.

242
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
This issue is very slightly complicated

243
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
by the fact that, yeah, Doom turned out to be good,

244
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and as you can see from this footage,

245
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I clearly did buy Doom,

246
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
but I bought it in a sale, uh,

247
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and if Doom were to be released now after all of this,

248
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I probably wouldn't ever,

249
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
because this isn'tâthis shit's fucking important, guys.

250
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Two, support independent developers.

251
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's very, very easy to pretend video games

252
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
are a meritocracy where good video games

253
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
rise to the top and make a lot of money inherently,

254
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
but considering factors I already talked about,

255
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
like the oversaturation of Steam

256
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
with fucking garbage and DLC

257
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and free-to-play and garbage and garbage,

258
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
word of mouth is more important than ever

259
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
in promoting games that don't have

260
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
a massive marketing budget

261
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
or established franchise they know you'll already know about.

262
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
My top 11âwell, 12âvideo has been out

263
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
for only a couple of days,

264
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and I've already had comments from people

265
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
who really like the games I recommended

266
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
but had barely heard of them, if at all, before,

267
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and in my opinion, that's proof

268
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
that word of mouth isn't doing its job,

269
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
but that doesn't mean it can't.

270
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
This will help support creators

271
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
who definitely need it more than megacorporations

272
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and function as a reminder

273
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
that if your game is actually good,

274
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
there are very useful benefits to that.

275
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Maybe, paradoxically, be a bit frivolous

276
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
and overly encouraging towards indie stuff.

277
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Buy weird little games on a whim that seem good,

278
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
but maybe not quite your thing just to see.

279
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Indie games are often cheap and very often on sales.

280
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's worthwhile to expand your horizons

281
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
and good to ensure the perpetuation of little guys

282
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
who might just need a little more support

283
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
to keep going and make something truly great.

284
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Do you think a fresh startup could have made the new Doom?

285
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
No, it had to be id,

286
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
one of the most veteran companies in games,

287
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
supported monetarily by ZeniMax's Bethesda,

288
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
one of the richest companies in games.

289
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yes, that means you're partially supporting games

290
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
for reasons other than quality,

291
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
but games are not a meritocracy,

292
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and if we don't put our fingers on the scale,

293
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
we'll get fingered by the people with scales.

294
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yes, I did just imply the CEOs of game publishers

295
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
are lizard people.

296
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Please don't unpack that right now. I'm on a roll here.

297
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Three, support critics.

298
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
For games to be good, there has to be an active conversation

299
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
about what makes games good,

300
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and we have to propagate the idea

301
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
that it's okay for there to be curators who play games

302
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
so you don't have to.

303
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
There are a ton of critics out there,

304
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and some of them will line up enough with your tastes

305
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
that their recommendations will be useful,

306
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
and worth hearing about to inform your own perspective.

307
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
There are tons of great critics

308
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
of both games and the industry out there.

309
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I personally really like Noah Gervais,

310
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Shane May, Mr. B-Tongue, Joseph Anderson,

311
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
ActionButton.net, and Waypoint,

312
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
in case you've missed out on them,

313
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
but there's also Jim Sterling and Giant Bomb,

314
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
who everyone hopefully knows at this point.

315
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's worth noting that Giant Bomb literally started

316
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
because Jeff Gerstmann was fired from GameSpot

317
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
for writing a negative review of a game

318
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
by a company paying to advertise the game

319
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
all over the fucking website,

320
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
and they threatened to pull them.

321
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
A new critical revolution in gaming is,

322
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
has started,

323
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
and is going to continue.

324
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's just a question of how to get these ideas

325
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
applied in development itself.

326
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You might be wondering where the money to do

327
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
the last two things is going to come from,

328
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
supporting all these people.

329
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Well, that's solved by the first thing.

330
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
With all the money you now have

331
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
from not pre-ordering bullshit you didn't need

332
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
or buying games that perpetuate bullshit,

333
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
save that money in your mattress

334
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
for when you need a dentist,

335
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
but maybe invest some of it

336
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
in protecting your favorite industry.

337
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And of course, number four,

338
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
partake in criticism yourself.

339
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I've heard a lot of people snarkily say,

340
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
oh, everyone's a critic,

341
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
but everyone literally is a critic.

342
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
That's my entire point here.

343
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It's good to be a discerning customer,

344
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
and it's good for you and games

345
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
to find ways to articulate why you like them.

346
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The more intelligent the consumer base,

347
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
the better games have to be,

348
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
because shit like this won't fly anymore.

349
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's good for people to be informed

350
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
and smart about their choices,

351
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
and that means thinking about this stuff for yourself.

352
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I constantly get curious cats and AskFMs

353
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
and tweets and comments

354
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
asking about the specifics of design ideas

355
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I've presented and calling me out

356
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
on aspects I might be wrong about,

357
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
and this is good.

358
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's not a competition with the goal to be the smartest.

359
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's a conversation with the goal

360
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
to help come up with a useful perspective together.

361
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You see all these people

362
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
who just hit dislike and ran away?

363
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You see all these flippant comments

364
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
that provide nothing?

365
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You think these people are gonna be considerate

366
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
about the effects of continuing to pre-order garbage?

367
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
No.

368
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
If more of us are less like this

369
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
because we think about this stuff

370
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
and try and communicate about it

371
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
with each other effectively,

372
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
everything can and will get better.

373
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So to sum up, basically,

374
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
don't support developers who do bad business practices,

375
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
who do bad stuff.

376
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Just don't.

377
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Emailing them's not gonna work.

378
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Asking them nicely's not gonna work.

379
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Yelling sanctimoniously at them's not gonna work.

380
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Don't buy the games.

381
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Don't pre-order games ever, ever, for any reason.

382
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Find critics who either line up with your views

383
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
so you know you can trust them

384
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
or whose views are interesting enough

385
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
that you can gain some useful perspective

386
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
and support the shit out of them.

387
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Think a lot about games.

388
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Think too much about games.

389
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Start reading books with charts and graphs in them

390
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
and worrying if you might be thinking

391
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
a bit too much about games,

392
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
but then push past that and realize

393
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
that it doesn't matter

394
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
if you're becoming a bit pretentious

395
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
because pretentiousness is just

396
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
kenning to a higher thing that you might not reach,

397
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
but you might reach it.

398
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Have a nice time thinking about stuff.

399
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Maybe share your ideas with the rest of the world.

400
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Maybe become a major critic yourself

401
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
or at least engage critically with things

402
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
because that makes you a smarter person

403
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
and a better consumer.

404
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Don't worry about thinking too much

405
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
about something that you care about.

406
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Maybe try and get Tim to

407
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
let you write for actionbutton.net

408
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and get turned down.

409
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Whatever. That's fine.

410
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And maybe meet another games journalist

411
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
and fall in love.

412
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And if you get all these ducks in a row,

413
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
maybe you won't be alone when society collapses

414
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
because you'll have love

415
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
and Doom to play

416
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
when she realizes

417
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
that you like the Star Wars prequels.

418
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm gonna put on some coffee.

419
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Ah, that's good stuff.

420
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Thank you all very much for watching

421
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
and thank you very much to everyone

422
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
who's supporting me.

423
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That's where all the names are

424
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
that are going past the screen right now.

425
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But in addition to those names,

426
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'd especially like to thank...

427
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Cut to the recording I did earlier.

428
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
A mysterious benefactor.

429
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
