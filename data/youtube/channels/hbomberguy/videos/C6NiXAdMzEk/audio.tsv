0	8000	Happy New Year, friends and allies! I got this Christmas present from my aunt, it's a party cannon for indoor-slash-outdoor use.
8000	13000	Well, we're between some amount of doors. I think you're supposed to twist it.
13000	16000	So, let's celebrate New Year together, for the Queen.
24000	27000	This is my... this is my duvet.
30000	31000	It's fucked.
32000	35000	Fuck it, we're gonna celebrate New Year's the old-fashioned way.
35000	42000	I recently had a Twitter poll of which of three videos I should make this December, and in addition to it being decided that I shouldn't talk about Lisa again,
42000	50000	it was decided that I should make a glorious return to my staple of explaining how and why Bethesda are a garbage company that is bad.
51000	59000	So, this is gonna be kind of a long thing, because the problem with Bethesda is actually a problem that's inherent to a lot of the problems with companies nowadays,
59000	64000	and their business practices, and in a way I'm talking about a much wider problem.
64000	70000	So this is gonna be a bit of a fucking slog, you know, I've gone with the Jimquisition technique of trying to, like, write well,
70000	81000	and put kind of... not all that relevant footage underneath it, because it's hard to, you know, elucidate this long-form point easily without taking years,
81000	87000	and this is a thing that happened recently, I want to address it in a timely fashion, and also I'm late for board games at a friend's house,
87000	90000	so we're gonna do it, it's gonna be like that.
90000	96000	So, strap yourselves in... oh, I should've got a strap, I should've got, like, a prop strap for this, and that...
96000	97000	One second...
98000	100000	Oh, that's right, fuckers, strap yourselves in!
100000	101000	I found a belt.
102000	105000	It's time to get sanctimonious about the future of the games industry.
108000	115000	My stance on Bethesda games is already well-known, but Mr. Softworks, if that IS his real name, well, actually, I guess it's Zenimax,
115000	119000	recently managed to sink to a level beyond simply remaking the previous Elder Scrolls game,
119000	125000	but worse, each time culminating in straight-up putting out the last game with better water textures and somehow more bugs?
125000	129000	All that stuff was obviously bad, you don't need anyone to point that out.
129000	134000	So when the multiplayer beta of Doom didn't do so well, and they decided not to send out review copies ahead of time,
134000	140000	citing that the multiplayer component of the latest in the famously multiplayer-component-having Doom franchise
140000	146000	was so important that they wanted critics to experience it in its actual release environment, I was hardly surprised.
146000	151000	It was very clear that it was just a flimsy justification for trying to ensure people buy the game
151000	154000	before critics have a chance to get a look at it and recommend otherwise.
154000	156000	Luckily, though, a miracle happened.
156000	164000	So it turns out there's this game developer called id Software that have been making good games for quite a while now,
164000	168000	and actually put a lot of time and effort into making the game,
168000	172000	and it was good, because Bethesda didn't actually make it, they just published it.
172000	178000	Doom was a masterpiece of shooter design, the likes of which has never been seen before or since, which is great!
179000	181000	I like it when games are good, personally.
181000	187000	So did Bethesda learn that maybe they should have some faith in the developers they're paying to work on those games,
187000	189000	or at least learn not to avoid critics?
189000	191000	Of course not.
191000	194000	This is Bethesda, the publisher behind Horse Armor,
194000	199000	and the fix the purposefully broken ending that you can't come back from for 10 quid DLC.
199000	204000	Bethesda instead announced that the financial and eventual critical success of Doom
204000	207000	has proven that they don't need to bother with critics at all,
207000	210000	and will in fact be doing the same for all their games in future,
210000	216000	starting with Dishonored 2 and the Â£20 costing high quality water effects mod for Skyrim.
216000	222000	Which is weird, because Dishonored 2 and Skyrim don't even have multiplayer components at all to protect the sanctity of.
222000	224000	So, what's their new justification?
224000	230000	Well, this time it's because they want both critics and audiences to experience the game at the same time.
230000	234000	And this generous new practice obviously worked great for Skyrim Special Edition,
234000	238000	which released Broken to millions of unhappy players who'd bought it
238000	241000	because there wasn't anyone to tell them it was broken and to wait.
241000	243000	You can see the problem here.
243000	245000	Developers might care about making a good game,
245000	248000	but they're at the beck and call of producers, publishers, executives, and shareholders
248000	251000	who have a very specific top priority.
251000	254000	And that means making a game as quickly as possible, as cheaply as possible,
254000	258000	and selling it to as many people as possible any way they can.
258000	261000	So when these aforementioned goals start leading to worse games
261000	263000	that are basically broken and worse for the consumer,
263000	267000	and critics threaten to reduce sales by telling people this,
267000	269000	well, it's simple, isn't it?
269000	270000	Cut the critics out.
270000	275000	Make it hard for anyone to possibly criticize your game before the bulk of sales can happen.
275000	277000	Send out review copies with no time to review them.
277000	282000	Bethesda isn't the first company to start doing stuff like this, and they won't be the last.
282000	286000	Others, unhappy with simply shielding themselves from the effects of the criticism they might get,
286000	289000	go one further and astroturf positive word of mouth.
289000	292000	Maybe pay a couple of YouTubers to release positive videos
292000	296000	of all the unscripted, totally-not-carefully-cut-together fun they had with the game,
296000	299000	and put a line of text in the description mentioning it's a commercial.
299000	301000	Oh God, I set the whole cave on fire!
301000	303000	I knew I should have got cave insurance.
303000	306000	Hey guys, look at all this fun I was paid to have in a game that I'm selling.
306000	312000	Game critics were allowed to be in the loop when they were being psychopathically positive about Bethesda's games.
312000	314000	They couldn't get enough of critics back then,
314000	316000	even releasing a Game of the Year edition,
316000	321000	an open declaration about an award literally given to the game by critics.
321000	324000	Incidentally, Game of the Year edition stopped meaning anything, too,
324000	330000	once publishers realized there's no legal reason not to just put out an edition with Game of the Year written on it.
330000	334000	But when critics finally started becoming, like, really, like, decent at their jobs,
334000	338000	and realized that Fallout 4 had released literally broken on day one,
338000	340000	and started telling people that,
340000	344000	well, all of a sudden, it's very important that everyone plays our games at once
344000	349000	and doesn't have a chance of warning people that the games are bad and broken.
349000	352000	Of course, immediately after announcing that they wouldn't be doing early review copies,
352000	357000	they happily sent some early copies of Skyrim to popular and relatively uncritical YouTubers
357000	362000	who would be happy to put up playthroughs that amount to long-form uncritical commercials for the game.
362000	365000	Hey, it's me, GV, and wow am I excited to bring you guys this.
365000	368000	So Bethesda got in contact with me, yes, THE Bethesda,
368000	372000	and said that since I had been such a great supporter of all of their series,
372000	379000	they decided to send me Skyrim the Special Edition early, about a month early, honestly.
379000	385000	Bethesda have kindly sent me Skyrim early so I can show you guys early Skyrim gameplay.
385000	390000	Hm, a month before release, let me check. Is that, is that the same as a day before release?
390000	393000	Hold on, let me do the math. No, no, no, it's not.
393000	397000	This is the only kind of criticism, the only kind of conversation
397000	399000	that Bethesda wants being had about their games,
399000	401000	and they're going out of their way to try and ensure that.
401000	406000	These people seem lovely, and they just seem like actually really big fans of Bethesda
406000	409000	and their games and the Elder Scrolls series, and that's, that's fine.
409000	412000	You know, you're allowed to like bad games, that's okay.
412000	417000	But isn't the purposeful choice by Bethesda to only send early copies out
417000	421000	to these people really telling about the kind of audience they want to cultivate?
421000	426000	About the level of uncritical love for a company you need to have
426000	429000	to be permitted to play their games in advance and talk about them?
429000	433000	Now, it would be easy to just say this thing is bad and a shitty business practice,
433000	437000	because of course it is, but it's worse in the context of all the other ways
437000	440000	this same problem is manifesting in the games industry.
440000	444000	For example, there's the aforementioned fiasco where positive press was given to a game
444000	447000	with only a whisper of admission that the content was in fact
447000	449000	LITERALLY A FUCKING COMMERCIAL.
449000	453000	On top of that, there's the fact that Steam, being a platform that makes money through game sales,
453000	456000	has thrown open the doors to selling unfinished games in early access
456000	460000	with no guarantee of completion or of ever even being worked on,
460000	463000	along with often actually copyright-infringing nightmare factories
463000	466000	posing as actually completed games on their platform
466000	469000	and doing very little to combat the flood of games onto the store,
469000	472000	oversaturating the market, and leaving a lot of poor indie developers
472000	477000	to die in the choking smog of DLC, bad games, and asset flips.
477000	480000	Steam have very little inclination to do anything about this,
480000	483000	because their purpose is to sell you games and make money from doing it.
483000	485000	Why take anything off their shelves?
485000	489000	Just don't buy it! Or make sure you play it for under two hours!
489000	492000	So what we're seeing is actually a very consistent pattern.
492000	495000	Business decisions that are bad for consumers and games
495000	498000	and the overall health of the entire marketplace,
498000	502000	but which work out just fine for the bottom line of the people running the company
502000	504000	making the decisions in question.
504000	506000	Which is the worst kind of problem,
506000	509000	because it means the people causing it have no reason to fix it,
509000	512000	or in the case of Bethesda's stance on critics, are causing it on purpose.
513000	517000	And this affects the quality of games and gaming culture in a very direct way.
517000	520000	Good criticism is the soul of media.
520000	522000	What scares me about these business practices
522000	526000	is that they cut out not only the presence of criticism in the process at all,
526000	530000	but also, effectively, the need for the game to even be good.
530000	532000	I want there to be another game like Doom,
532000	535000	another revolutionary thing that pushes the envelope,
535000	537000	and what chance does that have of happening
537000	540000	if the big developers can get away with selling you any old crap
540000	544000	or a re-release of the crap from 2011 because there was a fancy pre-order bonus?
544000	547000	Game publishing is far from the pure happy-go-lucky relationship
547000	549000	I expected as a wee bairn,
549000	551000	where a developer works on something,
551000	553000	helped by a publisher that wants quality
553000	557000	and makes sure it's good and sells it to an audience that finds themselves satisfied
557000	559000	and the company could possibly rise to the top
559000	562000	based on praise from a healthy, critical environment.
562000	566000	It's more like an active war between the company's ultimate goal of profit margins
566000	569000	and everyone else, the people who want to not get a shitty, broken game,
569000	571000	the people who want to warn them about it,
571000	575000	and the people who actually want to do a good job and make games for a living.
575000	578000	You see stories about Crytek not even bothering to pay its employees
578000	580000	when the company isn't making enough money,
580000	583000	even though we can all be sure the people who made that decision
583000	586000	and their shareholders won't see any kind of pay cut at all,
586000	588000	treating their employees like, well,
588000	592000	expendable playthings for whom decency is optional.
592000	595000	The CEO of ZeniMax doubtless wishes his company's games were good
595000	598000	and on some level cares about making a quality product.
598000	600000	I'm sure he does. That would certainly help.
600000	603000	But the bottom line clearly matters more than that, doesn't it?
603000	607000	A spreadsheet said there would be more money if the critical establishment was circumvented,
607000	610000	people were kept ignorant and were viral marketed to
610000	613000	by the less critically discerning people they're subscribed to on YouTube.
613000	615000	And so that was the decision that was made.
615000	620000	It becomes frighteningly clear that companies acting in their own best interest
620000	622000	is almost inherently bad for everyone involved.
622000	625000	But you didn't click on a video about video games to get a lecture
625000	627000	about the inherent structural antagonisms
627000	630000	of free market liberal capitalist economics, did you?
630000	632000	All this talk of problems and complaining.
632000	635000	Where's talk of the solutions, you whiny twerp?
635000	636000	I hear you ask.
636000	638000	Well, firstly, thanks for trusting me personally
638000	640000	with coming up with how to save the games industry.
640000	642000	I appreciate the support.
642000	644000	And secondly, one thing I'm definitely sure isn't the solution
644000	647000	is simply talking about how bad this stuff is
647000	649000	whenever it does happen, you know?
649000	651000	Just talking about it doesn't really help.
651000	654000	And neither does this attitude I've seen quite often on YouTube
654000	656000	where people will talk about the bad thing that's happened
656000	660000	and then be like, hey, companies, start treating us better
660000	662000	out of the goodness of your hearts.
662000	666000	Publishers, stop pushing out incomplete games.
666000	670000	Be brave and push back the release date if you have to.
670000	673000	Give us games that are complete, that are in full working order
673000	675000	and that aren't missing any features.
675000	678000	If I'm giving you 40 of my hard-earned pounds,
678000	680000	that's not too much to ask in return.
680000	682000	Yeah, just tell them to be brave.
682000	683000	That'll fix it.
683000	685000	Again, you already bought the game,
685000	688000	and all you did was expect better from a company
688000	690000	that already has your money.
690000	696000	If I'm giving you 40 of my hard-earned pounds...
696000	699000	Do you think developers are really gonna start delaying games
699000	700000	in order to release a finished product
700000	702000	when the business model works?
702000	704000	So what's the alternative?
704000	706000	Now, I could just say, buyer beware,
706000	708000	scream caveat emptor,
708000	710000	and run off into my survival shelter
710000	713000	with backup Bitcoin wallets and posters of Ayn Rand,
713000	715000	Rand Paul, Paul Ryan, Ryan Rand,
715000	717000	Nand Paul, Ranin, and Skeletor,
717000	720000	but short of giving you directions to your local library
720000	722000	where you can find a copy of the Grundrisse,
722000	724000	the unfortunate thing is there isn't any other option
724000	726000	than to become better consumers.
726000	729000	We have to become more savvy than ever,
729000	732000	not just for the short-term benefit of not playing bad games,
732000	734000	but the long-term one of protecting the industry
734000	736000	from profiting from business practices
736000	738000	that will lead to good games being less likely
738000	740000	to actually happen, so with that in mind,
740000	742000	I've thought of a list of some concrete,
742000	744000	useful advice for progress.
744000	746000	This isn't some, oh, here's a couple of vague suggestions,
746000	749000	maybe ask them nicely to stop being bad nonsense.
749000	750000	This is...
750000	752000	Harris Bomberguy's Comprehensive Manifesto
752000	754000	for Saving Games and Thoroughly Decriming
754000	757000	the Industry as a Whole 2017.
757000	759000	One, do not buy games from publishers
759000	761000	who support bad business practices.
761000	763000	Straight up, if a company no longer cares
763000	766000	about the critical process or about being good,
766000	769000	you should no longer care about paying them for it.
769000	771000	This means you might not get to play Fallout 4,
771000	774000	remastered with slightly prettier water edition
774000	777000	that I guarantee you is in the works right now,
777000	779000	or you might not get Watch Dogs 3's protagonist's
779000	782000	iconic Frozen-themed Poundland tat
782000	784000	when you pre-order.
784000	786000	Oh, for fuck's sake!
786000	788000	But by buying into it,
788000	790000	you're literally supporting them doing that.
790000	793000	Don't let it continue to be profitable to do it.
793000	795000	Please, you will thank me for this.
795000	796000	Just don't.
796000	799000	If you do, you are helping make gaming worse
799000	802000	and should probably be arrested.
802000	804000	This issue is very slightly complicated
804000	806000	by the fact that, yeah, Doom turned out to be good,
806000	808000	and as you can see from this footage,
808000	810000	I clearly did buy Doom,
810000	812000	but I bought it in a sale, uh,
812000	815000	and if Doom were to be released now after all of this,
815000	816000	I probably wouldn't ever,
816000	819000	because this isn'tâthis shit's fucking important, guys.
819000	821000	Two, support independent developers.
821000	824000	It's very, very easy to pretend video games
824000	826000	are a meritocracy where good video games
826000	829000	rise to the top and make a lot of money inherently,
829000	831000	but considering factors I already talked about,
831000	833000	like the oversaturation of Steam
833000	835000	with fucking garbage and DLC
835000	838000	and free-to-play and garbage and garbage,
838000	840000	word of mouth is more important than ever
840000	842000	in promoting games that don't have
842000	844000	a massive marketing budget
844000	847000	or established franchise they know you'll already know about.
847000	849000	My top 11âwell, 12âvideo has been out
849000	851000	for only a couple of days,
851000	852000	and I've already had comments from people
852000	854000	who really like the games I recommended
854000	856000	but had barely heard of them, if at all, before,
856000	858000	and in my opinion, that's proof
858000	860000	that word of mouth isn't doing its job,
860000	862000	but that doesn't mean it can't.
862000	863000	This will help support creators
863000	865000	who definitely need it more than megacorporations
865000	867000	and function as a reminder
867000	869000	that if your game is actually good,
869000	871000	there are very useful benefits to that.
871000	873000	Maybe, paradoxically, be a bit frivolous
873000	875000	and overly encouraging towards indie stuff.
875000	878000	Buy weird little games on a whim that seem good,
878000	881000	but maybe not quite your thing just to see.
881000	884000	Indie games are often cheap and very often on sales.
884000	886000	It's worthwhile to expand your horizons
886000	888000	and good to ensure the perpetuation of little guys
888000	890000	who might just need a little more support
890000	892000	to keep going and make something truly great.
892000	895000	Do you think a fresh startup could have made the new Doom?
895000	897000	No, it had to be id,
897000	899000	one of the most veteran companies in games,
899000	902000	supported monetarily by ZeniMax's Bethesda,
902000	904000	one of the richest companies in games.
904000	906000	Yes, that means you're partially supporting games
906000	908000	for reasons other than quality,
908000	910000	but games are not a meritocracy,
910000	912000	and if we don't put our fingers on the scale,
912000	915000	we'll get fingered by the people with scales.
915000	917000	Yes, I did just imply the CEOs of game publishers
917000	919000	are lizard people.
919000	921000	Please don't unpack that right now. I'm on a roll here.
921000	923000	Three, support critics.
923000	925000	For games to be good, there has to be an active conversation
925000	927000	about what makes games good,
927000	929000	and we have to propagate the idea
929000	931000	that it's okay for there to be curators who play games
931000	933000	so you don't have to.
933000	934000	There are a ton of critics out there,
934000	936000	and some of them will line up enough with your tastes
936000	938000	that their recommendations will be useful,
939000	941000	and worth hearing about to inform your own perspective.
941000	943000	There are tons of great critics
943000	945000	of both games and the industry out there.
945000	947000	I personally really like Noah Gervais,
947000	949000	Shane May, Mr. B-Tongue, Joseph Anderson,
949000	951000	ActionButton.net, and Waypoint,
951000	953000	in case you've missed out on them,
953000	955000	but there's also Jim Sterling and Giant Bomb,
955000	957000	who everyone hopefully knows at this point.
957000	959000	It's worth noting that Giant Bomb literally started
959000	962000	because Jeff Gerstmann was fired from GameSpot
962000	964000	for writing a negative review of a game
964000	966000	by a company paying to advertise the game
966000	968000	all over the fucking website,
968000	969000	and they threatened to pull them.
969000	971000	A new critical revolution in gaming is,
971000	973000	has started,
973000	975000	and is going to continue.
975000	977000	It's just a question of how to get these ideas
977000	979000	applied in development itself.
979000	981000	You might be wondering where the money to do
981000	982000	the last two things is going to come from,
982000	984000	supporting all these people.
984000	986000	Well, that's solved by the first thing.
986000	987000	With all the money you now have
987000	989000	from not pre-ordering bullshit you didn't need
989000	991000	or buying games that perpetuate bullshit,
991000	993000	save that money in your mattress
993000	994000	for when you need a dentist,
994000	995000	but maybe invest some of it
995000	997000	in protecting your favorite industry.
997000	999000	And of course, number four,
999000	1001000	partake in criticism yourself.
1001000	1003000	I've heard a lot of people snarkily say,
1003000	1004000	oh, everyone's a critic,
1004000	1006000	but everyone literally is a critic.
1006000	1008000	That's my entire point here.
1008000	1010000	It's good to be a discerning customer,
1010000	1011000	and it's good for you and games
1011000	1014000	to find ways to articulate why you like them.
1014000	1016000	The more intelligent the consumer base,
1016000	1017000	the better games have to be,
1017000	1020000	because shit like this won't fly anymore.
1020000	1021000	It's good for people to be informed
1021000	1023000	and smart about their choices,
1023000	1025000	and that means thinking about this stuff for yourself.
1025000	1027000	I constantly get curious cats and AskFMs
1027000	1028000	and tweets and comments
1028000	1030000	asking about the specifics of design ideas
1030000	1032000	I've presented and calling me out
1032000	1033000	on aspects I might be wrong about,
1033000	1034000	and this is good.
1034000	1037000	It's not a competition with the goal to be the smartest.
1037000	1038000	It's a conversation with the goal
1038000	1041000	to help come up with a useful perspective together.
1041000	1042000	You see all these people
1042000	1044000	who just hit dislike and ran away?
1044000	1046000	You see all these flippant comments
1046000	1047000	that provide nothing?
1047000	1049000	You think these people are gonna be considerate
1049000	1051000	about the effects of continuing to pre-order garbage?
1051000	1052000	No.
1052000	1054000	If more of us are less like this
1054000	1055000	because we think about this stuff
1055000	1057000	and try and communicate about it
1057000	1058000	with each other effectively,
1058000	1061000	everything can and will get better.
1061000	1062000	So to sum up, basically,
1062000	1065000	don't support developers who do bad business practices,
1065000	1066000	who do bad stuff.
1066000	1067000	Just don't.
1067000	1068000	Emailing them's not gonna work.
1068000	1070000	Asking them nicely's not gonna work.
1070000	1073000	Yelling sanctimoniously at them's not gonna work.
1073000	1074000	Don't buy the games.
1074000	1079000	Don't pre-order games ever, ever, for any reason.
1079000	1081000	Find critics who either line up with your views
1081000	1082000	so you know you can trust them
1082000	1084000	or whose views are interesting enough
1084000	1086000	that you can gain some useful perspective
1086000	1088000	and support the shit out of them.
1088000	1089000	Think a lot about games.
1089000	1091000	Think too much about games.
1091000	1093000	Start reading books with charts and graphs in them
1093000	1095000	and worrying if you might be thinking
1095000	1096000	a bit too much about games,
1096000	1098000	but then push past that and realize
1098000	1099000	that it doesn't matter
1099000	1101000	if you're becoming a bit pretentious
1101000	1102000	because pretentiousness is just
1102000	1104000	kenning to a higher thing that you might not reach,
1104000	1106000	but you might reach it.
1106000	1108000	Have a nice time thinking about stuff.
1108000	1110000	Maybe share your ideas with the rest of the world.
1110000	1112000	Maybe become a major critic yourself
1112000	1115000	or at least engage critically with things
1115000	1117000	because that makes you a smarter person
1117000	1118000	and a better consumer.
1118000	1120000	Don't worry about thinking too much
1120000	1122000	about something that you care about.
1122000	1124000	Maybe try and get Tim to
1124000	1126000	let you write for actionbutton.net
1126000	1127000	and get turned down.
1127000	1129000	Whatever. That's fine.
1129000	1131000	And maybe meet another games journalist
1131000	1133000	and fall in love.
1133000	1135000	And if you get all these ducks in a row,
1135000	1137000	maybe you won't be alone when society collapses
1137000	1139000	because you'll have love
1139000	1141000	and Doom to play
1141000	1143000	when she realizes
1143000	1145000	that you like the Star Wars prequels.
1149000	1151000	I'm gonna put on some coffee.
1167000	1196000	Ah, that's good stuff.
1196000	1198000	Thank you all very much for watching
1198000	1200000	and thank you very much to everyone
1200000	1201000	who's supporting me.
1201000	1202000	That's where all the names are
1202000	1204000	that are going past the screen right now.
1204000	1205000	But in addition to those names,
1205000	1207000	I'd especially like to thank...
1207000	1209000	Cut to the recording I did earlier.
