00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Happy New Year, friends and allies! I got this Christmas present from my aunt, it's a party cannon for indoor-slash-outdoor use.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
Well, we're between some amount of doors. I think you're supposed to twist it.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
So, let's celebrate New Year together, for the Queen.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
This is my... this is my duvet.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
It's fucked.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
Fuck it, we're gonna celebrate New Year's the old-fashioned way.

00:35.000 --> 00:42.000
I recently had a Twitter poll of which of three videos I should make this December, and in addition to it being decided that I shouldn't talk about Lisa again,

00:42.000 --> 00:50.000
it was decided that I should make a glorious return to my staple of explaining how and why Bethesda are a garbage company that is bad.

00:51.000 --> 00:59.000
So, this is gonna be kind of a long thing, because the problem with Bethesda is actually a problem that's inherent to a lot of the problems with companies nowadays,

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
and their business practices, and in a way I'm talking about a much wider problem.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
So this is gonna be a bit of a fucking slog, you know, I've gone with the Jimquisition technique of trying to, like, write well,

01:10.000 --> 01:21.000
and put kind of... not all that relevant footage underneath it, because it's hard to, you know, elucidate this long-form point easily without taking years,

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
and this is a thing that happened recently, I want to address it in a timely fashion, and also I'm late for board games at a friend's house,

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
so we're gonna do it, it's gonna be like that.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
So, strap yourselves in... oh, I should've got a strap, I should've got, like, a prop strap for this, and that...

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
One second...

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Oh, that's right, fuckers, strap yourselves in!

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
I found a belt.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
It's time to get sanctimonious about the future of the games industry.

01:48.000 --> 01:55.000
My stance on Bethesda games is already well-known, but Mr. Softworks, if that IS his real name, well, actually, I guess it's Zenimax,

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
recently managed to sink to a level beyond simply remaking the previous Elder Scrolls game,

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
but worse, each time culminating in straight-up putting out the last game with better water textures and somehow more bugs?

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
All that stuff was obviously bad, you don't need anyone to point that out.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
So when the multiplayer beta of Doom didn't do so well, and they decided not to send out review copies ahead of time,

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
citing that the multiplayer component of the latest in the famously multiplayer-component-having Doom franchise

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
was so important that they wanted critics to experience it in its actual release environment, I was hardly surprised.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
It was very clear that it was just a flimsy justification for trying to ensure people buy the game

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
before critics have a chance to get a look at it and recommend otherwise.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Luckily, though, a miracle happened.

02:36.000 --> 02:44.000
So it turns out there's this game developer called id Software that have been making good games for quite a while now,

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
and actually put a lot of time and effort into making the game,

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
and it was good, because Bethesda didn't actually make it, they just published it.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
Doom was a masterpiece of shooter design, the likes of which has never been seen before or since, which is great!

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
I like it when games are good, personally.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
So did Bethesda learn that maybe they should have some faith in the developers they're paying to work on those games,

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
or at least learn not to avoid critics?

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Of course not.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
This is Bethesda, the publisher behind Horse Armor,

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
and the fix the purposefully broken ending that you can't come back from for 10 quid DLC.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
Bethesda instead announced that the financial and eventual critical success of Doom

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
has proven that they don't need to bother with critics at all,

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
and will in fact be doing the same for all their games in future,

03:30.000 --> 03:36.000
starting with Dishonored 2 and the Â£20 costing high quality water effects mod for Skyrim.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
Which is weird, because Dishonored 2 and Skyrim don't even have multiplayer components at all to protect the sanctity of.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
So, what's their new justification?

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
Well, this time it's because they want both critics and audiences to experience the game at the same time.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
And this generous new practice obviously worked great for Skyrim Special Edition,

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
which released Broken to millions of unhappy players who'd bought it

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
because there wasn't anyone to tell them it was broken and to wait.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
You can see the problem here.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Developers might care about making a good game,

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
but they're at the beck and call of producers, publishers, executives, and shareholders

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
who have a very specific top priority.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
And that means making a game as quickly as possible, as cheaply as possible,

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
and selling it to as many people as possible any way they can.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
So when these aforementioned goals start leading to worse games

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
that are basically broken and worse for the consumer,

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
and critics threaten to reduce sales by telling people this,

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
well, it's simple, isn't it?

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Cut the critics out.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
Make it hard for anyone to possibly criticize your game before the bulk of sales can happen.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Send out review copies with no time to review them.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
Bethesda isn't the first company to start doing stuff like this, and they won't be the last.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
Others, unhappy with simply shielding themselves from the effects of the criticism they might get,

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
go one further and astroturf positive word of mouth.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Maybe pay a couple of YouTubers to release positive videos

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
of all the unscripted, totally-not-carefully-cut-together fun they had with the game,

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
and put a line of text in the description mentioning it's a commercial.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Oh God, I set the whole cave on fire!

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
I knew I should have got cave insurance.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Hey guys, look at all this fun I was paid to have in a game that I'm selling.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
Game critics were allowed to be in the loop when they were being psychopathically positive about Bethesda's games.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
They couldn't get enough of critics back then,

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
even releasing a Game of the Year edition,

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
an open declaration about an award literally given to the game by critics.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Incidentally, Game of the Year edition stopped meaning anything, too,

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
once publishers realized there's no legal reason not to just put out an edition with Game of the Year written on it.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
But when critics finally started becoming, like, really, like, decent at their jobs,

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
and realized that Fallout 4 had released literally broken on day one,

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
and started telling people that,

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
well, all of a sudden, it's very important that everyone plays our games at once

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
and doesn't have a chance of warning people that the games are bad and broken.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Of course, immediately after announcing that they wouldn't be doing early review copies,

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
they happily sent some early copies of Skyrim to popular and relatively uncritical YouTubers

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
who would be happy to put up playthroughs that amount to long-form uncritical commercials for the game.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
Hey, it's me, GV, and wow am I excited to bring you guys this.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
So Bethesda got in contact with me, yes, THE Bethesda,

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
and said that since I had been such a great supporter of all of their series,

06:12.000 --> 06:19.000
they decided to send me Skyrim the Special Edition early, about a month early, honestly.

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
Bethesda have kindly sent me Skyrim early so I can show you guys early Skyrim gameplay.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
Hm, a month before release, let me check. Is that, is that the same as a day before release?

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Hold on, let me do the math. No, no, no, it's not.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
This is the only kind of criticism, the only kind of conversation

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
that Bethesda wants being had about their games,

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
and they're going out of their way to try and ensure that.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
These people seem lovely, and they just seem like actually really big fans of Bethesda

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
and their games and the Elder Scrolls series, and that's, that's fine.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
You know, you're allowed to like bad games, that's okay.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
But isn't the purposeful choice by Bethesda to only send early copies out

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
to these people really telling about the kind of audience they want to cultivate?

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
About the level of uncritical love for a company you need to have

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
to be permitted to play their games in advance and talk about them?

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
Now, it would be easy to just say this thing is bad and a shitty business practice,

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
because of course it is, but it's worse in the context of all the other ways

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
this same problem is manifesting in the games industry.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
For example, there's the aforementioned fiasco where positive press was given to a game

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
with only a whisper of admission that the content was in fact

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
LITERALLY A FUCKING COMMERCIAL.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
On top of that, there's the fact that Steam, being a platform that makes money through game sales,

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
has thrown open the doors to selling unfinished games in early access

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
with no guarantee of completion or of ever even being worked on,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
along with often actually copyright-infringing nightmare factories

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
posing as actually completed games on their platform

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
and doing very little to combat the flood of games onto the store,

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
oversaturating the market, and leaving a lot of poor indie developers

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
to die in the choking smog of DLC, bad games, and asset flips.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
Steam have very little inclination to do anything about this,

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
because their purpose is to sell you games and make money from doing it.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Why take anything off their shelves?

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
Just don't buy it! Or make sure you play it for under two hours!

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
So what we're seeing is actually a very consistent pattern.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Business decisions that are bad for consumers and games

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
and the overall health of the entire marketplace,

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
but which work out just fine for the bottom line of the people running the company

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
making the decisions in question.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Which is the worst kind of problem,

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
because it means the people causing it have no reason to fix it,

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
or in the case of Bethesda's stance on critics, are causing it on purpose.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
And this affects the quality of games and gaming culture in a very direct way.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
Good criticism is the soul of media.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
What scares me about these business practices

08:42.000 --> 08:46.000
is that they cut out not only the presence of criticism in the process at all,

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
but also, effectively, the need for the game to even be good.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
I want there to be another game like Doom,

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
another revolutionary thing that pushes the envelope,

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
and what chance does that have of happening

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
if the big developers can get away with selling you any old crap

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
or a re-release of the crap from 2011 because there was a fancy pre-order bonus?

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
Game publishing is far from the pure happy-go-lucky relationship

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I expected as a wee bairn,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
where a developer works on something,

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
helped by a publisher that wants quality

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
and makes sure it's good and sells it to an audience that finds themselves satisfied

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
and the company could possibly rise to the top

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
based on praise from a healthy, critical environment.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
It's more like an active war between the company's ultimate goal of profit margins

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
and everyone else, the people who want to not get a shitty, broken game,

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
the people who want to warn them about it,

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
and the people who actually want to do a good job and make games for a living.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
You see stories about Crytek not even bothering to pay its employees

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
when the company isn't making enough money,

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
even though we can all be sure the people who made that decision

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
and their shareholders won't see any kind of pay cut at all,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
treating their employees like, well,

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
expendable playthings for whom decency is optional.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
The CEO of ZeniMax doubtless wishes his company's games were good

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
and on some level cares about making a quality product.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
I'm sure he does. That would certainly help.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
But the bottom line clearly matters more than that, doesn't it?

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
A spreadsheet said there would be more money if the critical establishment was circumvented,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
people were kept ignorant and were viral marketed to

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
by the less critically discerning people they're subscribed to on YouTube.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
And so that was the decision that was made.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
It becomes frighteningly clear that companies acting in their own best interest

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
is almost inherently bad for everyone involved.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
But you didn't click on a video about video games to get a lecture

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
about the inherent structural antagonisms

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
of free market liberal capitalist economics, did you?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
All this talk of problems and complaining.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Where's talk of the solutions, you whiny twerp?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
I hear you ask.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Well, firstly, thanks for trusting me personally

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
with coming up with how to save the games industry.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I appreciate the support.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
And secondly, one thing I'm definitely sure isn't the solution

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
is simply talking about how bad this stuff is

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
whenever it does happen, you know?

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Just talking about it doesn't really help.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
And neither does this attitude I've seen quite often on YouTube

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
where people will talk about the bad thing that's happened

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
and then be like, hey, companies, start treating us better

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
out of the goodness of your hearts.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
Publishers, stop pushing out incomplete games.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Be brave and push back the release date if you have to.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
Give us games that are complete, that are in full working order

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
and that aren't missing any features.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
If I'm giving you 40 of my hard-earned pounds,

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
that's not too much to ask in return.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Yeah, just tell them to be brave.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
That'll fix it.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Again, you already bought the game,

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
and all you did was expect better from a company

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
that already has your money.

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
If I'm giving you 40 of my hard-earned pounds...

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Do you think developers are really gonna start delaying games

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
in order to release a finished product

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
when the business model works?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
So what's the alternative?

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Now, I could just say, buyer beware,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
scream caveat emptor,

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
and run off into my survival shelter

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
with backup Bitcoin wallets and posters of Ayn Rand,

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Rand Paul, Paul Ryan, Ryan Rand,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Nand Paul, Ranin, and Skeletor,

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
but short of giving you directions to your local library

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
where you can find a copy of the Grundrisse,

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
the unfortunate thing is there isn't any other option

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
than to become better consumers.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
We have to become more savvy than ever,

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
not just for the short-term benefit of not playing bad games,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
but the long-term one of protecting the industry

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
from profiting from business practices

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
that will lead to good games being less likely

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
to actually happen, so with that in mind,

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
I've thought of a list of some concrete,

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
useful advice for progress.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
This isn't some, oh, here's a couple of vague suggestions,

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
maybe ask them nicely to stop being bad nonsense.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
This is...

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Harris Bomberguy's Comprehensive Manifesto

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
for Saving Games and Thoroughly Decriming

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
the Industry as a Whole 2017.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
One, do not buy games from publishers

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
who support bad business practices.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Straight up, if a company no longer cares

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
about the critical process or about being good,

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
you should no longer care about paying them for it.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
This means you might not get to play Fallout 4,

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
remastered with slightly prettier water edition

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
that I guarantee you is in the works right now,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
or you might not get Watch Dogs 3's protagonist's

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
iconic Frozen-themed Poundland tat

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
when you pre-order.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Oh, for fuck's sake!

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
But by buying into it,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
you're literally supporting them doing that.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
Don't let it continue to be profitable to do it.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Please, you will thank me for this.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Just don't.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
If you do, you are helping make gaming worse

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
and should probably be arrested.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
This issue is very slightly complicated

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
by the fact that, yeah, Doom turned out to be good,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
and as you can see from this footage,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
I clearly did buy Doom,

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
but I bought it in a sale, uh,

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
and if Doom were to be released now after all of this,

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
I probably wouldn't ever,

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
because this isn'tâthis shit's fucking important, guys.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Two, support independent developers.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
It's very, very easy to pretend video games

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
are a meritocracy where good video games

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
rise to the top and make a lot of money inherently,

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
but considering factors I already talked about,

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
like the oversaturation of Steam

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
with fucking garbage and DLC

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
and free-to-play and garbage and garbage,

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
word of mouth is more important than ever

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
in promoting games that don't have

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
a massive marketing budget

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
or established franchise they know you'll already know about.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
My top 11âwell, 12âvideo has been out

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
for only a couple of days,

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
and I've already had comments from people

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
who really like the games I recommended

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
but had barely heard of them, if at all, before,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
and in my opinion, that's proof

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
that word of mouth isn't doing its job,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
but that doesn't mean it can't.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
This will help support creators

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
who definitely need it more than megacorporations

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
and function as a reminder

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
that if your game is actually good,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
there are very useful benefits to that.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Maybe, paradoxically, be a bit frivolous

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
and overly encouraging towards indie stuff.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
Buy weird little games on a whim that seem good,

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
but maybe not quite your thing just to see.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
Indie games are often cheap and very often on sales.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
It's worthwhile to expand your horizons

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
and good to ensure the perpetuation of little guys

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
who might just need a little more support

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
to keep going and make something truly great.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
Do you think a fresh startup could have made the new Doom?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
No, it had to be id,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
one of the most veteran companies in games,

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
supported monetarily by ZeniMax's Bethesda,

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
one of the richest companies in games.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Yes, that means you're partially supporting games

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
for reasons other than quality,

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
but games are not a meritocracy,

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
and if we don't put our fingers on the scale,

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
we'll get fingered by the people with scales.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Yes, I did just imply the CEOs of game publishers

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
are lizard people.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Please don't unpack that right now. I'm on a roll here.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Three, support critics.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
For games to be good, there has to be an active conversation

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
about what makes games good,

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
and we have to propagate the idea

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
that it's okay for there to be curators who play games

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
so you don't have to.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
There are a ton of critics out there,

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
and some of them will line up enough with your tastes

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
that their recommendations will be useful,

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
and worth hearing about to inform your own perspective.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
There are tons of great critics

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
of both games and the industry out there.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
I personally really like Noah Gervais,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Shane May, Mr. B-Tongue, Joseph Anderson,

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
ActionButton.net, and Waypoint,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
in case you've missed out on them,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
but there's also Jim Sterling and Giant Bomb,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
who everyone hopefully knows at this point.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
It's worth noting that Giant Bomb literally started

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
because Jeff Gerstmann was fired from GameSpot

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
for writing a negative review of a game

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
by a company paying to advertise the game

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
all over the fucking website,

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
and they threatened to pull them.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
A new critical revolution in gaming is,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
has started,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
and is going to continue.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
It's just a question of how to get these ideas

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
applied in development itself.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
You might be wondering where the money to do

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
the last two things is going to come from,

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
supporting all these people.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Well, that's solved by the first thing.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
With all the money you now have

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
from not pre-ordering bullshit you didn't need

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
or buying games that perpetuate bullshit,

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
save that money in your mattress

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
for when you need a dentist,

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
but maybe invest some of it

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
in protecting your favorite industry.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
And of course, number four,

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
partake in criticism yourself.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
I've heard a lot of people snarkily say,

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
oh, everyone's a critic,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
but everyone literally is a critic.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
That's my entire point here.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
It's good to be a discerning customer,

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
and it's good for you and games

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
to find ways to articulate why you like them.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
The more intelligent the consumer base,

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
the better games have to be,

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
because shit like this won't fly anymore.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
It's good for people to be informed

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
and smart about their choices,

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
and that means thinking about this stuff for yourself.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I constantly get curious cats and AskFMs

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
and tweets and comments

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
asking about the specifics of design ideas

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
I've presented and calling me out

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
on aspects I might be wrong about,

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
and this is good.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
It's not a competition with the goal to be the smartest.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
It's a conversation with the goal

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
to help come up with a useful perspective together.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
You see all these people

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
who just hit dislike and ran away?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
You see all these flippant comments

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
that provide nothing?

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
You think these people are gonna be considerate

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
about the effects of continuing to pre-order garbage?

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
No.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
If more of us are less like this

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
because we think about this stuff

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
and try and communicate about it

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
with each other effectively,

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
everything can and will get better.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
So to sum up, basically,

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
don't support developers who do bad business practices,

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
who do bad stuff.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Just don't.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Emailing them's not gonna work.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Asking them nicely's not gonna work.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
Yelling sanctimoniously at them's not gonna work.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Don't buy the games.

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
Don't pre-order games ever, ever, for any reason.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Find critics who either line up with your views

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
so you know you can trust them

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
or whose views are interesting enough

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
that you can gain some useful perspective

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
and support the shit out of them.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Think a lot about games.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Think too much about games.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Start reading books with charts and graphs in them

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
and worrying if you might be thinking

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
a bit too much about games,

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
but then push past that and realize

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
that it doesn't matter

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
if you're becoming a bit pretentious

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
because pretentiousness is just

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
kenning to a higher thing that you might not reach,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
but you might reach it.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Have a nice time thinking about stuff.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Maybe share your ideas with the rest of the world.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Maybe become a major critic yourself

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
or at least engage critically with things

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
because that makes you a smarter person

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
and a better consumer.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Don't worry about thinking too much

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
about something that you care about.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Maybe try and get Tim to

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
let you write for actionbutton.net

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
and get turned down.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Whatever. That's fine.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
And maybe meet another games journalist

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
and fall in love.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
And if you get all these ducks in a row,

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
maybe you won't be alone when society collapses

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
because you'll have love

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
and Doom to play

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
when she realizes

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
that you like the Star Wars prequels.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
I'm gonna put on some coffee.

19:27.000 --> 19:56.000
Ah, that's good stuff.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Thank you all very much for watching

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
and thank you very much to everyone

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
who's supporting me.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
That's where all the names are

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
that are going past the screen right now.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
But in addition to those names,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I'd especially like to thank...

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Cut to the recording I did earlier.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
A mysterious benefactor.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
David, comma, the benevolent malevolence.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Desmond R.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Emily O.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Eugene Butler.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Evan Ritchie.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Felix Meyer.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Femininja.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Findlay Bowick-Copley.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Fruit.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Gabrielle de Belfouil-Jurajuria.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
Gary Marshall.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
George Older.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Grafen Blackpaw.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Haruspicus S.A.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Hero Rewar.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Jack Harvey.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Jan Anders.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Jason Rounds.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Jason Walter.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Jay Logan.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
