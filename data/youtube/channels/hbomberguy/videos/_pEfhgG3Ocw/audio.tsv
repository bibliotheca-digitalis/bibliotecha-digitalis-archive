0	2240	Are you having trouble attracting a mate?
2240	5460	Is no one responding to your dick pics despite listing
5460	9680	The Shawshank Redemption and The Big Lebowski as your favorite movies on your profile?
9680	14840	Do you, for some reason, invest way more value in sex than in genuine happiness or fulfilling relationships?
15280	19220	Hmm, yes, well, just one more question and then I can get you the help you need.
20120	21640	Do you have any disposable income?
21640	24140	["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"]
25100	28580	Pickup artistry, or PUA, or as they call it, GAME,
28580	33400	refers to the apparently lost, secret technique of convincing people that sleeping with you is a good idea.
33400	35340	["How do you ask for a date?"
35960	37940	Wikipedia politely calls them the
37940	40340	"...seduction community."
40340	41100	Ugh.
41100	43780	While the concept has been around since the 70s, the
43780	46500	"...community really got going in the Internet age.
46500	48940	On places like Usenet and later Reddit,
48940	51940	people who sit inside all day arguing with other men on the Internet
51940	54940	can take the time to trade tips on how they think women work.
54940	58100	And some people rose to the top to make careers from their writing
58100	61180	through ad-supported websites or self-published books on Amazon.
61180	63500	One such fellow, arguably the most popular, is
63500	64780	Dariush Felizadeh,
64780	70060	who calls himself Roush V because he knows most of his readership has trouble spelling and pronouncing difficult words.
70060	74460	He's written a whole bunch of books on pickup artistry and how to do it in various specific countries,
74460	78540	which you can buy on Amazon or his shady-ass Web 2.0-looking website.
78540	80460	You know, if there's one thing I just love doing,
80460	84460	it's paying other men to tell me what they think women think about stuff.
85940	88940	That's way more mature than asking them.
90940	92940	Let's read some of his breakout book!
92940	93940	Bang!
93940	94940	Shall we?
96940	99460	Why am I putting it in my mouth? That's stupid.
99460	102460	Never tell a girl that she's beautiful or hot,
102460	106460	because what that does is increase her value relative to yours.
106460	108460	Not complimenting will help you,
108460	111460	because you're withholding a reward that all women want,
111460	113460	one that they will stick around waiting for.
113980	117980	Do not discuss your feelings of emotion or attraction for her.
117980	122980	Never tell a girl you like her or feel something for her.
122980	126460	Only in movies will discussing your feelings ever get
126460	127980	THE DESIRABLE FEMALE.
127980	130460	We use indirect game without compliments,
130460	132980	where she's never completely sure about her feelings for her.
132980	134460	You're not hiding anything.
134460	137980	You're just being mysterious.
137980	140460	I am Roush V, lord of mysteries.
140460	145460	It is an act whereby a man inserts a rod-shaped mass of tissue
145460	150460	into a woman's lubricated cavity, also made of tissue.
150460	154460	Don't be too concerned with sexual technique.
154460	156460	Porn is my teacher.
156460	158460	A man rubs his rod in and out,
158460	163460	stimulating pleasure receptors until his brain decides on the right time
163460	165460	to eject a genetic package.
165460	168460	Since sex is supposed to be fun,
168460	172460	don't take it too seriously by questioning whether you're doing things right.
172460	176460	Worrying about her pleasure sacrifices your own.
176460	181460	Pump slowly, getting slightly farther in with each pump until...
181460	187460	HE LAUGHS
187460	190460	Congratulate yourself on the notch.
190460	193460	HE CHUCKLES
193460	194460	That's gross.
194460	197460	Oh, it's getting hot and sexy in here, isn't it?
197460	200460	Coming down with a case of the fucking vapors!
200460	204460	Now, I could go into detail about every single strategy in this book
204460	208460	and how it reveals a deeply unsettling inability to empathize with women as human beings
208460	210460	and how most of it doesn't actually work.
210460	212460	In fact, that's why this video took so long to make.
212460	214460	Initially, it was gonna be about every single thing in the book,
214460	217460	but what I actually find is really funny
217460	220460	is that Roush agrees with me about how poorly it works.
220460	224460	The most telling piece of advice in the book is actually its simplest.
224460	226460	Be prepared for a lot of disappointment.
227460	229460	Most phone numbers will go nowhere.
229460	234460	You're doing incredible if half the numbers you get result in a first date.
234460	236460	Even when your game gets really good,
236460	240460	you will still get rejected and have prospects that don't convert.
240460	245460	On your 100th approach, there will be the experience of 99 previous approaches at your back
245460	247460	helping you succeed.
247460	250460	This is why it is better to be the man that tries and fails
250460	252460	than one who does not try at all.
252460	255460	Now, on a certain level, yeah, dating is easier for you
255460	258460	because of how you approach it if you accept that not everyone will accept you
258460	261460	and no set of tactics will work on 100% of women.
261460	264460	But combined with the rest of this fucking shitty nonsense advice,
264460	266460	it's an admission of failure.
266460	269460	If I wrote a guide on how to succeed at Dota
269460	271460	and the first chapter started with,
271460	274460	get used to disappointment, following these tips you'll only actually win
274460	276460	one in a hundred times,
276460	278460	you'd want your fucking money back, wouldn't you?
278460	282460	This puts something of a dent in the idea that pickup artistry actually works, doesn't it?
282460	286460	It only looks like it works because it tells you to try it hundreds of times,
286460	290460	so people who are utterly committed to it will probably eventually see some results.
290460	292460	Does that actually mean it works, though?
292460	297460	I know I'm arguing semantics here, but if you roll six dice hundreds of times,
297460	299460	you'll eventually land all sixes,
299460	302460	but that doesn't mean I've taught you how to be a dice roll artist, does it?
302460	304460	It just goes on like that.
304460	307460	Honestly, I've read as many of the books that I could get a hold of
307460	309460	for less than asking price,
309460	312460	and they're basically the same book over and over again.
312460	314460	But I gotta give Roosh some credit, though.
314460	319460	First of all, he sold the same book in, like, 15 different forms to the same people,
319460	322460	but he's also very good at constructing sentences
322460	324460	that sound deep and introspective and original,
324460	328460	but if you think about them for more than, like, 1.2 seconds,
328460	331460	you realize that they're nonsense.
331460	333460	They're actually less than nothing sometimes.
333460	336460	Take, for example, this section from Bang Ukraine.
336460	338460	Ukraine is what I call a paint-over culture.
338460	342460	Ukrainians don't try to fix problems, they paint over them instead.
342460	344460	The women do this with their excessive use of makeup,
344460	347460	fake eyebrows, and fake eyelashes.
347460	349460	A fat Ukrainian man who looks like Jabba the Hutt
349460	352460	will paint over himself with a Mercedes-Benz.
352460	355460	Ukrainians look for quick fixes and shortcuts
355460	358460	to give them the appearance of beauty or success.
358460	362460	Roosh has invented an entirely new sociological term
362460	367460	to describe the new phenomenon of women wearing fake eyelashes
367460	371460	and men compensating for things by buying nice cars.
373460	375460	Only in Ukraine, am I right?
375460	377460	Roosh's books are full of Barnum statements like this,
377460	380460	where he pretends he's come up with something unique to that culture
380460	382460	when, in fact, he's saying the same thing again,
382460	385460	but he's come up with a different pithy way of saying it.
385460	390460	He's basically writing horoscopes, but for desperate and lonely people.
390460	393460	He's basically writing horoscopes.
393460	395460	And if you're not the biggest fan of reading books,
395460	399460	Roosh has also brought his masterful understanding of sociology to YouTube,
399460	402460	where you can find him explaining how to approach women in bars...
403460	404460	using...
404460	407460	What you gotta do, it doesn't get easier than this.
407460	411460	Just stand next to the girl that you want to talk to,
411460	414460	wait until she gets... she gets her drink,
414460	418460	then tap her on the shoulder with your hand three times
418460	420460	after the transaction is complete,
420460	422460	and then deliver your opening line.
422460	424460	I have to... I...
424460	428460	Look, I wanted this video to feature some of Roosh's best arguments
428460	433460	so I could actually debunk them and explain why the ideas were wrong,
433460	435460	but...
435460	439460	this is a video of a 37-year-old man
439460	443460	using Lego to explain how to approach women.
443460	445460	It debunks itself.
445460	447460	Through words, it's hard to explain,
447460	450460	so what I did is I went to the toy store and I bought some dolls.
450460	452460	I... I'm out of a fucking job now.
452460	456460	These people are too stupid to even bother ridiculing.
456460	458460	I'm done. I quit. See ya.
461460	463460	Ah, fuck it. Ah, fine, fine, whatever.
463460	465460	He might be easy prey,
465460	468460	but let's at least make fun of his audience and website while we're at it.
468460	469460	Why not?
469460	471460	In addition to creating Return of Kings,
471460	474460	a website which oscillates between advice for picking up sluts
474460	477460	and getting angry that people settle for used women...
477460	481460	I'm beginning to think that these guys have an internally contradicting ideology,
481460	483460	but that might just be me.
483460	486460	He also runs Rouge V Forum, a small personal army of customer...
486460	488460	sorry, definite real friends he likes
488460	490460	that at one point he tried to get to assemble
490460	492460	in various locations throughout the world
492460	494460	for some kind of mass demonstration.
494460	496460	He is prominent and, I'm gonna be honest,
496460	498460	just better YouTuber Dan Olson
498460	500460	with a story about one of the meetups he infiltrated.
500460	503460	Okay, so back in January 2016,
503460	505460	confessed rapist Rouge V starts planning
505460	508460	this global semi-simultaneous meetup of fans
509460	512460	to, like, discuss what it means to be their myopic,
512460	514460	atrophied idea of a real man
514460	517460	and generally just, you know, complain about women.
517460	520460	Now, they do most of this planning just in public forums,
520460	523460	which, you know, usually for a meetup is fine.
523460	526460	No one cares about your little fan club meeting.
526460	528460	Unless you're a rapist who runs a rape blog
528460	530460	that teaches other men how to rape,
530460	533460	in which case you're probably gonna get some pushback.
533460	535460	So things get kinda heated.
535460	537460	Mostly on social media,
537460	539460	and Rouge goes and locks down his forum
539460	541460	and starts changing all of the plans,
541460	545460	and it just gets gonzo so fast.
545460	546460	Like, not just,
546460	548460	hey, take it to a private conversation.
548460	550460	They start immediately building, like,
550460	554460	three, four layers of bad spy thriller nonsense
554460	555460	into the whole thing.
555460	557460	Now, I'd already had an undercover account
557460	558460	on his forums for a while,
558460	560460	so I can just see all of this.
560460	562460	And the local meetup,
562460	565460	they wanted me to prove my loyalty
565460	567460	before they told me the meetup location
567460	570460	by sending a screencap of an Amazon receipt
570460	573460	for one of Rouge's books.
573460	574460	Okay.
574460	576460	So the next stage is
576460	579460	everyone's going to meet up at one location at 7.30,
579460	583460	then move to the actual location at 7.40.
583460	585460	So there's only a 10-minute window
585460	588460	to actually, like, meet up with the rest of the people.
588460	591460	And now, how do you know you're meeting the right people?
591460	592460	Well, you walk up to them,
592460	593460	and the code phrase,
593460	595460	the code phrase you ask them is,
595460	596460	is this the place?
596460	598460	And the countersign is,
598460	601460	yes, but only because of the cancellation.
601460	604460	Quote, any other answer or hesitation,
604460	606460	and you'll know they're just a bystander.
606460	608460	Oh, they also reminded everyone
608460	611460	that you probably shouldn't bring any weapons to this event,
611460	612460	that they're totally insisting
612460	615460	it's just some dudes getting together
615460	616460	to be dudes together.
616460	619460	So anyway, I jump through all of these hoops.
619460	620460	The evening comes.
620460	622460	I go to the first meeting spot,
622460	626460	and now, this is early February in Calgary at night.
626460	628460	It is so cold out.
630460	631460	But any which way,
631460	634460	I hang around for a good 20, almost 30 minutes,
634460	636460	and no one asks me if this is the place.
636460	637460	No one else shows up.
637460	639460	No one else lurks around
639460	642460	like they're too shy to ask complete strangers
642460	643460	some code word.
643460	644460	Nothing.
644460	646460	So I check my email real quick,
646460	647460	just to be sure,
647460	651460	and there's this whole string of emails
651460	655460	that had come while I was traveling there and waiting.
655460	657460	So all these last-minute emails
657460	658460	where people are like,
658460	661460	Hey guys, it's really cold out,
661460	663460	and I'm tired from work,
663460	665460	so have fun without me.
667460	668460	So that's it.
668460	669460	I'm the entire meetup
669460	671460	for the Calgary chapter of Return of Kings.
671460	673460	The Calgary chapter of Return of Kings
673460	677460	has a 100% SJW saturation rate.
677460	680460	It is intensely compromised.
681460	683460	And as the reigning king of that meetup,
683460	685460	I decide, you know what?
685460	688460	Let's move this totally-not-betacuck meeting
688460	690460	to Fatburger.
690460	692460	So I went to Fatburger,
692460	694460	and it was delicious.
698460	701460	His books also contain a shit ton of alpha-praising nonsense.
701460	703460	You know, the stuff based on a debunked study
703460	705460	we covered in the Golden One video?
705460	707460	Beta males have a serious problem
707460	709460	with telling their lady friends
709460	711460	that they like them.
711460	715460	Pick-up artistry and alpha-masculinity-praising ideology
715460	717460	don't so much go hand-in-hand
717460	720460	as they're the same two hands shaking each other
720460	722460	belonging to the same man
722460	723460	because they're the same.
723460	726460	I'm yet to find someone who thinks pick-up artistry is great
726460	729460	but doesn't praise all the other ridiculous bullshit.
729460	731460	These things kind of have to go together.
731460	735460	Heck, the Golden One has plenty of videos about dating.
735460	737460	In fact, that's what gave me the idea to do this one.
737460	738460	Remember this part of the video?
738460	740460	If I ever need any dating advice,
740460	742460	and what are the odds of that,
742460	743460	I'll look you up.
743460	745460	Yeah, well, uh,
745460	748460	that was a setup for this video.
748460	752460	Welcome to the Hbomberguy Expanded Universe.
752460	755460	It's a book that triumphs being an alpha
755460	756460	with phrases like,
756460	759460	the alpha male does not care about what other people think of him,
759460	762460	written in a book which dedicates over 100 pages
762460	765460	to trying to make yourself look better than you actually are
765460	767460	so people will think more highly of you,
767460	769460	which it also admits doesn't work most of the time.
769460	773460	In a frankly stunning display of a monumental lack of self-awareness,
773460	776460	when describing what he feels as important alpha traits,
776460	777460	he writes,
777460	780460	The alpha male lives in his own reality.
780460	783460	Criticizing this behavior will probably net the criticism
783460	785460	from true believers that I'm some kind of baiter
785460	789460	who can't understand it or is too afraid of their desires
789460	792460	and the deep truths contained within this twerpish prose.
792460	796460	But ironically, I actually don't care what idiots think.
796460	798460	I'm the real alpha, basically.
798460	801460	It's me. I'm the good guy now. It's me.
801460	803460	Roosh has even invented his own particular version
803460	806460	of fake masculinity-praising ideology,
806460	808460	calling it neo-masculinity.
808460	811460	He prides it as a stunning return to the ancient periods
811460	813460	when men were real men like in these statues,
813460	816460	but because he hasn't read what those times were actually like
816460	819460	because he was too busy writing Barnum statements about Ukraine,
819460	822460	spoilers, they were really gay,
822460	824460	a thing neo-masculinity explicitly rejects,
824460	828460	he's really preaching a return to an imaginary time period
828460	830460	he made up in his mind.
830460	834460	In reality, idolizing a non-existent prelapsarian point in history
834460	837460	is like wanting to return to the Garden of Eden or the womb.
837460	840460	It's a pathology for only the saddest.
841460	845460	Okay, I wanted to do a thing where I remade one of Roosh's videos
845460	847460	with Lego and then made fun of it,
847460	850460	but this was literally all the Lego I could find.
850460	852460	This lady with the parish shirt and this beauty salon,
852460	856460	and there's like a giant toy lion that I still have for some reason,
856460	860460	but I threw out all my Legos when I became an adult,
860460	862460	so I can't really do this bit.
862460	866460	In a BBC3 documentary, Reggie Yates goes to one of Roosh's talks,
866460	868460	and in a small enclosed room,
868460	871460	Roosh outlines not the reasons why his philosophy works
871460	873460	and spreading tips for male self-improvement
873460	876460	or even more tips on how to pick up women.
876460	878460	Instead, we're treated to what I like to call
879460	883460	Offerings not of reasons why his way works or is successful,
883460	886460	but excuses for why it isn't.
886460	891460	Women are no longer trained to submit to a man, to serve a man.
891460	895460	Women are being applauded and encouraged
895460	899460	to look like fat, outer space cyborgs.
899460	904460	Women and gays are seen as superior to straight men.
904460	908460	Anything that a woman or a gay person wants is theirs,
908460	912460	but anything you want, sorry, we cannot help you.
912460	915460	Mainstream feminism is trying to destroy him.
915460	917460	Straight male people aren't being served
917460	920460	and aren't allowed to have their desires anymore.
920460	923460	The media lies and so on.
923460	927460	Social justice warriors and the feminists that are aligned with them
927460	928460	are like a virus.
928460	933460	They try to infect every platform, every group, every topic,
933460	937460	every niche to silence any kind of thought that they don't like.
937460	940460	We recently saw this with GamerGate.
940460	944460	The bedrock of this school of thought is fundamentally broken.
944460	948460	It's a worldview designed not to explain how to be a winner,
948460	951460	but to explain why you're a loser.
951460	954460	And don't worry, it's not because your ideas don't work.
954460	957460	It's not because you have a reductive view of women
957460	959460	and actively pursue not understanding them.
959460	962460	It's because women are too powerful.
962460	964460	And here, in this tiny basement,
964460	967460	we're gonna put them to rights by you paying me
967460	969460	to tell you you were right all along.
969460	972460	I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to put Roosh's version of pick-up artistry
972460	975460	in the maybe pile for now.
976460	977460	So, who's next?
977460	980460	Well, there's Matt Forney of mattforney.com,
980460	983460	whose avatar looks as little like Matt Forney as it could possibly be.
983460	987460	I'm seeing a happy, jovial fellow with perfectly sculpted facial hair.
987460	990460	You might want to get your money back from whoever you hired, mate.
990460	993460	They really didn't capture the bewildered sadness very well.
993460	997460	Much like Roosh, in fact, almost as if he's trying to be Roosh.
997460	1000460	He has his own website with his articles
1000460	1003460	and another really crappy-looking place where he sells his books.
1003460	1006460	But at least for him, pick-up artistry is just a side gig.
1006460	1008460	He just sells DO THE PHILIPPINES,
1008460	1011460	a title weirdly close in name to Roosh's books.
1011460	1012460	That's an odd similarity.
1012460	1014460	Wait. Hang on.
1014460	1018460	Almost the entire ad copy is borrowed in style and substance from Roosh's books.
1018460	1020460	Even the risk-free thing is simi...
1021460	1023460	This whole thing's a racket, isn't it?
1023460	1025460	They're just ripping off each other at this point.
1025460	1029460	I don't know about you, but I expected much more integrity and intellectual rigor
1029460	1031460	from the seduction community.
1031460	1033460	So it's like a game. You guys are writing the same thing.
1033460	1036460	Oh, look, and he got a bunch of totally-not-his-friends
1036460	1038460	to write recommendations for the book.
1038460	1040460	It's clear to me, reading this book,
1040460	1044460	that Matt Forney fell in love with the Philippines and her women
1044460	1048460	and that he wishes they find love with men who will love them.
1048460	1052460	Yeah, there must be a lot of love in Matt Forney's heart
1052460	1054460	for women, for them to find love,
1054460	1058460	and also a love for the financial success of Roosh's books.
1058460	1060460	To exacerbate that sense of love
1060460	1065460	that Matt Forney simply excretes from every orifice like a sexy puss,
1065460	1067460	let's read from one of his advice articles,
1067460	1068460	entitled,
1068460	1071460	How to Crush a Girl's Self-Esteem.
1071460	1073460	Can you feel the fucking love yet?!
1073460	1076460	Merely banging a girl isn't enough for a man.
1076460	1081460	He needs to possess her very being to be satisfied.
1082460	1083460	It's a policy.
1087460	1092460	Any ladies out there want to have their very beings possessed?
1092460	1096460	One, constantly make her feel inadequate.
1096460	1099460	You should rarely give her unqualified praise.
1099460	1101460	Every time she does something for you,
1101460	1105460	find out what she did wrong and remind her of it.
1105460	1108460	If you can't find any problems, make some up.
1108460	1112460	Nothing she does can ever be good enough for you.
1112460	1114460	I felt slimy saying that one.
1114460	1120460	This is how you can crush her self-image and own her mind, body, and soul.
1120460	1122460	Oh my God, what a wonderfully positive article.
1122460	1125460	Matt finally admits women have souls.
1125460	1127460	Matt then goes on to describe a situation in which
1127460	1130460	being a bad boyfriend and insulting his girlfriend
1130460	1132460	stopped her from eating what she wanted at lunch.
1132460	1134460	Matt is currently single.
1134460	1137460	Somehow, I'm sure it's feminism's fault.
1137460	1138460	Oh, another article of his.
1138460	1141460	No head, please. I'm female.
1141460	1143460	Oh, boy.
1143460	1145460	Whenever my husband goes down on me,
1145460	1148460	I just get frustrated and I end up asking him to stop.
1148460	1151460	It took me ages to figure out what was wrong.
1151460	1153460	Cunnilingus is unnatural for women.
1153460	1156460	It seems that Matt briefly operated a website
1156460	1158460	called Virginia's Secret Garden,
1158460	1161460	a website where he pretended to be his ideal woman,
1161460	1164460	a submissive Christian housewife living in the Midwest.
1164460	1166460	Not only that, I've come to believe that going down on a girl
1166460	1169460	upsets the natural order of masculine dominance.
1169460	1171460	When a man goes down on a woman, the dynamic is flipped.
1171460	1174460	He's a submissive one and you're the one he's desperate to please.
1174460	1177460	It's a complete perversion of the natural order.
1177460	1179460	Using his personal fan fiction as a mouthpiece,
1179460	1182460	Matt claims that Cunnilingus is unnatural because he,
1182460	1185460	by which I mean made-up person Virginia Robinson,
1185460	1187460	doesn't enjoy it.
1187460	1189460	As much as a man as my husband is,
1189460	1191460	I can't respect him when he's dragging his tongue
1191460	1193460	across my nether regions.
1193460	1195460	Women aren't going to respect you less
1195460	1197460	if you go down on them, Matt.
1197460	1200460	It's impossible for women to have any less respect for you
1200460	1202460	than they already do.
1202460	1204460	I'm going to say it again
1204460	1207460	to let it sink in.
1207460	1210460	Matt Forney is so scared of
1210460	1213460	or mad about oral sex
1213460	1216460	that he invented a fake woman
1216460	1218460	to tell him it's okay
1218460	1221460	and that she never liked it anyway.
1225460	1227460	That sounds like a compelling argument.
1227460	1229460	Which brings us to the oddest thing
1229460	1231460	about the séduction communautaire,
1231460	1234460	that even the sex isn't fun for anyone involved
1234460	1236460	once they get around to it.
1236460	1238460	You have Rouche desperately trying to come up
1238460	1240460	with a reason to want to have sex,
1240460	1242460	struggling to describe it
1242460	1244460	in a way that actually sounds fun,
1244460	1247460	insisting that you just shouldn't worry about technique.
1247460	1249460	It's just a rod of tissue.
1249460	1251460	You have the Golden One calling it
1251460	1253460	a not-especially-pleasing activity
1253460	1255460	and just a transaction of power.
1255460	1257460	You have Matt Forney inventing fake women
1257460	1260460	to explain that sex wasn't supposed to be fun.
1260460	1262460	And you have this red-pill philosophy bloke,
1262460	1264460	fellow YouTuber ContraPoints,
1264460	1266460	pointed out in one of his videos,
1266460	1268460	to be utterly disgusted by sex as a concept.
1268460	1270460	"'Cause at the end of the day,
1270460	1272460	sex, you're gonna be impaling her
1272460	1274460	with your ugly, engorged penis.
1274460	1276460	There's nothing pretty about that.
1276460	1278460	No pretty boy, okay?"
1278460	1280460	I have a question.
1280460	1282460	If pleasure doesn't matter
1282460	1284460	and the person you're sleeping with doesn't matter to you
1284460	1286460	because you've pursued a worldview
1286460	1288460	based around thinking so little of them,
1288460	1290460	what's the fucking point?
1290460	1292460	The most damning thing about pickup artistry
1292460	1294460	is that it doesn't work even when it works
1295460	1297460	Nothing she does can ever be good enough for you.
1297460	1299460	Roosh claims that his techniques work,
1299460	1301460	but there is something of a conflict of interest, isn't there?
1301460	1303460	He's literally trying to sell you books
1303460	1305460	about the techniques.
1305460	1307460	Of course he'd say it works,
1307460	1309460	but assuming that he's not a lying conman
1309460	1311460	who wants your money,
1311460	1313460	is it actually making him happy?
1313460	1315460	I don't think it is.
1315460	1317460	Pickup artistry is a lifestyle in which you pursue
1317460	1319460	a happiness that you never arrive at
1319460	1321460	and hopefully make a little money on the way
1321460	1323460	conning other people into paying you for your tips
1323460	1325460	you probably copied from Roosh,
1325460	1327460	you plagiarist piece of shit!
1327460	1329460	The Prologue of Bang is a story about how hurt Roosh felt
1329460	1331460	when he discovered a girl he thought liked him
1331460	1333460	was dating someone else.
1333460	1335460	We would study together in groups and I could swear
1335460	1337460	she was giving me extra attention.
1337460	1339460	I analysed the situation with my nice guy friends
1339460	1341460	and we all concluded that she did like me
1341460	1343460	as more than a friend.
1343460	1345460	After a couple of weeks of hesitation,
1345460	1347460	I finally asked her out on a casual date to the movies.
1347460	1349460	She said she couldn't because she was very busy.
1349460	1351460	Weeks later, I'd see her on campus
1351460	1353460	holding hands with another guy.
1353460	1355460	Instead of listening to the lame
1357460	1359460	love songs like I usually did
1359460	1361460	for the first time I got angry.
1361460	1363460	A lifetime of frustration and not getting what I wanted
1363460	1365460	became focused on this one girl.
1365460	1367460	I was bitter that I, a nice guy,
1367460	1369460	was getting passed over for guys who I thought were losers.
1369460	1371460	If I did end up talking to her,
1371460	1373460	I would cut our conversation short.
1373460	1375460	When she would ask me to study, I'd lie
1375460	1377460	and say I was studying alone,
1377460	1379460	only for her to find my study group late at night in the library.
1379460	1381460	I started feeling good for treating her poorly.
1381460	1383460	I hated her and everything that she stood for,
1383460	1385460	which was my failure amidst women.
1385460	1387460	Roosh then details that
1387460	1389460	after doing this, he discovered she was
1389460	1391460	trying harder to be his friend.
1391460	1393460	He puts this down to girls secretly wanting bad boys
1393460	1395460	when an outside observer can see
1395460	1397460	it might be because she really did like him as a friend
1397460	1399460	and tried to continue it
1399460	1401460	even though she had a boyfriend.
1401460	1403460	The story then abruptly cuts off and goes into
1403460	1405460	a more general story about the power of being
1405460	1407460	mad at women. Presumably this is because
1407460	1409460	not only did this behavior never get him
1409460	1411460	the girl, but she probably
1411460	1413460	eventually gave up on their friendship and moved on
1413460	1415460	with her life, and he doesn't want to
1415460	1417460	mention that bit. His very first
1417460	1419460	story about the success of his techniques
1419460	1421460	is a story about a friend
1421460	1423460	he pushed away because he was disappointed
1423460	1425460	he didn't get to fuck her.
1425460	1427460	He insists he used to be the stereotypical
1427460	1429460	nice guy, but it sounds like
1429460	1431460	he never really had any respect
1431460	1433460	for that person in the first place.
1433460	1435460	Pick-up artists call it game, and the name
1435460	1437460	comes from a particular non-fiction book called
1437460	1439460	The Game, penetrating the secret
1439460	1441460	society of pick-up artists. Oh, do you get it?
1441460	1443460	The author, journalist Neil Strauss,
1443460	1445460	initially saw success and
1445460	1447460	gained friendships with other sad little
1447460	1449460	boy men who idolize having the power to do
1449460	1451460	something they don't really like with women they don't
1451460	1453460	enjoy being with, and all of them
1453460	1455460	had cute little assumed names like
1455460	1457460	Mystery, Style,
1457460	1459460	Herbal, Playboy,
1459460	1461460	and of course Tyler Durden
1461460	1463460	because why wouldn't these people
1463460	1465460	identify as the deranged manifestation
1465460	1467460	of masculinity-worshipping ideology?
1467460	1469460	Spoilers, eventually Strauss'
1469460	1471460	relationships with the friends he made collapsed.
1471460	1473460	It turns out these people are emotionally
1473460	1475460	unstable. Who'd have thought?
1475460	1477460	And then he concludes that pick-up artistry is for
1477460	1479460	losers and attempts to rebuild his life.
1479460	1481460	I felt a little bad outright dismissing
1481460	1483460	this stuff as for losers just before,
1483460	1485460	but here's Neil Strauss,
1485460	1487460	the most prominent figure
1487460	1489460	to ever emerge from the
1489460	1491460	seduction community, saying it
1491460	1493460	himself. Ten years after
1493460	1495460	publishing The Game, Strauss put out a
1495460	1497460	book called The Truth, an uncomfortable
1497460	1499460	book about relationships.
1499460	1501460	Its provisional title was Game Over, or
1501460	1503460	as I like to call it, The Game Part Two
1503460	1505460	Guess What? Still Depressed.
1505460	1507460	The Truth is the opposite of The Game
1507460	1509460	in every way, even down to its
1509460	1511460	cover. It details Strauss trying to
1511460	1513460	put his life back together and have an actual rewarding
1513460	1515460	long-term relationship with another human
1515460	1517460	being. The guy's attempts to emotionally
1517460	1519460	recover and see people as people are
1519460	1521460	kind of commendable, and I hope the people
1521460	1523460	who desperately follow his earlier advice
1523460	1525460	also eventually experience the same
1525460	1527460	development. It would be nice if these
1527460	1529460	sad people stopped ruining their lives
1529460	1531460	and maybe helped others do the same,
1531460	1533460	but that might mean giving up on their
1533460	1535460	source of income, and in this economy,
1535460	1537460	pfft!
1537460	1539460	Thank you all very much for watching,
1539460	1541460	and also for being so patient with me.
1541460	1543460	This video took a really long time to make.
1543460	1545460	It turns out that doing tons of research
1545460	1547460	and reading a bunch of books actually
1547460	1549460	is really time-consuming.

1553460	1555460	Bye!
1567460	1569460	In any case, in addition to the names
1569460	1571460	scrolling past the screen right now, I'd especially
1571460	1573460	like to thank...
1597460	1599460	I hope that's right.
