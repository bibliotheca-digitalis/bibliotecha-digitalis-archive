1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
Are you having trouble attracting a mate?

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,460
Is no one responding to your dick pics despite listing

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,680
The Shawshank Redemption and The Big Lebowski as your favorite movies on your profile?

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,840
Do you, for some reason, invest way more value in sex than in genuine happiness or fulfilling relationships?

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,220
Hmm, yes, well, just one more question and then I can get you the help you need.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,640
Do you have any disposable income?

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,140
["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"]

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,580
Pickup artistry, or PUA, or as they call it, GAME,

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:33,400
refers to the apparently lost, secret technique of convincing people that sleeping with you is a good idea.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,340
["How do you ask for a date?"

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,940
Wikipedia politely calls them the

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,340
"...seduction community."

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,100
Ugh.

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,780
While the concept has been around since the 70s, the

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,500
"...community really got going in the Internet age.

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,940
On places like Usenet and later Reddit,

17
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,940
people who sit inside all day arguing with other men on the Internet

18
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,940
can take the time to trade tips on how they think women work.

19
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,100
And some people rose to the top to make careers from their writing

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,180
through ad-supported websites or self-published books on Amazon.

21
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,500
One such fellow, arguably the most popular, is

22
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,780
Dariush Felizadeh,

23
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:10,060
who calls himself Roush V because he knows most of his readership has trouble spelling and pronouncing difficult words.

24
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,460
He's written a whole bunch of books on pickup artistry and how to do it in various specific countries,

25
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,540
which you can buy on Amazon or his shady-ass Web 2.0-looking website.

26
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,460
You know, if there's one thing I just love doing,

27
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,460
it's paying other men to tell me what they think women think about stuff.

28
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,940
That's way more mature than asking them.

29
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,940
Let's read some of his breakout book!

30
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,940
Bang!

31
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,940
Shall we?

32
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,460
Why am I putting it in my mouth? That's stupid.

33
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,460
Never tell a girl that she's beautiful or hot,

34
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,460
because what that does is increase her value relative to yours.

35
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,460
Not complimenting will help you,

36
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,460
because you're withholding a reward that all women want,

37
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,460
one that they will stick around waiting for.

38
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,980
Do not discuss your feelings of emotion or attraction for her.

39
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,980
Never tell a girl you like her or feel something for her.

40
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,460
Only in movies will discussing your feelings ever get

41
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,980
THE DESIRABLE FEMALE.

42
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,460
We use indirect game without compliments,

43
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,980
where she's never completely sure about her feelings for her.

44
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,460
You're not hiding anything.

45
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,980
You're just being mysterious.

46
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,460
I am Roush V, lord of mysteries.

47
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,460
It is an act whereby a man inserts a rod-shaped mass of tissue

48
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:30,460
into a woman's lubricated cavity, also made of tissue.

49
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,460
Don't be too concerned with sexual technique.

50
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,460
Porn is my teacher.

51
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,460
A man rubs his rod in and out,

52
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,460
stimulating pleasure receptors until his brain decides on the right time

53
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,460
to eject a genetic package.

54
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,460
Since sex is supposed to be fun,

55
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,460
don't take it too seriously by questioning whether you're doing things right.

56
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,460
Worrying about her pleasure sacrifices your own.

57
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,460
Pump slowly, getting slightly farther in with each pump until...

58
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:07,460
HE LAUGHS

59
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,460
Congratulate yourself on the notch.

60
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,460
HE CHUCKLES

61
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,460
That's gross.

62
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,460
Oh, it's getting hot and sexy in here, isn't it?

63
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,460
Coming down with a case of the fucking vapors!

64
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,460
Now, I could go into detail about every single strategy in this book

65
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,460
and how it reveals a deeply unsettling inability to empathize with women as human beings

66
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,460
and how most of it doesn't actually work.

67
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,460
In fact, that's why this video took so long to make.

68
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,460
Initially, it was gonna be about every single thing in the book,

69
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,460
but what I actually find is really funny

70
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,460
is that Roush agrees with me about how poorly it works.

71
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,460
The most telling piece of advice in the book is actually its simplest.

72
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,460
Be prepared for a lot of disappointment.

73
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,460
Most phone numbers will go nowhere.

74
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:54,460
You're doing incredible if half the numbers you get result in a first date.

75
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,460
Even when your game gets really good,

76
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,460
you will still get rejected and have prospects that don't convert.

77
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:05,460
On your 100th approach, there will be the experience of 99 previous approaches at your back

78
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,460
helping you succeed.

79
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,460
This is why it is better to be the man that tries and fails

80
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,460
than one who does not try at all.

81
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,460
Now, on a certain level, yeah, dating is easier for you

82
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,460
because of how you approach it if you accept that not everyone will accept you

83
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,460
and no set of tactics will work on 100% of women.

84
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,460
But combined with the rest of this fucking shitty nonsense advice,

85
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,460
it's an admission of failure.

86
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,460
If I wrote a guide on how to succeed at Dota

87
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,460
and the first chapter started with,

88
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,460
get used to disappointment, following these tips you'll only actually win

89
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,460
one in a hundred times,

90
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,460
you'd want your fucking money back, wouldn't you?

91
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,460
This puts something of a dent in the idea that pickup artistry actually works, doesn't it?

92
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,460
It only looks like it works because it tells you to try it hundreds of times,

93
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,460
so people who are utterly committed to it will probably eventually see some results.

94
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,460
Does that actually mean it works, though?

95
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,460
I know I'm arguing semantics here, but if you roll six dice hundreds of times,

96
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,460
you'll eventually land all sixes,

97
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,460
but that doesn't mean I've taught you how to be a dice roll artist, does it?

98
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,460
It just goes on like that.

99
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,460
Honestly, I've read as many of the books that I could get a hold of

100
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,460
for less than asking price,

101
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,460
and they're basically the same book over and over again.

102
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,460
But I gotta give Roosh some credit, though.

103
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,460
First of all, he sold the same book in, like, 15 different forms to the same people,

104
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,460
but he's also very good at constructing sentences

105
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,460
that sound deep and introspective and original,

106
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,460
but if you think about them for more than, like, 1.2 seconds,

107
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,460
you realize that they're nonsense.

108
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,460
They're actually less than nothing sometimes.

109
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,460
Take, for example, this section from Bang Ukraine.

110
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,460
Ukraine is what I call a paint-over culture.

111
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,460
Ukrainians don't try to fix problems, they paint over them instead.

112
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,460
The women do this with their excessive use of makeup,

113
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,460
fake eyebrows, and fake eyelashes.

114
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,460
A fat Ukrainian man who looks like Jabba the Hutt

115
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,460
will paint over himself with a Mercedes-Benz.

116
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,460
Ukrainians look for quick fixes and shortcuts

117
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,460
to give them the appearance of beauty or success.

118
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,460
Roosh has invented an entirely new sociological term

119
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,460
to describe the new phenomenon of women wearing fake eyelashes

120
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,460
and men compensating for things by buying nice cars.

121
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,460
Only in Ukraine, am I right?

122
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,460
Roosh's books are full of Barnum statements like this,

123
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,460
where he pretends he's come up with something unique to that culture

124
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,460
when, in fact, he's saying the same thing again,

125
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,460
but he's come up with a different pithy way of saying it.

126
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:30,460
He's basically writing horoscopes, but for desperate and lonely people.

127
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,460
He's basically writing horoscopes.

128
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,460
And if you're not the biggest fan of reading books,

129
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,460
Roosh has also brought his masterful understanding of sociology to YouTube,

130
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,460
where you can find him explaining how to approach women in bars...

131
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,460
using...

132
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,460
What you gotta do, it doesn't get easier than this.

133
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,460
Just stand next to the girl that you want to talk to,

134
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,460
wait until she gets... she gets her drink,

135
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,460
then tap her on the shoulder with your hand three times

136
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,460
after the transaction is complete,

137
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,460
and then deliver your opening line.

138
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,460
I have to... I...

139
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,460
Look, I wanted this video to feature some of Roosh's best arguments

140
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,460
so I could actually debunk them and explain why the ideas were wrong,

141
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,460
but...

142
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,460
this is a video of a 37-year-old man

143
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,460
using Lego to explain how to approach women.

144
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,460
It debunks itself.

145
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,460
Through words, it's hard to explain,

146
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,460
so what I did is I went to the toy store and I bought some dolls.

147
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,460
I... I'm out of a fucking job now.

148
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,460
These people are too stupid to even bother ridiculing.

149
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,460
I'm done. I quit. See ya.

150
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,460
Ah, fuck it. Ah, fine, fine, whatever.

151
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,460
He might be easy prey,

152
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,460
but let's at least make fun of his audience and website while we're at it.

153
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,460
Why not?

154
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,460
In addition to creating Return of Kings,

155
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,460
a website which oscillates between advice for picking up sluts

156
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,460
and getting angry that people settle for used women...

157
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,460
I'm beginning to think that these guys have an internally contradicting ideology,

158
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,460
but that might just be me.

159
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,460
He also runs Rouge V Forum, a small personal army of customer...

160
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,460
sorry, definite real friends he likes

161
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,460
that at one point he tried to get to assemble

162
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,460
in various locations throughout the world

163
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,460
for some kind of mass demonstration.

164
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,460
He is prominent and, I'm gonna be honest,

165
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,460
just better YouTuber Dan Olson

166
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,460
with a story about one of the meetups he infiltrated.

167
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,460
Okay, so back in January 2016,

168
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,460
confessed rapist Rouge V starts planning

169
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,460
this global semi-simultaneous meetup of fans

170
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,460
to, like, discuss what it means to be their myopic,

171
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,460
atrophied idea of a real man

172
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,460
and generally just, you know, complain about women.

173
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,460
Now, they do most of this planning just in public forums,

174
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,460
which, you know, usually for a meetup is fine.

175
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,460
No one cares about your little fan club meeting.

176
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,460
Unless you're a rapist who runs a rape blog

177
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,460
that teaches other men how to rape,

178
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,460
in which case you're probably gonna get some pushback.

179
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,460
So things get kinda heated.

180
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,460
Mostly on social media,

181
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,460
and Rouge goes and locks down his forum

182
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,460
and starts changing all of the plans,

183
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,460
and it just gets gonzo so fast.

184
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,460
Like, not just,

185
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,460
hey, take it to a private conversation.

186
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,460
They start immediately building, like,

187
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,460
three, four layers of bad spy thriller nonsense

188
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,460
into the whole thing.

189
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,460
Now, I'd already had an undercover account

190
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,460
on his forums for a while,

191
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,460
so I can just see all of this.

192
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,460
And the local meetup,

193
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,460
they wanted me to prove my loyalty

194
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,460
before they told me the meetup location

195
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,460
by sending a screencap of an Amazon receipt

196
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,460
for one of Rouge's books.

197
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,460
Okay.

198
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,460
So the next stage is

199
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,460
everyone's going to meet up at one location at 7.30,

200
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,460
then move to the actual location at 7.40.

201
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,460
So there's only a 10-minute window

202
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,460
to actually, like, meet up with the rest of the people.

203
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,460
And now, how do you know you're meeting the right people?

204
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,460
Well, you walk up to them,

205
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,460
and the code phrase,

206
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,460
the code phrase you ask them is,

207
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,460
is this the place?

208
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,460
And the countersign is,

209
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,460
yes, but only because of the cancellation.

210
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,460
Quote, any other answer or hesitation,

211
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,460
and you'll know they're just a bystander.

212
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,460
Oh, they also reminded everyone

213
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,460
that you probably shouldn't bring any weapons to this event,

214
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,460
that they're totally insisting

215
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,460
it's just some dudes getting together

216
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,460
to be dudes together.

217
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,460
So anyway, I jump through all of these hoops.

218
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,460
The evening comes.

219
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,460
I go to the first meeting spot,

220
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,460
and now, this is early February in Calgary at night.

221
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,460
It is so cold out.

222
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,460
But any which way,

223
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,460
I hang around for a good 20, almost 30 minutes,

224
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,460
and no one asks me if this is the place.

225
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,460
No one else shows up.

226
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,460
No one else lurks around

227
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,460
like they're too shy to ask complete strangers

228
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,460
some code word.

229
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,460
Nothing.

230
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,460
So I check my email real quick,

231
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,460
just to be sure,

232
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:51,460
and there's this whole string of emails

233
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,460
that had come while I was traveling there and waiting.

234
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,460
So all these last-minute emails

235
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,460
where people are like,

236
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,460
Hey guys, it's really cold out,

237
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,460
and I'm tired from work,

238
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,460
so have fun without me.

239
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,460
So that's it.

240
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,460
I'm the entire meetup

241
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,460
for the Calgary chapter of Return of Kings.

242
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,460
The Calgary chapter of Return of Kings

243
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:17,460
has a 100% SJW saturation rate.

244
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,460
It is intensely compromised.

245
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,460
And as the reigning king of that meetup,

246
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,460
I decide, you know what?

247
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,460
Let's move this totally-not-betacuck meeting

248
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,460
to Fatburger.

249
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,460
So I went to Fatburger,

250
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,460
and it was delicious.

251
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,460
His books also contain a shit ton of alpha-praising nonsense.

252
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,460
You know, the stuff based on a debunked study

253
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,460
we covered in the Golden One video?

254
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,460
Beta males have a serious problem

255
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,460
with telling their lady friends

256
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,460
that they like them.

257
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,460
Pick-up artistry and alpha-masculinity-praising ideology

258
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,460
don't so much go hand-in-hand

259
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,460
as they're the same two hands shaking each other

260
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,460
belonging to the same man

261
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,460
because they're the same.

262
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,460
I'm yet to find someone who thinks pick-up artistry is great

263
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,460
but doesn't praise all the other ridiculous bullshit.

264
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,460
These things kind of have to go together.

265
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,460
Heck, the Golden One has plenty of videos about dating.

266
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,460
In fact, that's what gave me the idea to do this one.

267
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,460
Remember this part of the video?

268
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,460
If I ever need any dating advice,

269
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,460
and what are the odds of that,

270
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,460
I'll look you up.

271
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,460
Yeah, well, uh,

272
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,460
that was a setup for this video.

273
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:32,460
Welcome to the Hbomberguy Expanded Universe.

274
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,460
It's a book that triumphs being an alpha

275
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,460
with phrases like,

276
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,460
the alpha male does not care about what other people think of him,

277
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,460
written in a book which dedicates over 100 pages

278
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,460
to trying to make yourself look better than you actually are

279
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,460
so people will think more highly of you,

280
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,460
which it also admits doesn't work most of the time.

281
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,460
In a frankly stunning display of a monumental lack of self-awareness,

282
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,460
when describing what he feels as important alpha traits,

283
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,460
he writes,

284
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,460
The alpha male lives in his own reality.

285
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,460
Criticizing this behavior will probably net the criticism

286
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,460
from true believers that I'm some kind of baiter

287
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,460
who can't understand it or is too afraid of their desires

288
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,460
and the deep truths contained within this twerpish prose.

289
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,460
But ironically, I actually don't care what idiots think.

290
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,460
I'm the real alpha, basically.

291
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,460
It's me. I'm the good guy now. It's me.

292
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,460
Roosh has even invented his own particular version

293
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,460
of fake masculinity-praising ideology,

294
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,460
calling it neo-masculinity.

295
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,460
He prides it as a stunning return to the ancient periods

296
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,460
when men were real men like in these statues,

297
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,460
but because he hasn't read what those times were actually like

298
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,460
because he was too busy writing Barnum statements about Ukraine,

299
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,460
spoilers, they were really gay,

300
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,460
a thing neo-masculinity explicitly rejects,

301
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,460
he's really preaching a return to an imaginary time period

302
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,460
he made up in his mind.

303
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,460
In reality, idolizing a non-existent prelapsarian point in history

304
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,460
is like wanting to return to the Garden of Eden or the womb.

305
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,460
It's a pathology for only the saddest.

306
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,460
Okay, I wanted to do a thing where I remade one of Roosh's videos

307
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,460
with Lego and then made fun of it,

308
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,460
but this was literally all the Lego I could find.

309
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,460
This lady with the parish shirt and this beauty salon,

310
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,460
and there's like a giant toy lion that I still have for some reason,

311
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,460
but I threw out all my Legos when I became an adult,

312
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,460
so I can't really do this bit.

313
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,460
In a BBC3 documentary, Reggie Yates goes to one of Roosh's talks,

314
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,460
and in a small enclosed room,

315
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,460
Roosh outlines not the reasons why his philosophy works

316
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,460
and spreading tips for male self-improvement

317
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,460
or even more tips on how to pick up women.

318
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,460
Instead, we're treated to what I like to call

319
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,460
Offerings not of reasons why his way works or is successful,

320
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,460
but excuses for why it isn't.

321
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:51,460
Women are no longer trained to submit to a man, to serve a man.

322
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,460
Women are being applauded and encouraged

323
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,460
to look like fat, outer space cyborgs.

324
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:04,460
Women and gays are seen as superior to straight men.

325
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,460
Anything that a woman or a gay person wants is theirs,

326
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,460
but anything you want, sorry, we cannot help you.

327
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,460
Mainstream feminism is trying to destroy him.

328
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,460
Straight male people aren't being served

329
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,460
and aren't allowed to have their desires anymore.

330
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,460
The media lies and so on.

331
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,460
Social justice warriors and the feminists that are aligned with them

332
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,460
are like a virus.

333
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,460
They try to infect every platform, every group, every topic,

334
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,460
every niche to silence any kind of thought that they don't like.

335
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,460
We recently saw this with GamerGate.

336
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:44,460
The bedrock of this school of thought is fundamentally broken.

337
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,460
It's a worldview designed not to explain how to be a winner,

338
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,460
but to explain why you're a loser.

339
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,460
And don't worry, it's not because your ideas don't work.

340
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,460
It's not because you have a reductive view of women

341
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,460
and actively pursue not understanding them.

342
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,460
It's because women are too powerful.

343
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,460
And here, in this tiny basement,

344
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,460
we're gonna put them to rights by you paying me

345
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,460
to tell you you were right all along.

346
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,460
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to put Roosh's version of pick-up artistry

347
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,460
in the maybe pile for now.

348
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,460
So, who's next?

349
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,460
Well, there's Matt Forney of mattforney.com,

350
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,460
whose avatar looks as little like Matt Forney as it could possibly be.

351
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:27,460
I'm seeing a happy, jovial fellow with perfectly sculpted facial hair.

352
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,460
You might want to get your money back from whoever you hired, mate.

353
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,460
They really didn't capture the bewildered sadness very well.

354
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,460
Much like Roosh, in fact, almost as if he's trying to be Roosh.

355
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,460
He has his own website with his articles

356
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,460
and another really crappy-looking place where he sells his books.

357
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,460
But at least for him, pick-up artistry is just a side gig.

358
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,460
He just sells DO THE PHILIPPINES,

359
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,460
a title weirdly close in name to Roosh's books.

360
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,460
That's an odd similarity.

361
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,460
Wait. Hang on.

362
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:58,460
Almost the entire ad copy is borrowed in style and substance from Roosh's books.

363
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,460
Even the risk-free thing is simi...

364
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,460
This whole thing's a racket, isn't it?

365
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,460
They're just ripping off each other at this point.

366
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,460
I don't know about you, but I expected much more integrity and intellectual rigor

367
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,460
from the seduction community.

368
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,460
So it's like a game. You guys are writing the same thing.

369
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,460
Oh, look, and he got a bunch of totally-not-his-friends

370
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,460
to write recommendations for the book.

371
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,460
It's clear to me, reading this book,

372
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:24,460
that Matt Forney fell in love with the Philippines and her women

373
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,460
and that he wishes they find love with men who will love them.

374
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,460
Yeah, there must be a lot of love in Matt Forney's heart

375
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,460
for women, for them to find love,

376
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,460
and also a love for the financial success of Roosh's books.

377
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,460
To exacerbate that sense of love

378
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,460
that Matt Forney simply excretes from every orifice like a sexy puss,

379
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,460
let's read from one of his advice articles,

380
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,460
entitled,

381
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,460
How to Crush a Girl's Self-Esteem.

382
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,460
Can you feel the fucking love yet?!

383
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,460
Merely banging a girl isn't enough for a man.

384
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:01,460
He needs to possess her very being to be satisfied.

385
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,460
It's a policy.

386
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,460
Any ladies out there want to have their very beings possessed?

387
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,460
One, constantly make her feel inadequate.

388
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,460
You should rarely give her unqualified praise.

389
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,460
Every time she does something for you,

390
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:25,460
find out what she did wrong and remind her of it.

391
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,460
If you can't find any problems, make some up.

392
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,460
Nothing she does can ever be good enough for you.

393
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,460
I felt slimy saying that one.

394
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:40,460
This is how you can crush her self-image and own her mind, body, and soul.

395
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,460
Oh my God, what a wonderfully positive article.

396
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,460
Matt finally admits women have souls.

397
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,460
Matt then goes on to describe a situation in which

398
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,460
being a bad boyfriend and insulting his girlfriend

399
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,460
stopped her from eating what she wanted at lunch.

400
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,460
Matt is currently single.

401
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,460
Somehow, I'm sure it's feminism's fault.

402
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,460
Oh, another article of his.

403
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,460
No head, please. I'm female.

404
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,460
Oh, boy.

405
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,460
Whenever my husband goes down on me,

406
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,460
I just get frustrated and I end up asking him to stop.

407
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,460
It took me ages to figure out what was wrong.

408
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,460
Cunnilingus is unnatural for women.

409
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,460
It seems that Matt briefly operated a website

410
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,460
called Virginia's Secret Garden,

411
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,460
a website where he pretended to be his ideal woman,

412
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,460
a submissive Christian housewife living in the Midwest.

413
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,460
Not only that, I've come to believe that going down on a girl

414
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,460
upsets the natural order of masculine dominance.

415
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,460
When a man goes down on a woman, the dynamic is flipped.

416
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,460
He's a submissive one and you're the one he's desperate to please.

417
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,460
It's a complete perversion of the natural order.

418
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,460
Using his personal fan fiction as a mouthpiece,

419
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,460
Matt claims that Cunnilingus is unnatural because he,

420
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,460
by which I mean made-up person Virginia Robinson,

421
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,460
doesn't enjoy it.

422
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,460
As much as a man as my husband is,

423
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,460
I can't respect him when he's dragging his tongue

424
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,460
across my nether regions.

425
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,460
Women aren't going to respect you less

426
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,460
if you go down on them, Matt.

427
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,460
It's impossible for women to have any less respect for you

428
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,460
than they already do.

429
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,460
I'm going to say it again

430
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,460
to let it sink in.

431
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,460
Matt Forney is so scared of

432
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,460
or mad about oral sex

433
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,460
that he invented a fake woman

434
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,460
to tell him it's okay

435
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,460
and that she never liked it anyway.

436
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,460
That sounds like a compelling argument.

437
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,460
Which brings us to the oddest thing

438
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,460
about the séduction communautaire,

439
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,460
that even the sex isn't fun for anyone involved

440
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,460
once they get around to it.

441
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,460
You have Rouche desperately trying to come up

442
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,460
with a reason to want to have sex,

443
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,460
struggling to describe it

444
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,460
in a way that actually sounds fun,

445
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,460
insisting that you just shouldn't worry about technique.

446
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,460
It's just a rod of tissue.

447
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,460
You have the Golden One calling it

448
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,460
a not-especially-pleasing activity

449
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,460
and just a transaction of power.

450
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,460
You have Matt Forney inventing fake women

451
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,460
to explain that sex wasn't supposed to be fun.

452
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,460
And you have this red-pill philosophy bloke,

453
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,460
fellow YouTuber ContraPoints,

454
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,460
pointed out in one of his videos,

455
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,460
to be utterly disgusted by sex as a concept.

456
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,460
"'Cause at the end of the day,

457
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,460
sex, you're gonna be impaling her

458
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,460
with your ugly, engorged penis.

459
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,460
There's nothing pretty about that.

460
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,460
No pretty boy, okay?"

461
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,460
I have a question.

462
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,460
If pleasure doesn't matter

463
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,460
and the person you're sleeping with doesn't matter to you

464
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,460
because you've pursued a worldview

465
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,460
based around thinking so little of them,

466
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,460
what's the fucking point?

467
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,460
The most damning thing about pickup artistry

468
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,460
is that it doesn't work even when it works

469
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,460
Nothing she does can ever be good enough for you.

470
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,460
Roosh claims that his techniques work,

471
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,460
but there is something of a conflict of interest, isn't there?

472
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,460
He's literally trying to sell you books

473
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,460
about the techniques.

474
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,460
Of course he'd say it works,

475
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,460
but assuming that he's not a lying conman

476
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,460
who wants your money,

477
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,460
is it actually making him happy?

478
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,460
I don't think it is.

479
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,460
Pickup artistry is a lifestyle in which you pursue

480
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,460
a happiness that you never arrive at

481
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,460
and hopefully make a little money on the way

482
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,460
conning other people into paying you for your tips

483
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,460
you probably copied from Roosh,

484
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,460
you plagiarist piece of shit!

485
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,460
The Prologue of Bang is a story about how hurt Roosh felt

486
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,460
when he discovered a girl he thought liked him

487
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,460
was dating someone else.

488
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,460
We would study together in groups and I could swear

489
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,460
she was giving me extra attention.

490
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,460
I analysed the situation with my nice guy friends

491
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,460
and we all concluded that she did like me

492
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,460
as more than a friend.

493
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,460
After a couple of weeks of hesitation,

494
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,460
I finally asked her out on a casual date to the movies.

495
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,460
She said she couldn't because she was very busy.

496
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,460
Weeks later, I'd see her on campus

497
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,460
holding hands with another guy.

498
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,460
Instead of listening to the lame

499
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,460
love songs like I usually did

500
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,460
for the first time I got angry.

501
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,460
A lifetime of frustration and not getting what I wanted

502
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,460
became focused on this one girl.

503
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,460
I was bitter that I, a nice guy,

504
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,460
was getting passed over for guys who I thought were losers.

505
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,460
If I did end up talking to her,

506
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,460
I would cut our conversation short.

507
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,460
When she would ask me to study, I'd lie

508
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,460
and say I was studying alone,

509
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,460
only for her to find my study group late at night in the library.

510
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,460
I started feeling good for treating her poorly.

511
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,460
I hated her and everything that she stood for,

512
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,460
which was my failure amidst women.

513
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,460
Roosh then details that

514
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,460
after doing this, he discovered she was

515
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,460
trying harder to be his friend.

516
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,460
He puts this down to girls secretly wanting bad boys

517
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,460
when an outside observer can see

518
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,460
it might be because she really did like him as a friend

519
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,460
and tried to continue it

520
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,460
even though she had a boyfriend.

521
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,460
The story then abruptly cuts off and goes into

522
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,460
a more general story about the power of being

523
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,460
mad at women. Presumably this is because

524
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,460
not only did this behavior never get him

525
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,460
the girl, but she probably

526
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,460
eventually gave up on their friendship and moved on

527
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,460
with her life, and he doesn't want to

528
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,460
mention that bit. His very first

529
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,460
story about the success of his techniques

530
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,460
is a story about a friend

531
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,460
he pushed away because he was disappointed

532
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,460
he didn't get to fuck her.

533
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,460
He insists he used to be the stereotypical

534
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,460
nice guy, but it sounds like

535
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,460
he never really had any respect

536
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,460
for that person in the first place.

537
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,460
Pick-up artists call it game, and the name

538
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,460
comes from a particular non-fiction book called

539
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,460
The Game, penetrating the secret

540
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,460
society of pick-up artists. Oh, do you get it?

541
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,460
The author, journalist Neil Strauss,

542
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,460
initially saw success and

543
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,460
gained friendships with other sad little

544
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,460
boy men who idolize having the power to do

545
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,460
something they don't really like with women they don't

546
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,460
enjoy being with, and all of them

547
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,460
had cute little assumed names like

548
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,460
Mystery, Style,

549
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,460
Herbal, Playboy,

550
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,460
and of course Tyler Durden

551
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,460
because why wouldn't these people

552
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,460
identify as the deranged manifestation

553
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,460
of masculinity-worshipping ideology?

554
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,460
Spoilers, eventually Strauss'

555
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,460
relationships with the friends he made collapsed.

556
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,460
It turns out these people are emotionally

557
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,460
unstable. Who'd have thought?

558
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,460
And then he concludes that pick-up artistry is for

559
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,460
losers and attempts to rebuild his life.

560
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,460
I felt a little bad outright dismissing

561
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,460
this stuff as for losers just before,

562
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,460
but here's Neil Strauss,

563
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,460
the most prominent figure

564
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,460
to ever emerge from the

565
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,460
seduction community, saying it

566
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,460
himself. Ten years after

567
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,460
publishing The Game, Strauss put out a

568
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,460
book called The Truth, an uncomfortable

569
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,460
book about relationships.

570
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,460
Its provisional title was Game Over, or

571
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,460
as I like to call it, The Game Part Two

572
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,460
Guess What? Still Depressed.

573
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,460
The Truth is the opposite of The Game

574
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,460
in every way, even down to its

575
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,460
cover. It details Strauss trying to

576
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,460
put his life back together and have an actual rewarding

577
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,460
long-term relationship with another human

578
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,460
being. The guy's attempts to emotionally

579
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,460
recover and see people as people are

580
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,460
kind of commendable, and I hope the people

581
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,460
who desperately follow his earlier advice

582
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,460
also eventually experience the same

583
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,460
development. It would be nice if these

584
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,460
sad people stopped ruining their lives

585
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,460
and maybe helped others do the same,

586
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,460
but that might mean giving up on their

587
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,460
source of income, and in this economy,

588
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,460
pfft!

589
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,460
Thank you all very much for watching,

590
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,460
and also for being so patient with me.

591
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,460
This video took a really long time to make.

592
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,460
It turns out that doing tons of research

593
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,460
and reading a bunch of books actually

594
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,460
is really time-consuming.

595
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,460
So I hope you enjoyed this video,

596
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,460
and I'll see you next time.

597
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,460
Bye!

598
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,460
In any case, in addition to the names

599
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,460
scrolling past the screen right now, I'd especially

600
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,460
like to thank...

601
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,460
I hope that's right.

602
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,460
Knuckles the echidna in a pair of huge googly eyes

603
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,460
on a flaccid penis.

604
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,460
It's changed again!

Conilingus is unnatural for women!

Ha ha! I am not a

chain-smoking Mickey Mouse, I am just

646
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,460
a regular woman who hates Conilingus!

647
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,460
Ha ha! That's terrible, don't

648
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,460
use that. I mean, use it if you want to, but

649
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,460
it's terrible. Let me try it again.

650
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,460
Ow! Fuck!

651
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,460
Just bashed my fucking arm against the tripod

652
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,460
trying to make this thing work.
