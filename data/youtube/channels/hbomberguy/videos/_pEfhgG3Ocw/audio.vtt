00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
Are you having trouble attracting a mate?

00:02.240 --> 00:05.460
Is no one responding to your dick pics despite listing

00:05.460 --> 00:09.680
The Shawshank Redemption and The Big Lebowski as your favorite movies on your profile?

00:09.680 --> 00:14.840
Do you, for some reason, invest way more value in sex than in genuine happiness or fulfilling relationships?

00:15.280 --> 00:19.220
Hmm, yes, well, just one more question and then I can get you the help you need.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.640
Do you have any disposable income?

00:21.640 --> 00:24.140
["Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"]

00:25.100 --> 00:28.580
Pickup artistry, or PUA, or as they call it, GAME,

00:28.580 --> 00:33.400
refers to the apparently lost, secret technique of convincing people that sleeping with you is a good idea.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.340
["How do you ask for a date?"

00:35.960 --> 00:37.940
Wikipedia politely calls them the

00:37.940 --> 00:40.340
"...seduction community."

00:40.340 --> 00:41.100
Ugh.

00:41.100 --> 00:43.780
While the concept has been around since the 70s, the

00:43.780 --> 00:46.500
"...community really got going in the Internet age.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.940
On places like Usenet and later Reddit,

00:48.940 --> 00:51.940
people who sit inside all day arguing with other men on the Internet

00:51.940 --> 00:54.940
can take the time to trade tips on how they think women work.

00:54.940 --> 00:58.100
And some people rose to the top to make careers from their writing

00:58.100 --> 01:01.180
through ad-supported websites or self-published books on Amazon.

01:01.180 --> 01:03.500
One such fellow, arguably the most popular, is

01:03.500 --> 01:04.780
Dariush Felizadeh,

01:04.780 --> 01:10.060
who calls himself Roush V because he knows most of his readership has trouble spelling and pronouncing difficult words.

01:10.060 --> 01:14.460
He's written a whole bunch of books on pickup artistry and how to do it in various specific countries,

01:14.460 --> 01:18.540
which you can buy on Amazon or his shady-ass Web 2.0-looking website.

01:18.540 --> 01:20.460
You know, if there's one thing I just love doing,

01:20.460 --> 01:24.460
it's paying other men to tell me what they think women think about stuff.

01:25.940 --> 01:28.940
That's way more mature than asking them.

01:30.940 --> 01:32.940
Let's read some of his breakout book!

01:32.940 --> 01:33.940
Bang!

01:33.940 --> 01:34.940
Shall we?

01:36.940 --> 01:39.460
Why am I putting it in my mouth? That's stupid.

01:39.460 --> 01:42.460
Never tell a girl that she's beautiful or hot,

01:42.460 --> 01:46.460
because what that does is increase her value relative to yours.

01:46.460 --> 01:48.460
Not complimenting will help you,

01:48.460 --> 01:51.460
because you're withholding a reward that all women want,

01:51.460 --> 01:53.460
one that they will stick around waiting for.

01:53.980 --> 01:57.980
Do not discuss your feelings of emotion or attraction for her.

01:57.980 --> 02:02.980
Never tell a girl you like her or feel something for her.

02:02.980 --> 02:06.460
Only in movies will discussing your feelings ever get

02:06.460 --> 02:07.980
THE DESIRABLE FEMALE.

02:07.980 --> 02:10.460
We use indirect game without compliments,

02:10.460 --> 02:12.980
where she's never completely sure about her feelings for her.

02:12.980 --> 02:14.460
You're not hiding anything.

02:14.460 --> 02:17.980
You're just being mysterious.

02:17.980 --> 02:20.460
I am Roush V, lord of mysteries.

02:20.460 --> 02:25.460
It is an act whereby a man inserts a rod-shaped mass of tissue

02:25.460 --> 02:30.460
into a woman's lubricated cavity, also made of tissue.

02:30.460 --> 02:34.460
Don't be too concerned with sexual technique.

02:34.460 --> 02:36.460
Porn is my teacher.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.460
A man rubs his rod in and out,

02:38.460 --> 02:43.460
stimulating pleasure receptors until his brain decides on the right time

02:43.460 --> 02:45.460
to eject a genetic package.

02:45.460 --> 02:48.460
Since sex is supposed to be fun,

02:48.460 --> 02:52.460
don't take it too seriously by questioning whether you're doing things right.

02:52.460 --> 02:56.460
Worrying about her pleasure sacrifices your own.

02:56.460 --> 03:01.460
Pump slowly, getting slightly farther in with each pump until...

03:01.460 --> 03:07.460
HE LAUGHS

03:07.460 --> 03:10.460
Congratulate yourself on the notch.

03:10.460 --> 03:13.460
HE CHUCKLES

03:13.460 --> 03:14.460
That's gross.

03:14.460 --> 03:17.460
Oh, it's getting hot and sexy in here, isn't it?

03:17.460 --> 03:20.460
Coming down with a case of the fucking vapors!

03:20.460 --> 03:24.460
Now, I could go into detail about every single strategy in this book

03:24.460 --> 03:28.460
and how it reveals a deeply unsettling inability to empathize with women as human beings

03:28.460 --> 03:30.460
and how most of it doesn't actually work.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.460
In fact, that's why this video took so long to make.

03:32.460 --> 03:34.460
Initially, it was gonna be about every single thing in the book,

03:34.460 --> 03:37.460
but what I actually find is really funny

03:37.460 --> 03:40.460
is that Roush agrees with me about how poorly it works.

03:40.460 --> 03:44.460
The most telling piece of advice in the book is actually its simplest.

03:44.460 --> 03:46.460
Be prepared for a lot of disappointment.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.460
Most phone numbers will go nowhere.

03:49.460 --> 03:54.460
You're doing incredible if half the numbers you get result in a first date.

03:54.460 --> 03:56.460
Even when your game gets really good,

03:56.460 --> 04:00.460
you will still get rejected and have prospects that don't convert.

04:00.460 --> 04:05.460
On your 100th approach, there will be the experience of 99 previous approaches at your back

04:05.460 --> 04:07.460
helping you succeed.

04:07.460 --> 04:10.460
This is why it is better to be the man that tries and fails

04:10.460 --> 04:12.460
than one who does not try at all.

04:12.460 --> 04:15.460
Now, on a certain level, yeah, dating is easier for you

04:15.460 --> 04:18.460
because of how you approach it if you accept that not everyone will accept you

04:18.460 --> 04:21.460
and no set of tactics will work on 100% of women.

04:21.460 --> 04:24.460
But combined with the rest of this fucking shitty nonsense advice,

04:24.460 --> 04:26.460
it's an admission of failure.

04:26.460 --> 04:29.460
If I wrote a guide on how to succeed at Dota

04:29.460 --> 04:31.460
and the first chapter started with,

04:31.460 --> 04:34.460
get used to disappointment, following these tips you'll only actually win

04:34.460 --> 04:36.460
one in a hundred times,

04:36.460 --> 04:38.460
you'd want your fucking money back, wouldn't you?

04:38.460 --> 04:42.460
This puts something of a dent in the idea that pickup artistry actually works, doesn't it?

04:42.460 --> 04:46.460
It only looks like it works because it tells you to try it hundreds of times,

04:46.460 --> 04:50.460
so people who are utterly committed to it will probably eventually see some results.

04:50.460 --> 04:52.460
Does that actually mean it works, though?

04:52.460 --> 04:57.460
I know I'm arguing semantics here, but if you roll six dice hundreds of times,

04:57.460 --> 04:59.460
you'll eventually land all sixes,

04:59.460 --> 05:02.460
but that doesn't mean I've taught you how to be a dice roll artist, does it?

05:02.460 --> 05:04.460
It just goes on like that.

05:04.460 --> 05:07.460
Honestly, I've read as many of the books that I could get a hold of

05:07.460 --> 05:09.460
for less than asking price,

05:09.460 --> 05:12.460
and they're basically the same book over and over again.

05:12.460 --> 05:14.460
But I gotta give Roosh some credit, though.

05:14.460 --> 05:19.460
First of all, he sold the same book in, like, 15 different forms to the same people,

05:19.460 --> 05:22.460
but he's also very good at constructing sentences

05:22.460 --> 05:24.460
that sound deep and introspective and original,

05:24.460 --> 05:28.460
but if you think about them for more than, like, 1.2 seconds,

05:28.460 --> 05:31.460
you realize that they're nonsense.

05:31.460 --> 05:33.460
They're actually less than nothing sometimes.

05:33.460 --> 05:36.460
Take, for example, this section from Bang Ukraine.

05:36.460 --> 05:38.460
Ukraine is what I call a paint-over culture.

05:38.460 --> 05:42.460
Ukrainians don't try to fix problems, they paint over them instead.

05:42.460 --> 05:44.460
The women do this with their excessive use of makeup,

05:44.460 --> 05:47.460
fake eyebrows, and fake eyelashes.

05:47.460 --> 05:49.460
A fat Ukrainian man who looks like Jabba the Hutt

05:49.460 --> 05:52.460
will paint over himself with a Mercedes-Benz.

05:52.460 --> 05:55.460
Ukrainians look for quick fixes and shortcuts

05:55.460 --> 05:58.460
to give them the appearance of beauty or success.

05:58.460 --> 06:02.460
Roosh has invented an entirely new sociological term

06:02.460 --> 06:07.460
to describe the new phenomenon of women wearing fake eyelashes

06:07.460 --> 06:11.460
and men compensating for things by buying nice cars.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.460
Only in Ukraine, am I right?

06:15.460 --> 06:17.460
Roosh's books are full of Barnum statements like this,

06:17.460 --> 06:20.460
where he pretends he's come up with something unique to that culture

06:20.460 --> 06:22.460
when, in fact, he's saying the same thing again,

06:22.460 --> 06:25.460
but he's come up with a different pithy way of saying it.

06:25.460 --> 06:30.460
He's basically writing horoscopes, but for desperate and lonely people.

06:30.460 --> 06:33.460
He's basically writing horoscopes.

06:33.460 --> 06:35.460
And if you're not the biggest fan of reading books,

06:35.460 --> 06:39.460
Roosh has also brought his masterful understanding of sociology to YouTube,

06:39.460 --> 06:42.460
where you can find him explaining how to approach women in bars...

06:43.460 --> 06:44.460
using...

06:44.460 --> 06:47.460
What you gotta do, it doesn't get easier than this.

06:47.460 --> 06:51.460
Just stand next to the girl that you want to talk to,

06:51.460 --> 06:54.460
wait until she gets... she gets her drink,

06:54.460 --> 06:58.460
then tap her on the shoulder with your hand three times

06:58.460 --> 07:00.460
after the transaction is complete,

07:00.460 --> 07:02.460
and then deliver your opening line.

07:02.460 --> 07:04.460
I have to... I...

07:04.460 --> 07:08.460
Look, I wanted this video to feature some of Roosh's best arguments

07:08.460 --> 07:13.460
so I could actually debunk them and explain why the ideas were wrong,

07:13.460 --> 07:15.460
but...

07:15.460 --> 07:19.460
this is a video of a 37-year-old man

07:19.460 --> 07:23.460
using Lego to explain how to approach women.

07:23.460 --> 07:25.460
It debunks itself.

07:25.460 --> 07:27.460
Through words, it's hard to explain,

07:27.460 --> 07:30.460
so what I did is I went to the toy store and I bought some dolls.

07:30.460 --> 07:32.460
I... I'm out of a fucking job now.

07:32.460 --> 07:36.460
These people are too stupid to even bother ridiculing.

07:36.460 --> 07:38.460
I'm done. I quit. See ya.

07:41.460 --> 07:43.460
Ah, fuck it. Ah, fine, fine, whatever.

07:43.460 --> 07:45.460
He might be easy prey,

07:45.460 --> 07:48.460
but let's at least make fun of his audience and website while we're at it.

07:48.460 --> 07:49.460
Why not?

07:49.460 --> 07:51.460
In addition to creating Return of Kings,

07:51.460 --> 07:54.460
a website which oscillates between advice for picking up sluts

07:54.460 --> 07:57.460
and getting angry that people settle for used women...

07:57.460 --> 08:01.460
I'm beginning to think that these guys have an internally contradicting ideology,

08:01.460 --> 08:03.460
but that might just be me.

08:03.460 --> 08:06.460
He also runs Rouge V Forum, a small personal army of customer...

08:06.460 --> 08:08.460
sorry, definite real friends he likes

08:08.460 --> 08:10.460
that at one point he tried to get to assemble

08:10.460 --> 08:12.460
in various locations throughout the world

08:12.460 --> 08:14.460
for some kind of mass demonstration.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.460
He is prominent and, I'm gonna be honest,

08:16.460 --> 08:18.460
just better YouTuber Dan Olson

08:18.460 --> 08:20.460
with a story about one of the meetups he infiltrated.

08:20.460 --> 08:23.460
Okay, so back in January 2016,

08:23.460 --> 08:25.460
confessed rapist Rouge V starts planning

08:25.460 --> 08:28.460
this global semi-simultaneous meetup of fans

08:29.460 --> 08:32.460
to, like, discuss what it means to be their myopic,

08:32.460 --> 08:34.460
atrophied idea of a real man

08:34.460 --> 08:37.460
and generally just, you know, complain about women.

08:37.460 --> 08:40.460
Now, they do most of this planning just in public forums,

08:40.460 --> 08:43.460
which, you know, usually for a meetup is fine.

08:43.460 --> 08:46.460
No one cares about your little fan club meeting.

08:46.460 --> 08:48.460
Unless you're a rapist who runs a rape blog

08:48.460 --> 08:50.460
that teaches other men how to rape,

08:50.460 --> 08:53.460
in which case you're probably gonna get some pushback.

08:53.460 --> 08:55.460
So things get kinda heated.

08:55.460 --> 08:57.460
Mostly on social media,

08:57.460 --> 08:59.460
and Rouge goes and locks down his forum

08:59.460 --> 09:01.460
and starts changing all of the plans,

09:01.460 --> 09:05.460
and it just gets gonzo so fast.

09:05.460 --> 09:06.460
Like, not just,

09:06.460 --> 09:08.460
hey, take it to a private conversation.

09:08.460 --> 09:10.460
They start immediately building, like,

09:10.460 --> 09:14.460
three, four layers of bad spy thriller nonsense

09:14.460 --> 09:15.460
into the whole thing.

09:15.460 --> 09:17.460
Now, I'd already had an undercover account

09:17.460 --> 09:18.460
on his forums for a while,

09:18.460 --> 09:20.460
so I can just see all of this.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.460
And the local meetup,

09:22.460 --> 09:25.460
they wanted me to prove my loyalty

09:25.460 --> 09:27.460
before they told me the meetup location

09:27.460 --> 09:30.460
by sending a screencap of an Amazon receipt

09:30.460 --> 09:33.460
for one of Rouge's books.

09:33.460 --> 09:34.460
Okay.

09:34.460 --> 09:36.460
So the next stage is

09:36.460 --> 09:39.460
everyone's going to meet up at one location at 7.30,

09:39.460 --> 09:43.460
then move to the actual location at 7.40.

09:43.460 --> 09:45.460
So there's only a 10-minute window

09:45.460 --> 09:48.460
to actually, like, meet up with the rest of the people.

09:48.460 --> 09:51.460
And now, how do you know you're meeting the right people?

09:51.460 --> 09:52.460
Well, you walk up to them,

09:52.460 --> 09:53.460
and the code phrase,

09:53.460 --> 09:55.460
the code phrase you ask them is,

09:55.460 --> 09:56.460
is this the place?

09:56.460 --> 09:58.460
And the countersign is,

09:58.460 --> 10:01.460
yes, but only because of the cancellation.

10:01.460 --> 10:04.460
Quote, any other answer or hesitation,

10:04.460 --> 10:06.460
and you'll know they're just a bystander.

10:06.460 --> 10:08.460
Oh, they also reminded everyone

10:08.460 --> 10:11.460
that you probably shouldn't bring any weapons to this event,

10:11.460 --> 10:12.460
that they're totally insisting

10:12.460 --> 10:15.460
it's just some dudes getting together

10:15.460 --> 10:16.460
to be dudes together.

10:16.460 --> 10:19.460
So anyway, I jump through all of these hoops.

10:19.460 --> 10:20.460
The evening comes.

10:20.460 --> 10:22.460
I go to the first meeting spot,

10:22.460 --> 10:26.460
and now, this is early February in Calgary at night.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.460
It is so cold out.

10:30.460 --> 10:31.460
But any which way,

10:31.460 --> 10:34.460
I hang around for a good 20, almost 30 minutes,

10:34.460 --> 10:36.460
and no one asks me if this is the place.

10:36.460 --> 10:37.460
No one else shows up.

10:37.460 --> 10:39.460
No one else lurks around

10:39.460 --> 10:42.460
like they're too shy to ask complete strangers

10:42.460 --> 10:43.460
some code word.

10:43.460 --> 10:44.460
Nothing.

10:44.460 --> 10:46.460
So I check my email real quick,

10:46.460 --> 10:47.460
just to be sure,

10:47.460 --> 10:51.460
and there's this whole string of emails

10:51.460 --> 10:55.460
that had come while I was traveling there and waiting.

10:55.460 --> 10:57.460
So all these last-minute emails

10:57.460 --> 10:58.460
where people are like,

10:58.460 --> 11:01.460
Hey guys, it's really cold out,

11:01.460 --> 11:03.460
and I'm tired from work,

11:03.460 --> 11:05.460
so have fun without me.

11:07.460 --> 11:08.460
So that's it.

11:08.460 --> 11:09.460
I'm the entire meetup

11:09.460 --> 11:11.460
for the Calgary chapter of Return of Kings.

11:11.460 --> 11:13.460
The Calgary chapter of Return of Kings

11:13.460 --> 11:17.460
has a 100% SJW saturation rate.

11:17.460 --> 11:20.460
It is intensely compromised.

11:21.460 --> 11:23.460
And as the reigning king of that meetup,

11:23.460 --> 11:25.460
I decide, you know what?

11:25.460 --> 11:28.460
Let's move this totally-not-betacuck meeting

11:28.460 --> 11:30.460
to Fatburger.

11:30.460 --> 11:32.460
So I went to Fatburger,

11:32.460 --> 11:34.460
and it was delicious.

11:38.460 --> 11:41.460
His books also contain a shit ton of alpha-praising nonsense.

11:41.460 --> 11:43.460
You know, the stuff based on a debunked study

11:43.460 --> 11:45.460
we covered in the Golden One video?

11:45.460 --> 11:47.460
Beta males have a serious problem

11:47.460 --> 11:49.460
with telling their lady friends

11:49.460 --> 11:51.460
that they like them.

11:51.460 --> 11:55.460
Pick-up artistry and alpha-masculinity-praising ideology

11:55.460 --> 11:57.460
don't so much go hand-in-hand

11:57.460 --> 12:00.460
as they're the same two hands shaking each other

12:00.460 --> 12:02.460
belonging to the same man

12:02.460 --> 12:03.460
because they're the same.

12:03.460 --> 12:06.460
I'm yet to find someone who thinks pick-up artistry is great

12:06.460 --> 12:09.460
but doesn't praise all the other ridiculous bullshit.

12:09.460 --> 12:11.460
These things kind of have to go together.

12:11.460 --> 12:15.460
Heck, the Golden One has plenty of videos about dating.

12:15.460 --> 12:17.460
In fact, that's what gave me the idea to do this one.

12:17.460 --> 12:18.460
Remember this part of the video?

12:18.460 --> 12:20.460
If I ever need any dating advice,

12:20.460 --> 12:22.460
and what are the odds of that,

12:22.460 --> 12:23.460
I'll look you up.

12:23.460 --> 12:25.460
Yeah, well, uh,

12:25.460 --> 12:28.460
that was a setup for this video.

12:28.460 --> 12:32.460
Welcome to the Hbomberguy Expanded Universe.

12:32.460 --> 12:35.460
It's a book that triumphs being an alpha

12:35.460 --> 12:36.460
with phrases like,

12:36.460 --> 12:39.460
the alpha male does not care about what other people think of him,

12:39.460 --> 12:42.460
written in a book which dedicates over 100 pages

12:42.460 --> 12:45.460
to trying to make yourself look better than you actually are

12:45.460 --> 12:47.460
so people will think more highly of you,

12:47.460 --> 12:49.460
which it also admits doesn't work most of the time.

12:49.460 --> 12:53.460
In a frankly stunning display of a monumental lack of self-awareness,

12:53.460 --> 12:56.460
when describing what he feels as important alpha traits,

12:56.460 --> 12:57.460
he writes,

12:57.460 --> 13:00.460
The alpha male lives in his own reality.

13:00.460 --> 13:03.460
Criticizing this behavior will probably net the criticism

13:03.460 --> 13:05.460
from true believers that I'm some kind of baiter

13:05.460 --> 13:09.460
who can't understand it or is too afraid of their desires

13:09.460 --> 13:12.460
and the deep truths contained within this twerpish prose.

13:12.460 --> 13:16.460
But ironically, I actually don't care what idiots think.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.460
I'm the real alpha, basically.

13:18.460 --> 13:21.460
It's me. I'm the good guy now. It's me.

13:21.460 --> 13:23.460
Roosh has even invented his own particular version

13:23.460 --> 13:26.460
of fake masculinity-praising ideology,

13:26.460 --> 13:28.460
calling it neo-masculinity.

13:28.460 --> 13:31.460
He prides it as a stunning return to the ancient periods

13:31.460 --> 13:33.460
when men were real men like in these statues,

13:33.460 --> 13:36.460
but because he hasn't read what those times were actually like

13:36.460 --> 13:39.460
because he was too busy writing Barnum statements about Ukraine,

13:39.460 --> 13:42.460
spoilers, they were really gay,

13:42.460 --> 13:44.460
a thing neo-masculinity explicitly rejects,

13:44.460 --> 13:48.460
he's really preaching a return to an imaginary time period

13:48.460 --> 13:50.460
he made up in his mind.

13:50.460 --> 13:54.460
In reality, idolizing a non-existent prelapsarian point in history

13:54.460 --> 13:57.460
is like wanting to return to the Garden of Eden or the womb.

13:57.460 --> 14:00.460
It's a pathology for only the saddest.

14:01.460 --> 14:05.460
Okay, I wanted to do a thing where I remade one of Roosh's videos

14:05.460 --> 14:07.460
with Lego and then made fun of it,

14:07.460 --> 14:10.460
but this was literally all the Lego I could find.

14:10.460 --> 14:12.460
This lady with the parish shirt and this beauty salon,

14:12.460 --> 14:16.460
and there's like a giant toy lion that I still have for some reason,

14:16.460 --> 14:20.460
but I threw out all my Legos when I became an adult,

14:20.460 --> 14:22.460
so I can't really do this bit.

14:22.460 --> 14:26.460
In a BBC3 documentary, Reggie Yates goes to one of Roosh's talks,

14:26.460 --> 14:28.460
and in a small enclosed room,

14:28.460 --> 14:31.460
Roosh outlines not the reasons why his philosophy works

14:31.460 --> 14:33.460
and spreading tips for male self-improvement

14:33.460 --> 14:36.460
or even more tips on how to pick up women.

14:36.460 --> 14:38.460
Instead, we're treated to what I like to call

14:39.460 --> 14:43.460
Offerings not of reasons why his way works or is successful,

14:43.460 --> 14:46.460
but excuses for why it isn't.

14:46.460 --> 14:51.460
Women are no longer trained to submit to a man, to serve a man.

14:51.460 --> 14:55.460
Women are being applauded and encouraged

14:55.460 --> 14:59.460
to look like fat, outer space cyborgs.

14:59.460 --> 15:04.460
Women and gays are seen as superior to straight men.

15:04.460 --> 15:08.460
Anything that a woman or a gay person wants is theirs,

15:08.460 --> 15:12.460
but anything you want, sorry, we cannot help you.

15:12.460 --> 15:15.460
Mainstream feminism is trying to destroy him.

15:15.460 --> 15:17.460
Straight male people aren't being served

15:17.460 --> 15:20.460
and aren't allowed to have their desires anymore.

15:20.460 --> 15:23.460
The media lies and so on.

15:23.460 --> 15:27.460
Social justice warriors and the feminists that are aligned with them

15:27.460 --> 15:28.460
are like a virus.

15:28.460 --> 15:33.460
They try to infect every platform, every group, every topic,

15:33.460 --> 15:37.460
every niche to silence any kind of thought that they don't like.

15:37.460 --> 15:40.460
We recently saw this with GamerGate.

15:40.460 --> 15:44.460
The bedrock of this school of thought is fundamentally broken.

15:44.460 --> 15:48.460
It's a worldview designed not to explain how to be a winner,

15:48.460 --> 15:51.460
but to explain why you're a loser.

15:51.460 --> 15:54.460
And don't worry, it's not because your ideas don't work.

15:54.460 --> 15:57.460
It's not because you have a reductive view of women

15:57.460 --> 15:59.460
and actively pursue not understanding them.

15:59.460 --> 16:02.460
It's because women are too powerful.

16:02.460 --> 16:04.460
And here, in this tiny basement,

16:04.460 --> 16:07.460
we're gonna put them to rights by you paying me

16:07.460 --> 16:09.460
to tell you you were right all along.

16:09.460 --> 16:12.460
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to put Roosh's version of pick-up artistry

16:12.460 --> 16:15.460
in the maybe pile for now.

16:16.460 --> 16:17.460
So, who's next?

16:17.460 --> 16:20.460
Well, there's Matt Forney of mattforney.com,

16:20.460 --> 16:23.460
whose avatar looks as little like Matt Forney as it could possibly be.

16:23.460 --> 16:27.460
I'm seeing a happy, jovial fellow with perfectly sculpted facial hair.

16:27.460 --> 16:30.460
You might want to get your money back from whoever you hired, mate.

16:30.460 --> 16:33.460
They really didn't capture the bewildered sadness very well.

16:33.460 --> 16:37.460
Much like Roosh, in fact, almost as if he's trying to be Roosh.

16:37.460 --> 16:40.460
He has his own website with his articles

16:40.460 --> 16:43.460
and another really crappy-looking place where he sells his books.

16:43.460 --> 16:46.460
But at least for him, pick-up artistry is just a side gig.

16:46.460 --> 16:48.460
He just sells DO THE PHILIPPINES,

16:48.460 --> 16:51.460
a title weirdly close in name to Roosh's books.

16:51.460 --> 16:52.460
That's an odd similarity.

16:52.460 --> 16:54.460
Wait. Hang on.

16:54.460 --> 16:58.460
Almost the entire ad copy is borrowed in style and substance from Roosh's books.

16:58.460 --> 17:00.460
Even the risk-free thing is simi...

17:01.460 --> 17:03.460
This whole thing's a racket, isn't it?

17:03.460 --> 17:05.460
They're just ripping off each other at this point.

17:05.460 --> 17:09.460
I don't know about you, but I expected much more integrity and intellectual rigor

17:09.460 --> 17:11.460
from the seduction community.

17:11.460 --> 17:13.460
So it's like a game. You guys are writing the same thing.

17:13.460 --> 17:16.460
Oh, look, and he got a bunch of totally-not-his-friends

17:16.460 --> 17:18.460
to write recommendations for the book.

17:18.460 --> 17:20.460
It's clear to me, reading this book,

17:20.460 --> 17:24.460
that Matt Forney fell in love with the Philippines and her women

17:24.460 --> 17:28.460
and that he wishes they find love with men who will love them.

17:28.460 --> 17:32.460
Yeah, there must be a lot of love in Matt Forney's heart

17:32.460 --> 17:34.460
for women, for them to find love,

17:34.460 --> 17:38.460
and also a love for the financial success of Roosh's books.

17:38.460 --> 17:40.460
To exacerbate that sense of love

17:40.460 --> 17:45.460
that Matt Forney simply excretes from every orifice like a sexy puss,

17:45.460 --> 17:47.460
let's read from one of his advice articles,

17:47.460 --> 17:48.460
entitled,

17:48.460 --> 17:51.460
How to Crush a Girl's Self-Esteem.

17:51.460 --> 17:53.460
Can you feel the fucking love yet?!

17:53.460 --> 17:56.460
Merely banging a girl isn't enough for a man.

17:56.460 --> 18:01.460
He needs to possess her very being to be satisfied.

18:02.460 --> 18:03.460
It's a policy.

18:07.460 --> 18:12.460
Any ladies out there want to have their very beings possessed?

18:12.460 --> 18:16.460
One, constantly make her feel inadequate.

18:16.460 --> 18:19.460
You should rarely give her unqualified praise.

18:19.460 --> 18:21.460
Every time she does something for you,

18:21.460 --> 18:25.460
find out what she did wrong and remind her of it.

18:25.460 --> 18:28.460
If you can't find any problems, make some up.

18:28.460 --> 18:32.460
Nothing she does can ever be good enough for you.

18:32.460 --> 18:34.460
I felt slimy saying that one.

18:34.460 --> 18:40.460
This is how you can crush her self-image and own her mind, body, and soul.

18:40.460 --> 18:42.460
Oh my God, what a wonderfully positive article.

18:42.460 --> 18:45.460
Matt finally admits women have souls.

18:45.460 --> 18:47.460
Matt then goes on to describe a situation in which

18:47.460 --> 18:50.460
being a bad boyfriend and insulting his girlfriend

18:50.460 --> 18:52.460
stopped her from eating what she wanted at lunch.

18:52.460 --> 18:54.460
Matt is currently single.

18:54.460 --> 18:57.460
Somehow, I'm sure it's feminism's fault.

18:57.460 --> 18:58.460
Oh, another article of his.

18:58.460 --> 19:01.460
No head, please. I'm female.

19:01.460 --> 19:03.460
Oh, boy.

19:03.460 --> 19:05.460
Whenever my husband goes down on me,

19:05.460 --> 19:08.460
I just get frustrated and I end up asking him to stop.

19:08.460 --> 19:11.460
It took me ages to figure out what was wrong.

19:11.460 --> 19:13.460
Cunnilingus is unnatural for women.

19:13.460 --> 19:16.460
It seems that Matt briefly operated a website

19:16.460 --> 19:18.460
called Virginia's Secret Garden,

19:18.460 --> 19:21.460
a website where he pretended to be his ideal woman,

19:21.460 --> 19:24.460
a submissive Christian housewife living in the Midwest.

19:24.460 --> 19:26.460
Not only that, I've come to believe that going down on a girl

19:26.460 --> 19:29.460
upsets the natural order of masculine dominance.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.460
When a man goes down on a woman, the dynamic is flipped.

19:31.460 --> 19:34.460
He's a submissive one and you're the one he's desperate to please.

19:34.460 --> 19:37.460
It's a complete perversion of the natural order.

19:37.460 --> 19:39.460
Using his personal fan fiction as a mouthpiece,

19:39.460 --> 19:42.460
Matt claims that Cunnilingus is unnatural because he,

19:42.460 --> 19:45.460
by which I mean made-up person Virginia Robinson,

19:45.460 --> 19:47.460
doesn't enjoy it.

19:47.460 --> 19:49.460
As much as a man as my husband is,

19:49.460 --> 19:51.460
I can't respect him when he's dragging his tongue

19:51.460 --> 19:53.460
across my nether regions.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.460
Women aren't going to respect you less

19:55.460 --> 19:57.460
if you go down on them, Matt.

19:57.460 --> 20:00.460
It's impossible for women to have any less respect for you

20:00.460 --> 20:02.460
than they already do.

20:02.460 --> 20:04.460
I'm going to say it again

20:04.460 --> 20:07.460
to let it sink in.

20:07.460 --> 20:10.460
Matt Forney is so scared of

20:10.460 --> 20:13.460
or mad about oral sex

20:13.460 --> 20:16.460
that he invented a fake woman

20:16.460 --> 20:18.460
to tell him it's okay

20:18.460 --> 20:21.460
and that she never liked it anyway.

20:25.460 --> 20:27.460
That sounds like a compelling argument.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.460
Which brings us to the oddest thing

20:29.460 --> 20:31.460
about the séduction communautaire,

20:31.460 --> 20:34.460
that even the sex isn't fun for anyone involved

20:34.460 --> 20:36.460
once they get around to it.

20:36.460 --> 20:38.460
You have Rouche desperately trying to come up

20:38.460 --> 20:40.460
with a reason to want to have sex,

20:40.460 --> 20:42.460
struggling to describe it

20:42.460 --> 20:44.460
in a way that actually sounds fun,

20:44.460 --> 20:47.460
insisting that you just shouldn't worry about technique.

20:47.460 --> 20:49.460
It's just a rod of tissue.

20:49.460 --> 20:51.460
You have the Golden One calling it

20:51.460 --> 20:53.460
a not-especially-pleasing activity

20:53.460 --> 20:55.460
and just a transaction of power.

20:55.460 --> 20:57.460
You have Matt Forney inventing fake women

20:57.460 --> 21:00.460
to explain that sex wasn't supposed to be fun.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.460
And you have this red-pill philosophy bloke,

21:02.460 --> 21:04.460
fellow YouTuber ContraPoints,

21:04.460 --> 21:06.460
pointed out in one of his videos,

21:06.460 --> 21:08.460
to be utterly disgusted by sex as a concept.

21:08.460 --> 21:10.460
"'Cause at the end of the day,

21:10.460 --> 21:12.460
sex, you're gonna be impaling her

21:12.460 --> 21:14.460
with your ugly, engorged penis.

21:14.460 --> 21:16.460
There's nothing pretty about that.

21:16.460 --> 21:18.460
No pretty boy, okay?"

21:18.460 --> 21:20.460
I have a question.

21:20.460 --> 21:22.460
If pleasure doesn't matter

21:22.460 --> 21:24.460
and the person you're sleeping with doesn't matter to you

21:24.460 --> 21:26.460
because you've pursued a worldview

21:26.460 --> 21:28.460
based around thinking so little of them,

21:28.460 --> 21:30.460
what's the fucking point?

21:30.460 --> 21:32.460
The most damning thing about pickup artistry

21:32.460 --> 21:34.460
is that it doesn't work even when it works

21:35.460 --> 21:37.460
Nothing she does can ever be good enough for you.

21:37.460 --> 21:39.460
Roosh claims that his techniques work,

21:39.460 --> 21:41.460
but there is something of a conflict of interest, isn't there?

21:41.460 --> 21:43.460
He's literally trying to sell you books

21:43.460 --> 21:45.460
about the techniques.

21:45.460 --> 21:47.460
Of course he'd say it works,

21:47.460 --> 21:49.460
but assuming that he's not a lying conman

21:49.460 --> 21:51.460
who wants your money,

21:51.460 --> 21:53.460
is it actually making him happy?

21:53.460 --> 21:55.460
I don't think it is.

21:55.460 --> 21:57.460
Pickup artistry is a lifestyle in which you pursue

21:57.460 --> 21:59.460
a happiness that you never arrive at

21:59.460 --> 22:01.460
and hopefully make a little money on the way

22:01.460 --> 22:03.460
conning other people into paying you for your tips

22:03.460 --> 22:05.460
you probably copied from Roosh,

22:05.460 --> 22:07.460
you plagiarist piece of shit!

22:07.460 --> 22:09.460
The Prologue of Bang is a story about how hurt Roosh felt

22:09.460 --> 22:11.460
when he discovered a girl he thought liked him

22:11.460 --> 22:13.460
was dating someone else.

22:13.460 --> 22:15.460
We would study together in groups and I could swear

22:15.460 --> 22:17.460
she was giving me extra attention.

22:17.460 --> 22:19.460
I analysed the situation with my nice guy friends

22:19.460 --> 22:21.460
and we all concluded that she did like me

22:21.460 --> 22:23.460
as more than a friend.

22:23.460 --> 22:25.460
After a couple of weeks of hesitation,

22:25.460 --> 22:27.460
I finally asked her out on a casual date to the movies.

22:27.460 --> 22:29.460
She said she couldn't because she was very busy.

22:29.460 --> 22:31.460
Weeks later, I'd see her on campus

22:31.460 --> 22:33.460
holding hands with another guy.

22:33.460 --> 22:35.460
Instead of listening to the lame

22:37.460 --> 22:39.460
love songs like I usually did

22:39.460 --> 22:41.460
for the first time I got angry.

22:41.460 --> 22:43.460
A lifetime of frustration and not getting what I wanted

22:43.460 --> 22:45.460
became focused on this one girl.

22:45.460 --> 22:47.460
I was bitter that I, a nice guy,

22:47.460 --> 22:49.460
was getting passed over for guys who I thought were losers.

22:49.460 --> 22:51.460
If I did end up talking to her,

22:51.460 --> 22:53.460
I would cut our conversation short.

22:53.460 --> 22:55.460
When she would ask me to study, I'd lie

22:55.460 --> 22:57.460
and say I was studying alone,

22:57.460 --> 22:59.460
only for her to find my study group late at night in the library.

22:59.460 --> 23:01.460
I started feeling good for treating her poorly.

23:01.460 --> 23:03.460
I hated her and everything that she stood for,

23:03.460 --> 23:05.460
which was my failure amidst women.

23:05.460 --> 23:07.460
Roosh then details that

23:07.460 --> 23:09.460
after doing this, he discovered she was

23:09.460 --> 23:11.460
trying harder to be his friend.

23:11.460 --> 23:13.460
He puts this down to girls secretly wanting bad boys

23:13.460 --> 23:15.460
when an outside observer can see

23:15.460 --> 23:17.460
it might be because she really did like him as a friend

23:17.460 --> 23:19.460
and tried to continue it

23:19.460 --> 23:21.460
even though she had a boyfriend.

23:21.460 --> 23:23.460
The story then abruptly cuts off and goes into

23:23.460 --> 23:25.460
a more general story about the power of being

23:25.460 --> 23:27.460
mad at women. Presumably this is because

23:27.460 --> 23:29.460
not only did this behavior never get him

23:29.460 --> 23:31.460
the girl, but she probably

23:31.460 --> 23:33.460
eventually gave up on their friendship and moved on

23:33.460 --> 23:35.460
with her life, and he doesn't want to

23:35.460 --> 23:37.460
mention that bit. His very first

23:37.460 --> 23:39.460
story about the success of his techniques

23:39.460 --> 23:41.460
is a story about a friend

23:41.460 --> 23:43.460
he pushed away because he was disappointed

23:43.460 --> 23:45.460
he didn't get to fuck her.

23:45.460 --> 23:47.460
He insists he used to be the stereotypical

23:47.460 --> 23:49.460
nice guy, but it sounds like

23:49.460 --> 23:51.460
he never really had any respect

23:51.460 --> 23:53.460
for that person in the first place.

23:53.460 --> 23:55.460
Pick-up artists call it game, and the name

23:55.460 --> 23:57.460
comes from a particular non-fiction book called

23:57.460 --> 23:59.460
The Game, penetrating the secret

23:59.460 --> 24:01.460
society of pick-up artists. Oh, do you get it?

24:01.460 --> 24:03.460
The author, journalist Neil Strauss,

24:03.460 --> 24:05.460
initially saw success and

24:05.460 --> 24:07.460
gained friendships with other sad little

24:07.460 --> 24:09.460
boy men who idolize having the power to do

24:09.460 --> 24:11.460
something they don't really like with women they don't

24:11.460 --> 24:13.460
enjoy being with, and all of them

24:13.460 --> 24:15.460
had cute little assumed names like

24:15.460 --> 24:17.460
Mystery, Style,

24:17.460 --> 24:19.460
Herbal, Playboy,

24:19.460 --> 24:21.460
and of course Tyler Durden

24:21.460 --> 24:23.460
because why wouldn't these people

24:23.460 --> 24:25.460
identify as the deranged manifestation

24:25.460 --> 24:27.460
of masculinity-worshipping ideology?

24:27.460 --> 24:29.460
Spoilers, eventually Strauss'

24:29.460 --> 24:31.460
relationships with the friends he made collapsed.

24:31.460 --> 24:33.460
It turns out these people are emotionally

24:33.460 --> 24:35.460
unstable. Who'd have thought?

24:35.460 --> 24:37.460
And then he concludes that pick-up artistry is for

24:37.460 --> 24:39.460
losers and attempts to rebuild his life.

24:39.460 --> 24:41.460
I felt a little bad outright dismissing

24:41.460 --> 24:43.460
this stuff as for losers just before,

24:43.460 --> 24:45.460
but here's Neil Strauss,

24:45.460 --> 24:47.460
the most prominent figure

24:47.460 --> 24:49.460
to ever emerge from the

24:49.460 --> 24:51.460
seduction community, saying it

24:51.460 --> 24:53.460
himself. Ten years after

24:53.460 --> 24:55.460
publishing The Game, Strauss put out a

24:55.460 --> 24:57.460
book called The Truth, an uncomfortable

24:57.460 --> 24:59.460
book about relationships.

24:59.460 --> 25:01.460
Its provisional title was Game Over, or

25:01.460 --> 25:03.460
as I like to call it, The Game Part Two

25:03.460 --> 25:05.460
Guess What? Still Depressed.

25:05.460 --> 25:07.460
The Truth is the opposite of The Game

25:07.460 --> 25:09.460
in every way, even down to its

25:09.460 --> 25:11.460
cover. It details Strauss trying to

25:11.460 --> 25:13.460
put his life back together and have an actual rewarding

25:13.460 --> 25:15.460
long-term relationship with another human

25:15.460 --> 25:17.460
being. The guy's attempts to emotionally

25:17.460 --> 25:19.460
recover and see people as people are

25:19.460 --> 25:21.460
kind of commendable, and I hope the people

25:21.460 --> 25:23.460
who desperately follow his earlier advice

25:23.460 --> 25:25.460
also eventually experience the same

25:25.460 --> 25:27.460
development. It would be nice if these

25:27.460 --> 25:29.460
sad people stopped ruining their lives

25:29.460 --> 25:31.460
and maybe helped others do the same,

25:31.460 --> 25:33.460
but that might mean giving up on their

25:33.460 --> 25:35.460
source of income, and in this economy,

25:35.460 --> 25:37.460
pfft!

25:37.460 --> 25:39.460
Thank you all very much for watching,

25:39.460 --> 25:41.460
and also for being so patient with me.

25:41.460 --> 25:43.460
This video took a really long time to make.

25:43.460 --> 25:45.460
It turns out that doing tons of research

25:45.460 --> 25:47.460
and reading a bunch of books actually

25:47.460 --> 25:49.460
is really time-consuming.

25:49.460 --> 25:51.460
So I hope you enjoyed this video,

25:51.460 --> 25:53.460
and I'll see you next time.

25:53.460 --> 25:55.460
Bye!

26:07.460 --> 26:09.460
In any case, in addition to the names

26:09.460 --> 26:11.460
scrolling past the screen right now, I'd especially

26:11.460 --> 26:13.460
like to thank...

26:37.460 --> 26:39.460
I hope that's right.

27:07.460 --> 27:09.460
Knuckles the echidna in a pair of huge googly eyes

27:09.460 --> 27:11.460

chain-smoking Mickey Mouse, I am just

a regular woman who hates Conilingus!

29:01.460 --> 29:03.460
Ha ha! That's terrible, don't

29:03.460 --> 29:05.460
use that. I mean, use it if you want to, but

29:05.460 --> 29:07.460
it's terrible. Let me try it again.

29:07.460 --> 29:09.460
Ow! Fuck!

29:09.460 --> 29:11.460
Just bashed my fucking arm against the tripod

29:11.460 --> 29:13.460
trying to make this thing work.
