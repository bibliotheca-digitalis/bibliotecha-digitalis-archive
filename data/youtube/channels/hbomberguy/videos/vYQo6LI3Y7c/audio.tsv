0	6180	You know, recently on the internet, I've seen a lot of people complaining about something
6180	10300	called cultural marxism.
10300	12740	From the sounds of things, it's a really big deal.
12740	14780	I have some trouble understanding what they mean, though.
14780	19220	When I look the phrase up on Wikipedia, it redirects to a subheading in an article about
19220	24620	the Frankfurt School and calls it a conspiracy theory about Marxists trying to destroy Western
24620	25620	culture.
25620	28260	But maybe we shouldn't trust Wikipedia.
28260	33740	I mean, it's an online encyclopedia that anyone can edit, and we can't trust anyone.
33740	37260	Some of them might be cultural Marxists trying to deny their conspiracy.
37260	42540	Let's take to YouTube.com to discover what's really going on.
42540	48620	Of course, there is always the slight possibility that the internet is full of crazy people,
48620	53980	and I recorded this video at the end of the rest of the stuff that I'm about to show
53980	58020	you, so I actually know, yeah, that is actually the case.
58060	61140	But regardless, maybe we can have some fun and learn something anyway.
61140	66100	So, grab yourself a mug of your favourite substance, unlock all the cells in your high-risk
66100	68900	mind prison, and have yourself a laugh riot.
68900	69900	Ha ha!
69900	70900	Ha ha!
70900	71900	Ha ha!
71900	72900	Ha ha!
72900	73900	Ha ha!
73900	74900	Ha ha!
74900	75900	Ha ha!
75900	77700	Okay, here's our first video, and that's a really unfortunate first frame.
77700	80300	I'd better hit play before I prejudge him.
80300	82500	What is a cultural Marxist?
82500	88020	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
88020	90420	That's something I do for a joke!
90420	91420	That's something I did!
91420	92420	I did that!
92420	93420	In a video!
93420	94420	Oh my god!
94420	95420	Is this a parody?
95420	96420	Oh, it's not.
96420	97420	He means it.
97420	98420	Oh, no, this is real.
98420	99420	Rocking Mr. E.
99420	112420	Marx is cited as one of the major founders of the social sciences, and as such, he's
112420	113420	a Marxist.
113420	129980	Wait, so feminism, gender studies, and post-modernism are all Marxist too?
129980	133100	Everything this guy doesn't like, agree with, or understand is all manufactured by
133100	134100	one guy.
134100	135100	How convenient!
135100	140380	There's still people out there that believe in Western values, and the entire aim of cultural
140380	145740	Marxism is to soften this up enough to transform the culture from the inside.
145740	150680	So it's essential that the opposition is either ridiculed or discredited.
150680	157580	So in other words, criticising things has made them change.
157580	162300	To the cultural Marxist, anyone who believes that human beings are different, or that these
162300	167900	differences are not always associated with social constructs, is a bigot, and so will
167900	183140	very quickly be vindictively labelled a racist, sexist, rapapologist, or any other term that
183140	185980	aligns with PC shaming language.
185980	190580	No, but political correctness upsets me, so please stop.
190580	194180	People are trying to shame me into not saying things that sound racist.
194180	199220	The difference between liberalism and Marxism is very clear given that cultural Marxists
199220	202620	are against free speech and anti-free market.
202620	213300	But wait a second, Rocking Mr. E has contradicted himself in the span of about 30 seconds, because
213300	217500	firstly he talks about how people will call you a bunch of names if you say something
217500	222140	they don't like, and then he says they're anti-free speech, but the problem is criticising
222140	227940	someone for something they've said isn't trying to take away their free speech.
227940	230220	That is free speech.
230220	232200	Criticism is free speech.
232200	238180	The instant anyone stops defending their argument and starts complaining about their right to
238180	241020	have it, something's gone horribly wrong.
241020	243180	I just want to point that out.
243180	246780	There's a bird chirping outside and it's going to ruin all the audio for this section, but
246780	250380	I'm going to leave it in anyway, because I just don't give a shit.
255340	256340	Stop it!
256340	257340	What's that?
257340	258340	You're criticising what I'm saying?
258340	265140	Well, you must be trying to take away my freedom of speech.
265140	267380	Yeah, that's what it is.
267380	269620	Ah, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.
269620	273460	Let's check out what this guy who modestly calls himself the Golden One has to say.
274460	280580	I can't tell if half of these are parodies anymore.
280580	283620	Is this all an elaborate joke at my expense?
283620	288420	So for me, I never went with the mindset that I will get a fucking medal either way no matter
288420	294180	what I do, because for me, I just wanted to win, like, but a lot of other guys, the same
294180	298900	betas who are now complaining about this and that, they were the ones who like, oh, I did
298900	304980	my best, I got a medal, and when you go with that mindset, with that cultural Marxist mindset
304980	309980	that everyone is so fucking entitled, keep that word on your mind, true friends, entitled,
309980	314660	that you're entitled to get the exact fucking same thing as the winner, the guy who's trained
314660	319100	his fucking ass off and, you know, competed the hardest, struggled the hardest, went the
319100	323980	hardest, when you go with that mindset, and hey-ho, both guys are in their 20s, going
324860	330900	He trails off into talking about a completely different topic here, but I'm pretty sure
330900	335420	what he's talking about, at least in this part, is that cultural Marxists are the sort
335420	341020	of people who take part in the same competitions as quote-unquote normal people, and then at
341020	344980	the end demand the same prize as the people who win.
345980	348500	Wow, these cultural Marxists sound like total dicks.
348500	350660	That's not what Marxism is about.
350660	355340	Marx wrote about only asking for a smaller, lesser prize, made of silver or bronze, not
355340	356540	the same as the winner.
356540	357740	That's barbaric!
358220	362260	The Golden One looks like someone in control of himself, although granted, he doesn't
362260	365620	seem to know how to button a shirt and needs to hang a Swedish flag up to make sure he
365620	369620	remembers what country he's in, but otherwise he seems pretty compass-mentis.
369620	371540	Isn't winning its own reward?
371540	374540	Why is he so afraid of having his prizes devalued?
375420	380620	The Golden One protects his country by filming himself standing against scenic backgrounds,
380620	385740	lifting weights set to power metal, and ranting about homosexual propaganda.
385740	392860	So my official stance is like, the gay pride community, gay propaganda, no, Putin is absolutely
392860	394540	right, that has nothing to do with it.
394540	397340	I don't know, man, I think you should stay away from the carbs.
397340	399820	I don't know, man, I think you should stay away from the carbs.
399820	400860	Ha ha ha ha!
402940	406220	Okay, in my opinion, that's the funniest joke in this video, it's downhill from here.
406220	409180	Ugh, why can't gay people just be normal?
409180	411580	Why do they have to have pride in who they are?
411580	415980	Being proud of yourself is disgusting, which is why I am.
415980	420460	So are the cultural Marxists turning people gay with gay propaganda and gay pride?
420460	423660	Or are the gays an unrelated social parasite?
423660	429420	I don't think he approves of the gay, the whole gay community being hijacked by extreme
429420	436140	leftist betas who are trying to use that, use asexuality as a sledgehammer against the
436140	436700	family.
436700	437200	What?
438060	439900	But how did he know?
441020	442540	How, who told him?
442540	445020	Oh, I'll get you yet, the family!
445020	448380	Especially you, Kevin, you smug little bastard!
448380	451820	This guy is far too close to the truth, so I'm obviously going to have to move on to
451820	452940	another video.
452940	453660	How about this one?
455980	457020	Hey, folks.
457020	460380	This video is by my good friend Jimmy Skullman, or whatever his name is.
460380	461900	Uh, oh yeah, that's his name!
461900	466540	He's Davis Aruni, at least according to his fucking website!
467180	472700	Okay, this video is called Corruption and Cultural Marxists, but it starts off as a
472700	475260	rant about the inaccuracy of Star Trek.
475260	480540	But the trite morality plays that you find on Saturday morning cartoons in Star Trek,
480540	482060	just, they never run true.
482940	483660	For me.
483660	487580	It just, it's not been, I don't buy it.
487580	490540	My goodness, Star Trek's plot is unbelievable.
490540	493660	It's like some kind of fiction show.
494460	499500	You know, you can say a lot of things about Davis, but he's definitely gotten more honest
499500	501260	about the content of his videos over time.
501900	505660	For a guy who doesn't think Star Trek is relevant to anything or realistic, he sure
505660	508380	talks about it a lot and hasn't moved on in about three years.
508380	512220	But the feudal lords.
513820	518220	The feudal lords, just read any fantasy for this, there's always been...
518220	520620	Of course!
523900	528540	That's why he didn't want to say that Star Trek was just fiction, so it was obviously
528540	529020	fake.
529020	535740	Because he later cites fucking, fucking storybooks as proof of how the world should be!
538380	548540	I'm going to go back and watch the rest of that, I missed it.
549340	552940	Is that a firing range target full of BB gun holes?
553820	557180	But my god, Davis, your aim is terrible!
557980	564220	Rome back then, you had, you had responsible citizens that were slave owners, but they
564220	566300	treated their slaves fairly well for the most part.
566780	572460	Um, quite frankly, life was difficult back then, so, gotta roll the dice.
572460	577740	Allow me to begin my video about how I think society should be by defending slavery.
578540	582060	That's certainly the most interesting justification of slavery I've ever seen.
582060	585340	Though I have no idea what it has to do with cultural Marxism, considering Ancient Rome
585340	588140	was around thousands of years before Marx was born.
588140	592300	Three minutes in, and all the guys talked about is how slavery can be great, guys, and
592300	593420	Star Trek.
593420	595180	This guy has his priorities straight.
595260	598220	He talks briefly about how society was just fine in the 50s.
598220	599740	Productive people were in control.
601020	607820	Business owners, property holders, wealthy people that invested in their businesses were
607820	608380	in control.
609100	613900	And all the people without any control, the working schlubs, they were treated well.
616780	620860	They didn't have a government watchdog with its nose up their ass constantly.
621660	624700	Of course, the guy fucking forgot about that whole McCarthyism thing.
625180	628940	Now, society was fine, and no one's life or career was ruined by government meddling
628940	629580	back then.
629580	632860	No, things fell apart when the Welfare Queens came along.
634380	637340	You have those that do absolutely nothing all day.
637340	645820	In fact, probably, on aggregate, damage things at the end of each day and collect welfare
645820	646380	with the—
646380	647100	My goodness!
647900	648780	Not welfare!
649660	652060	Quite frankly, we live in a dystopian novel.
652060	653500	Just look around you.
653500	656060	Davis would know because he wrote a dystopian novel.
656060	659900	And by novel, I mean Fallout fanfiction with the serial numbers filed off.
661020	664700	No, seriously, he changed some names and sold this shit for money.
664700	669420	So, the guy who makes videos about non-contributive societal parasites,
669980	675340	major contribution to literature, is a book based on concepts he stole entirely from a
675340	676460	pre-existing setting.
677180	680620	Is Davis Arrheni a cultural Marxist or a different parasite?
680620	681580	He doesn't explain which.
682140	687740	These people, these rich kids, are looking for something to do so they all find a cause
687740	688700	to fight for.
688700	693660	A cause they largely manufacture themselves, but then start selling to people.
693660	698060	Nobody knows there's a problem until they invent this cure for a nonsensical problem.
698700	700380	Probably toss psychiatrists under there, too.
701420	704140	Also, psychiatrists are in on it, too, apparently.
704140	706060	Just add them to the list at this point.
706060	711100	Everyone you don't like or agree with is probably in on a conspiracy to destroy the world.
711820	714140	That's basically the tagline of the Dark Enlightenment.
714700	721260	Uh, Marxism, which is allegedly supposed to be protecting the lower classes, the proletariat,
721260	723180	you know, strength to the people.
723180	725100	That's exactly what Marx wrote.
725100	725980	That's exactly it.
725980	727580	He remembered it word for word.
727580	731260	I'm surprised because it's in one of his obscure novels, the one based on Skyrim.
732300	733420	Simply look at feminism.
734300	737980	Women are more miserable today than they were 50 years ago.
737980	740300	That's because you weren't around then, but carry on.
740300	746140	There's a study they've been doing for at least 50 years in the United States.
746140	749820	Every year, checking the general happiness of people, the longevity.
751020	753740	Name escapes me right now, but I'll link to it down below.
754540	758460	And yes, women have been getting progressively less happy thanks to feminism.
758460	761580	Davis apparently eventually remembered what he was talking about because he does link
761580	763100	to a paper in the comments.
763100	765020	Unfortunately, the paper doesn't actually exist.
765900	767500	It links to a dead page.
767500	770540	But if you Google search the article name, you do get to a paper,
770540	772380	so I'm not going to fault him for this.
772380	773100	Although I am.
773100	774220	It's his fault.
774220	779100	Of course, despite him using this study to hold feminism to task for the destruction
779100	782780	of women's happiness, the study doesn't even mention feminism at all.
783660	785980	Hit Ctrl-F and type the word of feminism in.
787020	792060	Like, that's how easy it is to verify the validity of his comments.
792060	793660	You don't even have to fucking read it.
793660	797020	50 years ago, they could choose whether or not they wanted to work or stay at home.
797100	798700	Now they all have to work.
799420	802780	Wait, so women have to work and have no choice anymore,
802780	805260	but are also choosing to be welfare queens?
805900	808220	Is Schrödinger's cat a welfare queen?
808220	811020	They're like those immigrants who come into our country, take all of our jobs,
811020	813180	but are also lazy and just claim benefits.
813740	818060	You know, in the words of the greatest philosopher of all time, Friedrich Nietzsche,
818060	821340	the best way to harm a cause is to defend it with faulty arguments.
821340	823420	When you defend your ideas really badly,
823420	826140	you make them look even stupider than they first appeared.
826140	828300	Aruni makes fun of himself better than I could.
828860	831340	He's beaten me at making him look bad.
832540	834380	I might as well move on to another video.
834380	838860	Um, how about this strapping young Daniel Radcliffe impersonator?
839580	843420	Fellow British youth, who is responsible for the ongoing attempt
843420	846060	to eradicate the British culture and the British—
846060	847260	British youth?
847260	848860	I love the British youth.
848860	852940	I used to be a British youth until time moved in,
852940	855660	coming over here giving me chronic skin problems.
856300	857180	Send it back!
857980	860140	I'm kidding. This isn't a real British youth.
860700	865180	He's a puppet for the BNPU for an offshoot of the literal British Nazi party.
865180	870460	These—I hesitate to say gentlemen—seem to know a lot about the problems plaguing Britain.
870460	872700	They have a huge and contradictory list.
872700	874140	The bastardization.
874140	875660	The genuine diversity.
875660	877900	The ever-growing debt owed by Britain.
877900	878860	Austerity measures.
878860	880300	Unsustainable housing projects.
880300	880860	Islam.
880860	882780	The uncontrolled mass immigration.
882780	885260	The dumbing down of our education system.
885260	887580	The giving away of our independence to the European Union.
887580	888780	The dumbing down of—
888780	889260	Islam.
889260	891180	By sending 12.8 billion abroad,
891180	892860	I'll start on how people sign Islam austerity.
892860	894300	Give us a spark of who's to blame,
894300	896140	and stop mass immigration.
896140	896700	Yeah!
896700	900380	And on top of that, there's a bunch of opportunistic, hate-mongering fascists
900380	903500	trying to garner sympathy with garbage propaganda videos.
903500	904380	Oh, I'll show them!
905020	909180	When I make my video about how women called Nancy are taking over the world
909180	911660	by not having sex with me when I ask them nicely,
911660	913500	and hanging out with Kevin,
913500	915500	I'll put the Game of Thrones theme over it!
916220	917260	That'll convince them!
928300	930780	But among their enemies are, you guessed it,
930780	934540	the cultural Marxists who invest our teaching establishment.
934540	936380	So Marxism is coming to get us,
936380	938380	along with capitalist consumerism,
938380	941100	which is kind of a weirdly contradictory thing if you think about it.
941100	943580	The capitalists that want to make us wage slaves,
943580	945500	as well as brainwashed consumers.
945500	946460	The heartless Zionists.
952460	953580	It's the center square!
954220	955180	We fucking did it!
955900	956940	Big money!
956940	957420	Yeah!
959660	961740	BNP video talking about the Jews!
962540	963820	I've shot my load now.
964940	966460	I don't need to talk about them anymore,
966460	967420	because they did it.
967420	968380	They brought the Jews up.
968380	968860	I'm done.
969420	970620	I'm stopping the video.
970700	971900	I don't need to watch anymore.
972620	973180	It's over.
973900	976620	Okay, it's probably mean to even compare
976620	979020	anyone else in this video to the BNP,
979020	981340	just because they target the same vague,
981340	982620	contradictory straw men.
983260	986620	The militant homosexuals who push for gay marriage and gay adoption
986620	989340	in order to destroy the traditional family unit.
989340	991660	We're trying to use that,
991660	994780	use a sexuality as a sledgehammer against the family.
994780	997740	The ongoing attempt to eradicate the British culture
997740	999340	and the British identity.
999340	1001820	And the entire aim of cultural Marxism
1001820	1003580	is to soften this up enough
1003580	1005980	to transform the culture from the inside.
1005980	1007020	The heartless Zionists,
1007020	1008460	whose interests are foreign interests.
1009500	1011340	And let's not forget the Jews.
1011340	1013020	But it doesn't help that the phrase
1013020	1015580	was literally pioneered by the Nazis.
1015580	1016940	Oh yeah, did I not mention that?
1017580	1020300	Back in the 30s, it was Kulturbolshevismus,
1020300	1022060	or cultural Bolshevism.
1022060	1024220	It also functioned as an anti-Semitic slur,
1024220	1026700	because since Marx was ancestrally Jewish,
1026700	1029100	it was easy back then to denounce Marxist ideas
1029100	1030700	as part of a Jewish plot.
1030700	1032860	The phrase became popular again quite recently
1032860	1035260	after Anders Breivik used it in his manifesto.
1036140	1037020	You know that guy?
1038620	1041500	Incidentally, the cultural Marxism page on Metapedia,
1041500	1043580	Wikipedia for white supremacists,
1043580	1045580	used to point out the link between the modern phrase
1045580	1047580	and its original Nazi origins,
1047580	1050220	but even they are slightly uncomfortable
1050220	1052620	with being linked to the literal Nazis,
1052620	1055020	so the phrase has since been edited out of the article.
1055980	1058700	Now, I can predict what my critics are going to say already.
1059260	1060860	You didn't take these people seriously.
1060860	1062540	You just laughed openly at their ideas
1062540	1064940	and poked holes in their application of studies.
1064940	1066780	I tend to only apply reason to people
1066780	1068380	who are using it themselves.
1068380	1070460	When someone makes a claim like this,
1070460	1073100	that it was the Soviets that came out on top
1073100	1076620	by convincing the Allies to go to war against the Nazis,
1076620	1078220	you really have to wonder if they give a shit
1078220	1079980	about any historical truth at all,
1079980	1082300	considering that the English were at war with Germany
1082300	1084700	years before Stalin even joined the Allies,
1084700	1086620	and there's no evidence of the Soviets
1086620	1088780	convincing the Allies to go to war.
1088780	1090940	The Allies basically made their own mind up.
1090940	1092620	There was this guy called Churchill
1092620	1094940	who, you know, made a speech about, you know,
1094940	1097740	was his mind being controlled by Stalin?
1098380	1100540	Was Churchill a Manchurian candidate?
1100540	1101500	Or is it Manchurian?
1101500	1102460	I haven't actually seen that film.
1103100	1104460	Pop culture, yay!
1104460	1106860	Wait, but is pop culture part of a conspi-
1106860	1107820	Forget it, okay.
1107820	1109740	So when someone rants about cultural Marxism
1109740	1110620	as if it were real,
1111180	1113740	yet mandates themselves to rewrite history
1113740	1114620	to suit their ends
1114620	1116220	by baselessly claiming the Soviets
1116220	1118380	manipulated the Allies into war, for example,
1118780	1120540	it seems pretty clear that reason
1120540	1122140	hasn't factored into these people's thoughts
1122140	1123020	for a long time,
1123020	1125180	so why capitulate to the idea that they are
1125180	1126620	by taking them seriously?
1126620	1128220	Incidentally, someone pointed out
1128220	1129420	the baselessness of this claim
1129420	1130380	in the comments section.
1130380	1132860	Rocking Mr. E, a rational person, apparently,
1132860	1134700	surely responded by presenting their evidence
1134700	1135660	or changing their mind
1135660	1136860	in accordance with a lack of it.
1137980	1138540	No!
1138540	1140380	You're a revisionist liar!
1140380	1142620	You come across as a typical pinko
1142620	1145260	that perpetuates communist lies!
1145260	1147340	And just to solidify the bizarre link
1147340	1149420	between the cultural Marxist conspiracy theory
1149420	1150780	and anti-Semitism,
1150780	1152060	one of Rocking Mr. E's fans
1152060	1153180	responded to this comment chain
1153180	1154940	by declaring they think the Jews themselves
1154940	1156300	tricked the Allies into the war.
1156860	1158300	I think the Allies were tricked
1158300	1160060	by the international Jews.
1160060	1163100	Clearly, Hitler was the lesser of two evils.
1163100	1163980	But don't worry,
1163980	1165900	I'm sure they're literally the only
1165900	1167580	fucked-up person leaving a comment
1167580	1169340	on a video about cultural Marxism.
1170860	1171740	Just kidding!
1171740	1173340	There's so fucking many!
1173340	1175420	Let's go on a journey of discovery!
1175420	1175920	Away!
1176480	1178960	Leftists are despicable scum
1178960	1181120	and must be mercilessly destroyed.
1181120	1184000	Cultural Marxists abound in the northeastern U.S.
1184000	1185280	as well as California.
1185280	1186560	In the south where I live,
1186560	1189920	we actively fight it by drowning it in Christianity.
1189920	1190720	Smiley face.
1193520	1197760	Onward, Christian soldiers!
1197760	1201520	Marching as to war against cultural Marxism!
1202240	1205120	Nationalism is the answer to this cancer.
1205120	1206960	Well, at least it's catchy in rhyme.
1206960	1209920	Furthermore, it only ignores fundamental Marxist flaws
1209920	1211680	such as the fluoridation of water.
1211680	1213920	Marxism is the only ideology
1213920	1217280	that calls for genocide in the name of science.
1217280	1219360	Well, I can think of one.
1219360	1220560	Nazism.
1220560	1222640	That is a filthy, kosher lie!
1223440	1225760	No national socialist leader
1225760	1229520	ever called for genocide against anyone!
1230320	1235760	If you actually took the time to study
1235760	1239120	the political theories of the Führer!
1239120	1241040	So the Holocaust never happened?
1241040	1243040	Of course it didn't happen!
1243040	1245760	Even the Red Cross admits this!
1245760	1247520	Modern forensic science has proven
1247520	1249520	that these gas chambers are a hoax
1250080	1253360	that were built by the Soviet KGB,
1253360	1257120	which was 93% Jewish!
1257200	1261440	No Jews were murdered during the Holohoax!
1261440	1265200	It was all a ploy to steal the Palestinians' land
1265200	1268720	and create the terrorist state of Israel!
1269440	1271200	No, I'm a fascist.
1271200	1272880	I just like SS uniforms.
1275120	1277600	I didn't know what cultural Marxism was
1277600	1280000	until hashtag Gamergate happened.
1282160	1283520	So in conclusion,
1283520	1285920	cultural Marxism roughly means
1285920	1288320	help me, the world is scary,
1288320	1289840	and I don't understand.
1289840	1290800	Except when it means
1291520	1293040	the Holocaust never happened,
1293920	1295200	even though I wish it did.
1297120	1299840	So if you hear someone saying cultural Marxism,
1299840	1301760	I recommend you run away from them
1301760	1304160	and report them to your local
1304160	1306480	secret KGB informant that totally exists.
1307280	1307920	I'm just kidding,
1307920	1310640	there isn't a Marxist conspiracy to destroy the West.
1312400	1314800	No, really, there isn't!
1314800	1316160	I was going to jokingly imply
1316160	1318320	I was in on the conspiracy at the end of this video,
1318320	1321040	like have it slowly zoom in on me in black and white
1321040	1322480	and I start breathing really heavily
1322480	1325200	like, oh, he knows something, he's not telling us.
1325200	1327520	But half the people watching this video
1328320	1332000	probably really think there is an actual conspiracy.
1332000	1334240	So implying even for a joke that I'm in on it
1334240	1336000	puts me in a very bad position.
1336720	1339360	So I cannot make that joke, so I won't.
1340240	1342160	How's that for freedom of speech being repressed?
1343120	1346160	Ah, fucking subtlety is just wasted on white people.
1347840	1349120	Luckily, we're going to kill them all.
1349920	1352720	Um, ah, stop recording.
1352720	1353920	Great, great.
1353920	1356480	Yeah, fuck, that was the best take I did of that
1356480	1357200	and it's gone.
1358000	1359200	Fuck, fuck it up.
1360240	1361520	God, fuck!
1373120	1375920	What's that?
1376640	1377120	What's that?
1378080	1380560	I'd like to say a very special thanks to Hesti
1380560	1382880	if that's how you pronounce your name
1383440	1385040	and also if you want me mentioning your name
1385040	1387520	in a video where I basically draw the aggro
1387520	1389200	of a lot of very weird people.
1390320	1391920	Sorry for, you know, the association
1391920	1393840	but I have to say thank you very much.
1394800	1396720	You've allowed me to add to my budget
1396720	1400560	and do things such as throw popcorn all over myself
1400560	1402160	which I previously couldn't afford to do
1402880	1408000	and also shave and afford a nice moisturiser to shave with
1408000	1409760	because I swim every morning
1409760	1412560	and when you shave and you get chlorine in your face
1412560	1414240	it does very bad things to you.
1415760	1416480	Go, go, go, go, go.
1416480	1417840	I don't, I'm not going to push you off me
1417840	1418640	because that would be mean.
1418640	1419520	I'm not going to pick you up
1419520	1421920	because then the camera would know how I pick cats up
1421920	1423040	and I'd probably do it wrong.
1423040	1424320	I have never checked.
1424320	1425840	So I'm going to make you jump off
1425840	1426960	so I don't embarrass myself.
1428000	1429840	Which of course means if you decide to sit down again
1429840	1430720	that I can't stop you.
1437680	1438400	Great.
1438400	1448400	That's just great.
