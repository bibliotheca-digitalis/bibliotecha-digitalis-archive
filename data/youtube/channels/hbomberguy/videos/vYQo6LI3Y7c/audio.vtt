00:00.000 --> 00:06.180
You know, recently on the internet, I've seen a lot of people complaining about something

00:06.180 --> 00:10.300
called cultural marxism.

00:10.300 --> 00:12.740
From the sounds of things, it's a really big deal.

00:12.740 --> 00:14.780
I have some trouble understanding what they mean, though.

00:14.780 --> 00:19.220
When I look the phrase up on Wikipedia, it redirects to a subheading in an article about

00:19.220 --> 00:24.620
the Frankfurt School and calls it a conspiracy theory about Marxists trying to destroy Western

00:24.620 --> 00:25.620
culture.

00:25.620 --> 00:28.260
But maybe we shouldn't trust Wikipedia.

00:28.260 --> 00:33.740
I mean, it's an online encyclopedia that anyone can edit, and we can't trust anyone.

00:33.740 --> 00:37.260
Some of them might be cultural Marxists trying to deny their conspiracy.

00:37.260 --> 00:42.540
Let's take to YouTube.com to discover what's really going on.

00:42.540 --> 00:48.620
Of course, there is always the slight possibility that the internet is full of crazy people,

00:48.620 --> 00:53.980
and I recorded this video at the end of the rest of the stuff that I'm about to show

00:53.980 --> 00:58.020
you, so I actually know, yeah, that is actually the case.

00:58.060 --> 01:01.140
But regardless, maybe we can have some fun and learn something anyway.

01:01.140 --> 01:06.100
So, grab yourself a mug of your favourite substance, unlock all the cells in your high-risk

01:06.100 --> 01:08.900
mind prison, and have yourself a laugh riot.

01:08.900 --> 01:09.900
Ha ha!

01:09.900 --> 01:10.900
Ha ha!

01:10.900 --> 01:11.900
Ha ha!

01:11.900 --> 01:12.900
Ha ha!

01:12.900 --> 01:13.900
Ha ha!

01:13.900 --> 01:14.900
Ha ha!

01:14.900 --> 01:15.900
Ha ha!

01:15.900 --> 01:17.700
Okay, here's our first video, and that's a really unfortunate first frame.

01:17.700 --> 01:20.300
I'd better hit play before I prejudge him.

01:20.300 --> 01:22.500
What is a cultural Marxist?

01:22.500 --> 01:28.020
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

01:28.020 --> 01:30.420
That's something I do for a joke!

01:30.420 --> 01:31.420
That's something I did!

01:31.420 --> 01:32.420
I did that!

01:32.420 --> 01:33.420
In a video!

01:33.420 --> 01:34.420
Oh my god!

01:34.420 --> 01:35.420
Is this a parody?

01:35.420 --> 01:36.420
Oh, it's not.

01:36.420 --> 01:37.420
He means it.

01:37.420 --> 01:38.420
Oh, no, this is real.

01:38.420 --> 01:39.420
Rocking Mr. E.

01:39.420 --> 01:52.420
Marx is cited as one of the major founders of the social sciences, and as such, he's

01:52.420 --> 01:53.420
a Marxist.

01:53.420 --> 02:09.980
Wait, so feminism, gender studies, and post-modernism are all Marxist too?

02:09.980 --> 02:13.100
Everything this guy doesn't like, agree with, or understand is all manufactured by

02:13.100 --> 02:14.100
one guy.

02:14.100 --> 02:15.100
How convenient!

02:15.100 --> 02:20.380
There's still people out there that believe in Western values, and the entire aim of cultural

02:20.380 --> 02:25.740
Marxism is to soften this up enough to transform the culture from the inside.

02:25.740 --> 02:30.680
So it's essential that the opposition is either ridiculed or discredited.

02:30.680 --> 02:37.580
So in other words, criticising things has made them change.

02:37.580 --> 02:42.300
To the cultural Marxist, anyone who believes that human beings are different, or that these

02:42.300 --> 02:47.900
differences are not always associated with social constructs, is a bigot, and so will

02:47.900 --> 03:03.140
very quickly be vindictively labelled a racist, sexist, rapapologist, or any other term that

03:03.140 --> 03:05.980
aligns with PC shaming language.

03:05.980 --> 03:10.580
No, but political correctness upsets me, so please stop.

03:10.580 --> 03:14.180
People are trying to shame me into not saying things that sound racist.

03:14.180 --> 03:19.220
The difference between liberalism and Marxism is very clear given that cultural Marxists

03:19.220 --> 03:22.620
are against free speech and anti-free market.

03:22.620 --> 03:33.300
But wait a second, Rocking Mr. E has contradicted himself in the span of about 30 seconds, because

03:33.300 --> 03:37.500
firstly he talks about how people will call you a bunch of names if you say something

03:37.500 --> 03:42.140
they don't like, and then he says they're anti-free speech, but the problem is criticising

03:42.140 --> 03:47.940
someone for something they've said isn't trying to take away their free speech.

03:47.940 --> 03:50.220
That is free speech.

03:50.220 --> 03:52.200
Criticism is free speech.

03:52.200 --> 03:58.180
The instant anyone stops defending their argument and starts complaining about their right to

03:58.180 --> 04:01.020
have it, something's gone horribly wrong.

04:01.020 --> 04:03.180
I just want to point that out.

04:03.180 --> 04:06.780
There's a bird chirping outside and it's going to ruin all the audio for this section, but

04:06.780 --> 04:10.380
I'm going to leave it in anyway, because I just don't give a shit.

04:15.340 --> 04:16.340
Stop it!

04:16.340 --> 04:17.340
What's that?

04:17.340 --> 04:18.340
You're criticising what I'm saying?

04:18.340 --> 04:25.140
Well, you must be trying to take away my freedom of speech.

04:25.140 --> 04:27.380
Yeah, that's what it is.

04:27.380 --> 04:29.620
Ah, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.

04:29.620 --> 04:33.460
Let's check out what this guy who modestly calls himself the Golden One has to say.

04:34.460 --> 04:40.580
I can't tell if half of these are parodies anymore.

04:40.580 --> 04:43.620
Is this all an elaborate joke at my expense?

04:43.620 --> 04:48.420
So for me, I never went with the mindset that I will get a fucking medal either way no matter

04:48.420 --> 04:54.180
what I do, because for me, I just wanted to win, like, but a lot of other guys, the same

04:54.180 --> 04:58.900
betas who are now complaining about this and that, they were the ones who like, oh, I did

04:58.900 --> 05:04.980
my best, I got a medal, and when you go with that mindset, with that cultural Marxist mindset

05:04.980 --> 05:09.980
that everyone is so fucking entitled, keep that word on your mind, true friends, entitled,

05:09.980 --> 05:14.660
that you're entitled to get the exact fucking same thing as the winner, the guy who's trained

05:14.660 --> 05:19.100
his fucking ass off and, you know, competed the hardest, struggled the hardest, went the

05:19.100 --> 05:23.980
hardest, when you go with that mindset, and hey-ho, both guys are in their 20s, going

05:24.860 --> 05:30.900
He trails off into talking about a completely different topic here, but I'm pretty sure

05:30.900 --> 05:35.420
what he's talking about, at least in this part, is that cultural Marxists are the sort

05:35.420 --> 05:41.020
of people who take part in the same competitions as quote-unquote normal people, and then at

05:41.020 --> 05:44.980
the end demand the same prize as the people who win.

05:45.980 --> 05:48.500
Wow, these cultural Marxists sound like total dicks.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.660
That's not what Marxism is about.

05:50.660 --> 05:55.340
Marx wrote about only asking for a smaller, lesser prize, made of silver or bronze, not

05:55.340 --> 05:56.540
the same as the winner.

05:56.540 --> 05:57.740
That's barbaric!

05:58.220 --> 06:02.260
The Golden One looks like someone in control of himself, although granted, he doesn't

06:02.260 --> 06:05.620
seem to know how to button a shirt and needs to hang a Swedish flag up to make sure he

06:05.620 --> 06:09.620
remembers what country he's in, but otherwise he seems pretty compass-mentis.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.540
Isn't winning its own reward?

06:11.540 --> 06:14.540
Why is he so afraid of having his prizes devalued?

06:15.420 --> 06:20.620
The Golden One protects his country by filming himself standing against scenic backgrounds,

06:20.620 --> 06:25.740
lifting weights set to power metal, and ranting about homosexual propaganda.

06:25.740 --> 06:32.860
So my official stance is like, the gay pride community, gay propaganda, no, Putin is absolutely

06:32.860 --> 06:34.540
right, that has nothing to do with it.

06:34.540 --> 06:37.340
I don't know, man, I think you should stay away from the carbs.

06:37.340 --> 06:39.820
I don't know, man, I think you should stay away from the carbs.

06:39.820 --> 06:40.860
Ha ha ha ha!

06:42.940 --> 06:46.220
Okay, in my opinion, that's the funniest joke in this video, it's downhill from here.

06:46.220 --> 06:49.180
Ugh, why can't gay people just be normal?

06:49.180 --> 06:51.580
Why do they have to have pride in who they are?

06:51.580 --> 06:55.980
Being proud of yourself is disgusting, which is why I am.

06:55.980 --> 07:00.460
So are the cultural Marxists turning people gay with gay propaganda and gay pride?

07:00.460 --> 07:03.660
Or are the gays an unrelated social parasite?

07:03.660 --> 07:09.420
I don't think he approves of the gay, the whole gay community being hijacked by extreme

07:09.420 --> 07:16.140
leftist betas who are trying to use that, use asexuality as a sledgehammer against the

07:16.140 --> 07:16.700
family.

07:16.700 --> 07:17.200
What?

07:18.060 --> 07:19.900
But how did he know?

07:21.020 --> 07:22.540
How, who told him?

07:22.540 --> 07:25.020
Oh, I'll get you yet, the family!

07:25.020 --> 07:28.380
Especially you, Kevin, you smug little bastard!

07:28.380 --> 07:31.820
This guy is far too close to the truth, so I'm obviously going to have to move on to

07:31.820 --> 07:32.940
another video.

07:32.940 --> 07:33.660
How about this one?

07:35.980 --> 07:37.020
Hey, folks.

07:37.020 --> 07:40.380
This video is by my good friend Jimmy Skullman, or whatever his name is.

07:40.380 --> 07:41.900
Uh, oh yeah, that's his name!

07:41.900 --> 07:46.540
He's Davis Aruni, at least according to his fucking website!

07:47.180 --> 07:52.700
Okay, this video is called Corruption and Cultural Marxists, but it starts off as a

07:52.700 --> 07:55.260
rant about the inaccuracy of Star Trek.

07:55.260 --> 08:00.540
But the trite morality plays that you find on Saturday morning cartoons in Star Trek,

08:00.540 --> 08:02.060
just, they never run true.

08:02.940 --> 08:03.660
For me.

08:03.660 --> 08:07.580
It just, it's not been, I don't buy it.

08:07.580 --> 08:10.540
My goodness, Star Trek's plot is unbelievable.

08:10.540 --> 08:13.660
It's like some kind of fiction show.

08:14.460 --> 08:19.500
You know, you can say a lot of things about Davis, but he's definitely gotten more honest

08:19.500 --> 08:21.260
about the content of his videos over time.

08:21.900 --> 08:25.660
For a guy who doesn't think Star Trek is relevant to anything or realistic, he sure

08:25.660 --> 08:28.380
talks about it a lot and hasn't moved on in about three years.

08:28.380 --> 08:32.220
But the feudal lords.

08:33.820 --> 08:38.220
The feudal lords, just read any fantasy for this, there's always been...

08:38.220 --> 08:40.620
Of course!

08:43.900 --> 08:48.540
That's why he didn't want to say that Star Trek was just fiction, so it was obviously

08:48.540 --> 08:49.020
fake.

08:49.020 --> 08:55.740
Because he later cites fucking, fucking storybooks as proof of how the world should be!

08:58.380 --> 09:08.540
I'm going to go back and watch the rest of that, I missed it.

09:09.340 --> 09:12.940
Is that a firing range target full of BB gun holes?

09:13.820 --> 09:17.180
But my god, Davis, your aim is terrible!

09:17.980 --> 09:24.220
Rome back then, you had, you had responsible citizens that were slave owners, but they

09:24.220 --> 09:26.300
treated their slaves fairly well for the most part.

09:26.780 --> 09:32.460
Um, quite frankly, life was difficult back then, so, gotta roll the dice.

09:32.460 --> 09:37.740
Allow me to begin my video about how I think society should be by defending slavery.

09:38.540 --> 09:42.060
That's certainly the most interesting justification of slavery I've ever seen.

09:42.060 --> 09:45.340
Though I have no idea what it has to do with cultural Marxism, considering Ancient Rome

09:45.340 --> 09:48.140
was around thousands of years before Marx was born.

09:48.140 --> 09:52.300
Three minutes in, and all the guys talked about is how slavery can be great, guys, and

09:52.300 --> 09:53.420
Star Trek.

09:53.420 --> 09:55.180
This guy has his priorities straight.

09:55.260 --> 09:58.220
He talks briefly about how society was just fine in the 50s.

09:58.220 --> 09:59.740
Productive people were in control.

10:01.020 --> 10:07.820
Business owners, property holders, wealthy people that invested in their businesses were

10:07.820 --> 10:08.380
in control.

10:09.100 --> 10:13.900
And all the people without any control, the working schlubs, they were treated well.

10:16.780 --> 10:20.860
They didn't have a government watchdog with its nose up their ass constantly.

10:21.660 --> 10:24.700
Of course, the guy fucking forgot about that whole McCarthyism thing.

10:25.180 --> 10:28.940
Now, society was fine, and no one's life or career was ruined by government meddling

10:28.940 --> 10:29.580
back then.

10:29.580 --> 10:32.860
No, things fell apart when the Welfare Queens came along.

10:34.380 --> 10:37.340
You have those that do absolutely nothing all day.

10:37.340 --> 10:45.820
In fact, probably, on aggregate, damage things at the end of each day and collect welfare

10:45.820 --> 10:46.380
with the—

10:46.380 --> 10:47.100
My goodness!

10:47.900 --> 10:48.780
Not welfare!

10:49.660 --> 10:52.060
Quite frankly, we live in a dystopian novel.

10:52.060 --> 10:53.500
Just look around you.

10:53.500 --> 10:56.060
Davis would know because he wrote a dystopian novel.

10:56.060 --> 10:59.900
And by novel, I mean Fallout fanfiction with the serial numbers filed off.

11:01.020 --> 11:04.700
No, seriously, he changed some names and sold this shit for money.

11:04.700 --> 11:09.420
So, the guy who makes videos about non-contributive societal parasites,

11:09.980 --> 11:15.340
major contribution to literature, is a book based on concepts he stole entirely from a

11:15.340 --> 11:16.460
pre-existing setting.

11:17.180 --> 11:20.620
Is Davis Arrheni a cultural Marxist or a different parasite?

11:20.620 --> 11:21.580
He doesn't explain which.

11:22.140 --> 11:27.740
These people, these rich kids, are looking for something to do so they all find a cause

11:27.740 --> 11:28.700
to fight for.

11:28.700 --> 11:33.660
A cause they largely manufacture themselves, but then start selling to people.

11:33.660 --> 11:38.060
Nobody knows there's a problem until they invent this cure for a nonsensical problem.

11:38.700 --> 11:40.380
Probably toss psychiatrists under there, too.

11:41.420 --> 11:44.140
Also, psychiatrists are in on it, too, apparently.

11:44.140 --> 11:46.060
Just add them to the list at this point.

11:46.060 --> 11:51.100
Everyone you don't like or agree with is probably in on a conspiracy to destroy the world.

11:51.820 --> 11:54.140
That's basically the tagline of the Dark Enlightenment.

11:54.700 --> 12:01.260
Uh, Marxism, which is allegedly supposed to be protecting the lower classes, the proletariat,

12:01.260 --> 12:03.180
you know, strength to the people.

12:03.180 --> 12:05.100
That's exactly what Marx wrote.

12:05.100 --> 12:05.980
That's exactly it.

12:05.980 --> 12:07.580
He remembered it word for word.

12:07.580 --> 12:11.260
I'm surprised because it's in one of his obscure novels, the one based on Skyrim.

12:12.300 --> 12:13.420
Simply look at feminism.

12:14.300 --> 12:17.980
Women are more miserable today than they were 50 years ago.

12:17.980 --> 12:20.300
That's because you weren't around then, but carry on.

12:20.300 --> 12:26.140
There's a study they've been doing for at least 50 years in the United States.

12:26.140 --> 12:29.820
Every year, checking the general happiness of people, the longevity.

12:31.020 --> 12:33.740
Name escapes me right now, but I'll link to it down below.

12:34.540 --> 12:38.460
And yes, women have been getting progressively less happy thanks to feminism.

12:38.460 --> 12:41.580
Davis apparently eventually remembered what he was talking about because he does link

12:41.580 --> 12:43.100
to a paper in the comments.

12:43.100 --> 12:45.020
Unfortunately, the paper doesn't actually exist.

12:45.900 --> 12:47.500
It links to a dead page.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.540
But if you Google search the article name, you do get to a paper,

12:50.540 --> 12:52.380
so I'm not going to fault him for this.

12:52.380 --> 12:53.100
Although I am.

12:53.100 --> 12:54.220
It's his fault.

12:54.220 --> 12:59.100
Of course, despite him using this study to hold feminism to task for the destruction

12:59.100 --> 13:02.780
of women's happiness, the study doesn't even mention feminism at all.

13:03.660 --> 13:05.980
Hit Ctrl-F and type the word of feminism in.

13:07.020 --> 13:12.060
Like, that's how easy it is to verify the validity of his comments.

13:12.060 --> 13:13.660
You don't even have to fucking read it.

13:13.660 --> 13:17.020
50 years ago, they could choose whether or not they wanted to work or stay at home.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.700
Now they all have to work.

13:19.420 --> 13:22.780
Wait, so women have to work and have no choice anymore,

13:22.780 --> 13:25.260
but are also choosing to be welfare queens?

13:25.900 --> 13:28.220
Is Schrödinger's cat a welfare queen?

13:28.220 --> 13:31.020
They're like those immigrants who come into our country, take all of our jobs,

13:31.020 --> 13:33.180
but are also lazy and just claim benefits.

13:33.740 --> 13:38.060
You know, in the words of the greatest philosopher of all time, Friedrich Nietzsche,

13:38.060 --> 13:41.340
the best way to harm a cause is to defend it with faulty arguments.

13:41.340 --> 13:43.420
When you defend your ideas really badly,

13:43.420 --> 13:46.140
you make them look even stupider than they first appeared.

13:46.140 --> 13:48.300
Aruni makes fun of himself better than I could.

13:48.860 --> 13:51.340
He's beaten me at making him look bad.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.380
I might as well move on to another video.

13:54.380 --> 13:58.860
Um, how about this strapping young Daniel Radcliffe impersonator?

13:59.580 --> 14:03.420
Fellow British youth, who is responsible for the ongoing attempt

14:03.420 --> 14:06.060
to eradicate the British culture and the British—

14:06.060 --> 14:07.260
British youth?

14:07.260 --> 14:08.860
I love the British youth.

14:08.860 --> 14:12.940
I used to be a British youth until time moved in,

14:12.940 --> 14:15.660
coming over here giving me chronic skin problems.

14:16.300 --> 14:17.180
Send it back!

14:17.980 --> 14:20.140
I'm kidding. This isn't a real British youth.

14:20.700 --> 14:25.180
He's a puppet for the BNPU for an offshoot of the literal British Nazi party.

14:25.180 --> 14:30.460
These—I hesitate to say gentlemen—seem to know a lot about the problems plaguing Britain.

14:30.460 --> 14:32.700
They have a huge and contradictory list.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.140
The bastardization.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.660
The genuine diversity.

14:35.660 --> 14:37.900
The ever-growing debt owed by Britain.

14:37.900 --> 14:38.860
Austerity measures.

14:38.860 --> 14:40.300
Unsustainable housing projects.

14:40.300 --> 14:40.860
Islam.

14:40.860 --> 14:42.780
The uncontrolled mass immigration.

14:42.780 --> 14:45.260
The dumbing down of our education system.

14:45.260 --> 14:47.580
The giving away of our independence to the European Union.

14:47.580 --> 14:48.780
The dumbing down of—

14:48.780 --> 14:49.260
Islam.

14:49.260 --> 14:51.180
By sending 12.8 billion abroad,

14:51.180 --> 14:52.860
I'll start on how people sign Islam austerity.

14:52.860 --> 14:54.300
Give us a spark of who's to blame,

14:54.300 --> 14:56.140
and stop mass immigration.

14:56.140 --> 14:56.700
Yeah!

14:56.700 --> 15:00.380
And on top of that, there's a bunch of opportunistic, hate-mongering fascists

15:00.380 --> 15:03.500
trying to garner sympathy with garbage propaganda videos.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.380
Oh, I'll show them!

15:05.020 --> 15:09.180
When I make my video about how women called Nancy are taking over the world

15:09.180 --> 15:11.660
by not having sex with me when I ask them nicely,

15:11.660 --> 15:13.500
and hanging out with Kevin,

15:13.500 --> 15:15.500
I'll put the Game of Thrones theme over it!

15:16.220 --> 15:17.260
That'll convince them!

15:28.300 --> 15:30.780
But among their enemies are, you guessed it,

15:30.780 --> 15:34.540
the cultural Marxists who invest our teaching establishment.

15:34.540 --> 15:36.380
So Marxism is coming to get us,

15:36.380 --> 15:38.380
along with capitalist consumerism,

15:38.380 --> 15:41.100
which is kind of a weirdly contradictory thing if you think about it.

15:41.100 --> 15:43.580
The capitalists that want to make us wage slaves,

15:43.580 --> 15:45.500
as well as brainwashed consumers.

15:45.500 --> 15:46.460
The heartless Zionists.

15:52.460 --> 15:53.580
It's the center square!

15:54.220 --> 15:55.180
We fucking did it!

15:55.900 --> 15:56.940
Big money!

15:56.940 --> 15:57.420
Yeah!

15:59.660 --> 16:01.740
BNP video talking about the Jews!

16:02.540 --> 16:03.820
I've shot my load now.

16:04.940 --> 16:06.460
I don't need to talk about them anymore,

16:06.460 --> 16:07.420
because they did it.

16:07.420 --> 16:08.380
They brought the Jews up.

16:08.380 --> 16:08.860
I'm done.

16:09.420 --> 16:10.620
I'm stopping the video.

16:10.700 --> 16:11.900
I don't need to watch anymore.

16:12.620 --> 16:13.180
It's over.

16:13.900 --> 16:16.620
Okay, it's probably mean to even compare

16:16.620 --> 16:19.020
anyone else in this video to the BNP,

16:19.020 --> 16:21.340
just because they target the same vague,

16:21.340 --> 16:22.620
contradictory straw men.

16:23.260 --> 16:26.620
The militant homosexuals who push for gay marriage and gay adoption

16:26.620 --> 16:29.340
in order to destroy the traditional family unit.

16:29.340 --> 16:31.660
We're trying to use that,

16:31.660 --> 16:34.780
use a sexuality as a sledgehammer against the family.

16:34.780 --> 16:37.740
The ongoing attempt to eradicate the British culture

16:37.740 --> 16:39.340
and the British identity.

16:39.340 --> 16:41.820
And the entire aim of cultural Marxism

16:41.820 --> 16:43.580
is to soften this up enough

16:43.580 --> 16:45.980
to transform the culture from the inside.

16:45.980 --> 16:47.020
The heartless Zionists,

16:47.020 --> 16:48.460
whose interests are foreign interests.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.340
And let's not forget the Jews.

16:51.340 --> 16:53.020
But it doesn't help that the phrase

16:53.020 --> 16:55.580
was literally pioneered by the Nazis.

16:55.580 --> 16:56.940
Oh yeah, did I not mention that?

16:57.580 --> 17:00.300
Back in the 30s, it was Kulturbolshevismus,

17:00.300 --> 17:02.060
or cultural Bolshevism.

17:02.060 --> 17:04.220
It also functioned as an anti-Semitic slur,

17:04.220 --> 17:06.700
because since Marx was ancestrally Jewish,

17:06.700 --> 17:09.100
it was easy back then to denounce Marxist ideas

17:09.100 --> 17:10.700
as part of a Jewish plot.

17:10.700 --> 17:12.860
The phrase became popular again quite recently

17:12.860 --> 17:15.260
after Anders Breivik used it in his manifesto.

17:16.140 --> 17:17.020
You know that guy?

17:18.620 --> 17:21.500
Incidentally, the cultural Marxism page on Metapedia,

17:21.500 --> 17:23.580
Wikipedia for white supremacists,

17:23.580 --> 17:25.580
used to point out the link between the modern phrase

17:25.580 --> 17:27.580
and its original Nazi origins,

17:27.580 --> 17:30.220
but even they are slightly uncomfortable

17:30.220 --> 17:32.620
with being linked to the literal Nazis,

17:32.620 --> 17:35.020
so the phrase has since been edited out of the article.

17:35.980 --> 17:38.700
Now, I can predict what my critics are going to say already.

17:39.260 --> 17:40.860
You didn't take these people seriously.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.540
You just laughed openly at their ideas

17:42.540 --> 17:44.940
and poked holes in their application of studies.

17:44.940 --> 17:46.780
I tend to only apply reason to people

17:46.780 --> 17:48.380
who are using it themselves.

17:48.380 --> 17:50.460
When someone makes a claim like this,

17:50.460 --> 17:53.100
that it was the Soviets that came out on top

17:53.100 --> 17:56.620
by convincing the Allies to go to war against the Nazis,

17:56.620 --> 17:58.220
you really have to wonder if they give a shit

17:58.220 --> 17:59.980
about any historical truth at all,

17:59.980 --> 18:02.300
considering that the English were at war with Germany

18:02.300 --> 18:04.700
years before Stalin even joined the Allies,

18:04.700 --> 18:06.620
and there's no evidence of the Soviets

18:06.620 --> 18:08.780
convincing the Allies to go to war.

18:08.780 --> 18:10.940
The Allies basically made their own mind up.

18:10.940 --> 18:12.620
There was this guy called Churchill

18:12.620 --> 18:14.940
who, you know, made a speech about, you know,

18:14.940 --> 18:17.740
was his mind being controlled by Stalin?

18:18.380 --> 18:20.540
Was Churchill a Manchurian candidate?

18:20.540 --> 18:21.500
Or is it Manchurian?

18:21.500 --> 18:22.460
I haven't actually seen that film.

18:23.100 --> 18:24.460
Pop culture, yay!

18:24.460 --> 18:26.860
Wait, but is pop culture part of a conspi-

18:26.860 --> 18:27.820
Forget it, okay.

18:27.820 --> 18:29.740
So when someone rants about cultural Marxism

18:29.740 --> 18:30.620
as if it were real,

18:31.180 --> 18:33.740
yet mandates themselves to rewrite history

18:33.740 --> 18:34.620
to suit their ends

18:34.620 --> 18:36.220
by baselessly claiming the Soviets

18:36.220 --> 18:38.380
manipulated the Allies into war, for example,

18:38.780 --> 18:40.540
it seems pretty clear that reason

18:40.540 --> 18:42.140
hasn't factored into these people's thoughts

18:42.140 --> 18:43.020
for a long time,

18:43.020 --> 18:45.180
so why capitulate to the idea that they are

18:45.180 --> 18:46.620
by taking them seriously?

18:46.620 --> 18:48.220
Incidentally, someone pointed out

18:48.220 --> 18:49.420
the baselessness of this claim

18:49.420 --> 18:50.380
in the comments section.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.860
Rocking Mr. E, a rational person, apparently,

18:52.860 --> 18:54.700
surely responded by presenting their evidence

18:54.700 --> 18:55.660
or changing their mind

18:55.660 --> 18:56.860
in accordance with a lack of it.

18:57.980 --> 18:58.540
No!

18:58.540 --> 19:00.380
You're a revisionist liar!

19:00.380 --> 19:02.620
You come across as a typical pinko

19:02.620 --> 19:05.260
that perpetuates communist lies!

19:05.260 --> 19:07.340
And just to solidify the bizarre link

19:07.340 --> 19:09.420
between the cultural Marxist conspiracy theory

19:09.420 --> 19:10.780
and anti-Semitism,

19:10.780 --> 19:12.060
one of Rocking Mr. E's fans

19:12.060 --> 19:13.180
responded to this comment chain

19:13.180 --> 19:14.940
by declaring they think the Jews themselves

19:14.940 --> 19:16.300
tricked the Allies into the war.

19:16.860 --> 19:18.300
I think the Allies were tricked

19:18.300 --> 19:20.060
by the international Jews.

19:20.060 --> 19:23.100
Clearly, Hitler was the lesser of two evils.

19:23.100 --> 19:23.980
But don't worry,

19:23.980 --> 19:25.900
I'm sure they're literally the only

19:25.900 --> 19:27.580
fucked-up person leaving a comment

19:27.580 --> 19:29.340
on a video about cultural Marxism.

19:30.860 --> 19:31.740
Just kidding!

19:31.740 --> 19:33.340
There's so fucking many!

19:33.340 --> 19:35.420
Let's go on a journey of discovery!

19:35.420 --> 19:35.920
Away!

19:36.480 --> 19:38.960
Leftists are despicable scum

19:38.960 --> 19:41.120
and must be mercilessly destroyed.

19:41.120 --> 19:44.000
Cultural Marxists abound in the northeastern U.S.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.280
as well as California.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.560
In the south where I live,

19:46.560 --> 19:49.920
we actively fight it by drowning it in Christianity.

19:49.920 --> 19:50.720
Smiley face.

19:53.520 --> 19:57.760
Onward, Christian soldiers!

19:57.760 --> 20:01.520
Marching as to war against cultural Marxism!

20:02.240 --> 20:05.120
Nationalism is the answer to this cancer.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.960
Well, at least it's catchy in rhyme.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.920
Furthermore, it only ignores fundamental Marxist flaws

20:09.920 --> 20:11.680
such as the fluoridation of water.

20:11.680 --> 20:13.920
Marxism is the only ideology

20:13.920 --> 20:17.280
that calls for genocide in the name of science.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.360
Well, I can think of one.

20:19.360 --> 20:20.560
Nazism.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.640
That is a filthy, kosher lie!

20:23.440 --> 20:25.760
No national socialist leader

20:25.760 --> 20:29.520
ever called for genocide against anyone!

20:30.320 --> 20:35.760
If you actually took the time to study

20:35.760 --> 20:39.120
the political theories of the Führer!

20:39.120 --> 20:41.040
So the Holocaust never happened?

20:41.040 --> 20:43.040
Of course it didn't happen!

20:43.040 --> 20:45.760
Even the Red Cross admits this!

20:45.760 --> 20:47.520
Modern forensic science has proven

20:47.520 --> 20:49.520
that these gas chambers are a hoax

20:50.080 --> 20:53.360
that were built by the Soviet KGB,

20:53.360 --> 20:57.120
which was 93% Jewish!

20:57.200 --> 21:01.440
No Jews were murdered during the Holohoax!

21:01.440 --> 21:05.200
It was all a ploy to steal the Palestinians' land

21:05.200 --> 21:08.720
and create the terrorist state of Israel!

21:09.440 --> 21:11.200
No, I'm a fascist.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.880
I just like SS uniforms.

21:15.120 --> 21:17.600
I didn't know what cultural Marxism was

21:17.600 --> 21:20.000
until hashtag Gamergate happened.

21:22.160 --> 21:23.520
So in conclusion,

21:23.520 --> 21:25.920
cultural Marxism roughly means

21:25.920 --> 21:28.320
help me, the world is scary,

21:28.320 --> 21:29.840
and I don't understand.

21:29.840 --> 21:30.800
Except when it means

21:31.520 --> 21:33.040
the Holocaust never happened,

21:33.920 --> 21:35.200
even though I wish it did.

21:37.120 --> 21:39.840
So if you hear someone saying cultural Marxism,

21:39.840 --> 21:41.760
I recommend you run away from them

21:41.760 --> 21:44.160
and report them to your local

21:44.160 --> 21:46.480
secret KGB informant that totally exists.

21:47.280 --> 21:47.920
I'm just kidding,

21:47.920 --> 21:50.640
there isn't a Marxist conspiracy to destroy the West.

21:52.400 --> 21:54.800
No, really, there isn't!

21:54.800 --> 21:56.160
I was going to jokingly imply

21:56.160 --> 21:58.320
I was in on the conspiracy at the end of this video,

21:58.320 --> 22:01.040
like have it slowly zoom in on me in black and white

22:01.040 --> 22:02.480
and I start breathing really heavily

22:02.480 --> 22:05.200
like, oh, he knows something, he's not telling us.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.520
But half the people watching this video

22:08.320 --> 22:12.000
probably really think there is an actual conspiracy.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.240
So implying even for a joke that I'm in on it

22:14.240 --> 22:16.000
puts me in a very bad position.

22:16.720 --> 22:19.360
So I cannot make that joke, so I won't.

22:20.240 --> 22:22.160
How's that for freedom of speech being repressed?

22:23.120 --> 22:26.160
Ah, fucking subtlety is just wasted on white people.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.120
Luckily, we're going to kill them all.

22:29.920 --> 22:32.720
Um, ah, stop recording.

22:32.720 --> 22:33.920
Great, great.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.480
Yeah, fuck, that was the best take I did of that

22:36.480 --> 22:37.200
and it's gone.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.200
Fuck, fuck it up.

22:40.240 --> 22:41.520
God, fuck!

22:53.120 --> 22:55.920
What's that?

22:56.640 --> 22:57.120
What's that?

22:58.080 --> 23:00.560
I'd like to say a very special thanks to Hesti

23:00.560 --> 23:02.880
if that's how you pronounce your name

23:03.440 --> 23:05.040
and also if you want me mentioning your name

23:05.040 --> 23:07.520
in a video where I basically draw the aggro

23:07.520 --> 23:09.200
of a lot of very weird people.

23:10.320 --> 23:11.920
Sorry for, you know, the association

23:11.920 --> 23:13.840
but I have to say thank you very much.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.720
You've allowed me to add to my budget

23:16.720 --> 23:20.560
and do things such as throw popcorn all over myself

23:20.560 --> 23:22.160
which I previously couldn't afford to do

23:22.880 --> 23:28.000
and also shave and afford a nice moisturiser to shave with

23:28.000 --> 23:29.760
because I swim every morning

23:29.760 --> 23:32.560
and when you shave and you get chlorine in your face

23:32.560 --> 23:34.240
it does very bad things to you.

23:35.760 --> 23:36.480
Go, go, go, go, go.

23:36.480 --> 23:37.840
I don't, I'm not going to push you off me

23:37.840 --> 23:38.640
because that would be mean.

23:38.640 --> 23:39.520
I'm not going to pick you up

23:39.520 --> 23:41.920
because then the camera would know how I pick cats up

23:41.920 --> 23:43.040
and I'd probably do it wrong.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.320
I have never checked.

23:44.320 --> 23:45.840
So I'm going to make you jump off

23:45.840 --> 23:46.960
so I don't embarrass myself.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.840
Which of course means if you decide to sit down again

23:49.840 --> 23:50.720
that I can't stop you.

23:57.680 --> 23:58.400
Great.

23:58.400 --> 24:08.400
That's just great.
