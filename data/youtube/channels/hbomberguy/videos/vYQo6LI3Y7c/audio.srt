1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,180
You know, recently on the internet, I've seen a lot of people complaining about something

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,300
called cultural marxism.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,740
From the sounds of things, it's a really big deal.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,780
I have some trouble understanding what they mean, though.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,220
When I look the phrase up on Wikipedia, it redirects to a subheading in an article about

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,620
the Frankfurt School and calls it a conspiracy theory about Marxists trying to destroy Western

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,620
culture.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,260
But maybe we shouldn't trust Wikipedia.

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,740
I mean, it's an online encyclopedia that anyone can edit, and we can't trust anyone.

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,260
Some of them might be cultural Marxists trying to deny their conspiracy.

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,540
Let's take to YouTube.com to discover what's really going on.

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,620
Of course, there is always the slight possibility that the internet is full of crazy people,

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,980
and I recorded this video at the end of the rest of the stuff that I'm about to show

14
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,020
you, so I actually know, yeah, that is actually the case.

15
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,140
But regardless, maybe we can have some fun and learn something anyway.

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,100
So, grab yourself a mug of your favourite substance, unlock all the cells in your high-risk

17
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,900
mind prison, and have yourself a laugh riot.

18
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,900
Ha ha!

19
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,900
Ha ha!

20
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,900
Ha ha!

21
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,900
Ha ha!

22
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,900
Ha ha!

23
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,900
Ha ha!

24
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,900
Ha ha!

25
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,700
Okay, here's our first video, and that's a really unfortunate first frame.

26
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,300
I'd better hit play before I prejudge him.

27
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,500
What is a cultural Marxist?

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,020
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

29
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,420
That's something I do for a joke!

30
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,420
That's something I did!

31
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,420
I did that!

32
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,420
In a video!

33
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,420
Oh my god!

34
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,420
Is this a parody?

35
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,420
Oh, it's not.

36
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,420
He means it.

37
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,420
Oh, no, this is real.

38
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,420
Rocking Mr. E.

39
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:52,420
Marx is cited as one of the major founders of the social sciences, and as such, he's

40
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,420
a Marxist.

41
00:01:53,420 --> 00:02:09,980
Wait, so feminism, gender studies, and post-modernism are all Marxist too?

42
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,100
Everything this guy doesn't like, agree with, or understand is all manufactured by

43
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,100
one guy.

44
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,100
How convenient!

45
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:20,380
There's still people out there that believe in Western values, and the entire aim of cultural

46
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:25,740
Marxism is to soften this up enough to transform the culture from the inside.

47
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,680
So it's essential that the opposition is either ridiculed or discredited.

48
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:37,580
So in other words, criticising things has made them change.

49
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,300
To the cultural Marxist, anyone who believes that human beings are different, or that these

50
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,900
differences are not always associated with social constructs, is a bigot, and so will

51
00:02:47,900 --> 00:03:03,140
very quickly be vindictively labelled a racist, sexist, rapapologist, or any other term that

52
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,980
aligns with PC shaming language.

53
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,580
No, but political correctness upsets me, so please stop.

54
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,180
People are trying to shame me into not saying things that sound racist.

55
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,220
The difference between liberalism and Marxism is very clear given that cultural Marxists

56
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,620
are against free speech and anti-free market.

57
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:33,300
But wait a second, Rocking Mr. E has contradicted himself in the span of about 30 seconds, because

58
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,500
firstly he talks about how people will call you a bunch of names if you say something

59
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,140
they don't like, and then he says they're anti-free speech, but the problem is criticising

60
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:47,940
someone for something they've said isn't trying to take away their free speech.

61
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,220
That is free speech.

62
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,200
Criticism is free speech.

63
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,180
The instant anyone stops defending their argument and starts complaining about their right to

64
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,020
have it, something's gone horribly wrong.

65
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,180
I just want to point that out.

66
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,780
There's a bird chirping outside and it's going to ruin all the audio for this section, but

67
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,380
I'm going to leave it in anyway, because I just don't give a shit.

68
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,340
Stop it!

69
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,340
What's that?

70
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,340
You're criticising what I'm saying?

71
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:25,140
Well, you must be trying to take away my freedom of speech.

72
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,380
Yeah, that's what it is.

73
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,620
Ah, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.

74
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,460
Let's check out what this guy who modestly calls himself the Golden One has to say.

75
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:40,580
I can't tell if half of these are parodies anymore.

76
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,620
Is this all an elaborate joke at my expense?

77
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,420
So for me, I never went with the mindset that I will get a fucking medal either way no matter

78
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:54,180
what I do, because for me, I just wanted to win, like, but a lot of other guys, the same

79
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,900
betas who are now complaining about this and that, they were the ones who like, oh, I did

80
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,980
my best, I got a medal, and when you go with that mindset, with that cultural Marxist mindset

81
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,980
that everyone is so fucking entitled, keep that word on your mind, true friends, entitled,

82
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,660
that you're entitled to get the exact fucking same thing as the winner, the guy who's trained

83
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,100
his fucking ass off and, you know, competed the hardest, struggled the hardest, went the

84
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,980
hardest, when you go with that mindset, and hey-ho, both guys are in their 20s, going

85
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:30,900
He trails off into talking about a completely different topic here, but I'm pretty sure

86
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,420
what he's talking about, at least in this part, is that cultural Marxists are the sort

87
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:41,020
of people who take part in the same competitions as quote-unquote normal people, and then at

88
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,980
the end demand the same prize as the people who win.

89
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,500
Wow, these cultural Marxists sound like total dicks.

90
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,660
That's not what Marxism is about.

91
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,340
Marx wrote about only asking for a smaller, lesser prize, made of silver or bronze, not

92
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,540
the same as the winner.

93
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,740
That's barbaric!

94
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,260
The Golden One looks like someone in control of himself, although granted, he doesn't

95
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,620
seem to know how to button a shirt and needs to hang a Swedish flag up to make sure he

96
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,620
remembers what country he's in, but otherwise he seems pretty compass-mentis.

97
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,540
Isn't winning its own reward?

98
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,540
Why is he so afraid of having his prizes devalued?

99
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:20,620
The Golden One protects his country by filming himself standing against scenic backgrounds,

100
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,740
lifting weights set to power metal, and ranting about homosexual propaganda.

101
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:32,860
So my official stance is like, the gay pride community, gay propaganda, no, Putin is absolutely

102
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,540
right, that has nothing to do with it.

103
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,340
I don't know, man, I think you should stay away from the carbs.

104
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,820
I don't know, man, I think you should stay away from the carbs.

105
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,860
Ha ha ha ha!

106
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,220
Okay, in my opinion, that's the funniest joke in this video, it's downhill from here.

107
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,180
Ugh, why can't gay people just be normal?

108
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,580
Why do they have to have pride in who they are?

109
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,980
Being proud of yourself is disgusting, which is why I am.

110
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,460
So are the cultural Marxists turning people gay with gay propaganda and gay pride?

111
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,660
Or are the gays an unrelated social parasite?

112
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,420
I don't think he approves of the gay, the whole gay community being hijacked by extreme

113
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:16,140
leftist betas who are trying to use that, use asexuality as a sledgehammer against the

114
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:16,700
family.

115
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,200
What?

116
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,900
But how did he know?

117
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,540
How, who told him?

118
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,020
Oh, I'll get you yet, the family!

119
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,380
Especially you, Kevin, you smug little bastard!

120
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,820
This guy is far too close to the truth, so I'm obviously going to have to move on to

121
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,940
another video.

122
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,660
How about this one?

123
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,020
Hey, folks.

124
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,380
This video is by my good friend Jimmy Skullman, or whatever his name is.

125
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,900
Uh, oh yeah, that's his name!

126
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,540
He's Davis Aruni, at least according to his fucking website!

127
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,700
Okay, this video is called Corruption and Cultural Marxists, but it starts off as a

128
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,260
rant about the inaccuracy of Star Trek.

129
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:00,540
But the trite morality plays that you find on Saturday morning cartoons in Star Trek,

130
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,060
just, they never run true.

131
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,660
For me.

132
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,580
It just, it's not been, I don't buy it.

133
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,540
My goodness, Star Trek's plot is unbelievable.

134
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,660
It's like some kind of fiction show.

135
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,500
You know, you can say a lot of things about Davis, but he's definitely gotten more honest

136
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,260
about the content of his videos over time.

137
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,660
For a guy who doesn't think Star Trek is relevant to anything or realistic, he sure

138
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,380
talks about it a lot and hasn't moved on in about three years.

139
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,220
But the feudal lords.

140
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,220
The feudal lords, just read any fantasy for this, there's always been...

141
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,620
Of course!

142
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:48,540
That's why he didn't want to say that Star Trek was just fiction, so it was obviously

143
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,020
fake.

144
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:55,740
Because he later cites fucking, fucking storybooks as proof of how the world should be!

145
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:08,540
I'm going to go back and watch the rest of that, I missed it.

146
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,940
Is that a firing range target full of BB gun holes?

147
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,180
But my god, Davis, your aim is terrible!

148
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:24,220
Rome back then, you had, you had responsible citizens that were slave owners, but they

149
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,300
treated their slaves fairly well for the most part.

150
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:32,460
Um, quite frankly, life was difficult back then, so, gotta roll the dice.

151
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:37,740
Allow me to begin my video about how I think society should be by defending slavery.

152
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,060
That's certainly the most interesting justification of slavery I've ever seen.

153
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,340
Though I have no idea what it has to do with cultural Marxism, considering Ancient Rome

154
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,140
was around thousands of years before Marx was born.

155
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,300
Three minutes in, and all the guys talked about is how slavery can be great, guys, and

156
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,420
Star Trek.

157
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,180
This guy has his priorities straight.

158
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,220
He talks briefly about how society was just fine in the 50s.

159
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,740
Productive people were in control.

160
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:07,820
Business owners, property holders, wealthy people that invested in their businesses were

161
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,380
in control.

162
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,900
And all the people without any control, the working schlubs, they were treated well.

163
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,860
They didn't have a government watchdog with its nose up their ass constantly.

164
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,700
Of course, the guy fucking forgot about that whole McCarthyism thing.

165
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,940
Now, society was fine, and no one's life or career was ruined by government meddling

166
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,580
back then.

167
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,860
No, things fell apart when the Welfare Queens came along.

168
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,340
You have those that do absolutely nothing all day.

169
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:45,820
In fact, probably, on aggregate, damage things at the end of each day and collect welfare

170
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,380
with the—

171
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,100
My goodness!

172
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,780
Not welfare!

173
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,060
Quite frankly, we live in a dystopian novel.

174
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,500
Just look around you.

175
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,060
Davis would know because he wrote a dystopian novel.

176
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,900
And by novel, I mean Fallout fanfiction with the serial numbers filed off.

177
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,700
No, seriously, he changed some names and sold this shit for money.

178
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:09,420
So, the guy who makes videos about non-contributive societal parasites,

179
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:15,340
major contribution to literature, is a book based on concepts he stole entirely from a

180
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,460
pre-existing setting.

181
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,620
Is Davis Arrheni a cultural Marxist or a different parasite?

182
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,580
He doesn't explain which.

183
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:27,740
These people, these rich kids, are looking for something to do so they all find a cause

184
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,700
to fight for.

185
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,660
A cause they largely manufacture themselves, but then start selling to people.

186
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:38,060
Nobody knows there's a problem until they invent this cure for a nonsensical problem.

187
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,380
Probably toss psychiatrists under there, too.

188
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,140
Also, psychiatrists are in on it, too, apparently.

189
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,060
Just add them to the list at this point.

190
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:51,100
Everyone you don't like or agree with is probably in on a conspiracy to destroy the world.

191
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,140
That's basically the tagline of the Dark Enlightenment.

192
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:01,260
Uh, Marxism, which is allegedly supposed to be protecting the lower classes, the proletariat,

193
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,180
you know, strength to the people.

194
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,100
That's exactly what Marx wrote.

195
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,980
That's exactly it.

196
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,580
He remembered it word for word.

197
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:11,260
I'm surprised because it's in one of his obscure novels, the one based on Skyrim.

198
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,420
Simply look at feminism.

199
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,980
Women are more miserable today than they were 50 years ago.

200
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,300
That's because you weren't around then, but carry on.

201
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:26,140
There's a study they've been doing for at least 50 years in the United States.

202
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,820
Every year, checking the general happiness of people, the longevity.

203
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,740
Name escapes me right now, but I'll link to it down below.

204
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,460
And yes, women have been getting progressively less happy thanks to feminism.

205
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,580
Davis apparently eventually remembered what he was talking about because he does link

206
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,100
to a paper in the comments.

207
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,020
Unfortunately, the paper doesn't actually exist.

208
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,500
It links to a dead page.

209
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,540
But if you Google search the article name, you do get to a paper,

210
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,380
so I'm not going to fault him for this.

211
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,100
Although I am.

212
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,220
It's his fault.

213
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,100
Of course, despite him using this study to hold feminism to task for the destruction

214
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,780
of women's happiness, the study doesn't even mention feminism at all.

215
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,980
Hit Ctrl-F and type the word of feminism in.

216
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:12,060
Like, that's how easy it is to verify the validity of his comments.

217
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,660
You don't even have to fucking read it.

218
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,020
50 years ago, they could choose whether or not they wanted to work or stay at home.

219
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,700
Now they all have to work.

220
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,780
Wait, so women have to work and have no choice anymore,

221
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,260
but are also choosing to be welfare queens?

222
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,220
Is Schrödinger's cat a welfare queen?

223
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,020
They're like those immigrants who come into our country, take all of our jobs,

224
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,180
but are also lazy and just claim benefits.

225
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:38,060
You know, in the words of the greatest philosopher of all time, Friedrich Nietzsche,

226
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,340
the best way to harm a cause is to defend it with faulty arguments.

227
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,420
When you defend your ideas really badly,

228
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,140
you make them look even stupider than they first appeared.

229
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,300
Aruni makes fun of himself better than I could.

230
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,340
He's beaten me at making him look bad.

231
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,380
I might as well move on to another video.

232
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,860
Um, how about this strapping young Daniel Radcliffe impersonator?

233
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,420
Fellow British youth, who is responsible for the ongoing attempt

234
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,060
to eradicate the British culture and the British—

235
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,260
British youth?

236
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,860
I love the British youth.

237
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,940
I used to be a British youth until time moved in,

238
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,660
coming over here giving me chronic skin problems.

239
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,180
Send it back!

240
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,140
I'm kidding. This isn't a real British youth.

241
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,180
He's a puppet for the BNPU for an offshoot of the literal British Nazi party.

242
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:30,460
These—I hesitate to say gentlemen—seem to know a lot about the problems plaguing Britain.

243
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,700
They have a huge and contradictory list.

244
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,140
The bastardization.

245
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,660
The genuine diversity.

246
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,900
The ever-growing debt owed by Britain.

247
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,860
Austerity measures.

248
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,300
Unsustainable housing projects.

249
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:40,860
Islam.

250
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,780
The uncontrolled mass immigration.

251
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,260
The dumbing down of our education system.

252
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,580
The giving away of our independence to the European Union.

253
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,780
The dumbing down of—

254
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,260
Islam.

255
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,180
By sending 12.8 billion abroad,

256
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,860
I'll start on how people sign Islam austerity.

257
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,300
Give us a spark of who's to blame,

258
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,140
and stop mass immigration.

259
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,700
Yeah!

260
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,380
And on top of that, there's a bunch of opportunistic, hate-mongering fascists

261
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,500
trying to garner sympathy with garbage propaganda videos.

262
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,380
Oh, I'll show them!

263
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,180
When I make my video about how women called Nancy are taking over the world

264
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,660
by not having sex with me when I ask them nicely,

265
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,500
and hanging out with Kevin,

266
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
I'll put the Game of Thrones theme over it!

267
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,260
That'll convince them!

268
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,780
But among their enemies are, you guessed it,

269
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,540
the cultural Marxists who invest our teaching establishment.

270
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,380
So Marxism is coming to get us,

271
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,380
along with capitalist consumerism,

272
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,100
which is kind of a weirdly contradictory thing if you think about it.

273
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,580
The capitalists that want to make us wage slaves,

274
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,500
as well as brainwashed consumers.

275
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,460
The heartless Zionists.

276
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,580
It's the center square!

277
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,180
We fucking did it!

278
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,940
Big money!

279
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,420
Yeah!

280
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,740
BNP video talking about the Jews!

281
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,820
I've shot my load now.

282
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,460
I don't need to talk about them anymore,

283
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,420
because they did it.

284
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,380
They brought the Jews up.

285
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:08,860
I'm done.

286
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,620
I'm stopping the video.

287
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,900
I don't need to watch anymore.

288
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,180
It's over.

289
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,620
Okay, it's probably mean to even compare

290
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,020
anyone else in this video to the BNP,

291
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,340
just because they target the same vague,

292
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,620
contradictory straw men.

293
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,620
The militant homosexuals who push for gay marriage and gay adoption

294
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,340
in order to destroy the traditional family unit.

295
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,660
We're trying to use that,

296
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,780
use a sexuality as a sledgehammer against the family.

297
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,740
The ongoing attempt to eradicate the British culture

298
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,340
and the British identity.

299
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,820
And the entire aim of cultural Marxism

300
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,580
is to soften this up enough

301
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,980
to transform the culture from the inside.

302
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,020
The heartless Zionists,

303
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,460
whose interests are foreign interests.

304
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,340
And let's not forget the Jews.

305
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,020
But it doesn't help that the phrase

306
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,580
was literally pioneered by the Nazis.

307
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,940
Oh yeah, did I not mention that?

308
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,300
Back in the 30s, it was Kulturbolshevismus,

309
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,060
or cultural Bolshevism.

310
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,220
It also functioned as an anti-Semitic slur,

311
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,700
because since Marx was ancestrally Jewish,

312
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,100
it was easy back then to denounce Marxist ideas

313
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,700
as part of a Jewish plot.

314
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,860
The phrase became popular again quite recently

315
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,260
after Anders Breivik used it in his manifesto.

316
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,020
You know that guy?

317
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,500
Incidentally, the cultural Marxism page on Metapedia,

318
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,580
Wikipedia for white supremacists,

319
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,580
used to point out the link between the modern phrase

320
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,580
and its original Nazi origins,

321
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,220
but even they are slightly uncomfortable

322
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,620
with being linked to the literal Nazis,

323
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,020
so the phrase has since been edited out of the article.

324
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,700
Now, I can predict what my critics are going to say already.

325
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,860
You didn't take these people seriously.

326
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,540
You just laughed openly at their ideas

327
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,940
and poked holes in their application of studies.

328
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,780
I tend to only apply reason to people

329
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,380
who are using it themselves.

330
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,460
When someone makes a claim like this,

331
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,100
that it was the Soviets that came out on top

332
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,620
by convincing the Allies to go to war against the Nazis,

333
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,220
you really have to wonder if they give a shit

334
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,980
about any historical truth at all,

335
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,300
considering that the English were at war with Germany

336
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,700
years before Stalin even joined the Allies,

337
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,620
and there's no evidence of the Soviets

338
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,780
convincing the Allies to go to war.

339
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,940
The Allies basically made their own mind up.

340
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,620
There was this guy called Churchill

341
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,940
who, you know, made a speech about, you know,

342
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,740
was his mind being controlled by Stalin?

343
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,540
Was Churchill a Manchurian candidate?

344
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,500
Or is it Manchurian?

345
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,460
I haven't actually seen that film.

346
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,460
Pop culture, yay!

347
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,860
Wait, but is pop culture part of a conspi-

348
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,820
Forget it, okay.

349
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,740
So when someone rants about cultural Marxism

350
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,620
as if it were real,

351
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,740
yet mandates themselves to rewrite history

352
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,620
to suit their ends

353
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,220
by baselessly claiming the Soviets

354
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,380
manipulated the Allies into war, for example,

355
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,540
it seems pretty clear that reason

356
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,140
hasn't factored into these people's thoughts

357
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,020
for a long time,

358
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,180
so why capitulate to the idea that they are

359
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,620
by taking them seriously?

360
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,220
Incidentally, someone pointed out

361
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,420
the baselessness of this claim

362
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,380
in the comments section.

363
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,860
Rocking Mr. E, a rational person, apparently,

364
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,700
surely responded by presenting their evidence

365
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,660
or changing their mind

366
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,860
in accordance with a lack of it.

367
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,540
No!

368
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,380
You're a revisionist liar!

369
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,620
You come across as a typical pinko

370
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,260
that perpetuates communist lies!

371
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,340
And just to solidify the bizarre link

372
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,420
between the cultural Marxist conspiracy theory

373
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,780
and anti-Semitism,

374
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,060
one of Rocking Mr. E's fans

375
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,180
responded to this comment chain

376
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,940
by declaring they think the Jews themselves

377
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,300
tricked the Allies into the war.

378
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,300
I think the Allies were tricked

379
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,060
by the international Jews.

380
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,100
Clearly, Hitler was the lesser of two evils.

381
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,980
But don't worry,

382
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,900
I'm sure they're literally the only

383
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,580
fucked-up person leaving a comment

384
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,340
on a video about cultural Marxism.

385
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,740
Just kidding!

386
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,340
There's so fucking many!

387
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,420
Let's go on a journey of discovery!

388
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:35,920
Away!

389
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,960
Leftists are despicable scum

390
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,120
and must be mercilessly destroyed.

391
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,000
Cultural Marxists abound in the northeastern U.S.

392
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,280
as well as California.

393
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,560
In the south where I live,

394
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,920
we actively fight it by drowning it in Christianity.

395
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,720
Smiley face.

396
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,760
Onward, Christian soldiers!

397
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,520
Marching as to war against cultural Marxism!

398
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,120
Nationalism is the answer to this cancer.

399
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,960
Well, at least it's catchy in rhyme.

400
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,920
Furthermore, it only ignores fundamental Marxist flaws

401
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,680
such as the fluoridation of water.

402
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,920
Marxism is the only ideology

403
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,280
that calls for genocide in the name of science.

404
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,360
Well, I can think of one.

405
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,560
Nazism.

406
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,640
That is a filthy, kosher lie!

407
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,760
No national socialist leader

408
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,520
ever called for genocide against anyone!

409
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,760
If you actually took the time to study

410
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,120
the political theories of the Führer!

411
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,040
So the Holocaust never happened?

412
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,040
Of course it didn't happen!

413
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,760
Even the Red Cross admits this!

414
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,520
Modern forensic science has proven

415
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,520
that these gas chambers are a hoax

416
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,360
that were built by the Soviet KGB,

417
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,120
which was 93% Jewish!

418
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,440
No Jews were murdered during the Holohoax!

419
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,200
It was all a ploy to steal the Palestinians' land

420
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,720
and create the terrorist state of Israel!

421
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,200
No, I'm a fascist.

422
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,880
I just like SS uniforms.

423
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,600
I didn't know what cultural Marxism was

424
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,000
until hashtag Gamergate happened.

425
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,520
So in conclusion,

426
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,920
cultural Marxism roughly means

427
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,320
help me, the world is scary,

428
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,840
and I don't understand.

429
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,800
Except when it means

430
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,040
the Holocaust never happened,

431
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,200
even though I wish it did.

432
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,840
So if you hear someone saying cultural Marxism,

433
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,760
I recommend you run away from them

434
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,160
and report them to your local

435
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,480
secret KGB informant that totally exists.

436
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,920
I'm just kidding,

437
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,640
there isn't a Marxist conspiracy to destroy the West.

438
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,800
No, really, there isn't!

439
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,160
I was going to jokingly imply

440
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,320
I was in on the conspiracy at the end of this video,

441
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,040
like have it slowly zoom in on me in black and white

442
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,480
and I start breathing really heavily

443
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,200
like, oh, he knows something, he's not telling us.

444
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,520
But half the people watching this video

445
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,000
probably really think there is an actual conspiracy.

446
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,240
So implying even for a joke that I'm in on it

447
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,000
puts me in a very bad position.

448
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,360
So I cannot make that joke, so I won't.

449
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,160
How's that for freedom of speech being repressed?

450
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,160
Ah, fucking subtlety is just wasted on white people.

451
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,120
Luckily, we're going to kill them all.

452
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,720
Um, ah, stop recording.

453
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,920
Great, great.

454
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,480
Yeah, fuck, that was the best take I did of that

455
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,200
and it's gone.

456
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,200
Fuck, fuck it up.

457
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,520
God, fuck!

458
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,920
What's that?

459
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,120
What's that?

460
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,560
I'd like to say a very special thanks to Hesti

461
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,880
if that's how you pronounce your name

462
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,040
and also if you want me mentioning your name

463
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,520
in a video where I basically draw the aggro

464
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,200
of a lot of very weird people.

465
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,920
Sorry for, you know, the association

466
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,840
but I have to say thank you very much.

467
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,720
You've allowed me to add to my budget

468
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,560
and do things such as throw popcorn all over myself

469
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,160
which I previously couldn't afford to do

470
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,000
and also shave and afford a nice moisturiser to shave with

471
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,760
because I swim every morning

472
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,560
and when you shave and you get chlorine in your face

473
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,240
it does very bad things to you.

474
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,480
Go, go, go, go, go.

475
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,840
I don't, I'm not going to push you off me

476
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,640
because that would be mean.

477
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,520
I'm not going to pick you up

478
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,920
because then the camera would know how I pick cats up

479
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,040
and I'd probably do it wrong.

480
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,320
I have never checked.

481
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,840
So I'm going to make you jump off

482
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,960
so I don't embarrass myself.

483
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,840
Which of course means if you decide to sit down again

484
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,720
that I can't stop you.

485
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,400
Great.

486
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:08,400
That's just great.
