1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,560
This is Cthulhu. It's a film that came out in 2008. Not many people appear to have seen

2
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,880
it.

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,560
As a teenager, I was obsessed with the works of Howard Phillips Lovecraft. Lovecraft was

4
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,120
a pioneer in Pulp Horror Fiction, immediately gripping with his cavalcade of creative monsters,

5
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,020
epic scope, terrible fates, and a unique philosophy about the terror of the existence of gods

6
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,400
greater than the human consciousness could allow. The man's work was inspirational

7
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,920
and moving to me. It made me think, made me dream, made me want to be a writer. Also,

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:57,160
seeing cool new words like Theosophists, or Non-Euclidean, or sentences like The Blood

9
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:04,760
Roots grew insolent in their chromatic perversion made me feel smart. I liked thinking I was

10
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,760
smart.

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,640
I was a big fan of the role-playing game, too. I just really liked the way that it dealt

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,880
with the mythos and how you interact with it, and the way it modeled sanity was really

13
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,200
good, too. And, hang on, can we, can someone find out who did this and why? I've been confused

14
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,840
by this for like a decade now.

15
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,520
As my interest grew and I ran out of stories by, inspired by, or about Lovecraft to read,

16
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,320
I started playing or watching any game or film even remotely based on his work. I'd

17
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,880
seen Re-Animator and its sequels, and From Beyond, and I was even about to watch Hellraiser

18
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,600
when I found an interview with Clive Barker where he said he didn't like Lovecraft's

19
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,160
writing very much and decided not to watch the film out of some misguided sense of spite.

20
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,160
That was how I did things back then, apparently.

21
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,840
I'd heard that Guillermo del Toro was going to adapt At the Mountains of Madness, one

22
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,560
of the best of Lovecraft's stories, and I couldn't wait for that. It turned out

23
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,920
I shouldn't have waited because it didn't happen. It was in development hell for a very

24
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,560
long time, and then it was never greenlit.

25
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,440
Then, as I was scraping the bottom of the barrel and watching fan films on YouTube,

26
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,880
I eventually found out about Cthulhu. It was named after Lovecraft's most famous creation,

27
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,680
and it had been made so recently that it might have been able to take advantage of the kinds

28
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,960
of effects and production techniques possible in modern filmmaking that something of truly

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:27,520
epic scale might actually have been possible. Cthulhu is not that film. Cthulhu isn't in

30
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,800
the film. It isn't even based on the short story The Call of Cthulhu. It's actually

31
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,000
a loose, very loose, interpretation of The Shadow Over Innsmouth. In that story, the

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,320
narrator investigates a New England fishing town where the people are strange and unwelcoming

33
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,840
to outsiders. He eventually discovers that the people of the town worship a godlike fish

34
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,320
creature named Dagon and its monstrous children, and have begun breeding with those creatures,

35
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,580
and their descendants eventually transform into monsters themselves to take to the water

36
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,800
and live forever beneath the sea with Dagon. After barely escaping with his life, the narrator

37
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,280
realizes that his family tree comes from Innsmouth, and he is slowly becoming one of them, too,

38
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,680
and he's starting to like it and relish the chance to worship Dagon for all time. It's

39
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,280
a really good story, and it's an excellent example of early 20th century American horror,

40
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,800
with the narrator's final change serving as a genuinely uncomfortable and fascinating

41
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,960
twist. It's really a true classic. This film is about a gay college professor called Russell,

42
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,800
who learns that his mother has passed away and returns to his hometown for her funeral.

43
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,440
Russell's father is the leader of a strange religious cult, and also deeply homophobic,

44
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,760
along with many of the rest of the townspeople. Russell realizes the cult has designs on him

45
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,120
of some kind, and something strange is going on. He reconnects with an old lover from his

46
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,000
past and tries to learn the truth as the people become increasingly hostile towards his search.

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,440
In lieu of looking at the tangible specifics of the horror, the beliefs of the cult, or

48
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:59,400
portraying the monsters from the original story, the film focuses on Russell's own

49
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,000
emotional state, his experiences and dreams, and relation to the people he encounters as

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,760
he tries to understand what is happening. When monsters do briefly appear, there's

51
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,960
not really much to see. The story isn't really concerned with them.

52
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:20,160
When I first saw this film, I decided that I hated it more than any other film. It had

53
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,280
taken something I cared about and enjoyed, and removed the things I thought made it interesting

54
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,160
and valuable. It made an existential horror about god-like creatures that care not for

55
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,120
human affairs into a story where the god in question never turns up or does anything

56
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,360
or is even really talked about in it. And even the name's technically the wrong name

57
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,800
of the god. Oh, and if you put the disc in a PC, the label doesn't even spell Cthulhu

58
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,960
properly! It's such an easy word to spell! The whole film felt like a betrayal. The camera

59
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,760
sometimes sits very still, trapping you with Russell in situations neither of you want

60
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,960
to be in, for conversations he doesn't want to be having with people he doesn't want to

61
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,960
see.

62
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,960
So, um, how's the, uh, how's the church?

63
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,960
How's the gay life treating you, Russell?

64
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,560
It's my life.

65
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
Is it satisfying?

66
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,560
Are you fulfilled?

67
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,960
What do you want to know? You want to know what we do?

68
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,960
Danny, please, just stay, stay out of this.

69
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,960
I didn't want any of this. I wanted something big, something epic, something focusing on

70
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,560
the horror of the big monsters, the sheer scope of the cosmos beyond our reach and the

71
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,200
nihilistic implications of being unimportant in the face of seemingly all-powerful things

72
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,680
that can decide our fate on a whim. For so much of it, it was such an uncomfortable and

73
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,520
personal and low-key horror. A human horror I wasn't really prepared for and was sure

74
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,520
I didn't want.

75
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:01,680
But as I got older and lived a decade of new experiences, to put it simply, I grew up.

76
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,480
I just sort of realized one day that I was capable of being romantically attracted to

77
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,680
men as well as women. I realized I was different from how I'd even thought of myself. I'd

78
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,680
just sort of naturally seen myself as straight, and even if I didn't think I thought of it

79
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,640
this way, on some primal level, I'd thought of being straight as being normal. I didn't

80
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,400
know why I thought like that. It's probably a mix of not really thinking too hard about

81
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,160
these things at the time combined with the vague notions and expectations our society

82
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,440
tends to have towards people's sexuality. But one day I looked in the mirror and saw

83
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:42,600
myself as not who I thought I was. I saw myself as an outsider from me, from the identity

84
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,920
I'd assumed for myself. And then I had a few difficult conversations with troublesome

85
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,620
people about those feelings. I'd always experienced termophobia. I was an effeminate

86
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,200
boy growing up, but I hadn't really cared because at the time I'd not really accepted

87
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,680
it as an insult or seen anything wrong with being called gay by losers in high school

88
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,260
who had just as much growing up to do as I did. But when I actually was one of those

89
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:11,800
people and knew it, all of a sudden it was a real judgment of who I actually was. To

90
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,620
them I'd actually become lesser. Being told I was going to die of AIDS and that my feelings

91
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:23,980
were unnatural and so on, and having to deal with being actually expected to try to convince

92
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:29,140
people that I wasn't inferior to them, suddenly made me think about that Cthulhu film I'd

93
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:35,900
seen a few years before. It was like it knew what I was going through. It knew how it felt

94
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:41,940
to sit in a room you just can't leave and have a piece of your personhood interrogated.

95
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:48,060
It knew how it felt to be seen as an outsider, and it knew how it felt to connect with someone

96
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,700
who understands and accepts you. Somehow it knew me and how I'd felt before I'd ever

97
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,940
had a chance to. Some of the scenes from this film just kept coming back up in my mind.

98
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:04,460
It hadn't been what I'd thought I'd wanted, but what it was struck a chord with me anyway

99
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,740
on a level I didn't know was there. It just took a while for me to hear the chiming.

100
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:14,700
It turns out that some of the greatest horrors, biggest sources of sadness in our lives, don't

101
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,580
come from scope or big questions, but from the tiniest things. If you've ever lost

102
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,300
a loved one and had to be involved with the arrangements of their funeral, or if you've

103
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,820
ever had to be around someone you'd made an effort to cut out of your life because

104
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,380
of something abusive they'd done to you, or even something as simple as being reminded,

105
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,380
gently, that you're in a place where everyone regards you with suspicion, that you're

106
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:40,020
an outsider to them, you'll already know that the idea of a powerful cosmic monster

107
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,860
out there somewhere beneath the sea can actually be the least of a person's problems.

108
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,700
The film was, in retrospect, a meaningful and valuable work that paid respect to the

109
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:55,240
source material's themes and emotions in ways I hadn't grasped as a cynical kid who

110
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,860
thought he knew he was straight and thought he knew what made Lovecraft good, and I just

111
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,340
wasn't ready to appreciate the value of that kind of story at the time.

112
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,140
Here's a review from back in 2009 on the film's Amazon page by someone called Giles.

113
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,500
Giles writes...

114
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:16,020
I can't stress how bad this film is on every level. As for H.P. Lovecraft, he must be spinning

115
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:21,100
in his grave, because this is definitely the worst film adaptation yet. It is vaguely based

116
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,100
on Shadow over Innsmouth, but the story, what there is of it, is so badly constructed that

117
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,660
you could easily miss the very few similarities.

118
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,540
And why all the gay subplot? What was that all about?

119
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,540
Now, here's the thing about Giles from 2009.

120
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,820
I was Giles in 2009.

121
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,540
No, I'm fairly certain I didn't write this exact Amazon review, but I felt the same way

122
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,340
as this person at around the same time. It didn't make sense to the teenage me whose

123
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,260
main frame of reference on the world was the horror stories he'd read, but then I grew

124
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,780
up and it started making a lot more sense without me even having to go back and see

125
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,820
the film again.

126
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,140
This film and its delayed effect on me got me thinking about what works about Lovecraft's

127
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,540
stories, what doesn't, and what the best way might be to navigate these qualities in

128
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,700
creating an adaptation.

129
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:13,620
And along the way, with a lot of encouragement, and if it's not too awkward, we'll maybe

130
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:19,780
talk about the fact that a writer who basically founded a subgenre of fiction has been hugely

131
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:26,020
influential and made so many people want to become writers, including myself, was really

132
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,020
massively racist.

133
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:34,740
INTRO

134
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,780
Anyway, let's start at the beginning, shall we?

135
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,620
Why do humans create and tell each other stories?

136
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,540
Yeah, I'm sure we can settle that real quick, we've only been asking that question for

137
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,060
a millennia.

138
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:55,940
I can solve that, I've got a plaque for surpassing over 100,000 YouTube subscribers.

139
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,500
Firstly, we should acknowledge that fiction isn't simply the opposite of truth, it is,

140
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,460
in some sense, a reflection of truth.

141
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,740
Let's look at horror stories.

142
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:10,100
When a ghost story speaks of a place being haunted by the past, it speaks to us about

143
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,300
the ways that really does happen, the ways the world controls and decides things for

144
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,020
us, and how the legacy, the result of other people's decisions, are still here with

145
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,660
us even after the people who made them are gone.

146
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,500
The ghosts of the past really do haunt the present they built.

147
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:32,180
Vampires, similarly, tend to be impactful because they reflect some true aspect of the

148
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,260
society that was writing about them at the time.

149
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,500
There's a reason Dracula was a count.

150
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:42,180
Vampires are aristocratic, upper-class beings that live by parasitically consuming the essence

151
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,580
of the poor workers and exploiting people using their influence, either their literal

152
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,940
riches or their other, less tangible powers.

153
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,500
And in doing this, they literalize a very real but much more vague social antagonism.

154
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,140
The aristocracies, monarchies, and other rich and powerful figures over history rarely actually

155
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,820
drink people's blood for sustenance, although the way the current economy is going, who

156
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,180
knows, but the rich really are vampires, in a sense.

157
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,420
They really do profit and thrive from the work and sacrifice of those beneath them.

158
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,180
It's not unimaginable that consciousness of this kind of antagonism makes its way

159
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:19,380
into folklore as creatures that are only slightly more exaggerated forms of the actual power

160
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,660
relationships between rich and poor people, or boss and worker.

161
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,180
Bram Stoker?

162
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,980
More like Gram-shee Stoker?

163
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,300
Uh, doesn't really work, does it?

164
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,860
Is there a better Marxist thinker who would work here as a pun?

165
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,580
Let me know in the comments so I can feel like an idiot for missing it.

166
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,260
When you're reading Dracula, you're not just reading a creative horror about a scary

167
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:47,060
monster, you're reading a story that most people, on some level, understand.

168
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,860
It's relevant to the world people live in, where a non-magical version of Dracula's

169
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,580
immense influence and theft of livelihood from ordinary people really does happen.

170
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:02,420
Notably, even Karl Marx repeatedly used vampirism as a way of describing the nature of capitalism

171
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,700
in Das Kapital.

172
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,580
Look, my point here isn't that vampire stories are all secretly about how capitalism is bad

173
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,060
or something, that would be ridiculous, and so many of them were written before the actual

174
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,860
proper invention of capitalism as we know it today.

175
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:22,100
My point is that it was a way of talking about issues that functioned so well that

176
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,980
when the time came to actually talk about things like capitalism, the guy who started

177
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:34,260
talking about it used vampires as a way of talking about it, which usually means that

178
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,660
the stories were onto something that was kind of, like, real, something that was there.

179
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,300
It's also notable that Fifty Shades of Grey, originally a fanfiction based on Twilight,

180
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,820
kinda does this too.

181
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,380
It takes out all the major supernatural aspects of Twilight and, of course, the simplest way

182
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:54,180
of bringing the dynamics between a magical, immortal vampire and a young, innocent teenage

183
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,980
girl into the real world is to reimagine the vampire as a billionaire with immense influence

184
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,300
and a very particular sexual taste.

185
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,340
Look, the richer vampires, basically, I think have made this point.

186
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,740
The Slasher film also embodies this as well.

187
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,300
The killer in Slasher stories is an urban, modern creature which expresses modern, urban

188
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,860
The fear of what's happening in the neighborhood behind everyone's closed doors where they

189
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,380
could be getting up to just about anything.

190
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,580
The fear of the effects of modern living on people growing up in it.

191
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:24,260
Fellow YouTuber Nick's Fears did a really cool video going into the deeper aspects of

192
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,060
this in Halloween, which you can check out linked in the description.

193
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,500
It's good and long and fun and please go watch it.

194
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:37,300
The Slasher films are silly, gross, gory, and often just kind of bad, but they got popular

195
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,820
because they're dealing with something that's real and actually happening.

196
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:54,420
Okay, that's not actually happening in real life, but that's from like part eight of a

197
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:00,740
franchise and you don't get seven sequels without at least originally having some resonating

198
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,300
cultural.

199
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,420
He punches his head into a bin.

200
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,740
You get a perspective shot of it.

201
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,020
It's like you're looking out of his head as it flies off.

202
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:14,340
The idea that fiction is not the opposite of facts, but actually can be more truthful

203
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,740
than facts on their own is key to what makes storytelling so important.

204
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:24,740
Art is all lies, all perceptions, always subjective, always up for further interpretation,

205
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,860
and always slanted by the perspectives of its creators.

206
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,980
But art is lies in service to truth.

207
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,500
Bringing all of this back, what of Lovecraft?

208
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,780
What makes his work in particular continue to be remembered alongside Dracula or Halloween

209
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,060
and act as direct inspiration for yet more creative works?

210
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,460
What truth is hidden within his fiction?

211
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,260
Well, it might be the existential horror.

212
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,780
His works come together to relate a thoroughly nihilistic universe,

213
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,940
wholly uncaring about our existence, and there may well be a truth to that,

214
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,660
but it isn't whether or not human existence actually matters that's central to his work.

215
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,180
It's not quite the idea of that stuff actually being true,

216
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:10,260
but rather the direct feeling of being unimportant in the grand scheme of things.

217
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,020
Lovecraft's writing and tropes function in this regard a lot like one of the writers

218
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,820
who in turn inspired him, Edgar Allan Poe.

219
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,540
Poe doesn't exactly make people feel good.

220
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,900
Rather, he makes them feel sad in a productive way.

221
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,580
It can make people who are prone to those feelings feel less alone

222
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,140
because they know others have them too.

223
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,380
The Call of Cthulhu doesn't begin by telling you how scary a big monster could be

224
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,580
or giving you a description of what its tentacles would look like.

225
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:41,380
It opens with a profound fear of the future and of what discoveries might lie there.

226
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:46,180
The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little,

227
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,980
but someday the piecing together of dissociated knowledge

228
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,860
will open up such terrifying vistas of reality and of our frightful position therein

229
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,500
that we shall either go mad from the revelation

230
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:01,140
or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.

231
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,820
So what mattered wasn't how creative or imaginative his stories got,

232
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:08,180
but how they related to people's own feelings of unimportance

233
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,580
then and now in the actual world.

234
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,620
There's the old joke that a paranoid person,

235
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,500
if they were ever to discover the room that the government spied on them from

236
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,260
with all the notes on their lives,

237
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,460
they wouldn't actually be any more afraid because of this.

238
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,220
They'd feel validated.

239
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,740
They weren't paranoid.

240
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,860
They were right.

241
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,780
And through that lens, Lovecraft is a way of feeling completely assured

242
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,740
that the world really is out to get you,

243
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,340
and maybe God doesn't care or hates you or wants you dead.

244
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,740
You can use special effects to design something scarier

245
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,820
than the man himself could ever have imagined,

246
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,820
but that alone isn't actually the thing that's scary about the story.

247
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,940
What's scary is the way these smaller aspects build

248
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,020
to create a sense that humans are tiny and powerless creatures,

249
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,340
that the greatest height we can aspire to

250
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,700
is a deep and intimate understanding of just how little we understand.

251
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,740
Lovecraft rarely reused his creations between stories,

252
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,980
and that's because the creatures he came up with didn't really matter.

253
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,820
They were interchangeable,

254
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,380
and the ideas they existed to communicate

255
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,340
with their scope and alienness was what mattered.

256
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,060
Unfortunately, however, this is where things get a bit hairy and complicated.

257
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,380
One of Lovecraft's most famous quotes goes,

258
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,420
"'The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear,

259
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,500
and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.'"

260
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
And you know what this guy didn't know much about?

261
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,380
People of other races.

262
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,780
Look, we've managed to brush past it,

263
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,580
but we do have to talk about Lovecraft's racism, sexism,

264
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,780
antisemitism, and homophobia.

265
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,500
It's happening now.

266
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,460
So for the folks out there who don't think you can criticize an author's beliefs

267
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,900
just because it was a different time and it happened 100 years ago,

268
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,500
thanks for watching.

269
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,100
Don't forget to like and subscribe.

270
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,220
I'll see you next time.

271
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,500
I promise I'll review a game and make some jokes or something in the next one.

272
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,020
Are they gone?

273
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,420
Okay, they're gone.

274
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:13,460
Right, so it's pop-culturally quite well known that Lovecraft was a bit xenophobic,

275
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,660
and I do remember reading some pretty bad stuff,

276
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,420
but it was a while ago that I read it,

277
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,500
and I'm sure it can't be as bad as I remember.

278
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,420
What the fuck is nautical looking supposed to mean, Howard?

279
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,940
What does it even mean?

280
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,420
...

281
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,460
In his biography of H.P. Lovecraft, fittingly entitled

282
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,020
Against the World Against Life,

283
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,780
Michel Houellebecq writes,

284
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,100
The character of Lovecraft fascinates us,

285
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,860
partly because his system of values is entirely opposed to ours.

286
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,340
Fundamentally racist, openly reactionary,

287
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,180
he glorifies Puritan inhibition and quite evidently finds repellent

288
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,420
any open display of eroticism.

289
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,980
Resolutely anti-commercial, he despises money,

290
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,500
considers democracy to be pure folly, progress an illusion.

291
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,140
The word liberty, so dear to Americans, elicits from him only a gloomy sneer.

292
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,740
All his life he maintained a typically aristocratic attitude of scorn

293
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,180
for humanity in general together with an extreme solicitude

294
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,420
toward individuals in person.

295
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,380
Houellebecq kinda sucks, honestly,

296
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,740
and idolizes some of Lovecraft's worst qualities in his biography,

297
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,140
but this quote is helpful in illustrating the specifics

298
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,300
of Lovecraft's worldview, so I'm gonna use it.

299
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,260
A stopped clock is right twice a day, I suppose.

300
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,140
Lovecraft seemingly hated society itself,

301
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,540
but he had a deeper and specific dislike

302
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,180
for Black and Jewish people along with immigrants.

303
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:40,340
It's so prevalent in his writing that even citing multiple examples

304
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,460
would kind of diminish how overwhelming and constant it is.

305
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,020
I can't even bring myself to say the name of Lovecraft's cat

306
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,860
because it's a racial slur.

307
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,100
And despite this obviously completely full schedule of racism

308
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,820
and general hatred for humanity itself,

309
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,940
he also managed to find time to be a raging homophobe.

310
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,660
He claimed not to have even known homosexuality existed

311
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,340
until he was in his 30s,

312
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,860
but then he goes on to immediately compare it to being a pederast.

313
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,900
You know, growing up, I always would immediately try to find ways

314
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,860
to write off or handwave away the racism.

315
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,060
You know, I would say, well, it was a part of his time.

316
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,940
I never really just sat down and gave myself the opportunity

317
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,900
to just say, God, what a piece of shit.

318
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,620
I mean, honestly, like, his work meant something to me

319
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,780
in a really, like, profound way

320
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,460
that no other work has ever really done,

321
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,900
but I fucking think the guy's terrible.

322
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,500
As a side note, Lovecraft's views apparently softened a little bit over time.

323
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,340
In a letter he wrote a month before his death,

324
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,340
he claimed he understood the blindness

325
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,340
and defiant ignorance of reactionaries

326
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,940
because he used to be one.

327
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,140
"'I know how smugly ignorant I was,' he wrote.

328
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,780
He supposedly became a socialist in the last year of his life

329
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,060
and supported the New Deal,

330
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,300
and he was married to a Jewish woman for a while,

331
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,900
but it's debatable whether he really developed all that much,

332
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,500
and the racism in his work is still unavoidably there.'"

333
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,780
And this leads us to a very weird and difficult question.

334
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,780
Why are there queer Lovecraft fans?

335
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,020
Why do I exist?

336
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,460
And why do so many people like me exist?

337
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,340
Why is this space a place for a lot of queer

338
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,420
and marginalized people in the first place?

339
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,860
Why does his work resonate so well

340
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,820
with people who the man himself would have hated even more

341
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,500
than he hated everyone else?

342
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:37,540
Now, I don't think I'm qualified to answer this question.

343
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,580
I don't actually think anyone really is.

344
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,140
There's probably a lot of different reasons,

345
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,580
but from what I can gather,

346
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,100
it seems like the answer lies in the specifics

347
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,100
of how Lovecraft saw the world,

348
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,460
in the place that his approach actually came from.

349
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,300
"'When Lovecraft was three years old,

350
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,500
his father had a breakdown

351
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,100
and was committed to a mental hospital.

352
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,700
He died there five years later.

353
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,340
His mother also frequently suffered from similar problems

354
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,740
and later died in the same hospital.

355
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,100
Lovecraft suffered from periods of severe anxiety and depression.

356
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,540
He had to drop out of high school

357
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,340
and often isolated himself for long periods at a time.

358
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,660
He saw himself as a temporary visitor

359
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,660
to a strange and unwelcoming world.

360
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,860
This is present even in one of Lovecraft's earliest stories,

361
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,140
The Outsider.

362
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,420
The narrator escapes from being trapped within a decaying castle,

363
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,820
but his search for human contact is frustrated

364
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,380
when the people he finds run away in horror.

365
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,340
He turns and sees a detestable and ghoulish creature

366
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,700
has entered the room.

367
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,060
To his shock, he realizes he's looking into a mirror."

368
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,860
All of his best works draw into close focus

369
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,500
not some generic fear of outsiders,

370
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,860
but the anxieties and fears that come with being an outsider,

371
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,860
of being in a world that doesn't really understand you,

372
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:58,180
and perhaps of not being fully able to understand yourself.

373
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,340
So there is a fairly decent reason here

374
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,340
why someone might be drawn to these works,

375
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,820
even if the author was deeply problematic.

376
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,300
And this appears to have been true to some degree

377
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,900
at the time in a strange way.

378
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,900
Lovecraft was pretty open about the problems

379
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,420
he had with homosexuality.

380
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,300
However, several of his closest friends were gay,

381
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,260
including the poets Hart Crane and Samuel Loveman

382
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,620
and Robert Hayward Barlow,

383
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,940
who he worked closely with on numerous stories

384
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,740
and who Lovecraft made the executor of his literary estate

385
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,860
in the event of his death.

386
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,380
It's partially due to Barlow

387
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,900
that so much of Lovecraft's writing

388
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,260
has been preserved over the years,

389
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,900
given how he wasn't all that popular at the time.

390
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,900
The deeply bigoted belief in a link

391
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,820
between homosexuality and pedophilia

392
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,740
is invoked, this time on purpose,

393
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,940
in the film as well.

394
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,100
There's a scene in Cthulhu where Russell is arrested

395
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,660
on manufactured charges of being a pedophile.

396
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,580
-"You're under arrest for murder." -"Oh, come on."

397
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,260
-"Rape of a minor." -"Oh, wait, you can't--"

398
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,020
-"Trespass--" -"The event is positioned

399
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,700
as an extension of his mistreatment

400
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,140
by the rest of the town.

401
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,900
We're seeing the kind of alienation

402
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,300
the original stories had to invent a foreign cult

403
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,420
to get across,

404
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,900
but translated into actual things

405
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,580
people do experience."

406
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,300
-"Oh, yeah, you like this? Faggot goes off to jail?"

407
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,140
The easiness and convenience

408
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,140
with which having a different sexual preference

409
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,740
is equated with criminality

410
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,940
is something that real people deal with even today.

411
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,660
For some people,

412
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,140
the intellectualized existential problems

413
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,460
Lovecraft had originally written to explore

414
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,900
cease to be theoretical

415
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,140
and start to communicate familiar experiences

416
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,220
the same way Edgar Allan Poe's writing can be

417
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,820
to someone who's lost a loved one,

418
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,500
or the way Halloween explores

419
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,340
the suburban fear of one's neighbors,

420
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,060
or Dracula puts words to a deeper understanding

421
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,980
of the antagonism between different classes

422
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,500
in our social hierarchy.

423
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,580
For those who've been treated like this

424
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,860
in the name of a religion

425
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,100
or simply by their surrounding society

426
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,340
because of its horrific expectations,

427
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,220
have they not come the closest a person can

428
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,500
in the real world

429
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,980
to the central Lovecraftian experience?

430
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,420
Have they not, in a sense,

431
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,740
glimpsed the face of an uncaring universe?

432
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,580
-"He was a guy that definitely did not get laid much,

433
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,740
you know, and a guy that was

434
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,780
an alien amongst us."

435
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,100
Del Toro still hasn't gotten to make

436
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,620
the Mountains of Madness adaptation

437
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,700
he wanted to make and I wanted to see,

438
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,820
but what's weird is,

439
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,700
as I've grown older

440
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,060
and become more interested in stories

441
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,020
that are more compelling

442
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,540
than Lovecraft's original works,

443
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,540
it seems that Del Toro has as well.

444
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,780
In a recent interview about The Shape of Water,

445
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,420
he said,

446
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,020
These are not concerns that I had

447
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,780
when I was nine or seven.

448
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,860
The Shape of Water doesn't have any elements

449
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,820
that would be regarded

450
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,340
as traditionally Lovecraftian

451
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,860
by purists like Giles

452
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,460
or the teenager I used to be,

453
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,700
but its story gets at what I think

454
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,140
makes Lovecraft actually work

455
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,260
in the first place.

456
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,340
Human stories about our alienation

457
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,180
from each other and our lonelinesses,

458
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,020
our victimization by forces

459
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:56,980
beyond our control

460
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,980
that see us as outside the norm,

461
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,180
and how we can at least

462
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,020
partially rectify this by

463
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,380
learning to see the beauty

464
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,300
in something previously seen as alien.

465
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,180
In a sense,

466
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,100
it's a story about the people of Innsmouth

467
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,780
who happily chose to join

468
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,820
with the Deep Ones,

469
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,980
quite literally embracing otherness,

470
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,580
raising children who literally

471
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,500
learn to love to be different.

472
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,180
Now, the film's perspectives

473
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,620
and plot and texture

474
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,900
make it not really invite

475
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,580
much of a comparison with Lovecraft

476
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,940
in a straightforward viewing,

477
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,500
but maybe that's proof

478
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,780
of how good it is.

479
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,220
The Shape of Water has

480
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,820
so successfully excavated

481
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,020
all the garbage away

482
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,540
from its spiritual predecessor

483
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,900
that despite depicting something

484
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,260
that directly happened

485
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,460
in a story del Toro

486
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,420
has definitely read,

487
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,780
the comparison still feels strange,

488
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,060
wrong almost.

489
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,380
This film captures the beautiful,

490
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,460
human, mesmerizing center

491
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,820
of Lovecraft's writing.

492
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,580
It's the kind of story he could,

493
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,740
or perhaps should,

494
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,340
have been writing all along.

495
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,540
For me, there's something

496
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,980
personally wonderful about

497
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,260
finally really coming to

498
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,380
an understanding of a film

499
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,340
that touched me in ways

500
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,220
I didn't realize

501
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,340
and that never really

502
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,780
got much recognition.

503
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,380
Right as a film that understands

504
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,820
this just as well gets released

505
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,580
and actually gets major recognition

506
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,700
and even wins an Oscar.

507
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,540
I am an immigrant,

508
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,220
unlike many, many of you,

509
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,300
and in the last 25 years,

510
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,980
I've been living in a country

511
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,940
all of our own,

512
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,740
because I think that

513
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,500
the greatest thing our art does

514
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,620
and our industry does

515
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,380
is to erase the lines in the sand.

516
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,780
We should continue doing that

517
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,740
when the world tells us

518
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,700
to make them deeper.

519
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,380
While it's easy and correct

520
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,140
to be dubious about the value

521
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,340
of winning an Oscar,

522
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,020
I do think the success of a film

523
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,940
like this is a really hopeful sign

524
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,300
for the future of how people

525
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,140
see that which is alien to them.

526
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,100
There's a philosopher

527
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,300
named Julia Kristeva

528
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,700
whose work was pretty formative for me.

529
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,500
I discovered her

530
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,700
through her being quoted

531
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,980
in a series of critical essays

532
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,940
on Lovecraft,

533
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,300
one by Gina Whisker,

534
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,460
entitled Spawn of the Pit.

535
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,580
The quote went,

536
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,580
By recognizing our uncanny strangeness,

537
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,940
we shall neither suffer from it

538
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,700
nor enjoy it from the outside.

539
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,220
The foreigner is within me.

540
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,140
Hence, we are all foreigners.

541
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,260
If I am a foreigner,

542
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,100
then there are no foreigners.

543
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,700
Why be alien to each other

544
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,020
when we are all alien to ourselves?

545
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,460
So, what have we learned

546
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,540
about how to adapt Lovecraft?

547
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,300
Well, I think there's a point here

548
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,900
about how we have to decide

549
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,420
what really makes his work good

550
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,380
in the first place,

551
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,620
what the core truths in his work are

552
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,660
that ought to survive

553
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,100
into a future they inspire.

554
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,860
An adaptation, to me at least,

555
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,140
only needs fidelity

556
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,260
to what really matters

557
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,300
about the text,

558
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,740
and neglecting to bring across

559
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,940
other aspects like

560
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,700
the finer points of its philosophy

561
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,340
or its particular linguistic flourishes

562
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,700
or certain characters

563
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,260
or even its racism or homophobia

564
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,260
isn't a failure to be fully faithful

565
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,540
to the original work.

566
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,500
It's demonstrating

567
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,940
a successful understanding

568
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,140
of why those stories

569
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,340
were worth reading about

570
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,220
in the first place

571
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,660
in spite of those flaws.

572
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,740
In focusing on a person's experiences

573
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,340
and treatment for their sexuality

574
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,380
or on a relationship

575
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,820
with someone seen by others

576
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,660
as an alien outsider,

577
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,420
these works explore the originals

578
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,340
and their feelings of otherness

579
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,940
better than Lovecraft did.

580
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,460
You don't have to go find a copy

581
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,460
of this 10-year-old obscure film

582
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,660
if you don't want to.

583
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,180
It's not perfect by any means,

584
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,380
and lots of the criticism

585
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,900
the film's received is valid.

586
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,180
Even the director's commentary

587
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,980
opens by admitting

588
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,660
they aren't fully happy with the film.

589
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,540
There are 85 locations in this movie.

590
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,580
Ridiculous.

591
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,180
It's certainly nowhere near as good

592
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,460
as the best film ever,

593
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,220
Gremlins 2.

594
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,740
But it meant something to me

595
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,180
and was very important to me

596
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,100
in a formative period of my life,

597
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,620
and sometimes that's kind of

598
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,140
more important than the writing

599
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,420
or execution.

600
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,020
As I look out into the internet

601
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,860
and find many other queer fans

602
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,140
of Lovecraft's work

603
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,420
and writers in some form

604
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,580
inspired by these feelings themselves,

605
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,780
the wealth of literature

606
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,620
exploring this side of his writing

607
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,820
and films taking up

608
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,580
radically humanizing perspectives

609
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,180
even towards that which might

610
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,580
literally be considered monstrous,

611
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,620
I can't help but feel

612
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,540
that there's a side of Lovecraft's work

613
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,540
the man himself died

614
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,340
unable to fully comprehend.

615
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,220
And in a way, that's fitting, isn't it?

616
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,900
But there's one other great story

617
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,340
inspired at least partially

618
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,620
by elements of Lovecraft,

619
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,580
and I'm going to talk about it

620
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,340
soon on my channel.

621
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,380
Join me in the future

622
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,700
when I reveal spectacularly

623
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,940
why I filmed segments for this video

624
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,380
at night in the woods.

625
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,300
Oh, I just kind of gave it away then,

626
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,180
didn't I?

627
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:40,180
[♪ music ♪

628
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:40,820
Hey.

629
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,100
Thanks for watching, everybody.

630
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,380
This one was quite hard to make

631
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,380
for reasons that are probably obvious.

632
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,300
I'm supported by all these lovely people

633
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,140
over on Patreon.

634
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,140
Backers get videos a few days early

635
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,980
and also get to make suggestions

636
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,420
on changes before the other version

637
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,220
goes out,

638
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,980
and they get some bonus extra videos

639
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,700
every now and then.

640
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,660
I still need to finish one

641
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,500
about the making of the control delete video,

642
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,860
but there's just so much footage

643
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,580
to cut together.

644
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,180
I'm basically making a little documentary

645
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:07,300
about making this silly YouTube video.

646
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,820
Oh, and since I don't do readings

647
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,500
of the credits outside of longer videos,

648
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,540
I'm trying a new thing

649
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,380
where I stream myself to $10 back

650
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,820
as doing editing

651
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,340
and take live suggestions

652
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,820
and show off my sort of process.

653
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,580
Last night, I did a three-hour stream

654
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,820
of me making changes to this video.

655
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,820
So thanks to Mallow,

656
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,420
who was in the chat and gave me the idea

657
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,660
of pointing out that Huelbeck sucks.

658
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,940
I wasn't sure if I should do it,

659
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,060
so it was nice getting the input

660
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,420
that I probably ought to,

661
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,540
and thanks to everyone else

662
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,900
who singled out other changes

663
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,180
and fixes to mistakes

664
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,460
I can now pretend were never made at all.

665
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,860
I'd also like to say a special thank you

666
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,380
to the over 100 people

667
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,180
who reached out to me

668
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,140
when I asked on Twitter

669
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,660
for LGBT fans of Lovecraft

670
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,500
to get in touch a few months ago.

671
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,700
Your notes and contributions

672
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,660
were really great

673
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,100
and helped me think a lot

674
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,060
about this topic

675
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,140
and helped me ascertain

676
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,460
that it wasn't all just me,

677
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,900
that I wasn't imagining all of this,

678
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,340
that other people felt this way.

679
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,380
You were all really helpful and lovely,

680
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,060
and this video wouldn't exist

681
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,380
without your kindness and support.

682
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,300
I hope everyone had a happy Pride Month.

683
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,780
Not that you have to stop being proud now.

684
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,860
You know, by all means, please continue.

685
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:18,020
I'm going to go back into my hole

686
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,980
and feel sorry for myself

687
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,180
for another 11 months,

688
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,700
but you do whatever makes you feel good.
