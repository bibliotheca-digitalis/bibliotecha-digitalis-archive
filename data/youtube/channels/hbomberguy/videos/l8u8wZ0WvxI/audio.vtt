00:00.000 --> 00:22.560
This is Cthulhu. It's a film that came out in 2008. Not many people appear to have seen

00:22.560 --> 00:24.880
it.

00:24.880 --> 00:29.560
As a teenager, I was obsessed with the works of Howard Phillips Lovecraft. Lovecraft was

00:29.560 --> 00:35.120
a pioneer in Pulp Horror Fiction, immediately gripping with his cavalcade of creative monsters,

00:35.120 --> 00:41.020
epic scope, terrible fates, and a unique philosophy about the terror of the existence of gods

00:41.020 --> 00:45.400
greater than the human consciousness could allow. The man's work was inspirational

00:45.400 --> 00:50.920
and moving to me. It made me think, made me dream, made me want to be a writer. Also,

00:50.920 --> 00:57.160
seeing cool new words like Theosophists, or Non-Euclidean, or sentences like The Blood

00:57.160 --> 01:04.760
Roots grew insolent in their chromatic perversion made me feel smart. I liked thinking I was

01:04.760 --> 01:05.760
smart.

01:05.760 --> 01:08.640
I was a big fan of the role-playing game, too. I just really liked the way that it dealt

01:08.640 --> 01:12.880
with the mythos and how you interact with it, and the way it modeled sanity was really

01:12.880 --> 01:19.200
good, too. And, hang on, can we, can someone find out who did this and why? I've been confused

01:19.200 --> 01:20.840
by this for like a decade now.

01:20.840 --> 01:26.520
As my interest grew and I ran out of stories by, inspired by, or about Lovecraft to read,

01:26.520 --> 01:31.320
I started playing or watching any game or film even remotely based on his work. I'd

01:31.320 --> 01:35.880
seen Re-Animator and its sequels, and From Beyond, and I was even about to watch Hellraiser

01:35.880 --> 01:39.600
when I found an interview with Clive Barker where he said he didn't like Lovecraft's

01:39.600 --> 01:44.160
writing very much and decided not to watch the film out of some misguided sense of spite.

01:44.160 --> 01:49.160
That was how I did things back then, apparently.

01:49.160 --> 01:52.840
I'd heard that Guillermo del Toro was going to adapt At the Mountains of Madness, one

01:52.840 --> 01:56.560
of the best of Lovecraft's stories, and I couldn't wait for that. It turned out

01:56.560 --> 01:59.920
I shouldn't have waited because it didn't happen. It was in development hell for a very

01:59.920 --> 02:01.560
long time, and then it was never greenlit.

02:01.560 --> 02:06.440
Then, as I was scraping the bottom of the barrel and watching fan films on YouTube,

02:06.440 --> 02:11.880
I eventually found out about Cthulhu. It was named after Lovecraft's most famous creation,

02:11.880 --> 02:15.680
and it had been made so recently that it might have been able to take advantage of the kinds

02:15.680 --> 02:20.960
of effects and production techniques possible in modern filmmaking that something of truly

02:20.960 --> 02:27.520
epic scale might actually have been possible. Cthulhu is not that film. Cthulhu isn't in

02:27.520 --> 02:31.800
the film. It isn't even based on the short story The Call of Cthulhu. It's actually

02:31.800 --> 02:37.000
a loose, very loose, interpretation of The Shadow Over Innsmouth. In that story, the

02:37.000 --> 02:41.320
narrator investigates a New England fishing town where the people are strange and unwelcoming

02:41.320 --> 02:45.840
to outsiders. He eventually discovers that the people of the town worship a godlike fish

02:45.840 --> 02:51.320
creature named Dagon and its monstrous children, and have begun breeding with those creatures,

02:51.320 --> 02:55.580
and their descendants eventually transform into monsters themselves to take to the water

02:55.580 --> 03:00.800
and live forever beneath the sea with Dagon. After barely escaping with his life, the narrator

03:00.800 --> 03:06.280
realizes that his family tree comes from Innsmouth, and he is slowly becoming one of them, too,

03:06.280 --> 03:11.680
and he's starting to like it and relish the chance to worship Dagon for all time. It's

03:11.680 --> 03:16.280
a really good story, and it's an excellent example of early 20th century American horror,

03:16.280 --> 03:20.800
with the narrator's final change serving as a genuinely uncomfortable and fascinating

03:20.800 --> 03:26.960
twist. It's really a true classic. This film is about a gay college professor called Russell,

03:26.960 --> 03:30.800
who learns that his mother has passed away and returns to his hometown for her funeral.

03:30.800 --> 03:35.440
Russell's father is the leader of a strange religious cult, and also deeply homophobic,

03:35.440 --> 03:39.760
along with many of the rest of the townspeople. Russell realizes the cult has designs on him

03:39.760 --> 03:44.120
of some kind, and something strange is going on. He reconnects with an old lover from his

03:44.120 --> 03:49.000
past and tries to learn the truth as the people become increasingly hostile towards his search.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.440
In lieu of looking at the tangible specifics of the horror, the beliefs of the cult, or

03:54.440 --> 03:59.400
portraying the monsters from the original story, the film focuses on Russell's own

03:59.400 --> 04:05.000
emotional state, his experiences and dreams, and relation to the people he encounters as

04:05.000 --> 04:09.760
he tries to understand what is happening. When monsters do briefly appear, there's

04:09.760 --> 04:14.960
not really much to see. The story isn't really concerned with them.

04:14.960 --> 04:20.160
When I first saw this film, I decided that I hated it more than any other film. It had

04:20.160 --> 04:25.280
taken something I cared about and enjoyed, and removed the things I thought made it interesting

04:25.280 --> 04:30.160
and valuable. It made an existential horror about god-like creatures that care not for

04:30.160 --> 04:35.120
human affairs into a story where the god in question never turns up or does anything

04:35.120 --> 04:41.360
or is even really talked about in it. And even the name's technically the wrong name

04:41.360 --> 04:46.800
of the god. Oh, and if you put the disc in a PC, the label doesn't even spell Cthulhu

04:46.800 --> 04:53.960
properly! It's such an easy word to spell! The whole film felt like a betrayal. The camera

04:53.960 --> 04:59.760
sometimes sits very still, trapping you with Russell in situations neither of you want

04:59.760 --> 05:03.960
to be in, for conversations he doesn't want to be having with people he doesn't want to

05:03.960 --> 05:04.960
see.

05:04.960 --> 05:07.960
So, um, how's the, uh, how's the church?

05:07.960 --> 05:10.960
How's the gay life treating you, Russell?

05:10.960 --> 05:16.560
It's my life.

05:16.560 --> 05:17.560
Is it satisfying?

05:17.560 --> 05:18.560
Are you fulfilled?

05:18.560 --> 05:21.960
What do you want to know? You want to know what we do?

05:21.960 --> 05:23.960
Danny, please, just stay, stay out of this.

05:24.160 --> 05:30.960
I didn't want any of this. I wanted something big, something epic, something focusing on

05:30.960 --> 05:35.560
the horror of the big monsters, the sheer scope of the cosmos beyond our reach and the

05:35.560 --> 05:40.200
nihilistic implications of being unimportant in the face of seemingly all-powerful things

05:40.200 --> 05:44.680
that can decide our fate on a whim. For so much of it, it was such an uncomfortable and

05:44.680 --> 05:50.520
personal and low-key horror. A human horror I wasn't really prepared for and was sure

05:50.520 --> 05:51.520
I didn't want.

05:54.760 --> 06:01.680
But as I got older and lived a decade of new experiences, to put it simply, I grew up.

06:01.680 --> 06:05.480
I just sort of realized one day that I was capable of being romantically attracted to

06:05.480 --> 06:10.680
men as well as women. I realized I was different from how I'd even thought of myself. I'd

06:10.680 --> 06:15.680
just sort of naturally seen myself as straight, and even if I didn't think I thought of it

06:15.680 --> 06:21.640
this way, on some primal level, I'd thought of being straight as being normal. I didn't

06:21.640 --> 06:25.400
know why I thought like that. It's probably a mix of not really thinking too hard about

06:25.400 --> 06:30.160
these things at the time combined with the vague notions and expectations our society

06:30.160 --> 06:34.440
tends to have towards people's sexuality. But one day I looked in the mirror and saw

06:34.440 --> 06:42.600
myself as not who I thought I was. I saw myself as an outsider from me, from the identity

06:42.600 --> 06:47.920
I'd assumed for myself. And then I had a few difficult conversations with troublesome

06:47.920 --> 06:52.620
people about those feelings. I'd always experienced termophobia. I was an effeminate

06:52.620 --> 06:57.200
boy growing up, but I hadn't really cared because at the time I'd not really accepted

06:57.200 --> 07:01.680
it as an insult or seen anything wrong with being called gay by losers in high school

07:01.680 --> 07:06.260
who had just as much growing up to do as I did. But when I actually was one of those

07:06.260 --> 07:11.800
people and knew it, all of a sudden it was a real judgment of who I actually was. To

07:11.800 --> 07:17.620
them I'd actually become lesser. Being told I was going to die of AIDS and that my feelings

07:17.620 --> 07:23.980
were unnatural and so on, and having to deal with being actually expected to try to convince

07:23.980 --> 07:29.140
people that I wasn't inferior to them, suddenly made me think about that Cthulhu film I'd

07:29.140 --> 07:35.900
seen a few years before. It was like it knew what I was going through. It knew how it felt

07:35.900 --> 07:41.940
to sit in a room you just can't leave and have a piece of your personhood interrogated.

07:41.940 --> 07:48.060
It knew how it felt to be seen as an outsider, and it knew how it felt to connect with someone

07:48.060 --> 07:53.700
who understands and accepts you. Somehow it knew me and how I'd felt before I'd ever

07:53.700 --> 07:58.940
had a chance to. Some of the scenes from this film just kept coming back up in my mind.

07:58.940 --> 08:04.460
It hadn't been what I'd thought I'd wanted, but what it was struck a chord with me anyway

08:04.460 --> 08:09.740
on a level I didn't know was there. It just took a while for me to hear the chiming.

08:09.740 --> 08:14.700
It turns out that some of the greatest horrors, biggest sources of sadness in our lives, don't

08:14.700 --> 08:19.580
come from scope or big questions, but from the tiniest things. If you've ever lost

08:19.580 --> 08:23.300
a loved one and had to be involved with the arrangements of their funeral, or if you've

08:23.300 --> 08:26.820
ever had to be around someone you'd made an effort to cut out of your life because

08:26.820 --> 08:31.380
of something abusive they'd done to you, or even something as simple as being reminded,

08:31.380 --> 08:35.380
gently, that you're in a place where everyone regards you with suspicion, that you're

08:35.380 --> 08:40.020
an outsider to them, you'll already know that the idea of a powerful cosmic monster

08:40.020 --> 08:44.860
out there somewhere beneath the sea can actually be the least of a person's problems.

08:44.860 --> 08:49.700
The film was, in retrospect, a meaningful and valuable work that paid respect to the

08:49.700 --> 08:55.240
source material's themes and emotions in ways I hadn't grasped as a cynical kid who

08:55.240 --> 09:00.860
thought he knew he was straight and thought he knew what made Lovecraft good, and I just

09:00.860 --> 09:04.340
wasn't ready to appreciate the value of that kind of story at the time.

09:04.500 --> 09:09.140
Here's a review from back in 2009 on the film's Amazon page by someone called Giles.

09:09.140 --> 09:10.500
Giles writes...

09:10.500 --> 09:16.020
I can't stress how bad this film is on every level. As for H.P. Lovecraft, he must be spinning

09:16.020 --> 09:21.100
in his grave, because this is definitely the worst film adaptation yet. It is vaguely based

09:21.100 --> 09:26.100
on Shadow over Innsmouth, but the story, what there is of it, is so badly constructed that

09:26.100 --> 09:28.660
you could easily miss the very few similarities.

09:28.660 --> 09:31.540
And why all the gay subplot? What was that all about?

09:31.540 --> 09:35.540
Now, here's the thing about Giles from 2009.

09:35.540 --> 09:38.820
I was Giles in 2009.

09:38.820 --> 09:43.540
No, I'm fairly certain I didn't write this exact Amazon review, but I felt the same way

09:43.540 --> 09:48.340
as this person at around the same time. It didn't make sense to the teenage me whose

09:48.340 --> 09:52.260
main frame of reference on the world was the horror stories he'd read, but then I grew

09:52.260 --> 09:55.780
up and it started making a lot more sense without me even having to go back and see

09:55.780 --> 09:56.820
the film again.

09:56.820 --> 10:01.140
This film and its delayed effect on me got me thinking about what works about Lovecraft's

10:01.220 --> 10:05.540
stories, what doesn't, and what the best way might be to navigate these qualities in

10:05.540 --> 10:07.700
creating an adaptation.

10:07.700 --> 10:13.620
And along the way, with a lot of encouragement, and if it's not too awkward, we'll maybe

10:13.620 --> 10:19.780
talk about the fact that a writer who basically founded a subgenre of fiction has been hugely

10:19.780 --> 10:26.020
influential and made so many people want to become writers, including myself, was really

10:26.020 --> 10:28.020
massively racist.

10:28.020 --> 10:34.740
INTRO

10:34.740 --> 10:37.780
Anyway, let's start at the beginning, shall we?

10:37.780 --> 10:41.620
Why do humans create and tell each other stories?

10:41.620 --> 10:45.540
Yeah, I'm sure we can settle that real quick, we've only been asking that question for

10:45.540 --> 10:47.060
a millennia.

10:47.060 --> 10:55.940
I can solve that, I've got a plaque for surpassing over 100,000 YouTube subscribers.

10:55.940 --> 11:00.500
Firstly, we should acknowledge that fiction isn't simply the opposite of truth, it is,

11:00.500 --> 11:03.460
in some sense, a reflection of truth.

11:03.460 --> 11:04.740
Let's look at horror stories.

11:04.740 --> 11:10.100
When a ghost story speaks of a place being haunted by the past, it speaks to us about

11:10.100 --> 11:15.300
the ways that really does happen, the ways the world controls and decides things for

11:15.300 --> 11:20.020
us, and how the legacy, the result of other people's decisions, are still here with

11:20.020 --> 11:22.660
us even after the people who made them are gone.

11:22.660 --> 11:26.500
The ghosts of the past really do haunt the present they built.

11:26.500 --> 11:32.180
Vampires, similarly, tend to be impactful because they reflect some true aspect of the

11:32.180 --> 11:34.260
society that was writing about them at the time.

11:34.260 --> 11:36.500
There's a reason Dracula was a count.

11:36.500 --> 11:42.180
Vampires are aristocratic, upper-class beings that live by parasitically consuming the essence

11:42.180 --> 11:46.580
of the poor workers and exploiting people using their influence, either their literal

11:46.580 --> 11:49.940
riches or their other, less tangible powers.

11:49.940 --> 11:54.500
And in doing this, they literalize a very real but much more vague social antagonism.

11:54.500 --> 11:59.140
The aristocracies, monarchies, and other rich and powerful figures over history rarely actually

11:59.140 --> 12:02.820
drink people's blood for sustenance, although the way the current economy is going, who

12:02.820 --> 12:06.180
knows, but the rich really are vampires, in a sense.

12:06.180 --> 12:10.420
They really do profit and thrive from the work and sacrifice of those beneath them.

12:10.420 --> 12:14.180
It's not unimaginable that consciousness of this kind of antagonism makes its way

12:14.180 --> 12:19.380
into folklore as creatures that are only slightly more exaggerated forms of the actual power

12:19.380 --> 12:22.660
relationships between rich and poor people, or boss and worker.

12:22.660 --> 12:24.180
Bram Stoker?

12:24.180 --> 12:26.980
More like Gram-shee Stoker?

12:28.660 --> 12:31.300
Uh, doesn't really work, does it?

12:32.340 --> 12:35.860
Is there a better Marxist thinker who would work here as a pun?

12:35.860 --> 12:38.580
Let me know in the comments so I can feel like an idiot for missing it.

12:38.580 --> 12:42.260
When you're reading Dracula, you're not just reading a creative horror about a scary

12:42.260 --> 12:47.060
monster, you're reading a story that most people, on some level, understand.

12:47.060 --> 12:51.860
It's relevant to the world people live in, where a non-magical version of Dracula's

12:51.860 --> 12:56.580
immense influence and theft of livelihood from ordinary people really does happen.

12:56.580 --> 13:02.420
Notably, even Karl Marx repeatedly used vampirism as a way of describing the nature of capitalism

13:02.420 --> 13:03.700
in Das Kapital.

13:03.700 --> 13:08.580
Look, my point here isn't that vampire stories are all secretly about how capitalism is bad

13:08.580 --> 13:13.060
or something, that would be ridiculous, and so many of them were written before the actual

13:13.060 --> 13:15.860
proper invention of capitalism as we know it today.

13:15.860 --> 13:22.100
My point is that it was a way of talking about issues that functioned so well that

13:22.100 --> 13:26.980
when the time came to actually talk about things like capitalism, the guy who started

13:26.980 --> 13:34.260
talking about it used vampires as a way of talking about it, which usually means that

13:34.260 --> 13:38.660
the stories were onto something that was kind of, like, real, something that was there.

13:38.660 --> 13:43.300
It's also notable that Fifty Shades of Grey, originally a fanfiction based on Twilight,

13:43.300 --> 13:44.820
kinda does this too.

13:44.820 --> 13:49.380
It takes out all the major supernatural aspects of Twilight and, of course, the simplest way

13:49.380 --> 13:54.180
of bringing the dynamics between a magical, immortal vampire and a young, innocent teenage

13:54.180 --> 13:58.980
girl into the real world is to reimagine the vampire as a billionaire with immense influence

13:58.980 --> 14:01.300
and a very particular sexual taste.

14:01.300 --> 14:04.340
Look, the richer vampires, basically, I think have made this point.

14:04.340 --> 14:06.740
The Slasher film also embodies this as well.

14:06.740 --> 14:11.300
The killer in Slasher stories is an urban, modern creature which expresses modern, urban

14:12.020 --> 14:15.860
The fear of what's happening in the neighborhood behind everyone's closed doors where they

14:15.860 --> 14:17.380
could be getting up to just about anything.

14:17.380 --> 14:20.580
The fear of the effects of modern living on people growing up in it.

14:20.580 --> 14:24.260
Fellow YouTuber Nick's Fears did a really cool video going into the deeper aspects of

14:24.260 --> 14:27.060
this in Halloween, which you can check out linked in the description.

14:27.060 --> 14:30.500
It's good and long and fun and please go watch it.

14:30.500 --> 14:37.300
The Slasher films are silly, gross, gory, and often just kind of bad, but they got popular

14:37.300 --> 14:40.820
because they're dealing with something that's real and actually happening.

14:41.460 --> 14:54.420
Okay, that's not actually happening in real life, but that's from like part eight of a

14:54.420 --> 15:00.740
franchise and you don't get seven sequels without at least originally having some resonating

15:00.740 --> 15:01.300
cultural.

15:02.900 --> 15:04.420
He punches his head into a bin.

15:04.980 --> 15:06.740
You get a perspective shot of it.

15:06.740 --> 15:10.020
It's like you're looking out of his head as it flies off.

15:10.020 --> 15:14.340
The idea that fiction is not the opposite of facts, but actually can be more truthful

15:14.340 --> 15:18.740
than facts on their own is key to what makes storytelling so important.

15:18.740 --> 15:24.740
Art is all lies, all perceptions, always subjective, always up for further interpretation,

15:24.740 --> 15:27.860
and always slanted by the perspectives of its creators.

15:27.860 --> 15:30.980
But art is lies in service to truth.

15:31.700 --> 15:34.500
Bringing all of this back, what of Lovecraft?

15:34.500 --> 15:39.780
What makes his work in particular continue to be remembered alongside Dracula or Halloween

15:39.780 --> 15:43.060
and act as direct inspiration for yet more creative works?

15:43.060 --> 15:45.460
What truth is hidden within his fiction?

15:46.020 --> 15:48.260
Well, it might be the existential horror.

15:48.260 --> 15:51.780
His works come together to relate a thoroughly nihilistic universe,

15:51.780 --> 15:55.940
wholly uncaring about our existence, and there may well be a truth to that,

15:55.940 --> 16:00.660
but it isn't whether or not human existence actually matters that's central to his work.

16:00.660 --> 16:04.180
It's not quite the idea of that stuff actually being true,

16:04.660 --> 16:10.260
but rather the direct feeling of being unimportant in the grand scheme of things.

16:10.260 --> 16:14.020
Lovecraft's writing and tropes function in this regard a lot like one of the writers

16:14.020 --> 16:16.820
who in turn inspired him, Edgar Allan Poe.

16:16.820 --> 16:19.540
Poe doesn't exactly make people feel good.

16:19.540 --> 16:22.900
Rather, he makes them feel sad in a productive way.

16:22.900 --> 16:26.580
It can make people who are prone to those feelings feel less alone

16:26.580 --> 16:29.140
because they know others have them too.

16:29.140 --> 16:33.380
The Call of Cthulhu doesn't begin by telling you how scary a big monster could be

16:33.380 --> 16:36.580
or giving you a description of what its tentacles would look like.

16:36.580 --> 16:41.380
It opens with a profound fear of the future and of what discoveries might lie there.

16:41.380 --> 16:46.180
The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little,

16:46.180 --> 16:48.980
but someday the piecing together of dissociated knowledge

16:48.980 --> 16:53.860
will open up such terrifying vistas of reality and of our frightful position therein

16:53.860 --> 16:56.500
that we shall either go mad from the revelation

16:56.500 --> 17:01.140
or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.

17:01.220 --> 17:04.820
So what mattered wasn't how creative or imaginative his stories got,

17:04.820 --> 17:08.180
but how they related to people's own feelings of unimportance

17:08.180 --> 17:10.580
then and now in the actual world.

17:10.580 --> 17:13.620
There's the old joke that a paranoid person,

17:13.620 --> 17:16.500
if they were ever to discover the room that the government spied on them from

17:16.500 --> 17:18.260
with all the notes on their lives,

17:18.260 --> 17:21.460
they wouldn't actually be any more afraid because of this.

17:21.460 --> 17:23.220
They'd feel validated.

17:23.220 --> 17:24.740
They weren't paranoid.

17:24.740 --> 17:25.860
They were right.

17:25.860 --> 17:29.780
And through that lens, Lovecraft is a way of feeling completely assured

17:29.780 --> 17:32.740
that the world really is out to get you,

17:32.740 --> 17:36.340
and maybe God doesn't care or hates you or wants you dead.

17:36.340 --> 17:38.740
You can use special effects to design something scarier

17:38.740 --> 17:40.820
than the man himself could ever have imagined,

17:40.820 --> 17:44.820
but that alone isn't actually the thing that's scary about the story.

17:44.820 --> 17:47.940
What's scary is the way these smaller aspects build

17:47.940 --> 17:52.020
to create a sense that humans are tiny and powerless creatures,

17:52.020 --> 17:54.340
that the greatest height we can aspire to

17:54.340 --> 17:59.700
is a deep and intimate understanding of just how little we understand.

17:59.700 --> 18:02.740
Lovecraft rarely reused his creations between stories,

18:02.740 --> 18:06.980
and that's because the creatures he came up with didn't really matter.

18:06.980 --> 18:08.820
They were interchangeable,

18:08.820 --> 18:11.380
and the ideas they existed to communicate

18:11.380 --> 18:14.340
with their scope and alienness was what mattered.

18:14.340 --> 18:19.060
Unfortunately, however, this is where things get a bit hairy and complicated.

18:19.060 --> 18:21.380
One of Lovecraft's most famous quotes goes,

18:21.380 --> 18:24.420
"'The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear,

18:24.420 --> 18:28.500
and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.'"

18:28.500 --> 18:30.500
And you know what this guy didn't know much about?

18:31.140 --> 18:33.380
People of other races.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.780
Look, we've managed to brush past it,

18:35.780 --> 18:40.580
but we do have to talk about Lovecraft's racism, sexism,

18:41.460 --> 18:43.780
antisemitism, and homophobia.

18:45.460 --> 18:46.500
It's happening now.

18:47.780 --> 18:51.460
So for the folks out there who don't think you can criticize an author's beliefs

18:51.460 --> 18:54.900
just because it was a different time and it happened 100 years ago,

18:55.460 --> 18:56.500
thanks for watching.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.100
Don't forget to like and subscribe.

18:58.100 --> 18:59.220
I'll see you next time.

18:59.220 --> 19:02.500
I promise I'll review a game and make some jokes or something in the next one.

19:05.460 --> 19:06.020
Are they gone?

19:07.380 --> 19:08.420
Okay, they're gone.

19:08.420 --> 19:13.460
Right, so it's pop-culturally quite well known that Lovecraft was a bit xenophobic,

19:13.460 --> 19:16.660
and I do remember reading some pretty bad stuff,

19:16.660 --> 19:18.420
but it was a while ago that I read it,

19:18.420 --> 19:20.500
and I'm sure it can't be as bad as I remember.

19:20.500 --> 19:24.420
What the fuck is nautical looking supposed to mean, Howard?

19:24.420 --> 19:25.940
What does it even mean?

19:28.100 --> 19:32.420
...

19:32.420 --> 19:35.460
In his biography of H.P. Lovecraft, fittingly entitled

19:35.460 --> 19:38.020
Against the World Against Life,

19:38.020 --> 19:39.780
Michel Houellebecq writes,

19:39.780 --> 19:42.100
The character of Lovecraft fascinates us,

19:42.100 --> 19:45.860
partly because his system of values is entirely opposed to ours.

19:45.860 --> 19:48.340
Fundamentally racist, openly reactionary,

19:48.340 --> 19:52.180
he glorifies Puritan inhibition and quite evidently finds repellent

19:52.180 --> 19:54.420
any open display of eroticism.

19:54.420 --> 19:56.980
Resolutely anti-commercial, he despises money,

19:56.980 --> 20:00.500
considers democracy to be pure folly, progress an illusion.

20:00.500 --> 20:05.140
The word liberty, so dear to Americans, elicits from him only a gloomy sneer.

20:05.140 --> 20:08.740
All his life he maintained a typically aristocratic attitude of scorn

20:08.740 --> 20:12.180
for humanity in general together with an extreme solicitude

20:12.180 --> 20:14.420
toward individuals in person.

20:14.420 --> 20:17.380
Houellebecq kinda sucks, honestly,

20:17.380 --> 20:20.740
and idolizes some of Lovecraft's worst qualities in his biography,

20:20.740 --> 20:23.140
but this quote is helpful in illustrating the specifics

20:23.140 --> 20:25.300
of Lovecraft's worldview, so I'm gonna use it.

20:25.300 --> 20:28.260
A stopped clock is right twice a day, I suppose.

20:28.260 --> 20:31.140
Lovecraft seemingly hated society itself,

20:31.140 --> 20:33.540
but he had a deeper and specific dislike

20:33.540 --> 20:36.180
for Black and Jewish people along with immigrants.

20:36.180 --> 20:40.340
It's so prevalent in his writing that even citing multiple examples

20:40.340 --> 20:43.460
would kind of diminish how overwhelming and constant it is.

20:43.460 --> 20:48.020
I can't even bring myself to say the name of Lovecraft's cat

20:48.020 --> 20:49.860
because it's a racial slur.

20:49.860 --> 20:54.100
And despite this obviously completely full schedule of racism

20:54.100 --> 20:56.820
and general hatred for humanity itself,

20:56.820 --> 20:59.940
he also managed to find time to be a raging homophobe.

20:59.940 --> 21:02.660
He claimed not to have even known homosexuality existed

21:02.660 --> 21:04.340
until he was in his 30s,

21:04.340 --> 21:07.860
but then he goes on to immediately compare it to being a pederast.

21:07.860 --> 21:10.900
You know, growing up, I always would immediately try to find ways

21:10.900 --> 21:13.860
to write off or handwave away the racism.

21:13.860 --> 21:17.060
You know, I would say, well, it was a part of his time.

21:17.060 --> 21:19.940
I never really just sat down and gave myself the opportunity

21:19.940 --> 21:22.900
to just say, God, what a piece of shit.

21:24.100 --> 21:27.620
I mean, honestly, like, his work meant something to me

21:27.620 --> 21:29.780
in a really, like, profound way

21:29.780 --> 21:31.460
that no other work has ever really done,

21:32.340 --> 21:34.900
but I fucking think the guy's terrible.

21:34.900 --> 21:38.500
As a side note, Lovecraft's views apparently softened a little bit over time.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.340
In a letter he wrote a month before his death,

21:40.340 --> 21:42.340
he claimed he understood the blindness

21:42.340 --> 21:44.340
and defiant ignorance of reactionaries

21:44.340 --> 21:45.940
because he used to be one.

21:45.940 --> 21:49.140
"'I know how smugly ignorant I was,' he wrote.

21:49.140 --> 21:51.780
He supposedly became a socialist in the last year of his life

21:51.780 --> 21:53.060
and supported the New Deal,

21:53.060 --> 21:55.300
and he was married to a Jewish woman for a while,

21:55.300 --> 21:58.900
but it's debatable whether he really developed all that much,

21:58.980 --> 22:02.500
and the racism in his work is still unavoidably there.'"

22:02.500 --> 22:05.780
And this leads us to a very weird and difficult question.

22:06.820 --> 22:09.780
Why are there queer Lovecraft fans?

22:10.820 --> 22:12.020
Why do I exist?

22:12.980 --> 22:15.460
And why do so many people like me exist?

22:15.460 --> 22:18.340
Why is this space a place for a lot of queer

22:18.340 --> 22:20.420
and marginalized people in the first place?

22:21.140 --> 22:23.860
Why does his work resonate so well

22:24.580 --> 22:28.820
with people who the man himself would have hated even more

22:29.060 --> 22:30.500
than he hated everyone else?

22:31.300 --> 22:37.540
Now, I don't think I'm qualified to answer this question.

22:37.540 --> 22:40.580
I don't actually think anyone really is.

22:41.380 --> 22:43.140
There's probably a lot of different reasons,

22:44.020 --> 22:46.580
but from what I can gather,

22:47.300 --> 22:50.100
it seems like the answer lies in the specifics

22:50.100 --> 22:52.100
of how Lovecraft saw the world,

22:52.100 --> 22:55.460
in the place that his approach actually came from.

22:55.460 --> 22:57.300
"'When Lovecraft was three years old,

22:57.300 --> 22:58.500
his father had a breakdown

22:58.500 --> 23:00.100
and was committed to a mental hospital.

23:00.100 --> 23:01.700
He died there five years later.

23:01.700 --> 23:04.340
His mother also frequently suffered from similar problems

23:04.340 --> 23:06.740
and later died in the same hospital.

23:06.740 --> 23:10.100
Lovecraft suffered from periods of severe anxiety and depression.

23:10.100 --> 23:11.540
He had to drop out of high school

23:11.540 --> 23:14.340
and often isolated himself for long periods at a time.

23:14.340 --> 23:16.660
He saw himself as a temporary visitor

23:16.660 --> 23:18.660
to a strange and unwelcoming world.

23:18.660 --> 23:21.860
This is present even in one of Lovecraft's earliest stories,

23:21.860 --> 23:23.140
The Outsider.

23:23.140 --> 23:26.420
The narrator escapes from being trapped within a decaying castle,

23:26.420 --> 23:28.820
but his search for human contact is frustrated

23:28.820 --> 23:31.380
when the people he finds run away in horror.

23:31.380 --> 23:34.340
He turns and sees a detestable and ghoulish creature

23:34.340 --> 23:35.700
has entered the room.

23:35.700 --> 23:39.060
To his shock, he realizes he's looking into a mirror."

23:39.060 --> 23:41.860
All of his best works draw into close focus

23:41.860 --> 23:44.500
not some generic fear of outsiders,

23:45.220 --> 23:49.860
but the anxieties and fears that come with being an outsider,

23:50.420 --> 23:53.860
of being in a world that doesn't really understand you,

23:53.860 --> 23:58.180
and perhaps of not being fully able to understand yourself.

23:58.180 --> 24:00.340
So there is a fairly decent reason here

24:00.340 --> 24:02.340
why someone might be drawn to these works,

24:02.340 --> 24:04.820
even if the author was deeply problematic.

24:04.820 --> 24:07.300
And this appears to have been true to some degree

24:07.300 --> 24:08.900
at the time in a strange way.

24:08.900 --> 24:10.900
Lovecraft was pretty open about the problems

24:10.900 --> 24:12.420
he had with homosexuality.

24:12.420 --> 24:15.300
However, several of his closest friends were gay,

24:15.300 --> 24:18.260
including the poets Hart Crane and Samuel Loveman

24:18.260 --> 24:19.620
and Robert Hayward Barlow,

24:19.620 --> 24:21.940
who he worked closely with on numerous stories

24:21.940 --> 24:24.740
and who Lovecraft made the executor of his literary estate

24:24.740 --> 24:25.860
in the event of his death.

24:25.860 --> 24:27.380
It's partially due to Barlow

24:27.380 --> 24:28.900
that so much of Lovecraft's writing

24:28.900 --> 24:30.260
has been preserved over the years,

24:30.260 --> 24:32.900
given how he wasn't all that popular at the time.

24:32.900 --> 24:34.900
The deeply bigoted belief in a link

24:34.900 --> 24:36.820
between homosexuality and pedophilia

24:36.820 --> 24:38.740
is invoked, this time on purpose,

24:38.740 --> 24:39.940
in the film as well.

24:39.940 --> 24:42.100
There's a scene in Cthulhu where Russell is arrested

24:42.100 --> 24:44.660
on manufactured charges of being a pedophile.

24:44.660 --> 24:46.580
-"You're under arrest for murder." -"Oh, come on."

24:46.580 --> 24:48.260
-"Rape of a minor." -"Oh, wait, you can't--"

24:48.260 --> 24:50.020
-"Trespass--" -"The event is positioned

24:50.020 --> 24:51.700
as an extension of his mistreatment

24:51.700 --> 24:53.140
by the rest of the town.

24:53.140 --> 24:54.900
We're seeing the kind of alienation

24:54.900 --> 24:57.300
the original stories had to invent a foreign cult

24:57.300 --> 24:58.420
to get across,

24:58.420 --> 25:00.900
but translated into actual things

25:00.900 --> 25:02.580
people do experience."

25:02.580 --> 25:05.300
-"Oh, yeah, you like this? Faggot goes off to jail?"

25:05.300 --> 25:07.140
The easiness and convenience

25:07.140 --> 25:09.140
with which having a different sexual preference

25:09.140 --> 25:10.740
is equated with criminality

25:10.740 --> 25:13.940
is something that real people deal with even today.

25:13.940 --> 25:14.660
For some people,

25:14.660 --> 25:17.140
the intellectualized existential problems

25:17.140 --> 25:19.460
Lovecraft had originally written to explore

25:19.460 --> 25:20.900
cease to be theoretical

25:20.900 --> 25:23.140
and start to communicate familiar experiences

25:23.140 --> 25:25.220
the same way Edgar Allan Poe's writing can be

25:25.220 --> 25:26.820
to someone who's lost a loved one,

25:26.820 --> 25:28.500
or the way Halloween explores

25:28.500 --> 25:30.340
the suburban fear of one's neighbors,

25:30.340 --> 25:33.060
or Dracula puts words to a deeper understanding

25:33.060 --> 25:34.980
of the antagonism between different classes

25:34.980 --> 25:36.500
in our social hierarchy.

25:36.500 --> 25:38.580
For those who've been treated like this

25:38.580 --> 25:39.860
in the name of a religion

25:39.860 --> 25:42.100
or simply by their surrounding society

25:42.100 --> 25:44.340
because of its horrific expectations,

25:44.340 --> 25:47.220
have they not come the closest a person can

25:47.220 --> 25:48.500
in the real world

25:48.500 --> 25:50.980
to the central Lovecraftian experience?

25:50.980 --> 25:52.420
Have they not, in a sense,

25:52.420 --> 25:54.740
glimpsed the face of an uncaring universe?

25:59.700 --> 26:02.580
-"He was a guy that definitely did not get laid much,

26:03.140 --> 26:04.740
you know, and a guy that was

26:06.180 --> 26:07.780
an alien amongst us."

26:08.340 --> 26:10.100
Del Toro still hasn't gotten to make

26:10.100 --> 26:11.620
the Mountains of Madness adaptation

26:11.620 --> 26:13.700
he wanted to make and I wanted to see,

26:13.700 --> 26:14.820
but what's weird is,

26:14.820 --> 26:15.700
as I've grown older

26:15.700 --> 26:17.060
and become more interested in stories

26:17.060 --> 26:18.020
that are more compelling

26:18.020 --> 26:19.540
than Lovecraft's original works,

26:19.540 --> 26:21.540
it seems that Del Toro has as well.

26:21.540 --> 26:23.780
In a recent interview about The Shape of Water,

26:23.780 --> 26:24.420
he said,

26:34.420 --> 26:36.020
These are not concerns that I had

26:36.020 --> 26:37.780
when I was nine or seven.

26:37.780 --> 26:39.860
The Shape of Water doesn't have any elements

26:39.860 --> 26:40.820
that would be regarded

26:40.820 --> 26:42.340
as traditionally Lovecraftian

26:42.340 --> 26:43.860
by purists like Giles

26:43.860 --> 26:45.460
or the teenager I used to be,

26:45.540 --> 26:47.700
but its story gets at what I think

26:47.700 --> 26:49.140
makes Lovecraft actually work

26:49.140 --> 26:50.260
in the first place.

26:50.260 --> 26:52.340
Human stories about our alienation

26:52.340 --> 26:54.180
from each other and our lonelinesses,

26:54.180 --> 26:56.020
our victimization by forces

26:56.020 --> 26:56.980
beyond our control

26:56.980 --> 26:58.980
that see us as outside the norm,

26:58.980 --> 27:00.180
and how we can at least

27:00.180 --> 27:02.020
partially rectify this by

27:02.020 --> 27:03.380
learning to see the beauty

27:03.380 --> 27:05.300
in something previously seen as alien.

27:05.300 --> 27:06.180
In a sense,

27:06.180 --> 27:08.100
it's a story about the people of Innsmouth

27:08.100 --> 27:09.780
who happily chose to join

27:09.780 --> 27:10.820
with the Deep Ones,

27:10.820 --> 27:12.980
quite literally embracing otherness,

27:12.980 --> 27:14.580
raising children who literally

27:14.580 --> 27:16.500
learn to love to be different.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.180
Now, the film's perspectives

27:18.180 --> 27:19.620
and plot and texture

27:19.620 --> 27:20.900
make it not really invite

27:20.900 --> 27:22.580
much of a comparison with Lovecraft

27:22.580 --> 27:23.940
in a straightforward viewing,

27:24.580 --> 27:26.500
but maybe that's proof

27:26.500 --> 27:27.780
of how good it is.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.220
The Shape of Water has

27:29.220 --> 27:30.820
so successfully excavated

27:30.820 --> 27:32.020
all the garbage away

27:32.020 --> 27:33.540
from its spiritual predecessor

27:33.540 --> 27:34.900
that despite depicting something

27:34.900 --> 27:36.260
that directly happened

27:36.260 --> 27:37.460
in a story del Toro

27:37.460 --> 27:38.420
has definitely read,

27:38.980 --> 27:41.780
the comparison still feels strange,

27:41.780 --> 27:43.060
wrong almost.

27:43.060 --> 27:45.380
This film captures the beautiful,

27:45.380 --> 27:47.460
human, mesmerizing center

27:47.460 --> 27:48.820
of Lovecraft's writing.

27:48.820 --> 27:50.580
It's the kind of story he could,

27:51.220 --> 27:52.740
or perhaps should,

27:52.740 --> 27:54.340
have been writing all along.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.540
For me, there's something

27:55.540 --> 27:56.980
personally wonderful about

27:56.980 --> 27:58.260
finally really coming to

27:58.260 --> 27:59.380
an understanding of a film

27:59.380 --> 28:00.340
that touched me in ways

28:00.340 --> 28:01.220
I didn't realize

28:01.220 --> 28:02.340
and that never really

28:02.340 --> 28:03.780
got much recognition.

28:03.780 --> 28:05.380
Right as a film that understands

28:05.380 --> 28:06.820
this just as well gets released

28:06.820 --> 28:08.580
and actually gets major recognition

28:08.580 --> 28:09.700
and even wins an Oscar.

28:10.100 --> 28:11.540
I am an immigrant,

28:11.540 --> 28:13.220
unlike many, many of you,

28:13.220 --> 28:15.300
and in the last 25 years,

28:15.300 --> 28:16.980
I've been living in a country

28:16.980 --> 28:17.940
all of our own,

28:17.940 --> 28:18.740
because I think that

28:18.740 --> 28:20.500
the greatest thing our art does

28:20.500 --> 28:21.620
and our industry does

28:21.620 --> 28:23.380
is to erase the lines in the sand.

28:23.940 --> 28:25.780
We should continue doing that

28:25.780 --> 28:26.740
when the world tells us

28:26.740 --> 28:27.700
to make them deeper.

28:29.220 --> 28:31.380
While it's easy and correct

28:31.380 --> 28:33.140
to be dubious about the value

28:33.140 --> 28:34.340
of winning an Oscar,

28:34.340 --> 28:36.020
I do think the success of a film

28:36.020 --> 28:37.940
like this is a really hopeful sign

28:37.940 --> 28:39.300
for the future of how people

28:39.380 --> 28:41.140
see that which is alien to them.

28:41.140 --> 28:42.100
There's a philosopher

28:42.100 --> 28:43.300
named Julia Kristeva

28:43.300 --> 28:45.700
whose work was pretty formative for me.

28:45.700 --> 28:46.500
I discovered her

28:46.500 --> 28:47.700
through her being quoted

28:47.700 --> 28:48.980
in a series of critical essays

28:48.980 --> 28:49.940
on Lovecraft,

28:49.940 --> 28:51.300
one by Gina Whisker,

28:51.300 --> 28:53.460
entitled Spawn of the Pit.

28:53.460 --> 28:54.580
The quote went,

28:54.580 --> 28:56.580
By recognizing our uncanny strangeness,

28:56.580 --> 28:57.940
we shall neither suffer from it

28:57.940 --> 28:59.700
nor enjoy it from the outside.

28:59.700 --> 29:01.220
The foreigner is within me.

29:01.220 --> 29:03.140
Hence, we are all foreigners.

29:03.140 --> 29:04.260
If I am a foreigner,

29:04.260 --> 29:06.100
then there are no foreigners.

29:06.100 --> 29:07.700
Why be alien to each other

29:07.700 --> 29:10.020
when we are all alien to ourselves?

29:11.940 --> 29:13.460
So, what have we learned

29:13.460 --> 29:15.540
about how to adapt Lovecraft?

29:15.540 --> 29:17.300
Well, I think there's a point here

29:17.300 --> 29:18.900
about how we have to decide

29:18.900 --> 29:20.420
what really makes his work good

29:20.420 --> 29:21.380
in the first place,

29:21.380 --> 29:23.620
what the core truths in his work are

29:23.620 --> 29:24.660
that ought to survive

29:24.660 --> 29:26.100
into a future they inspire.

29:26.100 --> 29:27.860
An adaptation, to me at least,

29:27.860 --> 29:29.140
only needs fidelity

29:29.140 --> 29:30.260
to what really matters

29:30.260 --> 29:31.300
about the text,

29:31.300 --> 29:32.740
and neglecting to bring across

29:32.740 --> 29:33.940
other aspects like

29:33.940 --> 29:35.700
the finer points of its philosophy

29:35.700 --> 29:38.340
or its particular linguistic flourishes

29:38.340 --> 29:39.700
or certain characters

29:39.700 --> 29:42.260
or even its racism or homophobia

29:42.260 --> 29:44.260
isn't a failure to be fully faithful

29:44.260 --> 29:45.540
to the original work.

29:45.540 --> 29:46.500
It's demonstrating

29:46.500 --> 29:47.940
a successful understanding

29:47.940 --> 29:49.140
of why those stories

29:49.140 --> 29:50.340
were worth reading about

29:50.340 --> 29:51.220
in the first place

29:51.220 --> 29:52.660
in spite of those flaws.

29:52.660 --> 29:54.740
In focusing on a person's experiences

29:54.740 --> 29:56.340
and treatment for their sexuality

29:56.340 --> 29:57.380
or on a relationship

29:57.380 --> 29:58.820
with someone seen by others

29:58.820 --> 30:00.660
as an alien outsider,

30:00.660 --> 30:02.420
these works explore the originals

30:02.420 --> 30:04.340
and their feelings of otherness

30:04.420 --> 30:05.940
better than Lovecraft did.

30:05.940 --> 30:07.460
You don't have to go find a copy

30:07.460 --> 30:09.460
of this 10-year-old obscure film

30:09.460 --> 30:10.660
if you don't want to.

30:10.660 --> 30:12.180
It's not perfect by any means,

30:12.180 --> 30:13.380
and lots of the criticism

30:13.380 --> 30:14.900
the film's received is valid.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.180
Even the director's commentary

30:16.180 --> 30:16.980
opens by admitting

30:16.980 --> 30:18.660
they aren't fully happy with the film.

30:18.660 --> 30:21.540
There are 85 locations in this movie.

30:21.540 --> 30:22.580
Ridiculous.

30:22.580 --> 30:24.180
It's certainly nowhere near as good

30:24.180 --> 30:25.460
as the best film ever,

30:25.460 --> 30:27.220
Gremlins 2.

30:27.220 --> 30:28.740
But it meant something to me

30:28.740 --> 30:30.180
and was very important to me

30:30.180 --> 30:32.100
in a formative period of my life,

30:32.100 --> 30:33.620
and sometimes that's kind of

30:33.620 --> 30:35.140
more important than the writing

30:35.140 --> 30:36.420
or execution.

30:36.420 --> 30:38.020
As I look out into the internet

30:38.020 --> 30:39.860
and find many other queer fans

30:39.860 --> 30:41.140
of Lovecraft's work

30:41.140 --> 30:42.420
and writers in some form

30:42.420 --> 30:44.580
inspired by these feelings themselves,

30:44.580 --> 30:45.780
the wealth of literature

30:45.780 --> 30:47.620
exploring this side of his writing

30:47.620 --> 30:48.820
and films taking up

30:48.820 --> 30:50.580
radically humanizing perspectives

30:50.580 --> 30:52.180
even towards that which might

30:52.180 --> 30:54.580
literally be considered monstrous,

30:54.580 --> 30:55.620
I can't help but feel

30:55.620 --> 30:57.540
that there's a side of Lovecraft's work

30:57.540 --> 30:59.540
the man himself died

30:59.540 --> 31:02.340
unable to fully comprehend.

31:02.340 --> 31:05.220
And in a way, that's fitting, isn't it?

31:05.220 --> 31:06.900
But there's one other great story

31:06.900 --> 31:08.340
inspired at least partially

31:08.340 --> 31:09.620
by elements of Lovecraft,

31:09.620 --> 31:10.580
and I'm going to talk about it

31:10.580 --> 31:12.340
soon on my channel.

31:12.340 --> 31:13.380
Join me in the future

31:13.380 --> 31:15.700
when I reveal spectacularly

31:15.700 --> 31:17.940
why I filmed segments for this video

31:17.940 --> 31:21.380
at night in the woods.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.300
Oh, I just kind of gave it away then,

31:23.300 --> 31:24.180
didn't I?

31:24.180 --> 31:40.180
[♪ music ♪

31:40.180 --> 31:40.820
Hey.

31:40.820 --> 31:42.100
Thanks for watching, everybody.

31:42.100 --> 31:43.380
This one was quite hard to make

31:43.380 --> 31:45.380
for reasons that are probably obvious.

31:45.380 --> 31:47.300
I'm supported by all these lovely people

31:47.300 --> 31:49.140
over on Patreon.

31:49.140 --> 31:51.140
Backers get videos a few days early

31:51.140 --> 31:52.980
and also get to make suggestions

31:52.980 --> 31:54.420
on changes before the other version

31:54.420 --> 31:55.220
goes out,

31:55.220 --> 31:56.980
and they get some bonus extra videos

31:56.980 --> 31:57.700
every now and then.

31:57.700 --> 31:58.660
I still need to finish one

31:58.660 --> 32:00.500
about the making of the control delete video,

32:00.500 --> 32:01.860
but there's just so much footage

32:01.860 --> 32:02.580
to cut together.

32:02.580 --> 32:04.180
I'm basically making a little documentary

32:04.180 --> 32:07.300
about making this silly YouTube video.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.820
Oh, and since I don't do readings

32:08.820 --> 32:10.500
of the credits outside of longer videos,

32:10.500 --> 32:11.540
I'm trying a new thing

32:11.540 --> 32:13.380
where I stream myself to $10 back

32:13.380 --> 32:14.820
as doing editing

32:14.820 --> 32:16.340
and take live suggestions

32:16.340 --> 32:18.820
and show off my sort of process.

32:18.820 --> 32:20.580
Last night, I did a three-hour stream

32:20.580 --> 32:22.820
of me making changes to this video.

32:23.300 --> 32:24.820
So thanks to Mallow,

32:24.820 --> 32:26.420
who was in the chat and gave me the idea

32:26.420 --> 32:28.660
of pointing out that Huelbeck sucks.

32:28.660 --> 32:29.940
I wasn't sure if I should do it,

32:29.940 --> 32:31.060
so it was nice getting the input

32:31.060 --> 32:32.420
that I probably ought to,

32:32.420 --> 32:33.540
and thanks to everyone else

32:33.540 --> 32:34.900
who singled out other changes

32:34.900 --> 32:36.180
and fixes to mistakes

32:36.180 --> 32:39.460
I can now pretend were never made at all.

32:39.460 --> 32:41.860
I'd also like to say a special thank you

32:41.860 --> 32:43.380
to the over 100 people

32:43.380 --> 32:44.180
who reached out to me

32:44.180 --> 32:45.140
when I asked on Twitter

32:45.140 --> 32:46.660
for LGBT fans of Lovecraft

32:46.660 --> 32:48.500
to get in touch a few months ago.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.700
Your notes and contributions

32:49.700 --> 32:50.660
were really great

32:50.660 --> 32:52.100
and helped me think a lot

32:52.100 --> 32:53.060
about this topic

32:53.060 --> 32:55.140
and helped me ascertain

32:55.140 --> 32:57.460
that it wasn't all just me,

32:57.460 --> 32:58.900
that I wasn't imagining all of this,

32:58.900 --> 33:00.340
that other people felt this way.

33:01.140 --> 33:03.380
You were all really helpful and lovely,

33:03.380 --> 33:05.060
and this video wouldn't exist

33:05.060 --> 33:07.380
without your kindness and support.

33:07.380 --> 33:09.300
I hope everyone had a happy Pride Month.

33:09.300 --> 33:11.780
Not that you have to stop being proud now.

33:11.780 --> 33:13.860
You know, by all means, please continue.

33:14.580 --> 33:18.020
I'm going to go back into my hole

33:18.740 --> 33:20.980
and feel sorry for myself

33:20.980 --> 33:22.180
for another 11 months,

33:22.180 --> 33:25.700
but you do whatever makes you feel good.
