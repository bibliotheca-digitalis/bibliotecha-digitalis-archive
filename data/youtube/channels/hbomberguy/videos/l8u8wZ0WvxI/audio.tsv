0	22560	This is Cthulhu. It's a film that came out in 2008. Not many people appear to have seen
22560	24880	it.
24880	29560	As a teenager, I was obsessed with the works of Howard Phillips Lovecraft. Lovecraft was
29560	35120	a pioneer in Pulp Horror Fiction, immediately gripping with his cavalcade of creative monsters,
35120	41020	epic scope, terrible fates, and a unique philosophy about the terror of the existence of gods
41020	45400	greater than the human consciousness could allow. The man's work was inspirational
45400	50920	and moving to me. It made me think, made me dream, made me want to be a writer. Also,
50920	57160	seeing cool new words like Theosophists, or Non-Euclidean, or sentences like The Blood
57160	64760	Roots grew insolent in their chromatic perversion made me feel smart. I liked thinking I was
64760	65760	smart.
65760	68640	I was a big fan of the role-playing game, too. I just really liked the way that it dealt
68640	72880	with the mythos and how you interact with it, and the way it modeled sanity was really
72880	79200	good, too. And, hang on, can we, can someone find out who did this and why? I've been confused
79200	80840	by this for like a decade now.
80840	86520	As my interest grew and I ran out of stories by, inspired by, or about Lovecraft to read,
86520	91320	I started playing or watching any game or film even remotely based on his work. I'd
91320	95880	seen Re-Animator and its sequels, and From Beyond, and I was even about to watch Hellraiser
95880	99600	when I found an interview with Clive Barker where he said he didn't like Lovecraft's
99600	104160	writing very much and decided not to watch the film out of some misguided sense of spite.
104160	109160	That was how I did things back then, apparently.
109160	112840	I'd heard that Guillermo del Toro was going to adapt At the Mountains of Madness, one
112840	116560	of the best of Lovecraft's stories, and I couldn't wait for that. It turned out
116560	119920	I shouldn't have waited because it didn't happen. It was in development hell for a very
119920	121560	long time, and then it was never greenlit.
121560	126440	Then, as I was scraping the bottom of the barrel and watching fan films on YouTube,
126440	131880	I eventually found out about Cthulhu. It was named after Lovecraft's most famous creation,
131880	135680	and it had been made so recently that it might have been able to take advantage of the kinds
135680	140960	of effects and production techniques possible in modern filmmaking that something of truly
140960	147520	epic scale might actually have been possible. Cthulhu is not that film. Cthulhu isn't in
147520	151800	the film. It isn't even based on the short story The Call of Cthulhu. It's actually
151800	157000	a loose, very loose, interpretation of The Shadow Over Innsmouth. In that story, the
157000	161320	narrator investigates a New England fishing town where the people are strange and unwelcoming
161320	165840	to outsiders. He eventually discovers that the people of the town worship a godlike fish
165840	171320	creature named Dagon and its monstrous children, and have begun breeding with those creatures,
171320	175580	and their descendants eventually transform into monsters themselves to take to the water
175580	180800	and live forever beneath the sea with Dagon. After barely escaping with his life, the narrator
180800	186280	realizes that his family tree comes from Innsmouth, and he is slowly becoming one of them, too,
186280	191680	and he's starting to like it and relish the chance to worship Dagon for all time. It's
191680	196280	a really good story, and it's an excellent example of early 20th century American horror,
196280	200800	with the narrator's final change serving as a genuinely uncomfortable and fascinating
200800	206960	twist. It's really a true classic. This film is about a gay college professor called Russell,
206960	210800	who learns that his mother has passed away and returns to his hometown for her funeral.
210800	215440	Russell's father is the leader of a strange religious cult, and also deeply homophobic,
215440	219760	along with many of the rest of the townspeople. Russell realizes the cult has designs on him
219760	224120	of some kind, and something strange is going on. He reconnects with an old lover from his
224120	229000	past and tries to learn the truth as the people become increasingly hostile towards his search.
229000	234440	In lieu of looking at the tangible specifics of the horror, the beliefs of the cult, or
234440	239400	portraying the monsters from the original story, the film focuses on Russell's own
239400	245000	emotional state, his experiences and dreams, and relation to the people he encounters as
245000	249760	he tries to understand what is happening. When monsters do briefly appear, there's
249760	254960	not really much to see. The story isn't really concerned with them.
254960	260160	When I first saw this film, I decided that I hated it more than any other film. It had
260160	265280	taken something I cared about and enjoyed, and removed the things I thought made it interesting
265280	270160	and valuable. It made an existential horror about god-like creatures that care not for
270160	275120	human affairs into a story where the god in question never turns up or does anything
275120	281360	or is even really talked about in it. And even the name's technically the wrong name
281360	286800	of the god. Oh, and if you put the disc in a PC, the label doesn't even spell Cthulhu
286800	293960	properly! It's such an easy word to spell! The whole film felt like a betrayal. The camera
293960	299760	sometimes sits very still, trapping you with Russell in situations neither of you want
299760	303960	to be in, for conversations he doesn't want to be having with people he doesn't want to
303960	304960	see.
304960	307960	So, um, how's the, uh, how's the church?
307960	310960	How's the gay life treating you, Russell?
310960	316560	It's my life.
316560	317560	Is it satisfying?
317560	318560	Are you fulfilled?
318560	321960	What do you want to know? You want to know what we do?
321960	323960	Danny, please, just stay, stay out of this.
324160	330960	I didn't want any of this. I wanted something big, something epic, something focusing on
330960	335560	the horror of the big monsters, the sheer scope of the cosmos beyond our reach and the
335560	340200	nihilistic implications of being unimportant in the face of seemingly all-powerful things
340200	344680	that can decide our fate on a whim. For so much of it, it was such an uncomfortable and
344680	350520	personal and low-key horror. A human horror I wasn't really prepared for and was sure
350520	351520	I didn't want.
354760	361680	But as I got older and lived a decade of new experiences, to put it simply, I grew up.
361680	365480	I just sort of realized one day that I was capable of being romantically attracted to
365480	370680	men as well as women. I realized I was different from how I'd even thought of myself. I'd
370680	375680	just sort of naturally seen myself as straight, and even if I didn't think I thought of it
375680	381640	this way, on some primal level, I'd thought of being straight as being normal. I didn't
381640	385400	know why I thought like that. It's probably a mix of not really thinking too hard about
385400	390160	these things at the time combined with the vague notions and expectations our society
390160	394440	tends to have towards people's sexuality. But one day I looked in the mirror and saw
394440	402600	myself as not who I thought I was. I saw myself as an outsider from me, from the identity
402600	407920	I'd assumed for myself. And then I had a few difficult conversations with troublesome
407920	412620	people about those feelings. I'd always experienced termophobia. I was an effeminate
412620	417200	boy growing up, but I hadn't really cared because at the time I'd not really accepted
417200	421680	it as an insult or seen anything wrong with being called gay by losers in high school
421680	426260	who had just as much growing up to do as I did. But when I actually was one of those
426260	431800	people and knew it, all of a sudden it was a real judgment of who I actually was. To
431800	437620	them I'd actually become lesser. Being told I was going to die of AIDS and that my feelings
437620	443980	were unnatural and so on, and having to deal with being actually expected to try to convince
443980	449140	people that I wasn't inferior to them, suddenly made me think about that Cthulhu film I'd
449140	455900	seen a few years before. It was like it knew what I was going through. It knew how it felt
455900	461940	to sit in a room you just can't leave and have a piece of your personhood interrogated.
461940	468060	It knew how it felt to be seen as an outsider, and it knew how it felt to connect with someone
468060	473700	who understands and accepts you. Somehow it knew me and how I'd felt before I'd ever
473700	478940	had a chance to. Some of the scenes from this film just kept coming back up in my mind.
478940	484460	It hadn't been what I'd thought I'd wanted, but what it was struck a chord with me anyway
484460	489740	on a level I didn't know was there. It just took a while for me to hear the chiming.
489740	494700	It turns out that some of the greatest horrors, biggest sources of sadness in our lives, don't
494700	499580	come from scope or big questions, but from the tiniest things. If you've ever lost
499580	503300	a loved one and had to be involved with the arrangements of their funeral, or if you've
503300	506820	ever had to be around someone you'd made an effort to cut out of your life because
506820	511380	of something abusive they'd done to you, or even something as simple as being reminded,
511380	515380	gently, that you're in a place where everyone regards you with suspicion, that you're
515380	520020	an outsider to them, you'll already know that the idea of a powerful cosmic monster
520020	524860	out there somewhere beneath the sea can actually be the least of a person's problems.
524860	529700	The film was, in retrospect, a meaningful and valuable work that paid respect to the
529700	535240	source material's themes and emotions in ways I hadn't grasped as a cynical kid who
535240	540860	thought he knew he was straight and thought he knew what made Lovecraft good, and I just
540860	544340	wasn't ready to appreciate the value of that kind of story at the time.
544500	549140	Here's a review from back in 2009 on the film's Amazon page by someone called Giles.
549140	550500	Giles writes...
550500	556020	I can't stress how bad this film is on every level. As for H.P. Lovecraft, he must be spinning
556020	561100	in his grave, because this is definitely the worst film adaptation yet. It is vaguely based
561100	566100	on Shadow over Innsmouth, but the story, what there is of it, is so badly constructed that
566100	568660	you could easily miss the very few similarities.
568660	571540	And why all the gay subplot? What was that all about?
571540	575540	Now, here's the thing about Giles from 2009.
575540	578820	I was Giles in 2009.
578820	583540	No, I'm fairly certain I didn't write this exact Amazon review, but I felt the same way
583540	588340	as this person at around the same time. It didn't make sense to the teenage me whose
588340	592260	main frame of reference on the world was the horror stories he'd read, but then I grew
592260	595780	up and it started making a lot more sense without me even having to go back and see
595780	596820	the film again.
596820	601140	This film and its delayed effect on me got me thinking about what works about Lovecraft's
601220	605540	stories, what doesn't, and what the best way might be to navigate these qualities in
605540	607700	creating an adaptation.
607700	613620	And along the way, with a lot of encouragement, and if it's not too awkward, we'll maybe
613620	619780	talk about the fact that a writer who basically founded a subgenre of fiction has been hugely
619780	626020	influential and made so many people want to become writers, including myself, was really
626020	628020	massively racist.
628020	634740	INTRO
634740	637780	Anyway, let's start at the beginning, shall we?
637780	641620	Why do humans create and tell each other stories?
641620	645540	Yeah, I'm sure we can settle that real quick, we've only been asking that question for
645540	647060	a millennia.
647060	655940	I can solve that, I've got a plaque for surpassing over 100,000 YouTube subscribers.
655940	660500	Firstly, we should acknowledge that fiction isn't simply the opposite of truth, it is,
660500	663460	in some sense, a reflection of truth.
663460	664740	Let's look at horror stories.
664740	670100	When a ghost story speaks of a place being haunted by the past, it speaks to us about
670100	675300	the ways that really does happen, the ways the world controls and decides things for
675300	680020	us, and how the legacy, the result of other people's decisions, are still here with
680020	682660	us even after the people who made them are gone.
682660	686500	The ghosts of the past really do haunt the present they built.
686500	692180	Vampires, similarly, tend to be impactful because they reflect some true aspect of the
692180	694260	society that was writing about them at the time.
694260	696500	There's a reason Dracula was a count.
696500	702180	Vampires are aristocratic, upper-class beings that live by parasitically consuming the essence
702180	706580	of the poor workers and exploiting people using their influence, either their literal
706580	709940	riches or their other, less tangible powers.
709940	714500	And in doing this, they literalize a very real but much more vague social antagonism.
714500	719140	The aristocracies, monarchies, and other rich and powerful figures over history rarely actually
719140	722820	drink people's blood for sustenance, although the way the current economy is going, who
722820	726180	knows, but the rich really are vampires, in a sense.
726180	730420	They really do profit and thrive from the work and sacrifice of those beneath them.
730420	734180	It's not unimaginable that consciousness of this kind of antagonism makes its way
734180	739380	into folklore as creatures that are only slightly more exaggerated forms of the actual power
739380	742660	relationships between rich and poor people, or boss and worker.
742660	744180	Bram Stoker?
744180	746980	More like Gram-shee Stoker?
748660	751300	Uh, doesn't really work, does it?
752340	755860	Is there a better Marxist thinker who would work here as a pun?
755860	758580	Let me know in the comments so I can feel like an idiot for missing it.
758580	762260	When you're reading Dracula, you're not just reading a creative horror about a scary
762260	767060	monster, you're reading a story that most people, on some level, understand.
767060	771860	It's relevant to the world people live in, where a non-magical version of Dracula's
771860	776580	immense influence and theft of livelihood from ordinary people really does happen.
776580	782420	Notably, even Karl Marx repeatedly used vampirism as a way of describing the nature of capitalism
782420	783700	in Das Kapital.
783700	788580	Look, my point here isn't that vampire stories are all secretly about how capitalism is bad
788580	793060	or something, that would be ridiculous, and so many of them were written before the actual
793060	795860	proper invention of capitalism as we know it today.
795860	802100	My point is that it was a way of talking about issues that functioned so well that
802100	806980	when the time came to actually talk about things like capitalism, the guy who started
806980	814260	talking about it used vampires as a way of talking about it, which usually means that
814260	818660	the stories were onto something that was kind of, like, real, something that was there.
818660	823300	It's also notable that Fifty Shades of Grey, originally a fanfiction based on Twilight,
823300	824820	kinda does this too.
824820	829380	It takes out all the major supernatural aspects of Twilight and, of course, the simplest way
829380	834180	of bringing the dynamics between a magical, immortal vampire and a young, innocent teenage
834180	838980	girl into the real world is to reimagine the vampire as a billionaire with immense influence
838980	841300	and a very particular sexual taste.
841300	844340	Look, the richer vampires, basically, I think have made this point.
844340	846740	The Slasher film also embodies this as well.
846740	851300	The killer in Slasher stories is an urban, modern creature which expresses modern, urban
852020	855860	The fear of what's happening in the neighborhood behind everyone's closed doors where they
855860	857380	could be getting up to just about anything.
857380	860580	The fear of the effects of modern living on people growing up in it.
860580	864260	Fellow YouTuber Nick's Fears did a really cool video going into the deeper aspects of
864260	867060	this in Halloween, which you can check out linked in the description.
867060	870500	It's good and long and fun and please go watch it.
870500	877300	The Slasher films are silly, gross, gory, and often just kind of bad, but they got popular
877300	880820	because they're dealing with something that's real and actually happening.
881460	894420	Okay, that's not actually happening in real life, but that's from like part eight of a
894420	900740	franchise and you don't get seven sequels without at least originally having some resonating
900740	901300	cultural.
902900	904420	He punches his head into a bin.
904980	906740	You get a perspective shot of it.
906740	910020	It's like you're looking out of his head as it flies off.
910020	914340	The idea that fiction is not the opposite of facts, but actually can be more truthful
914340	918740	than facts on their own is key to what makes storytelling so important.
918740	924740	Art is all lies, all perceptions, always subjective, always up for further interpretation,
924740	927860	and always slanted by the perspectives of its creators.
927860	930980	But art is lies in service to truth.
931700	934500	Bringing all of this back, what of Lovecraft?
934500	939780	What makes his work in particular continue to be remembered alongside Dracula or Halloween
939780	943060	and act as direct inspiration for yet more creative works?
943060	945460	What truth is hidden within his fiction?
946020	948260	Well, it might be the existential horror.
948260	951780	His works come together to relate a thoroughly nihilistic universe,
951780	955940	wholly uncaring about our existence, and there may well be a truth to that,
955940	960660	but it isn't whether or not human existence actually matters that's central to his work.
960660	964180	It's not quite the idea of that stuff actually being true,
964660	970260	but rather the direct feeling of being unimportant in the grand scheme of things.
970260	974020	Lovecraft's writing and tropes function in this regard a lot like one of the writers
974020	976820	who in turn inspired him, Edgar Allan Poe.
976820	979540	Poe doesn't exactly make people feel good.
979540	982900	Rather, he makes them feel sad in a productive way.
982900	986580	It can make people who are prone to those feelings feel less alone
986580	989140	because they know others have them too.
989140	993380	The Call of Cthulhu doesn't begin by telling you how scary a big monster could be
993380	996580	or giving you a description of what its tentacles would look like.
996580	1001380	It opens with a profound fear of the future and of what discoveries might lie there.
1001380	1006180	The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little,
1006180	1008980	but someday the piecing together of dissociated knowledge
1008980	1013860	will open up such terrifying vistas of reality and of our frightful position therein
1013860	1016500	that we shall either go mad from the revelation
1016500	1021140	or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.
1021220	1024820	So what mattered wasn't how creative or imaginative his stories got,
1024820	1028180	but how they related to people's own feelings of unimportance
1028180	1030580	then and now in the actual world.
1030580	1033620	There's the old joke that a paranoid person,
1033620	1036500	if they were ever to discover the room that the government spied on them from
1036500	1038260	with all the notes on their lives,
1038260	1041460	they wouldn't actually be any more afraid because of this.
1041460	1043220	They'd feel validated.
1043220	1044740	They weren't paranoid.
1044740	1045860	They were right.
1045860	1049780	And through that lens, Lovecraft is a way of feeling completely assured
1049780	1052740	that the world really is out to get you,
1052740	1056340	and maybe God doesn't care or hates you or wants you dead.
1056340	1058740	You can use special effects to design something scarier
1058740	1060820	than the man himself could ever have imagined,
1060820	1064820	but that alone isn't actually the thing that's scary about the story.
1064820	1067940	What's scary is the way these smaller aspects build
1067940	1072020	to create a sense that humans are tiny and powerless creatures,
1072020	1074340	that the greatest height we can aspire to
1074340	1079700	is a deep and intimate understanding of just how little we understand.
1079700	1082740	Lovecraft rarely reused his creations between stories,
1082740	1086980	and that's because the creatures he came up with didn't really matter.
1086980	1088820	They were interchangeable,
1088820	1091380	and the ideas they existed to communicate
1091380	1094340	with their scope and alienness was what mattered.
1094340	1099060	Unfortunately, however, this is where things get a bit hairy and complicated.
1099060	1101380	One of Lovecraft's most famous quotes goes,
1101380	1104420	"'The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear,
1104420	1108500	and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.'"
1108500	1110500	And you know what this guy didn't know much about?
1111140	1113380	People of other races.
1113380	1115780	Look, we've managed to brush past it,
1115780	1120580	but we do have to talk about Lovecraft's racism, sexism,
1121460	1123780	antisemitism, and homophobia.
1125460	1126500	It's happening now.
1127780	1131460	So for the folks out there who don't think you can criticize an author's beliefs
1131460	1134900	just because it was a different time and it happened 100 years ago,
1135460	1136500	thanks for watching.
1136500	1138100	Don't forget to like and subscribe.
1138100	1139220	I'll see you next time.
1139220	1142500	I promise I'll review a game and make some jokes or something in the next one.
1145460	1146020	Are they gone?
1147380	1148420	Okay, they're gone.
1148420	1153460	Right, so it's pop-culturally quite well known that Lovecraft was a bit xenophobic,
1153460	1156660	and I do remember reading some pretty bad stuff,
1156660	1158420	but it was a while ago that I read it,
1158420	1160500	and I'm sure it can't be as bad as I remember.
1160500	1164420	What the fuck is nautical looking supposed to mean, Howard?
1164420	1165940	What does it even mean?
1168100	1172420	...
1172420	1175460	In his biography of H.P. Lovecraft, fittingly entitled
1175460	1178020	Against the World Against Life,
1178020	1179780	Michel Houellebecq writes,
1179780	1182100	The character of Lovecraft fascinates us,
1182100	1185860	partly because his system of values is entirely opposed to ours.
1185860	1188340	Fundamentally racist, openly reactionary,
1188340	1192180	he glorifies Puritan inhibition and quite evidently finds repellent
1192180	1194420	any open display of eroticism.
1194420	1196980	Resolutely anti-commercial, he despises money,
1196980	1200500	considers democracy to be pure folly, progress an illusion.
1200500	1205140	The word liberty, so dear to Americans, elicits from him only a gloomy sneer.
1205140	1208740	All his life he maintained a typically aristocratic attitude of scorn
1208740	1212180	for humanity in general together with an extreme solicitude
1212180	1214420	toward individuals in person.
1214420	1217380	Houellebecq kinda sucks, honestly,
1217380	1220740	and idolizes some of Lovecraft's worst qualities in his biography,
1220740	1223140	but this quote is helpful in illustrating the specifics
1223140	1225300	of Lovecraft's worldview, so I'm gonna use it.
1225300	1228260	A stopped clock is right twice a day, I suppose.
1228260	1231140	Lovecraft seemingly hated society itself,
1231140	1233540	but he had a deeper and specific dislike
1233540	1236180	for Black and Jewish people along with immigrants.
1236180	1240340	It's so prevalent in his writing that even citing multiple examples
1240340	1243460	would kind of diminish how overwhelming and constant it is.
1243460	1248020	I can't even bring myself to say the name of Lovecraft's cat
1248020	1249860	because it's a racial slur.
1249860	1254100	And despite this obviously completely full schedule of racism
1254100	1256820	and general hatred for humanity itself,
1256820	1259940	he also managed to find time to be a raging homophobe.
1259940	1262660	He claimed not to have even known homosexuality existed
1262660	1264340	until he was in his 30s,
1264340	1267860	but then he goes on to immediately compare it to being a pederast.
1267860	1270900	You know, growing up, I always would immediately try to find ways
1270900	1273860	to write off or handwave away the racism.
1273860	1277060	You know, I would say, well, it was a part of his time.
1277060	1279940	I never really just sat down and gave myself the opportunity
1279940	1282900	to just say, God, what a piece of shit.
1284100	1287620	I mean, honestly, like, his work meant something to me
1287620	1289780	in a really, like, profound way
1289780	1291460	that no other work has ever really done,
1292340	1294900	but I fucking think the guy's terrible.
1294900	1298500	As a side note, Lovecraft's views apparently softened a little bit over time.
1298500	1300340	In a letter he wrote a month before his death,
1300340	1302340	he claimed he understood the blindness
1302340	1304340	and defiant ignorance of reactionaries
1304340	1305940	because he used to be one.
1305940	1309140	"'I know how smugly ignorant I was,' he wrote.
1309140	1311780	He supposedly became a socialist in the last year of his life
1311780	1313060	and supported the New Deal,
1313060	1315300	and he was married to a Jewish woman for a while,
1315300	1318900	but it's debatable whether he really developed all that much,
1318980	1322500	and the racism in his work is still unavoidably there.'"
1322500	1325780	And this leads us to a very weird and difficult question.
1326820	1329780	Why are there queer Lovecraft fans?
1330820	1332020	Why do I exist?
1332980	1335460	And why do so many people like me exist?
1335460	1338340	Why is this space a place for a lot of queer
1338340	1340420	and marginalized people in the first place?
1341140	1343860	Why does his work resonate so well
1344580	1348820	with people who the man himself would have hated even more
1349060	1350500	than he hated everyone else?
1351300	1357540	Now, I don't think I'm qualified to answer this question.
1357540	1360580	I don't actually think anyone really is.
1361380	1363140	There's probably a lot of different reasons,
1364020	1366580	but from what I can gather,
1367300	1370100	it seems like the answer lies in the specifics
1370100	1372100	of how Lovecraft saw the world,
1372100	1375460	in the place that his approach actually came from.
1375460	1377300	"'When Lovecraft was three years old,
1377300	1378500	his father had a breakdown
1378500	1380100	and was committed to a mental hospital.
1380100	1381700	He died there five years later.
1381700	1384340	His mother also frequently suffered from similar problems
1384340	1386740	and later died in the same hospital.
1386740	1390100	Lovecraft suffered from periods of severe anxiety and depression.
1390100	1391540	He had to drop out of high school
1391540	1394340	and often isolated himself for long periods at a time.
1394340	1396660	He saw himself as a temporary visitor
1396660	1398660	to a strange and unwelcoming world.
1398660	1401860	This is present even in one of Lovecraft's earliest stories,
1401860	1403140	The Outsider.
1403140	1406420	The narrator escapes from being trapped within a decaying castle,
1406420	1408820	but his search for human contact is frustrated
1408820	1411380	when the people he finds run away in horror.
1411380	1414340	He turns and sees a detestable and ghoulish creature
1414340	1415700	has entered the room.
1415700	1419060	To his shock, he realizes he's looking into a mirror."
1419060	1421860	All of his best works draw into close focus
1421860	1424500	not some generic fear of outsiders,
1425220	1429860	but the anxieties and fears that come with being an outsider,
1430420	1433860	of being in a world that doesn't really understand you,
1433860	1438180	and perhaps of not being fully able to understand yourself.
1438180	1440340	So there is a fairly decent reason here
1440340	1442340	why someone might be drawn to these works,
1442340	1444820	even if the author was deeply problematic.
1444820	1447300	And this appears to have been true to some degree
1447300	1448900	at the time in a strange way.
1448900	1450900	Lovecraft was pretty open about the problems
1450900	1452420	he had with homosexuality.
1452420	1455300	However, several of his closest friends were gay,
1455300	1458260	including the poets Hart Crane and Samuel Loveman
1458260	1459620	and Robert Hayward Barlow,
1459620	1461940	who he worked closely with on numerous stories
1461940	1464740	and who Lovecraft made the executor of his literary estate
1464740	1465860	in the event of his death.
1465860	1467380	It's partially due to Barlow
1467380	1468900	that so much of Lovecraft's writing
1468900	1470260	has been preserved over the years,
1470260	1472900	given how he wasn't all that popular at the time.
1472900	1474900	The deeply bigoted belief in a link
1474900	1476820	between homosexuality and pedophilia
1476820	1478740	is invoked, this time on purpose,
1478740	1479940	in the film as well.
1479940	1482100	There's a scene in Cthulhu where Russell is arrested
1482100	1484660	on manufactured charges of being a pedophile.
1484660	1486580	-"You're under arrest for murder." -"Oh, come on."
1486580	1488260	-"Rape of a minor." -"Oh, wait, you can't--"
1488260	1490020	-"Trespass--" -"The event is positioned
1490020	1491700	as an extension of his mistreatment
1491700	1493140	by the rest of the town.
1493140	1494900	We're seeing the kind of alienation
1494900	1497300	the original stories had to invent a foreign cult
1497300	1498420	to get across,
1498420	1500900	but translated into actual things
1500900	1502580	people do experience."
1502580	1505300	-"Oh, yeah, you like this? Faggot goes off to jail?"
1505300	1507140	The easiness and convenience
1507140	1509140	with which having a different sexual preference
1509140	1510740	is equated with criminality
1510740	1513940	is something that real people deal with even today.
1513940	1514660	For some people,
1514660	1517140	the intellectualized existential problems
1517140	1519460	Lovecraft had originally written to explore
1519460	1520900	cease to be theoretical
1520900	1523140	and start to communicate familiar experiences
1523140	1525220	the same way Edgar Allan Poe's writing can be
1525220	1526820	to someone who's lost a loved one,
1526820	1528500	or the way Halloween explores
1528500	1530340	the suburban fear of one's neighbors,
1530340	1533060	or Dracula puts words to a deeper understanding
1533060	1534980	of the antagonism between different classes
1534980	1536500	in our social hierarchy.
1536500	1538580	For those who've been treated like this
1538580	1539860	in the name of a religion
1539860	1542100	or simply by their surrounding society
1542100	1544340	because of its horrific expectations,
1544340	1547220	have they not come the closest a person can
1547220	1548500	in the real world
1548500	1550980	to the central Lovecraftian experience?
1550980	1552420	Have they not, in a sense,
1552420	1554740	glimpsed the face of an uncaring universe?
1559700	1562580	-"He was a guy that definitely did not get laid much,
1563140	1564740	you know, and a guy that was
1566180	1567780	an alien amongst us."
1568340	1570100	Del Toro still hasn't gotten to make
1570100	1571620	the Mountains of Madness adaptation
1571620	1573700	he wanted to make and I wanted to see,
1573700	1574820	but what's weird is,
1574820	1575700	as I've grown older
1575700	1577060	and become more interested in stories
1577060	1578020	that are more compelling
1578020	1579540	than Lovecraft's original works,
1579540	1581540	it seems that Del Toro has as well.
1581540	1583780	In a recent interview about The Shape of Water,
1583780	1584420	he said,
1594420	1596020	These are not concerns that I had
1596020	1597780	when I was nine or seven.
1597780	1599860	The Shape of Water doesn't have any elements
1599860	1600820	that would be regarded
1600820	1602340	as traditionally Lovecraftian
1602340	1603860	by purists like Giles
1603860	1605460	or the teenager I used to be,
1605540	1607700	but its story gets at what I think
1607700	1609140	makes Lovecraft actually work
1609140	1610260	in the first place.
1610260	1612340	Human stories about our alienation
1612340	1614180	from each other and our lonelinesses,
1614180	1616020	our victimization by forces
1616020	1616980	beyond our control
1616980	1618980	that see us as outside the norm,
1618980	1620180	and how we can at least
1620180	1622020	partially rectify this by
1622020	1623380	learning to see the beauty
1623380	1625300	in something previously seen as alien.
1625300	1626180	In a sense,
1626180	1628100	it's a story about the people of Innsmouth
1628100	1629780	who happily chose to join
1629780	1630820	with the Deep Ones,
1630820	1632980	quite literally embracing otherness,
1632980	1634580	raising children who literally
1634580	1636500	learn to love to be different.
1636500	1638180	Now, the film's perspectives
1638180	1639620	and plot and texture
1639620	1640900	make it not really invite
1640900	1642580	much of a comparison with Lovecraft
1642580	1643940	in a straightforward viewing,
1644580	1646500	but maybe that's proof
1646500	1647780	of how good it is.
1647780	1649220	The Shape of Water has
1649220	1650820	so successfully excavated
1650820	1652020	all the garbage away
1652020	1653540	from its spiritual predecessor
1653540	1654900	that despite depicting something
1654900	1656260	that directly happened
1656260	1657460	in a story del Toro
1657460	1658420	has definitely read,
1658980	1661780	the comparison still feels strange,
1661780	1663060	wrong almost.
1663060	1665380	This film captures the beautiful,
1665380	1667460	human, mesmerizing center
1667460	1668820	of Lovecraft's writing.
1668820	1670580	It's the kind of story he could,
1671220	1672740	or perhaps should,
1672740	1674340	have been writing all along.
1674340	1675540	For me, there's something
1675540	1676980	personally wonderful about
1676980	1678260	finally really coming to
1678260	1679380	an understanding of a film
1679380	1680340	that touched me in ways
1680340	1681220	I didn't realize
1681220	1682340	and that never really
1682340	1683780	got much recognition.
1683780	1685380	Right as a film that understands
1685380	1686820	this just as well gets released
1686820	1688580	and actually gets major recognition
1688580	1689700	and even wins an Oscar.
1690100	1691540	I am an immigrant,
1691540	1693220	unlike many, many of you,
1693220	1695300	and in the last 25 years,
1695300	1696980	I've been living in a country
1696980	1697940	all of our own,
1697940	1698740	because I think that
1698740	1700500	the greatest thing our art does
1700500	1701620	and our industry does
1701620	1703380	is to erase the lines in the sand.
1703940	1705780	We should continue doing that
1705780	1706740	when the world tells us
1706740	1707700	to make them deeper.
1709220	1711380	While it's easy and correct
1711380	1713140	to be dubious about the value
1713140	1714340	of winning an Oscar,
1714340	1716020	I do think the success of a film
1716020	1717940	like this is a really hopeful sign
1717940	1719300	for the future of how people
1719380	1721140	see that which is alien to them.
1721140	1722100	There's a philosopher
1722100	1723300	named Julia Kristeva
1723300	1725700	whose work was pretty formative for me.
1725700	1726500	I discovered her
1726500	1727700	through her being quoted
1727700	1728980	in a series of critical essays
1728980	1729940	on Lovecraft,
1729940	1731300	one by Gina Whisker,
1731300	1733460	entitled Spawn of the Pit.
1733460	1734580	The quote went,
1734580	1736580	By recognizing our uncanny strangeness,
1736580	1737940	we shall neither suffer from it
1737940	1739700	nor enjoy it from the outside.
1739700	1741220	The foreigner is within me.
1741220	1743140	Hence, we are all foreigners.
1743140	1744260	If I am a foreigner,
1744260	1746100	then there are no foreigners.
1746100	1747700	Why be alien to each other
1747700	1750020	when we are all alien to ourselves?
1751940	1753460	So, what have we learned
1753460	1755540	about how to adapt Lovecraft?
1755540	1757300	Well, I think there's a point here
1757300	1758900	about how we have to decide
1758900	1760420	what really makes his work good
1760420	1761380	in the first place,
1761380	1763620	what the core truths in his work are
1763620	1764660	that ought to survive
1764660	1766100	into a future they inspire.
1766100	1767860	An adaptation, to me at least,
1767860	1769140	only needs fidelity
1769140	1770260	to what really matters
1770260	1771300	about the text,
1771300	1772740	and neglecting to bring across
1772740	1773940	other aspects like
1773940	1775700	the finer points of its philosophy
1775700	1778340	or its particular linguistic flourishes
1778340	1779700	or certain characters
1779700	1782260	or even its racism or homophobia
1782260	1784260	isn't a failure to be fully faithful
1784260	1785540	to the original work.
1785540	1786500	It's demonstrating
1786500	1787940	a successful understanding
1787940	1789140	of why those stories
1789140	1790340	were worth reading about
1790340	1791220	in the first place
1791220	1792660	in spite of those flaws.
1792660	1794740	In focusing on a person's experiences
1794740	1796340	and treatment for their sexuality
1796340	1797380	or on a relationship
1797380	1798820	with someone seen by others
1798820	1800660	as an alien outsider,
1800660	1802420	these works explore the originals
1802420	1804340	and their feelings of otherness
1804420	1805940	better than Lovecraft did.
1805940	1807460	You don't have to go find a copy
1807460	1809460	of this 10-year-old obscure film
1809460	1810660	if you don't want to.
1810660	1812180	It's not perfect by any means,
1812180	1813380	and lots of the criticism
1813380	1814900	the film's received is valid.
1814900	1816180	Even the director's commentary
1816180	1816980	opens by admitting
1816980	1818660	they aren't fully happy with the film.
1818660	1821540	There are 85 locations in this movie.
1821540	1822580	Ridiculous.
1822580	1824180	It's certainly nowhere near as good
1824180	1825460	as the best film ever,
1825460	1827220	Gremlins 2.
1827220	1828740	But it meant something to me
1828740	1830180	and was very important to me
1830180	1832100	in a formative period of my life,
1832100	1833620	and sometimes that's kind of
1833620	1835140	more important than the writing
1835140	1836420	or execution.
1836420	1838020	As I look out into the internet
1838020	1839860	and find many other queer fans
1839860	1841140	of Lovecraft's work
1841140	1842420	and writers in some form
1842420	1844580	inspired by these feelings themselves,
1844580	1845780	the wealth of literature
1845780	1847620	exploring this side of his writing
1847620	1848820	and films taking up
1848820	1850580	radically humanizing perspectives
1850580	1852180	even towards that which might
1852180	1854580	literally be considered monstrous,
1854580	1855620	I can't help but feel
1855620	1857540	that there's a side of Lovecraft's work
1857540	1859540	the man himself died
1859540	1862340	unable to fully comprehend.
1862340	1865220	And in a way, that's fitting, isn't it?
1865220	1866900	But there's one other great story
1866900	1868340	inspired at least partially
1868340	1869620	by elements of Lovecraft,
1869620	1870580	and I'm going to talk about it
1870580	1872340	soon on my channel.
1872340	1873380	Join me in the future
1873380	1875700	when I reveal spectacularly
1875700	1877940	why I filmed segments for this video
1877940	1881380	at night in the woods.
1881380	1883300	Oh, I just kind of gave it away then,
1883300	1884180	didn't I?
1884180	1900180	[♪ music ♪
1900180	1900820	Hey.
1900820	1902100	Thanks for watching, everybody.
1902100	1903380	This one was quite hard to make
1903380	1905380	for reasons that are probably obvious.
1905380	1907300	I'm supported by all these lovely people
1907300	1909140	over on Patreon.
1909140	1911140	Backers get videos a few days early
1911140	1912980	and also get to make suggestions
1912980	1914420	on changes before the other version
1914420	1915220	goes out,
1915220	1916980	and they get some bonus extra videos
1916980	1917700	every now and then.
1917700	1918660	I still need to finish one
1918660	1920500	about the making of the control delete video,
1920500	1921860	but there's just so much footage
1921860	1922580	to cut together.
1922580	1924180	I'm basically making a little documentary
1924180	1927300	about making this silly YouTube video.
1927300	1928820	Oh, and since I don't do readings
1928820	1930500	of the credits outside of longer videos,
1930500	1931540	I'm trying a new thing
1931540	1933380	where I stream myself to $10 back
1933380	1934820	as doing editing
1934820	1936340	and take live suggestions
1936340	1938820	and show off my sort of process.
1938820	1940580	Last night, I did a three-hour stream
1940580	1942820	of me making changes to this video.
1943300	1944820	So thanks to Mallow,
1944820	1946420	who was in the chat and gave me the idea
1946420	1948660	of pointing out that Huelbeck sucks.
1948660	1949940	I wasn't sure if I should do it,
1949940	1951060	so it was nice getting the input
1951060	1952420	that I probably ought to,
1952420	1953540	and thanks to everyone else
1953540	1954900	who singled out other changes
1954900	1956180	and fixes to mistakes
1956180	1959460	I can now pretend were never made at all.
1959460	1961860	I'd also like to say a special thank you
1961860	1963380	to the over 100 people
1963380	1964180	who reached out to me
1964180	1965140	when I asked on Twitter
1965140	1966660	for LGBT fans of Lovecraft
1966660	1968500	to get in touch a few months ago.
1968500	1969700	Your notes and contributions
1969700	1970660	were really great
1970660	1972100	and helped me think a lot
1972100	1973060	about this topic
1973060	1975140	and helped me ascertain
1975140	1977460	that it wasn't all just me,
1977460	1978900	that I wasn't imagining all of this,
1978900	1980340	that other people felt this way.
1981140	1983380	You were all really helpful and lovely,
1983380	1985060	and this video wouldn't exist
1985060	1987380	without your kindness and support.
1987380	1989300	I hope everyone had a happy Pride Month.
1989300	1991780	Not that you have to stop being proud now.
1991780	1993860	You know, by all means, please continue.
1994580	1998020	I'm going to go back into my hole
1998740	2000980	and feel sorry for myself
2000980	2002180	for another 11 months,
2002180	2005700	but you do whatever makes you feel good.
