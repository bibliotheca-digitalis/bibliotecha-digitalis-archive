00:03.920 --> 00:05.720
Ugh!

00:05.720 --> 00:08.340
Arrrrgh!

00:08.340 --> 00:10.560
Hello! It's me!

00:10.560 --> 00:12.720
That guy who does those videos!

00:12.720 --> 00:14.060
Very occasionally.

00:14.060 --> 00:15.560
Oh, man!

00:15.560 --> 00:17.940
Jeez. I love balls.

00:17.940 --> 00:21.520
Did you know that, as of maybe 200 years ago,

00:21.520 --> 00:25.020
everyone thought that the Earth was flat?

00:25.020 --> 00:26.740
Ah, that's actually a joke!

00:26.740 --> 00:29.620
I tricked you! It's a pop-cultural myth!

00:29.620 --> 00:32.780
People have thought that the Earth was a sphere,

00:32.780 --> 00:35.280
more specifically, an oblate spheroid,

00:35.280 --> 00:37.860
for hundreds, if not thousands of years,

00:37.860 --> 00:39.620
if you accept Ptolemy's writing

00:39.620 --> 00:41.840
as evidence of that speculation.

00:41.840 --> 00:44.120
Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!

00:44.120 --> 00:46.720
For, at the very least, hundreds of years now,

00:46.720 --> 00:48.680
it's been pretty much widely accepted

00:48.680 --> 00:50.000
that the Earth is a globe,

00:50.000 --> 00:52.760
which means that the modern Flat Earth movements

00:52.760 --> 00:57.380
that exist aren't contiguous with any past movement.

00:57.440 --> 00:58.780
These people aren't regressives

00:58.780 --> 01:01.620
who want to go back to a certain set of beliefs.

01:01.620 --> 01:02.780
These people are progressives.

01:02.780 --> 01:05.360
They believe in science and reason and evidence.

01:05.360 --> 01:08.620
They want understanding of the Earth to move forwards,

01:08.620 --> 01:11.000
off of the edge of a cliff,

01:11.000 --> 01:12.920
which theoretically exists now.

01:12.920 --> 01:14.660
The Earth might have an edge.

01:14.660 --> 01:15.840
That's exciting!

01:15.840 --> 01:18.340
And today, I wanted to look at some of these people's reasons

01:18.340 --> 01:20.420
for their beliefs, their evidence,

01:20.420 --> 01:22.720
and I wanted to see what we, as independent thinkers,

01:22.720 --> 01:24.220
can make of their findings.

01:24.220 --> 01:26.640
See you in hell, you little lie-ball!

01:26.640 --> 01:28.780
Nyah! Oh! Oh, fuck!

Oh, jeez! Oh, Jesus!

01:33.320 --> 01:38.120
Chapter 1, How Flat Earth Came Back from the Edge.

01:38.120 --> 01:41.040
So, I'm not kidding about Flat Earth-erism being recent.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.620
There are numerous Flat Earth societies

01:42.620 --> 01:44.660
that have been around for, like, 200 years,

01:44.660 --> 01:46.760
but usually they're just a couple of people now,

01:46.760 --> 01:48.260
just keeping the lights on,

01:48.260 --> 01:52.180
and even then, they were seen as weirdos by most people.

01:52.180 --> 01:54.180
Then, on Facebook in the early years,

01:54.180 --> 01:57.800
there were people who were, like, opening joke pages,

01:57.800 --> 01:59.800
pretending to be a Flat Earth society,

01:59.800 --> 02:01.060
and it was just people having fun,

02:01.060 --> 02:03.860
making silly, sort of fake memes,

02:03.860 --> 02:05.560
and it is, let's all admit,

02:05.560 --> 02:08.520
very funny to call someone a globehead.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.360
But then, I don't know, society utterly fucking collapsed

02:11.360 --> 02:12.980
when I wasn't looking or something,

02:12.980 --> 02:14.700
because now, in addition to some people

02:14.700 --> 02:17.940
believing that the free market is real and a good idea,

02:17.940 --> 02:19.820
some people believe the much less harmful

02:19.820 --> 02:22.660
and ridiculous fairy tale that the Earth is flat.

02:22.680 --> 02:25.800
As of 2015, Flat Earth membership has grown massively,

02:25.800 --> 02:28.360
and now there's even a full Flat Earth convention

02:28.360 --> 02:32.280
with people flying in from all around the globe

02:32.280 --> 02:34.740
to take part and pool their collective knowledge.

02:34.740 --> 02:37.320
Even some celebrities have voiced support for the movement,

02:37.320 --> 02:39.780
like Logan Paul, who's universally known

02:39.780 --> 02:41.620
for making well-thought-out decisions,

02:41.620 --> 02:44.240
and famous rapper...Bob?

02:44.240 --> 02:46.080
Little Robbie currently has a GoFundMe

02:46.080 --> 02:49.300
asking for a million dollars to send up drones

02:49.300 --> 02:51.380
and weather balloons and satellites

02:51.440 --> 02:52.900
and rockets and stuff,

02:52.900 --> 02:56.440
and I kind of admire his, uh, commitment to science.

02:56.440 --> 02:59.320
He's really willing to put other people's money

02:59.320 --> 03:02.200
where his mouth is and find out the shape of the Earth.

03:02.200 --> 03:04.540
But what caused Bob to think the Earth

03:04.540 --> 03:06.780
was flat in the first place?

03:06.780 --> 03:08.960
Let's find out and dive into the first documentary

03:08.960 --> 03:10.840
I saw while I was researching Flat Earth,

03:10.840 --> 03:13.300
Odd TV's The True Earth.

03:13.300 --> 03:16.580
Like everyone else, you were born into bondage,

03:16.580 --> 03:20.180
born into a prison for your mind.

03:20.180 --> 03:22.140
Buckle your seatbelt, Dorothy,

03:22.140 --> 03:24.660
because Kansas is going bye-bye.

03:24.660 --> 03:27.540
Take the red pill like in The Matrix.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.620
The Matrix is a good movie.

03:30.980 --> 03:33.100
Oh, God, I've got to make that Night in the Woods video.

03:33.100 --> 03:35.060
Our daily observations of the Earth

03:35.060 --> 03:38.140
are consistent with a flat and stationary surface.

03:38.140 --> 03:40.500
Most, if not all, ancient civilizations

03:40.500 --> 03:42.540
knew that the Earth was flat.

03:42.540 --> 03:44.220
Okay, that's an interesting start.

03:44.220 --> 03:45.220
Um, chapter two.

03:45.220 --> 03:47.580
That's not how knowledge works!

03:47.580 --> 03:51.860
Okay, so philosophers and linguists and discoursists

03:51.860 --> 03:55.820
and those ivory tower Marxists I've heard so much about

03:55.820 --> 04:00.300
argue incessantly on the concepts of knowledge and truth.

04:00.300 --> 04:03.020
They're all wrong, and I'm right, and here's how it works.

04:03.020 --> 04:06.500
People don't simply know things.

04:06.500 --> 04:09.460
People believe something to be true,

04:09.460 --> 04:13.460
or to put it another way, they think they know something.

04:13.460 --> 04:15.980
What Odd TV actually means here

04:15.980 --> 04:18.620
is that most ancient civilizations,

04:18.620 --> 04:21.900
or at least some of them, depending on how far back you go,

04:21.900 --> 04:25.380
thought they knew the Earth was flat.

04:25.380 --> 04:28.340
And he's ascribing knowledge to them

04:28.340 --> 04:29.980
so that they definitely knew this

04:29.980 --> 04:31.900
in order to make it seem more credible

04:31.900 --> 04:33.300
that that thing is true.

04:33.300 --> 04:34.820
The people of today would say

04:34.820 --> 04:38.180
that ancient cultures were ignorant and unaware,

04:38.180 --> 04:39.820
yet they accomplished great feats

04:39.820 --> 04:42.700
that we still can't accomplish to this day.

04:42.700 --> 04:45.220
The ancient Egyptians built the pyramids,

04:45.300 --> 04:48.700
so how could they be wrong about unrelated issues?

04:48.700 --> 04:51.180
The ancient Egyptians knew

04:51.180 --> 04:55.180
that pharaohs were living incarnations of a humanoid god

04:55.180 --> 04:57.900
with a crocodile's head named Sobek,

04:57.900 --> 05:00.100
who was the lord of semen

05:00.100 --> 05:03.100
and helped the sun move through the sky,

05:03.100 --> 05:05.580
presumably by blasting it with sperm.

05:05.580 --> 05:09.580
The ancient Egyptians knew this thousands of years ago,

05:09.580 --> 05:12.260
and yet every year we deny the sperm lord

05:12.260 --> 05:14.380
his offerings of mummified crocodiles.

05:14.380 --> 05:17.180
And once more, we threaten to awaken his anger.

05:17.180 --> 05:19.660
Those of you who think this technical difficulty was planned...

05:19.660 --> 05:21.020
I forgot about this part.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.940
This video in particular is great because, okay, spoilers.

05:23.940 --> 05:26.860
There aren't that many pro-flat Earth arguments.

05:26.860 --> 05:27.860
There's a couple of people

05:27.860 --> 05:29.460
who keep trying to come up with new ones,

05:29.460 --> 05:31.980
but really there's, like, five main ones,

05:31.980 --> 05:34.900
and then everyone keeps kind of ripping them off

05:34.900 --> 05:38.020
and rewording them and coming up with slightly different ways

05:38.020 --> 05:40.580
of saying the same thing over and over again.

05:40.580 --> 05:44.220
And this documentary goes one step further

05:44.220 --> 05:46.140
and rather than remaking those arguments

05:46.140 --> 05:48.300
for an 18th millionth time,

05:48.300 --> 05:50.220
it actually just borrows clips

05:50.220 --> 05:51.740
from videos people have already made.

05:51.740 --> 05:52.580
It's great.

05:52.580 --> 05:54.060
This is live on the air, okay?

05:54.060 --> 05:56.540
I'm gonna zoom in on the Earth in Photoshop.

05:56.540 --> 05:59.660
Image, adjust, levels,

05:59.660 --> 06:01.420
and I'm gonna bring the levels up.

06:02.540 --> 06:03.940
Uh-oh.

06:03.940 --> 06:05.180
What is that?

06:05.180 --> 06:09.180
Why is there a square box around the Earth

06:09.180 --> 06:11.020
allegedly taken from the scientists

06:11.020 --> 06:12.540
on the moon in Apollo 17?

06:13.420 --> 06:16.020
And people wonder why I don't trust NASA.

06:16.020 --> 06:18.140
That's why I don't trust NASA.

06:18.140 --> 06:18.980
I mean, they're always out there saying-

06:18.980 --> 06:20.700
Uh, uh, wait a second, mate.

06:20.700 --> 06:21.580
Wait, wait, wait.

06:24.260 --> 06:25.100
Hold on a second.

06:25.100 --> 06:25.940
Let me get my mouse.

06:25.940 --> 06:27.900
Let's quickly create a new image.

06:27.900 --> 06:30.500
Make it 3,000 by 3,000 pixels, 72 pixels per inch.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.020
Let's do a deep fake.

06:32.020 --> 06:36.100
Let's fake our own pale blue dot.

06:36.100 --> 06:37.820
That's not a, that's not a dot.

06:37.820 --> 06:39.980
You gotta hold shift to make it perfectly circular.

06:39.980 --> 06:41.900
Don't make that mistake next time, globalists.

06:41.900 --> 06:44.060
Oh, look, that's some shine.

06:44.060 --> 06:45.340
That's an ocean.

06:45.340 --> 06:46.980
Oh, that's the land we all live on.

06:46.980 --> 06:50.460
That's exactly what Ptolemy's map looks like.

06:50.460 --> 06:53.220
So if we were to do this adjustment right here

06:53.220 --> 06:55.660
with the image levels, turn it all the way up,

06:55.660 --> 06:58.180
you'll see that there's no, nothing goes up.

06:58.180 --> 06:59.100
Nothing goes up at all.

06:59.100 --> 06:59.940
Wow, look.

06:59.940 --> 07:01.420
If only they'd properly cut the Earth out,

07:01.420 --> 07:02.860
NASA could have gotten away with it

07:02.860 --> 07:05.260
if it weren't for those meddling Photoshop users.

07:05.260 --> 07:06.860
Let's save it as a JPEG,

07:06.860 --> 07:08.420
and let's make it medium compression.

07:08.420 --> 07:10.300
So this is like an average amount of JPEG compression

07:10.300 --> 07:11.340
for an image on the internet.

07:11.340 --> 07:14.740
Now let's, let's quickly open up our untitled 1.JPEG

07:14.740 --> 07:16.580
in Photoshop ourselves.

07:16.580 --> 07:18.980
Now let's turn the levels up.

07:20.100 --> 07:21.940
Oh my God.

07:21.940 --> 07:23.180
Oh my God.

07:23.180 --> 07:27.060
It's a fake Earth picture that wasn't cut out properly.

07:27.060 --> 07:28.940
It's JPEG compression.

07:28.940 --> 07:30.300
You fucking idiot.

07:30.300 --> 07:33.020
Okay, I'm already incredibly bored of this documentary.

07:33.020 --> 07:36.460
It's the same music clip playing over and over

07:36.460 --> 07:38.940
for 30 minutes, and it's jarring having all these

07:38.940 --> 07:40.660
other voices just kind of come in.

07:41.620 --> 07:44.100
It's, it's just not, it's just not very well made.

07:44.100 --> 07:47.460
And I've decided to just move on to other people's videos,

07:47.460 --> 07:49.500
which usually make the same points anyway.

07:49.500 --> 07:50.780
And we might even run into one of the videos

07:50.780 --> 07:51.620
that they stole.

07:51.620 --> 07:54.180
But one thing I do want to bring up is a meme

07:54.180 --> 07:55.980
that I saw posted here first,

07:55.980 --> 07:57.700
and I've seen it around since then,

07:57.700 --> 07:58.980
towards the end of the documentary.

07:58.980 --> 08:00.060
And when I was watching the first time,

08:00.060 --> 08:02.500
I had to pause and just kind of laugh at it.

08:02.500 --> 08:03.900
It's, it's this picture here.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.820
It's so fascinating.

08:05.820 --> 08:08.060
It's so direct.

08:08.060 --> 08:10.700
And it doesn't get what it's really saying.

08:10.700 --> 08:13.460
Like, just maybe don't brag too triumphantly

08:13.460 --> 08:16.460
about how you don't read books.

08:16.460 --> 08:18.620
Chapter three, he who smelts it.

08:18.620 --> 08:20.260
Anyway, one of the main folks credited

08:20.260 --> 08:23.380
with getting the ball rolling in Flat Earth,

08:23.380 --> 08:25.500
just a little joke from me to you,

08:25.500 --> 08:28.500
is Mark Sargent and his video series

08:28.500 --> 08:30.540
entitled Flat Earth Clues.

08:30.540 --> 08:33.980
I've now heard about two or three dozen people

08:33.980 --> 08:35.980
say that this series is what really got them

08:35.980 --> 08:37.820
into the whole thing and taking it seriously.

08:37.820 --> 08:40.420
Are we inside a Truman Show-enclosed world

08:40.420 --> 08:42.100
thousands of miles wide?

08:42.100 --> 08:43.980
It's just like in the Truman Show.

08:43.980 --> 08:45.140
Oh, God.

08:45.140 --> 08:46.580
No, no, be nice, be nice.

08:46.580 --> 08:48.900
Growing up on South Whidbey Island, Washington,

08:48.900 --> 08:50.460
Mark Sargent started his career

08:50.460 --> 08:52.180
playing computer games professionally

08:52.180 --> 08:53.460
in Boulder, Colorado.

08:53.460 --> 08:54.900
Oh, great, a fellow gamer.

08:54.900 --> 08:56.140
He must be reasonable.

08:56.140 --> 08:58.660
Early in 2015, he released a series of YouTube videos

08:58.660 --> 08:59.940
titled Flat Earth Clues,

08:59.940 --> 09:01.260
which delves into the possibility

09:01.260 --> 09:03.140
of our human civilization actually being inside

09:03.140 --> 09:06.540
a Truman Show-like enclosed, you already said

09:06.580 --> 09:08.220
Truman Show earlier in the description.

09:08.220 --> 09:10.900
Like, at least reference a different movie.

09:10.900 --> 09:13.500
In other words, this is the video series

09:13.500 --> 09:15.540
that everyone else is cribbing from,

09:15.540 --> 09:17.620
so we should probably check it out, shouldn't we?

09:17.620 --> 09:18.860
Two hours.

09:18.860 --> 09:20.060
I always wanted to do this joke

09:20.060 --> 09:21.860
and this actually took me two hours.

09:23.100 --> 09:24.580
Well, that was a waste of time.

09:24.580 --> 09:27.340
Okay, I've now watched Mark's entire 14-part

09:27.340 --> 09:29.700
plus extras series about how the Earth is flat,

09:29.700 --> 09:31.740
which took a couple of hours,

09:31.740 --> 09:34.100
and what really jumps out at me

09:34.100 --> 09:38.620
is how shockingly boring and unconvincing it is.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.820
Like, you think this is the original one,

09:40.820 --> 09:42.260
this is the one that got him,

09:42.260 --> 09:46.020
and it's a slideshow with, like, a guy kind of rambling,

09:46.020 --> 09:48.420
and he talks, like, he's really convinced,

09:48.420 --> 09:49.820
he knows the truth,

09:49.820 --> 09:52.740
and I assume people believe this

09:52.740 --> 09:55.460
because they're like, well, he sounds really into it,

09:55.460 --> 09:57.940
he must be onto something,

09:57.940 --> 10:02.140
but it's, like, really, really unconvincing.

10:02.140 --> 10:03.780
In order to summarize the point

10:03.780 --> 10:06.140
in any one of those videos that they make,

10:06.140 --> 10:09.220
you would have to edit around and cut across in time

10:09.220 --> 10:12.220
so much to kind of formulate the actual point

10:12.220 --> 10:13.700
so much that it would feel deceptive,

10:13.700 --> 10:16.340
like I'm sort of pulling some kind of trick

10:16.340 --> 10:20.780
by trying to get to the point he's making in a simpler way,

10:20.780 --> 10:22.740
and the evidence that he refers to

10:22.740 --> 10:24.700
is so thin on the ground

10:24.700 --> 10:27.460
that it doesn't even meet any burden of proof

10:27.460 --> 10:30.180
for it to be something that I would need to debunk anyway.

10:30.180 --> 10:32.020
Part 7, for example, long haul

10:32.020 --> 10:33.580
is the one that really sticks out to me.

10:33.580 --> 10:37.340
It takes him 10 minutes to effectively say,

10:37.340 --> 10:38.980
I looked up some flights,

10:38.980 --> 10:40.860
and I think they show the Earth is flat.

10:40.860 --> 10:45.380
That's all he had to say, but it takes 10 minutes.

10:45.380 --> 10:47.220
I promised myself when I was researching

10:47.220 --> 10:48.700
something like Flat Earth

10:48.700 --> 10:51.460
that I would try and find the strongest possible versions

10:51.460 --> 10:53.660
of any argument that I responded to or debunked

10:53.660 --> 10:57.380
because with a movement as big and full of all kinds

10:57.380 --> 11:00.300
of sort of amateur people as Flat Earth,

11:00.300 --> 11:04.380
it's very easy to find someone making the point very badly

11:04.380 --> 11:06.260
and go, ha, and then pretend

11:06.260 --> 11:08.220
you've discredited the entire argument,

11:08.220 --> 11:09.900
and I didn't want to do that,

11:09.900 --> 11:12.140
and I just want to acknowledge here that it's really weird

11:12.140 --> 11:14.820
that the guy everyone credits with getting them in on it

11:14.820 --> 11:17.340
is, the videos are bad.

11:17.340 --> 11:19.740
Like, watch them, please, if you can stand it.

11:19.740 --> 11:22.620
It's just not very well put together,

11:22.620 --> 11:24.620
and that's just a bit weird to me

11:24.620 --> 11:28.220
because they're supposed to be the best ones.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.900
Take the long-haul flight one I mentioned already.

11:30.900 --> 11:32.140
Two months after that came out,

11:32.140 --> 11:34.500
someone who's clearly seen that one

11:34.500 --> 11:37.860
has already honed the point that Sargent was trying to make

11:37.860 --> 11:40.700
down into one that's actually a good video,

11:40.700 --> 11:43.260
and that video has, like, six times more views.

11:43.260 --> 11:44.500
We'll get to that video in a second,

11:44.500 --> 11:47.780
but first, if the globe model is wrong,

11:47.780 --> 11:49.740
what's the alternative?

11:49.740 --> 11:50.900
I think it's time we looked at

11:50.900 --> 11:53.940
what a Flat Earth map actually looks like.

11:53.940 --> 11:57.740
Chapter four, Discworld, but not the fun one.

11:57.740 --> 11:59.060
This is a poster I had made

11:59.060 --> 12:01.540
of Gleason's new standard map of the world.

12:01.540 --> 12:03.460
It was made in the late 1800s,

12:03.460 --> 12:06.020
and it shows what purports to be

12:06.020 --> 12:08.700
what the Earth actually looks like when it's flat.

12:08.700 --> 12:11.820
Now, this isn't the exact map that Flat Earthers use.

12:11.820 --> 12:13.780
What they use is a version of this

12:13.780 --> 12:15.460
that's projected the same way.

12:15.460 --> 12:16.300
There are lots of different ways

12:16.300 --> 12:17.740
you can project planet Earth.

12:17.740 --> 12:20.420
The Gleason map and other supposedly slightly more accurate

12:20.420 --> 12:22.780
and realistic Flat Earth maps

12:22.780 --> 12:24.820
aren't actually just made up from something.

12:24.820 --> 12:26.580
They're based on a type of map projection

12:26.580 --> 12:27.820
that already existed,

12:27.820 --> 12:30.700
known as azimuthal equidistant projection,

12:30.700 --> 12:33.380
not named for its creator, Philip Azimuth,

12:33.380 --> 12:34.860
because I just made that guy up,

12:34.860 --> 12:37.020
and that projection method isn't completely useless.

12:37.020 --> 12:39.220
It's not just a silly picture.

12:39.220 --> 12:40.580
It's good for being able to tell

12:40.580 --> 12:42.700
what angle and distance you are from the North Pole.

12:42.700 --> 12:44.420
This is really accurate to where you are

12:44.420 --> 12:45.780
in relation to the North Pole,

12:45.780 --> 12:48.300
especially compared to other projections

12:48.300 --> 12:50.500
where the North Pole is, like, the wrong size

12:50.500 --> 12:51.620
or in the wrong place

12:51.620 --> 12:54.180
because otherwise you wouldn't be able to see it properly

12:54.180 --> 12:57.540
because flat maps are just inherently always a bit wrong.

12:57.540 --> 13:01.460
It also, as you can see, looks pretty nice.

13:01.460 --> 13:03.620
In fact, a stylized version of this projection

13:03.620 --> 13:06.820
is used as the logo for the UN

13:06.820 --> 13:08.980
because they're in on it, obviously.

13:08.980 --> 13:10.300
Most notable things about this map,

13:10.300 --> 13:13.340
the North Pole is now directly in the center of the Earth,

13:13.340 --> 13:16.260
and instead of there being a South Pole anywhere,

13:16.260 --> 13:18.740
it's now encircling the entire Earth

13:18.740 --> 13:20.620
in a giant wall of ice.

13:20.620 --> 13:21.660
Now I know what you're thinking.

13:21.660 --> 13:23.420
Does this map hold any water?

13:23.420 --> 13:25.500
And the answer is, that's what the ice is for.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.900
By the way, does that mean global warming

13:26.900 --> 13:29.460
is now, like, way, way worse?

13:29.460 --> 13:32.820
Because, like, if the ice were melted,

13:32.820 --> 13:35.020
all the water would flow out

13:35.020 --> 13:40.540
and we'd all die of no-water-itis.

13:40.540 --> 13:42.780
I mean, on globe Earth,

13:42.780 --> 13:49.140
we'd all just drown and then boil instead.

13:49.140 --> 13:50.260
Yay!

13:50.300 --> 13:51.620
Another feature of this map

13:51.620 --> 13:53.900
is that what used to be the Southern Hemisphere

13:53.900 --> 13:58.140
is now much further away from itself, as it were.

13:58.140 --> 14:00.300
Australia is now much further away

14:00.300 --> 14:02.860
from Africa or South America.

14:02.860 --> 14:06.500
And also, everything is increasingly distorted

14:06.500 --> 14:08.220
the further out you get.

14:08.220 --> 14:11.780
Australia is now much, much wider than it used to be,

14:11.780 --> 14:14.980
even though people have actually measured Australia,

14:14.980 --> 14:18.020
and it's about as long as it is wide.

14:18.020 --> 14:20.780
But clearly, Sobek got to those guys, too.

14:20.780 --> 14:22.540
How does this affect travel?

14:22.540 --> 14:25.140
Because, obviously, now that all the shapes

14:25.140 --> 14:27.020
and distances are very different,

14:27.020 --> 14:29.580
especially in the Southern Hemisphere,

14:29.580 --> 14:32.740
surely flight plans would be affected by this?

14:32.740 --> 14:35.620
They'd have to account for the non-curvature of the Earth

14:35.620 --> 14:37.940
and everything being in a different place?

14:37.940 --> 14:41.220
Well, luckily, this is something Mark Sargent

14:41.220 --> 14:44.220
and the clever disc boys at the Flat Earth Society

14:44.220 --> 14:46.820
say actually makes more sense on a flat Earth.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.340
Chapter five, how do airlines work?

14:50.340 --> 14:51.540
Here's a video entitled,

14:51.540 --> 14:53.100
The Earth is Flat.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.820
The Planes Help to Prove the Plane.

14:55.820 --> 14:58.140
It's got over 900,000 views.

14:58.140 --> 15:00.260
This is the video that I would say is something

15:00.260 --> 15:01.780
of an improvement on the arguments

15:01.780 --> 15:04.740
that Mark Sargent makes in his video entitled Long Haul.

15:04.740 --> 15:08.180
The arguments are still wrong, but they're made better,

15:08.180 --> 15:10.780
so points for that, plus that pun.

15:10.780 --> 15:12.540
I mean, oh, boy.

15:12.540 --> 15:14.460
He looks up trips from Sydney, Australia,

15:14.460 --> 15:15.900
to Santiago, Chile,

15:15.900 --> 15:18.460
and notes that getting there requires multiple stops

15:18.460 --> 15:20.740
at other airports that are relatively out of the way

15:20.740 --> 15:22.580
and inefficient on the globe model,

15:22.580 --> 15:23.700
but on the flat Earth model,

15:23.700 --> 15:25.540
they form an almost straight line.

15:25.540 --> 15:28.380
You have to actually get up into the Northern Hemisphere

15:28.380 --> 15:30.580
and then come back down,

15:30.580 --> 15:33.140
so that doesn't make any sense.

15:33.140 --> 15:36.620
So I mapped it on the flat Earth map,

15:36.620 --> 15:37.660
and whoa.

15:37.660 --> 15:38.500
Whoa.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.940
This is a huge thing for flat Earthers

15:39.940 --> 15:41.940
because unlike all the stuff they have to just ignore

15:41.940 --> 15:45.340
or prove is a big lie that didn't happen,

15:45.340 --> 15:48.020
this is something which supposedly proves

15:48.020 --> 15:50.020
that the flat Earth model is true.

15:50.020 --> 15:52.740
Mark Sargent says this is the thing you should start with

15:52.740 --> 15:54.860
if you're trying to explain the whole thing to someone.

15:54.860 --> 15:56.780
If you were looking to show someone

15:56.780 --> 16:00.540
how to view the flat Earth from a practical point of view,

16:00.540 --> 16:02.340
this is the example I would use.

16:02.340 --> 16:03.940
Mark, you could have started with that

16:03.940 --> 16:06.060
and not waited until part seven,

16:06.060 --> 16:06.980
like an hour in.

16:06.980 --> 16:08.740
Please hire an editor.

16:08.740 --> 16:10.260
There are so many counterpoints to this.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.380
I don't know where to start, really.

16:12.380 --> 16:16.100
Um, I suppose we should start with London City Airport.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.300
It makes far more business sense for airlines

16:18.300 --> 16:20.220
to offer shorter connecting flights

16:20.220 --> 16:22.340
that can be used as part of a wider trip

16:22.340 --> 16:24.340
than one direct flight to the one place

16:24.340 --> 16:26.300
that one group of people might happen to go.

16:26.300 --> 16:27.700
You know airports aren't magic.

16:27.700 --> 16:29.300
Like, it takes a certain amount of time

16:29.300 --> 16:31.660
for a plane to take off and land on a runway,

16:31.660 --> 16:33.380
and there's only so many runways.

16:33.380 --> 16:34.660
You think London City Airport,

16:34.660 --> 16:37.980
with its minuscule, piddly little piss runway,

16:37.980 --> 16:40.100
has the time to furnish flights to Chile?

16:40.220 --> 16:42.220
What are you talking about, mate?

16:42.220 --> 16:44.220
That said, that doesn't mean that long-distance flights

16:44.220 --> 16:45.300
like this never happen.

16:45.300 --> 16:48.580
There's actually a direct flight from Sydney to Santiago,

16:48.580 --> 16:50.260
Qantas QF27.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.900
It goes nonstop and takes way less time

16:52.900 --> 16:54.300
than the non-direct routes.

16:54.300 --> 16:57.460
On a flat Earth map, QF27 would take far longer

16:57.460 --> 16:59.420
than the supposedly direct paths,

16:59.420 --> 17:02.060
and also the distance would be so much longer

17:02.060 --> 17:05.100
that the plane would run out of fuel and crash in the ocean.

17:05.100 --> 17:07.980
How does this guy deal with the existence of this flight,

17:07.980 --> 17:09.860
or a flight with just one connection

17:09.860 --> 17:12.300
that doesn't go the direct route on a flat Earth map?

17:12.300 --> 17:15.020
Well, they actually do pop up on his flight tracker.

17:15.020 --> 17:18.100
That's the first clue I found to these flights existing.

17:18.100 --> 17:22.020
But I don't think this flight ever takes off.

17:22.020 --> 17:26.820
Uh, it's available only Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday also.

17:26.820 --> 17:29.820
Kind of pinch you out and make you do something different.

17:29.820 --> 17:33.180
He actually says that they're not real.

17:33.180 --> 17:38.540
I don't think either one of these two flights are real.

17:38.540 --> 17:43.500
Um, they're just kind of there to, um,

17:43.500 --> 17:46.060
keep guys like me from figuring this shit out.

17:46.060 --> 17:48.900
He sees through Qantas's dastardly trick

17:48.900 --> 17:51.660
to sell tickets to a plane that's real.

17:51.660 --> 17:55.020
You can watch footage of the flight.

17:55.020 --> 17:57.500
Look, why would Qantas do all of this

17:57.500 --> 17:59.620
just to make people think that the Earth was a globe?

17:59.620 --> 18:00.940
What do they get from that?

18:00.940 --> 18:04.540
Like, what's the... I don't understand.

18:04.540 --> 18:06.780
The guy tries to do Johannesburg to Perth, too.

18:06.820 --> 18:10.980
And once again, we only have one non-stop.

18:10.980 --> 18:12.940
Almost as if there's reasons

18:12.940 --> 18:14.860
why you wouldn't have that many flights

18:14.860 --> 18:18.180
going that one direct flight.

18:18.180 --> 18:18.900
Almost.

18:18.900 --> 18:20.540
Uh, these two in black,

18:20.540 --> 18:24.060
this is the non-stop that they have to Perth.

18:24.060 --> 18:25.580
But the reason I put these in black

18:25.580 --> 18:28.660
is because I don't think they exist either.

18:28.660 --> 18:30.220
Oh, no, of course not.

18:30.220 --> 18:34.100
I mean, I've actually met someone who's been on that flight.

18:34.100 --> 18:36.500
But whatever, maybe they're in on it, too.

18:36.540 --> 18:37.700
Maybe I'm in on it, too.

18:37.700 --> 18:38.820
Hail Sobek.

18:38.820 --> 18:41.620
We need to keep everyone thinking the Earth is a globe.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.540
That way we can...

18:43.540 --> 18:45.140
Um, hang on one second.

18:45.420 --> 18:48.900
Yeah, why are we doing this again?

18:48.900 --> 18:50.980
Uh, I thought it would be funny.

18:50.980 --> 18:53.740
When he maps those supposed more direct trips

18:53.740 --> 18:55.140
he found onto the Flat Earth,

18:55.140 --> 18:58.620
and by maps, I mean draws shit squiggly lines

18:58.620 --> 19:00.980
that in no way match up with the flight plans,

19:00.980 --> 19:03.780
one of them doesn't make sense on the Flat Earth either.

19:03.780 --> 19:05.620
It goes all the way out of the way to Sydney

19:05.620 --> 19:07.580
before it doubles back and heads to Perth.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.540
Uh, these are all the flights to Sydney.

19:09.540 --> 19:14.780
So it still looks like a pretty long shot to Sydney.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.620
Um, but who knows?

19:16.620 --> 19:19.220
Maybe this map isn't even correct.

19:19.220 --> 19:21.220
Who knows? I don't know.

19:21.220 --> 19:22.620
Mm-hmm.

19:22.620 --> 19:23.860
Mm-hmm.

19:23.860 --> 19:25.260
Maybe.

19:25.260 --> 19:31.380
Maybe this map of the Flat Earth isn't correct.

19:31.380 --> 19:34.380
Maybe it's not.

19:34.380 --> 19:35.340
Maybe.

19:35.340 --> 19:38.620
Chapter six, where's the curve?

19:38.620 --> 19:39.380
Oh, there it is.

19:39.380 --> 19:41.060
Another thing Flat Earthers dispute

19:41.060 --> 19:42.660
is the curvature of the Earth.

19:42.660 --> 19:44.700
I mean, if it's flat, it can't be curved

19:44.700 --> 19:47.020
can it? Well, I guess it could be slightly convex,

19:47.020 --> 19:49.020
but they don't bring that up for some reason.

19:49.020 --> 19:51.460
The main way they do this consists of filming horizons

19:51.460 --> 19:53.580
or finding footage of horizons and saying,

19:53.580 --> 19:55.260
well, I don't see a curve,

19:55.260 --> 19:58.340
which, uh, you can't see the curvature

19:58.340 --> 19:59.460
that close to the ground.

19:59.460 --> 20:01.340
Perspective doesn't work that way,

20:01.340 --> 20:03.460
and then they go on to assert that all footage

20:03.460 --> 20:06.180
that does show a curvature from high up is faked,

20:06.180 --> 20:08.700
either on purpose by, like, movie studios

20:08.700 --> 20:11.220
working for NASA or accidentally through flaws

20:11.220 --> 20:12.340
in camera equipment.

20:12.380 --> 20:14.340
Some types of wide-angle camera lenses

20:14.340 --> 20:15.620
distort perspective,

20:15.620 --> 20:18.380
and almost all small action cameras like GoPros

20:18.380 --> 20:21.500
have very wide-angle lenses to film as much as possible.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.620
The assertion Flatties then make is,

20:23.620 --> 20:25.540
well, the appearance of a curvature

20:25.540 --> 20:28.340
is therefore the result of looking at the flat horizon

20:28.340 --> 20:29.540
with these lenses,

20:29.540 --> 20:31.300
and if you correct the footage,

20:31.300 --> 20:33.540
the Earth is clearly actually flat,

20:33.540 --> 20:36.180
like in this video by the channel called Flat Earth,

20:36.180 --> 20:37.620
although apparently its original name

20:37.620 --> 20:39.940
was the Mr. King Tuts.

20:39.940 --> 20:41.220
Someone rebranded.

20:41.220 --> 20:42.860
Where's the curvature of the Earth?

20:42.860 --> 20:45.020
None of you can debunk this video.

20:45.020 --> 20:47.100
Anyone with half a brain can see how they use

20:47.100 --> 20:50.820
deceptive wide-angle fisheye lenses to deceive you.

20:50.820 --> 20:53.180
You can't use the word deceive twice in a sentence.

20:53.180 --> 20:54.140
That just doesn't scan.

20:54.140 --> 20:55.860
Oh, and in keeping with Flat Earthers

20:55.860 --> 20:57.140
just copying each other all the time,

20:57.140 --> 20:59.620
this video is literally just taken from another channel.

20:59.620 --> 21:02.460
Now, in my opinion, this is the actual closest

21:02.460 --> 21:04.140
that Flat Earthers have ever got

21:04.140 --> 21:06.780
to actually being right about, uh, anything.

21:06.780 --> 21:08.780
Here's a quick test I did with my old GoPro.

21:08.780 --> 21:10.780
The GoPro's wide lens means it can see

21:10.780 --> 21:11.660
a lot at once.

21:11.660 --> 21:13.500
In fact, it even saw the trash I was sure

21:13.500 --> 21:15.500
would be out of the shot and didn't bother picking up.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.860
However, this perspective is distorted.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.420
I can tell you right now my floor is flat

21:19.420 --> 21:21.020
and doesn't curve downwards here.

21:21.020 --> 21:22.500
As I move the GoPro closer

21:22.500 --> 21:25.140
to this totally normal-shaped sex museum postcard,

21:25.140 --> 21:27.980
we can see the distortion become even more exaggerated.

21:27.980 --> 21:29.900
The beautiful pride flag is ruined.

21:29.900 --> 21:31.820
It looks like Graham Linehan has touched it.

21:31.820 --> 21:33.260
This is me holding a measuring tape

21:33.260 --> 21:34.580
just to give another reference.

21:34.580 --> 21:37.060
The curvature of the Earth is definitely susceptible

21:37.060 --> 21:39.460
to being exaggerated by wide-angle lenses,

21:39.460 --> 21:40.900
but like with JPEG artifacts,

21:40.900 --> 21:42.580
you can't just move a slider and say,

21:42.580 --> 21:43.700
ah, it proves I'm right.

21:43.700 --> 21:45.100
It's not.

21:45.100 --> 21:48.460
Look, I'm gonna use my video editing magical skills again

21:48.460 --> 21:49.460
to show you something.

21:49.460 --> 21:52.820
There isn't, like, a magic fix fisheye lens button

21:52.820 --> 21:54.020
in a video editor.

21:54.020 --> 21:55.900
Whenever I've had to correct fisheye lens footage

21:55.900 --> 21:58.300
for a video, I've had to do it by using an effect

21:58.300 --> 21:59.460
that corrects distortion

21:59.460 --> 22:01.500
and then dialing in the angles manually,

22:01.500 --> 22:03.700
and this stuff is really hard to do by eye.

22:03.700 --> 22:04.980
The best technique for doing this

22:04.980 --> 22:07.460
is to find something you know is supposed to be flat

22:07.460 --> 22:09.860
and then correct until it looks flat.

22:09.860 --> 22:12.300
See, that tape turned out to be there for a reason.

22:12.300 --> 22:13.300
A clever trick.

22:13.300 --> 22:16.300
Now, I'm gonna give you three guesses

22:16.300 --> 22:19.300
what part of the footage

22:19.300 --> 22:21.420
Flat Earthers use

22:21.420 --> 22:23.620
when they are trying to correct footage

22:23.620 --> 22:26.020
to prove that the Earth is flat.

22:27.660 --> 22:28.780
Did you get it?

22:28.780 --> 22:31.940
It's hard to see, but the correction is clearly too much

22:31.940 --> 22:33.220
if you know what to look for.

22:33.220 --> 22:34.860
On the ground, certain things curve

22:34.860 --> 22:36.900
in weird directions just slightly,

22:36.940 --> 22:38.900
and at certain angles during the video,

22:38.900 --> 22:41.940
the Earth starts to look slightly concave.

22:41.940 --> 22:43.900
Our daily observations of the Earth

22:43.900 --> 22:46.900
are consistent with a flat and stationary surface.

22:46.900 --> 22:50.100
I just want to acknowledge how fucking funny it was

22:50.100 --> 22:52.780
when I was watching this documentary for the first time

22:52.780 --> 22:54.260
and it fades from a thing saying,

22:54.260 --> 22:57.220
our world is flat and it's a wide-angle shot

22:57.220 --> 22:58.900
that's not been corrected properly,

22:58.900 --> 23:00.380
so it looks like it's curved.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.860
It's fucking, it looks like the planet is concave.

23:02.860 --> 23:04.780
How do you fuck it up this bad?

23:04.780 --> 23:06.580
From this high up, the Earth's curvature

23:06.580 --> 23:08.660
would, in fact, be visible,

23:08.660 --> 23:10.860
but probably very slight.

23:10.860 --> 23:13.020
You'd have to use a ruler to make sure.

23:13.020 --> 23:15.380
But exactly how curved it would have been

23:15.380 --> 23:17.300
is hard to tell because of the nature

23:17.300 --> 23:19.700
of the footage filmed with these lenses.

23:19.700 --> 23:24.140
You know, the reality is the Earth is flat.

23:24.140 --> 23:25.860
You can't actually see the curvature of the Earth

23:25.860 --> 23:27.340
from the window of a passenger plane.

23:27.340 --> 23:28.900
They don't go high enough to show

23:28.900 --> 23:31.380
more than, like, a degree or two, basically.

23:31.380 --> 23:33.740
You can see the curvature of the horizon,

23:33.740 --> 23:35.100
but only from high up,

23:35.100 --> 23:37.500
and I mean really high up.

23:37.500 --> 23:40.700
Not airline high, not even Mary Jane high.

23:40.700 --> 23:42.540
I'm talking U-2 high.

23:42.540 --> 23:45.980
Come on in here, Bono, The Edge,

23:45.980 --> 23:49.020
Adam...Smane?

23:49.020 --> 23:50.460
Not that U-2, silly.

23:50.460 --> 23:51.940
Ha, we have fun.

23:51.940 --> 23:53.900
I mean, of course, the Lockheed U-2,

23:53.900 --> 23:56.860
a high-altitude spy plane used by the U.S. government.

23:56.860 --> 23:58.580
You might remember the U-2-4.

23:58.580 --> 24:00.660
Its operating height of 70,000 feet,

24:00.660 --> 24:02.740
almost three times the height of a commercial aircraft,

24:02.740 --> 24:04.580
violating international law numerous times,

24:04.580 --> 24:06.260
getting caught violating international law

24:06.260 --> 24:07.380
numerous times when it turned out

24:07.380 --> 24:08.420
it wasn't very good at spying,

24:08.420 --> 24:10.580
getting shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960,

24:10.580 --> 24:13.300
getting shot down in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis

24:13.300 --> 24:15.100
and contributing to the Cold War nearly escalating

24:15.100 --> 24:16.220
into full-scale nuclear war.

24:16.220 --> 24:17.940
Luckily, the U.S. government gave upon

24:17.940 --> 24:19.820
illegally spying on other nations

24:19.820 --> 24:22.860
with a shit plane they can see in 1917.

24:22.860 --> 24:24.220
Sorry, 1918.

24:24.220 --> 24:25.340
Wait, hang on.

24:25.340 --> 24:26.660
They're still using it!

24:26.660 --> 24:29.660
Here's James May, the least shit guy from Top Gear,

24:29.660 --> 24:30.900
taking a ride in one.

24:30.900 --> 24:33.340
You can see that at conventional airplane heights,

24:33.340 --> 24:34.820
the horizon is fairly flat.

24:34.820 --> 24:36.700
Hopefully, this early shot of the horizon

24:36.700 --> 24:38.500
looking really flat establishes

24:38.500 --> 24:40.660
that the lenses aren't distorting anything here.

24:40.660 --> 24:42.460
As he reaches the maximum height,

24:42.460 --> 24:44.660
the atmosphere stops being breathable

24:44.660 --> 24:47.020
and the sky starts to turn black.

24:47.020 --> 24:48.620
At the higher altitudes,

24:48.620 --> 24:52.020
we can finally see both the staggering beauty

24:52.020 --> 24:54.140
of our little blue world,

24:54.140 --> 24:58.180
but also a slight yet pronounced curve on the horizon.

24:58.180 --> 25:01.420
So I think it's fair to say that, in conclusion,

25:01.420 --> 25:03.980
ha-ha, the Earth's curved slightly.

25:03.980 --> 25:05.100
I win.

25:05.100 --> 25:06.460
This has just been a brief rundown

25:06.460 --> 25:08.060
of the flat Earth points that I feel

25:08.060 --> 25:10.300
are at least more credible than the rest.

25:10.300 --> 25:14.740
They get increasingly weird and tangential from here on out.

25:14.740 --> 25:17.580
For example, almost all flat Earthers

25:17.580 --> 25:19.020
say that the moon landing was faked

25:19.020 --> 25:20.900
because if we actually went to the moon

25:20.900 --> 25:22.020
and took pictures of the Earth

25:22.020 --> 25:23.580
and it showed that the Earth was a globe

25:23.580 --> 25:24.980
because it's in different positions

25:24.980 --> 25:27.020
and different in different pictures,

25:27.020 --> 25:28.060
you can't have done that.

25:28.940 --> 25:30.420
So the moon landing has to all be faked

25:30.420 --> 25:32.980
with the extra caveat that goes on top

25:32.980 --> 25:34.820
of the regular moon landing conspiracies,

25:34.820 --> 25:36.300
which is that it was all done

25:36.300 --> 25:38.740
simply to make people think the Earth was round

25:38.740 --> 25:39.860
for some reason.

25:39.860 --> 25:41.860
They try and counter the fact that you can't see things

25:41.860 --> 25:43.220
on the other side of the horizon

25:43.220 --> 25:45.380
by claiming that cameras with long enough zoom lenses,

25:45.380 --> 25:47.020
like the Nikon P900,

25:47.020 --> 25:50.020
can actually show things that should be behind the horizon,

25:50.020 --> 25:52.060
which, uh, no.

25:53.140 --> 25:54.980
That's not what's happening.

25:54.980 --> 25:56.660
The camera can see further

25:56.660 --> 25:58.940
than your disgusting human eyes,

25:58.940 --> 26:00.100
which I thought the point was

26:00.100 --> 26:02.020
they were the only things you could trust,

26:02.020 --> 26:03.660
but no, apparently now we're supposed to trust

26:03.660 --> 26:05.420
the globe heads at Nikon.

26:05.420 --> 26:07.220
I've pronounced that company's name

26:07.220 --> 26:09.620
both of the ways that people pronounce it now,

26:09.620 --> 26:11.740
so everyone gets to yell at me.

26:11.740 --> 26:14.420
Also, Mark Sargent has actually said this.

26:14.420 --> 26:19.420
He thinks that the moon gives off its own cold light,

26:19.740 --> 26:21.340
which makes things colder

26:21.340 --> 26:22.660
and therefore proves that the moon

26:22.660 --> 26:24.500
isn't just a rock floating in space.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.900
It's part of the big firmament

26:25.900 --> 26:27.540
that some flat earthers think...

26:28.820 --> 26:29.660
Just one second.

26:33.380 --> 26:34.980
Arranging this to be in the shot properly

26:34.980 --> 26:36.380
makes it actually really hard to dial.

26:36.380 --> 26:38.660
I want you to appreciate that.

26:38.660 --> 26:39.780
Hello.

26:39.780 --> 26:40.620
Hi there.

26:40.620 --> 26:42.420
Is that popular gaming YouTuber UpIsNotJump,

26:42.420 --> 26:45.820
who also incidentally has a master's in chemistry?

26:45.820 --> 26:47.580
Yep, this is the third time I'm recording this

26:47.580 --> 26:49.060
because I got my lines wrong the first time

26:49.060 --> 26:50.340
and then the microphone wasn't on.

26:50.340 --> 26:51.180
Oh.

26:51.380 --> 26:55.220
Excuse me.

26:55.220 --> 26:57.580
Can moonlight make things cold?

26:57.580 --> 26:59.980
No, the moon reflects light from the sun

26:59.980 --> 27:01.740
and the intrinsic property of waves

27:01.740 --> 27:03.660
is basically all waves have energy

27:03.660 --> 27:04.900
because they have a frequency.

27:04.900 --> 27:07.180
It's just the nature of the universe.

27:07.180 --> 27:08.620
Oh, okay, cool, thanks.

27:08.620 --> 27:10.340
Great, yeah, that was easy.

27:10.340 --> 27:11.180
Bye.

27:11.180 --> 27:12.020
Wait, wait, you don't want me to do

27:12.020 --> 27:13.220
a funny sketch or something.

27:13.220 --> 27:14.820
I can do a joke here.

27:14.820 --> 27:16.740
No, the video's looking too long already.

27:16.740 --> 27:19.380
I've decided to leave in the tangent about fighter jets,

27:19.420 --> 27:21.220
so it's probably not worth it.

27:21.220 --> 27:22.060
No, wait, don't go.

27:22.060 --> 27:25.500
I can prove mathematically that this is the correct way.

27:25.500 --> 27:28.380
This all, I feel, leads to a necessary

27:28.380 --> 27:30.220
and important question.

27:30.220 --> 27:32.300
If all of the evidence for the flat Earth

27:32.300 --> 27:36.340
is so, well, easy to throw out,

27:36.340 --> 27:39.300
why do people actually believe it?

27:39.300 --> 27:41.500
Chapter seven, why do people believe things

27:41.500 --> 27:43.660
that are obviously wrong?

27:43.660 --> 27:44.500
Because they're stupid.

27:44.500 --> 27:45.460
Bye.

27:45.460 --> 27:49.060
Would you like to build a beautiful website easily?

27:50.140 --> 27:51.500
Good, so would I.

27:51.500 --> 27:52.900
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

27:52.900 --> 27:54.180
We're not actually gonna do that.

27:54.180 --> 27:55.620
That would be unreasonably rude.

27:55.620 --> 27:58.420
Let's take these people a bit more seriously than that.

27:58.420 --> 28:00.100
Some of them are clearly very knowledgeable.

28:00.100 --> 28:02.420
Some of them have, like, big, important degrees

28:02.420 --> 28:03.380
in serious fields.

28:03.380 --> 28:05.140
They know way much more than I do

28:05.140 --> 28:07.460
about all kinds of actually useful things.

28:08.260 --> 28:11.140
Some of them take evidence very seriously, clearly,

28:11.140 --> 28:13.860
and they believe in the scientific method.

28:13.860 --> 28:14.700
Not all of them.

28:14.900 --> 28:17.260
Some of them are not actually very knowledgeable

28:17.260 --> 28:19.860
about anything and seem to think Donald Trump

28:19.860 --> 28:23.340
is a genius and also he's their guy

28:23.340 --> 28:25.140
and he secretly knows the Earth is flat

28:25.140 --> 28:26.980
and he's gonna expose NASA.

28:26.980 --> 28:30.140
I suppose it would be disingenuous not to talk briefly

28:30.140 --> 28:32.220
about the really weird people.

28:32.220 --> 28:34.380
In fact, the misogyny thing in specific

28:34.380 --> 28:36.100
is really surprising.

28:36.100 --> 28:38.900
One of Mark Sargent's inner sphere, sorry, circle,

28:38.900 --> 28:41.020
Patricia Steer, gets a lot of hate

28:41.020 --> 28:42.540
from other factions of flat Earthers

28:42.540 --> 28:45.100
for supposedly just being in it to be popular.

28:45.100 --> 28:46.860
Or some go even as far as to say

28:46.860 --> 28:49.260
that she's actually a secret CIA plant

28:49.260 --> 28:51.580
designed to make flat Earth look bad

28:51.580 --> 28:54.460
and or trick people with her appearance

28:54.460 --> 28:58.860
into making them believe the wrong version of flat Earth.

28:59.820 --> 29:01.180
You better wake your ass up.

29:01.180 --> 29:03.900
All of them is fucking satanic puppets.

29:03.900 --> 29:06.700
Yes, that's why they flashed this one on TV.

29:06.700 --> 29:11.020
No doubt about it, it was put there by the CIA on YouTube

29:11.020 --> 29:13.980
to distract the masses that wanna learn the truth.

29:13.980 --> 29:15.220
Yes, the Earth is flat,

29:15.220 --> 29:17.740
but you can never take it from these sodomites.

29:17.740 --> 29:19.900
Of course, they go lead you in the wrong direction.

29:19.900 --> 29:20.860
Wake your ass up.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.780
There go your Patricia Speer right there.

29:22.780 --> 29:26.180
It is a plant by the CIA, 100%.

29:26.180 --> 29:27.900
Frankly, even the people who like Patricia

29:27.900 --> 29:29.380
are super weird about it.

29:29.380 --> 29:31.780
I mean, Mark himself made a video

29:31.780 --> 29:34.420
just dedicated to how pretty he thinks she is,

29:34.420 --> 29:36.620
which it's fine.

29:36.620 --> 29:38.780
It's okay to find someone attractive, that's okay.

29:38.780 --> 29:41.540
But it's a bit weird to like make a video

29:41.540 --> 29:44.740
about how pretty you think she is, right?

29:44.740 --> 29:46.460
Still not as bad as the people who think

29:46.460 --> 29:48.380
that she's a deep state plant

29:48.380 --> 29:51.140
designed to make flat Earthism look bad though.

29:51.140 --> 29:53.620
All the people zooming in on every picture of her face

29:53.620 --> 29:55.420
they can find in order to speculate

29:55.420 --> 29:57.380
that she's a secret trans woman.

29:57.380 --> 30:01.620
And I know what a 44-year-old female looks like.

30:01.620 --> 30:04.780
You are a 20-something.

30:04.780 --> 30:07.260
Being a woman in a conspiracy theorist movement

30:07.260 --> 30:09.780
is apparently grounds to have your body,

30:09.780 --> 30:11.820
history, goals, agenda,

30:11.820 --> 30:14.860
every single tiny thing about you speculated upon.

30:14.860 --> 30:17.500
You know, I try and jokingly make fun of people

30:17.500 --> 30:19.580
when people act weird on the Internet.

30:19.580 --> 30:20.420
Like, keep it light.

30:20.420 --> 30:22.260
But honestly, this stuff is so fucking disgusting

30:22.260 --> 30:24.180
I'm not even gonna make a joke here.

30:24.180 --> 30:25.860
Patricia's wrong about the Earth being flat,

30:25.860 --> 30:27.220
but she deserves to be in a move room

30:27.220 --> 30:28.260
that's better than this shit.

30:28.260 --> 30:29.260
Come on, guys.

30:29.260 --> 30:32.020
To be honest, the people treating Patricia like that

30:32.020 --> 30:34.220
and the people being mega racist

30:34.220 --> 30:35.860
on flat Earth Facebook pages

30:35.860 --> 30:38.100
seem to me like the real plants

30:38.100 --> 30:40.260
designed to make flat Eartherism look bad.

30:41.540 --> 30:44.020
They don't make it look as bad as this guy does, though.

I'm trying to misrepresent flat Earthers as misogynists.

30:58.380 --> 31:01.420
Flat Earthers don't inherently disrespect women, okay?

31:01.420 --> 31:03.380

Jeez. Ooh, that'll make his beliefs seem credible.

31:15.340 --> 31:17.020
Pfft. Oh, that's surprising.

31:17.020 --> 31:19.860
Like, two days before this video was going to go online,

31:19.860 --> 31:22.540
that guy's channel got deleted by YouTube.

31:22.540 --> 31:25.460
I wonder why. I guess it will always remain a mystery.

31:25.460 --> 31:29.100
Chapter nine, Flat Earth fucked up my recommendations

31:29.100 --> 31:31.100
and you have to suffer with me.

31:31.100 --> 31:33.940
Oh, great. I accidentally went to the shitty side of YouTube.

31:33.940 --> 31:37.620
You click on one vegan, flat Earth, neo-Nazi rap, but...

31:37.620 --> 31:39.100
Eh.

31:39.100 --> 31:40.980
I just had to say that phrase, but it's all true.

31:40.980 --> 31:43.900
And now my recommendations are full of the really weird people

31:43.900 --> 31:46.700
who seem a bit like they might be using flat Earth

31:46.700 --> 31:50.140
as a refuge for some kind of deep existential emptiness

31:50.140 --> 31:52.700
and film themselves walking around in public

31:52.700 --> 31:54.580
asking people if they think the Earth is flat

31:54.580 --> 31:56.900
in a Buffalo Wild Wings parking lot

31:56.900 --> 31:58.460
and yelling at people at a bar.

31:58.460 --> 32:02.380
You're saying that he dips his nose down,

32:02.380 --> 32:04.220
but you don't know how?

32:04.220 --> 32:05.740
You just... He dips his...

32:05.740 --> 32:08.340
You see there? I tried to have a conversation

32:08.340 --> 32:09.580
and, of course, they don't like it

32:09.580 --> 32:11.540
because they start losing the argument

32:11.540 --> 32:13.420
because they can't make any real points.

32:13.420 --> 32:15.460
Ah, my favorite kind of reasonable debate.

32:15.460 --> 32:17.780
The kind where you walk up to someone in public with a camera

32:17.780 --> 32:19.820
and demand they debunk flat Earth.

32:19.820 --> 32:22.860
He seems to be following the Ben Shapiro strategy of making videos

32:22.860 --> 32:24.140
where you give it a title like,

32:24.140 --> 32:27.380
oh, I kick their asses with my smart boy brain

32:27.380 --> 32:28.580
and then you actually watch it

32:28.580 --> 32:31.060
and it's them making complete ass of themselves.

32:31.060 --> 32:33.340
Thank you very much. Have a great night.

32:33.340 --> 32:35.300
You're disturbing, I guess.

32:35.300 --> 32:37.180
Okay, bye.

32:37.180 --> 32:39.660
It's going up online!

32:39.660 --> 32:42.180
26,000 subscribers!

32:42.180 --> 32:43.940
You think you can destroy me?

32:43.940 --> 32:45.100
Well, I'll have you know...

32:45.100 --> 32:46.900
Fucking Jesus Christ.

32:46.900 --> 32:49.460
Anyway, I think this was a productive day.

32:49.460 --> 32:50.300

Oh, God, in this one video, he's got a Lula Lander shirt on.

32:54.940 --> 32:59.660
He's made Lunar Module or Homeless Tweakers shelter

32:59.660 --> 33:02.300
and he's going around filming random people on their day off

33:02.300 --> 33:06.700
from work or at work asking them if they think the Earth is flat

33:06.700 --> 33:09.180
and they keep awkwardly nodding and saying he's right

33:09.180 --> 33:10.540
in the hopes he'll go away.

33:10.540 --> 33:12.860
Have you ever seen the Earth curving?

33:12.860 --> 33:13.660
No.

33:13.660 --> 33:14.780
Me neither.

33:14.780 --> 33:15.660
You know why?

33:15.660 --> 33:18.780
It's because the Earth is flat and it doesn't spin.

33:18.780 --> 33:19.580
Look into it.

33:19.580 --> 33:22.860
When you get home, go on YouTube and check out the flat Earth.

33:22.860 --> 33:23.820
Uh, not Spielberg.

33:23.820 --> 33:25.500
They say it was, uh, Stanley Kubrick.

33:25.500 --> 33:26.220
Okay.

33:26.220 --> 33:26.700
Kubrick.

33:26.700 --> 33:27.900
That was the rumor.

33:27.900 --> 33:30.300
Whoever, whatever it was is Hollywood trickery.

33:30.300 --> 33:35.420
It's so awkward and he's so sure he's owning people and looks smart.

33:35.420 --> 33:38.620
I'm getting sympathy anxiety for the people he's talking to.

33:38.620 --> 33:40.700
It's just, ah, no.

33:40.700 --> 33:41.500
Stop it.

33:41.500 --> 33:43.180
Well, let me ask you this.

33:43.180 --> 33:44.140
Oh, God.

33:44.140 --> 33:45.900
Do you think that looks more like a Lunar Module

33:45.900 --> 33:48.780
or a Homeless Tweaker shelter if you had to pick one?

33:48.780 --> 33:50.140
Is this really happening?

33:50.140 --> 33:51.580
Just if you had to pick one.

33:51.580 --> 33:56.300
Why did he choose such an unwieldy quote to use on the shirt he designed

33:56.300 --> 33:59.180
and then was going to say a lot in a video?

33:59.180 --> 34:01.500
Why is this his opening to his compass?

34:02.460 --> 34:04.300
It's such a terrible shirt.

34:04.300 --> 34:04.860
Why did he?

34:04.860 --> 34:06.060
So I'm wearing a shirt now.

34:06.060 --> 34:10.940
I recreated it to try and understand what's, what the deal is, what it's going on here.

34:10.940 --> 34:12.940
And frankly, I still don't get it.

34:12.940 --> 34:14.300
It was a complete waste of time.

34:15.260 --> 34:18.220
Um, if I ever open a merch store and you see this shirt on it,

34:18.220 --> 34:21.260
uh, it's the one shirt that I made of these.

34:21.260 --> 34:24.620
So, um, I'll sign it or something if you want.

34:24.620 --> 34:26.300
Please do not wear it in public, though.

34:26.300 --> 34:28.380
No one will want to be your friend.

34:28.380 --> 34:31.100
So, yeah, we probably should at least acknowledge it.

34:31.100 --> 34:33.180
Some of these people believe there's a global,

34:33.820 --> 34:38.940
flattled conspiracy to control the world and eat everyone's minds.

34:38.940 --> 34:42.460
Some of them are misogynists and some of them are really racist.

34:42.460 --> 34:45.660
It could be one of these, uh, bloodlines in this sort of elite.

34:45.660 --> 34:47.900
Oh, it's the Rothschilds, is it?

34:47.900 --> 34:48.400
Oh, okay.

34:49.180 --> 34:49.980
That's normal.

34:49.980 --> 34:53.020
And some of them are vegan neo-Nazi rappers.

34:53.660 --> 34:57.420
But I'm sure every movement has its share of problematic people

34:57.420 --> 35:00.140
who embarrass everyone else and who they wish would go away.

35:00.940 --> 35:03.340
I can't think of any left-wing YouTubers who are like that.

35:03.340 --> 35:04.380
Oh, it's me, isn't it?

35:04.380 --> 35:08.620
Dispensing with the really sort of weird elements of the movement,

35:09.420 --> 35:10.780
the question still remains,

35:10.780 --> 35:13.660
why do people think the Earth is flat if the evidence is so bad?

35:15.820 --> 35:19.180
Frankly, I'm not very good at figuring out why other people do things.

35:19.180 --> 35:20.940
I just do what Sobek commands me,

35:20.940 --> 35:23.500
and in return, he ensures that my harvest is bountiful

35:23.500 --> 35:25.100
and my sperm is never-ending.

35:25.100 --> 35:26.780
So we're gonna have to turn to an outside source

35:26.780 --> 35:29.580
to do all of this deep-thinking stuff.

35:29.580 --> 35:31.740
Let's find out what popular talkie-thinkie man

35:31.740 --> 35:34.380
Philo-Sophie Tube has to say for himself, shall we?

35:45.100 --> 35:45.820
Hey, Ollie.

35:45.820 --> 35:46.780
I was just wondering,

35:46.780 --> 35:49.580
what do philosophers think of people who think the Earth is fl-

35:56.300 --> 35:58.460
I'll just reference the video you made a year ago.

35:58.460 --> 35:59.580
It's fine.

36:08.620 --> 36:13.580
Mr. Mark Sargent.

36:17.180 --> 36:21.500
For the rest of the scientific community,

36:21.500 --> 36:23.100
I come bearing a message.

36:24.380 --> 36:25.580
I like science.

36:25.580 --> 36:26.620
I always have.

36:26.620 --> 36:28.620
I flew here on the back of science.

36:28.620 --> 36:29.820
Oh, you flew here, did you?

36:29.820 --> 36:31.900
I wonder what model of the Earth the pilot you-

36:31.900 --> 36:32.400
No.

36:33.020 --> 36:34.140
Don't be mean.

36:34.140 --> 36:34.780
Don't-

36:34.780 --> 36:35.580
Sorry.

36:35.580 --> 36:37.660
I promised myself I wouldn't be rude to these people.

36:39.180 --> 36:39.580
Stop it.

36:39.580 --> 36:39.980
Carry on.

36:39.980 --> 36:40.380
Stop it.

36:40.380 --> 36:43.020
You've taken what should have been simple observations

36:43.020 --> 36:45.100
and twisted them to suit your needs

36:45.100 --> 36:46.300
and make us feel small.

36:47.100 --> 36:49.260
We're not small and we're not an accident.

36:49.980 --> 36:52.380
In fact, we are the new scientists.

36:52.380 --> 36:53.260
No, Mark, don't say that.

36:53.260 --> 36:54.300
I promised I wouldn't-

36:54.300 --> 36:55.180
You can't-

36:55.180 --> 36:55.900
Oh, fuck!

36:55.900 --> 36:58.460
There's a new science in town, baby,

36:58.460 --> 37:01.260
and an inordinate amount of it is based on

37:01.260 --> 37:03.340
what logo the UN uses.

37:06.300 --> 37:09.740
Okay, so I deliberately avoided bringing up Mark Sargent's videos too much

37:09.740 --> 37:10.940
because they're not very good.

37:10.940 --> 37:12.700
I don't want to make Flat Earthers just look bad

37:12.700 --> 37:15.340
by pointing out how absolutely ridiculous

37:15.340 --> 37:17.260
the videos that got them into it are,

37:17.260 --> 37:19.180
and I just don't want to be mean to someone

37:19.180 --> 37:21.340
just because they're ignorant and wrong.

37:21.340 --> 37:22.140
But you know what?

37:22.140 --> 37:22.620
Fuck him.

37:22.620 --> 37:24.780
It's 8.50 p.m. on Christmas Eve.

37:24.780 --> 37:28.060
He just said he's the new fucking science.

37:28.060 --> 37:29.820
This is my present to myself.

37:29.820 --> 37:32.860
I'm gonna fucking dunk on Mark Sargent for being obviously wrong.

37:32.860 --> 37:35.180
You know that whole logistics thing I pointed out earlier?

37:35.180 --> 37:37.100
Here's how he brings it up and debunks it.

37:37.100 --> 37:38.620
Now, this is where you come in and say,

37:38.620 --> 37:41.260
well, it's probably an isolated incident

37:41.260 --> 37:43.820
or some strange connection thing.

37:43.820 --> 37:45.180
You know how the airlines are.

37:46.060 --> 37:47.580
Oh, no, my friends.

37:47.580 --> 37:48.080
No.

37:52.140 --> 37:53.660
Mark Sargent's video doesn't even acknowledge

37:53.660 --> 37:55.580
the existence of non-stop flights.

37:55.580 --> 37:57.260
In fact, he says they don't exist.

37:57.260 --> 38:00.860
The first part of the clue is the utter lack of non-stop flights

38:00.860 --> 38:02.700
from anywhere in this hemisphere.

38:02.700 --> 38:06.300
Flying from international cities like Sydney, Rio, Santiago,

38:06.300 --> 38:08.540
or anywhere else close by,

38:08.540 --> 38:11.740
you can't get a single non-stop flight

38:11.820 --> 38:13.740
no matter how much money you pay.

38:13.740 --> 38:15.900
So now it becomes clear why so much of Flat Earth

38:15.900 --> 38:17.660
is pointless fluff or speculation

38:17.660 --> 38:19.340
about all the people who must be in on it.

38:19.340 --> 38:22.140
They have to avoid making quantifiable claims

38:22.140 --> 38:23.980
because otherwise, when you put it in terms

38:23.980 --> 38:25.660
that can be proven or disproven,

38:25.660 --> 38:27.260
there's a chance your actual reasons

38:27.260 --> 38:28.460
for believing what you believe

38:28.460 --> 38:30.860
can be openly demonstrated to be wrong.

38:30.860 --> 38:32.140
The Earth can't be a globe

38:32.140 --> 38:33.580
because there's no non-stop flights

38:33.580 --> 38:35.340
across countries in the Southern Hemisphere.

38:35.340 --> 38:36.700
Oh, wait, someone Googled it

38:36.700 --> 38:38.060
and it turns out there are?

38:38.060 --> 38:39.420
Fucking oops!

38:39.420 --> 38:41.420
I meant to say a bunch of weird waffle

38:41.420 --> 38:43.580
about how we don't really know what gravity is,

38:43.580 --> 38:45.900
so let's ramble about that instead.

38:45.900 --> 38:46.940
What is gravity?

38:46.940 --> 38:49.340
My worldview feels so much more safe

38:49.340 --> 38:52.140
when I'm talking absolute fucking nonsense.

38:52.140 --> 38:53.980
Has everyone seen The Truman Show?

38:53.980 --> 38:55.180
Oh, and while we're at it, Mark,

38:55.180 --> 38:58.060
it's not cute that you fucking hold your microphone

38:58.060 --> 38:59.980
on all of your podcasts like this.

38:59.980 --> 39:01.340
It makes for terrible audio.

39:01.340 --> 39:03.260
We can hear you fumbling with it constantly.

39:03.260 --> 39:04.620
Just put it on a stand.

39:04.620 --> 39:06.860
The person you've been streaming with

39:06.860 --> 39:09.020
for, like, years has a stand.

39:09.020 --> 39:10.700
Why have you not copied her thing?

39:10.700 --> 39:11.900
Just use a stand.

39:11.900 --> 39:14.780
Also, it's very clear you were wearing a clip-on mic

39:14.780 --> 39:16.460
when you came out to do this speech,

39:16.460 --> 39:17.740
and I guess you fucked it up

39:17.740 --> 39:19.180
because the audio didn't work.

39:19.180 --> 39:21.980
Okay, just pick up.

39:23.420 --> 39:24.860
I'll do this just in case.

39:24.860 --> 39:26.860
So you decided you had to use the onboard mics

39:26.860 --> 39:28.540
and then you weren't even using them right,

39:28.540 --> 39:29.980
so a guy had to come and correct you.

39:31.020 --> 39:32.300
Oh, we're gonna do both.

39:32.300 --> 39:32.860
Sorry about that.

39:33.500 --> 39:35.660
Why do you have so many problems with microphones?

39:35.660 --> 39:37.980
If you just Googled how to do sound,

39:37.980 --> 39:41.100
your videos would have been, like, 30% more bearable.

39:41.100 --> 39:44.060
Whose video was that with the moon and the clouds?

39:44.060 --> 39:45.900
Yeah, and I don't even think that was the moon.

39:45.900 --> 39:47.100
That looked like the sun.

39:47.100 --> 39:47.600
Was it?

39:48.620 --> 39:49.120
Just...

39:49.580 --> 39:51.660
Why are you so bad at everything, Mark?

39:51.660 --> 39:52.140
You don't...

39:52.140 --> 39:53.820
You're not even a good flat-earther.

39:53.820 --> 39:55.100
I have to talk around you

39:55.100 --> 39:58.700
or it makes me look like I'm trying to make you people look stupid.

39:58.700 --> 40:01.260
And do you think you're the fucking scientist?

40:01.260 --> 40:02.780
Fucking Jesus Christ!

40:04.220 --> 40:05.340
I think what really gets me...

40:08.140 --> 40:10.140
...

40:10.140 --> 40:11.020
In his video,

40:11.020 --> 40:13.420
Flat Earth or Why Do People Reject Science,

40:13.420 --> 40:15.260
philosopher Oliver Thorne says that

40:15.260 --> 40:17.820
flat-earthers don't actually reject science.

40:17.820 --> 40:19.420
See, he's being very clever with his title.

40:19.420 --> 40:20.140
It's a clever boy.

40:20.140 --> 40:21.020
Check his videos out.

40:21.020 --> 40:24.620
But they're actually embracing an alternative viewpoint on science

40:24.620 --> 40:27.100
which he compares to direct realism.

40:27.100 --> 40:28.060
He's right.

40:28.060 --> 40:28.860
These people are...

40:29.900 --> 40:31.660
...attempting a form of science.

40:32.460 --> 40:35.900
And I think that's what really gets to me about them.

40:36.860 --> 40:39.740
Not simply that they're pretending they're scientists

40:39.740 --> 40:41.900
who've secretly found the truth.

40:41.900 --> 40:44.220
Those people are a fucking dime a dozen.

40:44.220 --> 40:46.140
Saying that science is good and you know it

40:46.140 --> 40:48.780
and you're the genius and everyone else is wrong

40:48.780 --> 40:50.940
is basically what being a YouTuber is.

40:50.940 --> 40:55.020
People like Mark are right to want to question authorities on issues.

40:55.020 --> 40:57.420
They're right to want to question everything they know about reality

40:57.420 --> 40:58.780
and the society they live in.

40:59.420 --> 41:02.700
And that's because at the centre of flat Earth,

41:02.700 --> 41:03.500
not the North Pole,

41:03.500 --> 41:05.260
the actual centre of the ideology,

41:05.260 --> 41:09.900
its core is a tiny shining fragment of a systemic critique.

41:10.620 --> 41:13.900
It's the beginnings of trying to understand

41:14.940 --> 41:18.620
what's wrong with our society and what to do about it.

41:18.620 --> 41:21.340
You know, flat Earthers and people like them

41:21.340 --> 41:23.340
who embrace alternative solutions,

41:23.340 --> 41:25.340
like eating raw meat.

41:25.340 --> 41:29.180
In fact, Jake the Asshole, flat Earth boy,

41:29.180 --> 41:30.460
yell at people, man,

41:31.020 --> 41:32.540
eats raw meat a bunch.

41:32.540 --> 41:33.180
It's disgusting.

41:33.180 --> 41:35.180
I almost threw up watching one of his videos.

41:35.500 --> 41:39.100
People seek these solutions because they perceive,

41:39.100 --> 41:40.380
on some level, a problem.

41:41.260 --> 41:43.500
And they're right.

41:44.060 --> 41:46.860
Something is wrong with the world right now.

41:46.860 --> 41:49.100
The world is figuratively on fire.

41:49.100 --> 41:50.940
World leaders are asleep at the wheel.

41:50.940 --> 41:54.300
There's nothing in place to prevent another massive financial crash

41:54.300 --> 41:57.980
which will destroy thousands, if not millions, of livelihoods.

41:57.980 --> 42:00.220
And ecologically speaking, on top of being, you know,

42:00.220 --> 42:02.780
figuratively on fire, the Earth is literally on fire.

42:02.780 --> 42:04.460
Wildfires are getting worse.

42:04.460 --> 42:06.540
Temperatures are shifting all over the place.

42:06.540 --> 42:08.540
Ice is melting at an astounding rate.

42:09.900 --> 42:14.300
Even on a globe Earth, the edge is coming fast.

42:14.300 --> 42:18.540
So I can't blame anyone for feeling alienated and lonely

42:18.540 --> 42:21.740
about living in, you know, late capitalist society.

42:21.740 --> 42:25.100
You know, at least under feudalism, we had job security.

42:25.100 --> 42:27.820
So, of course, people are going to try and find something

42:27.820 --> 42:31.580
that helps them cope or seems like a solution.

42:31.580 --> 42:34.220
I mean, that's why you get cults.

42:34.220 --> 42:35.820
That's why you get Scientology.

42:35.820 --> 42:38.620
That's why you get Jordan Peterson supporters.

42:38.620 --> 42:42.620
You know, something is wrong, and we can all tell.

42:43.260 --> 42:47.420
And some people have arrived at a solution that doesn't really work

42:47.420 --> 42:50.220
or, at the very least, makes them feel a little bit better.

42:50.220 --> 42:53.980
Some people feel really good, like they're really owning the Marxists

42:53.980 --> 42:56.460
by not eating their vegetables until they get scurvy.

42:57.180 --> 43:00.380
And then that's where the problems begin, isn't it?

43:00.380 --> 43:04.220
Because believing these things isn't a solution,

43:05.260 --> 43:08.780
and it's not really accurate about what the problems are.

43:09.740 --> 43:11.020
The problem isn't NASA.

43:11.020 --> 43:12.540
The problem isn't the Earth being flat.

43:13.100 --> 43:14.540
The problem is something else.

43:14.540 --> 43:17.100
If you're a flat earther and you made it all the way to the end of this video,

43:17.660 --> 43:18.460
wow!

43:18.460 --> 43:19.820
This video was way too long,

43:20.380 --> 43:24.140
but I watched fucking dozens of hours of your documentaries,

43:24.140 --> 43:26.780
so I guess you owe me.

43:27.500 --> 43:30.540
But if I can give a little word of advice,

43:31.980 --> 43:35.500
you're right to feel that something is wrong.

43:36.700 --> 43:37.820
Because something is wrong.

43:38.940 --> 43:41.980
Just maybe keep looking for the source of what that thing is,

43:41.980 --> 43:44.220
because the Earth is not flat.

43:46.380 --> 43:48.860
The Earth is an oblate spheroid.

43:49.420 --> 43:52.300
I heard one guy say oblate once, and that was it.

43:52.300 --> 43:53.820
I just now say it every time.

43:53.820 --> 43:55.260
Just keep looking.

43:55.260 --> 43:56.460
Keep trying to figure out a solution.

43:57.020 --> 44:02.380
And maybe next Christmas, Mark Sargent will be Mark's Sargent.

44:03.580 --> 44:04.300
It's a good one.

44:05.180 --> 44:06.780
Oh, God, my hair looks awful.

44:06.780 --> 44:08.860
And see you all next year.

44:08.860 --> 44:10.460
I'm gonna do more videos next year, I promise.

44:10.460 --> 44:12.380
And I'm gonna do that charity stream soon.

44:12.380 --> 44:16.220
I'm gonna play Donkey Kong 64 all the way through until I fucking die.

44:17.260 --> 44:18.380
I'll raise money for a charity.

44:18.380 --> 44:20.780
I forgot which one it is, and I don't want to do another take

44:20.780 --> 44:22.220
because it's bloody freezing in here.

44:22.220 --> 44:23.340
I put this on for a reason.

44:26.780 --> 44:29.660
This used to light up, but it doesn't.

44:57.580 --> 45:00.780
Excuse me.

45:00.780 --> 45:02.700
Can moonlight make things cold?

45:04.940 --> 45:08.220
I feel like I'm actually being rude to a person by doing this.

45:08.220 --> 45:09.660
I'm really sorry.
