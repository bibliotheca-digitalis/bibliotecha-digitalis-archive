3920	5720	Ugh!
5720	8340	Arrrrgh!
8340	10560	Hello! It's me!
10560	12720	That guy who does those videos!
12720	14060	Very occasionally.
14060	15560	Oh, man!
15560	17940	Jeez. I love balls.
17940	21520	Did you know that, as of maybe 200 years ago,
21520	25020	everyone thought that the Earth was flat?
25020	26740	Ah, that's actually a joke!
26740	29620	I tricked you! It's a pop-cultural myth!
29620	32780	People have thought that the Earth was a sphere,
32780	35280	more specifically, an oblate spheroid,
35280	37860	for hundreds, if not thousands of years,
37860	39620	if you accept Ptolemy's writing
39620	41840	as evidence of that speculation.
41840	44120	Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!
44120	46720	For, at the very least, hundreds of years now,
46720	48680	it's been pretty much widely accepted
48680	50000	that the Earth is a globe,
50000	52760	which means that the modern Flat Earth movements
52760	57380	that exist aren't contiguous with any past movement.
57440	58780	These people aren't regressives
58780	61620	who want to go back to a certain set of beliefs.
61620	62780	These people are progressives.
62780	65360	They believe in science and reason and evidence.
65360	68620	They want understanding of the Earth to move forwards,
68620	71000	off of the edge of a cliff,
71000	72920	which theoretically exists now.
72920	74660	The Earth might have an edge.
74660	75840	That's exciting!
75840	78340	And today, I wanted to look at some of these people's reasons
78340	80420	for their beliefs, their evidence,
80420	82720	and I wanted to see what we, as independent thinkers,
82720	84220	can make of their findings.
84220	86640	See you in hell, you little lie-ball!
86640	88780	Nyah! Oh! Oh, fuck!
88780	90520	Oh, jeez! Oh, Jesus!
90520	93320	♪♪
93320	98120	Chapter 1, How Flat Earth Came Back from the Edge.
98120	101040	So, I'm not kidding about Flat Earth-erism being recent.
101040	102620	There are numerous Flat Earth societies
102620	104660	that have been around for, like, 200 years,
104660	106760	but usually they're just a couple of people now,
106760	108260	just keeping the lights on,
108260	112180	and even then, they were seen as weirdos by most people.
112180	114180	Then, on Facebook in the early years,
114180	117800	there were people who were, like, opening joke pages,
117800	119800	pretending to be a Flat Earth society,
119800	121060	and it was just people having fun,
121060	123860	making silly, sort of fake memes,
123860	125560	and it is, let's all admit,
125560	128520	very funny to call someone a globehead.
128520	131360	But then, I don't know, society utterly fucking collapsed
131360	132980	when I wasn't looking or something,
132980	134700	because now, in addition to some people
134700	137940	believing that the free market is real and a good idea,
137940	139820	some people believe the much less harmful
139820	142660	and ridiculous fairy tale that the Earth is flat.
142680	145800	As of 2015, Flat Earth membership has grown massively,
145800	148360	and now there's even a full Flat Earth convention
148360	152280	with people flying in from all around the globe
152280	154740	to take part and pool their collective knowledge.
154740	157320	Even some celebrities have voiced support for the movement,
157320	159780	like Logan Paul, who's universally known
159780	161620	for making well-thought-out decisions,
161620	164240	and famous rapper...Bob?
164240	166080	Little Robbie currently has a GoFundMe
166080	169300	asking for a million dollars to send up drones
169300	171380	and weather balloons and satellites
171440	172900	and rockets and stuff,
172900	176440	and I kind of admire his, uh, commitment to science.
176440	179320	He's really willing to put other people's money
179320	182200	where his mouth is and find out the shape of the Earth.
182200	184540	But what caused Bob to think the Earth
184540	186780	was flat in the first place?
186780	188960	Let's find out and dive into the first documentary
188960	190840	I saw while I was researching Flat Earth,
190840	193300	Odd TV's The True Earth.
193300	196580	Like everyone else, you were born into bondage,
196580	200180	born into a prison for your mind.
200180	202140	Buckle your seatbelt, Dorothy,
202140	204660	because Kansas is going bye-bye.
204660	207540	Take the red pill like in The Matrix.
207540	209620	The Matrix is a good movie.
210980	213100	Oh, God, I've got to make that Night in the Woods video.
213100	215060	Our daily observations of the Earth
215060	218140	are consistent with a flat and stationary surface.
218140	220500	Most, if not all, ancient civilizations
220500	222540	knew that the Earth was flat.
222540	224220	Okay, that's an interesting start.
224220	225220	Um, chapter two.
225220	227580	That's not how knowledge works!
227580	231860	Okay, so philosophers and linguists and discoursists
231860	235820	and those ivory tower Marxists I've heard so much about
235820	240300	argue incessantly on the concepts of knowledge and truth.
240300	243020	They're all wrong, and I'm right, and here's how it works.
243020	246500	People don't simply know things.
246500	249460	People believe something to be true,
249460	253460	or to put it another way, they think they know something.
253460	255980	What Odd TV actually means here
255980	258620	is that most ancient civilizations,
258620	261900	or at least some of them, depending on how far back you go,
261900	265380	thought they knew the Earth was flat.
265380	268340	And he's ascribing knowledge to them
268340	269980	so that they definitely knew this
269980	271900	in order to make it seem more credible
271900	273300	that that thing is true.
273300	274820	The people of today would say
274820	278180	that ancient cultures were ignorant and unaware,
278180	279820	yet they accomplished great feats
279820	282700	that we still can't accomplish to this day.
282700	285220	The ancient Egyptians built the pyramids,
285300	288700	so how could they be wrong about unrelated issues?
288700	291180	The ancient Egyptians knew
291180	295180	that pharaohs were living incarnations of a humanoid god
295180	297900	with a crocodile's head named Sobek,
297900	300100	who was the lord of semen
300100	303100	and helped the sun move through the sky,
303100	305580	presumably by blasting it with sperm.
305580	309580	The ancient Egyptians knew this thousands of years ago,
309580	312260	and yet every year we deny the sperm lord
312260	314380	his offerings of mummified crocodiles.
314380	317180	And once more, we threaten to awaken his anger.
317180	319660	Those of you who think this technical difficulty was planned...
319660	321020	I forgot about this part.
321020	323940	This video in particular is great because, okay, spoilers.
323940	326860	There aren't that many pro-flat Earth arguments.
326860	327860	There's a couple of people
327860	329460	who keep trying to come up with new ones,
329460	331980	but really there's, like, five main ones,
331980	334900	and then everyone keeps kind of ripping them off
334900	338020	and rewording them and coming up with slightly different ways
338020	340580	of saying the same thing over and over again.
340580	344220	And this documentary goes one step further
344220	346140	and rather than remaking those arguments
346140	348300	for an 18th millionth time,
348300	350220	it actually just borrows clips
350220	351740	from videos people have already made.
351740	352580	It's great.
352580	354060	This is live on the air, okay?
354060	356540	I'm gonna zoom in on the Earth in Photoshop.
356540	359660	Image, adjust, levels,
359660	361420	and I'm gonna bring the levels up.
362540	363940	Uh-oh.
363940	365180	What is that?
365180	369180	Why is there a square box around the Earth
369180	371020	allegedly taken from the scientists
371020	372540	on the moon in Apollo 17?
373420	376020	And people wonder why I don't trust NASA.
376020	378140	That's why I don't trust NASA.
378140	378980	I mean, they're always out there saying-
378980	380700	Uh, uh, wait a second, mate.
380700	381580	Wait, wait, wait.
384260	385100	Hold on a second.
385100	385940	Let me get my mouse.
385940	387900	Let's quickly create a new image.
387900	390500	Make it 3,000 by 3,000 pixels, 72 pixels per inch.
390500	392020	Let's do a deep fake.
392020	396100	Let's fake our own pale blue dot.
396100	397820	That's not a, that's not a dot.
397820	399980	You gotta hold shift to make it perfectly circular.
399980	401900	Don't make that mistake next time, globalists.
401900	404060	Oh, look, that's some shine.
404060	405340	That's an ocean.
405340	406980	Oh, that's the land we all live on.
406980	410460	That's exactly what Ptolemy's map looks like.
410460	413220	So if we were to do this adjustment right here
413220	415660	with the image levels, turn it all the way up,
415660	418180	you'll see that there's no, nothing goes up.
418180	419100	Nothing goes up at all.
419100	419940	Wow, look.
419940	421420	If only they'd properly cut the Earth out,
421420	422860	NASA could have gotten away with it
422860	425260	if it weren't for those meddling Photoshop users.
425260	426860	Let's save it as a JPEG,
426860	428420	and let's make it medium compression.
428420	430300	So this is like an average amount of JPEG compression
430300	431340	for an image on the internet.
431340	434740	Now let's, let's quickly open up our untitled 1.JPEG
434740	436580	in Photoshop ourselves.
436580	438980	Now let's turn the levels up.
440100	441940	Oh my God.
441940	443180	Oh my God.
443180	447060	It's a fake Earth picture that wasn't cut out properly.
447060	448940	It's JPEG compression.
448940	450300	You fucking idiot.
450300	453020	Okay, I'm already incredibly bored of this documentary.
453020	456460	It's the same music clip playing over and over
456460	458940	for 30 minutes, and it's jarring having all these
458940	460660	other voices just kind of come in.
461620	464100	It's, it's just not, it's just not very well made.
464100	467460	And I've decided to just move on to other people's videos,
467460	469500	which usually make the same points anyway.
469500	470780	And we might even run into one of the videos
470780	471620	that they stole.
471620	474180	But one thing I do want to bring up is a meme
474180	475980	that I saw posted here first,
475980	477700	and I've seen it around since then,
477700	478980	towards the end of the documentary.
478980	480060	And when I was watching the first time,
480060	482500	I had to pause and just kind of laugh at it.
482500	483900	It's, it's this picture here.
483900	485820	It's so fascinating.
485820	488060	It's so direct.
488060	490700	And it doesn't get what it's really saying.
490700	493460	Like, just maybe don't brag too triumphantly
493460	496460	about how you don't read books.
496460	498620	Chapter three, he who smelts it.
498620	500260	Anyway, one of the main folks credited
500260	503380	with getting the ball rolling in Flat Earth,
503380	505500	just a little joke from me to you,
505500	508500	is Mark Sargent and his video series
508500	510540	entitled Flat Earth Clues.
510540	513980	I've now heard about two or three dozen people
513980	515980	say that this series is what really got them
515980	517820	into the whole thing and taking it seriously.
517820	520420	Are we inside a Truman Show-enclosed world
520420	522100	thousands of miles wide?
522100	523980	It's just like in the Truman Show.
523980	525140	Oh, God.
525140	526580	No, no, be nice, be nice.
526580	528900	Growing up on South Whidbey Island, Washington,
528900	530460	Mark Sargent started his career
530460	532180	playing computer games professionally
532180	533460	in Boulder, Colorado.
533460	534900	Oh, great, a fellow gamer.
534900	536140	He must be reasonable.
536140	538660	Early in 2015, he released a series of YouTube videos
538660	539940	titled Flat Earth Clues,
539940	541260	which delves into the possibility
541260	543140	of our human civilization actually being inside
543140	546540	a Truman Show-like enclosed, you already said
546580	548220	Truman Show earlier in the description.
548220	550900	Like, at least reference a different movie.
550900	553500	In other words, this is the video series
553500	555540	that everyone else is cribbing from,
555540	557620	so we should probably check it out, shouldn't we?
557620	558860	Two hours.
558860	560060	I always wanted to do this joke
560060	561860	and this actually took me two hours.
563100	564580	Well, that was a waste of time.
564580	567340	Okay, I've now watched Mark's entire 14-part
567340	569700	plus extras series about how the Earth is flat,
569700	571740	which took a couple of hours,
571740	574100	and what really jumps out at me
574100	578620	is how shockingly boring and unconvincing it is.
578620	580820	Like, you think this is the original one,
580820	582260	this is the one that got him,
582260	586020	and it's a slideshow with, like, a guy kind of rambling,
586020	588420	and he talks, like, he's really convinced,
588420	589820	he knows the truth,
589820	592740	and I assume people believe this
592740	595460	because they're like, well, he sounds really into it,
595460	597940	he must be onto something,
597940	602140	but it's, like, really, really unconvincing.
602140	603780	In order to summarize the point
603780	606140	in any one of those videos that they make,
606140	609220	you would have to edit around and cut across in time
609220	612220	so much to kind of formulate the actual point
612220	613700	so much that it would feel deceptive,
613700	616340	like I'm sort of pulling some kind of trick
616340	620780	by trying to get to the point he's making in a simpler way,
620780	622740	and the evidence that he refers to
622740	624700	is so thin on the ground
624700	627460	that it doesn't even meet any burden of proof
627460	630180	for it to be something that I would need to debunk anyway.
630180	632020	Part 7, for example, long haul
632020	633580	is the one that really sticks out to me.
633580	637340	It takes him 10 minutes to effectively say,
637340	638980	I looked up some flights,
638980	640860	and I think they show the Earth is flat.
640860	645380	That's all he had to say, but it takes 10 minutes.
645380	647220	I promised myself when I was researching
647220	648700	something like Flat Earth
648700	651460	that I would try and find the strongest possible versions
651460	653660	of any argument that I responded to or debunked
653660	657380	because with a movement as big and full of all kinds
657380	660300	of sort of amateur people as Flat Earth,
660300	664380	it's very easy to find someone making the point very badly
664380	666260	and go, ha, and then pretend
666260	668220	you've discredited the entire argument,
668220	669900	and I didn't want to do that,
669900	672140	and I just want to acknowledge here that it's really weird
672140	674820	that the guy everyone credits with getting them in on it
674820	677340	is, the videos are bad.
677340	679740	Like, watch them, please, if you can stand it.
679740	682620	It's just not very well put together,
682620	684620	and that's just a bit weird to me
684620	688220	because they're supposed to be the best ones.
688220	690900	Take the long-haul flight one I mentioned already.
690900	692140	Two months after that came out,
692140	694500	someone who's clearly seen that one
694500	697860	has already honed the point that Sargent was trying to make
697860	700700	down into one that's actually a good video,
700700	703260	and that video has, like, six times more views.
703260	704500	We'll get to that video in a second,
704500	707780	but first, if the globe model is wrong,
707780	709740	what's the alternative?
709740	710900	I think it's time we looked at
710900	713940	what a Flat Earth map actually looks like.
713940	717740	Chapter four, Discworld, but not the fun one.
717740	719060	This is a poster I had made
719060	721540	of Gleason's new standard map of the world.
721540	723460	It was made in the late 1800s,
723460	726020	and it shows what purports to be
726020	728700	what the Earth actually looks like when it's flat.
728700	731820	Now, this isn't the exact map that Flat Earthers use.
731820	733780	What they use is a version of this
733780	735460	that's projected the same way.
735460	736300	There are lots of different ways
736300	737740	you can project planet Earth.
737740	740420	The Gleason map and other supposedly slightly more accurate
740420	742780	and realistic Flat Earth maps
742780	744820	aren't actually just made up from something.
744820	746580	They're based on a type of map projection
746580	747820	that already existed,
747820	750700	known as azimuthal equidistant projection,
750700	753380	not named for its creator, Philip Azimuth,
753380	754860	because I just made that guy up,
754860	757020	and that projection method isn't completely useless.
757020	759220	It's not just a silly picture.
759220	760580	It's good for being able to tell
760580	762700	what angle and distance you are from the North Pole.
762700	764420	This is really accurate to where you are
764420	765780	in relation to the North Pole,
765780	768300	especially compared to other projections
768300	770500	where the North Pole is, like, the wrong size
770500	771620	or in the wrong place
771620	774180	because otherwise you wouldn't be able to see it properly
774180	777540	because flat maps are just inherently always a bit wrong.
777540	781460	It also, as you can see, looks pretty nice.
781460	783620	In fact, a stylized version of this projection
783620	786820	is used as the logo for the UN
786820	788980	because they're in on it, obviously.
788980	790300	Most notable things about this map,
790300	793340	the North Pole is now directly in the center of the Earth,
793340	796260	and instead of there being a South Pole anywhere,
796260	798740	it's now encircling the entire Earth
798740	800620	in a giant wall of ice.
800620	801660	Now I know what you're thinking.
801660	803420	Does this map hold any water?
803420	805500	And the answer is, that's what the ice is for.
805500	806900	By the way, does that mean global warming
806900	809460	is now, like, way, way worse?
809460	812820	Because, like, if the ice were melted,
812820	815020	all the water would flow out
815020	820540	and we'd all die of no-water-itis.
820540	822780	I mean, on globe Earth,
822780	829140	we'd all just drown and then boil instead.
829140	830260	Yay!
830300	831620	Another feature of this map
831620	833900	is that what used to be the Southern Hemisphere
833900	838140	is now much further away from itself, as it were.
838140	840300	Australia is now much further away
840300	842860	from Africa or South America.
842860	846500	And also, everything is increasingly distorted
846500	848220	the further out you get.
848220	851780	Australia is now much, much wider than it used to be,
851780	854980	even though people have actually measured Australia,
854980	858020	and it's about as long as it is wide.
858020	860780	But clearly, Sobek got to those guys, too.
860780	862540	How does this affect travel?
862540	865140	Because, obviously, now that all the shapes
865140	867020	and distances are very different,
867020	869580	especially in the Southern Hemisphere,
869580	872740	surely flight plans would be affected by this?
872740	875620	They'd have to account for the non-curvature of the Earth
875620	877940	and everything being in a different place?
877940	881220	Well, luckily, this is something Mark Sargent
881220	884220	and the clever disc boys at the Flat Earth Society
884220	886820	say actually makes more sense on a flat Earth.
887500	890340	Chapter five, how do airlines work?
890340	891540	Here's a video entitled,
891540	893100	The Earth is Flat.
893100	895820	The Planes Help to Prove the Plane.
895820	898140	It's got over 900,000 views.
898140	900260	This is the video that I would say is something
900260	901780	of an improvement on the arguments
901780	904740	that Mark Sargent makes in his video entitled Long Haul.
904740	908180	The arguments are still wrong, but they're made better,
908180	910780	so points for that, plus that pun.
910780	912540	I mean, oh, boy.
912540	914460	He looks up trips from Sydney, Australia,
914460	915900	to Santiago, Chile,
915900	918460	and notes that getting there requires multiple stops
918460	920740	at other airports that are relatively out of the way
920740	922580	and inefficient on the globe model,
922580	923700	but on the flat Earth model,
923700	925540	they form an almost straight line.
925540	928380	You have to actually get up into the Northern Hemisphere
928380	930580	and then come back down,
930580	933140	so that doesn't make any sense.
933140	936620	So I mapped it on the flat Earth map,
936620	937660	and whoa.
937660	938500	Whoa.
938500	939940	This is a huge thing for flat Earthers
939940	941940	because unlike all the stuff they have to just ignore
941940	945340	or prove is a big lie that didn't happen,
945340	948020	this is something which supposedly proves
948020	950020	that the flat Earth model is true.
950020	952740	Mark Sargent says this is the thing you should start with
952740	954860	if you're trying to explain the whole thing to someone.
954860	956780	If you were looking to show someone
956780	960540	how to view the flat Earth from a practical point of view,
960540	962340	this is the example I would use.
962340	963940	Mark, you could have started with that
963940	966060	and not waited until part seven,
966060	966980	like an hour in.
966980	968740	Please hire an editor.
968740	970260	There are so many counterpoints to this.
970260	972380	I don't know where to start, really.
972380	976100	Um, I suppose we should start with London City Airport.
976100	978300	It makes far more business sense for airlines
978300	980220	to offer shorter connecting flights
980220	982340	that can be used as part of a wider trip
982340	984340	than one direct flight to the one place
984340	986300	that one group of people might happen to go.
986300	987700	You know airports aren't magic.
987700	989300	Like, it takes a certain amount of time
989300	991660	for a plane to take off and land on a runway,
991660	993380	and there's only so many runways.
993380	994660	You think London City Airport,
994660	997980	with its minuscule, piddly little piss runway,
997980	1000100	has the time to furnish flights to Chile?
1000220	1002220	What are you talking about, mate?
1002220	1004220	That said, that doesn't mean that long-distance flights
1004220	1005300	like this never happen.
1005300	1008580	There's actually a direct flight from Sydney to Santiago,
1008580	1010260	Qantas QF27.
1010260	1012900	It goes nonstop and takes way less time
1012900	1014300	than the non-direct routes.
1014300	1017460	On a flat Earth map, QF27 would take far longer
1017460	1019420	than the supposedly direct paths,
1019420	1022060	and also the distance would be so much longer
1022060	1025100	that the plane would run out of fuel and crash in the ocean.
1025100	1027980	How does this guy deal with the existence of this flight,
1027980	1029860	or a flight with just one connection
1029860	1032300	that doesn't go the direct route on a flat Earth map?
1032300	1035020	Well, they actually do pop up on his flight tracker.
1035020	1038100	That's the first clue I found to these flights existing.
1038100	1042020	But I don't think this flight ever takes off.
1042020	1046820	Uh, it's available only Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday also.
1046820	1049820	Kind of pinch you out and make you do something different.
1049820	1053180	He actually says that they're not real.
1053180	1058540	I don't think either one of these two flights are real.
1058540	1063500	Um, they're just kind of there to, um,
1063500	1066060	keep guys like me from figuring this shit out.
1066060	1068900	He sees through Qantas's dastardly trick
1068900	1071660	to sell tickets to a plane that's real.
1071660	1075020	You can watch footage of the flight.
1075020	1077500	Look, why would Qantas do all of this
1077500	1079620	just to make people think that the Earth was a globe?
1079620	1080940	What do they get from that?
1080940	1084540	Like, what's the... I don't understand.
1084540	1086780	The guy tries to do Johannesburg to Perth, too.
1086820	1090980	And once again, we only have one non-stop.
1090980	1092940	Almost as if there's reasons
1092940	1094860	why you wouldn't have that many flights
1094860	1098180	going that one direct flight.
1098180	1098900	Almost.
1098900	1100540	Uh, these two in black,
1100540	1104060	this is the non-stop that they have to Perth.
1104060	1105580	But the reason I put these in black
1105580	1108660	is because I don't think they exist either.
1108660	1110220	Oh, no, of course not.
1110220	1114100	I mean, I've actually met someone who's been on that flight.
1114100	1116500	But whatever, maybe they're in on it, too.
1116540	1117700	Maybe I'm in on it, too.
1117700	1118820	Hail Sobek.
1118820	1121620	We need to keep everyone thinking the Earth is a globe.
1121620	1123540	That way we can...
1123540	1125140	Um, hang on one second.
1125420	1128900	Yeah, why are we doing this again?
1128900	1130980	Uh, I thought it would be funny.
1130980	1133740	When he maps those supposed more direct trips
1133740	1135140	he found onto the Flat Earth,
1135140	1138620	and by maps, I mean draws shit squiggly lines
1138620	1140980	that in no way match up with the flight plans,
1140980	1143780	one of them doesn't make sense on the Flat Earth either.
1143780	1145620	It goes all the way out of the way to Sydney
1145620	1147580	before it doubles back and heads to Perth.
1147580	1149540	Uh, these are all the flights to Sydney.
1149540	1154780	So it still looks like a pretty long shot to Sydney.
1154820	1156620	Um, but who knows?
1156620	1159220	Maybe this map isn't even correct.
1159220	1161220	Who knows? I don't know.
1161220	1162620	Mm-hmm.
1162620	1163860	Mm-hmm.
1163860	1165260	Maybe.
1165260	1171380	Maybe this map of the Flat Earth isn't correct.
1171380	1174380	Maybe it's not.
1174380	1175340	Maybe.
1175340	1178620	Chapter six, where's the curve?
1178620	1179380	Oh, there it is.
1179380	1181060	Another thing Flat Earthers dispute
1181060	1182660	is the curvature of the Earth.
1182660	1184700	I mean, if it's flat, it can't be curved
1184700	1187020	can it? Well, I guess it could be slightly convex,
1187020	1189020	but they don't bring that up for some reason.
1189020	1191460	The main way they do this consists of filming horizons
1191460	1193580	or finding footage of horizons and saying,
1193580	1195260	well, I don't see a curve,
1195260	1198340	which, uh, you can't see the curvature
1198340	1199460	that close to the ground.
1199460	1201340	Perspective doesn't work that way,
1201340	1203460	and then they go on to assert that all footage
1203460	1206180	that does show a curvature from high up is faked,
1206180	1208700	either on purpose by, like, movie studios
1208700	1211220	working for NASA or accidentally through flaws
1211220	1212340	in camera equipment.
1212380	1214340	Some types of wide-angle camera lenses
1214340	1215620	distort perspective,
1215620	1218380	and almost all small action cameras like GoPros
1218380	1221500	have very wide-angle lenses to film as much as possible.
1221500	1223620	The assertion Flatties then make is,
1223620	1225540	well, the appearance of a curvature
1225540	1228340	is therefore the result of looking at the flat horizon
1228340	1229540	with these lenses,
1229540	1231300	and if you correct the footage,
1231300	1233540	the Earth is clearly actually flat,
1233540	1236180	like in this video by the channel called Flat Earth,
1236180	1237620	although apparently its original name
1237620	1239940	was the Mr. King Tuts.
1239940	1241220	Someone rebranded.
1241220	1242860	Where's the curvature of the Earth?
1242860	1245020	None of you can debunk this video.
1245020	1247100	Anyone with half a brain can see how they use
1247100	1250820	deceptive wide-angle fisheye lenses to deceive you.
1250820	1253180	You can't use the word deceive twice in a sentence.
1253180	1254140	That just doesn't scan.
1254140	1255860	Oh, and in keeping with Flat Earthers
1255860	1257140	just copying each other all the time,
1257140	1259620	this video is literally just taken from another channel.
1259620	1262460	Now, in my opinion, this is the actual closest
1262460	1264140	that Flat Earthers have ever got
1264140	1266780	to actually being right about, uh, anything.
1266780	1268780	Here's a quick test I did with my old GoPro.
1268780	1270780	The GoPro's wide lens means it can see
1270780	1271660	a lot at once.
1271660	1273500	In fact, it even saw the trash I was sure
1273500	1275500	would be out of the shot and didn't bother picking up.
1275500	1277860	However, this perspective is distorted.
1277860	1279420	I can tell you right now my floor is flat
1279420	1281020	and doesn't curve downwards here.
1281020	1282500	As I move the GoPro closer
1282500	1285140	to this totally normal-shaped sex museum postcard,
1285140	1287980	we can see the distortion become even more exaggerated.
1287980	1289900	The beautiful pride flag is ruined.
1289900	1291820	It looks like Graham Linehan has touched it.
1291820	1293260	This is me holding a measuring tape
1293260	1294580	just to give another reference.
1294580	1297060	The curvature of the Earth is definitely susceptible
1297060	1299460	to being exaggerated by wide-angle lenses,
1299460	1300900	but like with JPEG artifacts,
1300900	1302580	you can't just move a slider and say,
1302580	1303700	ah, it proves I'm right.
1303700	1305100	It's not.
1305100	1308460	Look, I'm gonna use my video editing magical skills again
1308460	1309460	to show you something.
1309460	1312820	There isn't, like, a magic fix fisheye lens button
1312820	1314020	in a video editor.
1314020	1315900	Whenever I've had to correct fisheye lens footage
1315900	1318300	for a video, I've had to do it by using an effect
1318300	1319460	that corrects distortion
1319460	1321500	and then dialing in the angles manually,
1321500	1323700	and this stuff is really hard to do by eye.
1323700	1324980	The best technique for doing this
1324980	1327460	is to find something you know is supposed to be flat
1327460	1329860	and then correct until it looks flat.
1329860	1332300	See, that tape turned out to be there for a reason.
1332300	1333300	A clever trick.
1333300	1336300	Now, I'm gonna give you three guesses
1336300	1339300	what part of the footage
1339300	1341420	Flat Earthers use
1341420	1343620	when they are trying to correct footage
1343620	1346020	to prove that the Earth is flat.
1347660	1348780	Did you get it?
1348780	1351940	It's hard to see, but the correction is clearly too much
1351940	1353220	if you know what to look for.
1353220	1354860	On the ground, certain things curve
1354860	1356900	in weird directions just slightly,
1356940	1358900	and at certain angles during the video,
1358900	1361940	the Earth starts to look slightly concave.
1361940	1363900	Our daily observations of the Earth
1363900	1366900	are consistent with a flat and stationary surface.
1366900	1370100	I just want to acknowledge how fucking funny it was
1370100	1372780	when I was watching this documentary for the first time
1372780	1374260	and it fades from a thing saying,
1374260	1377220	our world is flat and it's a wide-angle shot
1377220	1378900	that's not been corrected properly,
1378900	1380380	so it looks like it's curved.
1380380	1382860	It's fucking, it looks like the planet is concave.
1382860	1384780	How do you fuck it up this bad?
1384780	1386580	From this high up, the Earth's curvature
1386580	1388660	would, in fact, be visible,
1388660	1390860	but probably very slight.
1390860	1393020	You'd have to use a ruler to make sure.
1393020	1395380	But exactly how curved it would have been
1395380	1397300	is hard to tell because of the nature
1397300	1399700	of the footage filmed with these lenses.
1399700	1404140	You know, the reality is the Earth is flat.
1404140	1405860	You can't actually see the curvature of the Earth
1405860	1407340	from the window of a passenger plane.
1407340	1408900	They don't go high enough to show
1408900	1411380	more than, like, a degree or two, basically.
1411380	1413740	You can see the curvature of the horizon,
1413740	1415100	but only from high up,
1415100	1417500	and I mean really high up.
1417500	1420700	Not airline high, not even Mary Jane high.
1420700	1422540	I'm talking U-2 high.
1422540	1425980	Come on in here, Bono, The Edge,
1425980	1429020	Adam...Smane?
1429020	1430460	Not that U-2, silly.
1430460	1431940	Ha, we have fun.
1431940	1433900	I mean, of course, the Lockheed U-2,
1433900	1436860	a high-altitude spy plane used by the U.S. government.
1436860	1438580	You might remember the U-2-4.
1438580	1440660	Its operating height of 70,000 feet,
1440660	1442740	almost three times the height of a commercial aircraft,
1442740	1444580	violating international law numerous times,
1444580	1446260	getting caught violating international law
1446260	1447380	numerous times when it turned out
1447380	1448420	it wasn't very good at spying,
1448420	1450580	getting shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960,
1450580	1453300	getting shot down in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis
1453300	1455100	and contributing to the Cold War nearly escalating
1455100	1456220	into full-scale nuclear war.
1456220	1457940	Luckily, the U.S. government gave upon
1457940	1459820	illegally spying on other nations
1459820	1462860	with a shit plane they can see in 1917.
1462860	1464220	Sorry, 1918.
1464220	1465340	Wait, hang on.
1465340	1466660	They're still using it!
1466660	1469660	Here's James May, the least shit guy from Top Gear,
1469660	1470900	taking a ride in one.
1470900	1473340	You can see that at conventional airplane heights,
1473340	1474820	the horizon is fairly flat.
1474820	1476700	Hopefully, this early shot of the horizon
1476700	1478500	looking really flat establishes
1478500	1480660	that the lenses aren't distorting anything here.
1480660	1482460	As he reaches the maximum height,
1482460	1484660	the atmosphere stops being breathable
1484660	1487020	and the sky starts to turn black.
1487020	1488620	At the higher altitudes,
1488620	1492020	we can finally see both the staggering beauty
1492020	1494140	of our little blue world,
1494140	1498180	but also a slight yet pronounced curve on the horizon.
1498180	1501420	So I think it's fair to say that, in conclusion,
1501420	1503980	ha-ha, the Earth's curved slightly.
1503980	1505100	I win.
1505100	1506460	This has just been a brief rundown
1506460	1508060	of the flat Earth points that I feel
1508060	1510300	are at least more credible than the rest.
1510300	1514740	They get increasingly weird and tangential from here on out.
1514740	1517580	For example, almost all flat Earthers
1517580	1519020	say that the moon landing was faked
1519020	1520900	because if we actually went to the moon
1520900	1522020	and took pictures of the Earth
1522020	1523580	and it showed that the Earth was a globe
1523580	1524980	because it's in different positions
1524980	1527020	and different in different pictures,
1527020	1528060	you can't have done that.
1528940	1530420	So the moon landing has to all be faked
1530420	1532980	with the extra caveat that goes on top
1532980	1534820	of the regular moon landing conspiracies,
1534820	1536300	which is that it was all done
1536300	1538740	simply to make people think the Earth was round
1538740	1539860	for some reason.
1539860	1541860	They try and counter the fact that you can't see things
1541860	1543220	on the other side of the horizon
1543220	1545380	by claiming that cameras with long enough zoom lenses,
1545380	1547020	like the Nikon P900,
1547020	1550020	can actually show things that should be behind the horizon,
1550020	1552060	which, uh, no.
1553140	1554980	That's not what's happening.
1554980	1556660	The camera can see further
1556660	1558940	than your disgusting human eyes,
1558940	1560100	which I thought the point was
1560100	1562020	they were the only things you could trust,
1562020	1563660	but no, apparently now we're supposed to trust
1563660	1565420	the globe heads at Nikon.
1565420	1567220	I've pronounced that company's name
1567220	1569620	both of the ways that people pronounce it now,
1569620	1571740	so everyone gets to yell at me.
1571740	1574420	Also, Mark Sargent has actually said this.
1574420	1579420	He thinks that the moon gives off its own cold light,
1579740	1581340	which makes things colder
1581340	1582660	and therefore proves that the moon
1582660	1584500	isn't just a rock floating in space.
1584500	1585900	It's part of the big firmament
1585900	1587540	that some flat earthers think...
1588820	1589660	Just one second.
1593380	1594980	Arranging this to be in the shot properly
1594980	1596380	makes it actually really hard to dial.
1596380	1598660	I want you to appreciate that.
1598660	1599780	Hello.
1599780	1600620	Hi there.
1600620	1602420	Is that popular gaming YouTuber UpIsNotJump,
1602420	1605820	who also incidentally has a master's in chemistry?
1605820	1607580	Yep, this is the third time I'm recording this
1607580	1609060	because I got my lines wrong the first time
1609060	1610340	and then the microphone wasn't on.
1610340	1611180	Oh.
1611380	1615220	Excuse me.
1615220	1617580	Can moonlight make things cold?
1617580	1619980	No, the moon reflects light from the sun
1619980	1621740	and the intrinsic property of waves
1621740	1623660	is basically all waves have energy
1623660	1624900	because they have a frequency.
1624900	1627180	It's just the nature of the universe.
1627180	1628620	Oh, okay, cool, thanks.
1628620	1630340	Great, yeah, that was easy.
1630340	1631180	Bye.
1631180	1632020	Wait, wait, you don't want me to do
1632020	1633220	a funny sketch or something.
1633220	1634820	I can do a joke here.
1634820	1636740	No, the video's looking too long already.
1636740	1639380	I've decided to leave in the tangent about fighter jets,
1639420	1641220	so it's probably not worth it.
1641220	1642060	No, wait, don't go.
1642060	1645500	I can prove mathematically that this is the correct way.
1645500	1648380	This all, I feel, leads to a necessary
1648380	1650220	and important question.
1650220	1652300	If all of the evidence for the flat Earth
1652300	1656340	is so, well, easy to throw out,
1656340	1659300	why do people actually believe it?
1659300	1661500	Chapter seven, why do people believe things
1661500	1663660	that are obviously wrong?
1663660	1664500	Because they're stupid.
1664500	1665460	Bye.
1665460	1669060	Would you like to build a beautiful website easily?
1670140	1671500	Good, so would I.
1671500	1672900	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1672900	1674180	We're not actually gonna do that.
1674180	1675620	That would be unreasonably rude.
1675620	1678420	Let's take these people a bit more seriously than that.
1678420	1680100	Some of them are clearly very knowledgeable.
1680100	1682420	Some of them have, like, big, important degrees
1682420	1683380	in serious fields.
1683380	1685140	They know way much more than I do
1685140	1687460	about all kinds of actually useful things.
1688260	1691140	Some of them take evidence very seriously, clearly,
1691140	1693860	and they believe in the scientific method.
1693860	1694700	Not all of them.
1694900	1697260	Some of them are not actually very knowledgeable
1697260	1699860	about anything and seem to think Donald Trump
1699860	1703340	is a genius and also he's their guy
1703340	1705140	and he secretly knows the Earth is flat
1705140	1706980	and he's gonna expose NASA.
1706980	1710140	I suppose it would be disingenuous not to talk briefly
1710140	1712220	about the really weird people.
1712220	1714380	In fact, the misogyny thing in specific
1714380	1716100	is really surprising.
1716100	1718900	One of Mark Sargent's inner sphere, sorry, circle,
1718900	1721020	Patricia Steer, gets a lot of hate
1721020	1722540	from other factions of flat Earthers
1722540	1725100	for supposedly just being in it to be popular.
1725100	1726860	Or some go even as far as to say
1726860	1729260	that she's actually a secret CIA plant
1729260	1731580	designed to make flat Earth look bad
1731580	1734460	and or trick people with her appearance
1734460	1738860	into making them believe the wrong version of flat Earth.
1739820	1741180	You better wake your ass up.
1741180	1743900	All of them is fucking satanic puppets.
1743900	1746700	Yes, that's why they flashed this one on TV.
1746700	1751020	No doubt about it, it was put there by the CIA on YouTube
1751020	1753980	to distract the masses that wanna learn the truth.
1753980	1755220	Yes, the Earth is flat,
1755220	1757740	but you can never take it from these sodomites.
1757740	1759900	Of course, they go lead you in the wrong direction.
1759900	1760860	Wake your ass up.
1760860	1762780	There go your Patricia Speer right there.
1762780	1766180	It is a plant by the CIA, 100%.
1766180	1767900	Frankly, even the people who like Patricia
1767900	1769380	are super weird about it.
1769380	1771780	I mean, Mark himself made a video
1771780	1774420	just dedicated to how pretty he thinks she is,
1774420	1776620	which it's fine.
1776620	1778780	It's okay to find someone attractive, that's okay.
1778780	1781540	But it's a bit weird to like make a video
1781540	1784740	about how pretty you think she is, right?
1784740	1786460	Still not as bad as the people who think
1786460	1788380	that she's a deep state plant
1788380	1791140	designed to make flat Earthism look bad though.
1791140	1793620	All the people zooming in on every picture of her face
1793620	1795420	they can find in order to speculate
1795420	1797380	that she's a secret trans woman.
1797380	1801620	And I know what a 44-year-old female looks like.
1801620	1804780	You are a 20-something.
1804780	1807260	Being a woman in a conspiracy theorist movement
1807260	1809780	is apparently grounds to have your body,
1809780	1811820	history, goals, agenda,
1811820	1814860	every single tiny thing about you speculated upon.
1814860	1817500	You know, I try and jokingly make fun of people
1817500	1819580	when people act weird on the Internet.
1819580	1820420	Like, keep it light.
1820420	1822260	But honestly, this stuff is so fucking disgusting
1822260	1824180	I'm not even gonna make a joke here.
1824180	1825860	Patricia's wrong about the Earth being flat,
1825860	1827220	but she deserves to be in a move room
1827220	1828260	that's better than this shit.
1828260	1829260	Come on, guys.
1829260	1832020	To be honest, the people treating Patricia like that
1832020	1834220	and the people being mega racist
1834220	1835860	on flat Earth Facebook pages
1835860	1838100	seem to me like the real plants
1838100	1840260	designed to make flat Eartherism look bad.
1841540	1844020	They don't make it look as bad as this guy does, though.

1877020	1879860	Like, two days before this video was going to go online,
1879860	1882540	that guy's channel got deleted by YouTube.
1882540	1885460	I wonder why. I guess it will always remain a mystery.
1885460	1889100	Chapter nine, Flat Earth fucked up my recommendations
1889100	1891100	and you have to suffer with me.
1891100	1893940	Oh, great. I accidentally went to the shitty side of YouTube.

1897620	1899100	Eh.
1899100	1900980	I just had to say that phrase, but it's all true.
1900980	1903900	And now my recommendations are full of the really weird people
1903900	1906700	who seem a bit like they might be using flat Earth
1906700	1910140	as a refuge for some kind of deep existential emptiness
1910140	1912700	and film themselves walking around in public
1912700	1914580	asking people if they think the Earth is flat
1914580	1916900	in a Buffalo Wild Wings parking lot

1925740	1928340	You see there? I tried to have a conversation
1928340	1929580	and, of course, they don't like it
1929580	1931540	because they start losing the argument
1931540	1933420	because they can't make any real points.
1933420	1935460	Ah, my favorite kind of reasonable debate.
1935460	1937780	The kind where you walk up to someone in public with a camera
1937780	1939820	and demand they debunk flat Earth.
1939820	1942860	He seems to be following the Ben Shapiro strategy of making videos
1942860	1944140	where you give it a title like,
1944140	1947380	oh, I kick their asses with my smart boy brain
1947380	1948580	and then you actually watch it
1948580	1951060	and it's them making complete ass of themselves.

1974940	1979660	He's made Lunar Module or Homeless Tweakers shelter
1979660	1982300	and he's going around filming random people on their day off
1982300	1986700	from work or at work asking them if they think the Earth is flat
1986700	1989180	and they keep awkwardly nodding and saying he's right
1989180	1990540	in the hopes he'll go away.
1990540	1992860	Have you ever seen the Earth curving?
1992860	1993660	No.
1993660	1994780	Me neither.
1994780	1995660	You know why?
1995660	1998780	It's because the Earth is flat and it doesn't spin.
1998780	1999580	Look into it.
1999580	2002860	When you get home, go on YouTube and check out the flat Earth.
2002860	2003820	Uh, not Spielberg.
2003820	2005500	They say it was, uh, Stanley Kubrick.
2005500	2006220	Okay.
2006220	2006700	Kubrick.
2006700	2007900	That was the rumor.
2007900	2010300	Whoever, whatever it was is Hollywood trickery.
2010300	2015420	It's so awkward and he's so sure he's owning people and looks smart.
2015420	2018620	I'm getting sympathy anxiety for the people he's talking to.
2018620	2020700	It's just, ah, no.
2020700	2021500	Stop it.
2021500	2023180	Well, let me ask you this.
2023180	2024140	Oh, God.
2024140	2025900	Do you think that looks more like a Lunar Module
2025900	2028780	or a Homeless Tweaker shelter if you had to pick one?
2028780	2030140	Is this really happening?
2030140	2031580	Just if you had to pick one.
2031580	2036300	Why did he choose such an unwieldy quote to use on the shirt he designed
2036300	2039180	and then was going to say a lot in a video?
2039180	2041500	Why is this his opening to his compass?
2042460	2044300	It's such a terrible shirt.
2044300	2044860	Why did he?
2044860	2046060	So I'm wearing a shirt now.
2046060	2050940	I recreated it to try and understand what's, what the deal is, what it's going on here.
2050940	2052940	And frankly, I still don't get it.
2052940	2054300	It was a complete waste of time.
2055260	2058220	Um, if I ever open a merch store and you see this shirt on it,
2058220	2061260	uh, it's the one shirt that I made of these.
2061260	2064620	So, um, I'll sign it or something if you want.
2064620	2066300	Please do not wear it in public, though.
2066300	2068380	No one will want to be your friend.
2068380	2071100	So, yeah, we probably should at least acknowledge it.
2071100	2073180	Some of these people believe there's a global,
2073820	2078940	flattled conspiracy to control the world and eat everyone's minds.
2078940	2082460	Some of them are misogynists and some of them are really racist.
2082460	2085660	It could be one of these, uh, bloodlines in this sort of elite.
2085660	2087900	Oh, it's the Rothschilds, is it?
2087900	2088400	Oh, okay.
2089180	2089980	That's normal.
2089980	2093020	And some of them are vegan neo-Nazi rappers.
2093660	2097420	But I'm sure every movement has its share of problematic people
2097420	2100140	who embarrass everyone else and who they wish would go away.
2100940	2103340	I can't think of any left-wing YouTubers who are like that.
2103340	2104380	Oh, it's me, isn't it?
2104380	2108620	Dispensing with the really sort of weird elements of the movement,
2109420	2110780	the question still remains,
2110780	2113660	why do people think the Earth is flat if the evidence is so bad?
2115820	2119180	Frankly, I'm not very good at figuring out why other people do things.
2119180	2120940	I just do what Sobek commands me,
2120940	2123500	and in return, he ensures that my harvest is bountiful
2123500	2125100	and my sperm is never-ending.
2125100	2126780	So we're gonna have to turn to an outside source
2126780	2129580	to do all of this deep-thinking stuff.
2129580	2131740	Let's find out what popular talkie-thinkie man
2131740	2134380	Philo-Sophie Tube has to say for himself, shall we?
2145100	2145820	Hey, Ollie.
2145820	2146780	I was just wondering,
2146780	2149580	what do philosophers think of people who think the Earth is fl-
2156300	2158460	I'll just reference the video you made a year ago.
2158460	2159580	It's fine.
2168620	2173580	Mr. Mark Sargent.
2177180	2181500	For the rest of the scientific community,
2181500	2183100	I come bearing a message.
2184380	2185580	I like science.
2185580	2186620	I always have.
2186620	2188620	I flew here on the back of science.
2188620	2189820	Oh, you flew here, did you?
2189820	2191900	I wonder what model of the Earth the pilot you-
2191900	2192400	No.
2193020	2194140	Don't be mean.
2194140	2194780	Don't-
2194780	2195580	Sorry.
2195580	2197660	I promised myself I wouldn't be rude to these people.
2199180	2199580	Stop it.
2199580	2199980	Carry on.
2199980	2200380	Stop it.
2200380	2203020	You've taken what should have been simple observations
2203020	2205100	and twisted them to suit your needs
2205100	2206300	and make us feel small.
2207100	2209260	We're not small and we're not an accident.
2209980	2212380	In fact, we are the new scientists.
2212380	2213260	No, Mark, don't say that.
2213260	2214300	I promised I wouldn't-
2214300	2215180	You can't-
2215180	2215900	Oh, fuck!
2215900	2218460	There's a new science in town, baby,
2218460	2221260	and an inordinate amount of it is based on
2221260	2223340	what logo the UN uses.
2226300	2229740	Okay, so I deliberately avoided bringing up Mark Sargent's videos too much
2229740	2230940	because they're not very good.
2230940	2232700	I don't want to make Flat Earthers just look bad
2232700	2235340	by pointing out how absolutely ridiculous
2235340	2237260	the videos that got them into it are,
2237260	2239180	and I just don't want to be mean to someone
2239180	2241340	just because they're ignorant and wrong.
2241340	2242140	But you know what?
2242140	2242620	Fuck him.
2242620	2244780	It's 8.50 p.m. on Christmas Eve.
2244780	2248060	He just said he's the new fucking science.
2248060	2249820	This is my present to myself.
2249820	2252860	I'm gonna fucking dunk on Mark Sargent for being obviously wrong.
2252860	2255180	You know that whole logistics thing I pointed out earlier?
2255180	2257100	Here's how he brings it up and debunks it.
2257100	2258620	Now, this is where you come in and say,
2258620	2261260	well, it's probably an isolated incident
2261260	2263820	or some strange connection thing.
2263820	2265180	You know how the airlines are.
2266060	2267580	Oh, no, my friends.
2267580	2268080	No.
2272140	2273660	Mark Sargent's video doesn't even acknowledge
2273660	2275580	the existence of non-stop flights.
2275580	2277260	In fact, he says they don't exist.
2277260	2280860	The first part of the clue is the utter lack of non-stop flights
2280860	2282700	from anywhere in this hemisphere.
2282700	2286300	Flying from international cities like Sydney, Rio, Santiago,
2286300	2288540	or anywhere else close by,
2288540	2291740	you can't get a single non-stop flight
2291820	2293740	no matter how much money you pay.
2293740	2295900	So now it becomes clear why so much of Flat Earth
2295900	2297660	is pointless fluff or speculation
2297660	2299340	about all the people who must be in on it.
2299340	2302140	They have to avoid making quantifiable claims
2302140	2303980	because otherwise, when you put it in terms
2303980	2305660	that can be proven or disproven,
2305660	2307260	there's a chance your actual reasons
2307260	2308460	for believing what you believe
2308460	2310860	can be openly demonstrated to be wrong.
2310860	2312140	The Earth can't be a globe
2312140	2313580	because there's no non-stop flights
2313580	2315340	across countries in the Southern Hemisphere.
2315340	2316700	Oh, wait, someone Googled it
2316700	2318060	and it turns out there are?
2318060	2319420	Fucking oops!
2319420	2321420	I meant to say a bunch of weird waffle
2321420	2323580	about how we don't really know what gravity is,
2323580	2325900	so let's ramble about that instead.
2325900	2326940	What is gravity?
2326940	2329340	My worldview feels so much more safe
2329340	2332140	when I'm talking absolute fucking nonsense.
2332140	2333980	Has everyone seen The Truman Show?
2333980	2335180	Oh, and while we're at it, Mark,
2335180	2338060	it's not cute that you fucking hold your microphone
2338060	2339980	on all of your podcasts like this.
2339980	2341340	It makes for terrible audio.
2341340	2343260	We can hear you fumbling with it constantly.
2343260	2344620	Just put it on a stand.
2344620	2346860	The person you've been streaming with
2346860	2349020	for, like, years has a stand.
2349020	2350700	Why have you not copied her thing?
2350700	2351900	Just use a stand.
2351900	2354780	Also, it's very clear you were wearing a clip-on mic
2354780	2356460	when you came out to do this speech,
2356460	2357740	and I guess you fucked it up
2357740	2359180	because the audio didn't work.
2359180	2361980	Okay, just pick up.
2363420	2364860	I'll do this just in case.
2364860	2366860	So you decided you had to use the onboard mics
2366860	2368540	and then you weren't even using them right,
2368540	2369980	so a guy had to come and correct you.
2371020	2372300	Oh, we're gonna do both.
2372300	2372860	Sorry about that.
2373500	2375660	Why do you have so many problems with microphones?
2375660	2377980	If you just Googled how to do sound,
2377980	2381100	your videos would have been, like, 30% more bearable.
2381100	2384060	Whose video was that with the moon and the clouds?
2384060	2385900	Yeah, and I don't even think that was the moon.
2385900	2387100	That looked like the sun.
2387100	2387600	Was it?
2388620	2389120	Just...
2389580	2391660	Why are you so bad at everything, Mark?
2391660	2392140	You don't...
2392140	2393820	You're not even a good flat-earther.
2393820	2395100	I have to talk around you
2395100	2398700	or it makes me look like I'm trying to make you people look stupid.
2398700	2401260	And do you think you're the fucking scientist?
2401260	2402780	Fucking Jesus Christ!
2404220	2405340	I think what really gets me...
2408140	2410140	...
2410140	2411020	In his video,
2411020	2413420	Flat Earth or Why Do People Reject Science,
2413420	2415260	philosopher Oliver Thorne says that
2415260	2417820	flat-earthers don't actually reject science.
2417820	2419420	See, he's being very clever with his title.
2419420	2420140	It's a clever boy.
2420140	2421020	Check his videos out.
2421020	2424620	But they're actually embracing an alternative viewpoint on science
2424620	2427100	which he compares to direct realism.
2427100	2428060	He's right.
2428060	2428860	These people are...
2429900	2431660	...attempting a form of science.
2432460	2435900	And I think that's what really gets to me about them.
2436860	2439740	Not simply that they're pretending they're scientists
2439740	2441900	who've secretly found the truth.
2441900	2444220	Those people are a fucking dime a dozen.
2444220	2446140	Saying that science is good and you know it
2446140	2448780	and you're the genius and everyone else is wrong
2448780	2450940	is basically what being a YouTuber is.
2450940	2455020	People like Mark are right to want to question authorities on issues.
2455020	2457420	They're right to want to question everything they know about reality
2457420	2458780	and the society they live in.
2459420	2462700	And that's because at the centre of flat Earth,
2462700	2463500	not the North Pole,
2463500	2465260	the actual centre of the ideology,
2465260	2469900	its core is a tiny shining fragment of a systemic critique.
2470620	2473900	It's the beginnings of trying to understand
2474940	2478620	what's wrong with our society and what to do about it.
2478620	2481340	You know, flat Earthers and people like them
2481340	2483340	who embrace alternative solutions,
2483340	2485340	like eating raw meat.
2485340	2489180	In fact, Jake the Asshole, flat Earth boy,
2489180	2490460	yell at people, man,
2491020	2492540	eats raw meat a bunch.
2492540	2493180	It's disgusting.
2493180	2495180	I almost threw up watching one of his videos.
2495500	2499100	People seek these solutions because they perceive,
2499100	2500380	on some level, a problem.
2501260	2503500	And they're right.
2504060	2506860	Something is wrong with the world right now.
2506860	2509100	The world is figuratively on fire.
2509100	2510940	World leaders are asleep at the wheel.
2510940	2514300	There's nothing in place to prevent another massive financial crash
2514300	2517980	which will destroy thousands, if not millions, of livelihoods.
2517980	2520220	And ecologically speaking, on top of being, you know,
2520220	2522780	figuratively on fire, the Earth is literally on fire.
2522780	2524460	Wildfires are getting worse.
2524460	2526540	Temperatures are shifting all over the place.
2526540	2528540	Ice is melting at an astounding rate.
2529900	2534300	Even on a globe Earth, the edge is coming fast.
2534300	2538540	So I can't blame anyone for feeling alienated and lonely
2538540	2541740	about living in, you know, late capitalist society.
2541740	2545100	You know, at least under feudalism, we had job security.
2545100	2547820	So, of course, people are going to try and find something
2547820	2551580	that helps them cope or seems like a solution.
2551580	2554220	I mean, that's why you get cults.
2554220	2555820	That's why you get Scientology.
2555820	2558620	That's why you get Jordan Peterson supporters.
2558620	2562620	You know, something is wrong, and we can all tell.
2563260	2567420	And some people have arrived at a solution that doesn't really work
2567420	2570220	or, at the very least, makes them feel a little bit better.
2570220	2573980	Some people feel really good, like they're really owning the Marxists
2573980	2576460	by not eating their vegetables until they get scurvy.
2577180	2580380	And then that's where the problems begin, isn't it?
2580380	2584220	Because believing these things isn't a solution,
2585260	2588780	and it's not really accurate about what the problems are.
2589740	2591020	The problem isn't NASA.
2591020	2592540	The problem isn't the Earth being flat.
2593100	2594540	The problem is something else.
2594540	2597100	If you're a flat earther and you made it all the way to the end of this video,
2597660	2598460	wow!
2598460	2599820	This video was way too long,
2600380	2604140	but I watched fucking dozens of hours of your documentaries,
2604140	2606780	so I guess you owe me.
2607500	2610540	But if I can give a little word of advice,
2611980	2615500	you're right to feel that something is wrong.
2616700	2617820	Because something is wrong.
2618940	2621980	Just maybe keep looking for the source of what that thing is,
2621980	2624220	because the Earth is not flat.
2626380	2628860	The Earth is an oblate spheroid.
2629420	2632300	I heard one guy say oblate once, and that was it.
2632300	2633820	I just now say it every time.
2633820	2635260	Just keep looking.
2635260	2636460	Keep trying to figure out a solution.
2637020	2642380	And maybe next Christmas, Mark Sargent will be Mark's Sargent.
2643580	2644300	It's a good one.
2645180	2646780	Oh, God, my hair looks awful.
2646780	2648860	And see you all next year.
2648860	2650460	I'm gonna do more videos next year, I promise.
2650460	2652380	And I'm gonna do that charity stream soon.
2652380	2656220	I'm gonna play Donkey Kong 64 all the way through until I fucking die.
2657260	2658380	I'll raise money for a charity.
2658380	2660780	I forgot which one it is, and I don't want to do another take
2660780	2662220	because it's bloody freezing in here.
2662220	2663340	I put this on for a reason.
2666780	2669660	This used to light up, but it doesn't.
2697580	2700780	Excuse me.
2700780	2702700	Can moonlight make things cold?
2704940	2708220	I feel like I'm actually being rude to a person by doing this.
2708220	2709660	I'm really sorry.
