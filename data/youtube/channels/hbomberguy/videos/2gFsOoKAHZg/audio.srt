Did you know that, as of maybe 200 years ago,

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,020
everyone thought that the Earth was flat?

11
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,740
Ah, that's actually a joke!

12
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,620
I tricked you! It's a pop-cultural myth!

13
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,780
People have thought that the Earth was a sphere,

14
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,280
more specifically, an oblate spheroid,

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,860
for hundreds, if not thousands of years,

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,620
if you accept Ptolemy's writing

17
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,840
as evidence of that speculation.

18

Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!

For, at the very least, hundreds of years now,

20
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,680
it's been pretty much widely accepted

21
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,000
that the Earth is a globe,

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,760
which means that the modern Flat Earth movements

23
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,380
that exist aren't contiguous with any past movement.

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,780
These people aren't regressives

25
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,620
who want to go back to a certain set of beliefs.

26
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,780
These people are progressives.

27
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,360
They believe in science and reason and evidence.

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,620
They want understanding of the Earth to move forwards,

29
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,000
off of the edge of a cliff,

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,920
which theoretically exists now.

31
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,660
The Earth might have an edge.

That's exciting!

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,340
And today, I wanted to look at some of these people's reasons

34
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,420
for their beliefs, their evidence,

35
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,720
and I wanted to see what we, as independent thinkers,

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,220
can make of their findings.

37
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,640

Chapter 1, How Flat Earth Came Back from the Edge.

42
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,040
So, I'm not kidding about Flat Earth-erism being recent.

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,620
There are numerous Flat Earth societies

44
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,660
that have been around for, like, 200 years,

45
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,760
but usually they're just a couple of people now,

46
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,260
just keeping the lights on,

47
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,180
and even then, they were seen as weirdos by most people.

48
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,180
Then, on Facebook in the early years,

49
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,800
there were people who were, like, opening joke pages,

50
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,800
pretending to be a Flat Earth society,

51
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,060
and it was just people having fun,

52
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,860
making silly, sort of fake memes,

53
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,560
and it is, let's all admit,

54
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,520
very funny to call someone a globehead.

55
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,360
But then, I don't know, society utterly fucking collapsed

56
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,980
when I wasn't looking or something,

57
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,700
because now, in addition to some people

58
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,940
believing that the free market is real and a good idea,

59
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,820
some people believe the much less harmful

60
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,660
and ridiculous fairy tale that the Earth is flat.

61
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,800
As of 2015, Flat Earth membership has grown massively,

62
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,360
and now there's even a full Flat Earth convention

63
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,280
with people flying in from all around the globe

64
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,740
to take part and pool their collective knowledge.

65
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,320
Even some celebrities have voiced support for the movement,

66
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,780
like Logan Paul, who's universally known

67
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,620
for making well-thought-out decisions,

68
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,240
and famous rapper...Bob?

69
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,080
Little Robbie currently has a GoFundMe

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,300
asking for a million dollars to send up drones

71
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,380
and weather balloons and satellites

72
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,900
and rockets and stuff,

73
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,440
and I kind of admire his, uh, commitment to science.

74
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,320
He's really willing to put other people's money

75
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,200
where his mouth is and find out the shape of the Earth.

76
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,540
But what caused Bob to think the Earth

77
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,780
was flat in the first place?

78
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,960
Let's find out and dive into the first documentary

79
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,840
I saw while I was researching Flat Earth,

80
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,300
Odd TV's The True Earth.

81
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,580
Like everyone else, you were born into bondage,

82
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,180
born into a prison for your mind.

The Matrix is a good movie.

87
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,100
Oh, God, I've got to make that Night in the Woods video.

88
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,060
Our daily observations of the Earth

89
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,140
are consistent with a flat and stationary surface.

90
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,500
Most, if not all, ancient civilizations

91
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,540
knew that the Earth was flat.

92
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,220
Okay, that's an interesting start.

93
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,220
Um, chapter two.

94
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,580
That's not how knowledge works!

95
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,860
Okay, so philosophers and linguists and discoursists

96
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,820
and those ivory tower Marxists I've heard so much about

97
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,300
argue incessantly on the concepts of knowledge and truth.

98
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,020
They're all wrong, and I'm right, and here's how it works.

99
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,500
People don't simply know things.

100
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,460
People believe something to be true,

101
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,460
or to put it another way, they think they know something.

102
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,980
What Odd TV actually means here

103
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,620
is that most ancient civilizations,

104
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,900
or at least some of them, depending on how far back you go,

105
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,380
thought they knew the Earth was flat.

106
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,340
And he's ascribing knowledge to them

107
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,980
so that they definitely knew this

108
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,900
in order to make it seem more credible

109
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,300
that that thing is true.

110
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,820
The people of today would say

111
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,180
that ancient cultures were ignorant and unaware,

112
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,820
yet they accomplished great feats

113
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,700
that we still can't accomplish to this day.

114
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,220
The ancient Egyptians built the pyramids,

115
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,700
so how could they be wrong about unrelated issues?

116
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,180
The ancient Egyptians knew

117
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,180
that pharaohs were living incarnations of a humanoid god

118
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,900
with a crocodile's head named Sobek,

119
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,100
who was the lord of semen

120
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,100
and helped the sun move through the sky,

121
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,580
presumably by blasting it with sperm.

122
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,580
The ancient Egyptians knew this thousands of years ago,

123
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,260
and yet every year we deny the sperm lord

124
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,380
his offerings of mummified crocodiles.

125
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,180
And once more, we threaten to awaken his anger.

126
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,660
Those of you who think this technical difficulty was planned...

127
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,020
I forgot about this part.

128
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,940
This video in particular is great because, okay, spoilers.

129
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,860
There aren't that many pro-flat Earth arguments.

130
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,860
There's a couple of people

131
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,460
who keep trying to come up with new ones,

132
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,980
but really there's, like, five main ones,

133
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,900
and then everyone keeps kind of ripping them off

134
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,020
and rewording them and coming up with slightly different ways

135
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,580
of saying the same thing over and over again.

136
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,220
And this documentary goes one step further

137
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,140
and rather than remaking those arguments

138
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,300
for an 18th millionth time,

139
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,220
it actually just borrows clips

140
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,740
from videos people have already made.

141
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,580
It's great.

142
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,060
This is live on the air, okay?

143
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,540
I'm gonna zoom in on the Earth in Photoshop.

144
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,660
Image, adjust, levels,

145
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,420
and I'm gonna bring the levels up.

146
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,940
Uh-oh.

147
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,180
What is that?

148
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,180
Why is there a square box around the Earth

149
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,020
allegedly taken from the scientists

150
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,540
on the moon in Apollo 17?

151
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,020
And people wonder why I don't trust NASA.

152
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,140
That's why I don't trust NASA.

153
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,980
I mean, they're always out there saying-

154
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,700
Uh, uh, wait a second, mate.

155
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,580
Wait, wait, wait.

156
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,100
Hold on a second.

157
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,940
Let me get my mouse.

158
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,900
Let's quickly create a new image.

159
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,500
Make it 3,000 by 3,000 pixels, 72 pixels per inch.

160
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,020
Let's do a deep fake.

161
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,100
Let's fake our own pale blue dot.

162
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,820
That's not a, that's not a dot.

163
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,980
You gotta hold shift to make it perfectly circular.

164
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,900
Don't make that mistake next time, globalists.

165
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,060
Oh, look, that's some shine.

166
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,340
That's an ocean.

167
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,980
Oh, that's the land we all live on.

168
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,460
That's exactly what Ptolemy's map looks like.

169
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,220
So if we were to do this adjustment right here

170
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,660
with the image levels, turn it all the way up,

171
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,180
you'll see that there's no, nothing goes up.

172
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,100
Nothing goes up at all.

173
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,940
Wow, look.

174
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,420
If only they'd properly cut the Earth out,

175
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,860
NASA could have gotten away with it

176
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,260
if it weren't for those meddling Photoshop users.

177
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,860
Let's save it as a JPEG,

178
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,420
and let's make it medium compression.

179
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,300
So this is like an average amount of JPEG compression

180
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,340
for an image on the internet.

181
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,740
Now let's, let's quickly open up our untitled 1.JPEG

182
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,580
in Photoshop ourselves.

183
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,980
Now let's turn the levels up.

184
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,940
Oh my God.

185
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,180
Oh my God.

186
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,060
It's a fake Earth picture that wasn't cut out properly.

187
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,940
It's JPEG compression.

188
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,300
You fucking idiot.

189
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,020
Okay, I'm already incredibly bored of this documentary.

190
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,460
It's the same music clip playing over and over

191
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,940
for 30 minutes, and it's jarring having all these

192
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,660
other voices just kind of come in.

193
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,100
It's, it's just not, it's just not very well made.

194
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,460
And I've decided to just move on to other people's videos,

195
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,500
which usually make the same points anyway.

196
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,780
And we might even run into one of the videos

197
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,620
that they stole.

198
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,180
But one thing I do want to bring up is a meme

199
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,980
that I saw posted here first,

200
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,700
and I've seen it around since then,

201
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,980
towards the end of the documentary.

202
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,060
And when I was watching the first time,

203
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,500
I had to pause and just kind of laugh at it.

204
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,900
It's, it's this picture here.

205
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,820
It's so fascinating.

206
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,060
It's so direct.

207
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,700
And it doesn't get what it's really saying.

208
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,460
Like, just maybe don't brag too triumphantly

209
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,460
about how you don't read books.

210
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,620
Chapter three, he who smelts it.

211
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,260
Anyway, one of the main folks credited

212
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,380
with getting the ball rolling in Flat Earth,

213
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,500
just a little joke from me to you,

214
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,500
is Mark Sargent and his video series

215
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,540
entitled Flat Earth Clues.

216
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,980
I've now heard about two or three dozen people

217
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,980
say that this series is what really got them

218
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,820
into the whole thing and taking it seriously.

219
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,420
Are we inside a Truman Show-enclosed world

220
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,100
thousands of miles wide?

221
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,980
It's just like in the Truman Show.

222
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,140
Oh, God.

223
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,580
No, no, be nice, be nice.

224
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,900
Growing up on South Whidbey Island, Washington,

225
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,460
Mark Sargent started his career

226
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,180
playing computer games professionally

227
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,460
in Boulder, Colorado.

228
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,900
Oh, great, a fellow gamer.

229
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,140
He must be reasonable.

230
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,660
Early in 2015, he released a series of YouTube videos

231
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,940
titled Flat Earth Clues,

232
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,260
which delves into the possibility

233
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,140
of our human civilization actually being inside

234
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,540
a Truman Show-like enclosed, you already said

235
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,220
Truman Show earlier in the description.

236
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,900
Like, at least reference a different movie.

237
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,500
In other words, this is the video series

238
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,540
that everyone else is cribbing from,

239
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,620
so we should probably check it out, shouldn't we?

240
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,860
Two hours.

241
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,060
I always wanted to do this joke

242
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,860
and this actually took me two hours.

243
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,580
Well, that was a waste of time.

244
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,340
Okay, I've now watched Mark's entire 14-part

245
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,700
plus extras series about how the Earth is flat,

246
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,740
which took a couple of hours,

247
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,100
and what really jumps out at me

248
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,620
is how shockingly boring and unconvincing it is.

249
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,820
Like, you think this is the original one,

250
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,260
this is the one that got him,

251
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,020
and it's a slideshow with, like, a guy kind of rambling,

252
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,420
and he talks, like, he's really convinced,

253
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,820
he knows the truth,

254
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,740
and I assume people believe this

255
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,460
because they're like, well, he sounds really into it,

256
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,940
he must be onto something,

257
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,140
but it's, like, really, really unconvincing.

258
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,780
In order to summarize the point

259
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,140
in any one of those videos that they make,

260
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,220
you would have to edit around and cut across in time

261
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,220
so much to kind of formulate the actual point

262
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,700
so much that it would feel deceptive,

263
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,340
like I'm sort of pulling some kind of trick

264
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:20,780
by trying to get to the point he's making in a simpler way,

265
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,740
and the evidence that he refers to

266
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,700
is so thin on the ground

267
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,460
that it doesn't even meet any burden of proof

268
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,180
for it to be something that I would need to debunk anyway.

269
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,020
Part 7, for example, long haul

270
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,580
is the one that really sticks out to me.

271
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,340
It takes him 10 minutes to effectively say,

272
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,980
I looked up some flights,

273
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,860
and I think they show the Earth is flat.

274
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,380
That's all he had to say, but it takes 10 minutes.

275
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,220
I promised myself when I was researching

276
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,700
something like Flat Earth

277
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,460
that I would try and find the strongest possible versions

278
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,660
of any argument that I responded to or debunked

279
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,380
because with a movement as big and full of all kinds

280
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,300
of sort of amateur people as Flat Earth,

281
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,380
it's very easy to find someone making the point very badly

282
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,260
and go, ha, and then pretend

283
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,220
you've discredited the entire argument,

284
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,900
and I didn't want to do that,

285
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,140
and I just want to acknowledge here that it's really weird

286
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,820
that the guy everyone credits with getting them in on it

287
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,340
is, the videos are bad.

288
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,740
Like, watch them, please, if you can stand it.

289
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,620
It's just not very well put together,

290
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,620
and that's just a bit weird to me

291
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,220
because they're supposed to be the best ones.

292
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,900
Take the long-haul flight one I mentioned already.

293
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,140
Two months after that came out,

294
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,500
someone who's clearly seen that one

295
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,860
has already honed the point that Sargent was trying to make

296
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,700
down into one that's actually a good video,

297
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,260
and that video has, like, six times more views.

298
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,500
We'll get to that video in a second,

299
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,780
but first, if the globe model is wrong,

300
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,740
what's the alternative?

301
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,900
I think it's time we looked at

302
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,940
what a Flat Earth map actually looks like.

303
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,740
Chapter four, Discworld, but not the fun one.

304
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,060
This is a poster I had made

305
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,540
of Gleason's new standard map of the world.

306
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,460
It was made in the late 1800s,

307
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,020
and it shows what purports to be

308
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,700
what the Earth actually looks like when it's flat.

309
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,820
Now, this isn't the exact map that Flat Earthers use.

310
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,780
What they use is a version of this

311
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,460
that's projected the same way.

312
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,300
There are lots of different ways

313
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,740
you can project planet Earth.

314
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,420
The Gleason map and other supposedly slightly more accurate

315
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,780
and realistic Flat Earth maps

316
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,820
aren't actually just made up from something.

317
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,580
They're based on a type of map projection

318
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,820
that already existed,

319
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,700
known as azimuthal equidistant projection,

320
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,380
not named for its creator, Philip Azimuth,

321
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,860
because I just made that guy up,

322
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,020
and that projection method isn't completely useless.

323
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,220
It's not just a silly picture.

324
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,580
It's good for being able to tell

325
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,700
what angle and distance you are from the North Pole.

326
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,420
This is really accurate to where you are

327
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,780
in relation to the North Pole,

328
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,300
especially compared to other projections

329
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,500
where the North Pole is, like, the wrong size

330
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,620
or in the wrong place

331
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,180
because otherwise you wouldn't be able to see it properly

332
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,540
because flat maps are just inherently always a bit wrong.

333
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,460
It also, as you can see, looks pretty nice.

334
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,620
In fact, a stylized version of this projection

335
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,820
is used as the logo for the UN

336
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,980
because they're in on it, obviously.

337
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,300
Most notable things about this map,

338
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,340
the North Pole is now directly in the center of the Earth,

339
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,260
and instead of there being a South Pole anywhere,

340
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,740
it's now encircling the entire Earth

341
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,620
in a giant wall of ice.

342
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,660
Now I know what you're thinking.

343
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,420
Does this map hold any water?

344
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,500
And the answer is, that's what the ice is for.

345
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,900
By the way, does that mean global warming

346
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,460
is now, like, way, way worse?

347
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,820
Because, like, if the ice were melted,

348
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,020
all the water would flow out

349
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:40,540
and we'd all die of no-water-itis.

350
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,780
I mean, on globe Earth,

351
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:49,140
we'd all just drown and then boil instead.

352
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,260
Yay!

353
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,620
Another feature of this map

354
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,900
is that what used to be the Southern Hemisphere

355
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,140
is now much further away from itself, as it were.

356
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,300
Australia is now much further away

357
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,860
from Africa or South America.

358
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,500
And also, everything is increasingly distorted

359
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,220
the further out you get.

360
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,780
Australia is now much, much wider than it used to be,

361
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,980
even though people have actually measured Australia,

362
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,020
and it's about as long as it is wide.

363
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,780
But clearly, Sobek got to those guys, too.

364
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,540
How does this affect travel?

365
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,140
Because, obviously, now that all the shapes

366
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,020
and distances are very different,

367
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,580
especially in the Southern Hemisphere,

368
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,740
surely flight plans would be affected by this?

369
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,620
They'd have to account for the non-curvature of the Earth

370
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,940
and everything being in a different place?

371
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,220
Well, luckily, this is something Mark Sargent

372
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,220
and the clever disc boys at the Flat Earth Society

373
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,820
say actually makes more sense on a flat Earth.

374
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,340
Chapter five, how do airlines work?

375
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,540
Here's a video entitled,

376
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,100
The Earth is Flat.

377
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,820
The Planes Help to Prove the Plane.

378
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,140
It's got over 900,000 views.

379
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,260
This is the video that I would say is something

380
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,780
of an improvement on the arguments

381
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,740
that Mark Sargent makes in his video entitled Long Haul.

382
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,180
The arguments are still wrong, but they're made better,

383
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,780
so points for that, plus that pun.

384
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,540
I mean, oh, boy.

385
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,460
He looks up trips from Sydney, Australia,

386
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,900
to Santiago, Chile,

387
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,460
and notes that getting there requires multiple stops

388
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,740
at other airports that are relatively out of the way

389
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,580
and inefficient on the globe model,

390
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,700
but on the flat Earth model,

391
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,540
they form an almost straight line.

392
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,380
You have to actually get up into the Northern Hemisphere

393
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,580
and then come back down,

394
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,140
so that doesn't make any sense.

395
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,620
So I mapped it on the flat Earth map,

396
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,660
and whoa.

397
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,500
Whoa.

398
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,940
This is a huge thing for flat Earthers

399
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,940
because unlike all the stuff they have to just ignore

400
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,340
or prove is a big lie that didn't happen,

401
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,020
this is something which supposedly proves

402
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,020
that the flat Earth model is true.

403
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,740
Mark Sargent says this is the thing you should start with

404
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,860
if you're trying to explain the whole thing to someone.

405
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,780
If you were looking to show someone

406
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,540
how to view the flat Earth from a practical point of view,

407
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,340
this is the example I would use.

408
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,940
Mark, you could have started with that

409
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,060
and not waited until part seven,

410
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,980
like an hour in.

411
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,740
Please hire an editor.

412
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,260
There are so many counterpoints to this.

413
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,380
I don't know where to start, really.

414
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,100
Um, I suppose we should start with London City Airport.

415
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,300
It makes far more business sense for airlines

416
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,220
to offer shorter connecting flights

417
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,340
that can be used as part of a wider trip

418
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,340
than one direct flight to the one place

419
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,300
that one group of people might happen to go.

420
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,700
You know airports aren't magic.

421
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,300
Like, it takes a certain amount of time

422
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,660
for a plane to take off and land on a runway,

423
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,380
and there's only so many runways.

424
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,660
You think London City Airport,

425
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,980
with its minuscule, piddly little piss runway,

426
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,100
has the time to furnish flights to Chile?

427
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,220
What are you talking about, mate?

428
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,220
That said, that doesn't mean that long-distance flights

429
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,300
like this never happen.

430
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,580
There's actually a direct flight from Sydney to Santiago,

431
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,260
Qantas QF27.

432
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,900
It goes nonstop and takes way less time

433
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,300
than the non-direct routes.

434
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,460
On a flat Earth map, QF27 would take far longer

435
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,420
than the supposedly direct paths,

436
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,060
and also the distance would be so much longer

437
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,100
that the plane would run out of fuel and crash in the ocean.

438
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,980
How does this guy deal with the existence of this flight,

439
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,860
or a flight with just one connection

440
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,300
that doesn't go the direct route on a flat Earth map?

441
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,020
Well, they actually do pop up on his flight tracker.

442
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,100
That's the first clue I found to these flights existing.

443
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,020
But I don't think this flight ever takes off.

444
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:26,820
Uh, it's available only Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday also.

445
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,820
Kind of pinch you out and make you do something different.

446
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,180
He actually says that they're not real.

447
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:38,540
I don't think either one of these two flights are real.

448
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:43,500
Um, they're just kind of there to, um,

449
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,060
keep guys like me from figuring this shit out.

450
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,900
He sees through Qantas's dastardly trick

451
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,660
to sell tickets to a plane that's real.

452
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,020
You can watch footage of the flight.

453
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,500
Look, why would Qantas do all of this

454
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,620
just to make people think that the Earth was a globe?

455
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,940
What do they get from that?

456
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,540
Like, what's the... I don't understand.

457
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,780
The guy tries to do Johannesburg to Perth, too.

458
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,980
And once again, we only have one non-stop.

459
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,940
Almost as if there's reasons

460
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,860
why you wouldn't have that many flights

461
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,180
going that one direct flight.

462
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:18,900
Almost.

463
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,540
Uh, these two in black,

464
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,060
this is the non-stop that they have to Perth.

465
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,580
But the reason I put these in black

466
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,660
is because I don't think they exist either.

467
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,220
Oh, no, of course not.

468
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,100
I mean, I've actually met someone who's been on that flight.

469
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,500
But whatever, maybe they're in on it, too.

470
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,700
Maybe I'm in on it, too.

471
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,820
Hail Sobek.

472
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,620
We need to keep everyone thinking the Earth is a globe.

473
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,540
That way we can...

474
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,140
Um, hang on one second.

475
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,900
Yeah, why are we doing this again?

476
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,980
Uh, I thought it would be funny.

477
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,740
When he maps those supposed more direct trips

478
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,140
he found onto the Flat Earth,

479
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,620
and by maps, I mean draws shit squiggly lines

480
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,980
that in no way match up with the flight plans,

481
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,780
one of them doesn't make sense on the Flat Earth either.

482
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,620
It goes all the way out of the way to Sydney

483
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,580
before it doubles back and heads to Perth.

484
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,540
Uh, these are all the flights to Sydney.

485
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:14,780
So it still looks like a pretty long shot to Sydney.

486
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,620
Um, but who knows?

487
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,220
Maybe this map isn't even correct.

488
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,220
Who knows? I don't know.

489
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,620
Mm-hmm.

490
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,860
Mm-hmm.

491
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,260
Maybe.

492
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:31,380
Maybe this map of the Flat Earth isn't correct.

493
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,380
Maybe it's not.

494
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,340
Maybe.

495
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,620
Chapter six, where's the curve?

496
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,380
Oh, there it is.

497
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,060
Another thing Flat Earthers dispute

498
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,660
is the curvature of the Earth.

499
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,700
I mean, if it's flat, it can't be curved

500
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,020
can it? Well, I guess it could be slightly convex,

501
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,020
but they don't bring that up for some reason.

502
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,460
The main way they do this consists of filming horizons

503
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,580
or finding footage of horizons and saying,

504
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,260
well, I don't see a curve,

505
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,340
which, uh, you can't see the curvature

506
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,460
that close to the ground.

507
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,340
Perspective doesn't work that way,

508
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,460
and then they go on to assert that all footage

509
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,180
that does show a curvature from high up is faked,

510
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,700
either on purpose by, like, movie studios

511
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,220
working for NASA or accidentally through flaws

512
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,340
in camera equipment.

513
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,340
Some types of wide-angle camera lenses

514
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,620
distort perspective,

515
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,380
and almost all small action cameras like GoPros

516
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,500
have very wide-angle lenses to film as much as possible.

517
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,620
The assertion Flatties then make is,

518
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,540
well, the appearance of a curvature

519
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,340
is therefore the result of looking at the flat horizon

520
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,540
with these lenses,

521
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,300
and if you correct the footage,

522
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,540
the Earth is clearly actually flat,

523
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,180
like in this video by the channel called Flat Earth,

524
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,620
although apparently its original name

525
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,940
was the Mr. King Tuts.

526
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,220
Someone rebranded.

527
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,860
Where's the curvature of the Earth?

528
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,020
None of you can debunk this video.

529
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,100
Anyone with half a brain can see how they use

530
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,820
deceptive wide-angle fisheye lenses to deceive you.

531
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,180
You can't use the word deceive twice in a sentence.

532
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,140
That just doesn't scan.

533
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,860
Oh, and in keeping with Flat Earthers

534
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,140
just copying each other all the time,

535
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,620
this video is literally just taken from another channel.

536
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,460
Now, in my opinion, this is the actual closest

537
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,140
that Flat Earthers have ever got

538
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,780
to actually being right about, uh, anything.

539
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,780
Here's a quick test I did with my old GoPro.

540
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,780
The GoPro's wide lens means it can see

541
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,660
a lot at once.

542
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,500
In fact, it even saw the trash I was sure

543
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,500
would be out of the shot and didn't bother picking up.

544
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,860
However, this perspective is distorted.

545
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,420
I can tell you right now my floor is flat

546
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,020
and doesn't curve downwards here.

547
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,500
As I move the GoPro closer

548
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,140
to this totally normal-shaped sex museum postcard,

549
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,980
we can see the distortion become even more exaggerated.

550
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,900
The beautiful pride flag is ruined.

551
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,820
It looks like Graham Linehan has touched it.

552
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,260
This is me holding a measuring tape

553
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,580
just to give another reference.

554
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,060
The curvature of the Earth is definitely susceptible

555
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,460
to being exaggerated by wide-angle lenses,

556
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,900
but like with JPEG artifacts,

557
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,580
you can't just move a slider and say,

558
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,700
ah, it proves I'm right.

559
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,100
It's not.

560
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,460
Look, I'm gonna use my video editing magical skills again

561
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,460
to show you something.

562
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,820
There isn't, like, a magic fix fisheye lens button

563
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,020
in a video editor.

564
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,900
Whenever I've had to correct fisheye lens footage

565
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,300
for a video, I've had to do it by using an effect

566
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,460
that corrects distortion

567
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,500
and then dialing in the angles manually,

568
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,700
and this stuff is really hard to do by eye.

569
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,980
The best technique for doing this

570
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,460
is to find something you know is supposed to be flat

571
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,860
and then correct until it looks flat.

572
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,300
See, that tape turned out to be there for a reason.

573
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,300
A clever trick.

574
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,300
Now, I'm gonna give you three guesses

575
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,300
what part of the footage

576
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,420
Flat Earthers use

577
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,620
when they are trying to correct footage

578
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,020
to prove that the Earth is flat.

579
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,780
Did you get it?

580
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,940
It's hard to see, but the correction is clearly too much

581
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,220
if you know what to look for.

582
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,860
On the ground, certain things curve

583
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,900
in weird directions just slightly,

584
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,900
and at certain angles during the video,

585
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,940
the Earth starts to look slightly concave.

586
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,900
Our daily observations of the Earth

587
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,900
are consistent with a flat and stationary surface.

588
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,100
I just want to acknowledge how fucking funny it was

589
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,780
when I was watching this documentary for the first time

590
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,260
and it fades from a thing saying,

591
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,220
our world is flat and it's a wide-angle shot

592
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,900
that's not been corrected properly,

593
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,380
so it looks like it's curved.

594
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,860
It's fucking, it looks like the planet is concave.

595
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,780
How do you fuck it up this bad?

596
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,580
From this high up, the Earth's curvature

597
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,660
would, in fact, be visible,

598
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,860
but probably very slight.

599
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,020
You'd have to use a ruler to make sure.

600
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,380
But exactly how curved it would have been

601
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,300
is hard to tell because of the nature

602
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,700
of the footage filmed with these lenses.

603
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,140
You know, the reality is the Earth is flat.

604
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,860
You can't actually see the curvature of the Earth

605
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,340
from the window of a passenger plane.

606
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,900
They don't go high enough to show

607
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,380
more than, like, a degree or two, basically.

608
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,740
You can see the curvature of the horizon,

609
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,100
but only from high up,

610
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,500
and I mean really high up.

611
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,700
Not airline high, not even Mary Jane high.

612
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,540
I'm talking U-2 high.

613
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,980
Come on in here, Bono, The Edge,

614
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,020
Adam...Smane?

615
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,460
Not that U-2, silly.

616
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,940
Ha, we have fun.

617
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,900
I mean, of course, the Lockheed U-2,

618
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,860
a high-altitude spy plane used by the U.S. government.

619
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,580
You might remember the U-2-4.

620
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,660
Its operating height of 70,000 feet,

621
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,740
almost three times the height of a commercial aircraft,

622
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,580
violating international law numerous times,

623
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,260
getting caught violating international law

624
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,380
numerous times when it turned out

625
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,420
it wasn't very good at spying,

626
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,580
getting shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960,

627
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,300
getting shot down in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis

628
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,100
and contributing to the Cold War nearly escalating

629
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,220
into full-scale nuclear war.

630
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,940
Luckily, the U.S. government gave upon

631
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,820
illegally spying on other nations

632
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,860
with a shit plane they can see in 1917.

633
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,220
Sorry, 1918.

634
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,340
Wait, hang on.

635
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,660
They're still using it!

636
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,660
Here's James May, the least shit guy from Top Gear,

637
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,900
taking a ride in one.

638
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,340
You can see that at conventional airplane heights,

639
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,820
the horizon is fairly flat.

640
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,700
Hopefully, this early shot of the horizon

641
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,500
looking really flat establishes

642
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,660
that the lenses aren't distorting anything here.

643
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,460
As he reaches the maximum height,

644
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,660
the atmosphere stops being breathable

645
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,020
and the sky starts to turn black.

646
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,620
At the higher altitudes,

647
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,020
we can finally see both the staggering beauty

648
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,140
of our little blue world,

649
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,180
but also a slight yet pronounced curve on the horizon.

650
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,420
So I think it's fair to say that, in conclusion,

651
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,980
ha-ha, the Earth's curved slightly.

652
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,100
I win.

653
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,460
This has just been a brief rundown

654
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,060
of the flat Earth points that I feel

655
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,300
are at least more credible than the rest.

656
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,740
They get increasingly weird and tangential from here on out.

657
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,580
For example, almost all flat Earthers

658
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,020
say that the moon landing was faked

659
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,900
because if we actually went to the moon

660
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,020
and took pictures of the Earth

661
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,580
and it showed that the Earth was a globe

662
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,980
because it's in different positions

663
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,020
and different in different pictures,

664
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,060
you can't have done that.

665
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,420
So the moon landing has to all be faked

666
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,980
with the extra caveat that goes on top

667
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,820
of the regular moon landing conspiracies,

668
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,300
which is that it was all done

669
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,740
simply to make people think the Earth was round

670
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,860
for some reason.

671
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,860
They try and counter the fact that you can't see things

672
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,220
on the other side of the horizon

673
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,380
by claiming that cameras with long enough zoom lenses,

674
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,020
like the Nikon P900,

675
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,020
can actually show things that should be behind the horizon,

676
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,060
which, uh, no.

677
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,980
That's not what's happening.

678
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,660
The camera can see further

679
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,940
than your disgusting human eyes,

680
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,100
which I thought the point was

681
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,020
they were the only things you could trust,

682
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,660
but no, apparently now we're supposed to trust

683
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,420
the globe heads at Nikon.

684
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,220
I've pronounced that company's name

685
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,620
both of the ways that people pronounce it now,

686
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,740
so everyone gets to yell at me.

687
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,420
Also, Mark Sargent has actually said this.

688
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:19,420
He thinks that the moon gives off its own cold light,

689
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,340
which makes things colder

690
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,660
and therefore proves that the moon

691
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,500
isn't just a rock floating in space.

692
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,900
It's part of the big firmament

693
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,540
that some flat earthers think...

694
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,660
Just one second.

695
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,980
Arranging this to be in the shot properly

696
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,380
makes it actually really hard to dial.

697
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,660
I want you to appreciate that.

698
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,780
Hello.

699
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,620
Hi there.

700
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,420
Is that popular gaming YouTuber UpIsNotJump,

701
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,820
who also incidentally has a master's in chemistry?

702
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,580
Yep, this is the third time I'm recording this

703
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,060
because I got my lines wrong the first time

704
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,340
and then the microphone wasn't on.

705
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,180
Oh.

706
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,220
Excuse me.

707
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,580
Can moonlight make things cold?

708
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,980
No, the moon reflects light from the sun

709
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,740
and the intrinsic property of waves

710
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,660
is basically all waves have energy

711
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,900
because they have a frequency.

712
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,180
It's just the nature of the universe.

713
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,620
Oh, okay, cool, thanks.

714
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,340
Great, yeah, that was easy.

715
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,180
Bye.

716
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,020
Wait, wait, you don't want me to do

717
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,220
a funny sketch or something.

718
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,820
I can do a joke here.

719
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,740
No, the video's looking too long already.

720
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,380
I've decided to leave in the tangent about fighter jets,

721
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,220
so it's probably not worth it.

722
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,060
No, wait, don't go.

723
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,500
I can prove mathematically that this is the correct way.

724
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,380
This all, I feel, leads to a necessary

725
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,220
and important question.

726
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,300
If all of the evidence for the flat Earth

727
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,340
is so, well, easy to throw out,

728
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,300
why do people actually believe it?

729
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,500
Chapter seven, why do people believe things

730
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,660
that are obviously wrong?

731
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,500
Because they're stupid.

732
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,460
Bye.

733
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,060
Would you like to build a beautiful website easily?

734
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,500
Good, so would I.

735
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,900
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

736
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,180
We're not actually gonna do that.

737
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,620
That would be unreasonably rude.

738
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,420
Let's take these people a bit more seriously than that.

739
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,100
Some of them are clearly very knowledgeable.

740
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,420
Some of them have, like, big, important degrees

741
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,380
in serious fields.

742
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,140
They know way much more than I do

743
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,460
about all kinds of actually useful things.

744
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,140
Some of them take evidence very seriously, clearly,

745
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,860
and they believe in the scientific method.

746
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,700
Not all of them.

747
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,260
Some of them are not actually very knowledgeable

748
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,860
about anything and seem to think Donald Trump

749
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,340
is a genius and also he's their guy

750
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,140
and he secretly knows the Earth is flat

751
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,980
and he's gonna expose NASA.

752
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,140
I suppose it would be disingenuous not to talk briefly

753
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,220
about the really weird people.

754
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,380
In fact, the misogyny thing in specific

755
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,100
is really surprising.

756
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,900
One of Mark Sargent's inner sphere, sorry, circle,

757
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,020
Patricia Steer, gets a lot of hate

758
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,540
from other factions of flat Earthers

759
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,100
for supposedly just being in it to be popular.

760
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,860
Or some go even as far as to say

761
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,260
that she's actually a secret CIA plant

762
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,580
designed to make flat Earth look bad

763
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,460
and or trick people with her appearance

764
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:58,860
into making them believe the wrong version of flat Earth.

765
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,180
You better wake your ass up.

766
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,900
All of them is fucking satanic puppets.

767
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,700
Yes, that's why they flashed this one on TV.

768
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:11,020
No doubt about it, it was put there by the CIA on YouTube

769
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,980
to distract the masses that wanna learn the truth.

770
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,220
Yes, the Earth is flat,

771
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,740
but you can never take it from these sodomites.

772
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,900
Of course, they go lead you in the wrong direction.

773
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,860
Wake your ass up.

774
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,780
There go your Patricia Speer right there.

775
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:26,180
It is a plant by the CIA, 100%.

776
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,900
Frankly, even the people who like Patricia

777
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,380
are super weird about it.

778
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,780
I mean, Mark himself made a video

779
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,420
just dedicated to how pretty he thinks she is,

780
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,620
which it's fine.

781
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,780
It's okay to find someone attractive, that's okay.

782
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,540
But it's a bit weird to like make a video

783
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,740
about how pretty you think she is, right?

784
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,460
Still not as bad as the people who think

785
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,380
that she's a deep state plant

786
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,140
designed to make flat Earthism look bad though.

787
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,620
All the people zooming in on every picture of her face

788
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,420
they can find in order to speculate

789
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,380
that she's a secret trans woman.

790
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:01,620
And I know what a 44-year-old female looks like.

791
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,780
You are a 20-something.

792
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,260
Being a woman in a conspiracy theorist movement

793
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,780
is apparently grounds to have your body,

794
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,820
history, goals, agenda,

795
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:14,860
every single tiny thing about you speculated upon.

796
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,500
You know, I try and jokingly make fun of people

797
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,580
when people act weird on the Internet.

798
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,420
Like, keep it light.

799
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,260
But honestly, this stuff is so fucking disgusting

800
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,180
I'm not even gonna make a joke here.

801
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,860
Patricia's wrong about the Earth being flat,

802
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,220
but she deserves to be in a move room

803
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,260
that's better than this shit.

804
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,260
Come on, guys.

805
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,020
To be honest, the people treating Patricia like that

806
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,220
and the people being mega racist

807
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,860
on flat Earth Facebook pages

808
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,100
seem to me like the real plants

809
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,260
designed to make flat Eartherism look bad.

810
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,020
They don't make it look as bad as this guy does, though.

811

Oh, no, everyone's gonna think

818
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,380
I'm trying to misrepresent flat Earthers as misogynists.

819
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,420
Flat Earthers don't inherently disrespect women, okay?

820
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,380

Jeez. Ooh, that'll make his beliefs seem credible.

826
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,020
Pfft. Oh, that's surprising.

827
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,860
Like, two days before this video was going to go online,

828
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,540
that guy's channel got deleted by YouTube.

829
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,460
I wonder why. I guess it will always remain a mystery.

830
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,100
Chapter nine, Flat Earth fucked up my recommendations

831
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,100
and you have to suffer with me.

832
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,940
Oh, great. I accidentally went to the shitty side of YouTube.

833
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:37,620
You click on one vegan, flat Earth, neo-Nazi rap, but...

834
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,100
Eh.

835
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,980
I just had to say that phrase, but it's all true.

836
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,900
And now my recommendations are full of the really weird people

837
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,700
who seem a bit like they might be using flat Earth

838
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,140
as a refuge for some kind of deep existential emptiness

839
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,700
and film themselves walking around in public

840
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,580
asking people if they think the Earth is flat

841
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,900
in a Buffalo Wild Wings parking lot

842
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,460
and yelling at people at a bar.

843
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,380
You're saying that he dips his nose down,

844
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,220
but you don't know how?

845
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,740
You just... He dips his...

846
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,340
You see there? I tried to have a conversation

847
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,580
and, of course, they don't like it

848
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,540
because they start losing the argument

849
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,420
because they can't make any real points.

850
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,460
Ah, my favorite kind of reasonable debate.

851
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,780
The kind where you walk up to someone in public with a camera

852
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,820
and demand they debunk flat Earth.

853
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,860
He seems to be following the Ben Shapiro strategy of making videos

854
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,140
where you give it a title like,

855
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:27,380
oh, I kick their asses with my smart boy brain

856
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,580
and then you actually watch it

857
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,060
and it's them making complete ass of themselves.

858
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,340
Thank you very much. Have a great night.

859
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,300
You're disturbing, I guess.

860
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,180
Okay, bye.

861
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,660
It's going up online!

862
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,180
26,000 subscribers!

863
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,940
You think you can destroy me?

864
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,100
Well, I'll have you know...

865
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,900
Fucking Jesus Christ.

866
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,460
Anyway, I think this was a productive day.

867
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,300
-♪ I think... ♪ -♪ I think... ♪

868
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,420
-♪ I think... ♪ -♪ I think... ♪

869
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,940
Oh, God, in this one video, he's got a Lula Lander shirt on.

870
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:59,660
He's made Lunar Module or Homeless Tweakers shelter

871
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,300
and he's going around filming random people on their day off

872
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:06,700
from work or at work asking them if they think the Earth is flat

873
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,180
and they keep awkwardly nodding and saying he's right

874
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,540
in the hopes he'll go away.

875
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,860
Have you ever seen the Earth curving?

876
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,660
No.

877
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,780
Me neither.

878
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,660
You know why?

879
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,780
It's because the Earth is flat and it doesn't spin.

880
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,580
Look into it.

881
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,860
When you get home, go on YouTube and check out the flat Earth.

882
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,820
Uh, not Spielberg.

883
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,500
They say it was, uh, Stanley Kubrick.

884
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,220
Okay.

885
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:26,700
Kubrick.

886
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,900
That was the rumor.

887
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,300
Whoever, whatever it was is Hollywood trickery.

888
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:35,420
It's so awkward and he's so sure he's owning people and looks smart.

889
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,620
I'm getting sympathy anxiety for the people he's talking to.

890
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,700
It's just, ah, no.

891
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,500
Stop it.

892
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,180
Well, let me ask you this.

893
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,140
Oh, God.

894
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,900
Do you think that looks more like a Lunar Module

895
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,780
or a Homeless Tweaker shelter if you had to pick one?

896
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,140
Is this really happening?

897
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,580
Just if you had to pick one.

898
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:56,300
Why did he choose such an unwieldy quote to use on the shirt he designed

899
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,180
and then was going to say a lot in a video?

900
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,500
Why is this his opening to his compass?

901
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,300
It's such a terrible shirt.

902
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:04,860
Why did he?

903
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,060
So I'm wearing a shirt now.

904
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:10,940
I recreated it to try and understand what's, what the deal is, what it's going on here.

905
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,940
And frankly, I still don't get it.

906
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,300
It was a complete waste of time.

907
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,220
Um, if I ever open a merch store and you see this shirt on it,

908
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,260
uh, it's the one shirt that I made of these.

909
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,620
So, um, I'll sign it or something if you want.

910
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,300
Please do not wear it in public, though.

911
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,380
No one will want to be your friend.

912
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,100
So, yeah, we probably should at least acknowledge it.

913
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,180
Some of these people believe there's a global,

914
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:38,940
flattled conspiracy to control the world and eat everyone's minds.

915
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,460
Some of them are misogynists and some of them are really racist.

916
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,660
It could be one of these, uh, bloodlines in this sort of elite.

917
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,900
Oh, it's the Rothschilds, is it?

918
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,400
Oh, okay.

919
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:49,980
That's normal.

920
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,020
And some of them are vegan neo-Nazi rappers.

921
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:57,420
But I'm sure every movement has its share of problematic people

922
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,140
who embarrass everyone else and who they wish would go away.

923
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,340
I can't think of any left-wing YouTubers who are like that.

924
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,380
Oh, it's me, isn't it?

925
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:08,620
Dispensing with the really sort of weird elements of the movement,

926
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,780
the question still remains,

927
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,660
why do people think the Earth is flat if the evidence is so bad?

928
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:19,180
Frankly, I'm not very good at figuring out why other people do things.

929
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,940
I just do what Sobek commands me,

930
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,500
and in return, he ensures that my harvest is bountiful

931
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,100
and my sperm is never-ending.

932
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,780
So we're gonna have to turn to an outside source

933
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,580
to do all of this deep-thinking stuff.

934
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,740
Let's find out what popular talkie-thinkie man

935
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,380
Philo-Sophie Tube has to say for himself, shall we?

936
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:45,820
Hey, Ollie.

937
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,780
I was just wondering,

938
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,580
what do philosophers think of people who think the Earth is fl-

939
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,460
I'll just reference the video you made a year ago.

940
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,580
It's fine.

941
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:13,580
Mr. Mark Sargent.

942
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:21,500
For the rest of the scientific community,

943
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,100
I come bearing a message.

944
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,580
I like science.

945
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,620
I always have.

946
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,620
I flew here on the back of science.

947
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,820
Oh, you flew here, did you?

948
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,900
I wonder what model of the Earth the pilot you-

949
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,400
No.

950
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,140
Don't be mean.

951
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:34,780
Don't-

952
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,580
Sorry.

953
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,660
I promised myself I wouldn't be rude to these people.

954
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:39,580
Stop it.

955
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:39,980
Carry on.

956
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,380
Stop it.

957
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,020
You've taken what should have been simple observations

958
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,100
and twisted them to suit your needs

959
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,300
and make us feel small.

960
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,260
We're not small and we're not an accident.

961
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,380
In fact, we are the new scientists.

962
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,260
No, Mark, don't say that.

963
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,300
I promised I wouldn't-

964
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,180
You can't-

965
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:55,900
Oh, fuck!

966
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,460
There's a new science in town, baby,

967
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,260
and an inordinate amount of it is based on

968
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,340
what logo the UN uses.

969
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,740
Okay, so I deliberately avoided bringing up Mark Sargent's videos too much

970
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,940
because they're not very good.

971
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,700
I don't want to make Flat Earthers just look bad

972
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,340
by pointing out how absolutely ridiculous

973
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,260
the videos that got them into it are,

974
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,180
and I just don't want to be mean to someone

975
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,340
just because they're ignorant and wrong.

976
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,140
But you know what?

977
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:22,620
Fuck him.

978
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,780
It's 8.50 p.m. on Christmas Eve.

979
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,060
He just said he's the new fucking science.

980
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,820
This is my present to myself.

981
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,860
I'm gonna fucking dunk on Mark Sargent for being obviously wrong.

982
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,180
You know that whole logistics thing I pointed out earlier?

983
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,100
Here's how he brings it up and debunks it.

984
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,620
Now, this is where you come in and say,

985
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,260
well, it's probably an isolated incident

986
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,820
or some strange connection thing.

987
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,180
You know how the airlines are.

988
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,580
Oh, no, my friends.

989
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,080
No.

990
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,660
Mark Sargent's video doesn't even acknowledge

991
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,580
the existence of non-stop flights.

992
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,260
In fact, he says they don't exist.

993
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,860
The first part of the clue is the utter lack of non-stop flights

994
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,700
from anywhere in this hemisphere.

995
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,300
Flying from international cities like Sydney, Rio, Santiago,

996
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,540
or anywhere else close by,

997
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,740
you can't get a single non-stop flight

998
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,740
no matter how much money you pay.

999
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,900
So now it becomes clear why so much of Flat Earth

1000
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,660
is pointless fluff or speculation

1001
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,340
about all the people who must be in on it.

1002
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,140
They have to avoid making quantifiable claims

1003
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,980
because otherwise, when you put it in terms

1004
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,660
that can be proven or disproven,

1005
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,260
there's a chance your actual reasons

1006
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,460
for believing what you believe

1007
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,860
can be openly demonstrated to be wrong.

1008
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,140
The Earth can't be a globe

1009
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,580
because there's no non-stop flights

1010
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,340
across countries in the Southern Hemisphere.

1011
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,700
Oh, wait, someone Googled it

1012
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,060
and it turns out there are?

1013
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,420
Fucking oops!

1014
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,420
I meant to say a bunch of weird waffle

1015
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,580
about how we don't really know what gravity is,

1016
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,900
so let's ramble about that instead.

1017
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,940
What is gravity?

1018
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,340
My worldview feels so much more safe

1019
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,140
when I'm talking absolute fucking nonsense.

1020
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,980
Has everyone seen The Truman Show?

1021
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,180
Oh, and while we're at it, Mark,

1022
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,060
it's not cute that you fucking hold your microphone

1023
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,980
on all of your podcasts like this.

1024
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,340
It makes for terrible audio.

1025
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,260
We can hear you fumbling with it constantly.

1026
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,620
Just put it on a stand.

1027
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,860
The person you've been streaming with

1028
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,020
for, like, years has a stand.

1029
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,700
Why have you not copied her thing?

1030
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,900
Just use a stand.

1031
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,780
Also, it's very clear you were wearing a clip-on mic

1032
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,460
when you came out to do this speech,

1033
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,740
and I guess you fucked it up

1034
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,180
because the audio didn't work.

1035
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,980
Okay, just pick up.

1036
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,860
I'll do this just in case.

1037
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,860
So you decided you had to use the onboard mics

1038
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,540
and then you weren't even using them right,

1039
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,980
so a guy had to come and correct you.

1040
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,300
Oh, we're gonna do both.

1041
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:32,860
Sorry about that.

1042
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,660
Why do you have so many problems with microphones?

1043
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,980
If you just Googled how to do sound,

1044
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:41,100
your videos would have been, like, 30% more bearable.

1045
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,060
Whose video was that with the moon and the clouds?

1046
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,900
Yeah, and I don't even think that was the moon.

1047
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,100
That looked like the sun.

1048
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,600
Was it?

1049
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,120
Just...

1050
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,660
Why are you so bad at everything, Mark?

1051
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,140
You don't...

1052
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,820
You're not even a good flat-earther.

1053
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,100
I have to talk around you

1054
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,700
or it makes me look like I'm trying to make you people look stupid.

1055
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,260
And do you think you're the fucking scientist?

1056
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,780
Fucking Jesus Christ!

1057
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,340
I think what really gets me...

1058
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,140
...

1059
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,020
In his video,

1060
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,420
Flat Earth or Why Do People Reject Science,

1061
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,260
philosopher Oliver Thorne says that

1062
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,820
flat-earthers don't actually reject science.

1063
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,420
See, he's being very clever with his title.

1064
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,140
It's a clever boy.

1065
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,020
Check his videos out.

1066
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,620
But they're actually embracing an alternative viewpoint on science

1067
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:27,100
which he compares to direct realism.

1068
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,060
He's right.

1069
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,860
These people are...

1070
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,660
...attempting a form of science.

1071
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:35,900
And I think that's what really gets to me about them.

1072
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,740
Not simply that they're pretending they're scientists

1073
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,900
who've secretly found the truth.

1074
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,220
Those people are a fucking dime a dozen.

1075
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,140
Saying that science is good and you know it

1076
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,780
and you're the genius and everyone else is wrong

1077
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,940
is basically what being a YouTuber is.

1078
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:55,020
People like Mark are right to want to question authorities on issues.

1079
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,420
They're right to want to question everything they know about reality

1080
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,780
and the society they live in.

1081
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,700
And that's because at the centre of flat Earth,

1082
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,500
not the North Pole,

1083
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,260
the actual centre of the ideology,

1084
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:09,900
its core is a tiny shining fragment of a systemic critique.

1085
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,900
It's the beginnings of trying to understand

1086
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,620
what's wrong with our society and what to do about it.

1087
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,340
You know, flat Earthers and people like them

1088
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,340
who embrace alternative solutions,

1089
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,340
like eating raw meat.

1090
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:29,180
In fact, Jake the Asshole, flat Earth boy,

1091
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,460
yell at people, man,

1092
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,540
eats raw meat a bunch.

1093
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,180
It's disgusting.

1094
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,180
I almost threw up watching one of his videos.

1095
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:39,100
People seek these solutions because they perceive,

1096
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,380
on some level, a problem.

1097
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,500
And they're right.

1098
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,860
Something is wrong with the world right now.

1099
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,100
The world is figuratively on fire.

1100
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,940
World leaders are asleep at the wheel.

1101
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:54,300
There's nothing in place to prevent another massive financial crash

1102
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,980
which will destroy thousands, if not millions, of livelihoods.

1103
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,220
And ecologically speaking, on top of being, you know,

1104
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,780
figuratively on fire, the Earth is literally on fire.

1105
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,460
Wildfires are getting worse.

1106
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,540
Temperatures are shifting all over the place.

1107
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,540
Ice is melting at an astounding rate.

1108
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:14,300
Even on a globe Earth, the edge is coming fast.

1109
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:18,540
So I can't blame anyone for feeling alienated and lonely

1110
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:21,740
about living in, you know, late capitalist society.

1111
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:25,100
You know, at least under feudalism, we had job security.

1112
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,820
So, of course, people are going to try and find something

1113
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:31,580
that helps them cope or seems like a solution.

1114
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,220
I mean, that's why you get cults.

1115
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,820
That's why you get Scientology.

1116
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,620
That's why you get Jordan Peterson supporters.

1117
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:42,620
You know, something is wrong, and we can all tell.

1118
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:47,420
And some people have arrived at a solution that doesn't really work

1119
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:50,220
or, at the very least, makes them feel a little bit better.

1120
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,980
Some people feel really good, like they're really owning the Marxists

1121
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,460
by not eating their vegetables until they get scurvy.

1122
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,380
And then that's where the problems begin, isn't it?

1123
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:04,220
Because believing these things isn't a solution,

1124
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:08,780
and it's not really accurate about what the problems are.

1125
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,020
The problem isn't NASA.

1126
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,540
The problem isn't the Earth being flat.

1127
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,540
The problem is something else.

1128
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:17,100
If you're a flat earther and you made it all the way to the end of this video,

1129
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,460
wow!

1130
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,820
This video was way too long,

1131
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:24,140
but I watched fucking dozens of hours of your documentaries,

1132
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,780
so I guess you owe me.

1133
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,540
But if I can give a little word of advice,

1134
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:35,500
you're right to feel that something is wrong.

1135
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,820
Because something is wrong.

1136
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,980
Just maybe keep looking for the source of what that thing is,

1137
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,220
because the Earth is not flat.

1138
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,860
The Earth is an oblate spheroid.

1139
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,300
I heard one guy say oblate once, and that was it.

1140
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,820
I just now say it every time.

1141
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,260
Just keep looking.

1142
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,460
Keep trying to figure out a solution.

1143
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:02,380
And maybe next Christmas, Mark Sargent will be Mark's Sargent.

1144
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,300
It's a good one.

1145
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,780
Oh, God, my hair looks awful.

1146
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,860
And see you all next year.

1147
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,460
I'm gonna do more videos next year, I promise.

1148
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,380
And I'm gonna do that charity stream soon.

1149
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:16,220
I'm gonna play Donkey Kong 64 all the way through until I fucking die.

1150
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,380
I'll raise money for a charity.

1151
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,780
I forgot which one it is, and I don't want to do another take

1152
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,220
because it's bloody freezing in here.

1153
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,340
I put this on for a reason.

1154
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:29,660
This used to light up, but it doesn't.

1155
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:00,780
Excuse me.

1156
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,700
Can moonlight make things cold?

1157
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:08,220
I feel like I'm actually being rude to a person by doing this.

1158
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,660
I'm really sorry.
