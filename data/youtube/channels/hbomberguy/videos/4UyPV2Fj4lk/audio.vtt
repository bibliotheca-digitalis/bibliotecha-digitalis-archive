00:00.000 --> 00:08.320
Are you worried about video game feminism, but also a fan of the works of Sierra?

00:08.320 --> 00:12.880
Fresh off the white-hot financial success of the landmark premiere nine people attended,

00:12.880 --> 00:14.880
Jordan Owen is at it again!

00:14.880 --> 00:18.000
For the low, low price of $60!

00:18.000 --> 00:22.880
You can help noted filmmaker and very happy man, Jordan Owen, make a documentary about

00:22.880 --> 00:25.120
the golden age of Sierra Online.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.840
Why Indiegogo and not Kickstarter, you ask?

00:27.840 --> 00:31.440
Because if the project doesn't make its goal, he can still keep all the money- I mean uh-

00:31.440 --> 00:36.160
You can tell Jordan's a professional because he put the macOS default screensaver on for

00:36.160 --> 00:37.160
extra effect.

00:37.160 --> 00:40.000
Come on, nudge the mouse, please nudge it.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.340
It's distracting, I can't just- NUDGE IT!

00:42.340 --> 00:43.340
AAAAHHHHH!

00:43.340 --> 00:44.760
The game creators themselves.

00:44.760 --> 00:45.840
Brand-

00:45.840 --> 00:46.840
Haha!

00:46.840 --> 00:52.200
That's a trick I remember from the Sarkisian Effect, the legendary editing technique known

00:52.200 --> 00:54.100
as the jump cut!

00:54.100 --> 01:13.860
What an amazing, professional crossfade right there.

01:13.860 --> 01:16.580
That must have taken at least two mouse clicks.

01:16.580 --> 01:17.700
That'll be six-

01:17.700 --> 01:18.700
Hahahaha!

01:18.700 --> 01:23.040
But just in case Jordan's insistence that he'll make a good documentary this time I

01:23.040 --> 01:27.320
promise didn't sell you, check out this awesome test footage he shot, featuring two

01:27.320 --> 01:31.120
and a half minutes or less of interview footage of a game developer at his house.

01:31.120 --> 01:35.720
This footage is honestly so much better looking than the Sarkisian Effect, it has crossfades

01:35.720 --> 01:41.560
and b-roll and the main interview subject is in focus, and most importantly, it isn't

01:41.560 --> 01:43.520
made by a racist magician.

01:43.520 --> 01:48.360
And this footage only cost $1,500 to make- wait, what?

01:48.360 --> 01:53.400
And I took out a personal loan with him that I will- for $1,500 that I'll be paying back

01:53.400 --> 01:54.400
with interest.

01:54.400 --> 01:58.800
He needed to take out a loan from someone, but bear with me here, there wasn't any money

01:58.800 --> 02:03.240
left over from the Sarkisian Effect's budget, at least after buying two MacBooks and a Mac

02:03.240 --> 02:05.880
Mini and a new camera to film his blogs with.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.480
Nine trillion yen!

02:07.480 --> 02:12.360
But wait, Corey Cole, creator of the Quest for Glory series, publicly refused to appear

02:12.360 --> 02:15.560
in the documentary after looking up Jordan's previous work online.

02:15.560 --> 02:18.520
TLDR, we will not appear in his film.

02:18.520 --> 02:23.480
In this documentary, he shows a complete lack of understanding of Sarkisian's work.

02:23.480 --> 02:24.800
That troglodyte.

02:24.800 --> 02:29.520
What sort of idiot judges people based on the things they've said and done in the past?

02:29.520 --> 02:31.080
Ugh, liberals.

02:31.080 --> 02:34.840
But Jordan's coverage of Sarkisian has always been above board, he's always focused on the

02:34.840 --> 02:35.840
important issues.

02:35.840 --> 02:39.800
They haven't said anything about it, but you might also notice that she's learned to smile

02:39.800 --> 02:41.680
like a white person.

02:41.680 --> 02:42.680
If you look at-

02:42.680 --> 02:43.680
Oh, that's a big wide mouth grin?

02:43.800 --> 02:45.800
Yeah, if you look at her genuine smile-

02:45.800 --> 02:46.800
Oh no, don't!

02:46.800 --> 02:47.800
Jordan, no!

02:47.800 --> 02:52.800
Okay, well, she's less genuine all the time, but if you look at, you know, when she's smiling-

02:52.800 --> 02:53.800
Like a white person.

02:53.800 --> 02:57.800
He says it like he owns a fucking plantation.

02:57.800 --> 03:04.800
They're, especially her upper lip follows a more ethnic sort of, there's a curvature

03:04.800 --> 03:06.800
to it where the outer-

03:06.800 --> 03:08.600
She's a wrong smiler!

03:08.600 --> 03:11.520
She doesn't smile like her race!

03:11.520 --> 03:12.520
She's a wrong smiler!

03:13.360 --> 03:16.360
I'll be $54,000, please!

03:16.360 --> 03:23.360
More indicative of how someone from that ethnic background might smile, whereas, and I'm not-

03:23.360 --> 03:25.360
Stop talking about-

03:28.360 --> 03:31.240
I wonder why he couldn't just talk with Jordan directly?

03:31.240 --> 03:34.040
He's famously excellent at responding to criticism.

03:34.040 --> 03:38.340
But if you have a problem with any aspect of the production, fuck you.

03:38.340 --> 03:40.840
I don't care if you donated $10,000.

03:41.160 --> 03:44.160
I don't care if you donated $10,000,000.

03:44.160 --> 03:48.160
I don't care if you donated bone marrow.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.160
Fuck you.

03:49.160 --> 03:53.160
And besides, the music's actually alright, considering that Jordan Owen only knows how

03:53.160 --> 03:58.160
to play one instrument, as far as I can tell, and that instrument is the world's tiniest

03:58.160 --> 03:59.160
violin.

03:59.160 --> 04:00.160
Do you get it?

04:00.160 --> 04:01.160
It's a tiny violin.

04:01.160 --> 04:03.160
I bought this for this joke.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.160
Are you happy?

04:04.160 --> 04:07.160
I'm funny.

04:07.160 --> 04:09.160
I'm funny.

04:09.480 --> 04:12.480
What could be off-putting about this hour-long video?

04:12.480 --> 04:17.480
And look how cordial he was when he thought he'd caught Ada Sarkeesian lying about something.

04:22.480 --> 04:26.480
I have a hard time wondering why the Coles wouldn't want to associate with Jordan.

04:26.480 --> 04:30.480
It couldn't possibly be because of the things he writes and says and does.

04:30.480 --> 04:35.480
But don't worry, I'm sure Jordan will plow on regardless and use a portion of the $20,000

04:35.800 --> 04:39.800
he would have spent travelling to interview them to improve the quality elsewhere or research

04:39.800 --> 04:41.800
the history in even more depth.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.800
That project has now been cancelled.

04:43.800 --> 04:44.800
Oh.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.800
Truly, this is a loss for the world of documentary cinema.

04:47.800 --> 04:48.800
I can't do it.

04:48.800 --> 04:49.800
I can't.

04:49.800 --> 04:50.800
I'm sorry.

04:50.800 --> 04:54.800
Even the title of this video is a deliberate lie for attention.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.800
Ken and Roberta Williams will not speak to me.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.800
The two guys from Andromeda will not speak to me.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.800
Jane Jensen will not speak to me.

05:00.800 --> 05:01.800
Jim Walls.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.800
Christy Marks.

05:03.800 --> 05:04.800
Nobody will speak to me.

05:05.120 --> 05:09.120
By, Sarkeesian fans killed my documentary, he means,

05:09.120 --> 05:13.120
the creators of the games I wanted to talk about don't like associating with

05:13.120 --> 05:18.120
mean-spirited ball bags who yell and scream at the top of their lungs at women on the internet.

05:18.120 --> 05:21.120
But to be fair, there probably wasn't enough space in the title, was there?

05:21.120 --> 05:23.120
Seven and a half more MacBooks!

05:23.120 --> 05:24.120
Let's play a game.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.120
I'm going to read you a quote real quick.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.120
It's not a question of who's going to let me.

05:28.120 --> 05:31.120
It's a question of who's going to stop me.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.120
No, that's not a quote from Skeletor.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.440
It's from Jordan Owen's personal overlord, Ayn Rand.

05:35.440 --> 05:37.440
Jordan loves to pull out his Rand,

05:37.440 --> 05:38.440
if you know what I'm saying,

05:38.440 --> 05:41.440
at a moment's notice and quote her word verbatim to prove a point,

05:41.440 --> 05:45.440
because the argument from authority is totally not fallacious in the slightest.

05:45.440 --> 05:48.440
But apparently when Jordan read this part, he misread it as,

05:48.440 --> 05:52.440
if someone criticizes your actions, give up and whine about people stopping you.

05:52.440 --> 05:57.440
If Jordan can't even be trusted to understand the views of the one person he claims to admire the most,

05:57.440 --> 06:00.440
what does that say about his take on the people he doesn't like?

06:00.760 --> 06:03.760
You know that she says context is completely irrelevant,

06:03.760 --> 06:05.760
and that if you use the...

06:05.760 --> 06:06.760
the...

06:06.760 --> 06:09.760
if you use the tropes at all, it's bad.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.760
And that's just a very shallow interpretation, er...

06:14.760 --> 06:16.760
Did you just have a moment of self-awareness?

06:16.760 --> 06:19.760
You're right, it is a shallow interpretation of what she said.

06:19.760 --> 06:20.760
You're right!

06:20.760 --> 06:22.760
A comical amount of money.

06:22.760 --> 06:29.760
I had now acquired the ability to make a professional-looking quality documentary film.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.080
What I have been working on...

06:34.080 --> 06:36.080
for six months now.

06:36.080 --> 06:39.080
That Al Lowe interview took six months?

06:39.080 --> 06:42.080
There's a lot of great moments of silent reflection in this video,

06:42.080 --> 06:44.080
where he just sort of doesn't say anything for a while,

06:44.080 --> 06:48.080
and looks like he's about to realize something about himself.

06:48.080 --> 06:51.080
People saw the things I said and wrote on the internet,

06:51.080 --> 06:54.080
and now they don't want to work with me, and this is everybody's fault but mine!

06:54.080 --> 06:57.080
It's like having Walt Disney call you an asshole.

06:57.400 --> 07:01.400
Now, personally, if Walt Disney noted racist and fan of Hitler called me an asshole,

07:01.400 --> 07:03.400
I would think of that as a compliment,

07:03.400 --> 07:05.400
but I didn't willingly work with Davis Aurini,

07:05.400 --> 07:07.400
so whatever floats your boat, I guess.

07:07.400 --> 07:12.400
Instead, Jordan Owen's decided to try and court mainstream success by opening a Patreon.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.400
Get me up to $100 per video on at Patreon,

07:15.400 --> 07:18.400
so I can hashtag game review, hashtag StarFoxZero,

07:18.400 --> 07:21.400
patreon.com slash JordanOwen42,

07:21.400 --> 07:24.400
hashtag crowdfunding, hashtag game...

07:24.720 --> 07:26.720
Bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh.

07:26.720 --> 07:28.720
Every video that you see,

07:29.720 --> 07:32.720
for me, constitutes at least a day's worth of work.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.720
At least a day's worth of work?

07:34.720 --> 07:37.720
It took a day to film yourself talking to a camera for 20 minutes?

07:37.720 --> 07:39.720
Do you live in a black hole?

07:39.720 --> 07:41.720
Do you experience time dilation?

07:41.720 --> 07:43.720
This isn't real! How is it?

07:43.720 --> 07:48.720
Uh, so far, I've made about $2,000 in sales of the Sarkeesian effect.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.720
Laugh it up if you want.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.720
Uh, no, I don't think I will, thank you.

07:54.040 --> 07:57.040
I don't need permission to laugh at you, fascist.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.040
Although, to be fair, it's pretty funny.

07:59.040 --> 08:04.040
Also, there's an additional personal reason, which is that I would like

08:04.040 --> 08:08.040
very much to spend, uh, Christmas with somebody.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.040
They know who they are.

08:10.040 --> 08:13.040
Don't worry, Jordan. We all know who that is.

08:13.040 --> 08:17.040
And I'll tell you right now, my favorite dancer at my favorite club is Molly at Tattletales.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.040
Go look her up, and you'll find out why.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.040
When a libertarian masturbates to completion,

08:21.360 --> 08:23.360
does that technically make their dick a fountainhead?

08:24.360 --> 08:25.360
Pfft.

08:25.360 --> 08:28.360
Don't worry, Jordan. I started taking Patreon seriously in December.

08:28.360 --> 08:30.360
And look where it got me!

08:35.360 --> 08:36.360
Oh.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.360
Speaking of money,

08:38.360 --> 08:42.360
noted mass murderer Anita Sarkeesian's company, Feminist Frequency,

08:42.360 --> 08:46.360
likes to feminist-frequently release PDF documents

08:46.360 --> 08:48.360
explaining what they did with all their money and their,

08:48.360 --> 08:50.360
the general state of their financials.

08:50.680 --> 08:54.680
They even have cute little pie charts and graphs showing you visually where all the money went.

08:54.680 --> 08:59.680
Uh, I'm yet to see J042 Productions release any kind of documentation

08:59.680 --> 09:03.680
about where $54,000-plus went making that film.

09:03.680 --> 09:04.680
Where did all the money go?

09:04.680 --> 09:07.680
We know from the Skype logs that Davis leaked

09:07.680 --> 09:11.680
that a good deal of the money went to moving Davis from Canada to Vegas

09:11.680 --> 09:14.680
and buying him and fixing him up a car so he could travel there.

09:14.680 --> 09:19.680
Um, but that still leaves out tens of thousands of dollars, hopefully.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
So where did all that money go?

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
I'm really interested, because it's certainly not on the screen.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Well, that about wraps it up for Jordan Owen 42.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
I wish him luck in his future endeavours,

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
complaining about how games are pushing a social justice agenda

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
by having a lesbian in them.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
And because everybody already knows my opinion of Dyke Mansion 3D.

09:39.000 --> 09:44.000
That's almost as salient as the part where he criticises the walk speed that you can change.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Thanks for, oh, shit.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Thanks for watching, everybody!

09:48.320 --> 09:49.320
I'll see you next time.

09:49.320 --> 09:53.320
Until then, I'm gonna spend all that lucrative YouTube Red ad money.

09:53.320 --> 09:55.320
How much did I make again?

09:57.320 --> 10:00.320
Oh, boy!

10:11.320 --> 10:14.320
This week I'd like to thank, oh, wow, there's a ton of people.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.320
I just made a joke about having no money

10:16.640 --> 10:18.640
and it's all these lovely people who've given me money.

10:19.640 --> 10:20.640
In alphabetical order,

10:20.640 --> 10:21.640
Amanda Beverley,

10:21.640 --> 10:22.640
Alexander Corbett,

10:22.640 --> 10:23.640
Ciaran Dachtler,

10:23.640 --> 10:25.640
Jason Walter, hello, you're new,

10:25.640 --> 10:26.640
Bob Leonard,

10:26.640 --> 10:27.640
Rob Brunt,

10:27.640 --> 10:31.640
Jenny Angel, who both likes my videos enough to give me money

10:31.640 --> 10:34.640
and deals with my shit posting on Something Awful,

10:34.640 --> 10:35.640
and Kevin M...

10:35.640 --> 10:36.640
M...

10:36.640 --> 10:37.640
M...

10:37.640 --> 10:38.640
Mckney...

10:38.640 --> 10:40.640
Oh, and Tyler J. as well.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.640
Thanks for watching!

10:41.640 --> 10:42.640
And until next time,

10:42.640 --> 10:45.960
remember to smile like your designated race is supposed to.
