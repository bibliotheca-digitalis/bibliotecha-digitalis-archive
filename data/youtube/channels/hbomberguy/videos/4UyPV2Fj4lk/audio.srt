1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
Are you worried about video game feminism, but also a fan of the works of Sierra?

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,880
Fresh off the white-hot financial success of the landmark premiere nine people attended,

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,880
Jordan Owen is at it again!

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,000
For the low, low price of $60!

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,880
You can help noted filmmaker and very happy man, Jordan Owen, make a documentary about

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,120
the golden age of Sierra Online.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,840
Why Indiegogo and not Kickstarter, you ask?

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,440
Because if the project doesn't make its goal, he can still keep all the money- I mean uh-

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,160
You can tell Jordan's a professional because he put the macOS default screensaver on for

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,160
extra effect.

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,000
Come on, nudge the mouse, please nudge it.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,340
It's distracting, I can't just- NUDGE IT!

13
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,340
AAAAHHHHH!

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,760
The game creators themselves.

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,840
Brand-

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,840
Haha!

17
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,200
That's a trick I remember from the Sarkisian Effect, the legendary editing technique known

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,100
as the jump cut!

19
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:13,860
What an amazing, professional crossfade right there.

20
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,580
That must have taken at least two mouse clicks.

21
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,700
That'll be six-

22
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,700
Hahahaha!

23
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,040
But just in case Jordan's insistence that he'll make a good documentary this time I

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,320
promise didn't sell you, check out this awesome test footage he shot, featuring two

25
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,120
and a half minutes or less of interview footage of a game developer at his house.

26
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,720
This footage is honestly so much better looking than the Sarkisian Effect, it has crossfades

27
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,560
and b-roll and the main interview subject is in focus, and most importantly, it isn't

28
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,520
made by a racist magician.

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,360
And this footage only cost $1,500 to make- wait, what?

30
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,400
And I took out a personal loan with him that I will- for $1,500 that I'll be paying back

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
with interest.

32
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,800
He needed to take out a loan from someone, but bear with me here, there wasn't any money

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,240
left over from the Sarkisian Effect's budget, at least after buying two MacBooks and a Mac

34
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,880
Mini and a new camera to film his blogs with.

35
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,480
Nine trillion yen!

36
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,360
But wait, Corey Cole, creator of the Quest for Glory series, publicly refused to appear

37
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,560
in the documentary after looking up Jordan's previous work online.

38
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,520
TLDR, we will not appear in his film.

39
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,480
In this documentary, he shows a complete lack of understanding of Sarkisian's work.

40
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,800
That troglodyte.

41
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,520
What sort of idiot judges people based on the things they've said and done in the past?

42
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,080
Ugh, liberals.

43
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,840
But Jordan's coverage of Sarkisian has always been above board, he's always focused on the

44
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,840
important issues.

45
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,800
They haven't said anything about it, but you might also notice that she's learned to smile

46
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,680
like a white person.

47
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,680
If you look at-

48
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,680
Oh, that's a big wide mouth grin?

49
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
Yeah, if you look at her genuine smile-

50
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
Oh no, don't!

51
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
Jordan, no!

52
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Okay, well, she's less genuine all the time, but if you look at, you know, when she's smiling-

53
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Like a white person.

54
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,800
He says it like he owns a fucking plantation.

55
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:04,800
They're, especially her upper lip follows a more ethnic sort of, there's a curvature

56
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
to it where the outer-

57
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,600
She's a wrong smiler!

58
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,520
She doesn't smile like her race!

59
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
She's a wrong smiler!

60
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,360
I'll be $54,000, please!

61
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:23,360
More indicative of how someone from that ethnic background might smile, whereas, and I'm not-

62
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
Stop talking about-

63
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,240
I wonder why he couldn't just talk with Jordan directly?

64
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,040
He's famously excellent at responding to criticism.

65
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,340
But if you have a problem with any aspect of the production, fuck you.

66
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,840
I don't care if you donated $10,000.

67
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,160
I don't care if you donated $10,000,000.

68
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,160
I don't care if you donated bone marrow.

69
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
Fuck you.

70
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,160
And besides, the music's actually alright, considering that Jordan Owen only knows how

71
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,160
to play one instrument, as far as I can tell, and that instrument is the world's tiniest

72
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,160
violin.

73
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,160
Do you get it?

74
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,160
It's a tiny violin.

75
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
I bought this for this joke.

76
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
Are you happy?

77
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,160
I'm funny.

78
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,160
I'm funny.

79
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,480
What could be off-putting about this hour-long video?

80
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,480
And look how cordial he was when he thought he'd caught Ada Sarkeesian lying about something.

81
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,480
I have a hard time wondering why the Coles wouldn't want to associate with Jordan.

82
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,480
It couldn't possibly be because of the things he writes and says and does.

83
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,480
But don't worry, I'm sure Jordan will plow on regardless and use a portion of the $20,000

84
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,800
he would have spent travelling to interview them to improve the quality elsewhere or research

85
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
the history in even more depth.

86
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
That project has now been cancelled.

87
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Oh.

88
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Truly, this is a loss for the world of documentary cinema.

89
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
I can't do it.

90
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
I can't.

91
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Even the title of this video is a deliberate lie for attention.

93
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Ken and Roberta Williams will not speak to me.

94
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
The two guys from Andromeda will not speak to me.

95
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Jane Jensen will not speak to me.

96
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Jim Walls.

97
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Christy Marks.

98
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Nobody will speak to me.

99
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,120
By, Sarkeesian fans killed my documentary, he means,

100
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,120
the creators of the games I wanted to talk about don't like associating with

101
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,120
mean-spirited ball bags who yell and scream at the top of their lungs at women on the internet.

102
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,120
But to be fair, there probably wasn't enough space in the title, was there?

103
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,120
Seven and a half more MacBooks!

104
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
Let's play a game.

105
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,120
I'm going to read you a quote real quick.

106
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,120
It's not a question of who's going to let me.

107
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,120
It's a question of who's going to stop me.

108
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,120
No, that's not a quote from Skeletor.

109
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,440
It's from Jordan Owen's personal overlord, Ayn Rand.

110
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,440
Jordan loves to pull out his Rand,

111
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,440
if you know what I'm saying,

112
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,440
at a moment's notice and quote her word verbatim to prove a point,

113
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,440
because the argument from authority is totally not fallacious in the slightest.

114
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,440
But apparently when Jordan read this part, he misread it as,

115
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,440
if someone criticizes your actions, give up and whine about people stopping you.

116
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,440
If Jordan can't even be trusted to understand the views of the one person he claims to admire the most,

117
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,440
what does that say about his take on the people he doesn't like?

118
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,760
You know that she says context is completely irrelevant,

119
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,760
and that if you use the...

120
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,760
the...

121
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,760
if you use the tropes at all, it's bad.

122
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,760
And that's just a very shallow interpretation, er...

123
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,760
Did you just have a moment of self-awareness?

124
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,760
You're right, it is a shallow interpretation of what she said.

125
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,760
You're right!

126
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,760
A comical amount of money.

127
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:29,760
I had now acquired the ability to make a professional-looking quality documentary film.

128
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,080
What I have been working on...

129
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
for six months now.

130
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,080
That Al Lowe interview took six months?

131
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,080
There's a lot of great moments of silent reflection in this video,

132
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,080
where he just sort of doesn't say anything for a while,

133
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,080
and looks like he's about to realize something about himself.

134
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,080
People saw the things I said and wrote on the internet,

135
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,080
and now they don't want to work with me, and this is everybody's fault but mine!

136
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,080
It's like having Walt Disney call you an asshole.

137
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,400
Now, personally, if Walt Disney noted racist and fan of Hitler called me an asshole,

138
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
I would think of that as a compliment,

139
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,400
but I didn't willingly work with Davis Aurini,

140
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,400
so whatever floats your boat, I guess.

141
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,400
Instead, Jordan Owen's decided to try and court mainstream success by opening a Patreon.

142
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Get me up to $100 per video on at Patreon,

143
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,400
so I can hashtag game review, hashtag StarFoxZero,

144
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,400
patreon.com slash JordanOwen42,

145
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,400
hashtag crowdfunding, hashtag game...

146
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh.

147
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Every video that you see,

148
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,720
for me, constitutes at least a day's worth of work.

149
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
At least a day's worth of work?

150
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,720
It took a day to film yourself talking to a camera for 20 minutes?

151
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,720
Do you live in a black hole?

152
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Do you experience time dilation?

153
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,720
This isn't real! How is it?

154
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,720
Uh, so far, I've made about $2,000 in sales of the Sarkeesian effect.

155
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,720
Laugh it up if you want.

156
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,720
Uh, no, I don't think I will, thank you.

157
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,040
I don't need permission to laugh at you, fascist.

158
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,040
Although, to be fair, it's pretty funny.

159
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Also, there's an additional personal reason, which is that I would like

160
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,040
very much to spend, uh, Christmas with somebody.

161
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
They know who they are.

162
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,040
Don't worry, Jordan. We all know who that is.

163
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,040
And I'll tell you right now, my favorite dancer at my favorite club is Molly at Tattletales.

164
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,040
Go look her up, and you'll find out why.

165
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,040
When a libertarian masturbates to completion,

166
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
does that technically make their dick a fountainhead?

167
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
Pfft.

168
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,360
Don't worry, Jordan. I started taking Patreon seriously in December.

169
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,360
And look where it got me!

170
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,360
Oh.

171
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Speaking of money,

172
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,360
noted mass murderer Anita Sarkeesian's company, Feminist Frequency,

173
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,360
likes to feminist-frequently release PDF documents

174
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,360
explaining what they did with all their money and their,

175
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,360
the general state of their financials.

176
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,680
They even have cute little pie charts and graphs showing you visually where all the money went.

177
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,680
Uh, I'm yet to see J042 Productions release any kind of documentation

178
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,680
about where $54,000-plus went making that film.

179
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
Where did all the money go?

180
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,680
We know from the Skype logs that Davis leaked

181
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,680
that a good deal of the money went to moving Davis from Canada to Vegas

182
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,680
and buying him and fixing him up a car so he could travel there.

183
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,680
Um, but that still leaves out tens of thousands of dollars, hopefully.

184
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So where did all that money go?

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm really interested, because it's certainly not on the screen.

186
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Well, that about wraps it up for Jordan Owen 42.

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I wish him luck in his future endeavours,

188
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
complaining about how games are pushing a social justice agenda

189
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
by having a lesbian in them.

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And because everybody already knows my opinion of Dyke Mansion 3D.

191
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's almost as salient as the part where he criticises the walk speed that you can change.

192
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Thanks for, oh, shit.

193
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Thanks for watching, everybody!

194
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
I'll see you next time.

195
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,320
Until then, I'm gonna spend all that lucrative YouTube Red ad money.

196
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,320
How much did I make again?

197
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,320
Oh, boy!

198
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,320
This week I'd like to thank, oh, wow, there's a ton of people.

199
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
I just made a joke about having no money

200
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,640
and it's all these lovely people who've given me money.

201
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
In alphabetical order,

202
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
Amanda Beverley,

203
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
Alexander Corbett,

204
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
Ciaran Dachtler,

205
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,640
Jason Walter, hello, you're new,

206
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,640
Bob Leonard,

207
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,640
Rob Brunt,

208
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,640
Jenny Angel, who both likes my videos enough to give me money

209
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,640
and deals with my shit posting on Something Awful,

210
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,640
and Kevin M...

211
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,640
M...

212
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,640
M...

213
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,640
Mckney...

214
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,640
Oh, and Tyler J. as well.

215
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
Thanks for watching!

216
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,640
And until next time,

217
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,960
remember to smile like your designated race is supposed to.
