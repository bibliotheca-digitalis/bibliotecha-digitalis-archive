0	8320	Are you worried about video game feminism, but also a fan of the works of Sierra?
8320	12880	Fresh off the white-hot financial success of the landmark premiere nine people attended,
12880	14880	Jordan Owen is at it again!
14880	18000	For the low, low price of $60!
18000	22880	You can help noted filmmaker and very happy man, Jordan Owen, make a documentary about
22880	25120	the golden age of Sierra Online.
25120	27840	Why Indiegogo and not Kickstarter, you ask?
27840	31440	Because if the project doesn't make its goal, he can still keep all the money- I mean uh-
31440	36160	You can tell Jordan's a professional because he put the macOS default screensaver on for
36160	37160	extra effect.
37160	40000	Come on, nudge the mouse, please nudge it.
40000	42340	It's distracting, I can't just- NUDGE IT!
42340	43340	AAAAHHHHH!
43340	44760	The game creators themselves.
44760	45840	Brand-
45840	46840	Haha!
46840	52200	That's a trick I remember from the Sarkisian Effect, the legendary editing technique known
52200	54100	as the jump cut!
54100	73860	What an amazing, professional crossfade right there.
73860	76580	That must have taken at least two mouse clicks.
76580	77700	That'll be six-
77700	78700	Hahahaha!
78700	83040	But just in case Jordan's insistence that he'll make a good documentary this time I
83040	87320	promise didn't sell you, check out this awesome test footage he shot, featuring two
87320	91120	and a half minutes or less of interview footage of a game developer at his house.
91120	95720	This footage is honestly so much better looking than the Sarkisian Effect, it has crossfades
95720	101560	and b-roll and the main interview subject is in focus, and most importantly, it isn't
101560	103520	made by a racist magician.
103520	108360	And this footage only cost $1,500 to make- wait, what?
108360	113400	And I took out a personal loan with him that I will- for $1,500 that I'll be paying back
113400	114400	with interest.
114400	118800	He needed to take out a loan from someone, but bear with me here, there wasn't any money
118800	123240	left over from the Sarkisian Effect's budget, at least after buying two MacBooks and a Mac
123240	125880	Mini and a new camera to film his blogs with.
125880	127480	Nine trillion yen!
127480	132360	But wait, Corey Cole, creator of the Quest for Glory series, publicly refused to appear
132360	135560	in the documentary after looking up Jordan's previous work online.
135560	138520	TLDR, we will not appear in his film.
138520	143480	In this documentary, he shows a complete lack of understanding of Sarkisian's work.
143480	144800	That troglodyte.
144800	149520	What sort of idiot judges people based on the things they've said and done in the past?
149520	151080	Ugh, liberals.
151080	154840	But Jordan's coverage of Sarkisian has always been above board, he's always focused on the
154840	155840	important issues.
155840	159800	They haven't said anything about it, but you might also notice that she's learned to smile
159800	161680	like a white person.
161680	162680	If you look at-
162680	163680	Oh, that's a big wide mouth grin?
163800	165800	Yeah, if you look at her genuine smile-
165800	166800	Oh no, don't!
166800	167800	Jordan, no!
167800	172800	Okay, well, she's less genuine all the time, but if you look at, you know, when she's smiling-
172800	173800	Like a white person.
173800	177800	He says it like he owns a fucking plantation.
177800	184800	They're, especially her upper lip follows a more ethnic sort of, there's a curvature
184800	186800	to it where the outer-
186800	188600	She's a wrong smiler!
188600	191520	She doesn't smile like her race!
191520	192520	She's a wrong smiler!
193360	196360	I'll be $54,000, please!
196360	203360	More indicative of how someone from that ethnic background might smile, whereas, and I'm not-
203360	205360	Stop talking about-
208360	211240	I wonder why he couldn't just talk with Jordan directly?
211240	214040	He's famously excellent at responding to criticism.
214040	218340	But if you have a problem with any aspect of the production, fuck you.
218340	220840	I don't care if you donated $10,000.
221160	224160	I don't care if you donated $10,000,000.
224160	228160	I don't care if you donated bone marrow.
228160	229160	Fuck you.
229160	233160	And besides, the music's actually alright, considering that Jordan Owen only knows how
233160	238160	to play one instrument, as far as I can tell, and that instrument is the world's tiniest
238160	239160	violin.
239160	240160	Do you get it?
240160	241160	It's a tiny violin.
241160	243160	I bought this for this joke.
243160	244160	Are you happy?
244160	247160	I'm funny.
247160	249160	I'm funny.
249480	252480	What could be off-putting about this hour-long video?
252480	257480	And look how cordial he was when he thought he'd caught Ada Sarkeesian lying about something.
262480	266480	I have a hard time wondering why the Coles wouldn't want to associate with Jordan.
266480	270480	It couldn't possibly be because of the things he writes and says and does.
270480	275480	But don't worry, I'm sure Jordan will plow on regardless and use a portion of the $20,000
275800	279800	he would have spent travelling to interview them to improve the quality elsewhere or research
279800	281800	the history in even more depth.
281800	283800	That project has now been cancelled.
283800	284800	Oh.
284800	287800	Truly, this is a loss for the world of documentary cinema.
287800	288800	I can't do it.
288800	289800	I can't.
289800	290800	I'm sorry.
290800	294800	Even the title of this video is a deliberate lie for attention.
294800	296800	Ken and Roberta Williams will not speak to me.
296800	298800	The two guys from Andromeda will not speak to me.
298800	300800	Jane Jensen will not speak to me.
300800	301800	Jim Walls.
301800	303800	Christy Marks.
303800	304800	Nobody will speak to me.
305120	309120	By, Sarkeesian fans killed my documentary, he means,
309120	313120	the creators of the games I wanted to talk about don't like associating with
313120	318120	mean-spirited ball bags who yell and scream at the top of their lungs at women on the internet.
318120	321120	But to be fair, there probably wasn't enough space in the title, was there?
321120	323120	Seven and a half more MacBooks!
323120	324120	Let's play a game.
324120	326120	I'm going to read you a quote real quick.
326120	328120	It's not a question of who's going to let me.
328120	331120	It's a question of who's going to stop me.
331120	333120	No, that's not a quote from Skeletor.
333440	335440	It's from Jordan Owen's personal overlord, Ayn Rand.
335440	337440	Jordan loves to pull out his Rand,
337440	338440	if you know what I'm saying,
338440	341440	at a moment's notice and quote her word verbatim to prove a point,
341440	345440	because the argument from authority is totally not fallacious in the slightest.
345440	348440	But apparently when Jordan read this part, he misread it as,
348440	352440	if someone criticizes your actions, give up and whine about people stopping you.
352440	357440	If Jordan can't even be trusted to understand the views of the one person he claims to admire the most,
357440	360440	what does that say about his take on the people he doesn't like?
360760	363760	You know that she says context is completely irrelevant,
363760	365760	and that if you use the...
365760	366760	the...
366760	369760	if you use the tropes at all, it's bad.
369760	372760	And that's just a very shallow interpretation, er...
374760	376760	Did you just have a moment of self-awareness?
376760	379760	You're right, it is a shallow interpretation of what she said.
379760	380760	You're right!
380760	382760	A comical amount of money.
382760	389760	I had now acquired the ability to make a professional-looking quality documentary film.
390080	392080	What I have been working on...
394080	396080	for six months now.
396080	399080	That Al Lowe interview took six months?
399080	402080	There's a lot of great moments of silent reflection in this video,
402080	404080	where he just sort of doesn't say anything for a while,
404080	408080	and looks like he's about to realize something about himself.
408080	411080	People saw the things I said and wrote on the internet,
411080	414080	and now they don't want to work with me, and this is everybody's fault but mine!
414080	417080	It's like having Walt Disney call you an asshole.
417400	421400	Now, personally, if Walt Disney noted racist and fan of Hitler called me an asshole,
421400	423400	I would think of that as a compliment,
423400	425400	but I didn't willingly work with Davis Aurini,
425400	427400	so whatever floats your boat, I guess.
427400	432400	Instead, Jordan Owen's decided to try and court mainstream success by opening a Patreon.
432400	435400	Get me up to $100 per video on at Patreon,
435400	438400	so I can hashtag game review, hashtag StarFoxZero,
438400	441400	patreon.com slash JordanOwen42,
441400	444400	hashtag crowdfunding, hashtag game...
444720	446720	Bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh.
446720	448720	Every video that you see,
449720	452720	for me, constitutes at least a day's worth of work.
452720	454720	At least a day's worth of work?
454720	457720	It took a day to film yourself talking to a camera for 20 minutes?
457720	459720	Do you live in a black hole?
459720	461720	Do you experience time dilation?
461720	463720	This isn't real! How is it?
463720	468720	Uh, so far, I've made about $2,000 in sales of the Sarkeesian effect.
469720	471720	Laugh it up if you want.
471720	473720	Uh, no, I don't think I will, thank you.
474040	477040	I don't need permission to laugh at you, fascist.
477040	479040	Although, to be fair, it's pretty funny.
479040	484040	Also, there's an additional personal reason, which is that I would like
484040	488040	very much to spend, uh, Christmas with somebody.
489040	490040	They know who they are.
490040	493040	Don't worry, Jordan. We all know who that is.
493040	497040	And I'll tell you right now, my favorite dancer at my favorite club is Molly at Tattletales.
497040	499040	Go look her up, and you'll find out why.
499040	501040	When a libertarian masturbates to completion,
501360	503360	does that technically make their dick a fountainhead?
504360	505360	Pfft.
505360	508360	Don't worry, Jordan. I started taking Patreon seriously in December.
508360	510360	And look where it got me!
515360	516360	Oh.
517360	518360	Speaking of money,
518360	522360	noted mass murderer Anita Sarkeesian's company, Feminist Frequency,
522360	526360	likes to feminist-frequently release PDF documents
526360	528360	explaining what they did with all their money and their,
528360	530360	the general state of their financials.
530680	534680	They even have cute little pie charts and graphs showing you visually where all the money went.
534680	539680	Uh, I'm yet to see J042 Productions release any kind of documentation
539680	543680	about where $54,000-plus went making that film.
543680	544680	Where did all the money go?
544680	547680	We know from the Skype logs that Davis leaked
547680	551680	that a good deal of the money went to moving Davis from Canada to Vegas
551680	554680	and buying him and fixing him up a car so he could travel there.
554680	559680	Um, but that still leaves out tens of thousands of dollars, hopefully.
560000	562000	So where did all that money go?
562000	565000	I'm really interested, because it's certainly not on the screen.
565000	567000	Well, that about wraps it up for Jordan Owen 42.
567000	569000	I wish him luck in his future endeavours,
569000	573000	complaining about how games are pushing a social justice agenda
573000	575000	by having a lesbian in them.
575000	579000	And because everybody already knows my opinion of Dyke Mansion 3D.
579000	584000	That's almost as salient as the part where he criticises the walk speed that you can change.
585000	586000	Thanks for, oh, shit.
586000	588000	Thanks for watching, everybody!
588320	589320	I'll see you next time.
589320	593320	Until then, I'm gonna spend all that lucrative YouTube Red ad money.
593320	595320	How much did I make again?
597320	600320	Oh, boy!
611320	614320	This week I'd like to thank, oh, wow, there's a ton of people.
614320	616320	I just made a joke about having no money
616640	618640	and it's all these lovely people who've given me money.
619640	620640	In alphabetical order,
620640	621640	Amanda Beverley,
621640	622640	Alexander Corbett,
622640	623640	Ciaran Dachtler,
623640	625640	Jason Walter, hello, you're new,
625640	626640	Bob Leonard,
626640	627640	Rob Brunt,
627640	631640	Jenny Angel, who both likes my videos enough to give me money
631640	634640	and deals with my shit posting on Something Awful,
634640	635640	and Kevin M...
635640	636640	M...
636640	637640	M...
637640	638640	Mckney...
638640	640640	Oh, and Tyler J. as well.
640640	641640	Thanks for watching!
641640	642640	And until next time,
642640	645960	remember to smile like your designated race is supposed to.
