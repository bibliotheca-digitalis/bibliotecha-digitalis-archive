1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
Hey guys, it's PEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,380
As I'm sure, haha, a lot of you are aware, I make millions of dollars making videos for the Internet.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,280
And the reason why you know this is because that's all the media has ever acknowledged me for.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,860
For some reason, they don't report on the inherent worth and value

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,720
of my Internet videos where I pretend to be scared by video games.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:25,300
In 2013, someone wrote an article about what it might mean that I'm the most popular thing on YouTube,

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,720
and because I'm a healthy person, based on that one article, I concluded that

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,420
the entire media hates me and also just the concept of Internet personalities.

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,820
I'm just one guy. There's no producer. There's no writer.

10
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,100
Please ignore the script I wrote for this video that you can fucking see in the reflection

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,020
the entire goddamn time and that I'm clearly reading from.

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,120
The media never comes to me for my side of the story, except all the times they do and I turn them down.

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,980
And I have no other platform in which to get my message across.

14
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,020
I want to address the biggest issue first, which would be the, uh,

15
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,280
guys holding up the sign... thing.

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,720
I'm saying it like that because it's much easier to take my side

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,040
when you forget that the sign said,

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,440
death to all Jews. I'm going to try not to mention that's what the sign said.

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,580
I'm just going to call it the sign thing from now on.

20
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,800
A lot of people really liked the video, and some people didn't.

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,480
You know, some people just think it's really funny when you write death to all Jews on a sign.

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,880
It's—it makes a really good point about how you shouldn't say it, but I said it.

23
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,760
It's funny.

24
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,900
But a lot of people think anti-Semitism is wrong, and it's bad to normalize hate speech

25
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,260
by turning it into a spectacle for fun and attention.

26
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:36,060
Uh, but, you know, both—maybe both sides have a bit of a point here, you know?

27
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,940
I'm very sorry for the words that I used.

28
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:44,580
I'm going to use the phrase, the words that I used, because, once again, I'm reticent to remind people that the words were

29
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,460
death to all Jews.

30
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,580
I admit that the joke went too far.

31
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,880
I believe that you can joke about anything, and that means that you definitely should,

32
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,160
especially if you're a gaming YouTuber with a large fanbase of tweens.

33
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:03,200
It turns out there's a right way and a wrong way to pay someone to call for the extermination of the entire Jewish people.

34
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,360
I found out one of the wrong ways this time. Maybe I'll get it right next time.

35
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,200
I admit that my joke was very easy to misinterpret, and how DARE the media misinterpret me!

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,800
They're trying to make me look bad by...

37
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,300
The list is huge! They've reported the things I said and did...

38
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,500
We can all agree that the people in this situation who fucked up are the journalists who watched the things that I made

39
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,180
and reported on the things that happened in them.

40
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,020
I hereby call upon my fans to boycott the Wall Street Journal.

41
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:38,140
Please, my core demographic, consider purchasing a different economics broadsheet in the future.

42
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:44,180
We need to stop the Wall Street Journal and all other forms of pitiful, hateful, bile-spewing clickbait.

43
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,640
Clickbait is awful.

44
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,400
Purposefully using a catchy, attention-getting headline so people read your work.

45
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,480
Wouldn't it be awful to live in a world that normalized people doing obnoxious, over-the-top things for attention so they could make money?

46
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,040
Wouldn't that be fucking terrible?! WOULDN'T IT?! WOULDN'T IT?! WOULDN'T IT?!

47
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:10,440
Just one, tiny, multiple slip-ups, and then all the media had to do was report on it, almost as if that's their job!

48
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:17,500
Now, you COULD say that a world where you can PAY poor people to do almost anything because they're desperate and need the money

49
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:23,500
has far deeper problems than the risks that will happen to a rich person if he actually pays people to do it.

50
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,660
And you COULD say that maybe we should take deadly seriously the actual fascists and Nazis emerging from the woodwork

51
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,020
to defend me and the concept of ironic racism.

52
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,860
But you're forgetting that NONE OF THAT AFFECTED ME!

53
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:43,480
Apart from the fact I'm fighting the realization that a LITERAL CHILD can do what I do, I was doing just fine! I'm fucking rich!

54
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,360
But not as rich as I could have been.

55
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,880
And that's the real problem, isn't it? I'd a—

56
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:58,880
I'd got my hair done well, and I'd learned to smile and wink and do the brofist, and I'd apologized for all the rape jokes.

57
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,280
I was ready to be the face of the Internet!

58
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:09,940
And then that clickbait, 39x Pulitzer Prize-winning journalism outlet SMEARED ME BY REPORTING THE THINGS I SAID!

59
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,780
Luckily, the real faces of free-thinking, rational media had my back.

60
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:21,940
If they hang out long enough on YouTube livestreams, they'll surely eventually crowdsource a solution to the problem of people thinking racism is wrong.

61
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:29,940
This incredibly intense overreaction to journalists reporting on things popular people say can't POSSIBLY backfire and make us look like tiny babies!

62
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,240
And what am I supposed to do about this slander? How am I supposed to defend my image?

63
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:44,240
All I have is more money than most people will ever fucking see, 53 million subscribers, and journalists asking me to give my side constantly, which I refuse to do!

64
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:51,040
I'm almost as downtrodden as those poor Indian people who were so desperate they were willing to write racial indecencies on a sign for $5.

65
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,640
But I know what the real oppression is here.

66
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,240
J.K. Rowling even called me a fascist!

67
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:03,740
Well, she didn't. She made a pithy comment about the proliferation of ironic fascism for the sake of edginess, but I don't need to read and pass the words properly!

68
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,640
WHO AM I, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL?!

69
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:14,140
Personally, I think THEY—that's right, THEY, all of the bad people—are the ones normalizing hatred, because I'm sure everyone hates me, AND I'M NOT PARANOID!

70
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,940
Instead of focusing on my show getting cancelled, why don't we focus on some real issues?

71
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,940
...

72
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,940
I'm not gonna say who those are, but hopefully it doesn't involve wondering why Nazis love my videos so much.

73
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,940
I'm still here, Wall Street Journal.

74
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:38,340
Wh—b—you tried to destroy me, but you failed, which is what you were trying to do, apparently.

75
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:46,940
I'd like to say a very special thanks to everyone in the YouTube community for coming out of the woodwork to vocally support me so people would click on their videos for money.

76
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,940
That's brofist.

77
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,440
Also, I'm really sorry about the rape jokes, okay? Can we please just forget about this and go back to loving me again?

78
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,940
♪

79
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,940
Alright, I recognize that this video might offend some people.

80
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:17,440
I recontextualized some of the stuff that Pew said, added a couple of things he didn't say, and, of course, I, uh, titled the video PewDiePie is a Nazi.

81
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,940
So, while I've got you here, I just thought I'd defend myself by saying it's just a joke.

82
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,440
You know, like those things PewDiePie does.

83
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:36,440
Uh, surely, in the name of freedom of speech and expression and being able to joke about anything, nothing's off-limits, surely I can jokingly say PewDiePie's a Nazi, right?

84
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:46,440
And while I'm being super obvious about what the point is of this video, I do think it's a little bit disingenuous for Felix to imply that, uh, the Wall Street Journal put Disney in a corner

85
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,440
and forced them to sever ties with them.

86
00:06:49,440 --> 00:07:00,440
Disney are a, you know, big company, they can make their own decisions in life, and they're also a little bit afraid of looking like anti-Semites because it's bad to do that.

87
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,440
And also they have a history of maybe making a couple of mistakes on that front and they kind of want to correct that.

88
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:13,440
No, I think Disney severed their ties with them because they saw what he was doing and thought about it using critical thinking.

89
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:21,440
If I recall, a similar thing happened with Levi's, where they saw that PewDiePie was making a bunch of rape jokes and they stopped wanting to advertise on his videos.

90
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,440
That's a business decision, that's not repression or censorship.

91
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,440
That's a company saying, hey, maybe we shouldn't advertise on this guy's page.

92
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,940
Maybe it makes us look bad. That's just a business decision.

93
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,440
Disney have something of a reputation to protect.

94
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,440
They make films that are usually for almost all ages.

95
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,440
I'm pretty sure at no point in a Star Wars film does a character pay someone to hold up a sign saying death to all Wookiees,

96
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:54,440
or at least if they do they turn out to be the bad guy, or in the midst of a massive nervous breakdown, in which case I am really sorry, Felix.

97
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:00,440
It's pretty clear from how the discussion is unfolding on YouTube that the real problem isn't some impending corporate monopoly.

98
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
Sorry, there's a train.

99
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,440
The actual monopoly is inherent in how the discussion is being had.

100
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:14,440
For example, look at the treatment Jacksepticeye, another gaming YouTuber, is getting for daring to say that he thinks maybe Felix got some things wrong.

101
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,440
Jack is a fan of Felix. The two have known each other for a very long time.

102
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,440
He very clearly looks up to him, and he makes some fairly light criticism, but the internet is calling him a backstabber.

103
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:30,440
Like, the most subscribed person on YouTube can't even be mildly criticized by someone who admits they look up to him,

104
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:36,440
without them being accused of backstabbing him and a massive shouting match emerging between their respective fanbases.

105
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,440
And from what I can gather, that's the real problem here.

106
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,440
Comedy on YouTube, as well as most forms of discussion, can't really develop beyond a fairly juvenile stage

107
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,440
because it's impossible to provide a nuanced critique without being regarded as a threat.

108
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:56,440
Suppose that attempts to defend freedom of speech have ended up being defenses of the most popular person's speech from other people's speech

109
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
because they're using it to criticize them.

110
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,440
In place of fighting for some actual freedom or some genuine discussion,

111
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:09,440
people are basically arguing for a pseudo-populism in which the most subscribed person has to be right because he has the most.

112
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,440
In the words of Keemstar, and I actually wrote this down when I saw it because it was ridiculous,

113
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:21,440
if we decided as a community that PewDiePie was wrong, then he would have a million dislikes, not a million likes.

114
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
He then goes on to say,

115
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,440
We have already decided that PewDiePie has done nothing wrong, that he is innocent.

116
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,440
Already decided he's innocent.

117
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,440
Because of likes.

118
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,440
I certainly hope it goes without saying at this point that the idea that a person can't be wrong

119
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,440
because a lot of people clicked a like button on their favorite gaming YouTuber

120
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,440
is a really bad idea for speech and discussion.

121
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,440
Freedom of speech is a very important thing, and it should be defended from people who seek to limit it.

122
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,440
For example, actual, literal fascists.

123
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,440
But who in this equation needs defending the most?

124
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,440
The guy with the most subscribers and the farthest reach on the fucking platform?

125
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Or the smaller people who actually dare to criticize him and are being treated like dog shit for it?

126
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,440
Somehow I think this video with a bunch of dumb jokes in it and a couple of bits of like criticism

127
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,440
where Jacksepticeye says he thinks Felix got some things wrong

128
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,440
are somehow more revolting than a video of someone paying people to hold up a sign saying death to all Jews.

129
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
Doesn't something seem wrong about that?

130
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,440
Just in case it wasn't obvious, no, I don't think Felix is actually a Nazi.

131
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,440
Which, admittedly, is a pretty low bar.

132
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,440
But then again, I have quite a lot of experience with Swedish fascists, so maybe I just know what they look like.

133
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,440
I didn't think the Wall Street Journal thought he was either, though. I've read their article.

134
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,440
They just pointed out that he relies on one joke too often,

135
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,440
and that's because when people criticize him for overusing jokes or relying on sloppy joke editing as a crutch,

136
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,440
people jump down the throat and call them a backstabber.

137
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,440
The structure of YouTube doesn't just hurt people who happen to not be as popular as PewDiePie and have different opinions.

138
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,440
It also is bad for PewDiePie, because his comedy can't evolve

139
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,440
because people can't criticize him without being called backstabbers, so they don't bother.

140
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,440
Unless we actually raise the discourse by treating everyone in the equation better,

141
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,440
especially the people who criticize PewDiePie and have less of an audience,

142
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,440
then we're going to keep encountering this same problem over and over again

143
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,440
because nothing will actually change.

144
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,440
Also, I really have to reiterate, I don't think Felix is a Nazi. Now I've said it, you can't sue me.

145
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,440
Thank you very much to all my patrons for helping to validate this dumb garbage that I make.

146
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,440
In addition to the names scrolling past the screen right now, I'd especially like to thank

147
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,440
