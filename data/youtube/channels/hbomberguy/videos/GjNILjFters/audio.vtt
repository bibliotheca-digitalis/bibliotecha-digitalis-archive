WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.760
Hey guys, it's PEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

00:02.760 --> 00:08.380
As I'm sure, haha, a lot of you are aware, I make millions of dollars making videos for the Internet.

00:08.380 --> 00:12.280
And the reason why you know this is because that's all the media has ever acknowledged me for.

00:12.280 --> 00:15.860
For some reason, they don't report on the inherent worth and value

00:15.860 --> 00:19.720
of my Internet videos where I pretend to be scared by video games.

00:19.720 --> 00:25.300
In 2013, someone wrote an article about what it might mean that I'm the most popular thing on YouTube,

00:25.300 --> 00:29.720
and because I'm a healthy person, based on that one article, I concluded that

00:29.780 --> 00:34.420
the entire media hates me and also just the concept of Internet personalities.

00:34.420 --> 00:37.820
I'm just one guy. There's no producer. There's no writer.

00:37.820 --> 00:42.100
Please ignore the script I wrote for this video that you can fucking see in the reflection

00:42.100 --> 00:45.020
the entire goddamn time and that I'm clearly reading from.

00:45.020 --> 00:50.120
The media never comes to me for my side of the story, except all the times they do and I turn them down.

00:50.120 --> 00:53.980
And I have no other platform in which to get my message across.

00:53.980 --> 00:57.020
I want to address the biggest issue first, which would be the, uh,

00:57.020 --> 00:59.280
guys holding up the sign... thing.

00:59.640 --> 01:02.720
I'm saying it like that because it's much easier to take my side

01:02.720 --> 01:05.040
when you forget that the sign said,

01:05.040 --> 01:08.440
death to all Jews. I'm going to try not to mention that's what the sign said.

01:08.440 --> 01:10.580
I'm just going to call it the sign thing from now on.

01:10.580 --> 01:13.800
A lot of people really liked the video, and some people didn't.

01:13.800 --> 01:17.480
You know, some people just think it's really funny when you write death to all Jews on a sign.

01:17.480 --> 01:21.880
It's—it makes a really good point about how you shouldn't say it, but I said it.

01:21.880 --> 01:22.760
It's funny.

01:22.780 --> 01:27.900
But a lot of people think anti-Semitism is wrong, and it's bad to normalize hate speech

01:27.900 --> 01:31.260
by turning it into a spectacle for fun and attention.

01:31.580 --> 01:36.060
Uh, but, you know, both—maybe both sides have a bit of a point here, you know?

01:36.060 --> 01:38.940
I'm very sorry for the words that I used.

01:38.940 --> 01:44.580
I'm going to use the phrase, the words that I used, because, once again, I'm reticent to remind people that the words were

01:44.580 --> 01:46.460
death to all Jews.

01:46.460 --> 01:48.580
I admit that the joke went too far.

01:48.580 --> 01:52.880
I believe that you can joke about anything, and that means that you definitely should,

01:52.880 --> 01:57.160
especially if you're a gaming YouTuber with a large fanbase of tweens.

01:57.160 --> 02:03.200
It turns out there's a right way and a wrong way to pay someone to call for the extermination of the entire Jewish people.

02:03.520 --> 02:07.360
I found out one of the wrong ways this time. Maybe I'll get it right next time.

02:07.360 --> 02:12.200
I admit that my joke was very easy to misinterpret, and how DARE the media misinterpret me!

02:12.200 --> 02:14.800
They're trying to make me look bad by...

02:15.540 --> 02:19.300
The list is huge! They've reported the things I said and did...

02:20.580 --> 02:26.500
We can all agree that the people in this situation who fucked up are the journalists who watched the things that I made

02:26.500 --> 02:29.180
and reported on the things that happened in them.

02:29.180 --> 02:33.020
I hereby call upon my fans to boycott the Wall Street Journal.

02:33.020 --> 02:38.140
Please, my core demographic, consider purchasing a different economics broadsheet in the future.

02:38.140 --> 02:44.180
We need to stop the Wall Street Journal and all other forms of pitiful, hateful, bile-spewing clickbait.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.640
Clickbait is awful.

02:45.640 --> 02:50.400
Purposefully using a catchy, attention-getting headline so people read your work.

02:50.400 --> 02:56.480
Wouldn't it be awful to live in a world that normalized people doing obnoxious, over-the-top things for attention so they could make money?

02:56.480 --> 03:00.040
Wouldn't that be fucking terrible?! WOULDN'T IT?! WOULDN'T IT?! WOULDN'T IT?!

03:00.040 --> 03:10.440
Just one, tiny, multiple slip-ups, and then all the media had to do was report on it, almost as if that's their job!

03:10.460 --> 03:17.500
Now, you COULD say that a world where you can PAY poor people to do almost anything because they're desperate and need the money

03:17.500 --> 03:23.500
has far deeper problems than the risks that will happen to a rich person if he actually pays people to do it.

03:23.500 --> 03:29.660
And you COULD say that maybe we should take deadly seriously the actual fascists and Nazis emerging from the woodwork

03:29.660 --> 03:33.020
to defend me and the concept of ironic racism.

03:33.020 --> 03:35.860
But you're forgetting that NONE OF THAT AFFECTED ME!

03:35.880 --> 03:43.480
Apart from the fact I'm fighting the realization that a LITERAL CHILD can do what I do, I was doing just fine! I'm fucking rich!

03:44.680 --> 03:46.360
But not as rich as I could have been.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.880
And that's the real problem, isn't it? I'd a—

03:51.280 --> 03:58.880
I'd got my hair done well, and I'd learned to smile and wink and do the brofist, and I'd apologized for all the rape jokes.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.280
I was ready to be the face of the Internet!

04:01.940 --> 04:09.940
And then that clickbait, 39x Pulitzer Prize-winning journalism outlet SMEARED ME BY REPORTING THE THINGS I SAID!

04:09.940 --> 04:13.780
Luckily, the real faces of free-thinking, rational media had my back.

04:13.780 --> 04:21.940
If they hang out long enough on YouTube livestreams, they'll surely eventually crowdsource a solution to the problem of people thinking racism is wrong.

04:21.940 --> 04:29.940
This incredibly intense overreaction to journalists reporting on things popular people say can't POSSIBLY backfire and make us look like tiny babies!

04:30.940 --> 04:35.240
And what am I supposed to do about this slander? How am I supposed to defend my image?

04:35.240 --> 04:44.240
All I have is more money than most people will ever fucking see, 53 million subscribers, and journalists asking me to give my side constantly, which I refuse to do!

04:44.240 --> 04:51.040
I'm almost as downtrodden as those poor Indian people who were so desperate they were willing to write racial indecencies on a sign for $5.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.640
But I know what the real oppression is here.

04:53.640 --> 04:56.240
J.K. Rowling even called me a fascist!

04:56.240 --> 05:03.740
Well, she didn't. She made a pithy comment about the proliferation of ironic fascism for the sake of edginess, but I don't need to read and pass the words properly!

05:03.740 --> 05:05.640
WHO AM I, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL?!

05:05.640 --> 05:14.140
Personally, I think THEY—that's right, THEY, all of the bad people—are the ones normalizing hatred, because I'm sure everyone hates me, AND I'M NOT PARANOID!

05:14.140 --> 05:17.940
Instead of focusing on my show getting cancelled, why don't we focus on some real issues?

05:18.440 --> 05:22.940
...

05:22.940 --> 05:27.940
I'm not gonna say who those are, but hopefully it doesn't involve wondering why Nazis love my videos so much.

05:27.940 --> 05:29.940
I'm still here, Wall Street Journal.

05:30.940 --> 05:38.340
Wh—b—you tried to destroy me, but you failed, which is what you were trying to do, apparently.

05:38.340 --> 05:46.940
I'd like to say a very special thanks to everyone in the YouTube community for coming out of the woodwork to vocally support me so people would click on their videos for money.

05:47.940 --> 05:48.940
That's brofist.

05:50.940 --> 05:55.440
Also, I'm really sorry about the rape jokes, okay? Can we please just forget about this and go back to loving me again?

05:55.440 --> 06:01.940
♪

06:05.940 --> 06:08.940
Alright, I recognize that this video might offend some people.

06:09.440 --> 06:17.440
I recontextualized some of the stuff that Pew said, added a couple of things he didn't say, and, of course, I, uh, titled the video PewDiePie is a Nazi.

06:17.440 --> 06:22.940
So, while I've got you here, I just thought I'd defend myself by saying it's just a joke.

06:23.440 --> 06:25.440
You know, like those things PewDiePie does.

06:25.940 --> 06:36.440
Uh, surely, in the name of freedom of speech and expression and being able to joke about anything, nothing's off-limits, surely I can jokingly say PewDiePie's a Nazi, right?

06:36.440 --> 06:46.440
And while I'm being super obvious about what the point is of this video, I do think it's a little bit disingenuous for Felix to imply that, uh, the Wall Street Journal put Disney in a corner

06:46.440 --> 06:49.440
and forced them to sever ties with them.

06:49.440 --> 07:00.440
Disney are a, you know, big company, they can make their own decisions in life, and they're also a little bit afraid of looking like anti-Semites because it's bad to do that.

07:00.440 --> 07:05.440
And also they have a history of maybe making a couple of mistakes on that front and they kind of want to correct that.

07:05.940 --> 07:13.440
No, I think Disney severed their ties with them because they saw what he was doing and thought about it using critical thinking.

07:13.440 --> 07:21.440
If I recall, a similar thing happened with Levi's, where they saw that PewDiePie was making a bunch of rape jokes and they stopped wanting to advertise on his videos.

07:21.440 --> 07:25.440
That's a business decision, that's not repression or censorship.

07:25.440 --> 07:30.440
That's a company saying, hey, maybe we shouldn't advertise on this guy's page.

07:30.940 --> 07:33.940
Maybe it makes us look bad. That's just a business decision.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.440
Disney have something of a reputation to protect.

07:36.440 --> 07:39.440
They make films that are usually for almost all ages.

07:40.440 --> 07:46.440
I'm pretty sure at no point in a Star Wars film does a character pay someone to hold up a sign saying death to all Wookiees,

07:46.440 --> 07:54.440
or at least if they do they turn out to be the bad guy, or in the midst of a massive nervous breakdown, in which case I am really sorry, Felix.

07:54.440 --> 08:00.440
It's pretty clear from how the discussion is unfolding on YouTube that the real problem isn't some impending corporate monopoly.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.440
Sorry, there's a train.

08:03.440 --> 08:06.440
The actual monopoly is inherent in how the discussion is being had.

08:07.440 --> 08:14.440
For example, look at the treatment Jacksepticeye, another gaming YouTuber, is getting for daring to say that he thinks maybe Felix got some things wrong.

08:14.440 --> 08:17.440
Jack is a fan of Felix. The two have known each other for a very long time.

08:17.440 --> 08:23.440
He very clearly looks up to him, and he makes some fairly light criticism, but the internet is calling him a backstabber.

08:23.440 --> 08:30.440
Like, the most subscribed person on YouTube can't even be mildly criticized by someone who admits they look up to him,

08:30.440 --> 08:36.440
without them being accused of backstabbing him and a massive shouting match emerging between their respective fanbases.

08:36.440 --> 08:39.440
And from what I can gather, that's the real problem here.

08:39.440 --> 08:44.440
Comedy on YouTube, as well as most forms of discussion, can't really develop beyond a fairly juvenile stage

08:44.440 --> 08:49.440
because it's impossible to provide a nuanced critique without being regarded as a threat.

08:49.440 --> 08:56.440
Suppose that attempts to defend freedom of speech have ended up being defenses of the most popular person's speech from other people's speech

08:56.440 --> 08:58.440
because they're using it to criticize them.

08:58.440 --> 09:02.440
In place of fighting for some actual freedom or some genuine discussion,

09:02.440 --> 09:09.440
people are basically arguing for a pseudo-populism in which the most subscribed person has to be right because he has the most.

09:09.440 --> 09:14.440
In the words of Keemstar, and I actually wrote this down when I saw it because it was ridiculous,

09:14.440 --> 09:21.440
if we decided as a community that PewDiePie was wrong, then he would have a million dislikes, not a million likes.

09:21.440 --> 09:22.440
He then goes on to say,

09:22.440 --> 09:27.440
We have already decided that PewDiePie has done nothing wrong, that he is innocent.

09:27.440 --> 09:30.440
Already decided he's innocent.

09:30.440 --> 09:32.440
Because of likes.

09:32.440 --> 09:36.440
I certainly hope it goes without saying at this point that the idea that a person can't be wrong

09:36.440 --> 09:40.440
because a lot of people clicked a like button on their favorite gaming YouTuber

09:40.440 --> 09:43.440
is a really bad idea for speech and discussion.

09:43.440 --> 09:48.440
Freedom of speech is a very important thing, and it should be defended from people who seek to limit it.

09:48.440 --> 09:51.440
For example, actual, literal fascists.

09:51.440 --> 09:53.440
But who in this equation needs defending the most?

09:53.440 --> 09:57.440
The guy with the most subscribers and the farthest reach on the fucking platform?

09:57.440 --> 10:03.440
Or the smaller people who actually dare to criticize him and are being treated like dog shit for it?

10:03.440 --> 10:07.440
Somehow I think this video with a bunch of dumb jokes in it and a couple of bits of like criticism

10:07.440 --> 10:11.440
where Jacksepticeye says he thinks Felix got some things wrong

10:11.440 --> 10:17.440
are somehow more revolting than a video of someone paying people to hold up a sign saying death to all Jews.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.440
Doesn't something seem wrong about that?

10:19.440 --> 10:23.440
Just in case it wasn't obvious, no, I don't think Felix is actually a Nazi.

10:23.440 --> 10:27.440
Which, admittedly, is a pretty low bar.

10:27.440 --> 10:32.440
But then again, I have quite a lot of experience with Swedish fascists, so maybe I just know what they look like.

10:32.440 --> 10:36.440
I didn't think the Wall Street Journal thought he was either, though. I've read their article.

10:36.440 --> 10:39.440
They just pointed out that he relies on one joke too often,

10:39.440 --> 10:45.440
and that's because when people criticize him for overusing jokes or relying on sloppy joke editing as a crutch,

10:45.440 --> 10:49.440
people jump down the throat and call them a backstabber.

10:49.440 --> 10:54.440
The structure of YouTube doesn't just hurt people who happen to not be as popular as PewDiePie and have different opinions.

10:54.440 --> 10:58.440
It also is bad for PewDiePie, because his comedy can't evolve

10:58.440 --> 11:02.440
because people can't criticize him without being called backstabbers, so they don't bother.

11:02.440 --> 11:06.440
Unless we actually raise the discourse by treating everyone in the equation better,

11:06.440 --> 11:10.440
especially the people who criticize PewDiePie and have less of an audience,

11:10.440 --> 11:14.440
then we're going to keep encountering this same problem over and over again

11:14.440 --> 11:16.440
because nothing will actually change.

11:16.440 --> 11:20.440
Also, I really have to reiterate, I don't think Felix is a Nazi. Now I've said it, you can't sue me.

11:25.440 --> 11:31.440
Thank you very much to all my patrons for helping to validate this dumb garbage that I make.

11:31.440 --> 11:35.440
