0	2760	Hey guys, it's PEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
2760	8380	As I'm sure, haha, a lot of you are aware, I make millions of dollars making videos for the Internet.
8380	12280	And the reason why you know this is because that's all the media has ever acknowledged me for.
12280	15860	For some reason, they don't report on the inherent worth and value
15860	19720	of my Internet videos where I pretend to be scared by video games.
19720	25300	In 2013, someone wrote an article about what it might mean that I'm the most popular thing on YouTube,
25300	29720	and because I'm a healthy person, based on that one article, I concluded that
29780	34420	the entire media hates me and also just the concept of Internet personalities.
34420	37820	I'm just one guy. There's no producer. There's no writer.
37820	42100	Please ignore the script I wrote for this video that you can fucking see in the reflection
42100	45020	the entire goddamn time and that I'm clearly reading from.
45020	50120	The media never comes to me for my side of the story, except all the times they do and I turn them down.
50120	53980	And I have no other platform in which to get my message across.
53980	57020	I want to address the biggest issue first, which would be the, uh,
57020	59280	guys holding up the sign... thing.
59640	62720	I'm saying it like that because it's much easier to take my side
62720	65040	when you forget that the sign said,
65040	68440	death to all Jews. I'm going to try not to mention that's what the sign said.
68440	70580	I'm just going to call it the sign thing from now on.
70580	73800	A lot of people really liked the video, and some people didn't.
73800	77480	You know, some people just think it's really funny when you write death to all Jews on a sign.
77480	81880	It's—it makes a really good point about how you shouldn't say it, but I said it.
81880	82760	It's funny.
82780	87900	But a lot of people think anti-Semitism is wrong, and it's bad to normalize hate speech
87900	91260	by turning it into a spectacle for fun and attention.
91580	96060	Uh, but, you know, both—maybe both sides have a bit of a point here, you know?
96060	98940	I'm very sorry for the words that I used.
98940	104580	I'm going to use the phrase, the words that I used, because, once again, I'm reticent to remind people that the words were
104580	106460	death to all Jews.
106460	108580	I admit that the joke went too far.
108580	112880	I believe that you can joke about anything, and that means that you definitely should,
112880	117160	especially if you're a gaming YouTuber with a large fanbase of tweens.
117160	123200	It turns out there's a right way and a wrong way to pay someone to call for the extermination of the entire Jewish people.
123520	127360	I found out one of the wrong ways this time. Maybe I'll get it right next time.
127360	132200	I admit that my joke was very easy to misinterpret, and how DARE the media misinterpret me!
132200	134800	They're trying to make me look bad by...
135540	139300	The list is huge! They've reported the things I said and did...
140580	146500	We can all agree that the people in this situation who fucked up are the journalists who watched the things that I made
146500	149180	and reported on the things that happened in them.
149180	153020	I hereby call upon my fans to boycott the Wall Street Journal.
153020	158140	Please, my core demographic, consider purchasing a different economics broadsheet in the future.
158140	164180	We need to stop the Wall Street Journal and all other forms of pitiful, hateful, bile-spewing clickbait.
164200	165640	Clickbait is awful.
165640	170400	Purposefully using a catchy, attention-getting headline so people read your work.
170400	176480	Wouldn't it be awful to live in a world that normalized people doing obnoxious, over-the-top things for attention so they could make money?
176480	180040	Wouldn't that be fucking terrible?! WOULDN'T IT?! WOULDN'T IT?! WOULDN'T IT?!
180040	190440	Just one, tiny, multiple slip-ups, and then all the media had to do was report on it, almost as if that's their job!
190460	197500	Now, you COULD say that a world where you can PAY poor people to do almost anything because they're desperate and need the money
197500	203500	has far deeper problems than the risks that will happen to a rich person if he actually pays people to do it.
203500	209660	And you COULD say that maybe we should take deadly seriously the actual fascists and Nazis emerging from the woodwork
209660	213020	to defend me and the concept of ironic racism.
213020	215860	But you're forgetting that NONE OF THAT AFFECTED ME!
215880	223480	Apart from the fact I'm fighting the realization that a LITERAL CHILD can do what I do, I was doing just fine! I'm fucking rich!
224680	226360	But not as rich as I could have been.
228720	230880	And that's the real problem, isn't it? I'd a—
231280	238880	I'd got my hair done well, and I'd learned to smile and wink and do the brofist, and I'd apologized for all the rape jokes.
238880	241280	I was ready to be the face of the Internet!
241940	249940	And then that clickbait, 39x Pulitzer Prize-winning journalism outlet SMEARED ME BY REPORTING THE THINGS I SAID!
249940	253780	Luckily, the real faces of free-thinking, rational media had my back.
253780	261940	If they hang out long enough on YouTube livestreams, they'll surely eventually crowdsource a solution to the problem of people thinking racism is wrong.
261940	269940	This incredibly intense overreaction to journalists reporting on things popular people say can't POSSIBLY backfire and make us look like tiny babies!
270940	275240	And what am I supposed to do about this slander? How am I supposed to defend my image?
275240	284240	All I have is more money than most people will ever fucking see, 53 million subscribers, and journalists asking me to give my side constantly, which I refuse to do!
284240	291040	I'm almost as downtrodden as those poor Indian people who were so desperate they were willing to write racial indecencies on a sign for $5.
291040	293640	But I know what the real oppression is here.
293640	296240	J.K. Rowling even called me a fascist!
296240	303740	Well, she didn't. She made a pithy comment about the proliferation of ironic fascism for the sake of edginess, but I don't need to read and pass the words properly!
303740	305640	WHO AM I, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL?!
305640	314140	Personally, I think THEY—that's right, THEY, all of the bad people—are the ones normalizing hatred, because I'm sure everyone hates me, AND I'M NOT PARANOID!
314140	317940	Instead of focusing on my show getting cancelled, why don't we focus on some real issues?
318440	322940	...
322940	327940	I'm not gonna say who those are, but hopefully it doesn't involve wondering why Nazis love my videos so much.
327940	329940	I'm still here, Wall Street Journal.
330940	338340	Wh—b—you tried to destroy me, but you failed, which is what you were trying to do, apparently.
338340	346940	I'd like to say a very special thanks to everyone in the YouTube community for coming out of the woodwork to vocally support me so people would click on their videos for money.
347940	348940	That's brofist.
350940	355440	Also, I'm really sorry about the rape jokes, okay? Can we please just forget about this and go back to loving me again?
355440	361940	♪
365940	368940	Alright, I recognize that this video might offend some people.
369440	377440	I recontextualized some of the stuff that Pew said, added a couple of things he didn't say, and, of course, I, uh, titled the video PewDiePie is a Nazi.
377440	382940	So, while I've got you here, I just thought I'd defend myself by saying it's just a joke.
383440	385440	You know, like those things PewDiePie does.
385940	396440	Uh, surely, in the name of freedom of speech and expression and being able to joke about anything, nothing's off-limits, surely I can jokingly say PewDiePie's a Nazi, right?
396440	406440	And while I'm being super obvious about what the point is of this video, I do think it's a little bit disingenuous for Felix to imply that, uh, the Wall Street Journal put Disney in a corner
406440	409440	and forced them to sever ties with them.
409440	420440	Disney are a, you know, big company, they can make their own decisions in life, and they're also a little bit afraid of looking like anti-Semites because it's bad to do that.
420440	425440	And also they have a history of maybe making a couple of mistakes on that front and they kind of want to correct that.
425940	433440	No, I think Disney severed their ties with them because they saw what he was doing and thought about it using critical thinking.
433440	441440	If I recall, a similar thing happened with Levi's, where they saw that PewDiePie was making a bunch of rape jokes and they stopped wanting to advertise on his videos.
441440	445440	That's a business decision, that's not repression or censorship.
445440	450440	That's a company saying, hey, maybe we shouldn't advertise on this guy's page.
450940	453940	Maybe it makes us look bad. That's just a business decision.
454440	456440	Disney have something of a reputation to protect.
456440	459440	They make films that are usually for almost all ages.
460440	466440	I'm pretty sure at no point in a Star Wars film does a character pay someone to hold up a sign saying death to all Wookiees,
466440	474440	or at least if they do they turn out to be the bad guy, or in the midst of a massive nervous breakdown, in which case I am really sorry, Felix.
474440	480440	It's pretty clear from how the discussion is unfolding on YouTube that the real problem isn't some impending corporate monopoly.
482440	483440	Sorry, there's a train.
483440	486440	The actual monopoly is inherent in how the discussion is being had.
487440	494440	For example, look at the treatment Jacksepticeye, another gaming YouTuber, is getting for daring to say that he thinks maybe Felix got some things wrong.
494440	497440	Jack is a fan of Felix. The two have known each other for a very long time.
497440	503440	He very clearly looks up to him, and he makes some fairly light criticism, but the internet is calling him a backstabber.
503440	510440	Like, the most subscribed person on YouTube can't even be mildly criticized by someone who admits they look up to him,
510440	516440	without them being accused of backstabbing him and a massive shouting match emerging between their respective fanbases.
516440	519440	And from what I can gather, that's the real problem here.
519440	524440	Comedy on YouTube, as well as most forms of discussion, can't really develop beyond a fairly juvenile stage
524440	529440	because it's impossible to provide a nuanced critique without being regarded as a threat.
529440	536440	Suppose that attempts to defend freedom of speech have ended up being defenses of the most popular person's speech from other people's speech
536440	538440	because they're using it to criticize them.
538440	542440	In place of fighting for some actual freedom or some genuine discussion,
542440	549440	people are basically arguing for a pseudo-populism in which the most subscribed person has to be right because he has the most.
549440	554440	In the words of Keemstar, and I actually wrote this down when I saw it because it was ridiculous,
554440	561440	if we decided as a community that PewDiePie was wrong, then he would have a million dislikes, not a million likes.
561440	562440	He then goes on to say,
562440	567440	We have already decided that PewDiePie has done nothing wrong, that he is innocent.
567440	570440	Already decided he's innocent.
570440	572440	Because of likes.
572440	576440	I certainly hope it goes without saying at this point that the idea that a person can't be wrong
576440	580440	because a lot of people clicked a like button on their favorite gaming YouTuber
580440	583440	is a really bad idea for speech and discussion.
583440	588440	Freedom of speech is a very important thing, and it should be defended from people who seek to limit it.
588440	591440	For example, actual, literal fascists.
591440	593440	But who in this equation needs defending the most?
593440	597440	The guy with the most subscribers and the farthest reach on the fucking platform?
597440	603440	Or the smaller people who actually dare to criticize him and are being treated like dog shit for it?
603440	607440	Somehow I think this video with a bunch of dumb jokes in it and a couple of bits of like criticism
607440	611440	where Jacksepticeye says he thinks Felix got some things wrong
611440	617440	are somehow more revolting than a video of someone paying people to hold up a sign saying death to all Jews.
617440	619440	Doesn't something seem wrong about that?
619440	623440	Just in case it wasn't obvious, no, I don't think Felix is actually a Nazi.
623440	627440	Which, admittedly, is a pretty low bar.
627440	632440	But then again, I have quite a lot of experience with Swedish fascists, so maybe I just know what they look like.
632440	636440	I didn't think the Wall Street Journal thought he was either, though. I've read their article.
636440	639440	They just pointed out that he relies on one joke too often,
639440	645440	and that's because when people criticize him for overusing jokes or relying on sloppy joke editing as a crutch,
645440	649440	people jump down the throat and call them a backstabber.
649440	654440	The structure of YouTube doesn't just hurt people who happen to not be as popular as PewDiePie and have different opinions.
654440	658440	It also is bad for PewDiePie, because his comedy can't evolve
658440	662440	because people can't criticize him without being called backstabbers, so they don't bother.
662440	666440	Unless we actually raise the discourse by treating everyone in the equation better,
666440	670440	especially the people who criticize PewDiePie and have less of an audience,
670440	674440	then we're going to keep encountering this same problem over and over again
674440	676440	because nothing will actually change.
676440	680440	Also, I really have to reiterate, I don't think Felix is a Nazi. Now I've said it, you can't sue me.
685440	691440	Thank you very much to all my patrons for helping to validate this dumb garbage that I make.
691440	695440	In addition to the names scrolling past the screen right now, I'd especially like to thank
