7940	9240	In June 2000,
9240	11480	Ion Storm released Deus Ex.
11480	13980	Deus Ex is one of the best games ever made.
13980	15820	Its engaging free-form gameplay
15820	17980	and complex storytelling quickly cemented it
17980	20160	as one of the true classics of the medium.
20160	25860	♪
25860	27500	So the developer went bankrupt.
27500	29800	If that line sounds familiar to you,
29800	31460	get used to it. Like, 12 more videos
31460	32460	are gonna start this way.
32460	34260	Eidos Interactive, the game's publisher,
34260	36600	was the 51% shareholder in Ion Storm,
36600	38060	so when the company closed its doors
38060	39840	and the creators quit or got let go,
39840	41500	the Deus Ex intellectual property
41500	43180	didn't belong to any of the people who,
43180	44440	you know, made it,
44440	46940	but to a bunch of executives at a publishing company.
46940	49040	Then Eidos Interactive's parent company,
49040	50040	also named Eidos,
50040	51720	which made researching this very confusing,
51720	54020	got bought and merged with another game publisher,
54020	55420	Sales Curve Interactive.
55420	57060	Then they hit major financial trouble
57060	59260	and realized they need to make games to survive
59280	61380	and opened a new development studio in Canada
61380	64060	which began development on the next Deus Ex game.
64060	65060	While that was happening,
65060	66720	things were going great at SCI.
66720	69120	Just kidding, it went so bad the CEO got fired.
69120	70120	To get a fresh start,
70120	72560	they renamed the company to Eidos.
72560	73560	Hold on a second.
73560	75060	Then they got bought again,
75060	76560	this time by Square Enix.
76560	78500	Square Enix said they were going to leave Eidos
78500	80400	to themselves, then changed their mind
80400	81900	and forcibly merged the company
81900	83700	with their European branch and oh, my God,
83700	86080	isn't the game industry so normal and fine?
86080	87780	While all of that was happening,
87800	89200	the team at Eidos Montreal
89200	91340	had to somehow make a video game.
91340	93980	The making of documentary for this new Deus Ex game
93980	96140	begins with a bunch of talk about how great it is
96140	98940	to work with Eidos from French-Canadian developers
98940	101020	wearing t-shirts with the Eidos branding.
101020	103980	Eidos has a very rich IP portfolio.
103980	106360	I mean, their projects are just great.
106360	107980	Their IPs are very rich.
107980	109560	Partway through, Eidos disappears
109560	112060	from the story completely because they stopped existing
112060	114560	and they suddenly had completely different bosses.
114560	117460	Being owned by Square Enix came with some benefits though.
117480	119680	They got to reference Final Fantasy a few times.
119680	122060	One of the bosses, a big guy with a gun for an arm,
122060	123520	got to be named Barret.
123520	125520	They put a poster on some character's walls
125520	127720	for a Final Fantasy 27, you know,
127720	129320	because it's the future. It's cute.
129320	130820	So it wasn't all bad.
130820	132200	Just kidding. It was bad.
132200	133820	The executives at Square Enix
133820	135900	weren't going to let them do this.
135900	137320	They didn't want to risk damaging
137320	138740	the Final Fantasy brand
138740	140120	any more than Kingdom Hearts already.
140120	142660	The team at Eidos Montreal had to argue their way up
142660	144240	the corporate chain of the business
144240	147380	that just bought them all the way up to Yoichi Wada,
147380	149880	the president and director of the entire company,
149880	152300	to get permission to put a funny poster
152300	154460	in the background of their game.
154460	157020	Deus Ex used to be a series that criticized
157020	159140	the bizarre machinations of corporations
159140	161340	so big no one knows who they're working for,
161340	164060	where intellectual property and brand management
164060	165520	mattered more than people,
165520	169100	a world where one company can own half your childhood,
169100	171520	a system governed more by tax incentives
171520	173400	and corporate subsidies than people.
173400	176940	It asked important questions about the future of mankind,
176960	179180	about who wielded power over others
179180	181260	and what their interests really were,
181260	183720	a story sometimes so accurate in its guesses
183720	186300	it seems less fictitious now than ever.
186300	190640	But then, many years and corporate acquisitions later,
190640	193480	comes Deus Ex Human Revolution,
193480	196640	the game that dares to ask the question,
196640	199360	what if we had robot arms?
199360	210800	♪♪
210800	213420	Deus Ex Human Revolution is pretty good.
213420	215420	It's fun. Yeah.
215420	217420	I have a tendency to make videos about things
217420	219420	I either really love or really hate,
219420	222020	so just to clear up any potential confusion here,
222020	224060	this game is fine. Good job, guys.
224060	226100	I'm about to spend, uh, oh, my God,
226100	227900	complaining about it, but I need to say,
227900	230680	this was the first game by a new studio,
230680	233140	and it was being made while they were being bought out
233140	236060	by Square Enix by a team that had never previously worked
236060	238520	on any games even remotely like Deus Ex.
238520	240160	I might not think the game is perfect,
240160	242820	but it is a genuine achievement that it's this good.
242820	244740	So why am I talking about it then?
244740	246460	That's a good question. Me?
246460	247740	Well, here's the thing.
247740	250540	The original Deus Ex belonged to a special subgenre
250540	252800	of games named the immersive sim.
252800	254660	In a sentence, immersive sims are games
254660	256960	that feel just that little bit more like worlds
256980	258160	you're taking part in.
258160	259980	They prioritized the player's freedom
259980	261700	to choose how to solve problems
261700	264540	and then dealing with the consequences of those choices
264540	267540	and being able to find creative and unexpected solutions,
267540	270000	often ones the developers themselves hadn't thought of,
270000	272080	by being built in a way that could respond well
272080	273420	to player creativity.
273420	274580	There's a lot of different ways
274580	276260	you can define an immersive sim,
276260	277880	but there's only one real one.
277880	280680	Can you solve a problem intended to be solved with a gun
280680	282920	by stacking a bunch of boxes and going over it?
282920	284920	In the late 90s and early 2000s,
284940	286980	immersive sims were coming out fairly often,
286980	288600	and people still look back fondly
288600	290020	on many of those games,
290020	293360	but then almost overnight, they disappeared.
293360	297600	An entire genre of games basically died out for years,
297600	298700	but a couple of years back,
298700	300200	we started to get more of them again,
300200	301860	and they're amazing and beautiful
301860	304160	and a lot like the games that people remember.
304160	307080	Human Revolution is a fascinating orphan of history.
307080	309540	It came out between the two golden ages
309540	311660	of the immersive sim when this type of game
311660	314160	wasn't considered popular or profitable enough,
314160	315280	so while they were making it,
315280	316780	the team made a lot of changes
316780	318780	to try and make it a bit like other games
318780	320040	people liked at the time,
320040	322420	trying to streamline it and make it more accessible
322420	323740	for a console audience.
323740	325540	I'll give you three guesses why they decided
325540	327660	the game needed third-person cover shooting,
327660	328800	and at the time of release,
328800	330840	people seemed happy with its compromises,
330840	332920	but the thing about immersive sims is
332920	336140	they were already great and didn't need changing.
336140	338420	Recent games like the new Prey have proven
338420	340840	immersive sims barely need to change at all
340840	342380	from how they were 20 years ago
342400	344940	to be amazing at what they're trying to do,
344940	346820	so when the Human Revolution team decided
346820	348580	the Deus Ex formula was broken,
348580	351040	all their fixes actually made it less like
351040	352620	what makes these games great,
352620	355540	so today in this year's self-therapy session
355540	357420	masquerading as a video game analysis,
357420	358800	I'll be trying to get to the bottom
358800	360340	of what happened to Deus Ex
360340	362040	to see what we can learn about how
362040	364220	or how not to modernize a classic
364220	365760	because there's a lot more at stake here
365760	367680	than just one beloved franchise.
367680	369380	After doing some digging into the lineage
369380	370880	of the intellectual property rights
370880	372340	of some of my favorite franchises,
372340	375100	I discovered Square Enix might not just be rebooting
375100	377300	slash remaking slash beating the dead horses
377300	380100	of the Deus Ex, Tomb Raider, and Thief properties.
380100	382100	No, a much more important franchise
382100	383600	lives under their jurisdiction,
383600	385940	one of the most important and meaningful stories
385940	387280	in gaming history.
387280	390860	I'm speaking, of course, about Gex.
390860	392940	The Gex trilogy sold millions of copies
392940	394700	and arguably saved the world,
394700	397820	but there hasn't been a new Gex since 1999,
397820	399660	and due to Crystal Dynamics' acquisition
399660	401320	by Eidos in 1998,
401320	404040	Square Enix's 2009 acquisition of the company
404040	406160	that bought Eidos and renamed itself to Eidos
406160	407620	means it's only a matter of time
407620	409920	before Squeenix puts someone to work
409920	412620	reviving the sleeping god in their possession,
412620	415080	so for all our sakes,
415080	417500	it's worth seeing if we can learn from other attempts
417500	418800	to revive old franchises
418800	422380	and come up with some general pointers.
422380	425380	Gex and Deus Ex form a symbiont circle.
425380	427140	What happens to one of them will affect the other.
427140	429640	You must understand this, so we have to do this.
429660	431460	For Gex, if we're not careful,
431460	433000	he'll be in the next Kingdom Hearts
433000	436220	and Kiss, Goofy, and Society will fucking crumble.
436220	438540	♪ ♪
438540	440460	A really good test of role-playing games
440460	442880	is how quickly players get to do that.
442880	444760	In Deus Ex, you press new game,
444760	446220	and then you're making a character.
446220	447480	Then there's an opening cutscene,
447480	448980	and bam, you're at your first mission,
448980	451140	the iconic and impressively open-ended
451140	452360	Liberty Island level.
452360	455020	A huge part of why this game still works so well
455020	457180	is how instantaneously it makes you feel
457180	459320	like you're playing it your own way.
459340	461380	You've only just decided your character's
461380	463880	starting abilities, and already you're being told
463880	465840	to put them to use how you see fit
465840	467760	to capture the NSF leader holed up
467760	468960	in the Statue of Liberty.
468960	471260	Within literally seconds of starting the game,
471260	473300	you're being asked to pick a new weapon
473300	475100	by a character whose appearance changes
475100	476800	based on what your character looks like
476800	478180	because he's your brother.
478180	480180	That's a pretty freeing way to start a game,
480180	481680	giving players a bunch of choices
481680	483680	and already reacting to one they made
483680	485280	in the character creation screen,
485280	488060	but this type of opening isn't unique to Deus Ex though.
488060	489560	It's a staple of the genre.
489560	490560	In, I don't know,
490560	492060	Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines,
492060	493940	you make a character, cutscene,
493940	495780	funny tutorial that you can skip,
495780	497240	welcome to Santa Monica.
497240	499240	It's just like it is in real life.
499240	500780	The high watermark here, of course,
500780	502120	is Fallout New Vegas,
502120	503540	instantly plopping the character
503540	505740	you just made in the world with next to no limits
505740	506960	where to go and what to do.
506960	508820	Putting the player in the driver's seat
508820	511580	as quickly as possible creates a sense of agency
511580	513660	which is pivotal in games that prioritize
513660	516340	making choices and playing a role.
516380	518380	Role-playing games. What a concept.
518380	520880	-♪ We got to get up ♪
520880	522460	In Deus Ex Human Revolution,
522460	524300	I was a bit worried when I realized
524300	526680	there wasn't anything like a character creation screen,
526680	529220	but hey, I'm old. Maybe those are outdated now.
529220	531140	I did do a little cringe when I saw
531140	532840	the highest difficulty was called
532840	534440	Give Me Deus Ex though.
534440	536860	Sure, tell me to have high expectations.
536860	538940	That hasn't ruined my life before.
538940	541240	♪♪
541240	543240	Is everything in place?
543240	544860	Almost.
544880	547060	What do you mean, almost?
547060	548560	The game begins with the weekly
548560	550260	Illuminati Zoom conference
550260	552220	where they ominously discuss their plans
552220	554480	while trying to change the default profile picture.
554480	557900	Apart from one teeny, tiny, massive problem,
557900	559160	I really like this opening.
559160	562120	I especially like how short it pretends to be.
562120	564900	The intro ends and bam, you are Adam Jensen,
564900	567080	head of security at Sarif Industries.
567080	569240	Oh, it's really thematic if you think about it.
569240	572240	You see, Adam is a clever reference to Seinfeld.
572240	574040	Remember my friend Adam from Detroit?
574060	575400	Yeah, the guy with the dog mantid.
575400	577140	Ah!
577140	579560	I do like that it zooms in on his head to start the game.
579560	581320	I'm glad someone's repping the classics.
581320	582740	Wow, that was pretty quick.
582740	584280	It's time to begin the first level
584280	585820	and start playing the game. Nope.
585820	587860	You see, the problem with the original Deus Ex
587860	590440	was you didn't spend 20 minutes watching J.C. Denton
590440	593040	waddle around his office making small talk first.
593040	595120	The opening cut scene is far from over.
595120	596880	The top scientist at Sarif Industries
596880	598200	is Adam's ex-girlfriend,
598200	599580	but they're still pretty close.
599580	601660	You can tell because they decided to pose her
601660	604040	like a teenage anime school girl.
604040	607260	And I thought women were the ones who kept men waiting.
607260	609000	Oh-ho-ho-ho! Gender!
609000	610420	The introduction isn't one minute
610420	613220	of ominous, interesting dialogue followed by gameplay.
613220	616560	It's followed by many minutes of walking and talking,
616560	618020	meaningless techno babble.
618020	619360	But the increased neural peptides
619360	620860	coming from the PDOC cluster...
620860	622360	That actually happens twice.
622360	624320	I'm thinking the glial tissue breakdown
624320	626520	you noticed after splicing in the repressive protein
626520	627520	might be the cause.
627520	629520	Oh, yeah, this is great.
629520	631400	We might get a more accurate reading...
631440	633780	Da-na-na-na-na-na.
633780	636360	And then you get to watch a weapons demonstration,
636360	639020	argue with your co-workers in the elevator...
640280	642100	Watch the planes go by,
642100	644020	and listen to your boss tell you how important
644020	646660	all that stuff was for the future of the human race
646660	648020	before they realize they're losing you
648020	650280	so, uh, uh, a terrorist attack happens.
650280	652580	There we go. Oh, boy, a call to action.
652580	654320	Now we can finally start the game.
654320	656780	The unskippable tutorial for how to play the game.
656780	659240	We need to make sure you know how to crouch,
659240	661240	move boxes around,
661240	664080	use vents, and take cover.
664080	666460	Click on enemies to shoot them.
666460	668460	Okay, now do it a few more times just in case.
668460	669960	Okay, well, at least it's over
669960	671420	and now we all know how to play
671420	673300	so now we can start the game.
673300	674840	Watch another cut scene.
674840	677260	Adam gets knackered by some bastards.
677260	679800	Then the bad man shoots him into a hospital
679800	680800	where the game transitions
680800	682640	into a really cool opening sequence.
682640	684260	Adam has most of his body replaced
684260	686020	with mechanical parts and the music swells
686020	687860	and, ah, yeah, it's a really cool opening.
687860	690100	And now, finally, after the opening cut scene
690100	691680	and the walk and talk and all this set up
691680	693360	and a tutorial and another cut scene,
693360	694600	the game can start.
694600	696320	Here he is. Here's our boy.
696320	697860	Oh, man, they're doing it again.
697860	699100	Yeah!
699100	700700	Finally, you can play the game.
700700	702900	Start a sequence where Adam comes back into work
702900	704540	to get his heads-up display fixed
704540	708320	by the IT guy on his way to the first mission.
708320	710660	Only then can you go to the helipad
710660	712380	and after another cut scene,
712380	714120	you have a conversation in the aircraft
714120	716380	with your boss about the mission you're headed into
716380	717800	and get to pick a weapon.
717820	720160	The first real choice in the game.
720160	722900	As a reminder, you're making the same choice
722900	726160	literally five seconds into the original Deus Ex.
726160	727160	Give me the GEP gun.
727160	728500	The GEP gun might be useful.
728500	731120	♪♪
731120	732840	That might have been over the line, JC.
732840	735620	I kind of wanted to know how fast the intro could go
735620	737180	if you were going as fast as possible
737180	738180	and skipping everything,
738180	740340	but when I tried that, I hit a little snag.
740340	742180	How quickly can you give me Deus Ex?
742180	743180	Come on, let's do it.
743240	745240	♪♪
745240	749660	Uh, uh, uh, uh, come on.
749660	751160	I want it.
751160	752160	Okay, right.
752160	753160	Oh, you're kidding me.
753160	754160	You can't even skip it?
754160	755740	I went for a piss while I was recording
755740	757200	the intro of the director's cut
757200	759960	and there was still, like, two minutes left of this.
759960	761620	I should have bothered to wash my hands.
761620	763420	Uh, fun fact, the Human Revolution
763420	765800	speedrunning community have a shared save file
765800	767920	that starts right after the walk and talk
767920	769760	because holy shit, can you imagine
769760	772600	having to sit through that every time?
772600	774220	Oh, my God, I can't even close the game
774220	775520	to stop the experiment.
775520	777100	It just goes to this screen.
777100	778640	You can't even open the menu.
778640	779900	Alt-F4?
779900	782020	Okay, you can at least go it that way.
782020	785820	♪♪
785820	789660	It crashed. It's fucking crashed.
789660	791440	Now, I get what they're going for.
791440	793580	Games with a more linear cinematic intent
793580	795580	like Red Dead Redemption or The Last of Us
795580	797700	or even Half-Life bring you into the narrative
797700	800120	by slowly building to their gameplay like this,
800120	803200	but for RPGs with a focus on player freedom and choice,
803200	805200	this is the opposite of what you should do.
805200	807360	The player doesn't feel like they're taking part
807360	809440	in the story when they can barely control
809440	812780	where Adam aims his head for most of his big introduction.
812780	814320	For games like Deus Ex,
814320	817420	which Human Revolution says it's trying to give people,
817420	819460	you want the player to have a sense of control
819460	820620	as soon as possible.
820620	821620	Once it's over, though,
821620	823000	everything really picks up,
823000	824500	so it's not that big a deal,
824500	826500	but if it's not a big deal, then why did I waste
826500	828260	so much time complaining about it?
828260	829760	Well, first of all, leave me alone.
829900	831200	It's my video. I can do what I want.
831200	833200	And secondly, I think this choice reflects
833200	834940	a pretty serious misunderstanding
834940	837500	about what makes these games fun to play.
837500	839780	You see, this is an exact mistake
839780	843120	the original game almost made too.
843120	845080	See? I'm going somewhere with this.
845080	846080	Please subscribe.
846080	847660	They originally planned to begin
847660	850260	with meeting all of your coworkers in your base,
850260	851500	talking to everyone,
851500	854220	a lot of exposition and setup and introductions,
854220	855600	basically a lot of busy work
855600	857600	that wouldn't be that fun to do first thing
857600	859020	the instant you hit new game.
859060	861100	Before there was an attack on UNATCO HQ
861100	862900	that necessitated going into action.
862900	864900	In other words, they had the same idea
864900	866860	as the people who made Human Revolution,
866860	868900	but they later realized it would be better
868900	870400	if they started with gameplay
870400	872280	and deliberately switched the order.
872280	874900	This introduces a minor weird plot thing.
874900	877580	You arrive on an island to deal with a terrorist attack
877580	880540	and it's right next to where your new base happens to be.
880540	881960	This would have made slightly more sense
881960	883380	when you started at the base
883380	885760	and went out when they attacked headquarters,
885760	887840	which is how it seemed to work in original footage
887860	889040	from betas of the game,
889040	890580	but it was worth it to make this change
890580	893000	because the player feels like a part of the story now,
893000	895800	which is, you know, the goal of role-playing games.
895800	897420	You don't feel like a part of the story
897420	899420	by watching the character do things.
899420	902680	You feel that way by getting to do things as the character,
902680	904220	and there's a big difference there.
904220	905880	I don't like giving direct advice
905880	908900	like I know the exact correct way to make a game,
908900	911400	but guys, start the game here.
911400	913440	Start at the thing or in the plane
913440	914560	on the way to the thing.
914560	916140	The next game, Mankind Divided,
916160	918700	did exactly that. You start on the plane.
918700	921000	I mean, it had three more opening sequences
921000	922040	after it for some reason.
922040	923620	More importantly than any of this though,
923620	926120	we need to circle back to the most fascinating part
926120	927120	of this whole thing.
927120	928500	Deus Ex Human Revolution
928500	930800	recreated an exact problem
930800	932840	the original game almost had
932840	935300	and then fixed during development.
935300	937420	I think we need to explore how something like that
937420	938680	can happen, right?
938680	941940	♪♪
941940	943860	So the development of Human Revolution
943860	945680	was a bit of a mess.
945680	947640	I mean, first off, this was a new studio
947640	949060	making their first game.
949060	950600	You can't just snap your fingers
950600	954860	and open a new 350-person development studio overnight.
954860	956700	You have to build that, you know?
956700	958320	And in this case, literally.
958320	960480	When the studio opened, the building they planned
960480	963200	to make their offices wasn't even finished being built.
963200	967040	These guys left everything to come to a brand new studio
967040	970700	with not even permanent offices yet.
970700	972700	Building a new studio can't be easy.
972700	974880	Now, you're clever, so you're probably wondering
974880	977920	why so many game companies open studios in Montreal.
977920	980760	I'm sure French-Canadians make for excellent game designers,
980760	981880	but the answer is money.
981880	983420	Here's the annual cost of hiring
983420	986180	a video game programmer in various major cities.
986180	989840	San Francisco, $119,404.
989840	994060	Austin, where Deus Ex was developed, $91,161.
994060	996140	Vancouver, $78,500.
996140	998360	Toronto's almost at $78,000.
998360	1003480	They're getting there. Montreal, $72,335.
1003500	1008260	Montreal with government tax credit, $45,209.
1008260	1011920	Up to 37.5% of the cost of your employees' salaries
1011920	1014720	are effectively given back to you by the province.
1014720	1017640	Look, all I'm saying is I can telepathically predict
1017640	1019800	where companies will open their next game studio.
1019800	1022180	Don't believe me? It's all in the numbers.
1022180	1023560	What, were EIDA supposed to open
1023560	1025240	a new studio in Texas again?
1025240	1027560	The biggest game studio headquartered in Texas now
1027560	1029740	is, I think, Gearbox, right?
1029740	1032080	And guess where they're opening their new studio?
1032100	1033920	Come to work at Gearbox Quebec.
1033920	1034920	They don't pay very well,
1034920	1036880	but they promise really good bonuses.
1036880	1038180	I mean, they promise them.
1038180	1040300	EIDAS Montreal also had to deal with the fact
1040300	1041680	that they're the Canadian branch
1041680	1043760	of a company that doesn't exist.
1043760	1045760	They got acquired by another company
1045760	1048140	while they were trying to make their first game.
1048140	1049780	That's got to make the development process
1049780	1051240	a little more complicated.
1051240	1054900	It's, uh, it's, uh, two years or more of development.
1054900	1057160	You never know how it's gonna turn out.
1057160	1059320	It's easy to see why some aspects
1059320	1061000	of the process got misplaced.
1061000	1062760	Okay, I don't want to make any more excuses
1062760	1063760	for the developers.
1063760	1065000	It's starting to feel a bit condescending.
1065000	1066760	Let's talk about some of the choices
1066760	1069500	the developers made about how to design this game.
1069500	1072060	In a hugely informative Game Developers Conference talk
1072060	1073760	about the development of Human Revolution,
1073760	1075760	gameplay director Francois Lapikus,
1075760	1077260	sorry if I'm pronouncing that wrong,
1077260	1079520	my Quebecois, Quebeci, Quebeci?
1079520	1081180	My Canadian French isn't great,
1081180	1082480	says during pre-production,
1082480	1084520	the team planned the entire game
1084520	1087240	and all of its features and mechanics in advance
1087240	1089560	and then stuck to that plan throughout development,
1089580	1092260	executing all of it with very few changes.
1092260	1094960	Uh, we did not redo systems.
1094960	1097260	Uh, we did not rethink the game.
1097260	1099020	We just went full speed ahead.
1099020	1101260	We knew exactly what we wanted this game to be,
1101260	1103100	what we wanted the player to feel.
1103100	1104940	Having a plan makes sense,
1104940	1106940	but traditionally in game development,
1106940	1110820	plans change over time as you see your game ideas in action
1110820	1112600	and iterate and make changes.
1112600	1114440	Human Revolution's main design team
1114440	1117660	wrote all their initial ideas on huge sheets of paper
1117680	1119520	and then stuck them to the walls
1119520	1121220	and followed them religiously.
1121220	1123020	Everything I've shown you so far,
1123020	1125140	we put on huge sheets of paper
1125140	1127320	which we papered the walls over with.
1127320	1129240	Before they'd actually made the game,
1129240	1132280	had a chance to see how it felt to play or test things out,
1132280	1134400	they'd already decided how almost everything
1134400	1135440	was going to be.
1135440	1138040	So by having it, uh, on walls,
1138040	1140000	every single morning when we came in,
1140000	1142240	we saw exactly what we needed to do.
1142240	1143540	They were so important in fact
1143540	1146000	that when we moved to our, uh, final offices,
1146000	1147380	it's the first thing we put up.
1147380	1149020	By the end, the team had made a game
1149020	1151680	that was absolutely brilliant...
1151680	1152680	on paper.
1152680	1154600	When I say Human Revolution feels like
1154600	1156560	the first few ideas a bunch of guys had
1156560	1159100	in a brainstorming session right at the start of development,
1159100	1161240	that's because it is the first few ideas
1161240	1162900	a bunch of guys had in a brainstorming session
1162900	1164320	right at the start of development.
1164320	1165320	Basically the whole game...
1165320	1166320	Ha ha ha.
1166320	1167480	Blueprint was a way for us
1167480	1169360	to chart the whole game in advance.
1169360	1172860	Just to show you this is, uh, half of the blueprint.
1172860	1175000	Basically the whole game had been planned out
1175000	1176860	on spreadsheets before they'd discovered,
1176860	1179220	you know, some of it is boring and time consuming,
1179220	1180980	and then they realized they'd forgotten
1180980	1183020	to plan half the stuff that needed to be there
1183020	1185100	and had to add major components to the game
1185100	1187280	at the last minute and everybody hated them.
1187280	1190940	Lapikus apologizes directly in his talk for the boss fights.
1190940	1192280	They were a big part of the game
1192280	1194080	and we should have put more efforts in them
1194080	1195900	so truly sorry about that.
1195900	1197460	While I was watching this talk,
1197460	1199880	I was beginning to write a joke in my notebook
1199880	1202960	like I guess no one wrote about the boss fights on the walls
1202960	1205260	but it turns out that actually happened.
1205260	1206720	Remember the directions sheets?
1206740	1208820	I was talking about at the beginning.
1208820	1211080	We didn't have one for boss fights.
1211080	1212660	We kind of forgot about it
1212660	1215040	because we didn't have these direction sheets.
1215040	1218080	We didn't really know what we were doing with boss fights.
1218080	1220300	Game development is a complicated process
1220300	1223040	where initial ideas you had in a vacuum months ago
1223040	1225340	might turn out not to work in practice.
1225340	1226600	Just as a comparison,
1226600	1228480	the team behind the original Deus Ex
1228480	1230560	threw away half of their design document
1230560	1231560	part way through.
1231560	1232560	We ended up with,
1232560	1233560	are you sitting down,
1233560	1236600	500 pages of documentation?
1236780	1237780	Yeah.
1237780	1238780	No one read it.
1238780	1240440	Um...
1240440	1242440	Warren Spector, the director of the first game,
1242440	1244520	is really open about how much rethinking
1244520	1246660	needed to be done to make the game what it is
1246660	1248460	even though they thought they knew everything
1248460	1250280	they needed at the end of pre-production.
1250280	1251620	The year Deus Ex came out,
1251620	1253580	he wrote a retrospective for Gamasutra
1253580	1255960	which incidentally changed its name to game developer
1255960	1258080	while I was writing this video which was confusing
1258080	1260300	and part of it covers just how much of their ideas
1260300	1262180	got thrown out or replaced.
1262180	1263760	That knowledge allowed us to go through
1263760	1265880	our 500-page design documents
1265920	1267920	and cut everything that was extraneous,
1267920	1271720	winnowing it down to a svelte 270 pages.
1271720	1273760	Less game, not at all.
1273760	1276680	What was left was the best 270 pages,
1276680	1278160	the stuff that worked.
1278160	1280440	We were open to change, be open to change.
1280440	1282020	Anybody who tells you that, you know,
1282020	1283800	when you get to the end of pre-production,
1283800	1285480	you've got a script and nothing changes
1285480	1286960	has never made a game, right?
1286960	1288300	Blueprint was a way for us
1288300	1290060	to chart the whole game in advance.
1290060	1290900	On the one hand,
1290900	1292560	you have a game that appears to have been designed
1292560	1295600	pretty intensively before they'd even made any of it
1295600	1298000	and on the other, you have a team months from release
1298000	1299840	who realize there's a problem and go,
1299840	1301120	wait, hold on a second.
1301120	1303440	Like me and Warren and Chris would sit in a room
1303440	1304720	and fight like cats and dogs.
1304720	1305720	It's just kind of weird
1305720	1307280	that you introduce some of these characters,
1307280	1308360	you interact with them a little bit
1308360	1309760	and then they're just gone.
1309760	1312320	He shows up in mission one, he shows up in mission two,
1312320	1314200	he shows up in mission four
1314200	1316360	and then you never hear from him again.
1316360	1317600	What happened to that guy?
1317600	1318960	And it was a powerful question
1318960	1320880	because it was one of the basics of storytelling
1320880	1324280	that we as video game designers weren't yet applying
1324280	1325560	and so we went back.
1325600	1327200	Now I'm sure I could wrap this point up here
1327200	1329040	in a neat little bow and say something like,
1329040	1330760	the real test of a creative work
1330760	1332600	isn't having a lot of good ideas.
1332600	1334480	It's understanding when you have to change them
1334480	1336400	to make them work, but then you have to ask,
1336400	1339200	why would anyone be so rigid about pre-production
1339200	1341320	and unwilling to rethink things like this?
1341320	1343400	Well, because they have to be.
1343400	1345240	Think about how much game development
1345240	1347120	has changed since the 90s.
1347120	1349600	If someone had a better idea about a mechanic
1349600	1351120	or wanted to rewrite the opening
1351120	1353760	or redo some dialogue or swap the first two levels,
1353760	1355160	it wasn't too much work,
1355160	1358120	and crucially, not that much work was wasted.
1358120	1360560	It's pretty easy to steer a canoe.
1360560	1363680	Larger ships, however, are notoriously difficult to steer
1363680	1365560	even when you see the problem in time.
1365560	1367080	You know, like in that movie.
1367080	1368600	Uh, Speed II?
1368600	1371000	Games are vastly more expensive to make now.
1371000	1373960	Need scores of programmers, artists, animators,
1373960	1376840	directors, producers, designers, writers.
1376840	1378520	Companies need organizational.
1378520	1380200	Wait, I have more. Production assistants,
1380200	1382360	general managers, composers, sound designers,
1382360	1384480	mo-cap artists, the entire second company
1384480	1385960	you farmed out the boss fights to,
1385960	1388320	not to mention voice actors you have to call back in
1388320	1390520	to do more work if you need to change anything big,
1390520	1392560	and incidentally, one of Human Revolution's
1392560	1395000	other really big problems exists completely
1395000	1397680	because they didn't want to have to call back a voice actor.
1397680	1398920	I never asked for this.
1398920	1401720	Things do need to be planned that much more in advance
1401720	1404200	and stuck to pretty strictly if all these folks
1404200	1405560	are gonna manage to come together
1405560	1407840	to produce something that works at all.
1407840	1409640	If someone on the team thought the opening
1409640	1411520	kind of sucked and needed some reworking
1411520	1413640	and I'm willing to bet several of them did,
1413640	1414640	what were they gonna do?
1414640	1416640	Cut out millions of dollars of work?
1416640	1418360	Remove all that content you made
1418360	1419800	and have to make even more?
1419800	1422360	Tell the higher-ups you blew a ton of time and money
1422360	1423360	and need more of it?
1423360	1425160	They had to fight all the way to the top
1425160	1427080	to get a fucking poster in here.
1427080	1428440	Do you think they're gonna get that far
1428440	1431200	asking them for the time to redo something this big?
1431200	1433080	Now, I'm not strictly saying they wanted
1433080	1434680	to fix the opening and couldn't.
1434680	1436120	There's no way of knowing for certain
1436120	1437960	unless someone who worked at IDES Montreal
1437960	1439640	wants to go on record. Please email me.
1439640	1441760	I'm just saying that in the AAA landscape
1441760	1443240	that has sprouted as gaming became
1443240	1445080	one of the biggest industries on the planet,
1445080	1447800	you have so much less room to change and improve
1447800	1450520	once you realize a guy disappears after mission four,
1450520	1452760	and guess what? A guy literally does disappear
1452760	1453760	after mission four.
1453760	1454960	We'll get to that later.
1454960	1457720	Human Revolution has many of the exact problems
1457720	1460040	the original Deus Ex team have described
1460040	1462200	their game having before they had the chance
1462200	1463720	to go back and fix it.
1463720	1466840	It just didn't get the polish and rethinking
1466840	1469320	that made Deus Ex 1 quite so special,
1469320	1471240	and this leads to much bigger problems
1471240	1472440	than a boring opening.
1472440	1475200	If you asked me what was the most important thing
1475200	1477360	about these games, and you're watching this video
1477360	1479160	so implicitly you are asking me,
1479160	1481280	I'd say it's giving the player agency,
1481280	1483920	giving them the freedom to make their own choices.
1483920	1486040	Most of Human Revolution's biggest issues
1486040	1487600	spring from a misunderstanding
1487600	1489160	of what this actually means.
1489160	1491400	Instead of giving players meaningful choices
1491400	1493160	to make as Adam Jensen,
1493160	1495560	lots of the game is about watching Adam Jensen
1495560	1498200	make his own choices without the player's control.
1498200	1503000	♪♪
1503000	1505280	During the first level at the manufacturing plant,
1505280	1506520	while you're making your way through
1506520	1508160	or past the gang that has occupied it,
1508160	1509800	there are hostages you can try to save,
1509800	1511360	and there's also a climactic standoff
1511360	1512960	with Zeke Sanders, the ringleader,
1512960	1514440	who has a hostage at gunpoint.
1514440	1516480	You can trigger a shootout where he kills the hostage
1516480	1518120	and then attacks you, but if you're quick enough,
1518120	1520560	you can take him out first and the hostage survives.
1520560	1522280	You can also just let him go.
1522280	1523720	This will cause the hostage to be killed
1523720	1525480	in the crossfire during his escape,
1525480	1528040	but you can actually talk him into letting her go
1528040	1529600	and just walking out.
1529600	1531320	One of the hostages you can save earlier
1531320	1532680	is this woman's husband.
1532680	1534000	If you saved both of them,
1534000	1535800	they feel indebted to you and tell you
1535800	1537680	to catch up with them later at their place.
1537680	1539840	You're a true hero, man.
1539840	1541920	I'll find some way to repay this, I swear.
1541920	1544320	If you do, they give you the address of an arms dealer
1544320	1545960	and get him to give you a discount.
1545960	1547880	This is a really neat little side story
1547880	1549760	that ties into the player's actions.
1549760	1551480	The discount isn't even that useful
1551480	1553000	for reasons we'll explore later,
1553000	1555440	and these characters don't do anything else afterwards,
1555440	1557040	but you don't need any wider effects
1557040	1558640	than that for this to work.
1558640	1561480	I can never thank you enough for what you did.
1561480	1563760	The fun here comes from feeling briefly
1563760	1565320	that you're tangibly involved
1565320	1568000	in two tiny little digital lives,
1568000	1569320	that the things you're doing
1569320	1571880	and how you do them can make a difference.
1571880	1576200	This side quest is genuinely really nice.
1576200	1578880	However, it's also the best you're getting.
1578880	1580680	When it comes to the main story,
1580680	1582760	the thing you're focusing on for most of the game,
1582760	1585600	the player has little to no freedom or control.
1585640	1587160	You get to choose the in-flight meal,
1587160	1589120	but the plane's on autopilot, and oh, no,
1589120	1591040	a metaphor for the direction the story's taking.
1591040	1593840	The actual story of the manufacturing plant level
1593840	1595640	is about Adam walking in on a hacker
1595640	1597960	going after the company's sensitive data,
1597960	1600360	and I say Adam here, not the player,
1600360	1601840	because once you reach the door,
1601840	1604280	you're forced to watch him immediately get seen
1604280	1606080	by the hacker and watch him get hacked
1606080	1608200	by a double hacker and then fail
1608200	1610000	to stop the hacker shooting himself.
1610000	1612000	Help me.
1612000	1615240	♪♪
1615280	1616800	This is an important story moment
1616800	1618800	they thought would be really cool, you see,
1618800	1621000	so the player's ability to interact with it
1621000	1622480	needed to take a back seat.
1622480	1625320	You don't get to decide what to do about the hacker.
1625320	1627520	You get to watch a movie.
1627520	1629080	Patch me to Seraph now.
1629080	1633080	♪♪
1633080	1634320	Oh, yeah, this is great.
1634320	1637000	This could have been an engaging gameplay sequence.
1637000	1638920	The player could have been able to knock them out
1638920	1640360	using stealth or grab them
1640360	1641960	before they managed to shoot themselves
1641960	1643920	and only get this outcome if they were too slow
1643920	1645240	and failed to stop them.
1645240	1647600	You know, like that thing they do a few minutes later.
1647600	1649560	Just do this but for the part of the story
1649560	1651000	that actually matters.
1651000	1653520	This would give the player a sense of direct interaction
1653520	1655160	with the major events of the plot.
1655160	1657360	The story wouldn't even need to change too much.
1657360	1658960	Sure, this character dying here
1658960	1661680	probably seems too important at first glance
1661680	1663960	since the next quest involves breaking into the morgue
1663960	1666400	of a police station to recover his brain computer
1666400	1668120	from his body, but what if,
1668120	1669800	even if you knocked him out,
1669800	1672680	he mysteriously turned up dead in police custody?
1672680	1675080	This would actually enhance the sense of a conspiracy
1675080	1677240	while also making the player feel like
1677240	1678520	they were involved in it.
1678520	1680320	Instead of being, how dare the police
1680320	1682800	not give my tech startup complete access
1682800	1685360	to a corpse they just recovered five minutes ago,
1685360	1687240	it would be, holy shit, they're in on it.
1687240	1688240	They killed him.
1688240	1689760	We can't let them get away with this.
1689760	1690760	Ooh, hang on.
1690760	1692080	Can we just talk about the design
1692080	1693440	of this room for a second?
1693440	1695120	It's built so you can see the hacker
1695120	1697000	when you come in through the frosted glass,
1697000	1698520	but you can't, like, distract him
1698520	1699960	or come in through another route
1699960	1701720	or shoot him through the glass
1701720	1703160	or get his attention in any way.
1703160	1705160	You just have to watch him playing this animation
1705160	1707400	until you trigger the cutscene by going through the door.
1707400	1709200	You can even see there's another way in,
1709200	1711680	but you can't get over this stuff to get behind him.
1711680	1714520	What's kind of insulting is they put an invisible wall here
1714520	1716560	so you can't climb over it when you can climb over
1716560	1718640	the stuff that's the same height right next to it.
1718640	1719920	It's like they went out of their way
1719920	1721640	to make it as obvious as possible
1721640	1724600	that you have no choice except to come in through this room
1724600	1726560	this one way and trigger the cutscene.
1726560	1729160	Instead of giving you a reasonable amount of control,
1729160	1731440	the game makes increasingly awkward attempts
1731440	1734040	to make you feel like you're making more choices
1734040	1735240	than you actually are.
1735240	1737560	After the standoff, the cops have alternate lines
1737560	1740200	of dialogue for almost every specific big thing
1740200	1741680	that happened at the factory.
1741680	1743920	If Sanders got away, if you killed him,
1743920	1745680	if you saved the hostages or not,
1745680	1747800	they all instantly know and have thoughts
1747800	1750280	about every major thing you just did.
1750280	1752600	Diffusing that bomb was some quick work.
1752600	1753960	You should get a commendation.
1753960	1756400	You have no idea how quickly I diffused the bomb.
1756400	1758360	You weren't there.
1758360	1760080	God damn!
1765080	1767240	Nice job securing the plant.
1767240	1768720	I wouldn't have thought a security guard
1768720	1769720	could handle this.
1769720	1771720	Doesn't even stop trying to kick the door down
1771720	1774120	to tell me what he thinks about how I handled things.
1774120	1775120	What a pro.
1775120	1776640	When you get back to Sarif headquarters,
1776640	1778640	everyone else reacts to your choices too
1778640	1781120	in a way that starts to feel stilted and artificial
1781120	1782560	like they're breathing down your neck
1782560	1784320	trying to make you feel noticed.
1784320	1786520	Talks all over the office, Mr. J.
1786520	1788840	You really took care of those puny first assholes.
1788840	1790600	How'd you take them down without killing them?
1790600	1793880	Almost everyone at your job already has something to say.
1793880	1795640	How did that monster get away from you?
1795640	1797600	You saved the hostages, didn't you, Jensen?
1797600	1799800	Apparently there wasn't much bloodshed thanks to you.
1799800	1801640	Pritchard has one of two dialogue lines
1801640	1803800	based on how many guys you killed at the plant.
1803800	1806200	Well, well, if it isn't Attila the Hun,
1806200	1807760	fresh from the killing fields.
1807760	1810280	But if you killed very few people, he says this.
1810280	1813560	Well, if it isn't Mahatma Gandhi himself.
1813560	1816680	Come to honor us all with his life-preserving presence.
1816680	1817720	Now, this is cute,
1817720	1819520	accounting for the player's choices like this,
1819520	1821800	but this one line is all that changes.
1821800	1824840	In fact, even if you haven't killed anyone in the game yet,
1824840	1826520	his next line is still this.
1826520	1829600	Stick to kicking down doors and shooting people, Jensen,
1829600	1831600	and stop trying to do my job.
1831600	1835160	Someone wrote Pritchard to treat Jensen like a serial killer
1835160	1837240	then realized they should probably account
1837240	1839600	for the possibility the player hasn't killed anyone
1839600	1841920	and added precisely one alternative line
1841920	1842920	and moved on.
1842920	1844880	I get the desire to make your home base
1844880	1847160	feel like it's reacting to the player's choices.
1847160	1848960	It's a really good idea on paper
1848960	1851000	and you know those guys loved paper.
1851000	1852240	Ha ha, good one.
1852240	1853600	But if you execute it poorly,
1853600	1855600	it doesn't feel like characters reacting
1855600	1857200	to things another character did.
1857200	1859560	It feels like writers scrambling to find ways
1859560	1861400	to make you feel involved in a story.
1861400	1863800	Jensen, is it true Sanders acted surprised
1863800	1864800	when he heard about the hacker?
1864800	1867040	Uh, buddy, that just happened.
1867040	1868880	I just got back right now.
1868880	1871120	Who told you this? Did you read the script?
1871160	1873320	Luckily, this problem solves itself.
1873320	1874480	After the early levels,
1874480	1876760	the player has so little control over what happens
1876760	1879520	that NPCs run out of things to react to you doing.
1879520	1881640	Either that or even the writers realized
1881640	1883040	how weird it would be if the people
1883040	1884640	at your Detroit headquarters were like,
1884640	1886280	hey, Adam, way to steal that key card
1886280	1887440	from that brothel in China.
1887440	1889080	The game has another way of creating
1889080	1890320	the illusion of choice though.
1890320	1892600	Many sequences have dialogue choices.
1892600	1895200	These feel like choices because, well,
1895200	1897960	they are technically, but what the game doesn't tell you
1897960	1899920	is these choices do nothing.
1899920	1902880	So how's it feel being augmented?
1902880	1903880	Excuse me?
1903880	1905720	The main character Jensen interacts with
1905720	1907160	in the game is Farida Malik,
1907160	1908560	Sarif Industries pilot.
1908560	1909840	When you leave for the first level,
1909840	1912320	she asks how you feel about coming back into work.
1912320	1913680	When you get back to her afterwards,
1913680	1915640	she asks for your take on the events of the mission,
1915640	1917320	and as soon as you land, she asks you
1917320	1919120	how you feel about being augmented.
1919120	1920440	You get a lot of opportunities
1920440	1921960	to choose what to say to Malik.
1921960	1924200	Getting to make the choices is nice,
1924200	1926240	but none of this does anything.
1926240	1928280	Malik maybe gets annoyed in reply
1928280	1929520	to the thing you just said,
1929520	1932560	but it doesn't have any wider effect.
1932560	1935000	These choices aren't here to give you control
1935000	1936960	over a relationship with a character.
1936960	1938920	They're here to make you feel like
1938920	1940440	you have that kind of control.
1940440	1942440	The game just briefly pretends
1942440	1944000	to be Mass Effect sometimes,
1944000	1946160	but with hexagons instead of a wheel.
1946160	1948920	I think people should stop asking me so many questions.
1948920	1950400	Then about two minutes later,
1950400	1951800	the player is asked by someone else
1951800	1953480	how he feels about being augmented.
1953480	1955880	How do you handle all of this?
1955880	1958680	It's the pretend players are making choices trick
1958680	1960440	so nice they used it twice.
1960440	1961840	This time is special, though,
1961840	1963440	because he says the line.
1963440	1968080	♪ ♪
1968080	1969200	I never asked for this.
1969200	1970280	Yeah!
1970280	1971920	People were waiting with bated breath
1971920	1974080	to see if Adam says the line from the trailer.
1974080	1975480	I'm so glad they put it in there.
1975480	1977480	A bunch of other stuff in the trailers didn't.
1977480	1980000	Corporations have more power than the government.
1980000	1983000	That's the most political thing Adam Jensen says.
1983000	1985040	I want to play the game this was a trailer for.
1985040	1987040	Oh, sweet. It's the cursed trailer
1987040	1988200	version of this scene.
1989200	1991880	This face haunts my nightmares.
1991880	1994520	In many RPGs, how you talk to other characters
1994520	1996040	affects how they feel about you,
1996040	1999160	impacts the story, or comes back up in some way, you know?
1999160	2001120	What if I told you that at no point
2001120	2003920	do any dialogue choices you ever make
2003920	2006200	affect anything other than the character's
2006200	2007480	immediate reaction?
2007480	2009240	There's a part where you can optionally help her
2009240	2011360	unravel the death of one of her best friends
2011360	2012800	and catch the real killer.
2012800	2015240	What effect does this have on your relationship?
2015240	2016840	She goes, thanks,
2016880	2018800	and you never hear about it again.
2018800	2020240	What if, for example,
2020240	2022680	Adam could be a real piece of shit to his pilot
2022680	2024480	and she stopped being friendly with him
2024480	2026120	or didn't ask for his help later
2026120	2028240	or straight up refused to work with him
2028240	2030080	and he got assigned a worse pilot
2030080	2032600	who didn't make small talk for the rest of the game?
2032600	2036160	Instead, you get to pick angry, happy, or ambivalent,
2036160	2038040	and she goes, okay,
2038040	2040080	and the game continues like nothing happened.
2040080	2041840	Your pilot will still be your friend
2041840	2044240	and still ask for your help in a later side quest
2044240	2045920	no matter how you treat her.
2045920	2047920	Even when you technically have a choice,
2047920	2050920	it only accentuates how little control you're being given.
2050920	2052240	So what do you want me to do, boss?
2052240	2054520	Take the mission to break into a police station morgue
2054520	2056960	and find the hacker's delicious brain chips.
2056960	2058760	You get this mission via your boss
2058760	2060680	literally ordering you to do it.
2060680	2063160	Get over to the station and find a way inside.
2063160	2065320	Contact me when you've gotten a hold of it.
2065320	2067840	But this is a modern RPG with dialogue options,
2067840	2069640	so you're given the option of saying,
2069640	2073160	hey, you're ordering me to do a really big crime here, right?
2073160	2074560	What you're asking me to do,
2074560	2076560	it's not exactly legal.
2076560	2079280	No, it isn't.
2079280	2080600	You got a problem with that?
2080600	2082960	You can make Adam say he's not happy about,
2082960	2085080	you know, robbing a police station,
2085080	2087120	but the response is, too bad.
2087120	2089440	That's the game, idiot.
2089440	2091720	Yes, but... but nothing.
2091720	2093000	So get going.
2093000	2094720	The creators wanted to do a mission
2094720	2096640	where you have to get into a police station.
2096640	2098080	That's fine, and you have a lot of options
2098080	2099080	for how to do that,
2099080	2100840	but games which use dialogue like this
2100840	2102440	usually offer different outcomes
2102440	2104000	for making different choices.
2104000	2106080	If this was Mass Effect or Fallout,
2106080	2108840	you could talk your boss into trying a different approach
2108840	2110560	for getting the information he needs,
2110560	2112560	or alternatively, you could just not offer
2112560	2113840	the illusion of a choice.
2113840	2115960	If Adam had just said of his own accord,
2115960	2118120	I don't like it, but I see how it's the only option,
2118120	2120280	and moved on, it wouldn't have been a problem.
2120280	2122240	JC spoke for himself all the time.
2122240	2124040	You're making the limits of the player's role
2124040	2125720	in the story really obvious
2125720	2127680	when their big choice in dialogue
2127680	2129920	amounts to how willingly their character
2129920	2132160	agrees to commit a crime.
2132160	2135600	Adam Jensen is an ex-cop who doesn't play by the rules,
2135600	2137400	whether he likes it or not.
2137400	2139280	Instead of you getting to make the choices,
2139280	2141040	there's another character in the story
2141040	2142760	making them for you.
2142760	2144480	Cutscene Jensen.
2144480	2145640	At numerous points,
2145640	2148040	Adam either does something very stupid
2148040	2149240	without you having a choice
2149240	2150480	because the plot demands it,
2150480	2152720	or worse, he does something really cool
2152720	2154760	it would have been fun to actually play.
2154760	2155920	There's one sequence later
2155920	2157680	where the player plants a bomb on a desk.
2157680	2160320	Luckily, they built the desk with a large glowing spot
2160360	2162480	for in case someone needs to plant a bomb.
2162480	2163880	They do those at Ikea now.
2163880	2165000	Now, this is a setup
2165000	2167040	to a potentially thrilling gameplay sequence
2167040	2169360	where the player has to escape the explosion in time
2169360	2172360	or find cover and capitalize on the distraction
2172360	2173640	caused by the explosion,
2173640	2176320	but instead it cuts to a video of Jensen doing it.
2176320	2178000	♪♪
2178000	2179000	Shit.
2179000	2181920	♪♪
2181920	2182920	I'm not gonna lie, though.
2182920	2185720	This does look really fun and tense.
2185720	2187520	It would have been really fun to play it.
2187520	2190680	♪♪
2190680	2192440	The cutscene continues for another, like,
2192440	2195280	minute and a half as Jensen hides from the guards
2195280	2198080	and then he decides to hide in a shipping container,
2198080	2201200	finds a cryogenic pod in the shipping container,
2201200	2203800	and then decides to just climb into it for some reason.
2203800	2206440	This is how you find out this pod exists, by the way.
2206440	2207920	He just finds it and gets in it,
2207920	2212000	and then he wakes up on a secret base a few days later.
2212000	2214760	Oh. Well, that's cool.
2214760	2216960	Couldn't the objective for the player have been
2216960	2218240	to trigger that explosion
2218240	2220280	and then get into the pod themselves?
2220280	2222960	Like, that could have been a really fun mission.
2222960	2225600	We just got to watch our guy have fun.
2225600	2227040	Like, what?
2227040	2229680	A pretty standard rule of games is that if something cool
2229680	2232760	happens in the story, the player should get to do it.
2232760	2234720	Warren Spector, the director of Deus Ex,
2234720	2237400	did a post-mortem on the game at GDC a few years back
2237400	2240400	and somewhat jokingly listed the ten commandments he had
2240400	2241640	when he was developing the game,
2241640	2244520	and one of them was to let players do the cool stuff.
2244560	2246240	If something is cool,
2246240	2248960	don't even think about letting an NPC do it.
2248960	2250440	Players do the cool stuff.
2250440	2253200	NPCs watch the player do the cool stuff.
2253200	2255280	I like to describe the first Deus Ex
2255280	2257360	as surprisingly linear.
2257360	2259200	Since the player is always the one
2259200	2261600	doing the important things with no cut scenes
2261600	2264960	doing it for them, you always feel like the driving force
2264960	2267160	of the story even though technically you're just
2267160	2269040	completing an objective someone gave you.
2269040	2271240	So when all the most pivotal moments in the game
2271240	2274200	consist of Adam doing the cool stuff while you watch,
2274200	2276240	which occasionally pauses to ask you
2276240	2277880	if you'd like to do something else
2277880	2279400	before forcing you anyway,
2279400	2281680	you start to feel like a non-player character.
2281680	2283520	In the game that you're playing,
2283520	2285320	some of Human Revolution's potentially
2285320	2287200	best playable moments take the form
2287200	2289920	of heavily compressed 720p video files.
2289920	2292320	After making his way to the CEO of the corporation
2292320	2294960	that might have murdered his co-workers and loved ones,
2294960	2296960	a cut scene plays where she tries to shoot him
2296960	2297960	and he disarms her.
2297960	2298960	Then there's some back and forth,
2298960	2301520	and a few seconds later, he turns his back on her
2301520	2303280	and gives her the opportunity to trick him
2303280	2304400	and lock him out of the room
2304400	2306120	and send, like, 12 guys after him.
2306120	2309240	Men never fail to underestimate women.
2309240	2311400	Oh-ho-ho-ho! Gender!
2311400	2314040	You spend hours getting to the executive suite
2314040	2315080	of this corporation.
2315080	2316560	You put in all this work,
2316560	2319240	and then cut scene Jensen just...oops.
2319240	2322000	Situations where the player has no chance to react,
2322000	2325000	uh, in the Deus Ex world are bad.
2325000	2326520	Shit!
2326520	2328840	You can't have contrived developments like this
2328840	2331080	without seriously affecting the player's sense
2331080	2333040	they have any say in the story.
2333040	2335920	This segment is especially easy to recognize as a problem
2335920	2338800	because it has a beat-for-beat equivalent in Deus Ex 1,
2338800	2341360	meaning we can directly compare the two.
2341360	2344880	When JC Denton goes after his game's female CEO
2344880	2346800	of a large Chinese biotech corporation
2346800	2349040	which seems to be part of the conspiracy,
2349040	2350720	wow, they just copied that, didn't they?
2350720	2352080	The character welcomes you in
2352080	2354160	and tells you a fairly compelling story
2354160	2355680	about being friends with your brother
2355680	2358320	and which faction is responsible for the current problems.
2358320	2360520	You have to figure out what to do next
2360520	2361560	with that information.
2361600	2363600	If you believe her and follow her objective,
2363600	2365720	she goes into hiding and the job she gives you
2365720	2368200	turns out to be basically a trap to kill you.
2368200	2370520	Yeah, breaking into a Hong Kong police station
2370520	2372680	looking for evidence they supposedly covered up.
2372680	2374840	That's not a recipe for getting exploded.
2374840	2377960	The player gets to actively decide whether to trust her.
2377960	2380120	If they did, they have to have a lightsaber fight with her
2380120	2382840	when they run into her again because this game is so cool.
2382840	2384320	And she died.
2384320	2385840	Ah!
2385840	2387920	Or they can snoop around some more in her apartment
2387920	2390400	and find the entire secret base in her home.
2390400	2393840	Or they can just, like, shoot her, like, right away
2393840	2395280	or snipe her from another building
2395280	2396360	without ever talking to her.
2396360	2397880	Throw a bomb through her window.
2397880	2400200	I just want to observe for a second
2400200	2401680	that in the original Deus Ex,
2401680	2404000	breaking into a police station is a trap
2404000	2406080	to try to kill you that was meant to sound
2406080	2408480	so ridiculous you realize you're being tricked
2408480	2410200	and choose to do something else,
2410200	2413160	but in Human Revolution, it's the only option you have
2413160	2416400	to progress the story and you cannot say no.
2416400	2418040	Players being able to make choices
2418040	2420200	and express themselves would get in the way
2420200	2421960	of the amazing movie the creators
2421960	2423000	wished they were making.
2423000	2424680	Spoilers, they want this character
2424680	2426120	to be the final boss,
2426120	2428840	so you have no choice but to sit and watch Adam
2428840	2430760	delay the plot by ten more hours.
2430760	2432800	This problem bleeds into the gameplay.
2432800	2434520	While there's often a degree of choice
2434520	2435720	in how you solve problems,
2435720	2438040	the consequences of your choices are meaningless
2438040	2440400	because the story wasn't designed to account for them.
2440400	2442840	You can recover the neural hub from the police station
2442840	2445360	by, well, annihilating it.
2445360	2447400	You don't have to bother with talking your way in
2447400	2450400	by absolving a cop of the guilt of the child he killed
2450400	2452160	or sneaking in via the side entrance
2452160	2453520	or the roof or the sewers.
2453520	2455560	You can also go in guns blazing.
2455560	2457480	Make a real hog roast of a building
2457480	2460520	full of human beings and the cops interrogating them too.
2460520	2463400	This is a refreshing New Vegas-esque level
2463400	2466280	of freedom to be given in how to deal with a situation.
2466280	2469320	100% coolest level in the game in terms of player freedom.
2469320	2471200	I mean, look how many cops you can kill.
2471200	2473000	How could it possibly be a bad level?
2473000	2474000	You'll see!
2474000	2478000	♪ ♪
2478000	2480800	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
2480800	2482600	This fucking clown car office.
2482600	2484000	What the fuck is this?
2484000	2485160	What, were they guarding this vent?
2485160	2487040	The problem with this level is the effect
2487040	2490040	these choices have or rather should have.
2490040	2491960	Like, this would be a big deal, right?
2491960	2495200	We were just caught on camera killing a lot of people.
2495200	2497200	This is one of the top ten mass shootings
2497200	2498920	in America this week.
2498920	2500560	Our face should be on the news.
2500560	2501640	We'd be a wanted man.
2501640	2503560	Sarif Industries would have to fire us
2503560	2506360	and issue a public apology for giving us both the arms
2506360	2508160	and the arms to do it with.
2508160	2510480	The debate on if augmentations should be legal
2510480	2511480	would shift a bit.
2511480	2513520	I'm not an expert on video game storytelling
2513520	2516980	but something should happen as a result of this, right?
2516980	2519440	Boss, I got the neural hub.

2526320	2527940	and there's no wanted posters.
2527940	2530200	The cops are friendly. Nothing has happened.
2530200	2532800	But then what if you learned to like the taste of bacon
2532800	2533800	and keep going?
2533800	2536000	What if you continue to fight cops in the street,
2536000	2538420	blow up their mechs, snipe them, explode them,
2538420	2541040	just fucking go to town on an entire police force?
2541040	2542620	You want to know what happens then?
2542620	2545120	When you get done with a quest in a convention center,
2545120	2547760	on your way out, a cop approaches you
2547760	2550540	with a side quest to help the police.
2550540	2552920	Adam, I need you to trust me on this.
2552920	2554660	You've got to help me find Jacob.
2554660	2557300	They need help stopping a terrorist who hates cops.
2557300	2559000	No, they're talking about someone else.
2559020	2560060	You get offered this quest
2560060	2561560	when you leave the convention center
2561560	2563260	even if you have killed every cop
2563260	2565060	you've ever seen so far in the game.
2565060	2567480	They're really short-staffed because of the riots
2567480	2569940	which is why they need outside help from an ex-cop.
2569940	2572700	The fact Adam is a big reason why they're short-staffed
2572700	2574440	doesn't cost him the job apparently.
2574440	2575900	Just think about that.
2575900	2578240	You can do an actual mass murder
2578240	2580360	and get deputized by the survivors
2580360	2583580	to catch a psychopath with a fraction of your body count.
2583580	2586080	The game feels almost embarrassed about it too
2586080	2588380	since accounting for how each player dealt
2588380	2590920	with the police station would have required a lot of work.
2590920	2592640	On your second visit to Detroit,
2592640	2594420	the police station is completely closed
2594420	2595720	and you can't even go in.
2595720	2597300	There's no two ways around it.
2597300	2598560	This is cheating.
2598560	2600520	They're dodging the responsibility
2600520	2603260	of doing anything with the choices they gave the player.
2603260	2605320	The best you get is if you do tenderize
2605320	2607900	the Gammon Warehouse, a newspaper in the next level
2607900	2610660	says, massacre at police station or something.
2610660	2612520	This newspaper is so easy to miss,
2612520	2615080	I didn't get any footage of it during this playthrough.
2615080	2618000	So if you blink, you miss the consequences
2618000	2620900	of going to war with the Detroit PD.
2620900	2623960	The effects of your choices fade away once you make them.
2623960	2625840	Look, nature is healing.
2625840	2628000	The cops are right back patrolling the streets
2628000	2629540	I killed their buddies in.
2629540	2631920	You see those guns on the ground?
2631920	2634420	Those are the guns the guys I killed on my way in
2634420	2635840	dropped when I murdered them.
2635840	2637380	The game treats the player's choices
2637380	2639480	about violence extremely weirdly,
2639480	2642300	forgiving you for even the most extreme acts of terror...
2642300	2645940	-...but also making sure
2645960	2649180	you can't play the game truly peacefully either.
2649180	2651880	I mean, let me just read you one of the game's achievements.
2651880	2653600	Ahem, pacifist.
2653600	2655800	Complete Deus Ex Human Revolution
2655800	2659680	without anyone dying by your hand.
2659680	2661320	Boss fights do not count.
2662220	2669220	-♪♪
2669220	2674220	-♪♪
2674220	2679220	-♪♪
2679220	2684220	-♪♪
2684220	2689220	-♪♪
2689220	2694220	-♪♪
2694220	2699220	-♪♪
2699220	2704220	-♪♪
2704220	2709220	-♪♪
2709220	2710520	Now, it might just be me,
2710520	2712520	but the standards for pacifism have really sli...
2712520	2714020	Wait, that guy's still alive. Get him!
2714020	2716020	-♪♪
2716020	2718020	It's important to stress here that Deus Ex
2718020	2720200	never did anything like this.
2720200	2722400	Technically speaking, it only had cut scenes
2722400	2723660	when you got into a plane
2723660	2725320	and were traveling to the next level
2725320	2726780	and I guess the endings too.
2726780	2729280	Everything else was either gameplay or dialogue.
2729280	2732660	At no point does JC Denton do something of his own accord.
2732660	2734000	He's the player's avatar.
2734000	2736280	He's meant to be an expression of your choices.
2736280	2738160	Meanwhile, no matter how peaceful
2738160	2739700	you make Adam Jensen behave,
2739700	2741380	there's still going to be a cut scene
2741400	2743400	where he tries to shoot a woman in the chest.
2743400	2745780	-♪♪
2745780	2746780	Pacifist.
2746780	2748040	There's a bit of a disconnect here
2748040	2749740	in terms of how much control the player has
2749740	2750740	is what I'm saying.
2750740	2751740	It's always insulting
2751740	2752920	to not have a choice in something
2752920	2755340	or be congratulated for not doing something
2755340	2757080	that you literally have to do,
2757080	2759220	but what's even worse is when a game tells you
2759220	2760800	you're going to be given a choice
2760800	2762260	and then just forgets.
2762260	2764060	There's one incredibly strange part
2764060	2766060	where the second boss character, Rihanna,
2766060	2767520	is heavily injured from the fight
2767520	2769520	and Jensen is asked if he will help her.
2769540	2771540	-"Her life signs are fading.
2771540	2774540	Will you save her?"
2774540	2775660	-"I'll think about it."
2775660	2777760	But then she just quietly dies
2777760	2780000	and is a corpse once the cut scene is over.
2780000	2782300	There is a dog barking.
2782300	2784100	Apparently in an early draft of the game,
2784100	2786260	the player got to decide if they killed bosses
2786260	2788680	after defeating them and then they decided not to
2788680	2791440	or weren't able to add this mechanic for whatever reason.
2791440	2795320	-"The script kind of implies that she's not dead yet
2795320	2797020	and are you going to save her?
2797020	2801120	Initially, we had wanted to have the, um,
2801120	2805160	the final blow for the bosses was up to the player
2805160	2807540	to decide whether he was going to do it or not
2807540	2808660	and when the cut scene's over,
2808660	2811200	the player could end up, uh, killing her,
2811200	2814160	but in truth, we kind of lost that
2814160	2816800	in the process of our production
2816800	2818580	and we never did change the lines."
2818580	2820180	After the next boss fight, the guy's like,
2820180	2822300	ugh, finish it because he's a badass.
2822300	2823260	That's his character, right?
2823260	2824720	And Jensen's like, not until you tell me
2824720	2826340	what I need to know and then he dies anyway
2826340	2827580	like a second later.
2827580	2830080	You can smell the point in the cut scene
2830080	2832080	where a moral choice would have gone
2832080	2834340	and then, well, they kind of lost that
2834340	2836460	in the process of their production.
2836460	2839260	I think that's a diplomatic way of saying
2839260	2841640	they didn't finish the game.
2841640	2843600	This lack of control over the story
2843600	2845680	to the extent players are being told
2845680	2847400	they're going to get some choices
2847400	2848900	which they are then not given
2848900	2850780	makes the story start to feel flat
2850780	2852980	and like you're not really taking part in it.
2852980	2855780	Now to be clear, the game isn't completely devoid
2855800	2857440	of branching story choices.
2857440	2859480	At one point near the end, you get shot down
2859480	2861140	and if you don't kill a couple guys,
2861140	2862320	the pilot is killed.
2862320	2864180	It's intended as a reference to the original
2864180	2865900	where your pilot can also die,
2865900	2867740	but in Deus Ex, it's an excuse
2867740	2869900	for investigation and subterfuge.
2869900	2872120	You have to find the corpse of a mechanic
2872120	2873540	and wonder what's up with that.
2873540	2876120	Notice the weird guy also dressed as a mechanic?
2876120	2877460	I fixed her right up for you.
2877460	2879380	And kill him or report him to his boss.
2879380	2880880	That mechanic was an imposter.
2880880	2882840	Oh, my God, JC, a bomb.
2882840	2883840	A bomb.
2883860	2885780	You can completely miss all of this
2885780	2886980	if you're not paying attention,
2886980	2888160	and if you do miss it,
2888160	2890540	hours and hours later on the last level,
2890540	2892320	your pilot's copter explodes
2892320	2893920	and you don't really know why.
2893920	2896200	This is part of the subtle beauty of the original.
2896200	2897460	The game doesn't make it clear
2897460	2899460	how much control you have sometimes,
2899460	2900760	so when this happens,
2900760	2902960	you get to wonder if you could have saved him.
2902960	2905460	There's tons of minor ways the story can change
2905460	2907380	that some players don't even know about
2907380	2909980	and only find out about on forums years later.
2909980	2911480	This isn't quite as special
2911480	2913020	when it's shoot all of these guys
2913040	2914360	or your pilot dies now.
2914360	2915780	Also, the way the game accounts
2915780	2917120	for her death just sucks.
2917120	2919540	If you save her, she later heroically flies in
2919540	2920540	to knock out some guys
2920540	2922200	and save the scientists you rescued,
2922200	2924000	but if she dies, obviously this means
2924000	2925000	she doesn't turn up,
2925000	2926880	so there's some serious story implications
2926880	2928220	for the survival of these scientists.
2928220	2930180	Just kidding, an aircraft is on the landing pad now
2930180	2932180	for no reason, and they fly it out.
2932180	2933180	What?
2933180	2934920	They could have made Farida Malek's death
2934920	2936340	have interesting consequences,
2936340	2938140	and they just don't.
2938140	2939340	They just don't.
2939340	2941640	There is one really good story choice
2941640	2942640	in the game, though.
2942680	2944520	See you soon, Mr. Jensen.
2944520	2946180	Ooh.
2946180	2948360	Partway through, you start having minor glitches,
2948360	2949940	and it becomes clear it's affecting
2949940	2951440	other augmented people too.
2951440	2953020	You all have them at once even.
2953020	2955020	Ooh.
2955020	2956020	I like how it's done too,
2956020	2958060	these minor mutual freak outs
2958060	2960280	where everyone gets injured and confused.
2960280	2962320	This is some pretty neat storytelling actually.
2962320	2964780	Uh, well, it's still pretty good.
2964780	2966280	Anyway, you get a side objective
2966280	2968540	to replace the defective chip causing this.
2968540	2970120	If you go to a clinic, the game goes,
2970120	2971460	are you sure you want to do this?
2971480	2973900	As if to say, hey, you're making a big choice here,
2973900	2975660	and for once, you are.
2975660	2977740	If you get the replacement then in a later level
2977740	2978740	before a boss fight,
2978740	2980280	the lady from before flips a switch
2980280	2981320	and you have to fight the boss
2981320	2982740	with your screen all fuzzy.
2982740	2985120	Wow, my choices affected the story.
2985120	2987960	If you think this is the smartest thing in the game,
2987960	2990660	I'm very sorry to tell you that you are correct.
2990660	2992300	It is. There's another little way
2992300	2994040	the plot can kind of branch actually.
2994040	2995720	If you wait around at your HQ
2995720	2997180	before going to their first mission,
2997180	2999300	your boss yells at you to get to the helipad.
2999300	3000800	Helipad. And eventually,
3000820	3002240	the hostages you could have saved
3002240	3004440	in that mission are dead before you get there.
3004440	3006360	Christ, Adam, while you were strolling around
3006360	3008620	the offices, the situation got worse.
3008620	3009900	Wait a second, though.
3009900	3012400	The game just dropped me in a new level
3012400	3013820	full of people to talk to
3013820	3015920	and then yelled at me to ignore all of it
3015920	3017920	to get to the mission as fast as I can?
3017920	3019620	Yeah, I really have the sense that time
3019620	3021620	is of the essence in human revolution.
3022620	3023620	Oh my God.
3023620	3025080	Did you ever think about how, like,
3025080	3027500	the myth of Icarus is about transhumanism?
3027500	3029120	Like, with the wings?
3029120	3030540	No, I didn't.
3030540	3033800	A-Adam, that's... that's really stupid.
3033800	3036180	You see? This is why we broke up.
3036180	3038680	I still can't believe you don't like Ghost in the Shell.
3038680	3041100	Oh my God, are you guys talking about Ghost in the Shell?
3041100	3044220	That is one of the most important movies ever made.
3044220	3045640	I mean, it's a good movie.
3045640	3046640	It's a good movie.
3046640	3047640	It's a good movie.
3047640	3048640	It's a good movie.
3048640	3049640	It's a good movie.
3049640	3050640	It's a good movie.
3050660	3051840	It's one of the best movies ever made.
3051840	3053340	I cannot wait to see it.
3053340	3056000	This is a game that just made you unskippably
3056000	3058880	go on a walking tour of a floor of this building.
3058880	3060840	They took their sweet fucking time.
3060840	3061840	Why can't I?
3061840	3064140	I mean, the guy's name is Bateau.
3064140	3066260	The French word for boat.
3066260	3068640	And he owns a boat?
3068640	3070320	Ah, come on.
3070320	3071820	We don't know he owns the boat.
3071820	3073140	That's not in the wiki.
3073140	3075280	This game does not get to say,
3075280	3076560	hey, we're on the clock here
3076560	3079280	after slapping you in the face with this opening.
3079300	3081680	Fuck you if you think this is clever.
3081680	3084060	Sorry. No, that's a joke.
3084060	3085480	This is pretty clever,
3085480	3087760	but for that to be one of the few times
3087760	3089680	the story is affected by your choices
3089680	3090980	is just insulting.
3090980	3092600	I think the worst thing about all this
3092600	3094480	is how promising it manages to be
3094480	3096700	about its characters and choices at times.
3096700	3099160	There's a blueprint in here for a fantastic story
3099160	3101620	with all kinds of little choices like this one.
3101620	3103900	The couple you can save at the manufacturing plant
3103900	3105200	are a great example too,
3105200	3108000	but I especially like the way Zeke Sanders is used.
3108040	3109500	Not because the pre-rendered cutscene
3109500	3111340	is just that cool and badass,
3111340	3113460	but because eventually the cutscene ends
3113460	3115720	and you get to be involved in the story.
3115720	3117720	If you knock him out, he's in the police station
3117720	3119560	talking about how he'll be out soon anyway
3119560	3121020	because he has powerful friends.
3121020	3122180	I won't be here long.
3122180	3123880	If you killed him, he's in the morgue
3123880	3126100	next to the guy whose neural hub you need.
3126100	3128180	If you let him go, he later contacts you
3128180	3129900	and gives you some information in return,
3129900	3131760	like he feels like he owes you one.
3131760	3133180	My debt is paid.
3133180	3135600	It's really neat how different your relationship
3135620	3138420	with this one guy can get based on what you did.
3138420	3140600	Way later in the game, if he survived all this,
3140600	3142720	he's a hostile NPC during the mission
3142720	3145260	to go after a guy who, it turns out, surprise twist,
3145260	3147520	is actually his brother, Sanders.
3147520	3148720	Sanderses?
3148720	3150400	Ezekiel's impact on the story
3150400	3152060	is minimal after the first encounter.
3152060	3153440	He could die right here
3153440	3155360	so they can't make him too important,
3155360	3157240	but he's what you really want to see
3157240	3158360	from a game like this.
3158360	3160400	Characters who react to your choices
3160400	3163540	and feel like their own pieces of a larger world.
3163560	3166360	I hate to say it, but very few other characters
3166360	3168020	are as well thought out as this.
3168020	3169560	Take his brother I just mentioned.
3169560	3171740	Isaiah Sandoval is a high-ranking member
3171740	3173980	of a different, non-terrorist-y
3173980	3175620	anti-augmentation group.
3175620	3176900	You meet him a few levels in
3176900	3179000	and you can argue with him about augmentations,
3179000	3180960	although none of it affects the story at all.
3180960	3182320	It's just optional dialogue.
3182320	3184000	Later, he shows up in a recording
3184000	3185880	interacting with the guys who shot you
3185880	3188300	and killed slash kidnapped your friends.
3188300	3189300	I know this guy.
3189300	3190420	When you get to Sandoval,
3190420	3193220	he tells you what he knows then tries to shoot you,
3193240	3195280	but if you found out his location
3195280	3198020	by publicly implicating him in the conspiracy
3198020	3199280	in front of his boss,
3199280	3201860	his boss basically pins everything on him,
3201860	3203540	so instead, once you get here,
3203540	3205960	he's distraught and decides to kill himself
3205960	3207420	as penance for his crimes,
3207420	3209580	which he feels genuine guilt over.
3209580	3211620	You get the chance to try to talk him down
3211620	3214460	over the course of a deeply engaging conversation,
3214460	3215960	and for a few minutes,
3215960	3219000	everything about this game really works.
3219000	3222420	Sandoval feels like a character with a real inner life
3222460	3224540	who we have to speak to like a person,
3224540	3226340	and we're only having this conversation
3226340	3228000	in the first place because of the effects
3228000	3229500	of another choice we made.
3229500	3232180	This is a perfectly sculpted piece
3232180	3233640	of a really good game.
3233640	3234960	It's one of the reasons why this game
3234960	3237300	is worth talking about because it's disheartening
3237300	3240260	that the game is missing the rest of the pieces.
3240260	3242060	Firstly, this character isn't someone
3242060	3244020	you got to deal with in any particularly
3244020	3245640	meaningful way beforehand.
3245640	3249060	You met him once for five seconds half a game ago.
3249060	3250860	Instead of being the culmination
3250880	3253100	of a relationship between two characters,
3253100	3255020	it's just a really resonant moment
3255020	3257480	in the middle of a story that's become a bit of a mess
3257480	3259520	which you had little to no say in,
3259520	3262020	and worse, now the game is done with him,
3262020	3265520	he instantly exits the story and is never seen again.
3265520	3267820	Sandoval already told you everything you need to know
3267820	3269820	in the cut scene before this standoff,
3269820	3272740	so if you talk him down or if he kills himself
3272740	3275160	or if you talk him down and then kill him for fun
3275160	3277660	or if none of this happened and this room was just a fight...
3277660	3278660	Ow.
3278660	3280080	It doesn't change anything.
3280100	3281940	The story is not affected in any way
3281940	3283400	by any of these outcomes.
3283400	3284680	This character's survival,
3284680	3286680	especially considering you can convince him
3286680	3288520	to turn on the other conspirators
3288520	3289740	and come out with the truth,
3289740	3292160	should have interesting plot implications.
3292160	3294160	His death or survival should have had an impact
3294160	3295360	on what sort of ending you get.
3295360	3296360	Oh, God, don't get me started.
3296360	3298280	But once you're done, he just sits there.
3298280	3300960	His part in the story is completed now.
3300960	3303160	You don't need to wait with me, Mr. Jensen.
3303160	3305740	I will not resist my fate when it arrives.
3305740	3306740	Yeah, get out of here.
3306740	3308780	I need to sit here for a week
3308780	3309780	so I don't have a chance
3309780	3311620	to introduce consequences to the plot.
3311620	3313320	It's just kind of weird that you introduce
3313320	3314780	some of these characters, you interact with them
3314780	3317280	a little bit, and then you never hear from him again.
3317280	3318400	What happened to that guy?
3318400	3320940	It's so easy to imagine how much better
3320940	3323780	the game could have handled its characters and choices.
3323780	3326540	Like, what if your attitude towards augmentations
3326540	3329360	in the previous meeting affected how Sandoval treated you
3329360	3330360	once you found him?
3330360	3331860	Like, if you seemed amenable
3331860	3333660	to anti-augmentation arguments,
3333660	3335660	he saw you as a potential friend here
3335660	3337480	and trusted you with the information
3337480	3339600	because he figured you'd do the right thing with it?
3339600	3342560	What if, just a thought, how you treated his brother
3342560	3344560	the last three times you ran into him
3344560	3346180	affected his feelings about you?
3346180	3349100	The fact you literally shot his brother to death
3349100	3352060	or let him go during an armed standoff
3352060	3354020	somehow never comes up.
3354020	3355720	What if turning him against his boss
3355720	3358280	had some really cool or meaningful consequence
3358280	3360680	so the player feels like they really did something?
3360680	3362600	Like, I'm not saying the story has to branch
3362600	3365100	in some huge way, but do something.
3365100	3367320	Maybe he gives you the key to his gun cabinet
3367320	3368700	and it's full of weapon upgrades
3368700	3370580	or those grenades he apparently had on him.
3370580	3372160	Literally the only difference
3372160	3374480	is a newspaper says something different
3374480	3376480	and I guess you get more experience points
3376480	3377700	for talking him down.
3377700	3380780	This is especially weird because Deus Ex had a knack
3380780	3383440	for remembering things you did and having them come up later.
3383440	3386240	The first level of this game also had a hostage to save,
3386240	3388660	one of many direct parallels between the games,
3388660	3390660	and whether you bothered to save him or not
3390660	3393240	affects how he feels about you for the rest of the game.
3393240	3395160	I have seen that he knows the procedure
3395160	3396580	of a good offensive.
3396620	3398660	I will not forget a favor.
3398660	3400340	Even when he becomes a boss fight,
3400340	3402620	he'll still have a grudging respect for you.
3402620	3405620	I regret that only once we worked together.
3405620	3407500	You came all the way to Paris to tell me that?
3407500	3409300	You can walk in on a guy asking a doctor
3409300	3410920	for maintenance advice and learn he has
3410920	3412420	the same augmentations as you.
3412420	3415340	The fact you did this comes up 20 hours later
3415340	3416340	when you fight him.
3416340	3418300	If you recall our chat in the break room
3418300	3420840	at UNATCO, you know that I have
3420840	3423500	the same augmentation technology as you.
3423500	3425260	Then this will be a good fight.
3425260	3427180	All I'm saying is it would have been nice
3427180	3429400	if Sandoval acknowledged something as important
3429400	3431640	as whether I killed his brother or not.
3431640	3433240	That's not too much to ask, is it?
3433240	3434980	This whole cutscene, I was waiting for him
3434980	3436940	to say something, but no.
3436940	3440060	The game cares so little for how this scene works out
3440060	3442820	that no matter what happens, one second later,
3442820	3444940	Adam makes an identical phone call.
3444940	3446320	I see you!
3446320	3447740	Richard, get this.
3447740	3449540	The GPLs are still transmitting.
3449540	3451540	Sandoval switched them to a lower frequency.
3451540	3453040	Take the gun.
3453040	3454040	You win.
3455260	3457460	Richard, get this.
3457460	3458460	Forgive me.
3458460	3460180	-$%&!
3460180	3461500	Richard, get this.
3461500	3462840	Hey, Richard, a guy just killed himself
3462840	3464420	right in front of me. Anyway, check this out.
3464420	3467180	Couldn't you at least have got a few different takes?
3467180	3470020	Oh, Sandoval, you could have been so cool,
3470020	3472860	but once I leave this room, you cease to exist.
3472860	3475600	Good night, sweet prince, and may flights of angels.
3475600	3477100	Oh, that actually kill. Oh, Jesus.
3477100	3479100	Getting to make more choices like this
3479100	3481400	would have vastly improved the experience.
3481400	3483320	I hate that we didn't get a game
3483320	3484940	full of stuff like Zeke Sanders,
3484960	3486840	but after a few hours, it becomes clear
3486840	3488500	the player is less of a participant
3488500	3491420	and more a chauffeur, transporting cutscene Jensen
3491420	3493960	between opportunities to trip over his own dick.
3493960	3496140	Women never fail to underestimate men.
3496140	3497800	Oh, ho, ho, ho! Gender!
3497800	3499900	This is how a cyberpunk game
3499900	3503360	about our transhumanist future addresses gender.
3503360	3507480	Men do be shopping for augmentations.
3507480	3509560	As the story makes it increasingly clear
3509560	3512560	the person playing it is only tangentially involved,
3512560	3514520	people stop paying attention.
3514520	3516240	You don't have any say in what's happening,
3516240	3517520	so what's the point?
3517520	3519520	That's cutscene Jensen's problem.
3519520	3521160	The problem the player has to deal with
3521160	3523580	is the sweeping and often misguided changes
3523580	3525120	to the original's gameplay.
3525120	3533120	♪♪
3533120	3535540	Watch it. This one's some...
3535540	3537960	Deus Ex is a tremendously important game
3537960	3539460	in the history of the medium,
3539460	3542380	one of, if not the best of all time.
3542380	3544140	Hold on, let me... there we go.
3544140	3546220	Many designers on all types of games
3546220	3548960	cite it as a direct inspiration for their own work,
3548960	3550920	but it's been over 20 years now.
3550920	3553300	Is Deus Ex really as good as everyone remembe...
3553300	3555440	Yes, yes it is. Shut the fuck up.
3555440	3558220	There's a good reason why there's a decades-old in-joke
3558220	3561060	that every time you mention it, someone will reinstall it.
3561060	3564060	In-jokes are what people call memes when they're funny.
3564060	3565860	It's the ultimate example of a game
3565860	3567980	that's more than the sum of its parts.
3567980	3569480	That phrase gets thrown around a lot
3569480	3571660	by game critics trying to punch up their reviews
3571660	3573940	with fancy words, but this is the rare time
3573960	3575340	when it's actually true.
3575340	3577220	In post-mortems and retrospectives,
3577220	3579180	Warren Spector is delightfully open
3579180	3581460	about how right down to the wire,
3581460	3584460	mere months from release, the game just wasn't fun.
3584460	3587520	By September 1999, we were done.
3587520	3588840	Except we weren't.
3588840	3590400	The game was not good enough.
3590400	3592300	It wasn't ready to ship.
3592300	3595520	Deus Ex was made out of so many individual components
3595520	3598600	that had to not just work well, but work well together,
3598600	3601560	that it was a huge mess right up until it suddenly
3601560	3604180	became a beautiful web of interlocking systems.
3604180	3606180	So we had real people come in and play the game.
3606180	3607860	I called that particular milestone
3607860	3611100	the, wow, these missions suck, milestone.
3611100	3613780	Uh, we had a lot of work to do.
3613780	3616700	This is why this game's formula is hard to recreate
3616700	3618320	and even harder to improve on.
3618320	3621160	So many moving parts have to work with each other.
3621160	3625040	Even if a change sounds good or even is good in some contexts,
3625040	3627000	since every change affects the way
3627000	3628700	all the systems relate to each other,
3628700	3631120	it can still result in a worse game.
3631140	3633820	And immersive sims come together very late
3633820	3635820	when all of your little game systems and rules
3635820	3637780	are all working together magically
3637780	3640120	to produce this amazing experience.
3640120	3641780	The creators of Human Revolution
3641780	3644780	made a lot of big changes to these core mechanics.
3644780	3646700	Lapikus's talk contains a segment
3646700	3648920	where he summarizes the Human Revolution team's
3648920	3650960	collective criticisms of the original.
3650960	3653800	I'm about to say some negative things
3653800	3655760	about the best PC game of all times.
3655760	3657220	Now see here, buddy!
3657220	3658640	Okay, but seriously, it's really good
3658640	3660640	to take an especially critical look at a game
3660660	3662500	even if it's as beloved as the original.
3662500	3664920	You know, if you seriously want to improve on Deus Ex,
3664920	3666120	this is how you start.
3666120	3668700	The issue is what they decided were problems
3668700	3670420	and how they fixed them.
3670420	3672040	The game was designed specifically
3672040	3674000	for the PS3 and Xbox 360
3674000	3677180	with a separate company entirely handling the PC port.
3677180	3679680	The creators appear to be trying to streamline down
3679680	3682220	the Deus experience for console players,
3682220	3684840	removing many mechanics they feared wouldn't appeal
3684840	3687440	to people who don't like complicated RPGs.
3687440	3690140	Lapikus says they didn't dumb it down in his talk,
3690140	3692140	but I think we get to be the judge of that.
3692140	3693980	So obviously the first thing we should look at
3693980	3695820	is the first thing that happens in the game,
3695820	3697200	character creation.
3697200	3698900	Not Human Revolution's character creation,
3698900	3700580	of course, because, uh, there isn't any.
3700580	3703820	["Dark Souls"-style music plays in the background.]
3703820	3705580	In true RPG fashion,
3705580	3708040	Deus Ex slaps you in the face with a spreadsheet
3708040	3709660	before you can start playing.
3709660	3710660	Ow, my brain!
3710660	3711620	At least the default name
3711620	3712880	isn't Non this time.
3712880	3714380	Everyone calls you JC,
3714380	3716080	but that's just the character's code name.
3716080	3717300	You can enter a real name,
3717300	3719220	and it comes up in a few places here and there.
3719300	3720300	You Denton?
3720300	3721300	Denton's an old code name
3721300	3722500	from my UNATCO days,
3722500	3723840	but it seems to have stuck.
3723840	3725180	And even though it's a little clunky,
3725180	3727300	it's always fun to be making meaningful choices
3727300	3728480	as soon as you begin.
3728480	3730140	There's no 45-minute openings
3730140	3731860	and tutorials to get through first.
3731860	3733480	The tutorial's actually a separate thing
3733480	3734640	you can skip entirely,
3734640	3735780	and for the year 2000,
3735780	3737240	being able to choose your ethnicity
3737240	3738240	was pretty cool.
3738240	3740060	It was so nice to finally find a game
3740060	3741660	that represented my skin type.
3741660	3743660	Throughout the game, you acquired more skill points
3743660	3746040	and could level up more at any time through the menu.
3746040	3748360	It's a very rewarding system to engage with,
3748380	3750520	but you know, it's a lot of looking at numbers,
3750520	3753220	thinking, making fun decisions,
3753220	3754760	you know, boring nerd stuff.
3754760	3756260	In Lapicus's critical summary,
3756260	3759600	he calls Deus Ex a heavy management kind of game.
3759600	3760980	Oh, no, what if the gamers
3760980	3762600	see a character creation screen?
3762600	3764600	They might instantly decide the game is bad
3764600	3766100	and go back to Gears of War.
3766100	3768200	We better make it simpler just in case.
3768200	3769980	So character creation is out,
3769980	3771480	but the team were actually very smart
3771480	3772940	about how they went about this.
3772940	3774400	They still realized the importance
3774400	3776440	of getting to make choices about the character
3776660	3778660	and that sense of growth and development,
3778660	3781000	and they found a way to make that still happen
3781000	3783200	because in the first game, you were also developing
3783200	3785840	in a much more engaging way at the same time.
3785840	3787300	Throughout the world, you were finding
3787300	3788720	augmentation canisters,
3788720	3790720	which provided special, unique upgrades
3790720	3793500	to the player's abilities on a completely separate screen
3793500	3794720	from the skill point one.
3794720	3796260	So the team made a pretty clever
3796260	3798180	streamlining decision and combined
3798180	3800060	these two systems into one.
3800060	3802600	Now you do all your upgrading on one menu,
3802600	3804100	and instead of acquiring, managing,
3804100	3805600	and spending thousands of points,
3805600	3807900	you get upgrades by spending praxis points,
3807900	3809260	which are either found in the world
3809260	3811800	or given to you every time you gain enough experience.
3811800	3814140	If your goal is to simplify character progression,
3814140	3816300	this is a really obvious and smart choice.
3816300	3818520	It's less complicated and more direct.
3818520	3819940	You spend a point on a thing,
3819940	3821680	and now you can do the thing.
3821680	3823600	Whee. A lot of the more boring skills
3823600	3824520	have been removed.
3824520	3826140	Swimming? Get out of here.
3826140	3829280	Adam doesn't do any swimming in the entire game.
3829280	3831240	They streamlined the game so well,
3831240	3832940	there aren't even any streams,
3832940	3834980	but overall, I'd say all of this is pretty good.
3835020	3837280	Well, it's definitely simpler at least,
3837280	3839120	but to simplify a mechanic means
3839120	3840580	removing something from it,
3840580	3842280	and that means you risk removing
3842280	3844040	what made the thing you're simplifying
3844040	3845740	fun in the first place.
3845740	3847620	You can always improve on an old design,
3847620	3850960	but sometimes it worked that way for a reason
3850960	3853420	because here's the thing about augmentation canisters.
3853420	3855380	You didn't just get to pick an augmentation
3855380	3856460	when you found one.
3856460	3859260	Each canister had two specific abilities in it,
3859260	3861140	and you could only choose one of them.
3861140	3862420	In any given playthrough,
3862420	3865040	you only got up to half the abilities you could have.
3865040	3866740	You were building a unique character
3866740	3868160	who couldn't have everything.
3868160	3869160	In Human Revolution,
3869160	3870660	you're just picking them from a list,
3870660	3873040	and you can get all of them if you have enough points.
3873040	3874120	By the end of the game,
3874120	3877380	everyone's JC Denton was a little bit different.
3877380	3880100	Everyone's Adam Jensen is exactly the same.
3880100	3882520	He just gets there in a slightly different order.
3882520	3884220	I want to take a moment to appreciate
3884220	3886100	the original game's augmentation system
3886100	3887760	because while the experience point stuff
3887760	3889140	was a turn-off to some people,
3889140	3891180	the augs were a thing of beauty.
3891200	3892620	You see, since each canister
3892620	3894320	had only two augmentations in it
3894320	3895660	and you could only choose one,
3895660	3898920	the player was being given an extremely engaging choice.
3898920	3903120	Hey, do you want to run faster or run silently?
3903120	3905380	Because it's a choice between just two things,
3905380	3907960	it's elegant and clear and hard to get anxious
3907960	3909220	about which choice to make.
3909220	3911760	You just have to decide which you want more.
3911760	3913020	It's a binary choice.
3913020	3915480	It's literally the simplest kind of choice there is.
3915480	3917560	When you get a praxis point in Human Revolution,
3917560	3919020	the game says, great,
3919020	3921600	please pick one of 30 things to spend it on
3921600	3923520	in a huge menu full of sub-menus,
3923520	3925280	and by the way, you can't get half of them
3925280	3926980	because you actually needed two points.
3926980	3928480	For a huge portion of players,
3928480	3931160	the very first experience with the augmentation system
3931160	3933440	is finding the first point, opening a menu,
3933440	3935540	and spending several minutes reading all the things
3935540	3937540	they could do with it, realizing they need two
3937540	3938540	to get anything good,
3938540	3940240	and they have to close the menu down again
3940240	3942280	and carry on playing until they find another.
3942280	3944880	Worse, this extreme amount of things to choose from
3944880	3946700	causes a kind of decision anxiety
3946700	3948200	which never happened in the original
3948220	3949800	with its much more simple choices.
3949800	3952560	You know how tons of people play Human Revolution?
3952560	3954140	They don't spend their points.
3954140	3955760	They hoard them until they find a hole
3955760	3957600	they need the slow-fall power to get down
3957600	3959100	or a wall they want to punch
3959100	3960980	or another thing that needs an augmentation
3960980	3963520	to progress and spend the points right then and there,
3963520	3966160	so you're not really building a character anymore.
3966160	3968400	You're paying a toll once you hit a section
3968400	3969980	that needs a certain skill.
3969980	3971740	The design of the system is misleading
3971740	3973200	about how complicated it is.
3973200	3975280	This clip is of me spending 45 seconds
3975280	3977000	looking for an augmentation I wanted.
3977000	3978260	You know, the one that lets you take down
3978260	3980380	two guys at once in physical combat
3980380	3981920	using your arms?
3981920	3984060	Where would that power be?
3984060	3985680	The arm submenu?
3985680	3987020	Correct, it should be there,
3987020	3989760	but it's actually here in the back augmentations.
3989760	3992980	It has a special submenu just to itself for no reason,
3992980	3994180	and just to really fuck with you,
3994180	3996020	the take down one person augmentation
3996020	3997520	is in the arm submenu,
3997520	3999600	and you start with this one already unlocked.
3999600	4000740	Why is this here?
4000740	4002020	What are you trying to do to me?
4002020	4003020	Ow, my brain!
4003020	4004700	Wait, and carrying capacities
4004700	4005700	in the arm submenu,
4005700	4006700	but you're not holding everything
4006700	4007700	in your arms all day.
4007700	4008700	You're carrying it.
4008700	4009700	On your back!
4009700	4010700	Put it on the back augmentation!
4010700	4012240	So if the objective was to simplify
4012240	4013240	character progression,
4013240	4014860	I don't think they achieved it nearly
4014860	4015860	as well as they'd hoped.
4015860	4018360	In practice, or should I say in praxis,
4018360	4020240	this system removes the best things
4020240	4021660	about the system it's based on
4021660	4022960	in the name of a simplicity
4022960	4024620	that wasn't actually achieved.
4024620	4026080	You also have to wait a while
4026080	4028880	before you can do any character building whatsoever.
4028880	4031420	The game tries to make sure you only get
4031420	4033580	a second praxis after the standoff
4033580	4034920	at the very end of the level,
4034940	4036220	and this was done deliberately
4036220	4037600	to hide another problem.
4037600	4039520	The conversation enhancer augmentation
4039520	4041060	costs two points and lets you make
4041060	4042520	additional choices in dialogue
4042520	4044520	based on the other character's soy levels.
4044520	4045520	I'll kill you.
4045520	4046860	It's nice to have more options,
4046860	4048780	but it tells you which answer will work
4048780	4049940	using colored lights,
4049940	4052320	turning social engagement into Simon Says.
4052320	4053400	In longer conversations,
4053400	4055540	it vomits even more UI onto your screen,
4055540	4057120	which disrupts the experience.
4057120	4059280	The Sandoval sequence is much less tense
4059280	4060420	with all this stuff everywhere
4060420	4061540	telling you how to win.
4061540	4063120	Anyway, if you play the first level
4063120	4064800	in a really meticulous way,
4064800	4066760	you can get two praxis points
4066760	4068040	before meeting Sanders.
4068040	4070220	If you spend them on the conversation enhancer,
4070220	4072180	the game does a strange thing.
4072180	4074520	It only throws up some of the stuff it's supposed to,
4074520	4076680	and it doesn't give you any more dialogue options.
4076680	4079180	You can't see his alpha, beta, or omega levels.
4079180	4080440	Shit, he's a Sigma male.
4080440	4081600	Jensen, get out of there!
4081600	4083360	You see, in the original plan for the game,
4083360	4085240	you weren't able to just open a menu
4085240	4087440	and unlock augmentations at any time.
4087440	4089860	You had to go to a clinic to get them installed.
4089860	4091360	This worked as world building,
4091360	4093320	but also sucked.
4093340	4094600	Imagine finding something
4094600	4095940	you need an augmentation for,
4095940	4097940	then having to go to the doctor to get it
4097940	4099320	and come all the way back.
4099320	4101360	Later in development, the system was changed
4101360	4102480	to how it works now,
4102480	4103980	which was a clear improvement.
4103980	4105440	However, the rest of the game
4105440	4108120	had already been designed around the original system,
4108120	4109520	and you don't go to a clinic
4109520	4111040	until the first mission is over,
4111040	4113080	so the level was made assuming players
4113080	4114860	don't have any augmentations.
4114860	4117500	For example, the conversation enhancer.
4117500	4120280	Zeke's voice actor already recorded all his lines
4120280	4121800	before this change was made,
4121820	4123560	meaning there was no way his character
4123560	4125900	could react to the enhancer with new dialogue,
4125900	4128080	so to avoid too many players noticing,
4128080	4130500	they deliberately paced the game's progression
4130500	4131580	really slowly.
4131580	4133660	And at the time that we wrote it,
4133660	4137080	we didn't even have the concept of praxis kits.
4137080	4141380	You had to go to the limb clinic to get operated on,
4141380	4143000	so I think that's why we decided
4143000	4146260	not to have it initially in this conversation
4146260	4148000	because we knew you wouldn't have had a chance
4148000	4149180	to get it yet,
4149180	4152180	and later we came in with the idea of the praxis kits,
4152180	4155360	and at that point, it became this issue of,
4155360	4157680	oh, wait, we have to make sure we don't give you two
4157680	4160060	because you might have it and we don't support it.
4160060	4163360	So character progression for entire hours of the game
4163360	4166060	is almost nonexistent because they had to avoid
4166060	4167860	a scenario they hadn't planned for,
4167860	4169360	and the saddest thing about this is
4169360	4172480	the developers are obviously painfully aware of all this.
4172480	4173480	At the beginning of the game,
4173480	4176220	the pacing to get augmentations is too slow,
4176220	4178940	and it's something that we're aware of
4178940	4180360	and we're not happy with it,
4180360	4183280	but because of those decisions and with what you explained,
4183280	4186240	we were forced to keep it this way, so...
4188860	4191120	This is one of the reasons why modern big games'
4191120	4193040	production pipelines are often so rigid
4193040	4194360	in case you were interested.
4194360	4196440	When you chart an entire game in advance
4196440	4198900	and then change your mind about how something works,
4198900	4201160	you risk breaking all the stuff that was made
4201160	4202900	assuming the game worked differently.
4202900	4205400	This is an explanation but not really an excuse.
4205400	4207160	They could have just made the social enhancer
4208120	4210120	or cost three points and make it so players
4210120	4211500	could get two a bit sooner,
4211500	4213800	or hey, maybe write and record a few more lines
4213800	4215460	for one of the best characters in this thing.
4215460	4216880	That would have been really cool
4216880	4219960	but also a lot more work for the extreme edge case
4219960	4221880	of players picking this augmentation.
4221880	4224120	Cumulatively, the new augmentation system
4224120	4227840	massively affects the feel of the entire surrounding game.
4227840	4229760	In Deus Ex, the augmentation canisters
4229760	4231840	were unique, specific objects.
4231840	4233420	If you didn't find the canister
4233420	4235260	with the augmentation you wanted in it,
4235260	4236380	you never got it.
4236400	4238400	This made exploring really fun
4238400	4241280	because unique stuff you wanted could be hidden here
4241280	4242780	and finding one felt great.
4242780	4244700	It was a new set of possibilities.
4244700	4246740	The entire world was more engaging.
4246740	4247920	Do you know how I found out there was
4247920	4249420	a cloaking device in Deus Ex?
4249420	4251700	I hacked into a secret lab storage chamber
4251700	4253160	and stole their augmentations
4253160	4254740	and one of them was a cloaking device.
4254740	4256040	It felt like a discovery,
4256040	4257920	a reward for engaging with the world
4257920	4259880	and looking around and paying attention,
4259880	4262000	and then you have a cool thing for the whole game
4262000	4263220	that feels good to use
4263220	4264960	because it feels like you earned it.
4264960	4266680	In Human Revolution, the cloaking device
4266680	4268800	is staring at you in the augmentation submenu
4268800	4270560	as soon as you open it for the first time
4270560	4272140	and you can unlock it whenever you want
4272140	4273560	for two praxis points.
4273560	4276180	Is that as fun an experience?
4276180	4279020	A thing I love about games like Deus Ex and New Vegas
4279020	4280600	is the sense they're full of secrets
4280600	4282140	and new things to find.
4282140	4283740	A corner of an abandoned vault
4283740	4285480	might have a one-of-a-kind gun in it.
4285480	4287060	A safe in a terrorist hideout
4287060	4288740	has a speed enhancement in it.
4288740	4291080	When you find it, it doesn't just feel cool.
4291080	4294000	It makes you want to find and open every safe in the world
4294000	4295280	to see what else is in them.
4295280	4297460	What if instead of all of this unique,
4297460	4299740	special stuff you tangibly found,
4299740	4301840	it was just a stack of money you could spend
4301840	4304620	buying those things in a submenu or at a store?
4304620	4306420	It's not fun exploring a world
4306420	4308760	whose most high-value reward for exploring
4308760	4311140	is a floppy disk that gives you a point
4311140	4313340	you already have six of but won't spend yet
4313340	4315140	because you have to save them in case it turns out
4315140	4316140	you need something.
4316140	4317640	I guarantee you a lot of players
4317640	4320020	missed some pretty easy-to-find praxis points
4320020	4321980	because looking for them was boring.
4322000	4325380	Oh, there's a praxis point in this elevator shaft.
4325380	4326600	What an adventure.
4326600	4328840	It's not game-ruining that it works this way.
4328840	4330760	It just makes everything a lot less fun
4330760	4333260	than it could have been, and why?
4333260	4335560	In the name of making it a bit simpler?
4335560	4336980	Human Revolution is definitely
4336980	4338640	slightly more welcoming this way.
4338640	4340940	A spreadsheet doesn't appear when you hit new game,
4340940	4342560	and at no point do you need to remember
4342560	4344860	to open a menu to spend experience points
4344860	4346820	and discover you've forgotten to do so for hours
4346820	4347980	and have thousands of them now,
4347980	4349980	but this simplicity comes at the expense
4349980	4353200	of being able to make unique and personal decisions
4353200	4356120	about your character and their role in the world.
4356120	4357960	The original was far from perfect,
4357960	4360380	but many of the complications are what made it fun,
4360380	4361620	and taking those things out
4361620	4363660	isn't necessarily an improvement.
4363660	4366380	That said, they tried to improve some aspects of the game
4366380	4367880	by adding more to them,
4367880	4369800	and that isn't always a good idea either.
4369800	4372100	One of the first criticisms on Lapicus's list
4372100	4374300	is that hacking is completely passive,
4374300	4377900	so now we need to explore what he means by that.

4439680	4440720	Oh, thank you.
4440720	4442140	You see, the hacking itself
4442140	4443880	is only one piece of the puzzle.
4443880	4446020	While you're trying to manipulate this device,
4446020	4448180	people can see you trying to hack it.
4448180	4450180	Often people you might not want seeing you
4450180	4452820	like guards or the terrorists you're hiding from
4452820	4455140	or genetically engineered space aliens.
4455140	4457600	Your vision is blacked out while you're in this screen,
4457600	4459560	so if you didn't check the coast was clear,
4459560	4461360	the time it takes to hack is risky.
4461740	4463240	It's getting more and more.
4463240	4465040	Ah! Oh!
4465040	4466700	Gah!
4466700	4469700	Despite being literally just sitting and waiting,
4469700	4471380	it's strangely tense.
4471380	4473040	You committed to this.
4473040	4474960	Was that a good idea?
4474960	4477880	Sure, if the game was just a hacking simulator,
4477880	4480140	it would be terrible and not have much gameplay,
4480140	4482180	but when you're sitting there exposed
4482180	4484520	in a building full of guys who are looking for you,
4484520	4487520	hearing the camera right behind you moving back and forth,
4487520	4490020	watching that meter slowly tick down,
4490020	4491060	it's exciting.
4491100	4492440	Hacking is also a skill,
4492440	4494640	so when you level it up, it gets much faster
4494640	4497100	and you can do more things with computers you've hacked.
4497100	4498940	This means investing more in hacking
4498940	4500820	and watching it go increasingly quickly
4500820	4503940	and become more useful feels inherently rewarding.
4503940	4506780	You feel more powerful in a very direct way.
4506780	4509740	More importantly, hacking is always optional.
4509740	4511080	If you didn't like the hacking,
4511080	4513200	you literally never had to do it.
4513200	4514660	If you were untrained in computers,
4514660	4515780	you couldn't hack at all.
4515780	4517420	You didn't even have the icebreaker.
4517420	4519160	The fact it's an active choice
4519160	4520860	and a skill you invest in
4520860	4522740	and the weight creates tension
4522740	4524900	means hacking isn't really passive.
4524900	4527360	It just might sound like it in a designer's head
4527360	4529780	when they aren't considering everything else around it.
4529780	4531780	The problem with treating hacking as passive
4531780	4534620	is that every developer tries to make it less passive
4534620	4536200	in the exact same way.
4536200	4537420	How, you ask?

4581680	4583100	So I can trust you with this.
4583100	4586600	I have the pet theory that all hacking minigames are bad

4588680	4590180	Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
4590180	4591680	I can't wait to justify this.
4591680	4594180	Some of these minigames are kind of fun to do,

4596300	4597800	I couldn't resist not telling you what it was.
4597800	4600680	My problem is that when you have to do them a lot,
4600680	4602680	they start to really distract from the game

4604180	4607680	This isn't a recent trend that started after Deus Ex.
4607680	4611560	It's a constant in gaming history that Deus Ex avoided.
4611560	4613380	Many of the game's developers used to work
4613380	4614840	at Looking Glass Studios,
4614840	4617060	the company that produced System Shock 1 and 2.
4617060	4620180	1999's System Shock 2 has a hacking minigame in it,
4620180	4621980	and it's a fine minigame,
4621980	4625300	but the problem is it isn't fine a hundred times.
4625300	4627560	System Shock 2 is only a groundbreaking
4627560	4630260	survival horror RPG set on a cool space station
4630260	4631300	some of the time.
4631300	4632880	A lot of the time, System Shock 2
4632880	4634300	is a simplistic puzzle game
4634300	4636180	you play in the corner of your screen.
4636180	4640000	Hacking minigames were already a thing in 1999,
4640000	4643000	and they were already pretty clearly not the best idea.
4643000	4646680	The Deus Ex team didn't forget to add a hacking minigame.
4646680	4650500	They chose not to make hacking a repetitive chore.

4653180	4655880	way more of your precious human time on Earth

4722140	4724100	as much of the same fucking minigame
4724100	4725440	because they didn't change it.
4725440	4727740	In his talk, Lapikus says during development
4727740	4730240	this minigame was feature complete in under two weeks.
4730240	4733400	It took two weeks before anything else in the game.
4733400	4734900	I think two years before we should.
4734900	4737480	Hacking was done and we were playing it.
4737480	4739640	If you've played this game all the way through,
4739640	4742640	it is genuinely possible you've spent more time
4742640	4744520	playing the hacking minigame than any
4744520	4746640	of the developers did making it.
4746640	4748440	Not that that's really a bad thing though.
4748440	4751640	Minigames are at risk of being a sunk cost feature.
4751640	4753980	You could easily waste ages trying to make
4753980	4755560	this slightly more fun,
4755560	4757360	and I'm glad they spent the time elsewhere.
4757360	4759200	My point is they should have put even less time
4759200	4760560	into it and not made it.
4760560	4762140	A slide in Lapikus' presentation
4762140	4764020	describes the hacking philosophy
4764020	4766060	which outlines the need to create tension
4766060	4767940	and make the player feel more active,
4767940	4769740	but there's one extra thing on the list
4769740	4771200	that's really troubling.
4771200	4773900	Hacking must be central to the game's progression
4773900	4776940	at some key moments in the game.
4776980	4779440	Oh, no. So remember when I said in Deus Ex
4779440	4781700	even if you hated the hacking, it was optional?
4781700	4783320	Turns out that was a mistake too.
4783320	4785020	Hacking is now mandatory.
4785020	4787820	The player sometimes has no alternative solutions
4787820	4789360	but to play this minigame,
4789360	4791520	and I'm genuinely not sure why.
4791520	4792980	Were they that proud of it?
4792980	4794480	Why take away the player's ability
4794480	4795980	to choose how to progress?
4795980	4798780	Being mandatory actually makes the hacking worse too
4798780	4800600	because now the developers have to account
4800600	4803240	for the possibility players were really bad at hacking
4803240	4804740	or hadn't put any of their skill points
4804740	4806820	into the ability to hack higher level terminals.
4806860	4808620	Which means all the mandatory ones
4808620	4810620	are incredibly low level and easy.
4810620	4813120	So sure, this means if you hate hacking,
4813120	4815780	it's never challenging when you're forced to do it,
4815780	4817860	but it also means players who put their points
4817860	4819620	into hacking are never tested
4819620	4822040	on any of the important terminals of the game.
4822040	4823780	There's a section partway through where the player
4823780	4826540	has to hack the computer of that master hacker from before.
4826540	4828820	I love computers. This computer belongs to the guy
4828820	4832160	who brain jacked someone and made them jack their brain
4832160	4833400	right in front of you.
4833400	4835900	He's so advanced, the biggest tech company
4835900	4837980	in the world hired him to do it.
4837980	4841020	He's had a secret backdoor into your company's computers
4841020	4842520	for like a year.
4842520	4845060	However, this master hacker's computer
4845060	4847160	is plot important, so it's level one
4847160	4849400	and easy to get into and his computer's covered
4849400	4852200	in the extra hacking viruses to help you out just in case.
4852200	4853980	There isn't even a password you can find
4853980	4856240	if you explore or search other areas.
4856240	4857520	You have to hack.
4857520	4859900	Also sure, the forever alone meme.
4859900	4861100	That'll age well.
4861100	4863780	You'll notice I said meme and not in-joke.
4863780	4866020	What if this master hacker's computer
4866020	4868900	was really high level and if you hadn't invested in hacking,
4868900	4870820	you needed to go on a cool side quest
4870820	4873620	to learn the password or explore his apartment to find it?
4873620	4875080	Or what if you just couldn't get into it
4875080	4877580	and had to follow up on other leads to find the hacker?
4877580	4879900	You want players to feel like they gained something
4879900	4882940	from specializing, not that they wasted their time.
4882940	4884740	In the original, there's a section where you need
4884740	4886480	to acquire the password to a computer
4886480	4888980	and it's deep in a basement full of lasers and traps
4888980	4890580	and explosives and turrets,
4890580	4891860	but if you invested in hacking,
4891860	4893440	you can just hack the computer.
4893440	4895520	Giving the player choices based on what sort
4895520	4897400	of character they've made is kind of
4897400	4899360	the whole point of RPGs.
4899360	4901320	If the game was either a forced search
4901320	4904600	for a password in a basement or a forced hacking sequence,
4904600	4907240	it would lose a lot of its value as gameplay,
4907240	4909820	but no, you see, hacking must be central
4909820	4911640	to the game's progression.
4911640	4913520	Why though? The game does reward you
4913520	4915140	for investing in hacking sometimes.
4915140	4917060	Off the beaten track are high level terminals
4917060	4918820	that lead to extra stuff and in missions,
4918820	4920280	there's often security equipment
4920280	4921560	that let you turn off cameras,
4921560	4923900	commandeer turrets, and even combat robots
4923900	4925860	when the level designers remember to put them in.
4925860	4927360	I think it feels a bit less special
4927360	4930020	that everyone else is doing half the hacking you do anyway,
4930020	4931640	but it still works out to be pretty fun.
4931640	4933640	One of my favorite things to do in Human Revolution
4933640	4935360	is if you have the ability to hack turrets
4935360	4936560	and the strength upgrade,
4936560	4938820	you can pick up turrets and carry them around
4938820	4940560	while they destroy everyone in your path.
4940560	4941560	It's fantastic.
4941560	4943060	It feels amazing being rewarded
4943060	4944680	for combining these two abilities.
4944680	4945720	This stuff is great.
4945720	4947600	The part of this transaction I don't like
4947600	4949680	is how many times I had to play competitive
4949680	4951360	join the dots to get here.
4951360	4954120	It's not just that the hacking is a huge waste of time.
4954120	4956120	It's that they deliberately made their game
4956120	4958400	more of a waste of time than the original
4958400	4960660	with the specific intent of making the player
4960660	4962620	feel like they're doing more,
4962620	4964660	and yeah, you are doing more,
4964660	4967400	but more busy work does not equal more fun,
4967400	4969780	and this idea has gone unquestioned for so long
4969780	4971160	that it was a genuine shock
4971160	4973160	when the recent death loop removed it
4973160	4974820	or when Bioshock 2 removed it
4974820	4976200	and added a separate weapon
4976200	4977580	that triggered a different minigame
4977580	4978940	that was shorter and simpler
4978940	4980440	and actually impacted the gameplay
4981320	4983620	Is it just me or is Bioshock 2 the best one
4983620	4984940	by a really wide margin?
4984940	4986200	Like, it's not even close.
4986200	4987620	All right, all right, I have to stop.
4987620	4988700	My heart can't take it.
4988700	4990020	The hacking chapter is over.
4990020	4992120	We're safe. We're alive. It's gone.
4992120	4993940	Let's move to yellower pastures.
4993940	4995700	♪♪
4995700	4997480	The smart lockpick is always handy.
4997480	4999200	The original game also had mechanics
4999200	5000740	for lockpicking to deal with locks
5000740	5002860	and electronics for bypassing other devices
5002860	5005280	that can't be hacked like power boxes and stuff,
5005280	5007120	but hey, if you squint,
5007120	5009440	they're a bit passive too, aren't they?
5009440	5011660	You just sit there and use your item on them.
5011660	5014820	How did the Human Revolution team update these mechanics?
5014820	5017400	They replaced them with the fucking hacking minigame!
5017400	5019660	♪♪
5019660	5022200	That's right! There's three times as much hacking
5022200	5023700	as you thought there was going to be.
5023700	5025160	To get into people's houses,
5025160	5028820	you don't need to find, you know, a fucking key.
5028820	5030080	Like how doors work.
5030080	5032360	You hack the convenient terminal
5032360	5033740	in front of everybody's door
5033740	5036740	or if you're lucky, you can find the code for it somewhere.
5036740	5040000	The concept of keys doesn't exist
5040000	5042280	in the world of Human Revolution.
5042280	5043820	Now that's streamlining.
5043820	5045660	In the original, hacking, lockpicking,
5045660	5047420	and electronics were all separate skills
5047420	5050160	you could invest in with different effects on the world.
5050160	5052200	All of this being the same minigame
5052200	5053700	makes it all feel like you're doing
5053700	5055280	the same thing over and over
5055280	5057280	and it feels like that because you are.
5057280	5059500	Using a multi-tool that's tied into your proficiency
5059500	5061880	with a skill to turn off a laser grid, that's cool,
5061880	5063700	but what if instead it was a minigame
5063700	5065500	that took 24 seconds to do?
5065500	5066500	Oh, yeah, I'd love that.
5066500	5068420	Just squeeze that right into my mouth.
5068420	5070220	Actually, no, we're not playing that in fast forward.
5070220	5071720	You're watching all of this with me.
5078000	5079340	I've got a magazine here.
5083100	5084720	Man, there's a full page ad here
5084720	5086960	for Mark Kermode's film review.
5086960	5088300	I like that guy. I disagree with him
5088300	5089540	like 90% of the time,
5089540	5091720	but I'll know if I like a movie based on what he says,
5091720	5094000	so I think that makes him a good critic, right?
5094000	5095460	Oh, it's over.
5095680	5098300	Now, go watch that 150 times
5098300	5100460	and then tell me that this is good.
5100460	5102460	Quite a few more people have the achievement
5102460	5105720	for hacking 50 devices than for beating the second boss
5105720	5107260	a bit past the halfway point.
5107260	5109380	I can't help but wonder if the hacking is a factor
5109380	5111040	in why people stopped playing.
5111040	5112540	Apparently, one company
5112540	5114500	manufactures everybody's locks now.
5114500	5116460	That must be where the Illuminati get all the money
5116460	5118080	for their secret science bases.
5118080	5119460	Based on how you played it,
5119460	5121380	Deus Ex was a lot of different things
5121380	5122500	to a lot of people.
5122500	5125040	Now a bunch of it is unavoidably hacking.
5125080	5128200	For everyone, and that is worse.
5128200	5130040	None of this stuff is a deal breaker, of course.
5130040	5131280	The game's still pretty good.
5131280	5133420	I just think it really sucks how many choices
5133420	5135700	have been actively removed from the game,
5135700	5138380	but that's not what the developers were focused on.
5138380	5141420	By their own admission, they focused on the combat.
5141420	5145500	♪♪
5145500	5147040	The first thing most people notice
5147040	5148340	about the original Deus Ex
5148340	5150880	is that shooting is fairly complicated and weird.
5150880	5152160	Weapons are pretty powerful.
5152160	5154200	Headshots with almost any weapon are lethal,
5154200	5157000	but they require skill point investments to use properly.
5157000	5158860	At lower levels, they reload slower,
5158860	5161240	are less effective, and take ages to aim.
5161240	5163820	This kind of odd aiming system wasn't an accident.
5163820	5164960	This was deliberately added
5164960	5166780	onto the Unreal Tournament engine.
5166780	5169080	Yeah, it's not a very good first-person shooter,
5169080	5171580	but it's also not trying to be one.
5171580	5173360	It's trying to be an RPG
5173360	5176000	where shooting is a skill you have to invest in.
5176000	5178080	Combat being something difficult to execute
5178080	5179820	is an important part of the design.
5179820	5181580	I'll explain what I mean by referring
5181580	5184000	to another famous immersive sim, Thief.
5184000	5185420	Thief is a stealth game,
5185420	5187220	but you can pull out a sword if you want,
5187220	5189760	and there's a pretty in-depth sword fighting system in there,
5189760	5192260	but as soon as you fight more than one person at once
5192260	5194500	or an undead warrior or a wizard,
5194500	5195800	you're basically dead.
5195800	5198880	The point is combat is a bad situation you should avoid.
5198880	5201180	Ah!
5201180	5204080	Thief's sneaking is fun because you know you're dead
5204080	5205960	if you get seen by a bunch of people.
5205960	5207080	On the higher difficulties,
5207080	5208840	killing someone gives you a game over.
5208840	5210460	It wouldn't be as fun if you could cut
5210460	5212380	six people's heads off in five seconds
5213300	5215140	and, oh, what's this dishonored footage doing here?
5215140	5216680	Warren Spector worked at Looking Glass
5216680	5219100	while they were making Thief and remembers being annoyed
5219100	5221100	he couldn't just fight enemies if he wanted,
5221100	5222720	and in his talk, he actually describes
5222720	5224340	learning this exact lesson.
5224340	5228220	I came to a place that was just too hard for me to sneak,
5228220	5229720	and I asked the team,
5229720	5232140	just make me tough enough that I can fight my way
5232140	5235340	past these guards because I'm getting killed every time,
5235340	5236420	and they said no.
5236420	5240340	If we made the player character strong enough to fight,
5240340	5241640	no one would ever sneak,
5241640	5243400	and the idea of the game was to sneak,
5243400	5245100	and they're probably right for Thief.
5245100	5246560	That was probably the right decision to make.
5246560	5248180	He describes Deus Ex as a game
5248180	5250280	trying to be a bit more balanced than Thief.
5250280	5253060	I made a vow right then that I was gonna make a game
5253060	5257100	that lets you fight or sneak, uh, as you chose.
5257100	5259360	It wants to let you do combat if you want to
5259360	5261100	and make it satisfying to win
5261100	5263900	but also retain the fun of avoiding it if you can
5263900	5265680	by making combat something that's hard
5265680	5267140	if you're not invested in it.
5267140	5269220	This means sneaking or using exploration
5269220	5271560	or talking to people or hacking the enemy's robots
5271560	5274320	and letting them mess them up for you is rewarding.
5274320	5277060	Right before we shipped, I put my head down on my desk,
5277060	5278240	and I just said,
5278240	5281900	if people get that you can fight, sneak, or talk,
5281900	5283700	we're gonna rule the world.
5283700	5286860	If people compare our combat to Half-Life, we're dead.
5286860	5288400	For the Human Revolution team,
5288400	5291020	modernizing the combat was their highest priority.
5291020	5293140	Lapicus's talk has a chart showing what they spent
5293140	5294480	the most time and resources on.
5294480	5297480	As we decided that combat would be where we would put
5297480	5299980	most of our time, energy, and resources.
5299980	5302980	They knew they could handily outdo the original on combat,
5302980	5304860	so they really put their minds to it,
5304860	5307480	and the combat in Human Revolution is really good.
5307480	5309820	Bullets hurt a lot, so fights are punishing
5309820	5311900	when you get hit, and they're satisfying to win
5311900	5313160	because you almost died.
5313160	5314660	I thought I would hate that they added
5314660	5316080	cover shooting to Deus Ex,
5316080	5317900	but it's executed really well.
5317900	5320040	Wee. There's no huge gauntlets.
5320040	5321900	Every shootout is its own landscape
5321900	5323860	with enemies trying to flank and flush you out
5323860	5325620	with grenades once a fight starts.
5325620	5327240	There's none of the busy work you get in
5327240	5328780	with other shooters where you just, like,
5328780	5331080	kill a lot of people so you have something to do
5331080	5332340	on your way to the next level.
5332340	5334540	When you do fight, the fight is unique
5334540	5336840	and specific to that area and the type of
5336840	5338260	and amount of enemies.
5338260	5340380	That said, there is one aspect of the combat
5340380	5342460	that's not very good. Let's talk about melee.
5342460	5344560	Deus Ex had a wide variety of lethal
5344560	5346840	and non-lethal choices for hand-to-hand combat
5346840	5349060	from police batons to riot prods,
5349060	5350340	knives, and crowbars.
5350340	5352400	Then when you got to China, you could find a sword
5352400	5354640	and have a flipping sword, which was cool,
5354640	5357180	and later you found a gosh darn lightsaber.
5357180	5359140	Well, a sword made of tiny nanomachines
5359140	5360640	arranging in the shape of a sword,
5360640	5362260	but look at it. Human revolution
5362260	5366300	streamlined melee weapons by removing them.
5366300	5369560	No, really, there's no melee weapons in Deus Ex anymore.
5369560	5372400	You can't pull out a stick and swing it at someone.
5372400	5374440	It's all guns all the time.
5374440	5376100	It's like me at the gym.
5376100	5377600	There's baseball bats lying around,
5377600	5379200	but hell, if anyone uses them,
5379200	5380480	no one can even pick it up.
5380480	5381660	That shit must be heavy.
5381660	5382940	Grenades can't even move it.
5382940	5384580	Instead, you perform melee combat
5384580	5386960	by pressing a button, and if you have enough energy,
5386980	5388900	a cinematic plays depicting Jensen
5388900	5391280	taking the person out, lethally or non-lethally
5391280	5393080	based on whether you held the button down.
5393080	5395280	They simplified the melee combat so much
5395280	5399040	they moved it out of the game and into a cut scene.
5399040	5401240	Cut scene Jensen rides again.
5401240	5403920	He gets to have fun with his arm swords,
5403920	5405260	and you don't.
5405260	5406260	Ah!

5408720	5411060	It's an incredibly clunky thing to have to do
5411060	5413420	every time you do close-range combat.
5413420	5415480	Some of these look pretty fun the first few times,
5415500	5418340	but like with hacking, it's not fun the many times
5418340	5420380	you end up doing it in the game.

5427480	5430140	instead of ever being able to do something as simple
5430140	5433720	as whip out a crowbar is mind baffling.

5460660	5462360	as one of the worst ever,

5491660	5492820	the recoil you start with
5492820	5494200	is pretty easy to handle,
5494200	5495280	and this is good.
5495280	5496660	It means combat is more a test
5496660	5498960	of the player's skill than their character's stats,
5498960	5501080	and for something as visceral as a shootout,

5554500	5555700	["Metal Gear Solid 3 Theme"]
5555700	5558000	Melee from stealth sometimes knocked enemies out
5558000	5559380	and sometimes merely hurt them
5559380	5561080	and then alerted them to you.
5561080	5563300	The stun prod seemed to base its effectiveness
5563300	5564960	on how it was feeling that evening.
5564960	5567760	This was one thing that was desperate for an overhaul.
5567760	5569420	Now's a good time to tell you several
5569420	5571460	of this game's developers had previously worked
5571460	5573000	on Splinter Cell Chaos Theory,
5573000	5576680	one of the best stealth games and games of all time,
5576680	5578220	including Francois Lapikus,
5578220	5580720	making him a literal heroic genius.
5580720	5582640	I'm not normally a pure stealth guy.
5582640	5585400	I try until I get seen and then I start blasting.
5585400	5587720	I'm the sort of person Dishonored was made for.
5587720	5589360	I hope that joke earlier didn't mislead you.
5589360	5590720	I love that game, seriously,
5590720	5592820	but Human Revolution is at its most fun
5592820	5595820	when you take the stealth as seriously as you can.
5595820	5597900	The Thief games and even Splinter Cell
5597900	5600200	start to bore me after a while when I try that,
5600200	5603280	but here everything's at its most tense and careful
5603280	5605620	while never being too slow or trial or error,
5605620	5607880	and I just criticized the takedowns,
5607880	5608880	but you know what?
5608880	5610540	They're super reliable for stealth.
5610540	5611540	If you haven't been seen,
5611540	5613460	the takedown is silent and stealthy
5613480	5615940	and there's no chance of it not knocking out the enemy
5615940	5617080	like you thought it would.
5617080	5619240	This is kinda how Chaos Theory worked,
5619240	5621540	using takedowns instead of typical melee.
5621540	5624660	It was always an instant kill or knockout.
5624660	5626920	You just had to get in close enough to do it,
5626920	5629760	which explains why they did it the way they did here.
5629760	5632680	Sam Fisher's Sleepy Slappers didn't need ammunition, though,
5632680	5634640	and the takedown wasn't a long animation
5634640	5635920	that took away your control,
5635920	5637800	but at least the game's weird melee system
5637800	5639560	starts to make sense when you consider
5639560	5641100	the creators' design chops
5641100	5642900	and what delicious chops they were.
5642920	5644500	God, this is such a good game.
5644500	5646340	I'm so happy I got to bring this up.
5646340	5648880	♪♪
5648880	5652260	The AI in Human Revolution is really fun to hide from
5652260	5655060	in almost exactly the same way Chaos Theory was.
5655060	5657600	They'll hear you if you run and see you immediately
5657600	5658600	if you're out in the open,
5658600	5659800	but if you're crouch-walking,
5659800	5661680	you pretty reliably can't be heard,
5661680	5664180	and you can even get away with falling a short distance now.
5664180	5666440	You can hide in enemies' peripheral vision
5666440	5668740	in ways that are maybe a little unrealistic
5668740	5670900	but feel great to get away with.
5670900	5672940	The third-person cover mode functions
5672940	5675500	as a perfected version of the original's peaking.
5675500	5678320	It's kind of hilarious that they literally went on record
5678320	5680580	that combat was the most important thing,
5680580	5683160	but while they were at it, they just casually tossed in
5683160	5685040	one of the best stealth experiences
5685040	5686500	this side of Dishonored,
5686500	5689580	but the developers had designed themselves into a corner.
5689580	5691000	They'd made a game that featured
5691000	5692800	a fantastic stealth experience
5692800	5694880	and then given players a bunch of guns,
5694880	5696960	removed the limitations on shooting
5696960	5698800	that made it less viable in the original,
5698800	5701580	and then bolted third-person cover shooting mechanics
5701580	5704500	onto their first-person game just to make sure
5704500	5707080	you could shoot people any way you wanted.
5707080	5709120	Remember what I said about games like Deus Ex
5709120	5710920	being sums of parts?
5710920	5713760	You can't make a game like Deus Ex more like a shooter
5713760	5716800	without inevitably making it less like Deus Ex.
5716800	5719100	The balance of which mechanics you rely on
5719100	5720640	to survive has shifted.
5720640	5722940	Shooting has become the most viable solution
5722940	5725140	to most problems when in the original,
5725140	5727020	it was the least viable solution,
5727040	5728500	and that made it fun to avoid
5728500	5730540	or to really lean into and get good at.
5730540	5733540	You could spend a long time memorizing these patrols,
5733540	5736040	learning to meticulously sneak between cover,
5736040	5738260	put all your augmentation points into cloaking
5738260	5740680	or running silently, and have to be very careful
5740680	5742300	whenever you need to come back through this room
5742300	5743800	because they're all still here,
5743800	5746260	or you can click on four guys
5746260	5748520	and not have to worry about them ever again.
5748520	5754320	♪♪
5754320	5757240	Since shooting people is extremely simple and fun,
5757240	5759540	it becomes the dominant strategy,
5759540	5762620	the thing you're incentivized to do to solve your problems.
5762620	5765540	This threatens to ruin all of the other mechanics.
5765540	5767880	Why use stealth when everyone's dead
5767880	5770540	and the fights that happen when people see you are fun?
5770540	5773000	Why bother hacking a terminal to turn off cameras
5773000	5774540	or turn turrets against their owners
5774540	5776680	when you shot all the owners when you came in?
5776680	5778460	Who are the cameras even gonna send after me
5778460	5780800	when they see me? Everybody's dead, Dave.
5780800	5783260	But you'll notice I said threatens there
5783260	5784620	because the developers were clever
5784620	5786460	and they noticed this possibility too
5786460	5787580	during playtesting.
5787580	5790500	They'd worked really hard designing fairly complex levels
5790500	5792180	with multiple paths and solutions
5792180	5794220	and then testers clicked on the bad men
5794220	5796980	until they died and walked to the next objective.
5796980	5798840	It was a total failure.
5798840	5801760	Playtests showed us that people were just gunning everything
5801760	5804860	and they weren't thinking. It was just a huge frag fest.
5804860	5806060	So to fix this,
5806060	5808520	they came up with a really clever solution.
5808520	5811740	♪♪
5811760	5814060	Sure, shooting would solve everything,
5814060	5815180	but to correct for it,
5815180	5817860	the game is astonishingly stingy with ammo.
5817860	5820280	Ammunition pickups you can find lying around in levels
5820280	5822560	usually amount to a handful of bullets apiece,
5822560	5825240	and for more specialized weapons like the tranquilizer rifle,
5825240	5827060	you're lucky to find two or three,
5827060	5828740	which is accurate. I only keep a couple
5828740	5830620	of tranquilizer darts in my office too.
5830620	5832780	Enemies have been meticulously designed
5832780	5834660	to be almost a waste of bullets
5834660	5836820	if you try fighting them like in a normal shooter.
5836820	5837780	They drop their weapons,
5837780	5839120	which have a couple bullets in them,
5839120	5841580	and sometimes there's a few more on their bodies.
5841600	5844100	If you're not being really precise with your shots,
5844100	5847180	you can easily end with less ammo than you started.
5847180	5848880	This was a super smart choice.
5848880	5850480	It means there's much more pressure
5850480	5853020	to make your shots count or, more importantly,
5853020	5856220	to avoid wasting bullets fighting in the first place.
5856220	5859360	This tremendously alters how the player relates to the world.
5859360	5861140	Sure, you could just shoot all these guys
5861140	5862900	like I said before, but that would actually make
5862900	5864860	your life harder in the next fight.
5864860	5865700	See what I mean?
5865700	5868040	Scarcity of resources recontextualizes
5868040	5870860	what would otherwise be a fairly simple situation.
5870860	5873240	Sure, you can take a bunch of guys out with a grenade,
5873240	5875440	but you have, like, two grenades.
5875440	5876660	You might need those.
5876660	5877980	The end result is like playing
5877980	5879540	a fairly simple cover shooter
5879540	5882860	while being lightly choked from behind by a game designer.
5882860	5884160	Even when it's straightforward,
5884160	5886780	it's still a little tense, and that's what makes it fun.
5886780	5889660	Adam Jensen is a deadly shadow on the battlefield
5889660	5892200	who can dish it out, but only in small portions,
5892200	5894880	and if he's not careful, he won't have room for dessert.
5894880	5896920	I'm not kidding how seriously these guys took
5896920	5898140	the balancing of resources.
5898140	5900260	In Lapicus's talk, he shows photographs
5900280	5901920	of huge bulletin boards they made
5901920	5903740	to track all the weapons, ammunition,
5903740	5905960	and items a player could find in the levels.
5905960	5908880	We used these balance boards to get a sense
5908880	5910500	of everything that was in the game.
5910500	5912340	This is about half the boards we had.
5912340	5913580	We had six in total.
5913580	5916140	And tried to make sure they were never too powerful,
5916140	5917500	never had enough stuff,
5917500	5919840	so a big fight would always cost them.
5919840	5921340	During playtests, people would complain.
5921340	5923340	They would say, well, I don't have enough ammo
5923340	5926060	to kill everybody, but then again,
5926060	5927900	that's exactly what we wanted.
5927900	5929140	Chris Rock was right.
5929160	5931700	Sometimes what you need is bullet control,
5931700	5934200	so the core experience works out really well.
5934200	5936200	There's this fantastic primary loop
5936200	5938000	of carefully avoiding enemies,
5938000	5939960	stealthily taking out the ones you can
5939960	5942720	with takedowns or silenced weapons to preserve ammo,
5942720	5945500	hoping to thin the crowd before a big fight starts,
5945500	5947760	building up enough ammunition that you can afford
5947760	5949680	to get in fights when you do get caught,
5949680	5952720	the occasional inevitable explosions of violence,
5952720	5955480	and the careful picking clean of the bodies at the end.
5955480	5958220	There's a rhythm to it that feels excellent.
5958220	5960980	If you want an FPS RPG whose FPS component
5960980	5962800	is some genuinely good shooting
5962800	5965060	that doesn't invalidate stealth and hacking
5965060	5966720	and other alternative solutions,
5966720	5969680	Human Revolution is basically the game for you.
5969680	5972880	However, as Deus Ex used to like pointing out,
5972880	5974840	these choices have consequences.
5974840	5976760	Say you like the tranquilizer rifle.
5976760	5979600	It's silent and non-lethal and has a decent range.
5979600	5982640	It has basically no weaknesses except it's a bit slow.
5982640	5985380	So in a normal game, the bullets would be expensive,
5985380	5987220	but that would be your choice to make, right?
5987220	5989060	Well, not here because if you can buy
5989060	5990800	all the tranq rifle rounds you want,
5990800	5991960	the game would be too easy.
5991960	5993380	Instead, the local weapon store
5993380	5996180	will sell you five packs of two,
5996180	5998220	and those ten darts will have to last you a while
5998220	6000420	because the other store in Detroit doesn't sell any.
6000420	6002100	You'll have to go all the way to China
6002100	6004420	to find someone else willing to sell these to you.
6004420	6005600	This is a good choice.
6005600	6007720	Giving the player too much ammo for the best weapon
6007720	6010220	would ruin the tension and make things way too easy,
6010220	6012520	but on a simpler level, it's incredibly annoying
6012520	6014600	to not be allowed to buy ammo
6014600	6016420	for the weapon you like to use.
6016420	6018880	This is one of the trade-offs this design has to make.
6018880	6020840	It works, but in a way that might be
6020840	6022720	a little bit annoying for some types of player
6022720	6025040	who thought they could spend the money they were saving
6025040	6028000	on things they wanted or expected one of the two weapons
6028000	6030220	they can fit in their inventory to have enough ammo
6030220	6031800	available to make it useful.
6031800	6033500	There are also limb clinics where you can buy
6033500	6036180	praxis points, so I mean, if you want more,
6036180	6038220	you can look around for more credits to buy more
6038220	6040840	and maybe sell the weapons and ammo you aren't using, right?
6040840	6043960	You know, like a fun video game would do
6043960	6046540	if it wanted to give you interesting decisions to make.
6046540	6048080	The billboard says no.
6048080	6051760	Limb clinics will sell you two praxis points.
6051760	6054040	The scarcity starts to feel really weird
6054040	6057040	if you think too hard about it or try to circumvent it.
6057040	6058920	What's that? You think you can get the upper hand
6058920	6060960	by knocking out a bunch of well-armed policemen
6060960	6063160	with assault rifles and get a couple more bullets
6063160	6065000	to get an edge at the start of the game?
6065000	6068340	Nice try. Those cops aren't carrying any ammo on them
6068340	6070420	and their guns had three bullets in them.
6070420	6073000	No, not each. Between both of them.
6073000	6075500	In a fight, NPCs have infinite bullets.
6075500	6077960	The game keeps track of how many shots they've fired,
6077960	6080200	not so it can give you their remaining ammo,
6080200	6082120	so avoiding fighting and taking them out
6082120	6084120	gives you a bigger reward, but to keep track
6084120	6086160	of when they need to reload.
6086160	6087500	I don't know. This is starting to feel
6087500	6088920	a little bit artificial.
6088920	6091700	Lots of areas have weapons lying around sort of as props,
6091700	6093460	populating some of the pretty sparse
6093460	6094920	office and apartment areas.
6094920	6097700	Almost all of these have exactly one bullet in them.
6097700	6099700	There's something extremely disconcerting
6099700	6102240	about a world full of people who keep a gun on their desk
6102240	6103480	with one bullet in it.
6103480	6105280	This sort of thing starts to really affect
6105280	6106780	how exploration feels.
6106780	6109120	Remember, these guys had a big billboard on the wall
6109120	6111020	keeping track of every bullet in the game
6111020	6112480	after seeing what playtesters did
6112480	6113860	when they gave them too much,
6113860	6116440	so if you're exploring every nook and cranny,
6116440	6118940	opening every locker, looking in bathrooms
6118940	6120400	and behind boxes and so on,
6120400	6122620	there will be rewards for exploring,
6122620	6124860	but the billboard said if you get too much stuff,
6124860	6126200	it won't be tense anymore,
6126200	6128160	so the main reward is going to be, like,
6128160	6129660	five more bullets.
6129660	6131320	The game will throw a massive room
6131320	6132940	full of, like, 50 lockers at you,
6132940	6134980	and there'll be, like, four pickups in total
6134980	6138200	amounting to one full clip of ammo for one gun
6138200	6139820	and a third of a clip for another
6139820	6140940	and maybe a grenade,
6140940	6142520	and the lockers only open halfway,
6142520	6143820	so you gotta really peek in there
6143820	6145120	to make sure you see everything.
6145120	6146480	Oh, and because it's this game,
6146480	6148980	none of the lockers are locked
6148980	6150980	because locks don't exist anymore.
6150980	6153440	Even the most daring heists in the game
6153440	6155160	start to feel kind of pointless.
6155160	6158060	In the Detroit level, you can break into the armory
6158060	6159320	of a police station.
6159320	6160820	A police station armory.
6160820	6163060	An American police station armory.
6163060	6164440	I've seen their budgets.
6164440	6165940	That sounds like pay dirt.
6165940	6167320	Access granted.
6167320	6169400	♪ ♪
6169400	6171060	Prepare for the cornucopia.
6171060	6172900	I hope you're ready for two stun grenades
6172900	6175320	and a template that can turn one of them into a mine
6175320	6178520	and an assault rifle with 15 bullets to go with it.
6178520	6180900	That's less than a full clip of rifle ammo.
6180900	6182740	Is that a clip or a magazine?
6182740	6184120	I don't know, and I'm too hopped up
6184120	6186020	on all this sweet loot to care.
6186020	6189120	Oh, boy, a shotgun and five shells to go with it
6189120	6192080	and a completely new gun that stuns enemies briefly
6192080	6193460	that you don't have room for
6193460	6195500	and four shots for it if you could.
6195500	6197000	Oh, and a rate of fire upgrade
6197000	6199200	so you can fire the bullets you don't have faster.
6199200	6201360	You can really feel how contrived the Scarcity's.
6201360	6203280	Scarcity? Scarcity? I don't even know how to say it.
6203280	6205280	Like, they put all these ammo pickups on the table
6205280	6207540	so it feels like you're getting a big horde of stuff,
6207540	6209820	but it's actually just several small boxes
6209820	6211700	with two and three bullets in them.
6211700	6214320	Think about why they deliberately did that for a second.
6214320	6215960	They could have just put one box
6215960	6217860	with 15 bullets in it next to the gun,
6217860	6219360	but then players would understand
6219360	6221660	how little stuff they were being given for this.
6221660	6223560	If I gave you five quality streets
6223560	6225360	and not even any green triangles,
6225360	6227060	you'd think I was ruining Christmas,
6227060	6229560	but if I gave it to you in the form of two boxes
6229560	6232980	for a few minutes, I'd be the best uncle ever.
6232980	6235440	I get to write these off as a business expense now.
6235440	6237980	Knowing now what the reward for this adventure was,
6237980	6239700	let's all go watch the hacking minigame
6239700	6241100	I had to do to get this.
6241100	6243860	["This is what you get for demanding the truth."
6243860	6245980	No, I'm serious. I'm doing it again.
6245980	6248100	There's actually a couple of NPC guards
6248100	6250320	who are, like, talking about how cool the Peps is
6250320	6251860	in the hallway of the police station,
6251860	6253820	and when you get it, you get four shots for it,
6253820	6255320	and it kind of sucks.
6255320	6257940	It sucks so bad it doesn't even come back in the sequel.
6257940	6260480	They make it like an augmentation or something.
6260480	6261860	I didn't pick up the Peps here,
6261860	6263980	but I did hoard all the ammo I could
6263980	6265180	over the course of the whole game,
6265180	6267820	so I got a good 15 shots in the last level.
6267820	6270480	Okay, I'm done with my Peps talk.
6270480	6271860	I promise I won't do this again.
6271860	6273940	I always thought it was strange how Sandoval
6273940	6276280	sadly and slowly takes out a revolver,
6276280	6278100	and the implication is pretty clear, right?
6278100	6279440	We know what he's planning,
6279440	6281940	but then he also takes out a single bullet
6281940	6283140	to put in the gun.
6283140	6284820	First off, Sandy, it's this game.
6284820	6286320	The gun already had one bullet in it,
6286320	6288600	but if you talk him down, he puts the gun on the desk,
6288600	6289600	and you can pick it up,
6289600	6291280	and of course it has one bullet in it,
6291280	6292480	and if he does shoot himself,
6292480	6293780	you can still pick up the gun,
6293780	6295280	but of course it doesn't have five?
6295280	6297140	Five bullets? Fuck this fucking game!
6297140	6298940	It's not just having too many bullets
6298940	6300140	that would make you overpowered.
6300140	6302940	It's having weapons that are too powerful in general.
6302940	6305780	The game has two really powerful weapons,
6305780	6307780	the laser rifle and the plasma rifle.
6307780	6310240	Both of these weapons deal immense amounts of damage
6310240	6313940	really quickly and can melt any enemy practically instantly.

6335200	6338120	Giving these to the player would make combat far too easy

6340080	6341700	Even giving them next to no ammo
6341700	6344200	would still make the weapon ridiculous in fights,

6347900	6350700	is behind Tong during your second visit to China,

6353000	6354820	This gives you roughly two levels
6354820	6356320	to use it against regular enemies

6406740	6408940	So essentially, they balanced these weapons
6408940	6411320	by giving them to you when the game is over.
6411320	6413080	It seems like they designed these weapons
6413080	6415320	much earlier on than did the playtesting
6415320	6417820	and realized how much their reliance on combat
6417820	6420240	broke the game's feel and they had to lean on scarcity
6420240	6421860	and went, well, we made these.
6421860	6424240	We should put them somewhere and put them right at the end.
6424240	6425740	So, hey, they're in the game,

6428040	6431420	I would say without going too specific in the numbers,

6446460	6448580	there's 20 weapons in Human Revolution.
6448580	6450840	The game's launch trailer features a shot of Jensen
6450840	6453060	using the plasma rifle against a security robot
6453060	6454800	in a much earlier section of the game
6454800	6456300	during the first visit to China,
6456300	6459220	hours and hours before the player ever gets one.
6459220	6460220	I'm not saying, like,
6460220	6462060	this game's launch trailer lied to me.
6462060	6463480	It's more that I think these comments
6463480	6464860	and bits of pre-release footage
6464860	6466520	are a fascinating look into the kinds
6466520	6468200	of tough design choices that come up
6468200	6469440	during game development.
6469440	6471660	This next thing's been stuck in my craw
6471660	6473440	for literally a full decade.
6473460	6474720	In an interview with Eurogamer,
6474720	6476340	the game's director, Jean-Francois Degas,
6476340	6478420	made a really enlightening statement,
6478420	6480040	and I'm not saying that sarcastically.
6480040	6481300	It genuinely is.
6481300	6483140	I've obsessed about it for 10 years.
6483140	6484260	What is wrong with me?
6484260	6485920	The laser rifle looks like fun.
6485920	6487020	How does it work?
6487020	6487940	It is a weapon.
6487940	6488720	Sorry.
6488720	6490980	It is a weapon that allows you to shoot through walls,
6490980	6492600	so you just have to shoot, really.
6492600	6494220	Combined with the smart vision,
6494220	6495720	e.g. through through walls,
6495720	6497280	it makes for deadly combo.
6497280	6498820	However, I'm telling you right away,
6498820	6500860	it's a very difficult weapon to get.
6500860	6503360	You can see why this is such a meaningful statement.
6503780	6505280	I'm sure Degas wouldn't say that
6505280	6507200	while intending for the rifle to be something
6507200	6509120	you get lying against a wall
6509120	6510820	right before the last couple of levels.
6510820	6513200	We're going full speculation ops here.
6513200	6515000	I could be reading way too much into this,
6515000	6517240	but it sounds like in the nearly a year
6517240	6519200	between this interview and the release of the game,
6519200	6520460	the design got altered.
6520460	6522080	Maybe the laser rifle was balanced
6522080	6524460	by making it a reward for some difficult challenge
6524460	6527000	like a daring heist in a police station or something,
6527000	6528800	but then they did more playtesting
6528800	6531100	and noticed that even when the weapon was hard to get
6531100	6532300	and had limited ammo,
6532300	6534420	it ruined the entire feel of the game.
6534420	6536380	Stealth, conservation of resources,
6536380	6538300	hell, even the basic flow of combat
6538300	6540800	gets irrevocably changed when a player gets
6540800	6543480	the shoot through walls instant murder beam,
6543480	6545220	so they must have made the tough decision
6545220	6547860	of turning it into an extremely late game weapon
6547860	6549820	so at the very least it couldn't mess
6549820	6551440	with the rest of the game's pace.
6551440	6553400	This points to just how devoted they were
6553400	6556060	to making the central mechanics feel good.
6556060	6558660	It's obviously really important for the game
6558680	6561800	that it's not incredibly easy to defeat enemies.
6561800	6563980	They designed several powerful weapons
6563980	6565140	that were fun to play with,
6565140	6567100	but then cut them out of most of the game
6567100	6569140	in the name of making sure the core gameplay
6569140	6570480	could live its best life.
6570480	6573360	Unfortunately, and it pains me to do this,
6573360	6575160	after all this time going into detail
6575160	6577240	about some really clever design choices,
6577240	6580740	we now have to talk about how they kind of ruined them.
6580740	6586920	♪♪
6586920	6589140	You know how I've been really hitting you over the head
6589140	6590800	with how important scarcity was?
6590800	6593440	Well, in his talk, Lapicus was also doing that.
6593440	6596440	-"Dare Sex?" is a game about scarcity of resources.
6596440	6598520	Oh, that's why I keep pronouncing it like that.
6598520	6600060	If we give you everything,
6600060	6601780	you're not gonna think anymore.
6601780	6604900	You're just gonna go and use the simple route.
6604900	6607740	It's fun for players to be rewarded for their choices
6607740	6610120	or to be made to deal with problems caused by them.
6610120	6611240	The original does this too,
6611240	6612820	not to the same degree with ammunition,
6612820	6614200	but because you needed lockpicks,
6614200	6616400	multi-tools, augmentation canisters,
6616400	6617900	medkits, skill points,
6617900	6619440	and other useful items to progress,
6619440	6621360	you're always hurting for something,
6621360	6622660	and speaking of hurting,
6622660	6624920	even damage was part of this puzzle.
6624920	6627380	J.C. Denton had locational limb damage,
6627380	6628540	a bit like in Fallout.
6628540	6630960	Damaged limbs affected his aiming and his movement.
6630960	6632680	If you broke your legs, you had to crawl around
6632680	6633760	to find a medkit.
6633760	6636300	This meant combat was extremely tense.
6636300	6638840	You had to manage its effects on your body.
6638840	6640680	Medkits didn't just bring back health.
6640680	6642600	They had to be used on a specific body part
6642620	6644460	to mitigate the effects of the damage.
6644460	6646080	Without medkits and the skill
6646080	6647380	that makes them more effective,
6647380	6648420	you were in trouble,
6648420	6649960	and the robots that healed you for free
6649960	6651420	were few and far between.
6651420	6654000	This meant combat and taking damage in general
6654000	6657140	had genuine stakes to it.
6657140	6660140	-"Denton. Hey, it's Denton."
6660140	6661140	Oh.
6661140	6662680	Lucky there's a clinic nearby.
6662680	6664480	-"Have you looked at any other options?
6664480	6667140	Euthanasia is one sure way to relieve suffering."
6667140	6669980	-"Uh, Chinese herbal nonsense is for twinks.
6669980	6671240	I want real medicine."
6671260	6672420	Human Revolution removed
6672420	6674040	locational limb damage completely
6674040	6676340	and replaced it with a simple health bar,
6676340	6678720	which isn't the worst idea,
6678720	6681440	and I know that because then they had the worst idea
6681440	6684480	and went a step further and removed damage.
6684480	6686940	If you haven't been shot for a few seconds,
6686940	6689360	your health just comes back.
6689360	6690700	It seems like when they were looking
6690700	6692160	at other popular shooters of the day
6692160	6694740	for inspiration for how to improve Deus Ex's combat,
6694740	6696700	some wires got crossed and they borrowed
6696700	6698660	their regenerating health mechanics too,
6698660	6699820	mechanics which are great
6699820	6701480	for combat-centric action shooters
6701480	6703400	and terrible for ones where getting shot
6703400	6704780	is supposed to matter.
6704780	6707820	One of the most important facets of combat in Deus Ex,
6707820	6710780	the consequences of combat, is just gone.
6710780	6712740	If you got shot in a fight in Deus Ex,
6712740	6715400	it was an extra complication you had to deal with.
6715400	6716900	It didn't just go away.
6716900	6719400	It was an added incentive to make smarter choices
6719400	6721200	than getting into a straight shootout.
6721200	6722980	Even if you killed everyone first,
6722980	6724660	if they shot you, it was a problem
6724660	6725980	you still had to deal with.
6725980	6728740	It made the janky combat fun to put stats in
6728740	6729900	so that you did well in it
6729900	6732860	or to avoid completely using stealth or explosives.
6732860	6735400	Regenerating health messes with the core concept
6735400	6737400	of choices having consequences.
6737400	6739860	Now, once everyone's dead, your health will come back
6739860	6741620	while you're checking their bodies.
6741620	6744240	You'd think a game that wanted to instill tension
6744240	6746820	about survival and make combat's effects matter,
6746820	6748540	for example, by making said bodies
6748540	6749620	have two bullets on them,
6749620	6751360	would avoid misusing
6751360	6753160	regeneration mechanics like this.
6753160	6755160	Human Revolution's combat doesn't get to be
6755160	6757200	as engaging as it easily could have been
6757200	6759000	because of this boneheaded idea.
6759000	6761200	The choice to remove consequences from combat
6761200	6763460	cuts off the game's potential at its knees,
6763460	6765660	something you also can't do anymore.
6765660	6767200	If you really want to balance combat
6767200	6768460	against stealth and hacking
6768460	6769780	and other alternative solutions,
6769780	6771740	maybe make taking damage a problem.
6771740	6773420	You could basically flip a switch,
6773420	6774880	turn off regenerating health,
6774880	6776700	and instantly make the entire game
6776700	6778460	a much more fascinating puzzle.
6778460	6780920	Make all of its combat that much more engaging,
6780920	6782120	more of an obstacle.
6782120	6784620	Since all of its effects would become cumulative,
6784620	6787080	so many more players would be making fun decisions
6787120	6789580	about how to engage in them or how to avoid them,
6789580	6791160	and healing items would matter again,
6791160	6792760	which they don't in Human Revolution
6792760	6795160	because your health returns to maximum on its own.
6795160	6796580	Why do you even have these in here?
6796580	6799580	Oh, they put you slightly over your maximum health.
6799580	6801880	Great. These items would have value
6801880	6804300	in a world where you didn't just get all your health back?
6804300	6806620	Jesus Christ. This affects energy too.
6806620	6808460	In the original and Invisible War,
6808460	6811000	you required energy to use augmentations.
6811000	6813720	This made energy cells into a valuable resource,
6813720	6815420	and it's clear in this game that someone
6815420	6816840	had their head screwed on properly
6816840	6818800	and wanted them to be like that here too
6818800	6820260	because there's candy bars everywhere
6820260	6822640	that refill one or more batteries of energy,
6822640	6824300	but whoever that genius was,
6824300	6826980	someone bashed his head in and went to work in his clothes
6826980	6829980	and decided to make energy also refill on its own.
6829980	6832600	The candy's useful if you want to do multiple takedowns
6832600	6834760	in quick succession or really like using
6834760	6836480	the cloaking device for long periods,
6836480	6838680	but the fact you have practically infinite energy
6838680	6840260	as long as you're willing to wait a second
6840260	6843720	means there's no real economy to using augmentations.
6843720	6845800	The health and energy pickups feel like
6845800	6848640	vestigial remains of a much more engaging version
6848640	6850640	of this game where these things mattered.
6850640	6852300	I think this stuff is a bit of a shame,
6852300	6854380	but bear in mind it's not that bad.
6854380	6857380	The core experience still works really well so far.
6857380	6859340	Sure, the scarcity can be a little annoying.
6859340	6860720	The police forgot to bring bullets
6860720	6864060	to a hostage situation or out on patrol or back at base.
6864060	6866480	Your boss can only afford to give you one gun.
6866480	6868600	He's a millionaire, but the store would only sell him
6868600	6871060	seven darts for the tranquilizer gun you asked for,
6871060	6872900	and two of the coolest guns in the game
6872900	6874760	don't fucking exist.
6874760	6876600	Oh, but thanks to my acts of heroism,
6876600	6880100	I have a very slight discount on those stun gun darts
6880100	6882100	I can buy literally six of.
6882100	6885060	Yeah, that really helps. Thank you.
6885060	6887560	But at least the intended effect works.
6887560	6889100	You're making careful choices.
6889100	6890600	You're having fun.
6890600	6893600	Then you find a rocket launcher hidden in gang territory
6893600	6894940	with two rockets.
6894940	6896560	If you're in a fight with a large group
6896560	6898860	or a big robot, this can change everything,
6898860	6900940	but you can only fit it in your inventory
6900940	6902980	if you throw a bunch of other stuff away.
6903000	6904700	This is a great little decision
6904700	6906380	to offer the player in a game like this.
6906380	6908120	You have to make a tactical decision
6908120	6910220	and become even weaker in regular fights
6910220	6912180	in the hopes of having an edge in a big one.
6912180	6913800	Moments like this are the secret
6913800	6915220	to what makes these games fun,
6915220	6917260	feeling confronted with possibilities
6917260	6918600	and what to do about them.
6918600	6921300	If there's a key Deus Ex thing you have to nail,
6921300	6922300	it's this.
6922300	6924440	Does the player feel a little bit nervous
6924440	6927400	when they find a cool weapon they don't have room for?
6927400	6928700	Then a level or so later,
6928700	6930120	you're sneaking into a secret base,
6930120	6931700	and there's a huge robot in the way.
6931720	6932920	Normally, you'd be in trouble here
6932920	6934180	and have to run and hide,
6934180	6935460	but because of the consequences
6935460	6937500	of your cool decision, you don't have to.
6937500	6940020	This is your reward for good planning.
6940020	6941020	["Dead Man's Lair"]
6941020	6942020	["Dead Man's Lair"]
6942020	6943020	["Dead Man's Lair"]
6943020	6944020	["Dead Man's Lair"]
6944020	6945020	["Dead Man's Lair"]
6945020	6946020	["Dead Man's Lair"]
6946020	6947020	["Dead Man's Lair"]
6947020	6948020	["Dead Man's Lair"]
6948020	6949020	["Dead Man's Lair"]
6949020	6950020	["Dead Man's Lair"]
6950020	6951020	["Dead Man's Lair"]
6951020	6952860	Choice and consequences.
6952860	6955520	That's the beating heart of Deus Ex.
6955520	6957660	Well, it should be.
6957660	6958820	You see, I lied.
6958820	6960740	I didn't use this rocket launcher I found.
6960780	6962080	I got this one from right here,
6962080	6963960	sitting right next to the fucking robot.
6963960	6966780	The developers almost made a game
6966780	6968780	with decisions and consequences,
6968780	6970340	and then they didn't.
6970340	6971880	They made a game that handholds you
6971880	6973380	through every obstacle.
6973380	6976260	Robots are also easily destroyed by EMP grenades.
6976260	6978920	Having to save your EMP grenades for tough situations
6978920	6981640	would make them really rewarding to use, wouldn't it?
6981640	6983420	But what if people forgot to bring any
6983420	6985260	and wanted to use one on the robot?
6985260	6987840	So they put one directly in front of you
6987840	6989480	as soon as you entered the room.
6989500	6991880	This...fucking sucks.
6991880	6993420	There's no other way of saying it.
6993420	6994840	They fucked up.
6994840	6997440	It's obviously really important for the game
6997440	7000560	that it's not incredibly easy to defeat enemies.
7000560	7003680	If we give you everything,
7003680	7007100	you're not gonna think anymore.
7009900	7012360	Not only is this room just not a challenge,
7012360	7015440	you gain access to a means of instantly killing this robot
7015440	7018080	the literal actual moment you enter the room
7018960	7020500	In this instant,
7020500	7023460	players will realize their choices don't matter.
7023460	7025340	If you saved that rocket launcher,
7025340	7028800	you wasted your time, effort, and inventory space.
7028800	7030920	You were a sucker who thought they were going
7030920	7033520	to experience some kind of reward or punishment
7033520	7035720	for your decision making, but you never will.
7035720	7037860	This goes on for the entire game.
7037860	7039360	The next time you fight these robots,
7039360	7041240	the rocket launcher's right fucking there.
7041240	7042860	The EMP grenades are right there.
7042860	7044660	People complained about the boss fights
7044660	7047240	being just shooting focused and therefore a problem
7047240	7048700	for players who focused on stealth,
7048700	7049740	but that's just not true.
7049740	7051120	Every boss fight takes place
7051120	7052860	in an ocean of weapons and ammo
7052860	7054780	so the player can't possibly get stuck.
7054780	7057320	All the stuff I said was fun is still fun,
7057320	7058940	but the most important moments,
7058940	7061580	the peaks of the mountain of risk and reward,
7061580	7062740	have been eliminated.
7062740	7064740	Mummy bird chewed your dinner for you.
7064740	7065740	Open wide.
7065740	7067580	If you're going to give me the solution
7067580	7070380	to any interesting problem the instant I enter the room,
7070380	7072880	you might as well have made this a cut scene too.
7073360	7074860	Energy unlocked.
7074860	7077200	Self-destruct sequence.
7077200	7079620	Let me give you an example
7079620	7081580	of how this is supposed to work.
7081580	7084740	Resident Evil 4.
7084740	7088080	In Resident Evil 4, you can find a rocket launcher.
7088080	7089580	Just one, though.
7089580	7091620	Additional launchers cost a ton of the cash
7091620	7093380	you could have spent upgrading your weapons,
7093380	7094800	so while they were powerful
7094800	7096640	and let you practically skip bosses,
7096640	7099680	they required a meaningful sacrifice by the player,
7099680	7101100	throwing all that money away,
7101120	7102480	and to even carry a launcher,
7102480	7104540	you gave up a ton of space for one shot
7104540	7106280	that was gone once you used it.
7106280	7108040	Even looking at the rocket launcher
7108040	7110000	in my inventory gives me tingles,
7110000	7112660	and staring at it in the store is tantalizing
7112660	7115260	because it's a choice with meaningful consequences
7115260	7117760	that doesn't condescend to the player's intelligence
7117760	7120140	by giving them one anyway the instant they walk
7120140	7121600	into a room with a boss.
7121600	7123100	You might also notice that your health
7123100	7125220	doesn't regenerate in Resident Evil either
7125220	7127300	because that would be fucking stupid, wouldn't it?
7127300	7129560	Deus Ex worked along a similar principle.
7129560	7131700	The GEP gun was a huge inventory hog.
7131700	7133660	You had to leave so many useful items
7133660	7135900	lying where you found them and know you'd be in trouble
7135900	7138320	if you needed a rebreather or some stealth camo,
7138320	7140360	but it made fighting mechs a breeze,
7140360	7142620	and in a pinch, it saved you a few lockpicks.
7142620	7145120	That trade-off was so satisfying.
7145120	7148040	I'm trying to imagine a version of this game
7148040	7150200	where they just put a GEP gun on the floor
7150200	7151620	near every major enemy,
7151620	7153620	but I don't really need to imagine it.
7153620	7155580	Now do I? To make a Deus Ex game
7155580	7157380	where whenever you face a tough enemy,
7157380	7159380	the means of killing it is right next to it
7159400	7161000	and if it even manages to hurt you,
7161000	7162620	that health just comes back,
7162620	7164920	you have completely removed the choices,
7164920	7167620	consequences, and even most of the difficulty
7167620	7168620	from your game.
7168620	7170300	There's a version of Human Revolution
7170300	7171840	that's truly incredible
7171840	7173960	where it doesn't pull any of its punches,
7173960	7176460	where saving a rocket launcher made a huge difference,
7176460	7178100	where coping with the loss of resources
7178100	7179600	once you used them was interesting,
7179600	7181920	where getting shot actually hurt,
7181920	7184600	and they almost made that game,
7184600	7186260	and it's really kind of sad
7186260	7188520	that they made a just okay one instead
7188540	7190540	because they compromised their own design
7190540	7192040	in the moments it mattered most,
7192040	7194420	they made a game about scarcity of resources,
7194420	7197220	and then got scared not everyone would like that
7197220	7199540	and overcorrected in the other direction.
7199540	7202100	Playing Human Revolution is an exercise in learning
7202100	7206340	in real time why Deus Ex was a more management kind of game
7206340	7208760	and why simplifying everything about an experience
7208760	7211680	that's fun because it's a bit complicated is bad.
7211680	7212900	Oh, it's so rewarding.
7212900	7215100	You can stealth your way over to this panel
7215100	7216860	and hack it and disable the robots.
7216860	7218520	Wow, there's alternative solutions to that.
7218520	7220900	They fucking give you a grenade that kills them instantly.
7220900	7223120	It's incredibly fun to get to plan ahead
7223120	7224780	and decide what's important to you
7224780	7228040	and most importantly, actually see these choices play out
7228040	7229460	for better or for worse.
7229460	7232500	Nothing in Human Revolution is ever important.
7232500	7234460	All the edges have been sanded off.
7234460	7236620	It's a smooth and palatable pebble
7236620	7238500	that isn't particularly disagreeable
7238500	7241500	but slides out the other end completely undigested.
7241500	7244420	You have failed to make a game about scarcity of resources
7244420	7245800	if you put all those resources
7245820	7247740	next to the things you need them for.
7247740	7249280	At that point, you've made a game
7249280	7251960	about how thinking was a waste of time.
7251960	7254160	As soon as you realize you're going to be handed
7254160	7256500	the solution to the problem once you encounter it,
7256500	7258840	the depth of the experience drains away
7258840	7260260	before your very eyes,
7260260	7263100	and to do this after removing a bunch of the weapons
7263100	7265140	means the game is so much more dull
7265140	7267840	and devoid of stuff to play with than it could have been
7267840	7270440	in service to a scarcity that went out the window
7270440	7272980	the instant the player actually needed anything.
7272980	7275400	No, if you want to play with cool weapons,
7275420	7278380	you need to have pre-ordered the game in 2011.
7278380	7280880	No, that's not a joke. That's an order.
7280880	7283600	Get a time machine, call your local GameStop.
7283600	7286380	♪♪
7286380	7288560	Another slight wrinkle in the developers' attempts
7288560	7290260	to balance their game was the fact that...
7290260	7298560	♪♪
7298560	7301100	If you pre-ordered Human Revolution from GameStop
7301100	7303860	or Game, GameStation, or HMV in the UK...
7304280	7307700	you got the Explosive Mission Pack.
7307700	7311820	This pack lets the player start with a new type of grenade,
7311820	7313500	remote explosives that detonate
7313500	7315540	when you hold the grenade button down after throwing them,
7315540	7317660	and a bonus mission towards the end of the game
7317660	7319380	that rewards you with a new weapon.
7319380	7320540	But that's not all.
7320540	7322340	If the player bought the game from Amazon,
7322340	7323760	Best Buy, or Walmart,
7323760	7326000	they got the Tactical Enhancement Pack.
7326000	7328600	With this pack, players start with two new weapons,
7328600	7331480	a double-barreled shotgun, and a silenced sniper rifle.
7331480	7333140	If you were wondering why you couldn't use
7333140	7335100	a silencer upgrade on the sniper rifle,
7335100	7337140	it's not because that would be an unbalanced weapon
7337140	7338300	and the designers knew better.
7338300	7340720	It's because you didn't buy the game from Walmart.
7340720	7343100	The executives at Square Enix are killing us.
7343100	7345720	Their hands are around our soft, Quebec-y necks.
7345720	7348360	We're dying. Help us, please.
7348360	7350060	This pack also lets you start the game
7350060	7351280	with a ton of extra money,
7351280	7354360	which is the funniest possible thing to give people
7354360	7356020	when they have a limited amount of things
7356020	7357440	they're allowed to buy.
7357440	7358440	What the fuck?
7358440	7362000	I'll try to be, uh, as, uh, specific as I can,
7362020	7364020	meaning that I won't say too much,
7364020	7366020	uh, because the marketing guys over there
7366020	7367020	are watching over me.
7367020	7368020	They're right here.
7368020	7370480	And I feel the pressure of, uh,
7370480	7372240	being careful about what I say.
7372240	7375160	These bonuses eventually became purchasable as DLC.
7375160	7376660	After a few months, they effectively
7376660	7378280	became microtransactions.
7378280	7380360	The Explosive Mission Pack also gives the player
7380360	7382500	an automatic unlocking device,
7382500	7385420	which you can use to skip a single hacking minigame.
7385420	7387080	This gives me the opportunity to joke
7387080	7389220	that Human Revolution's hacking is so bad,
7389220	7391760	people paid actual money to skip it.
7391820	7393600	The pack's extra level is a crime

7397860	7399860	It's a mission to rescue Tong's son,
7399860	7402020	who has been kidnapped by the bad guys.
7402020	7403860	Tong's son is Tracer Tong,
7403860	7405900	one of the main characters from the first game.
7405900	7407700	It's pretty shitty they made the thing
7407700	7410160	that's probably the most related to the original plot
7410160	7412120	into a fucking pre-order bonus,
7412120	7414780	really milking the people who cared about Deus Ex.
7414780	7416240	As thanks for saving his son,
7416240	7417700	Tong gives you the grenade launcher,
7417700	7421460	a powerful and fun weapon you have two levels left to use.
7421460	7422960	This is genius right here.

7429580	7431120	The trailer for this pre-order bonus
7431120	7432720	uses footage of the weapons in levels
7432720	7435460	you can never use it in because you get it so late.
7435460	7437960	I wouldn't go as far as to call this false advertising.
7437960	7440340	Who cares? But it's funny the most powerful weapons
7440340	7441640	are consistently given to you
7441640	7443600	after all the best spots to use them.
7443600	7446100	Fun fact, I was born and raised in West Yorkshire,
7446100	7447940	which is my way of saying when this game came out,
7447940	7449140	I was extremely poor.
7449160	7451620	I only got to play it because a French friend of mine
7451620	7453780	who really loved Deus Ex had pre-ordered it
7453780	7456340	because he wanted that DLC and I think a statue
7456340	7458720	of Adam Jensen that came with some versions of the game,
7458720	7460380	and then because he was a game critic
7460380	7462300	or worked at a related company or something,
7462300	7464300	he got given a free copy he didn't need
7464300	7465500	and he gave it to me.
7465500	7467420	So if you're watching this, thanks, Thomas.
7467420	7469880	I wouldn't have got to play this game for years otherwise.
7469880	7472100	I'm glad I finally have the opportunity to thank you
7472100	7474800	in the middle of a YouTube video a decade later.
7474800	7476980	Pre-order bonuses and the microtransactions
7476980	7479280	they later became are bad for everyone.
7479280	7481480	They're bad for players, they're bad for developers
7481480	7484060	getting made to do things they know are bad for the game,
7484060	7485820	and then having to listen to people like me
7485820	7487740	whining about it like it's their fault.
7487740	7489360	The only people who benefit
7489360	7491020	are the people this makes money for,
7491020	7494020	which means it's probably not going away anytime soon.
7494020	7495860	But at some point, you know,
7495860	7497820	games have to make money.

7536660	7540660	♪♪
7540660	7542160	The level design of Immersive Sims
7542160	7543880	is one of the most important parts.
7543880	7545420	You can have all the cool guns
7545420	7547080	and augmentations in the world,
7547080	7549580	but if that world doesn't create fun opportunities
7549580	7552120	for using them, then those tools are going to waste,
7552120	7554660	like the instant pot in the back of your cupboard right now.
7554660	7556660	You also have to find ways of making the player
7556660	7558160	engage with the levels, for example,
7558160	7560660	by giving rewards for bothering to explore.
7560660	7564160	You want constant rewards to drive players onward, okay?
7564160	7566160	You have to reward players regularly.
7566160	7568420	It's a bit of a disappointment in this department.
7568420	7570160	Half the stuff you'd normally be searching for
7570160	7572500	in a Deus Ex game isn't there to find
7572500	7574160	because scarcity was too important
7574160	7575660	to give you too many big rewards
7575660	7577160	and there are no longer multi-tools
7577160	7579880	or lockpicks to find because the newfound omnipresence
7579880	7581660	of hacking has replaced the need for them.
7581660	7583660	The main thing you'll find when you're exploring
7583660	7586420	is a couple of bullets, a meager amount of credits
7586420	7588160	which you can't spend on anything,
7588160	7589420	oh, and how can I forget,
7589420	7591420	dozens upon dozens of energy bars
7591420	7593660	which you don't need because the first battery
7593660	7596160	refills on its own, and since, like we covered earlier,
7596160	7598660	Praxis points are a kind of boring upgrade system,
7598660	7600660	there are no truly nice surprises
7600660	7602660	that incentivize further exploration.
7602660	7605660	You barely find anything in a police station armory.
7605660	7607420	You're not going to find much in the back alleys
7607420	7608660	of Detroit or Hengsha.
7608660	7610960	What is here feels a little too similar
7610960	7612660	to the original for its own good.
7612660	7613660	At a certain point,
7613660	7615660	it starts to feel like a half-hearted remake.
7615660	7618160	Like, even in shockingly small details
7618160	7620160	like how you and your pilot get intercepted
7620160	7621160	on your way to China
7621160	7622660	or how your pilot can optionally die
7622660	7624660	or how the first mission ends with you deciding
7624660	7626660	whether or not to let a terrorist leader live
7626660	7627660	and as soon as you make that choice,
7627660	7629160	the cops instantly arrive
7629160	7630660	and all the enemies in the level evaporate
7630660	7632160	and get replaced by cops
7632160	7634660	or how you fight exactly three augmented bosses
7634660	7637160	throughout the game, a big guy, a small lady,
7637160	7639160	and a guy who can turn invisible
7639160	7640660	and wields a plasma rifle
7640660	7642660	or the way the game's three main locations
7642660	7644660	are an American city, a Chinese city,
7644660	7645660	and a French city
7645660	7646660	although Human Revolution
7646660	7648160	sets its French part in Montreal
7648160	7649660	for what I assume are tax reasons
7649660	7652160	and the city environment itself got cut
7652160	7654660	so Montreal is just a large office building
7654660	7656660	you land on and then leave.
7656660	7659160	For the record, in the Q&A section of his GDC talk,
7659160	7660660	Lapicus got asked if he thought
7660660	7662660	the generally good reception of Human Revolution
7662660	7664660	was partially down to them directly recreating
7664660	7666160	a lot of the original's stuff.
7666160	7668660	It follows the original Deus Ex
7668660	7672160	almost act for act, story beat for story beat.
7672160	7674160	I'm wondering how much you feel
7674160	7676660	that contributed to the acceptance of it.
7676660	7678160	First off, I'd like to react to your comment
7678160	7680660	that the game follows the first game beat by beat.
7680660	7682160	It might be true.
7682160	7683660	It wasn't our intention.
7683660	7685160	It's not how we designed the game.
7685160	7686660	It's not how it was written.
7686660	7689160	So if that's the case, it's a coincidence.
7689160	7690660	I don't know if it's better or worse
7690660	7692660	the game was like this by accident
7692660	7694160	but that's what the game is like
7694160	7695660	so I don't know what to tell you.
7695660	7697160	It's not a huge deal that they're similar.
7697160	7698660	It's the same series,
7698660	7700160	so similarities are welcome if anything,
7700160	7703160	but a problem with, accidentally or otherwise,
7703160	7705160	making your levels a lot like the originals
7705160	7707160	is it makes what's missing stick out
7707160	7709660	like a giant robot sitting next to the weapon
7709660	7711160	that instantly kills it.
7711160	7713660	Liberty Island is a famously amazing level.
7713660	7716660	It's an entire open island with two different docks,
7716660	7719660	people to talk to to get a key to get inside if you want.
7719660	7721160	About time you sh**.
7721160	7723160	A sunken freighter full of stuff to find,
7723160	7724660	and of course an entire building
7724660	7726160	leading up into the Statue of Liberty.
7726160	7728160	This level design is ultimately
7728160	7730660	why Deus Ex is so fantastic.
7730660	7732660	It feels like an entire physical space
7732660	7734160	you can handle how you want.
7734160	7736660	Liberty Island is 12 different levels
7736660	7738660	depending on how someone plays it.
7738660	7741160	Human Revolution's levels are largely a straight line
7741160	7743660	that sometimes opens out into a larger box
7743660	7745160	you can be a little more creative in
7745160	7747660	which funnels right back into another straight line.
7747660	7750160	The first mission, the parallel with Liberty Island,
7750160	7752660	is a straight shot from the drop-off point on a rooftop
7752660	7754660	to a pickup on another rooftop
7754660	7756660	featuring bottlenecks in the form of corridors
7756660	7758660	and elevators that you're required to use
7758660	7761660	to progress with zero alternatives.
7761660	7763660	Compare and contrast the level of freedom here.
7763660	7765660	The Statue of Liberty has several ways in
7765660	7767660	from different angles including just climbing
7767660	7769160	over half the level.
7769160	7770660	To get into the warehouse, you can go in
7770660	7772660	through the front door or climb up on top
7772660	7774660	of the entrance and go in through a vent
7774660	7776660	just above the front door which comes out
7776660	7779660	into the other side of the same room.
7779660	7781660	It takes about five seconds to walk over here
7781660	7783660	if you come in from the front entrance.
7783660	7785160	There is no rear entrance,
7785160	7787160	and there's no way over this part of the level
7787160	7788660	by getting on the plant's roof
7788660	7790160	and finding another entryway.
7790160	7792660	It's immediately clear how much less freedom
7792660	7793660	the player has.
7793660	7795160	There are choices in how to navigate,
7795160	7796660	but they don't lead anywhere
7796660	7798660	particularly new or different.
7798660	7800660	The only way to progress is to traverse the level
7800660	7802660	mostly linearly, but occasionally,
7802660	7805660	you get to decide which side of the room you do it in.
7805660	7808160	The smoking gun betraying the closed-off nature
7808160	7811160	of the levels is the fact none of the windows work.
7811160	7815660	In Deus Ex 1, if a building has a window,
7815660	7817660	you can break the window and jump out.
7817660	7819660	Bang, you just invented a new exit.
7819660	7822160	In many of Human Revolution's buildings,
7822160	7824160	most of the windows are actually painted on
7824160	7826160	and you can't get out through them in any way.
7826160	7828160	In an actual immersive sim,
7828160	7830160	this would be a way in and out of the building.
7830160	7832160	That's what makes it immersive.
7832160	7834160	It feels like a building in a world.
7834160	7836160	This is just a rectangular corridor
7836160	7839660	with windows used to imply a complicated outside world
7839660	7841160	you never get to interact with.
7841160	7843160	Look at Jensen's apartment for a second.
7843160	7845160	The modern graphics definitely make it look
7845160	7846660	cooler than the original.
7846660	7849160	I love the Blade Runner light shaft thing with the blinds,
7849160	7850660	but in the original game's apartment,
7850660	7852660	you don't need to come in through the front door.
7852660	7855160	You can climb up a fire escape and come in through the window.
7855160	7857660	Jensen's apartment is designed to reference the original.
7857660	7860160	It's got a cute stash of loot hidden in a similar way,
7860160	7861660	but it doesn't seem to understand
7861660	7864660	the actual gameplay value of the original apartment's design.
7864660	7866660	The only way out is to get to the elevator,
7866660	7869660	ride it down, then walk out through the front door.
7869660	7871660	The windows are just for show.
7871660	7874160	I've heard so much praise for this game over the years,
7874160	7876160	how it's one of the best immersive sims,
7876160	7878160	a real successor to Deus Ex,
7878160	7879660	but for all the genuine improvements
7879660	7881660	and understandable mechanical changes,
7881660	7884660	the levels you're doing it in are restrictive and dull.
7884660	7887160	So much of the game is effectively a linear path
7887160	7890660	which leads to an elevator to the next linear path.
7890660	7892160	Seriously, there are so many areas
7892160	7895160	whose main objective is to get to an elevator.
7895160	7897160	There's a part in Hengsha where you do a whole level
7897160	7898660	to get to an elevator,
7898660	7900160	and then while you're in the elevator,
7900160	7902160	Pritchard calls you to give you your next objective.
7902160	7904660	Pritchard, I'm in an elevator leading to the bangoo.
7904660	7906660	Look for a second elevator once you're there.
7906660	7909160	The game is so fond of making elevators
7909160	7911160	the path to the next area that there is not one,
7911160	7913160	not two, but five sequences
7913160	7916160	where you go on a really long, slow elevator ride
7916160	7918160	and if you're lucky, something interesting
7918160	7919660	is happening out the window
7919660	7921160	or a character calls you on the phone.
7921160	7923660	Seriously, you just sit in an elevator
7923660	7927160	for a full minute for no reason multiple times.
7927160	7929160	Once would be fine to build tension
7929160	7930660	before a big boss fight or something,
7930660	7932160	but it's near constant.
7932160	7934160	You ride two different elevators
7934160	7936660	in the unskippable opening sequence alone.

7944160	7946160	Standing in an elevator.
7946160	7947660	There's a sequence where the objective
7947660	7949660	is to trigger an elevator and then hide from
7949660	7951660	or fight enemies until it gets to you
7951660	7952660	to pick you up.
7952660	7954160	Since combat is pretty easy,
7954160	7955660	especially if you hack the turret,
7955660	7957160	enemies don't know how to handle turrets
7957160	7958660	in the slightest. It's really weird.
7958660	7960660	Everyone dies in the first five seconds,
7960660	7962160	and you're just sitting there
7962160	7963660	during what was meant to be
7963660	7965660	a tense struggle for survival.

7996660	7998160	I've heard the excuse this is a way
7998160	8000160	of disguising loading between areas,
8000160	8001660	but many of them last much longer
8001660	8004160	than any of the actual loading screens take,
8004160	8005660	and several of them lead directly
8005660	8007160	into a loading screen anyway,
8007160	8009160	so don't give me any of that gubbins.
8009160	8011160	It's boring, overly compartmentalized
8011160	8012660	level design however you slice it,
8012660	8015160	and excuses don't make elevators fun.

8017660	8019160	That just came out of me.
8019160	8021160	I think the reason they made them like this
8021160	8022660	was for dramatic effect.
8022660	8024660	When you sit in an elevator to Upper Hengsha
8024660	8027160	for 30 actual seconds and come out
8027160	8029160	and suddenly you're at the top of a high-rise building
8029160	8030660	overlooking a new environment,
8030660	8032160	one you never get to actually visit,
8032160	8034160	you feel like you did a lot more
8034160	8036160	than walk down a linear corridor
8036160	8038160	to an elevator...twice.
8038160	8040660	Look what an expansive world we're in.
8040660	8041660	The objective of this level?
8041660	8043660	To get to the data core room
8043660	8045660	by getting to the elevator.
8045660	8047660	Then you're given a cut scene where your objective
8047660	8049660	changes to confronting Zhao Yunru,
8049660	8051660	the CEO from before, to have that cut scene.
8051660	8054660	You confront her by getting to another elevator
8054660	8055660	to her penthouse.
8055660	8058160	This elevator trip takes a full minute.
8059160	8061160	This is only the third longest eleva-
8061160	8063160	The current Human Revolution speedrun
8063160	8066160	by Rampancy is 37 minutes long.
8066160	8068160	Eight and a half minutes of the run
8068160	8070160	is spent in an elevator.
8070160	8073160	Uncomfortably close to a quarter of this speedrun
8073160	8075160	is sitting and waiting,
8075160	8077160	and this is the best-case scenario.
8077160	8079160	This guy does cool shit like skip waiting
8079160	8081160	for that one elevator by shoving himself through the door.
8081160	8083160	In fact, most of the run's cleverest tricks
8083160	8085160	involve throwing himself through the door
8085160	8087160	In fact, most of the run's cleverest tricks
8087160	8089160	involve finding ways to avoid
8089160	8091160	having to wait in an elevator even longer.
8091160	8093160	The time wasted here isn't even the real problem.
8093160	8095160	Where the original game's levels
8095160	8097160	were usually large outdoor spaces
8097160	8099160	with multiple ways in and out of the buildings
8099160	8100160	with objectives in them,
8100160	8102160	encouraging player creativity
8102160	8103160	and freedom of choice,
8103160	8106160	Human Revolution is wandering between elevators
8106160	8108160	with ornate windows overlooking
8108160	8109160	the kinds of environment
8109160	8111160	you'd actually want to be playing in.
8111160	8113160	The level design still has some choice in it,
8113160	8115160	and occasionally the kinds of freedom
8115160	8117160	you'd really want like the police station,
8117160	8119160	which is great and offers a fantastic range of choices
8119160	8120160	for how to deal with it,
8120160	8121160	but a majority of the game
8121160	8124160	is strangely compartmentalized, constrained,
8124160	8126160	a thin tube funneling you
8126160	8128160	to the next important cut scene.
8128160	8130160	I know I'm venting a lot about those cut scenes,
8130160	8132160	but this gives me an excellent opportunity
8132160	8135160	to segue into this game's problem with vents.
8135160	8138160	Okay, in this sequence I've shown you a few times before,
8138160	8140160	there's four guys making patrols around this area,
8140160	8142160	more guys off in the side halls,
8142160	8144160	and a doorway leading ahead to the next part of the level,
8144160	8146160	but this area that's harder to get to unseen
8146160	8148160	is the room the hostages are in.
8148160	8150160	Once you get inside, you're locked in by a trap
8150160	8152160	and have to frantically disarm the bomb
8152160	8153160	by hacking it or learning the password
8153160	8155160	or just smashing the tubes,
8155160	8157160	which is a hilarious thing to discover you can do.
8157160	8158160	This is a great sequence.
8158160	8160160	Getting into this room and saving the hostages
8160160	8162160	is the first level's optional challenging
8162160	8163160	secondary objective,
8163160	8165160	and the people who designed the stealth system
8165160	8167160	and guard patrols act like it.
8167160	8169160	It's much harder to stealth your way in here
8169160	8170160	than the critical path.
8170160	8172160	I mean, if you shoot all the guys,
8172160	8173160	it's easy and bullshit,
8173160	8174160	but you can see how the stealth
8174160	8175160	was designed to be fun,
8175160	8177160	so you can do all of that,
8177160	8178160	all that fun learning the patrols
8178160	8180160	and carefully navigating,
8180160	8182160	or you can go in the vent next to the entrance to the room,
8182160	8185160	which leads directly into the room with the hostages.
8185160	8188160	Now, this first one kind of works.
8188160	8190160	It's a reward for exploration.
8190160	8192160	You have to find the vent hidden behind a box,
8192160	8193160	so if you're doing this,
8193160	8195160	it means you chose to look around a little more
8195160	8196160	and get a sense of your surroundings.
8196160	8198160	I'm not a big fan of how the vent
8198160	8200160	is a definitive solution to the problem, though.
8200160	8203160	In Deus Ex, vents were like vents.
8203160	8204160	You could use them to your advantage,
8204160	8206160	but they never took you directly
8206160	8207160	from the start of the room
8207160	8209160	to the place you needed to go to win.
8209160	8210160	In the subway, for example,
8210160	8212160	to free the hostages using stealth,
8212160	8213160	you had to find a vent
8213160	8214160	and then meticulously crawl through
8214160	8216160	an entire ventilation system
8216160	8217160	and come out of the right one
8217160	8219160	so you wouldn't get seen instantly.
8219160	8221160	The vents were part of the challenge,
8221160	8222160	not the solution.
8222160	8224160	In this game, more often than not,
8224160	8227160	vents take you directly past the problem.
8227160	8229160	You could deal with the guys in the next area
8229160	8231160	using stealth or combat,
8231160	8233160	or you can go in the vent next to where you came in
8233160	8234160	that takes you past them.
8234160	8235160	You could.
8235160	8236160	Oh, fucking hell, guys.
8236160	8237160	You see the vent here
8237160	8238160	before you even see the thing
8238160	8239160	the vent takes you past.
8239160	8241160	You could deal with this turret
8241160	8242160	and landmine on the wall
8242160	8244160	and camera which will set off the alarms
8244160	8246160	or go over here and hack the camera.
8246160	8248160	You know, the intended challenge of the room.
8248160	8249160	The point of this room is to show you
8249160	8250160	the value of hacking.
8250160	8252160	Or you could get in the vent
8252160	8253160	that leads directly behind all of it
8253160	8255160	and just walk past.
8255160	8256160	If being able to kill everyone
8256160	8258160	easily hurt the game's design,
8258160	8259160	being able to just get in a vent
8259160	8260160	and go past all of it
8260160	8262160	fucking executes it behind the woodshed.
8262160	8264160	Look, maybe I'm smarter than the average gang
8264160	8266160	of anti-augmentation terrorists,
8266160	8268160	but whoever set this shit up
8268160	8269160	must have seen the vent, right?
8269160	8270160	Wait a second.
8270160	8272160	Why didn't the hostages just go in the vent?
8272160	8273160	Just leave through the vent.
8273160	8274160	What the fuck are you doing?
8274160	8275160	This is how,
8275160	8277160	and I'm going to make a conservative estimate,
8277160	8280160	85,000% of the game's levels work.
8280160	8281160	There's this one level in Hengsha
8281160	8283160	where the bad guys have locked down
8283160	8284160	an apartment complex
8284160	8285160	and you have to get inside
8285160	8286160	to get to the hacker's computer
8286160	8287160	I mentioned before.
8287160	8289160	Now, the front entrance is blocked off,
8289160	8291160	so you either have to get into a big fight right away
8291160	8293160	or maybe you can go all the way around the sides
8293160	8294160	and up a ladder
8294160	8296160	and then you can sneakily take out a few guys
8296160	8297160	and use stealth from there.
8297160	8298160	Wow, multiple paths.
8298160	8299160	This level's pretty good.
8299160	8301160	The developers are trying to reward you
8301160	8303160	for thinking logically about the 3D space
8303160	8304160	or there's a vent right here.
8304160	8306160	This vent takes you inside the complex
8306160	8308160	and into a well-guarded area
8308160	8309160	with some interesting points of cover.
8309160	8311160	This area could be a really cool stealth experience.
8311160	8313160	Oh, my God, I can't believe you found another vent.
8313160	8315160	You're such a good boy.
8315160	8317160	This vent takes you to the upper ground level
8317160	8319160	you could have had a fun time sneaking to
8319160	8321160	where you can easily just walk to the elevator
8321160	8323160	to the top floor without being seen.
8323160	8324160	On the top floor, you...
8324160	8325160	Holy shit!
8325160	8327160	I haven't even left the elevator!
8327160	8328160	Fucking come on, guys!
8328160	8330160	This vent takes you past all the guards
8330160	8333160	to directly next to the computer you need to access.
8333160	8336160	This is the absolute bottom of the downward spiral
8336160	8338160	that starts when you try to make a game
8338160	8339160	like Deus Ex simpler.
8339160	8342160	You make this how exploration works
8342160	8343160	and if you go in the other side,
8343160	8345160	the alternative way in I mentioned,
8345160	8347160	you know where it leads?
8347160	8348160	To a vent.
8348160	8350160	The vent takes you up the same elevator shaft
8350160	8353160	to a vent that comes out next to the other vent.
8353160	8355160	This is anti-level design.
8355160	8357160	You're literally skipping most of the levels
8357160	8358160	that were designed.
8358160	8360160	I've basically just ruined the game for you.
8360160	8362160	Once you realize that's how they're using vents,
8362160	8363160	you can't stop seeing it.
8363160	8365160	If you fail the dialogue challenge
8365160	8366160	to get an audience with Tong,
8366160	8368160	you have to come back and try again
8368160	8369160	to find out what he knows,
8369160	8371160	but don't worry, pal, because,
8371160	8373160	and I bet this'll be a surprise to you,
8373160	8374160	there's a vent next to his office
8374160	8375160	and it triggers a cutscene
8375160	8377160	where you learn the same information anyway.
8377160	8379160	This is the quest design equivalent
8379160	8382160	of putting a rocket launcher next to all the hard enemies.
8382160	8384160	You could talk Taggart into telling you
8384160	8386160	where Sanderval is or you'll never guess.
8386160	8387160	You'll never fucking guess.
8387160	8389160	You'll never fucking guess!
8389160	8391160	The vent drops you directly into his office
8391160	8393160	next to the computer with the information on it.
8393160	8395160	No thinking required.
8395160	8398160	The main challenge in this level is staying awake.
8399160	8401160	About time. What happened?
8401160	8404160	You get stuck in an air duct on the way over?
8404160	8406160	Ha ha, yeah, good one. Fuck off, Pritchard.
8406160	8408160	If you think this is a good example
8408160	8409160	of Deus Ex level design,
8409160	8411160	you need to stop settling for less in life
8411160	8412160	before it's too late.
8412160	8415160	You matter and you deserve better than this.
8415160	8416160	Every vent in Human Revolution,
8416160	8419160	including ones in maximum security buildings
8419160	8421160	that lead right to their important shit,
8421160	8422160	is yours to open for free
8422160	8424160	because locks don't exist anymore
8424160	8426160	and locking a vent using a keypad
8426160	8428160	would look really silly.
8428160	8430160	Some of the level designers even realized
8430160	8432160	they'd made the vents too easy a solution
8432160	8434160	and started trying to hide them,
8434160	8436160	which doesn't work because, you know, they glow,
8436160	8437160	so they started trying to block them
8437160	8439160	using heavy objects so you at least need
8439160	8441160	an augmentation to get to them.
8441160	8443160	Look how hard they had to work to get around the fact
8443160	8446160	they couldn't just lock the vents.
8446160	8448160	Why was the game built like this?
8448160	8449160	I don't know.
8449160	8451160	Maybe the designers had fond memories
8451160	8452160	of solving problems using vents
8452160	8454160	in other immersive sims and concluded
8454160	8456160	that vents equal good game design,
8456160	8459160	but the point was to make a world feel interconnected
8459160	8460160	like a real place would be
8460160	8462160	and make players who took the time to look around
8462160	8464160	feel rewarded for their ingenuity
8464160	8465160	or attention to detail.
8465160	8468160	Vents weren't the only kind of secret in Deus Ex.
8468160	8470160	There were secrets hidden all over the place,
8470160	8472160	buttons hidden behind innocuous objects
8472160	8474160	that unlock treasure troves of stuff,
8474160	8475160	or maybe the pinball machine
8475160	8477160	you've seen over half a dozen of already
8477160	8479160	activates a secret door if you play with this one.
8479160	8482160	These two are both in the same level even.
8482160	8483160	After this happens,
8483160	8484160	you'll be checking every pinball machine
8484160	8486160	in the rest of the world just in case.
8486160	8489160	There is nothing remotely like this in Human Revolution
8489160	8491160	except for one specific thing.
8491160	8493160	This stuffed animal activates the secret door
8493160	8495160	into the hacker's man cave,
8495160	8497160	but it's not used to discover a secret.
8497160	8498160	The cave is already visible
8498160	8500160	because the bad guys blew a wall down.
8500160	8501160	This makes for some really cool
8501160	8502160	environmental storytelling though.
8502160	8504160	The Mercs couldn't find the way
8504160	8505160	of opening the secret entrance,
8505160	8507160	so they had to redecorate.
8507160	8509160	It's funny, but serious question.
8509160	8512160	Why aren't there any actual secrets like this in the game?
8512160	8514160	There isn't anything even remotely as cool
8514160	8515160	as the pinball machine.
8515160	8518160	Instead, potential explorers get to say,
8518160	8519160	I wonder what's in this room.
8519160	8522160	Oh, it's a vent every few minutes.
8522160	8523160	This is the vent room.
8523160	8525160	Everyone has one of these in the future.
8525160	8527160	It's horribly inefficient,
8527160	8530160	but the powerful vent lobby won't let us change the laws.
8530160	8531160	The hacker's apartment is really good
8531160	8533160	at demonstrating the blandness
8533160	8535160	of the new simpler level design
8535160	8537160	because it's another accidental knockoff
8537160	8538160	of a level from Deus Ex I,
8538160	8540160	this time Maggie Chow's apartment in Hong Kong.
8540160	8542160	As soon as you look at it, the difference is clear.
8542160	8545160	You're not forced to hack a computer for one,
8545160	8546160	but you also have more choices
8546160	8548160	for how to deal with the situation.
8548160	8550160	Taking the elevator or sneaking into the shaft
8550160	8552160	aren't the only entrances.
8552160	8553160	You can get in from the roof entrance
8553160	8555160	or, you know, blow open the skylight
8555160	8556160	and get in that way.
8556160	8558160	You can also get in by platforming
8558160	8560160	from neighboring buildings that are easier to get into
8560160	8562160	and aren't guarded by mechs,
8562160	8563160	and once you're done, you can leave
8563160	8565160	by literally jumping off the roof
8565160	8567160	or out the window and using your cyber legs
8567160	8568160	to land without dying.
8568160	8570160	This feels like an apartment

8573160	8575160	This feels like a corridor with a nice background
8575160	8577160	outside some unbreakable windows,
8577160	8578160	but hey, lookie here.
8578160	8580160	There's a balcony out there.
8580160	8581160	Oh, and what's this?
8581160	8583160	A skylight just like Maggie Chow's apartment,
8583160	8585160	but you can't do anything with them.
8585160	8588160	This level has none of what made the original level
8588160	8589160	truly open-ended and free.
8589160	8592160	The skylight and balcony are just for show.
8592160	8594160	You come in and out of this whole area
8594160	8595160	through one of two entryways
8595160	8597160	which are next to each other.
8597160	8600160	Sophie's choice, a vent or an elevator.
8600160	8602160	No, wait, there's actually a super secret way in.
8602160	8604160	If you stack boxes and have the high jump power,
8604160	8606160	you can get into this higher level of the shaft
8606160	8607160	above the vent.
8607160	8609160	It leads to another vent.
8609160	8611160	It comes out right next to the other vents
8611160	8612160	and the elevator.
8612160	8614160	♪ ♪
8614160	8615160	Level design!
8615160	8618160	The design is so ridiculously oversimplified
8618160	8620160	that it actually messes with the story and quests
8620160	8623160	the game is trying to use the levels for.
8623160	8624160	In the Hengsha level, for example,
8624160	8626160	to progress to the next mission,
8626160	8628160	you have to get into the employee entrance
8628160	8629160	of Taiyong Medical,
8629160	8631160	but the entrance is, guess what,
8631160	8633160	the only building in the universe
8633160	8635160	that isn't locked using the same fucking keypad
8635160	8636160	so you can't hack it.
8636160	8639160	The developers realized players could just leave the hub
8639160	8641160	and go to the next level if they knew where to go
8641160	8643160	so they had to reinvent the concept of the key.
8643160	8645160	Once the player learns that's where they have to go,
8645160	8648160	they're sent on a quest to find a Taiyong Medical key card
8648160	8649160	to get in here.
8649160	8651160	However, because the world map is so empty
8651160	8653160	and there aren't that many places to explore,
8653160	8655160	most players found it already by accident
8655160	8656160	several hours ago.
8656160	8658160	Well, what do you know, windmill?
8658160	8660160	I've already got an employee card.
8660160	8662160	You begin the Hengsha level right outside this hotel,
8662160	8664160	and since most players explore the thing
8664160	8666160	put right in front of them, they go inside.
8666160	8669160	When inside, you find one of the game's four side quests,
8669160	8671160	so it's good they made it easy to find.
8671160	8673160	The key card it'll turn out you need in a few hours
8673160	8675160	is just sitting on a table nearby.
8675160	8678160	Less than a minute's walk from the start of the level,
8678160	8681160	you have already accidentally skipped part of it.
8681160	8683160	There's even a special dialogue between Jensen and Malek
8683160	8685160	for picking it up before you know you'll need it
8685160	8686160	for anything.
8686160	8687160	Tell me something, Malek.
8687160	8690160	You think a smart card with a Taiyong Medical logo on it
8690160	8692160	will come in handy in this town?
8692160	8694160	Maybe. Why are you asking?
8694160	8696160	No reason. Just thinking ahead.
8696160	8698160	Hey, looks like I've accidentally beaten
8698160	8700160	a later quest by walking into the building
8700160	8702160	next to where you dropped me off, Malek.
8702160	8703160	Whoops.
8703160	8705160	Who takes their company key card out of their wallet
8705160	8707160	and puts it on the fucking coffee table like that?
8707160	8708160	What the fuck is this?
8708160	8710160	Now, I love the idea of being sent on a quest
8710160	8711160	to find a key card,
8711160	8712160	which you could have found way earlier.
8712160	8715160	That's great, but levels this simplistic
8715160	8717160	mean you aren't actually finding it early
8717160	8718160	if you're big on exploring.
8718160	8721160	You're finding it immediately within minutes of starting
8721160	8723160	if you take a passing interest in your surroundings.
8723160	8726160	Now, let's add one extra layer of silliness to this
8726160	8728160	because before you find out you need that key card,
8728160	8731160	your mission requires you to get to Tong in the Hive.
8731160	8733160	To get into the Hive, you need to talk your way in
8733160	8735160	or bribe the guy at the door
8735160	8738160	or somehow gain access to someone's membership card.
8738160	8740160	The membership card is one floor down
8740160	8742160	in the same building with the other key card.
8742160	8743160	Why are you asking?
8743160	8744160	No reason.
8744160	8746160	Just thinking ahead.
8746160	8750160	A shockingly huge amount of players
8750160	8752160	are going to find these items long before
8752160	8754160	they even know what they do.
8754160	8756160	That's not clever sequence breaking.
8756160	8759160	That's a very poorly designed sequence.
8759160	8761160	Oh, but if you don't find the membership card
8761160	8763160	and don't have the money to get in, no problem.
8763160	8765160	There's a fucking vent around the back
8765160	8766160	leading right inside.
8766160	8768160	The more enclosed levels mean a lot of the game's
8768160	8770160	augmentations and abilities aren't as fun
8770160	8772160	as they easily could have been.
8772160	8774160	In Deus Ex, having the ability to fall a large distance
8774160	8777160	without dying changed the shape of the world for you.
8777160	8780160	Rooftops were now exits that prevented having to deal
8780160	8783160	with enemies you'd have run into taking the normal way down.
8783160	8786160	Human Revolution's slow fall power would work the same way
8786160	8788160	except for the fact the levels aren't designed
8788160	8789160	as interesting 3D spaces,
8789160	8792160	so only a select few places offer this type of situation.
8792160	8795160	So instead, to make the augmentation more useful
8795160	8797160	than the design can properly accommodate,
8797160	8799160	long falls are added specifically for players
8799160	8801160	to have something to do with that power,
8801160	8803160	like this elevator shaft in Detroit.
8803160	8806160	The game is going, look, one specific place
8806160	8807160	for you to use your powers.
8807160	8809160	You're so creative!
8809160	8811160	Instead of making a world where creative players
8811160	8813160	naturally benefited from having this ability.
8813160	8816160	There is an example of the kind of free-form use
8816160	8818160	of a building's height as an entrance in the game, though.
8818160	8821160	Unfortunately, it's in a cut scene.
8821160	8823160	Bell Tower break into the Alice Garden pods
8823160	8825160	through the ceiling once you bring the key card
8825160	8826160	to the hacker.
8826160	8829160	NPCs get to have more fun with your powers than you do.
8829160	8832160	You can only enter and leave this entire pod hotel
8832160	8833160	through the front door.
8833160	8835160	There is no alternative way in.
8835160	8837160	This is because they want you to be unable to leave
8837160	8839160	when these guys drop in and block off the exit,
8839160	8841160	forcing you to leave through, you guessed it,
8841160	8843160	a series of linear corridors with vents
8843160	8845160	skipping any of the difficult parts,
8845160	8848160	leading to a new back exit which only now opened up.
8848160	8850160	The experience you do have is pretty fun
8850160	8851160	for what it is, sure,
8851160	8854160	but this simply isn't how Deus Ex levels should work.
8855160	8856160	Oh!
8856160	8857160	Oh!
8857160	8858160	Oh!
8858160	8859160	Oh!
8859160	8860160	Oh!
8860160	8861160	Oh!
8861160	8862160	Oh!
8862160	8863160	Oh!
8863160	8864160	Oh!
8864160	8865160	Oh!
8865160	8866160	Oh!
8866160	8867160	Oh!
8869160	8871160	My problem with this design is it doesn't let players
8871160	8873160	be clever by themselves.
8873160	8875160	It's contingent on a game designer giving you
8875160	8877160	something clever to do with it.
8877160	8879160	If they forget to come up with some,
8879160	8882160	which they often do, you're shit out of luck, Buddy Boy.
8882160	8885160	Without tall buildings with rooftop entrances and exits,
8885160	8887160	apart from literally one in the warehouses
8887160	8889160	I didn't forget, don't be a pedant,
8889160	8891160	the Icarus landing system is reduced
8891160	8893160	from a fantastic addition to the player's arsenal
8893160	8895160	to a slightly faster alternative
8895160	8897160	to taking the ladder down certain drops
8897160	8899160	and only slightly faster because the falling animation
8899160	8901160	is slow and annoying.
8901160	8903160	The other big augmentation that gets wasted here
8903160	8905160	is the ability to punch through certain walls.
8905160	8907160	This powers a really interesting idea,
8907160	8909160	opening up new paths by cutting through
8909160	8911160	destructible parts of the level,
8911160	8913160	and it only gets to be fun in practice
8913160	8915160	if the developers come up with interesting ways of using it.
8915160	8917160	It feels like they made a lot of the levels
8917160	8919160	and then went, oh, shit,
8919160	8921160	and tried to add a bunch of punchable walls
8921160	8923160	at the last second so players who got it
8923160	8925160	feel like they can do something with it.
8925160	8928160	Wait, what's this window showing if the room is that small?
8928160	8930160	What is going on here?
8930160	8932160	I could be wrong, but I have a sneaking suspicion
8932160	8934160	this wall was added a bit late.
8934160	8937160	You want to know a cool thing about doors in Deus Ex?
8937160	8939160	Wow, Deus Ex is such a cool game
8939160	8941160	that I'm about to enjoy telling you how doors work.
8941160	8943160	Doors weren't just a thing you could access
8943160	8946160	by finding keys or learning the code to a keypad
8946160	8948160	or by hacking the computer it was hooked up to
8948160	8950160	or by learning the password some other way
8950160	8952160	or by picking them.
8952160	8954160	They were also physical, actual doors,
8954160	8956160	which means you could just destroy them.
8956160	8961160	The rocket launcher is nature's lockpick.
8961160	8963160	That's so many options,
8963160	8965160	and being able to just break the door
8965160	8967160	is believable and adds to the feeling
8968160	8970160	You can destroy doors in Human Revolution
8970160	8972160	if you have a grenade or a lot of bullets,
8972160	8975160	though the scarcity of resources makes this a bit of a waste.
8975160	8977160	The mechanic is implemented horribly.
8977160	8980160	Locked doors don't show you how much health they have
8980160	8982160	or even indicate they can be damaged
8982160	8984160	until they suddenly shatter into dust.
8984160	8987160	♪ ♪
8989160	8992160	You can see a door's health once it's unlocked,
8992160	8994160	as in once you can just open it
8994160	8996160	and its health is totally irrelevant.
8996160	8998160	You can also break open vents,
8998160	9001160	which, let me remind you, are literally never locked,
9001160	9003160	making it pointless to ever do so.
9003160	9005160	I bet most people didn't even notice
9005160	9007160	you could do this because who cares?
9007160	9009160	It never serves any purpose.
9009160	9011160	Something I thought was really funny was apartments
9011160	9013160	in China have these sliding doors,
9013160	9014160	and you can break them open easily.
9014160	9016160	They're flimsy, you know,
9016160	9018160	but when they're open, they become invincible.
9022160	9024160	This doesn't massively affect the gameplay,
9024160	9026160	but it goes a long way in showing how little thought
9026160	9029160	went into what used to be a really good mechanic.
9029160	9031160	Tons of things which were breakable in the original
9031160	9032160	can't be now.
9032160	9034160	Safes are indestructible,
9034160	9036160	so you have to know the code or hack,
9036160	9038160	and the many storage units in the game
9038160	9039160	are immune to damage as well.
9039160	9041160	This reduces the player's available options
9041160	9043160	in addition to making it impossible
9043160	9045160	to even know if anything is destructible
9045160	9047160	because most of the time it isn't.
9047160	9049160	The first time I tried to blow down a locked door,
9049160	9051160	the grenade straight up didn't work for some reason,
9051160	9053160	and since I had no way of knowing
9054160	9057160	I assumed locked doors couldn't be destroyed for ages
9057160	9059160	until I tried again just to double check
9059160	9061160	while I was writing the script for this video.
9061160	9062160	You know what would have been useful?
9062160	9065160	Showing the player the health of locked objects
9065160	9067160	or even saying when something's indestructible.
9067160	9069160	There's a little game you could have taken inspiration from
9069160	9070160	that did this.
9070160	9072160	It's called Deus Ex.
9072160	9074160	They just forgot to make half the stuff in the game
9074160	9075160	respond to damage.
9075160	9077160	Lockers, something players might want
9077160	9079160	to be able to open a bunch of all at once
9079160	9081160	by throwing a grenade into a room
9082160	9084160	and peeking around the horrible door
9084160	9087160	of every single one are also indestructible.
9087160	9089160	One of the most fun things in Deus Ex
9089160	9091160	was running low on picks and seeing how many lockers
9091160	9093160	you could open with your spare GEP rockets
9093160	9096160	in Vandenberg without evaporating the office cat.
9096160	9098160	There's something immensely funny and satisfying
9098160	9100160	about tossing a grenade into a room
9100160	9102160	and turning it into a festival of loot.
9102160	9103160	This isn't a nitpick.
9103160	9105160	This is a fundamental component
9105160	9107160	of Deus Ex's player freedom and immersion
9107160	9109160	that just doesn't work.
9109160	9111160	You know, even when Invisible War
9111160	9113160	was being Invisible War,
9113160	9115160	you could still reliably blow things open
9115160	9116160	with explosives.
9116160	9118160	It wasn't a crapshoot whether the developers
9118160	9120160	had bothered to make something break open
9120160	9121160	like it should.
9121160	9123160	Deus Ex's worst moments were when you had
9123160	9125160	no clever alternatives to the more obvious choices,
9125160	9127160	like when a grate you could pick
9127160	9129160	couldn't be destroyed by other means,
9129160	9131160	but this is just how human revolution works.
9131160	9133160	You need the lift-heavy object's ability
9133160	9135160	to move the vending machine to get into this vent.
9135160	9137160	You could say it's a venting machine,
9137160	9139160	but hey, maybe you can use some creativity
9139160	9142160	and destroy the machine with a grenade.
9142160	9144160	Vending machines are literally indestructible.
9144160	9145160	Didn't you know?
9145160	9147160	The best you can hope for is the physics
9147160	9148160	blowing it clear of the vent,
9148160	9149160	but for that to happen,
9149160	9151160	the physics would have to work.

9182160	9184160	with faces painted on them for one,
9184160	9185160	but just generally,
9185160	9186160	everything is so much more beautiful.
9186160	9188160	I mean, look at these ceilings.
9188160	9190160	At least a year of the game's development
9190160	9191160	probably went into these.
9191160	9193160	Holy cow, bro. I love this.
9194160	9196160	Top ten ceilings in history
9196160	9197160	right behind the Sistine Chapel
9197160	9199160	and another clever-sounding thing,
9199160	9201160	but when it comes to interaction,
9201160	9203160	you know, the game part of this game,
9203160	9205160	almost every prop or object
9205160	9207160	is invincible set dressing.
9207160	9209160	These beakers? Bulletproof.
9209160	9211160	This Chinese food? Immortal.
9211160	9213160	This glass table?
9213160	9215160	Absorbing nearby humans to gain their power.
9215160	9217160	The world feels so static,
9217160	9219160	and it makes you feel even less
9219160	9220160	like you're really interacting with it.
9220160	9222160	Lapicus claims this is a selling point too.
9222160	9224160	Look at this. What?
9224160	9226160	Quit screwing around.
9226160	9228160	Are you telling me your game is better
9228160	9230160	because you can't throw plants at people?
9230160	9232160	This is cyberbullying.
9232160	9233160	I've seen people say this game
9233160	9235160	has amazing emergent gameplay,
9235160	9236160	like, oh, wow,
9236160	9238160	you can break open destructible walls
9238160	9240160	if you don't have the wall-punching ability.
9240160	9241160	Yeah, that's nice,
9241160	9243160	although if you don't have that ability,
9243160	9246160	destructible walls don't noticeably glow,
9246160	9247160	so it's hard to find many of them
9247160	9249160	without already having the ability,
9249160	9251160	at which point you're not going to waste grenades
9251160	9253160	or ammunition on a wall you can just punch down.
9253160	9255160	Actually, the punchable wall augmentation
9255160	9257160	opens up a bunch of extra questions.
9257160	9259160	You can smash down concrete walls
9259160	9261160	if they're slightly cracked,
9261160	9262160	but you can't use this ability
9262160	9264160	to punch open locked doors?
9264160	9266160	You can't just break whatever locking mechanism
9266160	9268160	is keeping this flimsy door shut
9268160	9269160	with your mega fists?
9269160	9271160	Chaos Theory had a lock-picking minigame
9271160	9274160	that got a bit dull the way hacking minigames did here,
9274160	9275160	and that was on top of the hacking minigame
9275160	9276160	they also had,
9276160	9279160	but the designers also gave you the ability
9279160	9282160	to loudly break the lock and open it instantly.
9284160	9287160	People who heard the noise or saw the broken lock
9287160	9288160	would know someone was here,
9288160	9290160	but if you don't want to pick that lock,
9290160	9291160	you don't have to.
9291160	9292160	Picking it became a choice,
9292160	9295160	one which felt more professional and stealthy.
9295160	9296160	Wouldn't it be cool if that augmentation
9296160	9298160	also let you smash the locks off doors
9298160	9299160	and make a ton of noise
9299160	9302160	or risk setting off a security system or something?
9302160	9303160	It would be really cool to have an ability
9303160	9305160	like that at your disposal,
9305160	9307160	and I'm shocked the people who made a game
9307160	9309160	that literally did this didn't think of it.
9309160	9311160	It would automatically give you a lot more
9311160	9312160	to do with this power
9312160	9314160	and save on having to think of more places
9314160	9315160	to put punchable walls,
9315160	9318160	which they were really running low on towards the end.
9318160	9320160	Something else really bugs me about these levels.
9320160	9322160	I spent a long time trying to put my finger on it,
9322160	9324160	but it turns out the answer was floating right in front
9324160	9326160	of my face the entire time,
9326160	9327160	so I'm not sure how I missed it.
9327160	9330160	Oh, did you think I forgot about the quest markers?
9330160	9331160	How could I?
9331160	9332160	How could anyone?
9332160	9333160	Quest markers are annoying
9333160	9334160	when they're off in the corner,
9334160	9335160	but it turns out it could have been worse.
9335160	9337160	They could have been unconstrained.
9337160	9339160	They could have just, no, no, leave me alone.
9339160	9341160	They didn't seem to consider how it would look
9341160	9343160	if you had multiple side quests happening at once
9343160	9345160	or if you were at a stage in a side quest
9345160	9347160	with multiple objectives because who, boy,
9347160	9349160	does that door need me to know?
9349160	9351160	Every side quest and individual component
9351160	9353160	each side quest has is outside it.
9353160	9355160	There's one side quest where you have to neutralize
9355160	9357160	an entire apartment full of gangsters.
9357160	9359160	Now, they're localized to a single small apartment,
9359160	9362160	so you only need one quest marker for that, right?
9362160	9365160	["Live and Let Live"]
9365160	9367160	I have genuinely died in this game
9367160	9369160	because I couldn't see a guy behind a pile
9369160	9371160	of his buddy's quest markers.
9371160	9373160	Yeah, so the game is a little desperate
9373160	9374160	to make sure players don't miss
9374160	9375160	what they're supposed to be doing
9375160	9378160	to the point that it's pretty distracting, ironically.
9378160	9379160	They expect you to toggle off the markers
9379160	9381160	for quests you aren't doing at the exact moment,
9381160	9383160	and yeah, sure, this helps for that
9383160	9385160	if you don't mind doing one thing at a time,
9385160	9387160	but the real issue is making a game
9387160	9389160	which has a method of pointing the player
9389160	9391160	directly towards their required destination
9391160	9394160	inspires really lazy design
9394160	9396160	because now the levels don't have to make sense
9396160	9398160	to players as they navigate
9398160	9400160	because they've got a thing telling them where to go.
9400160	9402160	If you've played the game, you'll know that even though
9402160	9403160	the markers are really distracting,
9403160	9404160	you have to leave them on
9404160	9407160	because there's no other way of finding these quests.
9407160	9409160	Detroit is an unintuitive area to explore.
9409160	9411160	It's a ton of very similar streets
9411160	9413160	connecting to other very similar streets,
9413160	9414160	and when it's not those streets,
9414160	9416160	it's identical apartment buildings,
9416160	9418160	which granted is realistic to most urban cities,
9418160	9420160	but that's not how games ought to work.
9420160	9423160	New York in Deus Ex had character and presence.
9423160	9425160	It was designed to be experienced
9425160	9427160	by a player who didn't have it memorized
9427160	9429160	or know exactly where to go.
9429160	9431160	You enter and you're like, where am I?
9431160	9433160	And you look around and you know where you are
9433160	9435160	because every part of the level looks different
9435160	9437160	and things are really well signposted,
9437160	9439160	literally in some cases.
9439160	9441160	I love the place everyone calls the Taun Hotel
9441160	9443160	is really the Hilton Hotel but the sign's broken.
9443160	9445160	It's memorable and makes the hotel
9445160	9447160	into an obvious landmark you can use to navigate.
9447160	9449160	If you have to find Adam Jensen's apartment
9449160	9451160	off in the corner of the map
9451160	9453160	without quest markers telling you exactly where it is,
9453160	9455160	you're screwed.
9455160	9457160	If you try to stop and get your bearings by looking around,
9457160	9459160	you'll never get anywhere.
9459160	9462160	Detroit is a maze you need a GPS to traverse.
9462160	9464160	Quests are not designed to be doable
9464160	9466160	with the markers turned off.
9466160	9468160	You'd have to manually check every single back alley
9468160	9470160	to find the specific one with the guy
9470160	9472160	you need to talk to for the current quest,
9472160	9474160	especially when the guy has moved
9474160	9476160	since the last time you talked to him for no reason.
9476160	9478160	Conversely, I was feeling clever
9478160	9480160	when I wrote this sentence, this also means
9480160	9482160	the player is never expected or challenged
9482160	9484160	to pay attention.
9484160	9486160	Deus Ex has an optional secret base in the sewers
9486160	9488160	the first time you get to New York
9488160	9490160	that's a clever setup for some of the future plot.
9490160	9492160	Finding it requires looking around yourself
9492160	9494160	or talking to a character you meet
9494160	9496160	in another optional area and hearing him mention
9496160	9498160	the base in the sewers and choosing to check it out.
9498160	9500160	Nothing gets plopped on your screen,
9500160	9502160	no arrow on your mini-map,
9502160	9504160	just good old-fashioned detective work.
9504160	9506160	You feel like a spy on the trail
9506160	9508160	of a conspiracy and on a deeper level,
9508160	9510160	your objective is to find a generator
9510160	9512160	the terrorists have hidden. Finding it is the point.
9512160	9514160	Asking around, exploring,
9514160	9516160	bothering to check out side content and meet
9516160	9518160	other characters who might come in handy later.
9518160	9520160	You can get on the rooftops of buildings
9520160	9522160	and physically see the building the NSF
9522160	9524160	are clearly trying to defend. This is the point
9524160	9526160	of this section. It's why the game
9526160	9528160	feels so free and personal despite
9528160	9530160	being, at its heart, pretty linear.
9530160	9532160	DXHR feels exactly
9532160	9534160	as linear as it is. In every
9534160	9536160	single moment, it is telling you exactly
9536160	9538160	where you're going next and
9538160	9540160	you're following it. When you have to do the
9540160	9542160	equivalent quest, shutting down a signal the
9542160	9544160	bad guys are generating, you know precisely
9544160	9546160	where it is at all times. There is
9546160	9548160	no mystery, no search. Pritchard
9548160	9550160	gives you a quest marker and you walk
9550160	9552160	to it. Hell, you could have just got your pilot
9552160	9554160	to drop you off right there and save you the trouble
9554160	9556160	and when you do turn it off, she actually does turn up
9556160	9558160	to take you to the next area, which is a little
9558160	9560160	insulting. I'm sure there's a plot contrivance
9560160	9562160	but in the original game, the point was that
9562160	9564160	you didn't know exactly where it was
9564160	9566160	so you didn't feel like you had your time wasted
9566160	9568160	when an aircraft came to pick you up after you
9568160	9570160	found it. Quest markers are not
9570160	9572160	an alternative to level design. There
9572160	9574160	are a few brief sections in the game
9574160	9576160	where they're switched off so the game has
9576160	9578160	to be designed to make the player do their own
9578160	9580160	thinking and exploring and the game's fun
9580160	9582160	factor instantly skyrockets.
9582160	9584160	There's a base where your signal is jammed
9584160	9586160	or whatever so you have to manually find
9586160	9588160	the scientist you're looking for and it's
9588160	9590160	easily the best level in the game to
9590160	9592160	navigate. Each of the buildings has a
9592160	9594160	completely different shape and feel,
9594160	9596160	unique designs and visual cues,
9596160	9598160	the outside area is built so it's easy to know
9598160	9600160	where you are relative to everything. It's really
9600160	9602160	cool. Five minutes in, you find the signal
9602160	9604160	jammer and turn it off and the game is bullshit
9604160	9606160	again. Now you know exactly where to go
9606160	9608160	and suddenly you're not really exploring anymore.
9608160	9610160	This is the one section in the game
9610160	9612160	where turning off the quest markers actually works
9612160	9614160	really well so at least it's a good
9614160	9616160	time if you keep the markers turned off.
9616160	9618160	It kind of sucks that almost every game
9618160	9620160	that heavily relies on these markers inevitably
9620160	9622160	has a tiny, really cool segment
9622160	9624160	that turns them off where the level design has to
9624160	9626160	account for them being turned off and everything
9626160	9628160	gets so much better. Instead of being
9628160	9630160	an interesting take on the central mechanics,
9630160	9632160	it ends up being a brief foray into
9632160	9634160	better mechanics you don't get anywhere else
9634160	9636160	and now the player knows exactly
9636160	9638160	what they're missing the rest of the time.
9638160	9640160	There's an oversight in the PC version
9640160	9642160	that's kind of funny but also prevents
9642160	9644160	the markers from at least getting better
9644160	9646160	with age. The game was designed to look
9646160	9648160	good at 720p on the PlayStation 3
9648160	9650160	and Xbox 360. When nixes
9650160	9652160	were creating the PC port, and god bless
9652160	9654160	them, otherwise they did a fantastic job,
9654160	9656160	someone made the UI not scale
9656160	9658160	with resolution. This means at higher resolutions
9658160	9660160	like 1080p, 1440p,
9660160	9662160	and 4K if you're an idiot who owns
9662160	9664160	a 4K screen, the UI gets
9664160	9666160	increasingly harder to see and read
9666160	9668160	but for some godforsaken reason,
9668160	9670160	the objective markers and only
9670160	9672160	the objective markers do scale
9672160	9674160	so even though everything else is so small,
9674160	9676160	people watching this video on their phone
9676160	9678160	won't be able to read the in-game subtitles.
9678160	9680160	Don't blame me. That's just how the game looks
9680160	9682160	at 1440p. The quest markers are
9682160	9684160	still blasting your head off and
9684160	9686160	messing with the visuals of an otherwise
9686160	9688160	still beautiful game.
9688160	9690160	Incidentally, if you get the chip replacement,
9690160	9692160	the glitchy health bar and ammo
9692160	9694160	counter you get during the boss battle are
9694160	9696160	scaled so you can briefly see just
9696160	9698160	how readable the game could have been.
9698160	9700160	You know how older video game cities
9700160	9702160	were always a lot smaller than a real city
9702160	9704160	would be because of hardware limitations or what have you?
9704160	9706160	It turns out that was a blessing in
9706160	9708160	disguise. New York, Hong Kong,
9708160	9710160	and Paris felt big but not so big
9710160	9712160	that getting around was annoying because you know
9712160	9714160	what's not that fun? Trying to get around
9714160	9716160	a big city on foot.
9716160	9718160	["Hey."
9718160	9720160	["Hey."
9720160	9722160	["Hey."
9722160	9724160	["Hey."
9724160	9726160	["Hey."
9726160	9728160	["Hey."
9728160	9729160	["Hey." You laughed or something?"
9729160	9731160	The new, realistically big Detroit
9731160	9733160	and Hengsha levels have tons of places
9733160	9735160	that serve no actual gameplay purpose whatsoever,
9735160	9737160	but the level has to be big
9737160	9739160	because cities are big. The game does
9739160	9741160	create a very nice sense of mood with this though.
9741160	9743160	The designers came up with hundreds of brands
9743160	9745160	and logos to populate their future with.
9745160	9747160	There's some genuine creativity on display
9747160	9749160	here, but these levels aren't used
9749160	9751160	in ways that benefit from this. You aren't
9751160	9753160	milling around the cool environment,
9753160	9755160	making small talk with locals, having unique
9755160	9757160	encounters as you traverse the hustle and bustle
9757160	9759160	of the city. It's window dressing
9759160	9761160	as you follow a quest marker to the places
9761160	9763160	the gameplay happens. J.C. Denton's
9763160	9765160	walk speed wasn't super fast by the first person
9765160	9767160	shooter standards of the time, but the small
9767160	9769160	and dense levels packed with stuff to do
9769160	9771160	and secrets to find made the pace
9771160	9773160	feel brisk. Adam feels
9773160	9775160	significantly slower than J.C.,
9775160	9777160	especially in the much larger cities.
9777160	9779160	You can sprint for two seconds.
9779160	9781160	That's not a joke. Two seconds, and then
9781160	9783160	it has to recharge.
9783160	9785160	Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
9785160	9787160	Oh. Oh.
9787160	9789160	Oh.
9789160	9791160	Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
9791160	9793160	They made running shit on purpose
9793160	9795160	so you had more stuff to put praxis points
9795160	9797160	into. I mean, it's not a surprise he's going
9797160	9799160	so slow if he's carrying so much stuff
9799160	9801160	everywhere in his arms. Pathologic made
9801160	9803160	you walk for hours deliberately as
9803160	9805160	a form of punishment for the player.
9805160	9807160	The game was trying to hurt you and make you
9807160	9809160	question what you were doing with your time.
9809160	9811160	Human Revolution is trying to be a fun
9811160	9813160	cyberpunk action RPG, so I
9813160	9815160	don't think they should be aiming for the same effect.
9815160	9817160	The atmosphere and art design deserve
9817160	9819160	some credit here, though. This is some of the
9819160	9821160	most impressive really boring
9821160	9823160	walking back and forth between objectives
9823160	9825160	I've done in my life, and I'm an expert
9825160	9827160	on those. This is one of the
9827160	9829160	best realized worlds in the history
9829160	9831160	of video games. A decade later,
9831160	9833160	the graphics hold up incredibly well
9833160	9835160	because good visual design just
9835160	9837160	doesn't age, but you're traversing
9837160	9839160	it to do the same hacking minigame
9839160	9841160	every five feet to unlock safes
9841160	9843160	with a negligible amount of money in them
9843160	9845160	which you can't even spend because the store
9845160	9847160	only had ten of the bullets you want.
9847160	9849160	This is why this game is so difficult
9849160	9851160	to analyze without going way overboard
9851160	9853160	and making an unwatchably long video.
9853160	9855160	All the pieces of an excellent game
9855160	9857160	are right here. They even made the
9857160	9859160	skylight you could have got in through in a better
9859160	9861160	version of the game, but they don't
9861160	9863160	stick the landing. Instead, the game is
9863160	9865160	merely fine. The stealth is fun,
9865160	9867160	the combat is good, and the levels are okay
9867160	9869160	but don't encourage creativity,
9869160	9871160	and it's easy to get bored because the game
9871160	9873160	never asks that much of you.
9873160	9875160	I joked before about people quitting because of the
9875160	9877160	hacking minigame, but more seriously,
9877160	9879160	it's probably because halfway through,
9879160	9881160	there aren't even many new levels to keep
9881160	9883160	things fresh. You instead go to Detroit
9883160	9885160	and Hengsha all over again with
9885160	9887160	even less to see this time. The first
9887160	9889160	visits to these locations have an okay amount
9889160	9891160	of side quests, about as many as the
9891160	9893160	original did for its city-type locations.
9893160	9895160	The second visit to Detroit has
9895160	9897160	a side quest with a second one if
9897160	9899160	you completed another side quest during the
9899160	9901160	first visit, and I mean fully completed.
9901160	9903160	If you forgot to read the three emails
9903160	9905160	you got sent at the end of the first half of
9905160	9907160	the quest before you left for China hours ago,
9907160	9909160	you can never start the second half
9909160	9911160	once you get back. The second visit to
9911160	9913160	China is so devoid of new material
9913160	9915160	the game lies and says there are more
9915160	9917160	side missions than there actually are.
9917160	9919160	There's two, one from this guy and one from
9919160	9921160	this lady, but the game pretends
9921160	9923160	there's a third quest. The other
9923160	9925160	quest, a matter of discretion,
9925160	9927160	is given to you by another character.
9927160	9929160	It's to talk to this lady who then
9929160	9931160	gives you the second quest.
9931160	9933160	Are you the man Mr. Darrow sent?
9933160	9935160	A guy calls you on the telephone and
9935160	9937160	gives you the quest to get the other quest
9937160	9939160	so it feels like you're doing more quests.
9939160	9941160	There are some really ambitious ideas for a cyberpunk
9941160	9943160	world in here saddled with an engine
9943160	9945160	and hardware generation that didn't match
9945160	9947160	that ambition. The simplified levels
9947160	9949160	remind me a lot of the PS2 version
9949160	9951160	of the original game, which was good
9951160	9953160	but a bit more stripped down and missing
9953160	9955160	the expansiveness and complexity that made
9955160	9957160	the PC version quite so special.
9957160	9959160	I'd compare the level design to Invisible Wars,
9959160	9961160	but even I'm not that mean.
9961160	9963160	Actually, no. Invisible War put enemies
9963160	9965160	in the vents to punish you for thinking they were
9965160	9967160	an easy solution, so its level design
9967160	9969160	is objectively better. Next chapter.
9969160	9971160	Goodbye.
9971160	9973160	Ugh!
9975160	9977160	I talked to the chairman.
9977160	9979160	We discussed regime change for New Cairo.
9979160	9981160	♪
9983160	9985160	The story of the original Deus Ex
9985160	9987160	was a complete mess.
9987160	9989160	In a good way, though. It's part of what makes it
9989160	9991160	amazing, but it's also why making another
9991160	9993160	one is like trying to solve the trolley problem
9993160	9995160	while trapped inside the trolley.
9995160	9997160	It was set in 2052 in a world
9997160	9999160	that's very different from ours, or was
9999160	10001160	different in the year 2000. Many of the game's
10001160	10003160	scariest predictions turned out to be true.
10003160	10005160	My favorite games keep doing that.
10005160	10007160	Let it spill over to the schools
10007160	10009160	and churches. Let the bodies pile up
10009160	10011160	in the streets. There's a dozen
10011160	10013160	factions with their own agendas all fighting
10013160	10015160	for supremacy, uneasy alliances,
10015160	10017160	ancient organizations, revolutionary
10017160	10019160	groups, secret bases underneath
10019160	10021160	other secret bases, corporate conspiracies,
10021160	10023160	and even greasels!
10023160	10025160	Oh, God!
10025160	10027160	Oh, God!
10029160	10031160	Despite discussing important
10031160	10033160	ideas like the value of democracy
10033160	10035160	and the human need to feel witnessed by a god
10035160	10037160	and how the rich have manipulated
10037160	10039160	the system so workers pay more in taxes
10039160	10041160	than their boss, the writing still manages
10041160	10043160	to be fun.
10043160	10045160	A bomb's a bad choice
10045160	10047160	for close-range combat.
10047160	10049160	Deus Ex knows that a world where every conspiracy
10049160	10051160	turned out to be true would be a little bit
10051160	10053160	silly.
10053160	10055160	No, I wanted orange.
10055160	10057160	It gave me lemon lime. It's the maintenance man.
10057160	10059160	He knows I like orange.
10059160	10061160	So you think the staff has some kind of plot?
10061160	10063160	Yes, they do that on purpose.
10063160	10065160	So instead of pretending to be the darkest
10065160	10067160	and most serious-est story ever,
10067160	10069160	it's more like an X-Files box set
10069160	10071160	raising some important ideas
10071160	10073160	and themes but with a sense of humor about it.
10073160	10075160	You take another step forward and here
10075160	10077160	I am again, like your own
10077160	10079160	reflection repeated in a hall of mirrors.
10079160	10081160	That makes me one ugly son of a bitch.
10081160	10083160	The game has multiple endings,
10083160	10085160	all three of which have different implications
10085160	10087160	for the future of the world.
10087160	10089160	You can let things continue as normal but with a slightly
10089160	10091160	more benevolent dictatorship in place run by you
10091160	10093160	and that guy who loves betraying people.
10093160	10095160	But I'm sure it'll all work out fine.
10095160	10097160	Wait, that's not a good-sounding Paradise Lost quote.
10097160	10099160	Oh, shit. Are we the baddies?
10099160	10101160	Or you can shut off all advanced
10101160	10103160	information technology and plunge the world
10103160	10105160	into a new dark age where YouTubers
10105160	10107160	have to provide something of value to society
10107160	10109160	or you can fuse with an advanced AI
10109160	10111160	and become a kind of all-knowing god
10111160	10113160	from the machine. Hey, look, it's the title.
10113160	10115160	But now the question is, how the hell
10115160	10117160	do you make another one of these?
10117160	10119160	Do you decide on one ending being canon
10119160	10121160	and hope for the best? Do you ask for a player's
10121160	10123160	save file and try to react to their choices
10123160	10125160	and retcon all the big ones
10125160	10127160	because you can't be bothered? Or do you embody
10127160	10129160	the spirit of Deus Ex's madness
10129160	10131160	and push it even further
10131160	10133160	and put jet boosters on the trolley?
10133160	10135160	Ah! No!
10135160	10137160	Enter Deus Ex Invisible War,
10137160	10139160	the game equivalent of trying to replace sleep
10139160	10141160	with your ADHD medication.
10141160	10143160	Which ending is canon? All of them.
10143160	10145160	At once! J.C. Denton
10145160	10147160	fused with an advanced AI and became
10147160	10149160	a godlike, hyper-intelligent super being
10149160	10151160	but also all the technology
10151160	10153160	in the world shut off, which kind of messed
10153160	10155160	with his plans, but also the fucking
10155160	10157160	Illuminati are still running around,
10157160	10159160	but also there's even more Greasels now!
10159160	10161160	Ah! Set 20 years
10161160	10163160	after the most confusing day in the world,
10163160	10165160	Invisible War tries to follow up
10165160	10167160	on the original with intriguing new perspectives
10167160	10169160	and ironic twists and
10169160	10171160	tries to tell a new story of its own
10171160	10173160	with new characters while it's at it.
10173160	10175160	Then those two things smash into each other
10175160	10177160	and create the most fascinating mess
10177160	10179160	of a story ever conceived.
10179160	10181160	It's less X-Files boxed set and more
10181160	10183160	trying to figure out the plot of X-Files
10183160	10185160	from Fox Mulder best moments compilation
10185160	10187160	number 11.
10187160	10189160	Woo! How is this in part 11?
10189160	10191160	This is at least a number four. I love this game.
10191160	10193160	Is it good? I don't know, but it's
10193160	10195160	definitely the most. This game has
10195160	10197160	four radically different endings
10197160	10199160	that each permanently alter the world
10199160	10201160	even more than the originals did,
10201160	10203160	ranging from wiping out almost all life
10203160	10205160	to uniting human consciousness
10205160	10207160	in a new way of being.
10207160	10209160	So one question, how do you make a sequel
10209160	10211160	to this? If someone asks you
10211160	10213160	to make Deus Ex 3,
10213160	10215160	as it was tentatively titled in its early teasers,
10215160	10217160	they're trying to trick you into
10217160	10219160	destroying your career. So
10219160	10221160	what do you do? You make a prequel.
10221160	10223160	Oh, no!
10223160	10225160	Prequels can be great, but they often
10225160	10227160	have to carry a lot of excess baggage.
10227160	10229160	This is all the stuff we didn't need
10229160	10231160	to see to enjoy the original, so
10231160	10233160	seeing it is by definition kind of
10233160	10235160	unnecessary. You know his name.
10235160	10237160	You know his methods.
10237160	10239160	And this February, you learn
10239160	10241160	that at some point he started
10241160	10243160	doing those things.
10243160	10245160	Holy shit, this movie's fucking
10245160	10247160	terrible, and in interactive media
10247160	10249160	this can be even worse because now
10249160	10251160	your interaction is being limited
10251160	10253160	by what's supposed to happen next.
10253160	10255160	You killed the future.
10255160	10257160	You created a time paradox.
10257160	10259160	Okay, in context, that's kind of
10259160	10261160	meant as a joke. Uh, let's do a real
10261160	10263160	example. Stalker, Shadow of Chernobyl,
10263160	10265160	began with the marked one on the battle bus with
10265160	10267160	the quest to down Strelok at the Tilted Towers.
10267160	10269160	Whether he succeeded in his quest or
10269160	10271160	if he merely got showered with money to
10271160	10273160	death was based on your actions.
10273160	10275160	Then Stalker got a prequel.
10275160	10277160	Clear Sky has many problems, one of them
10277160	10279160	being it's the successor to a game with a lot
10279160	10281160	of endings and some big twists which
10281160	10283160	itself has no real twists and can
10283160	10285160	only end one way, and then Shadow
10285160	10287160	of Chernobyl happens.
10287160	10289160	You spend 10 to 30 hours helping
10289160	10291160	the marked one catch his bus.
10291160	10293160	People who play didn't know what I'm talking about.
10293160	10295160	Honestly, I could talk for hours about how you...
10295160	10297160	No, Rachel, I won't let you stop me this time.
10297160	10300160	The people need to know. Is that a taser?
10300160	10303160	♪♪
10303160	10305160	So yeah, prequels are something you generally
10305160	10307160	want to avoid unless you've got a really
10307160	10309160	good idea for it.
10309160	10311160	But as we've established,
10311160	10313160	Eidos Montreal didn't really have much
10313160	10315160	of a choice. They're kind of between a rock
10315160	10317160	and a hard place here. I mean, I guess they could
10317160	10319160	do a reboot, but rebooting the franchise
10319160	10321160	kind of isn't ideal either. You really
10321160	10323160	should never do one of those, Eidos Montreal.
10323160	10325160	Oh, no! Given that all of the options
10325160	10327160	were kind of bad, it does beg the question
10327160	10329160	why make a Deus Ex game at all
10329160	10331160	apart from brand recognition?
10331160	10333160	Well, it might shock you, but the answer is
10333160	10335160	brand recognition. Did you ever wonder why
10335160	10337160	the next Prey was called Prey
10337160	10339160	and not, I don't know, New Space Game
10339160	10341160	even though it's nothing like Prey?
10341160	10343160	God, these names are confusing.
10343160	10345160	It's because the money men at Bethesda
10345160	10347160	or Eidos Square Enix aren't going to spend
10347160	10349160	millions of dollars and years of dev time
10349160	10351160	on an ambitious risk-taking original
10351160	10353160	idea unless it's got a vaguely
10353160	10355160	bankable name. We already had in mind
10355160	10357160	the kind of game we were making, and then
10357160	10359160	Bethesda said, hey, what about using this name?
10359160	10361160	Hey! Why don't you call it Prey, guys?
10361160	10363160	We killed the company that was making
10363160	10365160	the original Prey 2 even though
10365160	10367160	it was basically finished because they wouldn't
10367160	10369160	let us buy them. That's a true story.
10369160	10371160	Look it up.
10371160	10373160	So now we have this name lying around.
10373160	10375160	Prey 2017's great, don't get me wrong,
10375160	10377160	and the devs had a lot of creative
10377160	10379160	freedom with it except for the name.
10379160	10381160	That game had to be Prey somehow.
10381160	10383160	This is why, at least in the AAA
10383160	10385160	gaming space, original big-budget
10385160	10387160	games are surprisingly rare, but you can
10387160	10389160	expect endless sequels, prequels,
10389160	10391160	reboots, and
10391160	10393160	remasters of popular existing
10393160	10395160	properties until you're cold in your grave.
10395160	10397160	What have you done?
10397160	10399160	Why does he look? Because when you're talking
10399160	10401160	years of work and tens of millions
10401160	10403160	of state-subsidized Canadian fun bucks,
10403160	10405160	you need to provide at least some proof
10405160	10407160	of a return on investment, and the
10407160	10409160	best way to do that is to be called
10409160	10411160	famous thing colon more shit.
10411160	10413160	Maybe none of this is true and the
10413160	10415160	creators really wanted to specifically
10415160	10417160	make the next Deus Ex game, but if that's
10417160	10419160	the case, I think it was a poor choice.
10419160	10421160	You see, now you have to design your game around
10421160	10423160	dodging the complaints of losers who care
10423160	10425160	about the Deus Ex timeline. Losers like
10425160	10427160	me prepare to be destroyed.
10427160	10429160	What I'm getting at is the story is trying
10429160	10431160	to be unique and original, but also
10431160	10433160	very self-conscious about looking like
10433160	10435160	it definitely will lead into Deus Ex
10435160	10437160	maybe someday.
10437160	10439160	This approach damages both the game's
10439160	10441160	ability to relate to the other games and
10441160	10443160	its ability to tell the original story
10443160	10445160	it clearly desperately wants to.
10445160	10447160	Before you can even explore the story
10447160	10449160	that is here, you have to excavate it from
10449160	10451160	under a pile of distracting references
10451160	10453160	to the original. For example,
10453160	10455160	J.C. Denton's boss, Joseph Manderly,
10455160	10457160	is referenced like a dozen times throughout
10457160	10459160	the plot like he's a major player
10459160	10461160	directly involved with the important stuff
10461160	10462160	you're dealing with.
10462160	10464160	We've been compromised.
10464160	10466160	Manderly was supposed to have that morgue locked down,
10466160	10468160	but somebody got to the corpse before we did.
10468160	10470160	Like, this guy's so important,
10470160	10472160	he's getting name-dropped in the pre-rendered
10472160	10474160	cutscenes by bosses. What would
10474160	10476160	an ordinary player think this is setting up?
10476160	10478160	You the home sec guy I was ordered to wait for?
10478160	10480160	Tell Manderly I didn't get the memo
10480160	10482160	until I was halfway through the autopsy.
10482160	10484160	Maybe the story that you're playing?
10484160	10485160	Right?
10485160	10486160	Someone in the government,
10486160	10487160	a man named Manderly,
10487160	10489160	ordered that a specially appointed
10489160	10491160	medical examiner perform the autopsy.
10491160	10493160	So you think, I get it. This guy's a big deal.
10493160	10496160	Maybe we meet or even fight him later?
10496160	10498160	No. They eventually just stop mentioning him.
10498160	10500160	If you were trying to figure out what was up
10500160	10502160	with Manderly or find him,
10502160	10503160	you were wasting your time.
10503160	10504160	This isn't part of the story.
10504160	10506160	This was the game's attempt to tie itself
10506160	10507160	into the series more,
10507160	10509160	but they've gone about it in a way
10509160	10511160	that makes the actual story you're trying to follow
10511160	10513160	really annoying because it's full of stuff
10513160	10515160	you think you're supposed to pay attention to
10515160	10516160	that turns out to be fan service
10516160	10517160	and doesn't go anywhere.
10517160	10519160	I'm sure they were trying to be subtle about it
10519160	10521160	so their own story had room to breathe.
10521160	10523160	In fact, here's Mary DeMalle saying that.
10523160	10525160	Well, the good thing about doing the prequel
10525160	10527160	is that if you haven't played the game before,
10527160	10529160	you don't have to worry about it.
10529160	10531160	You don't have to suddenly become,
10531160	10533160	like, oh, what's going on?
10533160	10535160	I think she had the right idea here.
10535160	10537160	This was a story that first and foremost
10537160	10538160	needed to work on its own merits,
10538160	10540160	but there is frankly too much
10540160	10542160	Deus Ex One stuff in here for that to happen.
10542160	10544160	The first thing you see in the game
10544160	10546160	in the opening is this guy, Bob Page,
10546160	10548160	the antagonist of Deus Ex One
10548160	10549160	and also the first guy you see
10549160	10551160	in the opening of that game too.
10551160	10553160	You need to know Bob Page is behind this
10553160	10555160	for some reason even though he never appears
10555160	10556160	in the actual game.
10556160	10558160	He turns up after the credits.
10558160	10560160	I'm looking forward to seeing the hybrid project
10560160	10561160	up close, Mr. Page.
10561160	10564160	But please...
10564160	10566160	call me Bob.
10566160	10568160	This shot in the post-credits scene
10568160	10570160	is reused from the opening too.
10570160	10572160	I don't know whether to be annoyed how lazy this was
10572160	10574160	or glad they didn't waste too much effort
10574160	10576160	on something so unnecessary.
10576160	10577160	People who are playing this first,
10577160	10579160	and for a lot of people this was their introduction
10579160	10581160	to the series, will spend the entire game
10581160	10584160	wondering who the hell that guy the intro focused on was,
10584160	10586160	and they will never get an answer.
10586160	10588160	I love when my first experience of a series
10588160	10590160	is a bunch of shit I can't possibly understand.
10590160	10592160	There's a bit during the walk and talk
10592160	10594160	a few minutes later where a guy drops a reference
10594160	10596160	to Page Industries, and this one's kind of cute.
10596160	10598160	Players who knew what Page Industries was
10598160	10600160	would get it, and players who didn't
10600160	10602160	could write it off as world building and office banter.
10602160	10604160	This subtlety would have worked really well,
10604160	10607160	but you've already blown past subtle references
10607160	10609160	to Bob Page when you began the game
10609160	10612160	with a minute and a half intro starring Bob Page
10612160	10614160	even though he's not even in the game.
10614160	10616160	I'm a little paged out, buddy.
10616160	10618160	The opening, ending, and quite a lot in between
10618160	10621160	is an extended reminder of a different story
10621160	10623160	you could be playing instead.
10623160	10625160	People who know who Lucius De Beers is
10625160	10627160	aren't gonna clap their hands like a circus seal
10627160	10629160	when they see his name turn up, and people who don't
10629160	10631160	are gonna wonder why they keep reading emails
10631160	10634160	about people they don't know who don't turn up in the story.
10634160	10636160	All these problems come to a head in,
10636160	10639160	where else, the pre-order DLC.
10639160	10641160	If you got the explosive mission pack,
10641160	10643160	at one point you literally take a break
10643160	10645160	from the story you're playing
10645160	10647160	to help rescue a main character you've never met before
10647160	10649160	to help them get onto a boat
10649160	10652160	to the place they need to be 20 years later.
10652160	10654160	The most relevant interaction Adam Jensen has
10654160	10656160	with the plot of Deus Ex 1
10656160	10658160	is to help a guy catch his bus.
10658160	10660160	During the escape sequence with the bomb,
10660160	10662160	you see him get on his boat, the Tracer.
10662160	10664160	Wow, how long did that take you?
10664160	10666160	But rescuing Tong was pre-order content
10666160	10668160	a majority of players didn't get to do,
10668160	10670160	and since this cut scene is pre-rendered
10670160	10672160	and happens the same way no matter what,
10672160	10674160	there isn't an alternative version
10674160	10676160	for if you didn't get the rescue Tong mission.
10676160	10679160	So most players' experience of this element of the story
10679160	10681160	is some guy they've never seen before
10681160	10683160	turns up for five seconds, waves at Adam
10683160	10685160	like you're supposed to know who he is,
10685160	10687160	and people who haven't played the original
10687160	10689160	are left asking, wait, who are you?
10689160	10691160	Guess you should have pre-ordered from GameStop.
10691160	10693160	Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
10693160	10695160	I feel bad making this criticism because
10695160	10697160	for the reasons we've explored, it's not like they had
10697160	10699160	much of a choice in making their project
10699160	10701160	have to also work as a prequel,
10701160	10703160	and how they handled it is just kicking someone
10703160	10705160	while they're down, which in Quebec I think
10705160	10707160	they would call a, uh, folks pass,
10707160	10709160	but Deus Ex is one of the best stories
10709160	10711160	in the history of gaming, and Human Revolution
10711160	10713160	isn't doing its own story any favors
10713160	10715160	by reminding fans of the much better story
10715160	10717160	they actually liked.
10717160	10719160	So when the story isn't trying to shoehorn in
10719160	10721160	confusing and unnecessary references to the first game,
10721160	10724160	what is the story of this one actually about?
10724160	10726160	♪♪
10726160	10728160	Sorry, there's a typo there.
10729160	10731160	Now, since it's a video game,
10731160	10734160	we're grading on a really weirdly shaped curve here.
10734160	10736160	They won an award for the writing
10736160	10738160	at the Canadian Video Game Awards that year,
10738160	10741160	beating out other games like Assassin's Creed Revelations
10741160	10743160	and Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine.
10743160	10745160	Wow, what stiff competition.
10745160	10747160	This game's story is not great,
10747160	10751160	but also much, much better than most other video games
10751160	10753160	by such a wide margin it feels wrong
10753160	10755160	criticizing it too hard.
10755160	10757160	The performances are fantastic. Well, mostly.
10757160	10759160	Someone's not coming back for the sequel,
10759160	10761160	and there's some solid comedy in there too.
10761160	10763160	There's a fantastic part where you're supposed
10763160	10764160	to tell a code phrase to a guy,
10764160	10766160	and you can just get it wrong on purpose.
10788160	10790160	You don't even fail the mission for doing this.
10790160	10792160	It's just cool, and there's some neat setup
10792160	10794160	and payoff like, oh, see this guy showing his arm off
10794160	10796160	to the camera to make sure you see it?
10796160	10798160	That arm is gonna turn out to be important
10798160	10799160	three quarters of the game from now.
10799160	10801160	There's nothing wrong with the writing
10801160	10802160	in, say, the cut scenes,
10802160	10804160	even if they take away some player control.
10804160	10806160	The issue is that all of this writing
10806160	10809160	is happening around a badly written central plot.
10809160	10811160	Deus Ex Human Revolution is centrally
10811160	10812160	about the issue of augmentation
10812160	10814160	and whether it's good or not.
10814160	10817160	Deus Ex Human Revolution centers around
10817160	10819160	the use of mechanical augmentations
10819160	10822160	and how this technology has spread through the world
10822160	10824160	and how it is affecting the world.
10824160	10825160	It's not that the world is full of stuff,
10825160	10827160	but the main focus is augmentation.
10827160	10829160	It's that the world is full of people
10829160	10831160	discussing augmentation and nothing else
10831160	10833160	unless they're referencing Deus Ex 1.
10833160	10835160	Almost everyone in the universe of Human Revolution
10835160	10838160	has an opinion about whether having robot arms is good
10838160	10841160	or the death knell of the human soul.
10841160	10844160	What's all the fuss about this augmentation technology?
10844160	10846160	What are you looking at, pal?
10846160	10849160	Scanning me with those metal eyes of yours?
10849160	10852160	No offense, but, uh, if it were up to me,
10852160	10855160	this place would have a no-arg policy.
10855160	10858160	Hope you enjoy those fancy hands of yours
10858160	10861160	because in less than a year, they'll be worthless.
10861160	10863160	The rote mechanical insistence
10863160	10865160	on covering one and only one topic
10865160	10867160	makes the world strangely uncanny.
10867160	10869160	Have you seen the neural enhancements
10869160	10871160	they're coming up with these days?
10871160	10873160	How far are they gonna go?
10873160	10875160	In his apartment building,
10875160	10877160	Adam Jensen overhears a fight in another room.
10877160	10879160	A man has caught his wife cheating.
10879160	10881160	It's tense and upsetting, and for a brief moment,
10881160	10883160	it feels like you're in a world
10883160	10885160	with a bunch of different stories happening in it.
10885160	10888160	Then it turns out she cheated because they're both augmented.
10888160	10890160	I guess I wanted to be reminded of what it was like
10890160	10893160	to be with someone normal.
10893160	10896160	You were the one who wanted us to get enhanced.
10896160	10898160	Now you're saying we're not normal anymore.
10899160	10901160	Well, now try not to touch me too often
10901160	10905160	with my cold, dead, metal hand, okay?
10905160	10907160	I'm sad about my metal hand.
10907160	10909160	Ah! That's the story in a nutshell.
10909160	10911160	Granted, it's not quite as iconic
10911160	10913160	as I never asked for this.
10913160	10915160	Purity First's motivations are that they don't like
10915160	10918160	augmentations because they pollute the human body.
10918160	10920160	They hate them for this vague reason
10920160	10922160	so much they're willing to break into buildings,
10922160	10925160	take hostages, kill them with gas, and so on.
10925160	10927160	They dress evocative of Christian monks
10927160	10929160	with the prayer rope and everything
10929160	10932160	and wear a band over their arms with their group's logo on it.
10932160	10934160	Wow, I wonder what this is meant to remind people of.
10934160	10937160	Jesus Christ, you killed him, huh?
10937160	10938160	He asked for it.
10938160	10940160	Kept calling me a bigot.
10940160	10942160	He called me a bigot, so I murdered him.
10942160	10944160	You see, when you zoom in really closely
10944160	10946160	on one aspect of your setting,
10946160	10948160	you obscure the big picture in ways
10948160	10950160	that make it less interesting than if it was part of the whole.
10950160	10952160	Take Detroit, the city the American portions
10952160	10954160	of the game are set in.
10954160	10956160	Detroit, historically, is a city that was once prosperous,
10956160	10958160	then went through a major decline
10958160	10960160	as a result of the auto industry shipping
10960160	10962160	most of the work to places that didn't have strong unions
10962160	10964160	so they could pay them less.
10964160	10966160	People in poorer countries and eventually robots
10966160	10968160	in poorer countries make the cars
10968160	10970160	they used to make in Detroit.
10970160	10972160	There was also redlining, which effectively denied
10972160	10974160	Black Detroiters the opportunities afforded
10974160	10976160	by stable home ownership or being able
10976160	10978160	to open new businesses of their own,
10978160	10980160	which helped to ensure the economy had even less chance
10980160	10982160	of recovering, and the thing is,
10982160	10984160	the economic effects of historic racism
10984160	10986160	don't go away overnight.
10986160	10988160	When we invent cures for cancer or improved
10988160	10990160	human body parts that don't get sick
10990160	10992160	or let us run faster or jump higher
10992160	10994160	or think harder, people from economically
10994160	10997160	disadvantaged groups will have the least access.
10997160	10999160	The rich will be building themselves better,
10999160	11001160	and the poor will not.
11001160	11003160	Meanwhile, if augmentation becomes necessary
11003160	11005160	for certain jobs, like, say,
11005160	11007160	truck drivers can get their brains augmented
11007160	11009160	so they can drive all night without traditional
11009160	11011160	need for sleep, that might become
11011160	11013160	the expected norm for the job.
11013160	11015160	While people might only hire drivers who don't need
11015160	11017160	breaks to sleep, wage slavery would take on
11017160	11019160	even more physical connotations.
11019160	11021160	You could make a game about that idea,
11021160	11023160	and this stuff is discussed
11023160	11025160	at least briefly during the game.
11025160	11027160	Several homeless NPCs talk about how they lost
11027160	11029160	their jobs for refusing to be augmented,
11029160	11031160	and several other NPCs have serious job anxiety
11031160	11033160	or remark on how rich Adam must be
11033160	11035160	to be so augmented.
11035160	11037160	Listen, just because you have money
11037160	11039160	doesn't make you better than me.
11039160	11041160	The Hengsha level has a whole side quest
11041160	11043160	covering sex workers being forcibly augmented,
11043160	11045160	not just to serve clients,
11045160	11047160	but because it means they won't be able to quit
11047160	11049160	without losing access to the anti-rejection drugs
11049160	11051160	you have to take for life once you get an augmentation.
11051160	11053160	Human Revolution strays
11053160	11055160	dangerously close to making actual
11055160	11057160	real social commentary here.
11057160	11059160	In the last level, lots of the construction workers
11059160	11061160	have tools where their arms would be.
11061160	11063160	I'm gonna go ahead and call this body horror.
11063160	11065160	This is what the future might do
11065160	11067160	to working people, but did you see
11067160	11069160	how deep I had to dig to pull out that point just now?
11069160	11071160	This game is supposed to be about
11071160	11073160	human augmentation and its effect
11073160	11075160	on the world, but I had to talk about specific
11075160	11077160	random NPCs and the one
11077160	11079160	side quest that really went into it
11079160	11081160	and stare at random enemies in the last level
11081160	11083160	to find some kind of relevant observation.
11083160	11085160	If anything about this game's story
11085160	11087160	is lacking is how it's swimming in an ocean
11087160	11089160	of meaningful questions and points,
11089160	11091160	but the actual plot blows past it all
11091160	11093160	to be about terrorists who hate orgs
11093160	11095160	and org lovers and the bad men
11095160	11097160	who kidnapped your girlfriend.
11097160	11099160	Let's take another look at some of Purity First's
11099160	11101160	literature they leave strewn around the office
11101160	11103160	they broke into. This stuff about physical
11103160	11105160	limitations being human and not changing
11105160	11107160	the body is just bullshit.
11107160	11109160	These fuckers are against pacemakers.
11109160	11111160	They don't have a valuable point to make here,
11111160	11113160	and that's okay. Purity First are
11113160	11115160	deliberately written and presented in the game
11115160	11117160	as misguided radicals, which isn't
11117160	11119160	necessarily a bad choice, but it does mean
11119160	11121160	this group doesn't have anything interesting
11121160	11123160	to say. The NSF are a great
11123160	11125160	faction in the first game because their perspective
11125160	11127160	is genuinely interesting, at least partially
11127160	11129160	valid, and everything their leaders say
11129160	11131160	is just fucking true. There's a reason
11131160	11133160	every line this guy speaks is iconic.
11133160	11135160	You switch sides and work with
11135160	11137160	these guys partway through and it works
11137160	11139160	here because they were never presented as the
11139160	11141160	dumbest boys in the world, but yeah,
11141160	11143160	sure, hearing aids are immoral.
11143160	11145160	Nice one, buddy. Say hi to Ted
11145160	11147160	in prison for me, but here's the real shitter,
11147160	11149160	right? In between these two statements
11149160	11151160	is a really interesting one. This one
11151160	11153160	actually reaches for an important point.
11153160	11155160	It comes close to saying what a lot
11155160	11157160	of people say right now about modern technology
11157160	11159160	like electric cars or self-driving
11159160	11161160	cars or space rockets, namely
11161160	11163160	that even if they work, they're not the thing
11163160	11165160	humanity needs right now, and
11165160	11167160	wasting resources on them at a time like this
11167160	11169160	while so many real problems go unsolved
11169160	11171160	is a tragedy history won't look back
11171160	11173160	on kindly. If there even are any historians
11173160	11175160	left in 50 years, Purity
11175160	11177160	First could easily have been written as a
11177160	11179160	principled faction and represented a
11179160	11181160	tangible perspective, but instead
11181160	11183160	any of their justifiable motivations
11183160	11185160	are relegated to the back page of a
11185160	11187160	PDF and they're shooting people for calling
11187160	11189160	them racist. You could have, for example,
11189160	11191160	made them a group with a cohesive
11191160	11193160	ideology, like what if they were anti-augmentation
11193160	11195160	specifically because they saw
11195160	11197160	the impact it would have on working people
11197160	11199160	who couldn't afford them or who would be expected
11199160	11201160	to get them to keep their jobs?
11201160	11203160	What if they weren't even anti-augmentation
11203160	11205160	per se and this break-in was a cover
11205160	11207160	to steal for people who need access to
11207160	11209160	augmentations but can't afford them?
11209160	11211160	Alexander's is established as a veteran.
11211160	11213160	He belongs to a group that maybe could do with
11213160	11215160	access to replacement limbs. There were so
11215160	11217160	many compelling ways of writing this group
11217160	11219160	but instead they went with the Nazi
11219160	11221160	sash-wearing purity terrorist gang.
11221160	11223160	You think we're breaking the law.
11223160	11225160	Shut up!
11225160	11227160	All you body polluters break laws.
11227160	11229160	You're all the same. I don't like augmentations
11229160	11231160	because I'm the bad guy.
11231160	11233160	Ah! Even though there's plenty room to
11233160	11235160	discuss augmentation in a nuanced way,
11235160	11237160	it's instead often used as a stand-in
11237160	11239160	for other real-world issues.
11239160	11241160	There's newspaper articles about how an augmented
11241160	11243160	black woman has had to deal with bigotry,
11243160	11245160	not just for her race, but now also
11245160	11247160	for being augmented. First racism
11247160	11249160	and now robot arms.
11249160	11251160	People are coming up with special new slurs
11251160	11253160	for augmented people. Mechs, clanks,
11253160	11255160	cogs, chrome boy.
11255160	11257160	Chrome boy? Chrome boy.
11257160	11259160	Chrome boy. Hanses? They put more
11259160	11261160	creativity into clever new terms
11261160	11263160	for cyber racism than they did
11263160	11265160	into actually talking about the issues
11265160	11267160	that come into play if human augmentation
11267160	11269160	becomes available. It feels a bit like
11269160	11271160	they're adding augmentation on top of these
11271160	11273160	other things, like racism, abortion,
11273160	11275160	drug abuse, or prostitution
11275160	11277160	in order to bring additional depth to their central
11277160	11279160	theme. It's a little gross at times.
11279160	11281160	You don't need an abortion poster
11281160	11283160	to make transhumanism look like a topical
11283160	11285160	idea. I just think this is unnecessary
11285160	11287160	and crass. The Hengsha side quest
11287160	11289160	deserves special attention here. The idea
11289160	11291160	of forcing sex workers to need an anti-rejection
11291160	11293160	drug is a little too close
11293160	11295160	to one-to-one substitution for a real
11295160	11297160	problem. Sex workers being addicted,
11297160	11299160	often forcefully, to drugs as
11299160	11301160	a means of control. Like, making it so
11301160	11303160	the drug they need is because of an augmentation
11303160	11305160	is just crowbarring your silly sci-fi
11305160	11307160	concept into an already existing
11307160	11309160	real problem. The game isn't using
11309160	11311160	this sequence as a way of saying anything about
11311160	11313160	the sex industry beyond that it's bad
11313160	11315160	that trafficking happens, which, okay,
11315160	11317160	glad we're on the same page, and it's not saying anything
11317160	11319160	about augmentation except that I guess
11319160	11321160	it might add to an already existing
11321160	11323160	form of exploitation. It's here
11323160	11325160	so you can punch three guys and save a lady
11325160	11327160	and she can go, wow, you saved me
11327160	11329160	and then she evaporates.
11329160	11331160	We fade to black and she ceases to exist.
11331160	11333160	Did we just solve sex
11333160	11335160	trafficking? And we have to talk a little about
11335160	11337160	how prostitution is used in the game.
11337160	11339160	Sex workers are a large presence in both
11339160	11341160	main hubs and it feels like this was done to
11341160	11343160	make a point about how bad things are getting.
11343160	11345160	Like, the writers wanted to write a dystopian
11345160	11347160	future and their minds instantly went to
11347160	11349160	there's a lot of prostitutes everywhere.
11349160	11351160	I'm curious if the writers spoke to
11351160	11353160	any sex workers and asked them how
11353160	11355160	they felt about being used as a signifier
11355160	11357160	for societal collapse.
11357160	11359160	This problem is bigger than Human Revolution,
11359160	11361160	obviously. Prostitutes, and more specifically
11361160	11363160	Asian robo-prostitutes, have been a
11363160	11365160	fixture of cyberpunk fiction since
11365160	11367160	its inception. These stories have always
11367160	11369160	leaned on combining the mystery of future
11369160	11371160	technology with the exoticism
11371160	11373160	of foreign cultures. We certainly shouldn't
11373160	11375160	interrogate the Orientalism inherent
11375160	11376160	in that trope.
11376160	11378160	Alec, drop me off at the cyber brothel.
11378160	11380160	Please. I need to look for key cards.
11380160	11382160	The game is ham-fisted in how it
11382160	11384160	talks about augmentations because when
11384160	11386160	it comes down to it, the central question
11386160	11388160	it decided to focus on, whether we should
11388160	11390160	legislate human augmentation or not, just
11390160	11392160	isn't as complicated as it might have seemed
11392160	11394160	when they came up with it. Putting aside the
11394160	11396160	questions about what it means to be human,
11396160	11398160	the more tangible questions on the topic
11398160	11400160	are a bit simpler. For example, if
11400160	11402160	companies started developing prosthetic
11402160	11404160	arms that can shoot explosives and kill
11404160	11406160	everyone in an immediate radius, should
11406160	11408160	there be regulations on who can have those?
11408160	11410160	Uh...
11410160	11412160	Yeah! They should
11412160	11414160	probably ban the war crime blaster
11414160	11416160	before the NRA decided
11416160	11418160	every toddler's god-given right to
11418160	11420160	bear robot arms. In this footage,
11420160	11422160	I was trying to turn invisible and accidentally
11422160	11424160	hit the button right next to it and fat-fingered
11424160	11426160	my way into 12 consecutive
11426160	11428160	life sentences.
11428160	11430160	Pause the video and leave a comment
11430160	11432160	if you think the government shouldn't regulate
11432160	11434160	this. In order to make the questions seem
11434160	11436160	more complicated, the game draws zero
11436160	11438160	distinction between this and the types
11438160	11440160	of theoretical augmentation we can all
11440160	11442160	agree are great. Advanced prosthetics
11442160	11444160	that recreate actual sensory information
11444160	11446160	the way a hand would. Enabling people
11446160	11448160	who have lost limbs to completely replace
11448160	11450160	them. Fully functioning eye replacements.
11450160	11452160	Things like that would be magical
11452160	11454160	for a lot of people. The anti-augmentation
11454160	11456160	groups are written to hate those too.
11456160	11458160	Too much power can make you do terrible
11458160	11460160	things, Mr. Jensen. Zeke Sanders
11460160	11462160	ripped out his prosthetic eye because
11462160	11464160	he hates augmentations that much.
11464160	11466160	They're against all augmentations
11466160	11468160	for pseudo-philosophical reasons to do
11468160	11470160	with changing the core of humanity.
11470160	11472160	We can save people from illnesses,
11472160	11474160	amputation, disfigurement, disability,
11474160	11476160	but at what cost? Ooh!
11476160	11478160	Augmentations help a lot of people, Doc.
11478160	11480160	Handicapped, war vets. Yes, but at
11480160	11482160	what cost? I bet you thought I was joking,
11482160	11484160	didn't you? No, they actually say that.
11484160	11486160	Now, statistically, almost half the people
11486160	11488160	watching this are wearing glasses or
11488160	11490160	lenses like me. Many of you are watching this
11490160	11492160	on the phone they also use whenever they need
11492160	11494160	to check for information on almost any topic.
11494160	11496160	We've already been supplementing our bodies
11496160	11498160	and minds with technology for so long
11498160	11500160	we've almost forgotten we're doing it.
11500160	11502160	By surpassing our human limits,
11502160	11504160	we're destroying our humanity, defeating
11504160	11506160	the purpose of life. Oh, my God, you're totally
11506160	11508160	right. We need to rid the world of people
11508160	11510160	who supplement their bodies with those glasses?
11510160	11512160	So your options
11512160	11514160	in human revolution are between these
11514160	11516160	jokers who are anti-medicine
11516160	11518160	because ooh, what if life-saving surgery
11518160	11520160	takes away some of your soul? Several of
11520160	11522160	which turn out to be the fucking Illuminati
11522160	11524160	and we can't let the government
11524160	11526160	shut us down, Adam. Break into a police station
11526160	11528160	for me. Also, don't forget we installed
11528160	11530160	the secret explosion nightmare cannon in your body.
11530160	11532160	Check this shit out. Yee-haw!
11534160	11536160	The pro-regulation groups have to be
11536160	11538160	written to be extremely stupid
11538160	11540160	and working for the bad guys because otherwise
11540160	11542160	there's no contest. The issue is made
11542160	11544160	all or nothing. Corporations manufacturing
11544160	11546160	concealed carry buster swords
11546160	11548160	versus big government trying to ban
11548160	11550160	what, the concept of prosthesis?
11550160	11552160	Because that's the only way
11552160	11554160	to turn the central focus of the game
11554160	11556160	into something resembling a debate.
11556160	11558160	Human revolution feels like its heart is
11558160	11560160	in the right place, but it's afraid to say
11560160	11562160	too much, so instead you get this
11562160	11564160	really weak stuff like, uh, hey,
11564160	11566160	maybe the military-industrial complex
11566160	11568160	is bad.
11568160	11570160	You're right. The teacher
11570160	11572160	would just love having one of those things.
11572160	11574160	Yeah, if you think about it, making weapons
11574160	11576160	isn't as good for the world as making medicine.
11576160	11578160	Wow! Later when
11578160	11580160	riots start happening in Detroit,
11580160	11582160	the riots are about augmentation, of course,
11582160	11584160	the police have a police version of the robot
11584160	11586160	you were fighting before. That's kinda
11586160	11588160	cool. There's a point being made here by
11588160	11590160	the reuse of an enemy from other parts of the game.
11590160	11592160	You're literally seeing an enemy,
11592160	11594160	but on the side of the cops. I mean,
11594160	11596160	they got this idea from the original Deus Ex
11596160	11598160	when you started seeing rebranded versions of mechs
11598160	11600160	you'd seen before, but still. The game is saying,
11600160	11602160	hey, maybe it's bad the police
11602160	11604160	have tanks? They're arresting
11604160	11606160	tons of people in the street too, but this is
11606160	11608160	set dressing for the fact a riot is happening
11608160	11610160	because people don't like augmentation.
11610160	11612160	The commentary isn't, boy, the police really
11612160	11614160	are making a bad situation worse by taking
11614160	11616160	to the streets with automatic shotguns
11616160	11618160	and fucking tachycomas. The commentary is,
11618160	11620160	wow, things are really heating up about this augmentation
11620160	11622160	thing, huh? The cops really have their hands
11622160	11624160	full with all these crazy rioters. The game
11624160	11626160	respects the cops so much you get
11626160	11628160	hired to help them out during the same
11628160	11630160	level where they're arresting everyone using a
11630160	11632160	rocket mech. You can see what I mean, right?
11632160	11634160	This is okay as far as writing for a video
11634160	11636160	game goes, but terrible as far
11636160	11638160	as writing a story goes. It really
11638160	11640160	doesn't help that it feels like a few key steps
11640160	11642160	of the story got cut out due to time limitations.
11642160	11644160	In the second to last level, it's established
11644160	11646160	that all the major characters from the plot
11646160	11648160	can't be contacted because they're currently en route
11648160	11650160	to a sea base in the middle of the Arctic Ocean.
11650160	11652160	This travel time is important. Jensen
11652160	11654160	then encounters Zhao Yun-Ru, the lady
11654160	11656160	who tricked him earlier, who introduces the boss fight
11656160	11658160	with the biochip reveal. Then it turns out Jensen
11658160	11660160	needs to get to the Arctic Ocean base
11660160	11662160	everyone else went to to stop the conspiracy
11662160	11664160	happening there now, at which point it
11664160	11666160	conveniently turns out there's a special
11666160	11668160	person-sized rocket here which can launch
11668160	11670160	him to the other side of the world faster
11670160	11672160	than anyone's ever traveled anywhere on
11672160	11674160	Earth before, so he goes there
11674160	11676160	and Zhao Yun-Ru's there already.
11676160	11678160	She got here before you and she's the
11678160	11680160	final boss. Uh, hang on
11680160	11682160	a second. How did you get here? Was there
11682160	11684160	a second rocket stashed away somewhere?
11684160	11686160	Can you give me the cliff notes on what is
11686160	11688160	happening here? No wonder the last level
11688160	11690160	takes place in a giant hole.
11690160	11692160	Presumably in an earlier draft, there was
11692160	11694160	a level or two between these, creating
11694160	11696160	a time gap where it was plausible for Zhao Yun-Ru
11696160	11698160	to get to the middle of the Arctic Ocean.
11698160	11700160	When you land in the ocean in the cutscene,
11700160	11702160	you just spawn on a landing pad
11702160	11704160	next to all these helicopters where I assume
11704160	11706160	you were going to get dropped off for a
11706160	11708160	sensible reason in an earlier draft of the
11708160	11710160	story, or maybe they just didn't
11710160	11712160	care to explain this. I mean, Jensen
11712160	11714160	doesn't even look for her before he leaves.
11714160	11716160	She fucks up Jensen's augmentations,
11716160	11718160	walks off screen, and he forgets
11718160	11720160	she exists. Men never
11720160	11722160	fail to forget where women are in
11722160	11724160	physical space. Instead of building to
11724160	11726160	some larger question, it builds towards a
11726160	11728160	comical over-the-top video game zombie
11728160	11730160	movie climax. The big reveal
11730160	11732160	of the plot is that the Illuminati are figuring
11732160	11734160	out a way to control people using their
11734160	11736160	augmentations. Then one of them goes
11736160	11738160	rogue and presses a button that makes everyone
11738160	11740160	with an augmentation go insane. He does this
11740160	11742160	to make a point about augmentations being
11742160	11744160	bad. Adam Jensen, who didn't get
11744160	11746160	the replacement chip, or did but got an injection
11746160	11748160	of nanomachines, so he's fine.
11748160	11750160	That's the explanation they give. Saves the day
11750160	11752160	by flying to ground zero and turning it off.
11752160	11754160	This is a waste of the potentially realistic
11754160	11756160	and interesting ways you could have taken
11756160	11758160	this story. Instead of seriously exploring
11758160	11760160	the problems with centralization or
11760160	11762160	authorities like governments having control over
11762160	11764160	your life, it settles for the much less deep
11764160	11766160	question, would it be bad if the
11766160	11768160	Illuminati hacked your grandmother's
11768160	11770160	hip replacement and made her into a killing
11770160	11772160	machine? And the answer to that question,
11772160	11774160	shockingly enough, is, yeah, that would
11774160	11776160	be quite bad, but that's not science
11776160	11778160	fiction or cyberpunk or transhumanism
11778160	11780160	or discussing the implications of
11780160	11782160	future technology. That's just stupid.
11782160	11784160	You haven't told a story about
11784160	11786160	power and control. You wrote a cartoon
11786160	11788160	about how bad it would be if there was a big
11788160	11790160	button that killed everyone. You're not presenting
11790160	11792160	a nuanced issue here. You can
11792160	11794160	most easily identify the core problems
11794160	11796160	with the storytelling and how the game reuses
11796160	11798160	ideas that were in the original, but in the
11798160	11800160	complete opposite way. Okay, so
11800160	11802160	in Deus Ex, one of the big things about the Illuminati
11802160	11804160	and their offshoot, MJ-12,
11804160	11806160	is they're super pretentious. No one
11806160	11808160	names their AI algorithms Morpheus
11808160	11810160	or Daedalus unless they like the smell
11810160	11812160	of their own farts. Like, MJ-12's
11812160	11814160	organizational structure and clearance levels
11814160	11816160	are types of angel arranged in order
11816160	11818160	of closeness to the throne of God,
11818160	11820160	with the top one being literally God clearance
11820160	11822160	and the one below it being Seraphic,
11822160	11824160	like as in Seraphim. The founder of
11824160	11826160	MJ-12 is writing Bible fanfiction
11826160	11828160	and casting himself as
11828160	11830160	God. This isn't just a piece of
11830160	11832160	lore or meant to sound cool.
11832160	11834160	This is a joke. Bob Page,
11834160	11836160	the guy who started MJ-12, doesn't really
11836160	11838160	understand the teachings of the Illuminati
11838160	11840160	and thinks he's a genius, so to sound
11840160	11842160	clever, he named the structure of his
11842160	11844160	organization around stuff he thought sounded
11844160	11846160	deep. Seraphic? Wow,
11846160	11848160	I'm so smart. I'm a philosopher.
11848160	11850160	I'm fucking play two.
11850160	11852160	Page named the special AI he wanted
11852160	11854160	to use to take over the world Icarus.
11854160	11856160	This is a joke. He's trying
11856160	11858160	to sound cool, and it's really silly.
11858160	11860160	Like New Vegas with its Caesar cosplayer,
11860160	11862160	Deus Ex is making fun of how stupid it is
11862160	11864160	to try to sound clever by making surface
11864160	11866160	references to stuff people think is deep.
11866160	11868160	Cue Human Revolution, which bases
11868160	11870160	a shit ton of its imagery around the myth
11870160	11872160	of Icarus because it sounds deep.
11872160	11874160	♪♪
11874160	11876160	♪♪
11876160	11878160	♪♪
11878160	11880160	♪♪
11880160	11882160	I never asked for this.
11882160	11884160	Yay! Augmentation
11884160	11886160	is like Icarus' wax wings,
11886160	11888160	and the sun represents, uh,
11888160	11890160	augmentation turning out to be bad.
11890160	11892160	Look, I don't mean any offense to people
11892160	11894160	who thought this was clever when this trailer came out.
11894160	11896160	Demographically speaking, you were 15.
11896160	11898160	I'm merely giving you the opportunity
11898160	11900160	to consider that this might just look smart
11900160	11902160	while not actually saying anything
11902160	11904160	remotely relevant or useful
11904160	11906160	about the world we live in, and this shit
11906160	11908160	is omnipresent throughout the game.
11908160	11910160	The first Icarus thing you see
11910160	11912160	is the very first thing you see
11912160	11914160	in the game. The slow fall augmentation
11914160	11916160	is called the Icarus landing system.
11916160	11918160	There's a book you can read in the game
11918160	11920160	called Building Wings.
11920160	11922160	The game's title theme on the soundtrack
11922160	11924160	is called Icarus, of course. The tie-in novel
11924160	11926160	for the game was named Deus Ex Icarus Effect,
11926160	11928160	and then the tie-in novel
11928160	11930160	had a tie-in game for phones
11930160	11932160	and later the PC called Deus Ex
11932160	11934160	The Fall because, you know, Icarus
11934160	11936160	falling into the sea, which happens
11936160	11938160	to the character in the game too. That sounds
11938160	11940160	familiar. Oh, wait, because it also happens
11940160	11942160	to Adam both in the game and then
11942160	11944160	afterwards in the ending. He falls into the sea again
11944160	11946160	then. In this world, everyone is Icarus
11946160	11948160	drowning in the sea
11948160	11950160	of this symbolism. The Fall was
11950160	11952160	gonna have a slightly subtler title to begin with.
11952160	11954160	According to unused images in the game's files,
11954160	11956160	they were gonna call it Icarus Rising
11956160	11958160	and, like, I hope I'm not the first person to point
11958160	11960160	this out for you, but Sarif Industries' logo
11960160	11962160	is just a fucking wing and Tai Yong Medical,
11962160	11964160	their antagonist, their levels are all sun
11964160	11966160	themed. Look, the sun is coming from both
11966160	11968160	sides of the room at once because it's like they're
11968160	11970160	bathed in the sun. You know, Icarus
11970160	11972160	is natural enemy or something.
11972160	11974160	Tai Yong is named that because that's the Chinese
11974160	11976160	phrase for the sun. They wanted
11976160	11978160	to continue their sun Icarus metaphor
11978160	11980160	so they googled the sun in
11980160	11982160	Chinese. Sarif is a deliberate
11982160	11984160	pun on seraphim. Deus Ex
11984160	11986160	literally made a joke about people who think
11986160	11988160	referencing the seraphim is clever.
11988160	11990160	This is the shit Bob Page would come up
11990160	11992160	with if you made him write a Deus Ex game.
11992160	11994160	Even the man responsible explains his
11994160	11996160	motivations using a hackneyed Icarus
11996160	11998160	metaphor. I prefer to think of myself as
11998160	12000160	deadless, watching helplessly
12000160	12002160	as his child crashes into the sea.
12002160	12004160	Darrow is currently looking
12004160	12006160	into an ocean we just crashed
12006160	12008160	into as part of a previous unrelated
12008160	12010160	flying too close to the sun crashing
12010160	12012160	into the ocean metaphor. Watching
12012160	12014160	helplessly as his child crashes
12014160	12016160	into the sea. Read a second
12016160	12018160	Greek myth. I'm begging you.
12018160	12020160	Why do we build the wall? I think the moment
12020160	12022160	I knew the game was gonna be really misguided
12022160	12024160	was when one of the trailers flashed through a bunch
12024160	12026160	of generic We Are Smart imagery
12026160	12028160	and renaissance stuff and one of the things
12028160	12030160	that flashes up is a sign saying we don't let
12030160	12032160	augmented people in here. Like,
12032160	12034160	okay, segregation.
12034160	12036160	You're making a game about segregation,
12036160	12038160	a real thing that is horrible,
12038160	12040160	and you're also making a game about the cyber
12040160	12042160	renaissance and how cool it is to reference
12042160	12044160	the myth of Icarus. We flew too
12044160	12046160	close to the big yong, and you
12046160	12048160	know what that means?
12048160	12050160	Apartheid. It sucks because,
12050160	12052160	like, how many other games take their stories
12052160	12054160	seriously enough that a main character says something
12054160	12056160	like, hey, it's weird we spend most of our time
12056160	12058160	inventing weapons for the government, right?
12058160	12060160	I want to love any game that
12060160	12062160	takes that step, but when that's the
12062160	12064160	only step it takes and the other clever
12064160	12066160	thing he says was only in the trailer,
12066160	12068160	and the rest of the story is preoccupied with stuff
12068160	12070160	the original game made fun of for being
12070160	12072160	pretentious as shit, I've got to say
12072160	12074160	I don't think it's out of place to expect
12074160	12076160	a little more. Please, sir, can I have
12076160	12078160	some more delicious sauce?
12078160	12080160	Those elements mixed together is definitely
12080160	12082160	like a sauce. The story being this
12082160	12084160	simplistic makes the okay to mediocre
12084160	12086160	gameplay feel so much worse.
12086160	12088160	Even when the original was being annoying
12088160	12090160	or awkward to play, you were a few minutes
12090160	12092160	away from a truly fascinating conversation
12092160	12094160	you couldn't get anywhere else.
12094160	12096160	If you didn't like an aspect of the original's
12096160	12098160	story, a lot more stuff was going on.
12098160	12100160	Like the hacking minigame,
12100160	12102160	if you think the augmentation stuff in
12102160	12104160	Human Revolution is dumb, you can't escape it.
12104160	12106160	It's everywhere. At every moment,
12106160	12108160	right up until the plot manages to drag
12108160	12110160	itself over the finish line.
12110160	12112160	Human Revolution's
12112160	12114160	endings are what would happen
12114160	12116160	if a fart could die.
12116160	12118160	After defeating the final boss once she plugs
12118160	12120160	herself into a supercomputer powered by
12120160	12122160	screaming women, if that seems like it came out of
12122160	12124160	left field, that's because it did, you get to
12124160	12126160	pick how the game ends. Now, the original
12126160	12128160	game was criticized for how the endings weren't
12128160	12130160	based on your choices throughout the story or
12130160	12132160	their wider consequences, but instead on what
12132160	12134160	you chose to do in the final level.
12134160	12136160	Each of the endings had its own unique set of objectives,
12136160	12138160	but still, it means only the last
12138160	12140160	20 minutes of the game affects how the
12140160	12142160	story ends. The creators of Human
12142160	12144160	Revolution decided to give players something
12144160	12146160	to really complain about. Now you
12146160	12148160	pick an ending from one of three buttons at
12148160	12150160	a computer, which decides who gets blamed
12150160	12152160	for augmented people turning into zombies
12152160	12154160	for 40 minutes. There's also a fourth
12154160	12156160	button which destroys the entire ocean
12156160	12158160	facility, meaning no one has any idea
12158160	12160160	what really happened and everyone on the
12160160	12162160	facility, including Adam, dies.
12162160	12164160	You don't get to see what actually happens when you
12164160	12166160	press any button, though. The ending cinematics
12166160	12168160	are just shots of actual protests and shit.
12168160	12170160	Tinted yellow, obviously. Can't let
12170160	12172160	this actual news footage of real police
12172160	12174160	brutality ruin your visual aesthetic,
12174160	12176160	bro. Big bro.
12176160	12178160	This oil spill footage wasn't deep enough
12178160	12180160	so we made it cyber.
12180160	12182160	Think about it. Adam shoots
12182160	12184160	the shit about life, the universe, and
12184160	12186160	everything, and the credits roll. Then you
12186160	12188160	get a post-credits scene where Adam's ex-girlfriend
12188160	12190160	talks to Bob Page and the game cuts
12190160	12192160	to a title screen and the original Deus Ex
12192160	12194160	theme starts playing, as if to say,
12194160	12196160	do you get it?
12198160	12200160	Yes, I did get it. That was
12200160	12202160	what you were referencing. Thank you. These
12202160	12204160	endings have been criticized to hell and back already,
12204160	12206160	but what I find fascinating about that is how their
12206160	12208160	extreme badness rescued the
12208160	12210160	game from more hard-hitting criticism.
12210160	12212160	People complain about the endings and then
12212160	12214160	don't have room to talk about the incomprehensible
12214160	12216160	final boss who, just to make it clear,
12216160	12218160	I still don't know how to beat, the
12218160	12220160	you-win cinematic just seems to play on its
12220160	12222160	own eventually, or how the last level just
12222160	12224160	throws the whole gameplay structure out the window,
12224160	12226160	the second half's complete lack of
12226160	12228160	almost any side quests, and the fact you haven't
12228160	12230160	made a single impactive choice
12230160	12232160	in the game except how long you dawdle
12232160	12234160	in your office and whether to fall for
12234160	12236160	an obvious trap. The endings being
12236160	12238160	this memorably bad has almost
12238160	12240160	done the game a service. Hey, uh,
12240160	12242160	designers, if you're making a game
12242160	12244160	and you're worried it's a bit mediocre, have
12244160	12246160	the endings be complete shit. Just nosedive
12246160	12248160	it at the last possible second.
12248160	12250160	People will think your game is decent and just
12250160	12252160	let down by the endings and forget
12252160	12254160	they spent half of it in a vent looking for
12254160	12256160	the next forced hacking minigame.
12256160	12258160	All that said, at least Human Revolution
12258160	12260160	has endings. Mankind Divided just
12260160	12262160	ends by hacking.
12262160	12264160	["Human Revolution"]
12264160	12266160	["Human Revolution"]
12266160	12268160	["Human Revolution"]
12268160	12269660	It doesn't go that low.
12269660	12271660	Oh, you're kidding me. So that's
12271660	12273660	Deus Ex Human Revolution, a really
12273660	12275660	decent game with a pretty flawed story
12275660	12277660	and vastly simplified mechanics
12277660	12279660	and design from its predecessor in the hope
12279660	12281660	a streamlined experience would appeal
12281660	12283660	to more people than the original, and
12283660	12285660	to be sure, it did. It sold
12285660	12287660	and reviewed really well, and it
12287660	12289660	deserved to. If it didn't come with the baggage
12289660	12291660	and expectations of being a Deus Ex
12291660	12293660	game, I'd call it an okay but extremely
12293660	12295660	promising first game from a new
12295660	12297660	studio, and broadly speaking, I
12297660	12299660	think Mankind Divided delivered on many of
12299660	12301660	those promises five years later. You can
12301660	12303660	even pick up and throw plants now!
12303660	12305660	Hey, guys, you seeing this?
12305660	12307660	Why did no one
12307660	12309660	tell me about this?
12309660	12311660	Mankind Divided's quality is a story for
12311660	12313660	another video, but for now it's worth asking,
12313660	12315660	hey, it's been another five
12315660	12317660	years. Where's the sequel to Mankind
12317660	12319660	Divided? Where's MD2,
12319660	12321660	if you will? Well,
12321660	12323660	Deus Ex's corporate masters are
12323660	12325660	treating it about as well as they always have.
12325660	12327660	This version of Deus Ex has been
12327660	12329660	effectively abandoned, so we saw
12329660	12331660	Eidos Montreal work on the next Tomb Raider
12331660	12333660	and help out on the Avengers game and make
12333660	12335660	that Guardians of the Galaxy thing.
12335660	12337660	Several of the Deus Ex team's core
12337660	12339660	membership quit en masse and went off to another
12339660	12341660	studio a few years back. This includes
12341660	12343660	our old friend Francois Lapikus, whose
12343660	12345660	LinkedIn lists him as game director for almost
12345660	12347660	four years on a cancelled project
12347660	12349660	codenamed MD2.
12349660	12351660	I wonder what that might have been.
12351660	12353660	Immersive sims are hard to make and really
12353660	12355660	expensive if you want to compete with other
12355660	12357660	AAA games. Despite selling pretty well,
12357660	12359660	Mankind Divided didn't set the world
12359660	12361660	on fire the way it needed to to justify
12361660	12363660	continued sequels. It's possible
12363660	12365660	to make a game tons of people like,
12365660	12367660	but not enough to play all the way to the end
12367660	12369660	and whose sequel they might not even bother with
12369660	12371660	even if they have fond memories of the
12371660	12373660	previous one. I only started playing
12373660	12375660	Mankind Divided in preparation for this video
12375660	12377660	because I lost interest in the series after
12377660	12379660	liking Human Revolution okay, but
12379660	12381660	not being that into seeing more of the same.
12381660	12383660	And many of my friends who
12383660	12385660	remember liking Human Revolution way more
12385660	12387660	than me still haven't got around to playing it
12387660	12389660	either. What's the holdup?
12389660	12391660	Perhaps the gamble of making a simpler, more
12391660	12393660	generally marketable experience didn't
12393660	12395660	pay off quite as well as it seemed.
12395660	12397660	Maybe it's possible to make something thousands
12397660	12399660	of people like, but don't necessarily
12399660	12401660	love, at least not enough to
12401660	12403660	come back for more. Human Revolution
12403660	12405660	definitely has its diehard fans,
12405660	12407660	and that's cool, but a lot of its players
12407660	12409660	simply liked it and then stopped halfway
12409660	12411660	through to play something else and never came
12411660	12413660	back. Sure, making health systems
12413660	12415660	more like Call of Duty or adding cover
12415660	12417660	mechanics to make it more like Gears of War
12417660	12419660	might sound like a positive selling
12419660	12421660	point on a slideshow in a meeting,
12421660	12423660	but the people who love those games already have
12423660	12425660	a game that does them better than Human Revolution
12425660	12427660	did, and people who actually liked
12427660	12429660	Deus Ex's complexity don't get
12429660	12431660	that in Human Revolution. So
12431660	12433660	who would come back for more of this?
12433660	12435660	That's definitely not the whole story.
12435660	12437660	Square Enix and Eidos Montreal's
12437660	12439660	management certainly squandered all the good
12439660	12441660	will the developers had rightfully earned
12441660	12443660	with their pre-order bullshit and
12443660	12445660	in-game microtransactions bullshit
12445660	12447660	and the free-to-play game glued
12447660	12449660	to the side of a game people already
12449660	12451660	paid money for, but when it comes down
12451660	12453660	to it, as good as Human Revolution
12453660	12455660	was, the one thing it wasn't was
12455660	12457660	a sequel seller. Who's on the edge of
12457660	12459660	their seats to find out what happens next
12459660	12461660	to endings like these? Also,
12461660	12463660	you know, it's a prequel. We kind
12463660	12465660	of know what happens next.
12465660	12467660	Deus Ex was once a game people loved
12467660	12469660	so much, a company decided it was worth
12469660	12471660	making another one many years later.
12471660	12473660	Do people love Human Revolution
12473660	12475660	the same way, or do they simply
12475660	12477660	like it? I think that if
12477660	12479660	Human Revolution had come out two years after
12479660	12481660	the original Deus Ex on a slightly
12481660	12483660	updated version of the original's engine,
12483660	12485660	people would instantly see what's lacking about
12485660	12487660	it, dismiss it as a mediocre imitator
12487660	12489660	that didn't really understand what makes
12489660	12491660	the original work. It would have been hated
12491660	12493660	for the crime of failing to be
12493660	12495660	as good as the best video game ever made.
12495660	12497660	I wonder if that's common in gaming
12497660	12499660	culture, but it didn't come out two years
12499660	12501660	later. It came out a decade later
12501660	12503660	in a market that hadn't seen anything like
12503660	12505660	it for a long time. It was a relief
12505660	12507660	a game even a bit like Deus Ex
12507660	12509660	could still get made. It was a breath
12509660	12511660	of fresh air to the 2011 game
12511660	12513660	industry. It's just that when you compare
12513660	12515660	it with the games it's trying to be like,
12515660	12517660	it doesn't hold up quite so well. The quality
12517660	12519660	of other recent immersive sims,
12519660	12521660	including Mankind Divided, demonstrates
12521660	12523660	the true classics of the genre are as good
12523660	12525660	as they are because they dedicate themselves to doing
12525660	12527660	what they do well. The first Deus Ex
12527660	12529660	was a niche game, a weird
12529660	12531660	complicated experience for a certain
12531660	12533660	type of nerd. Us nerds loved
12533660	12535660	it, and it sold pretty well, though
12535660	12537660	not super amazingly. I'm pretty sure
12537660	12539660	Human Revolution outsold it, but many
12539660	12541660	developers working today are openly
12541660	12543660	inspired by the first Deus Ex.
12543660	12545660	I'm genuinely curious how many
12545660	12547660	developers are specifically inspired
12547660	12549660	by Human Revolution instead.
12549660	12557660	So where do we put this guy on my list of every video game ranked in order of objective value?
12557660	12559660	It's weird how no one thought to make one of
12559660	12561660	these before. With heavy heart, I have no
12561660	12563660	choice but to put this game on the very
12563660	12565660	bottom of the list. There.
12565660	12567660	As of the time of this video,
12567660	12569660	Deus Ex Human Revolution is the worst
12569660	12571660	game ever made. Oh, I forgot to add
12571660	12573660	Fallout 3, the second worst game ever made.
12573660	12575660	But hey, DXHR fans, try
12575660	12577660	not to think of it that way. Try and think of it
12577660	12579660	as the third best game. Maybe it'll
12579660	12581660	even work out better than the next Gex.
12581660	12583660	Gex! Gex! Gex! Sadly,
12583660	12585660	it seems Square Enix are looking for fresh
12585660	12587660	victims. In December last year, while I was
12587660	12589660	deep in the making of this video and had already
12589660	12591660	written a bunch of jokes for the conclusion about what
12591660	12593660	lessons Square Enix needs to learn in time for the
12593660	12595660	new Gex game, I had a really good joke about
12595660	12597660	making sure Gex doesn't ride any elevators.
12597660	12599660	Trust me. Squeenix went out and filed
12599660	12601660	a new trademark for the Gex IP,
12601660	12603660	making the intended joke of this video
12603660	12605660	no longer a joke. They killed
12605660	12607660	Thief, they killed Deus Ex, and
12607660	12609660	they think they can take on a third. Let me
12609660	12611660	be the first to say, good luck
12611660	12613660	guys. When you come at the king,
12613660	12615660	you better not miss. And if Gex
12615660	12617660	has to do a single fucking
12617660	12619660	hacking minigame...

12635660	12637660	Hey, thanks for watching.
12637660	12639660	I'm sorry. At the
12639660	12641660	end of another long video, I promised I wouldn't
12641660	12643660	make a video any longer than I already had.
12643660	12645660	It's really embarrassing that I keep making
12645660	12647660	things way longer. I tried.
12647660	12649660	I really tried. I cut out a whole 15
12649660	12651660	minutes about the history of mirrors in video
12651660	12653660	games and made it a bonus video for patrons
12653660	12655660	in the hopes of getting the length under control
12655660	12657660	and it just kept growing. Thanks to all
12657660	12659660	my patrons for allowing me to survive while
12659660	12661660	making this. In case you're wondering,
12661660	12663660	no, this isn't my normal recording setup.
12663660	12665660	I'm actually visiting my producer
12665660	12667660	on my way to a wedding and it
12667660	12669660	turns out that she has
12669660	12671660	put some foam up in her closet
12671660	12673660	so I'm just recording here for now.
12673660	12675660	If any of the voiceover sounds bad,
12675660	12677660	it's her fault.
12677660	12679660	And in case you asked, yes, these are
12679660	12681660	the clothes I intend to wear for the wedding.
12681660	12683660	I didn't bring any smart clothes to wear
12683660	12685660	for recording the live action part of this video.
12685660	12687660	And I forgot to bring shoes, so
12687660	12689660	hopefully no one looks at my feet.
12691660	12693660	I don't know why I brought that up.
12693660	12695660	I went to Birmingham for
12695660	12697660	a different wedding, like,
12697660	12699660	four years ago and my car
12699660	12701660	got broken into and my nice
12701660	12703660	shoes were stolen and I never got
12703660	12705660	replacements.
12705660	12707660	So
12735660	12737660	...
12737660	12739660	...
12739660	12741660	...
12741660	12743660	...
12743660	12745660	...
12745660	12747660	...
12747660	12749660	...
12749660	12751660	...
12751660	12753660	...
12753660	12755660	...
12755660	12757660	...
12757660	12759660	...
12759660	12761660	I've actually tried to make a video
12761660	12763660	about Deus Ex Human Revolution.
12763660	12765660	Every year and a half I've, like,
12765660	12767660	restarted since
12767660	12769660	2016. It was, like, the second long
12769660	12771660	video I wanted to make and I just kept
12771660	12773660	giving up because the
12773660	12775660	video script ballooned to a length
12775660	12777660	where I was like, this is unwatchable.
12777660	12779660	And I only finished it this time because I just
12779660	12781660	accepted I have to make
12781660	12783660	a video that's too long to get
12783660	12785660	this thing out of my brain and move on with my life.
12785660	12787660	And now I'm finally free
12787660	12789660	and I can move on to other things, which is lovely.
12789660	12791660	So
12791660	12793660	the next game I want to review
12793660	12795660	is the Deus Ex
12795660	12797660	Human Revolution Director's Cut
12799660	12801660	and that is not a joke.
12803660	12805660	And I'm scared.
12809660	12811660	I'm scared about what is
12811660	12813660	happening to me.
