In June 2000,

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,480
Ion Storm released Deus Ex.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,980
Deus Ex is one of the best games ever made.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,820
Its engaging free-form gameplay

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,980
and complex storytelling quickly cemented it

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,160
as one of the true classics of the medium.

♪

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,500
So the developer went bankrupt.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,800
If that line sounds familiar to you,

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,460
get used to it. Like, 12 more videos

12
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,460
are gonna start this way.

13
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,260
Eidos Interactive, the game's publisher,

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,600
was the 51% shareholder in Ion Storm,

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,060
so when the company closed its doors

16
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,840
and the creators quit or got let go,

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,500
the Deus Ex intellectual property

18
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,180
didn't belong to any of the people who,

19
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,440
you know, made it,

20
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,940
but to a bunch of executives at a publishing company.

21
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,040
Then Eidos Interactive's parent company,

22
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,040
also named Eidos,

23
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,720
which made researching this very confusing,

24
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,020
got bought and merged with another game publisher,

25
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,420
Sales Curve Interactive.

26
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,060
Then they hit major financial trouble

27
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,260
and realized they need to make games to survive

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,380
and opened a new development studio in Canada

29
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,060
which began development on the next Deus Ex game.

30
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,060
While that was happening,

31
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,720
things were going great at SCI.

32
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,120
Just kidding, it went so bad the CEO got fired.

33
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,120
To get a fresh start,

34
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,560
they renamed the company to Eidos.

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,560
Hold on a second.

36
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,060
Then they got bought again,

37
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,560
this time by Square Enix.

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,500
Square Enix said they were going to leave Eidos

39
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,400
to themselves, then changed their mind

40
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,900
and forcibly merged the company

41
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,700
with their European branch and oh, my God,

42
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,080
isn't the game industry so normal and fine?

43
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,780
While all of that was happening,

44
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,200
the team at Eidos Montreal

45
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,340
had to somehow make a video game.

46
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,980
The making of documentary for this new Deus Ex game

47
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,140
begins with a bunch of talk about how great it is

48
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,940
to work with Eidos from French-Canadian developers

49
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,020
wearing t-shirts with the Eidos branding.

50
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,980
Eidos has a very rich IP portfolio.

51
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,360
I mean, their projects are just great.

52
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,980
Their IPs are very rich.

53
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,560
Partway through, Eidos disappears

54
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,060
from the story completely because they stopped existing

55
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,560
and they suddenly had completely different bosses.

56
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,460
Being owned by Square Enix came with some benefits though.

57
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,680
They got to reference Final Fantasy a few times.

58
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,060
One of the bosses, a big guy with a gun for an arm,

59
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,520
got to be named Barret.

60
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,520
They put a poster on some character's walls

61
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,720
for a Final Fantasy 27, you know,

62
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,320
because it's the future. It's cute.

63
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,820
So it wasn't all bad.

64
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,200
Just kidding. It was bad.

65
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,820
The executives at Square Enix

66
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,900
weren't going to let them do this.

67
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,320
They didn't want to risk damaging

68
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,740
the Final Fantasy brand

69
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,120
any more than Kingdom Hearts already.

70
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,660
The team at Eidos Montreal had to argue their way up

71
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,240
the corporate chain of the business

72
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,380
that just bought them all the way up to Yoichi Wada,

73
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,880
the president and director of the entire company,

74
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,300
to get permission to put a funny poster

75
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,460
in the background of their game.

76
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,020
Deus Ex used to be a series that criticized

77
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,140
the bizarre machinations of corporations

78
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,340
so big no one knows who they're working for,

79
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,060
where intellectual property and brand management

80
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,520
mattered more than people,

81
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,100
a world where one company can own half your childhood,

82
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,520
a system governed more by tax incentives

83
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,400
and corporate subsidies than people.

84
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,940
It asked important questions about the future of mankind,

85
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,180
about who wielded power over others

86
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,260
and what their interests really were,

87
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,720
a story sometimes so accurate in its guesses

88
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,300
it seems less fictitious now than ever.

89
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,640
But then, many years and corporate acquisitions later,

90
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,480
comes Deus Ex Human Revolution,

91
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,640
the game that dares to ask the question,

92
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,360
what if we had robot arms?

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:30,800
♪♪

94
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,420
Deus Ex Human Revolution is pretty good.

95
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,420
It's fun. Yeah.

96
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,420
I have a tendency to make videos about things

97
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,420
I either really love or really hate,

98
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,020
so just to clear up any potential confusion here,

99
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,060
this game is fine. Good job, guys.

100
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,100
I'm about to spend, uh, oh, my God,

101
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,900
complaining about it, but I need to say,

102
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,680
this was the first game by a new studio,

103
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,140
and it was being made while they were being bought out

104
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,060
by Square Enix by a team that had never previously worked

105
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,520
on any games even remotely like Deus Ex.

106
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,160
I might not think the game is perfect,

107
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,820
but it is a genuine achievement that it's this good.

108
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,740
So why am I talking about it then?

109
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,460
That's a good question. Me?

110
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,740
Well, here's the thing.

111
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,540
The original Deus Ex belonged to a special subgenre

112
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,800
of games named the immersive sim.

113
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,660
In a sentence, immersive sims are games

114
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,960
that feel just that little bit more like worlds

115
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,160
you're taking part in.

116
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,980
They prioritized the player's freedom

117
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,700
to choose how to solve problems

118
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,540
and then dealing with the consequences of those choices

119
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,540
and being able to find creative and unexpected solutions,

120
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,000
often ones the developers themselves hadn't thought of,

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,080
by being built in a way that could respond well

122
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,420
to player creativity.

123
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,580
There's a lot of different ways

124
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,260
you can define an immersive sim,

125
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,880
but there's only one real one.

126
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,680
Can you solve a problem intended to be solved with a gun

127
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,920
by stacking a bunch of boxes and going over it?

128
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,920
In the late 90s and early 2000s,

129
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,980
immersive sims were coming out fairly often,

130
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,600
and people still look back fondly

131
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,020
on many of those games,

132
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,360
but then almost overnight, they disappeared.

133
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,600
An entire genre of games basically died out for years,

134
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,700
but a couple of years back,

135
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,200
we started to get more of them again,

136
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,860
and they're amazing and beautiful

137
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,160
and a lot like the games that people remember.

138
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,080
Human Revolution is a fascinating orphan of history.

139
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,540
It came out between the two golden ages

140
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,660
of the immersive sim when this type of game

141
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,160
wasn't considered popular or profitable enough,

142
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,280
so while they were making it,

143
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,780
the team made a lot of changes

144
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,780
to try and make it a bit like other games

145
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,040
people liked at the time,

146
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,420
trying to streamline it and make it more accessible

147
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,740
for a console audience.

148
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,540
I'll give you three guesses why they decided

149
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,660
the game needed third-person cover shooting,

150
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,800
and at the time of release,

151
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,840
people seemed happy with its compromises,

152
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,920
but the thing about immersive sims is

153
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,140
they were already great and didn't need changing.

154
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,420
Recent games like the new Prey have proven

155
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,840
immersive sims barely need to change at all

156
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,380
from how they were 20 years ago

157
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,940
to be amazing at what they're trying to do,

158
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,820
so when the Human Revolution team decided

159
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,580
the Deus Ex formula was broken,

160
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,040
all their fixes actually made it less like

161
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,620
what makes these games great,

162
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,540
so today in this year's self-therapy session

163
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,420
masquerading as a video game analysis,

164
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,800
I'll be trying to get to the bottom

165
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,340
of what happened to Deus Ex

166
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,040
to see what we can learn about how

167
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,220
or how not to modernize a classic

168
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,760
because there's a lot more at stake here

169
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,680
than just one beloved franchise.

170
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,380
After doing some digging into the lineage

171
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,880
of the intellectual property rights

172
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,340
of some of my favorite franchises,

173
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,100
I discovered Square Enix might not just be rebooting

174
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,300
slash remaking slash beating the dead horses

175
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,100
of the Deus Ex, Tomb Raider, and Thief properties.

176
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,100
No, a much more important franchise

177
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,600
lives under their jurisdiction,

178
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,940
one of the most important and meaningful stories

179
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,280
in gaming history.

180
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,860
I'm speaking, of course, about Gex.

181
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,940
The Gex trilogy sold millions of copies

182
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,700
and arguably saved the world,

183
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,820

364
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,200
the intro of the director's cut

365
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,960
and there was still, like, two minutes left of this.

366
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,620
I should have bothered to wash my hands.

367
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,420
Uh, fun fact, the Human Revolution

368
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,800
speedrunning community have a shared save file

369
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,920
that starts right after the walk and talk

370
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,760
because holy shit, can you imagine

371
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,600
having to sit through that every time?

372
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,220
Oh, my God, I can't even close the game

373
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,520
to stop the experiment.

374
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,100
It just goes to this screen.

375
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,640
You can't even open the menu.

376
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,900
Alt-F4?

377
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,020
Okay, you can at least go it that way.

378
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,820
♪♪

379
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,660
It crashed. It's fucking crashed.

380
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,440
Now, I get what they're going for.

381
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,580
Games with a more linear cinematic intent

382
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,580
like Red Dead Redemption or The Last of Us

383
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,700
or even Half-Life bring you into the narrative

384
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,120
by slowly building to their gameplay like this,

385
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,200
but for RPGs with a focus on player freedom and choice,

386
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
this is the opposite of what you should do.

387
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,360
The player doesn't feel like they're taking part

388
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,440
in the story when they can barely control

389
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,780
where Adam aims his head for most of his big introduction.

390
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,320
For games like Deus Ex,

391
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,420
which Human Revolution says it's trying to give people,

392
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,460
you want the player to have a sense of control

393
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,620
as soon as possible.

394
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,620
Once it's over, though,

395
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,000
everything really picks up,

396
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,500
so it's not that big a deal,

397
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
but if it's not a big deal, then why did I waste

398
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,260
so much time complaining about it?

399
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,760
Well, first of all, leave me alone.

400
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,200
It's my video. I can do what I want.

401
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,200
And secondly, I think this choice reflects

402
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,940
a pretty serious misunderstanding

403
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,500
about what makes these games fun to play.

404
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,780
You see, this is an exact mistake

405
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,120
the original game almost made too.

406
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,080
See? I'm going somewhere with this.

407
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
Please subscribe.

408
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,660
They originally planned to begin

409
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,260
with meeting all of your coworkers in your base,

410
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,500
talking to everyone,

411
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,220
a lot of exposition and setup and introductions,

412
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,600
basically a lot of busy work

413
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
that wouldn't be that fun to do first thing

414
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,020
the instant you hit new game.

415
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,100
Before there was an attack on UNATCO HQ

416
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,900
that necessitated going into action.

417
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,900
In other words, they had the same idea

418
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,860
as the people who made Human Revolution,

419
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,900
but they later realized it would be better

420
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,400
if they started with gameplay

421
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,280
and deliberately switched the order.

422
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,900
This introduces a minor weird plot thing.

423
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,580
You arrive on an island to deal with a terrorist attack

424
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,540
and it's right next to where your new base happens to be.

425
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,960
This would have made slightly more sense

426
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,380
when you started at the base

427
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,760
and went out when they attacked headquarters,

428
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,840
which is how it seemed to work in original footage

429
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,040
from betas of the game,

430
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,580
but it was worth it to make this change

431
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,000
because the player feels like a part of the story now,

432
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,800
which is, you know, the goal of role-playing games.

433
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,420
You don't feel like a part of the story

434
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,420
by watching the character do things.

435
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,680
You feel that way by getting to do things as the character,

436
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,220
and there's a big difference there.

437
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,880
I don't like giving direct advice

438
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,900
like I know the exact correct way to make a game,

439
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,400
but guys, start the game here.

440
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,440
Start at the thing or in the plane

441
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,560
on the way to the thing.

442
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,140
The next game, Mankind Divided,

443
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,700
did exactly that. You start on the plane.

444
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,000
I mean, it had three more opening sequences

445
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,040
after it for some reason.

446
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,620
More importantly than any of this though,

447
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,120
we need to circle back to the most fascinating part

448
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,120
of this whole thing.

449
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,500
Deus Ex Human Revolution

450
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,800
recreated an exact problem

451
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,840
the original game almost had

452
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,300
and then fixed during development.

453
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,420
I think we need to explore how something like that

454
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,680
can happen, right?

455
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,940
♪♪

456
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,860
So the development of Human Revolution

457
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,680
was a bit of a mess.

458
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,640
I mean, first off, this was a new studio

459
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,060
making their first game.

460
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,600
You can't just snap your fingers

461
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,860
and open a new 350-person development studio overnight.

462
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,700
You have to build that, you know?

463
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,320
And in this case, literally.

464
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,480
When the studio opened, the building they planned

465
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,200
to make their offices wasn't even finished being built.

466
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,040
These guys left everything to come to a brand new studio

467
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,700
with not even permanent offices yet.

468
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,700
Building a new studio can't be easy.

469
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,880
Now, you're clever, so you're probably wondering

470
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,920
why so many game companies open studios in Montreal.

471
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,760
I'm sure French-Canadians make for excellent game designers,

472
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,880
but the answer is money.

473
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,420
Here's the annual cost of hiring

474
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,180
a video game programmer in various major cities.

475
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,840
San Francisco, $119,404.

476
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,060
Austin, where Deus Ex was developed, $91,161.

477
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,140
Vancouver, $78,500.

478
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,360
Toronto's almost at $78,000.

479
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,480
They're getting there. Montreal, $72,335.

480
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,260
Montreal with government tax credit, $45,209.

481
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,920
Up to 37.5% of the cost of your employees' salaries

482
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,720
are effectively given back to you by the province.

483
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,640
Look, all I'm saying is I can telepathically predict

484
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,800
where companies will open their next game studio.

485
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,180
Don't believe me? It's all in the numbers.

486
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,560
What, were EIDA supposed to open

487
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,240
a new studio in Texas again?

488
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,560
The biggest game studio headquartered in Texas now

489
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,740
is, I think, Gearbox, right?

490
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,080
And guess where they're opening their new studio?

491
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,920
Come to work at Gearbox Quebec.

492
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,920
They don't pay very well,

493
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,880
but they promise really good bonuses.

494
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,180
I mean, they promise them.

495
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,300
EIDAS Montreal also had to deal with the fact

496
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,680
that they're the Canadian branch

497
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,760
of a company that doesn't exist.

498
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,760
They got acquired by another company

499
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,140
while they were trying to make their first game.

500
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,780
That's got to make the development process

501
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,240
a little more complicated.

502
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,900
It's, uh, it's, uh, two years or more of development.

503
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,160
You never know how it's gonna turn out.

504
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,320
It's easy to see why some aspects

505
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,000
of the process got misplaced.

506
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,760
Okay, I don't want to make any more excuses

507
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,760
for the developers.

508
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,000
It's starting to feel a bit condescending.

509
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,760
Let's talk about some of the choices

510
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,500
the developers made about how to design this game.

511
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,060
In a hugely informative Game Developers Conference talk

512
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,760
about the development of Human Revolution,

513
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,760
gameplay director Francois Lapikus,

514
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,260
sorry if I'm pronouncing that wrong,

515
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,520
my Quebecois, Quebeci, Quebeci?

516
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,180
My Canadian French isn't great,

517
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,480
says during pre-production,

518
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,520
the team planned the entire game

519
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,240
and all of its features and mechanics in advance

520
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,560
and then stuck to that plan throughout development,

521
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,260
executing all of it with very few changes.

522
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,960
Uh, we did not redo systems.

523
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,260
Uh, we did not rethink the game.

524
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,020
We just went full speed ahead.

525
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,260
We knew exactly what we wanted this game to be,

526
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,100
what we wanted the player to feel.

527
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,940
Having a plan makes sense,

528
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,940
but traditionally in game development,

529
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,820
plans change over time as you see your game ideas in action

530
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,600
and iterate and make changes.

531
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,440
Human Revolution's main design team

532
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,660
wrote all their initial ideas on huge sheets of paper

533
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,520
and then stuck them to the walls

534
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,220
and followed them religiously.

535
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,020
Everything I've shown you so far,

536
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,140
we put on huge sheets of paper

537
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,320
which we papered the walls over with.

538
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,240
Before they'd actually made the game,

539
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,280
had a chance to see how it felt to play or test things out,

540
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,400
they'd already decided how almost everything

541
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,440
was going to be.

542
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,040
So by having it, uh, on walls,

543
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,000
every single morning when we came in,

544
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,240
we saw exactly what we needed to do.

545
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,540
They were so important in fact

546
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,000
that when we moved to our, uh, final offices,

547
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,380
it's the first thing we put up.

548
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,020
By the end, the team had made a game

549
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,680
that was absolutely brilliant...

550
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
on paper.

551
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,600
When I say Human Revolution feels like

552
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,560
the first few ideas a bunch of guys had

553
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,100
in a brainstorming session right at the start of development,

554
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,240
that's because it is the first few ideas

555
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,900
a bunch of guys had in a brainstorming session

556
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,320
right at the start of development.

557
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
Basically the whole game...

558
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
Ha ha ha.

559
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,480
Blueprint was a way for us

560
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,360
to chart the whole game in advance.

561
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,860
Just to show you this is, uh, half of the blueprint.

562
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,000
Basically the whole game had been planned out

563
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,860
on spreadsheets before they'd discovered,

564
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,220
you know, some of it is boring and time consuming,

565
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,980
and then they realized they'd forgotten

566
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,020
to plan half the stuff that needed to be there

567
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,100
and had to add major components to the game

568
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,280
at the last minute and everybody hated them.

569
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,940
Lapikus apologizes directly in his talk for the boss fights.

570
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,280
They were a big part of the game

571
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,080
and we should have put more efforts in them

572
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,900
so truly sorry about that.

573
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,460
While I was watching this talk,

574
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,880
I was beginning to write a joke in my notebook

575
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,960
like I guess no one wrote about the boss fights on the walls

576
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,260
but it turns out that actually happened.

577
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,720
Remember the directions sheets?

578
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,820
I was talking about at the beginning.

579
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,080
We didn't have one for boss fights.

580
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,660
We kind of forgot about it

581
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,040
because we didn't have these direction sheets.

582
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,080
We didn't really know what we were doing with boss fights.

583
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,300
Game development is a complicated process

584
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,040
where initial ideas you had in a vacuum months ago

585
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,340
might turn out not to work in practice.

586
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,600
Just as a comparison,

587
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,480
the team behind the original Deus Ex

588
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,560
threw away half of their design document

589
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,560
part way through.

590
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,560
We ended up with,

591
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
are you sitting down,

592
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,600
500 pages of documentation?

593
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,780
Yeah.

594
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,780
No one read it.

595
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,440
Um...

596
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,440
Warren Spector, the director of the first game,

597
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,520
is really open about how much rethinking

598
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,660
needed to be done to make the game what it is

599
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,460
even though they thought they knew everything

600
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,280
they needed at the end of pre-production.

601
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,620
The year Deus Ex came out,

602
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,580
he wrote a retrospective for Gamasutra

603
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,960
which incidentally changed its name to game developer

604
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,080
while I was writing this video which was confusing

605
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,300
and part of it covers just how much of their ideas

606
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,180
got thrown out or replaced.

607
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,760
That knowledge allowed us to go through

608
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,880
our 500-page design documents

609
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,920
and cut everything that was extraneous,

610
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,720
winnowing it down to a svelte 270 pages.

611
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,760
Less game, not at all.

612
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,680
What was left was the best 270 pages,

613
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,160
the stuff that worked.

614
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,440
We were open to change, be open to change.

615
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,020
Anybody who tells you that, you know,

616
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,800
when you get to the end of pre-production,

617
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,480
you've got a script and nothing changes

618
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,960
has never made a game, right?

619
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,300
Blueprint was a way for us

620
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,060
to chart the whole game in advance.

621
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,900
On the one hand,

622
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,560
you have a game that appears to have been designed

623
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,600
pretty intensively before they'd even made any of it

624
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,000
and on the other, you have a team months from release

625
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,840
who realize there's a problem and go,

626
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,120
wait, hold on a second.

627
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,440
Like me and Warren and Chris would sit in a room

628
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,720
and fight like cats and dogs.

629
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
It's just kind of weird

630
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,280
that you introduce some of these characters,

631
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,360
you interact with them a little bit

632
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,760
and then they're just gone.

633
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,320
He shows up in mission one, he shows up in mission two,

634
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,200
he shows up in mission four

635
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,360
and then you never hear from him again.

636
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,600
What happened to that guy?

637
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,960
And it was a powerful question

638
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,880
because it was one of the basics of storytelling

639
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,280
that we as video game designers weren't yet applying

640
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,560
and so we went back.

641
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,200
Now I'm sure I could wrap this point up here

642
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,040
in a neat little bow and say something like,

643
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,760
the real test of a creative work

644
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,600
isn't having a lot of good ideas.

645
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,480
It's understanding when you have to change them

646
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,400
to make them work, but then you have to ask,

647
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,200
why would anyone be so rigid about pre-production

648
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,320
and unwilling to rethink things like this?

649
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,400
Well, because they have to be.

650
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,240
Think about how much game development

651
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,120
has changed since the 90s.

652
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,600
If someone had a better idea about a mechanic

653
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,120
or wanted to rewrite the opening

654
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,760
or redo some dialogue or swap the first two levels,

655
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,160
it wasn't too much work,

656
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,120
and crucially, not that much work was wasted.

657
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,560
It's pretty easy to steer a canoe.

658
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,680
Larger ships, however, are notoriously difficult to steer

659
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,560
even when you see the problem in time.

660
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,080
You know, like in that movie.

661
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,600
Uh, Speed II?

662
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,000
Games are vastly more expensive to make now.

663
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,960
Need scores of programmers, artists, animators,

664
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,840
directors, producers, designers, writers.

665
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,520
Companies need organizational.

666
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,200
Wait, I have more. Production assistants,

667
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,360
general managers, composers, sound designers,

668
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,480
mo-cap artists, the entire second company

669
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,960
you farmed out the boss fights to,

670
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,320
not to mention voice actors you have to call back in

671
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,520
to do more work if you need to change anything big,

672
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,560
and incidentally, one of Human Revolution's

673
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,000
other really big problems exists completely

674
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,680
because they didn't want to have to call back a voice actor.

675
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,920
I never asked for this.

676
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,720
Things do need to be planned that much more in advance

677
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,200
and stuck to pretty strictly if all these folks

678
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,560
are gonna manage to come together

679
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,840
to produce something that works at all.

680
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,640
If someone on the team thought the opening

681
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,520
kind of sucked and needed some reworking

682
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,640
and I'm willing to bet several of them did,

683
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,640
what were they gonna do?

684
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,640
Cut out millions of dollars of work?

685
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,360
Remove all that content you made

686
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,800
and have to make even more?

687
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,360
Tell the higher-ups you blew a ton of time and money

688
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,360
and need more of it?

689
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,160
They had to fight all the way to the top

690
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,080
to get a fucking poster in here.

691
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,440
Do you think they're gonna get that far

692
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,200
asking them for the time to redo something this big?

693
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,080
Now, I'm not strictly saying they wanted

694
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,680
to fix the opening and couldn't.

695
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,120
There's no way of knowing for certain

696
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,960
unless someone who worked at IDES Montreal

697
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,640
wants to go on record. Please email me.

698
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,760
I'm just saying that in the AAA landscape

699
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,240
that has sprouted as gaming became

700
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,080
one of the biggest industries on the planet,

701
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,800
you have so much less room to change and improve

702
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,520
once you realize a guy disappears after mission four,

703
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,760
and guess what? A guy literally does disappear

704
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,760
after mission four.

705
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,960
We'll get to that later.

706
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,720
Human Revolution has many of the exact problems

707
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,040
the original Deus Ex team have described

708
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,200
their game having before they had the chance

709
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,720
to go back and fix it.

710
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,840
It just didn't get the polish and rethinking

711
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,320
that made Deus Ex 1 quite so special,

712
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,240
and this leads to much bigger problems

713
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,440
than a boring opening.

714
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,200
If you asked me what was the most important thing

715
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,360
about these games, and you're watching this video

716
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,160
so implicitly you are asking me,

717
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,280
I'd say it's giving the player agency,

718
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,920
giving them the freedom to make their own choices.

719
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,040
Most of Human Revolution's biggest issues

720
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,600

or past the gang that has occupied it,

730
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,800
there are hostages you can try to save,

731
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,360
and there's also a climactic standoff

732
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,960
with Zeke Sanders, the ringleader,

733
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,440
who has a hostage at gunpoint.

734
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,480
You can trigger a shootout where he kills the hostage

735
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,120
and then attacks you, but if you're quick enough,

736
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,560
you can take him out first and the hostage survives.

737
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,280
You can also just let him go.

738
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,720
This will cause the hostage to be killed

739
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,480
in the crossfire during his escape,

740
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,040

is this woman's husband.

If you saved both of them,

745
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,800
they feel indebted to you and tell you

746
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,680
to catch up with them later at their place.

747
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,840
You're a true hero, man.

I'll find some way to repay this, I swear.

749
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,320
If you do, they give you the address of an arms dealer

750
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,960
and get him to give you a discount.

751
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,880
This is a really neat little side story

752
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,760
that ties into the player's actions.

753
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,480
The discount isn't even that useful

754
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,000
for reasons we'll explore later,

755
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,440
and these characters don't do anything else afterwards,

756
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,040

than that for this to work.

758
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,480
I can never thank you enough for what you did.

759
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,760
The fun here comes from feeling briefly

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,320
that you're tangibly involved

763
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,880

When it comes to the main story,

767
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,760
the thing you're focusing on for most of the game,

768
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,600
the player has little to no freedom or control.

because once you reach the door,

777
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,280
you're forced to watch him immediately get seen

778
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,080
by the hacker and watch him get hacked

779
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,200

831
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,200
You can even see there's another way in,

832
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,680
but you can't get over this stuff to get behind him.

833
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,520
What's kind of insulting is they put an invisible wall here

834
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,560
so you can't climb over it when you can climb over

835

the stuff that's the same height right next to it.

836
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,920

837
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,640

838
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,600

839
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,560
this one way and trigger the cutscene.

Instead of giving you a reasonable amount of control,

841
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,440
the game makes increasingly awkward attempts

842
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,040
to make you feel like you're making more choices

843
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,240
than you actually are.

844
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,560
After the standoff, the cops have alternate lines

845
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,200

846
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,680
that happened at the factory.

If Sanders got away, if you killed him,

849
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,800
they all instantly know and have thoughts

in a way that starts to feel stilted and artificial

865
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,560
like they're breathing down your neck

866
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,320

870
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,880
Almost everyone at your job already has something to say.

00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,800
Apparently there wasn't much bloodshed thanks to you.

874
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,640
Pritchard has one of two dialogue lines

875
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,800
based on how many guys you killed at the plant.

876
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,200
Well, well, if it isn't Attila the Hun,

877
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,760
fresh from the killing fields.

878
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,280
But if you killed very few people, he says this.

879
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,560
Well, if it isn't Mahatma Gandhi himself.

882
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,520
accounting for the player's choices like this,

883
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,800
but this one line is all that changes.

884
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,840
In fact, even if you haven't killed anyone in the game yet,

885
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,520
his next line is still this.

886
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,600
Stick to kicking down doors and shooting people, Jensen,

887
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
and stop trying to do my job.

888
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,160
Someone wrote Pritchard to treat Jensen like a serial killer

889
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,240
then realized they should probably account

890
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,600
for the possibility the player hasn't killed anyone

891
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,920
and added precisely one alternative line

892
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,920
and moved on.

893
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,880
I get the desire to make your home base

894
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,160
feel like it's reacting to the player's choices.

895
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,960
It's a really good idea on paper

896
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,000
and you know those guys loved paper.

897
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,240
Ha ha, good one.

898
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,600
But if you execute it poorly,

899
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
it doesn't feel like characters reacting

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,200
to things another character did.

901
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,560
It feels like writers scrambling to find ways

902
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,400
to make you feel involved in a story.

903
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,800
Jensen, is it true Sanders acted surprised

904
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,800
when he heard about the hacker?

905
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,040
Uh, buddy, that just happened.

906
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,880
I just got back right now.

907
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,120
Who told you this? Did you read the script?

908
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,320
Luckily, this problem solves itself.

909
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,480
After the early levels,

910
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,760
the player has so little control over what happens

911
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,520
that NPCs run out of things to react to you doing.

912
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,640
Either that or even the writers realized

913
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,040
how weird it would be if the people

914
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,640
at your Detroit headquarters were like,

915
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,280
hey, Adam, way to steal that key card

916
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,440
from that brothel in China.

917
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,080
The game has another way of creating

918
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,320
the illusion of choice though.

919
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,600
Many sequences have dialogue choices.

920
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,200
These feel like choices because, well,

921
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,960
they are technically, but what the game doesn't tell you

922
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,920
is these choices do nothing.

923
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,880
So how's it feel being augmented?

924
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,880
Excuse me?

925
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,720
The main character Jensen interacts with

926
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,160
in the game is Farida Malik,

927
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,560
Sarif Industries pilot.

928
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,840
When you leave for the first level,

929
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,320
she asks how you feel about coming back into work.

930
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,680
When you get back to her afterwards,

931
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,640
she asks for your take on the events of the mission,

932
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,320
and as soon as you land, she asks you

933
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,120
how you feel about being augmented.

934
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,440
You get a lot of opportunities

935
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,960
to choose what to say to Malik.

936
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,200
Getting to make the choices is nice,

937
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,240
but none of this does anything.

938
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,280
Malik maybe gets annoyed in reply

939
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,520
to the thing you just said,

940
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,560
but it doesn't have any wider effect.

941
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,000
These choices aren't here to give you control

942
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,960
over a relationship with a character.

943
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,920
They're here to make you feel like

944
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,440
you have that kind of control.

945
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,440
The game just briefly pretends

946
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,000
to be Mass Effect sometimes,

947
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,160
but with hexagons instead of a wheel.

948
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,920
I think people should stop asking me so many questions.

949
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,400
Then about two minutes later,

950
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,800
the player is asked by someone else

951
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,480
how he feels about being augmented.

952
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,880
How do you handle all of this?

953
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,680
It's the pretend players are making choices trick

954
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,440
so nice they used it twice.

955
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,840
This time is special, though,

956
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,440
because he says the line.

957
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,080
♪ ♪

958
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,200
I never asked for this.

959
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,280
Yeah!

960
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,920
People were waiting with bated breath

961
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,080
to see if Adam says the line from the trailer.

962
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,480
I'm so glad they put it in there.

963
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,480
A bunch of other stuff in the trailers didn't.

964
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,000
Corporations have more power than the government.

965
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
That's the most political thing Adam Jensen says.

966
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,040
I want to play the game this was a trailer for.

967
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,040
Oh, sweet. It's the cursed trailer

968
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,200
version of this scene.

969
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,880
This face haunts my nightmares.

970
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,520
In many RPGs, how you talk to other characters

971
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,040
affects how they feel about you,

972
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,160
impacts the story, or comes back up in some way, you know?

973
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,120
What if I told you that at no point

974
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,920
do any dialogue choices you ever make

975
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,200
affect anything other than the character's

976
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,480
immediate reaction?

977
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,240
There's a part where you can optionally help her

978
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,360
unravel the death of one of her best friends

979
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,800
and catch the real killer.

980
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,240
What effect does this have on your relationship?

981
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,840
She goes, thanks,

982
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,800
and you never hear about it again.

983
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,240
What if, for example,

984
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,680
Adam could be a real piece of shit to his pilot

985
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,480
and she stopped being friendly with him

986
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,120
or didn't ask for his help later

987
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,240
or straight up refused to work with him

988
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,080
and he got assigned a worse pilot

989
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,600
who didn't make small talk for the rest of the game?

990
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,160
Instead, you get to pick angry, happy, or ambivalent,

991
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,040
and she goes, okay,

992
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,080
and the game continues like nothing happened.

993
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,840
Your pilot will still be your friend

994
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,240
and still ask for your help in a later side quest

995
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,920
no matter how you treat her.

996
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,920
Even when you technically have a choice,

997
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,920
it only accentuates how little control you're being given.

998
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,240
So what do you want me to do, boss?

999
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,520
Take the mission to break into a police station morgue

1000
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,960
and find the hacker's delicious brain chips.

1001
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,760
You get this mission via your boss

1002
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,680
literally ordering you to do it.

1003
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,160
Get over to the station and find a way inside.

1004
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,320
Contact me when you've gotten a hold of it.

1005
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,840
But this is a modern RPG with dialogue options,

1006
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,640
so you're given the option of saying,

1007
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,160
hey, you're ordering me to do a really big crime here, right?

1008
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,560
What you're asking me to do,

1009
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,560
it's not exactly legal.

1010
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,280
No, it isn't.

1011
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,600
You got a problem with that?

1012
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,960
You can make Adam say he's not happy about,

1013
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,080
you know, robbing a police station,

1014
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,120
but the response is, too bad.

1015
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,440
That's the game, idiot.

1016
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,720
Yes, but... but nothing.

1017
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,000
So get going.

1018
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,720
The creators wanted to do a mission

1019
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,640
where you have to get into a police station.

1020
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,080
That's fine, and you have a lot of options

1021
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,080
for how to do that,

1022
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,840
but games which use dialogue like this

1023
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,440
usually offer different outcomes

1024
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,000
for making different choices.

1025
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,080
If this was Mass Effect or Fallout,

1026
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,840
you could talk your boss into trying a different approach

1027
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,560
for getting the information he needs,

1028
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,560
or alternatively, you could just not offer

1029
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,840
the illusion of a choice.

1030
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,960
If Adam had just said of his own accord,

1031
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,120
I don't like it, but I see how it's the only option,

1032
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,280
and moved on, it wouldn't have been a problem.

1033
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,240
JC spoke for himself all the time.

1034
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,040
You're making the limits of the player's role

1035
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,720
in the story really obvious

1036
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,680
when their big choice in dialogue

1037
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,920
amounts to how willingly their character

1038
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,160
agrees to commit a crime.

1039
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,600
Adam Jensen is an ex-cop who doesn't play by the rules,

1040
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,400
whether he likes it or not.

1041
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,280
Instead of you getting to make the choices,

1042
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,040
there's another character in the story

1043
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,760
making them for you.

1044
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,480
Cutscene Jensen.

1045
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,640
At numerous points,

1046
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,040
Adam either does something very stupid

1047
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,240
without you having a choice

1048
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,480
because the plot demands it,

1049
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,720
or worse, he does something really cool

1050
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,760
it would have been fun to actually play.

1051
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,920
There's one sequence later

1052
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,680
where the player plants a bomb on a desk.

1053
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,320
Luckily, they built the desk with a large glowing spot

1054
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,480
for in case someone needs to plant a bomb.

1055
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,880
They do those at Ikea now.

1056
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,000
Now, this is a setup

1057
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,040
to a potentially thrilling gameplay sequence

1058
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,360
where the player has to escape the explosion in time

1059
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,360
or find cover and capitalize on the distraction

1060
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,640
caused by the explosion,

1061
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,320
but instead it cuts to a video of Jensen doing it.

This does look really fun and tense.

The cutscene continues for another, like,

1070
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,280
minute and a half as Jensen hides from the guards

1071
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,080
and then he decides to hide in a shipping container,

1072
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,200
finds a cryogenic pod in the shipping container,

1073
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,800
and then decides to just climb into it for some reason.

1074

This is how you find out this pod exists, by the way.

1075
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,920
He just finds it and gets in it,

1076
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,000
and then he wakes up on a secret base a few days later.

1077

00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,240
to trigger that explosion

1080
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,280
and then get into the pod themselves?

1081
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,960
Like, that could have been a really fun mission.

1082
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,600
We just got to watch our guy have fun.

1083
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,040
Like, what?

1084
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,680
A pretty standard rule of games is that if something cool

1085
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,760
happens in the story, the player should get to do it.

1086
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,720
Warren Spector, the director of Deus Ex,

1087
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,400
did a post-mortem on the game at GDC a few years back

1088
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,400
and somewhat jokingly listed the ten commandments he had

1089
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,640
when he was developing the game,

1090
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,520
and one of them was to let players do the cool stuff.

1091
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,240
If something is cool,

1092
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,960
don't even think about letting an NPC do it.

1093
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,440
Players do the cool stuff.

1094
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,200
NPCs watch the player do the cool stuff.

1095
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,280
I like to describe the first Deus Ex

1096
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,360
as surprisingly linear.

1097
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,200
Since the player is always the one

1098
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,600
doing the important things with no cut scenes

1099
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,960
doing it for them, you always feel like the driving force

1100
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,160
of the story even though technically you're just

1101
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,040
completing an objective someone gave you.

1102
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,240
So when all the most pivotal moments in the game

1103
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,200
consist of Adam doing the cool stuff while you watch,

1104
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,240
which occasionally pauses to ask you

1105
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,880
if you'd like to do something else

1106
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,400
before forcing you anyway,

1107
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,680
you start to feel like a non-player character.

1108
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,520
In the game that you're playing,

1109
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,320
some of Human Revolution's potentially

1110
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,200
best playable moments take the form

1111
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,920
of heavily compressed 720p video files.

1112
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,320
After making his way to the CEO of the corporation

1113
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,960
that might have murdered his co-workers and loved ones,

1114
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,960
a cut scene plays where she tries to shoot him

1115
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,960
and he disarms her.

1116
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,960
Then there's some back and forth,

1117
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,520
and a few seconds later, he turns his back on her

1118
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,280
and gives her the opportunity to trick him

1119
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,400
and lock him out of the room

1120
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,120
and send, like, 12 guys after him.

1121
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,240
Men never fail to underestimate women.

1122
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,400
Oh-ho-ho-ho! Gender!

1123
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,040
You spend hours getting to the executive suite

1124
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,080
of this corporation.

1125
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,560
You put in all this work,

1126
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,240
and then cut scene Jensen just...oops.

1127
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,000
Situations where the player has no chance to react,

1128
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
uh, in the Deus Ex world are bad.

1129
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,520
Shit!

1130
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,840
You can't have contrived developments like this

1131
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,080
without seriously affecting the player's sense

1132
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,040
they have any say in the story.

1133
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,920
This segment is especially easy to recognize as a problem

1134
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,800
because it has a beat-for-beat equivalent in Deus Ex 1,

1135
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,360
meaning we can directly compare the two.

1136
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,880
When JC Denton goes after his game's female CEO

1137
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,800
of a large Chinese biotech corporation

1138
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,040
which seems to be part of the conspiracy,

1139
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,720
wow, they just copied that, didn't they?

1140
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,080
The character welcomes you in

1141
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,160
and tells you a fairly compelling story

1142
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,680
about being friends with your brother

1143
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,320
and which faction is responsible for the current problems.

1144
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,520
You have to figure out what to do next

1145
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,560
with that information.

1146
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,600
If you believe her and follow her objective,

1147
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,720
she goes into hiding and the job she gives you

1148
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,200
turns out to be basically a trap to kill you.

1149
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,520
Yeah, breaking into a Hong Kong police station

1150
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,680
looking for evidence they supposedly covered up.

1151
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,840
That's not a recipe for getting exploded.

1152
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,960
The player gets to actively decide whether to trust her.

1153
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,120
If they did, they have to have a lightsaber fight with her

1154
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,840
when they run into her again because this game is so cool.

1155
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,320
And she died.

1156
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,840
Ah!

1157
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,920
Or they can snoop around some more in her apartment

1158
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,400
and find the entire secret base in her home.

1159
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,840
Or they can just, like, shoot her, like, right away

1160
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,280
or snipe her from another building

1161
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,360
without ever talking to her.

1162
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,880
Throw a bomb through her window.

1163
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,200
I just want to observe for a second

1164
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,680
that in the original Deus Ex,

1165
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,000
breaking into a police station is a trap

1166
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,080
to try to kill you that was meant to sound

1167
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,480
so ridiculous you realize you're being tricked

1168
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,200
and choose to do something else,

1169
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,160
but in Human Revolution, it's the only option you have

1170
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,400
to progress the story and you cannot say no.

1171
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,040
Players being able to make choices

1172
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,200
and express themselves would get in the way

1173
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,960
of the amazing movie the creators

1174
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,000
wished they were making.

1175
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,680
Spoilers, they want this character

1176
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,120
to be the final boss,

1177
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,840
so you have no choice but to sit and watch Adam

1178
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,760
delay the plot by ten more hours.

1179
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,800
This problem bleeds into the gameplay.

1180
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,520
While there's often a degree of choice

1181
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,720
in how you solve problems,

1182
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,040
the consequences of your choices are meaningless

1183
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,400
because the story wasn't designed to account for them.

1184
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,840
You can recover the neural hub from the police station

1185
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,360
by, well, annihilating it.

1186
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,400
You don't have to bother with talking your way in

1187
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,400
by absolving a cop of the guilt of the child he killed

1188
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,160
or sneaking in via the side entrance

1189
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,520
or the roof or the sewers.

1190
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,560
You can also go in guns blazing.

1191
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,480
Make a real hog roast of a building

1192
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,520
full of human beings and the cops interrogating them too.

1193
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,400
This is a refreshing New Vegas-esque level

1194
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,280
of freedom to be given in how to deal with a situation.

1195
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,320
100% coolest level in the game in terms of player freedom.

1196
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,200
I mean, look how many cops you can kill.

1197
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,000
How could it possibly be a bad level?

1198
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
You'll see!

1199
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
♪ ♪

1200
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,800
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1201
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,600
This fucking clown car office.

1202
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,000
What the fuck is this?

1203
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,160
What, were they guarding this vent?

1204
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,040
The problem with this level is the effect

1205
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,040
these choices have or rather should have.

1206
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,960
Like, this would be a big deal, right?

1207
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,200
We were just caught on camera killing a lot of people.

1208
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,200
This is one of the top ten mass shootings

1209
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,920
in America this week.

1210
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,560
Our face should be on the news.

1211
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,640
We'd be a wanted man.

1212
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,560
Sarif Industries would have to fire us

1213
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,360
and issue a public apology for giving us both the arms

1214
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,160
and the arms to do it with.

1215
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,480
The debate on if augmentations should be legal

1216
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,480
would shift a bit.

1217
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,520
I'm not an expert on video game storytelling

1218
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,980
but something should happen as a result of this, right?

1219
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,440
Boss, I got the neural hub.

1220
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,740
What happens is nothing.

1221
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,860
Everything's fine.

1222
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,520
This never comes up.

1223
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,320
You come back to Detroit later in the game

1224
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,940
and there's no wanted posters.

1225
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,200
The cops are friendly. Nothing has happened.

1226
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,800
But then what if you learned to like the taste of bacon

1227
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,800
and keep going?

1228
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,000
What if you continue to fight cops in the street,

1229
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,420
blow up their mechs, snipe them, explode them,

1230
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,040
just fucking go to town on an entire police force?

1231
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,620
You want to know what happens then?

1232
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,120
When you get done with a quest in a convention center,

1233
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,760
on your way out, a cop approaches you

1234
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,540
with a side quest to help the police.

1235
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,920
Adam, I need you to trust me on this.

1236
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,660
You've got to help me find Jacob.

1237
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,300
They need help stopping a terrorist who hates cops.

1238
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,000
No, they're talking about someone else.

1239
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,060
You get offered this quest

1240
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,560
when you leave the convention center

1241
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,260
even if you have killed every cop

1242
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,060
you've ever seen so far in the game.

1243
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,480
They're really short-staffed because of the riots

1244
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,940
which is why they need outside help from an ex-cop.

1245
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,700
The fact Adam is a big reason why they're short-staffed

1246
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,440
doesn't cost him the job apparently.

1247
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,900
Just think about that.

1248
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,240
You can do an actual mass murder

1249
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,360
and get deputized by the survivors

1250
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,580
to catch a psychopath with a fraction of your body count.

1251
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,080
The game feels almost embarrassed about it too

1252
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,380
since accounting for how each player dealt

1253
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,920
with the police station would have required a lot of work.

1254
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,640
On your second visit to Detroit,

1255
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,420
the police station is completely closed

1256
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,720
and you can't even go in.

1257
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,300
There's no two ways around it.

1258
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,560
This is cheating.

1259
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,520
They're dodging the responsibility

1260
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,260
of doing anything with the choices they gave the player.

1261
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,320
The best you get is if you do tenderize

1262
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,900
the Gammon Warehouse, a newspaper in the next level

1263
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,660
says, massacre at police station or something.

1264
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,520
This newspaper is so easy to miss,

1265
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,080
I didn't get any footage of it during this playthrough.

1266
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,000
So if you blink, you miss the consequences

1267
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,900
of going to war with the Detroit PD.

1268
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,960
The effects of your choices fade away once you make them.

1269
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,840
Look, nature is healing.

1270
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,000
The cops are right back patrolling the streets

1271
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,540
I killed their buddies in.

1272
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,920
You see those guns on the ground?

1273
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,420
Those are the guns the guys I killed on my way in

1274
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,840
dropped when I murdered them.

1275
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,380
The game treats the player's choices

1276
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,480
about violence extremely weirdly,

1277
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,300
forgiving you for even the most extreme acts of terror...

1278
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,940
-...but also making sure

1279
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,180
you can't play the game truly peacefully either.

1280
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,880
I mean, let me just read you one of the game's achievements.

1281
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,600
Ahem, pacifist.

1282
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,800
Complete Deus Ex Human Revolution

1283
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,680
without anyone dying by your hand.

1284
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,320
Boss fights do not count.

1285
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:29,220
-♪♪

1286
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:34,220

1287
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:39,220

1288

1294
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,520
Now, it might just be me,

1295
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,520
but the standards for pacifism have really sli...

1296
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,020
Wait, that guy's still alive. Get him!

1297
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,020
-♪♪

1298
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,020
It's important to stress here that Deus Ex

1299
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,200
never did anything like this.

1300
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,400
Technically speaking, it only had cut scenes

1301
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,660
when you got into a plane

1302
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,320
and were traveling to the next level

1303
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,780
and I guess the endings too.

1304
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,280
Everything else was either gameplay or dialogue.

1305
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,660
At no point does JC Denton do something of his own accord.

1306
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,000
He's the player's avatar.

1307
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,280
He's meant to be an expression of your choices.

1308
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,160
Meanwhile, no matter how peaceful

1309
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,700
you make Adam Jensen behave,

1310
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,380
there's still going to be a cut scene

1311
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,400
where he tries to shoot a woman in the chest.

1312
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,780
-♪♪

1313
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,780
Pacifist.

1314
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,040
There's a bit of a disconnect here

1315
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,740
in terms of how much control the player has

1316
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,740
is what I'm saying.

1317
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:51,740
It's always insulting

1318
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:52,920
to not have a choice in something

1319
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,340
or be congratulated for not doing something

1320
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,080
that you literally have to do,

1321
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,220
but what's even worse is when a game tells you

1322
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,800
you're going to be given a choice

1323
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,260
and then just forgets.

1324
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,060
There's one incredibly strange part

1325
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,060
where the second boss character, Rihanna,

1326
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:07,520
is heavily injured from the fight

1327
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,520
and Jensen is asked if he will help her.

1328
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,540
-"Her life signs are fading.

1329
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:14,540
Will you save her?"

1330
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:15,660
-"I'll think about it."

1331
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,760
But then she just quietly dies

1332
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,000
and is a corpse once the cut scene is over.

1333
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,300
There is a dog barking.

1334
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,100
Apparently in an early draft of the game,

1335
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,260
the player got to decide if they killed bosses

1336
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,680
after defeating them and then they decided not to

1337
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,440
or weren't able to add this mechanic for whatever reason.

1338
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,320
-"The script kind of implies that she's not dead yet

1339
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,020
and are you going to save her?

1340
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:41,120
Initially, we had wanted to have the, um,

1341
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:45,160
the final blow for the bosses was up to the player

1342
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,540
to decide whether he was going to do it or not

1343
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:48,660
and when the cut scene's over,

1344
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,200
the player could end up, uh, killing her,

1345
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,160
but in truth, we kind of lost that

1346
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,800
in the process of our production

1347
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,580
and we never did change the lines."

1348
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:00,180
After the next boss fight, the guy's like,

1349
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,300
ugh, finish it because he's a badass.

1350
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,260
That's his character, right?

1351
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,720
And Jensen's like, not until you tell me

1352
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,340
what I need to know and then he dies anyway

1353
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:07,580
like a second later.

1354
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:10,080
You can smell the point in the cut scene

1355
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,080
where a moral choice would have gone

1356
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,340
and then, well, they kind of lost that

1357
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,460
in the process of their production.

1358
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:19,260
I think that's a diplomatic way of saying

1359
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,640
they didn't finish the game.

1360
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,600
This lack of control over the story

1361
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,680
to the extent players are being told

1362
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,400
they're going to get some choices

1363
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,900
which they are then not given

1364
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,780
makes the story start to feel flat

1365
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,980
and like you're not really taking part in it.

1366
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,780
Now to be clear, the game isn't completely devoid

1367
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,440
of branching story choices.

1368
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,480
At one point near the end, you get shot down

1369
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,140
and if you don't kill a couple guys,

1370
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,320
the pilot is killed.

1371
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,180
It's intended as a reference to the original

1372
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:45,900
where your pilot can also die,

1373
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,740
but in Deus Ex, it's an excuse

1374
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,900
for investigation and subterfuge.

1375
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,120
You have to find the corpse of a mechanic

1376
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,540
and wonder what's up with that.

1377
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:56,120
Notice the weird guy also dressed as a mechanic?

1378
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,460
I fixed her right up for you.

1379
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,380
And kill him or report him to his boss.

1380
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,880
That mechanic was an imposter.

1381
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,840
Oh, my God, JC, a bomb.

1382
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,840
A bomb.

1383
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:05,780
You can completely miss all of this

1384
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:06,980
if you're not paying attention,

1385
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:08,160
and if you do miss it,

1386
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,540
hours and hours later on the last level,

1387
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,320
your pilot's copter explodes

1388
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,920
and you don't really know why.

1389
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,200
This is part of the subtle beauty of the original.

1390
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,460
The game doesn't make it clear

1391
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,460
how much control you have sometimes,

1392
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:20,760
so when this happens,

1393
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,960
you get to wonder if you could have saved him.

1394
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,460
There's tons of minor ways the story can change

1395
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,380
that some players don't even know about

1396
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,980
and only find out about on forums years later.

1397
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,480
This isn't quite as special

1398
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,020
when it's shoot all of these guys

1399
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,360
or your pilot dies now.

1400
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,780
Also, the way the game accounts

1401
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,120
for her death just sucks.

1402
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,540
If you save her, she later heroically flies in

1403
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,540
to knock out some guys

1404
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,200
and save the scientists you rescued,

1405
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,000
but if she dies, obviously this means

1406
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
she doesn't turn up,

1407
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,880
so there's some serious story implications

1408
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,220
for the survival of these scientists.

1409
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,180
Just kidding, an aircraft is on the landing pad now

1410
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,180
for no reason, and they fly it out.

1411
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,180
What?

1412
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,920
They could have made Farida Malek's death

1413
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,340
have interesting consequences,

1414
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,140
and they just don't.

1415
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,340
They just don't.

1416
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,640
There is one really good story choice

1417
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,640
in the game, though.

1418
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,520
See you soon, Mr. Jensen.

1419
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,180
Ooh.

1420
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,360
Partway through, you start having minor glitches,

1421
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,940
and it becomes clear it's affecting

1422
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:11,440
other augmented people too.

1423
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,020
You all have them at once even.

1424
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,020
Ooh.

1425
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,020
I like how it's done too,

1426
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,060
these minor mutual freak outs

1427
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:20,280
where everyone gets injured and confused.

1428
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,320
This is some pretty neat storytelling actually.

1429
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,780
Uh, well, it's still pretty good.

1430
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,280
Anyway, you get a side objective

1431
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,540
to replace the defective chip causing this.

1432
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:30,120
If you go to a clinic, the game goes,

1433
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,460
are you sure you want to do this?

1434
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,900
As if to say, hey, you're making a big choice here,

1435
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,660
and for once, you are.

1436
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:37,740
If you get the replacement then in a later level

1437
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,740
before a boss fight,

1438
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,280
the lady from before flips a switch

1439
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,320
and you have to fight the boss

1440
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,740
with your screen all fuzzy.

1441
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:45,120
Wow, my choices affected the story.

1442
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,960
If you think this is the smartest thing in the game,

1443
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,660
I'm very sorry to tell you that you are correct.

1444
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,300
It is. There's another little way

1445
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,040
the plot can kind of branch actually.

1446
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,720
If you wait around at your HQ

1447
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,180
before going to their first mission,

1448
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,300
your boss yells at you to get to the helipad.

1449
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,800
Helipad. And eventually,

1450
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:02,240
the hostages you could have saved

1451
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,440
in that mission are dead before you get there.

1452
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,360
Christ, Adam, while you were strolling around

1453
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,620
the offices, the situation got worse.

1454
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:09,900
Wait a second, though.

1455
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,400
The game just dropped me in a new level

1456
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,820
full of people to talk to

1457
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,920
and then yelled at me to ignore all of it

1458
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,920
to get to the mission as fast as I can?

1459
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,620
Yeah, I really have the sense that time

1460
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,620
is of the essence in human revolution.

1461
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,620
Oh my God.

1462
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,080
Did you ever think about how, like,

1463
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,500
the myth of Icarus is about transhumanism?

1464
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,120
Like, with the wings?

1465
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,540
No, I didn't.

1466
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:33,800
A-Adam, that's... that's really stupid.

1467
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,180
You see? This is why we broke up.

1468
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,680
I still can't believe you don't like Ghost in the Shell.

1469
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,100
Oh my God, are you guys talking about Ghost in the Shell?

1470
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:44,220
That is one of the most important movies ever made.

1471
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,640
I mean, it's a good movie.

1472
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,640
It's a good movie.

1473
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,640
It's a good movie.

1474
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,640
It's a good movie.

1475
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,640
It's a good movie.

1476
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,640
It's a good movie.

1477
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,840
It's one of the best movies ever made.

1478
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,340
I cannot wait to see it.

1479
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:56,000
This is a game that just made you unskippably

1480
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,880
go on a walking tour of a floor of this building.

1481
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,840
They took their sweet fucking time.

1482
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:01,840
Why can't I?

1483
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,140
I mean, the guy's name is Bateau.

1484
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,260
The French word for boat.

1485
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,640
And he owns a boat?

1486
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,320
Ah, come on.

1487
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,820
We don't know he owns the boat.

1488
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,140
That's not in the wiki.

1489
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,280
This game does not get to say,

1490
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,560
hey, we're on the clock here

1491
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,280
after slapping you in the face with this opening.

1492
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,680
Fuck you if you think this is clever.

1493
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,060
Sorry. No, that's a joke.

1494
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:25,480
This is pretty clever,

1495
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,760
but for that to be one of the few times

1496
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,680
the story is affected by your choices

1497
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,980
is just insulting.

1498
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,600
I think the worst thing about all this

1499
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,480
is how promising it manages to be

1500
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,700
about its characters and choices at times.

1501
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,160
There's a blueprint in here for a fantastic story

1502
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,620
with all kinds of little choices like this one.

1503
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,900
The couple you can save at the manufacturing plant

1504
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,200
are a great example too,

1505
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,000
but I especially like the way Zeke Sanders is used.

1506
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,500
Not because the pre-rendered cutscene

1507
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,340
is just that cool and badass,

1508
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,460
but because eventually the cutscene ends

1509
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,720
and you get to be involved in the story.

1510
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,720
If you knock him out, he's in the police station

1511
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,560
talking about how he'll be out soon anyway

1512
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,020
because he has powerful friends.

1513
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,180
I won't be here long.

1514
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:03,880
If you killed him, he's in the morgue

1515
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,100
next to the guy whose neural hub you need.

1516
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,180
If you let him go, he later contacts you

1517
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,900
and gives you some information in return,

1518
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,760
like he feels like he owes you one.

1519
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,180
My debt is paid.

1520
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,600
It's really neat how different your relationship

1521
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:18,420
with this one guy can get based on what you did.

1522
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,600
Way later in the game, if he survived all this,

1523
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,720
he's a hostile NPC during the mission

1524
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,260
to go after a guy who, it turns out, surprise twist,

1525
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,520
is actually his brother, Sanders.

1526
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,720
Sanderses?

1527
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,400
Ezekiel's impact on the story

1528
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,060
is minimal after the first encounter.

1529
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,440
He could die right here

1530
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,360
so they can't make him too important,

1531
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,240
but he's what you really want to see

1532
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,360
from a game like this.

1533
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,400
Characters who react to your choices

1534
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,540
and feel like their own pieces of a larger world.

1535
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,360
I hate to say it, but very few other characters

1536
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,020
are as well thought out as this.

1537
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:49,560
Take his brother I just mentioned.

1538
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,740
Isaiah Sandoval is a high-ranking member

1539
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,980
of a different, non-terrorist-y

1540
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,620
anti-augmentation group.

1541
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:56,900
You meet him a few levels in

1542
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,000
and you can argue with him about augmentations,

1543
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,960
although none of it affects the story at all.

1544
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,320
It's just optional dialogue.

1545
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,000
Later, he shows up in a recording

1546
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,880
interacting with the guys who shot you

1547
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,300
and killed slash kidnapped your friends.

1548
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,300
I know this guy.

1549
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,420
When you get to Sandoval,

1550
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,220
he tells you what he knows then tries to shoot you,

1551
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,280
but if you found out his location

1552
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,020
by publicly implicating him in the conspiracy

1553
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,280
in front of his boss,

1554
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,860
his boss basically pins everything on him,

1555
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,540
so instead, once you get here,

1556
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:25,960
he's distraught and decides to kill himself

1557
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,420
as penance for his crimes,

1558
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,580
which he feels genuine guilt over.

1559
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,620
You get the chance to try to talk him down

1560
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,460
over the course of a deeply engaging conversation,

1561
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,960
and for a few minutes,

1562
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,000
everything about this game really works.

1563
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,420
Sandoval feels like a character with a real inner life

1564
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,540
who we have to speak to like a person,

1565
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:46,340
and we're only having this conversation

1566
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:48,000
in the first place because of the effects

1567
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,500
of another choice we made.

1568
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,180
This is a perfectly sculpted piece

1569
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:53,640
of a really good game.

1570
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,960
It's one of the reasons why this game

1571
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,300
is worth talking about because it's disheartening

1572
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,260
that the game is missing the rest of the pieces.

1573
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:02,060
Firstly, this character isn't someone

1574
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:04,020
you got to deal with in any particularly

1575
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,640
meaningful way beforehand.

1576
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:09,060
You met him once for five seconds half a game ago.

1577
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,860
Instead of being the culmination

1578
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,100
of a relationship between two characters,

1579
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:15,020
it's just a really resonant moment

1580
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,480
in the middle of a story that's become a bit of a mess

1581
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,520
which you had little to no say in,

1582
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,020
and worse, now the game is done with him,

1583
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:25,520
he instantly exits the story and is never seen again.

1584
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,820
Sandoval already told you everything you need to know

1585
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,820
in the cut scene before this standoff,

1586
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:32,740
so if you talk him down or if he kills himself

1587
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:35,160
or if you talk him down and then kill him for fun

1588
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,660
or if none of this happened and this room was just a fight...

1589
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:38,660
Ow.

1590
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,080
It doesn't change anything.

1591
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,940
The story is not affected in any way

1592
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,400
by any of these outcomes.

1593
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,680
This character's survival,

1594
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,680
especially considering you can convince him

1595
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,520
to turn on the other conspirators

1596
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,740
and come out with the truth,

1597
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:52,160
should have interesting plot implications.

1598
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,160
His death or survival should have had an impact

1599
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,360
on what sort of ending you get.

1600
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,360
Oh, God, don't get me started.

1601
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,280
But once you're done, he just sits there.

1602
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,960
His part in the story is completed now.

1603
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,160
You don't need to wait with me, Mr. Jensen.

1604
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,740
I will not resist my fate when it arrives.

1605
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:06,740
Yeah, get out of here.

1606
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,780
I need to sit here for a week

1607
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:09,780
so I don't have a chance

1608
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,620
to introduce consequences to the plot.

1609
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,320
It's just kind of weird that you introduce

1610
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,780
some of these characters, you interact with them

1611
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:17,280
a little bit, and then you never hear from him again.

1612
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,400
What happened to that guy?

1613
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,940
It's so easy to imagine how much better

1614
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,780
the game could have handled its characters and choices.

1615
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:26,540
Like, what if your attitude towards augmentations

1616
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:29,360
in the previous meeting affected how Sandoval treated you

1617
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,360
once you found him?

1618
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,860
Like, if you seemed amenable

1619
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,660
to anti-augmentation arguments,

1620
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,660
he saw you as a potential friend here

1621
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:37,480
and trusted you with the information

1622
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,600
because he figured you'd do the right thing with it?

1623
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,560
What if, just a thought, how you treated his brother

1624
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,560
the last three times you ran into him

1625
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,180
affected his feelings about you?

1626
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:49,100
The fact you literally shot his brother to death

1627
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:52,060
or let him go during an armed standoff

1628
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,020
somehow never comes up.

1629
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,720
What if turning him against his boss

1630
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,280
had some really cool or meaningful consequence

1631
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,680
so the player feels like they really did something?

1632
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,600
Like, I'm not saying the story has to branch

1633
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,100
in some huge way, but do something.

1634
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,320
Maybe he gives you the key to his gun cabinet

1635
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,700
and it's full of weapon upgrades

1636
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,580
or those grenades he apparently had on him.

1637
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,160
Literally the only difference

1638
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,480
is a newspaper says something different

1639
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,480
and I guess you get more experience points

1640
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,700
for talking him down.

1641
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,780
This is especially weird because Deus Ex had a knack

1642
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:23,440
for remembering things you did and having them come up later.

1643
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,240
The first level of this game also had a hostage to save,

1644
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,660
one of many direct parallels between the games,

1645
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:30,660
and whether you bothered to save him or not

1646
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:33,240
affects how he feels about you for the rest of the game.

1647
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,160
I have seen that he knows the procedure

1648
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,580
of a good offensive.

1649
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:38,660
I will not forget a favor.

1650
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:40,340
Even when he becomes a boss fight,

1651
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:42,620
he'll still have a grudging respect for you.

1652
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:45,620
I regret that only once we worked together.

1653
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:47,500
You came all the way to Paris to tell me that?

1654
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,300
You can walk in on a guy asking a doctor

1655
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,920
for maintenance advice and learn he has

1656
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,420
the same augmentations as you.

1657
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:55,340
The fact you did this comes up 20 hours later

1658
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:56,340
when you fight him.

1659
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:58,300
If you recall our chat in the break room

1660
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,840
at UNATCO, you know that I have

1661
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,500
the same augmentation technology as you.

1662
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,260
Then this will be a good fight.

1663
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,180
All I'm saying is it would have been nice

1664
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,400
if Sandoval acknowledged something as important

1665
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,640
as whether I killed his brother or not.

1666
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,240
That's not too much to ask, is it?

1667
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,980
This whole cutscene, I was waiting for him

1668
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,940
to say something, but no.

1669
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:20,060
The game cares so little for how this scene works out

1670
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:22,820
that no matter what happens, one second later,

1671
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:24,940
Adam makes an identical phone call.

1672
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,320
I see you!

1673
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,740
Richard, get this.

1674
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,540
The GPLs are still transmitting.

1675
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,540
Sandoval switched them to a lower frequency.

1676
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,040
Take the gun.

1677
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,040
You win.

1678
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,460
Richard, get this.

1679
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:38,460
Forgive me.

1680
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,180
-$%&!

1681
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,500
Richard, get this.

1682
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,840
Hey, Richard, a guy just killed himself

1683
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,420
right in front of me. Anyway, check this out.

1684
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:47,180
Couldn't you at least have got a few different takes?

1685
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:50,020
Oh, Sandoval, you could have been so cool,

1686
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:52,860
but once I leave this room, you cease to exist.

1687
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:55,600
Good night, sweet prince, and may flights of angels.

1688
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,100
Oh, that actually kill. Oh, Jesus.

1689
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,100
Getting to make more choices like this

1690
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,400
would have vastly improved the experience.

1691
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,320
I hate that we didn't get a game

1692
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,940
full of stuff like Zeke Sanders,

1693
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,840
but after a few hours, it becomes clear

1694
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,500
the player is less of a participant

1695
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,420
and more a chauffeur, transporting cutscene Jensen

1696
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:13,960
between opportunities to trip over his own dick.

1697
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,140
Women never fail to underestimate men.

1698
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:17,800
Oh, ho, ho, ho! Gender!

1699
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,900
This is how a cyberpunk game

1700
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:23,360
about our transhumanist future addresses gender.

1701
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:27,480
Men do be shopping for augmentations.

1702
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,560
As the story makes it increasingly clear

1703
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,560
the person playing it is only tangentially involved,

1704
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,520
people stop paying attention.

1705
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,240
You don't have any say in what's happening,

1706
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,520
so what's the point?

1707
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,520
That's cutscene Jensen's problem.

1708
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,160
The problem the player has to deal with

1709
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,580
is the sweeping and often misguided changes

1710
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,120
to the original's gameplay.

1711
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:53,120
♪♪

1712
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,540
Watch it. This one's some...

1713
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,960
Deus Ex is a tremendously important game

1714
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,460
in the history of the medium,

1715
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:02,380
one of, if not the best of all time.

1716
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,140
Hold on, let me... there we go.

1717
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,220
Many designers on all types of games

1718
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:08,960
cite it as a direct inspiration for their own work,

1719
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,920
but it's been over 20 years now.

1720
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,300
Is Deus Ex really as good as everyone remembe...

1721
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,440
Yes, yes it is. Shut the fuck up.

1722
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,220
There's a good reason why there's a decades-old in-joke

1723
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:21,060
that every time you mention it, someone will reinstall it.

1724
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:24,060
In-jokes are what people call memes when they're funny.

1725
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,860
It's the ultimate example of a game

1726
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:27,980
that's more than the sum of its parts.

1727
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:29,480
That phrase gets thrown around a lot

1728
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,660
by game critics trying to punch up their reviews

1729
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:33,940
with fancy words, but this is the rare time

1730
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,340
when it's actually true.

1731
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:37,220
In post-mortems and retrospectives,

1732
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:39,180
Warren Spector is delightfully open

1733
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:41,460
about how right down to the wire,

1734
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:44,460
mere months from release, the game just wasn't fun.

1735
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:47,520
By September 1999, we were done.

1736
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,840
Except we weren't.

1737
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,400
The game was not good enough.

1738
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,300
It wasn't ready to ship.

1739
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,520
Deus Ex was made out of so many individual components

1740
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,600
that had to not just work well, but work well together,

1741
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:01,560
that it was a huge mess right up until it suddenly

1742
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,180
became a beautiful web of interlocking systems.

1743
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:06,180
So we had real people come in and play the game.

1744
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:07,860
I called that particular milestone

1745
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:11,100
the, wow, these missions suck, milestone.

1746
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:13,780
Uh, we had a lot of work to do.

1747
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:16,700
This is why this game's formula is hard to recreate

1748
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,320
and even harder to improve on.

1749
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,160
So many moving parts have to work with each other.

1750
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:25,040
Even if a change sounds good or even is good in some contexts,

1751
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,000
since every change affects the way

1752
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,700
all the systems relate to each other,

1753
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:31,120
it can still result in a worse game.

1754
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:33,820
And immersive sims come together very late

1755
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:35,820
when all of your little game systems and rules

1756
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:37,780
are all working together magically

1757
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:40,120
to produce this amazing experience.

1758
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,780
The creators of Human Revolution

1759
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:44,780
made a lot of big changes to these core mechanics.

1760
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:46,700
Lapikus's talk contains a segment

1761
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,920
where he summarizes the Human Revolution team's

1762
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,960
collective criticisms of the original.

1763
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,800
I'm about to say some negative things

1764
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,760
about the best PC game of all times.

1765
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,220
Now see here, buddy!

1766
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:58,640
Okay, but seriously, it's really good

1767
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,640
to take an especially critical look at a game

1768
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,500
even if it's as beloved as the original.

1769
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,920
You know, if you seriously want to improve on Deus Ex,

1770
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,120
this is how you start.

1771
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,700
The issue is what they decided were problems

1772
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,420
and how they fixed them.

1773
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:12,040
The game was designed specifically

1774
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,000
for the PS3 and Xbox 360

1775
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,180
with a separate company entirely handling the PC port.

1776
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:19,680
The creators appear to be trying to streamline down

1777
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,220
the Deus experience for console players,

1778
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,840
removing many mechanics they feared wouldn't appeal

1779
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:27,440
to people who don't like complicated RPGs.

1780
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,140
Lapikus says they didn't dumb it down in his talk,

1781
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,140
but I think we get to be the judge of that.

1782
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:33,980
So obviously the first thing we should look at

1783
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:35,820
is the first thing that happens in the game,

1784
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:37,200
character creation.

1785
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,900
Not Human Revolution's character creation,

1786
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,580
of course, because, uh, there isn't any.

1787
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:43,820
["Dark Souls"-style music plays in the background.]

1788
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:45,580
In true RPG fashion,

1789
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:48,040
Deus Ex slaps you in the face with a spreadsheet

1790
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,660
before you can start playing.

1791
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:50,660
Ow, my brain!

1792
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:51,620
At least the default name

1793
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:52,880
isn't Non this time.

1794
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,380
Everyone calls you JC,

1795
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:56,080
but that's just the character's code name.

1796
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,300
You can enter a real name,

1797
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:59,220
and it comes up in a few places here and there.

1798
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:00,300
You Denton?

1799
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,300
Denton's an old code name

1800
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,500
from my UNATCO days,

1801
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:03,840
but it seems to have stuck.

1802
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,180
And even though it's a little clunky,

1803
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,300
it's always fun to be making meaningful choices

1804
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,480
as soon as you begin.

1805
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,140
There's no 45-minute openings

1806
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,860
and tutorials to get through first.

1807
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:13,480
The tutorial's actually a separate thing

1808
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,640
you can skip entirely,

1809
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,780
and for the year 2000,

1810
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:17,240
being able to choose your ethnicity

1811
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,240
was pretty cool.

1812
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,060
It was so nice to finally find a game

1813
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,660
that represented my skin type.

1814
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:23,660
Throughout the game, you acquired more skill points

1815
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:26,040
and could level up more at any time through the menu.

1816
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,360
It's a very rewarding system to engage with,

1817
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,520
but you know, it's a lot of looking at numbers,

1818
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,220
thinking, making fun decisions,

1819
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:34,760
you know, boring nerd stuff.

1820
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,260
In Lapicus's critical summary,

1821
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:39,600
he calls Deus Ex a heavy management kind of game.

1822
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:40,980
Oh, no, what if the gamers

1823
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:42,600
see a character creation screen?

1824
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,600
They might instantly decide the game is bad

1825
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,100
and go back to Gears of War.

1826
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,200
We better make it simpler just in case.

1827
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,980
So character creation is out,

1828
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:51,480
but the team were actually very smart

1829
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,940
about how they went about this.

1830
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:54,400
They still realized the importance

1831
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,440
of getting to make choices about the character

1832
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:58,660
and that sense of growth and development,

1833
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:01,000
and they found a way to make that still happen

1834
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,200
because in the first game, you were also developing

1835
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,840
in a much more engaging way at the same time.

1836
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,300
Throughout the world, you were finding

1837
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:08,720
augmentation canisters,

1838
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,720
which provided special, unique upgrades

1839
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,500
to the player's abilities on a completely separate screen

1840
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,720
from the skill point one.

1841
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,260
So the team made a pretty clever

1842
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,180
streamlining decision and combined

1843
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:20,060
these two systems into one.

1844
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:22,600
Now you do all your upgrading on one menu,

1845
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,100
and instead of acquiring, managing,

1846
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,600
and spending thousands of points,

1847
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,900
you get upgrades by spending praxis points,

1848
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,260
which are either found in the world

1849
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:31,800
or given to you every time you gain enough experience.

1850
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,140
If your goal is to simplify character progression,

1851
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:36,300
this is a really obvious and smart choice.

1852
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,520
It's less complicated and more direct.

1853
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:39,940
You spend a point on a thing,

1854
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:41,680
and now you can do the thing.

1855
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,600
Whee. A lot of the more boring skills

1856
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:44,520
have been removed.

1857
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,140
Swimming? Get out of here.

1858
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:49,280
Adam doesn't do any swimming in the entire game.

1859
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,240
They streamlined the game so well,

1860
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,940
there aren't even any streams,

1861
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:54,980
but overall, I'd say all of this is pretty good.

1862
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:57,280
Well, it's definitely simpler at least,

1863
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,120
but to simplify a mechanic means

1864
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,580
removing something from it,

1865
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:02,280
and that means you risk removing

1866
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,040
what made the thing you're simplifying

1867
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,740
fun in the first place.

1868
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:07,620
You can always improve on an old design,

1869
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:10,960
but sometimes it worked that way for a reason

1870
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,420
because here's the thing about augmentation canisters.

1871
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:15,380
You didn't just get to pick an augmentation

1872
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:16,460
when you found one.

1873
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:19,260
Each canister had two specific abilities in it,

1874
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,140
and you could only choose one of them.

1875
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:22,420
In any given playthrough,

1876
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:25,040
you only got up to half the abilities you could have.

1877
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,740
You were building a unique character

1878
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:28,160
who couldn't have everything.

1879
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,160
In Human Revolution,

1880
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,660
you're just picking them from a list,

1881
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:33,040
and you can get all of them if you have enough points.

1882
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,120
By the end of the game,

1883
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,380
everyone's JC Denton was a little bit different.

1884
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:40,100
Everyone's Adam Jensen is exactly the same.

1885
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:42,520
He just gets there in a slightly different order.

1886
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,220
I want to take a moment to appreciate

1887
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:46,100
the original game's augmentation system

1888
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:47,760
because while the experience point stuff

1889
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,140
was a turn-off to some people,

1890
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:51,180
the augs were a thing of beauty.

1891
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,620
You see, since each canister

1892
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:54,320
had only two augmentations in it

1893
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:55,660
and you could only choose one,

1894
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:58,920
the player was being given an extremely engaging choice.

1895
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:03,120
Hey, do you want to run faster or run silently?

1896
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,380
Because it's a choice between just two things,

1897
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:07,960
it's elegant and clear and hard to get anxious

1898
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,220
about which choice to make.

1899
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:11,760
You just have to decide which you want more.

1900
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,020
It's a binary choice.

1901
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:15,480
It's literally the simplest kind of choice there is.

1902
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,560
When you get a praxis point in Human Revolution,

1903
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,020
the game says, great,

1904
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:21,600
please pick one of 30 things to spend it on

1905
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,520
in a huge menu full of sub-menus,

1906
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,280
and by the way, you can't get half of them

1907
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,980
because you actually needed two points.

1908
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:28,480
For a huge portion of players,

1909
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,160
the very first experience with the augmentation system

1910
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,440
is finding the first point, opening a menu,

1911
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,540
and spending several minutes reading all the things

1912
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:37,540
they could do with it, realizing they need two

1913
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:38,540
to get anything good,

1914
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:40,240
and they have to close the menu down again

1915
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,280
and carry on playing until they find another.

1916
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,880
Worse, this extreme amount of things to choose from

1917
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,700
causes a kind of decision anxiety

1918
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,200
which never happened in the original

1919
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:49,800
with its much more simple choices.

1920
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,560
You know how tons of people play Human Revolution?

1921
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,140
They don't spend their points.

1922
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:55,760
They hoard them until they find a hole

1923
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,600
they need the slow-fall power to get down

1924
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,100
or a wall they want to punch

1925
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,980
or another thing that needs an augmentation

1926
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:03,520
to progress and spend the points right then and there,

1927
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,160
so you're not really building a character anymore.

1928
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,400
You're paying a toll once you hit a section

1929
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,980
that needs a certain skill.

1930
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:11,740
The design of the system is misleading

1931
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:13,200
about how complicated it is.

1932
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,280
This clip is of me spending 45 seconds

1933
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,000
looking for an augmentation I wanted.

1934
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,260
You know, the one that lets you take down

1935
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:20,380
two guys at once in physical combat

1936
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:21,920
using your arms?

1937
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,060
Where would that power be?

1938
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:25,680
The arm submenu?

1939
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,020
Correct, it should be there,

1940
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:29,760
but it's actually here in the back augmentations.

1941
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,980
It has a special submenu just to itself for no reason,

1942
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:34,180
and just to really fuck with you,

1943
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:36,020
the take down one person augmentation

1944
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:37,520
is in the arm submenu,

1945
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,600
and you start with this one already unlocked.

1946
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,740
Why is this here?

1947
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:42,020
What are you trying to do to me?

1948
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:43,020
Ow, my brain!

1949
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:44,700
Wait, and carrying capacities

1950
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:45,700
in the arm submenu,

1951
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:46,700
but you're not holding everything

1952
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:47,700
in your arms all day.

1953
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:48,700
You're carrying it.

1954
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:49,700
On your back!

1955
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:50,700
Put it on the back augmentation!

1956
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:52,240
So if the objective was to simplify

1957
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,240
character progression,

1958
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,860
I don't think they achieved it nearly

1959
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:55,860
as well as they'd hoped.

1960
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:58,360
In practice, or should I say in praxis,

1961
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,240
this system removes the best things

1962
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,660
about the system it's based on

1963
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:02,960
in the name of a simplicity

1964
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,620
that wasn't actually achieved.

1965
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,080
You also have to wait a while

1966
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,880
before you can do any character building whatsoever.

1967
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,420
The game tries to make sure you only get

1968
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:13,580
a second praxis after the standoff

1969
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:14,920
at the very end of the level,

1970
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:16,220
and this was done deliberately

1971
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:17,600
to hide another problem.

1972
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,520
The conversation enhancer augmentation

1973
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,060
costs two points and lets you make

1974
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:22,520
additional choices in dialogue

1975
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:24,520
based on the other character's soy levels.

1976
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:25,520
I'll kill you.

1977
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:26,860
It's nice to have more options,

1978
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:28,780
but it tells you which answer will work

1979
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:29,940
using colored lights,

1980
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:32,320
turning social engagement into Simon Says.

1981
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,400
In longer conversations,

1982
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,540
it vomits even more UI onto your screen,

1983
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:37,120
which disrupts the experience.

1984
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,280
The Sandoval sequence is much less tense

1985
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,420
with all this stuff everywhere

1986
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:41,540
telling you how to win.

1987
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:43,120
Anyway, if you play the first level

1988
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,800
in a really meticulous way,

1989
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,760
you can get two praxis points

1990
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,040
before meeting Sanders.

1991
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:50,220
If you spend them on the conversation enhancer,

1992
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:52,180
the game does a strange thing.

1993
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:54,520
It only throws up some of the stuff it's supposed to,

1994
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,680
and it doesn't give you any more dialogue options.

1995
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:59,180
You can't see his alpha, beta, or omega levels.

1996
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:00,440
Shit, he's a Sigma male.

1997
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:01,600
Jensen, get out of there!

1998
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,360
You see, in the original plan for the game,

1999
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,240
you weren't able to just open a menu

2000
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,440
and unlock augmentations at any time.

2001
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,860
You had to go to a clinic to get them installed.

2002
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:11,360
This worked as world building,

2003
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,320
but also sucked.

2004
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:14,600
Imagine finding something

2005
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,940
you need an augmentation for,

2006
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:17,940
then having to go to the doctor to get it

2007
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:19,320
and come all the way back.

2008
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:21,360
Later in development, the system was changed

2009
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:22,480
to how it works now,

2010
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,980
which was a clear improvement.

2011
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:25,440
However, the rest of the game

2012
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:28,120
had already been designed around the original system,

2013
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,520
and you don't go to a clinic

2014
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,040
until the first mission is over,

2015
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,080
so the level was made assuming players

2016
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,860
don't have any augmentations.

2017
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:37,500
For example, the conversation enhancer.

2018
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:40,280
Zeke's voice actor already recorded all his lines

2019
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,800
before this change was made,

2020
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:43,560
meaning there was no way his character

2021
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,900
could react to the enhancer with new dialogue,

2022
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:48,080
so to avoid too many players noticing,

2023
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,500
they deliberately paced the game's progression

2024
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,580
really slowly.

2025
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:53,660
And at the time that we wrote it,

2026
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:57,080
we didn't even have the concept of praxis kits.

2027
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:01,380
You had to go to the limb clinic to get operated on,

2028
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:03,000
so I think that's why we decided

2029
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,260
not to have it initially in this conversation

2030
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:08,000
because we knew you wouldn't have had a chance

2031
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,180
to get it yet,

2032
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:12,180
and later we came in with the idea of the praxis kits,

2033
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:15,360
and at that point, it became this issue of,

2034
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,680
oh, wait, we have to make sure we don't give you two

2035
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:20,060
because you might have it and we don't support it.

2036
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:23,360
So character progression for entire hours of the game

2037
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:26,060
is almost nonexistent because they had to avoid

2038
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:27,860
a scenario they hadn't planned for,

2039
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:29,360
and the saddest thing about this is

2040
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:32,480
the developers are obviously painfully aware of all this.

2041
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:33,480
At the beginning of the game,

2042
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:36,220
the pacing to get augmentations is too slow,

2043
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:38,940
and it's something that we're aware of

2044
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:40,360
and we're not happy with it,

2045
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:43,280
but because of those decisions and with what you explained,

2046
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:46,240
we were forced to keep it this way, so...

2047
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:51,120
This is one of the reasons why modern big games'

2048
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,040
production pipelines are often so rigid

2049
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,360
in case you were interested.

2050
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,440
When you chart an entire game in advance

2051
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,900
and then change your mind about how something works,

2052
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:01,160
you risk breaking all the stuff that was made

2053
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,900
assuming the game worked differently.

2054
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:05,400
This is an explanation but not really an excuse.

2055
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,160
They could have just made the social enhancer

2056
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,120
or cost three points and make it so players

2057
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:11,500
could get two a bit sooner,

2058
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,800
or hey, maybe write and record a few more lines

2059
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,460
for one of the best characters in this thing.

2060
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:16,880
That would have been really cool

2061
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,960
but also a lot more work for the extreme edge case

2062
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,880
of players picking this augmentation.

2063
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,120
Cumulatively, the new augmentation system

2064
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:27,840
massively affects the feel of the entire surrounding game.

2065
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,760
In Deus Ex, the augmentation canisters

2066
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,840
were unique, specific objects.

2067
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,420
If you didn't find the canister

2068
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:35,260
with the augmentation you wanted in it,

2069
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:36,380
you never got it.

2070
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,400
This made exploring really fun

2071
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,280
because unique stuff you wanted could be hidden here

2072
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,780
and finding one felt great.

2073
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,700
It was a new set of possibilities.

2074
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,740
The entire world was more engaging.

2075
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:47,920
Do you know how I found out there was

2076
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,420
a cloaking device in Deus Ex?

2077
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:51,700
I hacked into a secret lab storage chamber

2078
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:53,160
and stole their augmentations

2079
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,740
and one of them was a cloaking device.

2080
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:56,040
It felt like a discovery,

2081
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,920
a reward for engaging with the world

2082
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,880
and looking around and paying attention,

2083
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,000
and then you have a cool thing for the whole game

2084
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,220
that feels good to use

2085
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:04,960
because it feels like you earned it.

2086
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,680
In Human Revolution, the cloaking device

2087
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,800
is staring at you in the augmentation submenu

2088
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,560
as soon as you open it for the first time

2089
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,140
and you can unlock it whenever you want

2090
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:13,560
for two praxis points.

2091
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:16,180
Is that as fun an experience?

2092
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:19,020
A thing I love about games like Deus Ex and New Vegas

2093
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:20,600
is the sense they're full of secrets

2094
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,140
and new things to find.

2095
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:23,740
A corner of an abandoned vault

2096
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:25,480
might have a one-of-a-kind gun in it.

2097
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,060
A safe in a terrorist hideout

2098
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:28,740
has a speed enhancement in it.

2099
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:31,080
When you find it, it doesn't just feel cool.

2100
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:34,000
It makes you want to find and open every safe in the world

2101
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,280
to see what else is in them.

2102
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,460
What if instead of all of this unique,

2103
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:39,740
special stuff you tangibly found,

2104
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:41,840
it was just a stack of money you could spend

2105
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,620
buying those things in a submenu or at a store?

2106
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:46,420
It's not fun exploring a world

2107
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:48,760
whose most high-value reward for exploring

2108
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:51,140
is a floppy disk that gives you a point

2109
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,340
you already have six of but won't spend yet

2110
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:55,140
because you have to save them in case it turns out

2111
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:56,140
you need something.

2112
01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:57,640
I guarantee you a lot of players

2113
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,020
missed some pretty easy-to-find praxis points

2114
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:01,980
because looking for them was boring.

2115
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,380
Oh, there's a praxis point in this elevator shaft.

2116
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:06,600
What an adventure.

2117
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,840
It's not game-ruining that it works this way.

2118
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,760
It just makes everything a lot less fun

2119
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:13,260
than it could have been, and why?

2120
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:15,560
In the name of making it a bit simpler?

2121
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,980
Human Revolution is definitely

2122
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:18,640
slightly more welcoming this way.

2123
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,940
A spreadsheet doesn't appear when you hit new game,

2124
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:22,560
and at no point do you need to remember

2125
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,860
to open a menu to spend experience points

2126
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:26,820
and discover you've forgotten to do so for hours

2127
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:27,980
and have thousands of them now,

2128
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:29,980
but this simplicity comes at the expense

2129
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:33,200
of being able to make unique and personal decisions

2130
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:36,120
about your character and their role in the world.

2131
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,960
The original was far from perfect,

2132
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:40,380
but many of the complications are what made it fun,

2133
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:41,620
and taking those things out

2134
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:43,660

Was that a good idea?

Sure, if the game was just a hacking simulator,

it would be terrible and not have much gameplay,

in a building full of guys who are looking for you,

2195

Hacking is also a skill,

2199
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,640
so when you level it up, it gets much faster

2200
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,100
and you can do more things with computers you've hacked.

2201
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:58,940

2203
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:03,940

You feel more powerful in a very direct way.

2205

and the weight creates tension

2214
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:24,900
means hacking isn't really passive.

2215

It just might sound like it in a designer's head

01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:59,640
If you've played this game all the way through,

2311
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:02,640
it is genuinely possible you've spent more time

2312
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,520
playing the hacking minigame than any

2313
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,640
of the developers did making it.

2314
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,440
Not that that's really a bad thing though.

2315
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:11,640
Minigames are at risk of being a sunk cost feature.

2316
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,980
You could easily waste ages trying to make

2317
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:15,560
this slightly more fun,

2318
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:17,360
and I'm glad they spent the time elsewhere.

2319
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,200
My point is they should have put even less time

2320
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,560
into it and not made it.

2321
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,140
A slide in Lapikus' presentation

2322
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:24,020
describes the hacking philosophy

2323
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:26,060
which outlines the need to create tension

2324
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:27,940
and make the player feel more active,

2325
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:29,740
but there's one extra thing on the list

2326
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:31,200
that's really troubling.

2327
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,900
Hacking must be central to the game's progression

2328
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:36,940
at some key moments in the game.

2329
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:39,440
Oh, no. So remember when I said in Deus Ex

2330
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,700
even if you hated the hacking, it was optional?

2331
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:43,320
Turns out that was a mistake too.

2332
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,020
Hacking is now mandatory.

2333
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:47,820
The player sometimes has no alternative solutions

2334
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:49,360
but to play this minigame,

2335
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,520
and I'm genuinely not sure why.

2336
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:52,980
Were they that proud of it?

2337
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:54,480
Why take away the player's ability

2338
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,980
to choose how to progress?

2339
01:19:55,980 --> 01:19:58,780
Being mandatory actually makes the hacking worse too

2340
01:19:58,780 --> 01:20:00,600
because now the developers have to account

2341
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,240
for the possibility players were really bad at hacking

2342
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,740
or hadn't put any of their skill points

2343
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:06,820
into the ability to hack higher level terminals.

2344
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:08,620
Which means all the mandatory ones

2345
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:10,620
are incredibly low level and easy.

2346
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:13,120
So sure, this means if you hate hacking,

2347
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,780
it's never challenging when you're forced to do it,

2348
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:17,860
but it also means players who put their points

2349
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:19,620
into hacking are never tested

2350
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:22,040
on any of the important terminals of the game.

2351
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,780
There's a section partway through where the player

2352
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:26,540
has to hack the computer of that master hacker from before.

2353
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:28,820
I love computers. This computer belongs to the guy

2354
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:32,160
who brain jacked someone and made them jack their brain

2355
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,400
right in front of you.

2356
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,900
He's so advanced, the biggest tech company

2357
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:37,980
in the world hired him to do it.

2358
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:41,020
He's had a secret backdoor into your company's computers

2359
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:42,520
for like a year.

2360
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:45,060
However, this master hacker's computer

2361
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:47,160
is plot important, so it's level one

2362
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:49,400
and easy to get into and his computer's covered

2363
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:52,200
in the extra hacking viruses to help you out just in case.

2364
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,980
There isn't even a password you can find

2365
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:56,240
if you explore or search other areas.

2366
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,520
You have to hack.

2367
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,900
Also sure, the forever alone meme.

2368
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:01,100
That'll age well.

2369
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:03,780
You'll notice I said meme and not in-joke.

2370
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:06,020
What if this master hacker's computer

2371
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:08,900
was really high level and if you hadn't invested in hacking,

2372
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:10,820
you needed to go on a cool side quest

2373
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:13,620
to learn the password or explore his apartment to find it?

2374
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:15,080
Or what if you just couldn't get into it

2375
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:17,580
and had to follow up on other leads to find the hacker?

2376
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:19,900
You want players to feel like they gained something

2377
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:22,940
from specializing, not that they wasted their time.

2378
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:24,740
In the original, there's a section where you need

2379
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:26,480
to acquire the password to a computer

2380
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,980
and it's deep in a basement full of lasers and traps

2381
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:30,580
and explosives and turrets,

2382
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:31,860
but if you invested in hacking,

2383
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:33,440
you can just hack the computer.

2384
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,520
Giving the player choices based on what sort

2385
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,400
of character they've made is kind of

2386
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,360
the whole point of RPGs.

2387
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,320
If the game was either a forced search

2388
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:44,600
for a password in a basement or a forced hacking sequence,

2389
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:47,240
it would lose a lot of its value as gameplay,

2390
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,820
but no, you see, hacking must be central

2391
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:51,640
to the game's progression.

2392
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,520
Why though? The game does reward you

2393
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,140
for investing in hacking sometimes.

2394
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:57,060
Off the beaten track are high level terminals

2395
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:58,820
that lead to extra stuff and in missions,

2396
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:00,280
there's often security equipment

2397
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:01,560
that let you turn off cameras,

2398
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:03,900
commandeer turrets, and even combat robots

2399
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,860
when the level designers remember to put them in.

2400
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:07,360
I think it feels a bit less special

2401
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:10,020
that everyone else is doing half the hacking you do anyway,

2402
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:11,640
but it still works out to be pretty fun.

2403
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,640
One of my favorite things to do in Human Revolution

2404
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:15,360
is if you have the ability to hack turrets

2405
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:16,560
and the strength upgrade,

2406
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,820
you can pick up turrets and carry them around

2407
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:20,560
while they destroy everyone in your path.

2408
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,560
It's fantastic.

2409
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:23,060
It feels amazing being rewarded

2410
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:24,680
for combining these two abilities.

2411
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:25,720
This stuff is great.

2412
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:27,600
The part of this transaction I don't like

2413
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,680
is how many times I had to play competitive

2414
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:31,360
join the dots to get here.

2415
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,120
It's not just that the hacking is a huge waste of time.

2416
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:36,120
It's that they deliberately made their game

2417
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:38,400
more of a waste of time than the original

2418
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,660
with the specific intent of making the player

2419
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:42,620
feel like they're doing more,

2420
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:44,660
and yeah, you are doing more,

2421
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:47,400
but more busy work does not equal more fun,

2422
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,780
and this idea has gone unquestioned for so long

2423
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:51,160
that it was a genuine shock

2424
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:53,160
when the recent death loop removed it

2425
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:54,820
or when Bioshock 2 removed it

2426
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:56,200
and added a separate weapon

2427
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,580
that triggered a different minigame

2428
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:58,940
that was shorter and simpler

2429
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:00,440
and actually impacted the gameplay

2430
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:03,620
Is it just me or is Bioshock 2 the best one

2431
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:04,940
by a really wide margin?

2432
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:06,200
Like, it's not even close.

2433
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,620
All right, all right, I have to stop.

2434
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:08,700
My heart can't take it.

2435
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:10,020
The hacking chapter is over.

2436
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:12,120
We're safe. We're alive. It's gone.

2437
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,940
Let's move to yellower pastures.

2438
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:15,700
♪♪

2439
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:17,480
The smart lockpick is always handy.

2440
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,200
The original game also had mechanics

2441
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,740
for lockpicking to deal with locks

2442
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:22,860
and electronics for bypassing other devices

2443
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:25,280
that can't be hacked like power boxes and stuff,

2444
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,120
but hey, if you squint,

2445
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:29,440
they're a bit passive too, aren't they?

2446
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,660
You just sit there and use your item on them.

2447
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:34,820
How did the Human Revolution team update these mechanics?

2448
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:37,400
They replaced them with the fucking hacking minigame!

2449
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:39,660
♪♪

2450
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:42,200
That's right! There's three times as much hacking

2451
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:43,700
as you thought there was going to be.

2452
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:45,160
To get into people's houses,

2453
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:48,820
you don't need to find, you know, a fucking key.

2454
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:50,080
Like how doors work.

2455
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:52,360
You hack the convenient terminal

2456
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:53,740
in front of everybody's door

2457
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:56,740
or if you're lucky, you can find the code for it somewhere.

2458
01:23:56,740 --> 01:24:00,000
The concept of keys doesn't exist

2459
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,280
in the world of Human Revolution.

2460
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:03,820
Now that's streamlining.

2461
01:24:03,820 --> 01:24:05,660
In the original, hacking, lockpicking,

2462
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:07,420
and electronics were all separate skills

2463
01:24:07,420 --> 01:24:10,160
you could invest in with different effects on the world.

2464
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:12,200
All of this being the same minigame

2465
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,700
makes it all feel like you're doing

2466
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:15,280
the same thing over and over

2467
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,280
and it feels like that because you are.

2468
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,500
Using a multi-tool that's tied into your proficiency

2469
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,880
with a skill to turn off a laser grid, that's cool,

2470
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:23,700
but what if instead it was a minigame

2471
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:25,500
that took 24 seconds to do?

2472
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:26,500
Oh, yeah, I'd love that.

2473
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,420
Just squeeze that right into my mouth.

2474
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:30,220
Actually, no, we're not playing that in fast forward.

2475
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:31,720
You're watching all of this with me.

2476
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,340
I've got a magazine here.

2477
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:44,720
Man, there's a full page ad here

2478
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,960
for Mark Kermode's film review.

2479
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,300
I like that guy. I disagree with him

2480
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:49,540
like 90% of the time,

2481
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:51,720
but I'll know if I like a movie based on what he says,

2482
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:54,000
so I think that makes him a good critic, right?

2483
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,460
Oh, it's over.

2484
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,300
Now, go watch that 150 times

2485
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:00,460
and then tell me that this is good.

2486
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:02,460
Quite a few more people have the achievement

2487
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:05,720
for hacking 50 devices than for beating the second boss

2488
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:07,260
a bit past the halfway point.

2489
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:09,380
I can't help but wonder if the hacking is a factor

2490
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:11,040
in why people stopped playing.

2491
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,540
Apparently, one company

2492
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:14,500
manufactures everybody's locks now.

2493
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,460
That must be where the Illuminati get all the money

2494
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:18,080
for their secret science bases.

2495
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,460
Based on how you played it,

2496
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:21,380
Deus Ex was a lot of different things

2497
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:22,500
to a lot of people.

2498
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:25,040
Now a bunch of it is unavoidably hacking.

2499
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:28,200
For everyone, and that is worse.

2500
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,040
None of this stuff is a deal breaker, of course.

2501
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,280
The game's still pretty good.

2502
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,420
I just think it really sucks how many choices

2503
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:35,700
have been actively removed from the game,

2504
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:38,380
but that's not what the developers were focused on.

2505
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:41,420
By their own admission, they focused on the combat.

♪♪

2507
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,040
The first thing most people notice

2508
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,340
about the original Deus Ex

2509
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:50,880
is that shooting is fairly complicated and weird.

2510
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,160
Weapons are pretty powerful.

2511
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:54,200
Headshots with almost any weapon are lethal,

2512
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:57,000
but they require skill point investments to use properly.

2513
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,860
At lower levels, they reload slower,

2514
01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:01,240
are less effective, and take ages to aim.

2515
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,820
This kind of odd aiming system wasn't an accident.

2516
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:04,960
This was deliberately added

2517
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,780
onto the Unreal Tournament engine.

2518
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:09,080
Yeah, it's not a very good first-person shooter,

2519
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,580
but it's also not trying to be one.

2520
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:13,360
It's trying to be an RPG

2521
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:16,000
where shooting is a skill you have to invest in.

2522
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,080
Combat being something difficult to execute

2523
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,820
is an important part of the design.

2524
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:21,580
I'll explain what I mean by referring

2525
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:24,000
to another famous immersive sim, Thief.

2526
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,420
Thief is a stealth game,

2527
01:26:25,420 --> 01:26:27,220
but you can pull out a sword if you want,

2528
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:29,760
and there's a pretty in-depth sword fighting system in there,

2529
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,260
but as soon as you fight more than one person at once

2530
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:34,500
or an undead warrior or a wizard,

2531
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:35,800
you're basically dead.

2532
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:38,880
The point is combat is a bad situation you should avoid.

2533
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:41,180
Ah!

2534
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:44,080
Thief's sneaking is fun because you know you're dead

2535
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,960
if you get seen by a bunch of people.

2536
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:47,080
On the higher difficulties,

2537
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:48,840
killing someone gives you a game over.

2538
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:50,460
It wouldn't be as fun if you could cut

2539
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:52,380
six people's heads off in five seconds

2540
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:55,140
and, oh, what's this dishonored footage doing here?

2541
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:56,680
Warren Spector worked at Looking Glass

2542
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:59,100
while they were making Thief and remembers being annoyed

2543
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:01,100
he couldn't just fight enemies if he wanted,

2544
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:02,720
and in his talk, he actually describes

2545
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,340
learning this exact lesson.

2546
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:08,220
I came to a place that was just too hard for me to sneak,

2547
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:09,720
and I asked the team,

2548
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:12,140
just make me tough enough that I can fight my way

2549
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:15,340
past these guards because I'm getting killed every time,

2550
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:16,420
and they said no.

2551
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:20,340
If we made the player character strong enough to fight,

2552
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:21,640
no one would ever sneak,

2553
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:23,400
and the idea of the game was to sneak,

2554
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,100
and they're probably right for Thief.

2555
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:26,560
That was probably the right decision to make.

2556
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,180
He describes Deus Ex as a game

2557
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:30,280
trying to be a bit more balanced than Thief.

2558
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:33,060
I made a vow right then that I was gonna make a game

2559
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:37,100
that lets you fight or sneak, uh, as you chose.

2560
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:39,360
It wants to let you do combat if you want to

2561
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,100
and make it satisfying to win

2562
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:43,900
but also retain the fun of avoiding it if you can

2563
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:45,680
by making combat something that's hard

2564
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,140
if you're not invested in it.

2565
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:49,220
This means sneaking or using exploration

2566
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:51,560
or talking to people or hacking the enemy's robots

2567
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:54,320
and letting them mess them up for you is rewarding.

2568
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:57,060
Right before we shipped, I put my head down on my desk,

2569
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:58,240
and I just said,

2570
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:01,900
if people get that you can fight, sneak, or talk,

2571
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:03,700
we're gonna rule the world.

2572
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:06,860
If people compare our combat to Half-Life, we're dead.

2573
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:08,400
For the Human Revolution team,

2574
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:11,020
modernizing the combat was their highest priority.

2575
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:13,140
Lapicus's talk has a chart showing what they spent

2576
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:14,480
the most time and resources on.

2577
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:17,480
As we decided that combat would be where we would put

2578
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:19,980
most of our time, energy, and resources.

2579
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:22,980
They knew they could handily outdo the original on combat,

2580
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:24,860
so they really put their minds to it,

2581
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:27,480
and the combat in Human Revolution is really good.

2582
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:29,820
Bullets hurt a lot, so fights are punishing

2583
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:31,900
when you get hit, and they're satisfying to win

2584
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:33,160
because you almost died.

2585
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:34,660
I thought I would hate that they added

2586
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:36,080
cover shooting to Deus Ex,

2587
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,900
but it's executed really well.

2588
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:40,040
Wee. There's no huge gauntlets.

2589
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:41,900
Every shootout is its own landscape

2590
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,860
with enemies trying to flank and flush you out

2591
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:45,620
with grenades once a fight starts.

2592
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:47,240
There's none of the busy work you get in

2593
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:48,780
with other shooters where you just, like,

2594
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:51,080
kill a lot of people so you have something to do

2595
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:52,340
on your way to the next level.

2596
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:54,540
When you do fight, the fight is unique

2597
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:56,840
and specific to that area and the type of

2598
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:58,260
and amount of enemies.

2599
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:00,380
That said, there is one aspect of the combat

2600
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:02,460
that's not very good. Let's talk about melee.

2601
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:04,560
Deus Ex had a wide variety of lethal

2602
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:06,840
and non-lethal choices for hand-to-hand combat

2603
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,060
from police batons to riot prods,

2604
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,340
knives, and crowbars.

2605
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:12,400
Then when you got to China, you could find a sword

2606
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,640
and have a flipping sword, which was cool,

2607
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:17,180
and later you found a gosh darn lightsaber.

2608
01:29:17,180 --> 01:29:19,140
Well, a sword made of tiny nanomachines

2609
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:20,640
arranging in the shape of a sword,

2610
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,260
but look at it. Human revolution

2611
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:26,300
streamlined melee weapons by removing them.

2612
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:29,560
No, really, there's no melee weapons in Deus Ex anymore.

2613
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:32,400
You can't pull out a stick and swing it at someone.

2614
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,440
It's all guns all the time.

2615
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,100
It's like me at the gym.

2616
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:37,600
There's baseball bats lying around,

2617
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,200

01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:41,660
That shit must be heavy.

2620
01:29:41,660 --> 01:29:42,940
Grenades can't even move it.

2621
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:44,580
Instead, you perform melee combat

2622
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:46,960
by pressing a button, and if you have enough energy,

2623
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:48,900
a cinematic plays depicting Jensen

taking the person out, lethally or non-lethally

2625
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,080
based on whether you held the button down.

2626
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:55,280
They simplified the melee combat so much

2627
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:59,040
they moved it out of the game and into a cut scene.

2628
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,240
Cut scene Jensen rides again.

2629

01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:05,660

Here's how melee combat works in Deus Ex now.

When it comes to the shooting, which is all that's left,

2664
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:23,040
the RPG mechanics of the original

2665
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,540
have been completely removed.

2666
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:26,740
Adam has perfect aim with almost every weapon

2667
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:27,740
at the start of the game,

2668
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:29,320
especially if you use the sights,

2669
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:30,660
and while there are augmentations

2670
01:31:30,660 --> 01:31:31,660
that reduce recoil,

2671
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:32,820
the recoil you start with

2672
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:34,200
is pretty easy to handle,

2673
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:35,280
and this is good.

2674
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,660
It means combat is more a test

2675
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:38,960
of the player's skill than their character's stats,

2676
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:41,080
and for something as visceral as a shootout,

2677
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:42,280
I think that works.

2678

Come on, man, don't tell me this doesn't look fun.

The original game's stealth was okay.

2687
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,460
You could lean around corners, which sounds stealthy,

2688
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:04,960
but it didn't seem to help you avoid being caught.

2689

the game wanted you to be stealthy.

The stealthy weapons weren't too useful either.

The tranquilizer crossbow was silent,

2699
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:28,960
but enemies were still alerted for the many seconds

2700
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,700

Melee from stealth sometimes knocked enemies out

2705

and sometimes merely hurt them

2706
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:41,080
and then alerted them to you.

2707
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:43,300
The stun prod seemed to base its effectiveness

2708

Now's a good time to tell you several

2711
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:51,460
of this game's developers had previously worked

2712
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:53,000
on Splinter Cell Chaos Theory,

2713
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,680
one of the best stealth games and games of all time,

2714
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:58,220
including Francois Lapikus,

2715
01:32:58,220 --> 01:33:00,720
making him a literal heroic genius.

2716
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:02,640
I'm not normally a pure stealth guy.

2717
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:05,400
I try until I get seen and then I start blasting.

2718
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:07,720
I'm the sort of person Dishonored was made for.

2719
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,360
I hope that joke earlier didn't mislead you.

2720
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:10,720
I love that game, seriously,

2721
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:12,820
but Human Revolution is at its most fun

2722
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:15,820
when you take the stealth as seriously as you can.

01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:17,900
The Thief games and even Splinter Cell

2724
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:20,200
start to bore me after a while when I try that,

2725
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:23,280
but here everything's at its most tense and careful

2726
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:25,620
while never being too slow or trial or error,

2727
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:27,880
and I just criticized the takedowns,

2728
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:28,880
but you know what?

2729
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:30,540
They're super reliable for stealth.

2730
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:31,540
If you haven't been seen,

2731
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:33,460
the takedown is silent and stealthy

2732
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:35,940
and there's no chance of it not knocking out the enemy

2733
01:33:35,940 --> 01:33:37,080
like you thought it would.

2734
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:39,240
This is kinda how Chaos Theory worked,

2735
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:41,540
using takedowns instead of typical melee.

2736
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:44,660
It was always an instant kill or knockout.

2737
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:46,920
You just had to get in close enough to do it,

2738
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:49,760
which explains why they did it the way they did here.

2739
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:52,680
Sam Fisher's Sleepy Slappers didn't need ammunition, though,

2740
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:54,640
and the takedown wasn't a long animation

2741
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:55,920
that took away your control,

2742
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,800
but at least the game's weird melee system

2743
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:59,560
starts to make sense when you consider

2744

the creators' design chops

2745

a fantastic stealth experience

2769
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,880

2770
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,960
removed the limitations on shooting

2771
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,800
that made it less viable in the original,

2772
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,580
and then bolted third-person cover shooting mechanics

2773
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:04,500

it was the least viable solution,

which have a couple bullets in them,

2834
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:21,580
and sometimes there's a few more on their bodies.

2835
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:24,100
If you're not being really precise with your shots,

2836
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:27,180
you can easily end with less ammo than you started.

2837
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:28,880
This was a super smart choice.

2838
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:30,480
It means there's much more pressure

2839
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:33,020
to make your shots count or, more importantly,

2840
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:36,220
to avoid wasting bullets fighting in the first place.

2841
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:39,360
This tremendously alters how the player relates to the world.

2842
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:41,140
Sure, you could just shoot all these guys

2843
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:42,900
like I said before, but that would actually make

2844
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:44,860
your life harder in the next fight.

2845
01:37:44,860 --> 01:37:45,700
See what I mean?

2846
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:48,040
Scarcity of resources recontextualizes

2847
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:50,860
what would otherwise be a fairly simple situation.

2848
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:53,240
Sure, you can take a bunch of guys out with a grenade,

2849
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:55,440
but you have, like, two grenades.

2850
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:56,660
You might need those.

2851
01:37:56,660 --> 01:37:57,980
The end result is like playing

2852
01:37:57,980 --> 01:37:59,540
a fairly simple cover shooter

2853
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:02,860
while being lightly choked from behind by a game designer.

2854
01:38:02,860 --> 01:38:04,160
Even when it's straightforward,

2855
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:06,780
it's still a little tense, and that's what makes it fun.

2856
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:09,660
Adam Jensen is a deadly shadow on the battlefield

2857
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:12,200
who can dish it out, but only in small portions,

2858
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:14,880
and if he's not careful, he won't have room for dessert.

2859
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,920
I'm not kidding how seriously these guys took

2860
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:18,140
the balancing of resources.

2861
01:38:18,140 --> 01:38:20,260
In Lapicus's talk, he shows photographs

2862
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:21,920
of huge bulletin boards they made

2863
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:23,740
to track all the weapons, ammunition,

2864
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:25,960
and items a player could find in the levels.

2865
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:28,880
We used these balance boards to get a sense

2866
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:30,500
of everything that was in the game.

2867
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:32,340
This is about half the boards we had.

2868
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:33,580
We had six in total.

2869
01:38:33,580 --> 01:38:36,140
And tried to make sure they were never too powerful,

2870
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:37,500
never had enough stuff,

2871
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,840
so a big fight would always cost them.

2872
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,340
During playtests, people would complain.

2873
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:43,340
They would say, well, I don't have enough ammo

2874
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:46,060
to kill everybody, but then again,

2875
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:47,900
that's exactly what we wanted.

2876
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:49,140
Chris Rock was right.

2877
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:51,700
Sometimes what you need is bullet control,

2878
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:54,200
so the core experience works out really well.

2879
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:56,200
There's this fantastic primary loop

2880
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:58,000
of carefully avoiding enemies,

2881
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,960
stealthily taking out the ones you can

2882
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:02,720
with takedowns or silenced weapons to preserve ammo,

2883
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:05,500
hoping to thin the crowd before a big fight starts,

2884
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:07,760
building up enough ammunition that you can afford

2885
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:09,680
to get in fights when you do get caught,

2886
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:12,720
the occasional inevitable explosions of violence,

2887
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:15,480
and the careful picking clean of the bodies at the end.

2888
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:18,220
There's a rhythm to it that feels excellent.

2889
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:20,980
If you want an FPS RPG whose FPS component

2890
01:39:20,980 --> 01:39:22,800
is some genuinely good shooting

2891
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:25,060
that doesn't invalidate stealth and hacking

2892
01:39:25,060 --> 01:39:26,720
and other alternative solutions,

2893
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:29,680
Human Revolution is basically the game for you.

2894
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:32,880
However, as Deus Ex used to like pointing out,

2895
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:34,840
these choices have consequences.

2896
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:36,760
Say you like the tranquilizer rifle.

2897
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:39,600
It's silent and non-lethal and has a decent range.

2898
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:42,640
It has basically no weaknesses except it's a bit slow.

2899
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:45,380
So in a normal game, the bullets would be expensive,

2900
01:39:45,380 --> 01:39:47,220
but that would be your choice to make, right?

2901
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:49,060
Well, not here because if you can buy

2902
01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:50,800
all the tranq rifle rounds you want,

2903
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:51,960
the game would be too easy.

2904
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:53,380
Instead, the local weapon store

2905
01:39:53,380 --> 01:39:56,180
will sell you five packs of two,

2906
01:39:56,180 --> 01:39:58,220
and those ten darts will have to last you a while

2907
01:39:58,220 --> 01:40:00,420
because the other store in Detroit doesn't sell any.

2908
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:02,100
You'll have to go all the way to China

2909
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:04,420
to find someone else willing to sell these to you.

2910
01:40:04,420 --> 01:40:05,600
This is a good choice.

2911
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,720
Giving the player too much ammo for the best weapon

2912
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:10,220
would ruin the tension and make things way too easy,

2913
01:40:10,220 --> 01:40:12,520
but on a simpler level, it's incredibly annoying

2914
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:14,600
to not be allowed to buy ammo

2915
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:16,420
for the weapon you like to use.

2916
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:18,880
This is one of the trade-offs this design has to make.

2917
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:20,840
It works, but in a way that might be

2918
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:22,720
a little bit annoying for some types of player

2919
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:25,040
who thought they could spend the money they were saving

2920
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:28,000
on things they wanted or expected one of the two weapons

2921
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,220
they can fit in their inventory to have enough ammo

2922
01:40:30,220 --> 01:40:31,800
available to make it useful.

2923
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:33,500
There are also limb clinics where you can buy

2924
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:36,180
praxis points, so I mean, if you want more,

2925
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:38,220
you can look around for more credits to buy more

2926
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:40,840
and maybe sell the weapons and ammo you aren't using, right?

2927
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:43,960
You know, like a fun video game would do

2928
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:46,540
if it wanted to give you interesting decisions to make.

2929
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:48,080
The billboard says no.

2930
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:51,760
Limb clinics will sell you two praxis points.

2931
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:54,040
The scarcity starts to feel really weird

2932
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:57,040
if you think too hard about it or try to circumvent it.

2933
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:58,920
What's that? You think you can get the upper hand

2934
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:00,960
by knocking out a bunch of well-armed policemen

2935
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:03,160
with assault rifles and get a couple more bullets

2936
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:05,000
to get an edge at the start of the game?

2937
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,340
Nice try. Those cops aren't carrying any ammo on them

2938
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:10,420
and their guns had three bullets in them.

2939
01:41:10,420 --> 01:41:13,000
No, not each. Between both of them.

2940
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,500
In a fight, NPCs have infinite bullets.

2941
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:17,960
The game keeps track of how many shots they've fired,

2942
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:20,200
not so it can give you their remaining ammo,

2943
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:22,120
so avoiding fighting and taking them out

2944
01:41:22,120 --> 01:41:24,120
gives you a bigger reward, but to keep track

2945
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:26,160
of when they need to reload.

2946
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:27,500
I don't know. This is starting to feel

2947
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:28,920
a little bit artificial.

2948
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:31,700
Lots of areas have weapons lying around sort of as props,

2949
01:41:31,700 --> 01:41:33,460
populating some of the pretty sparse

2950
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:34,920
office and apartment areas.

2951
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:37,700
Almost all of these have exactly one bullet in them.

2952
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:39,700
There's something extremely disconcerting

2953
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:42,240
about a world full of people who keep a gun on their desk

2954
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:43,480
with one bullet in it.

2955
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:45,280
This sort of thing starts to really affect

2956
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:46,780
how exploration feels.

2957
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:49,120
Remember, these guys had a big billboard on the wall

2958
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:51,020
keeping track of every bullet in the game

2959
01:41:51,020 --> 01:41:52,480
after seeing what playtesters did

2960
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:53,860
when they gave them too much,

2961
01:41:53,860 --> 01:41:56,440
so if you're exploring every nook and cranny,

2962
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:58,940
opening every locker, looking in bathrooms

2963
01:41:58,940 --> 01:42:00,400
and behind boxes and so on,

2964
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,620
there will be rewards for exploring,

2965
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:04,860
but the billboard said if you get too much stuff,

2966
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:06,200
it won't be tense anymore,

2967
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,160
so the main reward is going to be, like,

2968
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:09,660
five more bullets.

2969
01:42:09,660 --> 01:42:11,320
The game will throw a massive room

2970
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:12,940
full of, like, 50 lockers at you,

2971
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:14,980
and there'll be, like, four pickups in total

2972
01:42:14,980 --> 01:42:18,200
amounting to one full clip of ammo for one gun

2973
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:19,820
and a third of a clip for another

2974
01:42:19,820 --> 01:42:20,940
and maybe a grenade,

2975
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:22,520
and the lockers only open halfway,

2976
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:23,820
so you gotta really peek in there

2977
01:42:23,820 --> 01:42:25,120
to make sure you see everything.

2978
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:26,480
Oh, and because it's this game,

2979
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,980
none of the lockers are locked

2980
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:30,980
because locks don't exist anymore.

2981
01:42:30,980 --> 01:42:33,440
Even the most daring heists in the game

2982
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:35,160
start to feel kind of pointless.

2983
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:38,060
In the Detroit level, you can break into the armory

2984
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:39,320
of a police station.

2985
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:40,820
A police station armory.

2986
01:42:40,820 --> 01:42:43,060
An American police station armory.

2987
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:44,440
I've seen their budgets.

2988
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:45,940
That sounds like pay dirt.

2989
01:42:45,940 --> 01:42:47,320
Access granted.

2990
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:49,400
♪ ♪

2991
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:51,060
Prepare for the cornucopia.

2992
01:42:51,060 --> 01:42:52,900
I hope you're ready for two stun grenades

2993
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:55,320
and a template that can turn one of them into a mine

2994
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:58,520
and an assault rifle with 15 bullets to go with it.

2995
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:00,900
That's less than a full clip of rifle ammo.

2996
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:02,740
Is that a clip or a magazine?

2997
01:43:02,740 --> 01:43:04,120
I don't know, and I'm too hopped up

2998
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:06,020
on all this sweet loot to care.

2999
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:09,120
Oh, boy, a shotgun and five shells to go with it

3000
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:12,080
and a completely new gun that stuns enemies briefly

3001
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:13,460
that you don't have room for

3002
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:15,500
and four shots for it if you could.

3003
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:17,000
Oh, and a rate of fire upgrade

3004
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,200
so you can fire the bullets you don't have faster.

3005
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:21,360
You can really feel how contrived the Scarcity's.

3006
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:23,280
Scarcity? Scarcity? I don't even know how to say it.

3007
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,280
Like, they put all these ammo pickups on the table

3008
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:27,540
so it feels like you're getting a big horde of stuff,

3009
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:29,820
but it's actually just several small boxes

3010
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:31,700
with two and three bullets in them.

3011
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:34,320
Think about why they deliberately did that for a second.

3012
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:35,960
They could have just put one box

3013
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:37,860
with 15 bullets in it next to the gun,

3014
01:43:37,860 --> 01:43:39,360
but then players would understand

3015
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:41,660
how little stuff they were being given for this.

3016
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:43,560
If I gave you five quality streets

3017
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:45,360
and not even any green triangles,

3018
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:47,060
you'd think I was ruining Christmas,

3019
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:49,560
but if I gave it to you in the form of two boxes

3020
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:52,980
for a few minutes, I'd be the best uncle ever.

3021
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:55,440
I get to write these off as a business expense now.

3022
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:57,980
Knowing now what the reward for this adventure was,

3023
01:43:57,980 --> 01:43:59,700
let's all go watch the hacking minigame

3024
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:01,100
I had to do to get this.

3025
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:03,860
["This is what you get for demanding the truth."

3026
01:44:03,860 --> 01:44:05,980
No, I'm serious. I'm doing it again.

3027
01:44:05,980 --> 01:44:08,100
There's actually a couple of NPC guards

3028
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:10,320
who are, like, talking about how cool the Peps is

3029
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:11,860
in the hallway of the police station,

3030
01:44:11,860 --> 01:44:13,820
and when you get it, you get four shots for it,

3031
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:15,320
and it kind of sucks.

3032
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:17,940
It sucks so bad it doesn't even come back in the sequel.

3033
01:44:17,940 --> 01:44:20,480
They make it like an augmentation or something.

3034
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,860
I didn't pick up the Peps here,

3035
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:23,980
but I did hoard all the ammo I could

3036
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:25,180
over the course of the whole game,

3037
01:44:25,180 --> 01:44:27,820
so I got a good 15 shots in the last level.

3038
01:44:27,820 --> 01:44:30,480
Okay, I'm done with my Peps talk.

3039
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:31,860
I promise I won't do this again.

3040
01:44:31,860 --> 01:44:33,940
I always thought it was strange how Sandoval

3041
01:44:33,940 --> 01:44:36,280
sadly and slowly takes out a revolver,

3042
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:38,100
and the implication is pretty clear, right?

3043
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:39,440
We know what he's planning,

3044
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:41,940
but then he also takes out a single bullet

3045
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:43,140
to put in the gun.

3046
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:44,820
First off, Sandy, it's this game.

3047
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:46,320
The gun already had one bullet in it,

3048
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,600
but if you talk him down, he puts the gun on the desk,

3049
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:49,600
and you can pick it up,

3050
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:51,280
and of course it has one bullet in it,

3051
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:52,480
and if he does shoot himself,

3052
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:53,780
you can still pick up the gun,

3053
01:44:53,780 --> 01:44:55,280
but of course it doesn't have five?

3054
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:57,140
Five bullets? Fuck this fucking game!

3055
01:44:57,140 --> 01:44:58,940
It's not just having too many bullets

3056
01:44:58,940 --> 01:45:00,140
that would make you overpowered.

3057
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:02,940
It's having weapons that are too powerful in general.

3058
01:45:02,940 --> 01:45:05,780
The game has two really powerful weapons,

3059
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:07,780
the laser rifle and the plasma rifle.

3060
01:45:07,780 --> 01:45:10,240
Both of these weapons deal immense amounts of damage

3061
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:13,940
really quickly and can melt any enemy practically instantly.

3075

The first time you find the laser rifle

is behind Tong during your second visit to China,

3107

It seems like they designed these weapons

3108
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:55,320
much earlier on than did the playtesting

3109
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:57,820
and realized how much their reliance on combat

3110
01:46:57,820 --> 01:47:00,240
broke the game's feel and they had to lean on scarcity

3111

I would say without going too specific in the numbers,

3116

This next thing's been stuck in my craw

3138
01:47:51,660 --> 01:47:53,440
for literally a full decade.

3139
01:47:53,460 --> 01:47:54,720
In an interview with Eurogamer,

3140
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:56,340
the game's director, Jean-Francois Degas,

3141
01:47:56,340 --> 01:47:58,420
made a really enlightening statement,

3142
01:47:58,420 --> 01:48:00,040
and I'm not saying that sarcastically.

3143
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:01,300
It genuinely is.

3144
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:03,140
I've obsessed about it for 10 years.

3145
01:48:03,140 --> 01:48:04,260
What is wrong with me?

3146
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:05,920
The laser rifle looks like fun.

3147
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:07,020
How does it work?

3148
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:07,940
It is a weapon.

3149
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:08,720
Sorry.

3150
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:10,980
It is a weapon that allows you to shoot through walls,

3151
01:48:10,980 --> 01:48:12,600
so you just have to shoot, really.

3152
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:14,220
Combined with the smart vision,

3153
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:15,720
e.g. through through walls,

3154
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:17,280
it makes for deadly combo.

3155
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,820
However, I'm telling you right away,

3156
01:48:18,820 --> 01:48:20,860
it's a very difficult weapon to get.

3157
01:48:20,860 --> 01:48:23,360
You can see why this is such a meaningful statement.

3158
01:48:23,780 --> 01:48:25,280
I'm sure Degas wouldn't say that

3159
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:27,200
while intending for the rifle to be something

3160
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:29,120
you get lying against a wall

3161
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:30,820
right before the last couple of levels.

3162
01:48:30,820 --> 01:48:33,200
We're going full speculation ops here.

3163
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:35,000
I could be reading way too much into this,

3164
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,240
but it sounds like in the nearly a year

3165
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:39,200
between this interview and the release of the game,

3166
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:40,460
the design got altered.

3167
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:42,080
Maybe the laser rifle was balanced

3168
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:44,460
by making it a reward for some difficult challenge

3169
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:47,000
like a daring heist in a police station or something,

3170
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,800
but then they did more playtesting

3171
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:51,100
and noticed that even when the weapon was hard to get

3172
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:52,300
and had limited ammo,

3173
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:54,420
it ruined the entire feel of the game.

3174
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:56,380
Stealth, conservation of resources,

3175
01:48:56,380 --> 01:48:58,300
hell, even the basic flow of combat

3176
01:48:58,300 --> 01:49:00,800
gets irrevocably changed when a player gets

3177
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:03,480
the shoot through walls instant murder beam,

3178
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:05,220
so they must have made the tough decision

3179
01:49:05,220 --> 01:49:07,860
of turning it into an extremely late game weapon

3180
01:49:07,860 --> 01:49:09,820
so at the very least it couldn't mess

3181
01:49:09,820 --> 01:49:11,440
with the rest of the game's pace.

3182
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:13,400
This points to just how devoted they were

3183
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:16,060
to making the central mechanics feel good.

3184
01:49:16,060 --> 01:49:18,660
It's obviously really important for the game

3185
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:21,800
that it's not incredibly easy to defeat enemies.

3186
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:23,980
They designed several powerful weapons

3187
01:49:23,980 --> 01:49:25,140
that were fun to play with,

3188
01:49:25,140 --> 01:49:27,100
but then cut them out of most of the game

3189
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:29,140
in the name of making sure the core gameplay

3190
01:49:29,140 --> 01:49:30,480
could live its best life.

3191
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:33,360
Unfortunately, and it pains me to do this,

3192
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:35,160
after all this time going into detail

3193
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:37,240
about some really clever design choices,

3194
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:40,740
we now have to talk about how they kind of ruined them.

3195
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:46,920
♪♪

3196
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:49,140
You know how I've been really hitting you over the head

3197
01:49:49,140 --> 01:49:50,800
with how important scarcity was?

3198
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:53,440
Well, in his talk, Lapicus was also doing that.

3199
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:56,440
-"Dare Sex?" is a game about scarcity of resources.

3200
01:49:56,440 --> 01:49:58,520
Oh, that's why I keep pronouncing it like that.

3201
01:49:58,520 --> 01:50:00,060
If we give you everything,

3202
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:01,780
you're not gonna think anymore.

3203
01:50:01,780 --> 01:50:04,900
You're just gonna go and use the simple route.

3204
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:07,740
It's fun for players to be rewarded for their choices

3205
01:50:07,740 --> 01:50:10,120
or to be made to deal with problems caused by them.

3206
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:11,240
The original does this too,

3207
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:12,820
not to the same degree with ammunition,

3208
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:14,200
but because you needed lockpicks,

3209
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:16,400
multi-tools, augmentation canisters,

3210
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:17,900
medkits, skill points,

3211
01:50:17,900 --> 01:50:19,440
and other useful items to progress,

3212
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:21,360
you're always hurting for something,

3213
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:22,660
and speaking of hurting,

3214
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:24,920
even damage was part of this puzzle.

3215
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:27,380
J.C. Denton had locational limb damage,

3216
01:50:27,380 --> 01:50:28,540
a bit like in Fallout.

3217
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:30,960
Damaged limbs affected his aiming and his movement.

3218
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:32,680
If you broke your legs, you had to crawl around

3219
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:33,760
to find a medkit.

3220
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:36,300
This meant combat was extremely tense.

3221
01:50:36,300 --> 01:50:38,840
You had to manage its effects on your body.

3222
01:50:38,840 --> 01:50:40,680
Medkits didn't just bring back health.

3223
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:42,600
They had to be used on a specific body part

3224
01:50:42,620 --> 01:50:44,460
to mitigate the effects of the damage.

3225
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:46,080
Without medkits and the skill

3226
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:47,380
that makes them more effective,

3227
01:50:47,380 --> 01:50:48,420
you were in trouble,

3228
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:49,960
and the robots that healed you for free

3229
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:51,420
were few and far between.

3230
01:50:51,420 --> 01:50:54,000
This meant combat and taking damage in general

3231
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,140
had genuine stakes to it.

3232
01:50:57,140 --> 01:51:00,140
-"Denton. Hey, it's Denton."

3233
01:51:00,140 --> 01:51:01,140
Oh.

3234
01:51:01,140 --> 01:51:02,680
Lucky there's a clinic nearby.

3235
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:04,480
-"Have you looked at any other options?

3236
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:07,140
Euthanasia is one sure way to relieve suffering."

3237
01:51:07,140 --> 01:51:09,980
-"Uh, Chinese herbal nonsense is for twinks.

3238
01:51:09,980 --> 01:51:11,240
I want real medicine."

3239
01:51:11,260 --> 01:51:12,420
Human Revolution removed

3240
01:51:12,420 --> 01:51:14,040
locational limb damage completely

3241
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:16,340
and replaced it with a simple health bar,

3242
01:51:16,340 --> 01:51:18,720
which isn't the worst idea,

3243
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:21,440
and I know that because then they had the worst idea

3244
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:24,480
and went a step further and removed damage.

3245
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:26,940
If you haven't been shot for a few seconds,

3246
01:51:26,940 --> 01:51:29,360
your health just comes back.

3247
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:30,700
It seems like when they were looking

3248
01:51:30,700 --> 01:51:32,160
at other popular shooters of the day

3249
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:34,740
for inspiration for how to improve Deus Ex's combat,

3250
01:51:34,740 --> 01:51:36,700
some wires got crossed and they borrowed

3251
01:51:36,700 --> 01:51:38,660
their regenerating health mechanics too,

3252
01:51:38,660 --> 01:51:39,820
mechanics which are great

3253
01:51:39,820 --> 01:51:41,480
for combat-centric action shooters

3254
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:43,400
and terrible for ones where getting shot

3255
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:44,780
is supposed to matter.

3256
01:51:44,780 --> 01:51:47,820
One of the most important facets of combat in Deus Ex,

3257
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:50,780
the consequences of combat, is just gone.

3258
01:51:50,780 --> 01:51:52,740
If you got shot in a fight in Deus Ex,

3259
01:51:52,740 --> 01:51:55,400
it was an extra complication you had to deal with.

3260
01:51:55,400 --> 01:51:56,900
It didn't just go away.

3261
01:51:56,900 --> 01:51:59,400
It was an added incentive to make smarter choices

3262
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:01,200
than getting into a straight shootout.

3263
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:02,980
Even if you killed everyone first,

3264
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:04,660
if they shot you, it was a problem

3265
01:52:04,660 --> 01:52:05,980
you still had to deal with.

3266
01:52:05,980 --> 01:52:08,740
It made the janky combat fun to put stats in

3267
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:09,900
so that you did well in it

3268
01:52:09,900 --> 01:52:12,860
or to avoid completely using stealth or explosives.

3269
01:52:12,860 --> 01:52:15,400
Regenerating health messes with the core concept

3270
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:17,400
of choices having consequences.

3271
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:19,860
Now, once everyone's dead, your health will come back

3272
01:52:19,860 --> 01:52:21,620
while you're checking their bodies.

3273
01:52:21,620 --> 01:52:24,240
You'd think a game that wanted to instill tension

3274
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:26,820
about survival and make combat's effects matter,

3275
01:52:26,820 --> 01:52:28,540
for example, by making said bodies

3276
01:52:28,540 --> 01:52:29,620
have two bullets on them,

3277
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:31,360
would avoid misusing

3278
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:33,160
regeneration mechanics like this.

3279
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:35,160
Human Revolution's combat doesn't get to be

3280
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:37,200
as engaging as it easily could have been

3281
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:39,000
because of this boneheaded idea.

3282
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,200
The choice to remove consequences from combat

3283
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:43,460
cuts off the game's potential at its knees,

3284
01:52:43,460 --> 01:52:45,660
something you also can't do anymore.

3285
01:52:45,660 --> 01:52:47,200
If you really want to balance combat

3286
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:48,460
against stealth and hacking

3287
01:52:48,460 --> 01:52:49,780
and other alternative solutions,

3288
01:52:49,780 --> 01:52:51,740
maybe make taking damage a problem.

3289
01:52:51,740 --> 01:52:53,420
You could basically flip a switch,

3290
01:52:53,420 --> 01:52:54,880
turn off regenerating health,

3291
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:56,700
and instantly make the entire game

3292
01:52:56,700 --> 01:52:58,460
a much more fascinating puzzle.

3293
01:52:58,460 --> 01:53:00,920
Make all of its combat that much more engaging,

3294
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:02,120
more of an obstacle.

3295
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:04,620
Since all of its effects would become cumulative,

3296
01:53:04,620 --> 01:53:07,080
so many more players would be making fun decisions

3297
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:09,580
about how to engage in them or how to avoid them,

3298
01:53:09,580 --> 01:53:11,160
and healing items would matter again,

3299
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:12,760
which they don't in Human Revolution

3300
01:53:12,760 --> 01:53:15,160
because your health returns to maximum on its own.

3301
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:16,580
Why do you even have these in here?

3302
01:53:16,580 --> 01:53:19,580
Oh, they put you slightly over your maximum health.

3303
01:53:19,580 --> 01:53:21,880
Great. These items would have value

3304
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:24,300
in a world where you didn't just get all your health back?

3305
01:53:24,300 --> 01:53:26,620
Jesus Christ. This affects energy too.

3306
01:53:26,620 --> 01:53:28,460
In the original and Invisible War,

3307
01:53:28,460 --> 01:53:31,000
you required energy to use augmentations.

3308
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,720
This made energy cells into a valuable resource,

3309
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:35,420
and it's clear in this game that someone

3310
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:36,840
had their head screwed on properly

3311
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:38,800
and wanted them to be like that here too

3312
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:40,260
because there's candy bars everywhere

3313
01:53:40,260 --> 01:53:42,640
that refill one or more batteries of energy,

3314
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:44,300
but whoever that genius was,

3315
01:53:44,300 --> 01:53:46,980
someone bashed his head in and went to work in his clothes

3316
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:49,980
and decided to make energy also refill on its own.

3317
01:53:49,980 --> 01:53:52,600
The candy's useful if you want to do multiple takedowns

3318
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:54,760
in quick succession or really like using

3319
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:56,480
the cloaking device for long periods,

3320
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:58,680
but the fact you have practically infinite energy

3321
01:53:58,680 --> 01:54:00,260
as long as you're willing to wait a second

3322
01:54:00,260 --> 01:54:03,720
means there's no real economy to using augmentations.

3323
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:05,800
The health and energy pickups feel like

3324
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:08,640
vestigial remains of a much more engaging version

3325
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:10,640
of this game where these things mattered.

3326
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:12,300
I think this stuff is a bit of a shame,

3327
01:54:12,300 --> 01:54:14,380
but bear in mind it's not that bad.

3328
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:17,380
The core experience still works really well so far.

3329
01:54:17,380 --> 01:54:19,340
Sure, the scarcity can be a little annoying.

3330
01:54:19,340 --> 01:54:20,720
The police forgot to bring bullets

3331
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:24,060
to a hostage situation or out on patrol or back at base.

3332
01:54:24,060 --> 01:54:26,480
Your boss can only afford to give you one gun.

3333
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:28,600
He's a millionaire, but the store would only sell him

3334
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:31,060
seven darts for the tranquilizer gun you asked for,

3335
01:54:31,060 --> 01:54:32,900
and two of the coolest guns in the game

3336
01:54:32,900 --> 01:54:34,760
don't fucking exist.

3337
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:36,600
Oh, but thanks to my acts of heroism,

3338
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:40,100
I have a very slight discount on those stun gun darts

3339
01:54:40,100 --> 01:54:42,100
I can buy literally six of.

3340
01:54:42,100 --> 01:54:45,060
Yeah, that really helps. Thank you.

3341
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:47,560
But at least the intended effect works.

3342
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:49,100
You're making careful choices.

3343
01:54:49,100 --> 01:54:50,600
You're having fun.

3344
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:53,600
Then you find a rocket launcher hidden in gang territory

3345
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:54,940
with two rockets.

3346
01:54:54,940 --> 01:54:56,560
If you're in a fight with a large group

3347
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:58,860
or a big robot, this can change everything,

3348
01:54:58,860 --> 01:55:00,940
but you can only fit it in your inventory

3349
01:55:00,940 --> 01:55:02,980
if you throw a bunch of other stuff away.

3350
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,700
This is a great little decision

3351
01:55:04,700 --> 01:55:06,380
to offer the player in a game like this.

3352
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:08,120
You have to make a tactical decision

3353
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:10,220
and become even weaker in regular fights

3354
01:55:10,220 --> 01:55:12,180
in the hopes of having an edge in a big one.

3355
01:55:12,180 --> 01:55:13,800
Moments like this are the secret

3356
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:15,220
to what makes these games fun,

3357
01:55:15,220 --> 01:55:17,260
feeling confronted with possibilities

3358
01:55:17,260 --> 01:55:18,600
and what to do about them.

3359
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:21,300
If there's a key Deus Ex thing you have to nail,

3360
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:22,300
it's this.

3361
01:55:22,300 --> 01:55:24,440
Does the player feel a little bit nervous

3362
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:27,400
when they find a cool weapon they don't have room for?

3363
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:28,700
Then a level or so later,

3364
01:55:28,700 --> 01:55:30,120
you're sneaking into a secret base,

3365
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:31,700
and there's a huge robot in the way.

3366
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:32,920
Normally, you'd be in trouble here

3367
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:34,180
and have to run and hide,

3368
01:55:34,180 --> 01:55:35,460
but because of the consequences

3369
01:55:35,460 --> 01:55:37,500
of your cool decision, you don't have to.

3370
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:40,020
This is your reward for good planning.

3371
01:55:40,020 --> 01:55:41,020
["Dead Man's Lair"]

3372
01:55:41,020 --> 01:55:42,020
["Dead Man's Lair"]

3373
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:43,020
["Dead Man's Lair"]

3374
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:44,020
["Dead Man's Lair"]

3375
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:45,020
["Dead Man's Lair"]

3376
01:55:45,020 --> 01:55:46,020
["Dead Man's Lair"]

3377
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:47,020
["Dead Man's Lair"]

3378
01:55:47,020 --> 01:55:48,020
["Dead Man's Lair"]

3379
01:55:48,020 --> 01:55:49,020
["Dead Man's Lair"]

3380
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:50,020
["Dead Man's Lair"]

3381
01:55:50,020 --> 01:55:51,020
["Dead Man's Lair"]

3382
01:55:51,020 --> 01:55:52,860
Choice and consequences.

3383
01:55:52,860 --> 01:55:55,520
That's the beating heart of Deus Ex.

3384
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:57,660
Well, it should be.

3385
01:55:57,660 --> 01:55:58,820
You see, I lied.

3386
01:55:58,820 --> 01:56:00,740
I didn't use this rocket launcher I found.

3387
01:56:00,780 --> 01:56:02,080
I got this one from right here,

3388
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:03,960
sitting right next to the fucking robot.

3389
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:06,780
The developers almost made a game

3390
01:56:06,780 --> 01:56:08,780
with decisions and consequences,

3391
01:56:08,780 --> 01:56:10,340
and then they didn't.

3392
01:56:10,340 --> 01:56:11,880
They made a game that handholds you

3393
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:13,380
through every obstacle.

3394
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:16,260
Robots are also easily destroyed by EMP grenades.

3395
01:56:16,260 --> 01:56:18,920
Having to save your EMP grenades for tough situations

3396
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:21,640
would make them really rewarding to use, wouldn't it?

3397
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:23,420
But what if people forgot to bring any

3398
01:56:23,420 --> 01:56:25,260
and wanted to use one on the robot?

3399
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:27,840
So they put one directly in front of you

3400
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:29,480
as soon as you entered the room.

3401
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:31,880
This...fucking sucks.

3402
01:56:31,880 --> 01:56:33,420
There's no other way of saying it.

3403
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:34,840
They fucked up.

3404
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:37,440
It's obviously really important for the game

3405
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:40,560
that it's not incredibly easy to defeat enemies.

3406
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:43,680
If we give you everything,

3407
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:47,100
you're not gonna think anymore.

3408
01:56:49,900 --> 01:56:52,360
Not only is this room just not a challenge,

3409
01:56:52,360 --> 01:56:55,440
you gain access to a means of instantly killing this robot

3410
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:58,080
the literal actual moment you enter the room

3411
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:00,500
In this instant,

3412
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:03,460
players will realize their choices don't matter.

3413
01:57:03,460 --> 01:57:05,340
If you saved that rocket launcher,

3414
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:08,800
you wasted your time, effort, and inventory space.

3415
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:10,920
You were a sucker who thought they were going

3416
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:13,520
to experience some kind of reward or punishment

3417
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,720
for your decision making, but you never will.

3418
01:57:15,720 --> 01:57:17,860
This goes on for the entire game.

3419
01:57:17,860 --> 01:57:19,360
The next time you fight these robots,

3420
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:21,240
the rocket launcher's right fucking there.

3421
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:22,860
The EMP grenades are right there.

3422
01:57:22,860 --> 01:57:24,660
People complained about the boss fights

3423
01:57:24,660 --> 01:57:27,240
being just shooting focused and therefore a problem

3424
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:28,700
for players who focused on stealth,

3425
01:57:28,700 --> 01:57:29,740
but that's just not true.

3426
01:57:29,740 --> 01:57:31,120
Every boss fight takes place

3427
01:57:31,120 --> 01:57:32,860
in an ocean of weapons and ammo

3428
01:57:32,860 --> 01:57:34,780
so the player can't possibly get stuck.

3429
01:57:34,780 --> 01:57:37,320
All the stuff I said was fun is still fun,

3430
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:38,940
but the most important moments,

3431
01:57:38,940 --> 01:57:41,580
the peaks of the mountain of risk and reward,

3432
01:57:41,580 --> 01:57:42,740
have been eliminated.

3433
01:57:42,740 --> 01:57:44,740
Mummy bird chewed your dinner for you.

3434
01:57:44,740 --> 01:57:45,740
Open wide.

3435
01:57:45,740 --> 01:57:47,580
If you're going to give me the solution

3436
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:50,380
to any interesting problem the instant I enter the room,

3437
01:57:50,380 --> 01:57:52,880
you might as well have made this a cut scene too.

3438
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:54,860
Energy unlocked.

3439
01:57:54,860 --> 01:57:57,200
Self-destruct sequence.

3440
01:57:57,200 --> 01:57:59,620
Let me give you an example

3441
01:57:59,620 --> 01:58:01,580
of how this is supposed to work.

3442
01:58:01,580 --> 01:58:04,740
Resident Evil 4.

3443
01:58:04,740 --> 01:58:08,080
In Resident Evil 4, you can find a rocket launcher.

3444
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:09,580
Just one, though.

3445
01:58:09,580 --> 01:58:11,620
Additional launchers cost a ton of the cash

3446
01:58:11,620 --> 01:58:13,380
you could have spent upgrading your weapons,

3447
01:58:13,380 --> 01:58:14,800
so while they were powerful

3448
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:16,640
and let you practically skip bosses,

3449
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:19,680
they required a meaningful sacrifice by the player,

3450
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:21,100
throwing all that money away,

3451
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:22,480
and to even carry a launcher,

3452
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:24,540
you gave up a ton of space for one shot

3453
01:58:24,540 --> 01:58:26,280
that was gone once you used it.

3454
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:28,040
Even looking at the rocket launcher

3455
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:30,000
in my inventory gives me tingles,

3456
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,660
and staring at it in the store is tantalizing

3457
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:35,260
because it's a choice with meaningful consequences

3458
01:58:35,260 --> 01:58:37,760
that doesn't condescend to the player's intelligence

3459
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:40,140
by giving them one anyway the instant they walk

3460
01:58:40,140 --> 01:58:41,600
into a room with a boss.

3461
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:43,100
You might also notice that your health

3462
01:58:43,100 --> 01:58:45,220
doesn't regenerate in Resident Evil either

3463
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:47,300
because that would be fucking stupid, wouldn't it?

3464
01:58:47,300 --> 01:58:49,560
Deus Ex worked along a similar principle.

3465
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:51,700
The GEP gun was a huge inventory hog.

3466
01:58:51,700 --> 01:58:53,660
You had to leave so many useful items

3467
01:58:53,660 --> 01:58:55,900
lying where you found them and know you'd be in trouble

3468
01:58:55,900 --> 01:58:58,320
if you needed a rebreather or some stealth camo,

3469
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:00,360
but it made fighting mechs a breeze,

3470
01:59:00,360 --> 01:59:02,620
and in a pinch, it saved you a few lockpicks.

3471
01:59:02,620 --> 01:59:05,120
That trade-off was so satisfying.

3472
01:59:05,120 --> 01:59:08,040
I'm trying to imagine a version of this game

3473
01:59:08,040 --> 01:59:10,200
where they just put a GEP gun on the floor

3474
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:11,620
near every major enemy,

3475
01:59:11,620 --> 01:59:13,620
but I don't really need to imagine it.

3476
01:59:13,620 --> 01:59:15,580
Now do I? To make a Deus Ex game

3477
01:59:15,580 --> 01:59:17,380
where whenever you face a tough enemy,

3478
01:59:17,380 --> 01:59:19,380
the means of killing it is right next to it

3479
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:21,000
and if it even manages to hurt you,

3480
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,620
that health just comes back,

3481
01:59:22,620 --> 01:59:24,920
you have completely removed the choices,

3482
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:27,620
consequences, and even most of the difficulty

3483
01:59:27,620 --> 01:59:28,620
from your game.

3484
01:59:28,620 --> 01:59:30,300
There's a version of Human Revolution

3485
01:59:30,300 --> 01:59:31,840
that's truly incredible

3486
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:33,960
where it doesn't pull any of its punches,

3487
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:36,460
where saving a rocket launcher made a huge difference,

3488
01:59:36,460 --> 01:59:38,100
where coping with the loss of resources

3489
01:59:38,100 --> 01:59:39,600
once you used them was interesting,

3490
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:41,920
where getting shot actually hurt,

3491
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:44,600
and they almost made that game,

3492
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:46,260
and it's really kind of sad

3493
01:59:46,260 --> 01:59:48,520
that they made a just okay one instead

3494
01:59:48,540 --> 01:59:50,540
because they compromised their own design

3495
01:59:50,540 --> 01:59:52,040
in the moments it mattered most,

3496
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:54,420
they made a game about scarcity of resources,

3497
01:59:54,420 --> 01:59:57,220
and then got scared not everyone would like that

3498
01:59:57,220 --> 01:59:59,540
and overcorrected in the other direction.

3499
01:59:59,540 --> 02:00:02,100
Playing Human Revolution is an exercise in learning

3500
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:06,340
in real time why Deus Ex was a more management kind of game

3501
02:00:06,340 --> 02:00:08,760
and why simplifying everything about an experience

3502
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:11,680
that's fun because it's a bit complicated is bad.

3503
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:12,900
Oh, it's so rewarding.

3504
02:00:12,900 --> 02:00:15,100
You can stealth your way over to this panel

3505
02:00:15,100 --> 02:00:16,860
and hack it and disable the robots.

3506
02:00:16,860 --> 02:00:18,520
Wow, there's alternative solutions to that.

3507
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:20,900
They fucking give you a grenade that kills them instantly.

3508
02:00:20,900 --> 02:00:23,120
It's incredibly fun to get to plan ahead

3509
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:24,780
and decide what's important to you

3510
02:00:24,780 --> 02:00:28,040
and most importantly, actually see these choices play out

3511
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:29,460
for better or for worse.

3512
02:00:29,460 --> 02:00:32,500
Nothing in Human Revolution is ever important.

3513
02:00:32,500 --> 02:00:34,460
All the edges have been sanded off.

3514
02:00:34,460 --> 02:00:36,620
It's a smooth and palatable pebble

3515
02:00:36,620 --> 02:00:38,500
that isn't particularly disagreeable

3516
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:41,500
but slides out the other end completely undigested.

3517
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:44,420
You have failed to make a game about scarcity of resources

3518
02:00:44,420 --> 02:00:45,800
if you put all those resources

3519
02:00:45,820 --> 02:00:47,740
next to the things you need them for.

3520
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:49,280
At that point, you've made a game

3521
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:51,960
about how thinking was a waste of time.

3522
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:54,160
As soon as you realize you're going to be handed

3523
02:00:54,160 --> 02:00:56,500
the solution to the problem once you encounter it,

3524
02:00:56,500 --> 02:00:58,840
the depth of the experience drains away

3525
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:00,260
before your very eyes,

3526
02:01:00,260 --> 02:01:03,100
and to do this after removing a bunch of the weapons

3527
02:01:03,100 --> 02:01:05,140
means the game is so much more dull

3528
02:01:05,140 --> 02:01:07,840
and devoid of stuff to play with than it could have been

3529
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:10,440
in service to a scarcity that went out the window

3530
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:12,980
the instant the player actually needed anything.

3531
02:01:12,980 --> 02:01:15,400
No, if you want to play with cool weapons,

3532
02:01:15,420 --> 02:01:18,380
you need to have pre-ordered the game in 2011.

3533
02:01:18,380 --> 02:01:20,880
No, that's not a joke. That's an order.

3539

If you pre-ordered Human Revolution from GameStop

or Game, GameStation, or HMV in the UK...

3541
02:01:44,280 --> 02:01:47,700
you got the Explosive Mission Pack.

3542
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:51,820
This pack lets the player start with a new type of grenade,

3543
02:01:51,820 --> 02:01:53,500
remote explosives that detonate

3544
02:01:53,500 --> 02:01:55,540
when you hold the grenade button down after throwing them,

3545
02:01:55,540 --> 02:01:57,660
and a bonus mission towards the end of the game

3546
02:01:57,660 --> 02:01:59,380
that rewards you with a new weapon.

3547
02:01:59,380 --> 02:02:00,540
But that's not all.

3548
02:02:00,540 --> 02:02:02,340
If the player bought the game from Amazon,

3549
02:02:02,340 --> 02:02:03,760
Best Buy, or Walmart,

02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:06,000
they got the Tactical Enhancement Pack.

3551
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,600
With this pack, players start with two new weapons,

3552
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:11,480
a double-barreled shotgun, and a silenced sniper rifle.

3553
02:02:11,480 --> 02:02:13,140
If you were wondering why you couldn't use

3554
02:02:13,140 --> 02:02:15,100
a silencer upgrade on the sniper rifle,

3555
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:17,140
it's not because that would be an unbalanced weapon

3556
02:02:17,140 --> 02:02:18,300
and the designers knew better.

3557
02:02:18,300 --> 02:02:20,720
It's because you didn't buy the game from Walmart.

3558
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:23,100
The executives at Square Enix are killing us.

3559

We're dying. Help us, please.

3561
02:02:28,360 --> 02:02:30,060
This pack also lets you start the game

3562
02:02:30,060 --> 02:02:31,280
with a ton of extra money,

3563
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:34,360
which is the funniest possible thing to give people

3564
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:36,020
when they have a limited amount of things

3565
02:02:36,020 --> 02:02:37,440
they're allowed to buy.

3566
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:38,440
What the fuck?

3567
02:02:38,440 --> 02:02:42,000
I'll try to be, uh, as, uh, specific as I can,

3568
02:02:42,020 --> 02:02:44,020
meaning that I won't say too much,

3569
02:02:44,020 --> 02:02:46,020
uh, because the marketing guys over there

3570
02:02:46,020 --> 02:02:47,020
are watching over me.

3571
02:02:47,020 --> 02:02:48,020
They're right here.

3572
02:02:48,020 --> 02:02:50,480
And I feel the pressure of, uh,

3573
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:52,240
being careful about what I say.

3574
02:02:52,240 --> 02:02:55,160
These bonuses eventually became purchasable as DLC.

3575
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:56,660
After a few months, they effectively

3576
02:02:56,660 --> 02:02:58,280
became microtransactions.

3577
02:02:58,280 --> 02:03:00,360
The Explosive Mission Pack also gives the player

3578
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:02,500
an automatic unlocking device,

3579
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:05,420
which you can use to skip a single hacking minigame.

3580

02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:09,220
that Human Revolution's hacking is so bad,

3582
02:03:09,220 --> 02:03:11,760
people paid actual money to skip it.

3583
02:03:11,820 --> 02:03:13,600
The pack's extra level is a crime

3584
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:15,280
against Deus Ex canon,

3585
02:03:15,280 --> 02:03:17,860

the cops instantly arrive

3687
02:07:09,160 --> 02:07:10,660
and all the enemies in the level evaporate

3688
02:07:10,660 --> 02:07:12,160
and get replaced by cops

3689
02:07:12,160 --> 02:07:14,660
or how you fight exactly three augmented bosses

3690
02:07:14,660 --> 02:07:17,160
throughout the game, a big guy, a small lady,

3691
02:07:17,160 --> 02:07:19,160
and a guy who can turn invisible

3692
02:07:19,160 --> 02:07:20,660
and wields a plasma rifle

3693
02:07:20,660 --> 02:07:22,660
or the way the game's three main locations

3694
02:07:22,660 --> 02:07:24,660
are an American city, a Chinese city,

3695
02:07:24,660 --> 02:07:25,660
and a French city

3696
02:07:25,660 --> 02:07:26,660
although Human Revolution

3697
02:07:26,660 --> 02:07:28,160

3698
02:07:28,160 --> 02:07:29,660
for what I assume are tax reasons

3699
02:07:29,660 --> 02:07:32,160
and the city environment itself got cut

3700
02:07:32,160 --> 02:07:34,660
so Montreal is just a large office building

3701

the generally good reception of Human Revolution

3705
02:07:42,660 --> 02:07:44,660
was partially down to them directly recreating

3706
02:07:44,660 --> 02:07:46,160
a lot of the original's stuff.

3707
02:07:46,160 --> 02:07:48,660

02:07:48,660 --> 02:07:52,160
almost act for act, story beat for story beat.

3709
02:07:52,160 --> 02:07:54,160
I'm wondering how much you feel

3710
02:07:54,160 --> 02:07:56,660
that contributed to the acceptance of it.

3711
02:07:56,660 --> 02:07:58,160
First off, I'd like to react to your comment

3712
02:07:58,160 --> 02:08:00,660
that the game follows the first game beat by beat.

3713
02:08:00,660 --> 02:08:02,160
It might be true.

3714
02:08:02,160 --> 02:08:03,660
It wasn't our intention.

3715
02:08:03,660 --> 02:08:05,160
It's not how we designed the game.

3716
02:08:05,160 --> 02:08:06,660
It's not how it was written.

3717
02:08:06,660 --> 02:08:09,160
So if that's the case, it's a coincidence.

3718
02:08:09,160 --> 02:08:10,660
I don't know if it's better or worse

3719
02:08:10,660 --> 02:08:12,660
the game was like this by accident

3720
02:08:12,660 --> 02:08:14,160
but that's what the game is like

3721
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:15,660
so I don't know what to tell you.

3722
02:08:15,660 --> 02:08:17,160
It's not a huge deal that they're similar.

3723
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:18,660
It's the same series,

3724
02:08:18,660 --> 02:08:20,160
so similarities are welcome if anything,

3725
02:08:20,160 --> 02:08:23,160
but a problem with, accidentally or otherwise,

3726
02:08:23,160 --> 02:08:25,160
making your levels a lot like the originals

3727
02:08:25,160 --> 02:08:27,160
is it makes what's missing stick out

3728
02:08:27,160 --> 02:08:29,660
like a giant robot sitting next to the weapon

3729
02:08:29,660 --> 02:08:31,160
that instantly kills it.

3730
02:08:31,160 --> 02:08:33,660
Liberty Island is a famously amazing level.

3731
02:08:33,660 --> 02:08:36,660
It's an entire open island with two different docks,

3732
02:08:36,660 --> 02:08:39,660
people to talk to to get a key to get inside if you want.

3733
02:08:39,660 --> 02:08:41,160
About time you sh**.

3734
02:08:41,160 --> 02:08:43,160
A sunken freighter full of stuff to find,

3735
02:08:43,160 --> 02:08:44,660
and of course an entire building

3736
02:08:44,660 --> 02:08:46,160
leading up into the Statue of Liberty.

3737
02:08:46,160 --> 02:08:48,160
This level design is ultimately

3738
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:50,660
why Deus Ex is so fantastic.

3739
02:08:50,660 --> 02:08:52,660
It feels like an entire physical space

3740
02:08:52,660 --> 02:08:54,160
you can handle how you want.

3741
02:08:54,160 --> 02:08:56,660
Liberty Island is 12 different levels

3742
02:08:56,660 --> 02:08:58,660
depending on how someone plays it.

3743
02:08:58,660 --> 02:09:01,160
Human Revolution's levels are largely a straight line

3744
02:09:01,160 --> 02:09:03,660
that sometimes opens out into a larger box

3745
02:09:03,660 --> 02:09:05,160
you can be a little more creative in

3746
02:09:05,160 --> 02:09:07,660
which funnels right back into another straight line.

3747
02:09:07,660 --> 02:09:10,160
The first mission, the parallel with Liberty Island,

3748
02:09:10,160 --> 02:09:12,660
is a straight shot from the drop-off point on a rooftop

3749
02:09:12,660 --> 02:09:14,660
to a pickup on another rooftop

3750
02:09:14,660 --> 02:09:16,660
featuring bottlenecks in the form of corridors

3751
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:18,660
and elevators that you're required to use

3752
02:09:18,660 --> 02:09:21,660
to progress with zero alternatives.

3753
02:09:21,660 --> 02:09:23,660
Compare and contrast the level of freedom here.

3754
02:09:23,660 --> 02:09:25,660
The Statue of Liberty has several ways in

3755
02:09:25,660 --> 02:09:27,660
from different angles including just climbing

3756
02:09:27,660 --> 02:09:29,160
over half the level.

3757
02:09:29,160 --> 02:09:30,660
To get into the warehouse, you can go in

3758
02:09:30,660 --> 02:09:32,660
through the front door or climb up on top

3759
02:09:32,660 --> 02:09:34,660
of the entrance and go in through a vent

3760
02:09:34,660 --> 02:09:36,660
just above the front door which comes out

3761
02:09:36,660 --> 02:09:39,660
into the other side of the same room.

3762
02:09:39,660 --> 02:09:41,660
It takes about five seconds to walk over here

3763
02:09:41,660 --> 02:09:43,660
if you come in from the front entrance.

3764
02:09:43,660 --> 02:09:45,160
There is no rear entrance,

3765
02:09:45,160 --> 02:09:47,160
and there's no way over this part of the level

3766
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:48,660
by getting on the plant's roof

3767
02:09:48,660 --> 02:09:50,160
and finding another entryway.

3768
02:09:50,160 --> 02:09:52,660
It's immediately clear how much less freedom

3769
02:09:52,660 --> 02:09:53,660
the player has.

3770
02:09:53,660 --> 02:09:55,160
There are choices in how to navigate,

3771
02:09:55,160 --> 02:09:56,660
but they don't lead anywhere

3772
02:09:56,660 --> 02:09:58,660
particularly new or different.

3773
02:09:58,660 --> 02:10:00,660
The only way to progress is to traverse the level

3774
02:10:00,660 --> 02:10:02,660
mostly linearly, but occasionally,

3775
02:10:02,660 --> 02:10:05,660
you get to decide which side of the room you do it in.

3776
02:10:05,660 --> 02:10:08,160
The smoking gun betraying the closed-off nature

3777
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:11,160
of the levels is the fact none of the windows work.

3778
02:10:11,160 --> 02:10:15,660
In Deus Ex 1, if a building has a window,

3779
02:10:15,660 --> 02:10:17,660
you can break the window and jump out.

3780
02:10:17,660 --> 02:10:19,660
Bang, you just invented a new exit.

3781
02:10:19,660 --> 02:10:22,160
In many of Human Revolution's buildings,

3782
02:10:22,160 --> 02:10:24,160
most of the windows are actually painted on

3783
02:10:24,160 --> 02:10:26,160
and you can't get out through them in any way.

3784
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:28,160
In an actual immersive sim,

3785
02:10:28,160 --> 02:10:30,160
this would be a way in and out of the building.

3786
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:32,160
That's what makes it immersive.

3787
02:10:32,160 --> 02:10:34,160
It feels like a building in a world.

3788
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:36,160
This is just a rectangular corridor

3789
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:39,660
with windows used to imply a complicated outside world

3790
02:10:39,660 --> 02:10:41,160
you never get to interact with.

3791
02:10:41,160 --> 02:10:43,160
Look at Jensen's apartment for a second.

3792
02:10:43,160 --> 02:10:45,160
The modern graphics definitely make it look

3793
02:10:45,160 --> 02:10:46,660
cooler than the original.

3794
02:10:46,660 --> 02:10:49,160
I love the Blade Runner light shaft thing with the blinds,

3795
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:50,660
but in the original game's apartment,

3796
02:10:50,660 --> 02:10:52,660
you don't need to come in through the front door.

3797
02:10:52,660 --> 02:10:55,160
You can climb up a fire escape and come in through the window.

3798
02:10:55,160 --> 02:10:57,660
Jensen's apartment is designed to reference the original.

3799
02:10:57,660 --> 02:11:00,160
It's got a cute stash of loot hidden in a similar way,

3800
02:11:00,160 --> 02:11:01,660
but it doesn't seem to understand

3801
02:11:01,660 --> 02:11:04,660
the actual gameplay value of the original apartment's design.

3802
02:11:04,660 --> 02:11:06,660
The only way out is to get to the elevator,

3803
02:11:06,660 --> 02:11:09,660
ride it down, then walk out through the front door.

3804
02:11:09,660 --> 02:11:11,660
The windows are just for show.

3805
02:11:11,660 --> 02:11:14,160
I've heard so much praise for this game over the years,

3806
02:11:14,160 --> 02:11:16,160
how it's one of the best immersive sims,

3807
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:18,160
a real successor to Deus Ex,

3808
02:11:18,160 --> 02:11:19,660
but for all the genuine improvements

3809
02:11:19,660 --> 02:11:21,660
and understandable mechanical changes,

3810
02:11:21,660 --> 02:11:24,660
the levels you're doing it in are restrictive and dull.

3811
02:11:24,660 --> 02:11:27,160
So much of the game is effectively a linear path

3812
02:11:27,160 --> 02:11:30,660
which leads to an elevator to the next linear path.

3813
02:11:30,660 --> 02:11:32,160
Seriously, there are so many areas

3814
02:11:32,160 --> 02:11:35,160
whose main objective is to get to an elevator.

3815
02:11:35,160 --> 02:11:37,160
There's a part in Hengsha where you do a whole level

3816
02:11:37,160 --> 02:11:38,660
to get to an elevator,

3817
02:11:38,660 --> 02:11:40,160
and then while you're in the elevator,

3818
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:42,160
Pritchard calls you to give you your next objective.

3819
02:11:42,160 --> 02:11:44,660
Pritchard, I'm in an elevator leading to the bangoo.

3820
02:11:44,660 --> 02:11:46,660
Look for a second elevator once you're there.

3821
02:11:46,660 --> 02:11:49,160
The game is so fond of making elevators

3822
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:51,160
the path to the next area that there is not one,

3823
02:11:51,160 --> 02:11:53,160
not two, but five sequences

3824
02:11:53,160 --> 02:11:56,160
where you go on a really long, slow elevator ride

3825
02:11:56,160 --> 02:11:58,160
and if you're lucky, something interesting

3826
02:11:58,160 --> 02:11:59,660
is happening out the window

3827
02:11:59,660 --> 02:12:01,160
or a character calls you on the phone.

3828
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:03,660
Seriously, you just sit in an elevator

3829
02:12:03,660 --> 02:12:07,160
for a full minute for no reason multiple times.

3830
02:12:07,160 --> 02:12:09,160
Once would be fine to build tension

3831
02:12:09,160 --> 02:12:10,660
before a big boss fight or something,

3832
02:12:10,660 --> 02:12:12,160
but it's near constant.

3833
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:14,160
You ride two different elevators

3834
02:12:14,160 --> 02:12:16,660

02:13:54,160 --> 02:13:56,160
than walk down a linear corridor

3885
02:13:56,160 --> 02:13:58,160
to an elevator...twice.

3886
02:13:58,160 --> 02:14:00,660
Look what an expansive world we're in.

3887
02:14:00,660 --> 02:14:01,660
The objective of this level?

3888
02:14:01,660 --> 02:14:03,660
To get to the data core room

3889
02:14:03,660 --> 02:14:05,660
by getting to the elevator.

3890
02:14:05,660 --> 02:14:07,660
Then you're given a cut scene where your objective

3891
02:14:07,660 --> 02:14:09,660
changes to confronting Zhao Yunru,

3892
02:14:09,660 --> 02:14:11,660
the CEO from before, to have that cut scene.

3893
02:14:11,660 --> 02:14:14,660
You confront her by getting to another elevator

3894
02:14:14,660 --> 02:14:15,660
to her penthouse.

3895
02:14:15,660 --> 02:14:18,160
This elevator trip takes a full minute.

3896
02:14:19,160 --> 02:14:21,160
This is only the third longest eleva-

3897
02:14:21,160 --> 02:14:23,160
The current Human Revolution speedrun

3898
02:14:23,160 --> 02:14:26,160
by Rampancy is 37 minutes long.

3899
02:14:26,160 --> 02:14:28,160
Eight and a half minutes of the run

3900
02:14:28,160 --> 02:14:30,160
is spent in an elevator.

3901
02:14:30,160 --> 02:14:33,160
Uncomfortably close to a quarter of this speedrun

3902
02:14:33,160 --> 02:14:35,160
is sitting and waiting,

3903
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:37,160
and this is the best-case scenario.

3904
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:39,160
This guy does cool shit like skip waiting

3905
02:14:39,160 --> 02:14:41,160
for that one elevator by shoving himself through the door.

3906
02:14:41,160 --> 02:14:43,160
In fact, most of the run's cleverest tricks

3907
02:14:43,160 --> 02:14:45,160
involve throwing himself through the door

3908
02:14:45,160 --> 02:14:47,160
In fact, most of the run's cleverest tricks

3909
02:14:47,160 --> 02:14:49,160
involve finding ways to avoid

3910
02:14:49,160 --> 02:14:51,160
having to wait in an elevator even longer.

3911
02:14:51,160 --> 02:14:53,160
The time wasted here isn't even the real problem.

3912
02:14:53,160 --> 02:14:55,160
Where the original game's levels

3913
02:14:55,160 --> 02:14:57,160
were usually large outdoor spaces

3914
02:14:57,160 --> 02:14:59,160
with multiple ways in and out of the buildings

3915
02:14:59,160 --> 02:15:00,160
with objectives in them,

3916
02:15:00,160 --> 02:15:02,160
encouraging player creativity

3917
02:15:02,160 --> 02:15:03,160
and freedom of choice,

3918
02:15:03,160 --> 02:15:06,160
Human Revolution is wandering between elevators

3919
02:15:06,160 --> 02:15:08,160
with ornate windows overlooking

3920
02:15:08,160 --> 02:15:09,160
the kinds of environment

3921
02:15:09,160 --> 02:15:11,160
you'd actually want to be playing in.

3922
02:15:11,160 --> 02:15:13,160
The level design still has some choice in it,

3923
02:15:13,160 --> 02:15:15,160
and occasionally the kinds of freedom

3924
02:15:15,160 --> 02:15:17,160
you'd really want like the police station,

3925
02:15:17,160 --> 02:15:19,160
which is great and offers a fantastic range of choices

3926
02:15:19,160 --> 02:15:20,160
for how to deal with it,

3927
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:21,160
but a majority of the game

3928
02:15:21,160 --> 02:15:24,160
is strangely compartmentalized, constrained,

3929
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:26,160
a thin tube funneling you

3930
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:28,160
to the next important cut scene.

3931
02:15:28,160 --> 02:15:30,160
I know I'm venting a lot about those cut scenes,

3932
02:15:30,160 --> 02:15:32,160
but this gives me an excellent opportunity

3933
02:15:32,160 --> 02:15:35,160
to segue into this game's problem with vents.

3934
02:15:35,160 --> 02:15:38,160
Okay, in this sequence I've shown you a few times before,

3935
02:15:38,160 --> 02:15:40,160
there's four guys making patrols around this area,

3936
02:15:40,160 --> 02:15:42,160
more guys off in the side halls,

3937
02:15:42,160 --> 02:15:44,160
and a doorway leading ahead to the next part of the level,

3938
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:46,160
but this area that's harder to get to unseen

3939
02:15:46,160 --> 02:15:48,160
is the room the hostages are in.

3940
02:15:48,160 --> 02:15:50,160
Once you get inside, you're locked in by a trap

3941
02:15:50,160 --> 02:15:52,160
and have to frantically disarm the bomb

3942
02:15:52,160 --> 02:15:53,160
by hacking it or learning the password

3943
02:15:53,160 --> 02:15:55,160
or just smashing the tubes,

3944
02:15:55,160 --> 02:15:57,160
which is a hilarious thing to discover you can do.

3945
02:15:57,160 --> 02:15:58,160
This is a great sequence.

3946
02:15:58,160 --> 02:16:00,160
Getting into this room and saving the hostages

3947
02:16:00,160 --> 02:16:02,160
is the first level's optional challenging

3948
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:03,160
secondary objective,

3949
02:16:03,160 --> 02:16:05,160
and the people who designed the stealth system

3950
02:16:05,160 --> 02:16:07,160
and guard patrols act like it.

3951
02:16:07,160 --> 02:16:09,160
It's much harder to stealth your way in here

3952
02:16:09,160 --> 02:16:10,160
than the critical path.

3953
02:16:10,160 --> 02:16:12,160
I mean, if you shoot all the guys,

3954
02:16:12,160 --> 02:16:13,160
it's easy and bullshit,

3955
02:16:13,160 --> 02:16:14,160
but you can see how the stealth

3956
02:16:14,160 --> 02:16:15,160
was designed to be fun,

3957
02:16:15,160 --> 02:16:17,160
so you can do all of that,

3958
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:18,160
all that fun learning the patrols

3959
02:16:18,160 --> 02:16:20,160
and carefully navigating,

3960
02:16:20,160 --> 02:16:22,160
or you can go in the vent next to the entrance to the room,

3961
02:16:22,160 --> 02:16:25,160
which leads directly into the room with the hostages.

3962
02:16:25,160 --> 02:16:28,160
Now, this first one kind of works.

3963
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:30,160
It's a reward for exploration.

3964
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:32,160
You have to find the vent hidden behind a box,

3965
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:33,160
so if you're doing this,

3966
02:16:33,160 --> 02:16:35,160
it means you chose to look around a little more

3967
02:16:35,160 --> 02:16:36,160
and get a sense of your surroundings.

3968
02:16:36,160 --> 02:16:38,160
I'm not a big fan of how the vent

3969
02:16:38,160 --> 02:16:40,160
is a definitive solution to the problem, though.

3970
02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:43,160
In Deus Ex, vents were like vents.

3971
02:16:43,160 --> 02:16:44,160
You could use them to your advantage,

3972
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:46,160
but they never took you directly

3973
02:16:46,160 --> 02:16:47,160
from the start of the room

3974
02:16:47,160 --> 02:16:49,160
to the place you needed to go to win.

3975
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:50,160
In the subway, for example,

3976
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:52,160
to free the hostages using stealth,

3977
02:16:52,160 --> 02:16:53,160
you had to find a vent

3978
02:16:53,160 --> 02:16:54,160
and then meticulously crawl through

3979
02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:56,160
an entire ventilation system

3980
02:16:56,160 --> 02:16:57,160
and come out of the right one

3981
02:16:57,160 --> 02:16:59,160
so you wouldn't get seen instantly.

3982
02:16:59,160 --> 02:17:01,160
The vents were part of the challenge,

3983
02:17:01,160 --> 02:17:02,160
not the solution.

3984
02:17:02,160 --> 02:17:04,160
In this game, more often than not,

3985
02:17:04,160 --> 02:17:07,160
vents take you directly past the problem.

3986
02:17:07,160 --> 02:17:09,160
You could deal with the guys in the next area

3987
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:11,160
using stealth or combat,

3988
02:17:11,160 --> 02:17:13,160
or you can go in the vent next to where you came in

3989
02:17:13,160 --> 02:17:14,160
that takes you past them.

3990
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:15,160
You could.

3991
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:16,160
Oh, fucking hell, guys.

3992
02:17:16,160 --> 02:17:17,160
You see the vent here

3993
02:17:17,160 --> 02:17:18,160
before you even see the thing

3994
02:17:18,160 --> 02:17:19,160
the vent takes you past.

3995
02:17:19,160 --> 02:17:21,160
You could deal with this turret

3996
02:17:21,160 --> 02:17:22,160
and landmine on the wall

3997
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:24,160
and camera which will set off the alarms

3998
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:26,160
or go over here and hack the camera.

3999
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:28,160
You know, the intended challenge of the room.

4000
02:17:28,160 --> 02:17:29,160
The point of this room is to show you

4001
02:17:29,160 --> 02:17:30,160
the value of hacking.

4002
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:32,160
Or you could get in the vent

4003
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:33,160
that leads directly behind all of it

4004
02:17:33,160 --> 02:17:35,160
and just walk past.

4005
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:36,160
If being able to kill everyone

4006
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:38,160
easily hurt the game's design,

4007
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:39,160
being able to just get in a vent

4008
02:17:39,160 --> 02:17:40,160
and go past all of it

4009
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:42,160
fucking executes it behind the woodshed.

4010
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:44,160
Look, maybe I'm smarter than the average gang

4011
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:46,160
of anti-augmentation terrorists,

4012
02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:48,160
but whoever set this shit up

4013
02:17:48,160 --> 02:17:49,160
must have seen the vent, right?

4014
02:17:49,160 --> 02:17:50,160
Wait a second.

4015
02:17:50,160 --> 02:17:52,160
Why didn't the hostages just go in the vent?

4016
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:53,160
Just leave through the vent.

4017
02:17:53,160 --> 02:17:54,160
What the fuck are you doing?

4018
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:55,160
This is how,

4019
02:17:55,160 --> 02:17:57,160
and I'm going to make a conservative estimate,

4020
02:17:57,160 --> 02:18:00,160
85,000% of the game's levels work.

4021
02:18:00,160 --> 02:18:01,160
There's this one level in Hengsha

4022
02:18:01,160 --> 02:18:03,160
where the bad guys have locked down

4023
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:04,160
an apartment complex

4024
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:05,160
and you have to get inside

4025
02:18:05,160 --> 02:18:06,160
to get to the hacker's computer

4026
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:07,160
I mentioned before.

4027
02:18:07,160 --> 02:18:09,160
Now, the front entrance is blocked off,

4028
02:18:09,160 --> 02:18:11,160
so you either have to get into a big fight right away

4029
02:18:11,160 --> 02:18:13,160
or maybe you can go all the way around the sides

4030
02:18:13,160 --> 02:18:14,160
and up a ladder

4031
02:18:14,160 --> 02:18:16,160
and then you can sneakily take out a few guys

4032
02:18:16,160 --> 02:18:17,160
and use stealth from there.

4033
02:18:17,160 --> 02:18:18,160
Wow, multiple paths.

4034
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:19,160
This level's pretty good.

4035
02:18:19,160 --> 02:18:21,160
The developers are trying to reward you

4036
02:18:21,160 --> 02:18:23,160
for thinking logically about the 3D space

4037
02:18:23,160 --> 02:18:24,160
or there's a vent right here.

4038
02:18:24,160 --> 02:18:26,160
This vent takes you inside the complex

4039
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:28,160
and into a well-guarded area

4040
02:18:28,160 --> 02:18:29,160
with some interesting points of cover.

4041
02:18:29,160 --> 02:18:31,160
This area could be a really cool stealth experience.

4042
02:18:31,160 --> 02:18:33,160
Oh, my God, I can't believe you found another vent.

4043
02:18:33,160 --> 02:18:35,160
You're such a good boy.

4044
02:18:35,160 --> 02:18:37,160
This vent takes you to the upper ground level

4045
02:18:37,160 --> 02:18:39,160
you could have had a fun time sneaking to

4046
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:41,160
where you can easily just walk to the elevator

4047
02:18:41,160 --> 02:18:43,160
to the top floor without being seen.

4048
02:18:43,160 --> 02:18:44,160
On the top floor, you...

4049
02:18:44,160 --> 02:18:45,160
Holy shit!

4050
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:47,160
I haven't even left the elevator!

4051
02:18:47,160 --> 02:18:48,160
Fucking come on, guys!

4052
02:18:48,160 --> 02:18:50,160
This vent takes you past all the guards

4053
02:18:50,160 --> 02:18:53,160
to directly next to the computer you need to access.

4054
02:18:53,160 --> 02:18:56,160
This is the absolute bottom of the downward spiral

4055
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:58,160
that starts when you try to make a game

4056
02:18:58,160 --> 02:18:59,160
like Deus Ex simpler.

4057
02:18:59,160 --> 02:19:02,160
You make this how exploration works

4058
02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:03,160
and if you go in the other side,

4059
02:19:03,160 --> 02:19:05,160
the alternative way in I mentioned,

4060
02:19:05,160 --> 02:19:07,160
you know where it leads?

4061
02:19:07,160 --> 02:19:08,160
To a vent.

4062
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:10,160
The vent takes you up the same elevator shaft

4063
02:19:10,160 --> 02:19:13,160
to a vent that comes out next to the other vent.

4064
02:19:13,160 --> 02:19:15,160
This is anti-level design.

4065
02:19:15,160 --> 02:19:17,160
You're literally skipping most of the levels

4066
02:19:17,160 --> 02:19:18,160
that were designed.

4067
02:19:18,160 --> 02:19:20,160
I've basically just ruined the game for you.

4068
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:22,160
Once you realize that's how they're using vents,

4069
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:23,160
you can't stop seeing it.

4070
02:19:23,160 --> 02:19:25,160
If you fail the dialogue challenge

4071
02:19:25,160 --> 02:19:26,160
to get an audience with Tong,

4072
02:19:26,160 --> 02:19:28,160
you have to come back and try again

4073
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:29,160
to find out what he knows,

4074
02:19:29,160 --> 02:19:31,160
but don't worry, pal, because,

4075
02:19:31,160 --> 02:19:33,160
and I bet this'll be a surprise to you,

4076
02:19:33,160 --> 02:19:34,160
there's a vent next to his office

4077
02:19:34,160 --> 02:19:35,160
and it triggers a cutscene

4078
02:19:35,160 --> 02:19:37,160
where you learn the same information anyway.

4079
02:19:37,160 --> 02:19:39,160
This is the quest design equivalent

4080
02:19:39,160 --> 02:19:42,160
of putting a rocket launcher next to all the hard enemies.

4081
02:19:42,160 --> 02:19:44,160
You could talk Taggart into telling you

4082
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:46,160
where Sanderval is or you'll never guess.

4083
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:47,160
You'll never fucking guess.

4084
02:19:47,160 --> 02:19:49,160
You'll never fucking guess!

4085
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:51,160
The vent drops you directly into his office

4086
02:19:51,160 --> 02:19:53,160
next to the computer with the information on it.

4087
02:19:53,160 --> 02:19:55,160
No thinking required.

4088
02:19:55,160 --> 02:19:58,160
The main challenge in this level is staying awake.

4089
02:19:59,160 --> 02:20:01,160
About time. What happened?

4090
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:04,160
You get stuck in an air duct on the way over?

4091
02:20:04,160 --> 02:20:06,160
Ha ha, yeah, good one. Fuck off, Pritchard.

4092
02:20:06,160 --> 02:20:08,160
If you think this is a good example

4093
02:20:08,160 --> 02:20:09,160
of Deus Ex level design,

4094
02:20:09,160 --> 02:20:11,160
you need to stop settling for less in life

4095
02:20:11,160 --> 02:20:12,160
before it's too late.

4096
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:15,160
You matter and you deserve better than this.

4097
02:20:15,160 --> 02:20:16,160
Every vent in Human Revolution,

4098
02:20:16,160 --> 02:20:19,160
including ones in maximum security buildings

4099
02:20:19,160 --> 02:20:21,160
that lead right to their important shit,

4100
02:20:21,160 --> 02:20:22,160
is yours to open for free

4101
02:20:22,160 --> 02:20:24,160
because locks don't exist anymore

4102
02:20:24,160 --> 02:20:26,160
and locking a vent using a keypad

4103
02:20:26,160 --> 02:20:28,160
would look really silly.

4104
02:20:28,160 --> 02:20:30,160
Some of the level designers even realized

4105
02:20:30,160 --> 02:20:32,160
they'd made the vents too easy a solution

4106
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:34,160
and started trying to hide them,

4107
02:20:34,160 --> 02:20:36,160
which doesn't work because, you know, they glow,

4108
02:20:36,160 --> 02:20:37,160
so they started trying to block them

4109
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:39,160
using heavy objects so you at least need

4110
02:20:39,160 --> 02:20:41,160
an augmentation to get to them.

4111
02:20:41,160 --> 02:20:43,160
Look how hard they had to work to get around the fact

4112
02:20:43,160 --> 02:20:46,160
they couldn't just lock the vents.

4113
02:20:46,160 --> 02:20:48,160
Why was the game built like this?

4114
02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:49,160
I don't know.

4115
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:51,160
Maybe the designers had fond memories

4116
02:20:51,160 --> 02:20:52,160
of solving problems using vents

4117
02:20:52,160 --> 02:20:54,160
in other immersive sims and concluded

4118
02:20:54,160 --> 02:20:56,160
that vents equal good game design,

4119
02:20:56,160 --> 02:20:59,160
but the point was to make a world feel interconnected

4120
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:00,160
like a real place would be

4121
02:21:00,160 --> 02:21:02,160
and make players who took the time to look around

4122
02:21:02,160 --> 02:21:04,160
feel rewarded for their ingenuity

4123
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:05,160
or attention to detail.

4124
02:21:05,160 --> 02:21:08,160
Vents weren't the only kind of secret in Deus Ex.

4125
02:21:08,160 --> 02:21:10,160
There were secrets hidden all over the place,

4126
02:21:10,160 --> 02:21:12,160
buttons hidden behind innocuous objects

4127
02:21:12,160 --> 02:21:14,160
that unlock treasure troves of stuff,

4128
02:21:14,160 --> 02:21:15,160
or maybe the pinball machine

4129
02:21:15,160 --> 02:21:17,160
you've seen over half a dozen of already

4130
02:21:17,160 --> 02:21:19,160
activates a secret door if you play with this one.

4131
02:21:19,160 --> 02:21:22,160
These two are both in the same level even.

4132
02:21:22,160 --> 02:21:23,160
After this happens,

4133
02:21:23,160 --> 02:21:24,160
you'll be checking every pinball machine

4134
02:21:24,160 --> 02:21:26,160
in the rest of the world just in case.

4135
02:21:26,160 --> 02:21:29,160
There is nothing remotely like this in Human Revolution

4136
02:21:29,160 --> 02:21:31,160
except for one specific thing.

4137
02:21:31,160 --> 02:21:33,160
This stuffed animal activates the secret door

4138
02:21:33,160 --> 02:21:35,160
into the hacker's man cave,

4139
02:21:35,160 --> 02:21:37,160
but it's not used to discover a secret.

4140
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:38,160
The cave is already visible

4141
02:21:38,160 --> 02:21:40,160
because the bad guys blew a wall down.

4142
02:21:40,160 --> 02:21:41,160
This makes for some really cool

4143
02:21:41,160 --> 02:21:42,160
environmental storytelling though.

4144
02:21:42,160 --> 02:21:44,160
The Mercs couldn't find the way

4145
02:21:44,160 --> 02:21:45,160
of opening the secret entrance,

4146
02:21:45,160 --> 02:21:47,160
so they had to redecorate.

4147
02:21:47,160 --> 02:21:49,160
It's funny, but serious question.

4148
02:21:49,160 --> 02:21:52,160
Why aren't there any actual secrets like this in the game?

4149
02:21:52,160 --> 02:21:54,160
There isn't anything even remotely as cool

4150
02:21:54,160 --> 02:21:55,160
as the pinball machine.

4151
02:21:55,160 --> 02:21:58,160
Instead, potential explorers get to say,

4152
02:21:58,160 --> 02:21:59,160
I wonder what's in this room.

4153
02:21:59,160 --> 02:22:02,160
Oh, it's a vent every few minutes.

4154
02:22:02,160 --> 02:22:03,160
This is the vent room.

4155
02:22:03,160 --> 02:22:05,160
Everyone has one of these in the future.

4156
02:22:05,160 --> 02:22:07,160
It's horribly inefficient,

4157
02:22:07,160 --> 02:22:10,160
but the powerful vent lobby won't let us change the laws.

4158
02:22:10,160 --> 02:22:11,160
The hacker's apartment is really good

4159
02:22:11,160 --> 02:22:13,160
at demonstrating the blandness

4160
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:15,160
of the new simpler level design

4161
02:22:15,160 --> 02:22:17,160
because it's another accidental knockoff

4162
02:22:17,160 --> 02:22:18,160
of a level from Deus Ex I,

4163
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:20,160
this time Maggie Chow's apartment in Hong Kong.

4164
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:22,160
As soon as you look at it, the difference is clear.

4165
02:22:22,160 --> 02:22:25,160
You're not forced to hack a computer for one,

4166
02:22:25,160 --> 02:22:26,160
but you also have more choices

4167
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:28,160
for how to deal with the situation.

4168
02:22:28,160 --> 02:22:30,160
Taking the elevator or sneaking into the shaft

4169
02:22:30,160 --> 02:22:32,160
aren't the only entrances.

4170
02:22:32,160 --> 02:22:33,160
You can get in from the roof entrance

4171
02:22:33,160 --> 02:22:35,160
or, you know, blow open the skylight

4172
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:36,160
and get in that way.

4173
02:22:36,160 --> 02:22:38,160
You can also get in by platforming

4174
02:22:38,160 --> 02:22:40,160
from neighboring buildings that are easier to get into

4175
02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:42,160
and aren't guarded by mechs,

4176
02:22:42,160 --> 02:22:43,160
and once you're done, you can leave

4177
02:22:43,160 --> 02:22:45,160
by literally jumping off the roof

4178
02:22:45,160 --> 02:22:47,160
or out the window and using your cyber legs

4179
02:22:47,160 --> 02:22:48,160
to land without dying.

4180
02:22:48,160 --> 02:22:50,160
This feels like an apartment

4181
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:53,160
in a real skyline full of other buildings.

4182
02:22:53,160 --> 02:22:55,160
This feels like a corridor with a nice background

4183
02:22:55,160 --> 02:22:57,160
outside some unbreakable windows,

4184
02:22:57,160 --> 02:22:58,160
but hey, lookie here.

4185
02:22:58,160 --> 02:23:00,160
There's a balcony out there.

4186
02:23:00,160 --> 02:23:01,160
Oh, and what's this?

4187
02:23:01,160 --> 02:23:03,160
A skylight just like Maggie Chow's apartment,

4188
02:23:03,160 --> 02:23:05,160
but you can't do anything with them.

4189
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:08,160
This level has none of what made the original level

4190
02:23:08,160 --> 02:23:09,160
truly open-ended and free.

4191
02:23:09,160 --> 02:23:12,160
The skylight and balcony are just for show.

4192
02:23:12,160 --> 02:23:14,160
You come in and out of this whole area

4193
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:15,160
through one of two entryways

4194
02:23:15,160 --> 02:23:17,160
which are next to each other.

4195
02:23:17,160 --> 02:23:20,160
Sophie's choice, a vent or an elevator.

4196
02:23:20,160 --> 02:23:22,160
No, wait, there's actually a super secret way in.

4197
02:23:22,160 --> 02:23:24,160
If you stack boxes and have the high jump power,

4198
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:26,160
you can get into this higher level of the shaft

4199
02:23:26,160 --> 02:23:27,160
above the vent.

4200
02:23:27,160 --> 02:23:29,160
It leads to another vent.

4201
02:23:29,160 --> 02:23:31,160
It comes out right next to the other vents

4202
02:23:31,160 --> 02:23:32,160
and the elevator.

4203
02:23:32,160 --> 02:23:34,160
♪ ♪

4204
02:23:34,160 --> 02:23:35,160
Level design!

4205
02:23:35,160 --> 02:23:38,160
The design is so ridiculously oversimplified

4206
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:40,160
that it actually messes with the story and quests

4207
02:23:40,160 --> 02:23:43,160
the game is trying to use the levels for.

4208
02:23:43,160 --> 02:23:44,160
In the Hengsha level, for example,

4209
02:23:44,160 --> 02:23:46,160
to progress to the next mission,

4210
02:23:46,160 --> 02:23:48,160
you have to get into the employee entrance

4211
02:23:48,160 --> 02:23:49,160
of Taiyong Medical,

4212
02:23:49,160 --> 02:23:51,160
but the entrance is, guess what,

4213
02:23:51,160 --> 02:23:53,160
the only building in the universe

4214
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:55,160
that isn't locked using the same fucking keypad

4215
02:23:55,160 --> 02:23:56,160
so you can't hack it.

4216
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:59,160
The developers realized players could just leave the hub

4217
02:23:59,160 --> 02:24:01,160
and go to the next level if they knew where to go

4218
02:24:01,160 --> 02:24:03,160
so they had to reinvent the concept of the key.

4219
02:24:03,160 --> 02:24:05,160
Once the player learns that's where they have to go,

4220
02:24:05,160 --> 02:24:08,160
they're sent on a quest to find a Taiyong Medical key card

4221
02:24:08,160 --> 02:24:09,160
to get in here.

4222
02:24:09,160 --> 02:24:11,160
However, because the world map is so empty

4223
02:24:11,160 --> 02:24:13,160
and there aren't that many places to explore,

4224
02:24:13,160 --> 02:24:15,160
most players found it already by accident

4225
02:24:15,160 --> 02:24:16,160
several hours ago.

4226
02:24:16,160 --> 02:24:18,160
Well, what do you know, windmill?

4227
02:24:18,160 --> 02:24:20,160
I've already got an employee card.

4228
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:22,160
You begin the Hengsha level right outside this hotel,

4229
02:24:22,160 --> 02:24:24,160
and since most players explore the thing

4230
02:24:24,160 --> 02:24:26,160
put right in front of them, they go inside.

4231
02:24:26,160 --> 02:24:29,160
When inside, you find one of the game's four side quests,

4232
02:24:29,160 --> 02:24:31,160
so it's good they made it easy to find.

4233
02:24:31,160 --> 02:24:33,160
The key card it'll turn out you need in a few hours

4234
02:24:33,160 --> 02:24:35,160
is just sitting on a table nearby.

4235
02:24:35,160 --> 02:24:38,160
Less than a minute's walk from the start of the level,

4236
02:24:38,160 --> 02:24:41,160
you have already accidentally skipped part of it.

4237
02:24:41,160 --> 02:24:43,160
There's even a special dialogue between Jensen and Malek

4238
02:24:43,160 --> 02:24:45,160
for picking it up before you know you'll need it

4239
02:24:45,160 --> 02:24:46,160
for anything.

4240
02:24:46,160 --> 02:24:47,160
Tell me something, Malek.

4241
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:50,160
You think a smart card with a Taiyong Medical logo on it

4242
02:24:50,160 --> 02:24:52,160
will come in handy in this town?

4243
02:24:52,160 --> 02:24:54,160
Maybe. Why are you asking?

4244
02:24:54,160 --> 02:24:56,160
No reason. Just thinking ahead.

4245
02:24:56,160 --> 02:24:58,160
Hey, looks like I've accidentally beaten

4246
02:24:58,160 --> 02:25:00,160
a later quest by walking into the building

4247
02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:02,160
next to where you dropped me off, Malek.

4248
02:25:02,160 --> 02:25:03,160
Whoops.

4249
02:25:03,160 --> 02:25:05,160
Who takes their company key card out of their wallet

4250
02:25:05,160 --> 02:25:07,160
and puts it on the fucking coffee table like that?

4251
02:25:07,160 --> 02:25:08,160
What the fuck is this?

4252
02:25:08,160 --> 02:25:10,160
Now, I love the idea of being sent on a quest

4253
02:25:10,160 --> 02:25:11,160
to find a key card,

4254
02:25:11,160 --> 02:25:12,160
which you could have found way earlier.

4255
02:25:12,160 --> 02:25:15,160
That's great, but levels this simplistic

4256
02:25:15,160 --> 02:25:17,160
mean you aren't actually finding it early

4257
02:25:17,160 --> 02:25:18,160
if you're big on exploring.

4258
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:21,160
You're finding it immediately within minutes of starting

4259
02:25:21,160 --> 02:25:23,160
if you take a passing interest in your surroundings.

4260
02:25:23,160 --> 02:25:26,160
Now, let's add one extra layer of silliness to this

4261
02:25:26,160 --> 02:25:28,160
because before you find out you need that key card,

4262
02:25:28,160 --> 02:25:31,160
your mission requires you to get to Tong in the Hive.

4263
02:25:31,160 --> 02:25:33,160
To get into the Hive, you need to talk your way in

4264
02:25:33,160 --> 02:25:35,160
or bribe the guy at the door

4265
02:25:35,160 --> 02:25:38,160
or somehow gain access to someone's membership card.

4266
02:25:38,160 --> 02:25:40,160
The membership card is one floor down

4267
02:25:40,160 --> 02:25:42,160
in the same building with the other key card.

4268
02:25:42,160 --> 02:25:43,160
Why are you asking?

4269
02:25:43,160 --> 02:25:44,160
No reason.

4270
02:25:44,160 --> 02:25:46,160
Just thinking ahead.

4271
02:25:46,160 --> 02:25:50,160
A shockingly huge amount of players

4272
02:25:50,160 --> 02:25:52,160
are going to find these items long before

4273
02:25:52,160 --> 02:25:54,160
they even know what they do.

4274
02:25:54,160 --> 02:25:56,160
That's not clever sequence breaking.

4275
02:25:56,160 --> 02:25:59,160
That's a very poorly designed sequence.

4276
02:25:59,160 --> 02:26:01,160
Oh, but if you don't find the membership card

4277
02:26:01,160 --> 02:26:03,160
and don't have the money to get in, no problem.

4278
02:26:03,160 --> 02:26:05,160
There's a fucking vent around the back

4279
02:26:05,160 --> 02:26:06,160
leading right inside.

4280
02:26:06,160 --> 02:26:08,160
The more enclosed levels mean a lot of the game's

4281
02:26:08,160 --> 02:26:10,160
augmentations and abilities aren't as fun

4282
02:26:10,160 --> 02:26:12,160
as they easily could have been.

4283
02:26:12,160 --> 02:26:14,160
In Deus Ex, having the ability to fall a large distance

4284
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:17,160
without dying changed the shape of the world for you.

4285
02:26:17,160 --> 02:26:20,160
Rooftops were now exits that prevented having to deal

4286
02:26:20,160 --> 02:26:23,160
with enemies you'd have run into taking the normal way down.

4287
02:26:23,160 --> 02:26:26,160
Human Revolution's slow fall power would work the same way

4288
02:26:26,160 --> 02:26:28,160
except for the fact the levels aren't designed

4289
02:26:28,160 --> 02:26:29,160
as interesting 3D spaces,

4290
02:26:29,160 --> 02:26:32,160
so only a select few places offer this type of situation.

4291
02:26:32,160 --> 02:26:35,160
So instead, to make the augmentation more useful

4292
02:26:35,160 --> 02:26:37,160
than the design can properly accommodate,

4293
02:26:37,160 --> 02:26:39,160
long falls are added specifically for players

4294
02:26:39,160 --> 02:26:41,160
to have something to do with that power,

4295
02:26:41,160 --> 02:26:43,160
like this elevator shaft in Detroit.

4296
02:26:43,160 --> 02:26:46,160
The game is going, look, one specific place

4297
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:47,160
for you to use your powers.

4298
02:26:47,160 --> 02:26:49,160
You're so creative!

4299
02:26:49,160 --> 02:26:51,160
Instead of making a world where creative players

4300
02:26:51,160 --> 02:26:53,160
naturally benefited from having this ability.

4301
02:26:53,160 --> 02:26:56,160
There is an example of the kind of free-form use

4302
02:26:56,160 --> 02:26:58,160
of a building's height as an entrance in the game, though.

4303
02:26:58,160 --> 02:27:01,160
Unfortunately, it's in a cut scene.

4304
02:27:01,160 --> 02:27:03,160
Bell Tower break into the Alice Garden pods

4305
02:27:03,160 --> 02:27:05,160
through the ceiling once you bring the key card

4306
02:27:05,160 --> 02:27:06,160
to the hacker.

4307
02:27:06,160 --> 02:27:09,160
NPCs get to have more fun with your powers than you do.

4308
02:27:09,160 --> 02:27:12,160
You can only enter and leave this entire pod hotel

4309
02:27:12,160 --> 02:27:13,160
through the front door.

4310
02:27:13,160 --> 02:27:15,160
There is no alternative way in.

4311
02:27:15,160 --> 02:27:17,160
This is because they want you to be unable to leave

4312
02:27:17,160 --> 02:27:19,160
when these guys drop in and block off the exit,

4313
02:27:19,160 --> 02:27:21,160
forcing you to leave through, you guessed it,

4314
02:27:21,160 --> 02:27:23,160
a series of linear corridors with vents

4315
02:27:23,160 --> 02:27:25,160
skipping any of the difficult parts,

4316
02:27:25,160 --> 02:27:28,160
leading to a new back exit which only now opened up.

4317
02:27:28,160 --> 02:27:30,160
The experience you do have is pretty fun

4318
02:27:30,160 --> 02:27:31,160
for what it is, sure,

4319
02:27:31,160 --> 02:27:34,160
but this simply isn't how Deus Ex levels should work.

4320
02:27:35,160 --> 02:27:36,160
Oh!

4321
02:27:36,160 --> 02:27:37,160
Oh!

4322
02:27:37,160 --> 02:27:38,160
Oh!

4323
02:27:38,160 --> 02:27:39,160
Oh!

4324
02:27:39,160 --> 02:27:40,160
Oh!

4325
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:41,160
Oh!

4326
02:27:41,160 --> 02:27:42,160
Oh!

4327
02:27:42,160 --> 02:27:43,160
Oh!

4328
02:27:43,160 --> 02:27:44,160
Oh!

4329
02:27:44,160 --> 02:27:45,160
Oh!

4330
02:27:45,160 --> 02:27:46,160
Oh!

4331
02:27:46,160 --> 02:27:47,160
Oh!

4332
02:27:49,160 --> 02:27:51,160
My problem with this design is it doesn't let players

4333
02:27:51,160 --> 02:27:53,160
be clever by themselves.

4334
02:27:53,160 --> 02:27:55,160
It's contingent on a game designer giving you

4335
02:27:55,160 --> 02:27:57,160
something clever to do with it.

4336
02:27:57,160 --> 02:27:59,160
If they forget to come up with some,

4337
02:27:59,160 --> 02:28:02,160
which they often do, you're shit out of luck, Buddy Boy.

4338
02:28:02,160 --> 02:28:05,160
Without tall buildings with rooftop entrances and exits,

4339
02:28:05,160 --> 02:28:07,160
apart from literally one in the warehouses

4340
02:28:07,160 --> 02:28:09,160
I didn't forget, don't be a pedant,

4341
02:28:09,160 --> 02:28:11,160
the Icarus landing system is reduced

4342
02:28:11,160 --> 02:28:13,160
from a fantastic addition to the player's arsenal

4343
02:28:13,160 --> 02:28:15,160
to a slightly faster alternative

4344
02:28:15,160 --> 02:28:17,160
to taking the ladder down certain drops

4345
02:28:17,160 --> 02:28:19,160
and only slightly faster because the falling animation

4346
02:28:19,160 --> 02:28:21,160
is slow and annoying.

4347
02:28:21,160 --> 02:28:23,160
The other big augmentation that gets wasted here

4348
02:28:23,160 --> 02:28:25,160
is the ability to punch through certain walls.

4349
02:28:25,160 --> 02:28:27,160
This powers a really interesting idea,

4350
02:28:27,160 --> 02:28:29,160
opening up new paths by cutting through

4351
02:28:29,160 --> 02:28:31,160
destructible parts of the level,

4352
02:28:31,160 --> 02:28:33,160
and it only gets to be fun in practice

4353
02:28:33,160 --> 02:28:35,160
if the developers come up with interesting ways of using it.

4354
02:28:35,160 --> 02:28:37,160
It feels like they made a lot of the levels

4355
02:28:37,160 --> 02:28:39,160
and then went, oh, shit,

4356
02:28:39,160 --> 02:28:41,160
and tried to add a bunch of punchable walls

4357
02:28:41,160 --> 02:28:43,160
at the last second so players who got it

4358
02:28:43,160 --> 02:28:45,160
feel like they can do something with it.

4359
02:28:45,160 --> 02:28:48,160
Wait, what's this window showing if the room is that small?

4360
02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:50,160
What is going on here?

4361
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:52,160
I could be wrong, but I have a sneaking suspicion

4362
02:28:52,160 --> 02:28:54,160
this wall was added a bit late.

4363
02:28:54,160 --> 02:28:57,160
You want to know a cool thing about doors in Deus Ex?

4364
02:28:57,160 --> 02:28:59,160
Wow, Deus Ex is such a cool game

4365
02:28:59,160 --> 02:29:01,160
that I'm about to enjoy telling you how doors work.

4366
02:29:01,160 --> 02:29:03,160
Doors weren't just a thing you could access

4367
02:29:03,160 --> 02:29:06,160
by finding keys or learning the code to a keypad

4368
02:29:06,160 --> 02:29:08,160
or by hacking the computer it was hooked up to

4369
02:29:08,160 --> 02:29:10,160
or by learning the password some other way

4370
02:29:10,160 --> 02:29:12,160
or by picking them.

4371
02:29:12,160 --> 02:29:14,160
They were also physical, actual doors,

4372
02:29:14,160 --> 02:29:16,160
which means you could just destroy them.

4373
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:21,160
The rocket launcher is nature's lockpick.

4374
02:29:21,160 --> 02:29:23,160
That's so many options,

4375
02:29:23,160 --> 02:29:25,160
and being able to just break the door

4376
02:29:25,160 --> 02:29:27,160
is believable and adds to the feeling

4377
02:29:28,160 --> 02:29:30,160
You can destroy doors in Human Revolution

4378
02:29:30,160 --> 02:29:32,160
if you have a grenade or a lot of bullets,

4379
02:29:32,160 --> 02:29:35,160
though the scarcity of resources makes this a bit of a waste.

4380
02:29:35,160 --> 02:29:37,160
The mechanic is implemented horribly.

4381
02:29:37,160 --> 02:29:40,160
Locked doors don't show you how much health they have

4382
02:29:40,160 --> 02:29:42,160
or even indicate they can be damaged

4383
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:44,160
until they suddenly shatter into dust.

4384
02:29:44,160 --> 02:29:47,160
♪ ♪

4385
02:29:49,160 --> 02:29:52,160
You can see a door's health once it's unlocked,

4386
02:29:52,160 --> 02:29:54,160
as in once you can just open it

4387
02:29:54,160 --> 02:29:56,160
and its health is totally irrelevant.

4388
02:29:56,160 --> 02:29:58,160
You can also break open vents,

4389
02:29:58,160 --> 02:30:01,160
which, let me remind you, are literally never locked,

4390
02:30:01,160 --> 02:30:03,160
making it pointless to ever do so.

4391
02:30:03,160 --> 02:30:05,160
I bet most people didn't even notice

4392
02:30:05,160 --> 02:30:07,160
you could do this because who cares?

4393
02:30:07,160 --> 02:30:09,160
It never serves any purpose.

4394
02:30:09,160 --> 02:30:11,160
Something I thought was really funny was apartments

4395
02:30:11,160 --> 02:30:13,160
in China have these sliding doors,

4396
02:30:13,160 --> 02:30:14,160
and you can break them open easily.

4397
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:16,160
They're flimsy, you know,

4398
02:30:16,160 --> 02:30:18,160
but when they're open, they become invincible.

4399
02:30:22,160 --> 02:30:24,160
This doesn't massively affect the gameplay,

4400
02:30:24,160 --> 02:30:26,160
but it goes a long way in showing how little thought

4401
02:30:26,160 --> 02:30:29,160
went into what used to be a really good mechanic.

4402
02:30:29,160 --> 02:30:31,160
Tons of things which were breakable in the original

4403
02:30:31,160 --> 02:30:32,160
can't be now.

4404
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:34,160
Safes are indestructible,

4405
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:36,160
so you have to know the code or hack,

4406
02:30:36,160 --> 02:30:38,160
and the many storage units in the game

4407
02:30:38,160 --> 02:30:39,160
are immune to damage as well.

4408
02:30:39,160 --> 02:30:41,160
This reduces the player's available options

4409
02:30:41,160 --> 02:30:43,160
in addition to making it impossible

4410
02:30:43,160 --> 02:30:45,160
to even know if anything is destructible

4411
02:30:45,160 --> 02:30:47,160
because most of the time it isn't.

4412
02:30:47,160 --> 02:30:49,160
The first time I tried to blow down a locked door,

4413
02:30:49,160 --> 02:30:51,160
the grenade straight up didn't work for some reason,

4414
02:30:51,160 --> 02:30:53,160
and since I had no way of knowing

4415
02:30:54,160 --> 02:30:57,160
I assumed locked doors couldn't be destroyed for ages

4416
02:30:57,160 --> 02:30:59,160
until I tried again just to double check

4417
02:30:59,160 --> 02:31:01,160
while I was writing the script for this video.

4418
02:31:01,160 --> 02:31:02,160
You know what would have been useful?

4419
02:31:02,160 --> 02:31:05,160
Showing the player the health of locked objects

4420
02:31:05,160 --> 02:31:07,160
or even saying when something's indestructible.

4421
02:31:07,160 --> 02:31:09,160
There's a little game you could have taken inspiration from

4422
02:31:09,160 --> 02:31:10,160
that did this.

4423
02:31:10,160 --> 02:31:12,160
It's called Deus Ex.

4424
02:31:12,160 --> 02:31:14,160
They just forgot to make half the stuff in the game

4425
02:31:14,160 --> 02:31:15,160
respond to damage.

4426
02:31:15,160 --> 02:31:17,160
Lockers, something players might want

4427
02:31:17,160 --> 02:31:19,160
to be able to open a bunch of all at once

4428
02:31:19,160 --> 02:31:21,160
by throwing a grenade into a room

4429
02:31:22,160 --> 02:31:24,160
and peeking around the horrible door

4430
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:27,160
of every single one are also indestructible.

4431
02:31:27,160 --> 02:31:29,160
One of the most fun things in Deus Ex

4432
02:31:29,160 --> 02:31:31,160
was running low on picks and seeing how many lockers

4433
02:31:31,160 --> 02:31:33,160
you could open with your spare GEP rockets

4434
02:31:33,160 --> 02:31:36,160
in Vandenberg without evaporating the office cat.

4435
02:31:36,160 --> 02:31:38,160
There's something immensely funny and satisfying

4436
02:31:38,160 --> 02:31:40,160
about tossing a grenade into a room

4437
02:31:40,160 --> 02:31:42,160
and turning it into a festival of loot.

4438
02:31:42,160 --> 02:31:43,160
This isn't a nitpick.

4439
02:31:43,160 --> 02:31:45,160
This is a fundamental component

4440
02:31:45,160 --> 02:31:47,160
of Deus Ex's player freedom and immersion

4441
02:31:47,160 --> 02:31:49,160
that just doesn't work.

4442
02:31:49,160 --> 02:31:51,160
You know, even when Invisible War

4443
02:31:51,160 --> 02:31:53,160
was being Invisible War,

4444
02:31:53,160 --> 02:31:55,160
you could still reliably blow things open

4445
02:31:55,160 --> 02:31:56,160
with explosives.

4446
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:58,160
It wasn't a crapshoot whether the developers

4447
02:31:58,160 --> 02:32:00,160
had bothered to make something break open

4448
02:32:00,160 --> 02:32:01,160
like it should.

4449
02:32:01,160 --> 02:32:03,160
Deus Ex's worst moments were when you had

4450
02:32:03,160 --> 02:32:05,160
no clever alternatives to the more obvious choices,

4451
02:32:05,160 --> 02:32:07,160
like when a grate you could pick

4452
02:32:07,160 --> 02:32:09,160
couldn't be destroyed by other means,

4453
02:32:09,160 --> 02:32:11,160
but this is just how human revolution works.

4454
02:32:11,160 --> 02:32:13,160
You need the lift-heavy object's ability

4455
02:32:13,160 --> 02:32:15,160
to move the vending machine to get into this vent.

4456
02:32:15,160 --> 02:32:17,160
You could say it's a venting machine,

4457
02:32:17,160 --> 02:32:19,160
but hey, maybe you can use some creativity

4458
02:32:19,160 --> 02:32:22,160
and destroy the machine with a grenade.

4459
02:32:22,160 --> 02:32:24,160
Vending machines are literally indestructible.

4460
02:32:24,160 --> 02:32:25,160
Didn't you know?

4461
02:32:25,160 --> 02:32:27,160
The best you can hope for is the physics

4462
02:32:27,160 --> 02:32:28,160
blowing it clear of the vent,

4463
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:29,160
but for that to happen,

4464
02:32:29,160 --> 02:32:31,160
the physics would have to work.

4465
02:32:31,160 --> 02:32:32,160
Goodbye.

4466
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:34,160
Meanwhile...

4467
02:32:34,160 --> 02:32:39,160
♪ ♪

4468
02:32:39,160 --> 02:32:41,160
Deus Ex made almost everything breakable.

4469
02:32:41,160 --> 02:32:44,160
Plants, boxes, bodies.

4470
02:32:44,160 --> 02:32:46,160
All right, I killed your boss.

4471
02:32:46,160 --> 02:32:47,160
Well, okay.

4472
02:32:47,160 --> 02:32:49,160
Trash sometimes spawns rats in it

4473
02:32:49,160 --> 02:32:52,160
when you destroy it because it's New York City, baby.

4474
02:32:52,160 --> 02:32:54,160
Smash all the vases and beakers on the floor you want.

4475
02:32:54,160 --> 02:32:56,160
Take this, globalists.

4476
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:58,160
The game certainly is much nicer looking

4477
02:32:58,160 --> 02:32:59,160
than the earlier games.

4478
02:32:59,160 --> 02:33:00,160
Humans don't look like

4479
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:02,160
Age of Mythology Prometheans

4480
02:33:02,160 --> 02:33:04,160
with faces painted on them for one,

4481
02:33:04,160 --> 02:33:05,160
but just generally,

4482
02:33:05,160 --> 02:33:06,160
everything is so much more beautiful.

4483
02:33:06,160 --> 02:33:08,160
I mean, look at these ceilings.

4484
02:33:08,160 --> 02:33:10,160
At least a year of the game's development

4485
02:33:10,160 --> 02:33:11,160
probably went into these.

4486
02:33:11,160 --> 02:33:13,160
Holy cow, bro. I love this.

4487
02:33:14,160 --> 02:33:16,160
Top ten ceilings in history

4488
02:33:16,160 --> 02:33:17,160
right behind the Sistine Chapel

4489
02:33:17,160 --> 02:33:19,160
and another clever-sounding thing,

4490
02:33:19,160 --> 02:33:21,160
but when it comes to interaction,

4491
02:33:21,160 --> 02:33:23,160
you know, the game part of this game,

4492
02:33:23,160 --> 02:33:25,160
almost every prop or object

4493
02:33:25,160 --> 02:33:27,160
is invincible set dressing.

4494
02:33:27,160 --> 02:33:29,160
These beakers? Bulletproof.

4495
02:33:29,160 --> 02:33:31,160
This Chinese food? Immortal.

4496
02:33:31,160 --> 02:33:33,160
This glass table?

4497
02:33:33,160 --> 02:33:35,160
Absorbing nearby humans to gain their power.

4498
02:33:35,160 --> 02:33:37,160
The world feels so static,

4499
02:33:37,160 --> 02:33:39,160
and it makes you feel even less

4500
02:33:39,160 --> 02:33:40,160
like you're really interacting with it.

4501
02:33:40,160 --> 02:33:42,160
Lapicus claims this is a selling point too.

4502
02:33:42,160 --> 02:33:44,160
Look at this. What?

4503
02:33:44,160 --> 02:33:46,160
Quit screwing around.

4504
02:33:46,160 --> 02:33:48,160
Are you telling me your game is better

4505
02:33:48,160 --> 02:33:50,160
because you can't throw plants at people?

4506
02:33:50,160 --> 02:33:52,160
This is cyberbullying.

4507
02:33:52,160 --> 02:33:53,160
I've seen people say this game

4508
02:33:53,160 --> 02:33:55,160
has amazing emergent gameplay,

4509
02:33:55,160 --> 02:33:56,160
like, oh, wow,

4510
02:33:56,160 --> 02:33:58,160
you can break open destructible walls

4511
02:33:58,160 --> 02:34:00,160
if you don't have the wall-punching ability.

4512
02:34:00,160 --> 02:34:01,160
Yeah, that's nice,

4513
02:34:01,160 --> 02:34:03,160
although if you don't have that ability,

4514
02:34:03,160 --> 02:34:06,160
destructible walls don't noticeably glow,

4515
02:34:06,160 --> 02:34:07,160
so it's hard to find many of them

4516
02:34:07,160 --> 02:34:09,160
without already having the ability,

4517
02:34:09,160 --> 02:34:11,160
at which point you're not going to waste grenades

4518
02:34:11,160 --> 02:34:13,160
or ammunition on a wall you can just punch down.

4519
02:34:13,160 --> 02:34:15,160
Actually, the punchable wall augmentation

4520
02:34:15,160 --> 02:34:17,160
opens up a bunch of extra questions.

4521
02:34:17,160 --> 02:34:19,160
You can smash down concrete walls

4522
02:34:19,160 --> 02:34:21,160
if they're slightly cracked,

4523
02:34:21,160 --> 02:34:22,160
but you can't use this ability

4524
02:34:22,160 --> 02:34:24,160
to punch open locked doors?

4525
02:34:24,160 --> 02:34:26,160
You can't just break whatever locking mechanism

4526
02:34:26,160 --> 02:34:28,160
is keeping this flimsy door shut

4527
02:34:28,160 --> 02:34:29,160
with your mega fists?

4528
02:34:29,160 --> 02:34:31,160
Chaos Theory had a lock-picking minigame

4529
02:34:31,160 --> 02:34:34,160
that got a bit dull the way hacking minigames did here,

4530
02:34:34,160 --> 02:34:35,160
and that was on top of the hacking minigame

4531
02:34:35,160 --> 02:34:36,160
they also had,

4532
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:39,160
but the designers also gave you the ability

4533
02:34:39,160 --> 02:34:42,160
to loudly break the lock and open it instantly.

4534
02:34:44,160 --> 02:34:47,160
People who heard the noise or saw the broken lock

4535
02:34:47,160 --> 02:34:48,160
would know someone was here,

4536
02:34:48,160 --> 02:34:50,160
but if you don't want to pick that lock,

4537
02:34:50,160 --> 02:34:51,160
you don't have to.

4538
02:34:51,160 --> 02:34:52,160
Picking it became a choice,

4539
02:34:52,160 --> 02:34:55,160
one which felt more professional and stealthy.

4540
02:34:55,160 --> 02:34:56,160
Wouldn't it be cool if that augmentation

4541
02:34:56,160 --> 02:34:58,160
also let you smash the locks off doors

4542
02:34:58,160 --> 02:34:59,160
and make a ton of noise

4543
02:34:59,160 --> 02:35:02,160
or risk setting off a security system or something?

4544
02:35:02,160 --> 02:35:03,160
It would be really cool to have an ability

4545
02:35:03,160 --> 02:35:05,160
like that at your disposal,

4546
02:35:05,160 --> 02:35:07,160
and I'm shocked the people who made a game

4547
02:35:07,160 --> 02:35:09,160
that literally did this didn't think of it.

4548
02:35:09,160 --> 02:35:11,160
It would automatically give you a lot more

4549
02:35:11,160 --> 02:35:12,160
to do with this power

4550
02:35:12,160 --> 02:35:14,160
and save on having to think of more places

4551
02:35:14,160 --> 02:35:15,160
to put punchable walls,

4552
02:35:15,160 --> 02:35:18,160
which they were really running low on towards the end.

4553
02:35:18,160 --> 02:35:20,160
Something else really bugs me about these levels.

4554
02:35:20,160 --> 02:35:22,160
I spent a long time trying to put my finger on it,

4555
02:35:22,160 --> 02:35:24,160
but it turns out the answer was floating right in front

4556
02:35:24,160 --> 02:35:26,160
of my face the entire time,

4557
02:35:26,160 --> 02:35:27,160
so I'm not sure how I missed it.

4558
02:35:27,160 --> 02:35:30,160
Oh, did you think I forgot about the quest markers?

4559
02:35:30,160 --> 02:35:31,160
How could I?

4560
02:35:31,160 --> 02:35:32,160
How could anyone?

4561
02:35:32,160 --> 02:35:33,160
Quest markers are annoying

4562
02:35:33,160 --> 02:35:34,160
when they're off in the corner,

4563
02:35:34,160 --> 02:35:35,160
but it turns out it could have been worse.

4564
02:35:35,160 --> 02:35:37,160
They could have been unconstrained.

4565
02:35:37,160 --> 02:35:39,160
They could have just, no, no, leave me alone.

4566
02:35:39,160 --> 02:35:41,160
They didn't seem to consider how it would look

4567
02:35:41,160 --> 02:35:43,160
if you had multiple side quests happening at once

4568
02:35:43,160 --> 02:35:45,160
or if you were at a stage in a side quest

4569
02:35:45,160 --> 02:35:47,160
with multiple objectives because who, boy,

4570
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:49,160
does that door need me to know?

4571
02:35:49,160 --> 02:35:51,160
Every side quest and individual component

4572
02:35:51,160 --> 02:35:53,160
each side quest has is outside it.

4573
02:35:53,160 --> 02:35:55,160
There's one side quest where you have to neutralize

4574
02:35:55,160 --> 02:35:57,160
an entire apartment full of gangsters.

4575
02:35:57,160 --> 02:35:59,160
Now, they're localized to a single small apartment,

4576
02:35:59,160 --> 02:36:02,160
so you only need one quest marker for that, right?

4577
02:36:02,160 --> 02:36:05,160
["Live and Let Live"]

4578
02:36:05,160 --> 02:36:07,160
I have genuinely died in this game

4579
02:36:07,160 --> 02:36:09,160
because I couldn't see a guy behind a pile

4580
02:36:09,160 --> 02:36:11,160
of his buddy's quest markers.

4581
02:36:11,160 --> 02:36:13,160
Yeah, so the game is a little desperate

4582
02:36:13,160 --> 02:36:14,160
to make sure players don't miss

4583
02:36:14,160 --> 02:36:15,160
what they're supposed to be doing

4584
02:36:15,160 --> 02:36:18,160
to the point that it's pretty distracting, ironically.

4585
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:19,160
They expect you to toggle off the markers

4586
02:36:19,160 --> 02:36:21,160
for quests you aren't doing at the exact moment,

4587
02:36:21,160 --> 02:36:23,160
and yeah, sure, this helps for that

4588
02:36:23,160 --> 02:36:25,160
if you don't mind doing one thing at a time,

4589
02:36:25,160 --> 02:36:27,160
but the real issue is making a game

4590
02:36:27,160 --> 02:36:29,160
which has a method of pointing the player

4591
02:36:29,160 --> 02:36:31,160
directly towards their required destination

4592
02:36:31,160 --> 02:36:34,160
inspires really lazy design

4593
02:36:34,160 --> 02:36:36,160
because now the levels don't have to make sense

4594
02:36:36,160 --> 02:36:38,160
to players as they navigate

4595
02:36:38,160 --> 02:36:40,160
because they've got a thing telling them where to go.

4596
02:36:40,160 --> 02:36:42,160
If you've played the game, you'll know that even though

4597
02:36:42,160 --> 02:36:43,160
the markers are really distracting,

4598
02:36:43,160 --> 02:36:44,160
you have to leave them on

4599
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:47,160
because there's no other way of finding these quests.

4600
02:36:47,160 --> 02:36:49,160
Detroit is an unintuitive area to explore.

4601
02:36:49,160 --> 02:36:51,160
It's a ton of very similar streets

4602
02:36:51,160 --> 02:36:53,160
connecting to other very similar streets,

4603
02:36:53,160 --> 02:36:54,160
and when it's not those streets,

4604
02:36:54,160 --> 02:36:56,160
it's identical apartment buildings,

4605
02:36:56,160 --> 02:36:58,160
which granted is realistic to most urban cities,

4606
02:36:58,160 --> 02:37:00,160
but that's not how games ought to work.

4607
02:37:00,160 --> 02:37:03,160
New York in Deus Ex had character and presence.

4608
02:37:03,160 --> 02:37:05,160
It was designed to be experienced

4609
02:37:05,160 --> 02:37:07,160
by a player who didn't have it memorized

4610
02:37:07,160 --> 02:37:09,160
or know exactly where to go.

4611
02:37:09,160 --> 02:37:11,160
You enter and you're like, where am I?

4612
02:37:11,160 --> 02:37:13,160
And you look around and you know where you are

4613
02:37:13,160 --> 02:37:15,160
because every part of the level looks different

4614
02:37:15,160 --> 02:37:17,160
and things are really well signposted,

4615
02:37:17,160 --> 02:37:19,160
literally in some cases.

4616
02:37:19,160 --> 02:37:21,160
I love the place everyone calls the Taun Hotel

4617
02:37:21,160 --> 02:37:23,160
is really the Hilton Hotel but the sign's broken.

4618
02:37:23,160 --> 02:37:25,160
It's memorable and makes the hotel

4619
02:37:25,160 --> 02:37:27,160
into an obvious landmark you can use to navigate.

4620
02:37:27,160 --> 02:37:29,160
If you have to find Adam Jensen's apartment

4621
02:37:29,160 --> 02:37:31,160
off in the corner of the map

4622
02:37:31,160 --> 02:37:33,160
without quest markers telling you exactly where it is,

4623
02:37:33,160 --> 02:37:35,160
you're screwed.

4624
02:37:35,160 --> 02:37:37,160
If you try to stop and get your bearings by looking around,

4625
02:37:37,160 --> 02:37:39,160
you'll never get anywhere.

4626
02:37:39,160 --> 02:37:42,160
Detroit is a maze you need a GPS to traverse.

4627
02:37:42,160 --> 02:37:44,160
Quests are not designed to be doable

4628
02:37:44,160 --> 02:37:46,160
with the markers turned off.

4629
02:37:46,160 --> 02:37:48,160
You'd have to manually check every single back alley

4630
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:50,160
to find the specific one with the guy

4631
02:37:50,160 --> 02:37:52,160
you need to talk to for the current quest,

4632
02:37:52,160 --> 02:37:54,160
especially when the guy has moved

4633
02:37:54,160 --> 02:37:56,160
since the last time you talked to him for no reason.

4634
02:37:56,160 --> 02:37:58,160
Conversely, I was feeling clever

4635
02:37:58,160 --> 02:38:00,160
when I wrote this sentence, this also means

4636
02:38:00,160 --> 02:38:02,160
the player is never expected or challenged

4637
02:38:02,160 --> 02:38:04,160
to pay attention.

4638
02:38:04,160 --> 02:38:06,160
Deus Ex has an optional secret base in the sewers

4639
02:38:06,160 --> 02:38:08,160
the first time you get to New York

4640
02:38:08,160 --> 02:38:10,160
that's a clever setup for some of the future plot.

4641
02:38:10,160 --> 02:38:12,160
Finding it requires looking around yourself

4642
02:38:12,160 --> 02:38:14,160
or talking to a character you meet

4643
02:38:14,160 --> 02:38:16,160
in another optional area and hearing him mention

4644
02:38:16,160 --> 02:38:18,160
the base in the sewers and choosing to check it out.

4645
02:38:18,160 --> 02:38:20,160
Nothing gets plopped on your screen,

4646
02:38:20,160 --> 02:38:22,160
no arrow on your mini-map,

4647
02:38:22,160 --> 02:38:24,160
just good old-fashioned detective work.

4648
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:26,160
You feel like a spy on the trail

4649
02:38:26,160 --> 02:38:28,160
of a conspiracy and on a deeper level,

4650
02:38:28,160 --> 02:38:30,160
your objective is to find a generator

4651
02:38:30,160 --> 02:38:32,160
the terrorists have hidden. Finding it is the point.

4652
02:38:32,160 --> 02:38:34,160
Asking around, exploring,

4653
02:38:34,160 --> 02:38:36,160
bothering to check out side content and meet

4654
02:38:36,160 --> 02:38:38,160
other characters who might come in handy later.

4655
02:38:38,160 --> 02:38:40,160
You can get on the rooftops of buildings

4656
02:38:40,160 --> 02:38:42,160
and physically see the building the NSF

4657
02:38:42,160 --> 02:38:44,160
are clearly trying to defend. This is the point

4658
02:38:44,160 --> 02:38:46,160
of this section. It's why the game

4659
02:38:46,160 --> 02:38:48,160
feels so free and personal despite

4660
02:38:48,160 --> 02:38:50,160
being, at its heart, pretty linear.

4661
02:38:50,160 --> 02:38:52,160
DXHR feels exactly

4662
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:54,160
as linear as it is. In every

4663
02:38:54,160 --> 02:38:56,160
single moment, it is telling you exactly

4664
02:38:56,160 --> 02:38:58,160
where you're going next and

4665
02:38:58,160 --> 02:39:00,160
you're following it. When you have to do the

4666
02:39:00,160 --> 02:39:02,160
equivalent quest, shutting down a signal the

4667
02:39:02,160 --> 02:39:04,160
bad guys are generating, you know precisely

4668
02:39:04,160 --> 02:39:06,160
where it is at all times. There is

4669
02:39:06,160 --> 02:39:08,160
no mystery, no search. Pritchard

4670
02:39:08,160 --> 02:39:10,160
gives you a quest marker and you walk

4671
02:39:10,160 --> 02:39:12,160
to it. Hell, you could have just got your pilot

4672
02:39:12,160 --> 02:39:14,160
to drop you off right there and save you the trouble

4673
02:39:14,160 --> 02:39:16,160
and when you do turn it off, she actually does turn up

4674
02:39:16,160 --> 02:39:18,160
to take you to the next area, which is a little

4675
02:39:18,160 --> 02:39:20,160
insulting. I'm sure there's a plot contrivance

4676
02:39:20,160 --> 02:39:22,160
but in the original game, the point was that

4677
02:39:22,160 --> 02:39:24,160
you didn't know exactly where it was

4678
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:26,160
so you didn't feel like you had your time wasted

4679
02:39:26,160 --> 02:39:28,160
when an aircraft came to pick you up after you

4680
02:39:28,160 --> 02:39:30,160
found it. Quest markers are not

4681
02:39:30,160 --> 02:39:32,160
an alternative to level design. There

4682
02:39:32,160 --> 02:39:34,160
are a few brief sections in the game

4683
02:39:34,160 --> 02:39:36,160
where they're switched off so the game has

4684
02:39:36,160 --> 02:39:38,160
to be designed to make the player do their own

4685
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:40,160
thinking and exploring and the game's fun

4686
02:39:40,160 --> 02:39:42,160
factor instantly skyrockets.

4687
02:39:42,160 --> 02:39:44,160
There's a base where your signal is jammed

4688
02:39:44,160 --> 02:39:46,160
or whatever so you have to manually find

4689
02:39:46,160 --> 02:39:48,160
the scientist you're looking for and it's

4690
02:39:48,160 --> 02:39:50,160
easily the best level in the game to

4691
02:39:50,160 --> 02:39:52,160
navigate. Each of the buildings has a

4692
02:39:52,160 --> 02:39:54,160
completely different shape and feel,

4693
02:39:54,160 --> 02:39:56,160
unique designs and visual cues,

4694
02:39:56,160 --> 02:39:58,160
the outside area is built so it's easy to know

4695
02:39:58,160 --> 02:40:00,160
where you are relative to everything. It's really

4696
02:40:00,160 --> 02:40:02,160
cool. Five minutes in, you find the signal

4697
02:40:02,160 --> 02:40:04,160
jammer and turn it off and the game is bullshit

4698
02:40:04,160 --> 02:40:06,160
again. Now you know exactly where to go

4699
02:40:06,160 --> 02:40:08,160
and suddenly you're not really exploring anymore.

4700
02:40:08,160 --> 02:40:10,160
This is the one section in the game

4701
02:40:10,160 --> 02:40:12,160
where turning off the quest markers actually works

4702
02:40:12,160 --> 02:40:14,160
really well so at least it's a good

4703
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:16,160
time if you keep the markers turned off.

4704
02:40:16,160 --> 02:40:18,160
It kind of sucks that almost every game

4705
02:40:18,160 --> 02:40:20,160
that heavily relies on these markers inevitably

4706
02:40:20,160 --> 02:40:22,160
has a tiny, really cool segment

4707
02:40:22,160 --> 02:40:24,160
that turns them off where the level design has to

4708
02:40:24,160 --> 02:40:26,160
account for them being turned off and everything

4709
02:40:26,160 --> 02:40:28,160
gets so much better. Instead of being

4710
02:40:28,160 --> 02:40:30,160
an interesting take on the central mechanics,

4711
02:40:30,160 --> 02:40:32,160
it ends up being a brief foray into

4712
02:40:32,160 --> 02:40:34,160
better mechanics you don't get anywhere else

4713
02:40:34,160 --> 02:40:36,160
and now the player knows exactly

4714
02:40:36,160 --> 02:40:38,160
what they're missing the rest of the time.

4715
02:40:38,160 --> 02:40:40,160
There's an oversight in the PC version

4716
02:40:40,160 --> 02:40:42,160
that's kind of funny but also prevents

4717
02:40:42,160 --> 02:40:44,160
the markers from at least getting better

4718
02:40:44,160 --> 02:40:46,160
with age. The game was designed to look

4719
02:40:46,160 --> 02:40:48,160
good at 720p on the PlayStation 3

4720
02:40:48,160 --> 02:40:50,160
and Xbox 360. When nixes

4721
02:40:50,160 --> 02:40:52,160
were creating the PC port, and god bless

4722
02:40:52,160 --> 02:40:54,160
them, otherwise they did a fantastic job,

4723
02:40:54,160 --> 02:40:56,160
someone made the UI not scale

4724
02:40:56,160 --> 02:40:58,160
with resolution. This means at higher resolutions

4725
02:40:58,160 --> 02:41:00,160
like 1080p, 1440p,

4726
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:02,160
and 4K if you're an idiot who owns

4727
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:04,160
a 4K screen, the UI gets

4728
02:41:04,160 --> 02:41:06,160
increasingly harder to see and read

4729
02:41:06,160 --> 02:41:08,160
but for some godforsaken reason,

4730
02:41:08,160 --> 02:41:10,160
the objective markers and only

4731
02:41:10,160 --> 02:41:12,160
the objective markers do scale

4732
02:41:12,160 --> 02:41:14,160
so even though everything else is so small,

4733
02:41:14,160 --> 02:41:16,160
people watching this video on their phone

4734
02:41:16,160 --> 02:41:18,160
won't be able to read the in-game subtitles.

4735
02:41:18,160 --> 02:41:20,160
Don't blame me. That's just how the game looks

4736
02:41:20,160 --> 02:41:22,160
at 1440p. The quest markers are

4737
02:41:22,160 --> 02:41:24,160
still blasting your head off and

4738
02:41:24,160 --> 02:41:26,160
messing with the visuals of an otherwise

4739
02:41:26,160 --> 02:41:28,160
still beautiful game.

4740
02:41:28,160 --> 02:41:30,160
Incidentally, if you get the chip replacement,

4741
02:41:30,160 --> 02:41:32,160
the glitchy health bar and ammo

4742
02:41:32,160 --> 02:41:34,160
counter you get during the boss battle are

4743
02:41:34,160 --> 02:41:36,160
scaled so you can briefly see just

4744
02:41:36,160 --> 02:41:38,160
how readable the game could have been.

4745
02:41:38,160 --> 02:41:40,160
You know how older video game cities

4746
02:41:40,160 --> 02:41:42,160
were always a lot smaller than a real city

4747
02:41:42,160 --> 02:41:44,160
would be because of hardware limitations or what have you?

4748
02:41:44,160 --> 02:41:46,160
It turns out that was a blessing in

4749
02:41:46,160 --> 02:41:48,160
disguise. New York, Hong Kong,

4750
02:41:48,160 --> 02:41:50,160
and Paris felt big but not so big

4751
02:41:50,160 --> 02:41:52,160
that getting around was annoying because you know

4752
02:41:52,160 --> 02:41:54,160
what's not that fun? Trying to get around

4753
02:41:54,160 --> 02:41:56,160
a big city on foot.

4754
02:41:56,160 --> 02:41:58,160
["Hey."

4755
02:41:58,160 --> 02:42:00,160
["Hey."

4756
02:42:00,160 --> 02:42:02,160
["Hey."

4757
02:42:02,160 --> 02:42:04,160
["Hey."

4758
02:42:04,160 --> 02:42:06,160
["Hey."

4759
02:42:06,160 --> 02:42:08,160
["Hey."

4760
02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:09,160
["Hey." You laughed or something?"

4761
02:42:09,160 --> 02:42:11,160
The new, realistically big Detroit

4762
02:42:11,160 --> 02:42:13,160
and Hengsha levels have tons of places

4763
02:42:13,160 --> 02:42:15,160
that serve no actual gameplay purpose whatsoever,

4764
02:42:15,160 --> 02:42:17,160
but the level has to be big

4765
02:42:17,160 --> 02:42:19,160
because cities are big. The game does

4766
02:42:19,160 --> 02:42:21,160
create a very nice sense of mood with this though.

4767
02:42:21,160 --> 02:42:23,160
The designers came up with hundreds of brands

4768
02:42:23,160 --> 02:42:25,160
and logos to populate their future with.

4769
02:42:25,160 --> 02:42:27,160
There's some genuine creativity on display

4770
02:42:27,160 --> 02:42:29,160
here, but these levels aren't used

4771
02:42:29,160 --> 02:42:31,160
in ways that benefit from this. You aren't

4772
02:42:31,160 --> 02:42:33,160
milling around the cool environment,

4773
02:42:33,160 --> 02:42:35,160
making small talk with locals, having unique

4774
02:42:35,160 --> 02:42:37,160
encounters as you traverse the hustle and bustle

4775
02:42:37,160 --> 02:42:39,160
of the city. It's window dressing

4776
02:42:39,160 --> 02:42:41,160
as you follow a quest marker to the places

4777
02:42:41,160 --> 02:42:43,160
the gameplay happens. J.C. Denton's

4778
02:42:43,160 --> 02:42:45,160
walk speed wasn't super fast by the first person

4779
02:42:45,160 --> 02:42:47,160
shooter standards of the time, but the small

4780
02:42:47,160 --> 02:42:49,160
and dense levels packed with stuff to do

4781
02:42:49,160 --> 02:42:51,160
and secrets to find made the pace

4782
02:42:51,160 --> 02:42:53,160
feel brisk. Adam feels

4783
02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:55,160
significantly slower than J.C.,

4784
02:42:55,160 --> 02:42:57,160
especially in the much larger cities.

4785
02:42:57,160 --> 02:42:59,160
You can sprint for two seconds.

4786
02:42:59,160 --> 02:43:01,160
That's not a joke. Two seconds, and then

4787
02:43:01,160 --> 02:43:03,160
it has to recharge.

4788
02:43:03,160 --> 02:43:05,160
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

4789
02:43:05,160 --> 02:43:07,160
Oh. Oh.

4790
02:43:07,160 --> 02:43:09,160
Oh.

4791
02:43:09,160 --> 02:43:11,160
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

4792
02:43:11,160 --> 02:43:13,160
They made running shit on purpose

4793
02:43:13,160 --> 02:43:15,160
so you had more stuff to put praxis points

4794
02:43:15,160 --> 02:43:17,160
into. I mean, it's not a surprise he's going

4795
02:43:17,160 --> 02:43:19,160
so slow if he's carrying so much stuff

4796
02:43:19,160 --> 02:43:21,160
everywhere in his arms. Pathologic made

4797
02:43:21,160 --> 02:43:23,160
you walk for hours deliberately as

4798
02:43:23,160 --> 02:43:25,160
a form of punishment for the player.

4799
02:43:25,160 --> 02:43:27,160
The game was trying to hurt you and make you

4800
02:43:27,160 --> 02:43:29,160
question what you were doing with your time.

4801
02:43:29,160 --> 02:43:31,160
Human Revolution is trying to be a fun

4802
02:43:31,160 --> 02:43:33,160
cyberpunk action RPG, so I

4803
02:43:33,160 --> 02:43:35,160
don't think they should be aiming for the same effect.

4804
02:43:35,160 --> 02:43:37,160
The atmosphere and art design deserve

4805
02:43:37,160 --> 02:43:39,160
some credit here, though. This is some of the

4806
02:43:39,160 --> 02:43:41,160
most impressive really boring

4807
02:43:41,160 --> 02:43:43,160
walking back and forth between objectives

4808
02:43:43,160 --> 02:43:45,160
I've done in my life, and I'm an expert

4809
02:43:45,160 --> 02:43:47,160
on those. This is one of the

4810
02:43:47,160 --> 02:43:49,160
best realized worlds in the history

4811
02:43:49,160 --> 02:43:51,160
of video games. A decade later,

4812
02:43:51,160 --> 02:43:53,160
the graphics hold up incredibly well

4813
02:43:53,160 --> 02:43:55,160
because good visual design just

4814
02:43:55,160 --> 02:43:57,160
doesn't age, but you're traversing

4815
02:43:57,160 --> 02:43:59,160
it to do the same hacking minigame

4816
02:43:59,160 --> 02:44:01,160
every five feet to unlock safes

4817
02:44:01,160 --> 02:44:03,160
with a negligible amount of money in them

4818
02:44:03,160 --> 02:44:05,160
which you can't even spend because the store

4819
02:44:05,160 --> 02:44:07,160
only had ten of the bullets you want.

4820
02:44:07,160 --> 02:44:09,160
This is why this game is so difficult

4821
02:44:09,160 --> 02:44:11,160
to analyze without going way overboard

4822
02:44:11,160 --> 02:44:13,160
and making an unwatchably long video.

4823
02:44:13,160 --> 02:44:15,160
All the pieces of an excellent game

4824
02:44:15,160 --> 02:44:17,160
are right here. They even made the

4825
02:44:17,160 --> 02:44:19,160
skylight you could have got in through in a better

4826
02:44:19,160 --> 02:44:21,160
version of the game, but they don't

4827
02:44:21,160 --> 02:44:23,160
stick the landing. Instead, the game is

4828
02:44:23,160 --> 02:44:25,160
merely fine. The stealth is fun,

4829
02:44:25,160 --> 02:44:27,160
the combat is good, and the levels are okay

4830
02:44:27,160 --> 02:44:29,160
but don't encourage creativity,

4831
02:44:29,160 --> 02:44:31,160
and it's easy to get bored because the game

4832
02:44:31,160 --> 02:44:33,160
never asks that much of you.

4833
02:44:33,160 --> 02:44:35,160
I joked before about people quitting because of the

4834
02:44:35,160 --> 02:44:37,160
hacking minigame, but more seriously,

4835
02:44:37,160 --> 02:44:39,160
it's probably because halfway through,

4836
02:44:39,160 --> 02:44:41,160
there aren't even many new levels to keep

4837
02:44:41,160 --> 02:44:43,160
things fresh. You instead go to Detroit

4838
02:44:43,160 --> 02:44:45,160
and Hengsha all over again with

4839
02:44:45,160 --> 02:44:47,160
even less to see this time. The first

4840
02:44:47,160 --> 02:44:49,160
visits to these locations have an okay amount

4841
02:44:49,160 --> 02:44:51,160
of side quests, about as many as the

4842
02:44:51,160 --> 02:44:53,160
original did for its city-type locations.

4843
02:44:53,160 --> 02:44:55,160
The second visit to Detroit has

4844
02:44:55,160 --> 02:44:57,160
a side quest with a second one if

4845
02:44:57,160 --> 02:44:59,160
you completed another side quest during the

4846
02:44:59,160 --> 02:45:01,160
first visit, and I mean fully completed.

4847
02:45:01,160 --> 02:45:03,160
If you forgot to read the three emails

4848
02:45:03,160 --> 02:45:05,160
you got sent at the end of the first half of

4849
02:45:05,160 --> 02:45:07,160
the quest before you left for China hours ago,

4850
02:45:07,160 --> 02:45:09,160
you can never start the second half

4851
02:45:09,160 --> 02:45:11,160
once you get back. The second visit to

4852
02:45:11,160 --> 02:45:13,160
China is so devoid of new material

4853
02:45:13,160 --> 02:45:15,160
the game lies and says there are more

4854
02:45:15,160 --> 02:45:17,160
side missions than there actually are.

4855
02:45:17,160 --> 02:45:19,160
There's two, one from this guy and one from

4856
02:45:19,160 --> 02:45:21,160
this lady, but the game pretends

4857
02:45:21,160 --> 02:45:23,160
there's a third quest. The other

4858
02:45:23,160 --> 02:45:25,160
quest, a matter of discretion,

4859
02:45:25,160 --> 02:45:27,160
is given to you by another character.

4860
02:45:27,160 --> 02:45:29,160
It's to talk to this lady who then

4861
02:45:29,160 --> 02:45:31,160
gives you the second quest.

4862
02:45:31,160 --> 02:45:33,160
Are you the man Mr. Darrow sent?

4863
02:45:33,160 --> 02:45:35,160
A guy calls you on the telephone and

4864
02:45:35,160 --> 02:45:37,160
gives you the quest to get the other quest

4865
02:45:37,160 --> 02:45:39,160
so it feels like you're doing more quests.

4866
02:45:39,160 --> 02:45:41,160
There are some really ambitious ideas for a cyberpunk

4867
02:45:41,160 --> 02:45:43,160
world in here saddled with an engine

4868
02:45:43,160 --> 02:45:45,160
and hardware generation that didn't match

4869
02:45:45,160 --> 02:45:47,160
that ambition. The simplified levels

4870
02:45:47,160 --> 02:45:49,160
remind me a lot of the PS2 version

4871
02:45:49,160 --> 02:45:51,160
of the original game, which was good

4872
02:45:51,160 --> 02:45:53,160
but a bit more stripped down and missing

4873
02:45:53,160 --> 02:45:55,160
the expansiveness and complexity that made

4874
02:45:55,160 --> 02:45:57,160
the PC version quite so special.

4875
02:45:57,160 --> 02:45:59,160
I'd compare the level design to Invisible Wars,

4876
02:45:59,160 --> 02:46:01,160
but even I'm not that mean.

4877
02:46:01,160 --> 02:46:03,160
Actually, no. Invisible War put enemies

4878
02:46:03,160 --> 02:46:05,160
in the vents to punish you for thinking they were

4879
02:46:05,160 --> 02:46:07,160
an easy solution, so its level design

4880
02:46:07,160 --> 02:46:09,160
is objectively better. Next chapter.

4881
02:46:09,160 --> 02:46:11,160
Goodbye.

4882
02:46:11,160 --> 02:46:13,160
Ugh!

4883
02:46:15,160 --> 02:46:17,160
I talked to the chairman.

4884
02:46:17,160 --> 02:46:19,160
We discussed regime change for New Cairo.

4885
02:46:19,160 --> 02:46:21,160
♪

4886
02:46:23,160 --> 02:46:25,160
The story of the original Deus Ex

4887
02:46:25,160 --> 02:46:27,160
was a complete mess.

4888
02:46:27,160 --> 02:46:29,160
In a good way, though. It's part of what makes it

4889
02:46:29,160 --> 02:46:31,160
amazing, but it's also why making another

4890
02:46:31,160 --> 02:46:33,160
one is like trying to solve the trolley problem

4891
02:46:33,160 --> 02:46:35,160
while trapped inside the trolley.

4892
02:46:35,160 --> 02:46:37,160
It was set in 2052 in a world

4893
02:46:37,160 --> 02:46:39,160
that's very different from ours, or was

4894
02:46:39,160 --> 02:46:41,160
different in the year 2000. Many of the game's

4895
02:46:41,160 --> 02:46:43,160
scariest predictions turned out to be true.

4896
02:46:43,160 --> 02:46:45,160
My favorite games keep doing that.

4897
02:46:45,160 --> 02:46:47,160
Let it spill over to the schools

4898
02:46:47,160 --> 02:46:49,160
and churches. Let the bodies pile up

4899
02:46:49,160 --> 02:46:51,160
in the streets. There's a dozen

4900
02:46:51,160 --> 02:46:53,160
factions with their own agendas all fighting

4901
02:46:53,160 --> 02:46:55,160
for supremacy, uneasy alliances,

4902
02:46:55,160 --> 02:46:57,160
ancient organizations, revolutionary

4903
02:46:57,160 --> 02:46:59,160
groups, secret bases underneath

4904
02:46:59,160 --> 02:47:01,160
other secret bases, corporate conspiracies,

4905
02:47:01,160 --> 02:47:03,160
and even greasels!

4906
02:47:03,160 --> 02:47:05,160
Oh, God!

4907
02:47:05,160 --> 02:47:07,160
Oh, God!

4908
02:47:09,160 --> 02:47:11,160
Despite discussing important

4909
02:47:11,160 --> 02:47:13,160
ideas like the value of democracy

4910
02:47:13,160 --> 02:47:15,160
and the human need to feel witnessed by a god

4911
02:47:15,160 --> 02:47:17,160
and how the rich have manipulated

4912
02:47:17,160 --> 02:47:19,160
the system so workers pay more in taxes

4913
02:47:19,160 --> 02:47:21,160
than their boss, the writing still manages

4914
02:47:21,160 --> 02:47:23,160
to be fun.

4915
02:47:23,160 --> 02:47:25,160
A bomb's a bad choice

4916
02:47:25,160 --> 02:47:27,160
for close-range combat.

4917
02:47:27,160 --> 02:47:29,160
Deus Ex knows that a world where every conspiracy

4918
02:47:29,160 --> 02:47:31,160
turned out to be true would be a little bit

4919
02:47:31,160 --> 02:47:33,160
silly.

4920
02:47:33,160 --> 02:47:35,160
No, I wanted orange.

4921
02:47:35,160 --> 02:47:37,160
It gave me lemon lime. It's the maintenance man.

4922
02:47:37,160 --> 02:47:39,160
He knows I like orange.

4923
02:47:39,160 --> 02:47:41,160
So you think the staff has some kind of plot?

4924
02:47:41,160 --> 02:47:43,160
Yes, they do that on purpose.

4925
02:47:43,160 --> 02:47:45,160
So instead of pretending to be the darkest

4926
02:47:45,160 --> 02:47:47,160
and most serious-est story ever,

4927
02:47:47,160 --> 02:47:49,160
it's more like an X-Files box set

4928
02:47:49,160 --> 02:47:51,160
raising some important ideas

4929
02:47:51,160 --> 02:47:53,160
and themes but with a sense of humor about it.

4930
02:47:53,160 --> 02:47:55,160
You take another step forward and here

4931
02:47:55,160 --> 02:47:57,160
I am again, like your own

4932
02:47:57,160 --> 02:47:59,160
reflection repeated in a hall of mirrors.

4933
02:47:59,160 --> 02:48:01,160
That makes me one ugly son of a bitch.

4934
02:48:01,160 --> 02:48:03,160
The game has multiple endings,

4935
02:48:03,160 --> 02:48:05,160
all three of which have different implications

4936
02:48:05,160 --> 02:48:07,160
for the future of the world.

4937
02:48:07,160 --> 02:48:09,160
You can let things continue as normal but with a slightly

4938
02:48:09,160 --> 02:48:11,160
more benevolent dictatorship in place run by you

4939
02:48:11,160 --> 02:48:13,160
and that guy who loves betraying people.

4940
02:48:13,160 --> 02:48:15,160
But I'm sure it'll all work out fine.

4941
02:48:15,160 --> 02:48:17,160
Wait, that's not a good-sounding Paradise Lost quote.

4942
02:48:17,160 --> 02:48:19,160
Oh, shit. Are we the baddies?

4943
02:48:19,160 --> 02:48:21,160
Or you can shut off all advanced

4944
02:48:21,160 --> 02:48:23,160
information technology and plunge the world

4945
02:48:23,160 --> 02:48:25,160
into a new dark age where YouTubers

4946
02:48:25,160 --> 02:48:27,160
have to provide something of value to society

4947
02:48:27,160 --> 02:48:29,160
or you can fuse with an advanced AI

4948
02:48:29,160 --> 02:48:31,160
and become a kind of all-knowing god

4949
02:48:31,160 --> 02:48:33,160
from the machine. Hey, look, it's the title.

4950
02:48:33,160 --> 02:48:35,160
But now the question is, how the hell

4951
02:48:35,160 --> 02:48:37,160
do you make another one of these?

4952
02:48:37,160 --> 02:48:39,160
Do you decide on one ending being canon

4953
02:48:39,160 --> 02:48:41,160
and hope for the best? Do you ask for a player's

4954
02:48:41,160 --> 02:48:43,160
save file and try to react to their choices

4955
02:48:43,160 --> 02:48:45,160
and retcon all the big ones

4956
02:48:45,160 --> 02:48:47,160
because you can't be bothered? Or do you embody

4957
02:48:47,160 --> 02:48:49,160
the spirit of Deus Ex's madness

4958
02:48:49,160 --> 02:48:51,160
and push it even further

4959
02:48:51,160 --> 02:48:53,160
and put jet boosters on the trolley?

4960
02:48:53,160 --> 02:48:55,160
Ah! No!

4961
02:48:55,160 --> 02:48:57,160
Enter Deus Ex Invisible War,

4962
02:48:57,160 --> 02:48:59,160
the game equivalent of trying to replace sleep

4963
02:48:59,160 --> 02:49:01,160
with your ADHD medication.

4964
02:49:01,160 --> 02:49:03,160
Which ending is canon? All of them.

4965
02:49:03,160 --> 02:49:05,160
At once! J.C. Denton

4966
02:49:05,160 --> 02:49:07,160
fused with an advanced AI and became

4967
02:49:07,160 --> 02:49:09,160
a godlike, hyper-intelligent super being

4968
02:49:09,160 --> 02:49:11,160
but also all the technology

4969
02:49:11,160 --> 02:49:13,160
in the world shut off, which kind of messed

4970
02:49:13,160 --> 02:49:15,160
with his plans, but also the fucking

4971
02:49:15,160 --> 02:49:17,160
Illuminati are still running around,

4972
02:49:17,160 --> 02:49:19,160
but also there's even more Greasels now!

4973
02:49:19,160 --> 02:49:21,160
Ah! Set 20 years

4974
02:49:21,160 --> 02:49:23,160
after the most confusing day in the world,

4975
02:49:23,160 --> 02:49:25,160
Invisible War tries to follow up

4976
02:49:25,160 --> 02:49:27,160
on the original with intriguing new perspectives

4977
02:49:27,160 --> 02:49:29,160
and ironic twists and

4978
02:49:29,160 --> 02:49:31,160
tries to tell a new story of its own

4979
02:49:31,160 --> 02:49:33,160
with new characters while it's at it.

4980
02:49:33,160 --> 02:49:35,160
Then those two things smash into each other

4981
02:49:35,160 --> 02:49:37,160
and create the most fascinating mess

4982
02:49:37,160 --> 02:49:39,160
of a story ever conceived.

4983
02:49:39,160 --> 02:49:41,160
It's less X-Files boxed set and more

4984
02:49:41,160 --> 02:49:43,160
trying to figure out the plot of X-Files

4985
02:49:43,160 --> 02:49:45,160
from Fox Mulder best moments compilation

4986
02:49:45,160 --> 02:49:47,160
number 11.

4987
02:49:47,160 --> 02:49:49,160
Woo! How is this in part 11?

4988
02:49:49,160 --> 02:49:51,160
This is at least a number four. I love this game.

4989
02:49:51,160 --> 02:49:53,160
Is it good? I don't know, but it's

4990
02:49:53,160 --> 02:49:55,160
definitely the most. This game has

4991
02:49:55,160 --> 02:49:57,160
four radically different endings

4992
02:49:57,160 --> 02:49:59,160
that each permanently alter the world

4993
02:49:59,160 --> 02:50:01,160
even more than the originals did,

4994
02:50:01,160 --> 02:50:03,160
ranging from wiping out almost all life

4995
02:50:03,160 --> 02:50:05,160
to uniting human consciousness

4996
02:50:05,160 --> 02:50:07,160
in a new way of being.

4997
02:50:07,160 --> 02:50:09,160
So one question, how do you make a sequel

4998
02:50:09,160 --> 02:50:11,160
to this? If someone asks you

4999
02:50:11,160 --> 02:50:13,160
to make Deus Ex 3,

5000
02:50:13,160 --> 02:50:15,160
as it was tentatively titled in its early teasers,

5001
02:50:15,160 --> 02:50:17,160
they're trying to trick you into

5002
02:50:17,160 --> 02:50:19,160
destroying your career. So

5003
02:50:19,160 --> 02:50:21,160
what do you do? You make a prequel.

5004
02:50:21,160 --> 02:50:23,160
Oh, no!

5005
02:50:23,160 --> 02:50:25,160
Prequels can be great, but they often

5006
02:50:25,160 --> 02:50:27,160
have to carry a lot of excess baggage.

5007
02:50:27,160 --> 02:50:29,160
This is all the stuff we didn't need

5008
02:50:29,160 --> 02:50:31,160
to see to enjoy the original, so

5009
02:50:31,160 --> 02:50:33,160
seeing it is by definition kind of

5010
02:50:33,160 --> 02:50:35,160
unnecessary. You know his name.

5011
02:50:35,160 --> 02:50:37,160
You know his methods.

5012
02:50:37,160 --> 02:50:39,160
And this February, you learn

5013
02:50:39,160 --> 02:50:41,160
that at some point he started

5014
02:50:41,160 --> 02:50:43,160
doing those things.

5015
02:50:43,160 --> 02:50:45,160
Holy shit, this movie's fucking

5016
02:50:45,160 --> 02:50:47,160
terrible, and in interactive media

5017
02:50:47,160 --> 02:50:49,160
this can be even worse because now

5018
02:50:49,160 --> 02:50:51,160
your interaction is being limited

5019
02:50:51,160 --> 02:50:53,160
by what's supposed to happen next.

5020
02:50:53,160 --> 02:50:55,160
You killed the future.

5021
02:50:55,160 --> 02:50:57,160
You created a time paradox.

5022
02:50:57,160 --> 02:50:59,160
Okay, in context, that's kind of

5023
02:50:59,160 --> 02:51:01,160
meant as a joke. Uh, let's do a real

5024
02:51:01,160 --> 02:51:03,160
example. Stalker, Shadow of Chernobyl,

5025
02:51:03,160 --> 02:51:05,160
began with the marked one on the battle bus with

5026
02:51:05,160 --> 02:51:07,160
the quest to down Strelok at the Tilted Towers.

5027
02:51:07,160 --> 02:51:09,160
Whether he succeeded in his quest or

5028
02:51:09,160 --> 02:51:11,160
if he merely got showered with money to

5029
02:51:11,160 --> 02:51:13,160
death was based on your actions.

5030
02:51:13,160 --> 02:51:15,160
Then Stalker got a prequel.

5031
02:51:15,160 --> 02:51:17,160
Clear Sky has many problems, one of them

5032
02:51:17,160 --> 02:51:19,160
being it's the successor to a game with a lot

5033
02:51:19,160 --> 02:51:21,160
of endings and some big twists which

5034
02:51:21,160 --> 02:51:23,160
itself has no real twists and can

5035
02:51:23,160 --> 02:51:25,160
only end one way, and then Shadow

5036
02:51:25,160 --> 02:51:27,160
of Chernobyl happens.

5037
02:51:27,160 --> 02:51:29,160
You spend 10 to 30 hours helping

5038
02:51:29,160 --> 02:51:31,160
the marked one catch his bus.

5039
02:51:31,160 --> 02:51:33,160
People who play didn't know what I'm talking about.

5040
02:51:33,160 --> 02:51:35,160
Honestly, I could talk for hours about how you...

5041
02:51:35,160 --> 02:51:37,160
No, Rachel, I won't let you stop me this time.

5042
02:51:37,160 --> 02:51:40,160
The people need to know. Is that a taser?

5043
02:51:40,160 --> 02:51:43,160
♪♪

5044
02:51:43,160 --> 02:51:45,160
So yeah, prequels are something you generally

5045
02:51:45,160 --> 02:51:47,160
want to avoid unless you've got a really

5046
02:51:47,160 --> 02:51:49,160
good idea for it.

5047
02:51:49,160 --> 02:51:51,160
But as we've established,

5048
02:51:51,160 --> 02:51:53,160
Eidos Montreal didn't really have much

5049
02:51:53,160 --> 02:51:55,160
of a choice. They're kind of between a rock

5050
02:51:55,160 --> 02:51:57,160
and a hard place here. I mean, I guess they could

5051
02:51:57,160 --> 02:51:59,160
do a reboot, but rebooting the franchise

5052
02:51:59,160 --> 02:52:01,160
kind of isn't ideal either. You really

5053
02:52:01,160 --> 02:52:03,160
should never do one of those, Eidos Montreal.

5054
02:52:03,160 --> 02:52:05,160
Oh, no! Given that all of the options

5055
02:52:05,160 --> 02:52:07,160
were kind of bad, it does beg the question

5056
02:52:07,160 --> 02:52:09,160
why make a Deus Ex game at all

5057
02:52:09,160 --> 02:52:11,160
apart from brand recognition?

5058
02:52:11,160 --> 02:52:13,160
Well, it might shock you, but the answer is

5059
02:52:13,160 --> 02:52:15,160
brand recognition. Did you ever wonder why

5060
02:52:15,160 --> 02:52:17,160
the next Prey was called Prey

5061
02:52:17,160 --> 02:52:19,160
and not, I don't know, New Space Game

5062
02:52:19,160 --> 02:52:21,160
even though it's nothing like Prey?

5063
02:52:21,160 --> 02:52:23,160
God, these names are confusing.

5064
02:52:23,160 --> 02:52:25,160
It's because the money men at Bethesda

5065
02:52:25,160 --> 02:52:27,160
or Eidos Square Enix aren't going to spend

5066
02:52:27,160 --> 02:52:29,160
millions of dollars and years of dev time

5067
02:52:29,160 --> 02:52:31,160
on an ambitious risk-taking original

5068
02:52:31,160 --> 02:52:33,160
idea unless it's got a vaguely

5069
02:52:33,160 --> 02:52:35,160
bankable name. We already had in mind

5070
02:52:35,160 --> 02:52:37,160
the kind of game we were making, and then

5071
02:52:37,160 --> 02:52:39,160
Bethesda said, hey, what about using this name?

5072
02:52:39,160 --> 02:52:41,160
Hey! Why don't you call it Prey, guys?

5073
02:52:41,160 --> 02:52:43,160
We killed the company that was making

5074
02:52:43,160 --> 02:52:45,160
the original Prey 2 even though

5075
02:52:45,160 --> 02:52:47,160
it was basically finished because they wouldn't

5076
02:52:47,160 --> 02:52:49,160
let us buy them. That's a true story.

5077
02:52:49,160 --> 02:52:51,160
Look it up.

5078
02:52:51,160 --> 02:52:53,160
So now we have this name lying around.

5079
02:52:53,160 --> 02:52:55,160
Prey 2017's great, don't get me wrong,

5080
02:52:55,160 --> 02:52:57,160
and the devs had a lot of creative

5081
02:52:57,160 --> 02:52:59,160
freedom with it except for the name.

5082
02:52:59,160 --> 02:53:01,160
That game had to be Prey somehow.

5083
02:53:01,160 --> 02:53:03,160
This is why, at least in the AAA

5084
02:53:03,160 --> 02:53:05,160
gaming space, original big-budget

5085
02:53:05,160 --> 02:53:07,160
games are surprisingly rare, but you can

5086
02:53:07,160 --> 02:53:09,160
expect endless sequels, prequels,

5087
02:53:09,160 --> 02:53:11,160
reboots, and

5088
02:53:11,160 --> 02:53:13,160
remasters of popular existing

5089
02:53:13,160 --> 02:53:15,160
properties until you're cold in your grave.

5090
02:53:15,160 --> 02:53:17,160
What have you done?

5091
02:53:17,160 --> 02:53:19,160
Why does he look? Because when you're talking

5092
02:53:19,160 --> 02:53:21,160
years of work and tens of millions

5093
02:53:21,160 --> 02:53:23,160
of state-subsidized Canadian fun bucks,

5094
02:53:23,160 --> 02:53:25,160
you need to provide at least some proof

5095
02:53:25,160 --> 02:53:27,160
of a return on investment, and the

5096
02:53:27,160 --> 02:53:29,160
best way to do that is to be called

5097
02:53:29,160 --> 02:53:31,160
famous thing colon more shit.

5098
02:53:31,160 --> 02:53:33,160
Maybe none of this is true and the

5099
02:53:33,160 --> 02:53:35,160
creators really wanted to specifically

5100
02:53:35,160 --> 02:53:37,160
make the next Deus Ex game, but if that's

5101
02:53:37,160 --> 02:53:39,160
the case, I think it was a poor choice.

5102
02:53:39,160 --> 02:53:41,160
You see, now you have to design your game around

5103
02:53:41,160 --> 02:53:43,160
dodging the complaints of losers who care

5104
02:53:43,160 --> 02:53:45,160
about the Deus Ex timeline. Losers like

5105
02:53:45,160 --> 02:53:47,160
me prepare to be destroyed.

5106
02:53:47,160 --> 02:53:49,160
What I'm getting at is the story is trying

5107
02:53:49,160 --> 02:53:51,160
to be unique and original, but also

5108
02:53:51,160 --> 02:53:53,160
very self-conscious about looking like

5109
02:53:53,160 --> 02:53:55,160
it definitely will lead into Deus Ex

5110
02:53:55,160 --> 02:53:57,160
maybe someday.

5111
02:53:57,160 --> 02:53:59,160
This approach damages both the game's

5112
02:53:59,160 --> 02:54:01,160
ability to relate to the other games and

5113
02:54:01,160 --> 02:54:03,160
its ability to tell the original story

5114
02:54:03,160 --> 02:54:05,160
it clearly desperately wants to.

5115
02:54:05,160 --> 02:54:07,160
Before you can even explore the story

5116
02:54:07,160 --> 02:54:09,160
that is here, you have to excavate it from

5117
02:54:09,160 --> 02:54:11,160
under a pile of distracting references

5118
02:54:11,160 --> 02:54:13,160
to the original. For example,

5119
02:54:13,160 --> 02:54:15,160
J.C. Denton's boss, Joseph Manderly,

5120
02:54:15,160 --> 02:54:17,160
is referenced like a dozen times throughout

5121
02:54:17,160 --> 02:54:19,160
the plot like he's a major player

5122
02:54:19,160 --> 02:54:21,160
directly involved with the important stuff

5123
02:54:21,160 --> 02:54:22,160
you're dealing with.

5124
02:54:22,160 --> 02:54:24,160
We've been compromised.

5125
02:54:24,160 --> 02:54:26,160
Manderly was supposed to have that morgue locked down,

5126
02:54:26,160 --> 02:54:28,160
but somebody got to the corpse before we did.

5127
02:54:28,160 --> 02:54:30,160
Like, this guy's so important,

5128
02:54:30,160 --> 02:54:32,160
he's getting name-dropped in the pre-rendered

5129
02:54:32,160 --> 02:54:34,160
cutscenes by bosses. What would

5130
02:54:34,160 --> 02:54:36,160
an ordinary player think this is setting up?

5131
02:54:36,160 --> 02:54:38,160
You the home sec guy I was ordered to wait for?

5132
02:54:38,160 --> 02:54:40,160
Tell Manderly I didn't get the memo

5133
02:54:40,160 --> 02:54:42,160
until I was halfway through the autopsy.

5134
02:54:42,160 --> 02:54:44,160
Maybe the story that you're playing?

5135
02:54:44,160 --> 02:54:45,160
Right?

5136
02:54:45,160 --> 02:54:46,160
Someone in the government,

5137
02:54:46,160 --> 02:54:47,160
a man named Manderly,

5138
02:54:47,160 --> 02:54:49,160
ordered that a specially appointed

5139
02:54:49,160 --> 02:54:51,160
medical examiner perform the autopsy.

5140
02:54:51,160 --> 02:54:53,160
So you think, I get it. This guy's a big deal.

5141
02:54:53,160 --> 02:54:56,160
Maybe we meet or even fight him later?

5142
02:54:56,160 --> 02:54:58,160
No. They eventually just stop mentioning him.

5143
02:54:58,160 --> 02:55:00,160
If you were trying to figure out what was up

5144
02:55:00,160 --> 02:55:02,160
with Manderly or find him,

5145
02:55:02,160 --> 02:55:03,160
you were wasting your time.

5146
02:55:03,160 --> 02:55:04,160
This isn't part of the story.

5147
02:55:04,160 --> 02:55:06,160
This was the game's attempt to tie itself

5148
02:55:06,160 --> 02:55:07,160
into the series more,

5149
02:55:07,160 --> 02:55:09,160
but they've gone about it in a way

5150
02:55:09,160 --> 02:55:11,160
that makes the actual story you're trying to follow

5151
02:55:11,160 --> 02:55:13,160
really annoying because it's full of stuff

5152
02:55:13,160 --> 02:55:15,160
you think you're supposed to pay attention to

5153
02:55:15,160 --> 02:55:16,160
that turns out to be fan service

5154
02:55:16,160 --> 02:55:17,160
and doesn't go anywhere.

5155
02:55:17,160 --> 02:55:19,160
I'm sure they were trying to be subtle about it

5156
02:55:19,160 --> 02:55:21,160
so their own story had room to breathe.

5157
02:55:21,160 --> 02:55:23,160
In fact, here's Mary DeMalle saying that.

5158
02:55:23,160 --> 02:55:25,160
Well, the good thing about doing the prequel

5159
02:55:25,160 --> 02:55:27,160
is that if you haven't played the game before,

5160
02:55:27,160 --> 02:55:29,160
you don't have to worry about it.

5161
02:55:29,160 --> 02:55:31,160
You don't have to suddenly become,

5162
02:55:31,160 --> 02:55:33,160
like, oh, what's going on?

5163
02:55:33,160 --> 02:55:35,160
I think she had the right idea here.

5164
02:55:35,160 --> 02:55:37,160
This was a story that first and foremost

5165
02:55:37,160 --> 02:55:38,160
needed to work on its own merits,

5166
02:55:38,160 --> 02:55:40,160
but there is frankly too much

5167
02:55:40,160 --> 02:55:42,160
Deus Ex One stuff in here for that to happen.

5168
02:55:42,160 --> 02:55:44,160
The first thing you see in the game

5169
02:55:44,160 --> 02:55:46,160
in the opening is this guy, Bob Page,

5170
02:55:46,160 --> 02:55:48,160
the antagonist of Deus Ex One

5171
02:55:48,160 --> 02:55:49,160
and also the first guy you see

5172
02:55:49,160 --> 02:55:51,160
in the opening of that game too.

5173
02:55:51,160 --> 02:55:53,160
You need to know Bob Page is behind this

5174
02:55:53,160 --> 02:55:55,160
for some reason even though he never appears

5175
02:55:55,160 --> 02:55:56,160
in the actual game.

5176
02:55:56,160 --> 02:55:58,160
He turns up after the credits.

5177
02:55:58,160 --> 02:56:00,160
I'm looking forward to seeing the hybrid project

5178
02:56:00,160 --> 02:56:01,160
up close, Mr. Page.

5179
02:56:01,160 --> 02:56:04,160
But please...

5180
02:56:04,160 --> 02:56:06,160
call me Bob.

5181
02:56:06,160 --> 02:56:08,160
This shot in the post-credits scene

5182
02:56:08,160 --> 02:56:10,160
is reused from the opening too.

5183
02:56:10,160 --> 02:56:12,160
I don't know whether to be annoyed how lazy this was

5184
02:56:12,160 --> 02:56:14,160
or glad they didn't waste too much effort

5185
02:56:14,160 --> 02:56:16,160
on something so unnecessary.

5186
02:56:16,160 --> 02:56:17,160
People who are playing this first,

5187
02:56:17,160 --> 02:56:19,160
and for a lot of people this was their introduction

5188
02:56:19,160 --> 02:56:21,160
to the series, will spend the entire game

5189
02:56:21,160 --> 02:56:24,160
wondering who the hell that guy the intro focused on was,

5190
02:56:24,160 --> 02:56:26,160
and they will never get an answer.

5191
02:56:26,160 --> 02:56:28,160
I love when my first experience of a series

5192
02:56:28,160 --> 02:56:30,160
is a bunch of shit I can't possibly understand.

5193
02:56:30,160 --> 02:56:32,160
There's a bit during the walk and talk

5194
02:56:32,160 --> 02:56:34,160
a few minutes later where a guy drops a reference

5195
02:56:34,160 --> 02:56:36,160
to Page Industries, and this one's kind of cute.

5196
02:56:36,160 --> 02:56:38,160
Players who knew what Page Industries was

5197
02:56:38,160 --> 02:56:40,160
would get it, and players who didn't

5198
02:56:40,160 --> 02:56:42,160
could write it off as world building and office banter.

5199
02:56:42,160 --> 02:56:44,160
This subtlety would have worked really well,

5200
02:56:44,160 --> 02:56:47,160
but you've already blown past subtle references

5201
02:56:47,160 --> 02:56:49,160
to Bob Page when you began the game

5202
02:56:49,160 --> 02:56:52,160
with a minute and a half intro starring Bob Page

5203
02:56:52,160 --> 02:56:54,160
even though he's not even in the game.

5204
02:56:54,160 --> 02:56:56,160
I'm a little paged out, buddy.

5205
02:56:56,160 --> 02:56:58,160
The opening, ending, and quite a lot in between

5206
02:56:58,160 --> 02:57:01,160
is an extended reminder of a different story

5207
02:57:01,160 --> 02:57:03,160
you could be playing instead.

5208
02:57:03,160 --> 02:57:05,160
People who know who Lucius De Beers is

5209
02:57:05,160 --> 02:57:07,160
aren't gonna clap their hands like a circus seal

5210
02:57:07,160 --> 02:57:09,160
when they see his name turn up, and people who don't

5211
02:57:09,160 --> 02:57:11,160
are gonna wonder why they keep reading emails

5212
02:57:11,160 --> 02:57:14,160
about people they don't know who don't turn up in the story.

5213
02:57:14,160 --> 02:57:16,160
All these problems come to a head in,

5214
02:57:16,160 --> 02:57:19,160
where else, the pre-order DLC.

5215
02:57:19,160 --> 02:57:21,160
If you got the explosive mission pack,

5216
02:57:21,160 --> 02:57:23,160
at one point you literally take a break

5217
02:57:23,160 --> 02:57:25,160
from the story you're playing

5218
02:57:25,160 --> 02:57:27,160
to help rescue a main character you've never met before

5219
02:57:27,160 --> 02:57:29,160
to help them get onto a boat

5220
02:57:29,160 --> 02:57:32,160
to the place they need to be 20 years later.

5221
02:57:32,160 --> 02:57:34,160
The most relevant interaction Adam Jensen has

5222
02:57:34,160 --> 02:57:36,160
with the plot of Deus Ex 1

5223
02:57:36,160 --> 02:57:38,160
is to help a guy catch his bus.

5224
02:57:38,160 --> 02:57:40,160
During the escape sequence with the bomb,

5225
02:57:40,160 --> 02:57:42,160
you see him get on his boat, the Tracer.

5226
02:57:42,160 --> 02:57:44,160
Wow, how long did that take you?

5227
02:57:44,160 --> 02:57:46,160
But rescuing Tong was pre-order content

5228
02:57:46,160 --> 02:57:48,160
a majority of players didn't get to do,

5229
02:57:48,160 --> 02:57:50,160
and since this cut scene is pre-rendered

5230
02:57:50,160 --> 02:57:52,160
and happens the same way no matter what,

5231
02:57:52,160 --> 02:57:54,160
there isn't an alternative version

5232
02:57:54,160 --> 02:57:56,160
for if you didn't get the rescue Tong mission.

5233
02:57:56,160 --> 02:57:59,160
So most players' experience of this element of the story

5234
02:57:59,160 --> 02:58:01,160
is some guy they've never seen before

5235
02:58:01,160 --> 02:58:03,160
turns up for five seconds, waves at Adam

5236
02:58:03,160 --> 02:58:05,160
like you're supposed to know who he is,

5237
02:58:05,160 --> 02:58:07,160
and people who haven't played the original

5238
02:58:07,160 --> 02:58:09,160
are left asking, wait, who are you?

5239
02:58:09,160 --> 02:58:11,160
Guess you should have pre-ordered from GameStop.

5240
02:58:11,160 --> 02:58:13,160
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

5241
02:58:13,160 --> 02:58:15,160
I feel bad making this criticism because

5242
02:58:15,160 --> 02:58:17,160
for the reasons we've explored, it's not like they had

5243
02:58:17,160 --> 02:58:19,160
much of a choice in making their project

5244
02:58:19,160 --> 02:58:21,160
have to also work as a prequel,

5245
02:58:21,160 --> 02:58:23,160
and how they handled it is just kicking someone

5246
02:58:23,160 --> 02:58:25,160
while they're down, which in Quebec I think

5247
02:58:25,160 --> 02:58:27,160
they would call a, uh, folks pass,

5248
02:58:27,160 --> 02:58:29,160
but Deus Ex is one of the best stories

5249
02:58:29,160 --> 02:58:31,160
in the history of gaming, and Human Revolution

5250
02:58:31,160 --> 02:58:33,160
isn't doing its own story any favors

5251
02:58:33,160 --> 02:58:35,160
by reminding fans of the much better story

5252
02:58:35,160 --> 02:58:37,160
they actually liked.

5253
02:58:37,160 --> 02:58:39,160
So when the story isn't trying to shoehorn in

5254
02:58:39,160 --> 02:58:41,160
confusing and unnecessary references to the first game,

5255
02:58:41,160 --> 02:58:44,160
what is the story of this one actually about?

5256
02:58:44,160 --> 02:58:46,160
♪♪

5257
02:58:46,160 --> 02:58:48,160
Sorry, there's a typo there.

5258
02:58:49,160 --> 02:58:51,160
Now, since it's a video game,

5259
02:58:51,160 --> 02:58:54,160
we're grading on a really weirdly shaped curve here.

5260
02:58:54,160 --> 02:58:56,160
They won an award for the writing

5261
02:58:56,160 --> 02:58:58,160
at the Canadian Video Game Awards that year,

5262
02:58:58,160 --> 02:59:01,160
beating out other games like Assassin's Creed Revelations

5263
02:59:01,160 --> 02:59:03,160
and Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine.

5264
02:59:03,160 --> 02:59:05,160
Wow, what stiff competition.

5265
02:59:05,160 --> 02:59:07,160
This game's story is not great,

5266
02:59:07,160 --> 02:59:11,160
but also much, much better than most other video games

5267
02:59:11,160 --> 02:59:13,160
by such a wide margin it feels wrong

5268
02:59:13,160 --> 02:59:15,160
criticizing it too hard.

5269
02:59:15,160 --> 02:59:17,160
The performances are fantastic. Well, mostly.

5270
02:59:17,160 --> 02:59:19,160
Someone's not coming back for the sequel,

5271
02:59:19,160 --> 02:59:21,160
and there's some solid comedy in there too.

5272
02:59:21,160 --> 02:59:23,160
There's a fantastic part where you're supposed

5273
02:59:23,160 --> 02:59:24,160
to tell a code phrase to a guy,

5274
02:59:24,160 --> 02:59:26,160
and you can just get it wrong on purpose.

5275
02:59:48,160 --> 02:59:50,160
You don't even fail the mission for doing this.

5276
02:59:50,160 --> 02:59:52,160
It's just cool, and there's some neat setup

5277
02:59:52,160 --> 02:59:54,160
and payoff like, oh, see this guy showing his arm off

5278
02:59:54,160 --> 02:59:56,160
to the camera to make sure you see it?

5279
02:59:56,160 --> 02:59:58,160
That arm is gonna turn out to be important

5280
02:59:58,160 --> 02:59:59,160
three quarters of the game from now.

5281
02:59:59,160 --> 03:00:01,160
There's nothing wrong with the writing

5282
03:00:01,160 --> 03:00:02,160
in, say, the cut scenes,

5283
03:00:02,160 --> 03:00:04,160
even if they take away some player control.

5284
03:00:04,160 --> 03:00:06,160
The issue is that all of this writing

5285
03:00:06,160 --> 03:00:09,160
is happening around a badly written central plot.

5286
03:00:09,160 --> 03:00:11,160
Deus Ex Human Revolution is centrally

5287
03:00:11,160 --> 03:00:12,160
about the issue of augmentation

5288
03:00:12,160 --> 03:00:14,160
and whether it's good or not.

5289
03:00:14,160 --> 03:00:17,160
Deus Ex Human Revolution centers around

5290
03:00:17,160 --> 03:00:19,160
the use of mechanical augmentations

5291
03:00:19,160 --> 03:00:22,160
and how this technology has spread through the world

5292
03:00:22,160 --> 03:00:24,160
and how it is affecting the world.

5293
03:00:24,160 --> 03:00:25,160
It's not that the world is full of stuff,

5294
03:00:25,160 --> 03:00:27,160
but the main focus is augmentation.

5295
03:00:27,160 --> 03:00:29,160
It's that the world is full of people

5296
03:00:29,160 --> 03:00:31,160
discussing augmentation and nothing else

5297
03:00:31,160 --> 03:00:33,160
unless they're referencing Deus Ex 1.

5298
03:00:33,160 --> 03:00:35,160
Almost everyone in the universe of Human Revolution

5299
03:00:35,160 --> 03:00:38,160
has an opinion about whether having robot arms is good

5300
03:00:38,160 --> 03:00:41,160
or the death knell of the human soul.

5301
03:00:41,160 --> 03:00:44,160
What's all the fuss about this augmentation technology?

5302
03:00:44,160 --> 03:00:46,160
What are you looking at, pal?

5303
03:00:46,160 --> 03:00:49,160
Scanning me with those metal eyes of yours?

5304
03:00:49,160 --> 03:00:52,160
No offense, but, uh, if it were up to me,

5305
03:00:52,160 --> 03:00:55,160
this place would have a no-arg policy.

5306
03:00:55,160 --> 03:00:58,160
Hope you enjoy those fancy hands of yours

5307
03:00:58,160 --> 03:01:01,160
because in less than a year, they'll be worthless.

5308
03:01:01,160 --> 03:01:03,160
The rote mechanical insistence

5309
03:01:03,160 --> 03:01:05,160
on covering one and only one topic

5310
03:01:05,160 --> 03:01:07,160
makes the world strangely uncanny.

5311
03:01:07,160 --> 03:01:09,160
Have you seen the neural enhancements

5312
03:01:09,160 --> 03:01:11,160
they're coming up with these days?

5313
03:01:11,160 --> 03:01:13,160
How far are they gonna go?

5314
03:01:13,160 --> 03:01:15,160
In his apartment building,

5315
03:01:15,160 --> 03:01:17,160
Adam Jensen overhears a fight in another room.

5316
03:01:17,160 --> 03:01:19,160
A man has caught his wife cheating.

5317
03:01:19,160 --> 03:01:21,160
It's tense and upsetting, and for a brief moment,

5318
03:01:21,160 --> 03:01:23,160
it feels like you're in a world

5319
03:01:23,160 --> 03:01:25,160
with a bunch of different stories happening in it.

5320
03:01:25,160 --> 03:01:28,160
Then it turns out she cheated because they're both augmented.

5321
03:01:28,160 --> 03:01:30,160
I guess I wanted to be reminded of what it was like

5322
03:01:30,160 --> 03:01:33,160
to be with someone normal.

5323
03:01:33,160 --> 03:01:36,160
You were the one who wanted us to get enhanced.

5324
03:01:36,160 --> 03:01:38,160
Now you're saying we're not normal anymore.

5325
03:01:39,160 --> 03:01:41,160
Well, now try not to touch me too often

5326
03:01:41,160 --> 03:01:45,160
with my cold, dead, metal hand, okay?

5327
03:01:45,160 --> 03:01:47,160
I'm sad about my metal hand.

5328
03:01:47,160 --> 03:01:49,160
Ah! That's the story in a nutshell.

5329
03:01:49,160 --> 03:01:51,160
Granted, it's not quite as iconic

5330
03:01:51,160 --> 03:01:53,160
as I never asked for this.

5331
03:01:53,160 --> 03:01:55,160
Purity First's motivations are that they don't like

5332
03:01:55,160 --> 03:01:58,160
augmentations because they pollute the human body.

5333
03:01:58,160 --> 03:02:00,160
They hate them for this vague reason

5334
03:02:00,160 --> 03:02:02,160
so much they're willing to break into buildings,

5335
03:02:02,160 --> 03:02:05,160
take hostages, kill them with gas, and so on.

5336
03:02:05,160 --> 03:02:07,160
They dress evocative of Christian monks

5337
03:02:07,160 --> 03:02:09,160
with the prayer rope and everything

5338
03:02:09,160 --> 03:02:12,160
and wear a band over their arms with their group's logo on it.

5339
03:02:12,160 --> 03:02:14,160
Wow, I wonder what this is meant to remind people of.

5340
03:02:14,160 --> 03:02:17,160
Jesus Christ, you killed him, huh?

5341
03:02:17,160 --> 03:02:18,160
He asked for it.

5342
03:02:18,160 --> 03:02:20,160
Kept calling me a bigot.

5343
03:02:20,160 --> 03:02:22,160
He called me a bigot, so I murdered him.

5344
03:02:22,160 --> 03:02:24,160
You see, when you zoom in really closely

5345
03:02:24,160 --> 03:02:26,160
on one aspect of your setting,

5346
03:02:26,160 --> 03:02:28,160
you obscure the big picture in ways

5347
03:02:28,160 --> 03:02:30,160
that make it less interesting than if it was part of the whole.

5348
03:02:30,160 --> 03:02:32,160
Take Detroit, the city the American portions

5349
03:02:32,160 --> 03:02:34,160
of the game are set in.

5350
03:02:34,160 --> 03:02:36,160
Detroit, historically, is a city that was once prosperous,

5351
03:02:36,160 --> 03:02:38,160
then went through a major decline

5352
03:02:38,160 --> 03:02:40,160
as a result of the auto industry shipping

5353
03:02:40,160 --> 03:02:42,160
most of the work to places that didn't have strong unions

5354
03:02:42,160 --> 03:02:44,160
so they could pay them less.

5355
03:02:44,160 --> 03:02:46,160
People in poorer countries and eventually robots

5356
03:02:46,160 --> 03:02:48,160
in poorer countries make the cars

5357
03:02:48,160 --> 03:02:50,160
they used to make in Detroit.

5358
03:02:50,160 --> 03:02:52,160
There was also redlining, which effectively denied

5359
03:02:52,160 --> 03:02:54,160
Black Detroiters the opportunities afforded

5360
03:02:54,160 --> 03:02:56,160
by stable home ownership or being able

5361
03:02:56,160 --> 03:02:58,160
to open new businesses of their own,

5362
03:02:58,160 --> 03:03:00,160
which helped to ensure the economy had even less chance

5363
03:03:00,160 --> 03:03:02,160
of recovering, and the thing is,

5364
03:03:02,160 --> 03:03:04,160
the economic effects of historic racism

5365
03:03:04,160 --> 03:03:06,160
don't go away overnight.

5366
03:03:06,160 --> 03:03:08,160
When we invent cures for cancer or improved

5367
03:03:08,160 --> 03:03:10,160
human body parts that don't get sick

5368
03:03:10,160 --> 03:03:12,160
or let us run faster or jump higher

5369
03:03:12,160 --> 03:03:14,160
or think harder, people from economically

5370
03:03:14,160 --> 03:03:17,160
disadvantaged groups will have the least access.

5371
03:03:17,160 --> 03:03:19,160
The rich will be building themselves better,

5372
03:03:19,160 --> 03:03:21,160
and the poor will not.

5373
03:03:21,160 --> 03:03:23,160
Meanwhile, if augmentation becomes necessary

5374
03:03:23,160 --> 03:03:25,160
for certain jobs, like, say,

5375
03:03:25,160 --> 03:03:27,160
truck drivers can get their brains augmented

5376
03:03:27,160 --> 03:03:29,160
so they can drive all night without traditional

5377
03:03:29,160 --> 03:03:31,160
need for sleep, that might become

5378
03:03:31,160 --> 03:03:33,160
the expected norm for the job.

5379
03:03:33,160 --> 03:03:35,160
While people might only hire drivers who don't need

5380
03:03:35,160 --> 03:03:37,160
breaks to sleep, wage slavery would take on

5381
03:03:37,160 --> 03:03:39,160
even more physical connotations.

5382
03:03:39,160 --> 03:03:41,160
You could make a game about that idea,

5383
03:03:41,160 --> 03:03:43,160
and this stuff is discussed

5384
03:03:43,160 --> 03:03:45,160
at least briefly during the game.

5385
03:03:45,160 --> 03:03:47,160
Several homeless NPCs talk about how they lost

5386
03:03:47,160 --> 03:03:49,160
their jobs for refusing to be augmented,

5387
03:03:49,160 --> 03:03:51,160
and several other NPCs have serious job anxiety

5388
03:03:51,160 --> 03:03:53,160
or remark on how rich Adam must be

5389
03:03:53,160 --> 03:03:55,160
to be so augmented.

5390
03:03:55,160 --> 03:03:57,160
Listen, just because you have money

5391
03:03:57,160 --> 03:03:59,160
doesn't make you better than me.

5392
03:03:59,160 --> 03:04:01,160
The Hengsha level has a whole side quest

5393
03:04:01,160 --> 03:04:03,160
covering sex workers being forcibly augmented,

5394
03:04:03,160 --> 03:04:05,160
not just to serve clients,

5395
03:04:05,160 --> 03:04:07,160
but because it means they won't be able to quit

5396
03:04:07,160 --> 03:04:09,160
without losing access to the anti-rejection drugs

5397
03:04:09,160 --> 03:04:11,160
you have to take for life once you get an augmentation.

5398
03:04:11,160 --> 03:04:13,160
Human Revolution strays

5399
03:04:13,160 --> 03:04:15,160
dangerously close to making actual

5400
03:04:15,160 --> 03:04:17,160
real social commentary here.

5401
03:04:17,160 --> 03:04:19,160
In the last level, lots of the construction workers

5402
03:04:19,160 --> 03:04:21,160
have tools where their arms would be.

5403
03:04:21,160 --> 03:04:23,160
I'm gonna go ahead and call this body horror.

5404
03:04:23,160 --> 03:04:25,160
This is what the future might do

5405
03:04:25,160 --> 03:04:27,160
to working people, but did you see

5406
03:04:27,160 --> 03:04:29,160
how deep I had to dig to pull out that point just now?

5407
03:04:29,160 --> 03:04:31,160
This game is supposed to be about

5408
03:04:31,160 --> 03:04:33,160
human augmentation and its effect

5409
03:04:33,160 --> 03:04:35,160
on the world, but I had to talk about specific

5410
03:04:35,160 --> 03:04:37,160
random NPCs and the one

5411
03:04:37,160 --> 03:04:39,160
side quest that really went into it

5412
03:04:39,160 --> 03:04:41,160
and stare at random enemies in the last level

5413
03:04:41,160 --> 03:04:43,160
to find some kind of relevant observation.

5414
03:04:43,160 --> 03:04:45,160
If anything about this game's story

5415
03:04:45,160 --> 03:04:47,160
is lacking is how it's swimming in an ocean

5416
03:04:47,160 --> 03:04:49,160
of meaningful questions and points,

5417
03:04:49,160 --> 03:04:51,160
but the actual plot blows past it all

5418
03:04:51,160 --> 03:04:53,160
to be about terrorists who hate orgs

5419
03:04:53,160 --> 03:04:55,160
and org lovers and the bad men

5420
03:04:55,160 --> 03:04:57,160
who kidnapped your girlfriend.

5421
03:04:57,160 --> 03:04:59,160
Let's take another look at some of Purity First's

5422
03:04:59,160 --> 03:05:01,160
literature they leave strewn around the office

5423
03:05:01,160 --> 03:05:03,160
they broke into. This stuff about physical

5424
03:05:03,160 --> 03:05:05,160
limitations being human and not changing

5425
03:05:05,160 --> 03:05:07,160
the body is just bullshit.

5426
03:05:07,160 --> 03:05:09,160
These fuckers are against pacemakers.

5427
03:05:09,160 --> 03:05:11,160
They don't have a valuable point to make here,

5428
03:05:11,160 --> 03:05:13,160
and that's okay. Purity First are

5429
03:05:13,160 --> 03:05:15,160
deliberately written and presented in the game

5430
03:05:15,160 --> 03:05:17,160
as misguided radicals, which isn't

5431
03:05:17,160 --> 03:05:19,160
necessarily a bad choice, but it does mean

5432
03:05:19,160 --> 03:05:21,160
this group doesn't have anything interesting

5433
03:05:21,160 --> 03:05:23,160
to say. The NSF are a great

5434
03:05:23,160 --> 03:05:25,160
faction in the first game because their perspective

5435
03:05:25,160 --> 03:05:27,160
is genuinely interesting, at least partially

5436
03:05:27,160 --> 03:05:29,160
valid, and everything their leaders say

5437
03:05:29,160 --> 03:05:31,160
is just fucking true. There's a reason

5438
03:05:31,160 --> 03:05:33,160
every line this guy speaks is iconic.

5439
03:05:33,160 --> 03:05:35,160
You switch sides and work with

5440
03:05:35,160 --> 03:05:37,160
these guys partway through and it works

5441
03:05:37,160 --> 03:05:39,160
here because they were never presented as the

5442
03:05:39,160 --> 03:05:41,160
dumbest boys in the world, but yeah,

5443
03:05:41,160 --> 03:05:43,160
sure, hearing aids are immoral.

5444
03:05:43,160 --> 03:05:45,160
Nice one, buddy. Say hi to Ted

5445
03:05:45,160 --> 03:05:47,160
in prison for me, but here's the real shitter,

5446
03:05:47,160 --> 03:05:49,160
right? In between these two statements

5447
03:05:49,160 --> 03:05:51,160
is a really interesting one. This one

5448
03:05:51,160 --> 03:05:53,160
actually reaches for an important point.

5449
03:05:53,160 --> 03:05:55,160
It comes close to saying what a lot

5450
03:05:55,160 --> 03:05:57,160
of people say right now about modern technology

5451
03:05:57,160 --> 03:05:59,160
like electric cars or self-driving

5452
03:05:59,160 --> 03:06:01,160
cars or space rockets, namely

5453
03:06:01,160 --> 03:06:03,160
that even if they work, they're not the thing

5454
03:06:03,160 --> 03:06:05,160
humanity needs right now, and

5455
03:06:05,160 --> 03:06:07,160
wasting resources on them at a time like this

5456
03:06:07,160 --> 03:06:09,160
while so many real problems go unsolved

5457
03:06:09,160 --> 03:06:11,160
is a tragedy history won't look back

5458
03:06:11,160 --> 03:06:13,160
on kindly. If there even are any historians

5459
03:06:13,160 --> 03:06:15,160
left in 50 years, Purity

5460
03:06:15,160 --> 03:06:17,160
First could easily have been written as a

5461
03:06:17,160 --> 03:06:19,160
principled faction and represented a

5462
03:06:19,160 --> 03:06:21,160
tangible perspective, but instead

5463
03:06:21,160 --> 03:06:23,160
any of their justifiable motivations

5464
03:06:23,160 --> 03:06:25,160
are relegated to the back page of a

5465
03:06:25,160 --> 03:06:27,160
PDF and they're shooting people for calling

5466
03:06:27,160 --> 03:06:29,160
them racist. You could have, for example,

5467
03:06:29,160 --> 03:06:31,160
made them a group with a cohesive

5468
03:06:31,160 --> 03:06:33,160
ideology, like what if they were anti-augmentation

5469
03:06:33,160 --> 03:06:35,160
specifically because they saw

5470
03:06:35,160 --> 03:06:37,160
the impact it would have on working people

5471
03:06:37,160 --> 03:06:39,160
who couldn't afford them or who would be expected

5472
03:06:39,160 --> 03:06:41,160
to get them to keep their jobs?

5473
03:06:41,160 --> 03:06:43,160
What if they weren't even anti-augmentation

5474
03:06:43,160 --> 03:06:45,160
per se and this break-in was a cover

5475
03:06:45,160 --> 03:06:47,160
to steal for people who need access to

5476
03:06:47,160 --> 03:06:49,160
augmentations but can't afford them?

5477
03:06:49,160 --> 03:06:51,160
Alexander's is established as a veteran.

5478
03:06:51,160 --> 03:06:53,160
He belongs to a group that maybe could do with

5479
03:06:53,160 --> 03:06:55,160
access to replacement limbs. There were so

5480
03:06:55,160 --> 03:06:57,160
many compelling ways of writing this group

5481
03:06:57,160 --> 03:06:59,160
but instead they went with the Nazi

5482
03:06:59,160 --> 03:07:01,160
sash-wearing purity terrorist gang.

5483
03:07:01,160 --> 03:07:03,160
You think we're breaking the law.

5484
03:07:03,160 --> 03:07:05,160
Shut up!

5485
03:07:05,160 --> 03:07:07,160
All you body polluters break laws.

5486
03:07:07,160 --> 03:07:09,160
You're all the same. I don't like augmentations

5487
03:07:09,160 --> 03:07:11,160
because I'm the bad guy.

5488
03:07:11,160 --> 03:07:13,160
Ah! Even though there's plenty room to

5489
03:07:13,160 --> 03:07:15,160
discuss augmentation in a nuanced way,

5490
03:07:15,160 --> 03:07:17,160
it's instead often used as a stand-in

5491
03:07:17,160 --> 03:07:19,160
for other real-world issues.

5492
03:07:19,160 --> 03:07:21,160
There's newspaper articles about how an augmented

5493
03:07:21,160 --> 03:07:23,160
black woman has had to deal with bigotry,

5494
03:07:23,160 --> 03:07:25,160
not just for her race, but now also

5495
03:07:25,160 --> 03:07:27,160
for being augmented. First racism

5496
03:07:27,160 --> 03:07:29,160
and now robot arms.

5497
03:07:29,160 --> 03:07:31,160
People are coming up with special new slurs

5498
03:07:31,160 --> 03:07:33,160
for augmented people. Mechs, clanks,

5499
03:07:33,160 --> 03:07:35,160
cogs, chrome boy.

5500
03:07:35,160 --> 03:07:37,160
Chrome boy? Chrome boy.

5501
03:07:37,160 --> 03:07:39,160
Chrome boy. Hanses? They put more

5502
03:07:39,160 --> 03:07:41,160
creativity into clever new terms

5503
03:07:41,160 --> 03:07:43,160
for cyber racism than they did

5504
03:07:43,160 --> 03:07:45,160
into actually talking about the issues

5505
03:07:45,160 --> 03:07:47,160
that come into play if human augmentation

5506
03:07:47,160 --> 03:07:49,160
becomes available. It feels a bit like

5507
03:07:49,160 --> 03:07:51,160
they're adding augmentation on top of these

5508
03:07:51,160 --> 03:07:53,160
other things, like racism, abortion,

5509
03:07:53,160 --> 03:07:55,160
drug abuse, or prostitution

5510
03:07:55,160 --> 03:07:57,160
in order to bring additional depth to their central

5511
03:07:57,160 --> 03:07:59,160
theme. It's a little gross at times.

5512
03:07:59,160 --> 03:08:01,160
You don't need an abortion poster

5513
03:08:01,160 --> 03:08:03,160
to make transhumanism look like a topical

5514
03:08:03,160 --> 03:08:05,160
idea. I just think this is unnecessary

5515
03:08:05,160 --> 03:08:07,160
and crass. The Hengsha side quest

5516
03:08:07,160 --> 03:08:09,160
deserves special attention here. The idea

5517
03:08:09,160 --> 03:08:11,160
of forcing sex workers to need an anti-rejection

5518
03:08:11,160 --> 03:08:13,160
drug is a little too close

5519
03:08:13,160 --> 03:08:15,160
to one-to-one substitution for a real

5520
03:08:15,160 --> 03:08:17,160
problem. Sex workers being addicted,

5521
03:08:17,160 --> 03:08:19,160
often forcefully, to drugs as

5522
03:08:19,160 --> 03:08:21,160
a means of control. Like, making it so

5523
03:08:21,160 --> 03:08:23,160
the drug they need is because of an augmentation

5524
03:08:23,160 --> 03:08:25,160
is just crowbarring your silly sci-fi

5525
03:08:25,160 --> 03:08:27,160
concept into an already existing

5526
03:08:27,160 --> 03:08:29,160
real problem. The game isn't using

5527
03:08:29,160 --> 03:08:31,160
this sequence as a way of saying anything about

5528
03:08:31,160 --> 03:08:33,160
the sex industry beyond that it's bad

5529
03:08:33,160 --> 03:08:35,160
that trafficking happens, which, okay,

5530
03:08:35,160 --> 03:08:37,160
glad we're on the same page, and it's not saying anything

5531
03:08:37,160 --> 03:08:39,160
about augmentation except that I guess

5532
03:08:39,160 --> 03:08:41,160
it might add to an already existing

5533
03:08:41,160 --> 03:08:43,160
form of exploitation. It's here

5534
03:08:43,160 --> 03:08:45,160
so you can punch three guys and save a lady

5535
03:08:45,160 --> 03:08:47,160
and she can go, wow, you saved me

5536
03:08:47,160 --> 03:08:49,160
and then she evaporates.

5537
03:08:49,160 --> 03:08:51,160
We fade to black and she ceases to exist.

5538
03:08:51,160 --> 03:08:53,160
Did we just solve sex

5539
03:08:53,160 --> 03:08:55,160
trafficking? And we have to talk a little about

5540
03:08:55,160 --> 03:08:57,160
how prostitution is used in the game.

5541
03:08:57,160 --> 03:08:59,160
Sex workers are a large presence in both

5542
03:08:59,160 --> 03:09:01,160
main hubs and it feels like this was done to

5543
03:09:01,160 --> 03:09:03,160
make a point about how bad things are getting.

5544
03:09:03,160 --> 03:09:05,160
Like, the writers wanted to write a dystopian

5545
03:09:05,160 --> 03:09:07,160
future and their minds instantly went to

5546
03:09:07,160 --> 03:09:09,160
there's a lot of prostitutes everywhere.

5547
03:09:09,160 --> 03:09:11,160
I'm curious if the writers spoke to

5548
03:09:11,160 --> 03:09:13,160
any sex workers and asked them how

5549
03:09:13,160 --> 03:09:15,160
they felt about being used as a signifier

5550
03:09:15,160 --> 03:09:17,160
for societal collapse.

5551
03:09:17,160 --> 03:09:19,160
This problem is bigger than Human Revolution,

5552
03:09:19,160 --> 03:09:21,160
obviously. Prostitutes, and more specifically

5553
03:09:21,160 --> 03:09:23,160
Asian robo-prostitutes, have been a

5554
03:09:23,160 --> 03:09:25,160
fixture of cyberpunk fiction since

5555
03:09:25,160 --> 03:09:27,160
its inception. These stories have always

5556
03:09:27,160 --> 03:09:29,160
leaned on combining the mystery of future

5557
03:09:29,160 --> 03:09:31,160
technology with the exoticism

5558
03:09:31,160 --> 03:09:33,160
of foreign cultures. We certainly shouldn't

5559
03:09:33,160 --> 03:09:35,160
interrogate the Orientalism inherent

5560
03:09:35,160 --> 03:09:36,160
in that trope.

5561
03:09:36,160 --> 03:09:38,160
Alec, drop me off at the cyber brothel.

5562
03:09:38,160 --> 03:09:40,160
Please. I need to look for key cards.

5563
03:09:40,160 --> 03:09:42,160
The game is ham-fisted in how it

5564
03:09:42,160 --> 03:09:44,160
talks about augmentations because when

5565
03:09:44,160 --> 03:09:46,160
it comes down to it, the central question

5566
03:09:46,160 --> 03:09:48,160
it decided to focus on, whether we should

5567
03:09:48,160 --> 03:09:50,160
legislate human augmentation or not, just

5568
03:09:50,160 --> 03:09:52,160
isn't as complicated as it might have seemed

5569
03:09:52,160 --> 03:09:54,160
when they came up with it. Putting aside the

5570
03:09:54,160 --> 03:09:56,160
questions about what it means to be human,

5571
03:09:56,160 --> 03:09:58,160
the more tangible questions on the topic

5572
03:09:58,160 --> 03:10:00,160
are a bit simpler. For example, if

5573
03:10:00,160 --> 03:10:02,160
companies started developing prosthetic

5574
03:10:02,160 --> 03:10:04,160
arms that can shoot explosives and kill

5575
03:10:04,160 --> 03:10:06,160
everyone in an immediate radius, should

5576
03:10:06,160 --> 03:10:08,160
there be regulations on who can have those?

5577
03:10:08,160 --> 03:10:10,160
Uh...

5578
03:10:10,160 --> 03:10:12,160
Yeah! They should

5579
03:10:12,160 --> 03:10:14,160
probably ban the war crime blaster

5580
03:10:14,160 --> 03:10:16,160
before the NRA decided

5581
03:10:16,160 --> 03:10:18,160
every toddler's god-given right to

5582
03:10:18,160 --> 03:10:20,160
bear robot arms. In this footage,

5583
03:10:20,160 --> 03:10:22,160
I was trying to turn invisible and accidentally

5584
03:10:22,160 --> 03:10:24,160
hit the button right next to it and fat-fingered

5585
03:10:24,160 --> 03:10:26,160
my way into 12 consecutive

5586
03:10:26,160 --> 03:10:28,160
life sentences.

5587
03:10:28,160 --> 03:10:30,160
Pause the video and leave a comment

5588
03:10:30,160 --> 03:10:32,160
if you think the government shouldn't regulate

5589
03:10:32,160 --> 03:10:34,160
this. In order to make the questions seem

5590
03:10:34,160 --> 03:10:36,160
more complicated, the game draws zero

5591
03:10:36,160 --> 03:10:38,160
distinction between this and the types

5592
03:10:38,160 --> 03:10:40,160
of theoretical augmentation we can all

5593
03:10:40,160 --> 03:10:42,160
agree are great. Advanced prosthetics

5594
03:10:42,160 --> 03:10:44,160
that recreate actual sensory information

5595
03:10:44,160 --> 03:10:46,160
the way a hand would. Enabling people

5596
03:10:46,160 --> 03:10:48,160
who have lost limbs to completely replace

5597
03:10:48,160 --> 03:10:50,160
them. Fully functioning eye replacements.

5598
03:10:50,160 --> 03:10:52,160
Things like that would be magical

5599
03:10:52,160 --> 03:10:54,160
for a lot of people. The anti-augmentation

5600
03:10:54,160 --> 03:10:56,160
groups are written to hate those too.

5601
03:10:56,160 --> 03:10:58,160
Too much power can make you do terrible

5602
03:10:58,160 --> 03:11:00,160
things, Mr. Jensen. Zeke Sanders

5603
03:11:00,160 --> 03:11:02,160
ripped out his prosthetic eye because

5604
03:11:02,160 --> 03:11:04,160
he hates augmentations that much.

5605
03:11:04,160 --> 03:11:06,160
They're against all augmentations

5606
03:11:06,160 --> 03:11:08,160
for pseudo-philosophical reasons to do

5607
03:11:08,160 --> 03:11:10,160
with changing the core of humanity.

5608
03:11:10,160 --> 03:11:12,160
We can save people from illnesses,

5609
03:11:12,160 --> 03:11:14,160
amputation, disfigurement, disability,

5610
03:11:14,160 --> 03:11:16,160
but at what cost? Ooh!

5611
03:11:16,160 --> 03:11:18,160
Augmentations help a lot of people, Doc.

5612
03:11:18,160 --> 03:11:20,160
Handicapped, war vets. Yes, but at

5613
03:11:20,160 --> 03:11:22,160
what cost? I bet you thought I was joking,

5614
03:11:22,160 --> 03:11:24,160
didn't you? No, they actually say that.

5615
03:11:24,160 --> 03:11:26,160
Now, statistically, almost half the people

5616
03:11:26,160 --> 03:11:28,160
watching this are wearing glasses or

5617
03:11:28,160 --> 03:11:30,160
lenses like me. Many of you are watching this

5618
03:11:30,160 --> 03:11:32,160
on the phone they also use whenever they need

5619
03:11:32,160 --> 03:11:34,160
to check for information on almost any topic.

5620
03:11:34,160 --> 03:11:36,160
We've already been supplementing our bodies

5621
03:11:36,160 --> 03:11:38,160
and minds with technology for so long

5622
03:11:38,160 --> 03:11:40,160
we've almost forgotten we're doing it.

5623
03:11:40,160 --> 03:11:42,160
By surpassing our human limits,

5624
03:11:42,160 --> 03:11:44,160
we're destroying our humanity, defeating

5625
03:11:44,160 --> 03:11:46,160
the purpose of life. Oh, my God, you're totally

5626
03:11:46,160 --> 03:11:48,160
right. We need to rid the world of people

5627
03:11:48,160 --> 03:11:50,160
who supplement their bodies with those glasses?

5628
03:11:50,160 --> 03:11:52,160
So your options

5629
03:11:52,160 --> 03:11:54,160
in human revolution are between these

5630
03:11:54,160 --> 03:11:56,160
jokers who are anti-medicine

5631
03:11:56,160 --> 03:11:58,160
because ooh, what if life-saving surgery

5632
03:11:58,160 --> 03:12:00,160
takes away some of your soul? Several of

5633
03:12:00,160 --> 03:12:02,160
which turn out to be the fucking Illuminati

5634
03:12:02,160 --> 03:12:04,160
and we can't let the government

5635
03:12:04,160 --> 03:12:06,160
shut us down, Adam. Break into a police station

5636
03:12:06,160 --> 03:12:08,160
for me. Also, don't forget we installed

5637
03:12:08,160 --> 03:12:10,160
the secret explosion nightmare cannon in your body.

5638
03:12:10,160 --> 03:12:12,160
Check this shit out. Yee-haw!

5639
03:12:14,160 --> 03:12:16,160
The pro-regulation groups have to be

5640
03:12:16,160 --> 03:12:18,160
written to be extremely stupid

5641
03:12:18,160 --> 03:12:20,160
and working for the bad guys because otherwise

5642
03:12:20,160 --> 03:12:22,160
there's no contest. The issue is made

5643
03:12:22,160 --> 03:12:24,160
all or nothing. Corporations manufacturing

5644
03:12:24,160 --> 03:12:26,160
concealed carry buster swords

5645
03:12:26,160 --> 03:12:28,160
versus big government trying to ban

5646
03:12:28,160 --> 03:12:30,160
what, the concept of prosthesis?

5647
03:12:30,160 --> 03:12:32,160
Because that's the only way

5648
03:12:32,160 --> 03:12:34,160
to turn the central focus of the game

5649
03:12:34,160 --> 03:12:36,160
into something resembling a debate.

5650
03:12:36,160 --> 03:12:38,160
Human revolution feels like its heart is

5651
03:12:38,160 --> 03:12:40,160
in the right place, but it's afraid to say

5652
03:12:40,160 --> 03:12:42,160
too much, so instead you get this

5653
03:12:42,160 --> 03:12:44,160
really weak stuff like, uh, hey,

5654
03:12:44,160 --> 03:12:46,160
maybe the military-industrial complex

5655
03:12:46,160 --> 03:12:48,160
is bad.

5656
03:12:48,160 --> 03:12:50,160
You're right. The teacher

5657
03:12:50,160 --> 03:12:52,160
would just love having one of those things.

5658
03:12:52,160 --> 03:12:54,160
Yeah, if you think about it, making weapons

5659
03:12:54,160 --> 03:12:56,160
isn't as good for the world as making medicine.

5660
03:12:56,160 --> 03:12:58,160
Wow! Later when

5661
03:12:58,160 --> 03:13:00,160
riots start happening in Detroit,

5662
03:13:00,160 --> 03:13:02,160
the riots are about augmentation, of course,

5663
03:13:02,160 --> 03:13:04,160
the police have a police version of the robot

5664
03:13:04,160 --> 03:13:06,160
you were fighting before. That's kinda

5665
03:13:06,160 --> 03:13:08,160
cool. There's a point being made here by

5666
03:13:08,160 --> 03:13:10,160
the reuse of an enemy from other parts of the game.

5667
03:13:10,160 --> 03:13:12,160
You're literally seeing an enemy,

5668
03:13:12,160 --> 03:13:14,160
but on the side of the cops. I mean,

5669
03:13:14,160 --> 03:13:16,160
they got this idea from the original Deus Ex

5670
03:13:16,160 --> 03:13:18,160
when you started seeing rebranded versions of mechs

5671
03:13:18,160 --> 03:13:20,160
you'd seen before, but still. The game is saying,

5672
03:13:20,160 --> 03:13:22,160
hey, maybe it's bad the police

5673
03:13:22,160 --> 03:13:24,160
have tanks? They're arresting

5674
03:13:24,160 --> 03:13:26,160
tons of people in the street too, but this is

5675
03:13:26,160 --> 03:13:28,160
set dressing for the fact a riot is happening

5676
03:13:28,160 --> 03:13:30,160
because people don't like augmentation.

5677
03:13:30,160 --> 03:13:32,160
The commentary isn't, boy, the police really

5678
03:13:32,160 --> 03:13:34,160
are making a bad situation worse by taking

5679
03:13:34,160 --> 03:13:36,160
to the streets with automatic shotguns

5680
03:13:36,160 --> 03:13:38,160
and fucking tachycomas. The commentary is,

5681
03:13:38,160 --> 03:13:40,160
wow, things are really heating up about this augmentation

5682
03:13:40,160 --> 03:13:42,160
thing, huh? The cops really have their hands

5683
03:13:42,160 --> 03:13:44,160
full with all these crazy rioters. The game

5684
03:13:44,160 --> 03:13:46,160
respects the cops so much you get

5685
03:13:46,160 --> 03:13:48,160
hired to help them out during the same

5686
03:13:48,160 --> 03:13:50,160
level where they're arresting everyone using a

5687
03:13:50,160 --> 03:13:52,160
rocket mech. You can see what I mean, right?

5688
03:13:52,160 --> 03:13:54,160
This is okay as far as writing for a video

5689
03:13:54,160 --> 03:13:56,160
game goes, but terrible as far

5690
03:13:56,160 --> 03:13:58,160
as writing a story goes. It really

5691
03:13:58,160 --> 03:14:00,160
doesn't help that it feels like a few key steps

5692
03:14:00,160 --> 03:14:02,160
of the story got cut out due to time limitations.

5693
03:14:02,160 --> 03:14:04,160
In the second to last level, it's established

5694
03:14:04,160 --> 03:14:06,160
that all the major characters from the plot

5695
03:14:06,160 --> 03:14:08,160
can't be contacted because they're currently en route

5696
03:14:08,160 --> 03:14:10,160
to a sea base in the middle of the Arctic Ocean.

5697
03:14:10,160 --> 03:14:12,160
This travel time is important. Jensen

5698
03:14:12,160 --> 03:14:14,160
then encounters Zhao Yun-Ru, the lady

5699
03:14:14,160 --> 03:14:16,160
who tricked him earlier, who introduces the boss fight

5700
03:14:16,160 --> 03:14:18,160
with the biochip reveal. Then it turns out Jensen

5701
03:14:18,160 --> 03:14:20,160
needs to get to the Arctic Ocean base

5702
03:14:20,160 --> 03:14:22,160
everyone else went to to stop the conspiracy

5703
03:14:22,160 --> 03:14:24,160
happening there now, at which point it

5704
03:14:24,160 --> 03:14:26,160
conveniently turns out there's a special

5705
03:14:26,160 --> 03:14:28,160
person-sized rocket here which can launch

5706
03:14:28,160 --> 03:14:30,160
him to the other side of the world faster

5707
03:14:30,160 --> 03:14:32,160
than anyone's ever traveled anywhere on

5708
03:14:32,160 --> 03:14:34,160
Earth before, so he goes there

5709
03:14:34,160 --> 03:14:36,160
and Zhao Yun-Ru's there already.

5710
03:14:36,160 --> 03:14:38,160
She got here before you and she's the

5711
03:14:38,160 --> 03:14:40,160
final boss. Uh, hang on

5712
03:14:40,160 --> 03:14:42,160
a second. How did you get here? Was there

5713
03:14:42,160 --> 03:14:44,160
a second rocket stashed away somewhere?

5714
03:14:44,160 --> 03:14:46,160
Can you give me the cliff notes on what is

5715
03:14:46,160 --> 03:14:48,160
happening here? No wonder the last level

5716
03:14:48,160 --> 03:14:50,160
takes place in a giant hole.

5717
03:14:50,160 --> 03:14:52,160
Presumably in an earlier draft, there was

5718
03:14:52,160 --> 03:14:54,160
a level or two between these, creating

5719
03:14:54,160 --> 03:14:56,160
a time gap where it was plausible for Zhao Yun-Ru

5720
03:14:56,160 --> 03:14:58,160
to get to the middle of the Arctic Ocean.

5721
03:14:58,160 --> 03:15:00,160
When you land in the ocean in the cutscene,

5722
03:15:00,160 --> 03:15:02,160
you just spawn on a landing pad

5723
03:15:02,160 --> 03:15:04,160
next to all these helicopters where I assume

5724
03:15:04,160 --> 03:15:06,160
you were going to get dropped off for a

5725
03:15:06,160 --> 03:15:08,160
sensible reason in an earlier draft of the

5726
03:15:08,160 --> 03:15:10,160
story, or maybe they just didn't

5727
03:15:10,160 --> 03:15:12,160
care to explain this. I mean, Jensen

5728
03:15:12,160 --> 03:15:14,160
doesn't even look for her before he leaves.

5729
03:15:14,160 --> 03:15:16,160
She fucks up Jensen's augmentations,

5730
03:15:16,160 --> 03:15:18,160
walks off screen, and he forgets

5731
03:15:18,160 --> 03:15:20,160
she exists. Men never

5732
03:15:20,160 --> 03:15:22,160
fail to forget where women are in

5733
03:15:22,160 --> 03:15:24,160
physical space. Instead of building to

5734
03:15:24,160 --> 03:15:26,160
some larger question, it builds towards a

5735
03:15:26,160 --> 03:15:28,160
comical over-the-top video game zombie

5736
03:15:28,160 --> 03:15:30,160
movie climax. The big reveal

5737
03:15:30,160 --> 03:15:32,160
of the plot is that the Illuminati are figuring

5738
03:15:32,160 --> 03:15:34,160
out a way to control people using their

5739
03:15:34,160 --> 03:15:36,160
augmentations. Then one of them goes

5740
03:15:36,160 --> 03:15:38,160
rogue and presses a button that makes everyone

5741
03:15:38,160 --> 03:15:40,160
with an augmentation go insane. He does this

5742
03:15:40,160 --> 03:15:42,160
to make a point about augmentations being

5743
03:15:42,160 --> 03:15:44,160
bad. Adam Jensen, who didn't get

5744
03:15:44,160 --> 03:15:46,160
the replacement chip, or did but got an injection

5745
03:15:46,160 --> 03:15:48,160
of nanomachines, so he's fine.

5746
03:15:48,160 --> 03:15:50,160
That's the explanation they give. Saves the day

5747
03:15:50,160 --> 03:15:52,160
by flying to ground zero and turning it off.

5748
03:15:52,160 --> 03:15:54,160
This is a waste of the potentially realistic

5749
03:15:54,160 --> 03:15:56,160
and interesting ways you could have taken

5750
03:15:56,160 --> 03:15:58,160
this story. Instead of seriously exploring

5751
03:15:58,160 --> 03:16:00,160
the problems with centralization or

5752
03:16:00,160 --> 03:16:02,160
authorities like governments having control over

5753
03:16:02,160 --> 03:16:04,160
your life, it settles for the much less deep

5754
03:16:04,160 --> 03:16:06,160
question, would it be bad if the

5755
03:16:06,160 --> 03:16:08,160
Illuminati hacked your grandmother's

5756
03:16:08,160 --> 03:16:10,160
hip replacement and made her into a killing

5757
03:16:10,160 --> 03:16:12,160
machine? And the answer to that question,

5758
03:16:12,160 --> 03:16:14,160
shockingly enough, is, yeah, that would

5759
03:16:14,160 --> 03:16:16,160
be quite bad, but that's not science

5760
03:16:16,160 --> 03:16:18,160
fiction or cyberpunk or transhumanism

5761
03:16:18,160 --> 03:16:20,160
or discussing the implications of

5762
03:16:20,160 --> 03:16:22,160
future technology. That's just stupid.

5763
03:16:22,160 --> 03:16:24,160
You haven't told a story about

5764
03:16:24,160 --> 03:16:26,160
power and control. You wrote a cartoon

5765
03:16:26,160 --> 03:16:28,160
about how bad it would be if there was a big

5766
03:16:28,160 --> 03:16:30,160
button that killed everyone. You're not presenting

5767
03:16:30,160 --> 03:16:32,160
a nuanced issue here. You can

5768
03:16:32,160 --> 03:16:34,160
most easily identify the core problems

5769
03:16:34,160 --> 03:16:36,160
with the storytelling and how the game reuses

5770
03:16:36,160 --> 03:16:38,160
ideas that were in the original, but in the

5771
03:16:38,160 --> 03:16:40,160
complete opposite way. Okay, so

5772
03:16:40,160 --> 03:16:42,160
in Deus Ex, one of the big things about the Illuminati

5773
03:16:42,160 --> 03:16:44,160
and their offshoot, MJ-12,

5774
03:16:44,160 --> 03:16:46,160
is they're super pretentious. No one

5775
03:16:46,160 --> 03:16:48,160
names their AI algorithms Morpheus

5776
03:16:48,160 --> 03:16:50,160
or Daedalus unless they like the smell

5777
03:16:50,160 --> 03:16:52,160
of their own farts. Like, MJ-12's

5778
03:16:52,160 --> 03:16:54,160
organizational structure and clearance levels

5779
03:16:54,160 --> 03:16:56,160
are types of angel arranged in order

5780
03:16:56,160 --> 03:16:58,160
of closeness to the throne of God,

5781
03:16:58,160 --> 03:17:00,160
with the top one being literally God clearance

5782
03:17:00,160 --> 03:17:02,160
and the one below it being Seraphic,

5783
03:17:02,160 --> 03:17:04,160
like as in Seraphim. The founder of

5784
03:17:04,160 --> 03:17:06,160
MJ-12 is writing Bible fanfiction

5785
03:17:06,160 --> 03:17:08,160
and casting himself as

5786
03:17:08,160 --> 03:17:10,160
God. This isn't just a piece of

5787
03:17:10,160 --> 03:17:12,160
lore or meant to sound cool.

5788
03:17:12,160 --> 03:17:14,160
This is a joke. Bob Page,

5789
03:17:14,160 --> 03:17:16,160
the guy who started MJ-12, doesn't really

5790
03:17:16,160 --> 03:17:18,160
understand the teachings of the Illuminati

5791
03:17:18,160 --> 03:17:20,160
and thinks he's a genius, so to sound

5792
03:17:20,160 --> 03:17:22,160
clever, he named the structure of his

5793
03:17:22,160 --> 03:17:24,160
organization around stuff he thought sounded

5794
03:17:24,160 --> 03:17:26,160
deep. Seraphic? Wow,

5795
03:17:26,160 --> 03:17:28,160
I'm so smart. I'm a philosopher.

5796
03:17:28,160 --> 03:17:30,160
I'm fucking play two.

5797
03:17:30,160 --> 03:17:32,160
Page named the special AI he wanted

5798
03:17:32,160 --> 03:17:34,160
to use to take over the world Icarus.

5799
03:17:34,160 --> 03:17:36,160
This is a joke. He's trying

5800
03:17:36,160 --> 03:17:38,160
to sound cool, and it's really silly.

5801
03:17:38,160 --> 03:17:40,160
Like New Vegas with its Caesar cosplayer,

5802
03:17:40,160 --> 03:17:42,160
Deus Ex is making fun of how stupid it is

5803
03:17:42,160 --> 03:17:44,160
to try to sound clever by making surface

5804
03:17:44,160 --> 03:17:46,160
references to stuff people think is deep.

5805
03:17:46,160 --> 03:17:48,160
Cue Human Revolution, which bases

5806
03:17:48,160 --> 03:17:50,160
a shit ton of its imagery around the myth

5807
03:17:50,160 --> 03:17:52,160
of Icarus because it sounds deep.

I never asked for this.

5813
03:18:02,160 --> 03:18:04,160
Yay! Augmentation

5814
03:18:04,160 --> 03:18:06,160
is like Icarus' wax wings,

5815
03:18:06,160 --> 03:18:08,160
and the sun represents, uh,

5816
03:18:08,160 --> 03:18:10,160
augmentation turning out to be bad.

5817
03:18:10,160 --> 03:18:12,160
Look, I don't mean any offense to people

5818
03:18:12,160 --> 03:18:14,160
who thought this was clever when this trailer came out.

5819

Demographically speaking, you were 15.

5820
03:18:16,160 --> 03:18:18,160
I'm merely giving you the opportunity

5821
03:18:18,160 --> 03:18:20,160
to consider that this might just look smart

5822
03:18:20,160 --> 03:18:22,160
while not actually saying anything

5823
03:18:22,160 --> 03:18:24,160
remotely relevant or useful

5824
03:18:24,160 --> 03:18:26,160
about the world we live in, and this shit

5825
03:18:26,160 --> 03:18:28,160
is omnipresent throughout the game.

5826
03:18:28,160 --> 03:18:30,160
The first Icarus thing you see

5827
03:18:30,160 --> 03:18:32,160
is the very first thing you see

5828
03:18:32,160 --> 03:18:34,160
in the game. The slow fall augmentation

5829
03:18:34,160 --> 03:18:36,160
is called the Icarus landing system.

5830
03:18:36,160 --> 03:18:38,160
There's a book you can read in the game

5831
03:18:38,160 --> 03:18:40,160
called Building Wings.

5832
03:18:40,160 --> 03:18:42,160
The game's title theme on the soundtrack

5833
03:18:42,160 --> 03:18:44,160
is called Icarus, of course. The tie-in novel

5834
03:18:44,160 --> 03:18:46,160
for the game was named Deus Ex Icarus Effect,

5835
03:18:46,160 --> 03:18:48,160
and then the tie-in novel

5836
03:18:48,160 --> 03:18:50,160
had a tie-in game for phones

5837
03:18:50,160 --> 03:18:52,160
and later the PC called Deus Ex

5838
03:18:52,160 --> 03:18:54,160
The Fall because, you know, Icarus

5839
03:18:54,160 --> 03:18:56,160
falling into the sea, which happens

5840
03:18:56,160 --> 03:18:58,160
to the character in the game too. That sounds

5841
03:18:58,160 --> 03:19:00,160
familiar. Oh, wait, because it also happens

5842
03:19:00,160 --> 03:19:02,160
to Adam both in the game and then

5843
03:19:02,160 --> 03:19:04,160
afterwards in the ending. He falls into the sea again

5844
03:19:04,160 --> 03:19:06,160
then. In this world, everyone is Icarus

5845
03:19:06,160 --> 03:19:08,160
drowning in the sea

5846
03:19:08,160 --> 03:19:10,160
of this symbolism. The Fall was

5847
03:19:10,160 --> 03:19:12,160
gonna have a slightly subtler title to begin with.

5848
03:19:12,160 --> 03:19:14,160
According to unused images in the game's files,

5849
03:19:14,160 --> 03:19:16,160
they were gonna call it Icarus Rising

5850
03:19:16,160 --> 03:19:18,160
and, like, I hope I'm not the first person to point

5851
03:19:18,160 --> 03:19:20,160
this out for you, but Sarif Industries' logo

5852
03:19:20,160 --> 03:19:22,160
is just a fucking wing and Tai Yong Medical,

5853
03:19:22,160 --> 03:19:24,160
their antagonist, their levels are all sun

5854
03:19:24,160 --> 03:19:26,160
themed. Look, the sun is coming from both

5855
03:19:26,160 --> 03:19:28,160
sides of the room at once because it's like they're

5856
03:19:28,160 --> 03:19:30,160
bathed in the sun. You know, Icarus

5857
03:19:30,160 --> 03:19:32,160
is natural enemy or something.

5858
03:19:32,160 --> 03:19:34,160
Tai Yong is named that because that's the Chinese

5859
03:19:34,160 --> 03:19:36,160
phrase for the sun. They wanted

5860
03:19:36,160 --> 03:19:38,160
to continue their sun Icarus metaphor

5861
03:19:38,160 --> 03:19:40,160
so they googled the sun in

5862
03:19:40,160 --> 03:19:42,160
Chinese. Sarif is a deliberate

5863
03:19:42,160 --> 03:19:44,160
pun on seraphim. Deus Ex

5864
03:19:44,160 --> 03:19:46,160
literally made a joke about people who think

5865
03:19:46,160 --> 03:19:48,160
referencing the seraphim is clever.

5866
03:19:48,160 --> 03:19:50,160
This is the shit Bob Page would come up

5867
03:19:50,160 --> 03:19:52,160
with if you made him write a Deus Ex game.

5868
03:19:52,160 --> 03:19:54,160
Even the man responsible explains his

5869
03:19:54,160 --> 03:19:56,160
motivations using a hackneyed Icarus

5870
03:19:56,160 --> 03:19:58,160
metaphor. I prefer to think of myself as

5871
03:19:58,160 --> 03:20:00,160
deadless, watching helplessly

5872
03:20:00,160 --> 03:20:02,160
as his child crashes into the sea.

5873
03:20:02,160 --> 03:20:04,160
Darrow is currently looking

5874
03:20:04,160 --> 03:20:06,160
into an ocean we just crashed

5875
03:20:06,160 --> 03:20:08,160
into as part of a previous unrelated

5876
03:20:08,160 --> 03:20:10,160
flying too close to the sun crashing

5877
03:20:10,160 --> 03:20:12,160
into the ocean metaphor. Watching

5878
03:20:12,160 --> 03:20:14,160
helplessly as his child crashes

5879
03:20:14,160 --> 03:20:16,160
into the sea. Read a second

5880
03:20:16,160 --> 03:20:18,160
Greek myth. I'm begging you.

5881
03:20:18,160 --> 03:20:20,160
Why do we build the wall? I think the moment

5882
03:20:20,160 --> 03:20:22,160
I knew the game was gonna be really misguided

5883
03:20:22,160 --> 03:20:24,160
was when one of the trailers flashed through a bunch

5884
03:20:24,160 --> 03:20:26,160
of generic We Are Smart imagery

5885
03:20:26,160 --> 03:20:28,160
and renaissance stuff and one of the things

5886
03:20:28,160 --> 03:20:30,160
that flashes up is a sign saying we don't let

5887
03:20:30,160 --> 03:20:32,160
augmented people in here. Like,

5888
03:20:32,160 --> 03:20:34,160
okay, segregation.

5889
03:20:34,160 --> 03:20:36,160
You're making a game about segregation,

5890
03:20:36,160 --> 03:20:38,160
a real thing that is horrible,

5891
03:20:38,160 --> 03:20:40,160
and you're also making a game about the cyber

5892
03:20:40,160 --> 03:20:42,160
renaissance and how cool it is to reference

5893
03:20:42,160 --> 03:20:44,160
the myth of Icarus. We flew too

5894
03:20:44,160 --> 03:20:46,160
close to the big yong, and you

5895
03:20:46,160 --> 03:20:48,160
know what that means?

5896
03:20:48,160 --> 03:20:50,160
Apartheid. It sucks because,

5897
03:20:50,160 --> 03:20:52,160
like, how many other games take their stories

5898
03:20:52,160 --> 03:20:54,160
seriously enough that a main character says something

5899
03:20:54,160 --> 03:20:56,160
like, hey, it's weird we spend most of our time

5900
03:20:56,160 --> 03:20:58,160
inventing weapons for the government, right?

5901
03:20:58,160 --> 03:21:00,160
I want to love any game that

5902
03:21:00,160 --> 03:21:02,160
takes that step, but when that's the

5903
03:21:02,160 --> 03:21:04,160
only step it takes and the other clever

5904
03:21:04,160 --> 03:21:06,160
thing he says was only in the trailer,

5905
03:21:06,160 --> 03:21:08,160
and the rest of the story is preoccupied with stuff

5906
03:21:08,160 --> 03:21:10,160
the original game made fun of for being

5907
03:21:10,160 --> 03:21:12,160
pretentious as shit, I've got to say

5908
03:21:12,160 --> 03:21:14,160
I don't think it's out of place to expect

5909
03:21:14,160 --> 03:21:16,160
a little more. Please, sir, can I have

5910
03:21:16,160 --> 03:21:18,160
some more delicious sauce?

5911
03:21:18,160 --> 03:21:20,160
Those elements mixed together is definitely

5912
03:21:20,160 --> 03:21:22,160
like a sauce. The story being this

5913
03:21:22,160 --> 03:21:24,160
simplistic makes the okay to mediocre

5914
03:21:24,160 --> 03:21:26,160
gameplay feel so much worse.

5915
03:21:26,160 --> 03:21:28,160
Even when the original was being annoying

5916
03:21:28,160 --> 03:21:30,160
or awkward to play, you were a few minutes

5917
03:21:30,160 --> 03:21:32,160
away from a truly fascinating conversation

5918
03:21:32,160 --> 03:21:34,160
you couldn't get anywhere else.

5919
03:21:34,160 --> 03:21:36,160
If you didn't like an aspect of the original's

5920
03:21:36,160 --> 03:21:38,160
story, a lot more stuff was going on.

5921
03:21:38,160 --> 03:21:40,160
Like the hacking minigame,

5922
03:21:40,160 --> 03:21:42,160
if you think the augmentation stuff in

5923
03:21:42,160 --> 03:21:44,160
Human Revolution is dumb, you can't escape it.

5924
03:21:44,160 --> 03:21:46,160
It's everywhere. At every moment,

5925
03:21:46,160 --> 03:21:48,160
right up until the plot manages to drag

5926
03:21:48,160 --> 03:21:50,160
itself over the finish line.

5927
03:21:50,160 --> 03:21:52,160
Human Revolution's

5928
03:21:52,160 --> 03:21:54,160
endings are what would happen

5929
03:21:54,160 --> 03:21:56,160
if a fart could die.

5930
03:21:56,160 --> 03:21:58,160
After defeating the final boss once she plugs

5931
03:21:58,160 --> 03:22:00,160
herself into a supercomputer powered by

5932
03:22:00,160 --> 03:22:02,160
screaming women, if that seems like it came out of

5933
03:22:02,160 --> 03:22:04,160
left field, that's because it did, you get to

5934
03:22:04,160 --> 03:22:06,160
pick how the game ends. Now, the original

5935
03:22:06,160 --> 03:22:08,160
game was criticized for how the endings weren't

5936
03:22:08,160 --> 03:22:10,160
based on your choices throughout the story or

5937
03:22:10,160 --> 03:22:12,160
their wider consequences, but instead on what

5938
03:22:12,160 --> 03:22:14,160
you chose to do in the final level.

5939
03:22:14,160 --> 03:22:16,160
Each of the endings had its own unique set of objectives,

5940
03:22:16,160 --> 03:22:18,160
but still, it means only the last

5941
03:22:18,160 --> 03:22:20,160
20 minutes of the game affects how the

5942
03:22:20,160 --> 03:22:22,160
story ends. The creators of Human

5943
03:22:22,160 --> 03:22:24,160
Revolution decided to give players something

5944
03:22:24,160 --> 03:22:26,160
to really complain about. Now you

5945
03:22:26,160 --> 03:22:28,160
pick an ending from one of three buttons at

5946
03:22:28,160 --> 03:22:30,160
a computer, which decides who gets blamed

5947
03:22:30,160 --> 03:22:32,160
for augmented people turning into zombies

5948
03:22:32,160 --> 03:22:34,160
for 40 minutes. There's also a fourth

5949
03:22:34,160 --> 03:22:36,160
button which destroys the entire ocean

5950
03:22:36,160 --> 03:22:38,160
facility, meaning no one has any idea

5951
03:22:38,160 --> 03:22:40,160
what really happened and everyone on the

5952
03:22:40,160 --> 03:22:42,160
facility, including Adam, dies.

5953
03:22:42,160 --> 03:22:44,160
You don't get to see what actually happens when you

5954
03:22:44,160 --> 03:22:46,160
press any button, though. The ending cinematics

5955
03:22:46,160 --> 03:22:48,160
are just shots of actual protests and shit.

5956
03:22:48,160 --> 03:22:50,160
Tinted yellow, obviously. Can't let

5957
03:22:50,160 --> 03:22:52,160
this actual news footage of real police

5958
03:22:52,160 --> 03:22:54,160
brutality ruin your visual aesthetic,

5959
03:22:54,160 --> 03:22:56,160
bro. Big bro.

5960
03:22:56,160 --> 03:22:58,160
This oil spill footage wasn't deep enough

5961
03:22:58,160 --> 03:23:00,160
so we made it cyber.

5962
03:23:00,160 --> 03:23:02,160
Think about it. Adam shoots

5963
03:23:02,160 --> 03:23:04,160
the shit about life, the universe, and

5964
03:23:04,160 --> 03:23:06,160
everything, and the credits roll. Then you

5965
03:23:06,160 --> 03:23:08,160
get a post-credits scene where Adam's ex-girlfriend

5966
03:23:08,160 --> 03:23:10,160
talks to Bob Page and the game cuts

5967
03:23:10,160 --> 03:23:12,160
to a title screen and the original Deus Ex

5968
03:23:12,160 --> 03:23:14,160
theme starts playing, as if to say,

5969
03:23:14,160 --> 03:23:16,160
do you get it?

5970
03:23:18,160 --> 03:23:20,160
Yes, I did get it. That was

5971
03:23:20,160 --> 03:23:22,160
what you were referencing. Thank you. These

5972
03:23:22,160 --> 03:23:24,160
endings have been criticized to hell and back already,

5973
03:23:24,160 --> 03:23:26,160
but what I find fascinating about that is how their

5974
03:23:26,160 --> 03:23:28,160
extreme badness rescued the

5975
03:23:28,160 --> 03:23:30,160
game from more hard-hitting criticism.

5976
03:23:30,160 --> 03:23:32,160
People complain about the endings and then

5977
03:23:32,160 --> 03:23:34,160
don't have room to talk about the incomprehensible

5978
03:23:34,160 --> 03:23:36,160
final boss who, just to make it clear,

5979
03:23:36,160 --> 03:23:38,160
I still don't know how to beat, the

5980
03:23:38,160 --> 03:23:40,160
you-win cinematic just seems to play on its

5981
03:23:40,160 --> 03:23:42,160
own eventually, or how the last level just

5982
03:23:42,160 --> 03:23:44,160
throws the whole gameplay structure out the window,

5983
03:23:44,160 --> 03:23:46,160
the second half's complete lack of

5984
03:23:46,160 --> 03:23:48,160
almost any side quests, and the fact you haven't

5985
03:23:48,160 --> 03:23:50,160
made a single impactive choice

5986
03:23:50,160 --> 03:23:52,160
in the game except how long you dawdle

5987
03:23:52,160 --> 03:23:54,160
in your office and whether to fall for

5988
03:23:54,160 --> 03:23:56,160
an obvious trap. The endings being

5989
03:23:56,160 --> 03:23:58,160
this memorably bad has almost

5990
03:23:58,160 --> 03:24:00,160
done the game a service. Hey, uh,

5991
03:24:00,160 --> 03:24:02,160
designers, if you're making a game

5992
03:24:02,160 --> 03:24:04,160
and you're worried it's a bit mediocre, have

5993
03:24:04,160 --> 03:24:06,160
the endings be complete shit. Just nosedive

5994
03:24:06,160 --> 03:24:08,160
it at the last possible second.

5995
03:24:08,160 --> 03:24:10,160
People will think your game is decent and just

5996
03:24:10,160 --> 03:24:12,160
let down by the endings and forget

5997
03:24:12,160 --> 03:24:14,160
they spent half of it in a vent looking for

5998
03:24:14,160 --> 03:24:16,160
the next forced hacking minigame.

5999
03:24:16,160 --> 03:24:18,160
All that said, at least Human Revolution

6000
03:24:18,160 --> 03:24:20,160
has endings. Mankind Divided just

6001
03:24:20,160 --> 03:24:22,160
ends by hacking.

6002
03:24:22,160 --> 03:24:24,160
["Human Revolution"]

6003
03:24:24,160 --> 03:24:26,160
["Human Revolution"]

6004
03:24:26,160 --> 03:24:28,160
["Human Revolution"]

6005
03:24:28,160 --> 03:24:29,660
It doesn't go that low.

6006
03:24:29,660 --> 03:24:31,660
Oh, you're kidding me. So that's

6007
03:24:31,660 --> 03:24:33,660
Deus Ex Human Revolution, a really

6008
03:24:33,660 --> 03:24:35,660
decent game with a pretty flawed story

6009
03:24:35,660 --> 03:24:37,660
and vastly simplified mechanics

6010
03:24:37,660 --> 03:24:39,660
and design from its predecessor in the hope

6011
03:24:39,660 --> 03:24:41,660
a streamlined experience would appeal

6012
03:24:41,660 --> 03:24:43,660
to more people than the original, and

6013
03:24:43,660 --> 03:24:45,660
to be sure, it did. It sold

6014
03:24:45,660 --> 03:24:47,660
and reviewed really well, and it

6015
03:24:47,660 --> 03:24:49,660
deserved to. If it didn't come with the baggage

6016
03:24:49,660 --> 03:24:51,660
and expectations of being a Deus Ex

6017
03:24:51,660 --> 03:24:53,660
game, I'd call it an okay but extremely

6018
03:24:53,660 --> 03:24:55,660
promising first game from a new

6019
03:24:55,660 --> 03:24:57,660
studio, and broadly speaking, I

6020
03:24:57,660 --> 03:24:59,660
think Mankind Divided delivered on many of

6021
03:24:59,660 --> 03:25:01,660
those promises five years later. You can

6022
03:25:01,660 --> 03:25:03,660
even pick up and throw plants now!

6023
03:25:03,660 --> 03:25:05,660
Hey, guys, you seeing this?

6024
03:25:05,660 --> 03:25:07,660
Why did no one

6025
03:25:07,660 --> 03:25:09,660
tell me about this?

6026
03:25:09,660 --> 03:25:11,660
Mankind Divided's quality is a story for

6027
03:25:11,660 --> 03:25:13,660
another video, but for now it's worth asking,

6028
03:25:13,660 --> 03:25:15,660
hey, it's been another five

6029
03:25:15,660 --> 03:25:17,660
years. Where's the sequel to Mankind

6030
03:25:17,660 --> 03:25:19,660
Divided? Where's MD2,

6031
03:25:19,660 --> 03:25:21,660
if you will? Well,

6032
03:25:21,660 --> 03:25:23,660
Deus Ex's corporate masters are

6033
03:25:23,660 --> 03:25:25,660
treating it about as well as they always have.

6034
03:25:25,660 --> 03:25:27,660
This version of Deus Ex has been

6035
03:25:27,660 --> 03:25:29,660
effectively abandoned, so we saw

6036
03:25:29,660 --> 03:25:31,660
Eidos Montreal work on the next Tomb Raider

6037
03:25:31,660 --> 03:25:33,660
and help out on the Avengers game and make

6038
03:25:33,660 --> 03:25:35,660
that Guardians of the Galaxy thing.

6039
03:25:35,660 --> 03:25:37,660
Several of the Deus Ex team's core

6040
03:25:37,660 --> 03:25:39,660
membership quit en masse and went off to another

6041
03:25:39,660 --> 03:25:41,660
studio a few years back. This includes

6042
03:25:41,660 --> 03:25:43,660
our old friend Francois Lapikus, whose

6043
03:25:43,660 --> 03:25:45,660
LinkedIn lists him as game director for almost

6044
03:25:45,660 --> 03:25:47,660
four years on a cancelled project

6045
03:25:47,660 --> 03:25:49,660
codenamed MD2.

6046
03:25:49,660 --> 03:25:51,660
I wonder what that might have been.

6047
03:25:51,660 --> 03:25:53,660
Immersive sims are hard to make and really

6048
03:25:53,660 --> 03:25:55,660
expensive if you want to compete with other

6049
03:25:55,660 --> 03:25:57,660
AAA games. Despite selling pretty well,

6050
03:25:57,660 --> 03:25:59,660
Mankind Divided didn't set the world

6051
03:25:59,660 --> 03:26:01,660
on fire the way it needed to to justify

6052
03:26:01,660 --> 03:26:03,660
continued sequels. It's possible

6053
03:26:03,660 --> 03:26:05,660
to make a game tons of people like,

6054
03:26:05,660 --> 03:26:07,660
but not enough to play all the way to the end

6055
03:26:07,660 --> 03:26:09,660
and whose sequel they might not even bother with

6056
03:26:09,660 --> 03:26:11,660
even if they have fond memories of the

6057
03:26:11,660 --> 03:26:13,660
previous one. I only started playing

6058
03:26:13,660 --> 03:26:15,660
Mankind Divided in preparation for this video

6059
03:26:15,660 --> 03:26:17,660
because I lost interest in the series after

6060
03:26:17,660 --> 03:26:19,660
liking Human Revolution okay, but

6061
03:26:19,660 --> 03:26:21,660
not being that into seeing more of the same.

6062
03:26:21,660 --> 03:26:23,660
And many of my friends who

6063
03:26:23,660 --> 03:26:25,660
remember liking Human Revolution way more

6064
03:26:25,660 --> 03:26:27,660
than me still haven't got around to playing it

6065
03:26:27,660 --> 03:26:29,660
either. What's the holdup?

6066
03:26:29,660 --> 03:26:31,660
Perhaps the gamble of making a simpler, more

6067
03:26:31,660 --> 03:26:33,660
generally marketable experience didn't

6068
03:26:33,660 --> 03:26:35,660
pay off quite as well as it seemed.

6069
03:26:35,660 --> 03:26:37,660
Maybe it's possible to make something thousands

6070
03:26:37,660 --> 03:26:39,660
of people like, but don't necessarily

6071
03:26:39,660 --> 03:26:41,660
love, at least not enough to

6072
03:26:41,660 --> 03:26:43,660
come back for more. Human Revolution

6073
03:26:43,660 --> 03:26:45,660
definitely has its diehard fans,

6074
03:26:45,660 --> 03:26:47,660
and that's cool, but a lot of its players

6075
03:26:47,660 --> 03:26:49,660
simply liked it and then stopped halfway

6076
03:26:49,660 --> 03:26:51,660
through to play something else and never came

6077
03:26:51,660 --> 03:26:53,660
back. Sure, making health systems

6078
03:26:53,660 --> 03:26:55,660
more like Call of Duty or adding cover

6079
03:26:55,660 --> 03:26:57,660
mechanics to make it more like Gears of War

6080
03:26:57,660 --> 03:26:59,660
might sound like a positive selling

6081
03:26:59,660 --> 03:27:01,660
point on a slideshow in a meeting,

6082
03:27:01,660 --> 03:27:03,660
but the people who love those games already have

6083
03:27:03,660 --> 03:27:05,660
a game that does them better than Human Revolution

6084
03:27:05,660 --> 03:27:07,660
did, and people who actually liked

6085
03:27:07,660 --> 03:27:09,660
Deus Ex's complexity don't get

6086
03:27:09,660 --> 03:27:11,660
that in Human Revolution. So

6087
03:27:11,660 --> 03:27:13,660
who would come back for more of this?

6088
03:27:13,660 --> 03:27:15,660
That's definitely not the whole story.

6089
03:27:15,660 --> 03:27:17,660
Square Enix and Eidos Montreal's

6090
03:27:17,660 --> 03:27:19,660
management certainly squandered all the good

6091
03:27:19,660 --> 03:27:21,660
will the developers had rightfully earned

6092
03:27:21,660 --> 03:27:23,660
with their pre-order bullshit and

6093
03:27:23,660 --> 03:27:25,660
in-game microtransactions bullshit

6094
03:27:25,660 --> 03:27:27,660
and the free-to-play game glued

6095
03:27:27,660 --> 03:27:29,660
to the side of a game people already

6096
03:27:29,660 --> 03:27:31,660
paid money for, but when it comes down

6097
03:27:31,660 --> 03:27:33,660
to it, as good as Human Revolution

6098
03:27:33,660 --> 03:27:35,660
was, the one thing it wasn't was

6099
03:27:35,660 --> 03:27:37,660
a sequel seller. Who's on the edge of

6100
03:27:37,660 --> 03:27:39,660
their seats to find out what happens next

6101
03:27:39,660 --> 03:27:41,660
to endings like these? Also,

6102
03:27:41,660 --> 03:27:43,660
you know, it's a prequel. We kind

6103
03:27:43,660 --> 03:27:45,660
of know what happens next.

6104
03:27:45,660 --> 03:27:47,660
Deus Ex was once a game people loved

6105
03:27:47,660 --> 03:27:49,660
so much, a company decided it was worth

6106
03:27:49,660 --> 03:27:51,660
making another one many years later.

6107
03:27:51,660 --> 03:27:53,660
Do people love Human Revolution

6108
03:27:53,660 --> 03:27:55,660
the same way, or do they simply

6109
03:27:55,660 --> 03:27:57,660
like it? I think that if

6110
03:27:57,660 --> 03:27:59,660
Human Revolution had come out two years after

6111
03:27:59,660 --> 03:28:01,660
the original Deus Ex on a slightly

6112
03:28:01,660 --> 03:28:03,660
updated version of the original's engine,

6113
03:28:03,660 --> 03:28:05,660
people would instantly see what's lacking about

6114
03:28:05,660 --> 03:28:07,660
it, dismiss it as a mediocre imitator

6115
03:28:07,660 --> 03:28:09,660
that didn't really understand what makes

6116
03:28:09,660 --> 03:28:11,660
the original work. It would have been hated

6117
03:28:11,660 --> 03:28:13,660
for the crime of failing to be

6118
03:28:13,660 --> 03:28:15,660
as good as the best video game ever made.

6119
03:28:15,660 --> 03:28:17,660
I wonder if that's common in gaming

6120
03:28:17,660 --> 03:28:19,660
culture, but it didn't come out two years

6121
03:28:19,660 --> 03:28:21,660
later. It came out a decade later

6122
03:28:21,660 --> 03:28:23,660
in a market that hadn't seen anything like

6123
03:28:23,660 --> 03:28:25,660
it for a long time. It was a relief

6124
03:28:25,660 --> 03:28:27,660
a game even a bit like Deus Ex

6125
03:28:27,660 --> 03:28:29,660
could still get made. It was a breath

6126
03:28:29,660 --> 03:28:31,660
of fresh air to the 2011 game

6127
03:28:31,660 --> 03:28:33,660
industry. It's just that when you compare

6128
03:28:33,660 --> 03:28:35,660
it with the games it's trying to be like,

6129
03:28:35,660 --> 03:28:37,660
it doesn't hold up quite so well. The quality

6130
03:28:37,660 --> 03:28:39,660
of other recent immersive sims,

6131
03:28:39,660 --> 03:28:41,660
including Mankind Divided, demonstrates

6132
03:28:41,660 --> 03:28:43,660
the true classics of the genre are as good

6133
03:28:43,660 --> 03:28:45,660
as they are because they dedicate themselves to doing

6134
03:28:45,660 --> 03:28:47,660
what they do well. The first Deus Ex

6135
03:28:47,660 --> 03:28:49,660
was a niche game, a weird

6136
03:28:49,660 --> 03:28:51,660
complicated experience for a certain

6137
03:28:51,660 --> 03:28:53,660
type of nerd. Us nerds loved

6138
03:28:53,660 --> 03:28:55,660
it, and it sold pretty well, though

6139
03:28:55,660 --> 03:28:57,660
not super amazingly. I'm pretty sure

6140
03:28:57,660 --> 03:28:59,660
Human Revolution outsold it, but many

6141
03:28:59,660 --> 03:29:01,660
developers working today are openly

6142
03:29:01,660 --> 03:29:03,660
inspired by the first Deus Ex.

6143
03:29:03,660 --> 03:29:05,660
I'm genuinely curious how many

6144
03:29:05,660 --> 03:29:07,660
developers are specifically inspired

6145
03:29:07,660 --> 03:29:09,660
by Human Revolution instead.

6146
03:29:09,660 --> 03:29:17,660
So where do we put this guy on my list of every video game ranked in order of objective value?

6147
03:29:17,660 --> 03:29:19,660
It's weird how no one thought to make one of

6148
03:29:19,660 --> 03:29:21,660
these before. With heavy heart, I have no

6149
03:29:21,660 --> 03:29:23,660
choice but to put this game on the very

6150
03:29:23,660 --> 03:29:25,660
bottom of the list. There.

6151
03:29:25,660 --> 03:29:27,660
As of the time of this video,

6152
03:29:27,660 --> 03:29:29,660
Deus Ex Human Revolution is the worst

6153
03:29:29,660 --> 03:29:31,660
game ever made. Oh, I forgot to add

6154
03:29:31,660 --> 03:29:33,660
Fallout 3, the second worst game ever made.

6155
03:29:33,660 --> 03:29:35,660
But hey, DXHR fans, try

6156
03:29:35,660 --> 03:29:37,660
not to think of it that way. Try and think of it

6157
03:29:37,660 --> 03:29:39,660
as the third best game. Maybe it'll

6158
03:29:39,660 --> 03:29:41,660
even work out better than the next Gex.

6159
03:29:41,660 --> 03:29:43,660
Gex! Gex! Gex! Sadly,

6160
03:29:43,660 --> 03:29:45,660
it seems Square Enix are looking for fresh

6161
03:29:45,660 --> 03:29:47,660
victims. In December last year, while I was

6162
03:29:47,660 --> 03:29:49,660
deep in the making of this video and had already

6163
03:29:49,660 --> 03:29:51,660
written a bunch of jokes for the conclusion about what

6164
03:29:51,660 --> 03:29:53,660
lessons Square Enix needs to learn in time for the

6165
03:29:53,660 --> 03:29:55,660
new Gex game, I had a really good joke about

6166
03:29:55,660 --> 03:29:57,660
making sure Gex doesn't ride any elevators.

6167
03:29:57,660 --> 03:29:59,660
Trust me. Squeenix went out and filed

6168
03:29:59,660 --> 03:30:01,660
a new trademark for the Gex IP,

6169
03:30:01,660 --> 03:30:03,660
making the intended joke of this video

6170
03:30:03,660 --> 03:30:05,660
no longer a joke. They killed

6171
03:30:05,660 --> 03:30:07,660
Thief, they killed Deus Ex, and

6172
03:30:07,660 --> 03:30:09,660
they think they can take on a third. Let me

6173
03:30:09,660 --> 03:30:11,660
be the first to say, good luck

6174
03:30:11,660 --> 03:30:13,660
guys. When you come at the king,

6181
03:30:35,660 --> 03:30:37,660
Hey, thanks for watching.

6182
03:30:37,660 --> 03:30:39,660
I'm sorry. At the

6183
03:30:39,660 --> 03:30:41,660
end of another long video, I promised I wouldn't

6184
03:30:41,660 --> 03:30:43,660
make a video any longer than I already had.

6185
03:30:43,660 --> 03:30:45,660
It's really embarrassing that I keep making

6186
03:30:45,660 --> 03:30:47,660
things way longer. I tried.

6187
03:30:47,660 --> 03:30:49,660
I really tried. I cut out a whole 15

6188
03:30:49,660 --> 03:30:51,660
minutes about the history of mirrors in video

6189
03:30:51,660 --> 03:30:53,660
games and made it a bonus video for patrons

6190
03:30:53,660 --> 03:30:55,660
in the hopes of getting the length under control

6191
03:30:55,660 --> 03:30:57,660
and it just kept growing. Thanks to all

6192
03:30:57,660 --> 03:30:59,660
my patrons for allowing me to survive while

6193
03:30:59,660 --> 03:31:01,660
making this. In case you're wondering,

6194
03:31:01,660 --> 03:31:03,660
no, this isn't my normal recording setup.

6195
03:31:03,660 --> 03:31:05,660
I'm actually visiting my producer

6196
03:31:05,660 --> 03:31:07,660
on my way to a wedding and it

6197
03:31:07,660 --> 03:31:09,660
turns out that she has

6198
03:31:09,660 --> 03:31:11,660
put some foam up in her closet

6199
03:31:11,660 --> 03:31:13,660
so I'm just recording here for now.

6200
03:31:13,660 --> 03:31:15,660
If any of the voiceover sounds bad,

6201
03:31:15,660 --> 03:31:17,660
it's her fault.

6202
03:31:17,660 --> 03:31:19,660
And in case you asked, yes, these are

6203
03:31:19,660 --> 03:31:21,660
the clothes I intend to wear for the wedding.

6204
03:31:21,660 --> 03:31:23,660
I didn't bring any smart clothes to wear

6205
03:31:23,660 --> 03:31:25,660
for recording the live action part of this video.

6206
03:31:25,660 --> 03:31:27,660
And I forgot to bring shoes, so

6207
03:31:27,660 --> 03:31:29,660
hopefully no one looks at my feet.

6208
03:31:31,660 --> 03:31:33,660
I don't know why I brought that up.

6209
03:31:33,660 --> 03:31:35,660
I went to Birmingham for

6210
03:31:35,660 --> 03:31:37,660
a different wedding, like,

6211
03:31:37,660 --> 03:31:39,660
four years ago and my car

6212
03:31:39,660 --> 03:31:41,660
got broken into and my nice

6213
03:31:41,660 --> 03:31:43,660
shoes were stolen and I never got

6214
03:31:43,660 --> 03:31:45,660
replacements.

6215
03:31:45,660 --> 03:31:47,660
So

6216
03:32:15,660 --> 03:32:17,660
...

6217
03:32:17,660 --> 03:32:19,660
...

6218
03:32:19,660 --> 03:32:21,660
...

6219
03:32:21,660 --> 03:32:23,660
...

6220
03:32:23,660 --> 03:32:25,660
...

6221
03:32:25,660 --> 03:32:27,660
...

6222
03:32:27,660 --> 03:32:29,660
...

6223
03:32:29,660 --> 03:32:31,660
...

6224
03:32:31,660 --> 03:32:33,660
...

6225
03:32:33,660 --> 03:32:35,660
...

6226
03:32:35,660 --> 03:32:37,660
...

6227
03:32:37,660 --> 03:32:39,660
...

6228
03:32:39,660 --> 03:32:41,660
I've actually tried to make a video

6229
03:32:41,660 --> 03:32:43,660
about Deus Ex Human Revolution.

6230
03:32:43,660 --> 03:32:45,660
Every year and a half I've, like,

6231
03:32:45,660 --> 03:32:47,660
restarted since

6232
03:32:47,660 --> 03:32:49,660
2016. It was, like, the second long

6233
03:32:49,660 --> 03:32:51,660
video I wanted to make and I just kept

6234
03:32:51,660 --> 03:32:53,660
giving up because the

6235
03:32:53,660 --> 03:32:55,660
video script ballooned to a length

6236
03:32:55,660 --> 03:32:57,660
where I was like, this is unwatchable.

6237
03:32:57,660 --> 03:32:59,660
And I only finished it this time because I just

6238
03:32:59,660 --> 03:33:01,660
accepted I have to make

6239
03:33:01,660 --> 03:33:03,660
a video that's too long to get

6240
03:33:03,660 --> 03:33:05,660
this thing out of my brain and move on with my life.

6241
03:33:05,660 --> 03:33:07,660
And now I'm finally free

6242
03:33:07,660 --> 03:33:09,660
and I can move on to other things, which is lovely.

6243
03:33:09,660 --> 03:33:11,660
So

6244
03:33:11,660 --> 03:33:13,660
the next game I want to review

6245
03:33:13,660 --> 03:33:15,660
is the Deus Ex

6246
03:33:15,660 --> 03:33:17,660
Human Revolution Director's Cut

6247
03:33:19,660 --> 03:33:21,660
and that is not a joke.

6248
03:33:23,660 --> 03:33:25,660
And I'm scared.

6249
03:33:29,660 --> 03:33:31,660
I'm scared about what is

6250
03:33:31,660 --> 03:33:33,660
happening to me.
