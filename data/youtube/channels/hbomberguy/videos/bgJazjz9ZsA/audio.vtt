00:07.940 --> 00:09.240
In June 2000,

00:09.240 --> 00:11.480
Ion Storm released Deus Ex.

00:11.480 --> 00:13.980
Deus Ex is one of the best games ever made.

00:13.980 --> 00:15.820
Its engaging free-form gameplay

00:15.820 --> 00:17.980
and complex storytelling quickly cemented it

00:17.980 --> 00:20.160
as one of the true classics of the medium.

00:20.160 --> 00:25.860
♪

00:25.860 --> 00:27.500
So the developer went bankrupt.

00:27.500 --> 00:29.800
If that line sounds familiar to you,

00:29.800 --> 00:31.460
get used to it. Like, 12 more videos

00:31.460 --> 00:32.460
are gonna start this way.

00:32.460 --> 00:34.260
Eidos Interactive, the game's publisher,

00:34.260 --> 00:36.600
was the 51% shareholder in Ion Storm,

00:36.600 --> 00:38.060
so when the company closed its doors

00:38.060 --> 00:39.840
and the creators quit or got let go,

00:39.840 --> 00:41.500
the Deus Ex intellectual property

00:41.500 --> 00:43.180
didn't belong to any of the people who,

00:43.180 --> 00:44.440
you know, made it,

00:44.440 --> 00:46.940
but to a bunch of executives at a publishing company.

00:46.940 --> 00:49.040
Then Eidos Interactive's parent company,

00:49.040 --> 00:50.040
also named Eidos,

00:50.040 --> 00:51.720
which made researching this very confusing,

00:51.720 --> 00:54.020
got bought and merged with another game publisher,

00:54.020 --> 00:55.420
Sales Curve Interactive.

00:55.420 --> 00:57.060
Then they hit major financial trouble

00:57.060 --> 00:59.260
and realized they need to make games to survive

00:59.280 --> 01:01.380
and opened a new development studio in Canada

01:01.380 --> 01:04.060
which began development on the next Deus Ex game.

01:04.060 --> 01:05.060
While that was happening,

01:05.060 --> 01:06.720
things were going great at SCI.

01:06.720 --> 01:09.120
Just kidding, it went so bad the CEO got fired.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.120
To get a fresh start,

01:10.120 --> 01:12.560
they renamed the company to Eidos.

01:12.560 --> 01:13.560
Hold on a second.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.060
Then they got bought again,

01:15.060 --> 01:16.560
this time by Square Enix.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.500
Square Enix said they were going to leave Eidos

01:18.500 --> 01:20.400
to themselves, then changed their mind

01:20.400 --> 01:21.900
and forcibly merged the company

01:21.900 --> 01:23.700
with their European branch and oh, my God,

01:23.700 --> 01:26.080
isn't the game industry so normal and fine?

01:26.080 --> 01:27.780
While all of that was happening,

01:27.800 --> 01:29.200
the team at Eidos Montreal

01:29.200 --> 01:31.340
had to somehow make a video game.

01:31.340 --> 01:33.980
The making of documentary for this new Deus Ex game

01:33.980 --> 01:36.140
begins with a bunch of talk about how great it is

01:36.140 --> 01:38.940
to work with Eidos from French-Canadian developers

01:38.940 --> 01:41.020
wearing t-shirts with the Eidos branding.

01:41.020 --> 01:43.980
Eidos has a very rich IP portfolio.

01:43.980 --> 01:46.360
I mean, their projects are just great.

01:46.360 --> 01:47.980
Their IPs are very rich.

01:47.980 --> 01:49.560
Partway through, Eidos disappears

01:49.560 --> 01:52.060
from the story completely because they stopped existing

01:52.060 --> 01:54.560
and they suddenly had completely different bosses.

01:54.560 --> 01:57.460
Being owned by Square Enix came with some benefits though.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.680
They got to reference Final Fantasy a few times.

01:59.680 --> 02:02.060
One of the bosses, a big guy with a gun for an arm,

02:02.060 --> 02:03.520
got to be named Barret.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.520
They put a poster on some character's walls

02:05.520 --> 02:07.720
for a Final Fantasy 27, you know,

02:07.720 --> 02:09.320
because it's the future. It's cute.

02:09.320 --> 02:10.820
So it wasn't all bad.

02:10.820 --> 02:12.200
Just kidding. It was bad.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.820
The executives at Square Enix

02:13.820 --> 02:15.900
weren't going to let them do this.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.320
They didn't want to risk damaging

02:17.320 --> 02:18.740
the Final Fantasy brand

02:18.740 --> 02:20.120
any more than Kingdom Hearts already.

02:20.120 --> 02:22.660
The team at Eidos Montreal had to argue their way up

02:22.660 --> 02:24.240
the corporate chain of the business

02:24.240 --> 02:27.380
that just bought them all the way up to Yoichi Wada,

02:27.380 --> 02:29.880
the president and director of the entire company,

02:29.880 --> 02:32.300
to get permission to put a funny poster

02:32.300 --> 02:34.460
in the background of their game.

02:34.460 --> 02:37.020
Deus Ex used to be a series that criticized

02:37.020 --> 02:39.140
the bizarre machinations of corporations

02:39.140 --> 02:41.340
so big no one knows who they're working for,

02:41.340 --> 02:44.060
where intellectual property and brand management

02:44.060 --> 02:45.520
mattered more than people,

02:45.520 --> 02:49.100
a world where one company can own half your childhood,

02:49.100 --> 02:51.520
a system governed more by tax incentives

02:51.520 --> 02:53.400
and corporate subsidies than people.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.940
It asked important questions about the future of mankind,

02:56.960 --> 02:59.180
about who wielded power over others

02:59.180 --> 03:01.260
and what their interests really were,

03:01.260 --> 03:03.720
a story sometimes so accurate in its guesses

03:03.720 --> 03:06.300
it seems less fictitious now than ever.

03:06.300 --> 03:10.640
But then, many years and corporate acquisitions later,

03:10.640 --> 03:13.480
comes Deus Ex Human Revolution,

03:13.480 --> 03:16.640
the game that dares to ask the question,

03:16.640 --> 03:19.360
what if we had robot arms?

03:19.360 --> 03:30.800
♪♪

03:30.800 --> 03:33.420
Deus Ex Human Revolution is pretty good.

03:33.420 --> 03:35.420
It's fun. Yeah.

03:35.420 --> 03:37.420
I have a tendency to make videos about things

03:37.420 --> 03:39.420
I either really love or really hate,

03:39.420 --> 03:42.020
so just to clear up any potential confusion here,

03:42.020 --> 03:44.060
this game is fine. Good job, guys.

03:44.060 --> 03:46.100
I'm about to spend, uh, oh, my God,

03:46.100 --> 03:47.900
complaining about it, but I need to say,

03:47.900 --> 03:50.680
this was the first game by a new studio,

03:50.680 --> 03:53.140
and it was being made while they were being bought out

03:53.140 --> 03:56.060
by Square Enix by a team that had never previously worked

03:56.060 --> 03:58.520
on any games even remotely like Deus Ex.

03:58.520 --> 04:00.160
I might not think the game is perfect,

04:00.160 --> 04:02.820
but it is a genuine achievement that it's this good.

04:02.820 --> 04:04.740
So why am I talking about it then?

04:04.740 --> 04:06.460
That's a good question. Me?

04:06.460 --> 04:07.740
Well, here's the thing.

04:07.740 --> 04:10.540
The original Deus Ex belonged to a special subgenre

04:10.540 --> 04:12.800
of games named the immersive sim.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.660
In a sentence, immersive sims are games

04:14.660 --> 04:16.960
that feel just that little bit more like worlds

04:16.980 --> 04:18.160
you're taking part in.

04:18.160 --> 04:19.980
They prioritized the player's freedom

04:19.980 --> 04:21.700
to choose how to solve problems

04:21.700 --> 04:24.540
and then dealing with the consequences of those choices

04:24.540 --> 04:27.540
and being able to find creative and unexpected solutions,

04:27.540 --> 04:30.000
often ones the developers themselves hadn't thought of,

04:30.000 --> 04:32.080
by being built in a way that could respond well

04:32.080 --> 04:33.420
to player creativity.

04:33.420 --> 04:34.580
There's a lot of different ways

04:34.580 --> 04:36.260
you can define an immersive sim,

04:36.260 --> 04:37.880
but there's only one real one.

04:37.880 --> 04:40.680
Can you solve a problem intended to be solved with a gun

04:40.680 --> 04:42.920
by stacking a bunch of boxes and going over it?

04:42.920 --> 04:44.920
In the late 90s and early 2000s,

04:44.940 --> 04:46.980
immersive sims were coming out fairly often,

04:46.980 --> 04:48.600
and people still look back fondly

04:48.600 --> 04:50.020
on many of those games,

04:50.020 --> 04:53.360
but then almost overnight, they disappeared.

04:53.360 --> 04:57.600
An entire genre of games basically died out for years,

04:57.600 --> 04:58.700
but a couple of years back,

04:58.700 --> 05:00.200
we started to get more of them again,

05:00.200 --> 05:01.860
and they're amazing and beautiful

05:01.860 --> 05:04.160
and a lot like the games that people remember.

05:04.160 --> 05:07.080
Human Revolution is a fascinating orphan of history.

05:07.080 --> 05:09.540
It came out between the two golden ages

05:09.540 --> 05:11.660
of the immersive sim when this type of game

05:11.660 --> 05:14.160
wasn't considered popular or profitable enough,

05:14.160 --> 05:15.280
so while they were making it,

05:15.280 --> 05:16.780
the team made a lot of changes

05:16.780 --> 05:18.780
to try and make it a bit like other games

05:18.780 --> 05:20.040
people liked at the time,

05:20.040 --> 05:22.420
trying to streamline it and make it more accessible

05:22.420 --> 05:23.740
for a console audience.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.540
I'll give you three guesses why they decided

05:25.540 --> 05:27.660
the game needed third-person cover shooting,

05:27.660 --> 05:28.800
and at the time of release,

05:28.800 --> 05:30.840
people seemed happy with its compromises,

05:30.840 --> 05:32.920
but the thing about immersive sims is

05:32.920 --> 05:36.140
they were already great and didn't need changing.

05:36.140 --> 05:38.420
Recent games like the new Prey have proven

05:38.420 --> 05:40.840
immersive sims barely need to change at all

05:40.840 --> 05:42.380
from how they were 20 years ago

05:42.400 --> 05:44.940
to be amazing at what they're trying to do,

05:44.940 --> 05:46.820
so when the Human Revolution team decided

05:46.820 --> 05:48.580
the Deus Ex formula was broken,

05:48.580 --> 05:51.040
all their fixes actually made it less like

05:51.040 --> 05:52.620
what makes these games great,

05:52.620 --> 05:55.540
so today in this year's self-therapy session

05:55.540 --> 05:57.420
masquerading as a video game analysis,

05:57.420 --> 05:58.800
I'll be trying to get to the bottom

05:58.800 --> 06:00.340
of what happened to Deus Ex

06:00.340 --> 06:02.040
to see what we can learn about how

06:02.040 --> 06:04.220
or how not to modernize a classic

06:04.220 --> 06:05.760
because there's a lot more at stake here

06:05.760 --> 06:07.680
than just one beloved franchise.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.380
After doing some digging into the lineage

06:09.380 --> 06:10.880
of the intellectual property rights

06:10.880 --> 06:12.340
of some of my favorite franchises,

06:12.340 --> 06:15.100
I discovered Square Enix might not just be rebooting

06:15.100 --> 06:17.300
slash remaking slash beating the dead horses

06:17.300 --> 06:20.100
of the Deus Ex, Tomb Raider, and Thief properties.

06:20.100 --> 06:22.100
No, a much more important franchise

06:22.100 --> 06:23.600
lives under their jurisdiction,

06:23.600 --> 06:25.940
one of the most important and meaningful stories

06:25.940 --> 06:27.280
in gaming history.

06:27.280 --> 06:30.860
I'm speaking, of course, about Gex.

06:30.860 --> 06:32.940
The Gex trilogy sold millions of copies

06:32.940 --> 06:34.700
and arguably saved the world,

06:34.700 --> 06:37.820
but there hasn't been a new Gex since 1999,

06:37.820 --> 06:39.660
and due to Crystal Dynamics' acquisition

06:39.660 --> 06:41.320
by Eidos in 1998,

06:41.320 --> 06:44.040
Square Enix's 2009 acquisition of the company

06:44.040 --> 06:46.160
that bought Eidos and renamed itself to Eidos

06:46.160 --> 06:47.620
means it's only a matter of time

06:47.620 --> 06:49.920
before Squeenix puts someone to work

06:49.920 --> 06:52.620
reviving the sleeping god in their possession,

06:52.620 --> 06:55.080
so for all our sakes,

06:55.080 --> 06:57.500
it's worth seeing if we can learn from other attempts

06:57.500 --> 06:58.800
to revive old franchises

06:58.800 --> 07:02.380
and come up with some general pointers.

07:02.380 --> 07:05.380
Gex and Deus Ex form a symbiont circle.

07:05.380 --> 07:07.140
What happens to one of them will affect the other.

07:07.140 --> 07:09.640
You must understand this, so we have to do this.

07:09.660 --> 07:11.460
For Gex, if we're not careful,

07:11.460 --> 07:13.000
he'll be in the next Kingdom Hearts

07:13.000 --> 07:16.220
and Kiss, Goofy, and Society will fucking crumble.

07:16.220 --> 07:18.540
♪ ♪

07:18.540 --> 07:20.460
A really good test of role-playing games

07:20.460 --> 07:22.880
is how quickly players get to do that.

07:22.880 --> 07:24.760
In Deus Ex, you press new game,

07:24.760 --> 07:26.220
and then you're making a character.

07:26.220 --> 07:27.480
Then there's an opening cutscene,

07:27.480 --> 07:28.980
and bam, you're at your first mission,

07:28.980 --> 07:31.140
the iconic and impressively open-ended

07:31.140 --> 07:32.360
Liberty Island level.

07:32.360 --> 07:35.020
A huge part of why this game still works so well

07:35.020 --> 07:37.180
is how instantaneously it makes you feel

07:37.180 --> 07:39.320
like you're playing it your own way.

07:39.340 --> 07:41.380
You've only just decided your character's

07:41.380 --> 07:43.880
starting abilities, and already you're being told

07:43.880 --> 07:45.840
to put them to use how you see fit

07:45.840 --> 07:47.760
to capture the NSF leader holed up

07:47.760 --> 07:48.960
in the Statue of Liberty.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.260
Within literally seconds of starting the game,

07:51.260 --> 07:53.300
you're being asked to pick a new weapon

07:53.300 --> 07:55.100
by a character whose appearance changes

07:55.100 --> 07:56.800
based on what your character looks like

07:56.800 --> 07:58.180
because he's your brother.

07:58.180 --> 08:00.180
That's a pretty freeing way to start a game,

08:00.180 --> 08:01.680
giving players a bunch of choices

08:01.680 --> 08:03.680
and already reacting to one they made

08:03.680 --> 08:05.280
in the character creation screen,

08:05.280 --> 08:08.060
but this type of opening isn't unique to Deus Ex though.

08:08.060 --> 08:09.560
It's a staple of the genre.

08:09.560 --> 08:10.560
In, I don't know,

08:10.560 --> 08:12.060

08:20.780 --> 08:22.120
is Fallout New Vegas,

instantly plopping the character

08:26.960 --> 08:28.820
Putting the player in the driver's seat

08:28.820 --> 08:31.580
as quickly as possible creates a sense of agency

08:31.580 --> 08:33.660
which is pivotal in games that prioritize

08:33.660 --> 08:36.340
making choices and playing a role.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.460
In Deus Ex Human Revolution,

08:42.460 --> 08:44.300
I was a bit worried when I realized

08:44.300 --> 08:46.680
there wasn't anything like a character creation screen,

08:46.680 --> 08:49.220
but hey, I'm old. Maybe those are outdated now.

08:49.220 --> 08:51.140
I did do a little cringe when I saw

08:51.140 --> 08:52.840
the highest difficulty was called

08:52.840 --> 08:54.440
Give Me Deus Ex though.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.860
Sure, tell me to have high expectations.

08:56.860 --> 08:58.940
That hasn't ruined my life before.

08:58.940 --> 09:01.240
♪♪

09:01.240 --> 09:03.240
Is everything in place?

09:03.240 --> 09:04.860
Almost.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.060
What do you mean, almost?

09:07.060 --> 09:08.560
The game begins with the weekly

09:08.560 --> 09:10.260
Illuminati Zoom conference

09:10.260 --> 09:12.220
where they ominously discuss their plans

09:12.220 --> 09:14.480
while trying to change the default profile picture.

09:14.480 --> 09:17.900
Apart from one teeny, tiny, massive problem,

09:17.900 --> 09:19.160
I really like this opening.

09:19.160 --> 09:22.120
I especially like how short it pretends to be.

09:22.120 --> 09:24.900
The intro ends and bam, you are Adam Jensen,

09:24.900 --> 09:27.080
head of security at Sarif Industries.

09:27.080 --> 09:29.240
Oh, it's really thematic if you think about it.

09:29.240 --> 09:32.240
You see, Adam is a clever reference to Seinfeld.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.040
Remember my friend Adam from Detroit?

09:34.060 --> 09:35.400
Yeah, the guy with the dog mantid.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.140
Ah!

09:37.140 --> 09:39.560
I do like that it zooms in on his head to start the game.

09:39.560 --> 09:41.320
I'm glad someone's repping the classics.

09:41.320 --> 09:42.740
Wow, that was pretty quick.

09:42.740 --> 09:44.280
It's time to begin the first level

09:44.280 --> 09:45.820
and start playing the game. Nope.

09:45.820 --> 09:47.860
You see, the problem with the original Deus Ex

09:47.860 --> 09:50.440
was you didn't spend 20 minutes watching J.C. Denton

09:50.440 --> 09:53.040
waddle around his office making small talk first.

09:53.040 --> 09:55.120
The opening cut scene is far from over.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.880
The top scientist at Sarif Industries

09:56.880 --> 09:58.200
is Adam's ex-girlfriend,

09:58.200 --> 09:59.580
but they're still pretty close.

09:59.580 --> 10:01.660
You can tell because they decided to pose her

10:01.660 --> 10:04.040
like a teenage anime school girl.

10:04.040 --> 10:07.260
And I thought women were the ones who kept men waiting.

10:07.260 --> 10:09.000
Oh-ho-ho-ho! Gender!

10:09.000 --> 10:10.420
The introduction isn't one minute

10:10.420 --> 10:13.220
of ominous, interesting dialogue followed by gameplay.

10:13.220 --> 10:16.560
It's followed by many minutes of walking and talking,

10:16.560 --> 10:18.020
meaningless techno babble.

10:18.020 --> 10:19.360
But the increased neural peptides

10:19.360 --> 10:20.860
coming from the PDOC cluster...

10:20.860 --> 10:22.360
That actually happens twice.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.320
I'm thinking the glial tissue breakdown

10:24.320 --> 10:26.520
you noticed after splicing in the repressive protein

10:26.520 --> 10:27.520
might be the cause.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.520
Oh, yeah, this is great.

10:29.520 --> 10:31.400
We might get a more accurate reading...

10:31.440 --> 10:33.780
Da-na-na-na-na-na.

10:33.780 --> 10:36.360
And then you get to watch a weapons demonstration,

10:36.360 --> 10:39.020
argue with your co-workers in the elevator...

10:40.280 --> 10:42.100
Watch the planes go by,

10:42.100 --> 10:44.020
and listen to your boss tell you how important

10:44.020 --> 10:46.660
all that stuff was for the future of the human race

10:46.660 --> 10:48.020
before they realize they're losing you

10:48.020 --> 10:50.280
so, uh, uh, a terrorist attack happens.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.580
There we go. Oh, boy, a call to action.

10:52.580 --> 10:54.320
Now we can finally start the game.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.780
The unskippable tutorial for how to play the game.

10:56.780 --> 10:59.240
We need to make sure you know how to crouch,

10:59.240 --> 11:01.240
move boxes around,

11:01.240 --> 11:04.080
use vents, and take cover.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.460
Click on enemies to shoot them.

11:06.460 --> 11:08.460
Okay, now do it a few more times just in case.

11:08.460 --> 11:09.960
Okay, well, at least it's over

11:09.960 --> 11:11.420
and now we all know how to play

11:11.420 --> 11:13.300
so now we can start the game.

11:13.300 --> 11:14.840
Watch another cut scene.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.260
Adam gets knackered by some bastards.

11:17.260 --> 11:19.800
Then the bad man shoots him into a hospital

11:19.800 --> 11:20.800
where the game transitions

11:20.800 --> 11:22.640
into a really cool opening sequence.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.260
Adam has most of his body replaced

11:24.260 --> 11:26.020
with mechanical parts and the music swells

11:26.020 --> 11:27.860
and, ah, yeah, it's a really cool opening.

11:27.860 --> 11:30.100
And now, finally, after the opening cut scene

11:30.100 --> 11:31.680
and the walk and talk and all this set up

11:31.680 --> 11:33.360
and a tutorial and another cut scene,

11:33.360 --> 11:34.600
the game can start.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.320
Here he is. Here's our boy.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.860
Oh, man, they're doing it again.

11:37.860 --> 11:39.100
Yeah!

11:39.100 --> 11:40.700
Finally, you can play the game.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.900
Start a sequence where Adam comes back into work

11:42.900 --> 11:44.540
to get his heads-up display fixed

11:44.540 --> 11:48.320
by the IT guy on his way to the first mission.

11:48.320 --> 11:50.660
Only then can you go to the helipad

11:50.660 --> 11:52.380
and after another cut scene,

11:52.380 --> 11:54.120
you have a conversation in the aircraft

11:54.120 --> 11:56.380
with your boss about the mission you're headed into

11:56.380 --> 11:57.800
and get to pick a weapon.

11:57.820 --> 12:00.160
The first real choice in the game.

12:00.160 --> 12:02.900
As a reminder, you're making the same choice

12:02.900 --> 12:06.160
literally five seconds into the original Deus Ex.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.160
Give me the GEP gun.

12:15.620 --> 12:17.180
if you were going as fast as possible

12:17.180 --> 12:18.180
and skipping everything,

12:18.180 --> 12:20.340
but when I tried that, I hit a little snag.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.180

12:35.740 --> 12:37.200
the intro of the director's cut

13:09.660 --> 13:11.440
Now, I get what they're going for.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.580
Games with a more linear cinematic intent

13:13.580 --> 13:15.580
like Red Dead Redemption or The Last of Us

13:15.580 --> 13:17.700
or even Half-Life bring you into the narrative

13:17.700 --> 13:20.120
by slowly building to their gameplay like this,

13:20.120 --> 13:23.200
but for RPGs with a focus on player freedom and choice,

13:23.200 --> 13:25.200
this is the opposite of what you should do.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.360
The player doesn't feel like they're taking part

13:27.360 --> 13:29.440
in the story when they can barely control

13:29.440 --> 13:32.780
where Adam aims his head for most of his big introduction.

13:32.780 --> 13:34.320
For games like Deus Ex,

13:34.320 --> 13:37.420
which Human Revolution says it's trying to give people,

13:37.420 --> 13:39.460
you want the player to have a sense of control

13:39.460 --> 13:40.620
as soon as possible.

13:40.620 --> 13:41.620
Once it's over, though,

13:41.620 --> 13:43.000
everything really picks up,

13:43.000 --> 13:44.500
so it's not that big a deal,

13:44.500 --> 13:46.500
but if it's not a big deal, then why did I waste

13:46.500 --> 13:48.260
so much time complaining about it?

13:48.260 --> 13:49.760
Well, first of all, leave me alone.

13:49.900 --> 13:51.200
It's my video. I can do what I want.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.200
And secondly, I think this choice reflects

13:53.200 --> 13:54.940
a pretty serious misunderstanding

13:54.940 --> 13:57.500
about what makes these games fun to play.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.780
You see, this is an exact mistake

13:59.780 --> 14:03.120
the original game almost made too.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.080
See? I'm going somewhere with this.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.080
Please subscribe.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.660
They originally planned to begin

14:07.660 --> 14:10.260
with meeting all of your coworkers in your base,

14:10.260 --> 14:11.500
talking to everyone,

14:11.500 --> 14:14.220
a lot of exposition and setup and introductions,

14:14.220 --> 14:15.600
basically a lot of busy work

14:15.600 --> 14:17.600
that wouldn't be that fun to do first thing

14:17.600 --> 14:19.020
the instant you hit new game.

14:19.060 --> 14:21.100
Before there was an attack on UNATCO HQ

14:21.100 --> 14:22.900
that necessitated going into action.

14:22.900 --> 14:24.900
In other words, they had the same idea

14:24.900 --> 14:26.860
as the people who made Human Revolution,

14:26.860 --> 14:28.900
but they later realized it would be better

14:28.900 --> 14:30.400
if they started with gameplay

14:30.400 --> 14:32.280
and deliberately switched the order.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.900
This introduces a minor weird plot thing.

14:34.900 --> 14:37.580
You arrive on an island to deal with a terrorist attack

14:37.580 --> 14:40.540
and it's right next to where your new base happens to be.

14:40.540 --> 14:41.960
This would have made slightly more sense

14:41.960 --> 14:43.380
when you started at the base

14:43.380 --> 14:45.760
and went out when they attacked headquarters,

14:45.760 --> 14:47.840
which is how it seemed to work in original footage

14:47.860 --> 14:49.040
from betas of the game,

14:49.040 --> 14:50.580
but it was worth it to make this change

14:50.580 --> 14:53.000
because the player feels like a part of the story now,

14:53.000 --> 14:55.800
which is, you know, the goal of role-playing games.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.420
You don't feel like a part of the story

14:57.420 --> 14:59.420
by watching the character do things.

14:59.420 --> 15:02.680
You feel that way by getting to do things as the character,

15:02.680 --> 15:04.220
and there's a big difference there.

15:04.220 --> 15:05.880
I don't like giving direct advice

15:05.880 --> 15:08.900
like I know the exact correct way to make a game,

15:08.900 --> 15:11.400
but guys, start the game here.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.440
Start at the thing or in the plane

15:13.440 --> 15:14.560
on the way to the thing.

15:14.560 --> 15:16.140
The next game, Mankind Divided,

15:16.160 --> 15:18.700
did exactly that. You start on the plane.

15:18.700 --> 15:21.000
I mean, it had three more opening sequences

15:21.000 --> 15:22.040
after it for some reason.

15:22.040 --> 15:23.620
More importantly than any of this though,

15:23.620 --> 15:26.120
we need to circle back to the most fascinating part

15:26.120 --> 15:27.120
of this whole thing.

15:27.120 --> 15:28.500
Deus Ex Human Revolution

15:28.500 --> 15:30.800
recreated an exact problem

15:30.800 --> 15:32.840
the original game almost had

15:32.840 --> 15:35.300
and then fixed during development.

15:35.300 --> 15:37.420
I think we need to explore how something like that

15:37.420 --> 15:38.680
can happen, right?

15:38.680 --> 15:41.940
♪♪

15:41.940 --> 15:43.860
So the development of Human Revolution

15:43.860 --> 15:45.680
was a bit of a mess.

15:45.680 --> 15:47.640
I mean, first off, this was a new studio

15:47.640 --> 15:49.060
making their first game.

15:49.060 --> 15:50.600
You can't just snap your fingers

15:50.600 --> 15:54.860
and open a new 350-person development studio overnight.

15:54.860 --> 15:56.700
You have to build that, you know?

15:56.700 --> 15:58.320
And in this case, literally.

15:58.320 --> 16:00.480
When the studio opened, the building they planned

16:00.480 --> 16:03.200
to make their offices wasn't even finished being built.

16:03.200 --> 16:07.040
These guys left everything to come to a brand new studio

16:07.040 --> 16:10.700
with not even permanent offices yet.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.700
Building a new studio can't be easy.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.880
Now, you're clever, so you're probably wondering

16:14.880 --> 16:17.920
why so many game companies open studios in Montreal.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.760
I'm sure French-Canadians make for excellent game designers,

16:20.760 --> 16:21.880
but the answer is money.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.420
Here's the annual cost of hiring

16:23.420 --> 16:26.180
a video game programmer in various major cities.

16:26.180 --> 16:29.840
San Francisco, $119,404.

16:29.840 --> 16:34.060
Austin, where Deus Ex was developed, $91,161.

16:34.060 --> 16:36.140
Vancouver, $78,500.

16:36.140 --> 16:38.360
Toronto's almost at $78,000.

16:38.360 --> 16:43.480
They're getting there. Montreal, $72,335.

16:43.500 --> 16:48.260
Montreal with government tax credit, $45,209.

16:48.260 --> 16:51.920
Up to 37.5% of the cost of your employees' salaries

16:51.920 --> 16:54.720
are effectively given back to you by the province.

16:54.720 --> 16:57.640
Look, all I'm saying is I can telepathically predict

16:57.640 --> 16:59.800
where companies will open their next game studio.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.180
Don't believe me? It's all in the numbers.

17:02.180 --> 17:03.560
What, were EIDA supposed to open

17:03.560 --> 17:05.240
a new studio in Texas again?

17:05.240 --> 17:07.560
The biggest game studio headquartered in Texas now

17:07.560 --> 17:09.740
is, I think, Gearbox, right?

17:09.740 --> 17:12.080
And guess where they're opening their new studio?

17:12.100 --> 17:13.920
Come to work at Gearbox Quebec.

17:13.920 --> 17:14.920
They don't pay very well,

17:14.920 --> 17:16.880
but they promise really good bonuses.

17:16.880 --> 17:18.180
I mean, they promise them.

17:18.180 --> 17:20.300
EIDAS Montreal also had to deal with the fact

17:20.300 --> 17:21.680
that they're the Canadian branch

17:21.680 --> 17:23.760
of a company that doesn't exist.

17:23.760 --> 17:25.760
They got acquired by another company

17:25.760 --> 17:28.140
while they were trying to make their first game.

17:28.140 --> 17:29.780
That's got to make the development process

17:29.780 --> 17:31.240
a little more complicated.

17:31.240 --> 17:34.900
It's, uh, it's, uh, two years or more of development.

17:34.900 --> 17:37.160
You never know how it's gonna turn out.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.320
It's easy to see why some aspects

17:39.320 --> 17:41.000
of the process got misplaced.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.760
Okay, I don't want to make any more excuses

17:42.760 --> 17:43.760
for the developers.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.000
It's starting to feel a bit condescending.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.760
Let's talk about some of the choices

17:46.760 --> 17:49.500
the developers made about how to design this game.

17:49.500 --> 17:52.060
In a hugely informative Game Developers Conference talk

17:52.060 --> 17:53.760
about the development of Human Revolution,

17:53.760 --> 17:55.760
gameplay director Francois Lapikus,

17:55.760 --> 17:57.260
sorry if I'm pronouncing that wrong,

17:57.260 --> 17:59.520
my Quebecois, Quebeci, Quebeci?

17:59.520 --> 18:01.180
My Canadian French isn't great,

18:01.180 --> 18:02.480
says during pre-production,

18:02.480 --> 18:04.520
the team planned the entire game

18:04.520 --> 18:07.240
and all of its features and mechanics in advance

18:07.240 --> 18:09.560
and then stuck to that plan throughout development,

18:09.580 --> 18:12.260
executing all of it with very few changes.

18:12.260 --> 18:14.960
Uh, we did not redo systems.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.260
Uh, we did not rethink the game.

18:17.260 --> 18:19.020
We just went full speed ahead.

18:19.020 --> 18:21.260
We knew exactly what we wanted this game to be,

18:21.260 --> 18:23.100
what we wanted the player to feel.

18:23.100 --> 18:24.940
Having a plan makes sense,

18:24.940 --> 18:26.940
but traditionally in game development,

18:26.940 --> 18:30.820
plans change over time as you see your game ideas in action

18:30.820 --> 18:32.600
and iterate and make changes.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.440
Human Revolution's main design team

18:34.440 --> 18:37.660
wrote all their initial ideas on huge sheets of paper

18:37.680 --> 18:39.520
and then stuck them to the walls

18:39.520 --> 18:41.220
and followed them religiously.

18:41.220 --> 18:43.020
Everything I've shown you so far,

18:43.020 --> 18:45.140
we put on huge sheets of paper

18:45.140 --> 18:47.320
which we papered the walls over with.

18:47.320 --> 18:49.240
Before they'd actually made the game,

18:49.240 --> 18:52.280
had a chance to see how it felt to play or test things out,

18:52.280 --> 18:54.400
they'd already decided how almost everything

18:54.400 --> 18:55.440
was going to be.

18:55.440 --> 18:58.040
So by having it, uh, on walls,

18:58.040 --> 19:00.000
every single morning when we came in,

19:00.000 --> 19:02.240
we saw exactly what we needed to do.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.540
They were so important in fact

19:03.540 --> 19:06.000
that when we moved to our, uh, final offices,

19:06.000 --> 19:07.380
it's the first thing we put up.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.020
By the end, the team had made a game

19:09.020 --> 19:11.680
that was absolutely brilliant...

19:11.680 --> 19:12.680
on paper.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.600
When I say Human Revolution feels like

19:14.600 --> 19:16.560
the first few ideas a bunch of guys had

19:16.560 --> 19:19.100
in a brainstorming session right at the start of development,

19:19.100 --> 19:21.240
that's because it is the first few ideas

19:21.240 --> 19:22.900
a bunch of guys had in a brainstorming session

19:22.900 --> 19:24.320
right at the start of development.

19:24.320 --> 19:25.320
Basically the whole game...

19:25.320 --> 19:26.320
Ha ha ha.

19:26.320 --> 19:27.480
Blueprint was a way for us

19:27.480 --> 19:29.360
to chart the whole game in advance.

19:29.360 --> 19:32.860
Just to show you this is, uh, half of the blueprint.

19:32.860 --> 19:35.000
Basically the whole game had been planned out

19:35.000 --> 19:36.860
on spreadsheets before they'd discovered,

19:36.860 --> 19:39.220
you know, some of it is boring and time consuming,

19:39.220 --> 19:40.980
and then they realized they'd forgotten

19:40.980 --> 19:43.020
to plan half the stuff that needed to be there

19:43.020 --> 19:45.100
and had to add major components to the game

19:45.100 --> 19:47.280
at the last minute and everybody hated them.

19:47.280 --> 19:50.940
Lapikus apologizes directly in his talk for the boss fights.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.280
They were a big part of the game

19:52.280 --> 19:54.080
and we should have put more efforts in them

19:54.080 --> 19:55.900
so truly sorry about that.

19:55.900 --> 19:57.460
While I was watching this talk,

19:57.460 --> 19:59.880
I was beginning to write a joke in my notebook

19:59.880 --> 20:02.960
like I guess no one wrote about the boss fights on the walls

20:02.960 --> 20:05.260
but it turns out that actually happened.

20:05.260 --> 20:06.720
Remember the directions sheets?

20:06.740 --> 20:08.820
I was talking about at the beginning.

20:08.820 --> 20:11.080
We didn't have one for boss fights.

20:11.080 --> 20:12.660
We kind of forgot about it

20:12.660 --> 20:15.040
because we didn't have these direction sheets.

20:15.040 --> 20:18.080
We didn't really know what we were doing with boss fights.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.300
Game development is a complicated process

20:20.300 --> 20:23.040
where initial ideas you had in a vacuum months ago

20:23.040 --> 20:25.340
might turn out not to work in practice.

20:25.340 --> 20:26.600
Just as a comparison,

20:26.600 --> 20:28.480
the team behind the original Deus Ex

20:28.480 --> 20:30.560
threw away half of their design document

20:30.560 --> 20:31.560
part way through.

20:31.560 --> 20:32.560
We ended up with,

20:32.560 --> 20:33.560
are you sitting down,

20:33.560 --> 20:36.600
500 pages of documentation?

20:36.780 --> 20:37.780
Yeah.

20:37.780 --> 20:38.780
No one read it.

20:38.780 --> 20:40.440
Um...

20:40.440 --> 20:42.440
Warren Spector, the director of the first game,

20:42.440 --> 20:44.520
is really open about how much rethinking

20:44.520 --> 20:46.660
needed to be done to make the game what it is

20:46.660 --> 20:48.460
even though they thought they knew everything

20:48.460 --> 20:50.280
they needed at the end of pre-production.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.620
The year Deus Ex came out,

20:51.620 --> 20:53.580
he wrote a retrospective for Gamasutra

20:53.580 --> 20:55.960
which incidentally changed its name to game developer

20:55.960 --> 20:58.080
while I was writing this video which was confusing

20:58.080 --> 21:00.300
and part of it covers just how much of their ideas

21:00.300 --> 21:02.180
got thrown out or replaced.

21:02.180 --> 21:03.760
That knowledge allowed us to go through

21:03.760 --> 21:05.880
our 500-page design documents

21:05.920 --> 21:07.920
and cut everything that was extraneous,

21:07.920 --> 21:11.720
winnowing it down to a svelte 270 pages.

21:11.720 --> 21:13.760
Less game, not at all.

21:13.760 --> 21:16.680
What was left was the best 270 pages,

21:16.680 --> 21:18.160
the stuff that worked.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.440
We were open to change, be open to change.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.020
Anybody who tells you that, you know,

21:22.020 --> 21:23.800
when you get to the end of pre-production,

21:23.800 --> 21:25.480
you've got a script and nothing changes

21:25.480 --> 21:26.960
has never made a game, right?

21:26.960 --> 21:28.300
Blueprint was a way for us

21:28.300 --> 21:30.060
to chart the whole game in advance.

21:30.060 --> 21:30.900
On the one hand,

21:30.900 --> 21:32.560
you have a game that appears to have been designed

21:32.560 --> 21:35.600
pretty intensively before they'd even made any of it

21:35.600 --> 21:38.000
and on the other, you have a team months from release

21:38.000 --> 21:39.840
who realize there's a problem and go,

21:39.840 --> 21:41.120
wait, hold on a second.

21:41.120 --> 21:43.440
Like me and Warren and Chris would sit in a room

21:43.440 --> 21:44.720
and fight like cats and dogs.

21:44.720 --> 21:45.720
It's just kind of weird

21:45.720 --> 21:47.280
that you introduce some of these characters,

21:47.280 --> 21:48.360
you interact with them a little bit

21:48.360 --> 21:49.760
and then they're just gone.

21:49.760 --> 21:52.320
He shows up in mission one, he shows up in mission two,

21:52.320 --> 21:54.200
he shows up in mission four

21:54.200 --> 21:56.360
and then you never hear from him again.

21:56.360 --> 21:57.600
What happened to that guy?

21:57.600 --> 21:58.960
And it was a powerful question

21:58.960 --> 22:00.880
because it was one of the basics of storytelling

22:00.880 --> 22:04.280
that we as video game designers weren't yet applying

22:04.280 --> 22:05.560
and so we went back.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.200
Now I'm sure I could wrap this point up here

22:07.200 --> 22:09.040
in a neat little bow and say something like,

22:09.040 --> 22:10.760
the real test of a creative work

22:10.760 --> 22:12.600
isn't having a lot of good ideas.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.480
It's understanding when you have to change them

22:14.480 --> 22:16.400
to make them work, but then you have to ask,

22:16.400 --> 22:19.200
why would anyone be so rigid about pre-production

22:19.200 --> 22:21.320
and unwilling to rethink things like this?

22:21.320 --> 22:23.400
Well, because they have to be.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.240
Think about how much game development

22:25.240 --> 22:27.120
has changed since the 90s.

22:27.120 --> 22:29.600
If someone had a better idea about a mechanic

22:29.600 --> 22:31.120
or wanted to rewrite the opening

22:31.120 --> 22:33.760
or redo some dialogue or swap the first two levels,

22:33.760 --> 22:35.160
it wasn't too much work,

22:35.160 --> 22:38.120
and crucially, not that much work was wasted.

22:38.120 --> 22:40.560
It's pretty easy to steer a canoe.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.680
Larger ships, however, are notoriously difficult to steer

22:43.680 --> 22:45.560
even when you see the problem in time.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.080
You know, like in that movie.

22:47.080 --> 22:48.600
Uh, Speed II?

22:48.600 --> 22:51.000
Games are vastly more expensive to make now.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.960
Need scores of programmers, artists, animators,

22:53.960 --> 22:56.840
directors, producers, designers, writers.

22:56.840 --> 22:58.520
Companies need organizational.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.200
Wait, I have more. Production assistants,

23:00.200 --> 23:02.360
general managers, composers, sound designers,

23:02.360 --> 23:04.480
mo-cap artists, the entire second company

23:04.480 --> 23:05.960
you farmed out the boss fights to,

23:05.960 --> 23:08.320
not to mention voice actors you have to call back in

23:08.320 --> 23:10.520
to do more work if you need to change anything big,

23:10.520 --> 23:12.560
and incidentally, one of Human Revolution's

23:12.560 --> 23:15.000
other really big problems exists completely

23:15.000 --> 23:17.680
because they didn't want to have to call back a voice actor.

23:17.680 --> 23:18.920
I never asked for this.

23:18.920 --> 23:21.720
Things do need to be planned that much more in advance

23:21.720 --> 23:24.200
and stuck to pretty strictly if all these folks

23:24.200 --> 23:25.560
are gonna manage to come together

23:25.560 --> 23:27.840
to produce something that works at all.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.640
If someone on the team thought the opening

23:29.640 --> 23:31.520
kind of sucked and needed some reworking

23:31.520 --> 23:33.640
and I'm willing to bet several of them did,

23:33.640 --> 23:34.640
what were they gonna do?

23:34.640 --> 23:36.640
Cut out millions of dollars of work?

23:36.640 --> 23:38.360
Remove all that content you made

23:38.360 --> 23:39.800
and have to make even more?

23:39.800 --> 23:42.360
Tell the higher-ups you blew a ton of time and money

23:42.360 --> 23:43.360
and need more of it?

23:43.360 --> 23:45.160
They had to fight all the way to the top

23:45.160 --> 23:47.080
to get a fucking poster in here.

23:47.080 --> 23:48.440
Do you think they're gonna get that far

23:48.440 --> 23:51.200
asking them for the time to redo something this big?

23:51.200 --> 23:53.080
Now, I'm not strictly saying they wanted

23:53.080 --> 23:54.680
to fix the opening and couldn't.

23:54.680 --> 23:56.120
There's no way of knowing for certain

23:56.120 --> 23:57.960
unless someone who worked at IDES Montreal

23:57.960 --> 23:59.640
wants to go on record. Please email me.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.760
I'm just saying that in the AAA landscape

24:01.760 --> 24:03.240
that has sprouted as gaming became

24:03.240 --> 24:05.080
one of the biggest industries on the planet,

24:05.080 --> 24:07.800
you have so much less room to change and improve

24:07.800 --> 24:10.520
once you realize a guy disappears after mission four,

24:10.520 --> 24:12.760
and guess what? A guy literally does disappear

24:12.760 --> 24:13.760
after mission four.

24:13.760 --> 24:14.960
We'll get to that later.

24:14.960 --> 24:17.720
Human Revolution has many of the exact problems

24:17.720 --> 24:20.040
the original Deus Ex team have described

24:20.040 --> 24:22.200
their game having before they had the chance

24:22.200 --> 24:23.720
to go back and fix it.

24:23.720 --> 24:26.840
It just didn't get the polish and rethinking

24:26.840 --> 24:29.320
that made Deus Ex 1 quite so special,

24:29.320 --> 24:31.240
and this leads to much bigger problems

24:31.240 --> 24:32.440
than a boring opening.

24:32.440 --> 24:35.200
If you asked me what was the most important thing

24:35.200 --> 24:37.360
about these games, and you're watching this video

24:37.360 --> 24:39.160
so implicitly you are asking me,

24:39.160 --> 24:41.280
I'd say it's giving the player agency,

24:41.280 --> 24:43.920
giving them the freedom to make their own choices.

24:43.920 --> 24:46.040
Most of Human Revolution's biggest issues

24:46.040 --> 24:47.600
spring from a misunderstanding

24:47.600 --> 24:49.160
of what this actually means.

24:49.160 --> 24:51.400
Instead of giving players meaningful choices

24:51.400 --> 24:53.160
to make as Adam Jensen,

24:53.160 --> 24:55.560
lots of the game is about watching Adam Jensen

24:55.560 --> 24:58.200
make his own choices without the player's control.

24:58.200 --> 25:03.000
♪♪

25:03.000 --> 25:05.280
During the first level at the manufacturing plant,

25:05.280 --> 25:06.520
while you're making your way through

25:06.520 --> 25:08.160
or past the gang that has occupied it,

25:08.160 --> 25:09.800
there are hostages you can try to save,

25:09.800 --> 25:11.360
and there's also a climactic standoff

25:11.360 --> 25:12.960
with Zeke Sanders, the ringleader,

25:12.960 --> 25:14.440
who has a hostage at gunpoint.

25:14.440 --> 25:16.480
You can trigger a shootout where he kills the hostage

25:16.480 --> 25:18.120
and then attacks you, but if you're quick enough,

25:18.120 --> 25:20.560
you can take him out first and the hostage survives.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.280
You can also just let him go.

25:22.280 --> 25:23.720
This will cause the hostage to be killed

25:23.720 --> 25:25.480
in the crossfire during his escape,

25:25.480 --> 25:28.040
but you can actually talk him into letting her go

25:28.040 --> 25:29.600
and just walking out.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.320
One of the hostages you can save earlier

25:31.320 --> 25:32.680
is this woman's husband.

25:32.680 --> 25:34.000
If you saved both of them,

25:34.000 --> 25:35.800
they feel indebted to you and tell you

25:35.800 --> 25:37.680
to catch up with them later at their place.

25:37.680 --> 25:39.840
You're a true hero, man.

25:39.840 --> 25:41.920
I'll find some way to repay this, I swear.

25:41.920 --> 25:44.320
If you do, they give you the address of an arms dealer

25:44.320 --> 25:45.960
and get him to give you a discount.

25:45.960 --> 25:47.880
This is a really neat little side story

25:47.880 --> 25:49.760
that ties into the player's actions.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.480
The discount isn't even that useful

25:51.480 --> 25:53.000
for reasons we'll explore later,

25:53.000 --> 25:55.440
and these characters don't do anything else afterwards,

25:55.440 --> 25:57.040
but you don't need any wider effects

25:57.040 --> 25:58.640
than that for this to work.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.480
I can never thank you enough for what you did.

26:01.480 --> 26:03.760
The fun here comes from feeling briefly

26:03.760 --> 26:05.320
that you're tangibly involved

26:05.320 --> 26:08.000
in two tiny little digital lives,

26:08.000 --> 26:09.320
that the things you're doing

26:09.320 --> 26:11.880
and how you do them can make a difference.

26:11.880 --> 26:16.200
This side quest is genuinely really nice.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.880
However, it's also the best you're getting.

26:18.880 --> 26:20.680
When it comes to the main story,

26:20.680 --> 26:22.760
the thing you're focusing on for most of the game,

26:22.760 --> 26:25.600
the player has little to no freedom or control.

26:25.640 --> 26:27.160
You get to choose the in-flight meal,

26:27.160 --> 26:29.120
but the plane's on autopilot, and oh, no,

26:29.120 --> 26:31.040
a metaphor for the direction the story's taking.

26:31.040 --> 26:33.840
The actual story of the manufacturing plant level

26:33.840 --> 26:35.640
is about Adam walking in on a hacker

26:35.640 --> 26:37.960
going after the company's sensitive data,

26:37.960 --> 26:40.360
and I say Adam here, not the player,

26:40.360 --> 26:41.840
because once you reach the door,

26:41.840 --> 26:44.280
you're forced to watch him immediately get seen

26:44.280 --> 26:46.080
by the hacker and watch him get hacked

26:46.080 --> 26:48.200
by a double hacker and then fail

26:48.200 --> 26:50.000
to stop the hacker shooting himself.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Help me.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.240
♪♪

26:55.280 --> 26:56.800
This is an important story moment

26:56.800 --> 26:58.800
they thought would be really cool, you see,

26:58.800 --> 27:01.000
so the player's ability to interact with it

27:01.000 --> 27:02.480
needed to take a back seat.

27:02.480 --> 27:05.320
You don't get to decide what to do about the hacker.

27:05.320 --> 27:07.520
You get to watch a movie.

27:07.520 --> 27:09.080
Patch me to Seraph now.

27:09.080 --> 27:13.080
♪♪

27:13.080 --> 27:14.320
Oh, yeah, this is great.

27:14.320 --> 27:17.000
This could have been an engaging gameplay sequence.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.920
The player could have been able to knock them out

27:18.920 --> 27:20.360
using stealth or grab them

27:20.360 --> 27:21.960
before they managed to shoot themselves

27:21.960 --> 27:23.920
and only get this outcome if they were too slow

27:23.920 --> 27:25.240
and failed to stop them.

27:25.240 --> 27:27.600
You know, like that thing they do a few minutes later.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.560
Just do this but for the part of the story

27:29.560 --> 27:31.000
that actually matters.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.520
This would give the player a sense of direct interaction

27:33.520 --> 27:35.160
with the major events of the plot.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.360
The story wouldn't even need to change too much.

27:37.360 --> 27:38.960
Sure, this character dying here

27:38.960 --> 27:41.680
probably seems too important at first glance

27:41.680 --> 27:43.960
since the next quest involves breaking into the morgue

27:43.960 --> 27:46.400
of a police station to recover his brain computer

27:46.400 --> 27:48.120
from his body, but what if,

27:48.120 --> 27:49.800
even if you knocked him out,

27:49.800 --> 27:52.680
he mysteriously turned up dead in police custody?

27:52.680 --> 27:55.080
This would actually enhance the sense of a conspiracy

27:55.080 --> 27:57.240
while also making the player feel like

27:57.240 --> 27:58.520
they were involved in it.

27:58.520 --> 28:00.320
Instead of being, how dare the police

28:00.320 --> 28:02.800
not give my tech startup complete access

28:02.800 --> 28:05.360
to a corpse they just recovered five minutes ago,

28:05.360 --> 28:07.240
it would be, holy shit, they're in on it.

28:07.240 --> 28:08.240
They killed him.

28:08.240 --> 28:09.760
We can't let them get away with this.

28:09.760 --> 28:10.760
Ooh, hang on.

28:10.760 --> 28:12.080
Can we just talk about the design

28:12.080 --> 28:13.440
of this room for a second?

28:13.440 --> 28:15.120
It's built so you can see the hacker

28:15.120 --> 28:17.000
when you come in through the frosted glass,

28:17.000 --> 28:18.520
but you can't, like, distract him

28:18.520 --> 28:19.960
or come in through another route

28:19.960 --> 28:21.720
or shoot him through the glass

28:21.720 --> 28:23.160
or get his attention in any way.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.160
You just have to watch him playing this animation

28:25.160 --> 28:27.400
until you trigger the cutscene by going through the door.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.200
You can even see there's another way in,

28:29.200 --> 28:31.680
but you can't get over this stuff to get behind him.

28:31.680 --> 28:34.520
What's kind of insulting is they put an invisible wall here

28:34.520 --> 28:36.560
so you can't climb over it when you can climb over

28:36.560 --> 28:38.640
the stuff that's the same height right next to it.

28:38.640 --> 28:39.920
It's like they went out of their way

28:39.920 --> 28:41.640
to make it as obvious as possible

28:41.640 --> 28:44.600
that you have no choice except to come in through this room

28:44.600 --> 28:46.560
this one way and trigger the cutscene.

28:46.560 --> 28:49.160
Instead of giving you a reasonable amount of control,

28:49.160 --> 28:51.440
the game makes increasingly awkward attempts

28:51.440 --> 28:54.040
to make you feel like you're making more choices

28:54.040 --> 28:55.240
than you actually are.

28:55.240 --> 28:57.560
After the standoff, the cops have alternate lines

28:57.560 --> 29:00.200
of dialogue for almost every specific big thing

29:00.200 --> 29:01.680
that happened at the factory.

29:01.680 --> 29:03.920
If Sanders got away, if you killed him,

29:03.920 --> 29:05.680
if you saved the hostages or not,

29:05.680 --> 29:07.800
they all instantly know and have thoughts

29:07.800 --> 29:10.280
about every major thing you just did.

29:10.280 --> 29:12.600
Diffusing that bomb was some quick work.

29:12.600 --> 29:13.960
You should get a commendation.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.400
You have no idea how quickly I diffused the bomb.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.360
You weren't there.

29:18.360 --> 29:20.080
God damn!

29:25.080 --> 29:27.240
Nice job securing the plant.

29:27.240 --> 29:28.720
I wouldn't have thought a security guard

29:28.720 --> 29:29.720
could handle this.

29:29.720 --> 29:31.720
Doesn't even stop trying to kick the door down

29:31.720 --> 29:34.120
to tell me what he thinks about how I handled things.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.120
What a pro.

29:35.120 --> 29:36.640
When you get back to Sarif headquarters,

29:36.640 --> 29:38.640
everyone else reacts to your choices too

29:38.640 --> 29:41.120
in a way that starts to feel stilted and artificial

29:41.120 --> 29:42.560
like they're breathing down your neck

29:42.560 --> 29:44.320
trying to make you feel noticed.

29:44.320 --> 29:46.520
Talks all over the office, Mr. J.

29:46.520 --> 29:48.840
You really took care of those puny first assholes.

29:48.840 --> 29:50.600
How'd you take them down without killing them?

29:50.600 --> 29:53.880
Almost everyone at your job already has something to say.

29:53.880 --> 29:55.640
How did that monster get away from you?

29:55.640 --> 29:57.600
You saved the hostages, didn't you, Jensen?

29:57.600 --> 29:59.800
Apparently there wasn't much bloodshed thanks to you.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.640
Pritchard has one of two dialogue lines

30:01.640 --> 30:03.800
based on how many guys you killed at the plant.

30:03.800 --> 30:06.200
Well, well, if it isn't Attila the Hun,

30:06.200 --> 30:07.760
fresh from the killing fields.

30:07.760 --> 30:10.280
But if you killed very few people, he says this.

30:10.280 --> 30:13.560
Well, if it isn't Mahatma Gandhi himself.

30:13.560 --> 30:16.680
Come to honor us all with his life-preserving presence.

30:16.680 --> 30:17.720
Now, this is cute,

30:17.720 --> 30:19.520
accounting for the player's choices like this,

30:19.520 --> 30:21.800
but this one line is all that changes.

30:21.800 --> 30:24.840
In fact, even if you haven't killed anyone in the game yet,

30:24.840 --> 30:26.520
his next line is still this.

30:26.520 --> 30:29.600
Stick to kicking down doors and shooting people, Jensen,

30:29.600 --> 30:31.600
and stop trying to do my job.

30:31.600 --> 30:35.160
Someone wrote Pritchard to treat Jensen like a serial killer

30:35.160 --> 30:37.240
then realized they should probably account

30:37.240 --> 30:39.600
for the possibility the player hasn't killed anyone

30:39.600 --> 30:41.920
and added precisely one alternative line

30:41.920 --> 30:42.920
and moved on.

30:42.920 --> 30:44.880
I get the desire to make your home base

30:44.880 --> 30:47.160
feel like it's reacting to the player's choices.

30:47.160 --> 30:48.960
It's a really good idea on paper

30:48.960 --> 30:51.000
and you know those guys loved paper.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.240
Ha ha, good one.

30:52.240 --> 30:53.600
But if you execute it poorly,

30:53.600 --> 30:55.600
it doesn't feel like characters reacting

30:55.600 --> 30:57.200
to things another character did.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.560
It feels like writers scrambling to find ways

30:59.560 --> 31:01.400
to make you feel involved in a story.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.800
Jensen, is it true Sanders acted surprised

31:03.800 --> 31:04.800
when he heard about the hacker?

31:04.800 --> 31:07.040
Uh, buddy, that just happened.

31:07.040 --> 31:08.880
I just got back right now.

31:08.880 --> 31:11.120
Who told you this? Did you read the script?

31:11.160 --> 31:13.320
Luckily, this problem solves itself.

31:13.320 --> 31:14.480
After the early levels,

31:14.480 --> 31:16.760
the player has so little control over what happens

31:16.760 --> 31:19.520
that NPCs run out of things to react to you doing.

31:19.520 --> 31:21.640
Either that or even the writers realized

31:21.640 --> 31:23.040
how weird it would be if the people

31:23.040 --> 31:24.640
at your Detroit headquarters were like,

31:24.640 --> 31:26.280
hey, Adam, way to steal that key card

31:26.280 --> 31:27.440
from that brothel in China.

31:27.440 --> 31:29.080
The game has another way of creating

31:29.080 --> 31:30.320
the illusion of choice though.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.600
Many sequences have dialogue choices.

31:32.600 --> 31:35.200
These feel like choices because, well,

31:35.200 --> 31:37.960
they are technically, but what the game doesn't tell you

31:37.960 --> 31:39.920
is these choices do nothing.

31:39.920 --> 31:42.880
So how's it feel being augmented?

31:42.880 --> 31:43.880
Excuse me?

31:43.880 --> 31:45.720
The main character Jensen interacts with

31:45.720 --> 31:47.160
in the game is Farida Malik,

31:47.160 --> 31:48.560
Sarif Industries pilot.

31:48.560 --> 31:49.840
When you leave for the first level,

31:49.840 --> 31:52.320
she asks how you feel about coming back into work.

31:52.320 --> 31:53.680
When you get back to her afterwards,

31:53.680 --> 31:55.640
she asks for your take on the events of the mission,

31:55.640 --> 31:57.320
and as soon as you land, she asks you

31:57.320 --> 31:59.120
how you feel about being augmented.

31:59.120 --> 32:00.440
You get a lot of opportunities

32:00.440 --> 32:01.960
to choose what to say to Malik.

32:01.960 --> 32:04.200
Getting to make the choices is nice,

32:04.200 --> 32:06.240
but none of this does anything.

32:06.240 --> 32:08.280
Malik maybe gets annoyed in reply

32:08.280 --> 32:09.520
to the thing you just said,

32:09.520 --> 32:12.560
but it doesn't have any wider effect.

32:12.560 --> 32:15.000
These choices aren't here to give you control

32:15.000 --> 32:16.960
over a relationship with a character.

32:16.960 --> 32:18.920
They're here to make you feel like

32:18.920 --> 32:20.440
you have that kind of control.

32:20.440 --> 32:22.440
The game just briefly pretends

32:22.440 --> 32:24.000
to be Mass Effect sometimes,

32:24.000 --> 32:26.160
but with hexagons instead of a wheel.

32:26.160 --> 32:28.920
I think people should stop asking me so many questions.

32:28.920 --> 32:30.400
Then about two minutes later,

32:30.400 --> 32:31.800
the player is asked by someone else

32:31.800 --> 32:33.480
how he feels about being augmented.

32:33.480 --> 32:35.880
How do you handle all of this?

32:35.880 --> 32:38.680
It's the pretend players are making choices trick

32:38.680 --> 32:40.440
so nice they used it twice.

32:40.440 --> 32:41.840
This time is special, though,

32:41.840 --> 32:43.440
because he says the line.

32:43.440 --> 32:48.080
♪ ♪

32:48.080 --> 32:49.200
I never asked for this.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.280
Yeah!

32:50.280 --> 32:51.920
People were waiting with bated breath

32:51.920 --> 32:54.080
to see if Adam says the line from the trailer.

32:54.080 --> 32:55.480
I'm so glad they put it in there.

32:55.480 --> 32:57.480
A bunch of other stuff in the trailers didn't.

32:57.480 --> 33:00.000
Corporations have more power than the government.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
That's the most political thing Adam Jensen says.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.040
I want to play the game this was a trailer for.

33:05.040 --> 33:07.040
Oh, sweet. It's the cursed trailer

33:07.040 --> 33:08.200
version of this scene.

33:09.200 --> 33:11.880
This face haunts my nightmares.

33:11.880 --> 33:14.520
In many RPGs, how you talk to other characters

33:14.520 --> 33:16.040
affects how they feel about you,

33:16.040 --> 33:19.160
impacts the story, or comes back up in some way, you know?

33:19.160 --> 33:21.120
What if I told you that at no point

33:21.120 --> 33:23.920
do any dialogue choices you ever make

33:23.920 --> 33:26.200
affect anything other than the character's

33:26.200 --> 33:27.480
immediate reaction?

33:27.480 --> 33:29.240
There's a part where you can optionally help her

33:29.240 --> 33:31.360
unravel the death of one of her best friends

33:31.360 --> 33:32.800
and catch the real killer.

33:32.800 --> 33:35.240
What effect does this have on your relationship?

33:35.240 --> 33:36.840
She goes, thanks,

33:36.880 --> 33:38.800
and you never hear about it again.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.240
What if, for example,

33:40.240 --> 33:42.680
Adam could be a real piece of shit to his pilot

33:42.680 --> 33:44.480
and she stopped being friendly with him

33:44.480 --> 33:46.120
or didn't ask for his help later

33:46.120 --> 33:48.240
or straight up refused to work with him

33:48.240 --> 33:50.080
and he got assigned a worse pilot

33:50.080 --> 33:52.600
who didn't make small talk for the rest of the game?

33:52.600 --> 33:56.160
Instead, you get to pick angry, happy, or ambivalent,

33:56.160 --> 33:58.040
and she goes, okay,

33:58.040 --> 34:00.080
and the game continues like nothing happened.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.840
Your pilot will still be your friend

34:01.840 --> 34:04.240
and still ask for your help in a later side quest

34:04.240 --> 34:05.920
no matter how you treat her.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.920
Even when you technically have a choice,

34:07.920 --> 34:10.920
it only accentuates how little control you're being given.

34:10.920 --> 34:12.240
So what do you want me to do, boss?

34:12.240 --> 34:14.520
Take the mission to break into a police station morgue

34:14.520 --> 34:16.960
and find the hacker's delicious brain chips.

34:16.960 --> 34:18.760
You get this mission via your boss

34:18.760 --> 34:20.680
literally ordering you to do it.

34:20.680 --> 34:23.160
Get over to the station and find a way inside.

34:23.160 --> 34:25.320
Contact me when you've gotten a hold of it.

34:25.320 --> 34:27.840
But this is a modern RPG with dialogue options,

34:27.840 --> 34:29.640
so you're given the option of saying,

34:29.640 --> 34:33.160
hey, you're ordering me to do a really big crime here, right?

34:33.160 --> 34:34.560
What you're asking me to do,

34:34.560 --> 34:36.560
it's not exactly legal.

34:36.560 --> 34:39.280
No, it isn't.

34:39.280 --> 34:40.600
You got a problem with that?

34:40.600 --> 34:42.960
You can make Adam say he's not happy about,

34:42.960 --> 34:45.080
you know, robbing a police station,

34:45.080 --> 34:47.120
but the response is, too bad.

34:47.120 --> 34:49.440
That's the game, idiot.

34:49.440 --> 34:51.720
Yes, but... but nothing.

34:51.720 --> 34:53.000
So get going.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.720
The creators wanted to do a mission

34:54.720 --> 34:56.640
where you have to get into a police station.

34:56.640 --> 34:58.080
That's fine, and you have a lot of options

34:58.080 --> 34:59.080
for how to do that,

34:59.080 --> 35:00.840
but games which use dialogue like this

35:00.840 --> 35:02.440
usually offer different outcomes

35:02.440 --> 35:04.000
for making different choices.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.080
If this was Mass Effect or Fallout,

35:06.080 --> 35:08.840
you could talk your boss into trying a different approach

35:08.840 --> 35:10.560
for getting the information he needs,

35:10.560 --> 35:12.560
or alternatively, you could just not offer

35:12.560 --> 35:13.840
the illusion of a choice.

35:13.840 --> 35:15.960
If Adam had just said of his own accord,

35:15.960 --> 35:18.120
I don't like it, but I see how it's the only option,

35:18.120 --> 35:20.280
and moved on, it wouldn't have been a problem.

35:20.280 --> 35:22.240
JC spoke for himself all the time.

35:22.240 --> 35:24.040
You're making the limits of the player's role

35:24.040 --> 35:25.720
in the story really obvious

35:25.720 --> 35:27.680
when their big choice in dialogue

35:27.680 --> 35:29.920
amounts to how willingly their character

35:29.920 --> 35:32.160
agrees to commit a crime.

35:32.160 --> 35:35.600
Adam Jensen is an ex-cop who doesn't play by the rules,

35:35.600 --> 35:37.400
whether he likes it or not.

35:37.400 --> 35:39.280
Instead of you getting to make the choices,

35:39.280 --> 35:41.040
there's another character in the story

35:41.040 --> 35:42.760
making them for you.

35:42.760 --> 35:44.480
Cutscene Jensen.

35:44.480 --> 35:45.640
At numerous points,

35:45.640 --> 35:48.040
Adam either does something very stupid

35:48.040 --> 35:49.240
without you having a choice

35:49.240 --> 35:50.480
because the plot demands it,

35:50.480 --> 35:52.720
or worse, he does something really cool

35:52.720 --> 35:54.760
it would have been fun to actually play.

35:54.760 --> 35:55.920
There's one sequence later

35:55.920 --> 35:57.680
where the player plants a bomb on a desk.

35:57.680 --> 36:00.320
Luckily, they built the desk with a large glowing spot

36:00.360 --> 36:02.480
for in case someone needs to plant a bomb.

36:02.480 --> 36:03.880
They do those at Ikea now.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.000
Now, this is a setup

36:05.000 --> 36:07.040
to a potentially thrilling gameplay sequence

36:07.040 --> 36:09.360
where the player has to escape the explosion in time

36:09.360 --> 36:12.360
or find cover and capitalize on the distraction

36:12.360 --> 36:13.640
caused by the explosion,

36:13.640 --> 36:16.320
but instead it cuts to a video of Jensen doing it.

36:16.320 --> 36:18.000
♪♪

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Shit.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.920
♪♪

36:21.920 --> 36:22.920
I'm not gonna lie, though.

36:22.920 --> 36:25.720
This does look really fun and tense.

36:25.720 --> 36:27.520
It would have been really fun to play it.

36:27.520 --> 36:30.680
♪♪

36:30.680 --> 36:32.440
The cutscene continues for another, like,

36:32.440 --> 36:35.280
minute and a half as Jensen hides from the guards

36:35.280 --> 36:38.080
and then he decides to hide in a shipping container,

36:38.080 --> 36:41.200
finds a cryogenic pod in the shipping container,

36:41.200 --> 36:43.800
and then decides to just climb into it for some reason.

36:43.800 --> 36:46.440
This is how you find out this pod exists, by the way.

36:46.440 --> 36:47.920
He just finds it and gets in it,

36:47.920 --> 36:52.000
and then he wakes up on a secret base a few days later.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.760
Oh. Well, that's cool.

36:54.760 --> 36:56.960
Couldn't the objective for the player have been

36:56.960 --> 36:58.240
to trigger that explosion

36:58.240 --> 37:00.280
and then get into the pod themselves?

37:00.280 --> 37:02.960
Like, that could have been a really fun mission.

37:02.960 --> 37:05.600
We just got to watch our guy have fun.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.040
Like, what?

37:07.040 --> 37:09.680
A pretty standard rule of games is that if something cool

37:09.680 --> 37:12.760
happens in the story, the player should get to do it.

37:12.760 --> 37:14.720
Warren Spector, the director of Deus Ex,

37:14.720 --> 37:17.400
did a post-mortem on the game at GDC a few years back

37:17.400 --> 37:20.400
and somewhat jokingly listed the ten commandments he had

37:20.400 --> 37:21.640
when he was developing the game,

37:21.640 --> 37:24.520
and one of them was to let players do the cool stuff.

37:24.560 --> 37:26.240
If something is cool,

37:26.240 --> 37:28.960
don't even think about letting an NPC do it.

37:28.960 --> 37:30.440
Players do the cool stuff.

37:30.440 --> 37:33.200
NPCs watch the player do the cool stuff.

37:33.200 --> 37:35.280
I like to describe the first Deus Ex

37:35.280 --> 37:37.360
as surprisingly linear.

37:37.360 --> 37:39.200
Since the player is always the one

37:39.200 --> 37:41.600
doing the important things with no cut scenes

37:41.600 --> 37:44.960
doing it for them, you always feel like the driving force

37:44.960 --> 37:47.160
of the story even though technically you're just

37:47.160 --> 37:49.040
completing an objective someone gave you.

37:49.040 --> 37:51.240
So when all the most pivotal moments in the game

37:51.240 --> 37:54.200
consist of Adam doing the cool stuff while you watch,

37:54.200 --> 37:56.240
which occasionally pauses to ask you

37:56.240 --> 37:57.880
if you'd like to do something else

37:57.880 --> 37:59.400
before forcing you anyway,

37:59.400 --> 38:01.680
you start to feel like a non-player character.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.520
In the game that you're playing,

38:03.520 --> 38:05.320
some of Human Revolution's potentially

38:05.320 --> 38:07.200
best playable moments take the form

38:07.200 --> 38:09.920
of heavily compressed 720p video files.

38:09.920 --> 38:12.320
After making his way to the CEO of the corporation

38:12.320 --> 38:14.960
that might have murdered his co-workers and loved ones,

38:14.960 --> 38:16.960
a cut scene plays where she tries to shoot him

38:16.960 --> 38:17.960
and he disarms her.

38:17.960 --> 38:18.960
Then there's some back and forth,

38:18.960 --> 38:21.520
and a few seconds later, he turns his back on her

38:21.520 --> 38:23.280
and gives her the opportunity to trick him

38:23.280 --> 38:24.400
and lock him out of the room

38:24.400 --> 38:26.120
and send, like, 12 guys after him.

38:26.120 --> 38:29.240
Men never fail to underestimate women.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.400
Oh-ho-ho-ho! Gender!

38:31.400 --> 38:34.040
You spend hours getting to the executive suite

38:34.040 --> 38:35.080
of this corporation.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.560
You put in all this work,

38:36.560 --> 38:39.240
and then cut scene Jensen just...oops.

38:39.240 --> 38:42.000
Situations where the player has no chance to react,

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
uh, in the Deus Ex world are bad.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.520
Shit!

38:46.520 --> 38:48.840
You can't have contrived developments like this

38:48.840 --> 38:51.080
without seriously affecting the player's sense

38:51.080 --> 38:53.040
they have any say in the story.

38:53.040 --> 38:55.920
This segment is especially easy to recognize as a problem

38:55.920 --> 38:58.800
because it has a beat-for-beat equivalent in Deus Ex 1,

38:58.800 --> 39:01.360
meaning we can directly compare the two.

39:01.360 --> 39:04.880
When JC Denton goes after his game's female CEO

39:04.880 --> 39:06.800
of a large Chinese biotech corporation

39:06.800 --> 39:09.040
which seems to be part of the conspiracy,

39:09.040 --> 39:10.720
wow, they just copied that, didn't they?

39:10.720 --> 39:12.080
The character welcomes you in

39:12.080 --> 39:14.160
and tells you a fairly compelling story

39:14.160 --> 39:15.680
about being friends with your brother

39:15.680 --> 39:18.320
and which faction is responsible for the current problems.

39:18.320 --> 39:20.520
You have to figure out what to do next

39:20.520 --> 39:21.560
with that information.

39:21.600 --> 39:23.600
If you believe her and follow her objective,

39:23.600 --> 39:25.720
she goes into hiding and the job she gives you

39:25.720 --> 39:28.200
turns out to be basically a trap to kill you.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.520
Yeah, breaking into a Hong Kong police station

39:30.520 --> 39:32.680
looking for evidence they supposedly covered up.

39:32.680 --> 39:34.840
That's not a recipe for getting exploded.

39:34.840 --> 39:37.960
The player gets to actively decide whether to trust her.

39:37.960 --> 39:40.120
If they did, they have to have a lightsaber fight with her

39:40.120 --> 39:42.840
when they run into her again because this game is so cool.

39:42.840 --> 39:44.320
And she died.

39:44.320 --> 39:45.840
Ah!

39:45.840 --> 39:47.920
Or they can snoop around some more in her apartment

39:47.920 --> 39:50.400
and find the entire secret base in her home.

39:50.400 --> 39:53.840
Or they can just, like, shoot her, like, right away

39:53.840 --> 39:55.280
or snipe her from another building

39:55.280 --> 39:56.360
without ever talking to her.

39:56.360 --> 39:57.880
Throw a bomb through her window.

39:57.880 --> 40:00.200
I just want to observe for a second

40:00.200 --> 40:01.680
that in the original Deus Ex,

40:01.680 --> 40:04.000
breaking into a police station is a trap

40:04.000 --> 40:06.080
to try to kill you that was meant to sound

40:06.080 --> 40:08.480
so ridiculous you realize you're being tricked

40:08.480 --> 40:10.200
and choose to do something else,

40:10.200 --> 40:13.160
but in Human Revolution, it's the only option you have

40:13.160 --> 40:16.400
to progress the story and you cannot say no.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.040
Players being able to make choices

40:18.040 --> 40:20.200
and express themselves would get in the way

40:20.200 --> 40:21.960
of the amazing movie the creators

40:21.960 --> 40:23.000
wished they were making.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.680
Spoilers, they want this character

40:24.680 --> 40:26.120
to be the final boss,

40:26.120 --> 40:28.840
so you have no choice but to sit and watch Adam

40:28.840 --> 40:30.760
delay the plot by ten more hours.

40:30.760 --> 40:32.800
This problem bleeds into the gameplay.

40:32.800 --> 40:34.520
While there's often a degree of choice

40:34.520 --> 40:35.720
in how you solve problems,

40:35.720 --> 40:38.040
the consequences of your choices are meaningless

40:38.040 --> 40:40.400
because the story wasn't designed to account for them.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.840
You can recover the neural hub from the police station

40:42.840 --> 40:45.360
by, well, annihilating it.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.400
You don't have to bother with talking your way in

40:47.400 --> 40:50.400
by absolving a cop of the guilt of the child he killed

40:50.400 --> 40:52.160
or sneaking in via the side entrance

40:52.160 --> 40:53.520
or the roof or the sewers.

40:53.520 --> 40:55.560
You can also go in guns blazing.

40:55.560 --> 40:57.480
Make a real hog roast of a building

40:57.480 --> 41:00.520
full of human beings and the cops interrogating them too.

41:00.520 --> 41:03.400
This is a refreshing New Vegas-esque level

41:03.400 --> 41:06.280
of freedom to be given in how to deal with a situation.

41:06.280 --> 41:09.320
100% coolest level in the game in terms of player freedom.

41:09.320 --> 41:11.200
I mean, look how many cops you can kill.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.000
How could it possibly be a bad level?

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
You'll see!

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
♪ ♪

41:18.000 --> 41:20.800
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

What the fuck is this?

41:24.000 --> 41:25.160
What, were they guarding this vent?

41:25.160 --> 41:27.040
The problem with this level is the effect

41:27.040 --> 41:30.040
these choices have or rather should have.

41:30.040 --> 41:31.960
Like, this would be a big deal, right?

41:31.960 --> 41:35.200
We were just caught on camera killing a lot of people.

41:35.200 --> 41:37.200
This is one of the top ten mass shootings

41:37.200 --> 41:38.920
in America this week.

41:38.920 --> 41:40.560
Our face should be on the news.

41:40.560 --> 41:41.640
We'd be a wanted man.

41:41.640 --> 41:43.560
Sarif Industries would have to fire us

41:43.560 --> 41:46.360
and issue a public apology for giving us both the arms

41:46.360 --> 41:48.160
and the arms to do it with.

41:48.160 --> 41:50.480
The debate on if augmentations should be legal

41:50.480 --> 41:51.480
would shift a bit.

41:51.480 --> 41:53.520
I'm not an expert on video game storytelling

41:53.520 --> 41:56.980
but something should happen as a result of this, right?

41:56.980 --> 41:59.440
Boss, I got the neural hub.

41:59.440 --> 42:01.740
What happens is nothing.

42:01.740 --> 42:02.860
Everything's fine.

42:02.860 --> 42:04.520
This never comes up.

42:04.520 --> 42:06.320
You come back to Detroit later in the game

42:06.320 --> 42:07.940
and there's no wanted posters.

42:07.940 --> 42:10.200
The cops are friendly. Nothing has happened.

42:10.200 --> 42:12.800
But then what if you learned to like the taste of bacon

42:12.800 --> 42:13.800
and keep going?

42:13.800 --> 42:16.000
What if you continue to fight cops in the street,

42:16.000 --> 42:18.420
blow up their mechs, snipe them, explode them,

42:18.420 --> 42:21.040
just fucking go to town on an entire police force?

42:21.040 --> 42:22.620
You want to know what happens then?

42:22.620 --> 42:25.120
When you get done with a quest in a convention center,

42:25.120 --> 42:27.760
on your way out, a cop approaches you

42:27.760 --> 42:30.540
with a side quest to help the police.

42:30.540 --> 42:32.920
Adam, I need you to trust me on this.

42:32.920 --> 42:34.660
You've got to help me find Jacob.

42:34.660 --> 42:37.300
They need help stopping a terrorist who hates cops.

42:37.300 --> 42:39.000
No, they're talking about someone else.

42:39.020 --> 42:40.060
You get offered this quest

42:40.060 --> 42:41.560
when you leave the convention center

42:41.560 --> 42:43.260
even if you have killed every cop

42:43.260 --> 42:45.060
you've ever seen so far in the game.

42:45.060 --> 42:47.480
They're really short-staffed because of the riots

42:47.480 --> 42:49.940
which is why they need outside help from an ex-cop.

42:49.940 --> 42:52.700
The fact Adam is a big reason why they're short-staffed

42:52.700 --> 42:54.440
doesn't cost him the job apparently.

42:54.440 --> 42:55.900
Just think about that.

42:55.900 --> 42:58.240
You can do an actual mass murder

42:58.240 --> 43:00.360
and get deputized by the survivors

43:00.360 --> 43:03.580
to catch a psychopath with a fraction of your body count.

43:03.580 --> 43:06.080
The game feels almost embarrassed about it too

43:06.080 --> 43:08.380
since accounting for how each player dealt

43:08.380 --> 43:10.920
with the police station would have required a lot of work.

43:10.920 --> 43:12.640
On your second visit to Detroit,

43:12.640 --> 43:14.420
the police station is completely closed

43:14.420 --> 43:15.720
and you can't even go in.

43:15.720 --> 43:17.300
There's no two ways around it.

43:17.300 --> 43:18.560
This is cheating.

43:18.560 --> 43:20.520
They're dodging the responsibility

43:20.520 --> 43:23.260
of doing anything with the choices they gave the player.

43:23.260 --> 43:25.320
The best you get is if you do tenderize

43:25.320 --> 43:27.900
the Gammon Warehouse, a newspaper in the next level

43:27.900 --> 43:30.660
says, massacre at police station or something.

43:30.660 --> 43:32.520
This newspaper is so easy to miss,

43:32.520 --> 43:35.080
I didn't get any footage of it during this playthrough.

43:35.080 --> 43:38.000
So if you blink, you miss the consequences

43:38.000 --> 43:40.900
of going to war with the Detroit PD.

43:40.900 --> 43:43.960
The effects of your choices fade away once you make them.

43:43.960 --> 43:45.840
Look, nature is healing.

43:45.840 --> 43:48.000
The cops are right back patrolling the streets

43:48.000 --> 43:49.540
I killed their buddies in.

43:49.540 --> 43:51.920
You see those guns on the ground?

43:51.920 --> 43:54.420
Those are the guns the guys I killed on my way in

43:54.420 --> 43:55.840
dropped when I murdered them.

43:55.840 --> 43:57.380
The game treats the player's choices

43:57.380 --> 43:59.480
about violence extremely weirdly,

43:59.480 --> 44:02.300
forgiving you for even the most extreme acts of terror...

44:02.300 --> 44:05.940
-...but also making sure

44:05.960 --> 44:09.180
you can't play the game truly peacefully either.

44:09.180 --> 44:11.880
I mean, let me just read you one of the game's achievements.

44:11.880 --> 44:13.600
Ahem, pacifist.

44:13.600 --> 44:15.800
Complete Deus Ex Human Revolution

44:15.800 --> 44:19.680
without anyone dying by your hand.

44:19.680 --> 44:21.320
Boss fights do not count.

44:22.220 --> 44:29.220
-♪♪

44:29.220 --> 44:34.220
-♪♪

44:34.220 --> 44:39.220
-♪♪

44:39.220 --> 44:44.220
-♪♪

44:44.220 --> 44:49.220
-♪♪

44:49.220 --> 44:54.220
-♪♪

44:54.220 --> 44:59.220
-♪♪

44:59.220 --> 45:04.220
-♪♪

45:04.220 --> 45:09.220
-♪♪

45:09.220 --> 45:10.520
Now, it might just be me,

45:10.520 --> 45:12.520
but the standards for pacifism have really sli...

45:12.520 --> 45:14.020
Wait, that guy's still alive. Get him!

45:14.020 --> 45:16.020
-♪♪

45:16.020 --> 45:18.020
It's important to stress here that Deus Ex

45:18.020 --> 45:20.200
never did anything like this.

45:20.200 --> 45:22.400
Technically speaking, it only had cut scenes

45:22.400 --> 45:23.660
when you got into a plane

45:23.660 --> 45:25.320
and were traveling to the next level

45:25.320 --> 45:26.780
and I guess the endings too.

45:26.780 --> 45:29.280
Everything else was either gameplay or dialogue.

45:29.280 --> 45:32.660
At no point does JC Denton do something of his own accord.

45:32.660 --> 45:34.000
He's the player's avatar.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.280
He's meant to be an expression of your choices.

45:36.280 --> 45:38.160
Meanwhile, no matter how peaceful

45:38.160 --> 45:39.700
you make Adam Jensen behave,

45:39.700 --> 45:41.380
there's still going to be a cut scene

45:41.400 --> 45:43.400
where he tries to shoot a woman in the chest.

45:43.400 --> 45:45.780
-♪♪

45:45.780 --> 45:46.780
Pacifist.

45:46.780 --> 45:48.040
There's a bit of a disconnect here

45:48.040 --> 45:49.740
in terms of how much control the player has

45:49.740 --> 45:50.740
is what I'm saying.

45:50.740 --> 45:51.740
It's always insulting

45:51.740 --> 45:52.920
to not have a choice in something

45:52.920 --> 45:55.340
or be congratulated for not doing something

45:55.340 --> 45:57.080
that you literally have to do,

45:57.080 --> 45:59.220
but what's even worse is when a game tells you

45:59.220 --> 46:00.800
you're going to be given a choice

46:00.800 --> 46:02.260
and then just forgets.

46:02.260 --> 46:04.060
There's one incredibly strange part

46:04.060 --> 46:06.060
where the second boss character, Rihanna,

46:06.060 --> 46:07.520
is heavily injured from the fight

46:07.520 --> 46:09.520
and Jensen is asked if he will help her.

46:09.540 --> 46:11.540
-"Her life signs are fading.

46:11.540 --> 46:14.540
Will you save her?"

46:14.540 --> 46:15.660
-"I'll think about it."

46:15.660 --> 46:17.760
But then she just quietly dies

46:17.760 --> 46:20.000
and is a corpse once the cut scene is over.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.300
There is a dog barking.

46:22.300 --> 46:24.100
Apparently in an early draft of the game,

46:24.100 --> 46:26.260
the player got to decide if they killed bosses

46:26.260 --> 46:28.680
after defeating them and then they decided not to

46:28.680 --> 46:31.440
or weren't able to add this mechanic for whatever reason.

46:31.440 --> 46:35.320
-"The script kind of implies that she's not dead yet

46:35.320 --> 46:37.020
and are you going to save her?

46:37.020 --> 46:41.120
Initially, we had wanted to have the, um,

46:41.120 --> 46:45.160
the final blow for the bosses was up to the player

46:45.160 --> 46:47.540
to decide whether he was going to do it or not

46:47.540 --> 46:48.660
and when the cut scene's over,

46:48.660 --> 46:51.200
the player could end up, uh, killing her,

46:51.200 --> 46:54.160
but in truth, we kind of lost that

46:54.160 --> 46:56.800
in the process of our production

46:56.800 --> 46:58.580
and we never did change the lines."

46:58.580 --> 47:00.180
After the next boss fight, the guy's like,

47:00.180 --> 47:02.300
ugh, finish it because he's a badass.

47:02.300 --> 47:03.260
That's his character, right?

47:03.260 --> 47:04.720
And Jensen's like, not until you tell me

47:04.720 --> 47:06.340
what I need to know and then he dies anyway

47:06.340 --> 47:07.580
like a second later.

47:07.580 --> 47:10.080
You can smell the point in the cut scene

47:10.080 --> 47:12.080
where a moral choice would have gone

47:12.080 --> 47:14.340
and then, well, they kind of lost that

47:14.340 --> 47:16.460
in the process of their production.

47:16.460 --> 47:19.260
I think that's a diplomatic way of saying

47:19.260 --> 47:21.640
they didn't finish the game.

47:21.640 --> 47:23.600
This lack of control over the story

47:23.600 --> 47:25.680
to the extent players are being told

47:25.680 --> 47:27.400
they're going to get some choices

47:27.400 --> 47:28.900
which they are then not given

47:28.900 --> 47:30.780
makes the story start to feel flat

47:30.780 --> 47:32.980
and like you're not really taking part in it.

47:32.980 --> 47:35.780
Now to be clear, the game isn't completely devoid

47:35.800 --> 47:37.440
of branching story choices.

47:37.440 --> 47:39.480
At one point near the end, you get shot down

47:39.480 --> 47:41.140
and if you don't kill a couple guys,

47:41.140 --> 47:42.320
the pilot is killed.

47:42.320 --> 47:44.180
It's intended as a reference to the original

47:44.180 --> 47:45.900
where your pilot can also die,

47:45.900 --> 47:47.740
but in Deus Ex, it's an excuse

47:47.740 --> 47:49.900
for investigation and subterfuge.

47:49.900 --> 47:52.120
You have to find the corpse of a mechanic

47:52.120 --> 47:53.540
and wonder what's up with that.

47:53.540 --> 47:56.120
Notice the weird guy also dressed as a mechanic?

47:56.120 --> 47:57.460
I fixed her right up for you.

47:57.460 --> 47:59.380
And kill him or report him to his boss.

47:59.380 --> 48:00.880
That mechanic was an imposter.

48:00.880 --> 48:02.840
Oh, my God, JC, a bomb.

48:02.840 --> 48:03.840
A bomb.

48:03.860 --> 48:05.780
You can completely miss all of this

48:05.780 --> 48:06.980
if you're not paying attention,

48:06.980 --> 48:08.160
and if you do miss it,

48:08.160 --> 48:10.540
hours and hours later on the last level,

48:10.540 --> 48:12.320
your pilot's copter explodes

48:12.320 --> 48:13.920
and you don't really know why.

48:13.920 --> 48:16.200
This is part of the subtle beauty of the original.

48:16.200 --> 48:17.460
The game doesn't make it clear

48:17.460 --> 48:19.460
how much control you have sometimes,

48:19.460 --> 48:20.760
so when this happens,

48:20.760 --> 48:22.960
you get to wonder if you could have saved him.

48:22.960 --> 48:25.460
There's tons of minor ways the story can change

48:25.460 --> 48:27.380
that some players don't even know about

48:27.380 --> 48:29.980
and only find out about on forums years later.

48:29.980 --> 48:31.480
This isn't quite as special

48:31.480 --> 48:33.020
when it's shoot all of these guys

48:33.040 --> 48:34.360
or your pilot dies now.

48:34.360 --> 48:35.780
Also, the way the game accounts

48:35.780 --> 48:37.120
for her death just sucks.

48:37.120 --> 48:39.540
If you save her, she later heroically flies in

48:39.540 --> 48:40.540
to knock out some guys

48:40.540 --> 48:42.200
and save the scientists you rescued,

48:42.200 --> 48:44.000
but if she dies, obviously this means

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
she doesn't turn up,

48:45.000 --> 48:46.880
so there's some serious story implications

48:46.880 --> 48:48.220
for the survival of these scientists.

48:48.220 --> 48:50.180
Just kidding, an aircraft is on the landing pad now

48:50.180 --> 48:52.180
for no reason, and they fly it out.

48:52.180 --> 48:53.180
What?

48:53.180 --> 48:54.920
They could have made Farida Malek's death

48:54.920 --> 48:56.340
have interesting consequences,

48:56.340 --> 48:58.140
and they just don't.

48:58.140 --> 48:59.340
They just don't.

48:59.340 --> 49:01.640
There is one really good story choice

49:01.640 --> 49:02.640
in the game, though.

49:02.680 --> 49:04.520
See you soon, Mr. Jensen.

49:04.520 --> 49:06.180
Ooh.

49:06.180 --> 49:08.360
Partway through, you start having minor glitches,

49:08.360 --> 49:09.940
and it becomes clear it's affecting

49:09.940 --> 49:11.440
other augmented people too.

49:11.440 --> 49:13.020
You all have them at once even.

49:13.020 --> 49:15.020
Ooh.

49:15.020 --> 49:16.020
I like how it's done too,

49:16.020 --> 49:18.060
these minor mutual freak outs

49:18.060 --> 49:20.280
where everyone gets injured and confused.

49:20.280 --> 49:22.320
This is some pretty neat storytelling actually.

49:22.320 --> 49:24.780
Uh, well, it's still pretty good.

49:24.780 --> 49:26.280
Anyway, you get a side objective

49:26.280 --> 49:28.540
to replace the defective chip causing this.

49:28.540 --> 49:30.120
If you go to a clinic, the game goes,

49:30.120 --> 49:31.460
are you sure you want to do this?

49:31.480 --> 49:33.900
As if to say, hey, you're making a big choice here,

49:33.900 --> 49:35.660
and for once, you are.

49:35.660 --> 49:37.740
If you get the replacement then in a later level

49:37.740 --> 49:38.740
before a boss fight,

49:38.740 --> 49:40.280
the lady from before flips a switch

49:40.280 --> 49:41.320
and you have to fight the boss

49:41.320 --> 49:42.740
with your screen all fuzzy.

49:42.740 --> 49:45.120
Wow, my choices affected the story.

49:45.120 --> 49:47.960
If you think this is the smartest thing in the game,

49:47.960 --> 49:50.660
I'm very sorry to tell you that you are correct.

49:50.660 --> 49:52.300
It is. There's another little way

49:52.300 --> 49:54.040
the plot can kind of branch actually.

49:54.040 --> 49:55.720
If you wait around at your HQ

49:55.720 --> 49:57.180
before going to their first mission,

49:57.180 --> 49:59.300
your boss yells at you to get to the helipad.

49:59.300 --> 50:00.800
Helipad. And eventually,

50:00.820 --> 50:02.240
the hostages you could have saved

50:02.240 --> 50:04.440
in that mission are dead before you get there.

50:04.440 --> 50:06.360
Christ, Adam, while you were strolling around

50:06.360 --> 50:08.620
the offices, the situation got worse.

50:08.620 --> 50:09.900
Wait a second, though.

50:09.900 --> 50:12.400
The game just dropped me in a new level

50:12.400 --> 50:13.820
full of people to talk to

50:13.820 --> 50:15.920
and then yelled at me to ignore all of it

50:15.920 --> 50:17.920
to get to the mission as fast as I can?

50:17.920 --> 50:19.620
Yeah, I really have the sense that time

50:19.620 --> 50:21.620
is of the essence in human revolution.

50:22.620 --> 50:23.620
Oh my God.

50:23.620 --> 50:25.080
Did you ever think about how, like,

50:25.080 --> 50:27.500
the myth of Icarus is about transhumanism?

50:27.500 --> 50:29.120
Like, with the wings?

50:29.120 --> 50:30.540
No, I didn't.

50:30.540 --> 50:33.800
A-Adam, that's... that's really stupid.

50:33.800 --> 50:36.180
You see? This is why we broke up.

50:36.180 --> 50:38.680
I still can't believe you don't like Ghost in the Shell.

50:38.680 --> 50:41.100
Oh my God, are you guys talking about Ghost in the Shell?

50:41.100 --> 50:44.220
That is one of the most important movies ever made.

50:44.220 --> 50:45.640
I mean, it's a good movie.

50:45.640 --> 50:46.640
It's a good movie.

50:46.640 --> 50:47.640
It's a good movie.

50:47.640 --> 50:48.640
It's a good movie.

50:48.640 --> 50:49.640
It's a good movie.

50:49.640 --> 50:50.640
It's a good movie.

50:50.660 --> 50:51.840
It's one of the best movies ever made.

50:51.840 --> 50:53.340
I cannot wait to see it.

50:53.340 --> 50:56.000
This is a game that just made you unskippably

50:56.000 --> 50:58.880
go on a walking tour of a floor of this building.

50:58.880 --> 51:00.840
They took their sweet fucking time.

51:00.840 --> 51:01.840
Why can't I?

51:01.840 --> 51:04.140
I mean, the guy's name is Bateau.

51:04.140 --> 51:06.260
The French word for boat.

51:06.260 --> 51:08.640
And he owns a boat?

51:08.640 --> 51:10.320
Ah, come on.

51:10.320 --> 51:11.820
We don't know he owns the boat.

51:11.820 --> 51:13.140
That's not in the wiki.

51:13.140 --> 51:15.280
This game does not get to say,

51:15.280 --> 51:16.560
hey, we're on the clock here

51:16.560 --> 51:19.280
after slapping you in the face with this opening.

51:19.300 --> 51:21.680
Fuck you if you think this is clever.

51:21.680 --> 51:24.060
Sorry. No, that's a joke.

51:24.060 --> 51:25.480
This is pretty clever,

51:25.480 --> 51:27.760
but for that to be one of the few times

51:27.760 --> 51:29.680
the story is affected by your choices

51:29.680 --> 51:30.980
is just insulting.

51:30.980 --> 51:32.600
I think the worst thing about all this

51:32.600 --> 51:34.480
is how promising it manages to be

51:34.480 --> 51:36.700
about its characters and choices at times.

51:36.700 --> 51:39.160
There's a blueprint in here for a fantastic story

51:39.160 --> 51:41.620
with all kinds of little choices like this one.

51:41.620 --> 51:43.900
The couple you can save at the manufacturing plant

51:43.900 --> 51:45.200
are a great example too,

51:45.200 --> 51:48.000
but I especially like the way Zeke Sanders is used.

51:48.040 --> 51:49.500
Not because the pre-rendered cutscene

51:49.500 --> 51:51.340
is just that cool and badass,

51:51.340 --> 51:53.460
but because eventually the cutscene ends

51:53.460 --> 51:55.720
and you get to be involved in the story.

51:55.720 --> 51:57.720
If you knock him out, he's in the police station

51:57.720 --> 51:59.560
talking about how he'll be out soon anyway

51:59.560 --> 52:01.020
because he has powerful friends.

52:01.020 --> 52:02.180
I won't be here long.

52:02.180 --> 52:03.880
If you killed him, he's in the morgue

52:03.880 --> 52:06.100
next to the guy whose neural hub you need.

52:06.100 --> 52:08.180
If you let him go, he later contacts you

52:08.180 --> 52:09.900
and gives you some information in return,

52:09.900 --> 52:11.760
like he feels like he owes you one.

52:11.760 --> 52:13.180
My debt is paid.

52:13.180 --> 52:15.600
It's really neat how different your relationship

52:15.620 --> 52:18.420
with this one guy can get based on what you did.

52:18.420 --> 52:20.600
Way later in the game, if he survived all this,

52:20.600 --> 52:22.720
he's a hostile NPC during the mission

52:22.720 --> 52:25.260
to go after a guy who, it turns out, surprise twist,

52:25.260 --> 52:27.520
is actually his brother, Sanders.

52:27.520 --> 52:28.720
Sanderses?

52:28.720 --> 52:30.400
Ezekiel's impact on the story

52:30.400 --> 52:32.060
is minimal after the first encounter.

52:32.060 --> 52:33.440
He could die right here

52:33.440 --> 52:35.360
so they can't make him too important,

52:35.360 --> 52:37.240
but he's what you really want to see

52:37.240 --> 52:38.360
from a game like this.

52:38.360 --> 52:40.400
Characters who react to your choices

52:40.400 --> 52:43.540
and feel like their own pieces of a larger world.

52:43.560 --> 52:46.360
I hate to say it, but very few other characters

52:46.360 --> 52:48.020
are as well thought out as this.

52:48.020 --> 52:49.560
Take his brother I just mentioned.

52:49.560 --> 52:51.740
Isaiah Sandoval is a high-ranking member

52:51.740 --> 52:53.980
of a different, non-terrorist-y

52:53.980 --> 52:55.620
anti-augmentation group.

52:55.620 --> 52:56.900
You meet him a few levels in

52:56.900 --> 52:59.000
and you can argue with him about augmentations,

52:59.000 --> 53:00.960
although none of it affects the story at all.

53:00.960 --> 53:02.320
It's just optional dialogue.

53:02.320 --> 53:04.000
Later, he shows up in a recording

53:04.000 --> 53:05.880
interacting with the guys who shot you

53:05.880 --> 53:08.300
and killed slash kidnapped your friends.

53:08.300 --> 53:09.300
I know this guy.

53:09.300 --> 53:10.420
When you get to Sandoval,

53:10.420 --> 53:13.220
he tells you what he knows then tries to shoot you,

53:13.240 --> 53:15.280
but if you found out his location

53:15.280 --> 53:18.020
by publicly implicating him in the conspiracy

53:18.020 --> 53:19.280
in front of his boss,

53:19.280 --> 53:21.860
his boss basically pins everything on him,

53:21.860 --> 53:23.540
so instead, once you get here,

53:23.540 --> 53:25.960
he's distraught and decides to kill himself

53:25.960 --> 53:27.420
as penance for his crimes,

53:27.420 --> 53:29.580
which he feels genuine guilt over.

53:29.580 --> 53:31.620
You get the chance to try to talk him down

53:31.620 --> 53:34.460
over the course of a deeply engaging conversation,

53:34.460 --> 53:35.960
and for a few minutes,

53:35.960 --> 53:39.000
everything about this game really works.

53:39.000 --> 53:42.420
Sandoval feels like a character with a real inner life

53:42.460 --> 53:44.540
who we have to speak to like a person,

53:44.540 --> 53:46.340
and we're only having this conversation

53:46.340 --> 53:48.000
in the first place because of the effects

53:48.000 --> 53:49.500
of another choice we made.

53:49.500 --> 53:52.180
This is a perfectly sculpted piece

53:52.180 --> 53:53.640
of a really good game.

53:53.640 --> 53:54.960
It's one of the reasons why this game

53:54.960 --> 53:57.300
is worth talking about because it's disheartening

53:57.300 --> 54:00.260
that the game is missing the rest of the pieces.

54:00.260 --> 54:02.060
Firstly, this character isn't someone

54:02.060 --> 54:04.020
you got to deal with in any particularly

54:04.020 --> 54:05.640
meaningful way beforehand.

54:05.640 --> 54:09.060
You met him once for five seconds half a game ago.

54:09.060 --> 54:10.860
Instead of being the culmination

54:10.880 --> 54:13.100
of a relationship between two characters,

54:13.100 --> 54:15.020
it's just a really resonant moment

54:15.020 --> 54:17.480
in the middle of a story that's become a bit of a mess

54:17.480 --> 54:19.520
which you had little to no say in,

54:19.520 --> 54:22.020
and worse, now the game is done with him,

54:22.020 --> 54:25.520
he instantly exits the story and is never seen again.

54:25.520 --> 54:27.820
Sandoval already told you everything you need to know

54:27.820 --> 54:29.820
in the cut scene before this standoff,

54:29.820 --> 54:32.740
so if you talk him down or if he kills himself

54:32.740 --> 54:35.160
or if you talk him down and then kill him for fun

54:35.160 --> 54:37.660
or if none of this happened and this room was just a fight...

54:37.660 --> 54:38.660
Ow.

54:38.660 --> 54:40.080
It doesn't change anything.

54:40.100 --> 54:41.940
The story is not affected in any way

54:41.940 --> 54:43.400
by any of these outcomes.

54:43.400 --> 54:44.680
This character's survival,

54:44.680 --> 54:46.680
especially considering you can convince him

54:46.680 --> 54:48.520
to turn on the other conspirators

54:48.520 --> 54:49.740
and come out with the truth,

54:49.740 --> 54:52.160
should have interesting plot implications.

54:52.160 --> 54:54.160
His death or survival should have had an impact

54:54.160 --> 54:55.360
on what sort of ending you get.

54:55.360 --> 54:56.360
Oh, God, don't get me started.

54:56.360 --> 54:58.280
But once you're done, he just sits there.

54:58.280 --> 55:00.960
His part in the story is completed now.

55:00.960 --> 55:03.160
You don't need to wait with me, Mr. Jensen.

55:03.160 --> 55:05.740
I will not resist my fate when it arrives.

55:05.740 --> 55:06.740
Yeah, get out of here.

55:06.740 --> 55:08.780
I need to sit here for a week

55:08.780 --> 55:09.780
so I don't have a chance

55:09.780 --> 55:11.620
to introduce consequences to the plot.

55:11.620 --> 55:13.320
It's just kind of weird that you introduce

55:13.320 --> 55:14.780
some of these characters, you interact with them

55:14.780 --> 55:17.280
a little bit, and then you never hear from him again.

55:17.280 --> 55:18.400
What happened to that guy?

55:18.400 --> 55:20.940
It's so easy to imagine how much better

55:20.940 --> 55:23.780
the game could have handled its characters and choices.

55:23.780 --> 55:26.540
Like, what if your attitude towards augmentations

55:26.540 --> 55:29.360
in the previous meeting affected how Sandoval treated you

55:29.360 --> 55:30.360
once you found him?

55:30.360 --> 55:31.860
Like, if you seemed amenable

55:31.860 --> 55:33.660
to anti-augmentation arguments,

55:33.660 --> 55:35.660
he saw you as a potential friend here

55:35.660 --> 55:37.480
and trusted you with the information

55:37.480 --> 55:39.600
because he figured you'd do the right thing with it?

55:39.600 --> 55:42.560
What if, just a thought, how you treated his brother

55:42.560 --> 55:44.560
the last three times you ran into him

55:44.560 --> 55:46.180
affected his feelings about you?

55:46.180 --> 55:49.100
The fact you literally shot his brother to death

55:49.100 --> 55:52.060
or let him go during an armed standoff

55:52.060 --> 55:54.020
somehow never comes up.

55:54.020 --> 55:55.720
What if turning him against his boss

55:55.720 --> 55:58.280
had some really cool or meaningful consequence

55:58.280 --> 56:00.680
so the player feels like they really did something?

56:00.680 --> 56:02.600
Like, I'm not saying the story has to branch

56:02.600 --> 56:05.100
in some huge way, but do something.

56:05.100 --> 56:07.320
Maybe he gives you the key to his gun cabinet

56:07.320 --> 56:08.700
and it's full of weapon upgrades

56:08.700 --> 56:10.580
or those grenades he apparently had on him.

56:10.580 --> 56:12.160
Literally the only difference

56:12.160 --> 56:14.480
is a newspaper says something different

56:14.480 --> 56:16.480
and I guess you get more experience points

56:16.480 --> 56:17.700
for talking him down.

56:17.700 --> 56:20.780
This is especially weird because Deus Ex had a knack

56:20.780 --> 56:23.440
for remembering things you did and having them come up later.

56:23.440 --> 56:26.240
The first level of this game also had a hostage to save,

56:26.240 --> 56:28.660
one of many direct parallels between the games,

56:28.660 --> 56:30.660
and whether you bothered to save him or not

56:30.660 --> 56:33.240
affects how he feels about you for the rest of the game.

56:33.240 --> 56:35.160
I have seen that he knows the procedure

56:35.160 --> 56:36.580
of a good offensive.

56:36.620 --> 56:38.660
I will not forget a favor.

56:38.660 --> 56:40.340
Even when he becomes a boss fight,

56:40.340 --> 56:42.620
he'll still have a grudging respect for you.

56:42.620 --> 56:45.620
I regret that only once we worked together.

56:45.620 --> 56:47.500
You came all the way to Paris to tell me that?

56:47.500 --> 56:49.300
You can walk in on a guy asking a doctor

56:49.300 --> 56:50.920
for maintenance advice and learn he has

56:50.920 --> 56:52.420
the same augmentations as you.

56:52.420 --> 56:55.340
The fact you did this comes up 20 hours later

56:55.340 --> 56:56.340
when you fight him.

56:56.340 --> 56:58.300
If you recall our chat in the break room

56:58.300 --> 57:00.840
at UNATCO, you know that I have

57:00.840 --> 57:03.500
the same augmentation technology as you.

57:03.500 --> 57:05.260
Then this will be a good fight.

57:05.260 --> 57:07.180
All I'm saying is it would have been nice

57:07.180 --> 57:09.400
if Sandoval acknowledged something as important

57:09.400 --> 57:11.640
as whether I killed his brother or not.

57:11.640 --> 57:13.240
That's not too much to ask, is it?

57:13.240 --> 57:14.980
This whole cutscene, I was waiting for him

57:14.980 --> 57:16.940
to say something, but no.

57:16.940 --> 57:20.060
The game cares so little for how this scene works out

57:20.060 --> 57:22.820
that no matter what happens, one second later,

57:22.820 --> 57:24.940
Adam makes an identical phone call.

57:24.940 --> 57:26.320
I see you!

57:26.320 --> 57:27.740
Richard, get this.

57:27.740 --> 57:29.540
The GPLs are still transmitting.

57:29.540 --> 57:31.540
Sandoval switched them to a lower frequency.

57:31.540 --> 57:33.040
Take the gun.

57:33.040 --> 57:34.040
You win.

57:35.260 --> 57:37.460
Richard, get this.

57:37.460 --> 57:38.460
Forgive me.

57:38.460 --> 57:40.180
-$%&!

57:40.180 --> 57:41.500
Richard, get this.

57:41.500 --> 57:42.840
Hey, Richard, a guy just killed himself

57:42.840 --> 57:44.420
right in front of me. Anyway, check this out.

57:44.420 --> 57:47.180
Couldn't you at least have got a few different takes?

57:47.180 --> 57:50.020
Oh, Sandoval, you could have been so cool,

57:50.020 --> 57:52.860
but once I leave this room, you cease to exist.

57:52.860 --> 57:55.600
Good night, sweet prince, and may flights of angels.

57:55.600 --> 57:57.100
Oh, that actually kill. Oh, Jesus.

57:57.100 --> 57:59.100
Getting to make more choices like this

57:59.100 --> 58:01.400
would have vastly improved the experience.

58:01.400 --> 58:03.320
I hate that we didn't get a game

58:03.320 --> 58:04.940
full of stuff like Zeke Sanders,

58:04.960 --> 58:06.840
but after a few hours, it becomes clear

58:06.840 --> 58:08.500
the player is less of a participant

58:08.500 --> 58:11.420
and more a chauffeur, transporting cutscene Jensen

58:11.420 --> 58:13.960
between opportunities to trip over his own dick.

58:13.960 --> 58:16.140
Women never fail to underestimate men.

58:16.140 --> 58:17.800
Oh, ho, ho, ho! Gender!

58:17.800 --> 58:19.900
This is how a cyberpunk game

58:19.900 --> 58:23.360
about our transhumanist future addresses gender.

58:23.360 --> 58:27.480
Men do be shopping for augmentations.

58:27.480 --> 58:29.560
As the story makes it increasingly clear

58:29.560 --> 58:32.560
the person playing it is only tangentially involved,

58:32.560 --> 58:34.520
people stop paying attention.

58:34.520 --> 58:36.240
You don't have any say in what's happening,

58:36.240 --> 58:37.520
so what's the point?

58:37.520 --> 58:39.520
That's cutscene Jensen's problem.

58:39.520 --> 58:41.160
The problem the player has to deal with

58:41.160 --> 58:43.580
is the sweeping and often misguided changes

58:43.580 --> 58:45.120
to the original's gameplay.

58:45.120 --> 58:53.120
♪♪

58:53.120 --> 58:55.540
Watch it. This one's some...

58:55.540 --> 58:57.960
Deus Ex is a tremendously important game

58:57.960 --> 58:59.460
in the history of the medium,

58:59.460 --> 59:02.380
one of, if not the best of all time.

59:02.380 --> 59:04.140
Hold on, let me... there we go.

59:04.140 --> 59:06.220
Many designers on all types of games

59:06.220 --> 59:08.960
cite it as a direct inspiration for their own work,

59:08.960 --> 59:10.920
but it's been over 20 years now.

59:10.920 --> 59:13.300
Is Deus Ex really as good as everyone remembe...

59:13.300 --> 59:15.440
Yes, yes it is. Shut the fuck up.

59:15.440 --> 59:18.220
There's a good reason why there's a decades-old in-joke

59:18.220 --> 59:21.060
that every time you mention it, someone will reinstall it.

59:21.060 --> 59:24.060
In-jokes are what people call memes when they're funny.

59:24.060 --> 59:25.860
It's the ultimate example of a game

59:25.860 --> 59:27.980
that's more than the sum of its parts.

59:27.980 --> 59:29.480
That phrase gets thrown around a lot

59:29.480 --> 59:31.660
by game critics trying to punch up their reviews

59:31.660 --> 59:33.940
with fancy words, but this is the rare time

59:33.960 --> 59:35.340
when it's actually true.

59:35.340 --> 59:37.220
In post-mortems and retrospectives,

59:37.220 --> 59:39.180
Warren Spector is delightfully open

59:39.180 --> 59:41.460
about how right down to the wire,

59:41.460 --> 59:44.460
mere months from release, the game just wasn't fun.

59:44.460 --> 59:47.520
By September 1999, we were done.

59:47.520 --> 59:48.840
Except we weren't.

59:48.840 --> 59:50.400
The game was not good enough.

59:50.400 --> 59:52.300
It wasn't ready to ship.

59:52.300 --> 59:55.520
Deus Ex was made out of so many individual components

59:55.520 --> 59:58.600
that had to not just work well, but work well together,

59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.560
that it was a huge mess right up until it suddenly

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:04.180
became a beautiful web of interlocking systems.

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.180
So we had real people come in and play the game.

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.860
I called that particular milestone

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:11.100
the, wow, these missions suck, milestone.

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:13.780
Uh, we had a lot of work to do.

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:16.700
This is why this game's formula is hard to recreate

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:18.320
and even harder to improve on.

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:21.160
So many moving parts have to work with each other.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:25.040
Even if a change sounds good or even is good in some contexts,

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.000
since every change affects the way

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.700
all the systems relate to each other,

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:31.120
it can still result in a worse game.

01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:33.820
And immersive sims come together very late

01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:35.820
when all of your little game systems and rules

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:37.780
are all working together magically

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:40.120
to produce this amazing experience.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.780
The creators of Human Revolution

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:44.780
made a lot of big changes to these core mechanics.

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:46.700
Lapikus's talk contains a segment

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:48.920
where he summarizes the Human Revolution team's

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.960
collective criticisms of the original.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.800
I'm about to say some negative things

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.760
about the best PC game of all times.

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.220
Now see here, buddy!

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:58.640
Okay, but seriously, it's really good

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:00.640
to take an especially critical look at a game

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:02.500
even if it's as beloved as the original.

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:04.920
You know, if you seriously want to improve on Deus Ex,

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.120
this is how you start.

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:08.700
The issue is what they decided were problems

01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:10.420
and how they fixed them.

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:12.040
The game was designed specifically

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:14.000
for the PS3 and Xbox 360

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.180
with a separate company entirely handling the PC port.

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:19.680
The creators appear to be trying to streamline down

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.220
the Deus experience for console players,

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.840
removing many mechanics they feared wouldn't appeal

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:27.440
to people who don't like complicated RPGs.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:30.140
Lapikus says they didn't dumb it down in his talk,

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:32.140
but I think we get to be the judge of that.

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:33.980
So obviously the first thing we should look at

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:35.820
is the first thing that happens in the game,

01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:37.200
character creation.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.900
Not Human Revolution's character creation,

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:40.580
of course, because, uh, there isn't any.

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:43.820
["Dark Souls"-style music plays in the background.]

01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:45.580
In true RPG fashion,

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:48.040
Deus Ex slaps you in the face with a spreadsheet

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.660
before you can start playing.

01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:50.660
Ow, my brain!

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:51.620
At least the default name

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:52.880
isn't Non this time.

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.380
Everyone calls you JC,

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:56.080
but that's just the character's code name.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.300
You can enter a real name,

01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:59.220
and it comes up in a few places here and there.

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:00.300
You Denton?

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:01.300
Denton's an old code name

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:02.500
from my UNATCO days,

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:03.840
but it seems to have stuck.

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.180
And even though it's a little clunky,

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.300
it's always fun to be making meaningful choices

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:08.480
as soon as you begin.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.140
There's no 45-minute openings

01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:11.860
and tutorials to get through first.

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:13.480
The tutorial's actually a separate thing

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:14.640
you can skip entirely,

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.780
and for the year 2000,

01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:17.240
being able to choose your ethnicity

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:18.240
was pretty cool.

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.060
It was so nice to finally find a game

01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:21.660
that represented my skin type.

01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:23.660
Throughout the game, you acquired more skill points

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:26.040
and could level up more at any time through the menu.

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.360
It's a very rewarding system to engage with,

01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:30.520
but you know, it's a lot of looking at numbers,

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:33.220
thinking, making fun decisions,

01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:34.760
you know, boring nerd stuff.

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:36.260
In Lapicus's critical summary,

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:39.600
he calls Deus Ex a heavy management kind of game.

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:40.980
Oh, no, what if the gamers

01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:42.600
see a character creation screen?

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.600
They might instantly decide the game is bad

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.100
and go back to Gears of War.

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:48.200
We better make it simpler just in case.

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.980
So character creation is out,

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:51.480
but the team were actually very smart

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:52.940
about how they went about this.

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:54.400
They still realized the importance

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:56.440
of getting to make choices about the character

01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:58.660
and that sense of growth and development,

01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:01.000
and they found a way to make that still happen

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.200
because in the first game, you were also developing

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.840
in a much more engaging way at the same time.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.300
Throughout the world, you were finding

01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:08.720
augmentation canisters,

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.720
which provided special, unique upgrades

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.500
to the player's abilities on a completely separate screen

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:14.720
from the skill point one.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.260
So the team made a pretty clever

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.180
streamlining decision and combined

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:20.060
these two systems into one.

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:22.600
Now you do all your upgrading on one menu,

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.100
and instead of acquiring, managing,

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.600
and spending thousands of points,

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.900
you get upgrades by spending praxis points,

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:29.260
which are either found in the world

01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:31.800
or given to you every time you gain enough experience.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.140
If your goal is to simplify character progression,

01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:36.300
this is a really obvious and smart choice.

01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:38.520
It's less complicated and more direct.

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:39.940
You spend a point on a thing,

01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:41.680
and now you can do the thing.

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.600
Whee. A lot of the more boring skills

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:44.520
have been removed.

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.140
Swimming? Get out of here.

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:49.280
Adam doesn't do any swimming in the entire game.

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.240
They streamlined the game so well,

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:52.940
there aren't even any streams,

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:54.980
but overall, I'd say all of this is pretty good.

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:57.280
Well, it's definitely simpler at least,

01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:59.120
but to simplify a mechanic means

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.580
removing something from it,

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:02.280
and that means you risk removing

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.040
what made the thing you're simplifying

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.740
fun in the first place.

01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:07.620
You can always improve on an old design,

01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:10.960
but sometimes it worked that way for a reason

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:13.420
because here's the thing about augmentation canisters.

01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:15.380
You didn't just get to pick an augmentation

01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:16.460
when you found one.

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:19.260
Each canister had two specific abilities in it,

01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:21.140
and you could only choose one of them.

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.420
In any given playthrough,

01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:25.040
you only got up to half the abilities you could have.

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:26.740
You were building a unique character

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:28.160
who couldn't have everything.

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:29.160
In Human Revolution,

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.660
you're just picking them from a list,

01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:33.040
and you can get all of them if you have enough points.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.120
By the end of the game,

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.380
everyone's JC Denton was a little bit different.

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:40.100
Everyone's Adam Jensen is exactly the same.

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:42.520
He just gets there in a slightly different order.

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.220
I want to take a moment to appreciate

01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:46.100
the original game's augmentation system

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:47.760
because while the experience point stuff

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.140
was a turn-off to some people,

01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:51.180
the augs were a thing of beauty.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.620
You see, since each canister

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:54.320
had only two augmentations in it

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.660
and you could only choose one,

01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:58.920
the player was being given an extremely engaging choice.

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:03.120
Hey, do you want to run faster or run silently?

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:05.380
Because it's a choice between just two things,

01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:07.960
it's elegant and clear and hard to get anxious

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.220
about which choice to make.

01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:11.760
You just have to decide which you want more.

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:13.020
It's a binary choice.

01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:15.480
It's literally the simplest kind of choice there is.

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:17.560
When you get a praxis point in Human Revolution,

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:19.020
the game says, great,

01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:21.600
please pick one of 30 things to spend it on

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:23.520
in a huge menu full of sub-menus,

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:25.280
and by the way, you can't get half of them

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:26.980
because you actually needed two points.

01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:28.480
For a huge portion of players,

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:31.160
the very first experience with the augmentation system

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.440
is finding the first point, opening a menu,

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.540
and spending several minutes reading all the things

01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:37.540
they could do with it, realizing they need two

01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:38.540
to get anything good,

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:40.240
and they have to close the menu down again

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.280
and carry on playing until they find another.

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:44.880
Worse, this extreme amount of things to choose from

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.700
causes a kind of decision anxiety

01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:48.200
which never happened in the original

01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:49.800
with its much more simple choices.

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:52.560
You know how tons of people play Human Revolution?

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:54.140
They don't spend their points.

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:55.760
They hoard them until they find a hole

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.600
they need the slow-fall power to get down

01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.100
or a wall they want to punch

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:00.980
or another thing that needs an augmentation

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:03.520
to progress and spend the points right then and there,

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:06.160
so you're not really building a character anymore.

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.400
You're paying a toll once you hit a section

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.980
that needs a certain skill.

01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:11.740
The design of the system is misleading

01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:13.200
about how complicated it is.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:15.280
This clip is of me spending 45 seconds

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.000
looking for an augmentation I wanted.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.260
You know, the one that lets you take down

01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:20.380
two guys at once in physical combat

01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:21.920
using your arms?

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:24.060
Where would that power be?

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:25.680
The arm submenu?

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.020
Correct, it should be there,

01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:29.760
but it's actually here in the back augmentations.

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:32.980
It has a special submenu just to itself for no reason,

01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:34.180
and just to really fuck with you,

01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:36.020
the take down one person augmentation

01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:37.520
is in the arm submenu,

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.600
and you start with this one already unlocked.

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:40.740
Why is this here?

01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:42.020
What are you trying to do to me?

01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:43.020
Ow, my brain!

01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:44.700
Wait, and carrying capacities

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:45.700
in the arm submenu,

01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:46.700
but you're not holding everything

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:47.700
in your arms all day.

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:48.700
You're carrying it.

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:49.700
On your back!

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:50.700
Put it on the back augmentation!

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:52.240
So if the objective was to simplify

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.240
character progression,

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:54.860
I don't think they achieved it nearly

01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:55.860
as well as they'd hoped.

01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:58.360
In practice, or should I say in praxis,

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.240
this system removes the best things

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.660
about the system it's based on

01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:02.960
in the name of a simplicity

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.620
that wasn't actually achieved.

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:06.080
You also have to wait a while

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.880
before you can do any character building whatsoever.

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.420
The game tries to make sure you only get

01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:13.580
a second praxis after the standoff

01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:14.920
at the very end of the level,

01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:16.220
and this was done deliberately

01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:17.600
to hide another problem.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.520
The conversation enhancer augmentation

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.060
costs two points and lets you make

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:22.520
additional choices in dialogue

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:24.520
based on the other character's soy levels.

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:25.520
I'll kill you.

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:26.860
It's nice to have more options,

01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:28.780
but it tells you which answer will work

01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:29.940
using colored lights,

01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:32.320
turning social engagement into Simon Says.

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:33.400
In longer conversations,

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.540
it vomits even more UI onto your screen,

01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:37.120
which disrupts the experience.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.280
The Sandoval sequence is much less tense

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.420
with all this stuff everywhere

01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:41.540
telling you how to win.

01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:43.120
Anyway, if you play the first level

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:44.800
in a really meticulous way,

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.760
you can get two praxis points

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:48.040
before meeting Sanders.

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.220
If you spend them on the conversation enhancer,

01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:52.180
the game does a strange thing.

01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:54.520
It only throws up some of the stuff it's supposed to,

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.680
and it doesn't give you any more dialogue options.

01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:59.180
You can't see his alpha, beta, or omega levels.

01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:00.440
Shit, he's a Sigma male.

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:01.600
Jensen, get out of there!

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:03.360
You see, in the original plan for the game,

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:05.240
you weren't able to just open a menu

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:07.440
and unlock augmentations at any time.

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.860
You had to go to a clinic to get them installed.

01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:11.360
This worked as world building,

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.320
but also sucked.

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:14.600
Imagine finding something

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:15.940
you need an augmentation for,

01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:17.940
then having to go to the doctor to get it

01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:19.320
and come all the way back.

01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:21.360
Later in development, the system was changed

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:22.480
to how it works now,

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:23.980
which was a clear improvement.

01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:25.440
However, the rest of the game

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:28.120
had already been designed around the original system,

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.520
and you don't go to a clinic

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.040
until the first mission is over,

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.080
so the level was made assuming players

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:34.860
don't have any augmentations.

01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:37.500
For example, the conversation enhancer.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:40.280
Zeke's voice actor already recorded all his lines

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.800
before this change was made,

01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:43.560
meaning there was no way his character

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.900
could react to the enhancer with new dialogue,

01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:48.080
so to avoid too many players noticing,

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:50.500
they deliberately paced the game's progression

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:51.580
really slowly.

01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:53.660
And at the time that we wrote it,

01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:57.080
we didn't even have the concept of praxis kits.

01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:01.380
You had to go to the limb clinic to get operated on,

01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:03.000
so I think that's why we decided

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.260
not to have it initially in this conversation

01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:08.000
because we knew you wouldn't have had a chance

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.180
to get it yet,

01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:12.180
and later we came in with the idea of the praxis kits,

01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:15.360
and at that point, it became this issue of,

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:17.680
oh, wait, we have to make sure we don't give you two

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:20.060
because you might have it and we don't support it.

01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:23.360
So character progression for entire hours of the game

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.060
is almost nonexistent because they had to avoid

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:27.860
a scenario they hadn't planned for,

01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:29.360
and the saddest thing about this is

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:32.480
the developers are obviously painfully aware of all this.

01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:33.480
At the beginning of the game,

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:36.220
the pacing to get augmentations is too slow,

01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:38.940
and it's something that we're aware of

01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:40.360
and we're not happy with it,

01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:43.280
but because of those decisions and with what you explained,

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:46.240
we were forced to keep it this way, so...

01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:51.120
This is one of the reasons why modern big games'

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.040
production pipelines are often so rigid

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.360
in case you were interested.

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.440
When you chart an entire game in advance

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:58.900
and then change your mind about how something works,

01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:01.160
you risk breaking all the stuff that was made

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:02.900
assuming the game worked differently.

01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:05.400
This is an explanation but not really an excuse.

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:07.160
They could have just made the social enhancer

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.120
or cost three points and make it so players

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.500
could get two a bit sooner,

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.800
or hey, maybe write and record a few more lines

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:15.460
for one of the best characters in this thing.

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:16.880
That would have been really cool

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.960
but also a lot more work for the extreme edge case

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.880
of players picking this augmentation.

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:24.120
Cumulatively, the new augmentation system

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:27.840
massively affects the feel of the entire surrounding game.

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:29.760
In Deus Ex, the augmentation canisters

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.840
were unique, specific objects.

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.420
If you didn't find the canister

01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.260
with the augmentation you wanted in it,

01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:36.380
you never got it.

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.400
This made exploring really fun

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.280
because unique stuff you wanted could be hidden here

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:42.780
and finding one felt great.

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.700
It was a new set of possibilities.

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:46.740
The entire world was more engaging.

01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:47.920
Do you know how I found out there was

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.420
a cloaking device in Deus Ex?

01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:51.700
I hacked into a secret lab storage chamber

01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:53.160
and stole their augmentations

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:54.740
and one of them was a cloaking device.

01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:56.040
It felt like a discovery,

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:57.920
a reward for engaging with the world

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.880
and looking around and paying attention,

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.000
and then you have a cool thing for the whole game

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.220
that feels good to use

01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:04.960
because it feels like you earned it.

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.680
In Human Revolution, the cloaking device

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:08.800
is staring at you in the augmentation submenu

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.560
as soon as you open it for the first time

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:12.140
and you can unlock it whenever you want

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:13.560
for two praxis points.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.180
Is that as fun an experience?

01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:19.020
A thing I love about games like Deus Ex and New Vegas

01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:20.600
is the sense they're full of secrets

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:22.140
and new things to find.

01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:23.740
A corner of an abandoned vault

01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:25.480
might have a one-of-a-kind gun in it.

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:27.060
A safe in a terrorist hideout

01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:28.740
has a speed enhancement in it.

01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:31.080
When you find it, it doesn't just feel cool.

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:34.000
It makes you want to find and open every safe in the world

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.280
to see what else is in them.

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:37.460
What if instead of all of this unique,

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:39.740
special stuff you tangibly found,

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:41.840
it was just a stack of money you could spend

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:44.620
buying those things in a submenu or at a store?

01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:46.420
It's not fun exploring a world

01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:48.760
whose most high-value reward for exploring

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:51.140
is a floppy disk that gives you a point

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.340
you already have six of but won't spend yet

01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:55.140
because you have to save them in case it turns out

01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:56.140
you need something.

01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:57.640
I guarantee you a lot of players

01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:00.020
missed some pretty easy-to-find praxis points

01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:01.980
because looking for them was boring.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.380
Oh, there's a praxis point in this elevator shaft.

01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:06.600
What an adventure.

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.840
It's not game-ruining that it works this way.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:10.760
It just makes everything a lot less fun

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:13.260
than it could have been, and why?

01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:15.560
In the name of making it a bit simpler?

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:16.980
Human Revolution is definitely

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:18.640
slightly more welcoming this way.

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.940
A spreadsheet doesn't appear when you hit new game,

01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:22.560
and at no point do you need to remember

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:24.860
to open a menu to spend experience points

01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:26.820

the time it takes to hack is risky.

You committed to this.

Was that a good idea?

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:37.880
Sure, if the game was just a hacking simulator,

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.140
it would be terrible and not have much gameplay,

01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:42.180
but when you're sitting there exposed

01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:44.520
in a building full of guys who are looking for you,

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:47.520
hearing the camera right behind you moving back and forth,

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:50.020
watching that meter slowly tick down,

01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:51.060
it's exciting.

Hacking is also a skill,

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.640
so when you level it up, it gets much faster

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:57.100
and you can do more things with computers you've hacked.

01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:58.940
This means investing more in hacking

01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:00.820
and watching it go increasingly quickly

01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:03.940

If you were untrained in computers,

01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:15.780
you couldn't hack at all.

and a skill you invest in

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:22.740
and the weight creates tension

01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:24.900

The problem with treating hacking as passive

is that every developer tries to make it less passive

01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:47.820
The player sometimes has no alternative solutions

01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:49.360
but to play this minigame,

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.520
and I'm genuinely not sure why.

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:52.980
Were they that proud of it?

01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:54.480
Why take away the player's ability

01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:55.980
to choose how to progress?

01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:58.780
Being mandatory actually makes the hacking worse too

01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:00.600
because now the developers have to account

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.240
for the possibility players were really bad at hacking

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.740
or hadn't put any of their skill points

01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:06.820
into the ability to hack higher level terminals.

01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:08.620
Which means all the mandatory ones

01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:10.620
are incredibly low level and easy.

01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:13.120
So sure, this means if you hate hacking,

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:15.780
it's never challenging when you're forced to do it,

01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:17.860
but it also means players who put their points

01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:19.620
into hacking are never tested

01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:22.040
on any of the important terminals of the game.

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:23.780
There's a section partway through where the player

01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:26.540
has to hack the computer of that master hacker from before.

01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:28.820
I love computers. This computer belongs to the guy

01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:32.160
who brain jacked someone and made them jack their brain

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.400
right in front of you.

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:35.900
He's so advanced, the biggest tech company

01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:37.980
in the world hired him to do it.

01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:41.020
He's had a secret backdoor into your company's computers

01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:42.520
for like a year.

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:45.060
However, this master hacker's computer

01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:47.160
is plot important, so it's level one

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:49.400
and easy to get into and his computer's covered

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:52.200
in the extra hacking viruses to help you out just in case.

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:53.980
There isn't even a password you can find

01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:56.240
if you explore or search other areas.

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:57.520
You have to hack.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.900
Also sure, the forever alone meme.

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:01.100
That'll age well.

01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:03.780
You'll notice I said meme and not in-joke.

01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:06.020
What if this master hacker's computer

01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:08.900
was really high level and if you hadn't invested in hacking,

01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:10.820
you needed to go on a cool side quest

01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:13.620
to learn the password or explore his apartment to find it?

01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:15.080
Or what if you just couldn't get into it

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:17.580
and had to follow up on other leads to find the hacker?

01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:19.900
You want players to feel like they gained something

01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:22.940
from specializing, not that they wasted their time.

01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:24.740
In the original, there's a section where you need

01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:26.480
to acquire the password to a computer

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:28.980
and it's deep in a basement full of lasers and traps

01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:30.580
and explosives and turrets,

01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:31.860
but if you invested in hacking,

01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:33.440
you can just hack the computer.

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:35.520
Giving the player choices based on what sort

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:37.400
of character they've made is kind of

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:39.360
the whole point of RPGs.

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.320
If the game was either a forced search

01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:44.600
for a password in a basement or a forced hacking sequence,

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:47.240
it would lose a lot of its value as gameplay,

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:49.820
but no, you see, hacking must be central

01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:51.640
to the game's progression.

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:53.520
Why though? The game does reward you

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.140
for investing in hacking sometimes.

01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:57.060
Off the beaten track are high level terminals

01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:58.820
that lead to extra stuff and in missions,

01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:00.280
there's often security equipment

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:01.560
that let you turn off cameras,

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:03.900
commandeer turrets, and even combat robots

01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:05.860
when the level designers remember to put them in.

01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:07.360
I think it feels a bit less special

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:10.020
that everyone else is doing half the hacking you do anyway,

01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:11.640
but it still works out to be pretty fun.

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:13.640
One of my favorite things to do in Human Revolution

01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:15.360
is if you have the ability to hack turrets

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:16.560
and the strength upgrade,

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:18.820
you can pick up turrets and carry them around

01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:20.560
while they destroy everyone in your path.

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:21.560
It's fantastic.

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.060
It feels amazing being rewarded

01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:24.680
for combining these two abilities.

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:25.720
This stuff is great.

01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:27.600
The part of this transaction I don't like

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:29.680
is how many times I had to play competitive

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:31.360
join the dots to get here.

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:34.120
It's not just that the hacking is a huge waste of time.

01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:36.120
It's that they deliberately made their game

01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:38.400
more of a waste of time than the original

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.660
with the specific intent of making the player

01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:42.620
feel like they're doing more,

01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:44.660
and yeah, you are doing more,

01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:47.400
but more busy work does not equal more fun,

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:49.780
and this idea has gone unquestioned for so long

01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:51.160
that it was a genuine shock

01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:53.160
when the recent death loop removed it

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:54.820
or when Bioshock 2 removed it

01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:56.200
and added a separate weapon

01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:57.580
that triggered a different minigame

01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:58.940
that was shorter and simpler

01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:00.440
and actually impacted the gameplay

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.620
Is it just me or is Bioshock 2 the best one

01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:04.940
by a really wide margin?

01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:06.200
Like, it's not even close.

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:07.620
All right, all right, I have to stop.

01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:08.700
My heart can't take it.

01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:10.020
The hacking chapter is over.

01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:12.120
We're safe. We're alive. It's gone.

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:13.940
Let's move to yellower pastures.

01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:15.700
♪♪

01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:17.480
The smart lockpick is always handy.

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:19.200
The original game also had mechanics

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:20.740
for lockpicking to deal with locks

01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:22.860
and electronics for bypassing other devices

01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:25.280
that can't be hacked like power boxes and stuff,

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:27.120
but hey, if you squint,

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:29.440
they're a bit passive too, aren't they?

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:31.660
You just sit there and use your item on them.

01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:34.820
How did the Human Revolution team update these mechanics?

01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:37.400
They replaced them with the fucking hacking minigame!

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:39.660
♪♪

01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:42.200
That's right! There's three times as much hacking

01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:43.700
as you thought there was going to be.

01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:45.160
To get into people's houses,

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:48.820
you don't need to find, you know, a fucking key.

01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:50.080
Like how doors work.

01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:52.360
You hack the convenient terminal

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.740
in front of everybody's door

01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:56.740
or if you're lucky, you can find the code for it somewhere.

01:23:56.740 --> 01:24:00.000
The concept of keys doesn't exist

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.280
in the world of Human Revolution.

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:03.820
Now that's streamlining.

01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:05.660
In the original, hacking, lockpicking,

01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:07.420
and electronics were all separate skills

01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:10.160
you could invest in with different effects on the world.

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:12.200
All of this being the same minigame

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:13.700
makes it all feel like you're doing

01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:15.280
the same thing over and over

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:17.280
and it feels like that because you are.

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.500
Using a multi-tool that's tied into your proficiency

01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:21.880
with a skill to turn off a laser grid, that's cool,

01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:23.700
but what if instead it was a minigame

01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:25.500
that took 24 seconds to do?

01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:26.500
Oh, yeah, I'd love that.

01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:28.420
Just squeeze that right into my mouth.

01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:30.220
Actually, no, we're not playing that in fast forward.

01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:31.720
You're watching all of this with me.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.340
I've got a magazine here.

01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:44.720
Man, there's a full page ad here

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:46.960
for Mark Kermode's film review.

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:48.300
I like that guy. I disagree with him

01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:49.540
like 90% of the time,

01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:51.720
but I'll know if I like a movie based on what he says,

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:54.000
so I think that makes him a good critic, right?

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.460
Oh, it's over.

01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:58.300
Now, go watch that 150 times

01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:00.460
and then tell me that this is good.

01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:02.460
Quite a few more people have the achievement

01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:05.720
for hacking 50 devices than for beating the second boss

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:07.260
a bit past the halfway point.

01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:09.380
I can't help but wonder if the hacking is a factor

01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:11.040
in why people stopped playing.

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:12.540
Apparently, one company

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:14.500
manufactures everybody's locks now.

01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:16.460
That must be where the Illuminati get all the money

01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:18.080
for their secret science bases.

01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:19.460
Based on how you played it,

01:25:19.460 --> 01:25:21.380
Deus Ex was a lot of different things

01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:22.500
to a lot of people.

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:25.040
Now a bunch of it is unavoidably hacking.

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:28.200
For everyone, and that is worse.

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:30.040
None of this stuff is a deal breaker, of course.

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:31.280
The game's still pretty good.

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:33.420
I just think it really sucks how many choices

01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:35.700
have been actively removed from the game,

01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:38.380
but that's not what the developers were focused on.

01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:41.420
By their own admission, they focused on the combat.

01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:45.500
♪♪

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:47.040
The first thing most people notice

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:48.340
about the original Deus Ex

01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:50.880
is that shooting is fairly complicated and weird.

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.160
Weapons are pretty powerful.

01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:54.200
Headshots with almost any weapon are lethal,

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:57.000
but they require skill point investments to use properly.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.860
At lower levels, they reload slower,

01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:01.240
are less effective, and take ages to aim.

01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:03.820
This kind of odd aiming system wasn't an accident.

01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:04.960
This was deliberately added

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:06.780
onto the Unreal Tournament engine.

01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:09.080
Yeah, it's not a very good first-person shooter,

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:11.580
but it's also not trying to be one.

01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:13.360
It's trying to be an RPG

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:16.000
where shooting is a skill you have to invest in.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.080
Combat being something difficult to execute

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:19.820
is an important part of the design.

01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:21.580
I'll explain what I mean by referring

01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:24.000
to another famous immersive sim, Thief.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.420
Thief is a stealth game,

01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:27.220
but you can pull out a sword if you want,

01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:29.760
and there's a pretty in-depth sword fighting system in there,

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:32.260
but as soon as you fight more than one person at once

01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:34.500
or an undead warrior or a wizard,

01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:35.800
you're basically dead.

01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:38.880
The point is combat is a bad situation you should avoid.

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:41.180
Ah!

01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:44.080
Thief's sneaking is fun because you know you're dead

01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:45.960
if you get seen by a bunch of people.

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:47.080
On the higher difficulties,

01:26:47.080 --> 01:26:48.840
killing someone gives you a game over.

01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:50.460
It wouldn't be as fun if you could cut

01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:52.380
six people's heads off in five seconds

01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:55.140
and, oh, what's this dishonored footage doing here?

01:26:55.140 --> 01:26:56.680
Warren Spector worked at Looking Glass

01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:59.100
while they were making Thief and remembers being annoyed

01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:01.100
he couldn't just fight enemies if he wanted,

01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:02.720
and in his talk, he actually describes

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:04.340
learning this exact lesson.

01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:08.220
I came to a place that was just too hard for me to sneak,

01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:09.720
and I asked the team,

01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:12.140
just make me tough enough that I can fight my way

01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:15.340
past these guards because I'm getting killed every time,

01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:16.420
and they said no.

01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:20.340
If we made the player character strong enough to fight,

01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:21.640
no one would ever sneak,

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:23.400
and the idea of the game was to sneak,

01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.100
and they're probably right for Thief.

01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:26.560
That was probably the right decision to make.

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:28.180
He describes Deus Ex as a game

01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:30.280
trying to be a bit more balanced than Thief.

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:33.060
I made a vow right then that I was gonna make a game

01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:37.100
that lets you fight or sneak, uh, as you chose.

01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:39.360
It wants to let you do combat if you want to

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:41.100
and make it satisfying to win

01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:43.900
but also retain the fun of avoiding it if you can

01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:45.680
by making combat something that's hard

01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:47.140
if you're not invested in it.

01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:49.220
This means sneaking or using exploration

01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:51.560
or talking to people or hacking the enemy's robots

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:54.320
and letting them mess them up for you is rewarding.

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:57.060
Right before we shipped, I put my head down on my desk,

01:27:57.060 --> 01:27:58.240
and I just said,

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:01.900
if people get that you can fight, sneak, or talk,

01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:03.700
we're gonna rule the world.

01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:06.860
If people compare our combat to Half-Life, we're dead.

01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:08.400
For the Human Revolution team,

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:11.020
modernizing the combat was their highest priority.

01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:13.140
Lapicus's talk has a chart showing what they spent

01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:14.480
the most time and resources on.

01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:17.480
As we decided that combat would be where we would put

01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:19.980
most of our time, energy, and resources.

01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:22.980
They knew they could handily outdo the original on combat,

01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:24.860
so they really put their minds to it,

01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:27.480
and the combat in Human Revolution is really good.

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:29.820
Bullets hurt a lot, so fights are punishing

01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:31.900
when you get hit, and they're satisfying to win

01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:33.160
because you almost died.

01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:34.660
I thought I would hate that they added

01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:36.080
cover shooting to Deus Ex,

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:37.900
but it's executed really well.

01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:40.040
Wee. There's no huge gauntlets.

01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:41.900
Every shootout is its own landscape

01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:43.860
with enemies trying to flank and flush you out

01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:45.620
with grenades once a fight starts.

01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:47.240
There's none of the busy work you get in

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:48.780
with other shooters where you just, like,

01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:51.080
kill a lot of people so you have something to do

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:52.340
on your way to the next level.

01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:54.540
When you do fight, the fight is unique

01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:56.840
and specific to that area and the type of

01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:58.260
and amount of enemies.

01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:00.380
That said, there is one aspect of the combat

01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:02.460
that's not very good. Let's talk about melee.

01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:04.560
Deus Ex had a wide variety of lethal

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:06.840
and non-lethal choices for hand-to-hand combat

01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:09.060
from police batons to riot prods,

01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:10.340
knives, and crowbars.

01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:12.400
Then when you got to China, you could find a sword

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.640
and have a flipping sword, which was cool,

01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:17.180
and later you found a gosh darn lightsaber.

01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:19.140
Well, a sword made of tiny nanomachines

01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:20.640
arranging in the shape of a sword,

01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:22.260
but look at it. Human revolution

01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:26.300
streamlined melee weapons by removing them.

01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:29.560
No, really, there's no melee weapons in Deus Ex anymore.

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:32.400
You can't pull out a stick and swing it at someone.

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.440
It's all guns all the time.

01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:36.100
It's like me at the gym.

01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:37.600
There's baseball bats lying around,

01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:39.200
but hell, if anyone uses them,

01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:40.480
no one can even pick it up.

01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:41.660
That shit must be heavy.

01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:42.940
Grenades can't even move it.

01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:44.580
Instead, you perform melee combat

01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:46.960
by pressing a button, and if you have enough energy,

01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:48.900
a cinematic plays depicting Jensen

01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:51.280
taking the person out, lethally or non-lethally

01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:53.080
based on whether you held the button down.

01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:55.280
They simplified the melee combat so much

01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:59.040
they moved it out of the game and into a cut scene.

01:29:59.040 --> 01:30:01.240
Cut scene Jensen rides again.

01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:03.920
He gets to have fun with his arm swords,

01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:05.260
and you don't.

Boggling. I just realized what a great word that is.

01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:40.740
The takedowns cost a full bar of energy to use

01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:43.240

from a game review ever,

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:51.360

Melee combat costing ammunition

is a mechanic from Vampire Reign,

01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.660
a game almost universally recognized

01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:02.360
as one of the worst ever,

a perfect place to draw inspiration from

01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:05.660
for your new Deus Ex game.

the RPG mechanics of the original

01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:24.540
have been completely removed.

01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:26.740
Adam has perfect aim with almost every weapon

01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:27.740
at the start of the game,

01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:29.320
especially if you use the sights,

01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:30.660
and while there are augmentations

01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:31.660
that reduce recoil,

01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:32.820
the recoil you start with

is pretty easy to handle,

and this is good.

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:36.660
It means combat is more a test

01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:38.960
of the player's skill than their character's stats,

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:41.080

The original game's stealth was okay.

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:02.460
You could lean around corners, which sounds stealthy,

01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:04.960
but it didn't seem to help you avoid being caught.

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:06.200

01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:51.460
of this game's developers had previously worked

01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:53.000
on Splinter Cell Chaos Theory,

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.680
one of the best stealth games and games of all time,

01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:58.220
including Francois Lapikus,

01:32:58.220 --> 01:33:00.720
making him a literal heroic genius.

I'm not normally a pure stealth guy.

01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:05.400

I hope that joke earlier didn't mislead you.

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:10.720
I love that game, seriously,

01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:12.820
but Human Revolution is at its most fun

01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:15.820
when you take the stealth as seriously as you can.

01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:17.900
The Thief games and even Splinter Cell

01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:20.200
start to bore me after a while when I try that,

01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:23.280
but here everything's at its most tense and careful

01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:25.620
while never being too slow or trial or error,

01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:27.880
and I just criticized the takedowns,

01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:28.880
but you know what?

01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:30.540
They're super reliable for stealth.

If you haven't been seen,

01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:33.460
the takedown is silent and stealthy

01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:35.940
and there's no chance of it not knocking out the enemy

01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:37.080
like you thought it would.

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:39.240
This is kinda how Chaos Theory worked,

01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:41.540
using takedowns instead of typical melee.

01:33:41.540 --> 01:33:44.660
It was always an instant kill or knockout.

01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:46.920
You just had to get in close enough to do it,

01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:49.760
which explains why they did it the way they did here.

01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:52.680
Sam Fisher's Sleepy Slappers didn't need ammunition, though,

01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:54.640
and the takedown wasn't a long animation

01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:55.920
that took away your control,

01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:57.800
but at least the game's weird melee system

01:33:57.800 --> 01:33:59.560
starts to make sense when you consider

01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:01.100
the creators' design chops

01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:02.900
and what delicious chops they were.

01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:04.500
God, this is such a good game.

01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:06.340
I'm so happy I got to bring this up.

01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:08.880
♪♪

01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:12.260
The AI in Human Revolution is really fun to hide from

01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:15.060
in almost exactly the same way Chaos Theory was.

01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:17.600
They'll hear you if you run and see you immediately

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:18.600
if you're out in the open,

01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:19.800
but if you're crouch-walking,

01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:21.680
you pretty reliably can't be heard,

01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:24.180
and you can even get away with falling a short distance now.

01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:26.440
You can hide in enemies' peripheral vision

01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:28.740
in ways that are maybe a little unrealistic

01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:30.900
but feel great to get away with.

01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:32.940
The third-person cover mode functions

01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:35.500
as a perfected version of the original's peaking.

01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:38.320
It's kind of hilarious that they literally went on record

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:40.580
that combat was the most important thing,

01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:43.160
but while they were at it, they just casually tossed in

01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:45.040
one of the best stealth experiences

01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:46.500
this side of Dishonored,

01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:49.580
but the developers had designed themselves into a corner.

01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:51.000
They'd made a game that featured

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.800
a fantastic stealth experience

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:54.880
and then given players a bunch of guns,

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:56.960
removed the limitations on shooting

01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:58.800
that made it less viable in the original,

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:01.580
and then bolted third-person cover shooting mechanics

01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:04.500
onto their first-person game just to make sure

01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:07.080
you could shoot people any way you wanted.

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:09.120
Remember what I said about games like Deus Ex

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:10.920
being sums of parts?

01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:13.760
You can't make a game like Deus Ex more like a shooter

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:16.800
without inevitably making it less like Deus Ex.

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:19.100
The balance of which mechanics you rely on

01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:20.640
to survive has shifted.

01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:22.940
Shooting has become the most viable solution

01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:25.140
to most problems when in the original,

01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:27.020
it was the least viable solution,

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:28.500
and that made it fun to avoid

01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:30.540
or to really lean into and get good at.

01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:33.540
You could spend a long time memorizing these patrols,

01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:36.040
learning to meticulously sneak between cover,

01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:38.260
put all your augmentation points into cloaking

01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:40.680
or running silently, and have to be very careful

01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:42.300
whenever you need to come back through this room

01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:43.800
because they're all still here,

01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:46.260
or you can click on four guys

01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:48.520
and not have to worry about them ever again.

01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:54.320
♪♪

01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:57.240
Since shooting people is extremely simple and fun,

01:35:57.240 --> 01:35:59.540
it becomes the dominant strategy,

01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:02.620
the thing you're incentivized to do to solve your problems.

01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:05.540
This threatens to ruin all of the other mechanics.

01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:07.880
Why use stealth when everyone's dead

01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:10.540
and the fights that happen when people see you are fun?

01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:13.000
Why bother hacking a terminal to turn off cameras

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.540
or turn turrets against their owners

01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:16.680
when you shot all the owners when you came in?

01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:18.460
Who are the cameras even gonna send after me

01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:20.800
when they see me? Everybody's dead, Dave.

01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:23.260
But you'll notice I said threatens there

01:36:23.260 --> 01:36:24.620
because the developers were clever

01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:26.460
and they noticed this possibility too

01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:27.580
during playtesting.

01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:30.500
They'd worked really hard designing fairly complex levels

01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:32.180
with multiple paths and solutions

01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:34.220
and then testers clicked on the bad men

01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:36.980
until they died and walked to the next objective.

01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:38.840
It was a total failure.

01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:41.760
Playtests showed us that people were just gunning everything

01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:44.860
and they weren't thinking. It was just a huge frag fest.

01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:46.060
So to fix this,

01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:48.520
they came up with a really clever solution.

01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:51.740
♪♪

01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:54.060
Sure, shooting would solve everything,

01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:55.180
but to correct for it,

01:36:55.180 --> 01:36:57.860
the game is astonishingly stingy with ammo.

01:36:57.860 --> 01:37:00.280
Ammunition pickups you can find lying around in levels

01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:02.560
usually amount to a handful of bullets apiece,

01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:05.240
and for more specialized weapons like the tranquilizer rifle,

01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:07.060
you're lucky to find two or three,

01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:08.740
which is accurate. I only keep a couple

01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:10.620
of tranquilizer darts in my office too.

01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:12.780
Enemies have been meticulously designed

01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:14.660
to be almost a waste of bullets

01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:16.820
if you try fighting them like in a normal shooter.

01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:17.780
They drop their weapons,

01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:19.120
which have a couple bullets in them,

01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:21.580
and sometimes there's a few more on their bodies.

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:24.100
If you're not being really precise with your shots,

01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:27.180
you can easily end with less ammo than you started.

01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:28.880
This was a super smart choice.

01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:30.480
It means there's much more pressure

01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:33.020
to make your shots count or, more importantly,

01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:36.220
to avoid wasting bullets fighting in the first place.

01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:39.360
This tremendously alters how the player relates to the world.

01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:41.140
Sure, you could just shoot all these guys

01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:42.900
like I said before, but that would actually make

01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:44.860
your life harder in the next fight.

01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:45.700
See what I mean?

01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:48.040
Scarcity of resources recontextualizes

01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:50.860
what would otherwise be a fairly simple situation.

01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:53.240
Sure, you can take a bunch of guys out with a grenade,

01:37:53.240 --> 01:37:55.440
but you have, like, two grenades.

01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:56.660
You might need those.

01:37:56.660 --> 01:37:57.980
The end result is like playing

01:37:57.980 --> 01:37:59.540
a fairly simple cover shooter

01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:02.860
while being lightly choked from behind by a game designer.

01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:04.160
Even when it's straightforward,

01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:06.780
it's still a little tense, and that's what makes it fun.

01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:09.660
Adam Jensen is a deadly shadow on the battlefield

01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:12.200
who can dish it out, but only in small portions,

01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:14.880
and if he's not careful, he won't have room for dessert.

01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:16.920
I'm not kidding how seriously these guys took

01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:18.140
the balancing of resources.

01:38:18.140 --> 01:38:20.260
In Lapicus's talk, he shows photographs

01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:21.920
of huge bulletin boards they made

01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:23.740
to track all the weapons, ammunition,

01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:25.960
and items a player could find in the levels.

01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:28.880
We used these balance boards to get a sense

01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:30.500
of everything that was in the game.

01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:32.340
This is about half the boards we had.

01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:33.580
We had six in total.

01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:36.140
And tried to make sure they were never too powerful,

01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:37.500
never had enough stuff,

01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:39.840
so a big fight would always cost them.

01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:41.340
During playtests, people would complain.

01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:43.340
They would say, well, I don't have enough ammo

01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:46.060
to kill everybody, but then again,

01:38:46.060 --> 01:38:47.900
that's exactly what we wanted.

01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:49.140
Chris Rock was right.

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:51.700
Sometimes what you need is bullet control,

01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:54.200
so the core experience works out really well.

01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:56.200
There's this fantastic primary loop

01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:58.000
of carefully avoiding enemies,

01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.960
stealthily taking out the ones you can

01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:02.720
with takedowns or silenced weapons to preserve ammo,

01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:05.500
hoping to thin the crowd before a big fight starts,

01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:07.760
building up enough ammunition that you can afford

01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:09.680
to get in fights when you do get caught,

01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:12.720
the occasional inevitable explosions of violence,

01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:15.480
and the careful picking clean of the bodies at the end.

01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:18.220
There's a rhythm to it that feels excellent.

01:39:18.220 --> 01:39:20.980
If you want an FPS RPG whose FPS component

01:39:20.980 --> 01:39:22.800
is some genuinely good shooting

01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:25.060
that doesn't invalidate stealth and hacking

01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:26.720
and other alternative solutions,

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:29.680
Human Revolution is basically the game for you.

01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:32.880
However, as Deus Ex used to like pointing out,

01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:34.840
these choices have consequences.

01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:36.760
Say you like the tranquilizer rifle.

01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:39.600
It's silent and non-lethal and has a decent range.

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:42.640
It has basically no weaknesses except it's a bit slow.

01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:45.380
So in a normal game, the bullets would be expensive,

01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:47.220
but that would be your choice to make, right?

01:39:47.220 --> 01:39:49.060
Well, not here because if you can buy

01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:50.800
all the tranq rifle rounds you want,

01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:51.960
the game would be too easy.

01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:53.380
Instead, the local weapon store

01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:56.180
will sell you five packs of two,

01:39:56.180 --> 01:39:58.220
and those ten darts will have to last you a while

01:39:58.220 --> 01:40:00.420
because the other store in Detroit doesn't sell any.

01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:02.100
You'll have to go all the way to China

01:40:02.100 --> 01:40:04.420
to find someone else willing to sell these to you.

01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:05.600
This is a good choice.

01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:07.720
Giving the player too much ammo for the best weapon

01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:10.220
would ruin the tension and make things way too easy,

01:40:10.220 --> 01:40:12.520
but on a simpler level, it's incredibly annoying

01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:14.600
to not be allowed to buy ammo

01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:16.420
for the weapon you like to use.

01:40:16.420 --> 01:40:18.880
This is one of the trade-offs this design has to make.

01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:20.840
It works, but in a way that might be

01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:22.720
a little bit annoying for some types of player

01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:25.040
who thought they could spend the money they were saving

01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:28.000
on things they wanted or expected one of the two weapons

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.220
they can fit in their inventory to have enough ammo

01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:31.800
available to make it useful.

01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:33.500
There are also limb clinics where you can buy

01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:36.180
praxis points, so I mean, if you want more,

01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:38.220
you can look around for more credits to buy more

01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:40.840
and maybe sell the weapons and ammo you aren't using, right?

01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:43.960
You know, like a fun video game would do

01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:46.540
if it wanted to give you interesting decisions to make.

01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:48.080
The billboard says no.

01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:51.760
Limb clinics will sell you two praxis points.

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:54.040
The scarcity starts to feel really weird

01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:57.040
if you think too hard about it or try to circumvent it.

01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:58.920
What's that? You think you can get the upper hand

01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:00.960
by knocking out a bunch of well-armed policemen

01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:03.160
with assault rifles and get a couple more bullets

01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:05.000
to get an edge at the start of the game?

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:08.340
Nice try. Those cops aren't carrying any ammo on them

01:41:08.340 --> 01:41:10.420
and their guns had three bullets in them.

01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:13.000
No, not each. Between both of them.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.500
In a fight, NPCs have infinite bullets.

01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:17.960
The game keeps track of how many shots they've fired,

01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:20.200
not so it can give you their remaining ammo,

01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:22.120
so avoiding fighting and taking them out

01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:24.120
gives you a bigger reward, but to keep track

01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:26.160
of when they need to reload.

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:27.500
I don't know. This is starting to feel

01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:28.920
a little bit artificial.

01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:31.700
Lots of areas have weapons lying around sort of as props,

01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:33.460
populating some of the pretty sparse

01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:34.920
office and apartment areas.

01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:37.700
Almost all of these have exactly one bullet in them.

01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:39.700
There's something extremely disconcerting

01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:42.240
about a world full of people who keep a gun on their desk

01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:43.480
with one bullet in it.

01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:45.280
This sort of thing starts to really affect

01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:46.780
how exploration feels.

01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:49.120
Remember, these guys had a big billboard on the wall

01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:51.020
keeping track of every bullet in the game

01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:52.480
after seeing what playtesters did

01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:53.860
when they gave them too much,

01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:56.440
so if you're exploring every nook and cranny,

01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:58.940
opening every locker, looking in bathrooms

01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:00.400
and behind boxes and so on,

01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:02.620
there will be rewards for exploring,

01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:04.860
but the billboard said if you get too much stuff,

01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:06.200
it won't be tense anymore,

01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:08.160
so the main reward is going to be, like,

01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:09.660
five more bullets.

01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:11.320
The game will throw a massive room

01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:12.940
full of, like, 50 lockers at you,

01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:14.980
and there'll be, like, four pickups in total

01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:18.200
amounting to one full clip of ammo for one gun

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:19.820
and a third of a clip for another

01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:20.940
and maybe a grenade,

01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:22.520
and the lockers only open halfway,

01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:23.820
so you gotta really peek in there

01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:25.120
to make sure you see everything.

01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:26.480
Oh, and because it's this game,

01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:28.980
none of the lockers are locked

01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:30.980
because locks don't exist anymore.

01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:33.440
Even the most daring heists in the game

01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:35.160
start to feel kind of pointless.

01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:38.060
In the Detroit level, you can break into the armory

01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:39.320
of a police station.

01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:40.820
A police station armory.

01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:43.060

Oh, and a rate of fire upgrade

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.200
so you can fire the bullets you don't have faster.

01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:21.360
You can really feel how contrived the Scarcity's.

Scarcity? Scarcity? I don't even know how to say it.

01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:25.280
Like, they put all these ammo pickups on the table

01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:27.540
so it feels like you're getting a big horde of stuff,

01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:29.820
but it's actually just several small boxes

01:43:29.820 --> 01:43:31.700
with two and three bullets in them.

01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:34.320
Think about why they deliberately did that for a second.

01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:35.960
They could have just put one box

with 15 bullets in it next to the gun,

01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:39.360

01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:41.660
how little stuff they were being given for this.

01:43:41.660 --> 01:43:43.560
If I gave you five quality streets

01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:45.360
and not even any green triangles,

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:47.060
you'd think I was ruining Christmas,

01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:49.560
but if I gave it to you in the form of two boxes

01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:52.980

No, I'm serious. I'm doing it again.

There's actually a couple of NPC guards

01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:10.320
who are, like, talking about how cool the Peps is

01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:11.860
in the hallway of the police station,

01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:13.820
and when you get it, you get four shots for it,

01:44:13.820 --> 01:44:15.320
and it kind of sucks.

01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:17.940
It sucks so bad it doesn't even come back in the sequel.

They make it like an augmentation or something.

01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:21.860
I didn't pick up the Peps here,

01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:23.980
but I did hoard all the ammo I could

01:44:23.980 --> 01:44:25.180
over the course of the whole game,

01:44:25.180 --> 01:44:27.820
so I got a good 15 shots in the last level.

01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:30.480
Okay, I'm done with my Peps talk.

01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:36.280
sadly and slowly takes out a revolver,

01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:38.100
and the implication is pretty clear, right?

01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:39.440
We know what he's planning,

01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:41.940
but then he also takes out a single bullet

01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:43.140
to put in the gun.

First off, Sandy, it's this game.

01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:46.320
The gun already had one bullet in it,

01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:48.600
but if you talk him down, he puts the gun on the desk,

01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:49.600
and you can pick it up,

01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:51.280
and of course it has one bullet in it,

01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:52.480
and if he does shoot himself,

01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:53.780
you can still pick up the gun,

01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:55.280
but of course it doesn't have five?

01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:57.140
Five bullets? Fuck this fucking game!

01:44:57.140 --> 01:44:58.940
It's not just having too many bullets

01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:00.140
that would make you overpowered.

01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:02.940
It's having weapons that are too powerful in general.

01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:05.780
The game has two really powerful weapons,

so you just have to shoot, really.

01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:14.220
Combined with the smart vision,

01:48:14.220 --> 01:48:15.720
e.g. through through walls,

01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:17.280
it makes for deadly combo.

01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:18.820
However, I'm telling you right away,

01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:20.860
it's a very difficult weapon to get.

01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:23.360
You can see why this is such a meaningful statement.

01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:25.280
I'm sure Degas wouldn't say that

01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:27.200
while intending for the rifle to be something

01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:29.120
you get lying against a wall

01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:30.820
right before the last couple of levels.

01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:33.200
We're going full speculation ops here.

01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:35.000
I could be reading way too much into this,

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.240
but it sounds like in the nearly a year

01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:39.200
between this interview and the release of the game,

01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:40.460
the design got altered.

01:48:40.460 --> 01:48:42.080
Maybe the laser rifle was balanced

01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:44.460
by making it a reward for some difficult challenge

01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:47.000
like a daring heist in a police station or something,

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:48.800
but then they did more playtesting

01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:51.100
and noticed that even when the weapon was hard to get

01:48:51.100 --> 01:48:52.300
and had limited ammo,

01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:54.420
it ruined the entire feel of the game.

01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:56.380
Stealth, conservation of resources,

01:48:56.380 --> 01:48:58.300
hell, even the basic flow of combat

01:48:58.300 --> 01:49:00.800
gets irrevocably changed when a player gets

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:03.480
the shoot through walls instant murder beam,

01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:05.220
so they must have made the tough decision

01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:07.860
of turning it into an extremely late game weapon

01:49:07.860 --> 01:49:09.820
so at the very least it couldn't mess

01:49:09.820 --> 01:49:11.440
with the rest of the game's pace.

01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:13.400
This points to just how devoted they were

01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:16.060
to making the central mechanics feel good.

01:49:16.060 --> 01:49:18.660
It's obviously really important for the game

01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:21.800
that it's not incredibly easy to defeat enemies.

01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:23.980
They designed several powerful weapons

01:49:23.980 --> 01:49:25.140
that were fun to play with,

01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:27.100
but then cut them out of most of the game

01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:29.140
in the name of making sure the core gameplay

01:49:29.140 --> 01:49:30.480
could live its best life.

01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:33.360
Unfortunately, and it pains me to do this,

01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:35.160
after all this time going into detail

01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:37.240
about some really clever design choices,

01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:40.740
we now have to talk about how they kind of ruined them.

01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:46.920
♪♪

01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:49.140
You know how I've been really hitting you over the head

01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:50.800
with how important scarcity was?

01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:53.440
Well, in his talk, Lapicus was also doing that.

01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:56.440
-"Dare Sex?" is a game about scarcity of resources.

01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:58.520
Oh, that's why I keep pronouncing it like that.

01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:00.060
If we give you everything,

01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:01.780
you're not gonna think anymore.

01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:04.900
You're just gonna go and use the simple route.

01:50:04.900 --> 01:50:07.740
It's fun for players to be rewarded for their choices

01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:10.120
or to be made to deal with problems caused by them.

01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:11.240
The original does this too,

01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:12.820
not to the same degree with ammunition,

01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:14.200
but because you needed lockpicks,

01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:16.400
multi-tools, augmentation canisters,

01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:17.900
medkits, skill points,

01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:19.440
and other useful items to progress,

01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:21.360
you're always hurting for something,

01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:22.660
and speaking of hurting,

01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:24.920
even damage was part of this puzzle.

01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:27.380
J.C. Denton had locational limb damage,

01:50:27.380 --> 01:50:28.540
a bit like in Fallout.

01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:30.960
Damaged limbs affected his aiming and his movement.

01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:32.680
If you broke your legs, you had to crawl around

01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:33.760
to find a medkit.

01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:36.300
This meant combat was extremely tense.

01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:38.840
You had to manage its effects on your body.

01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:40.680
Medkits didn't just bring back health.

01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:42.600
They had to be used on a specific body part

01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:44.460
to mitigate the effects of the damage.

01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:46.080
Without medkits and the skill

01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:47.380
that makes them more effective,

01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:48.420
you were in trouble,

01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:49.960
and the robots that healed you for free

01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:51.420
were few and far between.

01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:54.000
This meant combat and taking damage in general

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.140
had genuine stakes to it.

01:50:57.140 --> 01:51:00.140
-"Denton. Hey, it's Denton."

01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:01.140
Oh.

01:51:01.140 --> 01:51:02.680
Lucky there's a clinic nearby.

01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:04.480
-"Have you looked at any other options?

01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:07.140
Euthanasia is one sure way to relieve suffering."

01:51:07.140 --> 01:51:09.980
-"Uh, Chinese herbal nonsense is for twinks.

01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:11.240
I want real medicine."

01:51:11.260 --> 01:51:12.420
Human Revolution removed

01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:14.040
locational limb damage completely

01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:16.340
and replaced it with a simple health bar,

01:51:16.340 --> 01:51:18.720
which isn't the worst idea,

01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:21.440
and I know that because then they had the worst idea

01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:24.480
and went a step further and removed damage.

01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:26.940
If you haven't been shot for a few seconds,

01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:29.360
your health just comes back.

01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:30.700
It seems like when they were looking

01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:32.160
at other popular shooters of the day

01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:34.740
for inspiration for how to improve Deus Ex's combat,

01:51:34.740 --> 01:51:36.700
some wires got crossed and they borrowed

01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:38.660
their regenerating health mechanics too,

01:51:38.660 --> 01:51:39.820
mechanics which are great

01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:41.480
for combat-centric action shooters

01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:43.400
and terrible for ones where getting shot

01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:44.780
is supposed to matter.

01:51:44.780 --> 01:51:47.820
One of the most important facets of combat in Deus Ex,

01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:50.780
the consequences of combat, is just gone.

01:51:50.780 --> 01:51:52.740
If you got shot in a fight in Deus Ex,

01:51:52.740 --> 01:51:55.400
it was an extra complication you had to deal with.

01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:56.900
It didn't just go away.

01:51:56.900 --> 01:51:59.400
It was an added incentive to make smarter choices

01:51:59.400 --> 01:52:01.200
than getting into a straight shootout.

01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:02.980
Even if you killed everyone first,

01:52:02.980 --> 01:52:04.660
if they shot you, it was a problem

01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:05.980
you still had to deal with.

01:52:05.980 --> 01:52:08.740
It made the janky combat fun to put stats in

01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:09.900
so that you did well in it

01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:12.860
or to avoid completely using stealth or explosives.

01:52:12.860 --> 01:52:15.400
Regenerating health messes with the core concept

01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:17.400
of choices having consequences.

01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:19.860
Now, once everyone's dead, your health will come back

01:52:19.860 --> 01:52:21.620
while you're checking their bodies.

01:52:21.620 --> 01:52:24.240
You'd think a game that wanted to instill tension

01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:26.820
about survival and make combat's effects matter,

01:52:26.820 --> 01:52:28.540
for example, by making said bodies

01:52:28.540 --> 01:52:29.620
have two bullets on them,

01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:31.360
would avoid misusing

01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:33.160
regeneration mechanics like this.

01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:35.160
Human Revolution's combat doesn't get to be

01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:37.200
as engaging as it easily could have been

01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:39.000
because of this boneheaded idea.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.200
The choice to remove consequences from combat

01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:43.460
cuts off the game's potential at its knees,

01:52:43.460 --> 01:52:45.660
something you also can't do anymore.

01:52:45.660 --> 01:52:47.200
If you really want to balance combat

01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:48.460
against stealth and hacking

01:52:48.460 --> 01:52:49.780
and other alternative solutions,

01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:51.740
maybe make taking damage a problem.

01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:53.420
You could basically flip a switch,

01:52:53.420 --> 01:52:54.880
turn off regenerating health,

01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:56.700
and instantly make the entire game

01:52:56.700 --> 01:52:58.460
a much more fascinating puzzle.

01:52:58.460 --> 01:53:00.920
Make all of its combat that much more engaging,

01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:02.120
more of an obstacle.

01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:04.620
Since all of its effects would become cumulative,

01:53:04.620 --> 01:53:07.080
so many more players would be making fun decisions

01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:09.580
about how to engage in them or how to avoid them,

01:53:09.580 --> 01:53:11.160
and healing items would matter again,

01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:12.760
which they don't in Human Revolution

01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:15.160
because your health returns to maximum on its own.

01:53:15.160 --> 01:53:16.580
Why do you even have these in here?

01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:19.580
Oh, they put you slightly over your maximum health.

01:53:19.580 --> 01:53:21.880
Great. These items would have value

01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:24.300
in a world where you didn't just get all your health back?

01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:26.620
Jesus Christ. This affects energy too.

01:53:26.620 --> 01:53:28.460
In the original and Invisible War,

01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:31.000
you required energy to use augmentations.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.720
This made energy cells into a valuable resource,

01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:35.420
and it's clear in this game that someone

01:53:35.420 --> 01:53:36.840
had their head screwed on properly

01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:38.800
and wanted them to be like that here too

01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:40.260
because there's candy bars everywhere

01:53:40.260 --> 01:53:42.640
that refill one or more batteries of energy,

01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:44.300
but whoever that genius was,

01:53:44.300 --> 01:53:46.980
someone bashed his head in and went to work in his clothes

01:53:46.980 --> 01:53:49.980
and decided to make energy also refill on its own.

01:53:49.980 --> 01:53:52.600
The candy's useful if you want to do multiple takedowns

01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:54.760
in quick succession or really like using

01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:56.480
the cloaking device for long periods,

01:53:56.480 --> 01:53:58.680
but the fact you have practically infinite energy

01:53:58.680 --> 01:54:00.260
as long as you're willing to wait a second

01:54:00.260 --> 01:54:03.720
means there's no real economy to using augmentations.

01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:05.800
The health and energy pickups feel like

01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:08.640
vestigial remains of a much more engaging version

01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:10.640
of this game where these things mattered.

01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:12.300
I think this stuff is a bit of a shame,

01:54:12.300 --> 01:54:14.380
but bear in mind it's not that bad.

01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:17.380
The core experience still works really well so far.

01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:19.340
Sure, the scarcity can be a little annoying.

01:54:19.340 --> 01:54:20.720
The police forgot to bring bullets

01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:24.060
to a hostage situation or out on patrol or back at base.

01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:26.480
Your boss can only afford to give you one gun.

01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:28.600
He's a millionaire, but the store would only sell him

01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:31.060
seven darts for the tranquilizer gun you asked for,

01:54:31.060 --> 01:54:32.900
and two of the coolest guns in the game

01:54:32.900 --> 01:54:34.760
don't fucking exist.

01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:36.600
Oh, but thanks to my acts of heroism,

01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:40.100
I have a very slight discount on those stun gun darts

01:54:40.100 --> 01:54:42.100
I can buy literally six of.

01:54:42.100 --> 01:54:45.060
Yeah, that really helps. Thank you.

01:54:45.060 --> 01:54:47.560
But at least the intended effect works.

01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:49.100
You're making careful choices.

01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:50.600
You're having fun.

01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:53.600
Then you find a rocket launcher hidden in gang territory

01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:54.940
with two rockets.

01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:56.560
If you're in a fight with a large group

01:54:56.560 --> 01:54:58.860
or a big robot, this can change everything,

01:54:58.860 --> 01:55:00.940
but you can only fit it in your inventory

01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:02.980
if you throw a bunch of other stuff away.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.700
This is a great little decision

01:55:04.700 --> 01:55:06.380
to offer the player in a game like this.

01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:08.120
You have to make a tactical decision

01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:10.220
and become even weaker in regular fights

01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:12.180
in the hopes of having an edge in a big one.

01:55:12.180 --> 01:55:13.800
Moments like this are the secret

01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:15.220
to what makes these games fun,

01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:17.260
feeling confronted with possibilities

01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:18.600
and what to do about them.

01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:21.300
If there's a key Deus Ex thing you have to nail,

01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:22.300
it's this.

01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:24.440
Does the player feel a little bit nervous

01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:27.400
when they find a cool weapon they don't have room for?

01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:28.700
Then a level or so later,

01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:30.120
you're sneaking into a secret base,

01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:31.700
and there's a huge robot in the way.

01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:32.920
Normally, you'd be in trouble here

01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:34.180
and have to run and hide,

01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:35.460
but because of the consequences

01:55:35.460 --> 01:55:37.500
of your cool decision, you don't have to.

01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:40.020
This is your reward for good planning.

01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:41.020
["Dead Man's Lair"]

01:55:41.020 --> 01:55:42.020
["Dead Man's Lair"]

01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:43.020
["Dead Man's Lair"]

01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:44.020
["Dead Man's Lair"]

01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:45.020
["Dead Man's Lair"]

01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:46.020
["Dead Man's Lair"]

01:55:46.020 --> 01:55:47.020
["Dead Man's Lair"]

01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:48.020
["Dead Man's Lair"]

01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:49.020
["Dead Man's Lair"]

01:55:49.020 --> 01:55:50.020
["Dead Man's Lair"]

01:55:50.020 --> 01:55:51.020
["Dead Man's Lair"]

01:55:51.020 --> 01:55:52.860
Choice and consequences.

01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:55.520
That's the beating heart of Deus Ex.

01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:57.660
Well, it should be.

01:55:57.660 --> 01:55:58.820
You see, I lied.

01:55:58.820 --> 01:56:00.740
I didn't use this rocket launcher I found.

01:56:00.780 --> 01:56:02.080
I got this one from right here,

01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:03.960
sitting right next to the fucking robot.

01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:06.780
The developers almost made a game

01:56:06.780 --> 01:56:08.780
with decisions and consequences,

01:56:08.780 --> 01:56:10.340
and then they didn't.

01:56:10.340 --> 01:56:11.880
They made a game that handholds you

01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:13.380
through every obstacle.

01:56:13.380 --> 01:56:16.260
Robots are also easily destroyed by EMP grenades.

01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:18.920
Having to save your EMP grenades for tough situations

01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:21.640
would make them really rewarding to use, wouldn't it?

01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:23.420
But what if people forgot to bring any

01:56:23.420 --> 01:56:25.260
and wanted to use one on the robot?

01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:27.840
So they put one directly in front of you

01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:29.480
as soon as you entered the room.

01:56:29.500 --> 01:56:31.880
This...fucking sucks.

01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:33.420
There's no other way of saying it.

01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:34.840
They fucked up.

01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:37.440
It's obviously really important for the game

01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:40.560
that it's not incredibly easy to defeat enemies.

01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:43.680
If we give you everything,

01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:47.100
you're not gonna think anymore.

01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:52.360
Not only is this room just not a challenge,

01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:55.440
you gain access to a means of instantly killing this robot

01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:58.080
the literal actual moment you enter the room

01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:00.500
In this instant,

01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:03.460
players will realize their choices don't matter.

01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:05.340
If you saved that rocket launcher,

01:57:05.340 --> 01:57:08.800
you wasted your time, effort, and inventory space.

01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:10.920
You were a sucker who thought they were going

01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:13.520
to experience some kind of reward or punishment

01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:15.720
for your decision making, but you never will.

01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:17.860
This goes on for the entire game.

01:57:17.860 --> 01:57:19.360
The next time you fight these robots,

01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:21.240
the rocket launcher's right fucking there.

01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:22.860
The EMP grenades are right there.

01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:24.660
People complained about the boss fights

01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:27.240
being just shooting focused and therefore a problem

01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:28.700
for players who focused on stealth,

01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:29.740
but that's just not true.

01:57:29.740 --> 01:57:31.120
Every boss fight takes place

01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:32.860
in an ocean of weapons and ammo

01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:34.780
so the player can't possibly get stuck.

01:57:34.780 --> 01:57:37.320
All the stuff I said was fun is still fun,

01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:38.940
but the most important moments,

01:57:38.940 --> 01:57:41.580
the peaks of the mountain of risk and reward,

01:57:41.580 --> 01:57:42.740
have been eliminated.

01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:44.740
Mummy bird chewed your dinner for you.

01:57:44.740 --> 01:57:45.740
Open wide.

01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:47.580
If you're going to give me the solution

01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:50.380
to any interesting problem the instant I enter the room,

01:57:50.380 --> 01:57:52.880
you might as well have made this a cut scene too.

01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:54.860
Energy unlocked.

01:57:54.860 --> 01:57:57.200
Self-destruct sequence.

01:57:57.200 --> 01:57:59.620
Let me give you an example

01:57:59.620 --> 01:58:01.580
of how this is supposed to work.

01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:04.740
Resident Evil 4.

01:58:04.740 --> 01:58:08.080
In Resident Evil 4, you can find a rocket launcher.

01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:09.580
Just one, though.

01:58:09.580 --> 01:58:11.620
Additional launchers cost a ton of the cash

01:58:11.620 --> 01:58:13.380
you could have spent upgrading your weapons,

01:58:13.380 --> 01:58:14.800
so while they were powerful

01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:16.640
and let you practically skip bosses,

01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:19.680
they required a meaningful sacrifice by the player,

01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:21.100
throwing all that money away,

01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:22.480
and to even carry a launcher,

01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:24.540
you gave up a ton of space for one shot

01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:26.280
that was gone once you used it.

01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:28.040
Even looking at the rocket launcher

01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:30.000
in my inventory gives me tingles,

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.660
and staring at it in the store is tantalizing

01:58:32.660 --> 01:58:35.260
because it's a choice with meaningful consequences

01:58:35.260 --> 01:58:37.760
that doesn't condescend to the player's intelligence

01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:40.140
by giving them one anyway the instant they walk

01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:41.600
into a room with a boss.

01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:43.100
You might also notice that your health

01:58:43.100 --> 01:58:45.220
doesn't regenerate in Resident Evil either

01:58:45.220 --> 01:58:47.300
because that would be fucking stupid, wouldn't it?

01:58:47.300 --> 01:58:49.560
Deus Ex worked along a similar principle.

01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:51.700
The GEP gun was a huge inventory hog.

01:58:51.700 --> 01:58:53.660
You had to leave so many useful items

01:58:53.660 --> 01:58:55.900
lying where you found them and know you'd be in trouble

01:58:55.900 --> 01:58:58.320
if you needed a rebreather or some stealth camo,

01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:00.360
but it made fighting mechs a breeze,

01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:02.620
and in a pinch, it saved you a few lockpicks.

01:59:02.620 --> 01:59:05.120
That trade-off was so satisfying.

01:59:05.120 --> 01:59:08.040
I'm trying to imagine a version of this game

01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:10.200
where they just put a GEP gun on the floor

01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:11.620
near every major enemy,

01:59:11.620 --> 01:59:13.620
but I don't really need to imagine it.

01:59:13.620 --> 01:59:15.580
Now do I? To make a Deus Ex game

01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:17.380
where whenever you face a tough enemy,

01:59:17.380 --> 01:59:19.380
the means of killing it is right next to it

01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:21.000
and if it even manages to hurt you,

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.620
that health just comes back,

01:59:22.620 --> 01:59:24.920
you have completely removed the choices,

01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:27.620
consequences, and even most of the difficulty

01:59:27.620 --> 01:59:28.620
from your game.

01:59:28.620 --> 01:59:30.300
There's a version of Human Revolution

01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:31.840
that's truly incredible

01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:33.960
where it doesn't pull any of its punches,

01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:36.460
where saving a rocket launcher made a huge difference,

01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:38.100
where coping with the loss of resources

01:59:38.100 --> 01:59:39.600
once you used them was interesting,

01:59:39.600 --> 01:59:41.920
where getting shot actually hurt,

01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:44.600
and they almost made that game,

01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:46.260
and it's really kind of sad

01:59:46.260 --> 01:59:48.520
that they made a just okay one instead

01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:50.540
because they compromised their own design

01:59:50.540 --> 01:59:52.040
in the moments it mattered most,

01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:54.420
they made a game about scarcity of resources,

01:59:54.420 --> 01:59:57.220
and then got scared not everyone would like that

01:59:57.220 --> 01:59:59.540
and overcorrected in the other direction.

01:59:59.540 --> 02:00:02.100
Playing Human Revolution is an exercise in learning

02:00:02.100 --> 02:00:06.340
in real time why Deus Ex was a more management kind of game

02:00:06.340 --> 02:00:08.760
and why simplifying everything about an experience

02:00:08.760 --> 02:00:11.680
that's fun because it's a bit complicated is bad.

02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:12.900
Oh, it's so rewarding.

02:00:12.900 --> 02:00:15.100
You can stealth your way over to this panel

02:00:15.100 --> 02:00:16.860
and hack it and disable the robots.

02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:18.520
Wow, there's alternative solutions to that.

02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:20.900
They fucking give you a grenade that kills them instantly.

02:00:20.900 --> 02:00:23.120
It's incredibly fun to get to plan ahead

02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:24.780
and decide what's important to you

02:00:24.780 --> 02:00:28.040
and most importantly, actually see these choices play out

02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:29.460
for better or for worse.

02:00:29.460 --> 02:00:32.500
Nothing in Human Revolution is ever important.

02:00:32.500 --> 02:00:34.460
All the edges have been sanded off.

02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:36.620
It's a smooth and palatable pebble

02:00:36.620 --> 02:00:38.500
that isn't particularly disagreeable

02:00:38.500 --> 02:00:41.500
but slides out the other end completely undigested.

02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:44.420
You have failed to make a game about scarcity of resources

02:00:44.420 --> 02:00:45.800
if you put all those resources

02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:47.740
next to the things you need them for.

02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:49.280
At that point, you've made a game

02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:51.960
about how thinking was a waste of time.

02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:54.160
As soon as you realize you're going to be handed

02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:56.500
the solution to the problem once you encounter it,

02:00:56.500 --> 02:00:58.840
the depth of the experience drains away

02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:00.260
before your very eyes,

02:01:00.260 --> 02:01:03.100
and to do this after removing a bunch of the weapons

02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:05.140
means the game is so much more dull

02:01:05.140 --> 02:01:07.840
and devoid of stuff to play with than it could have been

02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:10.440
in service to a scarcity that went out the window

02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:12.980
the instant the player actually needed anything.

02:01:12.980 --> 02:01:15.400
No, if you want to play with cool weapons,

02:01:15.420 --> 02:01:18.380
you need to have pre-ordered the game in 2011.

02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:20.880
No, that's not a joke. That's an order.

02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:23.600
Get a time machine, call your local GameStop.

02:01:23.600 --> 02:01:26.380
♪♪

02:01:26.380 --> 02:01:28.560
Another slight wrinkle in the developers' attempts

02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:30.260
to balance their game was the fact that...

02:01:30.260 --> 02:01:38.560
♪♪

02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:41.100
If you pre-ordered Human Revolution from GameStop

02:01:41.100 --> 02:01:43.860
or Game, GameStation, or HMV in the UK...

02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:47.700
you got the Explosive Mission Pack.

02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:51.820
This pack lets the player start with a new type of grenade,

02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:53.500
remote explosives that detonate

02:01:53.500 --> 02:01:55.540
when you hold the grenade button down after throwing them,

02:01:55.540 --> 02:01:57.660
and a bonus mission towards the end of the game

02:01:57.660 --> 02:01:59.380
that rewards you with a new weapon.

02:01:59.380 --> 02:02:00.540
But that's not all.

02:02:00.540 --> 02:02:02.340
If the player bought the game from Amazon,

02:02:02.340 --> 02:02:03.760
Best Buy, or Walmart,

02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:06.000
they got the Tactical Enhancement Pack.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.600
With this pack, players start with two new weapons,

02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:11.480
a double-barreled shotgun, and a silenced sniper rifle.

02:02:11.480 --> 02:02:13.140
If you were wondering why you couldn't use

02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:15.100
a silencer upgrade on the sniper rifle,

02:02:15.100 --> 02:02:17.140
it's not because that would be an unbalanced weapon

02:02:17.140 --> 02:02:18.300
and the designers knew better.

02:02:18.300 --> 02:02:20.720
It's because you didn't buy the game from Walmart.

02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:23.100
The executives at Square Enix are killing us.

02:02:23.100 --> 02:02:25.720
Their hands are around our soft, Quebec-y necks.

02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:28.360
We're dying. Help us, please.

02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:30.060
This pack also lets you start the game

02:02:30.060 --> 02:02:31.280
with a ton of extra money,

02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:34.360
which is the funniest possible thing to give people

02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:36.020
when they have a limited amount of things

02:02:36.020 --> 02:02:37.440
they're allowed to buy.

02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:38.440
What the fuck?

02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:42.000
I'll try to be, uh, as, uh, specific as I can,

02:02:42.020 --> 02:02:44.020
meaning that I won't say too much,

02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:46.020
uh, because the marketing guys over there

02:02:46.020 --> 02:02:47.020
are watching over me.

02:02:47.020 --> 02:02:48.020
They're right here.

02:02:48.020 --> 02:02:50.480
And I feel the pressure of, uh,

02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:52.240
being careful about what I say.

02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:55.160
These bonuses eventually became purchasable as DLC.

02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:56.660
After a few months, they effectively

02:02:56.660 --> 02:02:58.280
became microtransactions.

02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:00.360
The Explosive Mission Pack also gives the player

02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:02.500
an automatic unlocking device,

02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:05.420
which you can use to skip a single hacking minigame.

02:03:05.420 --> 02:03:07.080
This gives me the opportunity to joke

02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:09.220
that Human Revolution's hacking is so bad,

02:03:09.220 --> 02:03:11.760
people paid actual money to skip it.

02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:13.600
The pack's extra level is a crime

02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:15.280
against Deus Ex canon,

02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:17.860
which is worse than most actual crimes.

02:03:17.860 --> 02:03:19.860
It's a mission to rescue Tong's son,

02:03:19.860 --> 02:03:22.020
who has been kidnapped by the bad guys.

02:03:22.020 --> 02:03:23.860
Tong's son is Tracer Tong,

02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:25.900
one of the main characters from the first game.

02:03:25.900 --> 02:03:27.700
It's pretty shitty they made the thing

02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:30.160
that's probably the most related to the original plot

02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:32.120
into a fucking pre-order bonus,

02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:34.780
really milking the people who cared about Deus Ex.

02:03:34.780 --> 02:03:36.240
As thanks for saving his son,

02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:37.700
Tong gives you the grenade launcher,

02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:41.460
a powerful and fun weapon you have two levels left to use.

02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:42.960
This is genius right here.

02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:46.460

The trailer for this pre-order bonus

02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:52.720
uses footage of the weapons in levels

02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:55.460
you can never use it in because you get it so late.

02:03:55.460 --> 02:03:57.960
I wouldn't go as far as to call this false advertising.

02:03:57.960 --> 02:04:00.340
Who cares? But it's funny the most powerful weapons

02:04:00.340 --> 02:04:01.640
are consistently given to you

02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:03.600
after all the best spots to use them.

02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:06.100
Fun fact, I was born and raised in West Yorkshire,

02:04:06.100 --> 02:04:07.940
which is my way of saying when this game came out,

02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:09.140
I was extremely poor.

02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:11.620
I only got to play it because a French friend of mine

02:04:11.620 --> 02:04:13.780
who really loved Deus Ex had pre-ordered it

02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:16.340
because he wanted that DLC and I think a statue

02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:18.720
of Adam Jensen that came with some versions of the game,

02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:20.380
and then because he was a game critic

02:04:20.380 --> 02:04:22.300
or worked at a related company or something,

02:04:22.300 --> 02:04:24.300
he got given a free copy he didn't need

02:04:24.300 --> 02:04:25.500
and he gave it to me.

02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:27.420
So if you're watching this, thanks, Thomas.

02:04:27.420 --> 02:04:29.880
I wouldn't have got to play this game for years otherwise.

02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:32.100
I'm glad I finally have the opportunity to thank you

02:04:32.100 --> 02:04:34.800
in the middle of a YouTube video a decade later.

02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:36.980
Pre-order bonuses and the microtransactions

02:04:36.980 --> 02:04:39.280
they later became are bad for everyone.

02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:41.480
They're bad for players, they're bad for developers

02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:44.060
getting made to do things they know are bad for the game,

02:04:44.060 --> 02:04:45.820
and then having to listen to people like me

02:04:45.820 --> 02:04:47.740
whining about it like it's their fault.

02:04:47.740 --> 02:04:49.360
The only people who benefit

02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:51.020
are the people this makes money for,

02:04:51.020 --> 02:04:54.020
which means it's probably not going away anytime soon.

02:04:54.020 --> 02:04:55.860
But at some point, you know,

02:04:55.860 --> 02:04:57.820
games have to make money.

The level design of Immersive Sims

02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:43.880
is one of the most important parts.

02:05:43.880 --> 02:05:45.420
You can have all the cool guns

02:05:45.420 --> 02:05:47.080
and augmentations in the world,

02:05:47.080 --> 02:05:49.580
but if that world doesn't create fun opportunities

for using them, then those tools are going to waste,

02:05:52.120 --> 02:05:54.660
like the instant pot in the back of your cupboard right now.

02:05:54.660 --> 02:05:56.660
You also have to find ways of making the player

02:05:56.660 --> 02:05:58.160
engage with the levels, for example,

02:05:58.160 --> 02:06:00.660
by giving rewards for bothering to explore.

02:06:00.660 --> 02:06:04.160
You want constant rewards to drive players onward, okay?

02:06:04.160 --> 02:06:06.160
You have to reward players regularly.

02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:08.420
It's a bit of a disappointment in this department.

02:06:08.420 --> 02:06:10.160
Half the stuff you'd normally be searching for

02:06:10.160 --> 02:06:12.500
in a Deus Ex game isn't there to find

02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:14.160
because scarcity was too important

02:06:14.160 --> 02:06:15.660
to give you too many big rewards

02:06:15.660 --> 02:06:17.160
and there are no longer multi-tools

02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:19.880
or lockpicks to find because the newfound omnipresence

02:06:19.880 --> 02:06:21.660
of hacking has replaced the need for them.

02:06:21.660 --> 02:06:23.660
The main thing you'll find when you're exploring

02:06:23.660 --> 02:06:26.420
is a couple of bullets, a meager amount of credits

02:06:26.420 --> 02:06:28.160
which you can't spend on anything,

02:06:28.160 --> 02:06:29.420
oh, and how can I forget,

02:06:29.420 --> 02:06:31.420
dozens upon dozens of energy bars

02:06:31.420 --> 02:06:33.660
which you don't need because the first battery

02:06:33.660 --> 02:06:36.160
refills on its own, and since, like we covered earlier,

02:06:36.160 --> 02:06:38.660
Praxis points are a kind of boring upgrade system,

02:06:38.660 --> 02:06:40.660
there are no truly nice surprises

02:06:40.660 --> 02:06:42.660
that incentivize further exploration.

02:06:42.660 --> 02:06:45.660
You barely find anything in a police station armory.

02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:47.420
You're not going to find much in the back alleys

02:06:47.420 --> 02:06:48.660
of Detroit or Hengsha.

02:06:48.660 --> 02:06:50.960
What is here feels a little too similar

02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:52.660
to the original for its own good.

02:06:52.660 --> 02:06:53.660
At a certain point,

02:06:53.660 --> 02:06:55.660
it starts to feel like a half-hearted remake.

02:06:55.660 --> 02:06:58.160
Like, even in shockingly small details

02:06:58.160 --> 02:07:00.160
like how you and your pilot get intercepted

02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:01.160
on your way to China

02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:02.660
or how your pilot can optionally die

02:07:02.660 --> 02:07:04.660
or how the first mission ends with you deciding

02:07:04.660 --> 02:07:06.660
whether or not to let a terrorist leader live

02:07:06.660 --> 02:07:07.660
and as soon as you make that choice,

02:07:07.660 --> 02:07:09.160
the cops instantly arrive

02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:10.660
and all the enemies in the level evaporate

02:07:10.660 --> 02:07:12.160
and get replaced by cops

02:07:12.160 --> 02:07:14.660
or how you fight exactly three augmented bosses

02:07:14.660 --> 02:07:17.160
throughout the game, a big guy, a small lady,

02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:19.160
and a guy who can turn invisible

02:07:19.160 --> 02:07:20.660
and wields a plasma rifle

02:07:20.660 --> 02:07:22.660
or the way the game's three main locations

02:07:22.660 --> 02:07:24.660
are an American city, a Chinese city,

02:07:24.660 --> 02:07:25.660
and a French city

02:07:25.660 --> 02:07:26.660
although Human Revolution

02:07:26.660 --> 02:07:28.160
sets its French part in Montreal

02:07:28.160 --> 02:07:29.660
for what I assume are tax reasons

02:07:29.660 --> 02:07:32.160
and the city environment itself got cut

02:07:32.160 --> 02:07:34.660
so Montreal is just a large office building

02:07:34.660 --> 02:07:36.660
you land on and then leave.

02:07:36.660 --> 02:07:39.160
For the record, in the Q&A section of his GDC talk,

02:07:39.160 --> 02:07:40.660
Lapicus got asked if he thought

02:07:40.660 --> 02:07:42.660
the generally good reception of Human Revolution

02:07:42.660 --> 02:07:44.660
was partially down to them directly recreating

02:07:44.660 --> 02:07:46.160
a lot of the original's stuff.

02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:48.660
It follows the original Deus Ex

02:07:48.660 --> 02:07:52.160
almost act for act, story beat for story beat.

02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:54.160
I'm wondering how much you feel

02:07:54.160 --> 02:07:56.660
that contributed to the acceptance of it.

02:07:56.660 --> 02:07:58.160
First off, I'd like to react to your comment

02:07:58.160 --> 02:08:00.660
that the game follows the first game beat by beat.

02:08:00.660 --> 02:08:02.160
It might be true.

02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:03.660
It wasn't our intention.

02:08:03.660 --> 02:08:05.160
It's not how we designed the game.

02:08:05.160 --> 02:08:06.660
It's not how it was written.

02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:09.160
So if that's the case, it's a coincidence.

02:08:09.160 --> 02:08:10.660
I don't know if it's better or worse

02:08:10.660 --> 02:08:12.660
the game was like this by accident

02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:14.160
but that's what the game is like

02:08:14.160 --> 02:08:15.660
so I don't know what to tell you.

02:08:15.660 --> 02:08:17.160
It's not a huge deal that they're similar.

02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:18.660
It's the same series,

02:08:18.660 --> 02:08:20.160
so similarities are welcome if anything,

02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:23.160
but a problem with, accidentally or otherwise,

02:08:23.160 --> 02:08:25.160
making your levels a lot like the originals

02:08:25.160 --> 02:08:27.160
is it makes what's missing stick out

02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:29.660
like a giant robot sitting next to the weapon

02:08:29.660 --> 02:08:31.160
that instantly kills it.

02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:33.660
Liberty Island is a famously amazing level.

02:08:33.660 --> 02:08:36.660
It's an entire open island with two different docks,

02:08:36.660 --> 02:08:39.660
people to talk to to get a key to get inside if you want.

02:08:39.660 --> 02:08:41.160
About time you sh**.

02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:43.160
A sunken freighter full of stuff to find,

02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:44.660
and of course an entire building

02:08:44.660 --> 02:08:46.160
leading up into the Statue of Liberty.

02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:48.160
This level design is ultimately

02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:50.660
why Deus Ex is so fantastic.

02:08:50.660 --> 02:08:52.660
It feels like an entire physical space

02:08:52.660 --> 02:08:54.160
you can handle how you want.

02:08:54.160 --> 02:08:56.660
Liberty Island is 12 different levels

02:08:56.660 --> 02:08:58.660
depending on how someone plays it.

02:08:58.660 --> 02:09:01.160
Human Revolution's levels are largely a straight line

02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:03.660
that sometimes opens out into a larger box

02:09:03.660 --> 02:09:05.160
you can be a little more creative in

02:09:05.160 --> 02:09:07.660
which funnels right back into another straight line.

02:09:07.660 --> 02:09:10.160
The first mission, the parallel with Liberty Island,

02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:12.660
is a straight shot from the drop-off point on a rooftop

02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:14.660
to a pickup on another rooftop

02:09:14.660 --> 02:09:16.660
featuring bottlenecks in the form of corridors

02:09:16.660 --> 02:09:18.660
and elevators that you're required to use

02:09:18.660 --> 02:09:21.660
to progress with zero alternatives.

02:09:21.660 --> 02:09:23.660
Compare and contrast the level of freedom here.

02:09:23.660 --> 02:09:25.660
The Statue of Liberty has several ways in

02:09:25.660 --> 02:09:27.660
from different angles including just climbing

02:09:27.660 --> 02:09:29.160
over half the level.

02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:30.660
To get into the warehouse, you can go in

02:09:30.660 --> 02:09:32.660
through the front door or climb up on top

02:09:32.660 --> 02:09:34.660
of the entrance and go in through a vent

02:09:34.660 --> 02:09:36.660
just above the front door which comes out

02:09:36.660 --> 02:09:39.660
into the other side of the same room.

02:09:39.660 --> 02:09:41.660
It takes about five seconds to walk over here

02:09:41.660 --> 02:09:43.660
if you come in from the front entrance.

02:09:43.660 --> 02:09:45.160
There is no rear entrance,

02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:47.160
and there's no way over this part of the level

02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:48.660
by getting on the plant's roof

02:09:48.660 --> 02:09:50.160
and finding another entryway.

02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:52.660
It's immediately clear how much less freedom

02:09:52.660 --> 02:09:53.660
the player has.

02:09:53.660 --> 02:09:55.160
There are choices in how to navigate,

02:09:55.160 --> 02:09:56.660
but they don't lead anywhere

02:09:56.660 --> 02:09:58.660
particularly new or different.

02:09:58.660 --> 02:10:00.660
The only way to progress is to traverse the level

02:10:00.660 --> 02:10:02.660
mostly linearly, but occasionally,

02:10:02.660 --> 02:10:05.660
you get to decide which side of the room you do it in.

02:10:05.660 --> 02:10:08.160
The smoking gun betraying the closed-off nature

02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:11.160
of the levels is the fact none of the windows work.

02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:15.660
In Deus Ex 1, if a building has a window,

02:10:15.660 --> 02:10:17.660
you can break the window and jump out.

02:10:17.660 --> 02:10:19.660
Bang, you just invented a new exit.

02:10:19.660 --> 02:10:22.160
In many of Human Revolution's buildings,

02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:24.160
most of the windows are actually painted on

02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:26.160
and you can't get out through them in any way.

02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:28.160
In an actual immersive sim,

02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:30.160
this would be a way in and out of the building.

02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:32.160
That's what makes it immersive.

02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:34.160
It feels like a building in a world.

02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:36.160
This is just a rectangular corridor

02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:39.660
with windows used to imply a complicated outside world

02:10:39.660 --> 02:10:41.160
you never get to interact with.

02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:43.160
Look at Jensen's apartment for a second.

02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:45.160
The modern graphics definitely make it look

02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:46.660
cooler than the original.

02:10:46.660 --> 02:10:49.160
I love the Blade Runner light shaft thing with the blinds,

02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:50.660
but in the original game's apartment,

02:10:50.660 --> 02:10:52.660
you don't need to come in through the front door.

02:10:52.660 --> 02:10:55.160
You can climb up a fire escape and come in through the window.

02:10:55.160 --> 02:10:57.660
Jensen's apartment is designed to reference the original.

02:10:57.660 --> 02:11:00.160
It's got a cute stash of loot hidden in a similar way,

02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:01.660
but it doesn't seem to understand

02:11:01.660 --> 02:11:04.660
the actual gameplay value of the original apartment's design.

02:11:04.660 --> 02:11:06.660
The only way out is to get to the elevator,

02:11:06.660 --> 02:11:09.660
ride it down, then walk out through the front door.

02:11:09.660 --> 02:11:11.660
The windows are just for show.

02:11:11.660 --> 02:11:14.160
I've heard so much praise for this game over the years,

02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:16.160
how it's one of the best immersive sims,

02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:18.160
a real successor to Deus Ex,

02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:19.660
but for all the genuine improvements

02:11:19.660 --> 02:11:21.660
and understandable mechanical changes,

02:11:21.660 --> 02:11:24.660
the levels you're doing it in are restrictive and dull.

02:11:24.660 --> 02:11:27.160
So much of the game is effectively a linear path

02:11:27.160 --> 02:11:30.660
which leads to an elevator to the next linear path.

02:11:30.660 --> 02:11:32.160
Seriously, there are so many areas

02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:35.160
whose main objective is to get to an elevator.

02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:37.160
There's a part in Hengsha where you do a whole level

02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:38.660
to get to an elevator,

02:11:38.660 --> 02:11:40.160
and then while you're in the elevator,

02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:42.160
Pritchard calls you to give you your next objective.

02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:44.660
Pritchard, I'm in an elevator leading to the bangoo.

02:11:44.660 --> 02:11:46.660
Look for a second elevator once you're there.

02:11:46.660 --> 02:11:49.160
The game is so fond of making elevators

02:11:49.160 --> 02:11:51.160
the path to the next area that there is not one,

02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:53.160
not two, but five sequences

02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:56.160
where you go on a really long, slow elevator ride

02:11:56.160 --> 02:11:58.160
and if you're lucky, something interesting

02:11:58.160 --> 02:11:59.660
is happening out the window

02:11:59.660 --> 02:12:01.160
or a character calls you on the phone.

02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:03.660
Seriously, you just sit in an elevator

02:12:03.660 --> 02:12:07.160
for a full minute for no reason multiple times.

02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:09.160
Once would be fine to build tension

02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:10.660
before a big boss fight or something,

02:12:10.660 --> 02:12:12.160
but it's near constant.

02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:14.160
You ride two different elevators

02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:16.660
in the unskippable opening sequence alone.

Since combat is pretty easy,

02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:35.660
especially if you hack the turret,

02:12:35.660 --> 02:12:37.160
enemies don't know how to handle turrets

02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:38.660
in the slightest. It's really weird.

of disguising loading between areas,

02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:21.660
but many of them last much longer

02:13:21.660 --> 02:13:24.160

I think the reason they made them like this

02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:42.660
was for dramatic effect.

02:13:42.660 --> 02:13:44.660
When you sit in an elevator to Upper Hengsha

02:13:44.660 --> 02:13:47.160
for 30 actual seconds and come out

02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:49.160
and suddenly you're at the top of a high-rise building

02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:50.660
overlooking a new environment,

02:13:50.660 --> 02:13:52.160
one you never get to actually visit,

02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:54.160
you feel like you did a lot more

02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:56.160
than walk down a linear corridor

02:13:56.160 --> 02:13:58.160
to an elevator...twice.

02:13:58.160 --> 02:14:00.660
Look what an expansive world we're in.

02:14:00.660 --> 02:14:01.660
The objective of this level?

02:14:01.660 --> 02:14:03.660
To get to the data core room

02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:05.660
by getting to the elevator.

02:14:05.660 --> 02:14:07.660
Then you're given a cut scene where your objective

02:14:07.660 --> 02:14:09.660
changes to confronting Zhao Yunru,

02:14:09.660 --> 02:14:11.660
the CEO from before, to have that cut scene.

02:14:11.660 --> 02:14:14.660
You confront her by getting to another elevator

02:14:14.660 --> 02:14:15.660
to her penthouse.

02:14:15.660 --> 02:14:18.160
This elevator trip takes a full minute.

02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:21.160
This is only the third longest eleva-

02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:23.160
The current Human Revolution speedrun

02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:26.160
by Rampancy is 37 minutes long.

02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:28.160
Eight and a half minutes of the run

02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:30.160
is spent in an elevator.

02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:33.160
Uncomfortably close to a quarter of this speedrun

02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:35.160
is sitting and waiting,

02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:37.160
and this is the best-case scenario.

02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:39.160
This guy does cool shit like skip waiting

02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:41.160
for that one elevator by shoving himself through the door.

02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:43.160
In fact, most of the run's cleverest tricks

02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:45.160
involve throwing himself through the door

02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:47.160
In fact, most of the run's cleverest tricks

02:14:47.160 --> 02:14:49.160
involve finding ways to avoid

02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:51.160
having to wait in an elevator even longer.

02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:53.160
The time wasted here isn't even the real problem.

02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:55.160
Where the original game's levels

02:14:55.160 --> 02:14:57.160
were usually large outdoor spaces

02:14:57.160 --> 02:14:59.160
with multiple ways in and out of the buildings

02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:00.160
with objectives in them,

02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:02.160
encouraging player creativity

02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:03.160
and freedom of choice,

02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:06.160
Human Revolution is wandering between elevators

02:15:06.160 --> 02:15:08.160
with ornate windows overlooking

02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:09.160
the kinds of environment

02:15:09.160 --> 02:15:11.160
you'd actually want to be playing in.

02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:13.160
The level design still has some choice in it,

02:15:13.160 --> 02:15:15.160
and occasionally the kinds of freedom

02:15:15.160 --> 02:15:17.160
you'd really want like the police station,

02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:19.160
which is great and offers a fantastic range of choices

02:15:19.160 --> 02:15:20.160
for how to deal with it,

02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:21.160
but a majority of the game

02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:24.160
is strangely compartmentalized, constrained,

02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:26.160
a thin tube funneling you

02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:28.160
to the next important cut scene.

02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:30.160
I know I'm venting a lot about those cut scenes,

02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:32.160
but this gives me an excellent opportunity

02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:35.160
to segue into this game's problem with vents.

02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:38.160
Okay, in this sequence I've shown you a few times before,

02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:40.160
there's four guys making patrols around this area,

02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:42.160
more guys off in the side halls,

02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:44.160
and a doorway leading ahead to the next part of the level,

02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:46.160
but this area that's harder to get to unseen

02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:48.160
is the room the hostages are in.

02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:50.160
Once you get inside, you're locked in by a trap

02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:52.160
and have to frantically disarm the bomb

02:15:52.160 --> 02:15:53.160
by hacking it or learning the password

02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:55.160
or just smashing the tubes,

02:15:55.160 --> 02:15:57.160
which is a hilarious thing to discover you can do.

02:15:57.160 --> 02:15:58.160
This is a great sequence.

02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:00.160
Getting into this room and saving the hostages

02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:02.160
is the first level's optional challenging

02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:03.160
secondary objective,

02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:05.160
and the people who designed the stealth system

02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:07.160
and guard patrols act like it.

02:16:07.160 --> 02:16:09.160
It's much harder to stealth your way in here

02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:10.160
than the critical path.

02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:12.160
I mean, if you shoot all the guys,

02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:13.160
it's easy and bullshit,

02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:14.160
but you can see how the stealth

02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:15.160
was designed to be fun,

02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:17.160
so you can do all of that,

02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:18.160
all that fun learning the patrols

02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:20.160
and carefully navigating,

02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:22.160
or you can go in the vent next to the entrance to the room,

02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:25.160
which leads directly into the room with the hostages.

02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:28.160
Now, this first one kind of works.

02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:30.160
It's a reward for exploration.

02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:32.160
You have to find the vent hidden behind a box,

02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:33.160
so if you're doing this,

02:16:33.160 --> 02:16:35.160
it means you chose to look around a little more

02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:36.160
and get a sense of your surroundings.

02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:38.160
I'm not a big fan of how the vent

02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:40.160
is a definitive solution to the problem, though.

02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:43.160
In Deus Ex, vents were like vents.

02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:44.160
You could use them to your advantage,

02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:46.160
but they never took you directly

02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:47.160
from the start of the room

02:16:47.160 --> 02:16:49.160
to the place you needed to go to win.

02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:50.160
In the subway, for example,

02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:52.160
to free the hostages using stealth,

02:16:52.160 --> 02:16:53.160
you had to find a vent

02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:54.160
and then meticulously crawl through

02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:56.160
an entire ventilation system

02:16:56.160 --> 02:16:57.160
and come out of the right one

02:16:57.160 --> 02:16:59.160
so you wouldn't get seen instantly.

02:16:59.160 --> 02:17:01.160
The vents were part of the challenge,

02:17:01.160 --> 02:17:02.160
not the solution.

02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:04.160
In this game, more often than not,

02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:07.160
vents take you directly past the problem.

02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:09.160
You could deal with the guys in the next area

02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:11.160
using stealth or combat,

02:17:11.160 --> 02:17:13.160
or you can go in the vent next to where you came in

02:17:13.160 --> 02:17:14.160
that takes you past them.

02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:15.160
You could.

02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:16.160
Oh, fucking hell, guys.

02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:17.160
You see the vent here

02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:18.160
before you even see the thing

02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:19.160
the vent takes you past.

02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:21.160
You could deal with this turret

02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:22.160
and landmine on the wall

02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:24.160
and camera which will set off the alarms

02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:26.160
or go over here and hack the camera.

02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:28.160
You know, the intended challenge of the room.

02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:29.160
The point of this room is to show you

02:17:29.160 --> 02:17:30.160
the value of hacking.

02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:32.160
Or you could get in the vent

02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:33.160
that leads directly behind all of it

02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:35.160
and just walk past.

02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:36.160
If being able to kill everyone

02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:38.160
easily hurt the game's design,

02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:39.160
being able to just get in a vent

02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:40.160
and go past all of it

02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:42.160
fucking executes it behind the woodshed.

02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:44.160
Look, maybe I'm smarter than the average gang

02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:46.160
of anti-augmentation terrorists,

02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:48.160
but whoever set this shit up

02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:49.160
must have seen the vent, right?

02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:50.160
Wait a second.

02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:52.160
Why didn't the hostages just go in the vent?

02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:53.160
Just leave through the vent.

02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:54.160
What the fuck are you doing?

02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:55.160
This is how,

02:17:55.160 --> 02:17:57.160
and I'm going to make a conservative estimate,

02:17:57.160 --> 02:18:00.160
85,000% of the game's levels work.

02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:01.160
There's this one level in Hengsha

02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:03.160
where the bad guys have locked down

02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:04.160
an apartment complex

02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:05.160
and you have to get inside

02:18:05.160 --> 02:18:06.160
to get to the hacker's computer

02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:07.160
I mentioned before.

02:18:07.160 --> 02:18:09.160
Now, the front entrance is blocked off,

02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:11.160
so you either have to get into a big fight right away

02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:13.160
or maybe you can go all the way around the sides

02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:14.160
and up a ladder

02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:16.160
and then you can sneakily take out a few guys

02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:17.160
and use stealth from there.

02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:18.160
Wow, multiple paths.

02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:19.160
This level's pretty good.

02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:21.160
The developers are trying to reward you

02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:23.160
for thinking logically about the 3D space

02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:24.160
or there's a vent right here.

02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:26.160
This vent takes you inside the complex

02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:28.160
and into a well-guarded area

02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:29.160
with some interesting points of cover.

02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:31.160
This area could be a really cool stealth experience.

02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:33.160
Oh, my God, I can't believe you found another vent.

02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:35.160
You're such a good boy.

02:18:35.160 --> 02:18:37.160
This vent takes you to the upper ground level

02:18:37.160 --> 02:18:39.160
you could have had a fun time sneaking to

02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:41.160
where you can easily just walk to the elevator

02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:43.160
to the top floor without being seen.

02:18:43.160 --> 02:18:44.160
On the top floor, you...

02:18:44.160 --> 02:18:45.160
Holy shit!

02:18:45.160 --> 02:18:47.160
I haven't even left the elevator!

02:18:47.160 --> 02:18:48.160
Fucking come on, guys!

02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:50.160
This vent takes you past all the guards

02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:53.160
to directly next to the computer you need to access.

02:18:53.160 --> 02:18:56.160
This is the absolute bottom of the downward spiral

02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:58.160
that starts when you try to make a game

02:18:58.160 --> 02:18:59.160
like Deus Ex simpler.

02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:02.160
You make this how exploration works

02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:03.160
and if you go in the other side,

02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:05.160
the alternative way in I mentioned,

02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:07.160
you know where it leads?

02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:08.160
To a vent.

02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:10.160
The vent takes you up the same elevator shaft

02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:13.160
to a vent that comes out next to the other vent.

02:19:13.160 --> 02:19:15.160
This is anti-level design.

02:19:15.160 --> 02:19:17.160
You're literally skipping most of the levels

02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:18.160
that were designed.

02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:20.160
I've basically just ruined the game for you.

02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:22.160
Once you realize that's how they're using vents,

02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:23.160
you can't stop seeing it.

02:19:23.160 --> 02:19:25.160
If you fail the dialogue challenge

02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:26.160
to get an audience with Tong,

02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:28.160
you have to come back and try again

02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:29.160
to find out what he knows,

02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:31.160
but don't worry, pal, because,

02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:33.160
and I bet this'll be a surprise to you,

02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:34.160
there's a vent next to his office

02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:35.160
and it triggers a cutscene

02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:37.160
where you learn the same information anyway.

02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:39.160
This is the quest design equivalent

02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:42.160
of putting a rocket launcher next to all the hard enemies.

02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:44.160
You could talk Taggart into telling you

02:19:44.160 --> 02:19:46.160
where Sanderval is or you'll never guess.

02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:47.160
You'll never fucking guess.

02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:49.160
You'll never fucking guess!

02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:51.160
The vent drops you directly into his office

02:19:51.160 --> 02:19:53.160
next to the computer with the information on it.

02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:55.160
No thinking required.

02:19:55.160 --> 02:19:58.160
The main challenge in this level is staying awake.

02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:01.160
About time. What happened?

02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:04.160
You get stuck in an air duct on the way over?

02:20:04.160 --> 02:20:06.160
Ha ha, yeah, good one. Fuck off, Pritchard.

02:20:06.160 --> 02:20:08.160
If you think this is a good example

02:20:08.160 --> 02:20:09.160
of Deus Ex level design,

02:20:09.160 --> 02:20:11.160
you need to stop settling for less in life

02:20:11.160 --> 02:20:12.160
before it's too late.

02:20:12.160 --> 02:20:15.160
You matter and you deserve better than this.

02:20:15.160 --> 02:20:16.160
Every vent in Human Revolution,

02:20:16.160 --> 02:20:19.160
including ones in maximum security buildings

02:20:19.160 --> 02:20:21.160
that lead right to their important shit,

02:20:21.160 --> 02:20:22.160
is yours to open for free

02:20:22.160 --> 02:20:24.160
because locks don't exist anymore

02:20:24.160 --> 02:20:26.160
and locking a vent using a keypad

02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:28.160
would look really silly.

02:20:28.160 --> 02:20:30.160
Some of the level designers even realized

02:20:30.160 --> 02:20:32.160
they'd made the vents too easy a solution

02:20:32.160 --> 02:20:34.160
and started trying to hide them,

02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:36.160
which doesn't work because, you know, they glow,

02:20:36.160 --> 02:20:37.160
so they started trying to block them

02:20:37.160 --> 02:20:39.160
using heavy objects so you at least need

02:20:39.160 --> 02:20:41.160
an augmentation to get to them.

02:20:41.160 --> 02:20:43.160
Look how hard they had to work to get around the fact

02:20:43.160 --> 02:20:46.160
they couldn't just lock the vents.

02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:48.160
Why was the game built like this?

02:20:48.160 --> 02:20:49.160
I don't know.

02:20:49.160 --> 02:20:51.160
Maybe the designers had fond memories

02:20:51.160 --> 02:20:52.160
of solving problems using vents

02:20:52.160 --> 02:20:54.160
in other immersive sims and concluded

02:20:54.160 --> 02:20:56.160
that vents equal good game design,

02:20:56.160 --> 02:20:59.160
but the point was to make a world feel interconnected

02:20:59.160 --> 02:21:00.160
like a real place would be

02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:02.160
and make players who took the time to look around

02:21:02.160 --> 02:21:04.160
feel rewarded for their ingenuity

02:21:04.160 --> 02:21:05.160
or attention to detail.

02:21:05.160 --> 02:21:08.160
Vents weren't the only kind of secret in Deus Ex.

02:21:08.160 --> 02:21:10.160
There were secrets hidden all over the place,

02:21:10.160 --> 02:21:12.160
buttons hidden behind innocuous objects

02:21:12.160 --> 02:21:14.160
that unlock treasure troves of stuff,

02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:15.160
or maybe the pinball machine

02:21:15.160 --> 02:21:17.160
you've seen over half a dozen of already

02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:19.160
activates a secret door if you play with this one.

02:21:19.160 --> 02:21:22.160
These two are both in the same level even.

02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:23.160
After this happens,

02:21:23.160 --> 02:21:24.160
you'll be checking every pinball machine

02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:26.160
in the rest of the world just in case.

02:21:26.160 --> 02:21:29.160
There is nothing remotely like this in Human Revolution

02:21:29.160 --> 02:21:31.160
except for one specific thing.

02:21:31.160 --> 02:21:33.160
This stuffed animal activates the secret door

02:21:33.160 --> 02:21:35.160
into the hacker's man cave,

02:21:35.160 --> 02:21:37.160
but it's not used to discover a secret.

02:21:37.160 --> 02:21:38.160
The cave is already visible

02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:40.160
because the bad guys blew a wall down.

02:21:40.160 --> 02:21:41.160
This makes for some really cool

02:21:41.160 --> 02:21:42.160
environmental storytelling though.

02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:44.160
The Mercs couldn't find the way

02:21:44.160 --> 02:21:45.160
of opening the secret entrance,

02:21:45.160 --> 02:21:47.160
so they had to redecorate.

02:21:47.160 --> 02:21:49.160
It's funny, but serious question.

02:21:49.160 --> 02:21:52.160
Why aren't there any actual secrets like this in the game?

02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:54.160
There isn't anything even remotely as cool

02:21:54.160 --> 02:21:55.160
as the pinball machine.

02:21:55.160 --> 02:21:58.160
Instead, potential explorers get to say,

02:21:58.160 --> 02:21:59.160
I wonder what's in this room.

02:21:59.160 --> 02:22:02.160
Oh, it's a vent every few minutes.

02:22:02.160 --> 02:22:03.160
This is the vent room.

02:22:03.160 --> 02:22:05.160
Everyone has one of these in the future.

02:22:05.160 --> 02:22:07.160
It's horribly inefficient,

02:22:07.160 --> 02:22:10.160
but the powerful vent lobby won't let us change the laws.

02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:11.160
The hacker's apartment is really good

02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:13.160
at demonstrating the blandness

02:22:13.160 --> 02:22:15.160
of the new simpler level design

02:22:15.160 --> 02:22:17.160
because it's another accidental knockoff

02:22:17.160 --> 02:22:18.160
of a level from Deus Ex I,

02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:20.160
this time Maggie Chow's apartment in Hong Kong.

02:22:20.160 --> 02:22:22.160
As soon as you look at it, the difference is clear.

02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:25.160
You're not forced to hack a computer for one,

02:22:25.160 --> 02:22:26.160
but you also have more choices

02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:28.160
for how to deal with the situation.

02:22:28.160 --> 02:22:30.160
Taking the elevator or sneaking into the shaft

02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:32.160
aren't the only entrances.

02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:33.160
You can get in from the roof entrance

02:22:33.160 --> 02:22:35.160
or, you know, blow open the skylight

02:22:35.160 --> 02:22:36.160
and get in that way.

02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:38.160
You can also get in by platforming

02:22:38.160 --> 02:22:40.160
from neighboring buildings that are easier to get into

02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:42.160
and aren't guarded by mechs,

02:22:42.160 --> 02:22:43.160
and once you're done, you can leave

02:22:43.160 --> 02:22:45.160
by literally jumping off the roof

02:22:45.160 --> 02:22:47.160
or out the window and using your cyber legs

02:22:47.160 --> 02:22:48.160
to land without dying.

02:22:48.160 --> 02:22:50.160
This feels like an apartment

02:22:50.160 --> 02:22:53.160
in a real skyline full of other buildings.

02:22:53.160 --> 02:22:55.160
This feels like a corridor with a nice background

02:22:55.160 --> 02:22:57.160
outside some unbreakable windows,

02:22:57.160 --> 02:22:58.160
but hey, lookie here.

02:22:58.160 --> 02:23:00.160
There's a balcony out there.

02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:01.160
Oh, and what's this?

02:23:01.160 --> 02:23:03.160
A skylight just like Maggie Chow's apartment,

02:23:03.160 --> 02:23:05.160
but you can't do anything with them.

02:23:05.160 --> 02:23:08.160
This level has none of what made the original level

02:23:08.160 --> 02:23:09.160
truly open-ended and free.

02:23:09.160 --> 02:23:12.160
The skylight and balcony are just for show.

02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:14.160
You come in and out of this whole area

02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:15.160
through one of two entryways

02:23:15.160 --> 02:23:17.160
which are next to each other.

02:23:17.160 --> 02:23:20.160
Sophie's choice, a vent or an elevator.

02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:22.160
No, wait, there's actually a super secret way in.

02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:24.160
If you stack boxes and have the high jump power,

02:23:24.160 --> 02:23:26.160
you can get into this higher level of the shaft

02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:27.160
above the vent.

02:23:27.160 --> 02:23:29.160
It leads to another vent.

02:23:29.160 --> 02:23:31.160
It comes out right next to the other vents

02:23:31.160 --> 02:23:32.160
and the elevator.

02:23:32.160 --> 02:23:34.160
♪ ♪

02:23:34.160 --> 02:23:35.160
Level design!

02:23:35.160 --> 02:23:38.160
The design is so ridiculously oversimplified

02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:40.160
that it actually messes with the story and quests

02:23:40.160 --> 02:23:43.160
the game is trying to use the levels for.

02:23:43.160 --> 02:23:44.160
In the Hengsha level, for example,

02:23:44.160 --> 02:23:46.160
to progress to the next mission,

02:23:46.160 --> 02:23:48.160
you have to get into the employee entrance

02:23:48.160 --> 02:23:49.160
of Taiyong Medical,

02:23:49.160 --> 02:23:51.160
but the entrance is, guess what,

02:23:51.160 --> 02:23:53.160
the only building in the universe

02:23:53.160 --> 02:23:55.160
that isn't locked using the same fucking keypad

02:23:55.160 --> 02:23:56.160
so you can't hack it.

02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:59.160
The developers realized players could just leave the hub

02:23:59.160 --> 02:24:01.160
and go to the next level if they knew where to go

02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:03.160
so they had to reinvent the concept of the key.

02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:05.160
Once the player learns that's where they have to go,

02:24:05.160 --> 02:24:08.160
they're sent on a quest to find a Taiyong Medical key card

02:24:08.160 --> 02:24:09.160
to get in here.

02:24:09.160 --> 02:24:11.160
However, because the world map is so empty

02:24:11.160 --> 02:24:13.160
and there aren't that many places to explore,

02:24:13.160 --> 02:24:15.160
most players found it already by accident

02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:16.160
several hours ago.

02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:18.160
Well, what do you know, windmill?

02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:20.160
I've already got an employee card.

02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:22.160
You begin the Hengsha level right outside this hotel,

02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:24.160
and since most players explore the thing

02:24:24.160 --> 02:24:26.160
put right in front of them, they go inside.

02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:29.160
When inside, you find one of the game's four side quests,

02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:31.160
so it's good they made it easy to find.

02:24:31.160 --> 02:24:33.160
The key card it'll turn out you need in a few hours

02:24:33.160 --> 02:24:35.160
is just sitting on a table nearby.

02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:38.160
Less than a minute's walk from the start of the level,

02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:41.160
you have already accidentally skipped part of it.

02:24:41.160 --> 02:24:43.160
There's even a special dialogue between Jensen and Malek

02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:45.160
for picking it up before you know you'll need it

02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:46.160
for anything.

02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:47.160
Tell me something, Malek.

02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:50.160
You think a smart card with a Taiyong Medical logo on it

02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:52.160
will come in handy in this town?

02:24:52.160 --> 02:24:54.160
Maybe. Why are you asking?

02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:56.160
No reason. Just thinking ahead.

02:24:56.160 --> 02:24:58.160
Hey, looks like I've accidentally beaten

02:24:58.160 --> 02:25:00.160
a later quest by walking into the building

02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:02.160
next to where you dropped me off, Malek.

02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:03.160
Whoops.

02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:05.160
Who takes their company key card out of their wallet

02:25:05.160 --> 02:25:07.160
and puts it on the fucking coffee table like that?

02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:08.160
What the fuck is this?

02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:10.160
Now, I love the idea of being sent on a quest

02:25:10.160 --> 02:25:11.160
to find a key card,

02:25:11.160 --> 02:25:12.160
which you could have found way earlier.

02:25:12.160 --> 02:25:15.160
That's great, but levels this simplistic

02:25:15.160 --> 02:25:17.160
mean you aren't actually finding it early

02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:18.160
if you're big on exploring.

02:25:18.160 --> 02:25:21.160
You're finding it immediately within minutes of starting

02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:23.160
if you take a passing interest in your surroundings.

02:25:23.160 --> 02:25:26.160
Now, let's add one extra layer of silliness to this

02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:28.160
because before you find out you need that key card,

02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:31.160
your mission requires you to get to Tong in the Hive.

02:25:31.160 --> 02:25:33.160
To get into the Hive, you need to talk your way in

02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:35.160
or bribe the guy at the door

02:25:35.160 --> 02:25:38.160
or somehow gain access to someone's membership card.

02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:40.160
The membership card is one floor down

02:25:40.160 --> 02:25:42.160
in the same building with the other key card.

02:25:42.160 --> 02:25:43.160
Why are you asking?

02:25:43.160 --> 02:25:44.160
No reason.

02:25:44.160 --> 02:25:46.160
Just thinking ahead.

02:25:46.160 --> 02:25:50.160
A shockingly huge amount of players

02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:52.160
are going to find these items long before

02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:54.160
they even know what they do.

02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:56.160
That's not clever sequence breaking.

02:25:56.160 --> 02:25:59.160
That's a very poorly designed sequence.

02:25:59.160 --> 02:26:01.160
Oh, but if you don't find the membership card

02:26:01.160 --> 02:26:03.160
and don't have the money to get in, no problem.

02:26:03.160 --> 02:26:05.160
There's a fucking vent around the back

02:26:05.160 --> 02:26:06.160
leading right inside.

02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:08.160
The more enclosed levels mean a lot of the game's

02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:10.160
augmentations and abilities aren't as fun

02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:12.160
as they easily could have been.

02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:14.160
In Deus Ex, having the ability to fall a large distance

02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:17.160
without dying changed the shape of the world for you.

02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:20.160
Rooftops were now exits that prevented having to deal

02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:23.160
with enemies you'd have run into taking the normal way down.

02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:26.160
Human Revolution's slow fall power would work the same way

02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:28.160
except for the fact the levels aren't designed

02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:29.160
as interesting 3D spaces,

02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:32.160
so only a select few places offer this type of situation.

02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:35.160
So instead, to make the augmentation more useful

02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:37.160
than the design can properly accommodate,

02:26:37.160 --> 02:26:39.160
long falls are added specifically for players

02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:41.160
to have something to do with that power,

02:26:41.160 --> 02:26:43.160
like this elevator shaft in Detroit.

02:26:43.160 --> 02:26:46.160
The game is going, look, one specific place

02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:47.160
for you to use your powers.

02:26:47.160 --> 02:26:49.160
You're so creative!

02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:51.160
Instead of making a world where creative players

02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:53.160
naturally benefited from having this ability.

02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:56.160
There is an example of the kind of free-form use

02:26:56.160 --> 02:26:58.160
of a building's height as an entrance in the game, though.

02:26:58.160 --> 02:27:01.160
Unfortunately, it's in a cut scene.

02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:03.160
Bell Tower break into the Alice Garden pods

02:27:03.160 --> 02:27:05.160
through the ceiling once you bring the key card

02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:06.160
to the hacker.

02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:09.160
NPCs get to have more fun with your powers than you do.

02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:12.160
You can only enter and leave this entire pod hotel

02:27:12.160 --> 02:27:13.160
through the front door.

02:27:13.160 --> 02:27:15.160
There is no alternative way in.

02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:17.160
This is because they want you to be unable to leave

02:27:17.160 --> 02:27:19.160
when these guys drop in and block off the exit,

02:27:19.160 --> 02:27:21.160
forcing you to leave through, you guessed it,

02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:23.160
a series of linear corridors with vents

02:27:23.160 --> 02:27:25.160
skipping any of the difficult parts,

02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:28.160
leading to a new back exit which only now opened up.

02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:30.160
The experience you do have is pretty fun

02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:31.160
for what it is, sure,

02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:34.160
but this simply isn't how Deus Ex levels should work.

02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:36.160
Oh!

02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:37.160
Oh!

02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:38.160
Oh!

02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:39.160
Oh!

02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:40.160
Oh!

02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:41.160
Oh!

02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:42.160
Oh!

02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:43.160
Oh!

02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:44.160
Oh!

02:27:44.160 --> 02:27:45.160
Oh!

02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:46.160
Oh!

02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:47.160
Oh!

02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:51.160
My problem with this design is it doesn't let players

02:27:51.160 --> 02:27:53.160
be clever by themselves.

02:27:53.160 --> 02:27:55.160
It's contingent on a game designer giving you

02:27:55.160 --> 02:27:57.160
something clever to do with it.

02:27:57.160 --> 02:27:59.160
If they forget to come up with some,

02:27:59.160 --> 02:28:02.160
which they often do, you're shit out of luck, Buddy Boy.

02:28:02.160 --> 02:28:05.160
Without tall buildings with rooftop entrances and exits,

02:28:05.160 --> 02:28:07.160
apart from literally one in the warehouses

02:28:07.160 --> 02:28:09.160
I didn't forget, don't be a pedant,

02:28:09.160 --> 02:28:11.160
the Icarus landing system is reduced

02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:13.160
from a fantastic addition to the player's arsenal

02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:15.160
to a slightly faster alternative

02:28:15.160 --> 02:28:17.160
to taking the ladder down certain drops

02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:19.160
and only slightly faster because the falling animation

02:28:19.160 --> 02:28:21.160
is slow and annoying.

02:28:21.160 --> 02:28:23.160
The other big augmentation that gets wasted here

02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:25.160
is the ability to punch through certain walls.

02:28:25.160 --> 02:28:27.160
This powers a really interesting idea,

02:28:27.160 --> 02:28:29.160
opening up new paths by cutting through

02:28:29.160 --> 02:28:31.160
destructible parts of the level,

02:28:31.160 --> 02:28:33.160
and it only gets to be fun in practice

02:28:33.160 --> 02:28:35.160
if the developers come up with interesting ways of using it.

02:28:35.160 --> 02:28:37.160
It feels like they made a lot of the levels

02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:39.160
and then went, oh, shit,

02:28:39.160 --> 02:28:41.160
and tried to add a bunch of punchable walls

02:28:41.160 --> 02:28:43.160
at the last second so players who got it

02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:45.160
feel like they can do something with it.

02:28:45.160 --> 02:28:48.160
Wait, what's this window showing if the room is that small?

02:28:48.160 --> 02:28:50.160
What is going on here?

02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:52.160
I could be wrong, but I have a sneaking suspicion

02:28:52.160 --> 02:28:54.160
this wall was added a bit late.

02:28:54.160 --> 02:28:57.160
You want to know a cool thing about doors in Deus Ex?

02:28:57.160 --> 02:28:59.160
Wow, Deus Ex is such a cool game

02:28:59.160 --> 02:29:01.160
that I'm about to enjoy telling you how doors work.

02:29:01.160 --> 02:29:03.160
Doors weren't just a thing you could access

02:29:03.160 --> 02:29:06.160
by finding keys or learning the code to a keypad

02:29:06.160 --> 02:29:08.160
or by hacking the computer it was hooked up to

02:29:08.160 --> 02:29:10.160
or by learning the password some other way

02:29:10.160 --> 02:29:12.160
or by picking them.

02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:14.160
They were also physical, actual doors,

02:29:14.160 --> 02:29:16.160
which means you could just destroy them.

02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:21.160
The rocket launcher is nature's lockpick.

02:29:21.160 --> 02:29:23.160
That's so many options,

02:29:23.160 --> 02:29:25.160
and being able to just break the door

02:29:25.160 --> 02:29:27.160
is believable and adds to the feeling

02:29:28.160 --> 02:29:30.160
You can destroy doors in Human Revolution

02:29:30.160 --> 02:29:32.160
if you have a grenade or a lot of bullets,

02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:35.160
though the scarcity of resources makes this a bit of a waste.

02:29:35.160 --> 02:29:37.160
The mechanic is implemented horribly.

02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:40.160
Locked doors don't show you how much health they have

02:29:40.160 --> 02:29:42.160
or even indicate they can be damaged

02:29:42.160 --> 02:29:44.160
until they suddenly shatter into dust.

02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:47.160
♪ ♪

02:29:49.160 --> 02:29:52.160
You can see a door's health once it's unlocked,

02:29:52.160 --> 02:29:54.160
as in once you can just open it

02:29:54.160 --> 02:29:56.160
and its health is totally irrelevant.

02:29:56.160 --> 02:29:58.160
You can also break open vents,

02:29:58.160 --> 02:30:01.160
which, let me remind you, are literally never locked,

02:30:01.160 --> 02:30:03.160
making it pointless to ever do so.

02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:05.160
I bet most people didn't even notice

02:30:05.160 --> 02:30:07.160
you could do this because who cares?

02:30:07.160 --> 02:30:09.160
It never serves any purpose.

02:30:09.160 --> 02:30:11.160
Something I thought was really funny was apartments

02:30:11.160 --> 02:30:13.160
in China have these sliding doors,

02:30:13.160 --> 02:30:14.160
and you can break them open easily.

02:30:14.160 --> 02:30:16.160
They're flimsy, you know,

02:30:16.160 --> 02:30:18.160
but when they're open, they become invincible.

02:30:22.160 --> 02:30:24.160
This doesn't massively affect the gameplay,

02:30:24.160 --> 02:30:26.160
but it goes a long way in showing how little thought

02:30:26.160 --> 02:30:29.160
went into what used to be a really good mechanic.

02:30:29.160 --> 02:30:31.160
Tons of things which were breakable in the original

02:30:31.160 --> 02:30:32.160
can't be now.

02:30:32.160 --> 02:30:34.160
Safes are indestructible,

02:30:34.160 --> 02:30:36.160
so you have to know the code or hack,

02:30:36.160 --> 02:30:38.160
and the many storage units in the game

02:30:38.160 --> 02:30:39.160
are immune to damage as well.

02:30:39.160 --> 02:30:41.160
This reduces the player's available options

02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:43.160
in addition to making it impossible

02:30:43.160 --> 02:30:45.160
to even know if anything is destructible

02:30:45.160 --> 02:30:47.160
because most of the time it isn't.

02:30:47.160 --> 02:30:49.160
The first time I tried to blow down a locked door,

02:30:49.160 --> 02:30:51.160
the grenade straight up didn't work for some reason,

02:30:51.160 --> 02:30:53.160
and since I had no way of knowing

02:30:54.160 --> 02:30:57.160
I assumed locked doors couldn't be destroyed for ages

02:30:57.160 --> 02:30:59.160
until I tried again just to double check

02:30:59.160 --> 02:31:01.160
while I was writing the script for this video.

02:31:01.160 --> 02:31:02.160
You know what would have been useful?

02:31:02.160 --> 02:31:05.160
Showing the player the health of locked objects

02:31:05.160 --> 02:31:07.160
or even saying when something's indestructible.

02:31:07.160 --> 02:31:09.160
There's a little game you could have taken inspiration from

02:31:09.160 --> 02:31:10.160
that did this.

02:31:10.160 --> 02:31:12.160
It's called Deus Ex.

02:31:12.160 --> 02:31:14.160
They just forgot to make half the stuff in the game

02:31:14.160 --> 02:31:15.160
respond to damage.

02:31:15.160 --> 02:31:17.160
Lockers, something players might want

02:31:17.160 --> 02:31:19.160
to be able to open a bunch of all at once

02:31:19.160 --> 02:31:21.160
by throwing a grenade into a room

02:31:22.160 --> 02:31:24.160
and peeking around the horrible door

02:31:24.160 --> 02:31:27.160
of every single one are also indestructible.

02:31:27.160 --> 02:31:29.160
One of the most fun things in Deus Ex

02:31:29.160 --> 02:31:31.160
was running low on picks and seeing how many lockers

02:31:31.160 --> 02:31:33.160
you could open with your spare GEP rockets

02:31:33.160 --> 02:31:36.160
in Vandenberg without evaporating the office cat.

02:31:36.160 --> 02:31:38.160
There's something immensely funny and satisfying

02:31:38.160 --> 02:31:40.160
about tossing a grenade into a room

02:31:40.160 --> 02:31:42.160
and turning it into a festival of loot.

02:31:42.160 --> 02:31:43.160
This isn't a nitpick.

02:31:43.160 --> 02:31:45.160
This is a fundamental component

02:31:45.160 --> 02:31:47.160
of Deus Ex's player freedom and immersion

02:31:47.160 --> 02:31:49.160
that just doesn't work.

02:31:49.160 --> 02:31:51.160
You know, even when Invisible War

02:31:51.160 --> 02:31:53.160
was being Invisible War,

02:31:53.160 --> 02:31:55.160
you could still reliably blow things open

02:31:55.160 --> 02:31:56.160
with explosives.

02:31:56.160 --> 02:31:58.160
It wasn't a crapshoot whether the developers

02:31:58.160 --> 02:32:00.160
had bothered to make something break open

02:32:00.160 --> 02:32:01.160
like it should.

02:32:01.160 --> 02:32:03.160
Deus Ex's worst moments were when you had

02:32:03.160 --> 02:32:05.160
no clever alternatives to the more obvious choices,

02:32:05.160 --> 02:32:07.160
like when a grate you could pick

02:32:07.160 --> 02:32:09.160
couldn't be destroyed by other means,

02:32:09.160 --> 02:32:11.160
but this is just how human revolution works.

02:32:11.160 --> 02:32:13.160
You need the lift-heavy object's ability

02:32:13.160 --> 02:32:15.160
to move the vending machine to get into this vent.

02:32:15.160 --> 02:32:17.160
You could say it's a venting machine,

02:32:17.160 --> 02:32:19.160
but hey, maybe you can use some creativity

02:32:19.160 --> 02:32:22.160
and destroy the machine with a grenade.

02:32:22.160 --> 02:32:24.160
Vending machines are literally indestructible.

02:32:24.160 --> 02:32:25.160
Didn't you know?

02:32:25.160 --> 02:32:27.160
The best you can hope for is the physics

02:32:27.160 --> 02:32:28.160
blowing it clear of the vent,

02:32:28.160 --> 02:32:29.160
but for that to happen,

02:32:29.160 --> 02:32:31.160
the physics would have to work.

02:32:31.160 --> 02:32:32.160
Goodbye.

02:32:32.160 --> 02:32:34.160
Meanwhile...

02:32:34.160 --> 02:32:39.160
♪ ♪

02:32:39.160 --> 02:32:41.160
Deus Ex made almost everything breakable.

02:32:41.160 --> 02:32:44.160
Plants, boxes, bodies.

02:32:44.160 --> 02:32:46.160
All right, I killed your boss.

02:32:46.160 --> 02:32:47.160
Well, okay.

02:32:47.160 --> 02:32:49.160
Trash sometimes spawns rats in it

02:32:49.160 --> 02:32:52.160
when you destroy it because it's New York City, baby.

02:32:52.160 --> 02:32:54.160
Smash all the vases and beakers on the floor you want.

02:32:54.160 --> 02:32:56.160
Take this, globalists.

02:32:56.160 --> 02:32:58.160
The game certainly is much nicer looking

02:32:58.160 --> 02:32:59.160
than the earlier games.

02:32:59.160 --> 02:33:00.160
Humans don't look like

02:33:00.160 --> 02:33:02.160
Age of Mythology Prometheans

02:33:02.160 --> 02:33:04.160
with faces painted on them for one,

02:33:04.160 --> 02:33:05.160
but just generally,

02:33:05.160 --> 02:33:06.160
everything is so much more beautiful.

02:33:06.160 --> 02:33:08.160
I mean, look at these ceilings.

02:33:08.160 --> 02:33:10.160
At least a year of the game's development

02:33:10.160 --> 02:33:11.160
probably went into these.

02:33:11.160 --> 02:33:13.160
Holy cow, bro. I love this.

02:33:14.160 --> 02:33:16.160
Top ten ceilings in history

02:33:16.160 --> 02:33:17.160
right behind the Sistine Chapel

02:33:17.160 --> 02:33:19.160
and another clever-sounding thing,

02:33:19.160 --> 02:33:21.160
but when it comes to interaction,

02:33:21.160 --> 02:33:23.160
you know, the game part of this game,

02:33:23.160 --> 02:33:25.160
almost every prop or object

02:33:25.160 --> 02:33:27.160
is invincible set dressing.

02:33:27.160 --> 02:33:29.160
These beakers? Bulletproof.

02:33:29.160 --> 02:33:31.160
This Chinese food? Immortal.

02:33:31.160 --> 02:33:33.160
This glass table?

02:33:33.160 --> 02:33:35.160
Absorbing nearby humans to gain their power.

02:33:35.160 --> 02:33:37.160
The world feels so static,

02:33:37.160 --> 02:33:39.160
and it makes you feel even less

02:33:39.160 --> 02:33:40.160
like you're really interacting with it.

02:33:40.160 --> 02:33:42.160
Lapicus claims this is a selling point too.

02:33:42.160 --> 02:33:44.160
Look at this. What?

02:33:44.160 --> 02:33:46.160
Quit screwing around.

02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:48.160
Are you telling me your game is better

02:33:48.160 --> 02:33:50.160
because you can't throw plants at people?

02:33:50.160 --> 02:33:52.160
This is cyberbullying.

02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:53.160
I've seen people say this game

02:33:53.160 --> 02:33:55.160
has amazing emergent gameplay,

02:33:55.160 --> 02:33:56.160
like, oh, wow,

02:33:56.160 --> 02:33:58.160
you can break open destructible walls

02:33:58.160 --> 02:34:00.160
if you don't have the wall-punching ability.

02:34:00.160 --> 02:34:01.160
Yeah, that's nice,

02:34:01.160 --> 02:34:03.160
although if you don't have that ability,

02:34:03.160 --> 02:34:06.160
destructible walls don't noticeably glow,

02:34:06.160 --> 02:34:07.160
so it's hard to find many of them

02:34:07.160 --> 02:34:09.160
without already having the ability,

02:34:09.160 --> 02:34:11.160
at which point you're not going to waste grenades

02:34:11.160 --> 02:34:13.160
or ammunition on a wall you can just punch down.

02:34:13.160 --> 02:34:15.160
Actually, the punchable wall augmentation

02:34:15.160 --> 02:34:17.160
opens up a bunch of extra questions.

02:34:17.160 --> 02:34:19.160
You can smash down concrete walls

02:34:19.160 --> 02:34:21.160
if they're slightly cracked,

02:34:21.160 --> 02:34:22.160
but you can't use this ability

02:34:22.160 --> 02:34:24.160
to punch open locked doors?

02:34:24.160 --> 02:34:26.160
You can't just break whatever locking mechanism

02:34:26.160 --> 02:34:28.160
is keeping this flimsy door shut

02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:29.160
with your mega fists?

02:34:29.160 --> 02:34:31.160
Chaos Theory had a lock-picking minigame

02:34:31.160 --> 02:34:34.160
that got a bit dull the way hacking minigames did here,

02:34:34.160 --> 02:34:35.160
and that was on top of the hacking minigame

02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:36.160
they also had,

02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:39.160
but the designers also gave you the ability

02:34:39.160 --> 02:34:42.160
to loudly break the lock and open it instantly.

02:34:44.160 --> 02:34:47.160
People who heard the noise or saw the broken lock

02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:48.160
would know someone was here,

02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:50.160
but if you don't want to pick that lock,

02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:51.160
you don't have to.

02:34:51.160 --> 02:34:52.160
Picking it became a choice,

02:34:52.160 --> 02:34:55.160
one which felt more professional and stealthy.

02:34:55.160 --> 02:34:56.160
Wouldn't it be cool if that augmentation

02:34:56.160 --> 02:34:58.160
also let you smash the locks off doors

02:34:58.160 --> 02:34:59.160
and make a ton of noise

02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:02.160
or risk setting off a security system or something?

02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:03.160
It would be really cool to have an ability

02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:05.160
like that at your disposal,

02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:07.160
and I'm shocked the people who made a game

02:35:07.160 --> 02:35:09.160
that literally did this didn't think of it.

02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:11.160
It would automatically give you a lot more

02:35:11.160 --> 02:35:12.160
to do with this power

02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:14.160
and save on having to think of more places

02:35:14.160 --> 02:35:15.160
to put punchable walls,

02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:18.160
which they were really running low on towards the end.

02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:20.160
Something else really bugs me about these levels.

02:35:20.160 --> 02:35:22.160
I spent a long time trying to put my finger on it,

02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:24.160
but it turns out the answer was floating right in front

02:35:24.160 --> 02:35:26.160
of my face the entire time,

02:35:26.160 --> 02:35:27.160
so I'm not sure how I missed it.

02:35:27.160 --> 02:35:30.160
Oh, did you think I forgot about the quest markers?

02:35:30.160 --> 02:35:31.160
How could I?

02:35:31.160 --> 02:35:32.160
How could anyone?

02:35:32.160 --> 02:35:33.160
Quest markers are annoying

02:35:33.160 --> 02:35:34.160
when they're off in the corner,

02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:35.160
but it turns out it could have been worse.

02:35:35.160 --> 02:35:37.160
They could have been unconstrained.

02:35:37.160 --> 02:35:39.160
They could have just, no, no, leave me alone.

02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:41.160
They didn't seem to consider how it would look

02:35:41.160 --> 02:35:43.160
if you had multiple side quests happening at once

02:35:43.160 --> 02:35:45.160
or if you were at a stage in a side quest

02:35:45.160 --> 02:35:47.160
with multiple objectives because who, boy,

02:35:47.160 --> 02:35:49.160
does that door need me to know?

02:35:49.160 --> 02:35:51.160
Every side quest and individual component

02:35:51.160 --> 02:35:53.160
each side quest has is outside it.

02:35:53.160 --> 02:35:55.160
There's one side quest where you have to neutralize

02:35:55.160 --> 02:35:57.160
an entire apartment full of gangsters.

02:35:57.160 --> 02:35:59.160
Now, they're localized to a single small apartment,

02:35:59.160 --> 02:36:02.160
so you only need one quest marker for that, right?

02:36:02.160 --> 02:36:05.160
["Live and Let Live"]

02:36:05.160 --> 02:36:07.160
I have genuinely died in this game

02:36:07.160 --> 02:36:09.160
because I couldn't see a guy behind a pile

02:36:09.160 --> 02:36:11.160
of his buddy's quest markers.

02:36:11.160 --> 02:36:13.160
Yeah, so the game is a little desperate

02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:14.160
to make sure players don't miss

02:36:14.160 --> 02:36:15.160
what they're supposed to be doing

02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:18.160
to the point that it's pretty distracting, ironically.

02:36:18.160 --> 02:36:19.160
They expect you to toggle off the markers

02:36:19.160 --> 02:36:21.160
for quests you aren't doing at the exact moment,

02:36:21.160 --> 02:36:23.160
and yeah, sure, this helps for that

02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:25.160
if you don't mind doing one thing at a time,

02:36:25.160 --> 02:36:27.160
but the real issue is making a game

02:36:27.160 --> 02:36:29.160
which has a method of pointing the player

02:36:29.160 --> 02:36:31.160
directly towards their required destination

02:36:31.160 --> 02:36:34.160
inspires really lazy design

02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:36.160
because now the levels don't have to make sense

02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:38.160
to players as they navigate

02:36:38.160 --> 02:36:40.160
because they've got a thing telling them where to go.

02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:42.160
If you've played the game, you'll know that even though

02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:43.160
the markers are really distracting,

02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:44.160
you have to leave them on

02:36:44.160 --> 02:36:47.160
because there's no other way of finding these quests.

02:36:47.160 --> 02:36:49.160
Detroit is an unintuitive area to explore.

02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:51.160
It's a ton of very similar streets

02:36:51.160 --> 02:36:53.160
connecting to other very similar streets,

02:36:53.160 --> 02:36:54.160
and when it's not those streets,

02:36:54.160 --> 02:36:56.160
it's identical apartment buildings,

02:36:56.160 --> 02:36:58.160
which granted is realistic to most urban cities,

02:36:58.160 --> 02:37:00.160
but that's not how games ought to work.

02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:03.160
New York in Deus Ex had character and presence.

02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:05.160
It was designed to be experienced

02:37:05.160 --> 02:37:07.160
by a player who didn't have it memorized

02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:09.160
or know exactly where to go.

02:37:09.160 --> 02:37:11.160
You enter and you're like, where am I?

02:37:11.160 --> 02:37:13.160
And you look around and you know where you are

02:37:13.160 --> 02:37:15.160
because every part of the level looks different

02:37:15.160 --> 02:37:17.160
and things are really well signposted,

02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:19.160
literally in some cases.

02:37:19.160 --> 02:37:21.160
I love the place everyone calls the Taun Hotel

02:37:21.160 --> 02:37:23.160
is really the Hilton Hotel but the sign's broken.

02:37:23.160 --> 02:37:25.160
It's memorable and makes the hotel

02:37:25.160 --> 02:37:27.160
into an obvious landmark you can use to navigate.

02:37:27.160 --> 02:37:29.160
If you have to find Adam Jensen's apartment

02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:31.160
off in the corner of the map

02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:33.160
without quest markers telling you exactly where it is,

02:37:33.160 --> 02:37:35.160
you're screwed.

02:37:35.160 --> 02:37:37.160
If you try to stop and get your bearings by looking around,

02:37:37.160 --> 02:37:39.160
you'll never get anywhere.

02:37:39.160 --> 02:37:42.160
Detroit is a maze you need a GPS to traverse.

02:37:42.160 --> 02:37:44.160
Quests are not designed to be doable

02:37:44.160 --> 02:37:46.160
with the markers turned off.

02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:48.160
You'd have to manually check every single back alley

02:37:48.160 --> 02:37:50.160
to find the specific one with the guy

02:37:50.160 --> 02:37:52.160
you need to talk to for the current quest,

02:37:52.160 --> 02:37:54.160
especially when the guy has moved

02:37:54.160 --> 02:37:56.160
since the last time you talked to him for no reason.

02:37:56.160 --> 02:37:58.160
Conversely, I was feeling clever

02:37:58.160 --> 02:38:00.160
when I wrote this sentence, this also means

02:38:00.160 --> 02:38:02.160
the player is never expected or challenged

02:38:02.160 --> 02:38:04.160
to pay attention.

02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:06.160
Deus Ex has an optional secret base in the sewers

02:38:06.160 --> 02:38:08.160
the first time you get to New York

02:38:08.160 --> 02:38:10.160
that's a clever setup for some of the future plot.

02:38:10.160 --> 02:38:12.160
Finding it requires looking around yourself

02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:14.160
or talking to a character you meet

02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:16.160
in another optional area and hearing him mention

02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:18.160
the base in the sewers and choosing to check it out.

02:38:18.160 --> 02:38:20.160
Nothing gets plopped on your screen,

02:38:20.160 --> 02:38:22.160
no arrow on your mini-map,

02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:24.160
just good old-fashioned detective work.

02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:26.160
You feel like a spy on the trail

02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:28.160
of a conspiracy and on a deeper level,

02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:30.160
your objective is to find a generator

02:38:30.160 --> 02:38:32.160
the terrorists have hidden. Finding it is the point.

02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:34.160
Asking around, exploring,

02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:36.160
bothering to check out side content and meet

02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:38.160
other characters who might come in handy later.

02:38:38.160 --> 02:38:40.160
You can get on the rooftops of buildings

02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:42.160
and physically see the building the NSF

02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:44.160
are clearly trying to defend. This is the point

02:38:44.160 --> 02:38:46.160
of this section. It's why the game

02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:48.160
feels so free and personal despite

02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:50.160
being, at its heart, pretty linear.

02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:52.160
DXHR feels exactly

02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:54.160
as linear as it is. In every

02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:56.160
single moment, it is telling you exactly

02:38:56.160 --> 02:38:58.160
where you're going next and

02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:00.160
you're following it. When you have to do the

02:39:00.160 --> 02:39:02.160
equivalent quest, shutting down a signal the

02:39:02.160 --> 02:39:04.160
bad guys are generating, you know precisely

02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:06.160
where it is at all times. There is

02:39:06.160 --> 02:39:08.160
no mystery, no search. Pritchard

02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:10.160
gives you a quest marker and you walk

02:39:10.160 --> 02:39:12.160
to it. Hell, you could have just got your pilot

02:39:12.160 --> 02:39:14.160
to drop you off right there and save you the trouble

02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:16.160
and when you do turn it off, she actually does turn up

02:39:16.160 --> 02:39:18.160
to take you to the next area, which is a little

02:39:18.160 --> 02:39:20.160
insulting. I'm sure there's a plot contrivance

02:39:20.160 --> 02:39:22.160
but in the original game, the point was that

02:39:22.160 --> 02:39:24.160
you didn't know exactly where it was

02:39:24.160 --> 02:39:26.160
so you didn't feel like you had your time wasted

02:39:26.160 --> 02:39:28.160
when an aircraft came to pick you up after you

02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:30.160
found it. Quest markers are not

02:39:30.160 --> 02:39:32.160
an alternative to level design. There

02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:34.160
are a few brief sections in the game

02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:36.160
where they're switched off so the game has

02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:38.160
to be designed to make the player do their own

02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:40.160
thinking and exploring and the game's fun

02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:42.160
factor instantly skyrockets.

02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:44.160
There's a base where your signal is jammed

02:39:44.160 --> 02:39:46.160
or whatever so you have to manually find

02:39:46.160 --> 02:39:48.160
the scientist you're looking for and it's

02:39:48.160 --> 02:39:50.160
easily the best level in the game to

02:39:50.160 --> 02:39:52.160
navigate. Each of the buildings has a

02:39:52.160 --> 02:39:54.160
completely different shape and feel,

02:39:54.160 --> 02:39:56.160
unique designs and visual cues,

02:39:56.160 --> 02:39:58.160
the outside area is built so it's easy to know

02:39:58.160 --> 02:40:00.160
where you are relative to everything. It's really

02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:02.160
cool. Five minutes in, you find the signal

02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:04.160
jammer and turn it off and the game is bullshit

02:40:04.160 --> 02:40:06.160
again. Now you know exactly where to go

02:40:06.160 --> 02:40:08.160
and suddenly you're not really exploring anymore.

02:40:08.160 --> 02:40:10.160
This is the one section in the game

02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:12.160
where turning off the quest markers actually works

02:40:12.160 --> 02:40:14.160
really well so at least it's a good

02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:16.160
time if you keep the markers turned off.

02:40:16.160 --> 02:40:18.160
It kind of sucks that almost every game

02:40:18.160 --> 02:40:20.160
that heavily relies on these markers inevitably

02:40:20.160 --> 02:40:22.160
has a tiny, really cool segment

02:40:22.160 --> 02:40:24.160
that turns them off where the level design has to

02:40:24.160 --> 02:40:26.160
account for them being turned off and everything

02:40:26.160 --> 02:40:28.160
gets so much better. Instead of being

02:40:28.160 --> 02:40:30.160
an interesting take on the central mechanics,

02:40:30.160 --> 02:40:32.160
it ends up being a brief foray into

02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:34.160
better mechanics you don't get anywhere else

02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:36.160
and now the player knows exactly

02:40:36.160 --> 02:40:38.160
what they're missing the rest of the time.

02:40:38.160 --> 02:40:40.160
There's an oversight in the PC version

02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:42.160
that's kind of funny but also prevents

02:40:42.160 --> 02:40:44.160
the markers from at least getting better

02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:46.160
with age. The game was designed to look

02:40:46.160 --> 02:40:48.160
good at 720p on the PlayStation 3

02:40:48.160 --> 02:40:50.160
and Xbox 360. When nixes

02:40:50.160 --> 02:40:52.160
were creating the PC port, and god bless

02:40:52.160 --> 02:40:54.160
them, otherwise they did a fantastic job,

02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:56.160
someone made the UI not scale

02:40:56.160 --> 02:40:58.160
with resolution. This means at higher resolutions

02:40:58.160 --> 02:41:00.160
like 1080p, 1440p,

02:41:00.160 --> 02:41:02.160
and 4K if you're an idiot who owns

02:41:02.160 --> 02:41:04.160
a 4K screen, the UI gets

02:41:04.160 --> 02:41:06.160
increasingly harder to see and read

02:41:06.160 --> 02:41:08.160
but for some godforsaken reason,

02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:10.160
the objective markers and only

02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:12.160
the objective markers do scale

02:41:12.160 --> 02:41:14.160
so even though everything else is so small,

02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:16.160
people watching this video on their phone

02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:18.160
won't be able to read the in-game subtitles.

02:41:18.160 --> 02:41:20.160
Don't blame me. That's just how the game looks

02:41:20.160 --> 02:41:22.160
at 1440p. The quest markers are

02:41:22.160 --> 02:41:24.160
still blasting your head off and

02:41:24.160 --> 02:41:26.160
messing with the visuals of an otherwise

02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:28.160
still beautiful game.

02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:30.160
Incidentally, if you get the chip replacement,

02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:32.160
the glitchy health bar and ammo

02:41:32.160 --> 02:41:34.160
counter you get during the boss battle are

02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:36.160
scaled so you can briefly see just

02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:38.160
how readable the game could have been.

02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:40.160
You know how older video game cities

02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:42.160
were always a lot smaller than a real city

02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:44.160
would be because of hardware limitations or what have you?

02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:46.160
It turns out that was a blessing in

02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:48.160
disguise. New York, Hong Kong,

02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:50.160
and Paris felt big but not so big

02:41:50.160 --> 02:41:52.160
that getting around was annoying because you know

02:41:52.160 --> 02:41:54.160
what's not that fun? Trying to get around

02:41:54.160 --> 02:41:56.160
a big city on foot.

02:41:56.160 --> 02:41:58.160
["Hey."

02:41:58.160 --> 02:42:00.160
["Hey."

02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:02.160
["Hey."

02:42:02.160 --> 02:42:04.160
["Hey."

02:42:04.160 --> 02:42:06.160
["Hey."

02:42:06.160 --> 02:42:08.160
["Hey."

02:42:08.160 --> 02:42:09.160
["Hey." You laughed or something?"

02:42:09.160 --> 02:42:11.160
The new, realistically big Detroit

02:42:11.160 --> 02:42:13.160
and Hengsha levels have tons of places

02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:15.160
that serve no actual gameplay purpose whatsoever,

02:42:15.160 --> 02:42:17.160
but the level has to be big

02:42:17.160 --> 02:42:19.160
because cities are big. The game does

02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:21.160
create a very nice sense of mood with this though.

02:42:21.160 --> 02:42:23.160
The designers came up with hundreds of brands

02:42:23.160 --> 02:42:25.160
and logos to populate their future with.

02:42:25.160 --> 02:42:27.160
There's some genuine creativity on display

02:42:27.160 --> 02:42:29.160
here, but these levels aren't used

02:42:29.160 --> 02:42:31.160
in ways that benefit from this. You aren't

02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:33.160
milling around the cool environment,

02:42:33.160 --> 02:42:35.160
making small talk with locals, having unique

02:42:35.160 --> 02:42:37.160
encounters as you traverse the hustle and bustle

02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:39.160
of the city. It's window dressing

02:42:39.160 --> 02:42:41.160
as you follow a quest marker to the places

02:42:41.160 --> 02:42:43.160
the gameplay happens. J.C. Denton's

02:42:43.160 --> 02:42:45.160
walk speed wasn't super fast by the first person

02:42:45.160 --> 02:42:47.160
shooter standards of the time, but the small

02:42:47.160 --> 02:42:49.160
and dense levels packed with stuff to do

02:42:49.160 --> 02:42:51.160
and secrets to find made the pace

02:42:51.160 --> 02:42:53.160
feel brisk. Adam feels

02:42:53.160 --> 02:42:55.160
significantly slower than J.C.,

02:42:55.160 --> 02:42:57.160
especially in the much larger cities.

02:42:57.160 --> 02:42:59.160
You can sprint for two seconds.

02:42:59.160 --> 02:43:01.160
That's not a joke. Two seconds, and then

02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:03.160
it has to recharge.

02:43:03.160 --> 02:43:05.160
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:07.160
Oh. Oh.

02:43:07.160 --> 02:43:09.160
Oh.

02:43:09.160 --> 02:43:11.160
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

02:43:11.160 --> 02:43:13.160
They made running shit on purpose

02:43:13.160 --> 02:43:15.160
so you had more stuff to put praxis points

02:43:15.160 --> 02:43:17.160
into. I mean, it's not a surprise he's going

02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:19.160
so slow if he's carrying so much stuff

02:43:19.160 --> 02:43:21.160
everywhere in his arms. Pathologic made

02:43:21.160 --> 02:43:23.160
you walk for hours deliberately as

02:43:23.160 --> 02:43:25.160
a form of punishment for the player.

02:43:25.160 --> 02:43:27.160
The game was trying to hurt you and make you

02:43:27.160 --> 02:43:29.160
question what you were doing with your time.

02:43:29.160 --> 02:43:31.160
Human Revolution is trying to be a fun

02:43:31.160 --> 02:43:33.160
cyberpunk action RPG, so I

02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:35.160
don't think they should be aiming for the same effect.

02:43:35.160 --> 02:43:37.160
The atmosphere and art design deserve

02:43:37.160 --> 02:43:39.160
some credit here, though. This is some of the

02:43:39.160 --> 02:43:41.160
most impressive really boring

02:43:41.160 --> 02:43:43.160
walking back and forth between objectives

02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:45.160
I've done in my life, and I'm an expert

02:43:45.160 --> 02:43:47.160
on those. This is one of the

02:43:47.160 --> 02:43:49.160
best realized worlds in the history

02:43:49.160 --> 02:43:51.160
of video games. A decade later,

02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:53.160
the graphics hold up incredibly well

02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:55.160
because good visual design just

02:43:55.160 --> 02:43:57.160
doesn't age, but you're traversing

02:43:57.160 --> 02:43:59.160
it to do the same hacking minigame

02:43:59.160 --> 02:44:01.160
every five feet to unlock safes

02:44:01.160 --> 02:44:03.160
with a negligible amount of money in them

02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:05.160
which you can't even spend because the store

02:44:05.160 --> 02:44:07.160
only had ten of the bullets you want.

02:44:07.160 --> 02:44:09.160
This is why this game is so difficult

02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:11.160
to analyze without going way overboard

02:44:11.160 --> 02:44:13.160
and making an unwatchably long video.

02:44:13.160 --> 02:44:15.160
All the pieces of an excellent game

02:44:15.160 --> 02:44:17.160
are right here. They even made the

02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:19.160
skylight you could have got in through in a better

02:44:19.160 --> 02:44:21.160
version of the game, but they don't

02:44:21.160 --> 02:44:23.160
stick the landing. Instead, the game is

02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:25.160
merely fine. The stealth is fun,

02:44:25.160 --> 02:44:27.160
the combat is good, and the levels are okay

02:44:27.160 --> 02:44:29.160
but don't encourage creativity,

02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:31.160
and it's easy to get bored because the game

02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:33.160
never asks that much of you.

02:44:33.160 --> 02:44:35.160
I joked before about people quitting because of the

02:44:35.160 --> 02:44:37.160
hacking minigame, but more seriously,

02:44:37.160 --> 02:44:39.160
it's probably because halfway through,

02:44:39.160 --> 02:44:41.160
there aren't even many new levels to keep

02:44:41.160 --> 02:44:43.160
things fresh. You instead go to Detroit

02:44:43.160 --> 02:44:45.160
and Hengsha all over again with

02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:47.160
even less to see this time. The first

02:44:47.160 --> 02:44:49.160
visits to these locations have an okay amount

02:44:49.160 --> 02:44:51.160
of side quests, about as many as the

02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:53.160
original did for its city-type locations.

02:44:53.160 --> 02:44:55.160
The second visit to Detroit has

02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:57.160
a side quest with a second one if

02:44:57.160 --> 02:44:59.160
you completed another side quest during the

02:44:59.160 --> 02:45:01.160
first visit, and I mean fully completed.

02:45:01.160 --> 02:45:03.160
If you forgot to read the three emails

02:45:03.160 --> 02:45:05.160
you got sent at the end of the first half of

02:45:05.160 --> 02:45:07.160
the quest before you left for China hours ago,

02:45:07.160 --> 02:45:09.160
you can never start the second half

02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:11.160
once you get back. The second visit to

02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:13.160
China is so devoid of new material

02:45:13.160 --> 02:45:15.160
the game lies and says there are more

02:45:15.160 --> 02:45:17.160
side missions than there actually are.

02:45:17.160 --> 02:45:19.160
There's two, one from this guy and one from

02:45:19.160 --> 02:45:21.160
this lady, but the game pretends

02:45:21.160 --> 02:45:23.160
there's a third quest. The other

02:45:23.160 --> 02:45:25.160
quest, a matter of discretion,

02:45:25.160 --> 02:45:27.160
is given to you by another character.

02:45:27.160 --> 02:45:29.160
It's to talk to this lady who then

02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:31.160
gives you the second quest.

02:45:31.160 --> 02:45:33.160
Are you the man Mr. Darrow sent?

02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:35.160
A guy calls you on the telephone and

02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:37.160
gives you the quest to get the other quest

02:45:37.160 --> 02:45:39.160
so it feels like you're doing more quests.

02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:41.160
There are some really ambitious ideas for a cyberpunk

02:45:41.160 --> 02:45:43.160
world in here saddled with an engine

02:45:43.160 --> 02:45:45.160
and hardware generation that didn't match

02:45:45.160 --> 02:45:47.160
that ambition. The simplified levels

02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:49.160
remind me a lot of the PS2 version

02:45:49.160 --> 02:45:51.160
of the original game, which was good

02:45:51.160 --> 02:45:53.160
but a bit more stripped down and missing

02:45:53.160 --> 02:45:55.160
the expansiveness and complexity that made

02:45:55.160 --> 02:45:57.160
the PC version quite so special.

02:45:57.160 --> 02:45:59.160
I'd compare the level design to Invisible Wars,

02:45:59.160 --> 02:46:01.160
but even I'm not that mean.

02:46:01.160 --> 02:46:03.160
Actually, no. Invisible War put enemies

02:46:03.160 --> 02:46:05.160
in the vents to punish you for thinking they were

02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:07.160
an easy solution, so its level design

02:46:07.160 --> 02:46:09.160
is objectively better. Next chapter.

02:46:09.160 --> 02:46:11.160
Goodbye.

02:46:11.160 --> 02:46:13.160
Ugh!

02:46:15.160 --> 02:46:17.160
I talked to the chairman.

02:46:17.160 --> 02:46:19.160
We discussed regime change for New Cairo.

02:46:19.160 --> 02:46:21.160
♪

02:46:23.160 --> 02:46:25.160
The story of the original Deus Ex

02:46:25.160 --> 02:46:27.160
was a complete mess.

02:46:27.160 --> 02:46:29.160
In a good way, though. It's part of what makes it

02:46:29.160 --> 02:46:31.160
amazing, but it's also why making another

02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:33.160
one is like trying to solve the trolley problem

02:46:33.160 --> 02:46:35.160
while trapped inside the trolley.

02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:37.160
It was set in 2052 in a world

02:46:37.160 --> 02:46:39.160
that's very different from ours, or was

02:46:39.160 --> 02:46:41.160
different in the year 2000. Many of the game's

02:46:41.160 --> 02:46:43.160
scariest predictions turned out to be true.

02:46:43.160 --> 02:46:45.160
My favorite games keep doing that.

02:46:45.160 --> 02:46:47.160
Let it spill over to the schools

02:46:47.160 --> 02:46:49.160
and churches. Let the bodies pile up

02:46:49.160 --> 02:46:51.160
in the streets. There's a dozen

02:46:51.160 --> 02:46:53.160
factions with their own agendas all fighting

02:46:53.160 --> 02:46:55.160
for supremacy, uneasy alliances,

02:46:55.160 --> 02:46:57.160
ancient organizations, revolutionary

02:46:57.160 --> 02:46:59.160
groups, secret bases underneath

02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:01.160
other secret bases, corporate conspiracies,

02:47:01.160 --> 02:47:03.160
and even greasels!

02:47:03.160 --> 02:47:05.160
Oh, God!

02:47:05.160 --> 02:47:07.160
Oh, God!

02:47:09.160 --> 02:47:11.160
Despite discussing important

02:47:11.160 --> 02:47:13.160
ideas like the value of democracy

02:47:13.160 --> 02:47:15.160
and the human need to feel witnessed by a god

02:47:15.160 --> 02:47:17.160
and how the rich have manipulated

02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:19.160
the system so workers pay more in taxes

02:47:19.160 --> 02:47:21.160
than their boss, the writing still manages

02:47:21.160 --> 02:47:23.160
to be fun.

02:47:23.160 --> 02:47:25.160
A bomb's a bad choice

02:47:25.160 --> 02:47:27.160
for close-range combat.

02:47:27.160 --> 02:47:29.160
Deus Ex knows that a world where every conspiracy

02:47:29.160 --> 02:47:31.160
turned out to be true would be a little bit

02:47:31.160 --> 02:47:33.160
silly.

02:47:33.160 --> 02:47:35.160
No, I wanted orange.

02:47:35.160 --> 02:47:37.160
It gave me lemon lime. It's the maintenance man.

02:47:37.160 --> 02:47:39.160
He knows I like orange.

02:47:39.160 --> 02:47:41.160
So you think the staff has some kind of plot?

02:47:41.160 --> 02:47:43.160
Yes, they do that on purpose.

02:47:43.160 --> 02:47:45.160
So instead of pretending to be the darkest

02:47:45.160 --> 02:47:47.160
and most serious-est story ever,

02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:49.160
it's more like an X-Files box set

02:47:49.160 --> 02:47:51.160
raising some important ideas

02:47:51.160 --> 02:47:53.160
and themes but with a sense of humor about it.

02:47:53.160 --> 02:47:55.160
You take another step forward and here

02:47:55.160 --> 02:47:57.160
I am again, like your own

02:47:57.160 --> 02:47:59.160
reflection repeated in a hall of mirrors.

02:47:59.160 --> 02:48:01.160
That makes me one ugly son of a bitch.

02:48:01.160 --> 02:48:03.160
The game has multiple endings,

02:48:03.160 --> 02:48:05.160
all three of which have different implications

02:48:05.160 --> 02:48:07.160
for the future of the world.

02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:09.160
You can let things continue as normal but with a slightly

02:48:09.160 --> 02:48:11.160
more benevolent dictatorship in place run by you

02:48:11.160 --> 02:48:13.160
and that guy who loves betraying people.

02:48:13.160 --> 02:48:15.160
But I'm sure it'll all work out fine.

02:48:15.160 --> 02:48:17.160
Wait, that's not a good-sounding Paradise Lost quote.

02:48:17.160 --> 02:48:19.160
Oh, shit. Are we the baddies?

02:48:19.160 --> 02:48:21.160
Or you can shut off all advanced

02:48:21.160 --> 02:48:23.160
information technology and plunge the world

02:48:23.160 --> 02:48:25.160
into a new dark age where YouTubers

02:48:25.160 --> 02:48:27.160
have to provide something of value to society

02:48:27.160 --> 02:48:29.160
or you can fuse with an advanced AI

02:48:29.160 --> 02:48:31.160
and become a kind of all-knowing god

02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:33.160
from the machine. Hey, look, it's the title.

02:48:33.160 --> 02:48:35.160
But now the question is, how the hell

02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:37.160
do you make another one of these?

02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:39.160
Do you decide on one ending being canon

02:48:39.160 --> 02:48:41.160
and hope for the best? Do you ask for a player's

02:48:41.160 --> 02:48:43.160
save file and try to react to their choices

02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:45.160
and retcon all the big ones

02:48:45.160 --> 02:48:47.160
because you can't be bothered? Or do you embody

02:48:47.160 --> 02:48:49.160
the spirit of Deus Ex's madness

02:48:49.160 --> 02:48:51.160
and push it even further

02:48:51.160 --> 02:48:53.160
and put jet boosters on the trolley?

02:48:53.160 --> 02:48:55.160
Ah! No!

02:48:55.160 --> 02:48:57.160
Enter Deus Ex Invisible War,

02:48:57.160 --> 02:48:59.160
the game equivalent of trying to replace sleep

02:48:59.160 --> 02:49:01.160
with your ADHD medication.

02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:03.160
Which ending is canon? All of them.

02:49:03.160 --> 02:49:05.160
At once! J.C. Denton

02:49:05.160 --> 02:49:07.160
fused with an advanced AI and became

02:49:07.160 --> 02:49:09.160
a godlike, hyper-intelligent super being

02:49:09.160 --> 02:49:11.160
but also all the technology

02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:13.160
in the world shut off, which kind of messed

02:49:13.160 --> 02:49:15.160
with his plans, but also the fucking

02:49:15.160 --> 02:49:17.160
Illuminati are still running around,

02:49:17.160 --> 02:49:19.160
but also there's even more Greasels now!

02:49:19.160 --> 02:49:21.160
Ah! Set 20 years

02:49:21.160 --> 02:49:23.160
after the most confusing day in the world,

02:49:23.160 --> 02:49:25.160
Invisible War tries to follow up

02:49:25.160 --> 02:49:27.160
on the original with intriguing new perspectives

02:49:27.160 --> 02:49:29.160
and ironic twists and

02:49:29.160 --> 02:49:31.160
tries to tell a new story of its own

02:49:31.160 --> 02:49:33.160
with new characters while it's at it.

02:49:33.160 --> 02:49:35.160
Then those two things smash into each other

02:49:35.160 --> 02:49:37.160
and create the most fascinating mess

02:49:37.160 --> 02:49:39.160
of a story ever conceived.

02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:41.160
It's less X-Files boxed set and more

02:49:41.160 --> 02:49:43.160
trying to figure out the plot of X-Files

02:49:43.160 --> 02:49:45.160
from Fox Mulder best moments compilation

02:49:45.160 --> 02:49:47.160
number 11.

02:49:47.160 --> 02:49:49.160
Woo! How is this in part 11?

02:49:49.160 --> 02:49:51.160
This is at least a number four. I love this game.

02:49:51.160 --> 02:49:53.160
Is it good? I don't know, but it's

02:49:53.160 --> 02:49:55.160
definitely the most. This game has

02:49:55.160 --> 02:49:57.160
four radically different endings

02:49:57.160 --> 02:49:59.160
that each permanently alter the world

02:49:59.160 --> 02:50:01.160
even more than the originals did,

02:50:01.160 --> 02:50:03.160
ranging from wiping out almost all life

02:50:03.160 --> 02:50:05.160
to uniting human consciousness

02:50:05.160 --> 02:50:07.160
in a new way of being.

02:50:07.160 --> 02:50:09.160
So one question, how do you make a sequel

02:50:09.160 --> 02:50:11.160
to this? If someone asks you

02:50:11.160 --> 02:50:13.160
to make Deus Ex 3,

02:50:13.160 --> 02:50:15.160
as it was tentatively titled in its early teasers,

02:50:15.160 --> 02:50:17.160
they're trying to trick you into

02:50:17.160 --> 02:50:19.160
destroying your career. So

02:50:19.160 --> 02:50:21.160
what do you do? You make a prequel.

02:50:21.160 --> 02:50:23.160
Oh, no!

02:50:23.160 --> 02:50:25.160
Prequels can be great, but they often

02:50:25.160 --> 02:50:27.160
have to carry a lot of excess baggage.

02:50:27.160 --> 02:50:29.160
This is all the stuff we didn't need

02:50:29.160 --> 02:50:31.160
to see to enjoy the original, so

02:50:31.160 --> 02:50:33.160
seeing it is by definition kind of

02:50:33.160 --> 02:50:35.160
unnecessary. You know his name.

02:50:35.160 --> 02:50:37.160
You know his methods.

02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:39.160
And this February, you learn

02:50:39.160 --> 02:50:41.160
that at some point he started

02:50:41.160 --> 02:50:43.160
doing those things.

02:50:43.160 --> 02:50:45.160
Holy shit, this movie's fucking

02:50:45.160 --> 02:50:47.160
terrible, and in interactive media

02:50:47.160 --> 02:50:49.160
this can be even worse because now

02:50:49.160 --> 02:50:51.160
your interaction is being limited

02:50:51.160 --> 02:50:53.160
by what's supposed to happen next.

02:50:53.160 --> 02:50:55.160
You killed the future.

02:50:55.160 --> 02:50:57.160
You created a time paradox.

02:50:57.160 --> 02:50:59.160
Okay, in context, that's kind of

02:50:59.160 --> 02:51:01.160
meant as a joke. Uh, let's do a real

02:51:01.160 --> 02:51:03.160
example. Stalker, Shadow of Chernobyl,

02:51:03.160 --> 02:51:05.160
began with the marked one on the battle bus with

02:51:05.160 --> 02:51:07.160
the quest to down Strelok at the Tilted Towers.

02:51:07.160 --> 02:51:09.160
Whether he succeeded in his quest or

02:51:09.160 --> 02:51:11.160
if he merely got showered with money to

02:51:11.160 --> 02:51:13.160
death was based on your actions.

02:51:13.160 --> 02:51:15.160
Then Stalker got a prequel.

02:51:15.160 --> 02:51:17.160
Clear Sky has many problems, one of them

02:51:17.160 --> 02:51:19.160
being it's the successor to a game with a lot

02:51:19.160 --> 02:51:21.160
of endings and some big twists which

02:51:21.160 --> 02:51:23.160
itself has no real twists and can

02:51:23.160 --> 02:51:25.160
only end one way, and then Shadow

02:51:25.160 --> 02:51:27.160
of Chernobyl happens.

02:51:27.160 --> 02:51:29.160
You spend 10 to 30 hours helping

02:51:29.160 --> 02:51:31.160
the marked one catch his bus.

02:51:31.160 --> 02:51:33.160
People who play didn't know what I'm talking about.

02:51:33.160 --> 02:51:35.160
Honestly, I could talk for hours about how you...

02:51:35.160 --> 02:51:37.160
No, Rachel, I won't let you stop me this time.

02:51:37.160 --> 02:51:40.160
The people need to know. Is that a taser?

02:51:40.160 --> 02:51:43.160
♪♪

02:51:43.160 --> 02:51:45.160
So yeah, prequels are something you generally

02:51:45.160 --> 02:51:47.160
want to avoid unless you've got a really

02:51:47.160 --> 02:51:49.160
good idea for it.

02:51:49.160 --> 02:51:51.160
But as we've established,

02:51:51.160 --> 02:51:53.160
Eidos Montreal didn't really have much

02:51:53.160 --> 02:51:55.160
of a choice. They're kind of between a rock

02:51:55.160 --> 02:51:57.160
and a hard place here. I mean, I guess they could

02:51:57.160 --> 02:51:59.160
do a reboot, but rebooting the franchise

02:51:59.160 --> 02:52:01.160
kind of isn't ideal either. You really

02:52:01.160 --> 02:52:03.160
should never do one of those, Eidos Montreal.

02:52:03.160 --> 02:52:05.160
Oh, no! Given that all of the options

02:52:05.160 --> 02:52:07.160
were kind of bad, it does beg the question

02:52:07.160 --> 02:52:09.160
why make a Deus Ex game at all

02:52:09.160 --> 02:52:11.160
apart from brand recognition?

02:52:11.160 --> 02:52:13.160
Well, it might shock you, but the answer is

02:52:13.160 --> 02:52:15.160
brand recognition. Did you ever wonder why

02:52:15.160 --> 02:52:17.160
the next Prey was called Prey

02:52:17.160 --> 02:52:19.160
and not, I don't know, New Space Game

02:52:19.160 --> 02:52:21.160
even though it's nothing like Prey?

02:52:21.160 --> 02:52:23.160
God, these names are confusing.

02:52:23.160 --> 02:52:25.160
It's because the money men at Bethesda

02:52:25.160 --> 02:52:27.160
or Eidos Square Enix aren't going to spend

02:52:27.160 --> 02:52:29.160
millions of dollars and years of dev time

02:52:29.160 --> 02:52:31.160
on an ambitious risk-taking original

02:52:31.160 --> 02:52:33.160
idea unless it's got a vaguely

02:52:33.160 --> 02:52:35.160
bankable name. We already had in mind

02:52:35.160 --> 02:52:37.160
the kind of game we were making, and then

02:52:37.160 --> 02:52:39.160
Bethesda said, hey, what about using this name?

02:52:39.160 --> 02:52:41.160
Hey! Why don't you call it Prey, guys?

02:52:41.160 --> 02:52:43.160
We killed the company that was making

02:52:43.160 --> 02:52:45.160
the original Prey 2 even though

02:52:45.160 --> 02:52:47.160
it was basically finished because they wouldn't

02:52:47.160 --> 02:52:49.160
let us buy them. That's a true story.

02:52:49.160 --> 02:52:51.160
Look it up.

02:52:51.160 --> 02:52:53.160
So now we have this name lying around.

02:52:53.160 --> 02:52:55.160
Prey 2017's great, don't get me wrong,

02:52:55.160 --> 02:52:57.160
and the devs had a lot of creative

02:52:57.160 --> 02:52:59.160
freedom with it except for the name.

02:52:59.160 --> 02:53:01.160
That game had to be Prey somehow.

02:53:01.160 --> 02:53:03.160
This is why, at least in the AAA

02:53:03.160 --> 02:53:05.160
gaming space, original big-budget

02:53:05.160 --> 02:53:07.160
games are surprisingly rare, but you can

02:53:07.160 --> 02:53:09.160
expect endless sequels, prequels,

02:53:09.160 --> 02:53:11.160
reboots, and

02:53:11.160 --> 02:53:13.160
remasters of popular existing

02:53:13.160 --> 02:53:15.160
properties until you're cold in your grave.

02:53:15.160 --> 02:53:17.160
What have you done?

02:53:17.160 --> 02:53:19.160
Why does he look? Because when you're talking

02:53:19.160 --> 02:53:21.160
years of work and tens of millions

02:53:21.160 --> 02:53:23.160
of state-subsidized Canadian fun bucks,

02:53:23.160 --> 02:53:25.160
you need to provide at least some proof

02:53:25.160 --> 02:53:27.160
of a return on investment, and the

02:53:27.160 --> 02:53:29.160
best way to do that is to be called

02:53:29.160 --> 02:53:31.160
famous thing colon more shit.

02:53:31.160 --> 02:53:33.160
Maybe none of this is true and the

02:53:33.160 --> 02:53:35.160
creators really wanted to specifically

02:53:35.160 --> 02:53:37.160
make the next Deus Ex game, but if that's

02:53:37.160 --> 02:53:39.160
the case, I think it was a poor choice.

02:53:39.160 --> 02:53:41.160
You see, now you have to design your game around

02:53:41.160 --> 02:53:43.160
dodging the complaints of losers who care

02:53:43.160 --> 02:53:45.160
about the Deus Ex timeline. Losers like

02:53:45.160 --> 02:53:47.160
me prepare to be destroyed.

02:53:47.160 --> 02:53:49.160
What I'm getting at is the story is trying

02:53:49.160 --> 02:53:51.160
to be unique and original, but also

02:53:51.160 --> 02:53:53.160
very self-conscious about looking like

02:53:53.160 --> 02:53:55.160
it definitely will lead into Deus Ex

02:53:55.160 --> 02:53:57.160
maybe someday.

02:53:57.160 --> 02:53:59.160
This approach damages both the game's

02:53:59.160 --> 02:54:01.160
ability to relate to the other games and

02:54:01.160 --> 02:54:03.160
its ability to tell the original story

02:54:03.160 --> 02:54:05.160
it clearly desperately wants to.

02:54:05.160 --> 02:54:07.160
Before you can even explore the story

02:54:07.160 --> 02:54:09.160
that is here, you have to excavate it from

02:54:09.160 --> 02:54:11.160
under a pile of distracting references

02:54:11.160 --> 02:54:13.160
to the original. For example,

02:54:13.160 --> 02:54:15.160
J.C. Denton's boss, Joseph Manderly,

02:54:15.160 --> 02:54:17.160
is referenced like a dozen times throughout

02:54:17.160 --> 02:54:19.160
the plot like he's a major player

02:54:19.160 --> 02:54:21.160
directly involved with the important stuff

02:54:21.160 --> 02:54:22.160
you're dealing with.

02:54:22.160 --> 02:54:24.160
We've been compromised.

02:54:24.160 --> 02:54:26.160
Manderly was supposed to have that morgue locked down,

02:54:26.160 --> 02:54:28.160
but somebody got to the corpse before we did.

02:54:28.160 --> 02:54:30.160
Like, this guy's so important,

02:54:30.160 --> 02:54:32.160
he's getting name-dropped in the pre-rendered

02:54:32.160 --> 02:54:34.160
cutscenes by bosses. What would

02:54:34.160 --> 02:54:36.160
an ordinary player think this is setting up?

02:54:36.160 --> 02:54:38.160
You the home sec guy I was ordered to wait for?

02:54:38.160 --> 02:54:40.160
Tell Manderly I didn't get the memo

02:54:40.160 --> 02:54:42.160
until I was halfway through the autopsy.

02:54:42.160 --> 02:54:44.160
Maybe the story that you're playing?

02:54:44.160 --> 02:54:45.160
Right?

02:54:45.160 --> 02:54:46.160
Someone in the government,

02:54:46.160 --> 02:54:47.160
a man named Manderly,

02:54:47.160 --> 02:54:49.160
ordered that a specially appointed

02:54:49.160 --> 02:54:51.160
medical examiner perform the autopsy.

02:54:51.160 --> 02:54:53.160
So you think, I get it. This guy's a big deal.

02:54:53.160 --> 02:54:56.160
Maybe we meet or even fight him later?

02:54:56.160 --> 02:54:58.160
No. They eventually just stop mentioning him.

02:54:58.160 --> 02:55:00.160
If you were trying to figure out what was up

02:55:00.160 --> 02:55:02.160
with Manderly or find him,

02:55:02.160 --> 02:55:03.160
you were wasting your time.

02:55:03.160 --> 02:55:04.160
This isn't part of the story.

02:55:04.160 --> 02:55:06.160
This was the game's attempt to tie itself

02:55:06.160 --> 02:55:07.160
into the series more,

02:55:07.160 --> 02:55:09.160
but they've gone about it in a way

02:55:09.160 --> 02:55:11.160
that makes the actual story you're trying to follow

02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:13.160
really annoying because it's full of stuff

02:55:13.160 --> 02:55:15.160
you think you're supposed to pay attention to

02:55:15.160 --> 02:55:16.160
that turns out to be fan service

02:55:16.160 --> 02:55:17.160
and doesn't go anywhere.

02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:19.160
I'm sure they were trying to be subtle about it

02:55:19.160 --> 02:55:21.160
so their own story had room to breathe.

02:55:21.160 --> 02:55:23.160
In fact, here's Mary DeMalle saying that.

02:55:23.160 --> 02:55:25.160
Well, the good thing about doing the prequel

02:55:25.160 --> 02:55:27.160
is that if you haven't played the game before,

02:55:27.160 --> 02:55:29.160
you don't have to worry about it.

02:55:29.160 --> 02:55:31.160
You don't have to suddenly become,

02:55:31.160 --> 02:55:33.160
like, oh, what's going on?

02:55:33.160 --> 02:55:35.160
I think she had the right idea here.

02:55:35.160 --> 02:55:37.160
This was a story that first and foremost

02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:38.160
needed to work on its own merits,

02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:40.160
but there is frankly too much

02:55:40.160 --> 02:55:42.160
Deus Ex One stuff in here for that to happen.

02:55:42.160 --> 02:55:44.160
The first thing you see in the game

02:55:44.160 --> 02:55:46.160
in the opening is this guy, Bob Page,

02:55:46.160 --> 02:55:48.160
the antagonist of Deus Ex One

02:55:48.160 --> 02:55:49.160
and also the first guy you see

02:55:49.160 --> 02:55:51.160
in the opening of that game too.

02:55:51.160 --> 02:55:53.160
You need to know Bob Page is behind this

02:55:53.160 --> 02:55:55.160
for some reason even though he never appears

02:55:55.160 --> 02:55:56.160
in the actual game.

02:55:56.160 --> 02:55:58.160
He turns up after the credits.

02:55:58.160 --> 02:56:00.160
I'm looking forward to seeing the hybrid project

02:56:00.160 --> 02:56:01.160
up close, Mr. Page.

02:56:01.160 --> 02:56:04.160
But please...

02:56:04.160 --> 02:56:06.160
call me Bob.

02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:08.160
This shot in the post-credits scene

02:56:08.160 --> 02:56:10.160
is reused from the opening too.

02:56:10.160 --> 02:56:12.160
I don't know whether to be annoyed how lazy this was

02:56:12.160 --> 02:56:14.160
or glad they didn't waste too much effort

02:56:14.160 --> 02:56:16.160
on something so unnecessary.

02:56:16.160 --> 02:56:17.160
People who are playing this first,

02:56:17.160 --> 02:56:19.160
and for a lot of people this was their introduction

02:56:19.160 --> 02:56:21.160
to the series, will spend the entire game

02:56:21.160 --> 02:56:24.160
wondering who the hell that guy the intro focused on was,

02:56:24.160 --> 02:56:26.160
and they will never get an answer.

02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:28.160
I love when my first experience of a series

02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:30.160
is a bunch of shit I can't possibly understand.

02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:32.160
There's a bit during the walk and talk

02:56:32.160 --> 02:56:34.160
a few minutes later where a guy drops a reference

02:56:34.160 --> 02:56:36.160
to Page Industries, and this one's kind of cute.

02:56:36.160 --> 02:56:38.160
Players who knew what Page Industries was

02:56:38.160 --> 02:56:40.160
would get it, and players who didn't

02:56:40.160 --> 02:56:42.160
could write it off as world building and office banter.

02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:44.160
This subtlety would have worked really well,

02:56:44.160 --> 02:56:47.160
but you've already blown past subtle references

02:56:47.160 --> 02:56:49.160
to Bob Page when you began the game

02:56:49.160 --> 02:56:52.160
with a minute and a half intro starring Bob Page

02:56:52.160 --> 02:56:54.160
even though he's not even in the game.

02:56:54.160 --> 02:56:56.160
I'm a little paged out, buddy.

02:56:56.160 --> 02:56:58.160
The opening, ending, and quite a lot in between

02:56:58.160 --> 02:57:01.160
is an extended reminder of a different story

02:57:01.160 --> 02:57:03.160
you could be playing instead.

02:57:03.160 --> 02:57:05.160
People who know who Lucius De Beers is

02:57:05.160 --> 02:57:07.160
aren't gonna clap their hands like a circus seal

02:57:07.160 --> 02:57:09.160
when they see his name turn up, and people who don't

02:57:09.160 --> 02:57:11.160
are gonna wonder why they keep reading emails

02:57:11.160 --> 02:57:14.160
about people they don't know who don't turn up in the story.

02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:16.160
All these problems come to a head in,

02:57:16.160 --> 02:57:19.160
where else, the pre-order DLC.

02:57:19.160 --> 02:57:21.160
If you got the explosive mission pack,

02:57:21.160 --> 02:57:23.160
at one point you literally take a break

02:57:23.160 --> 02:57:25.160
from the story you're playing

02:57:25.160 --> 02:57:27.160
to help rescue a main character you've never met before

02:57:27.160 --> 02:57:29.160
to help them get onto a boat

02:57:29.160 --> 02:57:32.160
to the place they need to be 20 years later.

02:57:32.160 --> 02:57:34.160
The most relevant interaction Adam Jensen has

02:57:34.160 --> 02:57:36.160
with the plot of Deus Ex 1

02:57:36.160 --> 02:57:38.160
is to help a guy catch his bus.

02:57:38.160 --> 02:57:40.160
During the escape sequence with the bomb,

02:57:40.160 --> 02:57:42.160
you see him get on his boat, the Tracer.

02:57:42.160 --> 02:57:44.160
Wow, how long did that take you?

02:57:44.160 --> 02:57:46.160
But rescuing Tong was pre-order content

02:57:46.160 --> 02:57:48.160
a majority of players didn't get to do,

02:57:48.160 --> 02:57:50.160
and since this cut scene is pre-rendered

02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:52.160
and happens the same way no matter what,

02:57:52.160 --> 02:57:54.160
there isn't an alternative version

02:57:54.160 --> 02:57:56.160
for if you didn't get the rescue Tong mission.

02:57:56.160 --> 02:57:59.160
So most players' experience of this element of the story

02:57:59.160 --> 02:58:01.160
is some guy they've never seen before

02:58:01.160 --> 02:58:03.160
turns up for five seconds, waves at Adam

02:58:03.160 --> 02:58:05.160
like you're supposed to know who he is,

02:58:05.160 --> 02:58:07.160
and people who haven't played the original

02:58:07.160 --> 02:58:09.160
are left asking, wait, who are you?

02:58:09.160 --> 02:58:11.160
Guess you should have pre-ordered from GameStop.

02:58:11.160 --> 02:58:13.160
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

02:58:13.160 --> 02:58:15.160
I feel bad making this criticism because

02:58:15.160 --> 02:58:17.160
for the reasons we've explored, it's not like they had

02:58:17.160 --> 02:58:19.160
much of a choice in making their project

02:58:19.160 --> 02:58:21.160
have to also work as a prequel,

02:58:21.160 --> 02:58:23.160
and how they handled it is just kicking someone

02:58:23.160 --> 02:58:25.160
while they're down, which in Quebec I think

02:58:25.160 --> 02:58:27.160
they would call a, uh, folks pass,

02:58:27.160 --> 02:58:29.160
but Deus Ex is one of the best stories

02:58:29.160 --> 02:58:31.160
in the history of gaming, and Human Revolution

02:58:31.160 --> 02:58:33.160
isn't doing its own story any favors

02:58:33.160 --> 02:58:35.160
by reminding fans of the much better story

02:58:35.160 --> 02:58:37.160
they actually liked.

02:58:37.160 --> 02:58:39.160
So when the story isn't trying to shoehorn in

02:58:39.160 --> 02:58:41.160
confusing and unnecessary references to the first game,

02:58:41.160 --> 02:58:44.160
what is the story of this one actually about?

02:58:44.160 --> 02:58:46.160
♪♪

02:58:46.160 --> 02:58:48.160
Sorry, there's a typo there.

02:58:49.160 --> 02:58:51.160
Now, since it's a video game,

02:58:51.160 --> 02:58:54.160
we're grading on a really weirdly shaped curve here.

02:58:54.160 --> 02:58:56.160
They won an award for the writing

02:58:56.160 --> 02:58:58.160
at the Canadian Video Game Awards that year,

02:58:58.160 --> 02:59:01.160
beating out other games like Assassin's Creed Revelations

02:59:01.160 --> 02:59:03.160
and Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine.

02:59:03.160 --> 02:59:05.160
Wow, what stiff competition.

02:59:05.160 --> 02:59:07.160
This game's story is not great,

02:59:07.160 --> 02:59:11.160
but also much, much better than most other video games

02:59:11.160 --> 02:59:13.160
by such a wide margin it feels wrong

02:59:13.160 --> 02:59:15.160
criticizing it too hard.

02:59:15.160 --> 02:59:17.160
The performances are fantastic. Well, mostly.

02:59:17.160 --> 02:59:19.160
Someone's not coming back for the sequel,

02:59:19.160 --> 02:59:21.160
and there's some solid comedy in there too.

02:59:21.160 --> 02:59:23.160
There's a fantastic part where you're supposed

02:59:23.160 --> 02:59:24.160
to tell a code phrase to a guy,

02:59:24.160 --> 02:59:26.160
and you can just get it wrong on purpose.

02:59:48.160 --> 02:59:50.160
You don't even fail the mission for doing this.

02:59:50.160 --> 02:59:52.160
It's just cool, and there's some neat setup

02:59:52.160 --> 02:59:54.160
and payoff like, oh, see this guy showing his arm off

02:59:54.160 --> 02:59:56.160
to the camera to make sure you see it?

02:59:56.160 --> 02:59:58.160
That arm is gonna turn out to be important

02:59:58.160 --> 02:59:59.160
three quarters of the game from now.

02:59:59.160 --> 03:00:01.160
There's nothing wrong with the writing

03:00:01.160 --> 03:00:02.160
in, say, the cut scenes,

03:00:02.160 --> 03:00:04.160
even if they take away some player control.

03:00:04.160 --> 03:00:06.160
The issue is that all of this writing

03:00:06.160 --> 03:00:09.160
is happening around a badly written central plot.

03:00:09.160 --> 03:00:11.160
Deus Ex Human Revolution is centrally

03:00:11.160 --> 03:00:12.160
about the issue of augmentation

03:00:12.160 --> 03:00:14.160
and whether it's good or not.

03:00:14.160 --> 03:00:17.160
Deus Ex Human Revolution centers around

03:00:17.160 --> 03:00:19.160
the use of mechanical augmentations

03:00:19.160 --> 03:00:22.160
and how this technology has spread through the world

03:00:22.160 --> 03:00:24.160
and how it is affecting the world.

03:00:24.160 --> 03:00:25.160
It's not that the world is full of stuff,

03:00:25.160 --> 03:00:27.160
but the main focus is augmentation.

03:00:27.160 --> 03:00:29.160
It's that the world is full of people

03:00:29.160 --> 03:00:31.160
discussing augmentation and nothing else

03:00:31.160 --> 03:00:33.160
unless they're referencing Deus Ex 1.

03:00:33.160 --> 03:00:35.160
Almost everyone in the universe of Human Revolution

03:00:35.160 --> 03:00:38.160
has an opinion about whether having robot arms is good

03:00:38.160 --> 03:00:41.160
or the death knell of the human soul.

03:00:41.160 --> 03:00:44.160
What's all the fuss about this augmentation technology?

03:00:44.160 --> 03:00:46.160
What are you looking at, pal?

03:00:46.160 --> 03:00:49.160
Scanning me with those metal eyes of yours?

03:00:49.160 --> 03:00:52.160
No offense, but, uh, if it were up to me,

03:00:52.160 --> 03:00:55.160
this place would have a no-arg policy.

03:00:55.160 --> 03:00:58.160
Hope you enjoy those fancy hands of yours

03:00:58.160 --> 03:01:01.160
because in less than a year, they'll be worthless.

03:01:01.160 --> 03:01:03.160
The rote mechanical insistence

03:01:03.160 --> 03:01:05.160
on covering one and only one topic

03:01:05.160 --> 03:01:07.160
makes the world strangely uncanny.

03:01:07.160 --> 03:01:09.160
Have you seen the neural enhancements

03:01:09.160 --> 03:01:11.160
they're coming up with these days?

03:01:11.160 --> 03:01:13.160
How far are they gonna go?

03:01:13.160 --> 03:01:15.160
In his apartment building,

03:01:15.160 --> 03:01:17.160
Adam Jensen overhears a fight in another room.

03:01:17.160 --> 03:01:19.160
A man has caught his wife cheating.

03:01:19.160 --> 03:01:21.160
It's tense and upsetting, and for a brief moment,

03:01:21.160 --> 03:01:23.160
it feels like you're in a world

03:01:23.160 --> 03:01:25.160
with a bunch of different stories happening in it.

03:01:25.160 --> 03:01:28.160
Then it turns out she cheated because they're both augmented.

03:01:28.160 --> 03:01:30.160
I guess I wanted to be reminded of what it was like

03:01:30.160 --> 03:01:33.160
to be with someone normal.

03:01:33.160 --> 03:01:36.160
You were the one who wanted us to get enhanced.

03:01:36.160 --> 03:01:38.160
Now you're saying we're not normal anymore.

03:01:39.160 --> 03:01:41.160
Well, now try not to touch me too often

03:01:41.160 --> 03:01:45.160
with my cold, dead, metal hand, okay?

03:01:45.160 --> 03:01:47.160
I'm sad about my metal hand.

03:01:47.160 --> 03:01:49.160
Ah! That's the story in a nutshell.

03:01:49.160 --> 03:01:51.160
Granted, it's not quite as iconic

03:01:51.160 --> 03:01:53.160
as I never asked for this.

03:01:53.160 --> 03:01:55.160
Purity First's motivations are that they don't like

03:01:55.160 --> 03:01:58.160
augmentations because they pollute the human body.

03:01:58.160 --> 03:02:00.160
They hate them for this vague reason

03:02:00.160 --> 03:02:02.160
so much they're willing to break into buildings,

03:02:02.160 --> 03:02:05.160
take hostages, kill them with gas, and so on.

03:02:05.160 --> 03:02:07.160
They dress evocative of Christian monks

03:02:07.160 --> 03:02:09.160
with the prayer rope and everything

03:02:09.160 --> 03:02:12.160
and wear a band over their arms with their group's logo on it.

03:02:12.160 --> 03:02:14.160
Wow, I wonder what this is meant to remind people of.

03:02:14.160 --> 03:02:17.160
Jesus Christ, you killed him, huh?

03:02:17.160 --> 03:02:18.160
He asked for it.

03:02:18.160 --> 03:02:20.160
Kept calling me a bigot.

03:02:20.160 --> 03:02:22.160
He called me a bigot, so I murdered him.

03:02:22.160 --> 03:02:24.160
You see, when you zoom in really closely

03:02:24.160 --> 03:02:26.160
on one aspect of your setting,

03:02:26.160 --> 03:02:28.160
you obscure the big picture in ways

03:02:28.160 --> 03:02:30.160
that make it less interesting than if it was part of the whole.

03:02:30.160 --> 03:02:32.160
Take Detroit, the city the American portions

03:02:32.160 --> 03:02:34.160
of the game are set in.

03:02:34.160 --> 03:02:36.160
Detroit, historically, is a city that was once prosperous,

03:02:36.160 --> 03:02:38.160
then went through a major decline

03:02:38.160 --> 03:02:40.160
as a result of the auto industry shipping

03:02:40.160 --> 03:02:42.160
most of the work to places that didn't have strong unions

03:02:42.160 --> 03:02:44.160
so they could pay them less.

03:02:44.160 --> 03:02:46.160
People in poorer countries and eventually robots

03:02:46.160 --> 03:02:48.160
in poorer countries make the cars

03:02:48.160 --> 03:02:50.160
they used to make in Detroit.

03:02:50.160 --> 03:02:52.160
There was also redlining, which effectively denied

03:02:52.160 --> 03:02:54.160
Black Detroiters the opportunities afforded

03:02:54.160 --> 03:02:56.160
by stable home ownership or being able

03:02:56.160 --> 03:02:58.160
to open new businesses of their own,

03:02:58.160 --> 03:03:00.160
which helped to ensure the economy had even less chance

03:03:00.160 --> 03:03:02.160
of recovering, and the thing is,

03:03:02.160 --> 03:03:04.160
the economic effects of historic racism

03:03:04.160 --> 03:03:06.160
don't go away overnight.

03:03:06.160 --> 03:03:08.160
When we invent cures for cancer or improved

03:03:08.160 --> 03:03:10.160
human body parts that don't get sick

03:03:10.160 --> 03:03:12.160
or let us run faster or jump higher

03:03:12.160 --> 03:03:14.160
or think harder, people from economically

03:03:14.160 --> 03:03:17.160
disadvantaged groups will have the least access.

03:03:17.160 --> 03:03:19.160
The rich will be building themselves better,

03:03:19.160 --> 03:03:21.160
and the poor will not.

03:03:21.160 --> 03:03:23.160
Meanwhile, if augmentation becomes necessary

03:03:23.160 --> 03:03:25.160
for certain jobs, like, say,

03:03:25.160 --> 03:03:27.160
truck drivers can get their brains augmented

03:03:27.160 --> 03:03:29.160
so they can drive all night without traditional

03:03:29.160 --> 03:03:31.160
need for sleep, that might become

03:03:31.160 --> 03:03:33.160
the expected norm for the job.

03:03:33.160 --> 03:03:35.160
While people might only hire drivers who don't need

03:03:35.160 --> 03:03:37.160
breaks to sleep, wage slavery would take on

03:03:37.160 --> 03:03:39.160
even more physical connotations.

03:03:39.160 --> 03:03:41.160
You could make a game about that idea,

03:03:41.160 --> 03:03:43.160
and this stuff is discussed

03:03:43.160 --> 03:03:45.160
at least briefly during the game.

03:03:45.160 --> 03:03:47.160
Several homeless NPCs talk about how they lost

03:03:47.160 --> 03:03:49.160
their jobs for refusing to be augmented,

03:03:49.160 --> 03:03:51.160
and several other NPCs have serious job anxiety

03:03:51.160 --> 03:03:53.160
or remark on how rich Adam must be

03:03:53.160 --> 03:03:55.160
to be so augmented.

03:03:55.160 --> 03:03:57.160
Listen, just because you have money

03:03:57.160 --> 03:03:59.160
doesn't make you better than me.

03:03:59.160 --> 03:04:01.160
The Hengsha level has a whole side quest

03:04:01.160 --> 03:04:03.160
covering sex workers being forcibly augmented,

03:04:03.160 --> 03:04:05.160
not just to serve clients,

03:04:05.160 --> 03:04:07.160
but because it means they won't be able to quit

03:04:07.160 --> 03:04:09.160
without losing access to the anti-rejection drugs

03:04:09.160 --> 03:04:11.160
you have to take for life once you get an augmentation.

03:04:11.160 --> 03:04:13.160
Human Revolution strays

03:04:13.160 --> 03:04:15.160
dangerously close to making actual

03:04:15.160 --> 03:04:17.160
real social commentary here.

03:04:17.160 --> 03:04:19.160
In the last level, lots of the construction workers

03:04:19.160 --> 03:04:21.160
have tools where their arms would be.

03:04:21.160 --> 03:04:23.160
I'm gonna go ahead and call this body horror.

03:04:23.160 --> 03:04:25.160
This is what the future might do

03:04:25.160 --> 03:04:27.160
to working people, but did you see

03:04:27.160 --> 03:04:29.160
how deep I had to dig to pull out that point just now?

03:04:29.160 --> 03:04:31.160
This game is supposed to be about

03:04:31.160 --> 03:04:33.160
human augmentation and its effect

03:04:33.160 --> 03:04:35.160
on the world, but I had to talk about specific

03:04:35.160 --> 03:04:37.160
random NPCs and the one

03:04:37.160 --> 03:04:39.160
side quest that really went into it

03:04:39.160 --> 03:04:41.160
and stare at random enemies in the last level

03:04:41.160 --> 03:04:43.160
to find some kind of relevant observation.

03:04:43.160 --> 03:04:45.160
If anything about this game's story

03:04:45.160 --> 03:04:47.160
is lacking is how it's swimming in an ocean

03:04:47.160 --> 03:04:49.160
of meaningful questions and points,

03:04:49.160 --> 03:04:51.160
but the actual plot blows past it all

03:04:51.160 --> 03:04:53.160
to be about terrorists who hate orgs

03:04:53.160 --> 03:04:55.160
and org lovers and the bad men

03:04:55.160 --> 03:04:57.160
who kidnapped your girlfriend.

03:04:57.160 --> 03:04:59.160
Let's take another look at some of Purity First's

03:04:59.160 --> 03:05:01.160
literature they leave strewn around the office

03:05:01.160 --> 03:05:03.160
they broke into. This stuff about physical

03:05:03.160 --> 03:05:05.160
limitations being human and not changing

03:05:05.160 --> 03:05:07.160
the body is just bullshit.

03:05:07.160 --> 03:05:09.160
These fuckers are against pacemakers.

03:05:09.160 --> 03:05:11.160
They don't have a valuable point to make here,

03:05:11.160 --> 03:05:13.160
and that's okay. Purity First are

03:05:13.160 --> 03:05:15.160
deliberately written and presented in the game

03:05:15.160 --> 03:05:17.160
as misguided radicals, which isn't

03:05:17.160 --> 03:05:19.160
necessarily a bad choice, but it does mean

03:05:19.160 --> 03:05:21.160
this group doesn't have anything interesting

03:05:21.160 --> 03:05:23.160
to say. The NSF are a great

03:05:23.160 --> 03:05:25.160
faction in the first game because their perspective

03:05:25.160 --> 03:05:27.160
is genuinely interesting, at least partially

03:05:27.160 --> 03:05:29.160
valid, and everything their leaders say

03:05:29.160 --> 03:05:31.160
is just fucking true. There's a reason

03:05:31.160 --> 03:05:33.160
every line this guy speaks is iconic.

03:05:33.160 --> 03:05:35.160
You switch sides and work with

03:05:35.160 --> 03:05:37.160
these guys partway through and it works

03:05:37.160 --> 03:05:39.160
here because they were never presented as the

03:05:39.160 --> 03:05:41.160
dumbest boys in the world, but yeah,

03:05:41.160 --> 03:05:43.160
sure, hearing aids are immoral.

03:05:43.160 --> 03:05:45.160
Nice one, buddy. Say hi to Ted

03:05:45.160 --> 03:05:47.160
in prison for me, but here's the real shitter,

03:05:47.160 --> 03:05:49.160
right? In between these two statements

03:05:49.160 --> 03:05:51.160
is a really interesting one. This one

03:05:51.160 --> 03:05:53.160
actually reaches for an important point.

03:05:53.160 --> 03:05:55.160
It comes close to saying what a lot

03:05:55.160 --> 03:05:57.160
of people say right now about modern technology

03:05:57.160 --> 03:05:59.160
like electric cars or self-driving

03:05:59.160 --> 03:06:01.160
cars or space rockets, namely

03:06:01.160 --> 03:06:03.160
that even if they work, they're not the thing

03:06:03.160 --> 03:06:05.160
humanity needs right now, and

03:06:05.160 --> 03:06:07.160
wasting resources on them at a time like this

03:06:07.160 --> 03:06:09.160
while so many real problems go unsolved

03:06:09.160 --> 03:06:11.160
is a tragedy history won't look back

03:06:11.160 --> 03:06:13.160
on kindly. If there even are any historians

03:06:13.160 --> 03:06:15.160
left in 50 years, Purity

03:06:15.160 --> 03:06:17.160
First could easily have been written as a

03:06:17.160 --> 03:06:19.160
principled faction and represented a

03:06:19.160 --> 03:06:21.160
tangible perspective, but instead

03:06:21.160 --> 03:06:23.160
any of their justifiable motivations

03:06:23.160 --> 03:06:25.160
are relegated to the back page of a

03:06:25.160 --> 03:06:27.160
PDF and they're shooting people for calling

03:06:27.160 --> 03:06:29.160
them racist. You could have, for example,

03:06:29.160 --> 03:06:31.160
made them a group with a cohesive

03:06:31.160 --> 03:06:33.160
ideology, like what if they were anti-augmentation

03:06:33.160 --> 03:06:35.160
specifically because they saw

03:06:35.160 --> 03:06:37.160
the impact it would have on working people

03:06:37.160 --> 03:06:39.160
who couldn't afford them or who would be expected

03:06:39.160 --> 03:06:41.160
to get them to keep their jobs?

03:06:41.160 --> 03:06:43.160
What if they weren't even anti-augmentation

03:06:43.160 --> 03:06:45.160
per se and this break-in was a cover

03:06:45.160 --> 03:06:47.160
to steal for people who need access to

03:06:47.160 --> 03:06:49.160
augmentations but can't afford them?

03:06:49.160 --> 03:06:51.160
Alexander's is established as a veteran.

03:06:51.160 --> 03:06:53.160
He belongs to a group that maybe could do with

03:06:53.160 --> 03:06:55.160
access to replacement limbs. There were so

03:06:55.160 --> 03:06:57.160
many compelling ways of writing this group

03:06:57.160 --> 03:06:59.160
but instead they went with the Nazi

03:06:59.160 --> 03:07:01.160
sash-wearing purity terrorist gang.

03:07:01.160 --> 03:07:03.160
You think we're breaking the law.

03:07:03.160 --> 03:07:05.160
Shut up!

03:07:05.160 --> 03:07:07.160
All you body polluters break laws.

03:07:07.160 --> 03:07:09.160
You're all the same. I don't like augmentations

03:07:09.160 --> 03:07:11.160
because I'm the bad guy.

03:07:11.160 --> 03:07:13.160
Ah! Even though there's plenty room to

03:07:13.160 --> 03:07:15.160
discuss augmentation in a nuanced way,

03:07:15.160 --> 03:07:17.160
it's instead often used as a stand-in

03:07:17.160 --> 03:07:19.160
for other real-world issues.

03:07:19.160 --> 03:07:21.160
There's newspaper articles about how an augmented

03:07:21.160 --> 03:07:23.160
black woman has had to deal with bigotry,

03:07:23.160 --> 03:07:25.160
not just for her race, but now also

03:07:25.160 --> 03:07:27.160
for being augmented. First racism

03:07:27.160 --> 03:07:29.160
and now robot arms.

03:07:29.160 --> 03:07:31.160
People are coming up with special new slurs

03:07:31.160 --> 03:07:33.160
for augmented people. Mechs, clanks,

03:07:33.160 --> 03:07:35.160
cogs, chrome boy.

03:07:35.160 --> 03:07:37.160
Chrome boy? Chrome boy.

03:07:37.160 --> 03:07:39.160
Chrome boy. Hanses? They put more

03:07:39.160 --> 03:07:41.160
creativity into clever new terms

03:07:41.160 --> 03:07:43.160
for cyber racism than they did

03:07:43.160 --> 03:07:45.160
into actually talking about the issues

03:07:45.160 --> 03:07:47.160
that come into play if human augmentation

03:07:47.160 --> 03:07:49.160
becomes available. It feels a bit like

03:07:49.160 --> 03:07:51.160
they're adding augmentation on top of these

03:07:51.160 --> 03:07:53.160
other things, like racism, abortion,

03:07:53.160 --> 03:07:55.160
drug abuse, or prostitution

03:07:55.160 --> 03:07:57.160
in order to bring additional depth to their central

03:07:57.160 --> 03:07:59.160
theme. It's a little gross at times.

03:07:59.160 --> 03:08:01.160
You don't need an abortion poster

03:08:01.160 --> 03:08:03.160
to make transhumanism look like a topical

03:08:03.160 --> 03:08:05.160
idea. I just think this is unnecessary

03:08:05.160 --> 03:08:07.160
and crass. The Hengsha side quest

03:08:07.160 --> 03:08:09.160
deserves special attention here. The idea

03:08:09.160 --> 03:08:11.160
of forcing sex workers to need an anti-rejection

03:08:11.160 --> 03:08:13.160
drug is a little too close

03:08:13.160 --> 03:08:15.160
to one-to-one substitution for a real

03:08:15.160 --> 03:08:17.160
problem. Sex workers being addicted,

03:08:17.160 --> 03:08:19.160
often forcefully, to drugs as

03:08:19.160 --> 03:08:21.160
a means of control. Like, making it so

03:08:21.160 --> 03:08:23.160
the drug they need is because of an augmentation

03:08:23.160 --> 03:08:25.160
is just crowbarring your silly sci-fi

03:08:25.160 --> 03:08:27.160
concept into an already existing

03:08:27.160 --> 03:08:29.160
real problem. The game isn't using

03:08:29.160 --> 03:08:31.160
this sequence as a way of saying anything about

03:08:31.160 --> 03:08:33.160
the sex industry beyond that it's bad

03:08:33.160 --> 03:08:35.160
that trafficking happens, which, okay,

03:08:35.160 --> 03:08:37.160
glad we're on the same page, and it's not saying anything

03:08:37.160 --> 03:08:39.160
about augmentation except that I guess

03:08:39.160 --> 03:08:41.160
it might add to an already existing

03:08:41.160 --> 03:08:43.160
form of exploitation. It's here

03:08:43.160 --> 03:08:45.160
so you can punch three guys and save a lady

03:08:45.160 --> 03:08:47.160
and she can go, wow, you saved me

03:08:47.160 --> 03:08:49.160
and then she evaporates.

03:08:49.160 --> 03:08:51.160
We fade to black and she ceases to exist.

03:08:51.160 --> 03:08:53.160
Did we just solve sex

03:08:53.160 --> 03:08:55.160
trafficking? And we have to talk a little about

03:08:55.160 --> 03:08:57.160
how prostitution is used in the game.

03:08:57.160 --> 03:08:59.160
Sex workers are a large presence in both

03:08:59.160 --> 03:09:01.160
main hubs and it feels like this was done to

03:09:01.160 --> 03:09:03.160
make a point about how bad things are getting.

03:09:03.160 --> 03:09:05.160
Like, the writers wanted to write a dystopian

03:09:05.160 --> 03:09:07.160
future and their minds instantly went to

03:09:07.160 --> 03:09:09.160
there's a lot of prostitutes everywhere.

03:09:09.160 --> 03:09:11.160
I'm curious if the writers spoke to

03:09:11.160 --> 03:09:13.160
any sex workers and asked them how

03:09:13.160 --> 03:09:15.160
they felt about being used as a signifier

03:09:15.160 --> 03:09:17.160
for societal collapse.

03:09:17.160 --> 03:09:19.160
This problem is bigger than Human Revolution,

03:09:19.160 --> 03:09:21.160
obviously. Prostitutes, and more specifically

03:09:21.160 --> 03:09:23.160
Asian robo-prostitutes, have been a

03:09:23.160 --> 03:09:25.160
fixture of cyberpunk fiction since

03:09:25.160 --> 03:09:27.160
its inception. These stories have always

03:09:27.160 --> 03:09:29.160
leaned on combining the mystery of future

03:09:29.160 --> 03:09:31.160
technology with the exoticism

03:09:31.160 --> 03:09:33.160
of foreign cultures. We certainly shouldn't

03:09:33.160 --> 03:09:35.160
interrogate the Orientalism inherent

03:09:35.160 --> 03:09:36.160
in that trope.

03:09:36.160 --> 03:09:38.160
Alec, drop me off at the cyber brothel.

03:09:38.160 --> 03:09:40.160
Please. I need to look for key cards.

03:09:40.160 --> 03:09:42.160
The game is ham-fisted in how it

03:09:42.160 --> 03:09:44.160
talks about augmentations because when

03:09:44.160 --> 03:09:46.160
it comes down to it, the central question

03:09:46.160 --> 03:09:48.160
it decided to focus on, whether we should

03:09:48.160 --> 03:09:50.160
legislate human augmentation or not, just

03:09:50.160 --> 03:09:52.160
isn't as complicated as it might have seemed

03:09:52.160 --> 03:09:54.160
when they came up with it. Putting aside the

03:09:54.160 --> 03:09:56.160
questions about what it means to be human,

03:09:56.160 --> 03:09:58.160
the more tangible questions on the topic

03:09:58.160 --> 03:10:00.160
are a bit simpler. For example, if

03:10:00.160 --> 03:10:02.160
companies started developing prosthetic

03:10:02.160 --> 03:10:04.160
arms that can shoot explosives and kill

03:10:04.160 --> 03:10:06.160
everyone in an immediate radius, should

03:10:06.160 --> 03:10:08.160
there be regulations on who can have those?

03:10:08.160 --> 03:10:10.160
Uh...

03:10:10.160 --> 03:10:12.160
Yeah! They should

03:10:12.160 --> 03:10:14.160
probably ban the war crime blaster

03:10:14.160 --> 03:10:16.160
before the NRA decided

03:10:16.160 --> 03:10:18.160
every toddler's god-given right to

03:10:18.160 --> 03:10:20.160
bear robot arms. In this footage,

03:10:20.160 --> 03:10:22.160
I was trying to turn invisible and accidentally

03:10:22.160 --> 03:10:24.160
hit the button right next to it and fat-fingered

03:10:24.160 --> 03:10:26.160
my way into 12 consecutive

03:10:26.160 --> 03:10:28.160
life sentences.

03:10:28.160 --> 03:10:30.160
Pause the video and leave a comment

03:10:30.160 --> 03:10:32.160
if you think the government shouldn't regulate

03:10:32.160 --> 03:10:34.160
this. In order to make the questions seem

03:10:34.160 --> 03:10:36.160
more complicated, the game draws zero

03:10:36.160 --> 03:10:38.160
distinction between this and the types

03:10:38.160 --> 03:10:40.160
of theoretical augmentation we can all

03:10:40.160 --> 03:10:42.160
agree are great. Advanced prosthetics

03:10:42.160 --> 03:10:44.160
that recreate actual sensory information

03:10:44.160 --> 03:10:46.160
the way a hand would. Enabling people

03:10:46.160 --> 03:10:48.160
who have lost limbs to completely replace

03:10:48.160 --> 03:10:50.160
them. Fully functioning eye replacements.

03:10:50.160 --> 03:10:52.160
Things like that would be magical

03:10:52.160 --> 03:10:54.160
for a lot of people. The anti-augmentation

03:10:54.160 --> 03:10:56.160
groups are written to hate those too.

03:10:56.160 --> 03:10:58.160
Too much power can make you do terrible

03:10:58.160 --> 03:11:00.160
things, Mr. Jensen. Zeke Sanders

03:11:00.160 --> 03:11:02.160
ripped out his prosthetic eye because

03:11:02.160 --> 03:11:04.160
he hates augmentations that much.

03:11:04.160 --> 03:11:06.160
They're against all augmentations

03:11:06.160 --> 03:11:08.160
for pseudo-philosophical reasons to do

03:11:08.160 --> 03:11:10.160
with changing the core of humanity.

03:11:10.160 --> 03:11:12.160
We can save people from illnesses,

03:11:12.160 --> 03:11:14.160
amputation, disfigurement, disability,

03:11:14.160 --> 03:11:16.160
but at what cost? Ooh!

03:11:16.160 --> 03:11:18.160
Augmentations help a lot of people, Doc.

03:11:18.160 --> 03:11:20.160
Handicapped, war vets. Yes, but at

03:11:20.160 --> 03:11:22.160
what cost? I bet you thought I was joking,

03:11:22.160 --> 03:11:24.160
didn't you? No, they actually say that.

03:11:24.160 --> 03:11:26.160
Now, statistically, almost half the people

03:11:26.160 --> 03:11:28.160
watching this are wearing glasses or

03:11:28.160 --> 03:11:30.160
lenses like me. Many of you are watching this

03:11:30.160 --> 03:11:32.160
on the phone they also use whenever they need

03:11:32.160 --> 03:11:34.160
to check for information on almost any topic.

03:11:34.160 --> 03:11:36.160
We've already been supplementing our bodies

03:11:36.160 --> 03:11:38.160
and minds with technology for so long

03:11:38.160 --> 03:11:40.160
we've almost forgotten we're doing it.

03:11:40.160 --> 03:11:42.160
By surpassing our human limits,

03:11:42.160 --> 03:11:44.160
we're destroying our humanity, defeating

03:11:44.160 --> 03:11:46.160
the purpose of life. Oh, my God, you're totally

03:11:46.160 --> 03:11:48.160
right. We need to rid the world of people

03:11:48.160 --> 03:11:50.160
who supplement their bodies with those glasses?

03:11:50.160 --> 03:11:52.160
So your options

03:11:52.160 --> 03:11:54.160
in human revolution are between these

03:11:54.160 --> 03:11:56.160
jokers who are anti-medicine

03:11:56.160 --> 03:11:58.160
because ooh, what if life-saving surgery

03:11:58.160 --> 03:12:00.160
takes away some of your soul? Several of

03:12:00.160 --> 03:12:02.160
which turn out to be the fucking Illuminati

03:12:02.160 --> 03:12:04.160
and we can't let the government

03:12:04.160 --> 03:12:06.160
shut us down, Adam. Break into a police station

03:12:06.160 --> 03:12:08.160
for me. Also, don't forget we installed

03:12:08.160 --> 03:12:10.160
the secret explosion nightmare cannon in your body.

03:12:10.160 --> 03:12:12.160
Check this shit out. Yee-haw!

03:12:14.160 --> 03:12:16.160
The pro-regulation groups have to be

03:12:16.160 --> 03:12:18.160
written to be extremely stupid

03:12:18.160 --> 03:12:20.160
and working for the bad guys because otherwise

03:12:20.160 --> 03:12:22.160
there's no contest. The issue is made

03:12:22.160 --> 03:12:24.160
all or nothing. Corporations manufacturing

03:12:24.160 --> 03:12:26.160
concealed carry buster swords

03:12:26.160 --> 03:12:28.160
versus big government trying to ban

03:12:28.160 --> 03:12:30.160
what, the concept of prosthesis?

03:12:30.160 --> 03:12:32.160
Because that's the only way

03:12:32.160 --> 03:12:34.160
to turn the central focus of the game

03:12:34.160 --> 03:12:36.160
into something resembling a debate.

03:12:36.160 --> 03:12:38.160
Human revolution feels like its heart is

03:12:38.160 --> 03:12:40.160
in the right place, but it's afraid to say

03:12:40.160 --> 03:12:42.160
too much, so instead you get this

03:12:42.160 --> 03:12:44.160
really weak stuff like, uh, hey,

03:12:44.160 --> 03:12:46.160
maybe the military-industrial complex

03:12:46.160 --> 03:12:48.160
is bad.

03:12:48.160 --> 03:12:50.160
You're right. The teacher

03:12:50.160 --> 03:12:52.160
would just love having one of those things.

03:12:52.160 --> 03:12:54.160
Yeah, if you think about it, making weapons

03:12:54.160 --> 03:12:56.160
isn't as good for the world as making medicine.

03:12:56.160 --> 03:12:58.160
Wow! Later when

03:12:58.160 --> 03:13:00.160
riots start happening in Detroit,

03:13:00.160 --> 03:13:02.160
the riots are about augmentation, of course,

03:13:02.160 --> 03:13:04.160
the police have a police version of the robot

03:13:04.160 --> 03:13:06.160
you were fighting before. That's kinda

03:13:06.160 --> 03:13:08.160
cool. There's a point being made here by

03:13:08.160 --> 03:13:10.160
the reuse of an enemy from other parts of the game.

03:13:10.160 --> 03:13:12.160
You're literally seeing an enemy,

03:13:12.160 --> 03:13:14.160
but on the side of the cops. I mean,

03:13:14.160 --> 03:13:16.160
they got this idea from the original Deus Ex

03:13:16.160 --> 03:13:18.160
when you started seeing rebranded versions of mechs

03:13:18.160 --> 03:13:20.160
you'd seen before, but still. The game is saying,

03:13:20.160 --> 03:13:22.160
hey, maybe it's bad the police

03:13:22.160 --> 03:13:24.160
have tanks? They're arresting

03:13:24.160 --> 03:13:26.160
tons of people in the street too, but this is

03:13:26.160 --> 03:13:28.160
set dressing for the fact a riot is happening

03:13:28.160 --> 03:13:30.160
because people don't like augmentation.

03:13:30.160 --> 03:13:32.160
The commentary isn't, boy, the police really

03:13:32.160 --> 03:13:34.160
are making a bad situation worse by taking

03:13:34.160 --> 03:13:36.160
to the streets with automatic shotguns

03:13:36.160 --> 03:13:38.160
and fucking tachycomas. The commentary is,

03:13:38.160 --> 03:13:40.160
wow, things are really heating up about this augmentation

03:13:40.160 --> 03:13:42.160
thing, huh? The cops really have their hands

03:13:42.160 --> 03:13:44.160
full with all these crazy rioters. The game

03:13:44.160 --> 03:13:46.160
respects the cops so much you get

03:13:46.160 --> 03:13:48.160
hired to help them out during the same

03:13:48.160 --> 03:13:50.160
level where they're arresting everyone using a

03:13:50.160 --> 03:13:52.160
rocket mech. You can see what I mean, right?

03:13:52.160 --> 03:13:54.160
This is okay as far as writing for a video

03:13:54.160 --> 03:13:56.160
game goes, but terrible as far

03:13:56.160 --> 03:13:58.160
as writing a story goes. It really

03:13:58.160 --> 03:14:00.160
doesn't help that it feels like a few key steps

03:14:00.160 --> 03:14:02.160
of the story got cut out due to time limitations.

03:14:02.160 --> 03:14:04.160
In the second to last level, it's established

03:14:04.160 --> 03:14:06.160
that all the major characters from the plot

03:14:06.160 --> 03:14:08.160
can't be contacted because they're currently en route

03:14:08.160 --> 03:14:10.160
to a sea base in the middle of the Arctic Ocean.

03:14:10.160 --> 03:14:12.160
This travel time is important. Jensen

03:14:12.160 --> 03:14:14.160
then encounters Zhao Yun-Ru, the lady

03:14:14.160 --> 03:14:16.160
who tricked him earlier, who introduces the boss fight

03:14:16.160 --> 03:14:18.160
with the biochip reveal. Then it turns out Jensen

03:14:18.160 --> 03:14:20.160
needs to get to the Arctic Ocean base

03:14:20.160 --> 03:14:22.160
everyone else went to to stop the conspiracy

03:14:22.160 --> 03:14:24.160
happening there now, at which point it

03:14:24.160 --> 03:14:26.160
conveniently turns out there's a special

03:14:26.160 --> 03:14:28.160
person-sized rocket here which can launch

03:14:28.160 --> 03:14:30.160
him to the other side of the world faster

03:14:30.160 --> 03:14:32.160
than anyone's ever traveled anywhere on

03:14:32.160 --> 03:14:34.160
Earth before, so he goes there

03:14:34.160 --> 03:14:36.160
and Zhao Yun-Ru's there already.

03:14:36.160 --> 03:14:38.160
She got here before you and she's the

03:14:38.160 --> 03:14:40.160
final boss. Uh, hang on

03:14:40.160 --> 03:14:42.160
a second. How did you get here? Was there

03:14:42.160 --> 03:14:44.160
a second rocket stashed away somewhere?

03:14:44.160 --> 03:14:46.160
Can you give me the cliff notes on what is

03:14:46.160 --> 03:14:48.160
happening here? No wonder the last level

03:14:48.160 --> 03:14:50.160
takes place in a giant hole.

03:14:50.160 --> 03:14:52.160
Presumably in an earlier draft, there was

03:14:52.160 --> 03:14:54.160
a level or two between these, creating

03:14:54.160 --> 03:14:56.160
a time gap where it was plausible for Zhao Yun-Ru

03:14:56.160 --> 03:14:58.160
to get to the middle of the Arctic Ocean.

03:14:58.160 --> 03:15:00.160
When you land in the ocean in the cutscene,

03:15:00.160 --> 03:15:02.160
you just spawn on a landing pad

03:15:02.160 --> 03:15:04.160
next to all these helicopters where I assume

03:15:04.160 --> 03:15:06.160
you were going to get dropped off for a

03:15:06.160 --> 03:15:08.160
sensible reason in an earlier draft of the

03:15:08.160 --> 03:15:10.160
story, or maybe they just didn't

03:15:10.160 --> 03:15:12.160
care to explain this. I mean, Jensen

03:15:12.160 --> 03:15:14.160
doesn't even look for her before he leaves.

03:15:14.160 --> 03:15:16.160
She fucks up Jensen's augmentations,

03:15:16.160 --> 03:15:18.160
walks off screen, and he forgets

03:15:18.160 --> 03:15:20.160
she exists. Men never

03:15:20.160 --> 03:15:22.160
fail to forget where women are in

03:15:22.160 --> 03:15:24.160
physical space. Instead of building to

03:15:24.160 --> 03:15:26.160
some larger question, it builds towards a

03:15:26.160 --> 03:15:28.160
comical over-the-top video game zombie

03:15:28.160 --> 03:15:30.160
movie climax. The big reveal

03:15:30.160 --> 03:15:32.160
of the plot is that the Illuminati are figuring

03:15:32.160 --> 03:15:34.160
out a way to control people using their

03:15:34.160 --> 03:15:36.160
augmentations. Then one of them goes

03:15:36.160 --> 03:15:38.160
rogue and presses a button that makes everyone

03:15:38.160 --> 03:15:40.160
with an augmentation go insane. He does this

03:15:40.160 --> 03:15:42.160
to make a point about augmentations being

03:15:42.160 --> 03:15:44.160
bad. Adam Jensen, who didn't get

03:15:44.160 --> 03:15:46.160
the replacement chip, or did but got an injection

03:15:46.160 --> 03:15:48.160
of nanomachines, so he's fine.

03:15:48.160 --> 03:15:50.160
That's the explanation they give. Saves the day

03:15:50.160 --> 03:15:52.160
by flying to ground zero and turning it off.

03:15:52.160 --> 03:15:54.160
This is a waste of the potentially realistic

03:15:54.160 --> 03:15:56.160
and interesting ways you could have taken

03:15:56.160 --> 03:15:58.160
this story. Instead of seriously exploring

03:15:58.160 --> 03:16:00.160
the problems with centralization or

03:16:00.160 --> 03:16:02.160
authorities like governments having control over

03:16:02.160 --> 03:16:04.160
your life, it settles for the much less deep

03:16:04.160 --> 03:16:06.160
question, would it be bad if the

03:16:06.160 --> 03:16:08.160
Illuminati hacked your grandmother's

03:16:08.160 --> 03:16:10.160
hip replacement and made her into a killing

03:16:10.160 --> 03:16:12.160
machine? And the answer to that question,

03:16:12.160 --> 03:16:14.160
shockingly enough, is, yeah, that would

03:16:14.160 --> 03:16:16.160
be quite bad, but that's not science

03:16:16.160 --> 03:16:18.160
fiction or cyberpunk or transhumanism

03:16:18.160 --> 03:16:20.160
or discussing the implications of

03:16:20.160 --> 03:16:22.160
future technology. That's just stupid.

03:16:22.160 --> 03:16:24.160
You haven't told a story about

03:16:24.160 --> 03:16:26.160
power and control. You wrote a cartoon

03:16:26.160 --> 03:16:28.160
about how bad it would be if there was a big

03:16:28.160 --> 03:16:30.160
button that killed everyone. You're not presenting

03:16:30.160 --> 03:16:32.160
a nuanced issue here. You can

03:16:32.160 --> 03:16:34.160
most easily identify the core problems

03:16:34.160 --> 03:16:36.160
with the storytelling and how the game reuses

03:16:36.160 --> 03:16:38.160
ideas that were in the original, but in the

03:16:38.160 --> 03:16:40.160
complete opposite way. Okay, so

03:16:40.160 --> 03:16:42.160
in Deus Ex, one of the big things about the Illuminati

03:16:42.160 --> 03:16:44.160
and their offshoot, MJ-12,

03:16:44.160 --> 03:16:46.160
is they're super pretentious. No one

03:16:46.160 --> 03:16:48.160
names their AI algorithms Morpheus

03:16:48.160 --> 03:16:50.160
or Daedalus unless they like the smell

03:16:50.160 --> 03:16:52.160
of their own farts. Like, MJ-12's

03:16:52.160 --> 03:16:54.160
organizational structure and clearance levels

03:16:54.160 --> 03:16:56.160
are types of angel arranged in order

03:16:56.160 --> 03:16:58.160
of closeness to the throne of God,

03:16:58.160 --> 03:17:00.160
with the top one being literally God clearance

03:17:00.160 --> 03:17:02.160
and the one below it being Seraphic,

03:17:02.160 --> 03:17:04.160
like as in Seraphim. The founder of

03:17:04.160 --> 03:17:06.160
MJ-12 is writing Bible fanfiction

03:17:06.160 --> 03:17:08.160
and casting himself as

03:17:08.160 --> 03:17:10.160
God. This isn't just a piece of

03:17:10.160 --> 03:17:12.160
lore or meant to sound cool.

03:17:12.160 --> 03:17:14.160
This is a joke. Bob Page,

03:17:14.160 --> 03:17:16.160
the guy who started MJ-12, doesn't really

03:17:16.160 --> 03:17:18.160
understand the teachings of the Illuminati

03:17:18.160 --> 03:17:20.160
and thinks he's a genius, so to sound

03:17:20.160 --> 03:17:22.160
clever, he named the structure of his

03:17:22.160 --> 03:17:24.160
organization around stuff he thought sounded

03:17:24.160 --> 03:17:26.160
deep. Seraphic? Wow,

03:17:26.160 --> 03:17:28.160
I'm so smart. I'm a philosopher.

03:17:28.160 --> 03:17:30.160
I'm fucking play two.

03:17:30.160 --> 03:17:32.160
Page named the special AI he wanted

03:17:32.160 --> 03:17:34.160
to use to take over the world Icarus.

03:17:34.160 --> 03:17:36.160
This is a joke. He's trying

03:17:36.160 --> 03:17:38.160
to sound cool, and it's really silly.

03:17:38.160 --> 03:17:40.160
Like New Vegas with its Caesar cosplayer,

03:17:40.160 --> 03:17:42.160
Deus Ex is making fun of how stupid it is

03:17:42.160 --> 03:17:44.160
to try to sound clever by making surface

03:17:44.160 --> 03:17:46.160
references to stuff people think is deep.

03:17:46.160 --> 03:17:48.160
Cue Human Revolution, which bases

03:17:48.160 --> 03:17:50.160
a shit ton of its imagery around the myth

03:17:50.160 --> 03:17:52.160
of Icarus because it sounds deep.

I never asked for this.

Yay! Augmentation

03:18:04.160 --> 03:18:06.160
is like Icarus' wax wings,

03:18:06.160 --> 03:18:08.160
and the sun represents, uh,

03:18:08.160 --> 03:18:10.160
augmentation turning out to be bad.

03:18:10.160 --> 03:18:12.160
Look, I don't mean any offense to people

03:18:12.160 --> 03:18:14.160
who thought this was clever when this trailer came out.

03:18:14.160 --> 03:18:16.160
Demographically speaking, you were 15.

03:18:16.160 --> 03:18:18.160
I'm merely giving you the opportunity

03:18:18.160 --> 03:18:20.160
to consider that this might just look smart

03:18:20.160 --> 03:18:22.160
while not actually saying anything

03:18:22.160 --> 03:18:24.160
remotely relevant or useful

03:18:24.160 --> 03:18:26.160
about the world we live in, and this shit

03:18:26.160 --> 03:18:28.160
is omnipresent throughout the game.

03:18:28.160 --> 03:18:30.160
The first Icarus thing you see

03:18:30.160 --> 03:18:32.160
is the very first thing you see

03:18:32.160 --> 03:18:34.160
in the game. The slow fall augmentation

03:18:34.160 --> 03:18:36.160
is called the Icarus landing system.

03:18:36.160 --> 03:18:38.160
There's a book you can read in the game

03:18:38.160 --> 03:18:40.160
called Building Wings.

03:18:40.160 --> 03:18:42.160
The game's title theme on the soundtrack

03:18:42.160 --> 03:18:44.160
is called Icarus, of course. The tie-in novel

03:18:44.160 --> 03:18:46.160
for the game was named Deus Ex Icarus Effect,

03:18:46.160 --> 03:18:48.160
and then the tie-in novel

03:18:48.160 --> 03:18:50.160
had a tie-in game for phones

03:18:50.160 --> 03:18:52.160
and later the PC called Deus Ex

03:18:52.160 --> 03:18:54.160
The Fall because, you know, Icarus

03:18:54.160 --> 03:18:56.160
falling into the sea, which happens

03:18:56.160 --> 03:18:58.160
to the character in the game too. That sounds

03:18:58.160 --> 03:19:00.160
familiar. Oh, wait, because it also happens

03:19:00.160 --> 03:19:02.160
to Adam both in the game and then

03:19:02.160 --> 03:19:04.160
afterwards in the ending. He falls into the sea again

03:19:04.160 --> 03:19:06.160
then. In this world, everyone is Icarus

03:19:06.160 --> 03:19:08.160
drowning in the sea

03:19:08.160 --> 03:19:10.160
of this symbolism. The Fall was

03:19:10.160 --> 03:19:12.160
gonna have a slightly subtler title to begin with.

03:19:12.160 --> 03:19:14.160
According to unused images in the game's files,

03:19:14.160 --> 03:19:16.160
they were gonna call it Icarus Rising

03:19:16.160 --> 03:19:18.160
and, like, I hope I'm not the first person to point

03:19:18.160 --> 03:19:20.160
this out for you, but Sarif Industries' logo

03:19:20.160 --> 03:19:22.160
is just a fucking wing and Tai Yong Medical,

03:19:22.160 --> 03:19:24.160
their antagonist, their levels are all sun

03:19:24.160 --> 03:19:26.160
themed. Look, the sun is coming from both

03:19:26.160 --> 03:19:28.160
sides of the room at once because it's like they're

03:19:28.160 --> 03:19:30.160
bathed in the sun. You know, Icarus

03:19:30.160 --> 03:19:32.160
is natural enemy or something.

03:19:32.160 --> 03:19:34.160
Tai Yong is named that because that's the Chinese

03:19:34.160 --> 03:19:36.160
phrase for the sun. They wanted

03:19:36.160 --> 03:19:38.160
to continue their sun Icarus metaphor

03:19:38.160 --> 03:19:40.160
so they googled the sun in

03:19:40.160 --> 03:19:42.160
Chinese. Sarif is a deliberate

03:19:42.160 --> 03:19:44.160
pun on seraphim. Deus Ex

03:19:44.160 --> 03:19:46.160
literally made a joke about people who think

03:19:46.160 --> 03:19:48.160
referencing the seraphim is clever.

03:19:48.160 --> 03:19:50.160
This is the shit Bob Page would come up

03:19:50.160 --> 03:19:52.160
with if you made him write a Deus Ex game.

03:19:52.160 --> 03:19:54.160
Even the man responsible explains his

03:19:54.160 --> 03:19:56.160
motivations using a hackneyed Icarus

03:19:56.160 --> 03:19:58.160
metaphor. I prefer to think of myself as

03:19:58.160 --> 03:20:00.160
deadless, watching helplessly

03:20:00.160 --> 03:20:02.160
as his child crashes into the sea.

03:20:02.160 --> 03:20:04.160
Darrow is currently looking

03:20:04.160 --> 03:20:06.160
into an ocean we just crashed

03:20:06.160 --> 03:20:08.160
into as part of a previous unrelated

03:20:08.160 --> 03:20:10.160
flying too close to the sun crashing

03:20:10.160 --> 03:20:12.160
into the ocean metaphor. Watching

03:20:12.160 --> 03:20:14.160
helplessly as his child crashes

03:20:14.160 --> 03:20:16.160
into the sea. Read a second

03:20:16.160 --> 03:20:18.160
Greek myth. I'm begging you.

03:20:18.160 --> 03:20:20.160
Why do we build the wall? I think the moment

03:20:20.160 --> 03:20:22.160
I knew the game was gonna be really misguided

03:20:22.160 --> 03:20:24.160
was when one of the trailers flashed through a bunch

03:20:24.160 --> 03:20:26.160
of generic We Are Smart imagery

03:20:26.160 --> 03:20:28.160
and renaissance stuff and one of the things

03:20:28.160 --> 03:20:30.160
that flashes up is a sign saying we don't let

03:20:30.160 --> 03:20:32.160
augmented people in here. Like,

03:20:32.160 --> 03:20:34.160
okay, segregation.

03:20:34.160 --> 03:20:36.160
You're making a game about segregation,

03:20:36.160 --> 03:20:38.160
a real thing that is horrible,

03:20:38.160 --> 03:20:40.160
and you're also making a game about the cyber

03:20:40.160 --> 03:20:42.160
renaissance and how cool it is to reference

03:20:42.160 --> 03:20:44.160
the myth of Icarus. We flew too

03:20:44.160 --> 03:20:46.160
close to the big yong, and you

03:20:46.160 --> 03:20:48.160
know what that means?

03:20:48.160 --> 03:20:50.160
Apartheid. It sucks because,

03:20:50.160 --> 03:20:52.160
like, how many other games take their stories

03:20:52.160 --> 03:20:54.160
seriously enough that a main character says something

03:20:54.160 --> 03:20:56.160
like, hey, it's weird we spend most of our time

03:20:56.160 --> 03:20:58.160
inventing weapons for the government, right?

03:20:58.160 --> 03:21:00.160
I want to love any game that

03:21:00.160 --> 03:21:02.160
takes that step, but when that's the

03:21:02.160 --> 03:21:04.160
only step it takes and the other clever

03:21:04.160 --> 03:21:06.160
thing he says was only in the trailer,

03:21:06.160 --> 03:21:08.160
and the rest of the story is preoccupied with stuff

03:21:08.160 --> 03:21:10.160
the original game made fun of for being

03:21:10.160 --> 03:21:12.160
pretentious as shit, I've got to say

03:21:12.160 --> 03:21:14.160
I don't think it's out of place to expect

03:21:14.160 --> 03:21:16.160
a little more. Please, sir, can I have

03:21:16.160 --> 03:21:18.160
some more delicious sauce?

03:21:18.160 --> 03:21:20.160
Those elements mixed together is definitely

03:21:20.160 --> 03:21:22.160
like a sauce. The story being this

03:21:22.160 --> 03:21:24.160
simplistic makes the okay to mediocre

03:21:24.160 --> 03:21:26.160
gameplay feel so much worse.

03:21:26.160 --> 03:21:28.160
Even when the original was being annoying

03:21:28.160 --> 03:21:30.160
or awkward to play, you were a few minutes

03:21:30.160 --> 03:21:32.160
away from a truly fascinating conversation

03:21:32.160 --> 03:21:34.160
you couldn't get anywhere else.

03:21:34.160 --> 03:21:36.160
If you didn't like an aspect of the original's

03:21:36.160 --> 03:21:38.160
story, a lot more stuff was going on.

03:21:38.160 --> 03:21:40.160
Like the hacking minigame,

03:21:40.160 --> 03:21:42.160
if you think the augmentation stuff in

03:21:42.160 --> 03:21:44.160
Human Revolution is dumb, you can't escape it.

03:21:44.160 --> 03:21:46.160
It's everywhere. At every moment,

03:21:46.160 --> 03:21:48.160
right up until the plot manages to drag

03:21:48.160 --> 03:21:50.160
itself over the finish line.

03:21:50.160 --> 03:21:52.160
Human Revolution's

03:21:52.160 --> 03:21:54.160
endings are what would happen

03:21:54.160 --> 03:21:56.160
if a fart could die.

03:21:56.160 --> 03:21:58.160
After defeating the final boss once she plugs

03:21:58.160 --> 03:22:00.160
herself into a supercomputer powered by

03:22:00.160 --> 03:22:02.160
screaming women, if that seems like it came out of

03:22:02.160 --> 03:22:04.160
left field, that's because it did, you get to

03:22:04.160 --> 03:22:06.160
pick how the game ends. Now, the original

03:22:06.160 --> 03:22:08.160
game was criticized for how the endings weren't

03:22:08.160 --> 03:22:10.160
based on your choices throughout the story or

03:22:10.160 --> 03:22:12.160
their wider consequences, but instead on what

03:22:12.160 --> 03:22:14.160
you chose to do in the final level.

03:22:14.160 --> 03:22:16.160
Each of the endings had its own unique set of objectives,

03:22:16.160 --> 03:22:18.160
but still, it means only the last

03:22:18.160 --> 03:22:20.160
20 minutes of the game affects how the

03:22:20.160 --> 03:22:22.160
story ends. The creators of Human

03:22:22.160 --> 03:22:24.160
Revolution decided to give players something

03:22:24.160 --> 03:22:26.160
to really complain about. Now you

03:22:26.160 --> 03:22:28.160
pick an ending from one of three buttons at

03:22:28.160 --> 03:22:30.160
a computer, which decides who gets blamed

03:22:30.160 --> 03:22:32.160
for augmented people turning into zombies

03:22:32.160 --> 03:22:34.160
for 40 minutes. There's also a fourth

03:22:34.160 --> 03:22:36.160
button which destroys the entire ocean

03:22:36.160 --> 03:22:38.160
facility, meaning no one has any idea

03:22:38.160 --> 03:22:40.160
what really happened and everyone on the

03:22:40.160 --> 03:22:42.160
facility, including Adam, dies.

03:22:42.160 --> 03:22:44.160
You don't get to see what actually happens when you

03:22:44.160 --> 03:22:46.160
press any button, though. The ending cinematics

03:22:46.160 --> 03:22:48.160
are just shots of actual protests and shit.

03:22:48.160 --> 03:22:50.160
Tinted yellow, obviously. Can't let

03:22:50.160 --> 03:22:52.160
this actual news footage of real police

03:22:52.160 --> 03:22:54.160
brutality ruin your visual aesthetic,

03:22:54.160 --> 03:22:56.160
bro. Big bro.

03:22:56.160 --> 03:22:58.160
This oil spill footage wasn't deep enough

03:22:58.160 --> 03:23:00.160
so we made it cyber.

03:23:00.160 --> 03:23:02.160
Think about it. Adam shoots

03:23:02.160 --> 03:23:04.160
the shit about life, the universe, and

03:23:04.160 --> 03:23:06.160
everything, and the credits roll. Then you

03:23:06.160 --> 03:23:08.160
get a post-credits scene where Adam's ex-girlfriend

03:23:08.160 --> 03:23:10.160
talks to Bob Page and the game cuts

03:23:10.160 --> 03:23:12.160
to a title screen and the original Deus Ex

03:23:12.160 --> 03:23:14.160
theme starts playing, as if to say,

03:23:14.160 --> 03:23:16.160
do you get it?

03:23:18.160 --> 03:23:20.160
Yes, I did get it. That was

03:23:20.160 --> 03:23:22.160
what you were referencing. Thank you. These

03:23:22.160 --> 03:23:24.160
endings have been criticized to hell and back already,

03:23:24.160 --> 03:23:26.160
but what I find fascinating about that is how their

03:23:26.160 --> 03:23:28.160
extreme badness rescued the

03:23:28.160 --> 03:23:30.160
game from more hard-hitting criticism.

03:23:30.160 --> 03:23:32.160
People complain about the endings and then

03:23:32.160 --> 03:23:34.160
don't have room to talk about the incomprehensible

03:23:34.160 --> 03:23:36.160
final boss who, just to make it clear,

03:23:36.160 --> 03:23:38.160
I still don't know how to beat, the

03:23:38.160 --> 03:23:40.160
you-win cinematic just seems to play on its

03:23:40.160 --> 03:23:42.160
own eventually, or how the last level just

03:23:42.160 --> 03:23:44.160
throws the whole gameplay structure out the window,

03:23:44.160 --> 03:23:46.160
the second half's complete lack of

03:23:46.160 --> 03:23:48.160
almost any side quests, and the fact you haven't

03:23:48.160 --> 03:23:50.160
made a single impactive choice

03:23:50.160 --> 03:23:52.160
in the game except how long you dawdle

03:23:52.160 --> 03:23:54.160
in your office and whether to fall for

03:23:54.160 --> 03:23:56.160
an obvious trap. The endings being

03:23:56.160 --> 03:23:58.160
this memorably bad has almost

03:23:58.160 --> 03:24:00.160
done the game a service. Hey, uh,

03:24:00.160 --> 03:24:02.160
designers, if you're making a game

03:24:02.160 --> 03:24:04.160
and you're worried it's a bit mediocre, have

03:24:04.160 --> 03:24:06.160
the endings be complete shit. Just nosedive

03:24:06.160 --> 03:24:08.160
it at the last possible second.

03:24:08.160 --> 03:24:10.160
People will think your game is decent and just

03:24:10.160 --> 03:24:12.160
let down by the endings and forget

03:24:12.160 --> 03:24:14.160
they spent half of it in a vent looking for

03:24:14.160 --> 03:24:16.160
the next forced hacking minigame.

03:24:16.160 --> 03:24:18.160
All that said, at least Human Revolution

03:24:18.160 --> 03:24:20.160
has endings. Mankind Divided just

03:24:20.160 --> 03:24:22.160
ends by hacking.

03:24:22.160 --> 03:24:24.160
["Human Revolution"]

03:24:24.160 --> 03:24:26.160
["Human Revolution"]

03:24:26.160 --> 03:24:28.160
["Human Revolution"]

03:24:28.160 --> 03:24:29.660
It doesn't go that low.

03:24:29.660 --> 03:24:31.660
Oh, you're kidding me. So that's

03:24:31.660 --> 03:24:33.660
Deus Ex Human Revolution, a really

03:24:33.660 --> 03:24:35.660
decent game with a pretty flawed story

03:24:35.660 --> 03:24:37.660
and vastly simplified mechanics

03:24:37.660 --> 03:24:39.660
and design from its predecessor in the hope

03:24:39.660 --> 03:24:41.660
a streamlined experience would appeal

03:24:41.660 --> 03:24:43.660
to more people than the original, and

03:24:43.660 --> 03:24:45.660
to be sure, it did. It sold

03:24:45.660 --> 03:24:47.660
and reviewed really well, and it

03:24:47.660 --> 03:24:49.660
deserved to. If it didn't come with the baggage

03:24:49.660 --> 03:24:51.660
and expectations of being a Deus Ex

03:24:51.660 --> 03:24:53.660
game, I'd call it an okay but extremely

03:24:53.660 --> 03:24:55.660
promising first game from a new

03:24:55.660 --> 03:24:57.660
studio, and broadly speaking, I

03:24:57.660 --> 03:24:59.660
think Mankind Divided delivered on many of

03:24:59.660 --> 03:25:01.660
those promises five years later. You can

03:25:01.660 --> 03:25:03.660
even pick up and throw plants now!

03:25:03.660 --> 03:25:05.660
Hey, guys, you seeing this?

03:25:05.660 --> 03:25:07.660
Why did no one

03:25:07.660 --> 03:25:09.660
tell me about this?

03:25:09.660 --> 03:25:11.660
Mankind Divided's quality is a story for

03:25:11.660 --> 03:25:13.660
another video, but for now it's worth asking,

03:25:13.660 --> 03:25:15.660
hey, it's been another five

03:25:15.660 --> 03:25:17.660
years. Where's the sequel to Mankind

03:25:17.660 --> 03:25:19.660
Divided? Where's MD2,

03:25:19.660 --> 03:25:21.660
if you will? Well,

03:25:21.660 --> 03:25:23.660
Deus Ex's corporate masters are

03:25:23.660 --> 03:25:25.660
treating it about as well as they always have.

03:25:25.660 --> 03:25:27.660
This version of Deus Ex has been

03:25:27.660 --> 03:25:29.660
effectively abandoned, so we saw

03:25:29.660 --> 03:25:31.660
Eidos Montreal work on the next Tomb Raider

03:25:31.660 --> 03:25:33.660
and help out on the Avengers game and make

03:25:33.660 --> 03:25:35.660
that Guardians of the Galaxy thing.

03:25:35.660 --> 03:25:37.660
Several of the Deus Ex team's core

03:25:37.660 --> 03:25:39.660
membership quit en masse and went off to another

03:25:39.660 --> 03:25:41.660
studio a few years back. This includes

03:25:41.660 --> 03:25:43.660
our old friend Francois Lapikus, whose

03:25:43.660 --> 03:25:45.660
LinkedIn lists him as game director for almost

03:25:45.660 --> 03:25:47.660
four years on a cancelled project

03:25:47.660 --> 03:25:49.660
codenamed MD2.

03:25:49.660 --> 03:25:51.660
I wonder what that might have been.

03:25:51.660 --> 03:25:53.660
Immersive sims are hard to make and really

03:25:53.660 --> 03:25:55.660
expensive if you want to compete with other

03:25:55.660 --> 03:25:57.660
AAA games. Despite selling pretty well,

03:25:57.660 --> 03:25:59.660
Mankind Divided didn't set the world

03:25:59.660 --> 03:26:01.660
on fire the way it needed to to justify

03:26:01.660 --> 03:26:03.660
continued sequels. It's possible

03:26:03.660 --> 03:26:05.660
to make a game tons of people like,

03:26:05.660 --> 03:26:07.660
but not enough to play all the way to the end

03:26:07.660 --> 03:26:09.660
and whose sequel they might not even bother with

03:26:09.660 --> 03:26:11.660
even if they have fond memories of the

03:26:11.660 --> 03:26:13.660
previous one. I only started playing

03:26:13.660 --> 03:26:15.660
Mankind Divided in preparation for this video

03:26:15.660 --> 03:26:17.660
because I lost interest in the series after

03:26:17.660 --> 03:26:19.660
liking Human Revolution okay, but

03:26:19.660 --> 03:26:21.660
not being that into seeing more of the same.

03:26:21.660 --> 03:26:23.660
And many of my friends who

03:26:23.660 --> 03:26:25.660
remember liking Human Revolution way more

03:26:25.660 --> 03:26:27.660
than me still haven't got around to playing it

03:26:27.660 --> 03:26:29.660
either. What's the holdup?

03:26:29.660 --> 03:26:31.660
Perhaps the gamble of making a simpler, more

03:26:31.660 --> 03:26:33.660
generally marketable experience didn't

03:26:33.660 --> 03:26:35.660
pay off quite as well as it seemed.

03:26:35.660 --> 03:26:37.660
Maybe it's possible to make something thousands

03:26:37.660 --> 03:26:39.660
of people like, but don't necessarily

03:26:39.660 --> 03:26:41.660
love, at least not enough to

03:26:41.660 --> 03:26:43.660
come back for more. Human Revolution

03:26:43.660 --> 03:26:45.660
definitely has its diehard fans,

03:26:45.660 --> 03:26:47.660
and that's cool, but a lot of its players

03:26:47.660 --> 03:26:49.660
simply liked it and then stopped halfway

03:26:49.660 --> 03:26:51.660
through to play something else and never came

03:26:51.660 --> 03:26:53.660
back. Sure, making health systems

03:26:53.660 --> 03:26:55.660
more like Call of Duty or adding cover

03:26:55.660 --> 03:26:57.660
mechanics to make it more like Gears of War

03:26:57.660 --> 03:26:59.660
might sound like a positive selling

03:26:59.660 --> 03:27:01.660
point on a slideshow in a meeting,

03:27:01.660 --> 03:27:03.660
but the people who love those games already have

03:27:03.660 --> 03:27:05.660
a game that does them better than Human Revolution

03:27:05.660 --> 03:27:07.660
did, and people who actually liked

03:27:07.660 --> 03:27:09.660
Deus Ex's complexity don't get

03:27:09.660 --> 03:27:11.660
that in Human Revolution. So

03:27:11.660 --> 03:27:13.660
who would come back for more of this?

03:27:13.660 --> 03:27:15.660
That's definitely not the whole story.

03:27:15.660 --> 03:27:17.660
Square Enix and Eidos Montreal's

03:27:17.660 --> 03:27:19.660
management certainly squandered all the good

03:27:19.660 --> 03:27:21.660
will the developers had rightfully earned

03:27:21.660 --> 03:27:23.660
with their pre-order bullshit and

03:27:23.660 --> 03:27:25.660
in-game microtransactions bullshit

03:27:25.660 --> 03:27:27.660
and the free-to-play game glued

03:27:27.660 --> 03:27:29.660
to the side of a game people already

03:27:29.660 --> 03:27:31.660
paid money for, but when it comes down

03:27:31.660 --> 03:27:33.660
to it, as good as Human Revolution

03:27:33.660 --> 03:27:35.660
was, the one thing it wasn't was

03:27:35.660 --> 03:27:37.660
a sequel seller. Who's on the edge of

03:27:37.660 --> 03:27:39.660
their seats to find out what happens next

03:27:39.660 --> 03:27:41.660
to endings like these? Also,

03:27:41.660 --> 03:27:43.660
you know, it's a prequel. We kind

03:27:43.660 --> 03:27:45.660
of know what happens next.

03:27:45.660 --> 03:27:47.660
Deus Ex was once a game people loved

03:27:47.660 --> 03:27:49.660
so much, a company decided it was worth

03:27:49.660 --> 03:27:51.660
making another one many years later.

03:27:51.660 --> 03:27:53.660
Do people love Human Revolution

03:27:53.660 --> 03:27:55.660
the same way, or do they simply

03:27:55.660 --> 03:27:57.660
like it? I think that if

03:27:57.660 --> 03:27:59.660
Human Revolution had come out two years after

03:27:59.660 --> 03:28:01.660
the original Deus Ex on a slightly

03:28:01.660 --> 03:28:03.660
updated version of the original's engine,

03:28:03.660 --> 03:28:05.660
people would instantly see what's lacking about

03:28:05.660 --> 03:28:07.660
it, dismiss it as a mediocre imitator

03:28:07.660 --> 03:28:09.660
that didn't really understand what makes

03:28:09.660 --> 03:28:11.660
the original work. It would have been hated

03:28:11.660 --> 03:28:13.660
for the crime of failing to be

03:28:13.660 --> 03:28:15.660
as good as the best video game ever made.

03:28:15.660 --> 03:28:17.660
I wonder if that's common in gaming

03:28:17.660 --> 03:28:19.660
culture, but it didn't come out two years

03:28:19.660 --> 03:28:21.660
later. It came out a decade later

03:28:21.660 --> 03:28:23.660
in a market that hadn't seen anything like

03:28:23.660 --> 03:28:25.660
it for a long time. It was a relief

03:28:25.660 --> 03:28:27.660
a game even a bit like Deus Ex

03:28:27.660 --> 03:28:29.660
could still get made. It was a breath

03:28:29.660 --> 03:28:31.660
of fresh air to the 2011 game

03:28:31.660 --> 03:28:33.660
industry. It's just that when you compare

03:28:33.660 --> 03:28:35.660
it with the games it's trying to be like,

03:28:35.660 --> 03:28:37.660
it doesn't hold up quite so well. The quality

03:28:37.660 --> 03:28:39.660
of other recent immersive sims,

03:28:39.660 --> 03:28:41.660
including Mankind Divided, demonstrates

03:28:41.660 --> 03:28:43.660
the true classics of the genre are as good

03:28:43.660 --> 03:28:45.660
as they are because they dedicate themselves to doing

03:28:45.660 --> 03:28:47.660
what they do well. The first Deus Ex

03:28:47.660 --> 03:28:49.660
was a niche game, a weird

03:28:49.660 --> 03:28:51.660
complicated experience for a certain

03:28:51.660 --> 03:28:53.660
type of nerd. Us nerds loved

03:28:53.660 --> 03:28:55.660
it, and it sold pretty well, though

03:28:55.660 --> 03:28:57.660
not super amazingly. I'm pretty sure

03:28:57.660 --> 03:28:59.660
Human Revolution outsold it, but many

03:28:59.660 --> 03:29:01.660
developers working today are openly

03:29:01.660 --> 03:29:03.660
inspired by the first Deus Ex.

03:29:03.660 --> 03:29:05.660
I'm genuinely curious how many

03:29:05.660 --> 03:29:07.660
developers are specifically inspired

03:29:07.660 --> 03:29:09.660
by Human Revolution instead.

03:29:09.660 --> 03:29:17.660
So where do we put this guy on my list of every video game ranked in order of objective value?

03:29:17.660 --> 03:29:19.660
It's weird how no one thought to make one of

03:29:19.660 --> 03:29:21.660
these before. With heavy heart, I have no

03:29:21.660 --> 03:29:23.660
choice but to put this game on the very

03:29:23.660 --> 03:29:25.660
bottom of the list. There.

03:29:25.660 --> 03:29:27.660
As of the time of this video,

03:29:27.660 --> 03:29:29.660
Deus Ex Human Revolution is the worst

03:29:29.660 --> 03:29:31.660
game ever made. Oh, I forgot to add

03:29:31.660 --> 03:29:33.660
Fallout 3, the second worst game ever made.

03:29:33.660 --> 03:29:35.660
But hey, DXHR fans, try

03:29:35.660 --> 03:29:37.660
not to think of it that way. Try and think of it

03:29:37.660 --> 03:29:39.660
as the third best game. Maybe it'll

03:29:39.660 --> 03:29:41.660
even work out better than the next Gex.

03:29:41.660 --> 03:29:43.660
Gex! Gex! Gex! Sadly,

03:29:43.660 --> 03:29:45.660
it seems Square Enix are looking for fresh

03:29:45.660 --> 03:29:47.660
victims. In December last year, while I was

03:29:47.660 --> 03:29:49.660
deep in the making of this video and had already

03:29:49.660 --> 03:29:51.660
written a bunch of jokes for the conclusion about what

03:29:51.660 --> 03:29:53.660
lessons Square Enix needs to learn in time for the

03:29:53.660 --> 03:29:55.660
new Gex game, I had a really good joke about

03:29:55.660 --> 03:29:57.660
making sure Gex doesn't ride any elevators.

03:29:57.660 --> 03:29:59.660
Trust me. Squeenix went out and filed

03:29:59.660 --> 03:30:01.660
a new trademark for the Gex IP,

03:30:01.660 --> 03:30:03.660
making the intended joke of this video

03:30:03.660 --> 03:30:05.660
no longer a joke. They killed

03:30:05.660 --> 03:30:07.660
Thief, they killed Deus Ex, and

03:30:07.660 --> 03:30:09.660
they think they can take on a third. Let me

03:30:09.660 --> 03:30:11.660
be the first to say, good luck

03:30:11.660 --> 03:30:13.660
guys. When you come at the king,

03:30:13.660 --> 03:30:15.660
you better not miss. And if Gex

03:30:15.660 --> 03:30:17.660
has to do a single fucking

03:30:17.660 --> 03:30:19.660
hacking minigame...

03:30:35.660 --> 03:30:37.660
Hey, thanks for watching.

03:30:37.660 --> 03:30:39.660
I'm sorry. At the

03:30:39.660 --> 03:30:41.660
end of another long video, I promised I wouldn't

03:30:41.660 --> 03:30:43.660
make a video any longer than I already had.

03:30:43.660 --> 03:30:45.660
It's really embarrassing that I keep making

03:30:45.660 --> 03:30:47.660
things way longer. I tried.

03:30:47.660 --> 03:30:49.660
I really tried. I cut out a whole 15

03:30:49.660 --> 03:30:51.660
minutes about the history of mirrors in video

03:30:51.660 --> 03:30:53.660
games and made it a bonus video for patrons

03:30:53.660 --> 03:30:55.660
in the hopes of getting the length under control

03:30:55.660 --> 03:30:57.660
and it just kept growing. Thanks to all

03:30:57.660 --> 03:30:59.660
my patrons for allowing me to survive while

03:30:59.660 --> 03:31:01.660
making this. In case you're wondering,

03:31:01.660 --> 03:31:03.660
no, this isn't my normal recording setup.

03:31:03.660 --> 03:31:05.660
I'm actually visiting my producer

03:31:05.660 --> 03:31:07.660
on my way to a wedding and it

03:31:07.660 --> 03:31:09.660
turns out that she has

03:31:09.660 --> 03:31:11.660
put some foam up in her closet

03:31:11.660 --> 03:31:13.660
so I'm just recording here for now.

03:31:13.660 --> 03:31:15.660
If any of the voiceover sounds bad,

03:31:15.660 --> 03:31:17.660
it's her fault.

03:31:17.660 --> 03:31:19.660
And in case you asked, yes, these are

03:31:19.660 --> 03:31:21.660
the clothes I intend to wear for the wedding.

03:31:21.660 --> 03:31:23.660
I didn't bring any smart clothes to wear

03:31:23.660 --> 03:31:25.660
for recording the live action part of this video.

03:31:25.660 --> 03:31:27.660
And I forgot to bring shoes, so

03:31:27.660 --> 03:31:29.660
hopefully no one looks at my feet.

03:31:31.660 --> 03:31:33.660
I don't know why I brought that up.

03:31:33.660 --> 03:31:35.660
I went to Birmingham for

03:31:35.660 --> 03:31:37.660
a different wedding, like,

03:31:37.660 --> 03:31:39.660
four years ago and my car

03:31:39.660 --> 03:31:41.660
got broken into and my nice

03:31:41.660 --> 03:31:43.660
shoes were stolen and I never got

03:31:43.660 --> 03:31:45.660
replacements.

03:31:45.660 --> 03:31:47.660
So

03:32:15.660 --> 03:32:17.660
...

03:32:17.660 --> 03:32:19.660
...

03:32:19.660 --> 03:32:21.660
...

03:32:21.660 --> 03:32:23.660
...

03:32:23.660 --> 03:32:25.660
...

03:32:25.660 --> 03:32:27.660
...

03:32:27.660 --> 03:32:29.660
...

03:32:29.660 --> 03:32:31.660
...

03:32:31.660 --> 03:32:33.660
...

03:32:33.660 --> 03:32:35.660
...

03:32:35.660 --> 03:32:37.660
...

03:32:37.660 --> 03:32:39.660
...

03:32:39.660 --> 03:32:41.660
I've actually tried to make a video

03:32:41.660 --> 03:32:43.660
about Deus Ex Human Revolution.

03:32:43.660 --> 03:32:45.660
Every year and a half I've, like,

03:32:45.660 --> 03:32:47.660
restarted since

03:32:47.660 --> 03:32:49.660
2016. It was, like, the second long

03:32:49.660 --> 03:32:51.660
video I wanted to make and I just kept

03:32:51.660 --> 03:32:53.660
giving up because the

03:32:53.660 --> 03:32:55.660
video script ballooned to a length

03:32:55.660 --> 03:32:57.660
where I was like, this is unwatchable.

03:32:57.660 --> 03:32:59.660
And I only finished it this time because I just

03:32:59.660 --> 03:33:01.660
accepted I have to make

03:33:01.660 --> 03:33:03.660
a video that's too long to get

03:33:03.660 --> 03:33:05.660
this thing out of my brain and move on with my life.

03:33:05.660 --> 03:33:07.660
And now I'm finally free

03:33:07.660 --> 03:33:09.660
and I can move on to other things, which is lovely.

03:33:09.660 --> 03:33:11.660
So

03:33:11.660 --> 03:33:13.660
the next game I want to review

03:33:13.660 --> 03:33:15.660
is the Deus Ex

03:33:15.660 --> 03:33:17.660
Human Revolution Director's Cut

03:33:19.660 --> 03:33:21.660
and that is not a joke.

03:33:23.660 --> 03:33:25.660
And I'm scared.

03:33:29.660 --> 03:33:31.660
I'm scared about what is

03:33:31.660 --> 03:33:33.660
happening to me.
