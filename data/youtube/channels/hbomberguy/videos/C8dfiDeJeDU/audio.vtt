00:00.000 --> 00:06.920
Hey there. You might have noticed that I like to keep track of all the latest bizarre insults that internet weirdos like to come up with.

00:06.920 --> 00:13.040
You know, cultural Marxist, baiter, cuck, virtue-signaler, all the greats.

00:13.040 --> 00:16.480
One of the latest additions to that list is the term Soy Boy,

00:16.480 --> 00:23.240
which is used to decry everyone who's not like them as degenerate, feminized, weak losers

00:23.240 --> 00:26.920
who are also, for some reason, also leftists because of soy.

00:26.920 --> 00:28.440
So come...

00:31.300 --> 00:36.060
And for once, I hesitate to admit they've scored a slam dunk.

00:36.060 --> 00:37.400
They're onto us.

00:37.400 --> 00:41.440
They know that beans are the reason why leftists think what they believe.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.420
It can't be because of all the evidence.

00:43.440 --> 00:45.020
No. They've got us.

00:45.020 --> 00:48.620
And you can't prove otherwise, because that's just the objective truth.

00:48.620 --> 00:50.540
At least that's they think.

00:50.540 --> 00:53.040
Here's a comment from one of my latest videos.

00:53.240 --> 00:58.540
Go get your chocolates and wine, and cry in the bathtub, you silly cucks.

00:58.540 --> 01:02.840
High soy diets spike estrogen and lower testosterone.

01:02.840 --> 01:05.040
That's not a disputable fact.

01:06.640 --> 01:09.240
So! Let's dispute the facts!

01:12.840 --> 01:17.840
The theory that soy is bad for you stems from a certain superstition in the bodybuilding community.

01:17.840 --> 01:23.140
Here's the YouTube channel of Elliot Hulse, a professional bodybuilder with 1.7 million subscribers.

01:23.140 --> 01:25.840
Your entire body is your brain.

01:27.540 --> 01:29.640
Well, this guy knows what he's talking about.

01:29.640 --> 01:31.440
I wonder what he thinks about soy.

01:31.440 --> 01:34.040
Soy protein makes you weak and womanly.

01:34.040 --> 01:38.140
Almost every bit of soy in the United States, or in the West,

01:38.140 --> 01:41.240
you know, is going to be genetically modified.

01:41.240 --> 01:46.440
Now, I'm not saying pro or con for genetically modified foods, but it's fucking weird.

01:46.840 --> 01:50.440
It just, it sounds like freakish and Frankenstein-ish to me.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.040
I don't know the end result.

01:52.040 --> 01:55.040
You know, it might be the greatest thing that's ever happened to humankind.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.140
I don't fucking know.

01:56.140 --> 01:57.640
I don't think it's a good idea.

01:57.640 --> 01:59.840
I don't like it, but I can't tell you the truth.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.040
You gotta figure it out yourself.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.840
That's a great idea, Elliot.

02:03.840 --> 02:06.540
I'd have never thought of that. Thanks a lot.

02:06.540 --> 02:11.740
So, where's your evidence that soy feminizes people?

02:11.740 --> 02:19.140
I would offer you to pick up a book called The Whole Soy Truth by Kayla Daniels.

02:19.140 --> 02:23.340
Uh, it's actually called The Whole Soy Story, Elliot, but let's not get hung up on that.

02:23.340 --> 02:28.340
This book is authored by professional nutritional iconoclast Dr. Kayla T. Daniel,

02:28.340 --> 02:32.540
the naughty nutritionist telling the truth that's too hot to handle.

02:32.540 --> 02:36.040
I believe that's code for my work isn't peer-reviewed.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.540
She used to call herself the naughty survivalist,

02:38.540 --> 02:41.240
but she eventually changed her name and wardrobe

02:41.240 --> 02:44.540
after realizing her target audience were having trouble finding her

02:44.540 --> 02:49.740
in that camo jacket amongst all the dense foliage in her beige living room.

02:49.740 --> 02:53.040
She outlined some of her main claims about soy in her video entitled

02:53.040 --> 02:56.640
Moobs, Man Boobs, and Other Environmental Estrogens.

02:56.640 --> 03:00.840
All of those soybeans contain phytoestrogens.

03:00.840 --> 03:07.840
That's plant estrogens, and they are a form of estrogenizing influence on the body.

03:07.840 --> 03:11.740
They create hormonal havoc. They create endocrine disruption.

03:11.740 --> 03:15.440
Soy contains phytoestrogens, which are obviously feminizing,

03:15.440 --> 03:17.440
because they're the plant version of estrogen,

03:17.440 --> 03:20.340
resulting in lowered testosterone along with stuff like man boobs

03:20.340 --> 03:24.040
or being turned into a weak-willed feminist who definitely doesn't even lift.

03:24.040 --> 03:27.840
Now, Dr. Daniels' description doesn't list any sources for this,

03:27.840 --> 03:30.240
and the rational skeptic thing to do in this context

03:30.240 --> 03:33.240
would obviously be to just assume that means there aren't any without checking.

03:33.640 --> 03:37.640
So, alas, it seems that I'm not a true skeptic yet.

03:37.640 --> 03:41.340
I'm just a mere mortal, because I went and checked anyway,

03:41.340 --> 03:43.940
and I did find some studies,

03:43.940 --> 03:46.140
but...

03:46.140 --> 03:50.240
how do I put this in a way that makes it not sound rude?

03:50.240 --> 03:53.840
The studies didn't say anything like what this...

03:53.840 --> 03:57.640
lying liar lied about.

03:57.640 --> 04:00.440
For example, while trying to find studies on the effects of soy intake

04:00.440 --> 04:02.340
on estrogen and testosterone levels,

04:02.340 --> 04:07.440
I found a paper which assessed all English-language studies there had been as of 2008

04:07.440 --> 04:10.540
in which men consumed soy and their testosterone was tested,

04:10.540 --> 04:12.740
which, at the time, was 32.

04:12.740 --> 04:14.040
Check out the link in the description.

04:14.040 --> 04:18.840
The paper pretty definitively suggests that soy foods, and the phytoestrogens in them thereof,

04:18.840 --> 04:21.940
do not alter the testosterone concentration in men.

04:21.940 --> 04:24.340
Bear in mind, this wasn't just one study.

04:24.340 --> 04:29.740
This was a meta-analysis of the results of all 32 other studies there had been at the time.

04:29.840 --> 04:35.940
Now, does that mean we can therefore conclude that soy has no effect on testosterone levels?

04:35.940 --> 04:37.440
Not quite.

04:37.440 --> 04:42.040
You see, in science, it's rarely productive to be that conclusive about something.

04:42.040 --> 04:47.340
Instead, we'll say that the evidence quite reliably suggests that that's the case.

04:47.340 --> 04:52.340
But what about soy's effects on other things that men like to worry about a lot, like, uh, sperm count?

04:52.340 --> 04:54.340
Well, another paper from 2010,

04:54.340 --> 04:58.840
examining the nine clinical studies into the effects of isoflavone exposure on estrogen levels,

04:58.840 --> 05:03.340
found no evidence that it affects those levels at all, which suggests there's no link.

05:03.340 --> 05:05.340
Now, at this point in my research, I was wondering,

05:05.340 --> 05:08.040
why are phytoestrogens even called estrogens,

05:08.040 --> 05:12.240
when taking them doesn't seem to affect the levels of estrogen or testosterone in your blood?

05:12.240 --> 05:16.740
Well, it's because, in terms of chemical structure, they're very similar.

05:16.740 --> 05:18.640
Here's a handy picture I found on Wikipedia,

05:18.640 --> 05:23.740
comparing the makeup of isoflavones and coumastans to estradiol, the major estrogen hormone.

05:23.740 --> 05:28.440
Their construction is very similar, but the actual chemical components are very different.

05:28.440 --> 05:31.240
This means they do bind with estrogen receptors,

05:31.240 --> 05:34.940
but the effects are very different because, to put it scientifically,

05:34.940 --> 05:36.640
they're made of different stuff.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.640
This means that they don't really have comparable effects.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.240
But who cares about that?

05:41.240 --> 05:44.640
Kayla Daniel is fighting back with rigorously researched, uh...

05:45.640 --> 05:47.240
...anecdotes.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.240
Like this one!

05:50.040 --> 05:53.140
Scientists first linked phytoestrogens with lowered sperm count

05:53.140 --> 05:58.040
and other reproductive problems in the 1940s, when they diagnosed clover disease in sheep.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.440
...

06:01.440 --> 06:03.440
...

06:03.440 --> 06:05.440
...

06:07.840 --> 06:12.240
Dr. Daniel is so strapped for actual compelling evidence

06:12.240 --> 06:18.840
that she's down to studies from the 40s looking at the effects of a different plant on sheep.

06:18.840 --> 06:22.140
Now, I never really paid that much attention in biology class.

06:22.140 --> 06:24.240
I'm really sorry, Mrs. Baldwin.

06:24.240 --> 06:30.440
But I'm pretty sure I distantly remember that humans are monogastric mammals,

06:30.440 --> 06:34.440
which means that we have one stomach that digests everything we eat.

06:34.440 --> 06:39.640
Whereas some animals, for example sheep, are ruminants,

06:39.640 --> 06:43.840
which means they have a four-chambered stomach that digests things multiple times,

06:43.840 --> 06:47.840
and they also regurgitate food so that they can chew it again and swallow it again.

06:47.840 --> 06:51.640
It's a little bit disgusting, but that's just how some animals digest things.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.840
This is why sheep can eat grass, but humans can't.

06:54.840 --> 06:58.040
Well, you- you can. No one's stopping you. There's no laws.

06:58.040 --> 07:03.640
Ah! Just try and stop me, Brussels! Ah!

07:03.640 --> 07:05.440
...

07:05.440 --> 07:11.040
Grass contains silica, which can seriously mess up your teeth, like, permanently.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.840
Do not even do this for a joke.

07:12.840 --> 07:18.640
So, given the quite large dietary, digestive, and metabolic differences between humans and sheep,

07:18.640 --> 07:25.240
I think it's fair to say that maybe a study about how male sheep digested red clover

07:25.240 --> 07:30.840
and the effect that had on them might not be fully relevant to the effects of soy isoflavones on humans.

07:30.840 --> 07:35.840
So, to sum up, some plants make a hormone that looks like estrogen in composition,

07:35.840 --> 07:39.240
but doesn't have the same effects because it's actually a very different chemical.

07:39.240 --> 07:44.440
However, some people who don't know that and can't be bothered to check saw the word estrogen

07:44.440 --> 07:48.240
and leapt to conclusions that it must be feminizing the same way estrogen is.

07:48.240 --> 07:53.440
The way science classifies and names chemicals has effectively tricked a bunch of people

07:53.440 --> 07:57.240
who don't know better into making wild assumptions when the data shows otherwise,

07:57.240 --> 07:59.440
which sucks, but you've got to name things somehow.

07:59.440 --> 08:02.840
You know, it's important that you have a standardized system of classification,

08:02.840 --> 08:07.240
and the one they picked happens to cause massive problems for bodybuilders.

08:07.240 --> 08:10.840
I bet Johnny Science Namer didn't see that coming.

08:10.840 --> 08:14.240
My apologies to the descendants of Antoine Lavoisier.

08:14.240 --> 08:19.840
I'm reminded almost immediately of the equally faux-scientific alpha-beta beliefs

08:19.840 --> 08:22.440
popular among the manosphere, pickup artists, and others,

08:22.440 --> 08:27.640
originally based on a study of wolves that was later found through future research by its own author

08:27.640 --> 08:30.040
to not even be accurate to wolves.

08:30.040 --> 08:34.840
These same kinds of folks have happily combined these two half-baked concepts,

08:34.840 --> 08:40.440
hence the use of terms like low-T-beta and the insistence that soy must have something to do with it

08:40.440 --> 08:42.440
because that's what they all eat, apparently.

08:42.440 --> 08:45.440
And I think I saw a word with estrogen in it somewhere.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.640
I rest my case on the edge of a cliff.

08:48.640 --> 08:51.640
Oh, no, the case has fallen off!

08:51.640 --> 08:53.440
Oh, no, it's on fire!

08:53.440 --> 08:58.640
Soy and its supposed effects was eventually picked up by the closest thing the far right has to journalism,

08:58.640 --> 09:01.240
rebel media, and then later InfoWars.

09:01.240 --> 09:05.640
Incidentally, InfoWars sells diet supplements containing soy on their website.

09:05.640 --> 09:08.640
Probably should have checked the label there, shouldn't you, Paul?

09:08.640 --> 09:09.840
I take brain force.

09:09.840 --> 09:16.440
Which brings us to InfoWars editor, soy hater, and soy salesman, Paul Joseph Watson's video on the topic,

09:16.440 --> 09:20.440
which we're going to look at in more detail now because I think it'll be quite useful to do so.

09:20.440 --> 09:21.440
And also funny!

09:21.440 --> 09:24.640
The video begins with a spiel about the BuzzFeed Try Guys.

09:24.640 --> 09:28.440
You've probably seen the BuzzFeed Try Guys video where they measure their testosterone

09:28.440 --> 09:31.640
and it's literally half or less the normal level for a man.

09:31.640 --> 09:37.840
Their testosterone is so low, it's below the average for an 85 to 100-year-old man.

09:37.840 --> 09:44.440
This claim, and in fact this exact table, has appeared all over the rogues' gallery of right-wing and manosphere websites.

09:44.440 --> 09:51.840
InfoWars has it, of course, but there's also Return of Kings, Daily Wire, alt-right.com, Reddit, Return of Kings again?

09:51.840 --> 09:54.640
So it's like a game! You guys are writing the same thing!

09:54.640 --> 09:58.840
Gosh, they're really proud of this one, and its founder, Roosh V's internet forum.

09:58.840 --> 10:04.840
These articles and Paul's video are full of speculation that this testosterone level is completely unhealthy and terrible and bad for you.

10:04.840 --> 10:07.440
But...is it?

10:07.440 --> 10:11.040
I'm not really sure I see the validity in looking at one number and saying,

10:11.040 --> 10:16.840
Aha! These guys are dangerously unhealthy because of a graph I googled of averages.

10:16.840 --> 10:19.640
Human biology is rarely so simple.

10:19.640 --> 10:25.040
Trying to stick as close as you can to a number you found on the net can be incredibly damaging.

10:25.040 --> 10:30.040
In 2010, on a forum for discussing supplements, a guy had a test and found he had a level of 212.

10:30.240 --> 10:32.840
Again, the exact same level as Ned, supposedly.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.440
But then, half a month later, it went up to 364,

10:36.440 --> 10:41.440
suggesting these numbers are a temporary fluctuation that's fairly normal in a 25-year-old male.

10:41.440 --> 10:47.640
Despite this, anonymous people on the internet started telling him he had the testosterone of a 70-year-old,

10:47.640 --> 10:51.240
and others recommending a dosing cycle of steroids.

10:51.240 --> 10:56.240
All of this because of a cargo cult approach to a number on a graph.

10:56.240 --> 11:01.440
This is illustrative of some quite deep hang-ups and anxieties in male-centric circles

11:01.440 --> 11:06.040
towards a single hormone of many that they've been told constitutes manliness.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.640
This isn't just a silly belief that some people are wrong about.

11:08.640 --> 11:11.040
This is an actively damaging approach.

11:11.040 --> 11:15.240
I sincerely hope that this guy didn't start taking steroids

11:15.240 --> 11:21.640
because his hormone levels briefly, on one test, fluctuated below a level that he found on Google.

11:21.640 --> 11:25.240
Personal anecdote, when I was 21, I was really worried about this sort of thing.

11:25.240 --> 11:30.440
I went in for a blood test, and the doctor told me that I had above-average testosterone for someone my age,

11:30.440 --> 11:32.040
which was really, really cool.

11:32.040 --> 11:36.240
But then the doctor said, you know, a lot of people your age come in worrying about this stuff,

11:36.240 --> 11:38.240
and it's really quite silly.

11:38.240 --> 11:41.040
If you're healthy, and you're not experiencing any major problems,

11:41.040 --> 11:44.440
and your blood panel comes up fine for no other major disorders,

11:44.440 --> 11:48.640
then chances are whatever testosterone level you have is fine for you,

11:48.640 --> 11:53.640
and actively chasing a number that you found on the internet can be really, really damaging.

11:53.640 --> 11:57.440
If you take steroids, it can mess up your body's internal hormone production,

11:57.440 --> 12:01.040
and actually reduce the level of testosterone that your body makes.

12:01.040 --> 12:06.440
And, really, all you're doing is enriching the supplement industry.

12:06.440 --> 12:10.640
Just out of interest right now, let's take a show of hands as to which is more likely to be true.

12:10.640 --> 12:14.240
That all four of these guys has an unhealthily low testosterone level,

12:14.240 --> 12:16.640
even for someone several times their age,

12:16.640 --> 12:20.040
and the literal doctor who they visit regularly for videos like this,

12:20.040 --> 12:25.040
Dr. Jesse Mills, a urologist specializing in male reproductive medicine and surgery,

12:25.040 --> 12:27.840
and director of the men's clinic at UCLA,

12:27.840 --> 12:29.840
hasn't noticed anything from these tests,

12:29.840 --> 12:33.840
or let any of them know that they need to do something about their dangerously low testosterone,

12:33.840 --> 12:37.440
despite it literally being the thing that he specializes in,

12:37.440 --> 12:42.440
or that right-wing idiots on web forums who googled a number in five seconds

12:42.440 --> 12:46.040
don't know everything there is to know about the science of endocrinology.

12:46.040 --> 12:48.840
That's the study of hormones, by the way. What a lovely word.

12:48.840 --> 12:54.240
The meat, or should I say the plant protein, of Paul's video is situated entirely around the claim

12:54.240 --> 12:57.040
that soy is bad for you because it contains phytoestrogens.

12:57.040 --> 13:00.040
In other words, the thing we've already debunked in this video.

13:00.040 --> 13:03.240
But, for a laugh, let's look at how he does it specifically.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.240
Soybeans contain high amounts of phytoestrogens,

13:06.240 --> 13:11.040
organic compounds that mimic the female hormone estrogen in the human body.

13:11.040 --> 13:14.040
This reduces testosterone and lowers male sperm count.

13:14.440 --> 13:19.040
Paul here is word-for-word quoting an article in Scientific American.

13:19.040 --> 13:24.840
Well, actually, it's a very short post on the blog section of the Scientific American website,

13:24.840 --> 13:27.640
and by word-for-word, I mean...

13:27.640 --> 13:30.440
Soybeans contain high amounts of phytoestrogens,

13:30.440 --> 13:35.240
organic compounds that mimic the female hormone estrogen in the human body.

13:35.240 --> 13:38.440
This reduces testosterone and lowers male sperm count.

13:38.440 --> 13:41.040
This bit is, uh, how do I put this?

13:41.040 --> 13:43.840
Not there. Paul made that bit up.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.240
The article actually said,

13:46.240 --> 13:49.040
and in animal studies,

13:49.040 --> 13:51.640
has been shown to reduce testosterone levels.

13:51.640 --> 13:56.640
Here, we're seeing the right-wing reactionary's approach to scientific process drawn into close focus.

13:56.640 --> 14:01.240
When reading a piece of information he is quoting as a source of truth in his video

14:01.240 --> 14:04.040
and finding that it's just a little bit too nuanced,

14:04.040 --> 14:06.840
he alters and rewords it to suit his own agenda.

14:06.840 --> 14:09.840
I see here we're back at the Kayla Daniels School of Science

14:09.840 --> 14:13.040
where sheep and humans apparently have the same digestive system.

14:13.040 --> 14:15.440
I'm fairly certain that the blog post here

14:15.440 --> 14:18.440
is referring to the studies on sheep we mentioned earlier.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.240
I don't know for certain, though,

14:20.240 --> 14:22.440
because the blog doesn't cite a source for this claim

14:22.440 --> 14:24.640
because it's a rubbish one-paragraph blog

14:24.640 --> 14:28.240
that only an idiot would source as definitive proof of anything.

14:28.240 --> 14:29.240
You might be thinking,

14:29.240 --> 14:31.840
oh, but the word testosterone is highlighted.

14:31.840 --> 14:36.040
Maybe if I click it, it'll link to the study showing it.

14:36.040 --> 14:39.240
It doesn't. It links to another article about testosterone.

14:39.240 --> 14:42.840
In fact, it links to an article from after this one was written.

14:42.840 --> 14:47.640
Someone went back and added the link to explain what testosterone is...

14:47.640 --> 14:49.240
four years later?

14:49.240 --> 14:52.840
Who's in charge of the blog section of Scientific American?

14:52.840 --> 14:53.840
You might even think,

14:53.840 --> 14:57.840
oh, what about that link to the human reproduction PDF?

14:57.840 --> 14:59.240
Let's open that real quick.

14:59.240 --> 15:03.040
It appears to be an OxfordJournals.org press release

15:03.040 --> 15:05.440
about some kind of journal,

15:05.440 --> 15:08.240
but it's a blank PDF now.

15:08.240 --> 15:12.440
So, I mean, they're trying to cite sources, but...

15:12.440 --> 15:15.840
So, Paul's proof that phytoestrogen reduces testosterone is

15:15.840 --> 15:19.640
A, some tests on sheep from the 40s

15:19.640 --> 15:21.240
that he hasn't even read

15:21.240 --> 15:23.440
because the blog post he's using as a source

15:23.440 --> 15:25.040
doesn't even link to it,

15:25.040 --> 15:27.440
and B, being ignorant of the fact

15:27.440 --> 15:31.440
that there's been 32 studies of the effects of phytoestrogens on humans

15:31.440 --> 15:33.440
that found no connection whatsoever.

15:33.440 --> 15:36.040
Now, just as an aside, I think it's important to point out

15:36.040 --> 15:38.640
that animal studies aren't inherently useless.

15:38.640 --> 15:42.240
Animals can be good pointers for the effects of a substance on humans,

15:42.440 --> 15:44.640
and we can also perform tests on animals

15:44.640 --> 15:47.040
that it would be unethical to do on humans.

15:47.040 --> 15:50.040
However, when there are examples of human data,

15:50.040 --> 15:51.840
barring extenuating circumstances,

15:51.840 --> 15:54.040
the human data is probably more accurate.

15:54.040 --> 15:57.640
The 40s sheep study, or other studies on animals for that matter,

15:57.640 --> 15:59.440
should not be given as much consideration

15:59.440 --> 16:02.240
if they contradict the research we've done on humans.

16:02.240 --> 16:06.040
This article was published on July the 23rd, 2008,

16:06.040 --> 16:09.240
and we know, because I cleverly set this up by telling you earlier,

16:09.240 --> 16:11.840
that as of July the 1st, 2008,

16:11.840 --> 16:14.440
there were 32 studies into the effects of soy

16:14.440 --> 16:16.240
on human testosterone levels.

16:16.240 --> 16:18.040
This article brings up animal studies

16:18.040 --> 16:20.040
specifically because that's all they've got

16:20.040 --> 16:23.040
backing up their hypothesis that tofu lowers sperm count,

16:23.040 --> 16:25.040
apart from the study they're about to reference,

16:25.040 --> 16:28.240
which we're gonna get to in a second once we see how Paul sums it up.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.640
Men who eat half a serving of soy a day

16:30.640 --> 16:34.440
have 34 million fewer sperm per millimetre

16:34.440 --> 16:35.240
than those who don't.

16:35.240 --> 16:36.240
Wait, what was that?

16:36.240 --> 16:37.640
Sperm per millimetre.

16:37.640 --> 16:39.040
Sperm per millimetre.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.040
Millimetre.

16:40.040 --> 16:43.440
Okay, before we even get to the study,

16:43.440 --> 16:45.040
before we even get to the—

16:45.040 --> 16:46.840
The word is millilitre,

16:46.840 --> 16:49.440
millilitre is a measurement of liquid,

16:49.440 --> 16:52.840
and a millimetre is a measurement of length.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.840
I don't even know how you got this wrong.

16:54.840 --> 16:57.840
The word is literally in front of—

16:57.840 --> 17:00.640
Paul, you're a fucking journalist!

17:00.640 --> 17:03.040
It's such a simple thing to get right,

17:03.040 --> 17:04.240
and he can't even—

17:04.240 --> 17:06.840
Now, far be it from me to take Paul,

17:07.040 --> 17:10.640
or the one-paragraph blog post he cites entitled

17:10.640 --> 17:13.240
Soy Vey at their word,

17:13.240 --> 17:16.440
but I'm gonna go ahead and actually check the sources they cite.

17:16.440 --> 17:19.240
Check out the link in the description, sperm fans!

17:19.240 --> 17:21.640
The scientists got some men to provide a semen sample

17:21.640 --> 17:24.040
and answer a questionnaire about what foods they consumed,

17:24.040 --> 17:25.640
including foods that contained soy.

17:25.640 --> 17:27.640
They then sorted the samples into four groups,

17:27.640 --> 17:30.840
no soy intake and then varying tiers of soy intake,

17:30.840 --> 17:32.840
and looked to see if there was a correlation

17:32.840 --> 17:34.440
with the results of the sperm sample.

17:34.440 --> 17:36.240
The mean average sperm concentration

17:36.240 --> 17:38.640
in millions per milliliter was 106

17:38.640 --> 17:40.640
for the group with no soy food servings,

17:40.640 --> 17:42.240
while the average for the group that had

17:42.240 --> 17:45.040
over 0.3 servings per day was 72,

17:45.040 --> 17:48.640
which does kind of show a correlation, doesn't it?

17:48.640 --> 17:52.240
However, you might notice a couple of weird things here.

17:52.240 --> 17:55.040
Firstly, the group that has between 0.01

17:55.040 --> 17:59.040
and 0.07 servings per day had an average of 92,

17:59.040 --> 18:02.040
but the group with between 0.08 and 0.29,

18:02.040 --> 18:03.640
which is quite a bit more,

18:03.640 --> 18:06.440
had 104, more than the previous group,

18:06.440 --> 18:08.440
only slightly less than having none,

18:08.440 --> 18:10.840
and way more than having over 0.3.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.040
What's going on there?

18:12.040 --> 18:14.840
Something weird's going on with these men's sperm counts.

18:14.840 --> 18:17.640
On top of that, looking at the results section of the paper,

18:17.640 --> 18:20.240
the majority of men, 72%,

18:20.240 --> 18:22.640
were defined as overweight or obese,

18:22.640 --> 18:24.640
whether or not they ate any soy,

18:24.640 --> 18:28.440
and 10% had below 20 million sperm per milliliter,

18:28.440 --> 18:30.240
which is less than the low bar for sperm

18:30.240 --> 18:32.040
the World Health Organization used to,

18:32.040 --> 18:34.840
up until the late 90s, consider a healthy sperm count.

18:34.840 --> 18:35.840
Why is this?

18:35.840 --> 18:37.640
Well, here's the part where I pull the chair out

18:37.640 --> 18:38.440
from under you.

18:38.440 --> 18:40.640
It's because the men invited to the test

18:40.640 --> 18:43.440
were the male partners of subfertile couples,

18:43.440 --> 18:44.840
couples who, for one reason or another,

18:44.840 --> 18:46.640
have been trying to produce a child

18:46.640 --> 18:47.640
but haven't been able to,

18:47.640 --> 18:49.840
who had gone to the Massachusetts General Hospital

18:49.840 --> 18:50.840
for evaluation.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.440
All the men in the study,

18:52.440 --> 18:54.240
whether or not they consumed soy,

18:54.240 --> 18:57.040
had already been having troubles achieving pregnancy.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.640
That's how they found them.

18:58.840 --> 19:02.240
By the way, uh, the study's name

19:02.240 --> 19:05.240
mentions that it's men at an infertility clinic, right?

19:05.240 --> 19:08.440
And neither Paul's video nor the blog post he cites

19:08.440 --> 19:10.840
even mention that, and it's in its name!

19:10.840 --> 19:14.040
This is not a straightforward test of an average population.

19:14.040 --> 19:16.440
On top of that, how many men were actually tested

19:16.440 --> 19:17.640
in this study?

19:17.640 --> 19:21.440
4,000? 1,000? 500?

19:21.440 --> 19:24.240
Well, it was actually 99 men.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.640
That's really not big enough for a study

19:26.840 --> 19:29.840
That's really not big enough for the results of this study

19:29.840 --> 19:32.640
to be easily applicable to any human population.

19:32.640 --> 19:34.040
If you're going to count studies

19:34.040 --> 19:36.040
with a questionably low sample size,

19:36.040 --> 19:38.040
then you might as well look at the study

19:38.040 --> 19:40.040
by Song et al. in 2006,

19:40.040 --> 19:43.640
which studied only 48 men with a control group of 10

19:43.640 --> 19:45.640
and found that plant phytoestrogen intake

19:45.640 --> 19:48.040
was correlated with higher sperm count

19:48.040 --> 19:50.640
and higher sperm DNA integrity.

19:50.640 --> 19:53.840
But 48 men, or even 99 men,

19:53.840 --> 19:55.640
isn't really enough for the results

19:55.640 --> 19:57.840
of either to suggest much of anything.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.240
I hope it goes without saying

19:59.240 --> 20:01.040
that a study of 99 men

20:01.040 --> 20:03.840
who were already having fertility problems

20:03.840 --> 20:06.640
is not enough to come to a sweeping generalization

20:06.640 --> 20:08.840
about the effects of soy on sperm count

20:08.840 --> 20:10.640
or testosterone, for that matter.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.840
And in case it doesn't go without saying,

20:12.840 --> 20:15.640
the study concludes by saying it,

20:15.640 --> 20:17.640
and I quote...

20:18.640 --> 20:19.640
Uh...

20:19.640 --> 20:20.640
Uh...

20:20.640 --> 20:21.640
Uh...

20:21.640 --> 20:22.640
Uh...

20:22.640 --> 20:23.640
Uh...

20:23.640 --> 20:24.640
Uh...

20:24.640 --> 20:25.640
Uh...

20:25.640 --> 20:26.640
Uh...

20:26.640 --> 20:27.640
Uh...

20:27.640 --> 20:28.640
Uh...

20:28.640 --> 20:29.640
Uh...

20:29.640 --> 20:30.640
Okay.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.640
The clinical significance of these findings

20:32.640 --> 20:34.640
remains to be determined.

20:34.640 --> 20:38.240
Owing to the scarcity of human data in this area,

20:38.240 --> 20:41.640
it is very important that this issue is examined further.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.640
This is Paul's source!

20:44.840 --> 20:48.040
This is the thing he uses to prove the things he believes!

20:48.040 --> 20:49.640
And even it says,

20:49.640 --> 20:53.240
fucking don't come to a bullshit conclusion!

20:53.240 --> 20:55.240
We don't know enough about it!

20:56.640 --> 21:00.440
And yet, it seems like Paul's audience

21:00.440 --> 21:02.640
lapped this up anyway,

21:02.640 --> 21:04.640
like milk from the udders

21:04.640 --> 21:08.640
of the world's most disgusting kind of metaphorical cow,

21:08.640 --> 21:09.640
the...

21:09.640 --> 21:11.640
the lie cow!

21:11.640 --> 21:13.640
Here's another interesting thing I noticed.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.640
Despite his attempts to demonstrate

21:15.640 --> 21:18.640
that soy lowers testosterone and sperm count,

21:18.640 --> 21:20.640
the BuzzFeed Try Guys, incidentally,

21:20.640 --> 21:23.640
did a video where they have their sperm tested.

21:23.640 --> 21:26.640
All four Try Guys have a sperm concentration

21:26.640 --> 21:30.240
well over the normal count of 15 million sperm per milliliter

21:30.240 --> 21:32.240
established by the World Health Organization,

21:32.240 --> 21:34.240
with Keith having an, um...

21:34.240 --> 21:36.640
atrociously high count per milliliter

21:36.640 --> 21:40.240
despite having well below what Paul claims is normal testosterone,

21:40.240 --> 21:43.640
and Ned, who had the lowest testosterone by far,

21:43.640 --> 21:47.240
had a total sperm count of 248.6 million,

21:47.240 --> 21:50.240
over 10 million sperm more than Eugene,

21:50.240 --> 21:53.240
who had the highest testosterone of the group by far.

21:53.240 --> 21:54.640
This is anecdotal evidence,

21:54.640 --> 21:56.440
but that's really not much of a correlation

21:56.440 --> 21:58.440
between testosterone and sperm count, is it?

21:58.440 --> 22:00.640
Unless, of course, Paul means to tell me

22:00.640 --> 22:03.640
that Keith has well below the average testosterone levels

22:03.640 --> 22:06.240
of an 85- to 100-year-old man

22:06.240 --> 22:09.040
while...blasting sperm

22:09.040 --> 22:11.240
like he's Zeus from Mount Olympus.

22:11.240 --> 22:13.240
There's also a bit where he attempts to tie

22:13.240 --> 22:16.240
the increased production of soy in the West

22:16.240 --> 22:18.440
with the general reduction in testosterone

22:18.440 --> 22:19.640
around the same time.

22:19.640 --> 22:21.440
Obviously, it's not the only factor,

22:21.440 --> 22:22.440
but consider this.

22:22.440 --> 22:25.440
In 1992, soy food sales in the U.S.

22:25.440 --> 22:27.040
stood at $300 million a year.

22:27.040 --> 22:30.840
They now stand at over $4 billion a year.

22:30.840 --> 22:33.440
This has coincided with a substantial drop

22:33.440 --> 22:36.840
in men's testosterone levels in the U.S. since the 80s.

22:36.840 --> 22:38.440
Hey, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.040
I'll give you this. I'll give you this one for free.

22:40.040 --> 22:41.640
Google the word...

22:41.640 --> 22:42.640
coincidence?

22:42.640 --> 22:45.440
Seriously, this is the best he has to offer.

22:45.440 --> 22:47.240
The only other major things he cites

22:47.240 --> 22:49.240
are the guy I already showed you

22:49.240 --> 22:50.840
and the nutritionist whose book's name

22:50.840 --> 22:52.040
that guy got wrong.

22:52.040 --> 22:53.240
It's kind of ironic, isn't it,

22:53.240 --> 22:55.440
that Paul and his audience is blindly following

22:55.440 --> 22:56.840
Kayla Daniels on this,

22:56.840 --> 22:59.040
given that the main source for her claims

22:59.040 --> 23:03.040
is a story about a bunch of fucking sheep.

23:03.040 --> 23:05.240
He even, and this is really interesting,

23:05.240 --> 23:07.240
cites as proof that men get man boobs

23:07.240 --> 23:09.840
because of soy the same video I found

23:09.840 --> 23:11.640
while I was doing research into this.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.040
You know, the one that cites

23:13.040 --> 23:14.840
no credible evidence whatsoever.

23:14.840 --> 23:17.840
Weird that he'd make that his source for his claims.

23:17.840 --> 23:19.440
What's even weirder, though,

23:19.440 --> 23:21.440
is that since Paul's video came out,

23:21.440 --> 23:24.440
the description of the video has been edited to read,

23:24.440 --> 23:27.040
note, Paul Joseph Watson used an excerpt

23:27.040 --> 23:28.640
from this video in his popular video

23:28.640 --> 23:30.840
The Truth About Soy Boys illegally

23:30.840 --> 23:33.040
without the permission of Dr. Kayla Daniel.

23:33.040 --> 23:35.440
She finds his perspective offensive.

23:35.440 --> 23:38.240
This is Paul Joseph Watson's bulletproof source,

23:38.240 --> 23:41.040
a nutritionist with little to no scientific basis

23:41.040 --> 23:43.240
for their claims whose video Paul took

23:43.240 --> 23:45.040
without even bothering to ask

23:45.040 --> 23:47.640
to make his personal ridiculous right-wing view

23:47.640 --> 23:49.240
of the issue seem more credible,

23:49.240 --> 23:51.840
a view the person he's claiming as a source

23:51.840 --> 23:54.240
openly says she finds offensive.

23:54.240 --> 23:55.840
I hope Paul gets a fucking medal

23:55.840 --> 23:58.240
for how idiotic he's managed to be in this video.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.240
It's almost mind-boggling how backwards

24:00.240 --> 24:02.640
he's managed to get scientific reality.

24:02.840 --> 24:04.640
-...

24:04.640 --> 24:06.440
...

24:06.440 --> 24:07.840
...

24:07.840 --> 24:09.440
...

24:09.440 --> 24:10.640
...

24:10.640 --> 24:12.840
In conclusion, it may well be the case

24:12.840 --> 24:16.640
that soy is feminizing and makes you really unfit

24:16.640 --> 24:19.440
and isn't just caused by Paul's sedentary lifestyle

24:19.440 --> 24:21.040
or my love of Twizzlers,

24:21.040 --> 24:24.040
but if it is the case that soy makes you into a,

24:24.040 --> 24:27.840
you know, a no-testosterone, no-sperm baby man,

24:27.840 --> 24:30.640
then the time to believe that

24:30.640 --> 24:32.840
is when there is evidence.

24:32.840 --> 24:34.640
In the words of David Hume,

24:34.640 --> 24:36.440
and this makes me smarter because, you know,

24:36.440 --> 24:38.040
I can regurgitate a quote,

24:38.040 --> 24:43.040
the wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.

24:45.040 --> 24:47.440
Which brings me to the real question here.

24:47.440 --> 24:49.440
You know, it's not just some people are wrong

24:49.440 --> 24:52.040
about the science of isoflavones or whatever.

24:52.040 --> 24:53.840
The real question is,

24:53.840 --> 24:57.840
why do right-wing idiots keep sharing obvious lies

24:57.840 --> 25:01.640
in order to perpetuate the things they want to believe?

25:01.640 --> 25:04.040
Why isn't the truth enough?

25:04.040 --> 25:06.040
The book, When Prophecy Fails,

25:06.040 --> 25:08.040
relates the findings of social psychologists

25:08.040 --> 25:09.640
who studied a doomsday cult

25:09.640 --> 25:11.440
that believed the apocalypse was coming.

25:11.440 --> 25:13.640
When the date of the end of the world came and went,

25:13.640 --> 25:16.440
many of the cult remained committed to its beliefs anyway,

25:16.440 --> 25:18.640
decided that the world had simply been spared

25:18.640 --> 25:20.640
or the end had merely been delayed.

25:20.640 --> 25:23.040
The psychologists found that when a group of people

25:23.040 --> 25:24.840
is utterly committed to an idea,

25:24.840 --> 25:27.640
even if undeniable proof it is not true

25:27.640 --> 25:28.840
is presented to them,

25:28.840 --> 25:30.840
they can find a way to remain steadfast

25:30.840 --> 25:32.640
in their initial false beliefs.

25:32.640 --> 25:36.240
The term cognitive dissonance was invented by Leon Festinger,

25:36.240 --> 25:38.240
the book's main author and lead psychologist,

25:38.240 --> 25:39.440
a year later.

25:39.440 --> 25:41.440
The small, close-knit,

25:41.440 --> 25:44.440
definitely-not-cult-like corners of the Internet

25:44.440 --> 25:46.840
are sure they already know the truth

25:46.840 --> 25:48.440
about how the world works

25:48.440 --> 25:50.440
and appear to be hoping to piece together

25:50.440 --> 25:52.040
a justification for their beliefs

25:52.040 --> 25:53.840
by aggregating enough buzzwords

25:53.840 --> 25:55.640
that it somehow proves they're right.

25:55.640 --> 25:58.240
The only men who seriously watch BuzzFeed

25:58.240 --> 26:00.040
are tofu-eating, male-feminist,

26:00.040 --> 26:02.040
virtue-signaling, beta-orbiter

26:02.040 --> 26:03.040
SOYBOYS.

26:03.040 --> 26:05.040
They're virtue-signalers.

26:05.040 --> 26:06.840
They're cultural Marxists.

26:06.840 --> 26:08.240
They're betas.

26:08.240 --> 26:10.240
They must have low testosterone.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.440
They must be cucks.

26:11.440 --> 26:13.640
They must have had too much of a bean

26:13.640 --> 26:16.040
that's been a staple in the diet of Asian countries

26:16.040 --> 26:17.440
for thousands of years.

26:17.440 --> 26:20.040
I don't need to talk about evidence for my beliefs

26:20.040 --> 26:21.640
because everyone who isn't like me

26:21.640 --> 26:23.240
is all of these bad things,

26:23.240 --> 26:25.040
and that's why I'm right.

26:25.040 --> 26:26.440
It's important to recognize

26:26.440 --> 26:28.440
that this isn't an external claim.

26:28.440 --> 26:30.840
People don't wallpaper this all over their Facebook

26:30.840 --> 26:32.240
and Twitter feeds because they think

26:32.240 --> 26:34.640
it'll convince someone else to believe it.

26:34.640 --> 26:35.840
That's not the point.

26:35.840 --> 26:37.840
It's an internal claim.

26:37.840 --> 26:40.840
They're repeatedly talking to themselves

26:40.840 --> 26:43.040
because they want to believe it.

26:43.040 --> 26:46.040
It's a mental diversion from the actual truth,

26:46.040 --> 26:48.640
which is that other people have different ideas than them

26:48.640 --> 26:50.440
because the evidence sometimes suggests

26:50.440 --> 26:51.840
their beliefs are wrong.

26:51.840 --> 26:53.640
Without spreading ideas like that

26:53.640 --> 26:55.640
Tsui causes leftism,

26:55.640 --> 26:57.240
these folks would have to come to terms

26:57.240 --> 26:59.240
with the possibility that people might have

26:59.240 --> 27:01.640
good reasons to think differently from them,

27:01.640 --> 27:03.840
and admitting that would be too much.

27:03.840 --> 27:06.240
That would mean maybe they're not correct.

27:06.240 --> 27:08.840
Maybe their understanding of the world is incomplete.

27:08.840 --> 27:11.040
It can be scary to truly consider

27:11.040 --> 27:13.440
you might not know something and can be wrong.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.840
This explains the prevalence of people like Paul

27:15.840 --> 27:18.840
who help distract people from their fears of being wrong

27:18.840 --> 27:20.840
by acting as figures of authority

27:20.840 --> 27:22.040
who can tell them no.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.240
Trust me.

27:23.240 --> 27:25.040
I know what I'm talking about,

27:25.040 --> 27:26.440
and you're right already.

27:26.440 --> 27:28.840
You don't need to do any more thinking.

27:28.840 --> 27:30.640
Everyone who's different from you

27:30.640 --> 27:33.040
is a gender communist.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.840
If you happen to be a fan of Paul

27:34.840 --> 27:36.840
who managed to stick around to the end,

27:36.840 --> 27:38.840
thanks for hearing me out all the way.

27:38.840 --> 27:41.040
There's already undoubtedly tons of comments

27:41.040 --> 27:42.240
about stopping partway through

27:42.240 --> 27:44.440
because they can't stand the sound of my voice

27:44.440 --> 27:47.440
or because I'm clearly a leftist shill Tsui boy.

27:47.440 --> 27:49.640
You've outsmarted all of those people

27:49.640 --> 27:52.440
by actually listening to what someone else has to say

27:52.440 --> 27:55.040
and really having to think about the evidence.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.640
It might be comfortable

27:56.640 --> 27:59.440
having a YouTuber affirming your ideas,

27:59.440 --> 28:01.240
but the truth can't hurt you.

28:01.240 --> 28:03.240
In fact, it can set you free.

28:03.240 --> 28:05.240
Having a greater understanding of the world

28:05.240 --> 28:06.840
can only ever be a good thing,

28:06.840 --> 28:09.240
and being able to change your conclusions

28:09.240 --> 28:10.640
when presented with new evidence

28:10.640 --> 28:12.240
is a far more important skill

28:12.240 --> 28:15.040
than happening to be right first time about something.

28:15.040 --> 28:16.840
I've been wrong about plenty of things.

28:16.840 --> 28:19.240
In one video, I claimed tigers were from Africa.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.240
They actually only live in India in the wild,

28:21.240 --> 28:23.440
and I foolishly half-remembered an anecdote

28:23.440 --> 28:25.440
that their common ancestor with lions and leopards

28:25.440 --> 28:26.640
originated in Africa.

28:26.640 --> 28:29.040
Everyone is wrong some of the time,

28:29.040 --> 28:30.640
and that's okay.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.840
There'll always be people like Paul

28:32.840 --> 28:36.240
who want you to believe they can do your thinking for you,

28:36.240 --> 28:38.640
but maybe they're not right about that either.

28:38.640 --> 28:40.440
You don't have to think I'm right. I could be wrong.

28:40.440 --> 28:42.240
I could have come to the complete wrong conclusion

28:42.240 --> 28:44.040
about what this evidence suggests,

28:44.040 --> 28:45.640
but you can find it.

28:45.640 --> 28:46.840
It's out there, and you can—

28:46.840 --> 28:49.040
it informs your perspective of everything.

28:49.240 --> 28:52.440
You know, maybe some conservatives eat soy and that's fine.

28:52.440 --> 28:55.040
In fact, that is the case. I've looked it up.

28:55.040 --> 29:01.440
And, you know, isn't it all nice?

29:01.440 --> 29:05.640
Go to the evidence, and maybe together,

29:05.640 --> 29:08.440
we can all live in a beautiful world, soy or not,

29:08.440 --> 29:14.440
and maybe we'll be gentler and nicer that way.

29:14.440 --> 29:19.840
And if you don't, well, I'll own you on the internet.

29:19.840 --> 29:22.640
Thanks for watching my really dumb rant in the woods.

29:22.640 --> 29:25.240
Here's some footage of me getting sausages thrown in my face.

29:44.440 --> 29:51.640
Okay, so it turns out that soy sausages are really hard to hit people with from a distance.

30:14.440 --> 30:19.640
Thanks for watching my really dumb rant in the woods.

30:19.640 --> 30:23.640
Here's some footage of me getting sausages thrown in my face.

30:23.640 --> 30:30.240
Okay, so it turns out that soy sausages are really hard to hit people with from a distance.

30:30.240 --> 30:36.240
Thanks for watching my really dumb rant in the woods.

30:36.240 --> 30:41.840
Here's some footage of me getting sausages thrown in my face.

30:41.840 --> 30:57.040
Thanks for watching my really dumb rant in the woods.
