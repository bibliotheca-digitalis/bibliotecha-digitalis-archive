1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,920
Hey there. You might have noticed that I like to keep track of all the latest bizarre insults that internet weirdos like to come up with.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:13,040
You know, cultural Marxist, baiter, cuck, virtue-signaler, all the greats.

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,480
One of the latest additions to that list is the term Soy Boy,

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:23,240
which is used to decry everyone who's not like them as degenerate, feminized, weak losers

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,920
who are also, for some reason, also leftists because of soy.

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,440
So come...

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,060
And for once, I hesitate to admit they've scored a slam dunk.

8
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,400
They're onto us.

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,440
They know that beans are the reason why leftists think what they believe.

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,420
It can't be because of all the evidence.

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,020
No. They've got us.

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,620
And you can't prove otherwise, because that's just the objective truth.

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,540
At least that's they think.

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,040
Here's a comment from one of my latest videos.

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,540
Go get your chocolates and wine, and cry in the bathtub, you silly cucks.

16
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,840
High soy diets spike estrogen and lower testosterone.

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,040
That's not a disputable fact.

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,240
So! Let's dispute the facts!

19
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,840
The theory that soy is bad for you stems from a certain superstition in the bodybuilding community.

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,140
Here's the YouTube channel of Elliot Hulse, a professional bodybuilder with 1.7 million subscribers.

21
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,840
Your entire body is your brain.

22
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,640
Well, this guy knows what he's talking about.

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,440
I wonder what he thinks about soy.

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,040
Soy protein makes you weak and womanly.

25
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,140
Almost every bit of soy in the United States, or in the West,

26
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,240
you know, is going to be genetically modified.

27
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,440
Now, I'm not saying pro or con for genetically modified foods, but it's fucking weird.

28
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,440
It just, it sounds like freakish and Frankenstein-ish to me.

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,040
I don't know the end result.

30
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,040
You know, it might be the greatest thing that's ever happened to humankind.

31
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,140
I don't fucking know.

32
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,640
I don't think it's a good idea.

33
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,840
I don't like it, but I can't tell you the truth.

34
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,040
You gotta figure it out yourself.

35
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,840
That's a great idea, Elliot.

36
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,540
I'd have never thought of that. Thanks a lot.

37
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,740
So, where's your evidence that soy feminizes people?

38
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:19,140
I would offer you to pick up a book called The Whole Soy Truth by Kayla Daniels.

39
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,340
Uh, it's actually called The Whole Soy Story, Elliot, but let's not get hung up on that.

40
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,340
This book is authored by professional nutritional iconoclast Dr. Kayla T. Daniel,

41
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,540
the naughty nutritionist telling the truth that's too hot to handle.

42
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,040
I believe that's code for my work isn't peer-reviewed.

43
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,540
She used to call herself the naughty survivalist,

44
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,240
but she eventually changed her name and wardrobe

45
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,540
after realizing her target audience were having trouble finding her

46
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,740
in that camo jacket amongst all the dense foliage in her beige living room.

47
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,040
She outlined some of her main claims about soy in her video entitled

48
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,640
Moobs, Man Boobs, and Other Environmental Estrogens.

49
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,840
All of those soybeans contain phytoestrogens.

50
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,840
That's plant estrogens, and they are a form of estrogenizing influence on the body.

51
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,740
They create hormonal havoc. They create endocrine disruption.

52
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,440
Soy contains phytoestrogens, which are obviously feminizing,

53
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,440
because they're the plant version of estrogen,

54
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,340
resulting in lowered testosterone along with stuff like man boobs

55
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,040
or being turned into a weak-willed feminist who definitely doesn't even lift.

56
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,840
Now, Dr. Daniels' description doesn't list any sources for this,

57
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,240
and the rational skeptic thing to do in this context

58
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,240
would obviously be to just assume that means there aren't any without checking.

59
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,640
So, alas, it seems that I'm not a true skeptic yet.

60
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,340
I'm just a mere mortal, because I went and checked anyway,

61
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,940
and I did find some studies,

62
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,140
but...

63
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,240
how do I put this in a way that makes it not sound rude?

64
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,840
The studies didn't say anything like what this...

65
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,640
lying liar lied about.

66
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,440
For example, while trying to find studies on the effects of soy intake

67
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,340
on estrogen and testosterone levels,

68
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,440
I found a paper which assessed all English-language studies there had been as of 2008

69
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,540
in which men consumed soy and their testosterone was tested,

70
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,740
which, at the time, was 32.

71
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,040
Check out the link in the description.

72
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,840
The paper pretty definitively suggests that soy foods, and the phytoestrogens in them thereof,

73
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,940
do not alter the testosterone concentration in men.

74
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,340
Bear in mind, this wasn't just one study.

75
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,740
This was a meta-analysis of the results of all 32 other studies there had been at the time.

76
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,940
Now, does that mean we can therefore conclude that soy has no effect on testosterone levels?

77
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,440
Not quite.

78
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,040
You see, in science, it's rarely productive to be that conclusive about something.

79
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,340
Instead, we'll say that the evidence quite reliably suggests that that's the case.

80
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,340
But what about soy's effects on other things that men like to worry about a lot, like, uh, sperm count?

81
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,340
Well, another paper from 2010,

82
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,840
examining the nine clinical studies into the effects of isoflavone exposure on estrogen levels,

83
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,340
found no evidence that it affects those levels at all, which suggests there's no link.

84
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,340
Now, at this point in my research, I was wondering,

85
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,040
why are phytoestrogens even called estrogens,

86
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,240
when taking them doesn't seem to affect the levels of estrogen or testosterone in your blood?

87
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,740
Well, it's because, in terms of chemical structure, they're very similar.

88
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,640
Here's a handy picture I found on Wikipedia,

89
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,740
comparing the makeup of isoflavones and coumastans to estradiol, the major estrogen hormone.

90
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,440
Their construction is very similar, but the actual chemical components are very different.

91
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,240
This means they do bind with estrogen receptors,

92
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,940
but the effects are very different because, to put it scientifically,

93
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,640
they're made of different stuff.

94
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,640
This means that they don't really have comparable effects.

95
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,240
But who cares about that?

96
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,640
Kayla Daniel is fighting back with rigorously researched, uh...

97
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,240
...anecdotes.

98
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
Like this one!

99
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,140
Scientists first linked phytoestrogens with lowered sperm count

100
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:58,040
and other reproductive problems in the 1940s, when they diagnosed clover disease in sheep.

101
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,440
...

102
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,440
...

103
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,440
...

104
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,240
Dr. Daniel is so strapped for actual compelling evidence

105
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,840
that she's down to studies from the 40s looking at the effects of a different plant on sheep.

106
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,140
Now, I never really paid that much attention in biology class.

107
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,240
I'm really sorry, Mrs. Baldwin.

108
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,440
But I'm pretty sure I distantly remember that humans are monogastric mammals,

109
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,440
which means that we have one stomach that digests everything we eat.

110
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,640
Whereas some animals, for example sheep, are ruminants,

111
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,840
which means they have a four-chambered stomach that digests things multiple times,

112
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,840
and they also regurgitate food so that they can chew it again and swallow it again.

113
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,640
It's a little bit disgusting, but that's just how some animals digest things.

114
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,840
This is why sheep can eat grass, but humans can't.

115
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,040
Well, you- you can. No one's stopping you. There's no laws.

116
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:03,640
Ah! Just try and stop me, Brussels! Ah!

117
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,440
...

118
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,040
Grass contains silica, which can seriously mess up your teeth, like, permanently.

119
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,840
Do not even do this for a joke.

120
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,640
So, given the quite large dietary, digestive, and metabolic differences between humans and sheep,

121
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:25,240
I think it's fair to say that maybe a study about how male sheep digested red clover

122
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,840
and the effect that had on them might not be fully relevant to the effects of soy isoflavones on humans.

123
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,840
So, to sum up, some plants make a hormone that looks like estrogen in composition,

124
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,240
but doesn't have the same effects because it's actually a very different chemical.

125
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,440
However, some people who don't know that and can't be bothered to check saw the word estrogen

126
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,240
and leapt to conclusions that it must be feminizing the same way estrogen is.

127
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,440
The way science classifies and names chemicals has effectively tricked a bunch of people

128
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,240
who don't know better into making wild assumptions when the data shows otherwise,

129
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,440
which sucks, but you've got to name things somehow.

130
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,840
You know, it's important that you have a standardized system of classification,

131
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,240
and the one they picked happens to cause massive problems for bodybuilders.

132
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,840
I bet Johnny Science Namer didn't see that coming.

133
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,240
My apologies to the descendants of Antoine Lavoisier.

134
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,840
I'm reminded almost immediately of the equally faux-scientific alpha-beta beliefs

135
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,440
popular among the manosphere, pickup artists, and others,

136
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,640
originally based on a study of wolves that was later found through future research by its own author

137
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,040
to not even be accurate to wolves.

138
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,840
These same kinds of folks have happily combined these two half-baked concepts,

139
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:40,440
hence the use of terms like low-T-beta and the insistence that soy must have something to do with it

140
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,440
because that's what they all eat, apparently.

141
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,440
And I think I saw a word with estrogen in it somewhere.

142
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,640
I rest my case on the edge of a cliff.

143
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,640
Oh, no, the case has fallen off!

144
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,440
Oh, no, it's on fire!

145
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,640
Soy and its supposed effects was eventually picked up by the closest thing the far right has to journalism,

146
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,240
rebel media, and then later InfoWars.

147
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,640
Incidentally, InfoWars sells diet supplements containing soy on their website.

148
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,640
Probably should have checked the label there, shouldn't you, Paul?

149
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,840
I take brain force.

150
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:16,440
Which brings us to InfoWars editor, soy hater, and soy salesman, Paul Joseph Watson's video on the topic,

151
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,440
which we're going to look at in more detail now because I think it'll be quite useful to do so.

152
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,440
And also funny!

153
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,640
The video begins with a spiel about the BuzzFeed Try Guys.

154
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,440
You've probably seen the BuzzFeed Try Guys video where they measure their testosterone

155
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,640
and it's literally half or less the normal level for a man.

156
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,840
Their testosterone is so low, it's below the average for an 85 to 100-year-old man.

157
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:44,440
This claim, and in fact this exact table, has appeared all over the rogues' gallery of right-wing and manosphere websites.

158
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:51,840
InfoWars has it, of course, but there's also Return of Kings, Daily Wire, alt-right.com, Reddit, Return of Kings again?

159
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,640
So it's like a game! You guys are writing the same thing!

160
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,840
Gosh, they're really proud of this one, and its founder, Roosh V's internet forum.

161
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:04,840
These articles and Paul's video are full of speculation that this testosterone level is completely unhealthy and terrible and bad for you.

162
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,440
But...is it?

163
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,040
I'm not really sure I see the validity in looking at one number and saying,

164
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,840
Aha! These guys are dangerously unhealthy because of a graph I googled of averages.

165
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,640
Human biology is rarely so simple.

166
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:25,040
Trying to stick as close as you can to a number you found on the net can be incredibly damaging.

167
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,040
In 2010, on a forum for discussing supplements, a guy had a test and found he had a level of 212.

168
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,840
Again, the exact same level as Ned, supposedly.

169
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,440
But then, half a month later, it went up to 364,

170
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,440
suggesting these numbers are a temporary fluctuation that's fairly normal in a 25-year-old male.

171
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,640
Despite this, anonymous people on the internet started telling him he had the testosterone of a 70-year-old,

172
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,240
and others recommending a dosing cycle of steroids.

173
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,240
All of this because of a cargo cult approach to a number on a graph.

174
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,440
This is illustrative of some quite deep hang-ups and anxieties in male-centric circles

175
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,040
towards a single hormone of many that they've been told constitutes manliness.

176
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,640
This isn't just a silly belief that some people are wrong about.

177
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,040
This is an actively damaging approach.

178
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,240
I sincerely hope that this guy didn't start taking steroids

179
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:21,640
because his hormone levels briefly, on one test, fluctuated below a level that he found on Google.

180
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,240
Personal anecdote, when I was 21, I was really worried about this sort of thing.

181
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,440
I went in for a blood test, and the doctor told me that I had above-average testosterone for someone my age,

182
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,040
which was really, really cool.

183
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,240
But then the doctor said, you know, a lot of people your age come in worrying about this stuff,

184
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
and it's really quite silly.

185
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,040
If you're healthy, and you're not experiencing any major problems,

186
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,440
and your blood panel comes up fine for no other major disorders,

187
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,640
then chances are whatever testosterone level you have is fine for you,

188
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,640
and actively chasing a number that you found on the internet can be really, really damaging.

189
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,440
If you take steroids, it can mess up your body's internal hormone production,

190
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,040
and actually reduce the level of testosterone that your body makes.

191
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,440
And, really, all you're doing is enriching the supplement industry.

192
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,640
Just out of interest right now, let's take a show of hands as to which is more likely to be true.

193
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,240
That all four of these guys has an unhealthily low testosterone level,

194
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,640
even for someone several times their age,

195
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,040
and the literal doctor who they visit regularly for videos like this,

196
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,040
Dr. Jesse Mills, a urologist specializing in male reproductive medicine and surgery,

197
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,840
and director of the men's clinic at UCLA,

198
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,840
hasn't noticed anything from these tests,

199
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,840
or let any of them know that they need to do something about their dangerously low testosterone,

200
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,440
despite it literally being the thing that he specializes in,

201
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,440
or that right-wing idiots on web forums who googled a number in five seconds

202
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,040
don't know everything there is to know about the science of endocrinology.

203
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,840
That's the study of hormones, by the way. What a lovely word.

204
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:54,240
The meat, or should I say the plant protein, of Paul's video is situated entirely around the claim

205
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,040
that soy is bad for you because it contains phytoestrogens.

206
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,040
In other words, the thing we've already debunked in this video.

207
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,240
But, for a laugh, let's look at how he does it specifically.

208
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,240
Soybeans contain high amounts of phytoestrogens,

209
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,040
organic compounds that mimic the female hormone estrogen in the human body.

210
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,040
This reduces testosterone and lowers male sperm count.

211
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,040
Paul here is word-for-word quoting an article in Scientific American.

212
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,840
Well, actually, it's a very short post on the blog section of the Scientific American website,

213
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,640
and by word-for-word, I mean...

214
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,440
Soybeans contain high amounts of phytoestrogens,

215
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,240
organic compounds that mimic the female hormone estrogen in the human body.

216
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,440
This reduces testosterone and lowers male sperm count.

217
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,040
This bit is, uh, how do I put this?

218
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,840
Not there. Paul made that bit up.

219
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,240
The article actually said,

220
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,040
and in animal studies,

221
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,640
has been shown to reduce testosterone levels.

222
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,640
Here, we're seeing the right-wing reactionary's approach to scientific process drawn into close focus.

223
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,240
When reading a piece of information he is quoting as a source of truth in his video

224
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,040
and finding that it's just a little bit too nuanced,

225
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,840
he alters and rewords it to suit his own agenda.

226
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,840
I see here we're back at the Kayla Daniels School of Science

227
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,040
where sheep and humans apparently have the same digestive system.

228
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,440
I'm fairly certain that the blog post here

229
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,440
is referring to the studies on sheep we mentioned earlier.

230
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,240
I don't know for certain, though,

231
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,440
because the blog doesn't cite a source for this claim

232
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,640
because it's a rubbish one-paragraph blog

233
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,240
that only an idiot would source as definitive proof of anything.

234
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
You might be thinking,

235
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,840
oh, but the word testosterone is highlighted.

236
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,040
Maybe if I click it, it'll link to the study showing it.

237
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,240
It doesn't. It links to another article about testosterone.

238
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,840
In fact, it links to an article from after this one was written.

239
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,640
Someone went back and added the link to explain what testosterone is...

240
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,240
four years later?

241
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,840
Who's in charge of the blog section of Scientific American?

242
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,840
You might even think,

243
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,840
oh, what about that link to the human reproduction PDF?

244
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,240
Let's open that real quick.

245
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,040
It appears to be an OxfordJournals.org press release

246
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,440
about some kind of journal,

247
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,240
but it's a blank PDF now.

248
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,440
So, I mean, they're trying to cite sources, but...

249
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,840
So, Paul's proof that phytoestrogen reduces testosterone is

250
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,640
A, some tests on sheep from the 40s

251
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,240
that he hasn't even read

252
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,440
because the blog post he's using as a source

253
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,040
doesn't even link to it,

254
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,440
and B, being ignorant of the fact

255
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,440
that there's been 32 studies of the effects of phytoestrogens on humans

256
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,440
that found no connection whatsoever.

257
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,040
Now, just as an aside, I think it's important to point out

258
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,640
that animal studies aren't inherently useless.

259
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,240
Animals can be good pointers for the effects of a substance on humans,

260
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,640
and we can also perform tests on animals

261
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,040
that it would be unethical to do on humans.

262
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,040
However, when there are examples of human data,

263
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,840
barring extenuating circumstances,

264
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,040
the human data is probably more accurate.

265
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,640
The 40s sheep study, or other studies on animals for that matter,

266
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,440
should not be given as much consideration

267
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,240
if they contradict the research we've done on humans.

268
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,040
This article was published on July the 23rd, 2008,

269
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,240
and we know, because I cleverly set this up by telling you earlier,

270
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,840
that as of July the 1st, 2008,

271
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,440
there were 32 studies into the effects of soy

272
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,240
on human testosterone levels.

273
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,040
This article brings up animal studies

274
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,040
specifically because that's all they've got

275
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,040
backing up their hypothesis that tofu lowers sperm count,

276
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,040
apart from the study they're about to reference,

277
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,240
which we're gonna get to in a second once we see how Paul sums it up.

278
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,640
Men who eat half a serving of soy a day

279
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,440
have 34 million fewer sperm per millimetre

280
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,240
than those who don't.

281
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,240
Wait, what was that?

282
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,640
Sperm per millimetre.

283
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,040
Sperm per millimetre.

284
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,040
Millimetre.

285
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,440
Okay, before we even get to the study,

286
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,040
before we even get to the—

287
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,840
The word is millilitre,

288
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,440
millilitre is a measurement of liquid,

289
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,840
and a millimetre is a measurement of length.

290
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,840
I don't even know how you got this wrong.

291
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,840
The word is literally in front of—

292
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,640
Paul, you're a fucking journalist!

293
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,040
It's such a simple thing to get right,

294
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,240
and he can't even—

295
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,840
Now, far be it from me to take Paul,

296
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,640
or the one-paragraph blog post he cites entitled

297
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,240
Soy Vey at their word,

298
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,440
but I'm gonna go ahead and actually check the sources they cite.

299
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,240
Check out the link in the description, sperm fans!

300
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,640
The scientists got some men to provide a semen sample

301
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,040
and answer a questionnaire about what foods they consumed,

302
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,640
including foods that contained soy.

303
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,640
They then sorted the samples into four groups,

304
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,840
no soy intake and then varying tiers of soy intake,

305
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,840
and looked to see if there was a correlation

306
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,440
with the results of the sperm sample.

307
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,240
The mean average sperm concentration

308
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,640
in millions per milliliter was 106

309
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
for the group with no soy food servings,

310
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,240
while the average for the group that had

311
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,040
over 0.3 servings per day was 72,

312
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,640
which does kind of show a correlation, doesn't it?

313
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,240
However, you might notice a couple of weird things here.

314
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,040
Firstly, the group that has between 0.01

315
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,040
and 0.07 servings per day had an average of 92,

316
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,040
but the group with between 0.08 and 0.29,

317
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,640
which is quite a bit more,

318
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,440
had 104, more than the previous group,

319
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,440
only slightly less than having none,

320
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,840
and way more than having over 0.3.

321
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,040
What's going on there?

322
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,840
Something weird's going on with these men's sperm counts.

323
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,640
On top of that, looking at the results section of the paper,

324
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,240
the majority of men, 72%,

325
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,640
were defined as overweight or obese,

326
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,640
whether or not they ate any soy,

327
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,440
and 10% had below 20 million sperm per milliliter,

328
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,240
which is less than the low bar for sperm

329
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,040
the World Health Organization used to,

330
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,840
up until the late 90s, consider a healthy sperm count.

331
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,840
Why is this?

332
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,640
Well, here's the part where I pull the chair out

333
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,440
from under you.

334
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,640
It's because the men invited to the test

335
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,440
were the male partners of subfertile couples,

336
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,840
couples who, for one reason or another,

337
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,640
have been trying to produce a child

338
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,640
but haven't been able to,

339
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,840
who had gone to the Massachusetts General Hospital

340
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,840
for evaluation.

341
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,440
All the men in the study,

342
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,240
whether or not they consumed soy,

343
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,040
had already been having troubles achieving pregnancy.

344
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,640
That's how they found them.

345
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,240
By the way, uh, the study's name

346
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,240
mentions that it's men at an infertility clinic, right?

347
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,440
And neither Paul's video nor the blog post he cites

348
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,840
even mention that, and it's in its name!

349
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,040
This is not a straightforward test of an average population.

350
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,440
On top of that, how many men were actually tested

351
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,640
in this study?

352
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,440
4,000? 1,000? 500?

353
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,240
Well, it was actually 99 men.

354
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,640
That's really not big enough for a study

355
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,840
That's really not big enough for the results of this study

356
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,640
to be easily applicable to any human population.

357
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,040
If you're going to count studies

358
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,040
with a questionably low sample size,

359
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,040
then you might as well look at the study

360
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,040
by Song et al. in 2006,

361
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,640
which studied only 48 men with a control group of 10

362
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,640
and found that plant phytoestrogen intake

363
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,040
was correlated with higher sperm count

364
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,640
and higher sperm DNA integrity.

365
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,840
But 48 men, or even 99 men,

366
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,640
isn't really enough for the results

367
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,840
of either to suggest much of anything.

368
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,240
I hope it goes without saying

369
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,040
that a study of 99 men

370
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,840
who were already having fertility problems

371
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,640
is not enough to come to a sweeping generalization

372
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,840
about the effects of soy on sperm count

373
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,640
or testosterone, for that matter.

374
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,840
And in case it doesn't go without saying,

375
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,640
the study concludes by saying it,

376
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,640
and I quote...

377
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,640
Uh...

378
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,640
Uh...

379
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,640
Uh...

380
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,640
Uh...

381
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
Uh...

382
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,640
Uh...

383
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,640
Uh...

384
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,640
Uh...

385
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,640
Uh...

386
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,640
Uh...

387
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,640
Uh...

388
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,640
Okay.

389
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
The clinical significance of these findings

390
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,640
remains to be determined.

391
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,240
Owing to the scarcity of human data in this area,

392
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,640
it is very important that this issue is examined further.

393
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
This is Paul's source!

394
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,040
This is the thing he uses to prove the things he believes!

395
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,640
And even it says,

396
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,240
fucking don't come to a bullshit conclusion!

397
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,240
We don't know enough about it!

398
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,440
And yet, it seems like Paul's audience

399
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,640
lapped this up anyway,

400
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
like milk from the udders

401
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,640
of the world's most disgusting kind of metaphorical cow,

402
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,640
the...

403
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,640
the lie cow!

404
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,640
Here's another interesting thing I noticed.

405
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,640
Despite his attempts to demonstrate

406
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,640
that soy lowers testosterone and sperm count,

407
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,640
the BuzzFeed Try Guys, incidentally,

408
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,640
did a video where they have their sperm tested.

409
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,640
All four Try Guys have a sperm concentration

410
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,240
well over the normal count of 15 million sperm per milliliter

411
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,240
established by the World Health Organization,

412
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,240
with Keith having an, um...

413
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,640
atrociously high count per milliliter

414
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,240
despite having well below what Paul claims is normal testosterone,

415
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,640
and Ned, who had the lowest testosterone by far,

416
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,240
had a total sperm count of 248.6 million,

417
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,240
over 10 million sperm more than Eugene,

418
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,240
who had the highest testosterone of the group by far.

419
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,640
This is anecdotal evidence,

420
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,440
but that's really not much of a correlation

421
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,440
between testosterone and sperm count, is it?

422
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,640
Unless, of course, Paul means to tell me

423
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,640
that Keith has well below the average testosterone levels

424
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,240
of an 85- to 100-year-old man

425
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,040
while...blasting sperm

426
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,240
like he's Zeus from Mount Olympus.

427
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,240
There's also a bit where he attempts to tie

428
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,240
the increased production of soy in the West

429
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,440
with the general reduction in testosterone

430
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,640
around the same time.

431
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,440
Obviously, it's not the only factor,

432
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,440
but consider this.

433
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,440
In 1992, soy food sales in the U.S.

434
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,040
stood at $300 million a year.

435
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,840
They now stand at over $4 billion a year.

436
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,440
This has coincided with a substantial drop

437
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,840
in men's testosterone levels in the U.S. since the 80s.

438
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,440
Hey, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul.

439
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,040
I'll give you this. I'll give you this one for free.

440
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,640
Google the word...

441
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,640
coincidence?

442
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,440
Seriously, this is the best he has to offer.

443
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,240
The only other major things he cites

444
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,240
are the guy I already showed you

445
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,840
and the nutritionist whose book's name

446
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,040
that guy got wrong.

447
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,240
It's kind of ironic, isn't it,

448
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,440
that Paul and his audience is blindly following

449
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,840
Kayla Daniels on this,

450
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,040
given that the main source for her claims

451
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:03,040
is a story about a bunch of fucking sheep.

452
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,240
He even, and this is really interesting,

453
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,240
cites as proof that men get man boobs

454
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,840
because of soy the same video I found

455
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,640
while I was doing research into this.

456
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,040
You know, the one that cites

457
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,840
no credible evidence whatsoever.

458
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,840
Weird that he'd make that his source for his claims.

459
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,440
What's even weirder, though,

460
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
is that since Paul's video came out,

461
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,440
the description of the video has been edited to read,

462
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,040
note, Paul Joseph Watson used an excerpt

463
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,640
from this video in his popular video

464
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,840
The Truth About Soy Boys illegally

465
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,040
without the permission of Dr. Kayla Daniel.

466
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,440
She finds his perspective offensive.

467
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,240
This is Paul Joseph Watson's bulletproof source,

468
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,040
a nutritionist with little to no scientific basis

469
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,240
for their claims whose video Paul took

470
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,040
without even bothering to ask

471
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,640
to make his personal ridiculous right-wing view

472
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,240
of the issue seem more credible,

473
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,840
a view the person he's claiming as a source

474
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,240
openly says she finds offensive.

475
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,840
I hope Paul gets a fucking medal

476
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,240
for how idiotic he's managed to be in this video.

477
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,240
It's almost mind-boggling how backwards

478
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,640
he's managed to get scientific reality.

479
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,640
-...

480
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,440
...

481
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,840
...

482
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,440
...

483
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,640
...

484
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,840
In conclusion, it may well be the case

485
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,640
that soy is feminizing and makes you really unfit

486
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,440
and isn't just caused by Paul's sedentary lifestyle

487
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,040
or my love of Twizzlers,

488
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,040
but if it is the case that soy makes you into a,

489
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,840
you know, a no-testosterone, no-sperm baby man,

490
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,640
then the time to believe that

491
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,840
is when there is evidence.

492
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,640
In the words of David Hume,

493
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,440
and this makes me smarter because, you know,

494
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,040
I can regurgitate a quote,

495
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:43,040
the wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.

496
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,440
Which brings me to the real question here.

497
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,440
You know, it's not just some people are wrong

498
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,040
about the science of isoflavones or whatever.

499
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,840
The real question is,

500
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,840
why do right-wing idiots keep sharing obvious lies

501
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,640
in order to perpetuate the things they want to believe?

502
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,040
Why isn't the truth enough?

503
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,040
The book, When Prophecy Fails,

504
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,040
relates the findings of social psychologists

505
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,640
who studied a doomsday cult

506
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,440
that believed the apocalypse was coming.

507
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,640
When the date of the end of the world came and went,

508
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,440
many of the cult remained committed to its beliefs anyway,

509
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,640
decided that the world had simply been spared

510
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,640
or the end had merely been delayed.

511
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,040
The psychologists found that when a group of people

512
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,840
is utterly committed to an idea,

513
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,640
even if undeniable proof it is not true

514
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,840
is presented to them,

515
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,840
they can find a way to remain steadfast

516
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,640
in their initial false beliefs.

517
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,240
The term cognitive dissonance was invented by Leon Festinger,

518
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,240
the book's main author and lead psychologist,

519
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,440
a year later.

520
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,440
The small, close-knit,

521
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,440
definitely-not-cult-like corners of the Internet

522
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,840
are sure they already know the truth

523
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,440
about how the world works

524
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,440
and appear to be hoping to piece together

525
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,040
a justification for their beliefs

526
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,840
by aggregating enough buzzwords

527
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,640
that it somehow proves they're right.

528
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,240
The only men who seriously watch BuzzFeed

529
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,040
are tofu-eating, male-feminist,

530
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,040
virtue-signaling, beta-orbiter

531
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,040
SOYBOYS.

532
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,040
They're virtue-signalers.

533
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,840
They're cultural Marxists.

534
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,240
They're betas.

535
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,240
They must have low testosterone.

536
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,440
They must be cucks.

537
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,640
They must have had too much of a bean

538
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,040
that's been a staple in the diet of Asian countries

539
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,440
for thousands of years.

540
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,040
I don't need to talk about evidence for my beliefs

541
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,640
because everyone who isn't like me

542
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,240
is all of these bad things,

543
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,040
and that's why I'm right.

544
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,440
It's important to recognize

545
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,440
that this isn't an external claim.

546
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,840
People don't wallpaper this all over their Facebook

547
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,240
and Twitter feeds because they think

548
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,640
it'll convince someone else to believe it.

549
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,840
That's not the point.

550
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,840
It's an internal claim.

551
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,840
They're repeatedly talking to themselves

552
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,040
because they want to believe it.

553
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,040
It's a mental diversion from the actual truth,

554
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,640
which is that other people have different ideas than them

555
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,440
because the evidence sometimes suggests

556
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,840
their beliefs are wrong.

557
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,640
Without spreading ideas like that

558
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,640
Tsui causes leftism,

559
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,240
these folks would have to come to terms

560
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,240
with the possibility that people might have

561
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,640
good reasons to think differently from them,

562
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,840
and admitting that would be too much.

563
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,240
That would mean maybe they're not correct.

564
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,840
Maybe their understanding of the world is incomplete.

565
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,040
It can be scary to truly consider

566
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,440
you might not know something and can be wrong.

567
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,840
This explains the prevalence of people like Paul

568
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,840
who help distract people from their fears of being wrong

569
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,840
by acting as figures of authority

570
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,040
who can tell them no.

571
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,240
Trust me.

572
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,040
I know what I'm talking about,

573
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,440
and you're right already.

574
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,840
You don't need to do any more thinking.

575
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,640
Everyone who's different from you

576
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,040
is a gender communist.

577
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,840
If you happen to be a fan of Paul

578
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,840
who managed to stick around to the end,

579
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,840
thanks for hearing me out all the way.

580
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,040
There's already undoubtedly tons of comments

581
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,240
about stopping partway through

582
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,440
because they can't stand the sound of my voice

583
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,440
or because I'm clearly a leftist shill Tsui boy.

584
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,640
You've outsmarted all of those people

585
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,440
by actually listening to what someone else has to say

586
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,040
and really having to think about the evidence.

587
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,640
It might be comfortable

588
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,440
having a YouTuber affirming your ideas,

589
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,240
but the truth can't hurt you.

590
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,240
In fact, it can set you free.

591
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,240
Having a greater understanding of the world

592
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,840
can only ever be a good thing,

593
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,240
and being able to change your conclusions

594
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,640
when presented with new evidence

595
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,240
is a far more important skill

596
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,040
than happening to be right first time about something.

597
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,840
I've been wrong about plenty of things.

598
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,240
In one video, I claimed tigers were from Africa.

599
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,240
They actually only live in India in the wild,

600
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,440
and I foolishly half-remembered an anecdote

601
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,440
that their common ancestor with lions and leopards

602
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,640
originated in Africa.

603
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,040
Everyone is wrong some of the time,

604
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,640
and that's okay.

605
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,840
There'll always be people like Paul

606
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,240
who want you to believe they can do your thinking for you,

607
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,640
but maybe they're not right about that either.

608
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,440
You don't have to think I'm right. I could be wrong.

609
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,240
I could have come to the complete wrong conclusion

610
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,040
about what this evidence suggests,

611
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,640
but you can find it.

612
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,840
It's out there, and you can—

613
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,040
it informs your perspective of everything.

614
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,440
You know, maybe some conservatives eat soy and that's fine.

615
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,040
In fact, that is the case. I've looked it up.

616
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:01,440
And, you know, isn't it all nice?

617
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,640
Go to the evidence, and maybe together,

618
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,440
we can all live in a beautiful world, soy or not,

619
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:14,440
and maybe we'll be gentler and nicer that way.

620
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,840
And if you don't, well, I'll own you on the internet.

621
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,640
Thanks for watching my really dumb rant in the woods.

622
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,240
Here's some footage of me getting sausages thrown in my face.

623
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:51,640
Okay, so it turns out that soy sausages are really hard to hit people with from a distance.

624
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,640
Thanks for watching my really dumb rant in the woods.

625
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,640
Here's some footage of me getting sausages thrown in my face.

626
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:30,240
Okay, so it turns out that soy sausages are really hard to hit people with from a distance.

627
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,240
Thanks for watching my really dumb rant in the woods.

628
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,840
Here's some footage of me getting sausages thrown in my face.

629
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:57,040
Thanks for watching my really dumb rant in the woods.
