0	6920	Hey there. You might have noticed that I like to keep track of all the latest bizarre insults that internet weirdos like to come up with.
6920	13040	You know, cultural Marxist, baiter, cuck, virtue-signaler, all the greats.
13040	16480	One of the latest additions to that list is the term Soy Boy,
16480	23240	which is used to decry everyone who's not like them as degenerate, feminized, weak losers
23240	26920	who are also, for some reason, also leftists because of soy.
26920	28440	So come...
31300	36060	And for once, I hesitate to admit they've scored a slam dunk.
36060	37400	They're onto us.
37400	41440	They know that beans are the reason why leftists think what they believe.
41440	43420	It can't be because of all the evidence.
43440	45020	No. They've got us.
45020	48620	And you can't prove otherwise, because that's just the objective truth.
48620	50540	At least that's they think.
50540	53040	Here's a comment from one of my latest videos.
53240	58540	Go get your chocolates and wine, and cry in the bathtub, you silly cucks.
58540	62840	High soy diets spike estrogen and lower testosterone.
62840	65040	That's not a disputable fact.
66640	69240	So! Let's dispute the facts!
72840	77840	The theory that soy is bad for you stems from a certain superstition in the bodybuilding community.
77840	83140	Here's the YouTube channel of Elliot Hulse, a professional bodybuilder with 1.7 million subscribers.
83140	85840	Your entire body is your brain.
87540	89640	Well, this guy knows what he's talking about.
89640	91440	I wonder what he thinks about soy.
91440	94040	Soy protein makes you weak and womanly.
94040	98140	Almost every bit of soy in the United States, or in the West,
98140	101240	you know, is going to be genetically modified.
101240	106440	Now, I'm not saying pro or con for genetically modified foods, but it's fucking weird.
106840	110440	It just, it sounds like freakish and Frankenstein-ish to me.
110440	112040	I don't know the end result.
112040	115040	You know, it might be the greatest thing that's ever happened to humankind.
115040	116140	I don't fucking know.
116140	117640	I don't think it's a good idea.
117640	119840	I don't like it, but I can't tell you the truth.
119840	121040	You gotta figure it out yourself.
122040	123840	That's a great idea, Elliot.
123840	126540	I'd have never thought of that. Thanks a lot.
126540	131740	So, where's your evidence that soy feminizes people?
131740	139140	I would offer you to pick up a book called The Whole Soy Truth by Kayla Daniels.
139140	143340	Uh, it's actually called The Whole Soy Story, Elliot, but let's not get hung up on that.
143340	148340	This book is authored by professional nutritional iconoclast Dr. Kayla T. Daniel,
148340	152540	the naughty nutritionist telling the truth that's too hot to handle.
152540	156040	I believe that's code for my work isn't peer-reviewed.
156040	158540	She used to call herself the naughty survivalist,
158540	161240	but she eventually changed her name and wardrobe
161240	164540	after realizing her target audience were having trouble finding her
164540	169740	in that camo jacket amongst all the dense foliage in her beige living room.
169740	173040	She outlined some of her main claims about soy in her video entitled
173040	176640	Moobs, Man Boobs, and Other Environmental Estrogens.
176640	180840	All of those soybeans contain phytoestrogens.
180840	187840	That's plant estrogens, and they are a form of estrogenizing influence on the body.
187840	191740	They create hormonal havoc. They create endocrine disruption.
191740	195440	Soy contains phytoestrogens, which are obviously feminizing,
195440	197440	because they're the plant version of estrogen,
197440	200340	resulting in lowered testosterone along with stuff like man boobs
200340	204040	or being turned into a weak-willed feminist who definitely doesn't even lift.
204040	207840	Now, Dr. Daniels' description doesn't list any sources for this,
207840	210240	and the rational skeptic thing to do in this context
210240	213240	would obviously be to just assume that means there aren't any without checking.
213640	217640	So, alas, it seems that I'm not a true skeptic yet.
217640	221340	I'm just a mere mortal, because I went and checked anyway,
221340	223940	and I did find some studies,
223940	226140	but...
226140	230240	how do I put this in a way that makes it not sound rude?
230240	233840	The studies didn't say anything like what this...
233840	237640	lying liar lied about.
237640	240440	For example, while trying to find studies on the effects of soy intake
240440	242340	on estrogen and testosterone levels,
242340	247440	I found a paper which assessed all English-language studies there had been as of 2008
247440	250540	in which men consumed soy and their testosterone was tested,
250540	252740	which, at the time, was 32.
252740	254040	Check out the link in the description.
254040	258840	The paper pretty definitively suggests that soy foods, and the phytoestrogens in them thereof,
258840	261940	do not alter the testosterone concentration in men.
261940	264340	Bear in mind, this wasn't just one study.
264340	269740	This was a meta-analysis of the results of all 32 other studies there had been at the time.
269840	275940	Now, does that mean we can therefore conclude that soy has no effect on testosterone levels?
275940	277440	Not quite.
277440	282040	You see, in science, it's rarely productive to be that conclusive about something.
282040	287340	Instead, we'll say that the evidence quite reliably suggests that that's the case.
287340	292340	But what about soy's effects on other things that men like to worry about a lot, like, uh, sperm count?
292340	294340	Well, another paper from 2010,
294340	298840	examining the nine clinical studies into the effects of isoflavone exposure on estrogen levels,
298840	303340	found no evidence that it affects those levels at all, which suggests there's no link.
303340	305340	Now, at this point in my research, I was wondering,
305340	308040	why are phytoestrogens even called estrogens,
308040	312240	when taking them doesn't seem to affect the levels of estrogen or testosterone in your blood?
312240	316740	Well, it's because, in terms of chemical structure, they're very similar.
316740	318640	Here's a handy picture I found on Wikipedia,
318640	323740	comparing the makeup of isoflavones and coumastans to estradiol, the major estrogen hormone.
323740	328440	Their construction is very similar, but the actual chemical components are very different.
328440	331240	This means they do bind with estrogen receptors,
331240	334940	but the effects are very different because, to put it scientifically,
334940	336640	they're made of different stuff.
336640	339640	This means that they don't really have comparable effects.
339640	341240	But who cares about that?
341240	344640	Kayla Daniel is fighting back with rigorously researched, uh...
345640	347240	...anecdotes.
347240	348240	Like this one!
350040	353140	Scientists first linked phytoestrogens with lowered sperm count
353140	358040	and other reproductive problems in the 1940s, when they diagnosed clover disease in sheep.
359440	361440	...
361440	363440	...
363440	365440	...
367840	372240	Dr. Daniel is so strapped for actual compelling evidence
372240	378840	that she's down to studies from the 40s looking at the effects of a different plant on sheep.
378840	382140	Now, I never really paid that much attention in biology class.
382140	384240	I'm really sorry, Mrs. Baldwin.
384240	390440	But I'm pretty sure I distantly remember that humans are monogastric mammals,
390440	394440	which means that we have one stomach that digests everything we eat.
394440	399640	Whereas some animals, for example sheep, are ruminants,
399640	403840	which means they have a four-chambered stomach that digests things multiple times,
403840	407840	and they also regurgitate food so that they can chew it again and swallow it again.
407840	411640	It's a little bit disgusting, but that's just how some animals digest things.
411640	414840	This is why sheep can eat grass, but humans can't.
414840	418040	Well, you- you can. No one's stopping you. There's no laws.
418040	423640	Ah! Just try and stop me, Brussels! Ah!
423640	425440	...
425440	431040	Grass contains silica, which can seriously mess up your teeth, like, permanently.
431040	432840	Do not even do this for a joke.
432840	438640	So, given the quite large dietary, digestive, and metabolic differences between humans and sheep,
438640	445240	I think it's fair to say that maybe a study about how male sheep digested red clover
445240	450840	and the effect that had on them might not be fully relevant to the effects of soy isoflavones on humans.
450840	455840	So, to sum up, some plants make a hormone that looks like estrogen in composition,
455840	459240	but doesn't have the same effects because it's actually a very different chemical.
459240	464440	However, some people who don't know that and can't be bothered to check saw the word estrogen
464440	468240	and leapt to conclusions that it must be feminizing the same way estrogen is.
468240	473440	The way science classifies and names chemicals has effectively tricked a bunch of people
473440	477240	who don't know better into making wild assumptions when the data shows otherwise,
477240	479440	which sucks, but you've got to name things somehow.
479440	482840	You know, it's important that you have a standardized system of classification,
482840	487240	and the one they picked happens to cause massive problems for bodybuilders.
487240	490840	I bet Johnny Science Namer didn't see that coming.
490840	494240	My apologies to the descendants of Antoine Lavoisier.
494240	499840	I'm reminded almost immediately of the equally faux-scientific alpha-beta beliefs
499840	502440	popular among the manosphere, pickup artists, and others,
502440	507640	originally based on a study of wolves that was later found through future research by its own author
507640	510040	to not even be accurate to wolves.
510040	514840	These same kinds of folks have happily combined these two half-baked concepts,
514840	520440	hence the use of terms like low-T-beta and the insistence that soy must have something to do with it
520440	522440	because that's what they all eat, apparently.
522440	525440	And I think I saw a word with estrogen in it somewhere.
525440	528640	I rest my case on the edge of a cliff.
528640	531640	Oh, no, the case has fallen off!
531640	533440	Oh, no, it's on fire!
533440	538640	Soy and its supposed effects was eventually picked up by the closest thing the far right has to journalism,
538640	541240	rebel media, and then later InfoWars.
541240	545640	Incidentally, InfoWars sells diet supplements containing soy on their website.
545640	548640	Probably should have checked the label there, shouldn't you, Paul?
548640	549840	I take brain force.
549840	556440	Which brings us to InfoWars editor, soy hater, and soy salesman, Paul Joseph Watson's video on the topic,
556440	560440	which we're going to look at in more detail now because I think it'll be quite useful to do so.
560440	561440	And also funny!
561440	564640	The video begins with a spiel about the BuzzFeed Try Guys.
564640	568440	You've probably seen the BuzzFeed Try Guys video where they measure their testosterone
568440	571640	and it's literally half or less the normal level for a man.
571640	577840	Their testosterone is so low, it's below the average for an 85 to 100-year-old man.
577840	584440	This claim, and in fact this exact table, has appeared all over the rogues' gallery of right-wing and manosphere websites.
584440	591840	InfoWars has it, of course, but there's also Return of Kings, Daily Wire, alt-right.com, Reddit, Return of Kings again?
591840	594640	So it's like a game! You guys are writing the same thing!
594640	598840	Gosh, they're really proud of this one, and its founder, Roosh V's internet forum.
598840	604840	These articles and Paul's video are full of speculation that this testosterone level is completely unhealthy and terrible and bad for you.
604840	607440	But...is it?
607440	611040	I'm not really sure I see the validity in looking at one number and saying,
611040	616840	Aha! These guys are dangerously unhealthy because of a graph I googled of averages.
616840	619640	Human biology is rarely so simple.
619640	625040	Trying to stick as close as you can to a number you found on the net can be incredibly damaging.
625040	630040	In 2010, on a forum for discussing supplements, a guy had a test and found he had a level of 212.
630240	632840	Again, the exact same level as Ned, supposedly.
632840	636440	But then, half a month later, it went up to 364,
636440	641440	suggesting these numbers are a temporary fluctuation that's fairly normal in a 25-year-old male.
641440	647640	Despite this, anonymous people on the internet started telling him he had the testosterone of a 70-year-old,
647640	651240	and others recommending a dosing cycle of steroids.
651240	656240	All of this because of a cargo cult approach to a number on a graph.
656240	661440	This is illustrative of some quite deep hang-ups and anxieties in male-centric circles
661440	666040	towards a single hormone of many that they've been told constitutes manliness.
666040	668640	This isn't just a silly belief that some people are wrong about.
668640	671040	This is an actively damaging approach.
671040	675240	I sincerely hope that this guy didn't start taking steroids
675240	681640	because his hormone levels briefly, on one test, fluctuated below a level that he found on Google.
681640	685240	Personal anecdote, when I was 21, I was really worried about this sort of thing.
685240	690440	I went in for a blood test, and the doctor told me that I had above-average testosterone for someone my age,
690440	692040	which was really, really cool.
692040	696240	But then the doctor said, you know, a lot of people your age come in worrying about this stuff,
696240	698240	and it's really quite silly.
698240	701040	If you're healthy, and you're not experiencing any major problems,
701040	704440	and your blood panel comes up fine for no other major disorders,
704440	708640	then chances are whatever testosterone level you have is fine for you,
708640	713640	and actively chasing a number that you found on the internet can be really, really damaging.
713640	717440	If you take steroids, it can mess up your body's internal hormone production,
717440	721040	and actually reduce the level of testosterone that your body makes.
721040	726440	And, really, all you're doing is enriching the supplement industry.
726440	730640	Just out of interest right now, let's take a show of hands as to which is more likely to be true.
730640	734240	That all four of these guys has an unhealthily low testosterone level,
734240	736640	even for someone several times their age,
736640	740040	and the literal doctor who they visit regularly for videos like this,
740040	745040	Dr. Jesse Mills, a urologist specializing in male reproductive medicine and surgery,
745040	747840	and director of the men's clinic at UCLA,
747840	749840	hasn't noticed anything from these tests,
749840	753840	or let any of them know that they need to do something about their dangerously low testosterone,
753840	757440	despite it literally being the thing that he specializes in,
757440	762440	or that right-wing idiots on web forums who googled a number in five seconds
762440	766040	don't know everything there is to know about the science of endocrinology.
766040	768840	That's the study of hormones, by the way. What a lovely word.
768840	774240	The meat, or should I say the plant protein, of Paul's video is situated entirely around the claim
774240	777040	that soy is bad for you because it contains phytoestrogens.
777040	780040	In other words, the thing we've already debunked in this video.
780040	783240	But, for a laugh, let's look at how he does it specifically.
783240	786240	Soybeans contain high amounts of phytoestrogens,
786240	791040	organic compounds that mimic the female hormone estrogen in the human body.
791040	794040	This reduces testosterone and lowers male sperm count.
794440	799040	Paul here is word-for-word quoting an article in Scientific American.
799040	804840	Well, actually, it's a very short post on the blog section of the Scientific American website,
804840	807640	and by word-for-word, I mean...
807640	810440	Soybeans contain high amounts of phytoestrogens,
810440	815240	organic compounds that mimic the female hormone estrogen in the human body.
815240	818440	This reduces testosterone and lowers male sperm count.
818440	821040	This bit is, uh, how do I put this?
821040	823840	Not there. Paul made that bit up.
824040	826240	The article actually said,
826240	829040	and in animal studies,
829040	831640	has been shown to reduce testosterone levels.
831640	836640	Here, we're seeing the right-wing reactionary's approach to scientific process drawn into close focus.
836640	841240	When reading a piece of information he is quoting as a source of truth in his video
841240	844040	and finding that it's just a little bit too nuanced,
844040	846840	he alters and rewords it to suit his own agenda.
846840	849840	I see here we're back at the Kayla Daniels School of Science
849840	853040	where sheep and humans apparently have the same digestive system.
853040	855440	I'm fairly certain that the blog post here
855440	858440	is referring to the studies on sheep we mentioned earlier.
858440	860240	I don't know for certain, though,
860240	862440	because the blog doesn't cite a source for this claim
862440	864640	because it's a rubbish one-paragraph blog
864640	868240	that only an idiot would source as definitive proof of anything.
868240	869240	You might be thinking,
869240	871840	oh, but the word testosterone is highlighted.
871840	876040	Maybe if I click it, it'll link to the study showing it.
876040	879240	It doesn't. It links to another article about testosterone.
879240	882840	In fact, it links to an article from after this one was written.
882840	887640	Someone went back and added the link to explain what testosterone is...
887640	889240	four years later?
889240	892840	Who's in charge of the blog section of Scientific American?
892840	893840	You might even think,
893840	897840	oh, what about that link to the human reproduction PDF?
897840	899240	Let's open that real quick.
899240	903040	It appears to be an OxfordJournals.org press release
903040	905440	about some kind of journal,
905440	908240	but it's a blank PDF now.
908240	912440	So, I mean, they're trying to cite sources, but...
912440	915840	So, Paul's proof that phytoestrogen reduces testosterone is
915840	919640	A, some tests on sheep from the 40s
919640	921240	that he hasn't even read
921240	923440	because the blog post he's using as a source
923440	925040	doesn't even link to it,
925040	927440	and B, being ignorant of the fact
927440	931440	that there's been 32 studies of the effects of phytoestrogens on humans
931440	933440	that found no connection whatsoever.
933440	936040	Now, just as an aside, I think it's important to point out
936040	938640	that animal studies aren't inherently useless.
938640	942240	Animals can be good pointers for the effects of a substance on humans,
942440	944640	and we can also perform tests on animals
944640	947040	that it would be unethical to do on humans.
947040	950040	However, when there are examples of human data,
950040	951840	barring extenuating circumstances,
951840	954040	the human data is probably more accurate.
954040	957640	The 40s sheep study, or other studies on animals for that matter,
957640	959440	should not be given as much consideration
959440	962240	if they contradict the research we've done on humans.
962240	966040	This article was published on July the 23rd, 2008,
966040	969240	and we know, because I cleverly set this up by telling you earlier,
969240	971840	that as of July the 1st, 2008,
971840	974440	there were 32 studies into the effects of soy
974440	976240	on human testosterone levels.
976240	978040	This article brings up animal studies
978040	980040	specifically because that's all they've got
980040	983040	backing up their hypothesis that tofu lowers sperm count,
983040	985040	apart from the study they're about to reference,
985040	988240	which we're gonna get to in a second once we see how Paul sums it up.
988240	990640	Men who eat half a serving of soy a day
990640	994440	have 34 million fewer sperm per millimetre
994440	995240	than those who don't.
995240	996240	Wait, what was that?
996240	997640	Sperm per millimetre.
997640	999040	Sperm per millimetre.
999040	1000040	Millimetre.
1000040	1003440	Okay, before we even get to the study,
1003440	1005040	before we even get to the—
1005040	1006840	The word is millilitre,
1006840	1009440	millilitre is a measurement of liquid,
1009440	1012840	and a millimetre is a measurement of length.
1012840	1014840	I don't even know how you got this wrong.
1014840	1017840	The word is literally in front of—
1017840	1020640	Paul, you're a fucking journalist!
1020640	1023040	It's such a simple thing to get right,
1023040	1024240	and he can't even—
1024240	1026840	Now, far be it from me to take Paul,
1027040	1030640	or the one-paragraph blog post he cites entitled
1030640	1033240	Soy Vey at their word,
1033240	1036440	but I'm gonna go ahead and actually check the sources they cite.
1036440	1039240	Check out the link in the description, sperm fans!
1039240	1041640	The scientists got some men to provide a semen sample
1041640	1044040	and answer a questionnaire about what foods they consumed,
1044040	1045640	including foods that contained soy.
1045640	1047640	They then sorted the samples into four groups,
1047640	1050840	no soy intake and then varying tiers of soy intake,
1050840	1052840	and looked to see if there was a correlation
1052840	1054440	with the results of the sperm sample.
1054440	1056240	The mean average sperm concentration
1056240	1058640	in millions per milliliter was 106
1058640	1060640	for the group with no soy food servings,
1060640	1062240	while the average for the group that had
1062240	1065040	over 0.3 servings per day was 72,
1065040	1068640	which does kind of show a correlation, doesn't it?
1068640	1072240	However, you might notice a couple of weird things here.
1072240	1075040	Firstly, the group that has between 0.01
1075040	1079040	and 0.07 servings per day had an average of 92,
1079040	1082040	but the group with between 0.08 and 0.29,
1082040	1083640	which is quite a bit more,
1083640	1086440	had 104, more than the previous group,
1086440	1088440	only slightly less than having none,
1088440	1090840	and way more than having over 0.3.
1090840	1092040	What's going on there?
1092040	1094840	Something weird's going on with these men's sperm counts.
1094840	1097640	On top of that, looking at the results section of the paper,
1097640	1100240	the majority of men, 72%,
1100240	1102640	were defined as overweight or obese,
1102640	1104640	whether or not they ate any soy,
1104640	1108440	and 10% had below 20 million sperm per milliliter,
1108440	1110240	which is less than the low bar for sperm
1110240	1112040	the World Health Organization used to,
1112040	1114840	up until the late 90s, consider a healthy sperm count.
1114840	1115840	Why is this?
1115840	1117640	Well, here's the part where I pull the chair out
1117640	1118440	from under you.
1118440	1120640	It's because the men invited to the test
1120640	1123440	were the male partners of subfertile couples,
1123440	1124840	couples who, for one reason or another,
1124840	1126640	have been trying to produce a child
1126640	1127640	but haven't been able to,
1127640	1129840	who had gone to the Massachusetts General Hospital
1129840	1130840	for evaluation.
1130840	1132440	All the men in the study,
1132440	1134240	whether or not they consumed soy,
1134240	1137040	had already been having troubles achieving pregnancy.
1137040	1138640	That's how they found them.
1138840	1142240	By the way, uh, the study's name
1142240	1145240	mentions that it's men at an infertility clinic, right?
1145240	1148440	And neither Paul's video nor the blog post he cites
1148440	1150840	even mention that, and it's in its name!
1150840	1154040	This is not a straightforward test of an average population.
1154040	1156440	On top of that, how many men were actually tested
1156440	1157640	in this study?
1157640	1161440	4,000? 1,000? 500?
1161440	1164240	Well, it was actually 99 men.
1164240	1166640	That's really not big enough for a study
1166840	1169840	That's really not big enough for the results of this study
1169840	1172640	to be easily applicable to any human population.
1172640	1174040	If you're going to count studies
1174040	1176040	with a questionably low sample size,
1176040	1178040	then you might as well look at the study
1178040	1180040	by Song et al. in 2006,
1180040	1183640	which studied only 48 men with a control group of 10
1183640	1185640	and found that plant phytoestrogen intake
1185640	1188040	was correlated with higher sperm count
1188040	1190640	and higher sperm DNA integrity.
1190640	1193840	But 48 men, or even 99 men,
1193840	1195640	isn't really enough for the results
1195640	1197840	of either to suggest much of anything.
1197840	1199240	I hope it goes without saying
1199240	1201040	that a study of 99 men
1201040	1203840	who were already having fertility problems
1203840	1206640	is not enough to come to a sweeping generalization
1206640	1208840	about the effects of soy on sperm count
1208840	1210640	or testosterone, for that matter.
1210640	1212840	And in case it doesn't go without saying,
1212840	1215640	the study concludes by saying it,
1215640	1217640	and I quote...
1218640	1219640	Uh...
1219640	1220640	Uh...
1220640	1221640	Uh...
1221640	1222640	Uh...
1222640	1223640	Uh...
1223640	1224640	Uh...
1224640	1225640	Uh...
1225640	1226640	Uh...
1226640	1227640	Uh...
1227640	1228640	Uh...
1228640	1229640	Uh...
1229640	1230640	Okay.
1230640	1232640	The clinical significance of these findings
1232640	1234640	remains to be determined.
1234640	1238240	Owing to the scarcity of human data in this area,
1238240	1241640	it is very important that this issue is examined further.
1242640	1244640	This is Paul's source!
1244840	1248040	This is the thing he uses to prove the things he believes!
1248040	1249640	And even it says,
1249640	1253240	fucking don't come to a bullshit conclusion!
1253240	1255240	We don't know enough about it!
1256640	1260440	And yet, it seems like Paul's audience
1260440	1262640	lapped this up anyway,
1262640	1264640	like milk from the udders
1264640	1268640	of the world's most disgusting kind of metaphorical cow,
1268640	1269640	the...
1269640	1271640	the lie cow!
1271640	1273640	Here's another interesting thing I noticed.
1273640	1275640	Despite his attempts to demonstrate
1275640	1278640	that soy lowers testosterone and sperm count,
1278640	1280640	the BuzzFeed Try Guys, incidentally,
1280640	1283640	did a video where they have their sperm tested.
1283640	1286640	All four Try Guys have a sperm concentration
1286640	1290240	well over the normal count of 15 million sperm per milliliter
1290240	1292240	established by the World Health Organization,
1292240	1294240	with Keith having an, um...
1294240	1296640	atrociously high count per milliliter
1296640	1300240	despite having well below what Paul claims is normal testosterone,
1300240	1303640	and Ned, who had the lowest testosterone by far,
1303640	1307240	had a total sperm count of 248.6 million,
1307240	1310240	over 10 million sperm more than Eugene,
1310240	1313240	who had the highest testosterone of the group by far.
1313240	1314640	This is anecdotal evidence,
1314640	1316440	but that's really not much of a correlation
1316440	1318440	between testosterone and sperm count, is it?
1318440	1320640	Unless, of course, Paul means to tell me
1320640	1323640	that Keith has well below the average testosterone levels
1323640	1326240	of an 85- to 100-year-old man
1326240	1329040	while...blasting sperm
1329040	1331240	like he's Zeus from Mount Olympus.
1331240	1333240	There's also a bit where he attempts to tie
1333240	1336240	the increased production of soy in the West
1336240	1338440	with the general reduction in testosterone
1338440	1339640	around the same time.
1339640	1341440	Obviously, it's not the only factor,
1341440	1342440	but consider this.
1342440	1345440	In 1992, soy food sales in the U.S.
1345440	1347040	stood at $300 million a year.
1347040	1350840	They now stand at over $4 billion a year.
1350840	1353440	This has coincided with a substantial drop
1353440	1356840	in men's testosterone levels in the U.S. since the 80s.
1356840	1358440	Hey, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul.
1358440	1360040	I'll give you this. I'll give you this one for free.
1360040	1361640	Google the word...
1361640	1362640	coincidence?
1362640	1365440	Seriously, this is the best he has to offer.
1365440	1367240	The only other major things he cites
1367240	1369240	are the guy I already showed you
1369240	1370840	and the nutritionist whose book's name
1370840	1372040	that guy got wrong.
1372040	1373240	It's kind of ironic, isn't it,
1373240	1375440	that Paul and his audience is blindly following
1375440	1376840	Kayla Daniels on this,
1376840	1379040	given that the main source for her claims
1379040	1383040	is a story about a bunch of fucking sheep.
1383040	1385240	He even, and this is really interesting,
1385240	1387240	cites as proof that men get man boobs
1387240	1389840	because of soy the same video I found
1389840	1391640	while I was doing research into this.
1391640	1393040	You know, the one that cites
1393040	1394840	no credible evidence whatsoever.
1394840	1397840	Weird that he'd make that his source for his claims.
1397840	1399440	What's even weirder, though,
1399440	1401440	is that since Paul's video came out,
1401440	1404440	the description of the video has been edited to read,
1404440	1407040	note, Paul Joseph Watson used an excerpt
1407040	1408640	from this video in his popular video
1408640	1410840	The Truth About Soy Boys illegally
1410840	1413040	without the permission of Dr. Kayla Daniel.
1413040	1415440	She finds his perspective offensive.
1415440	1418240	This is Paul Joseph Watson's bulletproof source,
1418240	1421040	a nutritionist with little to no scientific basis
1421040	1423240	for their claims whose video Paul took
1423240	1425040	without even bothering to ask
1425040	1427640	to make his personal ridiculous right-wing view
1427640	1429240	of the issue seem more credible,
1429240	1431840	a view the person he's claiming as a source
1431840	1434240	openly says she finds offensive.
1434240	1435840	I hope Paul gets a fucking medal
1435840	1438240	for how idiotic he's managed to be in this video.
1438240	1440240	It's almost mind-boggling how backwards
1440240	1442640	he's managed to get scientific reality.
1442840	1444640	-...
1444640	1446440	...
1446440	1447840	...
1447840	1449440	...
1449440	1450640	...
1450640	1452840	In conclusion, it may well be the case
1452840	1456640	that soy is feminizing and makes you really unfit
1456640	1459440	and isn't just caused by Paul's sedentary lifestyle
1459440	1461040	or my love of Twizzlers,
1461040	1464040	but if it is the case that soy makes you into a,
1464040	1467840	you know, a no-testosterone, no-sperm baby man,
1467840	1470640	then the time to believe that
1470640	1472840	is when there is evidence.
1472840	1474640	In the words of David Hume,
1474640	1476440	and this makes me smarter because, you know,
1476440	1478040	I can regurgitate a quote,
1478040	1483040	the wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.
1485040	1487440	Which brings me to the real question here.
1487440	1489440	You know, it's not just some people are wrong
1489440	1492040	about the science of isoflavones or whatever.
1492040	1493840	The real question is,
1493840	1497840	why do right-wing idiots keep sharing obvious lies
1497840	1501640	in order to perpetuate the things they want to believe?
1501640	1504040	Why isn't the truth enough?
1504040	1506040	The book, When Prophecy Fails,
1506040	1508040	relates the findings of social psychologists
1508040	1509640	who studied a doomsday cult
1509640	1511440	that believed the apocalypse was coming.
1511440	1513640	When the date of the end of the world came and went,
1513640	1516440	many of the cult remained committed to its beliefs anyway,
1516440	1518640	decided that the world had simply been spared
1518640	1520640	or the end had merely been delayed.
1520640	1523040	The psychologists found that when a group of people
1523040	1524840	is utterly committed to an idea,
1524840	1527640	even if undeniable proof it is not true
1527640	1528840	is presented to them,
1528840	1530840	they can find a way to remain steadfast
1530840	1532640	in their initial false beliefs.
1532640	1536240	The term cognitive dissonance was invented by Leon Festinger,
1536240	1538240	the book's main author and lead psychologist,
1538240	1539440	a year later.
1539440	1541440	The small, close-knit,
1541440	1544440	definitely-not-cult-like corners of the Internet
1544440	1546840	are sure they already know the truth
1546840	1548440	about how the world works
1548440	1550440	and appear to be hoping to piece together
1550440	1552040	a justification for their beliefs
1552040	1553840	by aggregating enough buzzwords
1553840	1555640	that it somehow proves they're right.
1555640	1558240	The only men who seriously watch BuzzFeed
1558240	1560040	are tofu-eating, male-feminist,
1560040	1562040	virtue-signaling, beta-orbiter
1562040	1563040	SOYBOYS.
1563040	1565040	They're virtue-signalers.
1565040	1566840	They're cultural Marxists.
1566840	1568240	They're betas.
1568240	1570240	They must have low testosterone.
1570240	1571440	They must be cucks.
1571440	1573640	They must have had too much of a bean
1573640	1576040	that's been a staple in the diet of Asian countries
1576040	1577440	for thousands of years.
1577440	1580040	I don't need to talk about evidence for my beliefs
1580040	1581640	because everyone who isn't like me
1581640	1583240	is all of these bad things,
1583240	1585040	and that's why I'm right.
1585040	1586440	It's important to recognize
1586440	1588440	that this isn't an external claim.
1588440	1590840	People don't wallpaper this all over their Facebook
1590840	1592240	and Twitter feeds because they think
1592240	1594640	it'll convince someone else to believe it.
1594640	1595840	That's not the point.
1595840	1597840	It's an internal claim.
1597840	1600840	They're repeatedly talking to themselves
1600840	1603040	because they want to believe it.
1603040	1606040	It's a mental diversion from the actual truth,
1606040	1608640	which is that other people have different ideas than them
1608640	1610440	because the evidence sometimes suggests
1610440	1611840	their beliefs are wrong.
1611840	1613640	Without spreading ideas like that
1613640	1615640	Tsui causes leftism,
1615640	1617240	these folks would have to come to terms
1617240	1619240	with the possibility that people might have
1619240	1621640	good reasons to think differently from them,
1621640	1623840	and admitting that would be too much.
1623840	1626240	That would mean maybe they're not correct.
1626240	1628840	Maybe their understanding of the world is incomplete.
1628840	1631040	It can be scary to truly consider
1631040	1633440	you might not know something and can be wrong.
1633440	1635840	This explains the prevalence of people like Paul
1635840	1638840	who help distract people from their fears of being wrong
1638840	1640840	by acting as figures of authority
1640840	1642040	who can tell them no.
1642040	1643240	Trust me.
1643240	1645040	I know what I'm talking about,
1645040	1646440	and you're right already.
1646440	1648840	You don't need to do any more thinking.
1648840	1650640	Everyone who's different from you
1650640	1653040	is a gender communist.
1653040	1654840	If you happen to be a fan of Paul
1654840	1656840	who managed to stick around to the end,
1656840	1658840	thanks for hearing me out all the way.
1658840	1661040	There's already undoubtedly tons of comments
1661040	1662240	about stopping partway through
1662240	1664440	because they can't stand the sound of my voice
1664440	1667440	or because I'm clearly a leftist shill Tsui boy.
1667440	1669640	You've outsmarted all of those people
1669640	1672440	by actually listening to what someone else has to say
1672440	1675040	and really having to think about the evidence.
1675040	1676640	It might be comfortable
1676640	1679440	having a YouTuber affirming your ideas,
1679440	1681240	but the truth can't hurt you.
1681240	1683240	In fact, it can set you free.
1683240	1685240	Having a greater understanding of the world
1685240	1686840	can only ever be a good thing,
1686840	1689240	and being able to change your conclusions
1689240	1690640	when presented with new evidence
1690640	1692240	is a far more important skill
1692240	1695040	than happening to be right first time about something.
1695040	1696840	I've been wrong about plenty of things.
1696840	1699240	In one video, I claimed tigers were from Africa.
1699240	1701240	They actually only live in India in the wild,
1701240	1703440	and I foolishly half-remembered an anecdote
1703440	1705440	that their common ancestor with lions and leopards
1705440	1706640	originated in Africa.
1706640	1709040	Everyone is wrong some of the time,
1709040	1710640	and that's okay.
1710640	1712840	There'll always be people like Paul
1712840	1716240	who want you to believe they can do your thinking for you,
1716240	1718640	but maybe they're not right about that either.
1718640	1720440	You don't have to think I'm right. I could be wrong.
1720440	1722240	I could have come to the complete wrong conclusion
1722240	1724040	about what this evidence suggests,
1724040	1725640	but you can find it.
1725640	1726840	It's out there, and you can—
1726840	1729040	it informs your perspective of everything.
1729240	1732440	You know, maybe some conservatives eat soy and that's fine.
1732440	1735040	In fact, that is the case. I've looked it up.
1735040	1741440	And, you know, isn't it all nice?
1741440	1745640	Go to the evidence, and maybe together,
1745640	1748440	we can all live in a beautiful world, soy or not,
1748440	1754440	and maybe we'll be gentler and nicer that way.
1754440	1759840	And if you don't, well, I'll own you on the internet.
1759840	1762640	Thanks for watching my really dumb rant in the woods.
1762640	1765240	Here's some footage of me getting sausages thrown in my face.
1784440	1791640	Okay, so it turns out that soy sausages are really hard to hit people with from a distance.
1814440	1819640	Thanks for watching my really dumb rant in the woods.
1819640	1823640	Here's some footage of me getting sausages thrown in my face.
1823640	1830240	Okay, so it turns out that soy sausages are really hard to hit people with from a distance.
