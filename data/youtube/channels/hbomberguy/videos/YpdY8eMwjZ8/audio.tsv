0	6100	Blizzard's famous team-based multiplayer online first-person shooter video game has just updated,
6100	10560	and along with making Zarya's ult capable of actually killing half the roster,
10560	14600	and forgetting once again to add the very important feature from the trailers,
14600	17880	where Widowmaker's butt inflates for added aim stability,
17880	21540	they included a new character, Mr. Doomfist.
21540	24880	The character is well-known in the lore of Overwatch, the...
24880	25880	ICONIC
25880	27000	DOOMFIST,
27080	30240	having appeared in one of the cinematic advertisement trailers,
30240	33160	and ads for exhibits about him are in the game too.
33160	40840	The name and mantle of Doomfist have been handed down from numerous characters to others in the past.
40840	45840	Apparently Blizzard are so close to running out of names that now several characters just have to share.
45840	51160	Many players have been asking how long it will take for Blizzard to run out of ideas for good characters,
51160	54120	and just put him in the game, and the answer was 14-
54120	58360	Apparently Blizzard didn't do the usual thing they do when they run out of ideas,
58360	60620	and bring Illidan back again,
60620	62240	and since the character just came out,
62240	66200	I thought I should play him for the tiny amount of time I could possibly have played him
66200	69440	in the few days he's been in the game proper, and review him.
69440	74040	You might think it's intellectually dishonest to analyze a character prior to them getting a chance
74040	79440	to be fully integrated into the existing metagame of a competitive experience that's been out for over a year,
79440	81320	and to that I say, um...
81320	83320	So Doomfist has a-
83320	84320	Someone has-
84320	85320	Hold on a sec-
85320	86320	Doomfist has-
86320	87320	Oh...
87320	88320	Doomf-
88320	90320	This is cyberbullying.
90320	95320	Oh, I have to start loading in faster, or I won't be able to talk about the character on the internet for a few more days.
95320	98320	Well, I guess it's time to run some upgrades.
98320	102320	If you want to follow along, carefully extract the front panel of your personal computer.
102320	103320	Um...
103320	104320	Uh...
105320	107320	Watch for excess Plexiglas!
107320	109320	Remove old video card for future consumption-
109320	110320	Ugh...
116320	121320	The trick to overclocking the GPU is to apply a generous amount of thermal paste
121320	123320	to the broadband...
123320	125320	JavaScript.
128320	130320	Your screen is now fully integrated.
130320	131320	And...
131320	133320	JavaScript.
152320	154320	Ah, that's better. Much faster.
154320	155320	Anyway, Doom-
155320	156320	FUCK!
157320	159320	Doomfist has a very interesting moveset,
159320	162320	and I can't wait to see how it translates over to Blizzard's good game,
162320	163320	Heroes of the Storm.
163320	166320	Overwatch has come under fire for having some characters and abilities
166320	169320	that are highly evocative of Valve's highly popular team-based
169320	171320	multiplayer online first-person shooter,
171320	173320	Hat Loot Box 2,
173320	176320	but Blizzard have finally proven themselves to have their own unique ideas
176320	179320	by adding a guy who can charge forwards very quickly
179320	181320	and deal high amounts of melee damage
181320	183320	and recover health for doing it well.
183320	187320	Well, actually, it's a bit different because Doomfist doesn't really gain health.
187320	191320	He just gains temporary shields to differentiate himself from Reaper,
191320	194320	the close-range character who already gets health for hurting people.
194320	198320	He can also uppercut and hang slowly in the air to get shot to death,
198320	200320	but don't worry, if you're feeling really fancy,
200320	202320	you can wait until right before you die to do it,
202320	206320	and then you can fly away to escape being court-martialed.
206320	208320	Overwatch has been praised for its diverse cast of characters
208320	210320	that avoid playing into stereotypes,
210320	213320	which is false because it contains the most horrific caricature
213320	216320	of any people ever conceived and is deeply offensive
216320	217320	to my culture and heritage.
217320	220320	All these years, I've wondered if racism actually exists,
220320	223320	and I've finally found her.
223320	225320	Trying to crash another party, love?
225320	227320	You don't get to call things love.
227320	229320	Only we get to call things love.
229320	231320	Don't worry, loves. Cavalry's here.
231320	233320	Oh, yeah, stay classy, Blizzard.
233320	235320	Just make fun of our culture
235320	238320	and its inability to move beyond mounted horseback troops.
238320	241320	First, Apple refuses to include a pork pie emoji,
241320	243320	and now this.
243320	245320	Listen, Bethesda, I thought we'd patched things up a bit
245320	247320	since the War of Independence,
247320	250320	but this behavior really just spits on my whippet.
250320	252320	There was no need for this.
252320	255320	I'll see you in whatever the Warcraft equivalent
255320	257320	of, uh, Nuremberg is, but it seems the company
257320	259320	have listened to criticism of their reduction
259320	262320	of people to stereotypes by rounding the current roster out
262320	264320	with a villain who's a tribalistic,
264320	266320	half-naked African man covered in horns.
266320	269320	But he really believes that we as humans get stronger
269320	272320	the more conflict that we endure.
272320	274320	You see, he's called Doomfist,
274320	276320	but he's actually a very deep and interesting character
276320	278320	because he thinks he's right,
278320	281320	unlike all other antagonists in the history of stories.
281320	283320	To voice him, Valve hired Sarn Gauja,
283320	285320	a respected director and actor whose ancestry
285320	288320	reflects the canonical one they had in mind for the character.
288320	291320	But why didn't they let Terry Crews voice Doomfist?
291320	293320	For reasons that can't possibly be systemic,
293320	295320	I only know the name of one black actor
295320	297320	under the age of 50 they could put
298320	301320	Please sign the petition to replace the Doomfist voice actor
301320	303320	and also put back in Tracer's butt
303320	305320	and also remove Tracer entirely.
305320	307320	I was told that John Henry was overpowered,
307320	309320	but I think his addition to the meta is much more nuanced
309320	311320	than that in that he's also rubbish
311320	313320	and needs to be fixed.
313320	315320	Doomfist's punch does feel good to use, though,
315320	317320	and he can even knock his enemy off cliffs
317320	319320	like Lucio, the healer, only he can only do it
319320	321320	to one person at a time, so he's not even
321320	324320	as good a killer as the guy's fucking support class.
324320	326320	I'm really not certain Overwatch needed another attack hero.
326320	328320	We already had Genji Man, High Noon Man,
328320	330320	Justice Ro-ugh!
330320	332320	Ghost Boy, Scythe's Dad,
332320	334320	a racist caricature,
334320	336320	and Sombra, a hacker so powerful
336320	338320	that even your teammates disappear from the game
338320	340320	when you pick her. To be honest,
340320	342320	they could have made him have more health, deal a bit less damage,
342320	344320	and maybe gain more shields from his abilities
344320	346320	and make him a really interesting
346320	348320	new tank-type character
348320	350320	or come up with some other gimmick that makes him function
350320	352320	as a support, like maybe his ult
352320	354320	makes a bunch of Doomfists fly out of his fist
354320	356320	onto your teammates' fists,
356320	358320	and it vastly improves everyone's melee damage
358320	360320	for a few seconds, so you suddenly get everyone
360320	362320	on your team wrecking people with Doomfists
362320	364320	while the character applauds how strong
364320	366320	they've become under his tutelage or something.
366320	368320	Blizzard sold me this free character
368320	370320	with the promise that I'd be invincible
370320	372320	and Tracer would deal an insignificant amount of damage
372320	374320	and then be killed, which is a really good idea
374320	376320	if you ask, you need to patch the game,
376320	378320	Jeffrey. She's doing it again.
378320	380320	This is textbook false advertising.
380320	382320	Someone increase the jurisdiction of the FDA
382320	384320	and then call the FDGA.
384320	386320	So many skins in Overwatch
386320	388320	for the male characters expose one of their nippies.
388320	390320	Activision Lion's Head have one of the most
390320	392320	weirdly specific sociopolitical
392320	394320	agendas ever. I half expect
394320	396320	the next character's shift ability to expose
396320	398320	his nipple even more, and his ult
398320	400320	probably makes them reveal their drop rates
400320	402320	in compliance with Chinese law
402320	404320	and the enemy team dies of starvation
404320	406320	trying to get the new nipple skins in loot boxes.
406320	408320	Oh, speaking of loot boxes, here's two
408320	410320	I forgot to open before he got patched in.
410320	412320	Oh, man, maybe I already got one
412320	414320	of his skins.
414320	416320	Oh,
416320	418320	lovely, all the things that I already had
418320	420320	and they aren't even good things I already had.
420320	422320	Oh, boy, I'm so glad I bought this
422320	424320	instead of Battleborn.
424320	426320	Oh!
426320	428320	It's taking a moment to load in.
428320	430320	It could be the new...

594320	598320	I'm certain my problems with Mob Psycho 100 Punch Man will be solved
598320	603320	when he's been out for more than a few days, and I learn how to play him properly, and the meta gets a hold of him,
603320	608320	and Blizzard inevitably patch and balance him more. But you need to be current to drive engagement with your channel,
608320	610320	so I made the video now.
