WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.100
Blizzard's famous team-based multiplayer online first-person shooter video game has just updated,

00:06.100 --> 00:10.560
and along with making Zarya's ult capable of actually killing half the roster,

00:10.560 --> 00:14.600
and forgetting once again to add the very important feature from the trailers,

00:14.600 --> 00:17.880
where Widowmaker's butt inflates for added aim stability,

00:17.880 --> 00:21.540
they included a new character, Mr. Doomfist.

00:21.540 --> 00:24.880
The character is well-known in the lore of Overwatch, the...

00:24.880 --> 00:25.880
ICONIC

00:25.880 --> 00:27.000
DOOMFIST,

00:27.080 --> 00:30.240
having appeared in one of the cinematic advertisement trailers,

00:30.240 --> 00:33.160
and ads for exhibits about him are in the game too.

00:33.160 --> 00:40.840
The name and mantle of Doomfist have been handed down from numerous characters to others in the past.

00:40.840 --> 00:45.840
Apparently Blizzard are so close to running out of names that now several characters just have to share.

00:45.840 --> 00:51.160
Many players have been asking how long it will take for Blizzard to run out of ideas for good characters,

00:51.160 --> 00:54.120
and just put him in the game, and the answer was 14-

00:54.120 --> 00:58.360
Apparently Blizzard didn't do the usual thing they do when they run out of ideas,

00:58.360 --> 01:00.620
and bring Illidan back again,

01:00.620 --> 01:02.240
and since the character just came out,

01:02.240 --> 01:06.200
I thought I should play him for the tiny amount of time I could possibly have played him

01:06.200 --> 01:09.440
in the few days he's been in the game proper, and review him.

01:09.440 --> 01:14.040
You might think it's intellectually dishonest to analyze a character prior to them getting a chance

01:14.040 --> 01:19.440
to be fully integrated into the existing metagame of a competitive experience that's been out for over a year,

01:19.440 --> 01:21.320
and to that I say, um...

01:21.320 --> 01:23.320
So Doomfist has a-

01:23.320 --> 01:24.320
Someone has-

01:24.320 --> 01:25.320
Hold on a sec-

01:25.320 --> 01:26.320
Doomfist has-

01:26.320 --> 01:27.320
Oh...

01:27.320 --> 01:28.320
Doomf-

01:28.320 --> 01:30.320
This is cyberbullying.

01:30.320 --> 01:35.320
Oh, I have to start loading in faster, or I won't be able to talk about the character on the internet for a few more days.

01:35.320 --> 01:38.320
Well, I guess it's time to run some upgrades.

01:38.320 --> 01:42.320
If you want to follow along, carefully extract the front panel of your personal computer.

01:42.320 --> 01:43.320
Um...

01:43.320 --> 01:44.320
Uh...

01:45.320 --> 01:47.320
Watch for excess Plexiglas!

01:47.320 --> 01:49.320
Remove old video card for future consumption-

01:49.320 --> 01:50.320
Ugh...

01:56.320 --> 02:01.320
The trick to overclocking the GPU is to apply a generous amount of thermal paste

02:01.320 --> 02:03.320
to the broadband...

02:03.320 --> 02:05.320
JavaScript.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.320
Your screen is now fully integrated.

02:10.320 --> 02:11.320
And...

02:11.320 --> 02:13.320
JavaScript.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.320
Ah, that's better. Much faster.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.320
Anyway, Doom-

02:35.320 --> 02:36.320
FUCK!

02:37.320 --> 02:39.320
Doomfist has a very interesting moveset,

02:39.320 --> 02:42.320
and I can't wait to see how it translates over to Blizzard's good game,

02:42.320 --> 02:43.320
Heroes of the Storm.

02:43.320 --> 02:46.320
Overwatch has come under fire for having some characters and abilities

02:46.320 --> 02:49.320
that are highly evocative of Valve's highly popular team-based

02:49.320 --> 02:51.320
multiplayer online first-person shooter,

02:51.320 --> 02:53.320
Hat Loot Box 2,

02:53.320 --> 02:56.320
but Blizzard have finally proven themselves to have their own unique ideas

02:56.320 --> 02:59.320
by adding a guy who can charge forwards very quickly

02:59.320 --> 03:01.320
and deal high amounts of melee damage

03:01.320 --> 03:03.320
and recover health for doing it well.

03:03.320 --> 03:07.320
Well, actually, it's a bit different because Doomfist doesn't really gain health.

03:07.320 --> 03:11.320
He just gains temporary shields to differentiate himself from Reaper,

03:11.320 --> 03:14.320
the close-range character who already gets health for hurting people.

03:14.320 --> 03:18.320
He can also uppercut and hang slowly in the air to get shot to death,

03:18.320 --> 03:20.320
but don't worry, if you're feeling really fancy,

03:20.320 --> 03:22.320
you can wait until right before you die to do it,

03:22.320 --> 03:26.320
and then you can fly away to escape being court-martialed.

03:26.320 --> 03:28.320
Overwatch has been praised for its diverse cast of characters

03:28.320 --> 03:30.320
that avoid playing into stereotypes,

03:30.320 --> 03:33.320
which is false because it contains the most horrific caricature

03:33.320 --> 03:36.320
of any people ever conceived and is deeply offensive

03:36.320 --> 03:37.320
to my culture and heritage.

03:37.320 --> 03:40.320
All these years, I've wondered if racism actually exists,

03:40.320 --> 03:43.320
and I've finally found her.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.320
Trying to crash another party, love?

03:45.320 --> 03:47.320
You don't get to call things love.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.320
Only we get to call things love.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.320
Don't worry, loves. Cavalry's here.

03:51.320 --> 03:53.320
Oh, yeah, stay classy, Blizzard.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.320
Just make fun of our culture

03:55.320 --> 03:58.320
and its inability to move beyond mounted horseback troops.

03:58.320 --> 04:01.320
First, Apple refuses to include a pork pie emoji,

04:01.320 --> 04:03.320
and now this.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.320
Listen, Bethesda, I thought we'd patched things up a bit

04:05.320 --> 04:07.320
since the War of Independence,

04:07.320 --> 04:10.320
but this behavior really just spits on my whippet.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.320
There was no need for this.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.320
I'll see you in whatever the Warcraft equivalent

04:15.320 --> 04:17.320
of, uh, Nuremberg is, but it seems the company

04:17.320 --> 04:19.320
have listened to criticism of their reduction

04:19.320 --> 04:22.320
of people to stereotypes by rounding the current roster out

04:22.320 --> 04:24.320
with a villain who's a tribalistic,

04:24.320 --> 04:26.320
half-naked African man covered in horns.

04:26.320 --> 04:29.320
But he really believes that we as humans get stronger

04:29.320 --> 04:32.320
the more conflict that we endure.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.320
You see, he's called Doomfist,

04:34.320 --> 04:36.320
but he's actually a very deep and interesting character

04:36.320 --> 04:38.320
because he thinks he's right,

04:38.320 --> 04:41.320
unlike all other antagonists in the history of stories.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.320
To voice him, Valve hired Sarn Gauja,

04:43.320 --> 04:45.320
a respected director and actor whose ancestry

04:45.320 --> 04:48.320
reflects the canonical one they had in mind for the character.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.320
But why didn't they let Terry Crews voice Doomfist?

04:51.320 --> 04:53.320
For reasons that can't possibly be systemic,

04:53.320 --> 04:55.320
I only know the name of one black actor

04:55.320 --> 04:57.320
under the age of 50 they could put

04:58.320 --> 05:01.320
Please sign the petition to replace the Doomfist voice actor

05:01.320 --> 05:03.320
and also put back in Tracer's butt

05:03.320 --> 05:05.320
and also remove Tracer entirely.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.320
I was told that John Henry was overpowered,

05:07.320 --> 05:09.320
but I think his addition to the meta is much more nuanced

05:09.320 --> 05:11.320
than that in that he's also rubbish

05:11.320 --> 05:13.320
and needs to be fixed.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.320
Doomfist's punch does feel good to use, though,

05:15.320 --> 05:17.320
and he can even knock his enemy off cliffs

05:17.320 --> 05:19.320
like Lucio, the healer, only he can only do it

05:19.320 --> 05:21.320
to one person at a time, so he's not even

05:21.320 --> 05:24.320
as good a killer as the guy's fucking support class.

05:24.320 --> 05:26.320
I'm really not certain Overwatch needed another attack hero.

05:26.320 --> 05:28.320
We already had Genji Man, High Noon Man,

05:28.320 --> 05:30.320
Justice Ro-ugh!

05:30.320 --> 05:32.320
Ghost Boy, Scythe's Dad,

05:32.320 --> 05:34.320
a racist caricature,

05:34.320 --> 05:36.320
and Sombra, a hacker so powerful

05:36.320 --> 05:38.320
that even your teammates disappear from the game

05:38.320 --> 05:40.320
when you pick her. To be honest,

05:40.320 --> 05:42.320
they could have made him have more health, deal a bit less damage,

05:42.320 --> 05:44.320
and maybe gain more shields from his abilities

05:44.320 --> 05:46.320
and make him a really interesting

05:46.320 --> 05:48.320
new tank-type character

05:48.320 --> 05:50.320
or come up with some other gimmick that makes him function

05:50.320 --> 05:52.320
as a support, like maybe his ult

05:52.320 --> 05:54.320
makes a bunch of Doomfists fly out of his fist

05:54.320 --> 05:56.320
onto your teammates' fists,

05:56.320 --> 05:58.320
and it vastly improves everyone's melee damage

05:58.320 --> 06:00.320
for a few seconds, so you suddenly get everyone

06:00.320 --> 06:02.320
on your team wrecking people with Doomfists

06:02.320 --> 06:04.320
while the character applauds how strong

06:04.320 --> 06:06.320
they've become under his tutelage or something.

06:06.320 --> 06:08.320
Blizzard sold me this free character

06:08.320 --> 06:10.320
with the promise that I'd be invincible

06:10.320 --> 06:12.320
and Tracer would deal an insignificant amount of damage

06:12.320 --> 06:14.320
and then be killed, which is a really good idea

06:14.320 --> 06:16.320
if you ask, you need to patch the game,

06:16.320 --> 06:18.320
Jeffrey. She's doing it again.

06:18.320 --> 06:20.320
This is textbook false advertising.

06:20.320 --> 06:22.320
Someone increase the jurisdiction of the FDA

06:22.320 --> 06:24.320
and then call the FDGA.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.320
So many skins in Overwatch

06:26.320 --> 06:28.320
for the male characters expose one of their nippies.

06:28.320 --> 06:30.320
Activision Lion's Head have one of the most

06:30.320 --> 06:32.320
weirdly specific sociopolitical

06:32.320 --> 06:34.320
agendas ever. I half expect

06:34.320 --> 06:36.320
the next character's shift ability to expose

06:36.320 --> 06:38.320
his nipple even more, and his ult

06:38.320 --> 06:40.320
probably makes them reveal their drop rates

06:40.320 --> 06:42.320
in compliance with Chinese law

06:42.320 --> 06:44.320
and the enemy team dies of starvation

06:44.320 --> 06:46.320
trying to get the new nipple skins in loot boxes.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.320
Oh, speaking of loot boxes, here's two

06:48.320 --> 06:50.320
I forgot to open before he got patched in.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.320
Oh, man, maybe I already got one

06:52.320 --> 06:54.320
of his skins.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.320
Oh,

06:56.320 --> 06:58.320
lovely, all the things that I already had

06:58.320 --> 07:00.320
and they aren't even good things I already had.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.320
Oh, boy, I'm so glad I bought this

07:02.320 --> 07:04.320
instead of Battleborn.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.320
Oh!

07:06.320 --> 07:08.320
It's taking a moment to load in.

07:08.320 --> 07:10.320
It could be the new...

07:11.320 --> 07:13.320
...

07:13.320 --> 07:15.320
...

07:15.320 --> 07:17.320
...

07:17.320 --> 07:20.320
...

07:20.320 --> 07:22.320
...

07:22.320 --> 07:24.320
...

07:24.320 --> 07:26.320
...

07:26.320 --> 07:28.320
...

07:28.320 --> 07:30.320
...

07:30.320 --> 07:32.320
...

07:32.320 --> 07:34.320
...

07:34.320 --> 07:36.320
...

07:36.320 --> 07:38.320
...

07:38.320 --> 07:40.320
...

07:40.320 --> 07:42.320
...

07:42.320 --> 07:44.320
...

07:44.320 --> 07:46.320
...

07:46.320 --> 07:48.320
...

07:48.320 --> 07:50.320
...

07:50.320 --> 07:52.320
...

07:52.320 --> 07:54.320
...

07:54.320 --> 07:56.320
...

07:56.320 --> 07:58.320
...

07:58.320 --> 08:00.320
...

08:00.320 --> 08:02.320
...

08:02.320 --> 08:04.320
...

08:04.320 --> 08:06.320
...

08:06.320 --> 08:08.320
...

08:08.320 --> 08:10.320
...

08:10.320 --> 08:12.320
...

08:12.320 --> 08:14.320
...

08:14.320 --> 08:16.320
...

08:16.320 --> 08:18.320
...

08:18.320 --> 08:20.320
...

08:20.320 --> 08:22.320
...

08:22.320 --> 08:24.320
...

08:24.320 --> 08:26.320
..

08:26.320 --> 08:28.320
...

08:28.320 --> 08:30.320
...

08:30.320 --> 08:32.320
...

08:32.320 --> 08:34.320
...

08:34.320 --> 08:36.320
...

08:36.320 --> 08:38.320
...

08:38.320 --> 08:40.320
...

08:40.320 --> 08:42.320
...

08:42.320 --> 08:44.320
...

08:44.320 --> 08:46.320
...

08:46.320 --> 08:48.320
...

08:48.320 --> 08:50.320
...

08:50.320 --> 08:52.320
...

08:52.320 --> 08:54.320
...

08:54.320 --> 08:56.320
...

08:56.320 --> 08:58.320
...

08:58.320 --> 09:00.320
...

09:00.320 --> 09:02.320
...

09:02.320 --> 09:04.320
...

09:04.320 --> 09:06.320
...

09:06.320 --> 09:08.320
...

09:08.320 --> 09:10.320
...

09:10.320 --> 09:12.320
...

09:12.320 --> 09:14.320
...

09:14.320 --> 09:16.320
...

09:16.320 --> 09:18.320
...

09:18.320 --> 09:20.320
...

09:20.320 --> 09:22.320
...

09:22.320 --> 09:24.320
...

09:24.320 --> 09:26.320
...

09:26.320 --> 09:28.320
...

09:28.320 --> 09:30.320
...

09:30.320 --> 09:32.320
...

09:32.320 --> 09:34.320
...

09:34.320 --> 09:36.320
...

09:36.320 --> 09:38.320
...

09:38.320 --> 09:40.320
...

09:40.320 --> 09:42.320
...

09:42.320 --> 09:44.320
...

09:44.320 --> 09:46.320
...

09:46.320 --> 09:48.320
...

09:48.320 --> 09:50.320
...

09:50.320 --> 09:52.320
...

09:52.320 --> 09:54.320
...

09:54.320 --> 09:58.320
I'm certain my problems with Mob Psycho 100 Punch Man will be solved

09:58.320 --> 10:03.320
when he's been out for more than a few days, and I learn how to play him properly, and the meta gets a hold of him,

10:03.320 --> 10:08.320
and Blizzard inevitably patch and balance him more. But you need to be current to drive engagement with your channel,

10:08.320 --> 10:10.320
so I made the video now.
