00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,100
Blizzard's famous team-based multiplayer online first-person shooter video game has just updated,

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,560
and along with making Zarya's ult capable of actually killing half the roster,

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,600
and forgetting once again to add the very important feature from the trailers,

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,880
where Widowmaker's butt inflates for added aim stability,

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,540
they included a new character, Mr. Doomfist.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,880
The character is well-known in the lore of Overwatch, the...

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,880
ICONIC

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,000
DOOMFIST,

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,240
having appeared in one of the cinematic advertisement trailers,

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,160
and ads for exhibits about him are in the game too.

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:40,840
The name and mantle of Doomfist have been handed down from numerous characters to others in the past.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,840
Apparently Blizzard are so close to running out of names that now several characters just have to share.

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,160
Many players have been asking how long it will take for Blizzard to run out of ideas for good characters,

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,120
and just put him in the game, and the answer was 14-

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,360
Apparently Blizzard didn't do the usual thing they do when they run out of ideas,

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,620
and bring Illidan back again,

17
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,240
and since the character just came out,

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,200
I thought I should play him for the tiny amount of time I could possibly have played him

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,440
in the few days he's been in the game proper, and review him.

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,040
You might think it's intellectually dishonest to analyze a character prior to them getting a chance

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,440
to be fully integrated into the existing metagame of a competitive experience that's been out for over a year,

22
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,320
and to that I say, um...

23
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,320
So Doomfist has a-

24
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,320
Someone has-

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,320
Hold on a sec-

26
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,320
Doomfist has-

27
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,320
Oh...

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
Doomf-

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,320
This is cyberbullying.

30
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,320
Oh, I have to start loading in faster, or I won't be able to talk about the character on the internet for a few more days.

31
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,320
Well, I guess it's time to run some upgrades.

32
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,320
If you want to follow along, carefully extract the front panel of your personal computer.

33
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,320
Um...

34
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,320
Uh...

35
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,320
Watch for excess Plexiglas!

36
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,320
Remove old video card for future consumption-

37
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,320
Ugh...

38
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,320
The trick to overclocking the GPU is to apply a generous amount of thermal paste

39
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,320
to the broadband...

40
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,320
JavaScript.

41
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,320
Your screen is now fully integrated.

42
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
And...

43
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,320
JavaScript.

44
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,320
Ah, that's better. Much faster.

45
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
Anyway, Doom-

46
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,320
FUCK!

47
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,320
Doomfist has a very interesting moveset,

48
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,320
and I can't wait to see how it translates over to Blizzard's good game,

49
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
Heroes of the Storm.

50
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,320
Overwatch has come under fire for having some characters and abilities

51
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,320
that are highly evocative of Valve's highly popular team-based

52
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,320
multiplayer online first-person shooter,

53
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,320
Hat Loot Box 2,

54
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,320
but Blizzard have finally proven themselves to have their own unique ideas

55
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,320
by adding a guy who can charge forwards very quickly

56
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,320
and deal high amounts of melee damage

57
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,320
and recover health for doing it well.

58
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,320
Well, actually, it's a bit different because Doomfist doesn't really gain health.

59
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,320
He just gains temporary shields to differentiate himself from Reaper,

60
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,320
the close-range character who already gets health for hurting people.

61
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,320
He can also uppercut and hang slowly in the air to get shot to death,

62
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,320
but don't worry, if you're feeling really fancy,

63
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,320
you can wait until right before you die to do it,

64
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,320
and then you can fly away to escape being court-martialed.

65
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Overwatch has been praised for its diverse cast of characters

66
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,320
that avoid playing into stereotypes,

67
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,320
which is false because it contains the most horrific caricature

68
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,320
of any people ever conceived and is deeply offensive

69
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,320
to my culture and heritage.

70
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,320
All these years, I've wondered if racism actually exists,

71
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,320
and I've finally found her.

72
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,320
Trying to crash another party, love?

73
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,320
You don't get to call things love.

74
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,320
Only we get to call things love.

75
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,320
Don't worry, loves. Cavalry's here.

76
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,320
Oh, yeah, stay classy, Blizzard.

77
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,320
Just make fun of our culture

78
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,320
and its inability to move beyond mounted horseback troops.

79
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,320
First, Apple refuses to include a pork pie emoji,

80
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,320
and now this.

81
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,320
Listen, Bethesda, I thought we'd patched things up a bit

82
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,320
since the War of Independence,

83
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,320
but this behavior really just spits on my whippet.

84
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,320
There was no need for this.

85
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,320
I'll see you in whatever the Warcraft equivalent

86
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,320
of, uh, Nuremberg is, but it seems the company

87
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,320
have listened to criticism of their reduction

88
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,320
of people to stereotypes by rounding the current roster out

89
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,320
with a villain who's a tribalistic,

90
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,320
half-naked African man covered in horns.

91
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,320
But he really believes that we as humans get stronger

92
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,320
the more conflict that we endure.

93
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
You see, he's called Doomfist,

94
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
but he's actually a very deep and interesting character

95
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
because he thinks he's right,

96
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,320
unlike all other antagonists in the history of stories.

97
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,320
To voice him, Valve hired Sarn Gauja,

98
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,320
a respected director and actor whose ancestry

99
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,320
reflects the canonical one they had in mind for the character.

100
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,320
But why didn't they let Terry Crews voice Doomfist?

101
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,320
For reasons that can't possibly be systemic,

102
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,320
I only know the name of one black actor

103
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,320
under the age of 50 they could put

104
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,320
Please sign the petition to replace the Doomfist voice actor

105
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,320
and also put back in Tracer's butt

106
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,320
and also remove Tracer entirely.

107
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,320
I was told that John Henry was overpowered,

108
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,320
but I think his addition to the meta is much more nuanced

109
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,320
than that in that he's also rubbish

110
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,320
and needs to be fixed.

111
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,320
Doomfist's punch does feel good to use, though,

112
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,320
and he can even knock his enemy off cliffs

113
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,320
like Lucio, the healer, only he can only do it

114
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,320
to one person at a time, so he's not even

115
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,320
as good a killer as the guy's fucking support class.

116
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,320
I'm really not certain Overwatch needed another attack hero.

117
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,320
We already had Genji Man, High Noon Man,

118
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
Justice Ro-ugh!

119
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
Ghost Boy, Scythe's Dad,

120
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,320
a racist caricature,

121
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,320
and Sombra, a hacker so powerful

122
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,320
that even your teammates disappear from the game

123
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,320
when you pick her. To be honest,

124
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
they could have made him have more health, deal a bit less damage,

125
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,320
and maybe gain more shields from his abilities

126
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
and make him a really interesting

127
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
new tank-type character

128
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,320
or come up with some other gimmick that makes him function

129
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,320
as a support, like maybe his ult

130
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,320
makes a bunch of Doomfists fly out of his fist

131
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,320
onto your teammates' fists,

132
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,320
and it vastly improves everyone's melee damage

133
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,320
for a few seconds, so you suddenly get everyone

134
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,320
on your team wrecking people with Doomfists

135
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,320
while the character applauds how strong

136
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,320
they've become under his tutelage or something.

137
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,320
Blizzard sold me this free character

138
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,320
with the promise that I'd be invincible

139
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,320
and Tracer would deal an insignificant amount of damage

140
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,320
and then be killed, which is a really good idea

141
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,320
if you ask, you need to patch the game,

142
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Jeffrey. She's doing it again.

143
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,320
This is textbook false advertising.

144
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,320
Someone increase the jurisdiction of the FDA

145
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,320
and then call the FDGA.

146
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,320
So many skins in Overwatch

147
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,320
for the male characters expose one of their nippies.

148
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Activision Lion's Head have one of the most

149
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,320
weirdly specific sociopolitical

150
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,320
agendas ever. I half expect

151
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,320
the next character's shift ability to expose

152
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,320
his nipple even more, and his ult

153
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,320
probably makes them reveal their drop rates

154
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,320
in compliance with Chinese law

155
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,320
and the enemy team dies of starvation

156
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,320
trying to get the new nipple skins in loot boxes.

157
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,320
Oh, speaking of loot boxes, here's two

158
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,320
I forgot to open before he got patched in.

159
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,320
Oh, man, maybe I already got one

160
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
of his skins.

161
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
Oh,

162
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,320
lovely, all the things that I already had

163
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,320
and they aren't even good things I already had.

164
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,320
Oh, boy, I'm so glad I bought this

165
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,320
instead of Battleborn.

166
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,320
Oh!

167
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,320
It's taking a moment to load in.

168
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
It could be the new...

169
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,320
...

170
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,320
...

171
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,320
...

172
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,320
...

173
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
...

174
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,320
...

175
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,320
...

176
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,320
...

177
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,320
...

178
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,320
...

179
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,320
...

180
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,320

I'm certain my problems with Mob Psycho 100 Punch Man will be solved

251
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,320
when he's been out for more than a few days, and I learn how to play him properly, and the meta gets a hold of him,

252
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,320
and Blizzard inevitably patch and balance him more. But you need to be current to drive engagement with your channel,

253
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
so I made the video now.
