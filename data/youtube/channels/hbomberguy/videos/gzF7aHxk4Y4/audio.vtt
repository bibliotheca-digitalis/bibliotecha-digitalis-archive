00:00.000 --> 00:03.500
The first two Fallouts are still two of the best games ever.

00:03.500 --> 00:05.960
Two of the most engaging worlds and stories

00:05.960 --> 00:07.960
ever crafted for players to explore.

00:10.380 --> 00:12.000
So the developer went bankrupt.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.920
The Fallout intellectual property

00:13.920 --> 00:15.260
was then sold to Bethesda.

00:15.260 --> 00:17.560
There were those who had minor problems

00:17.560 --> 00:19.060
with the direction they took the series.

00:19.060 --> 00:21.940
But when you shoot a guy just right,

00:21.940 --> 00:23.680
his guts go everywhere.

00:23.680 --> 00:25.400
So overall the game did very well.

00:25.400 --> 00:28.820
A lot of people liked Fallout 3.

00:28.840 --> 00:31.440
Then again, a lot of people liked Clerks 2,

00:31.440 --> 00:33.520
so humans aren't really viable as a species.

00:33.520 --> 00:35.560
But then, less than two years later,

00:35.560 --> 00:37.400
Fallout cheated death.

♪ ♪

00:41.900 --> 00:43.620
Developed by Obsidian Entertainment

00:43.620 --> 00:46.120
with a team including people who worked on the original games,

00:46.120 --> 00:48.320
Fallout New Vegas represents everything great

00:48.320 --> 00:50.580
about the original series along with all the good stuff

00:50.580 --> 00:52.040
from 3 that was worth keeping.

00:52.040 --> 00:54.160
In addition to being one of the most incredible games

00:54.160 --> 00:56.000
ever made, it's also really interesting

00:56.000 --> 00:57.840
to talk about from a design perspective.

00:57.860 --> 00:59.020
It's not just a game.

00:59.020 --> 01:01.520
It's a flipping game design doctor,

01:01.520 --> 01:03.440
and it's here to put on a clinic.

01:03.440 --> 01:04.440
I didn't write that line.

01:04.440 --> 01:05.620
It just appeared in the script.

01:05.620 --> 01:06.900
New Vegas is the sort of game

01:06.900 --> 01:08.400
where you can open a manhole cover

01:08.400 --> 01:10.040
expecting, like, a sewer level

01:10.040 --> 01:12.000
and instead discover that the local people

01:12.000 --> 01:14.460
have formed a cult dedicated to blood

01:14.460 --> 01:17.160
and retrofitted the sewers into a fighting arena.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.080
Come on, there has to be a boring quest here.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.540
Okay, the lady who runs this place

01:20.540 --> 01:22.760
wants me to find her some mantis eggs.

01:22.760 --> 01:24.000
Fetch some eggs.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.680
That's gotta be the most boring quest

01:25.680 --> 01:26.840
there could possibly be.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.760
Okay, the eggs are in this abandoned vault.

01:28.760 --> 01:31.400
Great, looking for eggs in some gray corridors.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.400
That sounds...wait, it's overgrown with plants.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.400
And there's environmental storytelling

01:35.400 --> 01:37.020
warning me not to go in?

01:37.020 --> 01:38.740
Oh, man, this vault is cool.

01:38.740 --> 01:40.820
It's overgrown, and there's a bunch of stories

01:40.820 --> 01:42.440
on the computers about the experiments

01:42.440 --> 01:44.120
that went on in there, and it's creepy

01:44.120 --> 01:45.660
and way more visually interesting

01:45.660 --> 01:47.120
than you'd expect a vault to be,

01:47.120 --> 01:48.920
and is that...oh, oh!

01:48.920 --> 01:56.080
♪♪

01:56.160 --> 01:57.700
One of New Vegas' best features

01:57.700 --> 01:59.460
is its ability to make you invested

01:59.460 --> 02:01.160
in its quests and locations.

02:01.160 --> 02:03.380
Vault 22 is one of the many parts of the world

02:03.380 --> 02:05.380
that sounds on paper like somewhere familiar

02:05.380 --> 02:07.500
which then goes out of its way to be completely unlike

02:07.500 --> 02:09.340
you expect in every possible way.

02:09.340 --> 02:11.840
Players of three will already have an intimate awareness

02:11.840 --> 02:13.960
of how vaults can be, having been forced

02:13.960 --> 02:15.640
to walk around in one for an hour

02:15.640 --> 02:17.060
before the game even starts,

02:17.060 --> 02:19.180
and several side quests also take place

02:19.180 --> 02:22.220
in very similar vaults with slightly different aesthetics

02:22.220 --> 02:23.480
and different enemies in them.

02:23.500 --> 02:27.140
Instead of Officer Mac, you get Officer Gary.

02:27.140 --> 02:28.640
Gary!

02:28.640 --> 02:30.060
The most interesting vault in three

02:30.060 --> 02:31.680
is full of people called Gary

02:31.680 --> 02:33.260
who yell Gary at you.

02:33.260 --> 02:35.560
Ha, ha, ha, Gary!

02:35.560 --> 02:36.760
I mean, it's pretty funny.

02:36.760 --> 02:38.440
On a surface level, it's easy to see

02:38.440 --> 02:41.100
why Vault 22 is a more compelling place to explore.

02:41.100 --> 02:42.820
It's a bit nicer to look at with its spots

02:42.820 --> 02:44.940
of overgrowth in the halls and plants everywhere,

02:44.940 --> 02:46.440
the cave network it gives way to

02:46.440 --> 02:47.660
and its more run-down areas,

02:47.660 --> 02:49.080
and it's populated with enemies

02:49.080 --> 02:51.780
unique to this one location called Spore Carriers

02:51.800 --> 02:54.680
which look like humans but creepily hide in foliage

02:54.680 --> 02:57.140
and can't be targeted by V.A.T.S. while they're hiding,

02:57.140 --> 02:58.720
meaning you have to be able to spot them

02:58.720 --> 03:00.680
through their camouflage in order to fight them

03:00.680 --> 03:02.980
which makes them genuinely creepy and, ugh!

03:02.980 --> 03:05.820
And while the unique aesthetic and cool enemies are fun,

03:05.820 --> 03:07.980
what makes Vault 22 a good case study

03:07.980 --> 03:09.520
in Obsidian's design philosophy

03:09.520 --> 03:12.100
is the ways it creates a strong narrative experience

03:12.100 --> 03:14.280
for players and uses its mechanical elements

03:14.280 --> 03:16.860
to enhance player engagement with the story.

03:16.860 --> 03:18.660
Firstly, just for convenience's sake,

03:18.660 --> 03:20.820
the vault can be discovered in more than one way.

03:20.820 --> 03:23.320
Six different quests lead you to this vault.

03:23.320 --> 03:24.560
You don't necessarily come here

03:24.560 --> 03:26.360
looking for those delicious eggs.

03:26.360 --> 03:27.820
One guy wants you to find the secret

03:27.820 --> 03:29.860
of how they're growing all these plants so easily

03:29.860 --> 03:31.980
since, you know, growing plants in the wasteland

03:31.980 --> 03:32.980
is a pretty big deal.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.100
Somewhere on a computer system

03:34.100 --> 03:36.360
in the vault are files on how they managed all this,

03:36.360 --> 03:37.740
but on your way out of his office,

03:37.740 --> 03:39.980
another scientist stops you and says he sent, like,

03:39.980 --> 03:42.740
ten other guys there already and none of them have come back

03:42.740 --> 03:44.100
and asks you to find out what happened

03:44.100 --> 03:45.640
to another researcher who went there.

03:45.640 --> 03:48.060
This is a trick the game pulls often with its quests.

03:48.060 --> 03:49.600
Even something as simple as,

03:49.600 --> 03:51.520
download some files for me, please,

03:51.520 --> 03:53.840
is given extra layers of narrative meaning.

03:53.840 --> 03:56.020
You're actually being sent to a dangerous place

03:56.020 --> 03:57.300
without proper warning

03:57.300 --> 03:58.920
and other people are missing there.

03:58.920 --> 04:01.420
This creates a sense of anticipation to the level.

04:01.420 --> 04:03.140
The vault has tons of computer logs

04:03.140 --> 04:04.380
detailing the work they did,

04:04.380 --> 04:06.100
the events with mind-controlling spores

04:06.100 --> 04:07.920
that led to everyone's death or infection,

04:07.920 --> 04:10.020
and a bunch of new logs left by the researcher

04:10.020 --> 04:11.420
who went missing when she came here,

04:11.420 --> 04:12.880
and because you're actually trying to find out

04:12.880 --> 04:14.560
what happened to the researcher,

04:14.560 --> 04:16.380
it's much harder to ignore the story

04:16.380 --> 04:18.200
that's going on here than it would be otherwise.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.660
The player is also being given mechanical rewards

04:20.660 --> 04:22.420
that really incentivize exploring

04:22.420 --> 04:24.580
and engaging closely with the material.

04:24.580 --> 04:26.740
There's a unique laser rifle you can't get

04:26.740 --> 04:28.700
anywhere else in the game hidden in this vault

04:28.700 --> 04:30.240
on some poor guy's corpse.

04:30.240 --> 04:32.120
The game never draws attention to it.

04:32.120 --> 04:33.820
It's not, like, a reward you get

04:33.820 --> 04:35.240
for beating a boss or something.

04:35.240 --> 04:37.120
It's just hidden in a corner somewhere,

04:37.120 --> 04:38.920
and the genius of this kind of design

04:38.920 --> 04:41.420
is that once players have found something like this once,

04:41.420 --> 04:42.540
they're gonna realize there could be

04:42.540 --> 04:43.620
stuff hidden anywhere.

04:43.620 --> 04:45.660
Suddenly they're paying that much more attention

04:45.700 --> 04:47.700
to the environments that they're traveling through

04:47.700 --> 04:49.860
and partaking more in the stories of the place.

04:49.860 --> 04:51.400
You might not really care that much

04:51.400 --> 04:53.480
about the story of little side quests like this,

04:53.480 --> 04:55.980
but if you know there might be a cool gun in here somewhere,

04:55.980 --> 04:57.280
you're paying a lot more attention

04:57.280 --> 04:58.280
than you might have been.

04:58.280 --> 04:59.860
Some of the quests technically put

04:59.860 --> 05:01.280
an objective marker in the corner

05:01.280 --> 05:02.820
leading you to the necessary part,

05:02.820 --> 05:05.240
but when Vault 22 has worked its magic,

05:05.240 --> 05:06.520
you forget it's there.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.480
The true beauty of great game design

05:08.480 --> 05:10.820
is when all its artificial justifications,

05:10.820 --> 05:13.160
quest indicators, loot to find,

05:13.160 --> 05:15.740
experience points to earn, melt away,

05:15.740 --> 05:18.520
and you really feel like you're in a creepy place

05:18.520 --> 05:19.660
looking for answers.

05:19.660 --> 05:22.060
Eventually you find the researcher is alive

05:22.060 --> 05:24.280
and can help them flood the lower floors with gas

05:24.280 --> 05:25.440
and blow up the spores

05:25.440 --> 05:27.200
so they don't pose a threat to anyone else.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.200
♪ ♪

05:29.200 --> 05:30.860
Good. You survived.

05:30.860 --> 05:33.200
Then she decides to delete the computer records.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.080
The person you optionally saved as a result of exploring

05:36.080 --> 05:39.240
wants to delete the data you actually came here for.

05:39.240 --> 05:40.620
If you already downloaded it,

05:40.620 --> 05:42.620
she asks you to delete your copy too,

05:42.620 --> 05:44.500
so this mistake can't be repeated,

05:44.500 --> 05:46.580
and if you refuse, she attacks you.

05:46.580 --> 05:49.620
Even simple-seeming fetch quests have twists

05:49.620 --> 05:51.960
and the sense of a story you're taking part in

05:51.960 --> 05:53.660
and making choices about

05:53.660 --> 05:55.700
because there's a real moral dilemma here.

05:55.700 --> 05:57.620
Do you really trust this guy with research

05:57.620 --> 05:59.540
that killed a bunch of people already?

05:59.540 --> 06:01.700
We're with the government for goodness sake.

06:01.700 --> 06:03.160
Have a little faith in us.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.580
You have to be good at science

06:05.580 --> 06:07.860
in order to reason out with her that it's probably good

06:07.860 --> 06:10.700
to have a record of the mistake so people don't repeat it.

06:10.700 --> 06:12.500
What could have been a simple fetch quest

06:12.540 --> 06:15.380
to find some data ended in making an ethical decision

06:15.380 --> 06:18.380
about whether the information you found deserves to exist.

06:18.380 --> 06:20.340
The advantages of this design are clear

06:20.340 --> 06:22.700
when you contrast with the Gary Vault in 3.

06:22.700 --> 06:25.000
The enemies are kind of cool for a little while,

06:25.000 --> 06:28.660
but there's no quests or story or choices to make,

06:28.660 --> 06:31.120
so the experience isn't particularly involving.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.340
You don't really have any reasons to be here.

06:33.340 --> 06:35.500
There's a really useful piece of loot in this vault,

06:35.500 --> 06:38.000
a bobblehead that permanently increases your charisma,

06:38.000 --> 06:39.920
and even though it's technically quite hard to miss,

06:39.920 --> 06:41.960
it's just sitting on a table deep in the vault,

06:41.960 --> 06:44.080
getting to it requires trawling through

06:44.080 --> 06:47.040
the rest of a location that has nothing else worth finding

06:47.040 --> 06:50.200
and enemies whose gimmick was wearing thin after Gary 3.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.120
I'm willing to bet most players got bored

06:52.120 --> 06:53.540
and left before they found it.

06:53.540 --> 06:55.120
If you found this, be honest.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.700
You didn't find it because the location was so cool

06:57.700 --> 06:59.700
it made you want to look around and see all of it.

06:59.700 --> 07:01.700
You found it because you were using a guide

07:01.700 --> 07:03.280
to find all the bobbleheads.

07:03.280 --> 07:04.120
Thanks, Carl.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.840
Eventually, players lose interest

07:05.840 --> 07:07.960
in picking through empty buildings

07:07.960 --> 07:09.620
full of locked, easy safes

in case there's something interesting in them.

Meanwhile, Vault 22 isn't even the coolest vault

07:22.120 --> 07:23.120
in New Vegas.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.820
Vault 11 is straight up an incredibly

07:24.820 --> 07:26.440
well-written piece of fiction,

07:26.440 --> 07:28.200
and it's just hiding off in a little nook

07:28.200 --> 07:30.320
waiting for you to be sent there as part of a quest

07:30.320 --> 07:31.400
for the Brotherhood of Steel.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.480
I need you to go on this important quest for me.

Yep, yep, yep, great, great!

I'm going to destroy this faction.

07:38.820 --> 07:41.320
This approach to quest design is all over the place,

07:41.320 --> 07:43.240
offering you very simple and straightforward

07:43.240 --> 07:45.820
seeming things and then pulling the rug out from under you.

07:45.820 --> 07:47.400
Honestly, there are probably too many.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.140
It's at the point where if you happen to pick up

07:49.140 --> 07:51.320
enough cute little bottle caps with stars on them,

07:51.320 --> 07:53.100
you stumble into a quest to discover

07:53.100 --> 07:54.400
a legendary treasure.

07:54.400 --> 07:55.900
You get random encounters with people

07:55.900 --> 07:57.480
murdering each other over them.

07:57.480 --> 07:58.600
After you find your first one,

07:58.600 --> 08:00.320
this guy Malcolm eventually tracks you down

08:00.320 --> 08:01.480
and tells you about the quest.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.900
He's kind of notorious for doing it

08:02.900 --> 08:04.480

08:04.480 --> 08:06.360
You might notice he seems to be at a weird angle

08:06.360 --> 08:07.360
looking down at me.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.520
That's because on this play through,

08:08.520 --> 08:10.140
I was crouching preparing for a fight

08:10.140 --> 08:11.140
when he found me.

08:13.860 --> 08:14.860
Hello there.

08:14.860 --> 08:16.140
It was actually kind of terrifying,

08:16.140 --> 08:17.860
but I admire his dedication.

08:17.860 --> 08:18.980
Now give me the caps.

08:18.980 --> 08:20.240
Yeah!

08:20.240 --> 08:21.820
Okay, I'm gonna be nice about Fallout 3.

08:21.820 --> 08:22.900
There's some good stuff in there

08:22.900 --> 08:24.600
and some of these quests are genuinely good

08:24.600 --> 08:26.600
like when a talking tree asks you to kill it

08:26.600 --> 08:28.720
in spite of its existence bringing people hope

08:28.720 --> 08:31.360
or resolving a dispute between two broken people

08:31.360 --> 08:33.140
masquerading as comic book characters

08:33.140 --> 08:34.260
and harassing a town

08:34.260 --> 08:36.140
or when an old woman asks you to find her

08:36.140 --> 08:39.000
the world's last remaining Stradivarius violin.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.720
A handful of the quests in Fallout 3

08:40.720 --> 08:43.040
end up being genuinely good, funny,

08:43.040 --> 08:44.880
and even touching at times.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.000
If anything, they annoy me in a particular way

08:47.000 --> 08:49.500
because they made me see how amazing a game would be

08:49.500 --> 08:51.540
if it was filled with quests like these.

08:51.540 --> 08:54.620
Ahem, New Vegas is a game filled with quests like these,

08:54.620 --> 08:57.040
but hey, maybe it's a quality over quantity type thing.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.800
I mean, even if you don't like the quests in 3,

08:58.800 --> 08:59.800
at least there's a lot of them.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.180
Obsidian only had 18 months to make New Vegas

09:02.180 --> 09:04.040
so there's no way they could make that many quests.

09:04.040 --> 09:08.240
♪

09:08.240 --> 09:09.240
But hold on.

09:09.240 --> 09:10.900
To really explore what makes the gameplay

09:10.900 --> 09:12.700
in these quests so much more engaging,

09:12.700 --> 09:14.280
we should cover some of the more serious

09:14.280 --> 09:15.580
core mechanical changes

09:15.580 --> 09:17.540
between these supposedly similar games,

09:17.540 --> 09:19.540
and to do that, we should go back to how in the quest

09:19.540 --> 09:22.240
having a high science skill affects dialogue.

09:22.240 --> 09:23.900
Actually, no, we should probably go back

09:23.900 --> 09:24.900
to the beginning of the game.

09:24.900 --> 09:26.240
Ugh, let's just start again.

09:26.240 --> 09:31.240
♪ To the town of Alfre who wrote a stranger one fine day ♪

09:31.240 --> 09:32.900
Get it? It's like a clever reversal

09:32.900 --> 09:34.300
of the chapter in the Fallout 3 video.

09:34.300 --> 09:35.300
Uh, it doesn't matter.

09:35.300 --> 09:37.440
New Vegas' opening, character creation process,

09:37.440 --> 09:39.640
and first area are just the best I've ever seen

09:39.640 --> 09:41.900
a game introduce itself and its core gameplay.

09:41.900 --> 09:43.560
Let's take a look at some of the things it does.

09:43.560 --> 09:45.900
♪ Heartaches by the numbers ♪

09:45.900 --> 09:47.800
Pressing the new game button causes the player

09:47.800 --> 09:49.300
to get shot in the face.

09:49.300 --> 09:50.900
♪

09:50.900 --> 09:52.900
New Vegas seemingly goes out of its way

09:52.900 --> 09:54.800
to begin with the logical opposite

09:54.800 --> 09:57.640
of something as cliche as the main character's birth.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.440
You're then revived by Doc Mitchell

09:59.440 --> 10:01.800
who put you back together after a robot cowboy.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.800
Yes, I said that right. Robot cowboy!

10:03.800 --> 10:05.300
This is the best game ever!

10:05.300 --> 10:06.960
Dug them out of their shallow grave.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.040
The opening gives the player

10:08.040 --> 10:09.800
a deliberate barrage of questions.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.840
What was I shot over? Who was this guy?

10:11.840 --> 10:13.460
What was he saying about a delivery?

10:13.460 --> 10:15.340
Why were the guys with him so differently dressed?

10:15.340 --> 10:17.340
He referred to them as Khans. Who are they?

10:17.340 --> 10:19.200
Or if you've played Fallout 1 and 2,

10:19.200 --> 10:21.000
what are they doing here?

10:21.000 --> 10:23.160
These mysteries are a really compelling hook.

10:23.160 --> 10:25.340
You know how a lot of players ignore the main story

10:25.340 --> 10:27.500
in open world RPGs and go do something else?

10:27.500 --> 10:29.200
That's because the story didn't interest them.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.460
Going in search of Benny and the platinum chip

10:31.460 --> 10:33.400
he shot you for sounds really cool,

10:33.400 --> 10:35.400
so a lot more players are gonna wanna find him.

10:35.400 --> 10:37.120
Even the way Benny talks in, like,

10:37.120 --> 10:39.000
an old 50s Vegas style.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.320
But I ain't a fink. Dig?

10:41.320 --> 10:43.200
The fact he's wearing a cool checkered suit

10:43.200 --> 10:45.000
in the post-apocalypse, all of this stuff

10:45.000 --> 10:46.320
really makes you wanna track him down

10:46.320 --> 10:47.620
and find out what his deal is.

10:47.620 --> 10:49.120
What in the goddamn?

10:49.120 --> 10:51.000
Benny and his motivations and personality

10:51.000 --> 10:52.320
are really cool to learn about.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.460
It helps that he's voiced by Matthew Perry, too.

10:54.460 --> 10:56.500
John Gonzalez, the lead writer for New Vegas,

10:56.500 --> 10:58.360
did a really fantastic job with him.

10:58.360 --> 11:01.000
And while I'm at it, Gonzalez is like an unsung hero

11:01.000 --> 11:02.340
in all the games he works on.

11:02.340 --> 11:04.660
Like, he co-developed the Nemesis system

11:04.660 --> 11:05.660
for Shadow of Mordor?

11:05.660 --> 11:07.340
You know, like, the best thing in that game?

11:07.340 --> 11:09.460
Actual quote from Gonzalez's LinkedIn.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.960
I was the lead story guy on Fallout New Vegas.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.660
Thank you, God.

11:13.660 --> 11:15.540
No, John. Thank you.

11:15.540 --> 11:17.160
Did I just imply that I'm God?

11:17.160 --> 11:19.460
Players are much more likely to actively take part

11:19.460 --> 11:21.000
in a story if they have questions

11:21.000 --> 11:22.340
they actually want answering.

11:22.340 --> 11:24.240
Also, did I mention the robot cowboy?

11:24.240 --> 11:27.200
♪ My ramblin' days were through ♪

11:27.200 --> 11:28.860
Fallout 1 and 2 had the right idea

11:28.860 --> 11:31.100
when character creation was one screen long

11:31.100 --> 11:33.260
and then the game just started right away.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.360
There you are in the world. Have fun.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.900
Try to get further than Ed did.

11:36.900 --> 11:38.560
Granted, the character creation screen

11:38.560 --> 11:41.260
was also evidence Black Isle didn't have a UI designer.

11:41.260 --> 11:43.220
Literally every first time Fallout player

11:43.220 --> 11:46.060
has accidentally named their first character non

11:46.060 --> 11:47.900
because they were supposed to type it into here

11:47.900 --> 11:49.720
but still, they were onto something here.

11:49.720 --> 11:51.460
One of my biggest gripes about Fallout 3

11:51.460 --> 11:53.100
was how long it took to start.

11:53.100 --> 11:55.220
The opening sequence deciding your character's stats

11:55.220 --> 11:56.760
and learning the basics of the gameplay

11:56.760 --> 11:59.160
takes 19 years of in-game time

11:59.160 --> 12:00.600
and honestly, it feels that long

12:00.600 --> 12:02.360
before eventually your father realizes

12:02.360 --> 12:03.860
he's forgotten to do the main quest

12:03.860 --> 12:05.360
and escapes and you go after him.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.660
It's only when you finally leave the vault

12:07.660 --> 12:10.160
that the game properly opens up to be explored.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.560
Fallout New Vegas's opening is as smooth as butter

12:12.560 --> 12:14.060
and not the butter you keep in the fridge.

12:14.060 --> 12:16.560
The butter your parents keep in a little dish by the table

12:16.560 --> 12:18.560
so it's already smooth and melty when you need it

12:18.560 --> 12:19.960
and it's just so spreadable

12:19.960 --> 12:21.060
and every time you visit them,

12:21.060 --> 12:22.560
you make a mental note to get one

12:22.560 --> 12:24.060
but you forget again as soon as you

12:24.060 --> 12:25.160
After the opening cutscene,

12:25.160 --> 12:26.260
you're talking to Doc Mitchell

12:26.260 --> 12:27.260
where you make your character

12:27.260 --> 12:28.460
and then walk outside his house

12:28.460 --> 12:30.260
and bam, the game begins.

12:30.260 --> 12:32.760
Fallout 2 opens by forcing you to complete a dungeon

12:32.760 --> 12:35.060
that's pretty repetitive after the first few times through.

12:35.060 --> 12:37.460
It's one of the few things most people don't like about 2

12:37.460 --> 12:39.760
and players often use mods to skip it entirely.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.060
Can you imagine having, like, a decade of hindsight

12:42.060 --> 12:44.260
on all the criticisms people had of Fallout 2

12:44.260 --> 12:45.760
and then making a game where the opening

12:45.760 --> 12:47.460
is, like, three times as long?

12:47.460 --> 12:49.060
That would be a bit silly, wouldn't it?

12:49.060 --> 12:51.260
Eh, I'm sure they'll learn the lesson for Fallout 4.

12:51.260 --> 12:53.960
♪

12:53.960 --> 12:56.060
The character creation process is really fun too.

12:56.060 --> 12:57.160
You pick your starting stats

12:57.160 --> 12:59.560
through a really cute device called the Vigor Tester

12:59.560 --> 13:01.060
and then you get a psych exam

13:01.060 --> 13:03.460
which involves an honest-to-god Rorschach test

13:03.460 --> 13:04.460
which is just great.

13:04.460 --> 13:05.560
Some players actually modded in

13:05.560 --> 13:06.960
what they saw as options.

13:06.960 --> 13:07.960
That's it. That's all it does.

13:07.960 --> 13:09.760
It lets you pick two bears high-fiving

13:09.760 --> 13:10.860
for one of the images.

13:10.860 --> 13:12.760
22,000 downloads.

13:12.760 --> 13:15.360
Including me, that's definitely two bears high-fiving.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.260
When you get to pick your tagged skills though,

13:17.260 --> 13:18.560
you'll notice the list of skills

13:18.560 --> 13:20.060
is a little different from 3.

13:20.060 --> 13:22.960
Big guns and small guns are missing, for example.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.360
There's just guns now

13:24.360 --> 13:25.360
but in addition to this,

13:25.360 --> 13:27.460
all these skills have much more uses

13:27.460 --> 13:29.460
than they did in the previous games too.

13:29.460 --> 13:32.760
♪ When you say I love you ♪

13:32.760 --> 13:34.660
Okay, look, we all love speech, right?

13:34.660 --> 13:36.460
Kudos to the series for making a video game

13:36.460 --> 13:39.160
where talking was a skill worth putting points into at all

13:39.160 --> 13:40.960
but a problem plaguing Fallout games

13:40.960 --> 13:42.560
since the beginning was that one skill

13:42.560 --> 13:44.260
made you the master of half the game's

13:44.260 --> 13:45.760
main form of interaction

13:45.760 --> 13:47.260
which really wasn't ideal.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.060
Games have tried to section off speech

13:49.060 --> 13:50.660
into different types of speech

13:50.660 --> 13:51.660
but let's be honest,

13:51.660 --> 13:53.360
none of them have really worked.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.060
New Vegas goes for the opposite solution.

13:55.060 --> 13:56.560
It keeps speech as is

13:56.560 --> 13:58.160
while giving other skills

13:58.160 --> 13:59.860
the chance to influence dialogue.

13:59.860 --> 14:01.560
The game is also cleverly using

14:01.560 --> 14:03.160
its opening area, Goodsprings,

14:03.160 --> 14:05.460
to great effect in tutorializing players

14:05.460 --> 14:06.460
about this feature.

14:06.460 --> 14:07.760
The first real quest in the game

14:07.760 --> 14:09.660
is to prepare for an attack on the town.

14:09.660 --> 14:12.160
This quest has multiple optional components

14:12.160 --> 14:14.060
where you can ask the townspeople for help

14:14.060 --> 14:15.360
and each of them needs convincing

14:15.360 --> 14:16.560
using a different skill.

14:16.560 --> 14:17.860
This whole quest is basically the game

14:17.860 --> 14:19.860
showing you how many different ways you can play it.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.360
Like, hey, if you were good at barter,

14:21.360 --> 14:23.160
you could have talked this guy into helping.

14:23.160 --> 14:24.660
All the players who took this quest

14:24.660 --> 14:26.560
know that barter can influence dialogue

14:26.560 --> 14:28.160
and not just how much things cost

14:28.160 --> 14:29.260
and minor spoilers,

14:29.260 --> 14:31.760
barter can be used to beat the final boss.

14:31.760 --> 14:32.760
I'm not even kidding.

14:32.760 --> 14:33.960
That's how many options you have here.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.260
If you want Easy Pete

14:35.260 --> 14:36.760
to share his dynamite with you,

14:36.760 --> 14:38.660
you have to prove you wouldn't blow your head off

14:38.660 --> 14:39.660
if he did.

14:39.660 --> 14:41.860
He doesn't need $10 words to convince him.

14:41.860 --> 14:43.260
He needs you to prove you're better

14:43.260 --> 14:45.860
at throwing explosives than these clowns.

14:45.860 --> 14:47.960
Now that's what I call a...

14:47.960 --> 14:48.960
He blew himself up.

14:48.960 --> 14:50.460
Checks like this for other abilities

14:50.460 --> 14:51.760
are all over the game.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.560
Speech is still really useful,

14:53.560 --> 14:55.560
but conversations are so much more varied

14:55.560 --> 14:57.160
in what they ask of player characters,

14:57.160 --> 14:58.160
and that's great.

14:58.160 --> 14:59.560
Medicine, a skill I ignored

14:59.560 --> 15:01.260
in every other Fallout game,

15:01.260 --> 15:03.760
now unlocks some of the best dialogue options

15:03.760 --> 15:05.060
because it turns out being a doctor

15:05.060 --> 15:07.060
in a post-apocalypse is really, really good

15:07.060 --> 15:08.360
at opening doors for you.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.060
What other game lets you do therapy

15:10.060 --> 15:11.260
at a cannibal chef

15:11.260 --> 15:13.460
until he has a breakdown and quits his job?

15:13.460 --> 15:15.060
Players are more likely to feel like

15:15.060 --> 15:16.760
the type of character they made

15:16.760 --> 15:19.060
had a tangible impact on a conversation

15:19.060 --> 15:21.460
which creates a rewarding sense of control.

15:21.460 --> 15:22.460
On top of all of this,

15:22.460 --> 15:24.460
the way dialogue actually works

15:24.460 --> 15:26.460
has been changed significantly from 3.

15:26.460 --> 15:28.460
In 3, if something required speech,

15:28.460 --> 15:30.860
even if you had the maximum amount of speech,

15:30.860 --> 15:32.460
the game could still randomly decide

15:32.460 --> 15:33.660
you failed the check,

15:33.660 --> 15:35.460
so you could build your character around speech

15:35.460 --> 15:37.360
and still just not get to use it,

15:37.360 --> 15:38.560
or you could build your character

15:38.560 --> 15:39.760
around everything else

15:39.760 --> 15:42.160
and just reload the game until you got it anyway.

15:42.160 --> 15:44.460
In New Vegas, if you have the required skill,

15:44.460 --> 15:45.460
it works.

15:45.460 --> 15:46.460
It just works.

15:46.460 --> 15:48.160
It even tells you if you don't have enough,

15:48.160 --> 15:49.660
and in a choice that someone

15:49.660 --> 15:50.960
should have won an award for,

15:50.960 --> 15:53.660
it gives you a worse line to say as a result.

15:53.660 --> 15:55.060
I really like this because it means

15:55.060 --> 15:57.160
you can pick bad options on purpose

15:57.160 --> 15:58.560
and see what happens. It's great.

15:58.560 --> 16:01.260
Finally, I can role play as a complete loser

16:01.260 --> 16:03.660
because I'm so sick of winning in real life.

16:03.660 --> 16:06.260
So now speech is useful based on how many points

16:06.260 --> 16:07.360
you put into it,

16:07.360 --> 16:09.160
not whether the game decides it,

16:09.160 --> 16:10.760
which makes this character creation

16:10.760 --> 16:13.260
feel way more tangible and substantive.

16:13.260 --> 16:15.360
The points feel like they actually matter.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.460
Right after this comes another big change from 3.

16:17.460 --> 16:18.860
After picking your tagged skills,

16:18.860 --> 16:20.760
you get to pick up to two traits.

16:20.760 --> 16:22.360
Which, well...

16:22.360 --> 16:24.660
These were a really cool feature

16:24.660 --> 16:25.960
in the early Fallout games.

16:25.960 --> 16:27.360
Traits would optionally give you

16:27.360 --> 16:28.860
some kind of interesting bonus

16:28.860 --> 16:30.360
and a downside to go with them.

16:30.360 --> 16:31.660
So you could be a one-hander,

16:31.660 --> 16:33.860
so you're a bit more accurate with one-handed weapons

16:33.860 --> 16:35.260
but a whole lot less accurate

16:35.260 --> 16:36.860
with two-handed ones to compensate.

16:36.860 --> 16:38.660
Some of them were just mild changes

16:38.660 --> 16:40.860
like Bloody Mess, which makes every death animation

16:40.860 --> 16:42.160
always the most violent one

16:42.160 --> 16:43.460
for whatever weapon you were using.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.760
I really love Jinxed,

16:44.760 --> 16:46.560
which vastly increases the amount

16:46.560 --> 16:47.760
of critical failures,

16:47.760 --> 16:49.360
an otherwise pretty rare occurrence

16:49.360 --> 16:51.160
for everyone in the game, including you.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.260
Traits led to vastly different ways

16:53.260 --> 16:55.160
of playing the game right from the outset.

16:55.160 --> 16:57.960
They were a really cool addition to the RPG formula.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.260
Everybody loved them,

16:59.260 --> 17:01.460
and Fallout 3 removed them for no reason,

17:01.460 --> 17:03.160
which was a shame because traits

17:03.160 --> 17:05.560
were the spiciest part of character creation.

17:05.560 --> 17:08.060
They're a chance to make a character worse at something

17:08.060 --> 17:09.460
in exchange for a reward,

17:09.460 --> 17:11.060
and that's a really interesting decision

17:11.060 --> 17:12.060
to give to players.

17:12.060 --> 17:13.160
I really like Four Eyes,

17:13.160 --> 17:14.860
which reduces your perception by one

17:14.860 --> 17:16.360
but you get it back and one more

17:16.360 --> 17:17.760
once you find a set of glasses.

17:17.760 --> 17:18.760
Once you account for that,

17:18.760 --> 17:20.860
it's kind of like getting an extra special point,

17:20.860 --> 17:22.460
but there's also a secret downside

17:22.460 --> 17:23.760
you don't realize at first.

17:23.760 --> 17:25.860
You can't wear glasses with power armor helmets

17:25.860 --> 17:27.460
and stuff like that, so it affects what stuff

17:27.460 --> 17:29.160
you end up wearing later in the game too.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.460
Plus, as a guy who needs to wear contact lenses all day

17:31.460 --> 17:32.760
or he'll fall over and die,

17:32.760 --> 17:34.160
I feel very seen by this trait.

17:34.160 --> 17:35.360
Having that kind of control

17:35.360 --> 17:36.660
over what your character is like,

17:36.660 --> 17:38.360
making them as unique as you want,

17:38.360 --> 17:40.260
is kind of one of the central features

17:40.260 --> 17:41.460
of role-playing games.

17:41.460 --> 17:43.360
What sort of character the player makes

17:43.360 --> 17:45.360
is one of their main forms of expression,

17:45.360 --> 17:46.960
and it's so nice having them back.

17:46.960 --> 17:48.660
One of the traits is Wild Wasteland,

17:48.660 --> 17:50.060
which, actually, let's give it its own.

17:51.560 --> 17:53.860

Didn't. Got killed.

Ha!

18:09.860 --> 18:12.060
This is one of the most important conversations

18:12.060 --> 18:13.260
in the canon of Fallout,

18:13.260 --> 18:14.860
and there's also just tons of silly shit

18:14.860 --> 18:17.260
like randomly happening upon a talking cow

18:17.460 --> 18:19.660
or finding a TARDIS or a crashed spaceship

18:19.660 --> 18:21.860

♪ All of it ♪

18:22.860 --> 18:24.260
Wild Wasteland optionally

18:24.260 --> 18:26.060
makes things a little bit weirder.

18:26.060 --> 18:28.060
If you're serious about role-playing and realism

18:28.060 --> 18:29.160
or just hate fun,

18:29.160 --> 18:30.760
it's nice that you can avoid these things

18:30.760 --> 18:31.960
by not picking this trait,

18:31.960 --> 18:33.360
but it adds a lot of great stuff,

18:33.360 --> 18:35.760
little references and in-jokes and comedic things,

18:35.760 --> 18:37.260
most of which I don't want to spoil,

18:37.260 --> 18:39.460
some of which are too obscure to bother explaining,

18:39.460 --> 18:40.460
but I love it.

18:40.460 --> 18:42.160
It's also really clever to make it a choice

18:42.160 --> 18:44.360
so everyone gets the experience they prefer.

18:44.360 --> 18:45.960
Half of this stuff is so weird

18:45.960 --> 18:47.160
it makes sense it's optional.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.660
Not everyone wants to reenact a Monty Python sketch

18:49.660 --> 18:52.060
in the middle of some post-apocalyptic scavenging.

18:52.060 --> 18:54.160
Am I getting mugged by three old ladies?

18:54.160 --> 18:55.460
Oh, Veronica, no!

18:55.460 --> 18:57.260
Wild Wasteland even references that mod

18:57.260 --> 18:59.960
I mentioned earlier in the game's DLC.

18:59.960 --> 19:01.160
Ah, I love this game.

19:01.160 --> 19:02.660
Anyway, during the early questing

19:02.660 --> 19:04.160
and prepping for the attack on the town,

19:04.160 --> 19:05.160
you're going to level up

19:05.160 --> 19:06.660
and get to choose your first perk,

19:06.660 --> 19:07.660
and by the way...

19:07.660 --> 19:09.860
♪

19:09.860 --> 19:12.260
In his GDC retrospective on the first Fallout,

19:12.260 --> 19:14.960
original creator Tim Cain talks about the impact

19:14.960 --> 19:16.460
of perks on playtesting.

19:16.460 --> 19:17.960
Uh, QA loved that they could make characters

19:17.960 --> 19:18.960
that were different than, like,

19:18.960 --> 19:20.260
the guy sitting right next to him in QA

19:20.260 --> 19:21.460
and they could play the game very differently

19:21.460 --> 19:22.460
because of it.

19:22.460 --> 19:23.760
Here's a game design term for you.

19:23.760 --> 19:24.960
Horizontal progression.

19:24.960 --> 19:27.260
Vertical progression is when the numbers get higher

19:27.260 --> 19:28.760
and, yeah, sure, numbers going up

19:28.760 --> 19:30.960
can be fun and pleasing in its own way,

19:30.960 --> 19:32.460
but giving someone a new power,

19:32.460 --> 19:33.960
a new thing they can do,

19:33.960 --> 19:35.260
is usually way more rewarding.

19:35.260 --> 19:36.460
They actually came up with perks

19:36.460 --> 19:38.760
to give players more to do when they level up.

19:38.760 --> 19:39.960
Brian Fargo took the game home,

19:39.960 --> 19:41.460
played it for a weekend, came back,

19:41.460 --> 19:43.760
and said, I love it except when I go up a level,

19:43.760 --> 19:45.260
skill points aren't enough for me to do.

19:45.260 --> 19:48.260
In other words, according to Fallout's original creator,

19:48.260 --> 19:50.260
perks exist in order to make leveling up

19:50.260 --> 19:53.560
feel more substantive than just putting points into stats.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.560
Pause for effect.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.760
A lot of the perks in Fallout 3

19:55.760 --> 19:58.060
just add more points into stats.

19:58.060 --> 19:59.760
So you level up, you assign your points,

19:59.760 --> 20:02.260
and then, oh, I guess I can put five more points

20:02.260 --> 20:03.560
into science and medicine,

20:03.560 --> 20:06.260
or I can put five points in small guns and repair.

20:06.260 --> 20:09.560
Oh, I can put 15 points into big guns.

20:09.560 --> 20:12.560
That almost makes big guns a feasible skill

20:12.560 --> 20:14.060
that doesn't need deleting from the game.

20:14.060 --> 20:15.860
Do you like when the numbers get higher?

20:15.860 --> 20:16.860
I hope you do.

20:16.860 --> 20:18.060
Could I have a more interesting

20:18.060 --> 20:19.360
form of progression, please?

20:19.360 --> 20:21.060
I mean, let's be fair, there are some good perks

20:21.060 --> 20:22.060
like animal friend.

20:22.060 --> 20:23.060
So certain animals,

20:23.060 --> 20:24.360
even some of the really dangerous ones,

20:24.360 --> 20:25.560
will just hang out with you now

20:25.560 --> 20:26.860
or even defend you in battle

20:26.860 --> 20:28.360
if you take it twice which is cool.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.360
Black Widow and Lady Killer are pretty nice too.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.360
It's certainly better than having five more sneak

20:32.360 --> 20:33.660
and lock pick. Come on.

20:33.660 --> 20:36.360
First off, literally all of the boring perks

20:36.360 --> 20:38.660
have been deliberately removed from New Vegas.

20:38.660 --> 20:42.060
Like, there were so many and they're all gone.

20:42.060 --> 20:43.560
It's like you can tell someone

20:43.560 --> 20:45.860
who knows what they're doing looked at Three's perks

20:45.860 --> 20:47.860
and said, these ones are bad. Take them out.

20:47.860 --> 20:48.860
But here's the thing, right?

20:48.860 --> 20:50.360
New Vegas gets to make its perks

20:50.360 --> 20:52.560
way more interesting and cool

20:52.560 --> 20:55.660
because they've changed the way they're used in the game.

20:55.660 --> 20:58.860
In New Vegas, perks have more demanding requirements

20:58.860 --> 21:00.160
before you can take them.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.360
Meltdown is a ridiculously cool perk

21:02.360 --> 21:04.360
that causes enemies killed with energy weapons

21:04.360 --> 21:06.360
to explode in a burst of damage

21:06.360 --> 21:08.360
which can often cause massive chain reactions.

21:08.360 --> 21:11.860
Okay, that's a bit much to be honest.

21:11.860 --> 21:13.860
This perk is hella horizontal.

21:13.860 --> 21:15.360
Hella. What a great word.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.860
It makes specializing in energy weapons feel amazing.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.660
You're blowing people up left and right.

21:19.660 --> 21:21.660
It's great, but you can only get this cool,

21:21.660 --> 21:25.860
overpowered power if you have 90 energy weapons skill

21:25.860 --> 21:27.660
which is a really steep requirement

21:27.660 --> 21:29.460
especially considering New Vegas gives you

21:29.460 --> 21:31.160
a lot fewer skill points per level

21:31.160 --> 21:34.160
and you only get to pick a perk once every two levels now

21:34.160 --> 21:35.860
which is how it was in the original games too.

21:35.860 --> 21:37.660
That's another thing Three changed for some reason.

21:37.660 --> 21:41.160
Cool perks are a reward for how you built your character.

21:41.160 --> 21:43.160
Players are incentivized to plan ahead

21:43.160 --> 21:45.460
and think about what sort of character they want to make

21:45.460 --> 21:47.160
and what perks they want to end up with

21:47.160 --> 21:48.960
which is intensely engaging.

21:48.960 --> 21:52.460
Only one perk in Three requires a skill as high as 80

21:52.460 --> 21:54.660
and most have no skill requirements at all.

21:54.660 --> 21:56.760
There's a very real sense of progress

21:56.760 --> 21:58.760
to building up a character in New Vegas

21:58.760 --> 22:01.460
because perks add genuinely unique things.

22:01.460 --> 22:03.460
Also, this is a small thing, but in Fallout 3

22:03.460 --> 22:04.760
there was a perk that let you get

22:04.760 --> 22:06.260
some more romantic dialogue

22:06.260 --> 22:07.760
with characters of the opposite gender

22:07.760 --> 22:09.260
so you could play a womanizing man

22:09.360 --> 22:11.260
or a mananizing woman.

22:11.260 --> 22:13.060
It also let you deal 10% more damage

22:13.060 --> 22:14.760
to that gender for some reason.

22:14.760 --> 22:16.060
I'm sure it was unintentional,

22:16.060 --> 22:17.560
but the existence of these perks

22:17.560 --> 22:20.560
implies Bethesda don't think gay people exist

22:20.560 --> 22:22.860
in the Fallout universe which is quite funny.

22:22.860 --> 22:25.560
New Vegas added a same gender version of the perk

22:25.560 --> 22:27.060
so you could play as a gay character

22:27.060 --> 22:28.560
or you could take both which at that point

22:28.560 --> 22:31.060
gave you a 10% damage bonus against almost everyone

22:31.060 --> 22:34.060
and was also a really nice piece of representation.

22:34.060 --> 22:35.560
You were at that point role playing

22:35.560 --> 22:38.060
a bisexual character in a video game.

22:38.060 --> 22:40.860
In 2010, which was super cool,

22:40.860 --> 22:43.360
I should have led with that and not the damage bonus.

22:43.360 --> 22:46.060

New Vegas gives players who like that sort of thing

23:04.860 --> 23:06.560
an option built into the game.

23:06.560 --> 23:08.060
On your way out of the front door,

23:08.060 --> 23:10.360
you're given the choice to use hardcore mode.

23:10.360 --> 23:12.160
It makes stimpacks heal over time

23:12.160 --> 23:14.160
so you can't pause the game and get all your health back

23:14.160 --> 23:15.160
in the middle of a fight.

23:15.160 --> 23:16.160
You have to manage thirst,

23:16.160 --> 23:17.360
hunger, and sleep now.

23:17.360 --> 23:19.560
Companions can die which is terrifying.

23:19.560 --> 23:20.560
Veronica, no!

23:20.560 --> 23:22.860
And even bullets affect your carry weight now.

23:22.860 --> 23:24.160
It really isn't messing around either.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.560
In the middle of a normal playthrough,

23:25.560 --> 23:28.360
I tried turning it on and suddenly I was at three times

23:28.360 --> 23:30.360
my maximum carrying capacity.

23:30.360 --> 23:33.360
I had to drop all this stuff just to be able to move.

23:33.360 --> 23:34.660
Don't look at me like that, Veronica.

23:34.660 --> 23:35.660
It's not littering anymore.

23:35.660 --> 23:36.660
The world's ended.

23:36.660 --> 23:38.960
This little extra optional realism

23:38.960 --> 23:40.660
adds a lot to the experience

23:40.660 --> 23:42.160
for people who like that sort of thing.

23:42.160 --> 23:44.260
I'm personally a really big fan

23:44.260 --> 23:46.660
of when developers add things into games

23:46.660 --> 23:48.760
because they know that people would want them there

23:48.760 --> 23:50.460
and mod them in if they weren't.

23:50.460 --> 23:52.260
Like, people also modded iron sights

23:52.260 --> 23:53.460
into Fallout 3 a lot.

23:53.460 --> 23:55.460
Fallout 3 didn't have iron sights for some reason.

23:55.460 --> 23:56.960
It just zoomed in a bit.

23:56.960 --> 24:01.660
But guess what?

24:01.660 --> 24:03.460
New Vegas has iron sights now. It's great.

24:03.460 --> 24:05.260
In fact, this actually reveals another problem

24:05.260 --> 24:06.560
with Fallout 3's design.

24:06.560 --> 24:08.760
You can't aim down the sights of certain guns

24:08.760 --> 24:10.260
that were made for Fallout 3

24:10.260 --> 24:11.860
because whoever designed them at the time

24:11.860 --> 24:13.860
forgot to put sights on them.

24:13.860 --> 24:16.360
Like, they didn't think about how a person would use them.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.060
Look at the laser pistol, for example.

24:18.060 --> 24:20.060
There's just, like, a nub and a little rail there.

24:20.060 --> 24:21.260
What am I looking down?

24:21.260 --> 24:22.260
Here's the laser rifle.

24:22.260 --> 24:23.560
It's a pretty nice-looking gun,

24:23.560 --> 24:25.260
but it wasn't built with consideration

24:25.260 --> 24:27.260
for how a person would actually use it.

24:27.260 --> 24:28.860
In third person, when you right-click,

24:28.860 --> 24:31.060
the character doesn't aim down sights animation,

24:31.060 --> 24:33.060
but there's no sights there. What is she doing?

24:33.060 --> 24:34.260
Bethesda noticed this too

24:34.260 --> 24:36.060
because they redesigned laser weapons

24:36.060 --> 24:37.560
in 4 to have sights on them.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.060
Another thing people frequently modded into Fallout 3

24:40.060 --> 24:42.360
was the ability to upgrade and modify weapons.

24:42.360 --> 24:43.860
That's a bit of a confusing concept.

24:43.860 --> 24:45.560
Modding in weapon mods?

24:45.560 --> 24:47.760
The base game in New Vegas comes with the ability

24:47.760 --> 24:48.760
to modify weapons.

24:48.760 --> 24:50.260
Now you can upgrade and customize

24:50.260 --> 24:51.260
your equipment. It's great.

24:51.260 --> 24:54.060
Hilariously, one of the mods for the laser weapons

24:54.060 --> 24:55.560
is working iron sights.

24:55.560 --> 24:58.060
This is the weapon upgrade version of a subtweet.

24:58.060 --> 24:59.760
Combine that with the fact there's way,

24:59.760 --> 25:01.260
way more weapons in New Vegas

25:01.260 --> 25:03.760
and different ammo types for the weapons too,

25:03.760 --> 25:06.260
and all of a sudden you have so much more room for choice

25:06.260 --> 25:08.760
in how you build your character and what weapons you use.

25:08.760 --> 25:11.260
Optimized ammo, baby!

25:11.260 --> 25:12.760
Okay, I got distracted there and talked about

25:12.760 --> 25:14.060
a bunch of other stuff,

25:14.060 --> 25:16.060
but that's because New Vegas is so good

25:16.060 --> 25:17.560
at tying everything together.

25:17.560 --> 25:19.060
The opening quest at Goodsprings

25:19.060 --> 25:21.060
is a really well-designed introduction

25:21.060 --> 25:22.560
to the ways the character you've built

25:22.560 --> 25:25.060
and your skills and traits and perks can be used

25:25.060 --> 25:27.060
as you prep for the town's big battle,

25:27.060 --> 25:28.560
and the final thing it has to teach you

25:28.560 --> 25:31.060
is that being the good guy isn't the only option

25:31.060 --> 25:33.060
because you can align yourself with the gang

25:33.060 --> 25:35.060
and help them take over the town instead,

25:35.060 --> 25:36.560
and this gets you cred with the gang

25:36.560 --> 25:37.560
which can really help you out

25:37.560 --> 25:39.060
with a lot of stuff later in the game.

25:39.060 --> 25:41.060
The story is essentially this side quest

25:41.060 --> 25:42.860
in slow motion with larger stakes,

25:42.860 --> 25:45.860
a series of preparations for the second battle of Hoover Dam,

25:45.860 --> 25:47.860
a battle in which you get to choose a side

25:47.860 --> 25:49.360
and recruit others to your cause,

25:49.360 --> 25:51.860
and now even playing through the story the first time,

25:51.860 --> 25:53.560
the player knows what kind of choices

25:53.560 --> 25:55.060
to expect and prepare for.

25:55.060 --> 25:57.860
It's a tutorial, but without telling you it's one.

25:57.860 --> 25:58.860
It's very sneaky.

25:58.860 --> 26:00.060
It's a bit like how in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.

26:00.060 --> 26:01.560
Clear Sky you, what are you doing?

26:01.560 --> 26:02.560
Get your hands off me!

26:03.560 --> 26:06.560
Anyway, now that I've created my ultimate warrior,

26:06.560 --> 26:08.560
I'm ready to march straight north to New Vegas

26:08.560 --> 26:10.560
and have myself a grand old time.

26:10.560 --> 26:11.560
There are some radscorpions in the way,

26:11.560 --> 26:12.560
but that shouldn't be so f-

26:12.560 --> 26:14.060
Oh, they're really resistant to my-

26:14.060 --> 26:15.060
Oh, Jesus!

26:15.060 --> 26:16.060
Ah!

26:18.060 --> 26:19.560
Okay, so to go through this pass,

26:19.560 --> 26:21.060
I just have to defeat these tiny flies.

26:21.060 --> 26:22.060
That should be fine.

26:40.560 --> 26:42.060
Ugh!

26:42.060 --> 26:44.060
Open world games where you can basically go

26:44.060 --> 26:46.060
wherever you want right away are really hard

26:46.060 --> 26:48.560
to give a meaningful sense of pace and challenge

26:48.560 --> 26:50.560
to the point where most developers just give up

26:50.560 --> 26:52.060
and make the game do it procedurally.

26:52.060 --> 26:54.560
So they make enemies scale in damage and weaponry

26:54.560 --> 26:56.560
in accordance with the player's level and so on.

26:56.560 --> 26:58.560
This hopefully results in players being never given

26:58.560 --> 27:01.060
insurmountable obstacles and never being too strong

27:01.060 --> 27:02.560
that everything becomes too easy.

27:02.560 --> 27:04.560
This is an okay solution,

27:04.560 --> 27:06.560
but it's a solution to a problem created

27:06.560 --> 27:08.060
by earlier design decisions.

27:08.060 --> 27:10.060
I think a really useful pointer for this

27:10.060 --> 27:11.560
comes up in original Fallout creator

27:11.560 --> 27:13.560
Tim Cain's GDC retrospective.

27:13.560 --> 27:15.060
He said, we don't care where people can go.

27:15.060 --> 27:16.560
They can go anywhere they want.

27:16.560 --> 27:19.060
If they go into some area that's too strong for them,

27:19.060 --> 27:20.060
they'll get killed,

27:20.060 --> 27:22.060
and then they'll learn not to go in there yet,

27:22.060 --> 27:23.060
and they'll look forward to the challenge

27:23.060 --> 27:24.060
of being able to go back.

27:24.060 --> 27:25.060
In about a sentence,

27:25.060 --> 27:27.560
Cain instantly sums up one of the most important ways

27:27.560 --> 27:29.560
of giving open world games a solid relationship

27:29.560 --> 27:30.560
with the player.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.060
In Fallout 1, you can technically go

27:32.060 --> 27:33.060
wherever you want.

27:33.060 --> 27:35.060
In fact, just west of the starting area

27:35.060 --> 27:36.560
is one of the final objectives,

27:36.560 --> 27:38.560
and you can technically go there right away

27:38.560 --> 27:39.560
and beat half the game.

27:39.560 --> 27:41.060
However, if you try doing that,

27:41.060 --> 27:43.560
you'll probably run into an eight-foot tall mutant

27:43.560 --> 27:46.060
with heavy weaponry who can kill you instantly.

27:47.060 --> 27:51.060
At least I made it further than Ed.

27:51.060 --> 27:53.560
Now, you might call this a horrible way to die,

27:53.560 --> 27:55.560
but I call it good game design.

27:55.560 --> 27:58.060
It creates an immediate and direct relationship

27:58.060 --> 27:59.560
between the player and the environment.

27:59.560 --> 28:02.060
This is a harsh and deadly wasteland

28:02.060 --> 28:04.560
that wants to kill you, and you know this now

28:04.560 --> 28:06.060
because it literally has.

28:06.060 --> 28:07.060
As you get stronger,

28:07.060 --> 28:08.560
these areas become more manageable,

28:08.560 --> 28:10.560
and you get to tangibly feel stronger

28:10.560 --> 28:12.560
because you know how dangerous this is.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.060
Blowing up the super mutant base

28:14.060 --> 28:16.560
after all the times they blasted your body in half

28:16.560 --> 28:19.060
or casually killed your entire party

28:19.060 --> 28:21.060
feels like a real achievement now.

28:21.060 --> 28:24.060
In Fallout 1, finally killing your first Deathclaw

28:24.060 --> 28:27.060
is so satisfying because the first time you meet him,

28:27.060 --> 28:29.060
he ruins you, but hours later,

28:29.060 --> 28:31.060
you're finally ready for more,

28:31.060 --> 28:33.060
and he still kills you because it's Fallout 1.

28:33.060 --> 28:35.060
Try knocking him down first. That usually helps.

28:35.060 --> 28:36.560
Oh, and don't use melee weapons.

28:36.560 --> 28:38.060
This was a terrible idea.

28:38.060 --> 28:40.060
These encounters with Deathclaws and mutants

28:40.060 --> 28:43.060
sound unfair, and yeah, that's the point.

28:43.060 --> 28:45.060
They give players a really textured view

28:45.060 --> 28:46.560
of the game's landscape.

28:46.560 --> 28:48.060
It influences the entire experience

28:48.060 --> 28:49.560
to a tremendous degree.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.560
When the Gunrunners say they're having trouble

28:51.560 --> 28:53.060
getting weapons out to people

28:53.060 --> 28:54.560
because of all the Deathclaws nearby,

28:54.560 --> 28:56.060
you really feel for these guys.

28:56.060 --> 28:58.560
You know in ways that are only possible

28:58.560 --> 29:01.060
for someone who's been killed by one before

29:01.060 --> 29:03.060
just how much it would suck to live nearby

29:03.060 --> 29:04.560
a nest of these things.

29:04.560 --> 29:05.560
That's rough, buddy.

29:05.560 --> 29:07.060
If Deathclaws and mutants

29:07.060 --> 29:08.560
and other tough enemies scaled down

29:08.560 --> 29:10.560
with the player to be largely doable

29:10.560 --> 29:11.560
even at low levels,

29:11.560 --> 29:13.560
Fallout would lose a huge chunk

29:13.560 --> 29:15.060
of what made it so compelling.

29:15.060 --> 29:17.060
Deathclaws would be just another enemy.

29:17.060 --> 29:18.560
This game's sense of harshness

29:18.560 --> 29:20.060
makes it immensely fun to play

29:20.060 --> 29:21.060
because when you win,

29:21.060 --> 29:22.560
it feels like you struggled for something.

29:22.560 --> 29:25.060
People tell me other games are better

29:25.060 --> 29:27.060
and insist Fallout 1 has aged,

29:27.060 --> 29:28.560
but there's just nothing else in games

29:28.560 --> 29:30.560
quite as intense as moving across

29:30.560 --> 29:32.560
the northwestern side of the world map

29:32.560 --> 29:33.560
in Fallout 1.

♪♪

29:37.560 --> 29:39.560
Oh, for fuck's sake.

29:39.560 --> 29:42.060
Fallout 3 broke pretty far from this formula

29:42.060 --> 29:43.060
and that means it's bad.

29:43.060 --> 29:44.060
I'm joking, obviously.

29:44.060 --> 29:45.560
Bethesda just have a different ethos

29:45.560 --> 29:47.060
when it comes to designing worlds,

29:47.060 --> 29:48.560
one which I actually think is quite nice

29:48.560 --> 29:49.560
in its own way.

29:49.560 --> 29:51.560
They want you to be able to go on tour

29:51.560 --> 29:53.560
of their majestically massive maps

29:53.560 --> 29:56.060
and serious spikes in difficulty

29:56.060 --> 29:57.060
would get in the way of that.

29:57.060 --> 29:59.060
I've spoken for an embarrassingly long amount

29:59.060 --> 30:01.560
of time about a game I thought wasn't that great,

30:01.560 --> 30:03.060
but an important thing to remember

30:03.060 --> 30:04.560
is that if you approach it a certain way,

30:04.560 --> 30:06.560
there is fun to be had in 3.

30:06.560 --> 30:08.060
Players who ignored the main quest,

30:08.060 --> 30:09.560
which wasn't that much fun anyway,

30:09.560 --> 30:11.060
and just wandered around dealing

30:11.060 --> 30:12.560
with whatever they happened to find,

30:12.560 --> 30:14.560
doing the occasional quest here and there,

30:14.560 --> 30:16.560
those people basically made their own fun

30:16.560 --> 30:17.560
with the game,

30:17.560 --> 30:19.560
and Fallout 3's open world and dedication

30:19.560 --> 30:21.560
to not making any areas too challenging

30:21.560 --> 30:24.560
even for starting players was especially conducive to this.

30:24.560 --> 30:26.060
You could walk around and go wherever

30:26.060 --> 30:27.060
you felt like going.

30:27.060 --> 30:29.060
Now, you can criticize how this was implemented

30:29.060 --> 30:32.060
or whether it fits a game set in a post-nuclear wasteland

30:32.060 --> 30:34.060
as well as it fits a traditional fantasy world,

30:34.060 --> 30:36.060
but either way, it resulted in a wasteland

30:36.060 --> 30:39.060
and rambling experience a lot of people remember fondly.

30:39.060 --> 30:41.560
I can criticize the story and quests in Fallout 3

30:41.560 --> 30:43.560
until I'm blue in the face, and I did,

30:43.560 --> 30:45.560
but once my lungs recovered and I left hospital,

30:45.560 --> 30:47.560
it didn't stop the fact lots of other people

30:47.560 --> 30:49.060
still had a good time with 3,

30:49.060 --> 30:51.060
wandering around and just checking stuff out

30:51.060 --> 30:52.060
at their own pace,

30:52.060 --> 30:53.560
battling raiders and super mutants

30:53.560 --> 30:55.560
and deathclaws procedurally leveled

30:55.560 --> 30:57.560
to never be too challenging to stop them

30:57.560 --> 31:00.060
in their personal freeform tracks.

31:00.060 --> 31:02.060
Bethesda went for a particular experience

31:02.060 --> 31:04.560
and in a lot of respects, they nailed it.

31:04.560 --> 31:07.060
Despite being built in the same engine as Fallout 3,

31:07.060 --> 31:09.560
New Vegas has an entirely different philosophy

31:09.560 --> 31:11.060
in mind when it comes to its world.

31:11.060 --> 31:13.060
It's a bit more like a classic RPG

31:13.060 --> 31:16.560
like Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale

31:16.560 --> 31:18.560
or, um, uh, Fallout.

31:18.560 --> 31:20.560
It's set in a harsh environment

31:20.560 --> 31:23.060
full of mutants and monsters and it means it.

31:23.060 --> 31:25.560
Cazadors, I've heard some people call them cazadores,

31:25.560 --> 31:27.060
so sorry if I'm saying it wrong,

31:27.060 --> 31:28.560
are super dangerous.

31:28.560 --> 31:31.060
Two of them can pretty consistently go toe-to-toe

31:31.060 --> 31:33.060
with a deathclaw and against humans,

31:33.060 --> 31:35.560
forget it, and they're used in a genius way.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.560
Because they're insects, they make players think

31:37.560 --> 31:39.560
of the incredibly early game bug enemies

31:39.560 --> 31:41.060
from Fallout 3 that died in one hit

31:41.060 --> 31:42.560
like radroaches and bloatflies.

31:42.560 --> 31:44.060
In fact, right before you first meet them,

31:44.060 --> 31:46.060
you pass through an area with bloatflies

31:46.060 --> 31:48.060
to lull you into a false sense of security

31:48.060 --> 31:50.060
and the landscape is perfectly arranged

31:50.060 --> 31:52.060
so when you first see them, they're far away

31:52.060 --> 31:54.060
and you assume they're small and probably weak

31:54.060 --> 31:55.560
considering the nearby enemies.

31:55.560 --> 31:57.060
By the time you get close enough

31:57.060 --> 31:58.560
to realize they're really quite big,

31:58.560 --> 32:01.060
you're already dead because they're about as fast

32:01.060 --> 32:02.560
as the trucks they hit like.

32:02.560 --> 32:04.060
This is the game playing a joke on you

32:04.060 --> 32:05.560
by messing with your expectations.

32:05.560 --> 32:07.060
The other route to New Vegas takes you

32:07.060 --> 32:09.060
through Quarry Junction which has been shut down

32:09.060 --> 32:11.560
because it's been infested with deathclaws.

32:11.560 --> 32:13.060
The first guy you run into there says,

32:13.060 --> 32:15.060
hey, buddy, uh, no.

32:15.060 --> 32:17.060
You'd have to be the meanest, toughest,

32:17.060 --> 32:19.060
roughest bastard in the wasteland

32:19.060 --> 32:20.560
to have any chance against them

32:20.560 --> 32:22.060
and I don't think that's you.

32:22.060 --> 32:24.060
And these aren't Fallout 3 deathclaws.

32:24.060 --> 32:26.560
They're somewhat manageable enemies that scale down

32:26.560 --> 32:28.560
so even at low levels, they're not too hard.

32:28.560 --> 32:30.560
These guys will kill you instantly

32:31.060 --> 32:33.060
and they do not care if you wanted

32:33.060 --> 32:34.560
to do some sightseeing here.

32:34.560 --> 32:36.560
Uh!

32:36.560 --> 32:39.560
Being absolutely obliterated at the start of the game

32:39.560 --> 32:41.560
might seem a little excessive but for me,

32:41.560 --> 32:43.060
it's like being welcomed home.

32:43.060 --> 32:44.560
Tons of areas in the Mojave Wasteland

32:44.560 --> 32:47.060
will happily kill you if you go there unprepared.

32:47.060 --> 32:49.560
You struggle and die and find new equipment

32:49.560 --> 32:51.060
and level up and as you do,

32:51.060 --> 32:52.560
you're given a very powerful sense

32:52.560 --> 32:54.060
of actually getting stronger.

32:54.060 --> 32:57.560
Fallout 3's heavy reliance on level scaling

32:57.560 --> 33:00.060
and deliberately not making enemies too strong

33:00.060 --> 33:02.560
solved the potential problem of players running

33:02.560 --> 33:04.560
into enemies they weren't prepared for

33:04.560 --> 33:06.060
by making everything too easy.

33:06.060 --> 33:08.060
So the player can go wherever they want

33:08.060 --> 33:11.060
but everywhere they go will be roughly the same experience

33:11.060 --> 33:13.560
with little to no sense of danger or challenge.

33:13.560 --> 33:15.560
You can walk up to a guy with a flamethrower

33:15.560 --> 33:17.560
and beat him to death with a baseball bat

33:17.560 --> 33:19.060
even at the very start of the game.

33:19.060 --> 33:21.560
Getting stronger in Fallout 3 honestly sucks.

33:21.560 --> 33:24.560
It makes a game designed to be easy even easier

33:24.560 --> 33:25.560
and after a few hours,

33:25.560 --> 33:27.560
the whole combat system is boring.

33:27.560 --> 33:29.560
No wonder millions of people downloaded the mods

33:29.560 --> 33:30.560
that make it harder.

33:30.560 --> 33:31.560
In New Vegas,

33:31.560 --> 33:33.060
you start out pretty weak and fragile

33:33.060 --> 33:34.560
and this game's raiders are setting up

33:34.560 --> 33:37.560
actual ambushes, hiding in hills with rifles,

33:37.560 --> 33:40.060
utterly tanking the damage of early game weapons.

33:40.060 --> 33:41.560
They're up on the ridge firing down at you

33:41.560 --> 33:43.560
with grenade launchers

33:43.560 --> 33:45.560
and they're setting traps for you on the road.

33:45.560 --> 33:48.560
This one actually got me.

33:48.560 --> 33:51.560
Okay, New Vegas is really amazing at using traps.

33:51.560 --> 33:53.060
Fallout 3 had some good moments with these

33:53.060 --> 33:55.560
but a lot of the time they felt like an afterthought.

33:55.560 --> 33:58.060
Like someone looked at one of the many identical offices

33:58.060 --> 33:59.060
they'd made that day and went,

33:59.060 --> 34:00.560
this needs to be more unique.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.560
Let's put some landmines in the middle of the floor

34:02.560 --> 34:04.060
you can defuse easily.

34:04.060 --> 34:06.060
There.

34:06.060 --> 34:07.060
Level design.

34:07.060 --> 34:09.060
If you have any peripheral vision,

34:09.060 --> 34:13.060
90% of this game's traps are just free landmines and XP.

34:13.060 --> 34:15.060
New Vegas really goes hard on making traps

34:15.060 --> 34:16.560
actually feel like traps

34:16.560 --> 34:18.060
like here with the traffic cone.

34:18.060 --> 34:19.060
I forget about these and get caught

34:19.060 --> 34:21.060
by at least one every time

34:21.060 --> 34:23.060
or two because they're so well placed

34:23.060 --> 34:24.060
that they're difficult to defuse

34:24.060 --> 34:25.560
even if you know where they are.

34:26.560 --> 34:28.060
Welcome to Nevada.

34:28.060 --> 34:30.060
Look at these easy to disarm bear traps.

34:30.060 --> 34:31.060
Oh, fuck!

34:31.060 --> 34:33.060
They're even used for environmental storytelling.

34:33.060 --> 34:35.560
Caesar's Legion are especially clever with their traps

34:35.560 --> 34:37.560
and also immensely evil.

34:37.560 --> 34:39.060
So in areas they've raided,

34:39.060 --> 34:41.560
they're hiding landmines under bodies.

34:43.560 --> 34:44.560
That's morbid.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.560
What's fantastic is the game pauses in menus

34:46.560 --> 34:48.060
so stuff like this can happen.

34:51.060 --> 34:52.060
Oh, fuck.

34:52.060 --> 34:53.060
Okay, ready?

34:53.060 --> 34:54.060
Go, go, go!

34:54.560 --> 34:55.560
No, my bones!

34:55.560 --> 34:57.560
The game is never scared to mess with you.

34:57.560 --> 34:59.060
In a cave, there's a locked gate

34:59.060 --> 35:00.560
which needs 100 lockpick skill

35:00.560 --> 35:02.060
and it has a ton of good stuff inside,

35:02.060 --> 35:04.560
so master lockpickers get some great rewards for weight.

35:04.560 --> 35:05.560
What was that sound?

35:05.560 --> 35:07.560
And what perk did I just get?

35:07.560 --> 35:11.060
That's the perk you get for breaking your limbs 50 times.

35:11.060 --> 35:12.560
Oh, no.

35:12.560 --> 35:13.560
Oh!

35:13.560 --> 35:15.560
The loot boxes and hard lockpick check

35:15.560 --> 35:17.560
distract you completely from the trip wire

35:17.560 --> 35:19.060
attached to a grenade bouquet

35:19.060 --> 35:20.560
hidden right behind the gate.

35:20.560 --> 35:23.060
You can almost hear the level designers laughing at you.

35:23.060 --> 35:24.560
This combined with the willingness

35:24.560 --> 35:26.060
to put tougher enemies in your way

35:26.060 --> 35:28.560
and make regular enemies just a bit more dangerous

35:28.560 --> 35:30.560
and clever gives the world a real feeling

35:30.560 --> 35:32.060
of being unpredictable

35:32.060 --> 35:34.560
and the extra difficulty makes the game way more fun.

35:34.560 --> 35:37.060
You've had a taste of the brick wall now

35:37.060 --> 35:39.560
and it tastes great.

35:39.560 --> 35:42.060
Being hard in places creates meaningful challenges.

35:42.060 --> 35:44.560
It gives the player something to get stronger for.

35:44.560 --> 35:47.060
Finding better guns is especially engaging here

35:47.060 --> 35:49.060
because they might really be the thing

35:49.060 --> 35:50.560
that makes the difference in combat.

35:50.560 --> 35:53.060
I have a mechanical and emotional relationship

35:53.060 --> 35:56.060
with this cool gun with the physics scribbled on the back.

35:56.060 --> 35:58.060
This thing has saved my life in a few situations.

35:58.060 --> 36:00.560
I love him and being deliberately too hard

36:00.560 --> 36:02.560
in some places creates a sense of apprehension

36:02.560 --> 36:05.060
and anticipation for what you'll run into next

36:05.060 --> 36:06.560
and if you'll be able to deal with it.

36:06.560 --> 36:09.060
This is a world where just by the wayside

36:09.060 --> 36:11.560
there's an encampment of really strong robots

36:11.560 --> 36:14.060
you're not ready to take on yet guarding some great loot

36:14.060 --> 36:15.560
you might want to try for anyway

36:15.560 --> 36:17.560
or which you'll want to come back for later

36:17.560 --> 36:19.560
and now you have something to look forward to.

36:19.560 --> 36:21.060
It's important to recognize here

36:21.060 --> 36:22.560
that none of this is really too hard.

36:22.560 --> 36:24.560
Quarry Junction isn't actually blocking you off

36:24.560 --> 36:25.560
in any way.

36:25.560 --> 36:27.060
You can sneak past the Deathclaws

36:27.060 --> 36:28.560
or master the weaponry available to you

36:28.560 --> 36:30.560
in the early game and head right to New Vegas.

36:30.560 --> 36:33.560
It's fairly tough but that's what makes doing it so fun

36:33.560 --> 36:35.060
and feel like a real achievement

36:35.060 --> 36:36.560
and if you can't make it past them right now,

36:36.560 --> 36:38.060
coming back at a higher level

36:38.060 --> 36:39.560
with better equipment and some friends,

36:39.560 --> 36:41.060
collecting their delicious eggs

36:41.060 --> 36:43.560
so the nice lady there can perfect her omelet recipe,

36:43.560 --> 36:45.060
it's just so satisfying

36:45.060 --> 36:48.560
because these Deathclaws started out legitimately terrifying

36:48.560 --> 36:50.560
and not, like, piss easy to kill

36:50.560 --> 36:52.560
even at the fucking start of the game.

36:52.560 --> 36:53.560
Holy shit.

36:53.560 --> 36:55.560
The sense of growth is so staggering

36:55.560 --> 36:56.560
and it feels amazing.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.560
You really feel like the meanest,

36:58.560 --> 37:00.060
toughest, the thing the guy said.

37:00.060 --> 37:02.060
You know for real how tough these guys can be

37:02.060 --> 37:03.560
and still are if you make the mistake

37:03.560 --> 37:05.560
of fast traveling into the middle of an occupied area.

37:05.560 --> 37:07.560
Oh, Jesus!

37:07.560 --> 37:09.560
This is a crunchy, yummy relationship

37:09.560 --> 37:11.560
to have with a game's world.

37:11.560 --> 37:13.560
The early difficult areas and the other spikes

37:13.560 --> 37:15.560
throughout the trip make the Mojave

37:15.560 --> 37:17.560
into a truly curious and eventful place.

37:17.560 --> 37:20.060
You genuinely don't know what to expect

37:20.060 --> 37:21.560
or if you'll be ready for it.

37:21.560 --> 37:23.560
The difficulty of the two shortest paths to Vegas

37:23.560 --> 37:25.560
incentivizes players to take the long way around

37:25.560 --> 37:27.560
which is more manageable and puts you more

37:27.560 --> 37:29.060
on the trail of the man who shot you.

37:29.060 --> 37:31.060
I mean, he's a guy in a suit with a 9mm.

37:31.060 --> 37:32.560
He couldn't even kill you with that gun.

37:32.560 --> 37:34.060
He's not taking Corrie Junction.

37:34.060 --> 37:35.560
Going this way gives you quests

37:35.560 --> 37:38.060
to learn more about who he is and where exactly he's headed.

37:38.060 --> 37:40.060
This also introduces you to the main factions

37:40.060 --> 37:41.560
you'll be dealing with in the Mojave

37:41.560 --> 37:43.060
like the NCR and Caesar's Legion

37:43.060 --> 37:45.060
and it has some companions to help you out.

37:45.060 --> 37:47.060
Thanks for taking a chance on a naive young girl

37:47.060 --> 37:49.060
from California with stars in her eyes

37:49.060 --> 37:51.060
and a pneumatic gauntlet on her hand.

37:51.060 --> 37:54.060
Using challenges only more advanced players

37:54.060 --> 37:55.560
will be able to get past,

37:55.560 --> 37:57.060
the game is giving beginners a strong gameplay

37:57.060 --> 37:59.060
and narrative experience that helps them

37:59.060 --> 38:01.060
get their bearings, get a little stronger,

38:01.060 --> 38:03.560
and learn more of the details of the setting and plot.

38:03.560 --> 38:05.060
And while there are quests leading you

38:05.060 --> 38:07.060
through the main areas on the long way to Vegas,

38:07.060 --> 38:09.060
what's great is you can find these places

38:09.060 --> 38:11.060
without ever needing to follow a quest marker.

38:11.060 --> 38:13.560
To make the journey feel more like a trip

38:13.560 --> 38:15.060
you chose to go on with places

38:15.060 --> 38:16.560
you just happened across on the way,

38:16.560 --> 38:18.560
the developers have used really clever world design

38:18.560 --> 38:21.560
to make its key locations stick out on their own

38:21.560 --> 38:23.560
and naturally attract players.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.560
You can get sent to the RepCon facility

38:25.560 --> 38:26.560
as part of the main quest,

38:26.560 --> 38:28.560
but you might also find it by yourself.

38:28.560 --> 38:30.560
It's a huge rocket silo with a big building

38:30.560 --> 38:32.060
with a model rocket outside.

38:32.060 --> 38:33.560
It's pretty easy to see it from elsewhere

38:33.560 --> 38:34.560
and wonder what it is.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.060
The story directs you to Prim,

38:36.060 --> 38:37.560
but even if you ignore the story

38:37.560 --> 38:38.560
and you're just walking around,

38:38.560 --> 38:40.060
you're gonna see the huge roller coaster

38:40.060 --> 38:41.560
and wanna go see what's up.

38:41.560 --> 38:43.060
The game's just begging you to come in

38:43.060 --> 38:46.560
and look around and find the other robot cowboy.

38:46.560 --> 38:47.560
Yeah!

38:47.560 --> 38:49.060
And when you're in the southern part of the map,

38:49.060 --> 38:51.560
it's hard not to see the giant sculpture

38:51.560 --> 38:53.060
of two rangers shaking hands

38:53.060 --> 38:55.060
and go find the NCR base up there.

38:55.060 --> 38:57.560
Fucking monument.

38:57.560 --> 39:00.060
And almost everywhere you can see the Lucky 38,

39:00.060 --> 39:02.560
one of the most important locations in the game.

39:02.560 --> 39:04.560
The Strip is one of the few places in the world

39:04.560 --> 39:05.560
lit up at night.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.560
It's visible almost anywhere on the map

39:07.560 --> 39:09.560
staring at you, waiting for you.

39:10.060 --> 39:12.060
Oh, mate, where's me platinum chip?

39:12.060 --> 39:13.060
Pfft.

39:13.060 --> 39:14.060
One thing that we learned

39:14.060 --> 39:16.060
by looking at Fallout 3,

39:16.060 --> 39:18.060
they try to make sure that there's always

39:18.060 --> 39:19.560
at least three landmarks visible.

39:19.560 --> 39:22.060
The developers credit Fallout 3 for giving them this idea,

39:22.060 --> 39:23.060
and there are some places

39:23.060 --> 39:25.060
that really do visually stick out well in 3,

39:25.060 --> 39:27.060
like there's Tenpenny Tower, Megaton,

39:27.060 --> 39:29.560
uh, the big boy overlooking Paradise Falls.

39:29.560 --> 39:31.060
Big boy man. I forget his name.

39:31.060 --> 39:33.060
There's definitely some good points of interest here,

39:33.060 --> 39:35.060
but New Vegas really pushes this into overdrive.

39:35.060 --> 39:36.560
Maybe you didn't find Novak

39:36.560 --> 39:38.060
because anyone in your travels

39:38.060 --> 39:39.560
happened to mention Novak.

39:39.560 --> 39:42.560
Maybe you just found a giant model dinosaur

39:42.560 --> 39:44.060
and wanted to see what was up.

39:44.060 --> 39:45.560
Head north toward Novak.

39:45.560 --> 39:47.560
Look for a big dinosaur. Can't miss it.

39:47.560 --> 39:50.060
Dinky the Dinosaur is based on two actual dinosaurs

39:50.060 --> 39:51.060
out in the desert.

39:51.060 --> 39:52.560
Well, not actual dinosaurs. They're models.

39:52.560 --> 39:54.060
There's this one, Mr. X,

39:54.060 --> 39:56.060
and the other one, Dinny the Dinosaur.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.560
It's cute, but it's also inspired

39:57.560 --> 39:59.060
by another real-life location.

39:59.060 --> 40:00.560
Baker on the road to Nevada

40:00.560 --> 40:02.560
is home to the world's largest thermometer.

40:02.560 --> 40:06.060
Here I am in 2019 having a great time.

40:07.060 --> 40:08.060
I mean, what did I expect?

40:08.060 --> 40:09.560
It's literally called Baker.

40:09.560 --> 40:11.060
I know it's named after someone.

40:11.060 --> 40:13.060
So Dinky the Dinosaur also doubles

40:13.060 --> 40:15.060
as the world's second largest thermometer.

40:15.060 --> 40:16.560
Now here's the really clever thing

40:16.560 --> 40:18.060
about making this cool place that sticks out.

40:18.060 --> 40:20.060
This is where you continue the main quest

40:20.060 --> 40:21.560
and find a potential party member.

40:21.560 --> 40:23.560
No, not a building in the same area.

40:23.560 --> 40:25.060
Literally this dinosaur.

40:25.060 --> 40:26.560
If you go inside Dinky,

40:26.560 --> 40:29.560
you'll find either Manny or Boone on guard in his mouth.

40:29.560 --> 40:32.060
Using just clever visual design

40:32.060 --> 40:33.560
by building a cool dinosaur,

40:33.560 --> 40:34.560
the game is saying,

40:34.560 --> 40:36.060
hey, come check this out, pal.

40:36.060 --> 40:37.060
There's some fun stuff here.

40:37.060 --> 40:38.560
Let's talk about how important

40:38.560 --> 40:40.060
this kind of world design is.

40:40.060 --> 40:42.060
Imagine four programmers on the edge of a cliff.

40:42.060 --> 40:43.560
Game design works the same way.

40:43.560 --> 40:48.560
♪ I waited but you must have lost your way ♪

40:48.560 --> 40:52.560
Is there a plane going overhead right as I start recording?

40:52.560 --> 40:54.060
Okay, it's gone. Right.

40:54.060 --> 40:56.060
There's another big problem open world games

40:56.060 --> 40:58.560
that give the player a lot of freedom have to solve.

40:58.560 --> 41:01.060
Your game could have a bunch of great stuff in it

41:01.060 --> 41:02.560
only for players to miss most of it

41:02.560 --> 41:05.060
and get bored and assume there's not much to find.

41:05.060 --> 41:07.060
I call this the onboarding problem.

41:07.060 --> 41:09.060
If players can go anywhere and do anything,

41:09.060 --> 41:12.060
how do you help them find all the cool stuff you made?

41:12.060 --> 41:14.060
While quest markers and railroad-y stories

41:14.060 --> 41:17.060
can help make sure most people find the core stuff,

41:17.060 --> 41:18.560
what about all the side content?

41:18.560 --> 41:21.060
I think a good case study here is Fallout 3

41:21.060 --> 41:23.560
because like I said, 3 has some great stuff in it.

41:23.560 --> 41:24.560
Some of the quests,

41:24.560 --> 41:26.060
the superheroes in Canterbury Commons,

41:26.060 --> 41:27.560
finding a violin for Agatha,

41:27.560 --> 41:29.060
and deciding the fate of the Oasis

41:29.060 --> 41:31.560
are interesting and often meaningful stories.

41:31.560 --> 41:34.060
They're genuinely good quests.

41:34.060 --> 41:36.060
If you can find them.

41:36.060 --> 41:38.060
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

41:38.060 --> 41:40.060
Fallout 3 has some well-designed quests

41:40.060 --> 41:43.060
but its world design leaves a lot to be desired.

41:43.060 --> 41:45.560
Many of its best locations are often strange places

41:45.560 --> 41:48.060
that are hard for players to reasonably find on their own

41:48.060 --> 41:50.560
and in many cases nowhere in the game world

41:50.560 --> 41:52.060
ever tells you about them.

41:52.060 --> 41:54.560
The Oasis is hidden at the far north edge of the map

41:54.560 --> 41:56.560
and obscured by a bunch of rocks.

41:56.560 --> 41:59.060
The only help the player is given in finding this quest

41:59.060 --> 42:00.560
is there's this one weird sniper guy

42:00.560 --> 42:01.560
in the middle of nowhere

42:01.560 --> 42:03.560
with the address on his body if you kill him.

42:03.560 --> 42:06.060
The Fallout wiki insists there are random encounters

42:06.060 --> 42:07.560
that can point you towards it

42:07.560 --> 42:09.560
so the game decides at random

42:09.560 --> 42:11.560
if it's going to show you the cool quest.

42:11.560 --> 42:13.060
There's a really good reason

42:13.060 --> 42:15.060
why most players remember Tenpenny Tower

42:15.060 --> 42:17.060
and that's because A, it's a big tower.

42:17.060 --> 42:18.560
People are gonna find it, and two,

42:18.560 --> 42:21.060
there's a guy in the first location you go to

42:21.060 --> 42:23.560
in the main quest sitting in the corner going,

42:23.560 --> 42:24.560
hey, come over here,

42:24.560 --> 42:25.560
and he tells you about Tenpenny Tower.

42:25.560 --> 42:28.060
Look, just tell people where the fun quests are

42:28.060 --> 42:31.060
or at least don't make finding out about them random.

42:31.060 --> 42:33.060
Canterbury Commons is a tiny town

42:33.060 --> 42:35.060
in the middle of nowhere that's easy to miss

42:35.060 --> 42:37.560
and the most interesting solution to the superhero quest

42:37.560 --> 42:39.560
requires having found a page of text

42:39.560 --> 42:41.060
on a specific computer

42:41.060 --> 42:43.060
in a building on the other side of the world.

42:43.060 --> 42:46.060
At no point does anyone or anything

42:46.060 --> 42:48.060
mention you can do this.

42:48.060 --> 42:50.060
I'm literally gobsmacked.

42:50.060 --> 42:51.060
Ow.

42:51.060 --> 42:53.060
Fallout 3 is a really fun game

42:53.060 --> 42:55.060
to read the wiki about and find out how fun

42:55.060 --> 42:57.060
it might have been if players could find

42:57.060 --> 42:59.060
half of this shit while they were actually playing it.

42:59.060 --> 43:02.060
There's very little onboarding to quests in 3.

43:02.060 --> 43:04.060
The good content, which is in the game,

43:04.060 --> 43:06.060
is effectively hidden from players

43:06.060 --> 43:08.060
unless they happen to run into it

43:08.060 --> 43:09.560
far off the beaten track.

43:09.560 --> 43:11.060
The violin quest is great,

43:11.060 --> 43:13.560
but starting it means finding a secluded house

43:13.560 --> 43:15.060
in the middle of nowhere.

43:15.060 --> 43:17.060
I've discussed this game with friends a lot over the years

43:17.060 --> 43:18.560
and when I bring this quest up,

43:18.560 --> 43:20.560
over half the people I talk to say,

43:20.560 --> 43:22.060
I didn't know about that quest.

43:22.060 --> 43:23.560
The only way to get involved

43:23.560 --> 43:25.560
in one of the best things in the game

43:25.560 --> 43:27.560
is to just happen to stumble onto it

43:27.560 --> 43:29.560
in the middle of a massive wasteland

43:29.560 --> 43:32.060
and a huge portion of players never even knew it was there.

43:32.060 --> 43:33.060
It's such a shame.

43:33.060 --> 43:34.560
Can you imagine making the best,

43:34.560 --> 43:36.560
most heartfelt quest in the game

43:36.560 --> 43:38.060
and discovering the surrounding world

43:38.060 --> 43:40.560
was designed to make it incredibly difficult to find?

43:40.560 --> 43:43.060
Whoever made that quest should be given a gun.

43:43.060 --> 43:46.060
Fallout New Vegas uses a radical new technique

43:46.060 --> 43:47.560
called game design

43:47.560 --> 43:50.060
to ensure that players find all of its cool stuff.

43:50.060 --> 43:52.060
Remember when I said six quests

43:52.060 --> 43:53.560
send you to Vault 22?

43:53.560 --> 43:55.560
That's just the tip of the questberg.

43:55.560 --> 43:58.060
One of the many cool as hell locations in New Vegas

43:58.060 --> 44:00.060
is the Helios One solar power plant

44:00.060 --> 44:01.560
which the player can talk their way into

44:01.560 --> 44:03.560
and initiate a quest to help get up and running

44:03.560 --> 44:05.560
and then get to decide where to send the power.

44:05.560 --> 44:07.560
In addition to being a giant cool building

44:07.560 --> 44:09.560
with a big sign and a huge solar panel array

44:09.560 --> 44:12.060
which is very easy to find just by walking around,

44:12.060 --> 44:14.060
three other quests also take you here

44:14.060 --> 44:16.060
while you're doing them which gives you an opportunity

44:16.060 --> 44:17.060
to find this one.

44:17.060 --> 44:19.060
For example, this guy, Michelangelo at Vegas,

44:19.060 --> 44:21.060
gives you a camera and asks you to take pictures

44:21.060 --> 44:22.560
of some cool signs he's heard of,

44:22.560 --> 44:24.560
a quest which leads you to five locations

44:24.560 --> 44:26.060
including Helios One.

44:26.060 --> 44:28.060
Quests like this are basically the developers

44:28.060 --> 44:30.560
handing you a juicy list of places to go

44:30.560 --> 44:31.560
and stuff to do.

44:31.560 --> 44:33.060
No wiki required, baby.

44:33.060 --> 44:35.060
The game will show you a good time instead.

44:35.060 --> 44:37.060
One of the game's companions, Veronica,

44:37.060 --> 44:38.560
is a member of the Brotherhood of Steel

44:38.560 --> 44:40.060
and if she sees enough interesting things

44:40.060 --> 44:41.060
while traveling with you,

44:41.060 --> 44:43.560
eventually she asks you to help her find some technology

44:43.560 --> 44:45.060
which might help her change the mind

44:45.060 --> 44:46.060
of the Brotherhood of Steel elder.

44:46.060 --> 44:47.560
The computer which points her

44:47.560 --> 44:49.060
in the direction of this tech leads you

44:49.060 --> 44:50.560
to three different places

44:50.560 --> 44:52.060
with their own solutions to the quest,

44:52.060 --> 44:53.560
one of which is Helios One,

44:53.560 --> 44:55.060
and another one, for the record,

44:55.060 --> 44:57.560
is this guy's office where he sends you to Vault 22.

44:57.560 --> 44:59.060
This game's quests,

44:59.060 --> 45:01.060
in addition to being fun and interesting

45:01.060 --> 45:02.560
and often thought-provoking,

45:02.560 --> 45:05.060
are also designed to be found.

45:05.060 --> 45:07.060
This ensures that players get to see

45:07.060 --> 45:08.560
all the fun stuff in the game and,

45:08.560 --> 45:10.060
and this is really clever,

45:10.060 --> 45:12.560
it helps to create the sense of a cohesive world

45:12.560 --> 45:14.060
because going to Helios One

45:14.060 --> 45:16.060
has consequences for other quests.

45:16.060 --> 45:17.560
One group we'll get to later

45:17.560 --> 45:19.060
need to repair their solar panels

45:19.060 --> 45:21.060
and if the player's been to Helios before,

45:21.060 --> 45:22.060
they can mention they've been there

45:22.060 --> 45:24.060
and salvaging some panels from Helios One

45:24.060 --> 45:26.060
becomes an optional solution to the quest.

45:26.060 --> 45:28.060
It creates a cool sense of taking part

45:28.060 --> 45:30.560
in a cumulative and reactive story.

45:30.560 --> 45:32.060
You're being given an alternative solution

45:32.060 --> 45:34.560
to a quest specifically because you have knowledge

45:34.560 --> 45:36.060
of a place with a bunch of solar panels.

45:36.060 --> 45:38.060
I just can't get over how cool it is

45:38.060 --> 45:40.060
that the player is never put in a situation

45:40.060 --> 45:41.560
where they have to find the fun.

45:41.560 --> 45:43.060
You can hardly go anywhere

45:43.060 --> 45:44.560
without learning even more things

45:44.560 --> 45:46.560
to chase up later or picking something up

45:46.560 --> 45:48.060
that comes in handy somewhere else.

45:48.060 --> 45:51.060
It contributes to what's still the most alive feeling

45:51.060 --> 45:52.560
and reactive world there is.

45:52.560 --> 45:54.060
I'm utterly astounded by wha-

45:54.060 --> 45:55.060
Hello there.

45:55.060 --> 45:57.060
Ah! Malcolm, you scared me!

45:57.060 --> 45:59.060
This one random line from an NCR guy

45:59.060 --> 46:01.560
really sums up New Vegas's design philosophy.

46:01.560 --> 46:04.560
It's really hard to miss all of the great locations

46:04.560 --> 46:07.060
and quests in New Vegas and that's wonderful.

46:07.060 --> 46:09.060
The quest you get from visiting the dinosaur

46:09.060 --> 46:13.060
is really cool too or should I say really ghoul?

46:13.060 --> 46:14.060
I shouldn't.

46:14.060 --> 46:15.060
Manny, a guy who has info

46:15.060 --> 46:16.560
on the man in the checkered suit,

46:16.560 --> 46:18.060
won't tell you what he knows until you go deal

46:18.060 --> 46:20.060
with the ghouls at the rep contesting facility

46:20.060 --> 46:22.560
and the ghouls there turn out to be a cool, weird cult

46:22.560 --> 46:24.560
with a bunch of fun characters to deal with.

46:24.560 --> 46:26.560
God, but are you ugly?

46:26.560 --> 46:28.560
It's also pretty challenging in the early game.

46:28.560 --> 46:30.060
It's a great place to get beaten to death

46:30.060 --> 46:31.560
by invisible super mutants.

46:31.560 --> 46:33.060
Helping them finish their rocket

46:33.060 --> 46:35.560
and blast off to their supposed promised land,

46:35.560 --> 46:37.060
making a last minute course correction

46:37.060 --> 46:39.060
so they're more likely to get wherever they're going

46:39.060 --> 46:40.060
before you activate the launch,

46:40.060 --> 46:41.560
or maybe you want to play a fun prank

46:41.560 --> 46:43.060
on your new friends, you little stinker,

46:43.060 --> 46:46.060
is a really fun reward for coming here on its own,

46:46.060 --> 46:48.060
never mind the fact it'll get Manny to help you,

46:48.060 --> 46:50.060
and what makes this feel even more heroic

46:50.060 --> 46:53.560
is the fact that I really was doing them a favor by choice

46:53.560 --> 46:55.560
because you don't have to do this quest

46:55.560 --> 46:56.560
to progress the story.

46:56.560 --> 46:58.560
I mean, you could just talk him into telling you

46:58.560 --> 47:00.560
or pickpocket the information off him

47:00.560 --> 47:03.060
or kill him and get the same information off his corpse.

47:03.060 --> 47:07.560
Or you could just check out his computer in his room.

47:07.560 --> 47:08.560
I love computers.

47:08.560 --> 47:10.560
When a character has a quest for you in New Vegas,

47:10.560 --> 47:12.060
it's always optional.

47:12.060 --> 47:13.060
It's really just an invitation

47:13.060 --> 47:15.560
to take part in a cool quest if you want to.

47:15.560 --> 47:17.060
Hell, even killing all of the ghouls

47:17.060 --> 47:18.560
because you don't want to do their quest

47:18.560 --> 47:21.060
and then coming back counts as far as Manny's concerned.

47:21.060 --> 47:22.560
He just wants the ghouls out of there.

47:22.560 --> 47:25.060
There are so many ways around doing this quest.

47:25.060 --> 47:26.560
Okay, I'm done beating around the bush.

47:26.560 --> 47:28.560
Let's talk about the absurd level of control

47:28.560 --> 47:30.560
the player has over the direction of the story.

47:30.560 --> 47:33.560
But first, don't forget to smash that like button.

47:33.560 --> 47:37.560
♪♪

47:37.560 --> 47:39.560
There's a fairly important character in Fallout 3

47:39.560 --> 47:40.560
called Three Dog.

47:40.560 --> 47:42.060
He has info on where your father went

47:42.060 --> 47:43.560
and to get it, you either have to do

47:43.560 --> 47:46.060
a really boring quest for him or pass a speech check

47:46.060 --> 47:47.560
which you can still fail if you blah, blah, blah.

47:47.560 --> 47:48.560
You've heard this bit.

47:48.560 --> 47:50.560
But something I really like about Three

47:50.560 --> 47:52.060
is that if you kill Three Dog,

47:52.060 --> 47:53.560
this is for demonstration purposes.

47:53.560 --> 47:55.560
Under no circumstances should you kill Three Dog,

47:55.560 --> 47:57.060
before learning what he knows,

47:57.060 --> 47:59.060
the game's main quest updates to say,

47:59.060 --> 48:01.560
uh, all right, find your dad somewhere, I guess.

48:01.560 --> 48:02.560
Good luck!

48:02.560 --> 48:04.560
And you no longer have an objective marker

48:04.560 --> 48:06.560
telling you where to go because you don't know.

48:06.560 --> 48:08.560
This wouldn't be a super great quest to go on

48:08.560 --> 48:10.060
since as previously discussed,

48:10.060 --> 48:12.060
Fallout 3 has a significant problem

48:12.060 --> 48:13.560
showing you where to find things,

48:13.560 --> 48:16.060
but this willingness to let the player mess this quest up

48:16.060 --> 48:19.060
this badly and account for that is still pretty cool.

48:19.060 --> 48:21.560
The sad thing is Three Dog is one of the few characters

48:21.560 --> 48:23.560
in the game that you can do this with.

48:23.560 --> 48:25.060
Some of the Brotherhood of Steel members

48:25.060 --> 48:26.560
right outside his office

48:26.560 --> 48:28.560
are for some reason too important to die.

48:28.560 --> 48:31.060
So if you nuke them all to take their stuff,

48:31.060 --> 48:32.560
a couple of them just get back up

48:32.560 --> 48:34.560
and aren't even hostile toward you.

48:34.560 --> 48:36.060
After all, they need to complete

48:36.060 --> 48:38.060
the main quest for you later.

48:38.060 --> 48:40.060
The Brotherhood of Steel are just too important

48:40.060 --> 48:41.560
for their part of the story to change,

48:41.560 --> 48:43.060
so the game says no.

48:43.060 --> 48:45.060
They're literally fucking invincible.

48:45.060 --> 48:46.560
You can't even...ugh!

48:46.560 --> 48:48.060
I'm having trouble believing I'm the master

48:48.060 --> 48:49.560
of my own destiny here,

48:49.560 --> 48:51.560
and I think this points towards an obvious solution.

48:51.560 --> 48:54.060
Make it possible to kill all these characters.

48:54.060 --> 48:56.060
Give the story ways of accounting for that,

48:56.060 --> 48:58.060
but that would be an absurd amount of work.

48:58.060 --> 48:59.560
Sure, it would be cool to have that level

48:59.560 --> 49:01.060
of control and freedom,

49:01.060 --> 49:02.560
but what sort of game could possibly...

49:02.560 --> 49:04.060
Okay, so in New Vegas, you can kill everyone.

49:04.060 --> 49:06.060
That's right. I didn't just mean you can kill many.

49:06.060 --> 49:07.560
I meant everyone.

49:07.560 --> 49:08.560
Everyone!

49:08.560 --> 49:09.560
Except for children.

49:09.560 --> 49:11.060
You have to wait for them to get older.

49:11.060 --> 49:12.560
Oh, I'm coming for you, MacReady.

49:12.560 --> 49:14.560
One of the game's most impressive achievements

49:14.560 --> 49:17.060
is that even though its story is incredibly well-written,

49:17.060 --> 49:18.560
it's also designed to account

49:18.560 --> 49:20.560
for the player killing anyone in it.

49:20.560 --> 49:23.060
Sometimes the plot does without characters in simple ways

49:23.060 --> 49:25.060
like having notes and diaries on their corpses

49:25.060 --> 49:26.560
in case they die.

49:26.560 --> 49:28.060
Sometimes, though, it's incredibly complicated.

49:28.060 --> 49:30.060
Like, if you kill Caesar, tons of characters

49:30.060 --> 49:32.060
have things to say about his death.

49:32.060 --> 49:34.560
Hey, you're the one who slayed Caesar.

49:34.560 --> 49:36.560
That son of a bitch had it coming.

49:36.560 --> 49:39.060
Wish I could have been there to see Caesar die.

49:39.060 --> 49:40.060
What an asshole.

49:40.060 --> 49:41.560
If we weren't in con territory,

49:41.560 --> 49:43.060
I would kill you where you stand.

49:43.060 --> 49:45.060
Caesar will be avenged.

49:45.060 --> 49:46.560
And his death and the fact you killed him

49:46.560 --> 49:49.060
are even things you can bring up in important dialogues.

49:49.060 --> 49:51.060
Nobody springs back to life

49:51.060 --> 49:53.060
because otherwise the story wouldn't work.

49:53.060 --> 49:55.060
Don't want to do a quest for someone for information?

49:55.060 --> 49:56.060
Fuck him.

49:56.060 --> 49:57.560
Deputy Beagle needs rescuing

49:57.560 --> 49:59.560
before he'll tell you where the man who shot you went?

49:59.560 --> 50:02.560
Nah, that's all right. Good luck.

50:02.560 --> 50:04.560
Don't like the imposing weirdo telling you

50:04.560 --> 50:07.060
how cool the Legion is and then walking off dramatically?

50:07.060 --> 50:08.560
Yeah, he's just too important.

50:08.560 --> 50:10.060
If you shoot him, he takes a knee

50:10.060 --> 50:11.560
and revives after a few seconds.

50:11.560 --> 50:13.560
You can only kill him at the end of a really long,

50:13.560 --> 50:14.560
boring, multi-stage quest.

50:14.560 --> 50:16.060
Just kidding! Fucking blow him up!

50:16.060 --> 50:17.560
He's dead!

50:17.560 --> 50:19.060
He's supposed to come talk to you later

50:19.060 --> 50:20.560
during the main quest and now the Legion

50:20.560 --> 50:22.060
has to send someone else to do it.

50:22.060 --> 50:24.560
The replacement even mentions they had to do this.

50:24.560 --> 50:27.060
Your crimes against the Legion,

50:27.060 --> 50:28.560
including the death of the fearless

50:28.560 --> 50:31.060
Wulpes Inculta are hereby forgiven.

50:31.060 --> 50:33.060
The level of choice you have goes much deeper

50:33.060 --> 50:34.060
than this, though.

50:34.060 --> 50:35.560
Once you make it to Vegas either

50:35.560 --> 50:37.560
by taking the long way around following Benny's trail

50:37.560 --> 50:39.060
or by getting there right away

50:39.060 --> 50:41.560
by being a total badass,

50:41.560 --> 50:44.060
you learn how pivotal the platinum chip Benny stole

50:44.060 --> 50:46.060
is to shifting the balance of power,

50:46.060 --> 50:48.060
and you fall into the multifactional struggle

50:48.060 --> 50:50.060
for control of the Vegas Strip and the Hoover Dam.

50:50.060 --> 50:52.060
Finding out who Benny is and getting

50:52.060 --> 50:54.060
to the new Vegas Strip and meeting its master,

50:54.060 --> 50:56.560
Mr. House, is just act one of the story.

50:56.560 --> 50:59.060
The other two-thirds can play out completely differently

50:59.060 --> 51:00.560
depending on which faction you decide

51:00.560 --> 51:01.560
to align yourself with.

51:01.560 --> 51:03.060
The NCR want to strengthen their hold

51:03.060 --> 51:05.060
on Hoover Dam, recruit some outside factions

51:05.060 --> 51:07.060
to help out, knock House out of the picture,

51:07.060 --> 51:08.560
and gain control of New Vegas.

51:08.560 --> 51:10.560
Caesar's Legion wants to weaken the NCR,

51:10.560 --> 51:13.060
kill House, and take the dam and Vegas for themselves.

51:13.060 --> 51:15.060
Mr. House, the Strip's current owner,

51:15.060 --> 51:17.060
is a libertarian so he wants to lower the age of consent,

51:17.060 --> 51:20.060
wants to turn New Vegas into a proper free economic zone,

51:20.060 --> 51:22.560
and use the chip to make his robot army powerful enough

51:22.560 --> 51:24.060
to kick both factions out.

51:24.060 --> 51:25.560
You can even pick a fourth faction,

51:25.560 --> 51:28.060
none of the above, and use Benny's pet robot,

51:28.060 --> 51:30.560
Yes Man, to hijack Mr. House's plan for yourself.

51:30.560 --> 51:32.560
I mean, Yes Man won't judge you.

51:32.560 --> 51:34.060
Well, he will but he's not allowed to say it.

51:34.060 --> 51:36.560
I'm gonna help you accomplish so much

51:36.560 --> 51:38.060
whether I want to or not.

51:38.060 --> 51:39.560
So you have all these factions prepping

51:39.560 --> 51:41.060
for the Battle of Hoover Dam

51:41.060 --> 51:43.060
and you're here figuring out who you want to side with

51:43.060 --> 51:45.060
but even then, player freedom doesn't end

51:45.060 --> 51:46.560
with the choice of what side to take.

51:46.560 --> 51:48.560
Let's say you're doing the main quest for the NCR

51:48.560 --> 51:51.060
and they ask you to help recruit the Boomers to their cause.

51:51.060 --> 51:53.060
So you go to meet the Boomers and their leader is like,

51:53.060 --> 51:55.560
okay, look, do some stuff for us and we'll think about it.

51:55.560 --> 51:57.060
Ooh, help fix our power generator.

51:57.060 --> 51:58.560
Oh, our solar panel.

51:58.560 --> 51:59.560
Help me get a girlfriend.

51:59.560 --> 52:01.060
Um, find my teddy bear.

52:01.560 --> 52:03.560
Great, yeah, and then you're sitting through a kid

52:03.560 --> 52:05.060
telling you his people's history

52:05.060 --> 52:06.560
and you realize they're just awful.

52:06.560 --> 52:08.060
Like, they're heavily armed reclusives

52:08.060 --> 52:10.060
who want to live in seclusion forever,

52:10.060 --> 52:12.560
viewing everyone different from them as backwoods savages

52:12.560 --> 52:14.560
and whose ultimate fantasy is having the power

52:14.560 --> 52:16.560
to blow up everyone who's foreign.

52:16.560 --> 52:18.560
I wonder if there's some kind of social commentary

52:18.560 --> 52:20.560
going on here with the, uh, Boomers.

52:20.560 --> 52:22.060
You know what? I don't think I feel like

52:22.060 --> 52:23.560
helping these people.

52:23.560 --> 52:25.060
Yeah, that's right.

52:25.060 --> 52:27.060
You can go scorched earth on these fuckers.

52:27.060 --> 52:28.560
You can kill all these people,

52:28.560 --> 52:30.560
annihilate their machines, raid their armory.

52:30.560 --> 52:33.060
You can even tell a tiny child her bear is dead.

52:33.060 --> 52:35.560
No, not Mr. Cuddles.

52:35.560 --> 52:37.060
Wow, that's messed up.

52:37.060 --> 52:39.060
You can do some evil stuff in this game.

52:39.060 --> 52:44.560
♪♪

52:44.560 --> 52:46.060
What's the word with the Boomers?

52:46.060 --> 52:47.560
Have you talked to them yet?

52:47.560 --> 52:49.060
I don't think it's gonna work out.

52:49.060 --> 52:50.060
Sorry. Damn.

52:50.060 --> 52:51.560
I guess we'll just have to do without.

52:51.560 --> 52:53.060
And the main quest continues.

52:53.060 --> 52:55.060
The thread of prophecy isn't severed.

52:55.060 --> 52:57.060
This doesn't make the NCR's quest line impossible.

52:57.060 --> 52:59.560
It just means we don't have that faction on our side.

52:59.560 --> 53:01.060
It's great stuff.

53:01.060 --> 53:04.060
One of the later quests is to make sure

53:04.060 --> 53:06.560
the NCR's president doesn't get assassinated.

53:06.560 --> 53:07.560
Seems to be going pretty well.

53:07.560 --> 53:08.560
I think he's got this.

53:08.560 --> 53:10.560
Oh, shucks.

53:10.560 --> 53:12.060
I forgot about the sniper.

53:12.060 --> 53:13.560
Well, that sucks.

53:13.560 --> 53:14.560
What's next?

53:14.560 --> 53:16.560
The game doesn't make you go back and fix this.

53:16.560 --> 53:19.560
The NCR just continues preparing for the Battle of Hoover Dam

53:19.560 --> 53:21.060
while down a president.

53:21.060 --> 53:23.060
They're not happy about it, but this isn't a fail state.

53:23.060 --> 53:24.060
You can continue.

53:24.060 --> 53:25.560
Doesn't make you look good, though.

53:25.560 --> 53:27.060
Unless, of course, I was working for the Legion

53:27.060 --> 53:29.060
this whole time and I was the sniper.

53:29.060 --> 53:30.560
Ha-ha!

53:30.560 --> 53:32.560
Hold on. I can do better than that.

53:32.560 --> 53:35.560
♪

53:35.560 --> 53:37.060
Oh.

53:37.060 --> 53:39.560
Oh, man, I just love killing the president.

53:39.560 --> 53:42.560
Um, my producer has asked me to remove this joke,

53:42.560 --> 53:45.060
but I don't think she'll sit through the video to check.

53:45.060 --> 53:46.560
But there's another really important element

53:46.560 --> 53:48.060
at play here with the choices you're making,

53:48.060 --> 53:49.560
and this is the thing that makes them fun

53:49.560 --> 53:52.060
in ways I still don't think any other game

53:52.060 --> 53:54.060
ever has come close to achieving.

53:54.060 --> 53:55.060
It's a pretty simple topic.

53:55.060 --> 53:58.560
Uh, human concepts of morality and political theory.

53:59.060 --> 54:01.560
Okay, everyone open your Foucault to page 451.

54:01.560 --> 54:02.560
Ahem.

54:02.560 --> 54:04.060
Video games are like prisons.

54:04.060 --> 54:05.560
♪

54:05.560 --> 54:07.560
The war has arrived at the gates of Hilli...

54:07.560 --> 54:09.560
No, not like that, like in the Friedrich Nietzsche.

54:09.560 --> 54:11.560
The game asks moral questions, okay?

54:11.560 --> 54:13.060
It's fun to be evil sometimes.

54:13.060 --> 54:15.060
Everyone's blown up a Megaton at least once

54:15.060 --> 54:18.060
to see the explosion graphics and then loaded a save

54:18.060 --> 54:19.560
or watched someone else do it on YouTube.

54:19.560 --> 54:23.060
♪

54:23.060 --> 54:24.560
When I was trying to record this scene,

54:24.560 --> 54:28.060
the game crashed twice.

54:28.060 --> 54:29.560
So that's good.

54:29.560 --> 54:31.560
Lots of games let you theoretically choose

54:31.560 --> 54:34.560
to do a bad thing, and it's nice to have the choice,

54:34.560 --> 54:36.560
but be good and be bad

54:36.560 --> 54:39.060
aren't incredibly meaningful decisions,

54:39.060 --> 54:41.560
and when the choice is between a binary good and evil

54:41.560 --> 54:44.560
with maybe a sarcastic or neutral option or whatever,

54:44.560 --> 54:46.560
most people are generally gonna go

54:46.560 --> 54:48.060
with what makes sense in the story,

54:48.060 --> 54:49.560
which is usually just good,

54:49.560 --> 54:52.560
and if they're feeling spicy, sarcastically good.

54:52.560 --> 54:54.060
This isn't just me saying that either.

54:54.060 --> 54:55.560
It's a science fact.

54:55.560 --> 54:57.060
The Mass Effect games, for example,

54:57.060 --> 55:00.060
reported back to Bioware what choices people made,

55:00.060 --> 55:02.060
and according to designer John Ebinger,

55:02.060 --> 55:05.060
92% of players picked Paragon choices,

55:05.060 --> 55:07.060
the goody two-shoes nice guy options.

55:07.060 --> 55:09.060
Lots of players say they went back

55:09.060 --> 55:11.060
and tried the Renegade stuff on later playthroughs

55:11.060 --> 55:13.060
and enjoyed it, but the issue here is not many players

55:13.060 --> 55:15.560
over the course of a normal playthrough saw that choice

55:15.560 --> 55:17.060
and went, yeah, I should do that.

55:17.060 --> 55:19.060
Barely anyone thinks deliberately letting

55:19.060 --> 55:21.060
the entire galactic government die, for example,

55:21.060 --> 55:22.560
is a good idea.

55:22.560 --> 55:25.060
We all kind of know that's the bad thing to do.

55:25.060 --> 55:27.060
So yeah, a handful of players will go back

55:27.060 --> 55:29.560
and see what the consequences of that choice look like,

55:29.560 --> 55:32.060
but in real life, very few people tend to go around

55:32.060 --> 55:35.060
going, I'm gonna be a bad person just to see what happens.

55:35.060 --> 55:37.060
I know it might not seem like that sometimes,

55:37.060 --> 55:39.060
but moral choices in many games amount to

55:39.060 --> 55:41.060
would you like to be good or bad,

55:41.060 --> 55:43.060
which isn't really an interesting question

55:43.060 --> 55:45.060
to be asked and which most players

55:45.060 --> 55:48.060
seem to answer with, uh, good, I guess.

55:48.060 --> 55:49.560
This is a bit of a problem.

55:49.560 --> 55:51.060
If players are being put in situations

55:51.060 --> 55:53.060
where on the whole, most of them are going

55:53.060 --> 55:54.560
to make the same choice,

55:54.560 --> 55:57.060
they're not really being given an interesting choice.

55:57.060 --> 55:59.060
Video games are more engaging when they ask you

55:59.060 --> 56:01.060
something you have to think about.

56:01.060 --> 56:03.060
To give an example, in one quest in New Vegas,

56:03.060 --> 56:05.560
you'll notice the farmers at some NCR-run farms

56:05.560 --> 56:07.560
are complaining about not getting enough water

56:07.560 --> 56:09.560
and at risk of losing their jobs

56:09.560 --> 56:11.060
because they can't meet their crop quotas.

56:11.060 --> 56:13.060
If you look into it, your search leads you

56:13.060 --> 56:15.560
to the parts of New Vegas that aren't run by the NCR

56:15.560 --> 56:17.560
where independent folks have successfully started

56:17.560 --> 56:20.060
a cooperative farm growing their own food

56:20.060 --> 56:22.060
to help support themselves and prevent the NCR

56:22.060 --> 56:24.560
muscling in under the pretense of feeding everyone.

56:24.560 --> 56:27.560
A farm in the Wasteland is obviously a great thing,

56:27.560 --> 56:29.060
especially if you don't like the idea

56:29.060 --> 56:30.560
of the NCR running the place,

56:30.560 --> 56:32.060
but if you do a little digging,

56:32.060 --> 56:34.060
you learn the farm is run with the help of water

56:34.060 --> 56:36.060
someone is siphoning off from the pipes

56:36.060 --> 56:37.560
meant for the NCR farmers,

56:37.560 --> 56:39.560
and the player has the option of telling on them

56:39.560 --> 56:41.060
and having the water cut off.

56:41.060 --> 56:44.060
So what is the actual right thing to do here?

56:44.060 --> 56:47.060
Are you supposed to shut it off and let a farm die

56:47.060 --> 56:49.060
and its people suffer because someone

56:49.060 --> 56:50.560
technically stole the water,

56:50.560 --> 56:52.560
or are you supposed to let the NCR's farmers

56:52.560 --> 56:54.560
not get all the water they were promised

56:54.560 --> 56:57.060
just because you don't want to cut off someone else

56:57.060 --> 56:58.560
who isn't even supposed to be using it?

56:58.560 --> 57:01.060
Also, it's a bit more complicated than I let on

57:01.060 --> 57:02.560
because an NCR soldier had been looking

57:02.560 --> 57:04.560
into the water shortage and went missing.

57:04.560 --> 57:06.560
When you talk Tom Anderson into admitting

57:06.560 --> 57:09.060
he stole the water, he also admits he killed the guy

57:09.060 --> 57:11.560
when he found out to try to cover up the theft.

57:11.560 --> 57:13.560
Turning him in for his crime means the water

57:13.560 --> 57:15.060
will be cut off for sure,

57:15.060 --> 57:16.560
and West Side will suffer greatly.

57:16.560 --> 57:19.560
The worst thing is, Anderson clearly regrets doing it,

57:19.560 --> 57:22.060
and if you turn him in for this, it'll all be for nothing.

57:22.060 --> 57:24.060
Alternatively, you can cover up the death

57:24.060 --> 57:26.560
and pin it on a gang, but this means a murder

57:26.560 --> 57:29.560
is never brought to justice, and if you do this,

57:29.560 --> 57:31.560
later one of their farmers tells you he's heading back

57:31.560 --> 57:33.560
to California because he's about to be fired

57:33.560 --> 57:36.060
for not meeting a quota he can't possibly meet

57:36.060 --> 57:37.560
with the water he's getting.

57:37.560 --> 57:39.560
Trying to help the people who need it more

57:39.560 --> 57:42.060
ruins several other people and requires you

57:42.060 --> 57:43.560
to help cover up a murder.

57:43.560 --> 57:45.560
Even if a person decides what they think

57:45.560 --> 57:47.560
is the right thing to do here, they still have to live

57:47.560 --> 57:50.060
with the people who get hurt as a result of that choice,

57:50.060 --> 57:52.060
and I'm sure there are players who think

57:52.060 --> 57:54.060
they know the objectively correct thing

57:54.060 --> 57:56.060
to do about the water in this situation,

57:56.060 --> 57:58.060
but the point here is not everyone

57:58.060 --> 57:59.560
will agree on what that is.

57:59.560 --> 58:01.560
You as a person have to choose

58:01.560 --> 58:04.060
what you believe is the right thing to do.

58:04.060 --> 58:06.560
This is incredibly involving because it makes

58:06.560 --> 58:08.560
the player actually think about the world

58:08.560 --> 58:10.060
and their impact on it.

58:10.060 --> 58:12.060
There's no huge far-reaching consequences

58:12.060 --> 58:13.560
for this decision like the death

58:13.560 --> 58:15.060
of a town you could have visited.

58:15.060 --> 58:17.060
There's no secret better solution as a reward

58:17.060 --> 58:20.060
for happening to visit the one computer in the world

58:20.060 --> 58:21.560
with relevant info on it.

58:21.560 --> 58:23.060
The game doesn't need gimmicks like this

58:23.060 --> 58:25.060
to make the quest engage with players

58:25.060 --> 58:28.060
because at its core is a really interesting question

58:28.060 --> 58:30.560
which requires the player to decide for themselves

58:30.560 --> 58:32.060
what the right thing is.

58:32.060 --> 58:34.560
This is more than a chance to be good or bad

58:34.560 --> 58:36.060
and see what happens.

58:36.060 --> 58:37.560
It's an opportunity to figure out

58:37.560 --> 58:40.560
how you would really act in a situation like this,

58:40.560 --> 58:42.060
and questions like this are happening

58:42.060 --> 58:43.560
on a constant basis here.

58:43.560 --> 58:46.560
Is it a good idea to preserve incredibly dangerous

58:46.560 --> 58:48.060
but potentially useful research

58:48.060 --> 58:49.060
by putting it in the hands

58:49.060 --> 58:50.560
of a self-interested politician?

58:50.560 --> 58:52.560
Who should receive the power from Helios I

58:52.560 --> 58:54.060
if you get it up and running?

58:54.060 --> 58:55.560
The people who need it most?

58:55.560 --> 58:57.560
The people the NCR tells you to give it to?

58:57.560 --> 58:59.560
Or maybe everyone should get a little bit

58:59.560 --> 59:01.560
but not really enough to help anyone.

59:01.560 --> 59:04.060
There's even a really tantalizing selfish choice.

59:04.060 --> 59:07.060
A kid on the streets of Vegas sells you a toy gun he found,

59:07.060 --> 59:08.060
and if you're paying attention,

59:08.060 --> 59:09.560
the gun is actually the targeting system

59:09.560 --> 59:13.060
for an orbital laser which you can power instead.

59:13.060 --> 59:14.560
So now you can do this.

59:14.560 --> 59:18.560
♪

59:18.560 --> 59:19.560
Boom!

59:19.560 --> 59:21.060
Ha ha ha ha!

59:21.060 --> 59:22.560
Half the country has no electricity.

59:22.560 --> 59:24.560
Euclid's Seed Finder is such a great weapon.

59:24.560 --> 59:25.560
I love it so much.

59:25.560 --> 59:27.060
It comes in really, really handy.

59:27.060 --> 59:28.560
It's great for taking out huge hordes of dea-

59:28.560 --> 59:30.060
Come on, come on, oh!

59:30.060 --> 59:32.560
♪

59:32.560 --> 59:34.060
Ha ha ha ha!

59:34.060 --> 59:36.060
I utterly love the game's ability

59:36.060 --> 59:38.060
to give you the freedom to do whatever you want

59:38.060 --> 59:40.560
including just killing everyone in the wasteland

59:40.560 --> 59:42.560
and being done with any sort

59:42.560 --> 59:44.060
of traditional questing whatsoever,

59:44.060 --> 59:47.060
but simultaneously offers a story experience

59:47.060 --> 59:49.060
to its quests that leaves room for you

59:49.060 --> 59:51.060
to figure out what's right to you.

59:51.060 --> 59:53.060
When the NCR tell you to recruit the Boomers

59:53.060 --> 59:55.060
and you meet them and they're a bunch of messed up weirdos

59:55.060 --> 59:57.060
who all pretend to remember Woodstock

59:57.060 --> 59:58.560
even though none of them actually went,

59:58.560 --> 01:00:00.560
you have to ask yourself if you think

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.060
recruiting them is a good idea.

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:04.560
Is their help worth getting their facilities

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.060
back up and running and getting them a weapon

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:08.060
capable of realizing their vision?

01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:10.560
Or is this compromise necessary for the greater good?

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.560
Or could working with the NCR give them a chance

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:15.060
to open up and develop a healthier relationship

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:17.060
with the outside world because doing quests for them

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:19.060
isn't the only option to progress the story.

01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:21.060
You have plenty of chances to ask yourself

01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:22.560
how you want to deal with them.

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.060
Well, spoilers, this is footage

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:26.060
from my evil Legion playthrough.

01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:28.560
They don't give a shit what faction you're aligned with.

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.060
Once you do a few things for them,

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:32.560
they'll work with NCR or the Legion if you ask.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:35.060
Sure, we'll depose a democratically elected government.

01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:36.560
It's basically all we do,

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:38.560
but first how do I change the wallpaper on my phone?

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:41.060
Later the NCR tell you to wipe out the Great Khans.

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:43.060
The Khans are a nuisance to the NCR

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.560
and have an allegiance with Caesar,

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.060
but it's a shaky one.

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:48.060
If you know the Legion, you know the main thing they do

01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:50.560
is conquer other tribes and annihilate their identities

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.560
so you can start talking their leadership

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.060
into not wanting to work with Caesar.

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:56.060
The fact you can use pretty simple diplomacy

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:58.060
to get the Khans to change their minds

01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:00.060
is a pretty serious criticism of the NCR.

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:02.060
I mean, they just asked you to kill them all for them.

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:04.060
They're basically an organized family

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:05.560
of drug-dealing raiders,

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:08.060
but does that mean it's okay to wipe them all out?

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:10.060
Will you do what the NCR wants

01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:11.560
to help them hold the Hoover Dam?

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:14.560
And in the big picture, which faction should you side with?

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.060
What's the right answer?

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:17.560
I think the degree to which these questions

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:19.060
are compelling is evident

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:20.560
in how much longevity they've had.

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:22.560
I've seen people argue online for a decade now

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.060
that the independent route

01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:25.560
is the only morally good option,

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:28.060
and I've also seen others say those people

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:30.060
are naive and doomed to be destroyed

01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:32.060
by the much larger factions,

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:34.560
and it's better to do your best to support the NCR

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.060
and try to help them improve

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:37.560
because there's no other suitable

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.060
long-term power structure,

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.060
and for all their problems,

01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:41.560
pissing them off and going rogue

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:44.060
is not a real solution to the fact you don't like them.

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.560
Arguments about sides in this struggle

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.060
are often deeply heated

01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:49.560
because they tie into people's actual understandings

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:51.060
of the world around them,

01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:52.560
their socio-political beliefs,

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:54.560
and their personal sense of pragmatism.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.060
Being questioned on these levels by a computer game

01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:59.560
is basically still largely unheard of.

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:01.560
The rare occasions a game really goes

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:03.060
for exploring these ideas,

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:04.560
it sweeps the game awards

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:06.060
and instantly becomes a modern classic.

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:08.060
Meanwhile, other games are still in the paddling pool

01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:11.060
of, like, oh, was it bad to murder a bunch of people

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.060
with a knife?

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:13.060
A lot of people think politics

01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:14.560
can be a turn-off for gamers,

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.060
but I've done some research and discovered

01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:18.060
that politics is objectively fun

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:20.060
and all gamers love it all the time,

01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:21.560
and the people who say they hate seeing them in games

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.560
actually love politics even more.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:25.560
They just wish they were seeing different politics.

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.060
This might just be my opinion,

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.560
but I think it's good when video games

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:31.060
are about something and have ideas.

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:33.560
No one's going to rethink any aspect of their life

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:36.560
because of the story of Uncharted sponsored by Subway.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.060
There's a reason why the best narrative games

01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:40.560
are made by people who take big ideas seriously enough

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:42.060
to actually reckon with them.

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:43.560
The kind of people badass enough

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.560
to name drop Marx and Engels in their victory speech.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:49.060
And Marx and Engels for providing us

01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:50.560
the political education.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:51.560
Thank you.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:52.560
Thank you.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.560
Thank you.

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:55.060
You don't see stuff like that normally

01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:57.060
at hashtag the game awards.

01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:58.560
Also sponsored by Subway.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.060
Fresh indie game presented by Subway.

01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:02.560
Fresh indie game?

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:04.060
More like eat fresh indie.

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:05.560
Ah, fucking slit my throat.

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.560
Clear cut.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.060
Wow, can you tell I'm from Yorkshire?

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:11.060
Clear cut good versus evil choices are easy

01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:12.560
and require little to no thinking.

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:15.560
So no matter how fun it is to be evil in your game

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.060
or how nice it feels to be good,

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:19.560
the moral decision itself isn't engaging.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:20.560
When you give someone a choice

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.560
where there's no easy right answer

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.060
or where the right thing in the situation

01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:26.060
is complicated enough that different people

01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:27.060
will have different answers,

01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:28.560
you've given people something

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:30.560
truly gripping to think about.

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:32.560
The NCR seem like the obvious good guys

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.060
compared to Caesar's Legion,

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:36.560
a fascist tribe of ancient Rome cosplayers

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:39.060
going around crucifying and enslaving people,

01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:41.060
but half the game is spent dealing with the fact

01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:43.060
the NCR just aren't that great either.

01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:44.560
A lot of areas here are independent

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.560
and really aren't into the idea of being annexed

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.060
by these outsiders coming in

01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:50.060
declaring themselves the government.

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:52.060
Towns like Goodsprings and Prim

01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:54.060
don't stay independent for long,

01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:57.060
not if you've got something the NCR wants.

01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:59.560
One of the first characters you meet, Sunny Smiles,

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:02.060
says that she's heard a lot of bad shit about the Legion

01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:03.560
but mostly from the NCR,

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.060
and as far as she knows,

01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:07.060
they could just be making that up to justify being here.

01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:09.060
The NCR are doing poorly in the region

01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:11.060
because of a lot of internal politicking.

01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:13.060
The Republic's senators want to keep their seats

01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:15.560
and aren't interested in supporting an unpopular war.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.560
The best troops are off fighting other battles,

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.060
including defending the interests

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:21.560
of the rich Brahmin barons who have a lot of sway.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.060
Almost every soldier or ranger you run into

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.060
has a story about being stretched too thin,

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:27.560
not having the supplies they need,

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:29.560
the enemy being stronger than they were told.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:31.560
The horribly understaffed correctional facility

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:34.060
has long since been taken over by its own prisoners.

01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:37.060
Their quarries are full of guys sitting and waiting for help

01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:39.060
because no one's dealing with the Deathclaws.

01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:41.560
There's, like, five different gangs of raiders in the area,

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:43.560
so they're not really keeping the peace too well.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.060
They just don't have the manpower

01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:46.560
to deal with all these problems.

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.560
The fact there are so many quests you can do for them

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:50.560
is actually a really important plot point.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:53.060
They're so overrun, they're farming out stuff

01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:54.560
that needs doing to whoever comes along

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:56.060
and offers to lend a hand.

01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:58.060
The NCR are certainly not doing a good job

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:00.060
of proving that their society works,

01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:02.060
and it's not like they have clean hands here anyway.

01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:04.060
One of the main reasons the Khans are willing to join

01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:05.560
with Caesar to fight the NCR

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:07.560
is because the NCR massacred a bunch of them.

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:09.060
The Khans haven't been the good guys

01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:10.560
in any of the Fallout games,

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.560
but they have a lot of legitimate grievances

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.060
and reasons to want to harm the Republic.

01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:15.560
For the supposed good guys,

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.060
the NCR really love killing and subjugating

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:19.060
anything in their way.

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:20.560
Over on the western side of the map,

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.060
they're hiring mercenaries to harass

01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:24.060
the peaceful super mutants into a fight

01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:25.560
so they can justify killing them off

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.060
or driving them away.

01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:29.560
The NCR's the biggest gang of thieves in the Mojave.

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.560
Only difference is they pass laws

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:34.060
to make their crimes legal before they commit them.

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:35.560
Almost every group in New Vegas

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.060
is attempting to rebuild the world

01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:38.560
in the image of one that came before.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:41.060
The NCR are obviously emulating the United States,

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:43.060
a society that had its upsides, sure,

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:45.060
but which also destroyed the world

01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:46.560
and in the game as well.

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.060
The NCR's problems are mirrors

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:50.060
of real world society's problems

01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:52.060
because that's what they're trying to build

01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:54.560
and doing their best to replicate the power structure

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:56.560
of a society that ended in nuclear Armageddon

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:59.060
is a bit of an ambiguous idea, isn't it?

01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:01.060
Democracy's good, but this entire series

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:03.560
is all about the, well, fallout

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:05.060
of that system's failures.

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:07.560
If you want to see the fate of democracies,

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.060
look out the windows.

01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:10.560
If you decide to help them,

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.060
you have to compromise your values

01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:14.060
in the hopes that eventually they'll work things out.

01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:16.060
I think this is a reason why so many people

01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:18.060
think the independent option is better.

01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:19.560
Like, if you're going your own way,

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.060
you don't have to answer to these fuckers.

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:22.560
Caesar's Legion, on the other hand,

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:24.060
are a really interesting faction

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:26.060
because despite being basically awful,

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:27.560
the more you learn about them,

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.560
the more you understand why they're like this.

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.560
Caesar is obviously trying to rebuild things

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.060
more in the image of ancient Rome,

01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:35.060
a society which, for all its problems,

01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:37.060
lasted a long time in some form or another

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:40.560
and also, minor point, didn't destroy the entire world.

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.560
The early Romans built a civilization

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.560
out of what was basically nothing,

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.560
and in a world where technology and culture

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:48.560
has all been blasted back to square one,

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:51.560
using one of the first properly successful societies

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:54.060
as a blueprint for starting again isn't the worst idea.

01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:56.060
Caesar makes the case that his autocratic,

01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:58.060
brutal dictatorship is the best method

01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.060
of surviving and thriving in the wasteland,

01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:01.560
and he makes some really interesting arguments

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:02.560
why this is the case.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.060
He cites ancient Roman history

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:06.560
and even Hegelian dialectics in his defense,

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:08.060
and this is a really fantastic moment

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.560
because of how many layers it has.

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:11.560
Firstly, a game being willing to engage with players

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.060
on a philosophical level,

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:15.060
even going as far as invoking the work

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:17.060
of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Maser Panhegel,

01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:18.060
is just wonderful,

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:19.560
and it's so much more thought-provoking

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:21.060
than anything I'd come to expect from games

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:22.560
at the time when I played it,

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.060
but then there's the question of whether you agree

01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:26.060
with his interpretation of that philosophy.

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:27.560
Is he just trying to sound clever?

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.060
Does he really think he's that smart

01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:30.560
because he's read a few books?

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:32.060
He even drops historical references

01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:33.560
to Fallout's events as well.

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:35.560
Tandi, a character you met in the first two Fallout games,

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:37.560
essentially made the NCR what it is

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:39.560
and served as president for 50 years.

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.560
By the way, the group you rescue her from in Fallout 1?

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.060
They're the Khans.

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:45.060
The NCR has been having to deal with these guys

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:47.060
since before it even really existed,

01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:48.060
and you know what?

01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:50.060
It was weird that she was still president

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:51.560
by the time of Fallout 2.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:53.060
Caesar points this out.

01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:55.560
He makes the point that the NCR worked really well

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.060
when it essentially had a strong leader

01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:58.560
no one dared oppose,

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.060
and the infighting and corruption that emerged

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:01.560
when she died would have been avoided

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.060
if they just had dictators.

01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:05.060
This is an actual salient criticism

01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:06.560
of liberal democracy.

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:08.560
Say what you want about fascist autocracy,

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:10.560
but at least it means a bunch of ignorant people

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.060
can't accidentally vote in a moron

01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:14.060
and completely destroy their society.

01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:17.060
Instead, you have one strong, charismatic leader

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.560
destroying your society.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.560
Every member of the Legion besides Caesar

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:23.060
has a horror story about how they ended up here.

01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:26.560
Broke us by throwing our dogs on the fire.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.560
Lucius, the head of Caesar's Praetorian Guard,

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.560
happily tells the story of his tribe

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:32.060
being conquered by the Legion.

01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:34.060
The women of his tribe were turned into slaves

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:35.560
and all of the men and boys

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:37.560
who weren't fit for the military were killed,

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.560
and he's completely fine with all of this

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:41.560
because he's been told to believe since that day

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:43.560
that this made him more civilized.

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.060
Lucius has been made into an obedient servant.

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:47.560
He isn't even capable of recognizing

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:50.060
that a wrong was done to him and his people.

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:52.060
Perhaps the Legion's greatest evil

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:54.060
is that it convinces some of its worst victims

01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:56.060
it did them a service and to make them do it

01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:57.560
to others in its name,

01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:00.060
but forcibly integrating conquered peoples like this

01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:02.060
is arguably why they're such a successful

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:03.560
post-nuclear society.

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.560
They violently make people obey them

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:08.060
in a way that creates a very particular kind of,

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.560
well, peace.

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.060
Caesar's camp has a trader in it

01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:13.060
who loves trading in Legion territories

01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:15.060
because their lands are safer than the NCR's.

01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:17.060
There's no raiders or criminals,

01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:18.560
and that's a problem you've experienced firsthand

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:19.560
for the whole game.

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.060
The NCR are so poorly run

01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:22.060
that when you commit a crime,

01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:24.060
they send you to a really lax prison

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:26.060
and give you a bunch of dynamite to break out with.

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:27.560
The Legion's brutality

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:29.560
keeps everyone in their territory in line.

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:32.060
What's great about this is it's simultaneously

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:34.060
a criticism and a defense of the Legion.

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:36.060
You know, they're bad and they crucify people,

01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:37.560
but at least there's no crime.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:38.560
Can't argue with results.

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:39.560
Your bones.

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.060
But also it's, you know,

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:44.060
proof the Legion is terrible and has killed everyone.

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:47.060
The best thing is this is based on actual Roman history.

01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:48.560
The ancient Romans saw themselves

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.560
as bringers of law and order to the world.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.060
Peacekeepers, if you will.

01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:53.560
Romans would frequently inscribe

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.560
peace given to the world on medals awarded

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.060
to soldiers serving the empire,

01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:59.060
but here's a funny thing about history.

01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:01.560
People tend to assume that Rome was this bastion

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:03.560
of morals and intellect.

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:07.060
Mostly based on historical records written by Romans,

01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:09.560
their enslaved and murdered neighbors

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:12.060
might not have felt the same way about their ethics.

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:13.560
Tacitus, a Roman senator

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.560
and one of history's most important historians,

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.560
really famously has a quote from a chieftain

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:20.560
who fought the Roman army making this exact point for me.

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:23.560
They plunder, they slaughter, and they steal.

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:26.560
This they falsely name empire,

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:29.560
and where they make a wasteland, they call it peace.

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:32.060
The Legion keep the peace better than the NCR

01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:34.060
and in a historically accurate fashion,

01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:36.060
they do it by killing everyone.

01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:39.060
Just as my namesake campaigned in Gaul

01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:41.560
before he crossed the Rubicon,

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:44.560
so have I campaigned and will cross the Colorado.

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:47.060
By couching the Legion in actual history

01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:49.060
and giving its leaders a comprehensive philosophy

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:51.060
and having people who feel like they benefit

01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:53.060
from their actions, they stop just being

01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:55.060
the bad guys you can join if you want

01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:57.060
and start reflecting a real world view

01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:58.560
that has a lot to say for itself,

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:00.060
and despite seeming like an absurd

01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:02.060
and ridiculous faction, there's still a lot

01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:04.060
of social commentary going on here too.

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:06.060
The Legion are actually a more scathing criticism

01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:08.060
of a real world group than the NCR

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:10.060
because here's the thing about Edward Sallow,

01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:12.560
a guy who just fucking called himself Caesar

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.560
because he read a book about ancient Rome

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:17.060
and decided it was cool and he could totally do that.

01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:19.560
The guy's a larper. He's stealing valor.

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.560
He doesn't really know what he's doing.

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.560
He just thinks he's got a license to rule the world

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:26.060
because he knows what a Rubicon is.

01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:28.560
Like the NCR, he idolizes a specific moment

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:30.560
in history he's decided is good

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:33.060
even though Rome fell apart too in the end.

01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:35.060
Caesar's a really interesting criticism

01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:37.060
of all the losers out there in the real world

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:38.560
who think they're smart because they've read

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.560
about ancient Rome. You know, the kind of people

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.560
who name their Discord server Athens

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.560
to make themselves feel a bit smarter.

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.560
The story doesn't pretend both sides

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.560
are equally as good. Relentless horrible murder

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.560
and crucifixion is bad actually.

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:52.560
That's literally how they killed Jesus

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:55.060
but by giving Caesar a lot more to say for himself,

01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:57.560
actual arguments to think about and respond to,

01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.560
this makes conflict much more involving.

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:02.060
You have to have reasons why you oppose

01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:04.060
the ideas these people are putting forward

01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:05.560
and even if you think they're wrong,

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:07.560
you at least understand why they think

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:10.560
their ideas work which is very strong characterization.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.060
Project director Josh Sawyer

01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:13.560
and lead writer John Gonzalez

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:16.560
did a really good job with making the Legion make sense

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.560
and this means siding with them is really interesting

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.560
because you can feel the difference

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.060
between working with them and the NCR.

01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:24.060
It helps that so many quests for each faction

01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:25.560
mirror each other so well.

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.060
At McCarran Airport, you're helping root out Legion spies

01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:30.560
or you're helping those spies weaken the NCR.

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:32.560
Because the game has really laid the groundwork

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:34.560
for these conflicts and you have so much freedom

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.560
when it comes to how to take part in them,

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:39.060
all your actions within the story feel meaningful.

01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:41.060
Man, I love preventing the assassination

01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:42.060
of the president.

01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:43.060
There, are you happy, cat?

01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:44.560
I got both sides in there.

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.060
Your choices also affect your reputations

01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:47.560
with the factions of the game

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:49.560
which massively changes the experience.

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:51.560
If you side with the Legion, at a certain point,

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.060
you can't even go too far into the strip

01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:56.060
without a disguise because the NCR start fights with you.

01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:58.060
To be fair, I did assassinate their leader

01:12:58.060 --> 01:12:59.560
or in other playthroughs, maybe the Legion

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:01.060
are sending kill squads after me

01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:03.060
because I blew up one of their most important commanders

01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:05.060
and then kept shooting their soldiers.

01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:06.560
These squads are nasty too.

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:08.560
Like, going to war with the Legion is not pretty.

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.560
It feels like a genuine consequence

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.560
to choosing to be hostile toward them like this.

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:14.560
Every single time their assassins turn up

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.060
and tell you you shouldn't have messed with them

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:17.560
and it's time to die,

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.560
the player is being given a reactive reminder

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:21.560
of the choices they personally made.

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:24.060
This is what role-playing games are about.

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:26.060
It's just great. It's also terrifying.

01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:27.560
Oh, my God, he's so fast!

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:29.560
Thanks, Veronica.

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:31.560
Because there are so many different choices,

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:34.560
so many different ways of experiencing this story,

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:37.560
every choice that you make feels so much more genuine.

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:39.560
You really know for certain in this game

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.560
that this whole thing could have gone differently.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.560
Since you're never being forced to do anything,

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:46.060
everything you do feels that much more personal

01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:48.560
because on some level, you made a choice.

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:51.060
The player isn't forced to join the Brotherhood of Steel

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:52.560
as part of the main story.

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.060
You can choose to join them

01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:55.560
if you want to steal all their stuff,

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:58.060
but the choice feels personal because you don't have to.

01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:00.060
They aren't the main characters of the story here.

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:03.060
In fact, all the other factions ask you to blow them up.

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:06.060
Man, can you imagine having the guts to write a story

01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:08.560
where all three of the game's big factions ask you

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:11.560
to kill the most iconic group in the series?

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:13.560
That's not how you write a Fallout game.

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:16.560
That's how you write the best Fallout game.

New Vegas strikes a perfect balance

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:40.560
between fidelity to the stories and groups

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.560
of the previous games and doing different things with them

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:45.560
and then adding new stuff to the setting entirely,

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.560
and this is admirable because it's apparently

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.560
very tempting to copy-paste things

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.560
for the sake of fan service or change things

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:53.560
in ways that come off as cynical attempts

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.560
to rewrite the story to be something else.

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:58.060
A great case in point here is bottle caps.

01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:01.060
Caps became an iconic part of the early game's setting.

01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:03.060
They were a really novel idea for currency

01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:05.060
back in Fallout 1, but by Fallout 2,

01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:06.060
times have changed.

01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:07.060
The NCR have been making

01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:08.560
their own money for years now.

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.560
Fallout 3 went back to bottle caps,

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:12.560
which felt really insincere,

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.560
like it hadn't invested much thought

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.560
into its world beyond borrowing

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.560
what seemed cool from previous games.

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:20.560
New Vegas, as a result of its creators

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:22.560
thinking about how its world would work,

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.560
has three different currencies

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.560
because the NCR are here, their money is here too,

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.560
and hey, look who it is on the $100 bill.

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.060
It's Tandy. That's really cool,

01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:32.060
but it's not been adopted into the mainstream.

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:33.560
They don't run the place yet,

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:35.060
and a lot of people don't trust their money

01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:37.560
and still use the caps that were used in this area before.

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:41.060
NCR people only pay you for doing quests in NCR money,

01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:43.060
which they mention is worth less than it should be here

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:45.060
because people don't fully trust it.

01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:47.060
The NCR's money is almost a threat.

01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:49.560
They're insidiously making their way into Nevada,

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:52.060
and as the Legion creep their way west,

01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:53.560
their money's here too. Ugh!

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.560
The game is using currency

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:58.060
to show the developing tensions and politics

01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:00.060
of the post-post-nuclear world.

01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:01.060
How cool is that?

01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:03.060
By bothering to write explanations

01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:04.560
and justifications for their setting,

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.060
New Vegas gets to have its caps and eat them too,

01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:08.560
and what I love about this game is it puts

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:10.060
an equivalent amount of thought

01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:12.560
into every other aspect of the series' canon.

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:14.060
The Brotherhood are given a treatment

01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:15.560
befitting their belief system.

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:17.560
The Brotherhood of Steel's purpose in Fallout games

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.560
has been to hoard technology in their bunkers

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:21.560
in case the future needs it, which is cool,

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:24.060
but canonically, they've been doing that nonstop

01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:25.060
for hundreds of years.

01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:27.060
At a certain point, they're just hoarders,

01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:28.560
so by now they're in hiding,

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:30.060
living under permanent lockdown

01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:32.060
after losing a ton of people battling the NCR

01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:33.560
over Helios One.

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:35.560
Almost every faction wants you to dispose of them

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:37.060
because they're just not worth dealing with,

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:38.560
but once you get inside, you find out

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.060
they're having internal struggles

01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:41.560
over the future of the chapter,

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:43.060
and one possible way of saving them

01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:44.560
requires a ton of work,

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.560
but it allows them to get over themselves a little

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:49.560
and lift their lockdown and declare a truce with the NCR.

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:52.060
It's really beautiful how much of a struggle it is

01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:53.560
to get them to change their ways

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:56.060
and how small a part of the story they manage to be.

01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:58.060
These are the guys who normally end up on the box

01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:00.060
of Fallout games with less original things

01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:01.560
to say for themselves, and here they are

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:03.560
playing a tiny role in the main story,

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:06.060
living an existence that comments on their behavior

01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:07.060
in previous games.

01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:08.560
If you find their secret base

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:10.060
and try to get in with a password you found

01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:11.560
on the corpses of one of their patrols,

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.560
they capture you and put a bomb on your neck

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:15.560
until you prove that you're trustworthy,

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:17.560
and then they send you all around the world

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:19.060
doing busy work for them

01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:21.060
before they even consider making you a member

01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:23.060
and hearing you out on a truce with the NCR,

01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:24.560
but you know what's really cool?

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:25.560
When you first come here,

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:27.560
you could have a companion with you

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:29.060
who's a member of the Brotherhood of Steel.

01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:30.560
Hold on. I've got this.

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.060
So instead of getting captured,

01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:33.560
you get the best scene in the game.

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:35.560
We gave you a password, Veronica.

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:37.560
It's for your safety.

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:39.060
I know where you live, Ramos.

01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:41.060
Open up.

01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:42.560
For Pete's sake.

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.060
Opening up.

01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:45.560
Welcome back, Veronica.

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:48.060
And this skips the quest they make you do with the bomb.

01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:49.560
They actually thought about what would happen

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:50.560
if you had Veronica when you came here.

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:51.560
It's great.

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.060
And speaking of Veronica,

01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:54.560
her quest to try to get the Elder

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.060
to rethink the direction of the chapter

01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:57.560
is truly fascinating

01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:59.560
because no matter what technology

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:01.560
you help her find, she fails

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.560
and has to decide whether to remain

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:05.560
with the only family she ever knew,

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:07.060
supporting them even though she feels

01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:08.060
like they might be doomed

01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:10.060
or try to make a new life elsewhere.

01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:12.560
Come on. I can't listen to this anymore.

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:14.060
The player doesn't have control

01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:16.560
over whether Veronica succeeds in this situation.

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:19.060
Instead, their control is so much more personal.

01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:20.560
Through how they talk to Veronica

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.560
about these ideas during the course of the quest,

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:25.560
they help Veronica decide what to do with her life.

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:28.560
This story is so personal and thoughtful and sad,

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:30.060
and it's a way of looking at the Brotherhood

01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:31.560
and its members' relationships

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.060
that's completely unique.

01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:34.560
And speaking of doomed,

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:36.060
technologically advanced factions,

01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:38.560
I really like how the game treats the Enclave.

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.560
The Enclave were destroyed in Fallout 2,

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.560
uh, despite what some games will tell you,

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:44.560
and even though they're an iconic and cool faction,

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:46.060
they keep them destroyed here.

01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:48.060
The Remnants are just a handful of old people

01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:50.560
who happened to survive the fall of Navarro

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:52.060
and have at this point been out of it

01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:53.060
longer than they were ever in,

01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:54.560
but if Arcade Ganon,

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:56.560
a really cool companion character by the way,

01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:58.560
trusts you enough, at a certain point he tells you

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:00.060
he's the son of one of the Remnants

01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:02.060
and you and him can recruit the rest

01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:03.560
to take part in Hoover Dam

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:05.560
and help Arcade decide how he should feel

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.560
about his relationship with his father's old crew

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:08.560
along the way.

01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:09.560
The story involved here

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.060
is simultaneously really epic

01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:13.060
and goes really deep into the lore

01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:14.060
of the Fallout universe,

01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:16.060
but it's also about this guy figuring out

01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:17.560
where he stands with his history.

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.060
And at the Battle of Hoover Dam,

01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:20.560
along with all the other factions you recruited,

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:22.560
the Remnants triumphantly turn up

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:24.060
in an old Enclave vertibird

01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:26.560
and wearing the few suits of Enclave power armor

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:27.560
in the whole game world,

01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:29.060
and they help in the fighting.

01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:30.560
Seeing the survivors of the Enclave,

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:32.560
making this very small and easy to miss

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.060
appearance in the game,

01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:36.560
giving them the chance of a small sort of redemption,

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:38.060
it just feels so good.

01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:39.560
Also, this is a really small thing,

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:41.060
uh, but it meant a lot to me.

01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:43.560
Um, Ganon and Veronica are both gay

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:45.560
and it barely comes up.

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.060
Like, it's a small part of their lives,

01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:48.560
and that was a really big deal to me

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:50.060
playing this game when I was a bit younger.

01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:51.560
I don't know. That really spoke to me.

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:52.560
Um, thanks.

01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:54.560
The Super Mutants are given really thoughtful use

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:55.560
throughout the game as well.

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:56.560
They're so cool,

01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:58.060
even though their stories are mostly sad.

01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:00.060
Most of them are hanging around in Jacobstown,

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:02.060
separated from the rest of the world.

01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:03.560
Nightkin were a big deal in Fallout 1,

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:05.060
invisible Super Mutants,

01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:06.560
some of the toughest enemies in the game,

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.060
but they haven't really got much of a look-in

01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:09.560
in future games until now.

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:11.060
Addiction to and withdrawal from

01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:12.560
the dangerous ancient technology

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.060
that powered their invisibility,

01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:17.060
Stealth Boys, is seriously affecting their minds

01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:19.060
at this point, and many of them don't even like

01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:20.560
being looked at by people.

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:23.060
I really like how every fight with Super Mutants

01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:25.560
in this game is justified and understandable.

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:27.560
The mutants you fight at the Repcon facility

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:30.060
are losing their minds and searching desperately

01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:31.560
for a shipment of Stealth Boys they heard

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:33.060
were sent there by accident long ago.

01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:34.560
You can talk to their leader

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:36.060
and find a peaceful solution,

01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:37.560
but not if you killed too many of his friends.

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.060
Then you have to fight him.

01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:40.060
If you play very straightforwardly,

01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:41.560
you kill a bunch of mutants,

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:43.560
fight their leader who's obviously angry about this,

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:45.560
and then later discover the Stealth Boys

01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:47.560
they came here looking for were sent back.

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.560
You kill all of these desperate people

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:51.560
and find out they came here for nothing.

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:52.560
It's so bleak.

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.560
A peaceful solution means sneaking past

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:57.060
the ones that are too far gone to be talked down

01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:58.560
and finding this out for them.

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:00.560
Antler is sad, Shuman.

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:01.560
I can go now.

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:03.560
Find Stealth Boys in other places.

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:05.560
Even when you have to fight Super Mutants,

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:06.560
there's a story to it,

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:08.560
and you feel really sorry for them.

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.060
There's a Super Mutant companion

01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:11.560
who has memories of her grandchildren

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:13.060
from long, long ago.

01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:17.060
Oh, someone wants to hear Grandma's stories.

01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:18.560
And who isn't taking her medicine

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:20.060
because she doesn't want to forget them.

01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:21.560
Like, that's just so sad

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:24.060
and such an interesting thing to explore,

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:26.560
especially for characters who, in the previous game,

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:29.060
were used as enemies to shoot.

01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:31.060
You just feel so human, you know?

01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:32.560
Black Mountain is one of the other places

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:34.560
Mutants are hostile, at least to begin with,

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:37.060
and in addition to being really tough and heavily armed,

01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:38.560
they're aggressive for a reason.

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.560
Their leader is deliberately positioning herself

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:43.060
as a new master and relying on the Mutants' desire

01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:45.560
for a leader and ordering them to attack humans on sight.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:47.560
There's a peaceful solution to this too,

01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:48.560
and when you come back,

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:49.560
the Mutants are just hanging out.

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:50.560
I love Neil.

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:51.560
Neil is one of the first Mutants

01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:52.560
you're likely to run into,

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:54.060
and he's written to be an introduction

01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:56.560
to the more subtle and complex Mutants of this game.

01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:57.560
He basically runs up to you and says,

01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:59.060
hey, we know what you think,

01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:00.560
but we have a complicated history.

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:03.060
Many of us are just as intelligent as basic humans,

01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:04.560
and the rest don't really have any choice

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:06.060
in the matter, do they?

01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:08.060
He's like a tutorial for players who expected Mutants

01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:10.560
to just run around randomly killing people.

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.560
I really like how if you insult him

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.560
and then apologize, he's like,

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.060
okay, since you apologized.

01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:17.060
Like, he doesn't just attack you

01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:18.560
the instant you say something mean.

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:22.060
He's, you know, a character with motivations.

01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:24.060
He's here because the radio broadcast

01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:26.060
attracting more easily manipulatable Mutants

01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:27.560
is obviously a problem,

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:30.060
and he's trying to send them to Jacobstown instead.

01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:31.560
I just really love seeing Mutants

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:34.060
with comprehensible motivations and actions again.

01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:37.060
I feel bad for any of the Mutants I end up fighting.

01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:39.060
In one of the more slum-like areas surrounding Vegas,

01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:41.060
there's a friendly Super Mutant hanging out

01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:43.560
serving as the area's protector from gangs of raiders.

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:44.560
Hi.

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:46.060
There's no quests related to him.

01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:47.560
He's just a part of the world,

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:49.560
chilling out, fighting bad guys, and being cool.

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.560
If I have one criticism of New Vegas,

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:53.560
it's I wish there were a few more

01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:55.560
casual Super Mutant NPCs in the world.

01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:58.560
Apparently there was going to be a Super Mutant NCR ranger,

01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:00.060
but he got cut for time.

01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:03.060
What the NCR does have though are ghoul rangers.

01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:04.560
We won't go quietly.

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:06.560
The Legion can count on that.

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.560
At this point, pre-war ghouls are ancient,

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:10.560
and most of them are either really, really good

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:12.560
at what they do or bored as hell.

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:15.060
So they're serving as some of the NCR's finest

01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:16.560
or working as top scientists

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:18.060
like the one that went to Vault 22

01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:20.060
or the one at Jacobstown who casually mentions

01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:21.560
she's made new identities for herself

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:23.060
and moved on when she got bored

01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:24.560
with whatever she was doing.

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:26.060
They've really thought about how ghouls

01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:27.560
would work in this setting.

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:29.560
I mean, how do essentially immortal people

01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:31.060
live their lives?

01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:32.060
It's really cool.

01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:33.560
Raoul, a ghoul companion,

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:35.060
is a really good mechanic,

01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:36.560
but that's just his latest skill.

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:38.560
On top of that, he has a lifetime's worth

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:41.060
of experience as an honest-to-God cowboy,

01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:43.060
and convincing him to go back to his roots

01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:45.560
makes him the best companion in the game combat-wise.

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.060
The game never rests on the laurels

01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:48.560
of the existing setting.

01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:50.060
It's instead coming up with ways to evolve

01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:51.560
and add to the material.

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.560
Stuff that you wouldn't have expected at all

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:56.060
like an army of LARPers or New Vegas itself,

01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:58.560
a glowing symbol of pre-war decadence,

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.560
and its robot security guards answering

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:02.560
to a man on a TV screen fit right in

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:05.060
and add to Fallout's greatest creative strength

01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:06.560
which is the sense that anything

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:08.060
could happen in this world.

01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:10.060
God, Mr. House, what a sweet addition to the story.

01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:12.060
This character is voiced by the late, great

01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:13.560
René Auberginois.

01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:15.060
He knocks this character out of the park

01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:18.060
while being even more literally a face on a screen

01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:19.060
than the other characters.

01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:20.560
Give me 20 years,

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:22.560
and I'll reignite the high technology

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:24.060
development sectors.

01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:26.560
50 years, and I'll have people in orbit.

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:28.060
Also, and this is a small thing,

01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:31.060
but I love that New Vegas 1-Ups 3's major character

01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:33.060
turns out to be a computer twist.

01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:35.060
John Henry Eden is on the radio the whole game

01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:37.060
and talks about being the president of America,

01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:39.060
growing up in Kentucky, and so on,

01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:40.560
but then when you meet him, he's a computer.

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:43.060
It's sort of a twist, and New Vegas rolls around,

01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:44.560
and Mr. House is a major player,

01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.560
and people talk about him like he's a real person,

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:48.560
but you get there, and he's a face on a TV screen,

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:50.560
and he also insists he's a real boy

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:53.560
who has somehow been alive for, like, 260 years,

01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.060
which, yeah, right, of course,

01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:56.560
but then if you get into the basement,

01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:59.060
you discover, no, he's a real person

01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:02.060
kept alive in a pod hooked up to all these computers.

01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:04.060
I just like the little double twist there.

01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:05.560
Oh, and if you kill him, this triggers

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:08.560
a mass email obituary he wrote himself

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:10.060
detailing how accomplished he was

01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:12.060
and how the world is screwed now,

01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:14.060
but I guess when your faction is basically you

01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:16.060
and your robot friends, you might start

01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:17.560
to get a little self-obsessed.

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.560
Like, if you want to see how to make a Fallout game,

01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:20.560
there's a lesson here.

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:22.060
Don't rehash the iconic stuff

01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:23.060
everyone already knows.

01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:24.560
Come up with something completely new

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:26.560
like a faction of robot security guards

01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:29.560
who answer to a pre-war ultra-capitalist businessman.

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:31.060
Don't ask what the Fallout setting

01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:32.560
can bring to your creativity.

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.560
Ask what creativity you can bring

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:35.560
to the Fallout setting.

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:37.560
I mean, the man who shot you, Benny,

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:40.060
is such a fun personal antagonist for the player.

01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:42.060
He's consistently funny and surprising.

01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:43.060
You can choose to forgive him,

01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:45.060
and he seems sincerely affected by this,

01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:47.060
but then he tries to have you killed again anyway,

01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:49.060
but if he gets captured by the Legion

01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:50.560
when you and him get a quiet moment,

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:53.060
he tells you his entire plan to take over the Strip

01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:54.560
and says you should do it instead.

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.060
The guy knows he's done for,

01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:57.560
so he hands you his whole scheme

01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:59.560
so someone else can be his legacy.

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:01.060
What an interesting character.

01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:02.060
If the Legion get their hands on him,

01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:03.560
you can choose how he dies,

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:05.560
and I think it's fitting given all we've been through together

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.060
to take him on in single combat.

01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:08.060
Just him and me.

01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:09.560
Just make sure your companions

01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:11.060
aren't positioned with a view to the arena.

01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:12.060
Arcade, no!

01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:13.560
And speaking of his scheme,

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:15.060
Yes Man, a reprogrammed house robot

01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:16.560
who can be used to take his place,

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:17.560
is so cool.

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:19.560
I was programmed to be helpful

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:21.560
and answer any questions I was asked.

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:23.060
I guess nobody bothered to restrict

01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:25.060
who I answer questions for.

01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:27.560
That was probably pretty dumb, huh?

01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:29.060
He's really judgmental of your choices,

01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:31.060
but he's programmed not to be able to disagree

01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:32.560
with anything anyone says.

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:35.560
Okay. Consider them forgotten.

01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:37.560
Along with the projections that predict

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:39.560
they'll be our biggest enemy.

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:40.560
Forgotten!

01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:42.560
John Gonzalez is completely killing it

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:43.560
here with this guy.

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:45.060
All of these additions to the universe

01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:47.060
will make any future Fallout game

01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:49.560
that doesn't include them or make similar levels

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:51.560
of additions of their own feel empty

01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:53.560
and lacking in vision by comparison.

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:55.560
After New Vegas, the bar has been raised

01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:57.560
so high that they should probably just

01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:59.060
stop making video games now.

01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:00.560
There isn't even time to get into the fact

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.560
you can actually gamble in the New Vegas strip,

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:04.060
or you can play Caravan,

01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:06.560
which I definitely know how to play.

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:08.560
all gasp

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:10.060
gunshots

01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:12.560
Those bastards got Ringo in the end after all.

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:15.060
What a shame. It just keeps being engaging

01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:18.060
and thought-provoking right up until the very end.

01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:20.560
♪♪

01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:22.560
The final confrontation takes place

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.560
at the Second Battle of Hoover Dam.

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:26.560
The game's complex and branching story means

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:28.560
that you can be fighting on either side in this battle,

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:30.560
and even then you might really just be playing

01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:32.560
the NCR so House gets what he wants

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:34.560
or what you want with Yes Man's help.

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:36.560
The end game feels like the ultimate reward

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:38.060
for all the other work you did.

01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:40.060
If you fired up the Securitrons,

01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:41.560
a huge army of them is here to help out.

01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:43.060
If you've recruited the Boomers

01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:44.060
to whatever side you're on,

01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:46.060
they're out here blowing stuff up for you.

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:47.560
If you didn't deal with the Khans earlier

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:49.560
in some form or another, you have to fight them here,

01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:51.060
and if you're fighting for Caesar,

01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:52.560
they genuinely do turn up and help you out.

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:53.560
It's pretty cool.

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:55.060
The end game goes out of its way

01:27:55.060 --> 01:27:58.060
to feel like the culmination of lots of choices you've made.

01:27:58.060 --> 01:27:59.560
Although it is a bit of a steamroll

01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:02.060
if you recruited everyone you could for the NCR,

01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:04.060
that feels good too since it's a reward

01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:05.060
for the work you did.

01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:06.560
In any of the three main story paths

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.560
that end up siding against the Legion here,

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:10.560
you eventually fight your way to their main camp

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:12.060
where their commander is waiting.

01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:14.560
Legate Lanius has been talked about for the whole game

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:16.060
as a ruthlessly dedicated leader

01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:17.560
and incredibly dangerous fighter,

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:19.060
and he genuinely does command you

01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:20.560
if you side with the Legion,

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:22.060
but the buildup to actually fighting him

01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:24.060
after all this time is really cool and tense.

01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:27.060
Before the final battle, he engages you in conversation.

01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:28.060
You again.

01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:38.560
Okay, so maybe we should try talking.

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.560
An envoy of Vegas,

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.560
yet you carry yourself for battle.

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:47.560
If so, you cannot truly be of that city of cowards.

01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:50.060
Oh, man, his voice is so good. He's so cool.

01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:52.560
Lanius seems completely unwilling to back down,

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:55.060
so totally invested in victory at any cost

01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:56.560
that he'd rather die than give up.

01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:59.060
Even Caesar's death isn't enough to deter him.

01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:00.560
If you try to talk him out of fighting,

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:02.060
he's very resistant.

01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:04.060
Lanius' entire system of morality

01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:06.560
is so different from yours that you can't just say,

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:08.060
no, please don't be bad.

01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:09.560
To talk him out of a fight,

01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:11.060
you have to pick choices

01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:13.060
that actually convince him of something.

01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:15.560
You can point out that even if he wins,

01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:18.060
the sheer size of the Western territory

01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:21.060
makes controlling both it and the East far too difficult

01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:23.060
and would eventually doom the Legion as a whole.

01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:25.560
Hoover Dam is but a place.

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:28.560
I will not have it be the gravestone of the Legion,

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:31.060
whether quickly or, as you describe,

01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:33.060
slowly by attrition.

01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:36.060
This is fascinating because it's based in actual history too.

01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:37.560
One of the real Roman Empire's problems

01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:40.060
was that it was too big to effectively control

01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:42.560
without falling apart, and eventually it split in two.

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:44.060
There are other ways out too,

01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:46.560
like using bluff to convince him there's a trap up ahead

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.560
or even using barter to convince him

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:50.060
of the lack of supply lines.

01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:52.060
The multiple different ways of convincing him

01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:53.560
is a really nice way of rewarding players

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:55.060
who approach the game differently.

01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:57.060
I genuinely can't believe that they managed

01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:59.560
to make barter one of the most useful skills in the game.

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:02.060
Lanius fulfills a real mechanical challenge

01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:04.060
both in dialogue or if you fight him,

01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:07.060
but he still manages to make sense as a person.

01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:09.560
Even if you have 100 speech, after convincing him,

01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:11.060
you can still say the wrong thing

01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:12.560
and make him attack you again anyway.

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:15.060
This final big conversation of the game

01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:16.560
feels super cinematic.

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:18.560
It's such a cool finale to the story,

01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:20.060
made even cooler by the knowledge

01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:21.560
that if you'd made different choices,

01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:23.560
he'd be the guy you answered to

01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:25.560
while you fought across the dam in the other direction.

01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:28.060
Despite being really just a series of speech checks

01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:29.560
in a dialogue tree,

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:32.060
the quality of the execution of this final encounter

01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:33.560
makes this last conversation

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:36.060
feel like a real argument with a real person.

01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:37.560
Then if you're independent,

01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:39.060
you can throw the NCR general off the dam.

01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:41.060

since Fallout New Vegas was released.

01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:52.060
Well, not literally today.

01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:54.060
I wanted this video out on the day of the anniversary,

01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:55.060
but come on, it's me.

01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:56.560
We all knew that wasn't gonna happen.

01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:59.060

It's not looking so good right now to be honest.

01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:05.060
It's one of these very special games

01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:07.560
where there's tons of choices you could plausibly make

01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:09.060
for how to resolve the main quest

01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:11.060
and so many other side quests

01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:12.560
with tons and tons of different endings

01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:14.560
for how you interacted with every major faction,

01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:17.560
and the amount of variation is fantastic by itself,

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:19.060
but when it really comes down to it,

01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:21.560
its real success is that it makes those choices

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:23.560
so interesting and compelling

01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:26.560
that I enjoy making choices I made already

01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:28.560
just to see them play out again,

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:30.560
and sure, maybe graphically it's showing its age.

01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:32.060
There's some bugs here and there,

01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:33.560
and it has some issues getting running

01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:35.560
on Windows 10 and high refresh rate monitors,

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:38.060
but when a game has this much to say for itself,

01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:40.060
it manages to stay timeless.

01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:42.060
This game really gives me hope in a way.

01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:44.560
It's proof that games like this can exist,

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:46.560
and I can't wait for there to be another one like it.

01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:48.560
I genuinely don't understand

01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:50.560
how they made this game in 18 months.

01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:52.560
One of the most magical things about New Vegas

01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:54.060
is that even when it was done

01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:55.560
and the developers could have moved on,

01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:56.560
some of them didn't.

01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:58.560
People like lead developer Josh Sawyer

01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:00.060
have continued to be active.

01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:01.560
Sawyer's been responding to questions

01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:03.060
about the game on Twitter and Tumblr

01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:04.560
for years after the game's release,

01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:07.060
even now, in fact, justifying his decisions,

01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:08.560
taking and responding to criticism,

01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:10.060
going into detail about what went

01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:11.560
into the development process,

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:13.060
doing charity streams where apparently he said

01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:15.060
I was reading way too much into that smirk

01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:17.060
that one time, and yeah, I really fucked up there.

01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:19.060
What a dumb mistake to make. I'm so sorry.

01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:21.060
I don't know. Maybe this is a bit naive,

01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:22.560
a bit of a wishy-washy statement,

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:26.060
but New Vegas is great because at every given moment,

01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:28.560
it feels like a game made by a bunch of people

01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:30.560
who would happily spend ten years

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:32.560
answering questions about it in their spare time.

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:35.060
You know, I've never sat down and tried to figure out

01:32:35.060 --> 01:32:37.560
what I think the best games ever are,

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:39.560
but I know for a fact that Fallout New Vegas

01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.060
is my favorite game,

01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:42.560
and it has been for a long time.

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:44.060
Honestly, I'm kind of getting bored

01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:46.060
of waiting for other games to come along and beat it,

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:48.060
so, um, I guess for now,

01:32:48.060 --> 01:32:49.560
I'm willing to say that Fallout New Vegas

01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:51.060
is the best game of all time.

01:32:51.060 --> 01:32:52.060
Let's start a new list right now.

01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:53.560
Here it is, number one,

01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:56.060
and I'm gonna update this with every game

01:32:56.060 --> 01:32:58.560
that I ever mention in any of my videos from now on

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:00.560
so eventually we can have a list of every game

01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:03.060
from best to worst since I'm gonna be doing this forever

01:33:03.060 --> 01:33:04.060
and I will never die.

01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:05.060
So there we have it.

01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:06.560
Fallout New Vegas is objectively

01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:08.060
the best game of all time,

01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:10.560
and for that it gets my highest score ever,

01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:12.060
84 out of 100.

01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:13.560
It's been ten years,

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:15.560
but it honestly feels like it just got here.

01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:17.560
Fallout New Vegas might sometimes

01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:19.060
run out of memory and crash,

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:20.560
but that's only because there's so many moments

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:22.060
worth remembering.

01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:23.560
Oh, my God, I left that in the script.

01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:26.560
["Spring Days"]

01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:29.560
["Spring Days"]

01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:32.560
["Spring Days"]

01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:35.560
["Spring Days"]

01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:38.560
["Spring Days"]

01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:40.560
Oh, thanks for watching all the way through, folks.

01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:42.560
Um, I had a really good time making this video.

01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:45.060
It's, uh, really nice getting to just gush about

01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:47.560
how much I love a thing that is really close to my heart.

01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:49.560
I'm sorry that I haven't made that many videos this year.

01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:52.560
I meant to make more, but it's been a really tough year.

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:55.060
Um, I had a few projects that required me

01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:58.060
to fly out to interview people and stuff like that,

01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:00.560
and they all had to be cancelled when COVID happened

01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:02.560
and people started getting sick,

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:05.060
so that's–it's not been ideal.

01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:08.560
I got pretty sick too, but I don't think it was the virus.

01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:09.560
I think it was something else.

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:11.560
God, even though the video's finished now,

01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:13.060
there are so many things I'm like,

01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:14.060
oh, I should have mentioned this.

01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:16.060
Like, there's, like, so much stuff.

01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:18.560
Like, the way they reworked how guns work,

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:20.560
uh, the way damage has been changed,

01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:22.560
the reintroduction of damage threshold,

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:24.060
all that stuff. I mean, there's so many even, like,

01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:25.560
really tiny things that really stick out to me.

01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.560
Like, if Wild Wasteland is turned on,

01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:29.560
then in the credits of New Vegas, uh,

01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:31.560
Dead Money, the name of one of the DLCs,

01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:32.560
is just Dead Monkey.

01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:35.560
Like, just weird, cute little things like that

01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:36.560
just constantly.

01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:37.560
It's just really good.

01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:39.560
Have you figured out that I like this game yet?

01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:41.060
I have a couple of videos

01:34:41.060 --> 01:34:43.060
that are really close to being finished.

01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:44.560
In fact, one of them will hopefully be out

01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:45.560
before Christmas,

01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:48.560
and then I'm gonna have one done in mid-January, I think.

01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:50.560
So, um, it's good to be back up to speed

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:53.560
and, uh, show people what I've been doing all this time.

01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:56.060
Honestly, the video coming out in January

01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:58.060
might be the best video I've ever made,

01:34:58.060 --> 01:35:00.060
and I'm so annoyed that this video

01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:01.560
took so much longer than I expected

01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:03.060
because I just can't wait to show it off.

01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:05.560
However, it's about an issue

01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:07.560
which will be more pressing in January,

01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.560
so it's almost like I planned it that way,

01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:10.560
but it's not.

01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:11.560
It was a terrible mistake,

01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:13.060
and I wish I could have done sooner.

01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:14.560
Anyway, I'm just rambling now.

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:17.060
Um, I hope you all have a good Christmas.

01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:19.060
Tune in in, like, literally three days

01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:20.560
when a video about Christmas comes out.

01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:22.060
I'm not even joking. See you then.

01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:23.060
Anyway, I guess that's it.

01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:26.060
I'll see you all, um, in hell,

01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:27.560
and thank you all so much

01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:29.560
for watching the video all the way through,

01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:31.560
and if you're a patron, thank you for supporting me.

01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:34.060
Uh, it's been very nice being able to continue drinking

01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:36.560
sparkling water even during an apocalypse.

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:38.560
Um, I have one of those soda streams

01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:42.060
where you, um, you can take the canister back in

01:35:42.060 --> 01:35:44.060
for a discount on a replacement canister,

01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:46.060
and every couple of months, you know,

01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:47.560
I put on a mask and brave the trip

01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:50.060
to the one store that replaces the canisters,

01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:52.060
and that's basically my only interaction

01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:53.560
with the outside world right now.

01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:55.060
I've noticed that, uh, the credits are obviously

01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:56.560
quite long considering how long

01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:58.060
I've managed to talk during them,

01:35:58.060 --> 01:36:00.060
so I'm thinking of maybe doing some kind of thing

01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:01.560
where people can send me questions

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:03.060
and I'll read them out in the credits.

01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:05.060
Maybe, like, it makes sense instead of these rambles,

01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:07.060
or maybe people like me just talking about whatever.

01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:09.060
It's fine. Anyway, I'm gonna go watch Columbo

01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:11.060
and take a nap, so, uh,

01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:13.060
you all have yourselves a great evening.
