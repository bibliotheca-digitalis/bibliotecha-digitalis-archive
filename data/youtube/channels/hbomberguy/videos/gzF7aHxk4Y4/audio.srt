On a surface level, it's easy to see

why Vault 22 is a more compelling place to explore.

80
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,820
It's a bit nicer to look at with its spots

81
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,940
of overgrowth in the halls and plants everywhere,

82
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,440
the cave network it gives way to

83
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,660
and its more run-down areas,

84
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,080
and it's populated with enemies

85
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,780
unique to this one location called Spore Carriers

86
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,680
which look like humans but creepily hide in foliage

87
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,140
and can't be targeted by V.A.T.S. while they're hiding,

88
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,720
meaning you have to be able to spot them

89
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,680
through their camouflage in order to fight them

90
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,980
which makes them genuinely creepy and, ugh!

91
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,820
And while the unique aesthetic and cool enemies are fun,

92
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,980
what makes Vault 22 a good case study

93
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,520
in Obsidian's design philosophy

94
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,100
is the ways it creates a strong narrative experience

95
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,280
for players and uses its mechanical elements

96
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,860
to enhance player engagement with the story.

97
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,660
Firstly, just for convenience's sake,

98
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,820
the vault can be discovered in more than one way.

99
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,320
Six different quests lead you to this vault.

100
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,560
You don't necessarily come here

101
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,360
looking for those delicious eggs.

102
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,820
One guy wants you to find the secret

103
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,860
of how they're growing all these plants so easily

104
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,980
since, you know, growing plants in the wasteland

105
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,980
is a pretty big deal.

106
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,100
Somewhere on a computer system

107
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,360
in the vault are files on how they managed all this,

108
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,740
but on your way out of his office,

109
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,980
another scientist stops you and says he sent, like,

110
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,740
ten other guys there already and none of them have come back

111
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,100
and asks you to find out what happened

112
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,640
to another researcher who went there.

113
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,060
This is a trick the game pulls often with its quests.

114
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,600
Even something as simple as,

115
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,520
download some files for me, please,

116
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,840
is given extra layers of narrative meaning.

117
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,020
You're actually being sent to a dangerous place

118
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,300
without proper warning

119
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,920
and other people are missing there.

120
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,420
This creates a sense of anticipation to the level.

121
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,140
The vault has tons of computer logs

122
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,380
detailing the work they did,

123
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,100
the events with mind-controlling spores

124
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,920
that led to everyone's death or infection,

125
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,020
and a bunch of new logs left by the researcher

126
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,420
who went missing when she came here,

127
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,880
and because you're actually trying to find out

128
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,560
what happened to the researcher,

129
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,380
it's much harder to ignore the story

130
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,200
that's going on here than it would be otherwise.

131
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,660
The player is also being given mechanical rewards

132
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,420
that really incentivize exploring

133
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,580
and engaging closely with the material.

134
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,740
There's a unique laser rifle you can't get

135
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,700
anywhere else in the game hidden in this vault

136
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,240
on some poor guy's corpse.

137
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,120
The game never draws attention to it.

138
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,820
It's not, like, a reward you get

139
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,240
for beating a boss or something.

140
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,120
It's just hidden in a corner somewhere,

141
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,920
and the genius of this kind of design

142
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,420
is that once players have found something like this once,

143
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,540
they're gonna realize there could be

144
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,620
stuff hidden anywhere.

145
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,660
Suddenly they're paying that much more attention

146
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,700
to the environments that they're traveling through

147
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,860
and partaking more in the stories of the place.

148
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,400
You might not really care that much

149
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,480
about the story of little side quests like this,

150
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,980
but if you know there might be a cool gun in here somewhere,

151
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,280
you're paying a lot more attention

152
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,280
than you might have been.

153
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,860
Some of the quests technically put

154
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,280
an objective marker in the corner

155
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,820
leading you to the necessary part,

156
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,240
but when Vault 22 has worked its magic,

157
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,520
you forget it's there.

158
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,480
The true beauty of great game design

159
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,820
is when all its artificial justifications,

160
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,160
quest indicators, loot to find,

161
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,740
experience points to earn, melt away,

162
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,520
and you really feel like you're in a creepy place

163
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,660
looking for answers.

164
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,060
Eventually you find the researcher is alive

165
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,280
and can help them flood the lower floors with gas

166
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,440
and blow up the spores

167
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,200
so they don't pose a threat to anyone else.

168

00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,160
Have a little faith in us.

185
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,580
You have to be good at science

186
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,860
in order to reason out with her that it's probably good

187
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,700
to have a record of the mistake so people don't repeat it.

188
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,500
What could have been a simple fetch quest

189
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,380
to find some data ended in making an ethical decision

190
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,380
about whether the information you found deserves to exist.

191
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,340
The advantages of this design are clear

192
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,700
when you contrast with the Gary Vault in 3.

193
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,000
The enemies are kind of cool for a little while,

194
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,660
but there's no quests or story or choices to make,

195
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,120
so the experience isn't particularly involving.

196
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,340
You don't really have any reasons to be here.

197
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,500
There's a really useful piece of loot in this vault,

198
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,000
a bobblehead that permanently increases your charisma,

199
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,920
and even though it's technically quite hard to miss,

200
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,960
it's just sitting on a table deep in the vault,

201
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,080
getting to it requires trawling through

202
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,040
the rest of a location that has nothing else worth finding

203
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,200
and enemies whose gimmick was wearing thin after Gary 3.

204
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,120
I'm willing to bet most players got bored

205
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,540
and left before they found it.

206
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,120
If you found this, be honest.

207
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,700
You didn't find it because the location was so cool

208
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,700
it made you want to look around and see all of it.

209
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,700
You found it because you were using a guide

210
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,280
to find all the bobbleheads.

211
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,120
Thanks, Carl.

212
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,840
Eventually, players lose interest

213
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,960
in picking through empty buildings

214
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,620
full of locked, easy safes

215
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,620

in New Vegas.

222
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,820
Vault 11 is straight up an incredibly

223

well-written piece of fiction,

224
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,200
and it's just hiding off in a little nook

225
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,320
waiting for you to be sent there as part of a quest

226
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,400
for the Brotherhood of Steel.

227
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,480
I need you to go on this important quest for me.

00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,120
Our air conditioner's broken.

Yep, yep, yep, great, great!

230
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,820
I'm going to destroy this faction.

231
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,320
This approach to quest design is all over the place,

232
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,240
offering you very simple and straightforward

233
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,820
seeming things and then pulling the rug out from under you.

234
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,400
Honestly, there are probably too many.

235
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,140
It's at the point where if you happen to pick up

236
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,320
enough cute little bottle caps with stars on them,

237
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,100
you stumble into a quest to discover

238
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,400
a legendary treasure.

239
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,900
You get random encounters with people

240
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,480
murdering each other over them.

241
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,600
After you find your first one,

242
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,320
this guy Malcolm eventually tracks you down

243
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,480
and tells you about the quest.

244
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,900
He's kind of notorious for doing it

245
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,480
at really unexpected times.

246
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,360
You might notice he seems to be at a weird angle

247
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
looking down at me.

248
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,520
That's because on this play through,

249
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,140
I was crouching preparing for a fight

250
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,140
when he found me.

251
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,860
Hello there.

252
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,140
It was actually kind of terrifying,

253
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,860
but I admire his dedication.

254
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,980
Now give me the caps.

255
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,240
Yeah!

256
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,820
Okay, I'm gonna be nice about Fallout 3.

257
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,900
There's some good stuff in there

258
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,600
and some of these quests are genuinely good

259
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,600
like when a talking tree asks you to kill it

260
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,720
in spite of its existence bringing people hope

261
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,360
or resolving a dispute between two broken people

262
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,140
masquerading as comic book characters

263
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,260
and harassing a town

264
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,140
or when an old woman asks you to find her

265
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,000
the world's last remaining Stradivarius violin.

266
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,720
A handful of the quests in Fallout 3

267
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,040
end up being genuinely good, funny,

268
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,880
and even touching at times.

269
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,000
If anything, they annoy me in a particular way

270
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,500
because they made me see how amazing a game would be

271
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,540
if it was filled with quests like these.

272
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,620
Ahem, New Vegas is a game filled with quests like these,

273
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,040
but hey, maybe it's a quality over quantity type thing.

274
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,800
I mean, even if you don't like the quests in 3,

275
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
at least there's a lot of them.

276
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,180
Obsidian only had 18 months to make New Vegas

277
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,040
so there's no way they could make that many quests.

287
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,900

what are they doing here?

318

These mysteries are a really compelling hook.

It helps that he's voiced by Matthew Perry, too.

John Gonzalez, the lead writer for New Vegas,

337
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,360

Players are much more likely to actively take part

349

in a story if they have questions

350
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,340

363
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,720
but still, they were onto something here.

364
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,460
One of my biggest gripes about Fallout 3

365
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,100
was how long it took to start.

366
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,220
The opening sequence deciding your character's stats

367
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,760
and learning the basics of the gameplay

368
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,160
takes 19 years of in-game time

369
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,600
and honestly, it feels that long

370
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,360
before eventually your father realizes

371
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,860
he's forgotten to do the main quest

372
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,360
and escapes and you go after him.

373
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,660
It's only when you finally leave the vault

374
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,160
that the game properly opens up to be explored.

375
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,560
Fallout New Vegas's opening is as smooth as butter

376
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,060
and not the butter you keep in the fridge.

377
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,560
The butter your parents keep in a little dish by the table

378
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
so it's already smooth and melty when you need it

379
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,960
and it's just so spreadable

380
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,060
and every time you visit them,

381
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,560
you make a mental note to get one

382
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,060
but you forget again as soon as you

383
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,160
After the opening cutscene,

384
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,260
you're talking to Doc Mitchell

385
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,260
where you make your character

386
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,460
and then walk outside his house

387
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,260
and bam, the game begins.

388
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,760
Fallout 2 opens by forcing you to complete a dungeon

389
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,060
that's pretty repetitive after the first few times through.

390
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,460
It's one of the few things most people don't like about 2

391
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,760
and players often use mods to skip it entirely.

392
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,060
Can you imagine having, like, a decade of hindsight

393
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,260
on all the criticisms people had of Fallout 2

394
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,760
and then making a game where the opening

395
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,460
is, like, three times as long?

396
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,060
That would be a bit silly, wouldn't it?

397
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,260
Eh, I'm sure they'll learn the lesson for Fallout 4.

You pick your starting stats

401
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,560
through a really cute device called the Vigor Tester

402
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,060
and then you get a psych exam

403
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,460
which involves an honest-to-god Rorschach test

404
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,460
which is just great.

405
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,560
Some players actually modded in

When you get to pick your tagged skills though,

413
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,560
you'll notice the list of skills

414
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,060
is a little different from 3.

415
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,960
Big guns and small guns are missing, for example.

416
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,360
There's just guns now

417
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,360
but in addition to this,

418
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,460
all these skills have much more uses

419
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,460

Okay, look, we all love speech, right?

422
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,460
Kudos to the series for making a video game

423
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,160
where talking was a skill worth putting points into at all

424
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,960
but a problem plaguing Fallout games

425
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,560
since the beginning was that one skill

426
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,260
made you the master of half the game's

428
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,260
which really wasn't ideal.

429
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,060
Games have tried to section off speech

430
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,660
into different types of speech

431
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,660
but let's be honest,

432
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,360
none of them have really worked.

433
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,060
New Vegas goes for the opposite solution.

434
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,560
It keeps speech as is

435
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,160
while giving other skills

436
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,860
the chance to influence dialogue.

437
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,560
The game is also cleverly using

438
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,160
its opening area, Goodsprings,

439
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,460
to great effect in tutorializing players

440
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,460
about this feature.

441
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,760
The first real quest in the game

442
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,660
is to prepare for an attack on the town.

443
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,160
This quest has multiple optional components

444
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,060
where you can ask the townspeople for help

445
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,360
and each of them needs convincing

446
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,560
using a different skill.

447
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,860
This whole quest is basically the game

448
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,860
showing you how many different ways you can play it.

449
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,360
Like, hey, if you were good at barter,

450
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,160
you could have talked this guy into helping.

451
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,660
All the players who took this quest

452
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,560
know that barter can influence dialogue

453
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,160
and not just how much things cost

454
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,260
and minor spoilers,

455
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,760
barter can be used to beat the final boss.

456
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,760
I'm not even kidding.

457
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,960
That's how many options you have here.

458
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,260
If you want Easy Pete

459
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,760
to share his dynamite with you,

460
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,660
you have to prove you wouldn't blow your head off

461
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,660
if he did.

462
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,860
He doesn't need $10 words to convince him.

463
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,260
He needs you to prove you're better

464
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,860
at throwing explosives than these clowns.

465
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,960
Now that's what I call a...

466
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
He blew himself up.

467
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,460
Checks like this for other abilities

468
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,760
are all over the game.

469
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,560
Speech is still really useful,

470
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,560
but conversations are so much more varied

471
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,160
in what they ask of player characters,

472
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
and that's great.

473
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,560
Medicine, a skill I ignored

474
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,260
in every other Fallout game,

475
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,760
now unlocks some of the best dialogue options

476
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,060
because it turns out being a doctor

477
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,060
in a post-apocalypse is really, really good

478
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,360
at opening doors for you.

479
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,060
What other game lets you do therapy

480
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,260
at a cannibal chef

481
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,460
until he has a breakdown and quits his job?

482
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,060
Players are more likely to feel like

483
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,760
the type of character they made

484
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,060
had a tangible impact on a conversation

485
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,460
which creates a rewarding sense of control.

486
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,460
On top of all of this,

487
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,460
the way dialogue actually works

488
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,460
has been changed significantly from 3.

489
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,460
In 3, if something required speech,

490
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,860
even if you had the maximum amount of speech,

491
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,460
the game could still randomly decide

492
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,660
you failed the check,

493
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,460
so you could build your character around speech

494
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,360
and still just not get to use it,

495
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,560
or you could build your character

496
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,760
around everything else

497
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,160
and just reload the game until you got it anyway.

498
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,460
In New Vegas, if you have the required skill,

499
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,460
it works.

500
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,460
It just works.

501
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,160
It even tells you if you don't have enough,

502
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,660
and in a choice that someone

503
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,960
should have won an award for,

504
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,660
it gives you a worse line to say as a result.

505
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,060
I really like this because it means

506
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,160
you can pick bad options on purpose

507
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,560
and see what happens. It's great.

508
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,260
Finally, I can role play as a complete loser

509
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,660
because I'm so sick of winning in real life.

510
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,260
So now speech is useful based on how many points

511
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,360
you put into it,

512
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,160
not whether the game decides it,

513
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,760
which makes this character creation

514
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,260
feel way more tangible and substantive.

515
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,360
The points feel like they actually matter.

516
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,460
Right after this comes another big change from 3.

517
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,860
After picking your tagged skills,

518
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,760
you get to pick up to two traits.

519
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,360
Which, well...

520
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,660
These were a really cool feature

521
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,960
in the early Fallout games.

522
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,360
Traits would optionally give you

523
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,860
some kind of interesting bonus

524
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,360
and a downside to go with them.

525
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,660
So you could be a one-hander,

526
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,860
so you're a bit more accurate with one-handed weapons

527
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,260
but a whole lot less accurate

528
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,860
with two-handed ones to compensate.

529
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,660
Some of them were just mild changes

530
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,860
like Bloody Mess, which makes every death animation

531
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,160
always the most violent one

532
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,460
for whatever weapon you were using.

533
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,760
I really love Jinxed,

534
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,560
which vastly increases the amount

535
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,760
of critical failures,

536
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,360
an otherwise pretty rare occurrence

537
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,160
for everyone in the game, including you.

538
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,260
Traits led to vastly different ways

539
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,160
of playing the game right from the outset.

540
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,960
They were a really cool addition to the RPG formula.

541
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,260
Everybody loved them,

542
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,460
and Fallout 3 removed them for no reason,

543
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,160
which was a shame because traits

544
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,560
were the spiciest part of character creation.

545
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,060
They're a chance to make a character worse at something

546
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,460
in exchange for a reward,

547
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,060
and that's a really interesting decision

548
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,060
to give to players.

549
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,160
I really like Four Eyes,

550
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,860
which reduces your perception by one

551
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,360
but you get it back and one more

552
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,760
once you find a set of glasses.

553
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,760
Once you account for that,

554
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,860
it's kind of like getting an extra special point,

555
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,460
but there's also a secret downside

556
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,760
you don't realize at first.

557
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,860
You can't wear glasses with power armor helmets

558
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,460
and stuff like that, so it affects what stuff

559
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,160
you end up wearing later in the game too.

560
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,460
Plus, as a guy who needs to wear contact lenses all day

561
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,760
or he'll fall over and die,

562
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,160
I feel very seen by this trait.

563
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,360
Having that kind of control

564
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,660
over what your character is like,

565
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,360
making them as unique as you want,

566
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,260

00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,460

is one of their main forms of expression,

570
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,960

because of it.

626
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,760
Here's a game design term for you.

627
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,960
Horizontal progression.

628
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,260
Vertical progression is when the numbers get higher

629
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,760
and, yeah, sure, numbers going up

630
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,960
can be fun and pleasing in its own way,

631
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,460
but giving someone a new power,

632
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,960
a new thing they can do,

633
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,260
is usually way more rewarding.

634
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,460
They actually came up with perks

635
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,760
to give players more to do when they level up.

636
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,960

skill points aren't enough for me to do.

00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,260
In other words, according to Fallout's original creator,

641
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,260
perks exist in order to make leveling up

642
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,560
feel more substantive than just putting points into stats.

643
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,560
Pause for effect.

644
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,760
A lot of the perks in Fallout 3

645
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,060
just add more points into stats.

646
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,760
So you level up, you assign your points,

647
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,260
and then, oh, I guess I can put five more points

648
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,560
into science and medicine,

649
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,260
or I can put five points in small guns and repair.

650
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,560
Oh, I can put 15 points into big guns.

651
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,560
That almost makes big guns a feasible skill

652
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,060
that doesn't need deleting from the game.

653
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,860
Do you like when the numbers get higher?

654
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,860
I hope you do.

655
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,060
Could I have a more interesting

656
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,360
form of progression, please?

657
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,060
I mean, let's be fair, there are some good perks

658
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,060
like animal friend.

659
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,060
So certain animals,

660
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,360
even some of the really dangerous ones,

661
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,560
will just hang out with you now

662
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,860
or even defend you in battle

663
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,360
if you take it twice which is cool.

664
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,360
Black Widow and Lady Killer are pretty nice too.

665
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,360
It's certainly better than having five more sneak

666
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,660
and lock pick. Come on.

667
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,360
First off, literally all of the boring perks

668
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,660
have been deliberately removed from New Vegas.

669
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,060
Like, there were so many and they're all gone.

670
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,560
It's like you can tell someone

671
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,860
who knows what they're doing looked at Three's perks

672
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,860
and said, these ones are bad. Take them out.

673
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,860
But here's the thing, right?

674
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,360
New Vegas gets to make its perks

675
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,560
way more interesting and cool

676
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,660
because they've changed the way they're used in the game.

677
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,860
In New Vegas, perks have more demanding requirements

678
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,160
before you can take them.

679
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,360
Meltdown is a ridiculously cool perk

680
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
that causes enemies killed with energy weapons

681
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
to explode in a burst of damage

682
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,360
which can often cause massive chain reactions.

683
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,860
Okay, that's a bit much to be honest.

684
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,860
This perk is hella horizontal.

685
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,360
Hella. What a great word.

686
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,860
It makes specializing in energy weapons feel amazing.

687
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,660
You're blowing people up left and right.

688
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,660
It's great, but you can only get this cool,

689
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,860
overpowered power if you have 90 energy weapons skill

690
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,660
which is a really steep requirement

691
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,460
especially considering New Vegas gives you

692
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,160
a lot fewer skill points per level

693
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,160
and you only get to pick a perk once every two levels now

694
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,860
which is how it was in the original games too.

695
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,660
That's another thing Three changed for some reason.

696
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,160
Cool perks are a reward for how you built your character.

697
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,160
Players are incentivized to plan ahead

698
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,460
and think about what sort of character they want to make

699
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,160
and what perks they want to end up with

700
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,960
which is intensely engaging.

701
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,460
Only one perk in Three requires a skill as high as 80

702
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,660
and most have no skill requirements at all.

703
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,760
There's a very real sense of progress

704
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,760
to building up a character in New Vegas

705
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,460
because perks add genuinely unique things.

706
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,460
Also, this is a small thing, but in Fallout 3

707
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,760
there was a perk that let you get

708
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,260
some more romantic dialogue

709
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,760
with characters of the opposite gender

710
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,260
so you could play a womanizing man

711
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,260
or a mananizing woman.

712
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,060
It also let you deal 10% more damage

713
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,760
to that gender for some reason.

714
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,060
I'm sure it was unintentional,

715
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,560
but the existence of these perks

716
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,560
implies Bethesda don't think gay people exist

717
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,860
in the Fallout universe which is quite funny.

718
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,560
New Vegas added a same gender version of the perk

719
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,060
so you could play as a gay character

720
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,560
or you could take both which at that point

721
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,060
gave you a 10% damage bonus against almost everyone

722
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,060
and was also a really nice piece of representation.

723
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,560
You were at that point role playing

724
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,060
a bisexual character in a video game.

725
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,860
In 2010, which was super cool,

726
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,360
I should have led with that and not the damage bonus.

727
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,060
♪ I'm going under ♪

728
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,560
Back in the days of Fallout 3,

729
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,860
people loved modding in more severe survival elements.

730
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,660
Fallout Wanderer's Edition is the most downloaded mod

731
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,360
for 3 by a pretty wide margin and it's a great mod.

732
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,660
It makes the game much more engaging and challenging.

733
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,860
It also came with a built-in alternative start option

734
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,660
so you didn't have to fucking do the vault again.

735
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,860
New Vegas gives players who like that sort of thing

736
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,560
an option built into the game.

737
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,060
On your way out of the front door,

738
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,360
you're given the choice to use hardcore mode.

739
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,160
It makes stimpacks heal over time

740
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,160
so you can't pause the game and get all your health back

741
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,160
in the middle of a fight.

742
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,160
You have to manage thirst,

743
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,360
hunger, and sleep now.

744
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,560
Companions can die which is terrifying.

745
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,560
Veronica, no!

746
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,860
And even bullets affect your carry weight now.

747
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,160
It really isn't messing around either.

748
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,560
In the middle of a normal playthrough,

749
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,360
I tried turning it on and suddenly I was at three times

750
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,360
my maximum carrying capacity.

751
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,360
I had to drop all this stuff just to be able to move.

752
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,660
Don't look at me like that, Veronica.

753
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,660
It's not littering anymore.

754
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,660
The world's ended.

755
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,960
This little extra optional realism

756
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,660
adds a lot to the experience

757
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,160
for people who like that sort of thing.

758
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,260
I'm personally a really big fan

759
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,660
of when developers add things into games

760
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,760
because they know that people would want them there

761
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,460
and mod them in if they weren't.

762
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,260
Like, people also modded iron sights

763
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,460
into Fallout 3 a lot.

764
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,460
Fallout 3 didn't have iron sights for some reason.

765
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,960
It just zoomed in a bit.

766
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,660
But guess what?

767
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,460
New Vegas has iron sights now. It's great.

768
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,260
In fact, this actually reveals another problem

769
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,560
with Fallout 3's design.

770
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,760
You can't aim down the sights of certain guns

771
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,260
that were made for Fallout 3

772
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,860
because whoever designed them at the time

773
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,860
forgot to put sights on them.

774
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,360
Like, they didn't think about how a person would use them.

775
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,060
Look at the laser pistol, for example.

776
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,060
There's just, like, a nub and a little rail there.

777
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,260
What am I looking down?

778
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,260
Here's the laser rifle.

779
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,560
It's a pretty nice-looking gun,

780
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,260
but it wasn't built with consideration

781
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,260
for how a person would actually use it.

782
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,860
In third person, when you right-click,

783
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,060
the character doesn't aim down sights animation,

784
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,060
but there's no sights there. What is she doing?

785
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,260
Bethesda noticed this too

786
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,060
because they redesigned laser weapons

787
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,560
in 4 to have sights on them.

788
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,060
Another thing people frequently modded into Fallout 3

789
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,360
was the ability to upgrade and modify weapons.

790
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,860
That's a bit of a confusing concept.

791
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,560
Modding in weapon mods?

792
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,760
The base game in New Vegas comes with the ability

793
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,760
to modify weapons.

794
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,260
Now you can upgrade and customize

795
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,260
your equipment. It's great.

796
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,060
Hilariously, one of the mods for the laser weapons

797
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,560
is working iron sights.

798
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,060
This is the weapon upgrade version of a subtweet.

799
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,760
Combine that with the fact there's way,

800
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,260
way more weapons in New Vegas

801
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,760
and different ammo types for the weapons too,

802
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,260
and all of a sudden you have so much more room for choice

803
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,760
in how you build your character and what weapons you use.

804
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,260
Optimized ammo, baby!

805
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,760
Okay, I got distracted there and talked about

806
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,060
a bunch of other stuff,

807
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,060
but that's because New Vegas is so good

808
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,560
at tying everything together.

809
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,060
The opening quest at Goodsprings

810
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,060
is a really well-designed introduction

811
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,560
to the ways the character you've built

812
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,060
and your skills and traits and perks can be used

813
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,060
as you prep for the town's big battle,

814
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,560
and the final thing it has to teach you

815
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,060
is that being the good guy isn't the only option

816
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,060
because you can align yourself with the gang

817
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,060
and help them take over the town instead,

818
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,560
and this gets you cred with the gang

819
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,560
which can really help you out

820
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,060
with a lot of stuff later in the game.

821
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,060
The story is essentially this side quest

822
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,860
in slow motion with larger stakes,

823
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,860
a series of preparations for the second battle of Hoover Dam,

824
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,860
a battle in which you get to choose a side

825
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,360
and recruit others to your cause,

826
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,860
and now even playing through the story the first time,

827
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,560
the player knows what kind of choices

828
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,060
to expect and prepare for.

829
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,860
It's a tutorial, but without telling you it's one.

830
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,860
It's very sneaky.

831
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,060
It's a bit like how in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.

832
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,560
Clear Sky you, what are you doing?

833
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Get your hands off me!

834
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,560
Anyway, now that I've created my ultimate warrior,

835
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,560
I'm ready to march straight north to New Vegas

836
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,560
and have myself a grand old time.

837
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,560
There are some radscorpions in the way,

838
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,560
but that shouldn't be so f-

839
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,060
Oh, they're really resistant to my-

840
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,060
Oh, Jesus!

841
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,060
Ah!

842
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,560
Okay, so to go through this pass,

843
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,060
I just have to defeat these tiny flies.

844
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,060
That should be fine.

Ugh!

852

Open world games where you can basically go

853
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,060
wherever you want right away are really hard

854
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,560
to give a meaningful sense of pace and challenge

855
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,560
to the point where most developers just give up

856
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,060
and make the game do it procedurally.

857
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,560
So they make enemies scale in damage and weaponry

858
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,560
in accordance with the player's level and so on.

859
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,560
This hopefully results in players being never given

860
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,060
insurmountable obstacles and never being too strong

861
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,560
that everything becomes too easy.

862
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,560
This is an okay solution,

863
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,560
but it's a solution to a problem created

864
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,060
by earlier design decisions.

865
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,060
I think a really useful pointer for this

866
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,560
comes up in original Fallout creator

867
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,560
Tim Cain's GDC retrospective.

868
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,060
He said, we don't care where people can go.

869
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,560
They can go anywhere they want.

870
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,060
If they go into some area that's too strong for them,

871
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,060
they'll get killed,

872
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,060
and then they'll learn not to go in there yet,

873
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,060
and they'll look forward to the challenge

874
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,060
of being able to go back.

875
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,060
In about a sentence,

876
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,560
Cain instantly sums up one of the most important ways

877
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,560
of giving open world games a solid relationship

878
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,560
with the player.

879
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,060
In Fallout 1, you can technically go

880
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,060
wherever you want.

881
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,060
In fact, just west of the starting area

882
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,560
is one of the final objectives,

883
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,560
and you can technically go there right away

884
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,560
and beat half the game.

885
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,060
However, if you try doing that,

886
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,560
you'll probably run into an eight-foot tall mutant

887
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,060
with heavy weaponry who can kill you instantly.

888
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:51,060
At least I made it further than Ed.

889
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,560
Now, you might call this a horrible way to die,

890
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,560
but I call it good game design.

891
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,060
It creates an immediate and direct relationship

892
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,560
between the player and the environment.

893
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,060
This is a harsh and deadly wasteland

894
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,560
that wants to kill you, and you know this now

895
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,060
because it literally has.

896
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,060
As you get stronger,

897
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,560
these areas become more manageable,

898
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
and you get to tangibly feel stronger

899
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,560
because you know how dangerous this is.

900
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,060
Blowing up the super mutant base

901
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,560
after all the times they blasted your body in half

902
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,060
or casually killed your entire party

903
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,060
feels like a real achievement now.

904
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,060
In Fallout 1, finally killing your first Deathclaw

905
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,060
is so satisfying because the first time you meet him,

906
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,060
he ruins you, but hours later,

907
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,060
you're finally ready for more,

908
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,060
and he still kills you because it's Fallout 1.

909
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,060
Try knocking him down first. That usually helps.

910
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,560
Oh, and don't use melee weapons.

911
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,060
This was a terrible idea.

912
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,060
These encounters with Deathclaws and mutants

913
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,060
sound unfair, and yeah, that's the point.

914
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,060
They give players a really textured view

915
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,560
of the game's landscape.

916
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,060
It influences the entire experience

917
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,560
to a tremendous degree.

918
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,560
When the Gunrunners say they're having trouble

919
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,060
getting weapons out to people

920
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,560
because of all the Deathclaws nearby,

921
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,060
you really feel for these guys.

922
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,560
You know in ways that are only possible

923
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,060
for someone who's been killed by one before

924
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,060
just how much it would suck to live nearby

925
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,560
a nest of these things.

926
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,560
That's rough, buddy.

927
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,060
If Deathclaws and mutants

928
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,560
and other tough enemies scaled down

929
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,560
with the player to be largely doable

930
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,560
even at low levels,

931
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,560
Fallout would lose a huge chunk

932
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,060
of what made it so compelling.

933
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,060
Deathclaws would be just another enemy.

934
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,560
This game's sense of harshness

935
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,060
makes it immensely fun to play

936
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,060
because when you win,

937
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,560
it feels like you struggled for something.

938
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,060
People tell me other games are better

939
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,060
and insist Fallout 1 has aged,

940
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,560
but there's just nothing else in games

941
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,560
quite as intense as moving across

942
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,560
the northwestern side of the world map

943
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,560
in Fallout 1.

944
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,560
♪♪

945
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,560
Oh, for fuck's sake.

946
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,060
Fallout 3 broke pretty far from this formula

947
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,060
and that means it's bad.

948
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,060
I'm joking, obviously.

949
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,560
Bethesda just have a different ethos

950
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,060
when it comes to designing worlds,

951
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,560
one which I actually think is quite nice

952
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,560
in its own way.

953
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,560
They want you to be able to go on tour

954
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,560
of their majestically massive maps

955
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,060
and serious spikes in difficulty

956
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,060
would get in the way of that.

957
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,060
I've spoken for an embarrassingly long amount

958
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,560
of time about a game I thought wasn't that great,

959
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,060
but an important thing to remember

960
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,560
is that if you approach it a certain way,

961
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,560
there is fun to be had in 3.

962
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,060
Players who ignored the main quest,

963
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,560
which wasn't that much fun anyway,

964
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,060
and just wandered around dealing

965
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,560
with whatever they happened to find,

966
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,560
doing the occasional quest here and there,

967
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,560
those people basically made their own fun

968
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,560
with the game,

969
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,560
and Fallout 3's open world and dedication

970
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,560
to not making any areas too challenging

971
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,560
even for starting players was especially conducive to this.

972
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,060
You could walk around and go wherever

973
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,060
you felt like going.

974
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,060
Now, you can criticize how this was implemented

975
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,060
or whether it fits a game set in a post-nuclear wasteland

976
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,060
as well as it fits a traditional fantasy world,

977
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,060
but either way, it resulted in a wasteland

978
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:39,060
and rambling experience a lot of people remember fondly.

979
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,560
I can criticize the story and quests in Fallout 3

980
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,560
until I'm blue in the face, and I did,

981
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,560
but once my lungs recovered and I left hospital,

982
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,560
it didn't stop the fact lots of other people

983
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,060
still had a good time with 3,

984
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,060
wandering around and just checking stuff out

985
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,060
at their own pace,

986
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,560
battling raiders and super mutants

987
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,560
and deathclaws procedurally leveled

988
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,560
to never be too challenging to stop them

989
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,060
in their personal freeform tracks.

990
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,060
Bethesda went for a particular experience

991
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,560
and in a lot of respects, they nailed it.

992
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,060
Despite being built in the same engine as Fallout 3,

993
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,560
New Vegas has an entirely different philosophy

994
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,060
in mind when it comes to its world.

995
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,060
It's a bit more like a classic RPG

996
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,560
like Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale

997
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,560
or, um, uh, Fallout.

998
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,560
It's set in a harsh environment

999
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,060
full of mutants and monsters and it means it.

1000
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,560
Cazadors, I've heard some people call them cazadores,

1001
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,060
so sorry if I'm saying it wrong,

1002
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,560
are super dangerous.

1003
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,060
Two of them can pretty consistently go toe-to-toe

1004
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,060
with a deathclaw and against humans,

1005
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,560
forget it, and they're used in a genius way.

1006
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,560
Because they're insects, they make players think

1007
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,560
of the incredibly early game bug enemies

1008
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,060
from Fallout 3 that died in one hit

1009
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,560
like radroaches and bloatflies.

1010
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,060
In fact, right before you first meet them,

1011
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,060
you pass through an area with bloatflies

1012
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,060
to lull you into a false sense of security

1013
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,060
and the landscape is perfectly arranged

1014
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,060
so when you first see them, they're far away

1015
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,060
and you assume they're small and probably weak

1016
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,560
considering the nearby enemies.

1017
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,060
By the time you get close enough

1018
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,560
to realize they're really quite big,

1019
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,060
you're already dead because they're about as fast

1020
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,560
as the trucks they hit like.

1021
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,060
This is the game playing a joke on you

1022
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,560
by messing with your expectations.

1023
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,060
The other route to New Vegas takes you

1024
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,060
through Quarry Junction which has been shut down

1025
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,560
because it's been infested with deathclaws.

1026
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,060
The first guy you run into there says,

1027
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,060
hey, buddy, uh, no.

1028
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,060
You'd have to be the meanest, toughest,

1029
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,060
roughest bastard in the wasteland

1030
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,560
to have any chance against them

1031
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,060
and I don't think that's you.

1032
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,060
And these aren't Fallout 3 deathclaws.

1033
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,560
They're somewhat manageable enemies that scale down

1034
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,560
so even at low levels, they're not too hard.

1035
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,560
These guys will kill you instantly

1036
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,060
and they do not care if you wanted

1037
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,560
to do some sightseeing here.

1038
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,560
Uh!

1039
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,560
Being absolutely obliterated at the start of the game

1040
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,560
might seem a little excessive but for me,

1041
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,060
it's like being welcomed home.

1042
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,560
Tons of areas in the Mojave Wasteland

1043
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,060
will happily kill you if you go there unprepared.

1044
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,560
You struggle and die and find new equipment

1045
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,060
and level up and as you do,

1046
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,560
you're given a very powerful sense

1047
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,060
of actually getting stronger.

1048
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:57,560
Fallout 3's heavy reliance on level scaling

1049
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,060
and deliberately not making enemies too strong

1050
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,560
solved the potential problem of players running

1051
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,560
into enemies they weren't prepared for

1052
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,060
by making everything too easy.

1053
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,060
So the player can go wherever they want

1054
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,060
but everywhere they go will be roughly the same experience

1055
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,560
with little to no sense of danger or challenge.

1056
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,560
You can walk up to a guy with a flamethrower

1057
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,560
and beat him to death with a baseball bat

1058
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,060
even at the very start of the game.

1059
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,560
Getting stronger in Fallout 3 honestly sucks.

1060
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,560
It makes a game designed to be easy even easier

1061
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,560
and after a few hours,

1062
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,560
the whole combat system is boring.

1063
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,560
No wonder millions of people downloaded the mods

1064
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,560
that make it harder.

1065
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,560
In New Vegas,

1066
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,060
you start out pretty weak and fragile

1067
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,560
and this game's raiders are setting up

1068
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,560
actual ambushes, hiding in hills with rifles,

1069
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,060
utterly tanking the damage of early game weapons.

1070
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,560
They're up on the ridge firing down at you

1071
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,560
with grenade launchers

1072
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,560
and they're setting traps for you on the road.

1073
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,560
This one actually got me.

1074
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,560
Okay, New Vegas is really amazing at using traps.

1075
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,060
Fallout 3 had some good moments with these

1076
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,560
but a lot of the time they felt like an afterthought.

1077
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,060
Like someone looked at one of the many identical offices

1078
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,060
they'd made that day and went,

1079
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,560
this needs to be more unique.

1080
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,560
Let's put some landmines in the middle of the floor

1081
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,060
you can defuse easily.

1082
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,060
There.

1083
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,060
Level design.

1084
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,060
If you have any peripheral vision,

1085
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:13,060
90% of this game's traps are just free landmines and XP.

1086
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,060
New Vegas really goes hard on making traps

1087
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,560
actually feel like traps

1088
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,060
like here with the traffic cone.

1089
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,060
I forget about these and get caught

1090
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,060
by at least one every time

1091
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,060
or two because they're so well placed

1092
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,060
that they're difficult to defuse

1093
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,560
even if you know where they are.

1094
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,060
Welcome to Nevada.

1095
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,060
Look at these easy to disarm bear traps.

1096
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,060
Oh, fuck!

1097
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,060
They're even used for environmental storytelling.

1098
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,560
Caesar's Legion are especially clever with their traps

1099
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,560
and also immensely evil.

1100
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,060
So in areas they've raided,

1101
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,560
they're hiding landmines under bodies.

1102
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,560
That's morbid.

1103
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,560
What's fantastic is the game pauses in menus

1104
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,060
so stuff like this can happen.

1105
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,060
Oh, fuck.

1106
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,060
Okay, ready?

1107
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,060
Go, go, go!

1108
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,560
No, my bones!

1109
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,560
The game is never scared to mess with you.

1110
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,060
In a cave, there's a locked gate

1111
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,560
which needs 100 lockpick skill

1112
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,060
and it has a ton of good stuff inside,

1113
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,560
so master lockpickers get some great rewards for weight.

1114
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,560
What was that sound?

1115
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,560
And what perk did I just get?

1116
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,060
That's the perk you get for breaking your limbs 50 times.

1117
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,560
Oh, no.

1118
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,560
Oh!

1119
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,560
The loot boxes and hard lockpick check

1120
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,560
distract you completely from the trip wire

1121
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,060
attached to a grenade bouquet

1122
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,560
hidden right behind the gate.

1123
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,060
You can almost hear the level designers laughing at you.

1124
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,560
This combined with the willingness

1125
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,060
to put tougher enemies in your way

1126
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,560
and make regular enemies just a bit more dangerous

1127
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,560
and clever gives the world a real feeling

1128
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,060
of being unpredictable

1129
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,560
and the extra difficulty makes the game way more fun.

1130
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,060
You've had a taste of the brick wall now

1131
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,560
and it tastes great.

1132
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,060
Being hard in places creates meaningful challenges.

1133
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,560
It gives the player something to get stronger for.

1134
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,060
Finding better guns is especially engaging here

1135
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,060
because they might really be the thing

1136
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,560
that makes the difference in combat.

1137
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,060
I have a mechanical and emotional relationship

1138
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,060
with this cool gun with the physics scribbled on the back.

1139
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,060
This thing has saved my life in a few situations.

1140
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,560
I love him and being deliberately too hard

1141
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,560
in some places creates a sense of apprehension

1142
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,060
and anticipation for what you'll run into next

1143
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,560
and if you'll be able to deal with it.

1144
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,060
This is a world where just by the wayside

1145
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,560
there's an encampment of really strong robots

1146
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,060
you're not ready to take on yet guarding some great loot

1147
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,560
you might want to try for anyway

1148
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,560
or which you'll want to come back for later

1149
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,560
and now you have something to look forward to.

1150
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,060
It's important to recognize here

1151
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,560
that none of this is really too hard.

1152
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,560
Quarry Junction isn't actually blocking you off

1153
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,560
in any way.

1154
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,060
You can sneak past the Deathclaws

1155
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,560
or master the weaponry available to you

1156
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,560
in the early game and head right to New Vegas.

1157
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,560
It's fairly tough but that's what makes doing it so fun

1158
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,060
and feel like a real achievement

1159
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,560
and if you can't make it past them right now,

1160
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,060
coming back at a higher level

1161
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,560
with better equipment and some friends,

1162
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,060
collecting their delicious eggs

1163
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,560
so the nice lady there can perfect her omelet recipe,

1164
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,060
it's just so satisfying

1165
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:48,560
because these Deathclaws started out legitimately terrifying

1166
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,560
and not, like, piss easy to kill

1167
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,560
even at the fucking start of the game.

1168
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,560
Holy shit.

1169
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,560
The sense of growth is so staggering

1170
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,560
and it feels amazing.

1171
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,560
You really feel like the meanest,

1172
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,060
toughest, the thing the guy said.

1173
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,060
You know for real how tough these guys can be

1174
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,560
and still are if you make the mistake

1175
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,560
of fast traveling into the middle of an occupied area.

1176
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,560
Oh, Jesus!

1177
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,560
This is a crunchy, yummy relationship

1178
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,560
to have with a game's world.

1179
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,560
The early difficult areas and the other spikes

1180
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,560
throughout the trip make the Mojave

1181
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,560
into a truly curious and eventful place.

1182
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,060
You genuinely don't know what to expect

1183
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,560
or if you'll be ready for it.

1184
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,560
The difficulty of the two shortest paths to Vegas

1185
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,560
incentivizes players to take the long way around

1186
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,560
which is more manageable and puts you more

1187
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,060
on the trail of the man who shot you.

1188
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,060
I mean, he's a guy in a suit with a 9mm.

1189
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,560
He couldn't even kill you with that gun.

1190
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,060
He's not taking Corrie Junction.

1191
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,560
Going this way gives you quests

1192
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,060
to learn more about who he is and where exactly he's headed.

1193
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,060
This also introduces you to the main factions

1194
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,560
you'll be dealing with in the Mojave

1195
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,060
like the NCR and Caesar's Legion

1196
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,060
and it has some companions to help you out.

1197
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,060
Thanks for taking a chance on a naive young girl

1198
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,060
from California with stars in her eyes

1199
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,060
and a pneumatic gauntlet on her hand.

1200
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,060
Using challenges only more advanced players

1201
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,560
will be able to get past,

1202
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,060
the game is giving beginners a strong gameplay

1203
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,060
and narrative experience that helps them

1204
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,060
get their bearings, get a little stronger,

1205
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,560
and learn more of the details of the setting and plot.

1206
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,060
And while there are quests leading you

1207
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,060
through the main areas on the long way to Vegas,

1208
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,060
what's great is you can find these places

1209
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,060
without ever needing to follow a quest marker.

1210
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,560
To make the journey feel more like a trip

1211
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,060
you chose to go on with places

1212
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,560
you just happened across on the way,

1213
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,560
the developers have used really clever world design

1214
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,560
to make its key locations stick out on their own

1215
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,560
and naturally attract players.

1216
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,560
You can get sent to the RepCon facility

1217
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,560
as part of the main quest,

1218
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,560
but you might also find it by yourself.

1219
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,560
It's a huge rocket silo with a big building

1220
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,060
with a model rocket outside.

1221
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,560
It's pretty easy to see it from elsewhere

1222
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,560
and wonder what it is.

1223
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,060
The story directs you to Prim,

1224
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,560
but even if you ignore the story

1225
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,560
and you're just walking around,

1226
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,060
you're gonna see the huge roller coaster

1227
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,560
and wanna go see what's up.

1228
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,060
The game's just begging you to come in

1229
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,560
and look around and find the other robot cowboy.

1230
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,560
Yeah!

1231
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,060
And when you're in the southern part of the map,

1232
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,560
it's hard not to see the giant sculpture

1233
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,060
of two rangers shaking hands

1234
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,060
and go find the NCR base up there.

1235
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,560
Fucking monument.

1236
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,060
And almost everywhere you can see the Lucky 38,

1237
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,560
one of the most important locations in the game.

1238
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,560
The Strip is one of the few places in the world

1239
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,560
lit up at night.

1240
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,560
It's visible almost anywhere on the map

1241
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,560
staring at you, waiting for you.

1242
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,060
Oh, mate, where's me platinum chip?

1243
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,060
Pfft.

1244
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,060
One thing that we learned

1245
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,060
by looking at Fallout 3,

1246
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,060
they try to make sure that there's always

1247
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,560
at least three landmarks visible.

1248
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,060
The developers credit Fallout 3 for giving them this idea,

1249
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,060
and there are some places

1250
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,060
that really do visually stick out well in 3,

1251
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,060
like there's Tenpenny Tower, Megaton,

1252
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,560
uh, the big boy overlooking Paradise Falls.

1253
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,060
Big boy man. I forget his name.

1254
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,060
There's definitely some good points of interest here,

1255
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,060
but New Vegas really pushes this into overdrive.

1256
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,560
Maybe you didn't find Novak

1257
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,060
because anyone in your travels

1258
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,560
happened to mention Novak.

1259
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,560
Maybe you just found a giant model dinosaur

1260
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,060
and wanted to see what was up.

1261
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,560
Head north toward Novak.

1262
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,560
Look for a big dinosaur. Can't miss it.

1263
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,060
Dinky the Dinosaur is based on two actual dinosaurs

1264
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,060
out in the desert.

1265
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,560
Well, not actual dinosaurs. They're models.

1266
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,060
There's this one, Mr. X,

1267
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,060
and the other one, Dinny the Dinosaur.

1268
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,560
It's cute, but it's also inspired

1269
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,060
by another real-life location.

1270
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,560
Baker on the road to Nevada

1271
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,560
is home to the world's largest thermometer.

1272
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,060
Here I am in 2019 having a great time.

1273
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,060
I mean, what did I expect?

1274
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,560
It's literally called Baker.

1275
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,060
I know it's named after someone.

1276
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,060
So Dinky the Dinosaur also doubles

1277
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,060
as the world's second largest thermometer.

1278
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,560
Now here's the really clever thing

1279
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,060
about making this cool place that sticks out.

1280
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,060
This is where you continue the main quest

1281
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,560
and find a potential party member.

1282
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,560
No, not a building in the same area.

1283
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,060
Literally this dinosaur.

1284
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,560
If you go inside Dinky,

1285
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,560
you'll find either Manny or Boone on guard in his mouth.

1286
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,060
Using just clever visual design

1287
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,560
by building a cool dinosaur,

1288
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,560
the game is saying,

1289
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,060
hey, come check this out, pal.

1290
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,060
There's some fun stuff here.

1291
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,560
Let's talk about how important

1292
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,060
this kind of world design is.

1293
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,060
Imagine four programmers on the edge of a cliff.

1294
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,560
Game design works the same way.

1295
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,560
♪ I waited but you must have lost your way ♪

1296
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,560
Is there a plane going overhead right as I start recording?

1297
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,060
Okay, it's gone. Right.

1298
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,060
There's another big problem open world games

1299
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,560
that give the player a lot of freedom have to solve.

1300
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,060
Your game could have a bunch of great stuff in it

1301
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,560
only for players to miss most of it

1302
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,060
and get bored and assume there's not much to find.

1303
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,060
I call this the onboarding problem.

1304
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,060
If players can go anywhere and do anything,

1305
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,060
how do you help them find all the cool stuff you made?

1306
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,060
While quest markers and railroad-y stories

1307
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:17,060
can help make sure most people find the core stuff,

1308
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,560
what about all the side content?

1309
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,060
I think a good case study here is Fallout 3

1310
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,560
because like I said, 3 has some great stuff in it.

1311
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,560
Some of the quests,

1312
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,060
the superheroes in Canterbury Commons,

1313
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,560
finding a violin for Agatha,

1314
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,060
and deciding the fate of the Oasis

1315
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,560
are interesting and often meaningful stories.

1316
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,060
They're genuinely good quests.

1317
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,060
If you can find them.

1318
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,060
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

1319
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,060
Fallout 3 has some well-designed quests

1320
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:43,060
but its world design leaves a lot to be desired.

1321
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,560
Many of its best locations are often strange places

1322
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,060
that are hard for players to reasonably find on their own

1323
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,560
and in many cases nowhere in the game world

1324
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,060
ever tells you about them.

1325
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,560
The Oasis is hidden at the far north edge of the map

1326
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,560
and obscured by a bunch of rocks.

1327
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,060
The only help the player is given in finding this quest

1328
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,560
is there's this one weird sniper guy

1329
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,560
in the middle of nowhere

1330
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,560
with the address on his body if you kill him.

1331
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,060
The Fallout wiki insists there are random encounters

1332
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,560
that can point you towards it

1333
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,560
so the game decides at random

1334
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,560
if it's going to show you the cool quest.

1335
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,060
There's a really good reason

1336
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,060
why most players remember Tenpenny Tower

1337
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,060
and that's because A, it's a big tower.

1338
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,560
People are gonna find it, and two,

1339
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,060
there's a guy in the first location you go to

1340
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,560
in the main quest sitting in the corner going,

1341
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,560
hey, come over here,

1342
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,560
and he tells you about Tenpenny Tower.

1343
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,060
Look, just tell people where the fun quests are

1344
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:31,060
or at least don't make finding out about them random.

1345
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,060
Canterbury Commons is a tiny town

1346
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,060
in the middle of nowhere that's easy to miss

1347
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,560
and the most interesting solution to the superhero quest

1348
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,560
requires having found a page of text

1349
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,060
on a specific computer

1350
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,060
in a building on the other side of the world.

1351
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,060
At no point does anyone or anything

1352
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,060
mention you can do this.

1353
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,060
I'm literally gobsmacked.

1354
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,060
Ow.

1355
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,060
Fallout 3 is a really fun game

1356
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,060
to read the wiki about and find out how fun

1357
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,060
it might have been if players could find

1358
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,060
half of this shit while they were actually playing it.

1359
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:02,060
There's very little onboarding to quests in 3.

1360
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,060
The good content, which is in the game,

1361
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,060
is effectively hidden from players

1362
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,060
unless they happen to run into it

1363
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,560
far off the beaten track.

1364
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,060
The violin quest is great,

1365
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,560
but starting it means finding a secluded house

1366
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,060
in the middle of nowhere.

1367
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,060
I've discussed this game with friends a lot over the years

1368
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,560
and when I bring this quest up,

1369
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,560
over half the people I talk to say,

1370
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,060
I didn't know about that quest.

1371
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,560
The only way to get involved

1372
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,560
in one of the best things in the game

1373
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,560
is to just happen to stumble onto it

1374
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,560
in the middle of a massive wasteland

1375
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,060
and a huge portion of players never even knew it was there.

1376
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,060
It's such a shame.

1377
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:34,560
Can you imagine making the best,

1378
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,560
most heartfelt quest in the game

1379
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,060
and discovering the surrounding world

1380
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,560
was designed to make it incredibly difficult to find?

1381
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,060
Whoever made that quest should be given a gun.

1382
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:46,060
Fallout New Vegas uses a radical new technique

1383
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,560
called game design

1384
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,060
to ensure that players find all of its cool stuff.

1385
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,060
Remember when I said six quests

1386
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,560
send you to Vault 22?

1387
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,560
That's just the tip of the questberg.

1388
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,060
One of the many cool as hell locations in New Vegas

1389
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,060
is the Helios One solar power plant

1390
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,560
which the player can talk their way into

1391
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,560
and initiate a quest to help get up and running

1392
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,560
and then get to decide where to send the power.

1393
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,560
In addition to being a giant cool building

1394
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,560
with a big sign and a huge solar panel array

1395
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,060
which is very easy to find just by walking around,

1396
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,060
three other quests also take you here

1397
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:16,060
while you're doing them which gives you an opportunity

1398
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,060
to find this one.

1399
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:19,060
For example, this guy, Michelangelo at Vegas,

1400
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,060
gives you a camera and asks you to take pictures

1401
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,560
of some cool signs he's heard of,

1402
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,560
a quest which leads you to five locations

1403
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,060
including Helios One.

1404
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,060
Quests like this are basically the developers

1405
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,560
handing you a juicy list of places to go

1406
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,560
and stuff to do.

1407
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,060
No wiki required, baby.

1408
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,060
The game will show you a good time instead.

1409
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,060
One of the game's companions, Veronica,

1410
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,560
is a member of the Brotherhood of Steel

1411
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,060
and if she sees enough interesting things

1412
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,060
while traveling with you,

1413
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:43,560
eventually she asks you to help her find some technology

1414
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,060
which might help her change the mind

1415
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,060
of the Brotherhood of Steel elder.

1416
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,560
The computer which points her

1417
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,060
in the direction of this tech leads you

1418
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,560
to three different places

1419
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,060
with their own solutions to the quest,

1420
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,560
one of which is Helios One,

1421
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,060
and another one, for the record,

1422
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,560
is this guy's office where he sends you to Vault 22.

1423
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,060
This game's quests,

1424
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,060
in addition to being fun and interesting

1425
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,560
and often thought-provoking,

1426
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,060
are also designed to be found.

1427
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,060
This ensures that players get to see

1428
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,560
all the fun stuff in the game and,

1429
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,060
and this is really clever,

1430
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,560
it helps to create the sense of a cohesive world

1431
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,060
because going to Helios One

1432
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:16,060
has consequences for other quests.

1433
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,560
One group we'll get to later

1434
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,060
need to repair their solar panels

1435
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,060
and if the player's been to Helios before,

1436
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,060
they can mention they've been there

1437
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,060
and salvaging some panels from Helios One

1438
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,060
becomes an optional solution to the quest.

1439
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,060
It creates a cool sense of taking part

1440
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,560
in a cumulative and reactive story.

1441
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,060
You're being given an alternative solution

1442
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,560
to a quest specifically because you have knowledge

1443
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,060
of a place with a bunch of solar panels.

1444
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,060
I just can't get over how cool it is

1445
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,060
that the player is never put in a situation

1446
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,560
where they have to find the fun.

1447
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,060
You can hardly go anywhere

1448
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,560
without learning even more things

1449
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,560
to chase up later or picking something up

1450
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,060
that comes in handy somewhere else.

1451
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:51,060
It contributes to what's still the most alive feeling

1452
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,560
and reactive world there is.

1453
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,060
I'm utterly astounded by wha-

1454
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,060
Hello there.

1455
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:57,060
Ah! Malcolm, you scared me!

1456
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,060
This one random line from an NCR guy

1457
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,560
really sums up New Vegas's design philosophy.

1458
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,560
It's really hard to miss all of the great locations

1459
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,060
and quests in New Vegas and that's wonderful.

1460
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,060
The quest you get from visiting the dinosaur

1461
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:13,060
is really cool too or should I say really ghoul?

1462
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,060
I shouldn't.

1463
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,060
Manny, a guy who has info

1464
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,560
on the man in the checkered suit,

1465
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,060
won't tell you what he knows until you go deal

1466
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,060
with the ghouls at the rep contesting facility

1467
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,560
and the ghouls there turn out to be a cool, weird cult

1468
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,560
with a bunch of fun characters to deal with.

1469
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,560
God, but are you ugly?

1470
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,560
It's also pretty challenging in the early game.

1471
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,060
It's a great place to get beaten to death

1472
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,560
by invisible super mutants.

1473
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,060
Helping them finish their rocket

1474
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,560
and blast off to their supposed promised land,

1475
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,060
making a last minute course correction

1476
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,060
so they're more likely to get wherever they're going

1477
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,060
before you activate the launch,

1478
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,560
or maybe you want to play a fun prank

1479
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,060
on your new friends, you little stinker,

1480
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:46,060
is a really fun reward for coming here on its own,

1481
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,060
never mind the fact it'll get Manny to help you,

1482
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,060
and what makes this feel even more heroic

1483
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:53,560
is the fact that I really was doing them a favor by choice

1484
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,560
because you don't have to do this quest

1485
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,560
to progress the story.

1486
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,560
I mean, you could just talk him into telling you

1487
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,560
or pickpocket the information off him

1488
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,060
or kill him and get the same information off his corpse.

1489
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:07,560
Or you could just check out his computer in his room.

1490
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,560
I love computers.

1491
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,560
When a character has a quest for you in New Vegas,

1492
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,060
it's always optional.

1493
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,060
It's really just an invitation

1494
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:15,560
to take part in a cool quest if you want to.

1495
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,060
Hell, even killing all of the ghouls

1496
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,560
because you don't want to do their quest

1497
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,060
and then coming back counts as far as Manny's concerned.

1498
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,560
He just wants the ghouls out of there.

1499
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,060
There are so many ways around doing this quest.

1500
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,560
Okay, I'm done beating around the bush.

1501
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,560
Let's talk about the absurd level of control

1502
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,560
the player has over the direction of the story.

1503
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,560
But first, don't forget to smash that like button.

1504
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,560
♪♪

1505
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,560
There's a fairly important character in Fallout 3

1506
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,560
called Three Dog.

1507
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,060
He has info on where your father went

1508
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,560
and to get it, you either have to do

1509
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,060
a really boring quest for him or pass a speech check

1510
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,560
which you can still fail if you blah, blah, blah.

1511
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,560
You've heard this bit.

1512
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,560
But something I really like about Three

1513
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,060
is that if you kill Three Dog,

1514
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,560
this is for demonstration purposes.

1515
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,560
Under no circumstances should you kill Three Dog,

1516
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,060
before learning what he knows,

1517
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,060
the game's main quest updates to say,

1518
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:01,560
uh, all right, find your dad somewhere, I guess.

1519
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,560
Good luck!

1520
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,560
And you no longer have an objective marker

1521
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,560
telling you where to go because you don't know.

1522
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,560
This wouldn't be a super great quest to go on

1523
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,060
since as previously discussed,

1524
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:12,060
Fallout 3 has a significant problem

1525
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,560
showing you where to find things,

1526
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,060
but this willingness to let the player mess this quest up

1527
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,060
this badly and account for that is still pretty cool.

1528
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,560
The sad thing is Three Dog is one of the few characters

1529
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,560
in the game that you can do this with.

1530
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,060
Some of the Brotherhood of Steel members

1531
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,560
right outside his office

1532
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,560
are for some reason too important to die.

1533
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,060
So if you nuke them all to take their stuff,

1534
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,560
a couple of them just get back up

1535
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,560
and aren't even hostile toward you.

1536
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,060
After all, they need to complete

1537
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,060
the main quest for you later.

1538
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,060
The Brotherhood of Steel are just too important

1539
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,560
for their part of the story to change,

1540
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,060
so the game says no.

1541
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,060
They're literally fucking invincible.

1542
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,560
You can't even...ugh!

1543
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,060
I'm having trouble believing I'm the master

1544
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,560
of my own destiny here,

1545
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,560
and I think this points towards an obvious solution.

1546
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,060
Make it possible to kill all these characters.

1547
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,060
Give the story ways of accounting for that,

1548
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,060
but that would be an absurd amount of work.

1549
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,560
Sure, it would be cool to have that level

1550
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,060
of control and freedom,

1551
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:02,560
but what sort of game could possibly...

1552
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,060
Okay, so in New Vegas, you can kill everyone.

1553
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,060
That's right. I didn't just mean you can kill many.

1554
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,560
I meant everyone.

1555
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,560
Everyone!

1556
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,560
Except for children.

1557
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,060
You have to wait for them to get older.

1558
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,560
Oh, I'm coming for you, MacReady.

1559
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,560
One of the game's most impressive achievements

1560
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,060
is that even though its story is incredibly well-written,

1561
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,560
it's also designed to account

1562
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,560
for the player killing anyone in it.

1563
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,060
Sometimes the plot does without characters in simple ways

1564
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,060
like having notes and diaries on their corpses

1565
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,560
in case they die.

1566
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,060
Sometimes, though, it's incredibly complicated.

1567
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,060
Like, if you kill Caesar, tons of characters

1568
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:32,060
have things to say about his death.

1569
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,560
Hey, you're the one who slayed Caesar.

1570
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,560
That son of a bitch had it coming.

1571
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,060
Wish I could have been there to see Caesar die.

1572
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,060
What an asshole.

1573
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,560
If we weren't in con territory,

1574
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,060
I would kill you where you stand.

1575
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,060
Caesar will be avenged.

1576
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,560
And his death and the fact you killed him

1577
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,060
are even things you can bring up in important dialogues.

1578
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,060
Nobody springs back to life

1579
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:53,060
because otherwise the story wouldn't work.

1580
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:55,060
Don't want to do a quest for someone for information?

1581
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,060
Fuck him.

1582
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,560
Deputy Beagle needs rescuing

1583
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,560
before he'll tell you where the man who shot you went?

1584
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,560
Nah, that's all right. Good luck.

1585
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,560
Don't like the imposing weirdo telling you

1586
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,060
how cool the Legion is and then walking off dramatically?

1587
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:08,560
Yeah, he's just too important.

1588
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,060
If you shoot him, he takes a knee

1589
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,560
and revives after a few seconds.

1590
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,560
You can only kill him at the end of a really long,

1591
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,560
boring, multi-stage quest.

1592
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,060
Just kidding! Fucking blow him up!

1593
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,560
He's dead!

1594
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,060
He's supposed to come talk to you later

1595
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,560
during the main quest and now the Legion

1596
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,060
has to send someone else to do it.

1597
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,560
The replacement even mentions they had to do this.

1598
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:27,060
Your crimes against the Legion,

1599
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,560
including the death of the fearless

1600
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,060
Wulpes Inculta are hereby forgiven.

1601
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:33,060
The level of choice you have goes much deeper

1602
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,060
than this, though.

1603
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:35,560
Once you make it to Vegas either

1604
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,560
by taking the long way around following Benny's trail

1605
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,060
or by getting there right away

1606
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,560
by being a total badass,

1607
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,060
you learn how pivotal the platinum chip Benny stole

1608
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,060
is to shifting the balance of power,

1609
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:48,060
and you fall into the multifactional struggle

1610
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:50,060
for control of the Vegas Strip and the Hoover Dam.

1611
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,060
Finding out who Benny is and getting

1612
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:54,060
to the new Vegas Strip and meeting its master,

1613
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:56,560
Mr. House, is just act one of the story.

1614
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:59,060
The other two-thirds can play out completely differently

1615
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,560
depending on which faction you decide

1616
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,560
to align yourself with.

1617
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,060
The NCR want to strengthen their hold

1618
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,060
on Hoover Dam, recruit some outside factions

1619
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,060
to help out, knock House out of the picture,

1620
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:08,560
and gain control of New Vegas.

1621
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,560
Caesar's Legion wants to weaken the NCR,

1622
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:13,060
kill House, and take the dam and Vegas for themselves.

1623
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,060
Mr. House, the Strip's current owner,

1624
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:17,060
is a libertarian so he wants to lower the age of consent,

1625
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:20,060
wants to turn New Vegas into a proper free economic zone,

1626
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,560
and use the chip to make his robot army powerful enough

1627
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,060
to kick both factions out.

1628
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:25,560
You can even pick a fourth faction,

1629
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,060
none of the above, and use Benny's pet robot,

1630
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:30,560
Yes Man, to hijack Mr. House's plan for yourself.

1631
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,560
I mean, Yes Man won't judge you.

1632
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,060
Well, he will but he's not allowed to say it.

1633
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,560
I'm gonna help you accomplish so much

1634
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,060
whether I want to or not.

1635
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,560
So you have all these factions prepping

1636
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,060
for the Battle of Hoover Dam

1637
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,060
and you're here figuring out who you want to side with

1638
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:45,060
but even then, player freedom doesn't end

1639
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,560
with the choice of what side to take.

1640
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,560
Let's say you're doing the main quest for the NCR

1641
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,060
and they ask you to help recruit the Boomers to their cause.

1642
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:53,060
So you go to meet the Boomers and their leader is like,

1643
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:55,560
okay, look, do some stuff for us and we'll think about it.

1644
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,060
Ooh, help fix our power generator.

1645
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,560
Oh, our solar panel.

1646
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,560
Help me get a girlfriend.

1647
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,060
Um, find my teddy bear.

1648
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,560
Great, yeah, and then you're sitting through a kid

1649

telling you his people's history

1650
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,560
and you realize they're just awful.

1651
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,060
Like, they're heavily armed reclusives

1652
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:10,060
who want to live in seclusion forever,

1653
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,560
viewing everyone different from them as backwoods savages

1654
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,560

you'll notice the farmers at some NCR-run farms

1769
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,560
are complaining about not getting enough water

1770
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:09,560

1771
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,060
because they can't meet their crop quotas.

to the parts of New Vegas that aren't run by the NCR

1774
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,560
where independent folks have successfully started

1775
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,060

1776
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,060
to help support themselves and prevent the NCR

1777
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,560
muscling in under the pretense of feeding everyone.

1778
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,560
A farm in the Wasteland is obviously a great thing,

1779
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,060

1781
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,060
but if you do a little digging,

1782
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:34,060
you learn the farm is run with the help of water

1783
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:36,060
someone is siphoning off from the pipes

1784
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,560
meant for the NCR farmers,

1785
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,560
and the player has the option of telling on them

1786
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,060
and having the water cut off.

1787
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:44,060
So what is the actual right thing to do here?

1788
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:47,060
Are you supposed to shut it off and let a farm die

1789
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:49,060
and its people suffer because someone

1790
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,560
technically stole the water,

1791
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,560
or are you supposed to let the NCR's farmers

1792
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,560
not get all the water they were promised

1793
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,060
just because you don't want to cut off someone else

1794
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:58,560
who isn't even supposed to be using it?

1795
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:01,060
Also, it's a bit more complicated than I let on

1796
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,560
because an NCR soldier had been looking

1797
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,560
into the water shortage and went missing.

1798
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,560
When you talk Tom Anderson into admitting

1799
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:09,060
he stole the water, he also admits he killed the guy

1800
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,560
when he found out to try to cover up the theft.

1801
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,560
Turning him in for his crime means the water

1802
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,060
will be cut off for sure,

1803
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,560
and West Side will suffer greatly.

1804
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,560
The worst thing is, Anderson clearly regrets doing it,

1805
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:22,060
and if you turn him in for this, it'll all be for nothing.

1806
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:24,060
Alternatively, you can cover up the death

1807
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:26,560
and pin it on a gang, but this means a murder

1808
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:29,560
is never brought to justice, and if you do this,

1809
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,560
later one of their farmers tells you he's heading back

1810
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,560
to California because he's about to be fired

1811
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:36,060
for not meeting a quota he can't possibly meet

1812
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,560
with the water he's getting.

1813
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,560
Trying to help the people who need it more

1814
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,060
ruins several other people and requires you

1815
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:43,560
to help cover up a murder.

1816
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,560
Even if a person decides what they think

1817
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,560
is the right thing to do here, they still have to live

1818
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:50,060
with the people who get hurt as a result of that choice,

1819
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:52,060
and I'm sure there are players who think

1820
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:54,060
they know the objectively correct thing

1821
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:56,060
to do about the water in this situation,

1822
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:58,060
but the point here is not everyone

1823
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:59,560
will agree on what that is.

1824
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,560
You as a person have to choose

1825
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,060
what you believe is the right thing to do.

1826
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,560
This is incredibly involving because it makes

1827
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,560
the player actually think about the world

1828
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,060
and their impact on it.

1829
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:12,060
There's no huge far-reaching consequences

1830
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,560
for this decision like the death

1831
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,060
of a town you could have visited.

1832
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:17,060
There's no secret better solution as a reward

1833
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:20,060
for happening to visit the one computer in the world

1834
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:21,560
with relevant info on it.

1835
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,060
The game doesn't need gimmicks like this

1836
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:25,060
to make the quest engage with players

1837
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:28,060
because at its core is a really interesting question

1838
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:30,560
which requires the player to decide for themselves

1839
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,060
what the right thing is.

1840
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:34,560
This is more than a chance to be good or bad

1841
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,060
and see what happens.

1842
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,560
It's an opportunity to figure out

1843
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:40,560
how you would really act in a situation like this,

1844
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,060
and questions like this are happening

1845
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,560
on a constant basis here.

1846
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:46,560
Is it a good idea to preserve incredibly dangerous

1847
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,060
but potentially useful research

1848
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:49,060
by putting it in the hands

1849
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,560
of a self-interested politician?

1850
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,560
Who should receive the power from Helios I

1851
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,060
if you get it up and running?

1852
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:55,560
The people who need it most?

1853
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,560
The people the NCR tells you to give it to?

1854
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,560
Or maybe everyone should get a little bit

1855
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,560
but not really enough to help anyone.

1856
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:04,060
There's even a really tantalizing selfish choice.

1857
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:07,060
A kid on the streets of Vegas sells you a toy gun he found,

1858
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:08,060
and if you're paying attention,

1859
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,560
the gun is actually the targeting system

1860
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:13,060
for an orbital laser which you can power instead.

1861
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:14,560
So now you can do this.

I utterly love the game's ability

1874
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,060
to give you the freedom to do whatever you want

1875
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,560
including just killing everyone in the wasteland

1876

When the NCR tell you to recruit the Boomers

even though none of them actually went,

you have to ask yourself if you think

1886
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,060
recruiting them is a good idea.

1887
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,560
Is their help worth getting their facilities

1888
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,060
back up and running and getting them a weapon

1889
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,060
capable of realizing their vision?

1890
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:10,560
Or is this compromise necessary for the greater good?

1891
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,560
Or could working with the NCR give them a chance

1892
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:15,060
to open up and develop a healthier relationship

1893
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:17,060
with the outside world because doing quests for them

1894
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:19,060
isn't the only option to progress the story.

1895
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:21,060
You have plenty of chances to ask yourself

1896
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:22,560
how you want to deal with them.

1897
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,060
Well, spoilers, this is footage

1898
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:26,060
from my evil Legion playthrough.

1899
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:28,560
They don't give a shit what faction you're aligned with.

1900
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,060
Once you do a few things for them,

1901
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,560
they'll work with NCR or the Legion if you ask.

1902
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:35,060
Sure, we'll depose a democratically elected government.

1903
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:36,560
It's basically all we do,

1904
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,560
but first how do I change the wallpaper on my phone?

1905
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:41,060
Later the NCR tell you to wipe out the Great Khans.

1906
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:43,060
The Khans are a nuisance to the NCR

1907
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,560
and have an allegiance with Caesar,

1908
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,060
but it's a shaky one.

1909
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,060
If you know the Legion, you know the main thing they do

1910
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:50,560
is conquer other tribes and annihilate their identities

1911
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,560
so you can start talking their leadership

1912
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,060
into not wanting to work with Caesar.

1913
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:56,060
The fact you can use pretty simple diplomacy

1914
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,060
to get the Khans to change their minds

1915
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:00,060
is a pretty serious criticism of the NCR.

1916
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:02,060
I mean, they just asked you to kill them all for them.

1917
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:04,060
They're basically an organized family

1918
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,560
of drug-dealing raiders,

1919
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,060
but does that mean it's okay to wipe them all out?

1920
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:10,060
Will you do what the NCR wants

1921
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:11,560
to help them hold the Hoover Dam?

1922
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:14,560
And in the big picture, which faction should you side with?

1923
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,060
What's the right answer?

1924
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,560
I think the degree to which these questions

1925
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,060
are compelling is evident

1926
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:20,560
in how much longevity they've had.

1927
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,560
I've seen people argue online for a decade now

1928
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,060
that the independent route

1929
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:25,560
is the only morally good option,

1930
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:28,060
and I've also seen others say those people

1931
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:30,060
are naive and doomed to be destroyed

1932
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:32,060
by the much larger factions,

1933
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,560
and it's better to do your best to support the NCR

1934
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,060
and try to help them improve

1935
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:37,560
because there's no other suitable

1936
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,060
long-term power structure,

1937
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:40,060
and for all their problems,

1938
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,560
pissing them off and going rogue

1939
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:44,060
is not a real solution to the fact you don't like them.

1940
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:45,560
Arguments about sides in this struggle

1941
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,060
are often deeply heated

1942
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:49,560
because they tie into people's actual understandings

1943
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,060
of the world around them,

1944
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:52,560
their socio-political beliefs,

1945
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,560
and their personal sense of pragmatism.

1946
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:57,060
Being questioned on these levels by a computer game

1947
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:59,560
is basically still largely unheard of.

1948
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,560
The rare occasions a game really goes

1949
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,060
for exploring these ideas,

1950
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:04,560
it sweeps the game awards

1951
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,060
and instantly becomes a modern classic.

1952
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:08,060
Meanwhile, other games are still in the paddling pool

1953
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:11,060
of, like, oh, was it bad to murder a bunch of people

1954
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,060
with a knife?

1955
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:13,060
A lot of people think politics

1956
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:14,560
can be a turn-off for gamers,

1957
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,060
but I've done some research and discovered

1958
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:18,060
that politics is objectively fun

1959
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:20,060
and all gamers love it all the time,

1960
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,560
and the people who say they hate seeing them in games

1961
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,560
actually love politics even more.

1962
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,560
They just wish they were seeing different politics.

1963
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,060
This might just be my opinion,

1964
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:28,560
but I think it's good when video games

1965
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:31,060
are about something and have ideas.

1966
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:33,560
No one's going to rethink any aspect of their life

1967
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:36,560
because of the story of Uncharted sponsored by Subway.

1968
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,060
There's a reason why the best narrative games

1969
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:40,560
are made by people who take big ideas seriously enough

1970
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,060
to actually reckon with them.

1971
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,560
The kind of people badass enough

1972
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:46,560
to name drop Marx and Engels in their victory speech.

1973
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:49,060
And Marx and Engels for providing us

1974
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:50,560
the political education.

1975
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,560
Thank you.

1976
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,560
Thank you.

1977
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,560
Thank you.

1978
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,060
You don't see stuff like that normally

1979
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,060
at hashtag the game awards.

1980
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:58,560
Also sponsored by Subway.

1981
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:01,060
Fresh indie game presented by Subway.

1982
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:02,560
Fresh indie game?

1983
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,060
More like eat fresh indie.

1984
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:05,560
Ah, fucking slit my throat.

1985
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,560
Clear cut.

1986
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,060
Wow, can you tell I'm from Yorkshire?

1987
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:11,060
Clear cut good versus evil choices are easy

1988
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:12,560
and require little to no thinking.

1989
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:15,560
So no matter how fun it is to be evil in your game

1990
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,060
or how nice it feels to be good,

1991
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:19,560
the moral decision itself isn't engaging.

1992
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,560
When you give someone a choice

1993
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,560
where there's no easy right answer

1994
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,060
or where the right thing in the situation

1995
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:26,060
is complicated enough that different people

1996
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:27,060
will have different answers,

1997
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:28,560
you've given people something

1998
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,560
truly gripping to think about.

1999
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,560
The NCR seem like the obvious good guys

2000
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,060
compared to Caesar's Legion,

2001
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,560
a fascist tribe of ancient Rome cosplayers

2002
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:39,060
going around crucifying and enslaving people,

2003
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:41,060
but half the game is spent dealing with the fact

2004
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:43,060
the NCR just aren't that great either.

2005
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,560
A lot of areas here are independent

2006
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,560
and really aren't into the idea of being annexed

2007
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,060
by these outsiders coming in

2008
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:50,060
declaring themselves the government.

2009
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:52,060
Towns like Goodsprings and Prim

2010
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:54,060
don't stay independent for long,

2011
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:57,060
not if you've got something the NCR wants.

2012
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:59,560
One of the first characters you meet, Sunny Smiles,

2013
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:02,060
says that she's heard a lot of bad shit about the Legion

2014
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:03,560
but mostly from the NCR,

2015
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,060
and as far as she knows,

2016
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:07,060
they could just be making that up to justify being here.

2017
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:09,060
The NCR are doing poorly in the region

2018
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:11,060
because of a lot of internal politicking.

2019
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:13,060
The Republic's senators want to keep their seats

2020
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:15,560
and aren't interested in supporting an unpopular war.

2021
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,560
The best troops are off fighting other battles,

2022
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,060
including defending the interests

2023
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:21,560
of the rich Brahmin barons who have a lot of sway.

2024
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:24,060
Almost every soldier or ranger you run into

2025
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,060
has a story about being stretched too thin,

2026
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:27,560
not having the supplies they need,

2027
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,560
the enemy being stronger than they were told.

2028
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:31,560
The horribly understaffed correctional facility

2029
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:34,060
has long since been taken over by its own prisoners.

2030
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:37,060
Their quarries are full of guys sitting and waiting for help

2031
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:39,060
because no one's dealing with the Deathclaws.

2032
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:41,560
There's, like, five different gangs of raiders in the area,

2033
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:43,560
so they're not really keeping the peace too well.

2034
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,060
They just don't have the manpower

2035
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:46,560
to deal with all these problems.

2036
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,560
The fact there are so many quests you can do for them

2037
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,560
is actually a really important plot point.

2038
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:53,060
They're so overrun, they're farming out stuff

2039
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:54,560
that needs doing to whoever comes along

2040
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,060
and offers to lend a hand.

2041
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:58,060
The NCR are certainly not doing a good job

2042
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,060
of proving that their society works,

2043
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:02,060
and it's not like they have clean hands here anyway.

2044
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:04,060
One of the main reasons the Khans are willing to join

2045
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:05,560
with Caesar to fight the NCR

2046
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:07,560
is because the NCR massacred a bunch of them.

2047
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,060
The Khans haven't been the good guys

2048
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:10,560
in any of the Fallout games,

2049
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,560
but they have a lot of legitimate grievances

2050
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,060
and reasons to want to harm the Republic.

2051
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:15,560
For the supposed good guys,

2052
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,060
the NCR really love killing and subjugating

2053
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:19,060
anything in their way.

2054
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:20,560
Over on the western side of the map,

2055
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,060
they're hiring mercenaries to harass

2056
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:24,060
the peaceful super mutants into a fight

2057
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:25,560
so they can justify killing them off

2058
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,060
or driving them away.

2059
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:29,560
The NCR's the biggest gang of thieves in the Mojave.

2060
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,560
Only difference is they pass laws

2061
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,060
to make their crimes legal before they commit them.

2062
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:35,560
Almost every group in New Vegas

2063
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,060
is attempting to rebuild the world

2064
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:38,560
in the image of one that came before.

2065
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,060
The NCR are obviously emulating the United States,

2066
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:43,060
a society that had its upsides, sure,

2067
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:45,060
but which also destroyed the world

2068
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:46,560
and in the game as well.

2069
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,060
The NCR's problems are mirrors

2070
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:50,060
of real world society's problems

2071
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:52,060
because that's what they're trying to build

2072
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:54,560
and doing their best to replicate the power structure

2073
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,560
of a society that ended in nuclear Armageddon

2074
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,060
is a bit of an ambiguous idea, isn't it?

2075
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:01,060
Democracy's good, but this entire series

2076
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:03,560
is all about the, well, fallout

2077
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,060
of that system's failures.

2078
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:07,560
If you want to see the fate of democracies,

2079
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,060
look out the windows.

2080
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:10,560
If you decide to help them,

2081
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,060
you have to compromise your values

2082
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:14,060
in the hopes that eventually they'll work things out.

2083
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:16,060
I think this is a reason why so many people

2084
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:18,060
think the independent option is better.

2085
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:19,560
Like, if you're going your own way,

2086
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,060
you don't have to answer to these fuckers.

2087
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,560
Caesar's Legion, on the other hand,

2088
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,060
are a really interesting faction

2089
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:26,060
because despite being basically awful,

2090
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:27,560
the more you learn about them,

2091
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,560
the more you understand why they're like this.

2092
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,560
Caesar is obviously trying to rebuild things

2093
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:33,060
more in the image of ancient Rome,

2094
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:35,060
a society which, for all its problems,

2095
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:37,060
lasted a long time in some form or another

2096
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:40,560
and also, minor point, didn't destroy the entire world.

2097
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,560
The early Romans built a civilization

2098
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:44,560
out of what was basically nothing,

2099
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,560
and in a world where technology and culture

2100
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,560
has all been blasted back to square one,

2101
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:51,560
using one of the first properly successful societies

2102
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:54,060
as a blueprint for starting again isn't the worst idea.

2103
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:56,060
Caesar makes the case that his autocratic,

2104
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:58,060
brutal dictatorship is the best method

2105
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:00,060
of surviving and thriving in the wasteland,

2106
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:01,560
and he makes some really interesting arguments

2107
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,560
why this is the case.

2108
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,060
He cites ancient Roman history

2109
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:06,560
and even Hegelian dialectics in his defense,

2110
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,060
and this is a really fantastic moment

2111
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:09,560
because of how many layers it has.

2112
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,560
Firstly, a game being willing to engage with players

2113
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,060
on a philosophical level,

2114
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:15,060
even going as far as invoking the work

2115
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:17,060
of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Maser Panhegel,

2116
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:18,060
is just wonderful,

2117
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:19,560
and it's so much more thought-provoking

2118
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:21,060
than anything I'd come to expect from games

2119
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:22,560
at the time when I played it,

2120
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:24,060
but then there's the question of whether you agree

2121
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:26,060
with his interpretation of that philosophy.

2122
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:27,560
Is he just trying to sound clever?

2123
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,060
Does he really think he's that smart

2124
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:30,560
because he's read a few books?

2125
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:32,060
He even drops historical references

2126
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:33,560
to Fallout's events as well.

2127
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,560
Tandi, a character you met in the first two Fallout games,

2128
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,560
essentially made the NCR what it is

2129
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,560
and served as president for 50 years.

2130
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,560
By the way, the group you rescue her from in Fallout 1?

2131
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,060
They're the Khans.

2132
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,060
The NCR has been having to deal with these guys

2133
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:47,060
since before it even really existed,

2134
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:48,060
and you know what?

2135
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:50,060
It was weird that she was still president

2136
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:51,560
by the time of Fallout 2.

2137
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,060
Caesar points this out.

2138
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:55,560
He makes the point that the NCR worked really well

2139
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:57,060
when it essentially had a strong leader

2140
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:58,560
no one dared oppose,

2141
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,060
and the infighting and corruption that emerged

2142
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:01,560
when she died would have been avoided

2143
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,060
if they just had dictators.

2144
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:05,060
This is an actual salient criticism

2145
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:06,560
of liberal democracy.

2146
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:08,560
Say what you want about fascist autocracy,

2147
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:10,560
but at least it means a bunch of ignorant people

2148
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,060
can't accidentally vote in a moron

2149
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:14,060
and completely destroy their society.

2150
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:17,060
Instead, you have one strong, charismatic leader

2151
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,560
destroying your society.

2152
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,560
Every member of the Legion besides Caesar

2153
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,060
has a horror story about how they ended up here.

2154
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:26,560
Broke us by throwing our dogs on the fire.

2155
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,560
Lucius, the head of Caesar's Praetorian Guard,

2156
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,560
happily tells the story of his tribe

2157
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,060
being conquered by the Legion.

2158
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:34,060
The women of his tribe were turned into slaves

2159
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:35,560
and all of the men and boys

2160
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,560
who weren't fit for the military were killed,

2161
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,560
and he's completely fine with all of this

2162
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:41,560
because he's been told to believe since that day

2163
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,560
that this made him more civilized.

2164
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:46,060
Lucius has been made into an obedient servant.

2165
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,560
He isn't even capable of recognizing

2166
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:50,060
that a wrong was done to him and his people.

2167
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:52,060
Perhaps the Legion's greatest evil

2168
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:54,060
is that it convinces some of its worst victims

2169
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:56,060
it did them a service and to make them do it

2170
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:57,560
to others in its name,

2171
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,060
but forcibly integrating conquered peoples like this

2172
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:02,060
is arguably why they're such a successful

2173
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:03,560
post-nuclear society.

2174
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,560
They violently make people obey them

2175
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:08,060
in a way that creates a very particular kind of,

2176
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,560
well, peace.

2177
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:11,060
Caesar's camp has a trader in it

2178
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:13,060
who loves trading in Legion territories

2179
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:15,060
because their lands are safer than the NCR's.

2180
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:17,060
There's no raiders or criminals,

2181
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:18,560
and that's a problem you've experienced firsthand

2182
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:19,560
for the whole game.

2183
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,060
The NCR are so poorly run

2184
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:22,060
that when you commit a crime,

2185
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:24,060
they send you to a really lax prison

2186
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:26,060
and give you a bunch of dynamite to break out with.

2187
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:27,560
The Legion's brutality

2188
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:29,560
keeps everyone in their territory in line.

2189
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:32,060
What's great about this is it's simultaneously

2190
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:34,060
a criticism and a defense of the Legion.

2191
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:36,060
You know, they're bad and they crucify people,

2192
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:37,560
but at least there's no crime.

2193
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:38,560
Can't argue with results.

2194
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,560
Your bones.

2195
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,060
But also it's, you know,

2196
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:44,060
proof the Legion is terrible and has killed everyone.

2197
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:47,060
The best thing is this is based on actual Roman history.

2198
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:48,560
The ancient Romans saw themselves

2199
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,560
as bringers of law and order to the world.

2200
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,060
Peacekeepers, if you will.

2201
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:53,560
Romans would frequently inscribe

2202
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,560
peace given to the world on medals awarded

2203
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,060
to soldiers serving the empire,

2204
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:59,060
but here's a funny thing about history.

2205
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:01,560
People tend to assume that Rome was this bastion

2206
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,560
of morals and intellect.

2207
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:07,060
Mostly based on historical records written by Romans,

2208
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:09,560
their enslaved and murdered neighbors

2209
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:12,060
might not have felt the same way about their ethics.

2210
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:13,560
Tacitus, a Roman senator

2211
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,560
and one of history's most important historians,

2212
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:17,560
really famously has a quote from a chieftain

2213
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:20,560
who fought the Roman army making this exact point for me.

2214
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:23,560
They plunder, they slaughter, and they steal.

2215
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:26,560
This they falsely name empire,

2216
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,560
and where they make a wasteland, they call it peace.

2217
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:32,060
The Legion keep the peace better than the NCR

2218
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:34,060
and in a historically accurate fashion,

2219
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:36,060
they do it by killing everyone.

2220
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:39,060
Just as my namesake campaigned in Gaul

2221
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:41,560
before he crossed the Rubicon,

2222
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:44,560
so have I campaigned and will cross the Colorado.

2223
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,060
By couching the Legion in actual history

2224
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:49,060
and giving its leaders a comprehensive philosophy

2225
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:51,060
and having people who feel like they benefit

2226
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:53,060
from their actions, they stop just being

2227
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:55,060
the bad guys you can join if you want

2228
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:57,060
and start reflecting a real world view

2229
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:58,560
that has a lot to say for itself,

2230
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,060
and despite seeming like an absurd

2231
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:02,060
and ridiculous faction, there's still a lot

2232
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:04,060
of social commentary going on here too.

2233
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:06,060
The Legion are actually a more scathing criticism

2234
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:08,060
of a real world group than the NCR

2235
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,060
because here's the thing about Edward Sallow,

2236
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:12,560
a guy who just fucking called himself Caesar

2237
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,560
because he read a book about ancient Rome

2238
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,060
and decided it was cool and he could totally do that.

2239
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:19,560
The guy's a larper. He's stealing valor.

2240
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,560
He doesn't really know what he's doing.

2241
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,560
He just thinks he's got a license to rule the world

2242
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:26,060
because he knows what a Rubicon is.

2243
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:28,560
Like the NCR, he idolizes a specific moment

2244
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,560
in history he's decided is good

2245
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,060
even though Rome fell apart too in the end.

2246
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:35,060
Caesar's a really interesting criticism

2247
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:37,060
of all the losers out there in the real world

2248
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:38,560
who think they're smart because they've read

2249
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,560
about ancient Rome. You know, the kind of people

2250
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,560
who name their Discord server Athens

2251
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,560
to make themselves feel a bit smarter.

2252
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,560
The story doesn't pretend both sides

2253
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,560
are equally as good. Relentless horrible murder

2254
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,560
and crucifixion is bad actually.

2255
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,560
That's literally how they killed Jesus

2256
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,060
but by giving Caesar a lot more to say for himself,

2257
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:57,560
actual arguments to think about and respond to,

2258
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,560
this makes conflict much more involving.

2259
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:02,060
You have to have reasons why you oppose

2260
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:04,060
the ideas these people are putting forward

2261
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:05,560
and even if you think they're wrong,

2262
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,560
you at least understand why they think

2263
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,560
their ideas work which is very strong characterization.

2264
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,060
Project director Josh Sawyer

2265
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:13,560
and lead writer John Gonzalez

2266
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,560
did a really good job with making the Legion make sense

2267
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,560
and this means siding with them is really interesting

2268
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,560
because you can feel the difference

2269
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,060
between working with them and the NCR.

2270
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:24,060
It helps that so many quests for each faction

2271
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:25,560
mirror each other so well.

2272
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:28,060
At McCarran Airport, you're helping root out Legion spies

2273
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:30,560
or you're helping those spies weaken the NCR.

2274
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,560
Because the game has really laid the groundwork

2275
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,560
for these conflicts and you have so much freedom

2276
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,560
when it comes to how to take part in them,

2277
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,060
all your actions within the story feel meaningful.

2278
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:41,060
Man, I love preventing the assassination

2279
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:42,060
of the president.

2280
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:43,060
There, are you happy, cat?

2281
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:44,560
I got both sides in there.

2282
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,060
Your choices also affect your reputations

2283
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:47,560
with the factions of the game

2284
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,560
which massively changes the experience.

2285
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:51,560
If you side with the Legion, at a certain point,

2286
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,060
you can't even go too far into the strip

2287
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:56,060
without a disguise because the NCR start fights with you.

2288
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:58,060
To be fair, I did assassinate their leader

2289
01:12:58,060 --> 01:12:59,560
or in other playthroughs, maybe the Legion

2290
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,060
are sending kill squads after me

2291
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:03,060
because I blew up one of their most important commanders

2292
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:05,060
and then kept shooting their soldiers.

2293
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:06,560
These squads are nasty too.

2294
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,560
Like, going to war with the Legion is not pretty.

2295
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,560
It feels like a genuine consequence

2296
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,560
to choosing to be hostile toward them like this.

2297
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,560
Every single time their assassins turn up

2298
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,060
and tell you you shouldn't have messed with them

2299
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:17,560
and it's time to die,

2300
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,560
the player is being given a reactive reminder

2301
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,560
of the choices they personally made.

2302
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:24,060
This is what role-playing games are about.

2303
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:26,060
It's just great. It's also terrifying.

2304
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:27,560
Oh, my God, he's so fast!

2305
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,560
Thanks, Veronica.

2306
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,560
Because there are so many different choices,

2307
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:34,560
so many different ways of experiencing this story,

2308
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,560
every choice that you make feels so much more genuine.

2309
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,560
You really know for certain in this game

2310
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,560
that this whole thing could have gone differently.

2311
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,560
Since you're never being forced to do anything,

2312
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:46,060
everything you do feels that much more personal

2313
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:48,560
because on some level, you made a choice.

2314
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,060
The player isn't forced to join the Brotherhood of Steel

2315
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:52,560
as part of the main story.

2316
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,060
You can choose to join them

2317
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:55,560
if you want to steal all their stuff,

2318
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:58,060
but the choice feels personal because you don't have to.

2319
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:00,060
They aren't the main characters of the story here.

2320
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:03,060
In fact, all the other factions ask you to blow them up.

2321
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:06,060
Man, can you imagine having the guts to write a story

2322
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:08,560
where all three of the game's big factions ask you

2323
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,560
to kill the most iconic group in the series?

2324
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,560
That's not how you write a Fallout game.

2325
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:16,560
That's how you write the best Fallout game.

2336
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,560
New Vegas strikes a perfect balance

2337
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,560
between fidelity to the stories and groups

2338
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,560
of the previous games and doing different things with them

2339
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:45,560
and then adding new stuff to the setting entirely,

2340
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,560
and this is admirable because it's apparently

2341
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,560
very tempting to copy-paste things

2342
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,560
for the sake of fan service or change things

2343
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,560
in ways that come off as cynical attempts

2344
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,560
to rewrite the story to be something else.

2345
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:58,060
A great case in point here is bottle caps.

2346
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:01,060
Caps became an iconic part of the early game's setting.

2347
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:03,060
They were a really novel idea for currency

2348
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:05,060
back in Fallout 1, but by Fallout 2,

2349
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:06,060
times have changed.

2350
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:07,060
The NCR have been making

2351
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:08,560
their own money for years now.

2352
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,560
Fallout 3 went back to bottle caps,

2353
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,560
which felt really insincere,

2354
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,560
like it hadn't invested much thought

2355
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,560
into its world beyond borrowing

2356
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,560
what seemed cool from previous games.

2357
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,560
New Vegas, as a result of its creators

2358
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,560
thinking about how its world would work,

2359
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,560
has three different currencies

2360
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,560
because the NCR are here, their money is here too,

2361
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,560
and hey, look who it is on the $100 bill.

2362
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,060
It's Tandy. That's really cool,

2363
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:32,060
but it's not been adopted into the mainstream.

2364
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:33,560
They don't run the place yet,

2365
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:35,060
and a lot of people don't trust their money

2366
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:37,560
and still use the caps that were used in this area before.

2367
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:41,060
NCR people only pay you for doing quests in NCR money,

2368
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:43,060
which they mention is worth less than it should be here

2369
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:45,060
because people don't fully trust it.

2370
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:47,060
The NCR's money is almost a threat.

2371
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:49,560
They're insidiously making their way into Nevada,

2372
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:52,060
and as the Legion creep their way west,

2373
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:53,560
their money's here too. Ugh!

2374
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,560
The game is using currency

2375
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:58,060
to show the developing tensions and politics

2376
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:00,060
of the post-post-nuclear world.

2377
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:01,060
How cool is that?

2378
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:03,060
By bothering to write explanations

2379
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:04,560
and justifications for their setting,

2380
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,060
New Vegas gets to have its caps and eat them too,

2381
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:08,560
and what I love about this game is it puts

2382
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,060
an equivalent amount of thought

2383
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:12,560
into every other aspect of the series' canon.

2384
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,060
The Brotherhood are given a treatment

2385
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:15,560
befitting their belief system.

2386
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:17,560
The Brotherhood of Steel's purpose in Fallout games

2387
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,560
has been to hoard technology in their bunkers

2388
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:21,560
in case the future needs it, which is cool,

2389
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,060
but canonically, they've been doing that nonstop

2390
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:25,060
for hundreds of years.

2391
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:27,060
At a certain point, they're just hoarders,

2392
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:28,560
so by now they're in hiding,

2393
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,060
living under permanent lockdown

2394
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:32,060
after losing a ton of people battling the NCR

2395
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:33,560
over Helios One.

2396
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,560
Almost every faction wants you to dispose of them

2397
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,060
because they're just not worth dealing with,

2398
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:38,560
but once you get inside, you find out

2399
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,060
they're having internal struggles

2400
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:41,560
over the future of the chapter,

2401
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:43,060
and one possible way of saving them

2402
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:44,560
requires a ton of work,

2403
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,560
but it allows them to get over themselves a little

2404
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,560
and lift their lockdown and declare a truce with the NCR.

2405
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:52,060
It's really beautiful how much of a struggle it is

2406
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:53,560
to get them to change their ways

2407
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:56,060
and how small a part of the story they manage to be.

2408
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:58,060
These are the guys who normally end up on the box

2409
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:00,060
of Fallout games with less original things

2410
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:01,560
to say for themselves, and here they are

2411
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,560
playing a tiny role in the main story,

2412
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:06,060
living an existence that comments on their behavior

2413
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:07,060
in previous games.

2414
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:08,560
If you find their secret base

2415
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,060
and try to get in with a password you found

2416
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:11,560
on the corpses of one of their patrols,

2417
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,560
they capture you and put a bomb on your neck

2418
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,560
until you prove that you're trustworthy,

2419
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:17,560
and then they send you all around the world

2420
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:19,060
doing busy work for them

2421
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:21,060
before they even consider making you a member

2422
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:23,060
and hearing you out on a truce with the NCR,

2423
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:24,560
but you know what's really cool?

2424
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,560
When you first come here,

2425
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,560
you could have a companion with you

2426
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,060
who's a member of the Brotherhood of Steel.

2427
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:30,560
Hold on. I've got this.

2428
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,060
So instead of getting captured,

2429
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:33,560
you get the best scene in the game.

2430
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,560
We gave you a password, Veronica.

2431
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:37,560
It's for your safety.

2432
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:39,060
I know where you live, Ramos.

2433
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:41,060
Open up.

2434
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:42,560
For Pete's sake.

2435
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,060
Opening up.

2436
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:45,560
Welcome back, Veronica.

2437
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:48,060
And this skips the quest they make you do with the bomb.

2438
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:49,560
They actually thought about what would happen

2439
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:50,560
if you had Veronica when you came here.

2440
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,560
It's great.

2441
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,060
And speaking of Veronica,

2442
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:54,560
her quest to try to get the Elder

2443
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,060
to rethink the direction of the chapter

2444
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:57,560
is truly fascinating

2445
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:59,560
because no matter what technology

2446
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:01,560
you help her find, she fails

2447
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:03,560
and has to decide whether to remain

2448
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,560
with the only family she ever knew,

2449
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,060
supporting them even though she feels

2450
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:08,060
like they might be doomed

2451
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:10,060
or try to make a new life elsewhere.

2452
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:12,560
Come on. I can't listen to this anymore.

2453
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,060
The player doesn't have control

2454
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:16,560
over whether Veronica succeeds in this situation.

2455
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,060
Instead, their control is so much more personal.

2456
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:20,560
Through how they talk to Veronica

2457
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,560
about these ideas during the course of the quest,

2458
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:25,560
they help Veronica decide what to do with her life.

2459
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:28,560
This story is so personal and thoughtful and sad,

2460
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,060
and it's a way of looking at the Brotherhood

2461
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:31,560
and its members' relationships

2462
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,060
that's completely unique.

2463
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:34,560
And speaking of doomed,

2464
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,060
technologically advanced factions,

2465
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:38,560
I really like how the game treats the Enclave.

2466
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,560
The Enclave were destroyed in Fallout 2,

2467
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,560
uh, despite what some games will tell you,

2468
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,560
and even though they're an iconic and cool faction,

2469
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,060
they keep them destroyed here.

2470
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:48,060
The Remnants are just a handful of old people

2471
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:50,560
who happened to survive the fall of Navarro

2472
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,060
and have at this point been out of it

2473
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:53,060
longer than they were ever in,

2474
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:54,560
but if Arcade Ganon,

2475
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,560
a really cool companion character by the way,

2476
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,560
trusts you enough, at a certain point he tells you

2477
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,060
he's the son of one of the Remnants

2478
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:02,060
and you and him can recruit the rest

2479
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:03,560
to take part in Hoover Dam

2480
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:05,560
and help Arcade decide how he should feel

2481
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,560
about his relationship with his father's old crew

2482
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,560
along the way.

2483
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:09,560
The story involved here

2484
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,060
is simultaneously really epic

2485
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:13,060
and goes really deep into the lore

2486
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:14,060
of the Fallout universe,

2487
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:16,060
but it's also about this guy figuring out

2488
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:17,560
where he stands with his history.

2489
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,060
And at the Battle of Hoover Dam,

2490
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:20,560
along with all the other factions you recruited,

2491
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,560
the Remnants triumphantly turn up

2492
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,060
in an old Enclave vertibird

2493
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:26,560
and wearing the few suits of Enclave power armor

2494
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:27,560
in the whole game world,

2495
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,060
and they help in the fighting.

2496
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:30,560
Seeing the survivors of the Enclave,

2497
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,560
making this very small and easy to miss

2498
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,060
appearance in the game,

2499
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:36,560
giving them the chance of a small sort of redemption,

2500
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,060
it just feels so good.

2501
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:39,560
Also, this is a really small thing,

2502
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,060
uh, but it meant a lot to me.

2503
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:43,560
Um, Ganon and Veronica are both gay

2504
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,560
and it barely comes up.

2505
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:47,060
Like, it's a small part of their lives,

2506
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:48,560
and that was a really big deal to me

2507
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,060
playing this game when I was a bit younger.

2508
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:51,560
I don't know. That really spoke to me.

2509
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:52,560
Um, thanks.

2510
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,560
The Super Mutants are given really thoughtful use

2511
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:55,560
throughout the game as well.

2512
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:56,560
They're so cool,

2513
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,060
even though their stories are mostly sad.

2514
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:00,060
Most of them are hanging around in Jacobstown,

2515
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:02,060
separated from the rest of the world.

2516
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:03,560
Nightkin were a big deal in Fallout 1,

2517
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,060
invisible Super Mutants,

2518
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:06,560
some of the toughest enemies in the game,

2519
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,060
but they haven't really got much of a look-in

2520
01:20:08,060 --> 01:20:09,560
in future games until now.

2521
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,060
Addiction to and withdrawal from

2522
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:12,560
the dangerous ancient technology

2523
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,060
that powered their invisibility,

2524
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:17,060
Stealth Boys, is seriously affecting their minds

2525
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:19,060
at this point, and many of them don't even like

2526
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:20,560
being looked at by people.

2527
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,060
I really like how every fight with Super Mutants

2528
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:25,560
in this game is justified and understandable.

2529
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,560
The mutants you fight at the Repcon facility

2530
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:30,060
are losing their minds and searching desperately

2531
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:31,560
for a shipment of Stealth Boys they heard

2532
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,060
were sent there by accident long ago.

2533
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:34,560
You can talk to their leader

2534
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,060
and find a peaceful solution,

2535
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:37,560
but not if you killed too many of his friends.

2536
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:39,060
Then you have to fight him.

2537
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:40,060
If you play very straightforwardly,

2538
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:41,560
you kill a bunch of mutants,

2539
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:43,560
fight their leader who's obviously angry about this,

2540
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,560
and then later discover the Stealth Boys

2541
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:47,560
they came here looking for were sent back.

2542
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,560
You kill all of these desperate people

2543
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:51,560
and find out they came here for nothing.

2544
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:52,560
It's so bleak.

2545
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,560
A peaceful solution means sneaking past

2546
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,060
the ones that are too far gone to be talked down

2547
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,560
and finding this out for them.

2548
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,560
Antler is sad, Shuman.

2549
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:01,560
I can go now.

2550
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,560
Find Stealth Boys in other places.

2551
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,560
Even when you have to fight Super Mutants,

2552
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:06,560
there's a story to it,

2553
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,560
and you feel really sorry for them.

2554
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,060
There's a Super Mutant companion

2555
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:11,560
who has memories of her grandchildren

2556
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:13,060
from long, long ago.

2557
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:17,060
Oh, someone wants to hear Grandma's stories.

2558
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:18,560
And who isn't taking her medicine

2559
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,060
because she doesn't want to forget them.

2560
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:21,560
Like, that's just so sad

2561
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:24,060
and such an interesting thing to explore,

2562
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:26,560
especially for characters who, in the previous game,

2563
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:29,060
were used as enemies to shoot.

2564
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:31,060
You just feel so human, you know?

2565
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:32,560
Black Mountain is one of the other places

2566
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,560
Mutants are hostile, at least to begin with,

2567
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,060
and in addition to being really tough and heavily armed,

2568
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,560
they're aggressive for a reason.

2569
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,560
Their leader is deliberately positioning herself

2570
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,060
as a new master and relying on the Mutants' desire

2571
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:45,560
for a leader and ordering them to attack humans on sight.

2572
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,560
There's a peaceful solution to this too,

2573
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:48,560
and when you come back,

2574
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:49,560
the Mutants are just hanging out.

2575
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:50,560
I love Neil.

2576
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,560
Neil is one of the first Mutants

2577
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:52,560
you're likely to run into,

2578
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,060
and he's written to be an introduction

2579
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:56,560
to the more subtle and complex Mutants of this game.

2580
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:57,560
He basically runs up to you and says,

2581
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:59,060
hey, we know what you think,

2582
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:00,560
but we have a complicated history.

2583
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,060
Many of us are just as intelligent as basic humans,

2584
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:04,560
and the rest don't really have any choice

2585
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,060
in the matter, do they?

2586
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:08,060
He's like a tutorial for players who expected Mutants

2587
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:10,560
to just run around randomly killing people.

2588
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,560
I really like how if you insult him

2589
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,560
and then apologize, he's like,

2590
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,060
okay, since you apologized.

2591
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:17,060
Like, he doesn't just attack you

2592
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:18,560
the instant you say something mean.

2593
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:22,060
He's, you know, a character with motivations.

2594
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:24,060
He's here because the radio broadcast

2595
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:26,060
attracting more easily manipulatable Mutants

2596
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:27,560
is obviously a problem,

2597
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:30,060
and he's trying to send them to Jacobstown instead.

2598
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:31,560
I just really love seeing Mutants

2599
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:34,060
with comprehensible motivations and actions again.

2600
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:37,060
I feel bad for any of the Mutants I end up fighting.

2601
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:39,060
In one of the more slum-like areas surrounding Vegas,

2602
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:41,060
there's a friendly Super Mutant hanging out

2603
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:43,560
serving as the area's protector from gangs of raiders.

2604
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:44,560
Hi.

2605
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,060
There's no quests related to him.

2606
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:47,560
He's just a part of the world,

2607
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,560
chilling out, fighting bad guys, and being cool.

2608
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,560
If I have one criticism of New Vegas,

2609
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,560
it's I wish there were a few more

2610
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:55,560
casual Super Mutant NPCs in the world.

2611
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:58,560
Apparently there was going to be a Super Mutant NCR ranger,

2612
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:00,060
but he got cut for time.

2613
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:03,060
What the NCR does have though are ghoul rangers.

2614
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:04,560
We won't go quietly.

2615
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,560
The Legion can count on that.

2616
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,560
At this point, pre-war ghouls are ancient,

2617
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,560
and most of them are either really, really good

2618
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,560
at what they do or bored as hell.

2619
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,060
So they're serving as some of the NCR's finest

2620
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:16,560
or working as top scientists

2621
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,060
like the one that went to Vault 22

2622
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:20,060
or the one at Jacobstown who casually mentions

2623
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:21,560
she's made new identities for herself

2624
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:23,060
and moved on when she got bored

2625
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:24,560
with whatever she was doing.

2626
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,060
They've really thought about how ghouls

2627
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:27,560
would work in this setting.

2628
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,560
I mean, how do essentially immortal people

2629
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,060
live their lives?

2630
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:32,060
It's really cool.

2631
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:33,560
Raoul, a ghoul companion,

2632
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,060
is a really good mechanic,

2633
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:36,560
but that's just his latest skill.

2634
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,560
On top of that, he has a lifetime's worth

2635
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:41,060
of experience as an honest-to-God cowboy,

2636
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:43,060
and convincing him to go back to his roots

2637
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:45,560
makes him the best companion in the game combat-wise.

2638
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,060
The game never rests on the laurels

2639
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:48,560
of the existing setting.

2640
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,060
It's instead coming up with ways to evolve

2641
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:51,560
and add to the material.

2642
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,560
Stuff that you wouldn't have expected at all

2643
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:56,060
like an army of LARPers or New Vegas itself,

2644
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:58,560
a glowing symbol of pre-war decadence,

2645
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,560
and its robot security guards answering

2646
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,560
to a man on a TV screen fit right in

2647
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,060
and add to Fallout's greatest creative strength

2648
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:06,560
which is the sense that anything

2649
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,060
could happen in this world.

2650
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:10,060
God, Mr. House, what a sweet addition to the story.

2651
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:12,060
This character is voiced by the late, great

2652
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:13,560
René Auberginois.

2653
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,060
He knocks this character out of the park

2654
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:18,060
while being even more literally a face on a screen

2655
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:19,060
than the other characters.

2656
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:20,560
Give me 20 years,

2657
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,560
and I'll reignite the high technology

2658
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,060
development sectors.

2659
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,560
50 years, and I'll have people in orbit.

2660
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,060
Also, and this is a small thing,

2661
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:31,060
but I love that New Vegas 1-Ups 3's major character

2662
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:33,060
turns out to be a computer twist.

2663
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:35,060
John Henry Eden is on the radio the whole game

2664
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:37,060
and talks about being the president of America,

2665
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:39,060
growing up in Kentucky, and so on,

2666
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:40,560
but then when you meet him, he's a computer.

2667
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,060
It's sort of a twist, and New Vegas rolls around,

2668
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:44,560
and Mr. House is a major player,

2669
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,560
and people talk about him like he's a real person,

2670
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,560
but you get there, and he's a face on a TV screen,

2671
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,560
and he also insists he's a real boy

2672
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,560
who has somehow been alive for, like, 260 years,

2673
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:55,060
which, yeah, right, of course,

2674
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:56,560
but then if you get into the basement,

2675
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,060
you discover, no, he's a real person

2676
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:02,060
kept alive in a pod hooked up to all these computers.

2677
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:04,060
I just like the little double twist there.

2678
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:05,560
Oh, and if you kill him, this triggers

2679
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:08,560
a mass email obituary he wrote himself

2680
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,060
detailing how accomplished he was

2681
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:12,060
and how the world is screwed now,

2682
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:14,060
but I guess when your faction is basically you

2683
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:16,060
and your robot friends, you might start

2684
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:17,560
to get a little self-obsessed.

2685
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,560
Like, if you want to see how to make a Fallout game,

2686
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:20,560
there's a lesson here.

2687
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,060
Don't rehash the iconic stuff

2688
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:23,060
everyone already knows.

2689
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:24,560
Come up with something completely new

2690
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:26,560
like a faction of robot security guards

2691
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,560
who answer to a pre-war ultra-capitalist businessman.

2692
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:31,060
Don't ask what the Fallout setting

2693
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:32,560
can bring to your creativity.

2694
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,560
Ask what creativity you can bring

2695
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:35,560
to the Fallout setting.

2696
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,560
I mean, the man who shot you, Benny,

2697
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:40,060
is such a fun personal antagonist for the player.

2698
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:42,060
He's consistently funny and surprising.

2699
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:43,060
You can choose to forgive him,

2700
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:45,060
and he seems sincerely affected by this,

2701
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:47,060
but then he tries to have you killed again anyway,

2702
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:49,060
but if he gets captured by the Legion

2703
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:50,560
when you and him get a quiet moment,

2704
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,060
he tells you his entire plan to take over the Strip

2705
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:54,560
and says you should do it instead.

2706
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,060
The guy knows he's done for,

2707
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:57,560
so he hands you his whole scheme

2708
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,560
so someone else can be his legacy.

2709
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:01,060
What an interesting character.

2710
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:02,060
If the Legion get their hands on him,

2711
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:03,560
you can choose how he dies,

2712
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:05,560
and I think it's fitting given all we've been through together

2713
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,060
to take him on in single combat.

2714
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:08,060
Just him and me.

2715
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:09,560
Just make sure your companions

2716
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:11,060
aren't positioned with a view to the arena.

2717
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:12,060
Arcade, no!

2718
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:13,560
And speaking of his scheme,

2719
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:15,060
Yes Man, a reprogrammed house robot

2720
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:16,560
who can be used to take his place,

2721
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:17,560
is so cool.

2722
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:19,560
I was programmed to be helpful

2723
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:21,560
and answer any questions I was asked.

2724
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:23,060
I guess nobody bothered to restrict

2725
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:25,060
who I answer questions for.

2726
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:27,560
That was probably pretty dumb, huh?

2727
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:29,060
He's really judgmental of your choices,

2728
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:31,060
but he's programmed not to be able to disagree

2729
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:32,560
with anything anyone says.

2730
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:35,560
Okay. Consider them forgotten.

2731
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:37,560
Along with the projections that predict

2732
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,560
they'll be our biggest enemy.

John Gonzalez is completely killing it

here with this guy.

2736
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,060
All of these additions to the universe

2737
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:47,060
will make any future Fallout game

2738
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:49,560
that doesn't include them or make similar levels

2739

2740
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:53,560
and lacking in vision by comparison.

2741
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:55,560
After New Vegas, the bar has been raised

2742
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:57,560
so high that they should probably just

2743
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:59,060
stop making video games now.

2744
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:00,560
There isn't even time to get into the fact

2745
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,560
you can actually gamble in the New Vegas strip,

2746
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:04,060
or you can play Caravan,

2747
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:06,560

at the Second Battle of Hoover Dam.

2756
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,560
The game's complex and branching story means

2757
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:28,560
that you can be fighting on either side in this battle,

2758
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,560
and even then you might really just be playing

2759

a huge army of them is here to help out.

2765
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,060
If you've recruited the Boomers

2766

If you didn't deal with the Khans earlier

2769
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:49,560
in some form or another, you have to fight them here,

2770
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,060
and if you're fighting for Caesar,

2771
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:52,560
they genuinely do turn up and help you out.

2772
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:53,560
It's pretty cool.

to feel like the culmination of lots of choices you've made.

2775

Although it is a bit of a steamroll

2776
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:02,060
if you recruited everyone you could for the NCR,

2777
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:04,060
that feels good too since it's a reward

that end up siding against the Legion here,

2781
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,560
you eventually fight your way to their main camp

where their commander is waiting.

2783
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:14,560
Legate Lanius has been talked about for the whole game

2785
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:17,560
and incredibly dangerous fighter,

2786
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:19,060
and he genuinely does command you

2787
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:20,560
if you side with the Legion,

2788
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,060
but the buildup to actually fighting him

2789
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:24,060
after all this time is really cool and tense.

To talk him out of a fight,

2810
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:11,060
you have to pick choices

2811
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:13,060
that actually convince him of something.

2812
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:15,560
You can point out that even if he wins,

2813
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:18,060
the sheer size of the Western territory

2814
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:21,060
makes controlling both it and the East far too difficult

2815
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:23,060
and would eventually doom the Legion as a whole.

2816
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:25,560
Hoover Dam is but a place.

2817
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:28,560
I will not have it be the gravestone of the Legion,

01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:33,060
slowly by attrition.

2820
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:36,060
This is fascinating because it's based in actual history too.

2821
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:37,560
One of the real Roman Empire's problems

2822
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:40,060
was that it was too big to effectively control

2823
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:42,560
without falling apart, and eventually it split in two.

2824
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,060
There are other ways out too,

2825
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:46,560
like using bluff to convince him there's a trap up ahead

2826
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,560
or even using barter to convince him

2827
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:50,060
of the lack of supply lines.

2828
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:52,060
The multiple different ways of convincing him

2829
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:53,560
is a really nice way of rewarding players

2830
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:55,060
who approach the game differently.

2831
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:57,060
I genuinely can't believe that they managed

2832
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:59,560
to make barter one of the most useful skills in the game.

2833
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:02,060
Lanius fulfills a real mechanical challenge

2834
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:04,060
both in dialogue or if you fight him,

2835
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:07,060
but he still manages to make sense as a person.

2836
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:09,560
Even if you have 100 speech, after convincing him,

2837
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,060
you can still say the wrong thing

2838
01:30:11,060 --> 01:30:12,560
and make him attack you again anyway.

2839
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,060
This final big conversation of the game

2840
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:16,560
feels super cinematic.

2841
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,560
It's such a cool finale to the story,

2842
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:20,060
made even cooler by the knowledge

2843
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:21,560
that if you'd made different choices,

2844
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:23,560
he'd be the guy you answered to

2845
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:25,560
while you fought across the dam in the other direction.

2846
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:28,060
Despite being really just a series of speech checks

2847
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:29,560
in a dialogue tree,

2848
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:32,060
the quality of the execution of this final encounter

2849
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:33,560
makes this last conversation

2850
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:36,060
feel like a real argument with a real person.

2851
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:37,560
Then if you're independent,

2852
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:39,060
you can throw the NCR general off the dam.

2853
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:41,060
Ah!

2854
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:44,060
♪ Play it again ♪

2855
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:47,060
♪ My Johnny ♪

2856
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:49,060
As of today, it's been ten years

2857
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:50,560
since Fallout New Vegas was released.

2858
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,060
Well, not literally today.

2859
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:54,060
I wanted this video out on the day of the anniversary,

2860
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:55,060
but come on, it's me.

2861
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:56,560
We all knew that wasn't gonna happen.

2862
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:59,060
My producer Kat carved an NCR Ranger pumpkin

2863
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:01,060
back when we thought we were gonna get this out in October.

2864
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:03,060
It's not looking so good right now to be honest.

2865
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:05,060
It's one of these very special games

2866
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:07,560
where there's tons of choices you could plausibly make

2867
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:09,060
for how to resolve the main quest

2868
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:11,060
and so many other side quests

2869
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:12,560
with tons and tons of different endings

2870
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,560
for how you interacted with every major faction,

2871
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,560
and the amount of variation is fantastic by itself,

2872
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:19,060
but when it really comes down to it,

2873
01:31:19,060 --> 01:31:21,560
its real success is that it makes those choices

2874
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,560
so interesting and compelling

2875
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:26,560
that I enjoy making choices I made already

2876
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,560
just to see them play out again,

2877
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,560
and sure, maybe graphically it's showing its age.

2878
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,060
There's some bugs here and there,

2879
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:33,560
and it has some issues getting running

2880
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:35,560
on Windows 10 and high refresh rate monitors,

2881
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:38,060
but when a game has this much to say for itself,

2882
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:40,060
it manages to stay timeless.

2883
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:42,060
This game really gives me hope in a way.

2884
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:44,560
It's proof that games like this can exist,

2885
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:46,560
and I can't wait for there to be another one like it.

2886
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,560
I genuinely don't understand

2887
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,560
how they made this game in 18 months.

2888
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,560
One of the most magical things about New Vegas

2889
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,060
is that even when it was done

2890
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:55,560
and the developers could have moved on,

2891
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:56,560
some of them didn't.

2892
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:58,560
People like lead developer Josh Sawyer

2893
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,060
have continued to be active.

2894
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:01,560
Sawyer's been responding to questions

2895
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:03,060
about the game on Twitter and Tumblr

2896
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:04,560
for years after the game's release,

2897
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,060
even now, in fact, justifying his decisions,

2898
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:08,560
taking and responding to criticism,

2899
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,060
going into detail about what went

2900
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:11,560
into the development process,

2901
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:13,060
doing charity streams where apparently he said

2902
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:15,060
I was reading way too much into that smirk

2903
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:17,060
that one time, and yeah, I really fucked up there.

2904
01:32:17,060 --> 01:32:19,060
What a dumb mistake to make. I'm so sorry.

2905
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:21,060
I don't know. Maybe this is a bit naive,

2906
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:22,560
a bit of a wishy-washy statement,

2907
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:26,060
but New Vegas is great because at every given moment,

2908
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:28,560
it feels like a game made by a bunch of people

2909
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,560
who would happily spend ten years

2910
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,560
answering questions about it in their spare time.

2911
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:35,060
You know, I've never sat down and tried to figure out

2912
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:37,560
what I think the best games ever are,

2913
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:39,560
but I know for a fact that Fallout New Vegas

2914
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:41,060
is my favorite game,

2915
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:42,560
and it has been for a long time.

2916
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,060
Honestly, I'm kind of getting bored

2917
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:46,060
of waiting for other games to come along and beat it,

2918
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:48,060
so, um, I guess for now,

2919
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:49,560
I'm willing to say that Fallout New Vegas

2920
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:51,060
is the best game of all time.

2921
01:32:51,060 --> 01:32:52,060
Let's start a new list right now.

2922
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:53,560
Here it is, number one,

2923
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:56,060
and I'm gonna update this with every game

2924
01:32:56,060 --> 01:32:58,560
that I ever mention in any of my videos from now on

2925
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,560
so eventually we can have a list of every game

2926
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:03,060
from best to worst since I'm gonna be doing this forever

2927
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:04,060
and I will never die.

2928
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:05,060
So there we have it.

2929
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:06,560
Fallout New Vegas is objectively

2930
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:08,060
the best game of all time,

2931
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:10,560
and for that it gets my highest score ever,

2932
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,060
84 out of 100.

2933
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:13,560
It's been ten years,

2934
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:15,560
but it honestly feels like it just got here.

2935
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:17,560
Fallout New Vegas might sometimes

2936
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:19,060
run out of memory and crash,

2937
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:20,560
but that's only because there's so many moments

2938
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,060
worth remembering.

2939
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:23,560
Oh, my God, I left that in the script.

2940
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:26,560
["Spring Days"]

2941
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,560
["Spring Days"]

2942
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:32,560
["Spring Days"]

2943
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:35,560
["Spring Days"]

2944
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:38,560
["Spring Days"]

2945
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:40,560
Oh, thanks for watching all the way through, folks.

2946
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,560
Um, I had a really good time making this video.

2947
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:45,060
It's, uh, really nice getting to just gush about

2948
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:47,560
how much I love a thing that is really close to my heart.

2949
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:49,560
I'm sorry that I haven't made that many videos this year.

2950
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:52,560
I meant to make more, but it's been a really tough year.

2951
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:55,060
Um, I had a few projects that required me

2952
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:58,060
to fly out to interview people and stuff like that,

2953
01:33:58,060 --> 01:34:00,560
and they all had to be cancelled when COVID happened

2954
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,560
and people started getting sick,

2955
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:05,060
so that's–it's not been ideal.

2956
01:34:05,060 --> 01:34:08,560
I got pretty sick too, but I don't think it was the virus.

2957
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:09,560
I think it was something else.

2958
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:11,560
God, even though the video's finished now,

2959
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:13,060
there are so many things I'm like,

2960
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:14,060
oh, I should have mentioned this.

2961
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:16,060
Like, there's, like, so much stuff.

2962
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:18,560
Like, the way they reworked how guns work,

2963
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:20,560
uh, the way damage has been changed,

2964
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,560
the reintroduction of damage threshold,

2965
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,060
all that stuff. I mean, there's so many even, like,

2966
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:25,560
really tiny things that really stick out to me.

2967
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:27,560
Like, if Wild Wasteland is turned on,

2968
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:29,560
then in the credits of New Vegas, uh,

2969
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:31,560
Dead Money, the name of one of the DLCs,

2970
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:32,560
is just Dead Monkey.

2971
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,560
Like, just weird, cute little things like that

2972
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:36,560
just constantly.

2973
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:37,560
It's just really good.

2974
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:39,560
Have you figured out that I like this game yet?

2975
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:41,060
I have a couple of videos

2976
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:43,060
that are really close to being finished.

2977
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:44,560
In fact, one of them will hopefully be out

2978
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:45,560
before Christmas,

2979
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:48,560
and then I'm gonna have one done in mid-January, I think.

2980
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,560
So, um, it's good to be back up to speed

2981
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:53,560
and, uh, show people what I've been doing all this time.

2982
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:56,060
Honestly, the video coming out in January

2983
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:58,060
might be the best video I've ever made,

2984
01:34:58,060 --> 01:35:00,060
and I'm so annoyed that this video

2985
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:01,560
took so much longer than I expected

2986
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:03,060
because I just can't wait to show it off.

2987
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:05,560
However, it's about an issue

2988
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:07,560
which will be more pressing in January,

2989
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,560
so it's almost like I planned it that way,

2990
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:10,560
but it's not.

2991
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:11,560
It was a terrible mistake,

2992
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:13,060
and I wish I could have done sooner.

2993
01:35:13,060 --> 01:35:14,560
Anyway, I'm just rambling now.

2994
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:17,060
Um, I hope you all have a good Christmas.

2995
01:35:17,060 --> 01:35:19,060
Tune in in, like, literally three days

2996
01:35:19,060 --> 01:35:20,560
when a video about Christmas comes out.

2997
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:22,060
I'm not even joking. See you then.

2998
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:23,060
Anyway, I guess that's it.

2999
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:26,060
I'll see you all, um, in hell,

3000
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:27,560
and thank you all so much

3001
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:29,560
for watching the video all the way through,

3002
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:31,560
and if you're a patron, thank you for supporting me.

3003
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:34,060
Uh, it's been very nice being able to continue drinking

3004
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:36,560
sparkling water even during an apocalypse.

3005
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:38,560
Um, I have one of those soda streams

3006
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:42,060
where you, um, you can take the canister back in

3007
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:44,060
for a discount on a replacement canister,

3008
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:46,060
and every couple of months, you know,

3009
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:47,560
I put on a mask and brave the trip

3010
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:50,060
to the one store that replaces the canisters,

3011
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:52,060
and that's basically my only interaction

3012
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:53,560
with the outside world right now.

3013
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:55,060
I've noticed that, uh, the credits are obviously

3014
01:35:55,060 --> 01:35:56,560
quite long considering how long

3015
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:58,060
I've managed to talk during them,

3016
01:35:58,060 --> 01:36:00,060
so I'm thinking of maybe doing some kind of thing

3017
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:01,560
where people can send me questions

3018
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:03,060
and I'll read them out in the credits.

3019
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:05,060
Maybe, like, it makes sense instead of these rambles,

3020
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:07,060
or maybe people like me just talking about whatever.

3021
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:09,060
It's fine. Anyway, I'm gonna go watch Columbo

3022
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:11,060
and take a nap, so, uh,

3023
01:36:11,060 --> 01:36:13,060
you all have yourselves a great evening.
