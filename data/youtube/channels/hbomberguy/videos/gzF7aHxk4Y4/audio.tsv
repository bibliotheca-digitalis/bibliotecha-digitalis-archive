0	3500	The first two Fallouts are still two of the best games ever.
3500	5960	Two of the most engaging worlds and stories
5960	7960	ever crafted for players to explore.

10380	12000	So the developer went bankrupt.
12000	13920	The Fallout intellectual property
13920	15260	was then sold to Bethesda.
15260	17560	There were those who had minor problems
17560	19060	with the direction they took the series.
19060	21940	But when you shoot a guy just right,
21940	23680	his guts go everywhere.
23680	25400	So overall the game did very well.
25400	28820	A lot of people liked Fallout 3.
28840	31440	Then again, a lot of people liked Clerks 2,
31440	33520	so humans aren't really viable as a species.
33520	35560	But then, less than two years later,
35560	37400	Fallout cheated death.
37400	41900	♪ ♪
41900	43620	Developed by Obsidian Entertainment
43620	46120	with a team including people who worked on the original games,
46120	48320	Fallout New Vegas represents everything great
48320	50580	about the original series along with all the good stuff
50580	52040	from 3 that was worth keeping.
52040	54160	In addition to being one of the most incredible games
54160	56000	ever made, it's also really interesting
56000	57840	to talk about from a design perspective.
57860	59020	It's not just a game.
59020	61520	It's a flipping game design doctor,
61520	63440	and it's here to put on a clinic.
63440	64440	I didn't write that line.
64440	65620	It just appeared in the script.
65620	66900	New Vegas is the sort of game
66900	68400	where you can open a manhole cover
68400	70040	expecting, like, a sewer level
70040	72000	and instead discover that the local people
72000	74460	have formed a cult dedicated to blood
74460	77160	and retrofitted the sewers into a fighting arena.
77160	79080	Come on, there has to be a boring quest here.
79080	80540	Okay, the lady who runs this place
80540	82760	wants me to find her some mantis eggs.
82760	84000	Fetch some eggs.
84000	85680	That's gotta be the most boring quest
85680	86840	there could possibly be.
86840	88760	Okay, the eggs are in this abandoned vault.
88760	91400	Great, looking for eggs in some gray corridors.
91400	93400	That sounds...wait, it's overgrown with plants.
93400	95400	And there's environmental storytelling
95400	97020	warning me not to go in?
97020	98740	Oh, man, this vault is cool.
98740	100820	It's overgrown, and there's a bunch of stories
100820	102440	on the computers about the experiments
102440	104120	that went on in there, and it's creepy
104120	105660	and way more visually interesting
105660	107120	than you'd expect a vault to be,
107120	108920	and is that...oh, oh!
108920	116080	♪♪
116160	117700	One of New Vegas' best features
117700	119460	is its ability to make you invested
119460	121160	in its quests and locations.
121160	123380	Vault 22 is one of the many parts of the world
123380	125380	that sounds on paper like somewhere familiar
125380	127500	which then goes out of its way to be completely unlike
127500	129340	you expect in every possible way.
129340	131840	Players of three will already have an intimate awareness
131840	133960	of how vaults can be, having been forced
133960	135640	to walk around in one for an hour
135640	137060	before the game even starts,
137060	139180	and several side quests also take place
139180	142220	in very similar vaults with slightly different aesthetics
142220	143480	and different enemies in them.
143500	147140	Instead of Officer Mac, you get Officer Gary.
147140	148640	Gary!
148640	150060	The most interesting vault in three
150060	151680	is full of people called Gary
151680	153260	who yell Gary at you.
153260	155560	Ha, ha, ha, Gary!
155560	156760	I mean, it's pretty funny.
156760	158440	On a surface level, it's easy to see
158440	161100	why Vault 22 is a more compelling place to explore.
161100	162820	It's a bit nicer to look at with its spots
162820	164940	of overgrowth in the halls and plants everywhere,
164940	166440	the cave network it gives way to
166440	167660	and its more run-down areas,
167660	169080	and it's populated with enemies
169080	171780	unique to this one location called Spore Carriers
171800	174680	which look like humans but creepily hide in foliage
174680	177140	and can't be targeted by V.A.T.S. while they're hiding,
177140	178720	meaning you have to be able to spot them
178720	180680	through their camouflage in order to fight them
180680	182980	which makes them genuinely creepy and, ugh!
182980	185820	And while the unique aesthetic and cool enemies are fun,
185820	187980	what makes Vault 22 a good case study
187980	189520	in Obsidian's design philosophy
189520	192100	is the ways it creates a strong narrative experience
192100	194280	for players and uses its mechanical elements
194280	196860	to enhance player engagement with the story.
196860	198660	Firstly, just for convenience's sake,
198660	200820	the vault can be discovered in more than one way.
200820	203320	Six different quests lead you to this vault.
203320	204560	You don't necessarily come here
204560	206360	looking for those delicious eggs.
206360	207820	One guy wants you to find the secret
207820	209860	of how they're growing all these plants so easily
209860	211980	since, you know, growing plants in the wasteland
211980	212980	is a pretty big deal.
212980	214100	Somewhere on a computer system
214100	216360	in the vault are files on how they managed all this,
216360	217740	but on your way out of his office,
217740	219980	another scientist stops you and says he sent, like,
219980	222740	ten other guys there already and none of them have come back
222740	224100	and asks you to find out what happened
224100	225640	to another researcher who went there.
225640	228060	This is a trick the game pulls often with its quests.
228060	229600	Even something as simple as,
229600	231520	download some files for me, please,
231520	233840	is given extra layers of narrative meaning.
233840	236020	You're actually being sent to a dangerous place
236020	237300	without proper warning
237300	238920	and other people are missing there.
238920	241420	This creates a sense of anticipation to the level.
241420	243140	The vault has tons of computer logs
243140	244380	detailing the work they did,
244380	246100	the events with mind-controlling spores
246100	247920	that led to everyone's death or infection,
247920	250020	and a bunch of new logs left by the researcher
250020	251420	who went missing when she came here,
251420	252880	and because you're actually trying to find out
252880	254560	what happened to the researcher,
254560	256380	it's much harder to ignore the story
256380	258200	that's going on here than it would be otherwise.
258200	260660	The player is also being given mechanical rewards
260660	262420	that really incentivize exploring
262420	264580	and engaging closely with the material.
264580	266740	There's a unique laser rifle you can't get
266740	268700	anywhere else in the game hidden in this vault
268700	270240	on some poor guy's corpse.
270240	272120	The game never draws attention to it.
272120	273820	It's not, like, a reward you get
273820	275240	for beating a boss or something.
275240	277120	It's just hidden in a corner somewhere,
277120	278920	and the genius of this kind of design
278920	281420	is that once players have found something like this once,
281420	282540	they're gonna realize there could be
282540	283620	stuff hidden anywhere.
283620	285660	Suddenly they're paying that much more attention
285700	287700	to the environments that they're traveling through
287700	289860	and partaking more in the stories of the place.
289860	291400	You might not really care that much
291400	293480	about the story of little side quests like this,
293480	295980	but if you know there might be a cool gun in here somewhere,
295980	297280	you're paying a lot more attention
297280	298280	than you might have been.
298280	299860	Some of the quests technically put
299860	301280	an objective marker in the corner
301280	302820	leading you to the necessary part,
302820	305240	but when Vault 22 has worked its magic,
305240	306520	you forget it's there.
306520	308480	The true beauty of great game design
308480	310820	is when all its artificial justifications,
310820	313160	quest indicators, loot to find,
313160	315740	experience points to earn, melt away,
315740	318520	and you really feel like you're in a creepy place
318520	319660	looking for answers.
319660	322060	Eventually you find the researcher is alive
322060	324280	and can help them flood the lower floors with gas
324280	325440	and blow up the spores
325440	327200	so they don't pose a threat to anyone else.

333200	336080	The person you optionally saved as a result of exploring
336080	339240	wants to delete the data you actually came here for.
339240	340620	If you already downloaded it,
340620	342620	she asks you to delete your copy too,
342620	344500	so this mistake can't be repeated,
344500	346580	and if you refuse, she attacks you.
346580	349620	Even simple-seeming fetch quests have twists
349620	351960	and the sense of a story you're taking part in
351960	353660	and making choices about
353660	355700	because there's a real moral dilemma here.
355700	357620	Do you really trust this guy with research
357620	359540	that killed a bunch of people already?
359540	361700	We're with the government for goodness sake.
361700	363160	Have a little faith in us.
363160	365580	You have to be good at science
365580	367860	in order to reason out with her that it's probably good
367860	370700	to have a record of the mistake so people don't repeat it.
370700	372500	What could have been a simple fetch quest
372540	375380	to find some data ended in making an ethical decision
375380	378380	about whether the information you found deserves to exist.
378380	380340	The advantages of this design are clear
380340	382700	when you contrast with the Gary Vault in 3.
382700	385000	The enemies are kind of cool for a little while,
385000	388660	but there's no quests or story or choices to make,
388660	391120	so the experience isn't particularly involving.
391120	393340	You don't really have any reasons to be here.
393340	395500	There's a really useful piece of loot in this vault,
395500	398000	a bobblehead that permanently increases your charisma,
398000	399920	and even though it's technically quite hard to miss,
399920	401960	it's just sitting on a table deep in the vault,
401960	404080	getting to it requires trawling through
404080	407040	the rest of a location that has nothing else worth finding
407040	410200	and enemies whose gimmick was wearing thin after Gary 3.
410200	412120	I'm willing to bet most players got bored
412120	413540	and left before they found it.
413540	415120	If you found this, be honest.
415120	417700	You didn't find it because the location was so cool
417700	419700	it made you want to look around and see all of it.
419700	421700	You found it because you were using a guide
421700	423280	to find all the bobbleheads.
423280	424120	Thanks, Carl.
424120	425840	Eventually, players lose interest
425840	427960	in picking through empty buildings
427960	429620	full of locked, easy safes

442120	443120	in New Vegas.
443120	444820	Vault 11 is straight up an incredibly
444820	446440	well-written piece of fiction,
446440	448200	and it's just hiding off in a little nook
448200	450320	waiting for you to be sent there as part of a quest
450320	451400	for the Brotherhood of Steel.
451400	453480	I need you to go on this important quest for me.

455120	457120	Yep, yep, yep, great, great!
457120	458820	I'm going to destroy this faction.
458820	461320	This approach to quest design is all over the place,
461320	463240	offering you very simple and straightforward
463240	465820	seeming things and then pulling the rug out from under you.
465820	467400	Honestly, there are probably too many.
467400	469140	It's at the point where if you happen to pick up
469140	471320	enough cute little bottle caps with stars on them,
471320	473100	you stumble into a quest to discover
473100	474400	a legendary treasure.
474400	475900	You get random encounters with people
475900	477480	murdering each other over them.
477480	478600	After you find your first one,
478600	480320	this guy Malcolm eventually tracks you down
480320	481480	and tells you about the quest.
481480	482900	He's kind of notorious for doing it
482900	484480	at really unexpected times.
484480	486360	You might notice he seems to be at a weird angle
486360	487360	looking down at me.
487360	488520	That's because on this play through,
488520	490140	I was crouching preparing for a fight
490140	491140	when he found me.
493860	494860	Hello there.
494860	496140	It was actually kind of terrifying,
496140	497860	but I admire his dedication.

498980	500240	Yeah!
500240	501820	Okay, I'm gonna be nice about Fallout 3.
501820	502900	There's some good stuff in there
502900	504600	and some of these quests are genuinely good
504600	506600	like when a talking tree asks you to kill it
506600	508720	in spite of its existence bringing people hope
508720	511360	or resolving a dispute between two broken people
511360	513140	masquerading as comic book characters
513140	514260	and harassing a town
514260	516140	or when an old woman asks you to find her
516140	519000	the world's last remaining Stradivarius violin.
519000	520720	A handful of the quests in Fallout 3
520720	523040	end up being genuinely good, funny,
523040	524880	and even touching at times.
524880	527000	If anything, they annoy me in a particular way
527000	529500	because they made me see how amazing a game would be
529500	531540	if it was filled with quests like these.
531540	534620	Ahem, New Vegas is a game filled with quests like these,
534620	537040	but hey, maybe it's a quality over quantity type thing.
537040	538800	I mean, even if you don't like the quests in 3,
538800	539800	at least there's a lot of them.
539800	542180	Obsidian only had 18 months to make New Vegas

637120	639000	an old 50s Vegas style.
639000	641320	But I ain't a fink. Dig?
641320	643200	The fact he's wearing a cool checkered suit
643200	645000	in the post-apocalypse, all of this stuff
645000	646320	really makes you wanna track him down
646320	647620	and find out what his deal is.
647620	649120	What in the goddamn?
649120	651000	Benny and his motivations and personality
651000	652320	are really cool to learn about.
652320	654460	It helps that he's voiced by Matthew Perry, too.
654460	656500	John Gonzalez, the lead writer for New Vegas,
656500	658360	did a really fantastic job with him.
658360	661000	And while I'm at it, Gonzalez is like an unsung hero
661000	662340	in all the games he works on.
662340	664660	Like, he co-developed the Nemesis system
664660	665660	for Shadow of Mordor?
665660	667340	You know, like, the best thing in that game?
667340	669460	Actual quote from Gonzalez's LinkedIn.
669460	671960	I was the lead story guy on Fallout New Vegas.
671960	673660	Thank you, God.
673660	675540	No, John. Thank you.
675540	677160	Did I just imply that I'm God?
677160	679460	Players are much more likely to actively take part
679460	681000	in a story if they have questions
681000	682340	they actually want answering.
682340	684240	Also, did I mention the robot cowboy?
684240	687200	♪ My ramblin' days were through ♪
687200	688860	Fallout 1 and 2 had the right idea
688860	691100	when character creation was one screen long
691100	693260	and then the game just started right away.
693260	695360	There you are in the world. Have fun.
695360	696900	Try to get further than Ed did.
696900	698560	Granted, the character creation screen
698560	701260	was also evidence Black Isle didn't have a UI designer.
701260	703220	Literally every first time Fallout player
703220	706060	has accidentally named their first character non
706060	707900	because they were supposed to type it into here
707900	709720	but still, they were onto something here.
709720	711460	One of my biggest gripes about Fallout 3
711460	713100	was how long it took to start.
713100	715220	The opening sequence deciding your character's stats
715220	716760	and learning the basics of the gameplay
716760	719160	takes 19 years of in-game time
719160	720600	and honestly, it feels that long
720600	722360	before eventually your father realizes
722360	723860	he's forgotten to do the main quest
723860	725360	and escapes and you go after him.
725360	727660	It's only when you finally leave the vault
727660	730160	that the game properly opens up to be explored.
730160	732560	Fallout New Vegas's opening is as smooth as butter
732560	734060	and not the butter you keep in the fridge.
734060	736560	The butter your parents keep in a little dish by the table
736560	738560	so it's already smooth and melty when you need it
738560	739960	and it's just so spreadable
739960	741060	and every time you visit them,
741060	742560	you make a mental note to get one
742560	744060	but you forget again as soon as you
744060	745160	After the opening cutscene,
745160	746260	you're talking to Doc Mitchell
746260	747260	where you make your character
747260	748460	and then walk outside his house
748460	750260	and bam, the game begins.
750260	752760	Fallout 2 opens by forcing you to complete a dungeon
752760	755060	that's pretty repetitive after the first few times through.
755060	757460	It's one of the few things most people don't like about 2
757460	759760	and players often use mods to skip it entirely.
759760	762060	Can you imagine having, like, a decade of hindsight
762060	764260	on all the criticisms people had of Fallout 2
764260	765760	and then making a game where the opening
765760	767460	is, like, three times as long?
767460	769060	That would be a bit silly, wouldn't it?
769060	771260	Eh, I'm sure they'll learn the lesson for Fallout 4.
771260	773960	♪
773960	776060	The character creation process is really fun too.
776060	777160	You pick your starting stats
777160	779560	through a really cute device called the Vigor Tester
779560	781060	and then you get a psych exam
781060	783460	which involves an honest-to-god Rorschach test
783460	784460	which is just great.
784460	785560	Some players actually modded in
785560	786960	what they saw as options.
786960	787960	That's it. That's all it does.
787960	789760	It lets you pick two bears high-fiving
789760	790860	for one of the images.
790860	792760	22,000 downloads.
792760	795360	Including me, that's definitely two bears high-fiving.
795360	797260	When you get to pick your tagged skills though,
797260	798560	you'll notice the list of skills
798560	800060	is a little different from 3.
800060	802960	Big guns and small guns are missing, for example.
802960	804360	There's just guns now
804360	805360	but in addition to this,
805360	807460	all these skills have much more uses
807460	809460	than they did in the previous games too.
809460	812760	♪ When you say I love you ♪
812760	814660	Okay, look, we all love speech, right?
814660	816460	Kudos to the series for making a video game
816460	819160	where talking was a skill worth putting points into at all
819160	820960	but a problem plaguing Fallout games
820960	822560	since the beginning was that one skill
822560	824260	made you the master of half the game's
824260	825760	main form of interaction
825760	827260	which really wasn't ideal.
827260	829060	Games have tried to section off speech
829060	830660	into different types of speech
830660	831660	but let's be honest,
831660	833360	none of them have really worked.
833360	835060	New Vegas goes for the opposite solution.
835060	836560	It keeps speech as is
836560	838160	while giving other skills
838160	839860	the chance to influence dialogue.
839860	841560	The game is also cleverly using
841560	843160	its opening area, Goodsprings,
843160	845460	to great effect in tutorializing players
845460	846460	about this feature.
846460	847760	The first real quest in the game
847760	849660	is to prepare for an attack on the town.
849660	852160	This quest has multiple optional components
852160	854060	where you can ask the townspeople for help
854060	855360	and each of them needs convincing
855360	856560	using a different skill.
856560	857860	This whole quest is basically the game
857860	859860	showing you how many different ways you can play it.
859860	861360	Like, hey, if you were good at barter,
861360	863160	you could have talked this guy into helping.
863160	864660	All the players who took this quest
864660	866560	know that barter can influence dialogue
866560	868160	and not just how much things cost
868160	869260	and minor spoilers,
869260	871760	barter can be used to beat the final boss.
871760	872760	I'm not even kidding.
872760	873960	That's how many options you have here.
873960	875260	If you want Easy Pete
875260	876760	to share his dynamite with you,
876760	878660	you have to prove you wouldn't blow your head off
878660	879660	if he did.
879660	881860	He doesn't need $10 words to convince him.
881860	883260	He needs you to prove you're better
883260	885860	at throwing explosives than these clowns.
885860	887960	Now that's what I call a...
887960	888960	He blew himself up.
888960	890460	Checks like this for other abilities
890460	891760	are all over the game.
891760	893560	Speech is still really useful,
893560	895560	but conversations are so much more varied
895560	897160	in what they ask of player characters,
897160	898160	and that's great.
898160	899560	Medicine, a skill I ignored
899560	901260	in every other Fallout game,
901260	903760	now unlocks some of the best dialogue options
903760	905060	because it turns out being a doctor
905060	907060	in a post-apocalypse is really, really good
907060	908360	at opening doors for you.
908360	910060	What other game lets you do therapy
910060	911260	at a cannibal chef
911260	913460	until he has a breakdown and quits his job?
913460	915060	Players are more likely to feel like
915060	916760	the type of character they made
916760	919060	had a tangible impact on a conversation
919060	921460	which creates a rewarding sense of control.
921460	922460	On top of all of this,
922460	924460	the way dialogue actually works
924460	926460	has been changed significantly from 3.
926460	928460	In 3, if something required speech,
928460	930860	even if you had the maximum amount of speech,
930860	932460	the game could still randomly decide
932460	933660	you failed the check,
933660	935460	so you could build your character around speech
935460	937360	and still just not get to use it,
937360	938560	or you could build your character
938560	939760	around everything else
939760	942160	and just reload the game until you got it anyway.
942160	944460	In New Vegas, if you have the required skill,
944460	945460	it works.
945460	946460	It just works.
946460	948160	It even tells you if you don't have enough,
948160	949660	and in a choice that someone
949660	950960	should have won an award for,
950960	953660	it gives you a worse line to say as a result.
953660	955060	I really like this because it means
955060	957160	you can pick bad options on purpose
957160	958560	and see what happens. It's great.
958560	961260	Finally, I can role play as a complete loser
961260	963660	because I'm so sick of winning in real life.
963660	966260	So now speech is useful based on how many points
966260	967360	you put into it,
967360	969160	not whether the game decides it,
969160	970760	which makes this character creation
970760	973260	feel way more tangible and substantive.
973260	975360	The points feel like they actually matter.
975360	977460	Right after this comes another big change from 3.
977460	978860	After picking your tagged skills,
978860	980760	you get to pick up to two traits.
980760	982360	Which, well...
982360	984660	These were a really cool feature
984660	985960	in the early Fallout games.
985960	987360	Traits would optionally give you
987360	988860	some kind of interesting bonus
988860	990360	and a downside to go with them.
990360	991660	So you could be a one-hander,
991660	993860	so you're a bit more accurate with one-handed weapons
993860	995260	but a whole lot less accurate
995260	996860	with two-handed ones to compensate.
996860	998660	Some of them were just mild changes
998660	1000860	like Bloody Mess, which makes every death animation
1000860	1002160	always the most violent one
1002160	1003460	for whatever weapon you were using.
1003460	1004760	I really love Jinxed,
1004760	1006560	which vastly increases the amount
1006560	1007760	of critical failures,
1007760	1009360	an otherwise pretty rare occurrence
1009360	1011160	for everyone in the game, including you.
1011160	1013260	Traits led to vastly different ways
1013260	1015160	of playing the game right from the outset.
1015160	1017960	They were a really cool addition to the RPG formula.
1017960	1019260	Everybody loved them,
1019260	1021460	and Fallout 3 removed them for no reason,
1021460	1023160	which was a shame because traits
1023160	1025560	were the spiciest part of character creation.
1025560	1028060	They're a chance to make a character worse at something
1028060	1029460	in exchange for a reward,
1029460	1031060	and that's a really interesting decision
1031060	1032060	to give to players.
1032060	1033160	I really like Four Eyes,
1033160	1034860	which reduces your perception by one
1034860	1036360	but you get it back and one more
1036360	1037760	once you find a set of glasses.
1037760	1038760	Once you account for that,
1038760	1040860	it's kind of like getting an extra special point,
1040860	1042460	but there's also a secret downside
1042460	1043760	you don't realize at first.
1043760	1045860	You can't wear glasses with power armor helmets
1045860	1047460	and stuff like that, so it affects what stuff
1047460	1049160	you end up wearing later in the game too.
1049160	1051460	Plus, as a guy who needs to wear contact lenses all day
1051460	1052760	or he'll fall over and die,
1052760	1054160	I feel very seen by this trait.
1054160	1055360	Having that kind of control
1055360	1056660	over what your character is like,
1056660	1058360	making them as unique as you want,
1058360	1060260	is kind of one of the central features
1060260	1061460	of role-playing games.
1061460	1063360	What sort of character the player makes
1063360	1065360	is one of their main forms of expression,
1065360	1066960	and it's so nice having them back.
1066960	1068660	One of the traits is Wild Wasteland,
1068660	1070060	which, actually, let's give it its own.
1070060	1071560	♪ ♪
1071560	1073860	The Fallout games have always been a very strong mix
1073860	1075560	of serious themes and ideas,

1077060	1080060	Your bones are scraped clean by the desolate wind.
1080060	1082660	But the series also has a tremendous sense of humor.
1082660	1085560	I was in bad shape and, well, I passed out.
1085560	1086860	How did you survive?
1086860	1088360	Didn't. Got killed.
1088360	1089860	Ha!

1092060	1093260	in the canon of Fallout,
1093260	1094860	and there's also just tons of silly shit
1094860	1097260	like randomly happening upon a talking cow
1097460	1099660	or finding a TARDIS or a crashed spaceship
1099660	1101860	with a picture of Elvis on an alien's corpse.

1102860	1104260	Wild Wasteland optionally
1104260	1106060	makes things a little bit weirder.
1106060	1108060	If you're serious about role-playing and realism
1108060	1109160	or just hate fun,
1109160	1110760	it's nice that you can avoid these things
1110760	1111960	by not picking this trait,
1111960	1113360	but it adds a lot of great stuff,
1113360	1115760	little references and in-jokes and comedic things,
1115760	1117260	most of which I don't want to spoil,
1117260	1119460	some of which are too obscure to bother explaining,
1119460	1120460	but I love it.
1120460	1122160	It's also really clever to make it a choice
1122160	1124360	so everyone gets the experience they prefer.
1124360	1125960	Half of this stuff is so weird
1125960	1127160	it makes sense it's optional.

1141160	1142660	Anyway, during the early questing
1142660	1144160	and prepping for the attack on the town,
1144160	1145160	you're going to level up
1145160	1146660	and get to choose your first perk,
1146660	1147660	and by the way...
1147660	1149860	♪
1149860	1152260	In his GDC retrospective on the first Fallout,
1152260	1154960	original creator Tim Cain talks about the impact
1154960	1156460	of perks on playtesting.
1156460	1157960	Uh, QA loved that they could make characters
1157960	1158960	that were different than, like,
1158960	1160260	the guy sitting right next to him in QA
1160260	1161460	and they could play the game very differently
1161460	1162460	because of it.
1162460	1163760	Here's a game design term for you.
1163760	1164960	Horizontal progression.
1164960	1167260	Vertical progression is when the numbers get higher
1167260	1168760	and, yeah, sure, numbers going up
1168760	1170960	can be fun and pleasing in its own way,
1170960	1172460	but giving someone a new power,
1172460	1173960	a new thing they can do,
1173960	1175260	is usually way more rewarding.
1175260	1176460	They actually came up with perks
1176460	1178760	to give players more to do when they level up.
1178760	1179960	Brian Fargo took the game home,
1179960	1181460	played it for a weekend, came back,
1181460	1183760	and said, I love it except when I go up a level,
1183760	1185260	skill points aren't enough for me to do.
1185260	1188260	In other words, according to Fallout's original creator,
1188260	1190260	perks exist in order to make leveling up
1190260	1193560	feel more substantive than just putting points into stats.
1193560	1194560	Pause for effect.
1194560	1195760	A lot of the perks in Fallout 3
1195760	1198060	just add more points into stats.
1198060	1199760	So you level up, you assign your points,
1199760	1202260	and then, oh, I guess I can put five more points
1202260	1203560	into science and medicine,
1203560	1206260	or I can put five points in small guns and repair.
1206260	1209560	Oh, I can put 15 points into big guns.
1209560	1212560	That almost makes big guns a feasible skill
1212560	1214060	that doesn't need deleting from the game.
1214060	1215860	Do you like when the numbers get higher?
1215860	1216860	I hope you do.
1216860	1218060	Could I have a more interesting
1218060	1219360	form of progression, please?
1219360	1221060	I mean, let's be fair, there are some good perks
1221060	1222060	like animal friend.
1222060	1223060	So certain animals,
1223060	1224360	even some of the really dangerous ones,
1224360	1225560	will just hang out with you now
1225560	1226860	or even defend you in battle
1226860	1228360	if you take it twice which is cool.
1228360	1230360	Black Widow and Lady Killer are pretty nice too.
1230360	1232360	It's certainly better than having five more sneak
1232360	1233660	and lock pick. Come on.
1233660	1236360	First off, literally all of the boring perks
1236360	1238660	have been deliberately removed from New Vegas.
1238660	1242060	Like, there were so many and they're all gone.
1242060	1243560	It's like you can tell someone
1243560	1245860	who knows what they're doing looked at Three's perks
1245860	1247860	and said, these ones are bad. Take them out.
1247860	1248860	But here's the thing, right?
1248860	1250360	New Vegas gets to make its perks
1250360	1252560	way more interesting and cool
1252560	1255660	because they've changed the way they're used in the game.
1255660	1258860	In New Vegas, perks have more demanding requirements
1258860	1260160	before you can take them.
1260160	1262360	Meltdown is a ridiculously cool perk
1262360	1264360	that causes enemies killed with energy weapons
1264360	1266360	to explode in a burst of damage
1266360	1268360	which can often cause massive chain reactions.
1268360	1271860	Okay, that's a bit much to be honest.
1271860	1273860	This perk is hella horizontal.
1273860	1275360	Hella. What a great word.
1275360	1277860	It makes specializing in energy weapons feel amazing.
1277860	1279660	You're blowing people up left and right.
1279660	1281660	It's great, but you can only get this cool,
1281660	1285860	overpowered power if you have 90 energy weapons skill
1285860	1287660	which is a really steep requirement
1287660	1289460	especially considering New Vegas gives you
1289460	1291160	a lot fewer skill points per level
1291160	1294160	and you only get to pick a perk once every two levels now
1294160	1295860	which is how it was in the original games too.
1295860	1297660	That's another thing Three changed for some reason.
1297660	1301160	Cool perks are a reward for how you built your character.
1301160	1303160	Players are incentivized to plan ahead
1303160	1305460	and think about what sort of character they want to make
1305460	1307160	and what perks they want to end up with
1307160	1308960	which is intensely engaging.
1308960	1312460	Only one perk in Three requires a skill as high as 80
1312460	1314660	and most have no skill requirements at all.
1314660	1316760	There's a very real sense of progress
1316760	1318760	to building up a character in New Vegas
1318760	1321460	because perks add genuinely unique things.
1321460	1323460	Also, this is a small thing, but in Fallout 3
1323460	1324760	there was a perk that let you get
1324760	1326260	some more romantic dialogue
1326260	1327760	with characters of the opposite gender
1327760	1329260	so you could play a womanizing man
1329360	1331260	or a mananizing woman.
1331260	1333060	It also let you deal 10% more damage
1333060	1334760	to that gender for some reason.
1334760	1336060	I'm sure it was unintentional,
1336060	1337560	but the existence of these perks
1337560	1340560	implies Bethesda don't think gay people exist
1340560	1342860	in the Fallout universe which is quite funny.
1342860	1345560	New Vegas added a same gender version of the perk
1345560	1347060	so you could play as a gay character
1347060	1348560	or you could take both which at that point
1348560	1351060	gave you a 10% damage bonus against almost everyone
1351060	1354060	and was also a really nice piece of representation.
1354060	1355560	You were at that point role playing
1355560	1358060	a bisexual character in a video game.
1358060	1360860	In 2010, which was super cool,
1360860	1363360	I should have led with that and not the damage bonus.
1363360	1366060	♪ I'm going under ♪
1366060	1367560	Back in the days of Fallout 3,
1367560	1370860	people loved modding in more severe survival elements.
1370860	1373660	Fallout Wanderer's Edition is the most downloaded mod
1373660	1376360	for 3 by a pretty wide margin and it's a great mod.
1376360	1378660	It makes the game much more engaging and challenging.
1378660	1380860	It also came with a built-in alternative start option
1380860	1382660	so you didn't have to fucking do the vault again.
1382660	1384860	New Vegas gives players who like that sort of thing
1384860	1386560	an option built into the game.
1386560	1388060	On your way out of the front door,
1388060	1390360	you're given the choice to use hardcore mode.
1390360	1392160	It makes stimpacks heal over time
1392160	1394160	so you can't pause the game and get all your health back
1394160	1395160	in the middle of a fight.
1395160	1396160	You have to manage thirst,
1396160	1397360	hunger, and sleep now.
1397360	1399560	Companions can die which is terrifying.
1399560	1400560	Veronica, no!
1400560	1402860	And even bullets affect your carry weight now.
1402860	1404160	It really isn't messing around either.
1404160	1405560	In the middle of a normal playthrough,
1405560	1408360	I tried turning it on and suddenly I was at three times
1408360	1410360	my maximum carrying capacity.
1410360	1413360	I had to drop all this stuff just to be able to move.
1413360	1414660	Don't look at me like that, Veronica.
1414660	1415660	It's not littering anymore.
1415660	1416660	The world's ended.
1416660	1418960	This little extra optional realism
1418960	1420660	adds a lot to the experience
1420660	1422160	for people who like that sort of thing.
1422160	1424260	I'm personally a really big fan
1424260	1426660	of when developers add things into games
1426660	1428760	because they know that people would want them there
1428760	1430460	and mod them in if they weren't.
1430460	1432260	Like, people also modded iron sights
1432260	1433460	into Fallout 3 a lot.
1433460	1435460	Fallout 3 didn't have iron sights for some reason.
1435460	1436960	It just zoomed in a bit.
1436960	1441660	But guess what?
1441660	1443460	New Vegas has iron sights now. It's great.
1443460	1445260	In fact, this actually reveals another problem
1445260	1446560	with Fallout 3's design.
1446560	1448760	You can't aim down the sights of certain guns
1448760	1450260	that were made for Fallout 3
1450260	1451860	because whoever designed them at the time
1451860	1453860	forgot to put sights on them.
1453860	1456360	Like, they didn't think about how a person would use them.
1456360	1458060	Look at the laser pistol, for example.
1458060	1460060	There's just, like, a nub and a little rail there.
1460060	1461260	What am I looking down?
1461260	1462260	Here's the laser rifle.
1462260	1463560	It's a pretty nice-looking gun,
1463560	1465260	but it wasn't built with consideration
1465260	1467260	for how a person would actually use it.
1467260	1468860	In third person, when you right-click,
1468860	1471060	the character doesn't aim down sights animation,
1471060	1473060	but there's no sights there. What is she doing?
1473060	1474260	Bethesda noticed this too
1474260	1476060	because they redesigned laser weapons
1476060	1477560	in 4 to have sights on them.
1477560	1480060	Another thing people frequently modded into Fallout 3
1480060	1482360	was the ability to upgrade and modify weapons.
1482360	1483860	That's a bit of a confusing concept.
1483860	1485560	Modding in weapon mods?
1485560	1487760	The base game in New Vegas comes with the ability
1487760	1488760	to modify weapons.
1488760	1490260	Now you can upgrade and customize
1490260	1491260	your equipment. It's great.
1491260	1494060	Hilariously, one of the mods for the laser weapons
1494060	1495560	is working iron sights.
1495560	1498060	This is the weapon upgrade version of a subtweet.
1498060	1499760	Combine that with the fact there's way,
1499760	1501260	way more weapons in New Vegas
1501260	1503760	and different ammo types for the weapons too,
1503760	1506260	and all of a sudden you have so much more room for choice
1506260	1508760	in how you build your character and what weapons you use.
1508760	1511260	Optimized ammo, baby!
1511260	1512760	Okay, I got distracted there and talked about
1512760	1514060	a bunch of other stuff,
1514060	1516060	but that's because New Vegas is so good
1516060	1517560	at tying everything together.
1517560	1519060	The opening quest at Goodsprings
1519060	1521060	is a really well-designed introduction
1521060	1522560	to the ways the character you've built
1522560	1525060	and your skills and traits and perks can be used
1525060	1527060	as you prep for the town's big battle,
1527060	1528560	and the final thing it has to teach you
1528560	1531060	is that being the good guy isn't the only option
1531060	1533060	because you can align yourself with the gang
1533060	1535060	and help them take over the town instead,
1535060	1536560	and this gets you cred with the gang
1536560	1537560	which can really help you out
1537560	1539060	with a lot of stuff later in the game.
1539060	1541060	The story is essentially this side quest
1541060	1542860	in slow motion with larger stakes,
1542860	1545860	a series of preparations for the second battle of Hoover Dam,
1545860	1547860	a battle in which you get to choose a side
1547860	1549360	and recruit others to your cause,
1549360	1551860	and now even playing through the story the first time,
1551860	1553560	the player knows what kind of choices
1553560	1555060	to expect and prepare for.
1555060	1557860	It's a tutorial, but without telling you it's one.
1557860	1558860	It's very sneaky.
1558860	1560060	It's a bit like how in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
1560060	1561560	Clear Sky you, what are you doing?
1561560	1562560	Get your hands off me!
1563560	1566560	Anyway, now that I've created my ultimate warrior,
1566560	1568560	I'm ready to march straight north to New Vegas
1568560	1570560	and have myself a grand old time.
1570560	1571560	There are some radscorpions in the way,
1571560	1572560	but that shouldn't be so f-
1572560	1574060	Oh, they're really resistant to my-
1574060	1575060	Oh, Jesus!
1575060	1576060	Ah!
1578060	1579560	Okay, so to go through this pass,
1579560	1581060	I just have to defeat these tiny flies.
1581060	1582060	That should be fine.
1582060	1586060	♪♪
1586060	1587060	No!
1587060	1589560	♪♪
1589560	1591560	Aah! Aah!
1591560	1593560	♪♪
1593560	1600560	♪♪
1600560	1602060	Ugh!
1602060	1604060	Open world games where you can basically go
1604060	1606060	wherever you want right away are really hard
1606060	1608560	to give a meaningful sense of pace and challenge
1608560	1610560	to the point where most developers just give up
1610560	1612060	and make the game do it procedurally.
1612060	1614560	So they make enemies scale in damage and weaponry
1614560	1616560	in accordance with the player's level and so on.
1616560	1618560	This hopefully results in players being never given
1618560	1621060	insurmountable obstacles and never being too strong
1621060	1622560	that everything becomes too easy.
1622560	1624560	This is an okay solution,
1624560	1626560	but it's a solution to a problem created
1626560	1628060	by earlier design decisions.
1628060	1630060	I think a really useful pointer for this
1630060	1631560	comes up in original Fallout creator
1631560	1633560	Tim Cain's GDC retrospective.
1633560	1635060	He said, we don't care where people can go.
1635060	1636560	They can go anywhere they want.
1636560	1639060	If they go into some area that's too strong for them,
1639060	1640060	they'll get killed,
1640060	1642060	and then they'll learn not to go in there yet,
1642060	1643060	and they'll look forward to the challenge
1643060	1644060	of being able to go back.
1644060	1645060	In about a sentence,
1645060	1647560	Cain instantly sums up one of the most important ways
1647560	1649560	of giving open world games a solid relationship
1649560	1650560	with the player.
1650560	1652060	In Fallout 1, you can technically go
1652060	1653060	wherever you want.
1653060	1655060	In fact, just west of the starting area
1655060	1656560	is one of the final objectives,
1656560	1658560	and you can technically go there right away
1658560	1659560	and beat half the game.
1659560	1661060	However, if you try doing that,
1661060	1663560	you'll probably run into an eight-foot tall mutant
1663560	1666060	with heavy weaponry who can kill you instantly.
1667060	1671060	At least I made it further than Ed.
1671060	1673560	Now, you might call this a horrible way to die,
1673560	1675560	but I call it good game design.
1675560	1678060	It creates an immediate and direct relationship
1678060	1679560	between the player and the environment.
1679560	1682060	This is a harsh and deadly wasteland
1682060	1684560	that wants to kill you, and you know this now
1684560	1686060	because it literally has.
1686060	1687060	As you get stronger,
1687060	1688560	these areas become more manageable,
1688560	1690560	and you get to tangibly feel stronger
1690560	1692560	because you know how dangerous this is.
1692560	1694060	Blowing up the super mutant base
1694060	1696560	after all the times they blasted your body in half
1696560	1699060	or casually killed your entire party
1699060	1701060	feels like a real achievement now.
1701060	1704060	In Fallout 1, finally killing your first Deathclaw
1704060	1707060	is so satisfying because the first time you meet him,
1707060	1709060	he ruins you, but hours later,
1709060	1711060	you're finally ready for more,
1711060	1713060	and he still kills you because it's Fallout 1.
1713060	1715060	Try knocking him down first. That usually helps.
1715060	1716560	Oh, and don't use melee weapons.
1716560	1718060	This was a terrible idea.
1718060	1720060	These encounters with Deathclaws and mutants
1720060	1723060	sound unfair, and yeah, that's the point.
1723060	1725060	They give players a really textured view
1725060	1726560	of the game's landscape.
1726560	1728060	It influences the entire experience
1728060	1729560	to a tremendous degree.
1729560	1731560	When the Gunrunners say they're having trouble
1731560	1733060	getting weapons out to people
1733060	1734560	because of all the Deathclaws nearby,
1734560	1736060	you really feel for these guys.
1736060	1738560	You know in ways that are only possible
1738560	1741060	for someone who's been killed by one before
1741060	1743060	just how much it would suck to live nearby
1743060	1744560	a nest of these things.
1744560	1745560	That's rough, buddy.
1745560	1747060	If Deathclaws and mutants
1747060	1748560	and other tough enemies scaled down
1748560	1750560	with the player to be largely doable
1750560	1751560	even at low levels,
1751560	1753560	Fallout would lose a huge chunk
1753560	1755060	of what made it so compelling.
1755060	1757060	Deathclaws would be just another enemy.
1757060	1758560	This game's sense of harshness
1758560	1760060	makes it immensely fun to play
1760060	1761060	because when you win,
1761060	1762560	it feels like you struggled for something.
1762560	1765060	People tell me other games are better
1765060	1767060	and insist Fallout 1 has aged,
1767060	1768560	but there's just nothing else in games
1768560	1770560	quite as intense as moving across
1770560	1772560	the northwestern side of the world map
1772560	1773560	in Fallout 1.
1773560	1777560	♪♪
1777560	1779560	Oh, for fuck's sake.
1779560	1782060	Fallout 3 broke pretty far from this formula
1782060	1783060	and that means it's bad.
1783060	1784060	I'm joking, obviously.
1784060	1785560	Bethesda just have a different ethos
1785560	1787060	when it comes to designing worlds,
1787060	1788560	one which I actually think is quite nice
1788560	1789560	in its own way.
1789560	1791560	They want you to be able to go on tour
1791560	1793560	of their majestically massive maps
1793560	1796060	and serious spikes in difficulty
1796060	1797060	would get in the way of that.
1797060	1799060	I've spoken for an embarrassingly long amount
1799060	1801560	of time about a game I thought wasn't that great,
1801560	1803060	but an important thing to remember
1803060	1804560	is that if you approach it a certain way,
1804560	1806560	there is fun to be had in 3.
1806560	1808060	Players who ignored the main quest,
1808060	1809560	which wasn't that much fun anyway,
1809560	1811060	and just wandered around dealing
1811060	1812560	with whatever they happened to find,
1812560	1814560	doing the occasional quest here and there,
1814560	1816560	those people basically made their own fun
1816560	1817560	with the game,
1817560	1819560	and Fallout 3's open world and dedication
1819560	1821560	to not making any areas too challenging
1821560	1824560	even for starting players was especially conducive to this.
1824560	1826060	You could walk around and go wherever
1826060	1827060	you felt like going.
1827060	1829060	Now, you can criticize how this was implemented
1829060	1832060	or whether it fits a game set in a post-nuclear wasteland
1832060	1834060	as well as it fits a traditional fantasy world,
1834060	1836060	but either way, it resulted in a wasteland
1836060	1839060	and rambling experience a lot of people remember fondly.
1839060	1841560	I can criticize the story and quests in Fallout 3
1841560	1843560	until I'm blue in the face, and I did,
1843560	1845560	but once my lungs recovered and I left hospital,
1845560	1847560	it didn't stop the fact lots of other people
1847560	1849060	still had a good time with 3,
1849060	1851060	wandering around and just checking stuff out
1851060	1852060	at their own pace,
1852060	1853560	battling raiders and super mutants
1853560	1855560	and deathclaws procedurally leveled
1855560	1857560	to never be too challenging to stop them
1857560	1860060	in their personal freeform tracks.
1860060	1862060	Bethesda went for a particular experience
1862060	1864560	and in a lot of respects, they nailed it.
1864560	1867060	Despite being built in the same engine as Fallout 3,
1867060	1869560	New Vegas has an entirely different philosophy
1869560	1871060	in mind when it comes to its world.
1871060	1873060	It's a bit more like a classic RPG
1873060	1876560	like Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale
1876560	1878560	or, um, uh, Fallout.
1878560	1880560	It's set in a harsh environment
1880560	1883060	full of mutants and monsters and it means it.
1883060	1885560	Cazadors, I've heard some people call them cazadores,
1885560	1887060	so sorry if I'm saying it wrong,
1887060	1888560	are super dangerous.
1888560	1891060	Two of them can pretty consistently go toe-to-toe
1891060	1893060	with a deathclaw and against humans,
1893060	1895560	forget it, and they're used in a genius way.
1895560	1897560	Because they're insects, they make players think
1897560	1899560	of the incredibly early game bug enemies
1899560	1901060	from Fallout 3 that died in one hit
1901060	1902560	like radroaches and bloatflies.
1902560	1904060	In fact, right before you first meet them,
1904060	1906060	you pass through an area with bloatflies
1906060	1908060	to lull you into a false sense of security
1908060	1910060	and the landscape is perfectly arranged
1910060	1912060	so when you first see them, they're far away
1912060	1914060	and you assume they're small and probably weak
1914060	1915560	considering the nearby enemies.
1915560	1917060	By the time you get close enough
1917060	1918560	to realize they're really quite big,
1918560	1921060	you're already dead because they're about as fast
1921060	1922560	as the trucks they hit like.
1922560	1924060	This is the game playing a joke on you
1924060	1925560	by messing with your expectations.
1925560	1927060	The other route to New Vegas takes you
1927060	1929060	through Quarry Junction which has been shut down
1929060	1931560	because it's been infested with deathclaws.
1931560	1933060	The first guy you run into there says,
1933060	1935060	hey, buddy, uh, no.
1935060	1937060	You'd have to be the meanest, toughest,
1937060	1939060	roughest bastard in the wasteland
1939060	1940560	to have any chance against them
1940560	1942060	and I don't think that's you.
1942060	1944060	And these aren't Fallout 3 deathclaws.
1944060	1946560	They're somewhat manageable enemies that scale down
1946560	1948560	so even at low levels, they're not too hard.
1948560	1950560	These guys will kill you instantly
1951060	1953060	and they do not care if you wanted
1953060	1954560	to do some sightseeing here.
1954560	1956560	Uh!
1956560	1959560	Being absolutely obliterated at the start of the game
1959560	1961560	might seem a little excessive but for me,
1961560	1963060	it's like being welcomed home.
1963060	1964560	Tons of areas in the Mojave Wasteland
1964560	1967060	will happily kill you if you go there unprepared.
1967060	1969560	You struggle and die and find new equipment
1969560	1971060	and level up and as you do,
1971060	1972560	you're given a very powerful sense
1972560	1974060	of actually getting stronger.
1974060	1977560	Fallout 3's heavy reliance on level scaling
1977560	1980060	and deliberately not making enemies too strong
1980060	1982560	solved the potential problem of players running
1982560	1984560	into enemies they weren't prepared for
1984560	1986060	by making everything too easy.
1986060	1988060	So the player can go wherever they want
1988060	1991060	but everywhere they go will be roughly the same experience
1991060	1993560	with little to no sense of danger or challenge.
1993560	1995560	You can walk up to a guy with a flamethrower
1995560	1997560	and beat him to death with a baseball bat
1997560	1999060	even at the very start of the game.
1999060	2001560	Getting stronger in Fallout 3 honestly sucks.
2001560	2004560	It makes a game designed to be easy even easier
2004560	2005560	and after a few hours,
2005560	2007560	the whole combat system is boring.
2007560	2009560	No wonder millions of people downloaded the mods
2009560	2010560	that make it harder.
2010560	2011560	In New Vegas,
2011560	2013060	you start out pretty weak and fragile
2013060	2014560	and this game's raiders are setting up
2014560	2017560	actual ambushes, hiding in hills with rifles,
2017560	2020060	utterly tanking the damage of early game weapons.
2020060	2021560	They're up on the ridge firing down at you
2021560	2023560	with grenade launchers
2023560	2025560	and they're setting traps for you on the road.
2025560	2028560	This one actually got me.
2028560	2031560	Okay, New Vegas is really amazing at using traps.
2031560	2033060	Fallout 3 had some good moments with these
2033060	2035560	but a lot of the time they felt like an afterthought.
2035560	2038060	Like someone looked at one of the many identical offices
2038060	2039060	they'd made that day and went,
2039060	2040560	this needs to be more unique.
2040560	2042560	Let's put some landmines in the middle of the floor
2042560	2044060	you can defuse easily.
2044060	2046060	There.
2046060	2047060	Level design.
2047060	2049060	If you have any peripheral vision,
2049060	2053060	90% of this game's traps are just free landmines and XP.
2053060	2055060	New Vegas really goes hard on making traps
2055060	2056560	actually feel like traps
2056560	2058060	like here with the traffic cone.
2058060	2059060	I forget about these and get caught
2059060	2061060	by at least one every time
2061060	2063060	or two because they're so well placed
2063060	2064060	that they're difficult to defuse
2064060	2065560	even if you know where they are.
2066560	2068060	Welcome to Nevada.
2068060	2070060	Look at these easy to disarm bear traps.
2070060	2071060	Oh, fuck!
2071060	2073060	They're even used for environmental storytelling.
2073060	2075560	Caesar's Legion are especially clever with their traps
2075560	2077560	and also immensely evil.
2077560	2079060	So in areas they've raided,
2079060	2081560	they're hiding landmines under bodies.
2083560	2084560	That's morbid.
2084560	2086560	What's fantastic is the game pauses in menus
2086560	2088060	so stuff like this can happen.
2091060	2092060	Oh, fuck.
2092060	2093060	Okay, ready?
2093060	2094060	Go, go, go!
2094560	2095560	No, my bones!
2095560	2097560	The game is never scared to mess with you.
2097560	2099060	In a cave, there's a locked gate
2099060	2100560	which needs 100 lockpick skill
2100560	2102060	and it has a ton of good stuff inside,
2102060	2104560	so master lockpickers get some great rewards for weight.
2104560	2105560	What was that sound?
2105560	2107560	And what perk did I just get?
2107560	2111060	That's the perk you get for breaking your limbs 50 times.
2111060	2112560	Oh, no.
2112560	2113560	Oh!
2113560	2115560	The loot boxes and hard lockpick check
2115560	2117560	distract you completely from the trip wire
2117560	2119060	attached to a grenade bouquet
2119060	2120560	hidden right behind the gate.
2120560	2123060	You can almost hear the level designers laughing at you.
2123060	2124560	This combined with the willingness
2124560	2126060	to put tougher enemies in your way
2126060	2128560	and make regular enemies just a bit more dangerous
2128560	2130560	and clever gives the world a real feeling
2130560	2132060	of being unpredictable
2132060	2134560	and the extra difficulty makes the game way more fun.
2134560	2137060	You've had a taste of the brick wall now
2137060	2139560	and it tastes great.
2139560	2142060	Being hard in places creates meaningful challenges.
2142060	2144560	It gives the player something to get stronger for.
2144560	2147060	Finding better guns is especially engaging here
2147060	2149060	because they might really be the thing
2149060	2150560	that makes the difference in combat.
2150560	2153060	I have a mechanical and emotional relationship
2153060	2156060	with this cool gun with the physics scribbled on the back.
2156060	2158060	This thing has saved my life in a few situations.
2158060	2160560	I love him and being deliberately too hard
2160560	2162560	in some places creates a sense of apprehension
2162560	2165060	and anticipation for what you'll run into next
2165060	2166560	and if you'll be able to deal with it.
2166560	2169060	This is a world where just by the wayside
2169060	2171560	there's an encampment of really strong robots
2171560	2174060	you're not ready to take on yet guarding some great loot
2174060	2175560	you might want to try for anyway
2175560	2177560	or which you'll want to come back for later
2177560	2179560	and now you have something to look forward to.
2179560	2181060	It's important to recognize here
2181060	2182560	that none of this is really too hard.
2182560	2184560	Quarry Junction isn't actually blocking you off
2184560	2185560	in any way.
2185560	2187060	You can sneak past the Deathclaws
2187060	2188560	or master the weaponry available to you
2188560	2190560	in the early game and head right to New Vegas.
2190560	2193560	It's fairly tough but that's what makes doing it so fun
2193560	2195060	and feel like a real achievement
2195060	2196560	and if you can't make it past them right now,
2196560	2198060	coming back at a higher level
2198060	2199560	with better equipment and some friends,
2199560	2201060	collecting their delicious eggs
2201060	2203560	so the nice lady there can perfect her omelet recipe,
2203560	2205060	it's just so satisfying
2205060	2208560	because these Deathclaws started out legitimately terrifying
2208560	2210560	and not, like, piss easy to kill
2210560	2212560	even at the fucking start of the game.
2212560	2213560	Holy shit.
2213560	2215560	The sense of growth is so staggering
2215560	2216560	and it feels amazing.
2216560	2218560	You really feel like the meanest,
2218560	2220060	toughest, the thing the guy said.
2220060	2222060	You know for real how tough these guys can be
2222060	2223560	and still are if you make the mistake
2223560	2225560	of fast traveling into the middle of an occupied area.
2225560	2227560	Oh, Jesus!
2227560	2229560	This is a crunchy, yummy relationship
2229560	2231560	to have with a game's world.
2231560	2233560	The early difficult areas and the other spikes
2233560	2235560	throughout the trip make the Mojave
2235560	2237560	into a truly curious and eventful place.
2237560	2240060	You genuinely don't know what to expect
2240060	2241560	or if you'll be ready for it.
2241560	2243560	The difficulty of the two shortest paths to Vegas
2243560	2245560	incentivizes players to take the long way around
2245560	2247560	which is more manageable and puts you more
2247560	2249060	on the trail of the man who shot you.
2249060	2251060	I mean, he's a guy in a suit with a 9mm.
2251060	2252560	He couldn't even kill you with that gun.
2252560	2254060	He's not taking Corrie Junction.
2254060	2255560	Going this way gives you quests
2255560	2258060	to learn more about who he is and where exactly he's headed.
2258060	2260060	This also introduces you to the main factions
2260060	2261560	you'll be dealing with in the Mojave
2261560	2263060	like the NCR and Caesar's Legion
2263060	2265060	and it has some companions to help you out.
2265060	2267060	Thanks for taking a chance on a naive young girl
2267060	2269060	from California with stars in her eyes
2269060	2271060	and a pneumatic gauntlet on her hand.
2271060	2274060	Using challenges only more advanced players
2274060	2275560	will be able to get past,
2275560	2277060	the game is giving beginners a strong gameplay
2277060	2279060	and narrative experience that helps them
2279060	2281060	get their bearings, get a little stronger,
2281060	2283560	and learn more of the details of the setting and plot.
2283560	2285060	And while there are quests leading you
2285060	2287060	through the main areas on the long way to Vegas,
2287060	2289060	what's great is you can find these places
2289060	2291060	without ever needing to follow a quest marker.
2291060	2293560	To make the journey feel more like a trip
2293560	2295060	you chose to go on with places
2295060	2296560	you just happened across on the way,
2296560	2298560	the developers have used really clever world design
2298560	2301560	to make its key locations stick out on their own
2301560	2303560	and naturally attract players.
2303560	2305560	You can get sent to the RepCon facility
2305560	2306560	as part of the main quest,
2306560	2308560	but you might also find it by yourself.
2308560	2310560	It's a huge rocket silo with a big building
2310560	2312060	with a model rocket outside.
2312060	2313560	It's pretty easy to see it from elsewhere
2313560	2314560	and wonder what it is.
2314560	2316060	The story directs you to Prim,
2316060	2317560	but even if you ignore the story
2317560	2318560	and you're just walking around,
2318560	2320060	you're gonna see the huge roller coaster
2320060	2321560	and wanna go see what's up.
2321560	2323060	The game's just begging you to come in
2323060	2326560	and look around and find the other robot cowboy.
2326560	2327560	Yeah!
2327560	2329060	And when you're in the southern part of the map,
2329060	2331560	it's hard not to see the giant sculpture
2331560	2333060	of two rangers shaking hands
2333060	2335060	and go find the NCR base up there.
2335060	2337560	Fucking monument.
2337560	2340060	And almost everywhere you can see the Lucky 38,
2340060	2342560	one of the most important locations in the game.
2342560	2344560	The Strip is one of the few places in the world
2344560	2345560	lit up at night.
2345560	2347560	It's visible almost anywhere on the map
2347560	2349560	staring at you, waiting for you.
2350060	2352060	Oh, mate, where's me platinum chip?
2352060	2353060	Pfft.
2353060	2354060	One thing that we learned
2354060	2356060	by looking at Fallout 3,
2356060	2358060	they try to make sure that there's always
2358060	2359560	at least three landmarks visible.
2359560	2362060	The developers credit Fallout 3 for giving them this idea,
2362060	2363060	and there are some places
2363060	2365060	that really do visually stick out well in 3,
2365060	2367060	like there's Tenpenny Tower, Megaton,
2367060	2369560	uh, the big boy overlooking Paradise Falls.
2369560	2371060	Big boy man. I forget his name.
2371060	2373060	There's definitely some good points of interest here,
2373060	2375060	but New Vegas really pushes this into overdrive.
2375060	2376560	Maybe you didn't find Novak
2376560	2378060	because anyone in your travels
2378060	2379560	happened to mention Novak.
2379560	2382560	Maybe you just found a giant model dinosaur
2382560	2384060	and wanted to see what was up.
2384060	2385560	Head north toward Novak.
2385560	2387560	Look for a big dinosaur. Can't miss it.
2387560	2390060	Dinky the Dinosaur is based on two actual dinosaurs
2390060	2391060	out in the desert.
2391060	2392560	Well, not actual dinosaurs. They're models.
2392560	2394060	There's this one, Mr. X,
2394060	2396060	and the other one, Dinny the Dinosaur.
2396060	2397560	It's cute, but it's also inspired
2397560	2399060	by another real-life location.
2399060	2400560	Baker on the road to Nevada
2400560	2402560	is home to the world's largest thermometer.
2402560	2406060	Here I am in 2019 having a great time.
2407060	2408060	I mean, what did I expect?
2408060	2409560	It's literally called Baker.
2409560	2411060	I know it's named after someone.
2411060	2413060	So Dinky the Dinosaur also doubles
2413060	2415060	as the world's second largest thermometer.
2415060	2416560	Now here's the really clever thing
2416560	2418060	about making this cool place that sticks out.
2418060	2420060	This is where you continue the main quest
2420060	2421560	and find a potential party member.
2421560	2423560	No, not a building in the same area.
2423560	2425060	Literally this dinosaur.
2425060	2426560	If you go inside Dinky,
2426560	2429560	you'll find either Manny or Boone on guard in his mouth.
2429560	2432060	Using just clever visual design
2432060	2433560	by building a cool dinosaur,
2433560	2434560	the game is saying,
2434560	2436060	hey, come check this out, pal.
2436060	2437060	There's some fun stuff here.
2437060	2438560	Let's talk about how important
2438560	2440060	this kind of world design is.
2440060	2442060	Imagine four programmers on the edge of a cliff.
2442060	2443560	Game design works the same way.
2443560	2448560	♪ I waited but you must have lost your way ♪
2448560	2452560	Is there a plane going overhead right as I start recording?
2452560	2454060	Okay, it's gone. Right.
2454060	2456060	There's another big problem open world games
2456060	2458560	that give the player a lot of freedom have to solve.
2458560	2461060	Your game could have a bunch of great stuff in it
2461060	2462560	only for players to miss most of it
2462560	2465060	and get bored and assume there's not much to find.
2465060	2467060	I call this the onboarding problem.
2467060	2469060	If players can go anywhere and do anything,
2469060	2472060	how do you help them find all the cool stuff you made?
2472060	2474060	While quest markers and railroad-y stories
2474060	2477060	can help make sure most people find the core stuff,
2477060	2478560	what about all the side content?
2478560	2481060	I think a good case study here is Fallout 3
2481060	2483560	because like I said, 3 has some great stuff in it.
2483560	2484560	Some of the quests,
2484560	2486060	the superheroes in Canterbury Commons,
2486060	2487560	finding a violin for Agatha,
2487560	2489060	and deciding the fate of the Oasis
2489060	2491560	are interesting and often meaningful stories.
2491560	2494060	They're genuinely good quests.
2494060	2496060	If you can find them.
2496060	2498060	Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.
2498060	2500060	Fallout 3 has some well-designed quests
2500060	2503060	but its world design leaves a lot to be desired.
2503060	2505560	Many of its best locations are often strange places
2505560	2508060	that are hard for players to reasonably find on their own
2508060	2510560	and in many cases nowhere in the game world
2510560	2512060	ever tells you about them.
2512060	2514560	The Oasis is hidden at the far north edge of the map
2514560	2516560	and obscured by a bunch of rocks.
2516560	2519060	The only help the player is given in finding this quest
2519060	2520560	is there's this one weird sniper guy
2520560	2521560	in the middle of nowhere
2521560	2523560	with the address on his body if you kill him.
2523560	2526060	The Fallout wiki insists there are random encounters
2526060	2527560	that can point you towards it
2527560	2529560	so the game decides at random
2529560	2531560	if it's going to show you the cool quest.
2531560	2533060	There's a really good reason
2533060	2535060	why most players remember Tenpenny Tower
2535060	2537060	and that's because A, it's a big tower.
2537060	2538560	People are gonna find it, and two,
2538560	2541060	there's a guy in the first location you go to
2541060	2543560	in the main quest sitting in the corner going,
2543560	2544560	hey, come over here,
2544560	2545560	and he tells you about Tenpenny Tower.
2545560	2548060	Look, just tell people where the fun quests are
2548060	2551060	or at least don't make finding out about them random.
2551060	2553060	Canterbury Commons is a tiny town
2553060	2555060	in the middle of nowhere that's easy to miss
2555060	2557560	and the most interesting solution to the superhero quest
2557560	2559560	requires having found a page of text
2559560	2561060	on a specific computer
2561060	2563060	in a building on the other side of the world.
2563060	2566060	At no point does anyone or anything
2566060	2568060	mention you can do this.
2568060	2570060	I'm literally gobsmacked.
2570060	2571060	Ow.
2571060	2573060	Fallout 3 is a really fun game
2573060	2575060	to read the wiki about and find out how fun
2575060	2577060	it might have been if players could find
2577060	2579060	half of this shit while they were actually playing it.
2579060	2582060	There's very little onboarding to quests in 3.
2582060	2584060	The good content, which is in the game,
2584060	2586060	is effectively hidden from players
2586060	2588060	unless they happen to run into it
2588060	2589560	far off the beaten track.
2589560	2591060	The violin quest is great,
2591060	2593560	but starting it means finding a secluded house
2593560	2595060	in the middle of nowhere.
2595060	2597060	I've discussed this game with friends a lot over the years
2597060	2598560	and when I bring this quest up,
2598560	2600560	over half the people I talk to say,
2600560	2602060	I didn't know about that quest.
2602060	2603560	The only way to get involved
2603560	2605560	in one of the best things in the game
2605560	2607560	is to just happen to stumble onto it
2607560	2609560	in the middle of a massive wasteland
2609560	2612060	and a huge portion of players never even knew it was there.
2612060	2613060	It's such a shame.
2613060	2614560	Can you imagine making the best,
2614560	2616560	most heartfelt quest in the game
2616560	2618060	and discovering the surrounding world
2618060	2620560	was designed to make it incredibly difficult to find?
2620560	2623060	Whoever made that quest should be given a gun.
2623060	2626060	Fallout New Vegas uses a radical new technique
2626060	2627560	called game design
2627560	2630060	to ensure that players find all of its cool stuff.
2630060	2632060	Remember when I said six quests
2632060	2633560	send you to Vault 22?
2633560	2635560	That's just the tip of the questberg.
2635560	2638060	One of the many cool as hell locations in New Vegas
2638060	2640060	is the Helios One solar power plant
2640060	2641560	which the player can talk their way into
2641560	2643560	and initiate a quest to help get up and running
2643560	2645560	and then get to decide where to send the power.
2645560	2647560	In addition to being a giant cool building
2647560	2649560	with a big sign and a huge solar panel array
2649560	2652060	which is very easy to find just by walking around,
2652060	2654060	three other quests also take you here
2654060	2656060	while you're doing them which gives you an opportunity
2656060	2657060	to find this one.
2657060	2659060	For example, this guy, Michelangelo at Vegas,
2659060	2661060	gives you a camera and asks you to take pictures
2661060	2662560	of some cool signs he's heard of,
2662560	2664560	a quest which leads you to five locations
2664560	2666060	including Helios One.
2666060	2668060	Quests like this are basically the developers
2668060	2670560	handing you a juicy list of places to go
2670560	2671560	and stuff to do.
2671560	2673060	No wiki required, baby.
2673060	2675060	The game will show you a good time instead.
2675060	2677060	One of the game's companions, Veronica,
2677060	2678560	is a member of the Brotherhood of Steel
2678560	2680060	and if she sees enough interesting things
2680060	2681060	while traveling with you,
2681060	2683560	eventually she asks you to help her find some technology
2683560	2685060	which might help her change the mind
2685060	2686060	of the Brotherhood of Steel elder.
2686060	2687560	The computer which points her
2687560	2689060	in the direction of this tech leads you
2689060	2690560	to three different places
2690560	2692060	with their own solutions to the quest,
2692060	2693560	one of which is Helios One,
2693560	2695060	and another one, for the record,
2695060	2697560	is this guy's office where he sends you to Vault 22.
2697560	2699060	This game's quests,
2699060	2701060	in addition to being fun and interesting
2701060	2702560	and often thought-provoking,
2702560	2705060	are also designed to be found.
2705060	2707060	This ensures that players get to see
2707060	2708560	all the fun stuff in the game and,
2708560	2710060	and this is really clever,
2710060	2712560	it helps to create the sense of a cohesive world
2712560	2714060	because going to Helios One
2714060	2716060	has consequences for other quests.
2716060	2717560	One group we'll get to later
2717560	2719060	need to repair their solar panels
2719060	2721060	and if the player's been to Helios before,
2721060	2722060	they can mention they've been there
2722060	2724060	and salvaging some panels from Helios One
2724060	2726060	becomes an optional solution to the quest.
2726060	2728060	It creates a cool sense of taking part
2728060	2730560	in a cumulative and reactive story.
2730560	2732060	You're being given an alternative solution
2732060	2734560	to a quest specifically because you have knowledge
2734560	2736060	of a place with a bunch of solar panels.
2736060	2738060	I just can't get over how cool it is
2738060	2740060	that the player is never put in a situation
2740060	2741560	where they have to find the fun.
2741560	2743060	You can hardly go anywhere
2743060	2744560	without learning even more things
2744560	2746560	to chase up later or picking something up
2746560	2748060	that comes in handy somewhere else.
2748060	2751060	It contributes to what's still the most alive feeling
2751060	2752560	and reactive world there is.
2752560	2754060	I'm utterly astounded by wha-
2754060	2755060	Hello there.
2755060	2757060	Ah! Malcolm, you scared me!
2757060	2759060	This one random line from an NCR guy
2759060	2761560	really sums up New Vegas's design philosophy.
2761560	2764560	It's really hard to miss all of the great locations
2764560	2767060	and quests in New Vegas and that's wonderful.
2767060	2769060	The quest you get from visiting the dinosaur
2769060	2773060	is really cool too or should I say really ghoul?
2773060	2774060	I shouldn't.
2774060	2775060	Manny, a guy who has info
2775060	2776560	on the man in the checkered suit,
2776560	2778060	won't tell you what he knows until you go deal
2778060	2780060	with the ghouls at the rep contesting facility
2780060	2782560	and the ghouls there turn out to be a cool, weird cult
2782560	2784560	with a bunch of fun characters to deal with.
2784560	2786560	God, but are you ugly?
2786560	2788560	It's also pretty challenging in the early game.
2788560	2790060	It's a great place to get beaten to death
2790060	2791560	by invisible super mutants.
2791560	2793060	Helping them finish their rocket
2793060	2795560	and blast off to their supposed promised land,
2795560	2797060	making a last minute course correction
2797060	2799060	so they're more likely to get wherever they're going
2799060	2800060	before you activate the launch,
2800060	2801560	or maybe you want to play a fun prank
2801560	2803060	on your new friends, you little stinker,
2803060	2806060	is a really fun reward for coming here on its own,
2806060	2808060	never mind the fact it'll get Manny to help you,
2808060	2810060	and what makes this feel even more heroic
2810060	2813560	is the fact that I really was doing them a favor by choice
2813560	2815560	because you don't have to do this quest
2815560	2816560	to progress the story.
2816560	2818560	I mean, you could just talk him into telling you
2818560	2820560	or pickpocket the information off him
2820560	2823060	or kill him and get the same information off his corpse.
2823060	2827560	Or you could just check out his computer in his room.
2827560	2828560	I love computers.
2828560	2830560	When a character has a quest for you in New Vegas,
2830560	2832060	it's always optional.
2832060	2833060	It's really just an invitation
2833060	2835560	to take part in a cool quest if you want to.
2835560	2837060	Hell, even killing all of the ghouls
2837060	2838560	because you don't want to do their quest
2838560	2841060	and then coming back counts as far as Manny's concerned.
2841060	2842560	He just wants the ghouls out of there.
2842560	2845060	There are so many ways around doing this quest.
2845060	2846560	Okay, I'm done beating around the bush.
2846560	2848560	Let's talk about the absurd level of control
2848560	2850560	the player has over the direction of the story.
2850560	2853560	But first, don't forget to smash that like button.
2853560	2857560	♪♪
2857560	2859560	There's a fairly important character in Fallout 3
2859560	2860560	called Three Dog.
2860560	2862060	He has info on where your father went
2862060	2863560	and to get it, you either have to do
2863560	2866060	a really boring quest for him or pass a speech check
2866060	2867560	which you can still fail if you blah, blah, blah.
2867560	2868560	You've heard this bit.
2868560	2870560	But something I really like about Three
2870560	2872060	is that if you kill Three Dog,
2872060	2873560	this is for demonstration purposes.
2873560	2875560	Under no circumstances should you kill Three Dog,
2875560	2877060	before learning what he knows,
2877060	2879060	the game's main quest updates to say,
2879060	2881560	uh, all right, find your dad somewhere, I guess.
2881560	2882560	Good luck!
2882560	2884560	And you no longer have an objective marker
2884560	2886560	telling you where to go because you don't know.
2886560	2888560	This wouldn't be a super great quest to go on
2888560	2890060	since as previously discussed,
2890060	2892060	Fallout 3 has a significant problem
2892060	2893560	showing you where to find things,
2893560	2896060	but this willingness to let the player mess this quest up
2896060	2899060	this badly and account for that is still pretty cool.
2899060	2901560	The sad thing is Three Dog is one of the few characters
2901560	2903560	in the game that you can do this with.
2903560	2905060	Some of the Brotherhood of Steel members
2905060	2906560	right outside his office
2906560	2908560	are for some reason too important to die.
2908560	2911060	So if you nuke them all to take their stuff,
2911060	2912560	a couple of them just get back up
2912560	2914560	and aren't even hostile toward you.
2914560	2916060	After all, they need to complete
2916060	2918060	the main quest for you later.
2918060	2920060	The Brotherhood of Steel are just too important
2920060	2921560	for their part of the story to change,
2921560	2923060	so the game says no.
2923060	2925060	They're literally fucking invincible.
2925060	2926560	You can't even...ugh!
2926560	2928060	I'm having trouble believing I'm the master
2928060	2929560	of my own destiny here,
2929560	2931560	and I think this points towards an obvious solution.
2931560	2934060	Make it possible to kill all these characters.
2934060	2936060	Give the story ways of accounting for that,
2936060	2938060	but that would be an absurd amount of work.
2938060	2939560	Sure, it would be cool to have that level
2939560	2941060	of control and freedom,
2941060	2942560	but what sort of game could possibly...
2942560	2944060	Okay, so in New Vegas, you can kill everyone.
2944060	2946060	That's right. I didn't just mean you can kill many.
2946060	2947560	I meant everyone.
2947560	2948560	Everyone!
2948560	2949560	Except for children.
2949560	2951060	You have to wait for them to get older.
2951060	2952560	Oh, I'm coming for you, MacReady.
2952560	2954560	One of the game's most impressive achievements
2954560	2957060	is that even though its story is incredibly well-written,
2957060	2958560	it's also designed to account
2958560	2960560	for the player killing anyone in it.
2960560	2963060	Sometimes the plot does without characters in simple ways
2963060	2965060	like having notes and diaries on their corpses
2965060	2966560	in case they die.
2966560	2968060	Sometimes, though, it's incredibly complicated.
2968060	2970060	Like, if you kill Caesar, tons of characters
2970060	2972060	have things to say about his death.
2972060	2974560	Hey, you're the one who slayed Caesar.
2974560	2976560	That son of a bitch had it coming.
2976560	2979060	Wish I could have been there to see Caesar die.
2979060	2980060	What an asshole.
2980060	2981560	If we weren't in con territory,
2981560	2983060	I would kill you where you stand.
2983060	2985060	Caesar will be avenged.
2985060	2986560	And his death and the fact you killed him
2986560	2989060	are even things you can bring up in important dialogues.
2989060	2991060	Nobody springs back to life
2991060	2993060	because otherwise the story wouldn't work.
2993060	2995060	Don't want to do a quest for someone for information?
2995060	2996060	Fuck him.
2996060	2997560	Deputy Beagle needs rescuing
2997560	2999560	before he'll tell you where the man who shot you went?
2999560	3002560	Nah, that's all right. Good luck.
3002560	3004560	Don't like the imposing weirdo telling you
3004560	3007060	how cool the Legion is and then walking off dramatically?
3007060	3008560	Yeah, he's just too important.
3008560	3010060	If you shoot him, he takes a knee
3010060	3011560	and revives after a few seconds.
3011560	3013560	You can only kill him at the end of a really long,
3013560	3014560	boring, multi-stage quest.
3014560	3016060	Just kidding! Fucking blow him up!
3016060	3017560	He's dead!
3017560	3019060	He's supposed to come talk to you later
3019060	3020560	during the main quest and now the Legion
3020560	3022060	has to send someone else to do it.
3022060	3024560	The replacement even mentions they had to do this.
3024560	3027060	Your crimes against the Legion,
3027060	3028560	including the death of the fearless
3028560	3031060	Wulpes Inculta are hereby forgiven.
3031060	3033060	The level of choice you have goes much deeper
3033060	3034060	than this, though.
3034060	3035560	Once you make it to Vegas either
3035560	3037560	by taking the long way around following Benny's trail
3037560	3039060	or by getting there right away
3039060	3041560	by being a total badass,
3041560	3044060	you learn how pivotal the platinum chip Benny stole
3044060	3046060	is to shifting the balance of power,
3046060	3048060	and you fall into the multifactional struggle
3048060	3050060	for control of the Vegas Strip and the Hoover Dam.
3050060	3052060	Finding out who Benny is and getting
3052060	3054060	to the new Vegas Strip and meeting its master,
3054060	3056560	Mr. House, is just act one of the story.
3056560	3059060	The other two-thirds can play out completely differently
3059060	3060560	depending on which faction you decide
3060560	3061560	to align yourself with.
3061560	3063060	The NCR want to strengthen their hold
3063060	3065060	on Hoover Dam, recruit some outside factions
3065060	3067060	to help out, knock House out of the picture,
3067060	3068560	and gain control of New Vegas.
3068560	3070560	Caesar's Legion wants to weaken the NCR,
3070560	3073060	kill House, and take the dam and Vegas for themselves.
3073060	3075060	Mr. House, the Strip's current owner,
3075060	3077060	is a libertarian so he wants to lower the age of consent,
3077060	3080060	wants to turn New Vegas into a proper free economic zone,
3080060	3082560	and use the chip to make his robot army powerful enough
3082560	3084060	to kick both factions out.
3084060	3085560	You can even pick a fourth faction,
3085560	3088060	none of the above, and use Benny's pet robot,
3088060	3090560	Yes Man, to hijack Mr. House's plan for yourself.
3090560	3092560	I mean, Yes Man won't judge you.
3092560	3094060	Well, he will but he's not allowed to say it.
3094060	3096560	I'm gonna help you accomplish so much
3096560	3098060	whether I want to or not.
3098060	3099560	So you have all these factions prepping
3099560	3101060	for the Battle of Hoover Dam
3101060	3103060	and you're here figuring out who you want to side with
3103060	3105060	but even then, player freedom doesn't end
3105060	3106560	with the choice of what side to take.
3106560	3108560	Let's say you're doing the main quest for the NCR
3108560	3111060	and they ask you to help recruit the Boomers to their cause.
3111060	3113060	So you go to meet the Boomers and their leader is like,
3113060	3115560	okay, look, do some stuff for us and we'll think about it.
3115560	3117060	Ooh, help fix our power generator.
3117060	3118560	Oh, our solar panel.
3118560	3119560	Help me get a girlfriend.
3119560	3121060	Um, find my teddy bear.
3121560	3123560	Great, yeah, and then you're sitting through a kid
3123560	3125060	telling you his people's history
3125060	3126560	and you realize they're just awful.
3126560	3128060	Like, they're heavily armed reclusives
3128060	3130060	who want to live in seclusion forever,
3130060	3132560	viewing everyone different from them as backwoods savages
3132560	3134560	and whose ultimate fantasy is having the power
3134560	3136560	to blow up everyone who's foreign.
3136560	3138560	I wonder if there's some kind of social commentary
3138560	3140560	going on here with the, uh, Boomers.
3140560	3142060	You know what? I don't think I feel like
3142060	3143560	helping these people.
3143560	3145060	Yeah, that's right.
3145060	3147060	You can go scorched earth on these fuckers.
3147060	3148560	You can kill all these people,
3148560	3150560	annihilate their machines, raid their armory.
3150560	3153060	You can even tell a tiny child her bear is dead.
3153060	3155560	No, not Mr. Cuddles.
3155560	3157060	Wow, that's messed up.
3157060	3159060	You can do some evil stuff in this game.
3159060	3164560	♪♪
3164560	3166060	What's the word with the Boomers?
3166060	3167560	Have you talked to them yet?
3167560	3169060	I don't think it's gonna work out.
3169060	3170060	Sorry. Damn.
3170060	3171560	I guess we'll just have to do without.
3171560	3173060	And the main quest continues.
3173060	3175060	The thread of prophecy isn't severed.
3175060	3177060	This doesn't make the NCR's quest line impossible.
3177060	3179560	It just means we don't have that faction on our side.
3179560	3181060	It's great stuff.
3181060	3184060	One of the later quests is to make sure
3184060	3186560	the NCR's president doesn't get assassinated.
3186560	3187560	Seems to be going pretty well.
3187560	3188560	I think he's got this.
3188560	3190560	Oh, shucks.
3190560	3192060	I forgot about the sniper.
3192060	3193560	Well, that sucks.
3193560	3194560	What's next?
3194560	3196560	The game doesn't make you go back and fix this.
3196560	3199560	The NCR just continues preparing for the Battle of Hoover Dam
3199560	3201060	while down a president.
3201060	3203060	They're not happy about it, but this isn't a fail state.
3203060	3204060	You can continue.
3204060	3205560	Doesn't make you look good, though.
3205560	3207060	Unless, of course, I was working for the Legion
3207060	3209060	this whole time and I was the sniper.
3209060	3210560	Ha-ha!
3210560	3212560	Hold on. I can do better than that.
3212560	3215560	♪
3215560	3217060	Oh.
3217060	3219560	Oh, man, I just love killing the president.
3219560	3222560	Um, my producer has asked me to remove this joke,
3222560	3225060	but I don't think she'll sit through the video to check.
3225060	3226560	But there's another really important element
3226560	3228060	at play here with the choices you're making,
3228060	3229560	and this is the thing that makes them fun
3229560	3232060	in ways I still don't think any other game
3232060	3234060	ever has come close to achieving.
3234060	3235060	It's a pretty simple topic.
3235060	3238560	Uh, human concepts of morality and political theory.
3239060	3241560	Okay, everyone open your Foucault to page 451.
3241560	3242560	Ahem.
3242560	3244060	Video games are like prisons.
3244060	3245560	♪
3245560	3247560	The war has arrived at the gates of Hilli...
3247560	3249560	No, not like that, like in the Friedrich Nietzsche.
3249560	3251560	The game asks moral questions, okay?
3251560	3253060	It's fun to be evil sometimes.
3253060	3255060	Everyone's blown up a Megaton at least once
3255060	3258060	to see the explosion graphics and then loaded a save
3258060	3259560	or watched someone else do it on YouTube.
3259560	3263060	♪
3263060	3264560	When I was trying to record this scene,
3264560	3268060	the game crashed twice.
3268060	3269560	So that's good.
3269560	3271560	Lots of games let you theoretically choose
3271560	3274560	to do a bad thing, and it's nice to have the choice,
3274560	3276560	but be good and be bad
3276560	3279060	aren't incredibly meaningful decisions,
3279060	3281560	and when the choice is between a binary good and evil
3281560	3284560	with maybe a sarcastic or neutral option or whatever,
3284560	3286560	most people are generally gonna go
3286560	3288060	with what makes sense in the story,
3288060	3289560	which is usually just good,
3289560	3292560	and if they're feeling spicy, sarcastically good.
3292560	3294060	This isn't just me saying that either.
3294060	3295560	It's a science fact.
3295560	3297060	The Mass Effect games, for example,
3297060	3300060	reported back to Bioware what choices people made,
3300060	3302060	and according to designer John Ebinger,
3302060	3305060	92% of players picked Paragon choices,
3305060	3307060	the goody two-shoes nice guy options.
3307060	3309060	Lots of players say they went back
3309060	3311060	and tried the Renegade stuff on later playthroughs
3311060	3313060	and enjoyed it, but the issue here is not many players
3313060	3315560	over the course of a normal playthrough saw that choice
3315560	3317060	and went, yeah, I should do that.
3317060	3319060	Barely anyone thinks deliberately letting
3319060	3321060	the entire galactic government die, for example,
3321060	3322560	is a good idea.
3322560	3325060	We all kind of know that's the bad thing to do.
3325060	3327060	So yeah, a handful of players will go back
3327060	3329560	and see what the consequences of that choice look like,
3329560	3332060	but in real life, very few people tend to go around
3332060	3335060	going, I'm gonna be a bad person just to see what happens.
3335060	3337060	I know it might not seem like that sometimes,
3337060	3339060	but moral choices in many games amount to
3339060	3341060	would you like to be good or bad,
3341060	3343060	which isn't really an interesting question
3343060	3345060	to be asked and which most players
3345060	3348060	seem to answer with, uh, good, I guess.
3348060	3349560	This is a bit of a problem.
3349560	3351060	If players are being put in situations
3351060	3353060	where on the whole, most of them are going
3353060	3354560	to make the same choice,
3354560	3357060	they're not really being given an interesting choice.
3357060	3359060	Video games are more engaging when they ask you
3359060	3361060	something you have to think about.
3361060	3363060	To give an example, in one quest in New Vegas,
3363060	3365560	you'll notice the farmers at some NCR-run farms
3365560	3367560	are complaining about not getting enough water
3367560	3369560	and at risk of losing their jobs
3369560	3371060	because they can't meet their crop quotas.
3371060	3373060	If you look into it, your search leads you
3373060	3375560	to the parts of New Vegas that aren't run by the NCR
3375560	3377560	where independent folks have successfully started
3377560	3380060	a cooperative farm growing their own food
3380060	3382060	to help support themselves and prevent the NCR
3382060	3384560	muscling in under the pretense of feeding everyone.
3384560	3387560	A farm in the Wasteland is obviously a great thing,
3387560	3389060	especially if you don't like the idea
3389060	3390560	of the NCR running the place,
3390560	3392060	but if you do a little digging,
3392060	3394060	you learn the farm is run with the help of water
3394060	3396060	someone is siphoning off from the pipes
3396060	3397560	meant for the NCR farmers,
3397560	3399560	and the player has the option of telling on them
3399560	3401060	and having the water cut off.
3401060	3404060	So what is the actual right thing to do here?
3404060	3407060	Are you supposed to shut it off and let a farm die
3407060	3409060	and its people suffer because someone
3409060	3410560	technically stole the water,
3410560	3412560	or are you supposed to let the NCR's farmers
3412560	3414560	not get all the water they were promised
3414560	3417060	just because you don't want to cut off someone else
3417060	3418560	who isn't even supposed to be using it?
3418560	3421060	Also, it's a bit more complicated than I let on
3421060	3422560	because an NCR soldier had been looking
3422560	3424560	into the water shortage and went missing.
3424560	3426560	When you talk Tom Anderson into admitting
3426560	3429060	he stole the water, he also admits he killed the guy
3429060	3431560	when he found out to try to cover up the theft.
3431560	3433560	Turning him in for his crime means the water
3433560	3435060	will be cut off for sure,
3435060	3436560	and West Side will suffer greatly.
3436560	3439560	The worst thing is, Anderson clearly regrets doing it,
3439560	3442060	and if you turn him in for this, it'll all be for nothing.
3442060	3444060	Alternatively, you can cover up the death
3444060	3446560	and pin it on a gang, but this means a murder
3446560	3449560	is never brought to justice, and if you do this,
3449560	3451560	later one of their farmers tells you he's heading back
3451560	3453560	to California because he's about to be fired
3453560	3456060	for not meeting a quota he can't possibly meet
3456060	3457560	with the water he's getting.
3457560	3459560	Trying to help the people who need it more
3459560	3462060	ruins several other people and requires you
3462060	3463560	to help cover up a murder.
3463560	3465560	Even if a person decides what they think
3465560	3467560	is the right thing to do here, they still have to live
3467560	3470060	with the people who get hurt as a result of that choice,
3470060	3472060	and I'm sure there are players who think
3472060	3474060	they know the objectively correct thing
3474060	3476060	to do about the water in this situation,
3476060	3478060	but the point here is not everyone
3478060	3479560	will agree on what that is.
3479560	3481560	You as a person have to choose
3481560	3484060	what you believe is the right thing to do.
3484060	3486560	This is incredibly involving because it makes
3486560	3488560	the player actually think about the world
3488560	3490060	and their impact on it.
3490060	3492060	There's no huge far-reaching consequences
3492060	3493560	for this decision like the death
3493560	3495060	of a town you could have visited.
3495060	3497060	There's no secret better solution as a reward
3497060	3500060	for happening to visit the one computer in the world
3500060	3501560	with relevant info on it.
3501560	3503060	The game doesn't need gimmicks like this
3503060	3505060	to make the quest engage with players
3505060	3508060	because at its core is a really interesting question
3508060	3510560	which requires the player to decide for themselves
3510560	3512060	what the right thing is.
3512060	3514560	This is more than a chance to be good or bad
3514560	3516060	and see what happens.
3516060	3517560	It's an opportunity to figure out
3517560	3520560	how you would really act in a situation like this,
3520560	3522060	and questions like this are happening
3522060	3523560	on a constant basis here.
3523560	3526560	Is it a good idea to preserve incredibly dangerous
3526560	3528060	but potentially useful research
3528060	3529060	by putting it in the hands
3529060	3530560	of a self-interested politician?
3530560	3532560	Who should receive the power from Helios I
3532560	3534060	if you get it up and running?
3534060	3535560	The people who need it most?
3535560	3537560	The people the NCR tells you to give it to?
3537560	3539560	Or maybe everyone should get a little bit
3539560	3541560	but not really enough to help anyone.
3541560	3544060	There's even a really tantalizing selfish choice.
3544060	3547060	A kid on the streets of Vegas sells you a toy gun he found,
3547060	3548060	and if you're paying attention,
3548060	3549560	the gun is actually the targeting system
3549560	3553060	for an orbital laser which you can power instead.
3553060	3554560	So now you can do this.
3554560	3558560	♪
3558560	3559560	Boom!
3559560	3561060	Ha ha ha ha!
3561060	3562560	Half the country has no electricity.
3562560	3564560	Euclid's Seed Finder is such a great weapon.
3564560	3565560	I love it so much.
3565560	3567060	It comes in really, really handy.
3567060	3568560	It's great for taking out huge hordes of dea-
3568560	3570060	Come on, come on, oh!
3570060	3572560	♪
3572560	3574060	Ha ha ha ha!
3574060	3576060	I utterly love the game's ability
3576060	3578060	to give you the freedom to do whatever you want
3578060	3580560	including just killing everyone in the wasteland
3580560	3582560	and being done with any sort
3582560	3584060	of traditional questing whatsoever,
3584060	3587060	but simultaneously offers a story experience
3587060	3589060	to its quests that leaves room for you
3589060	3591060	to figure out what's right to you.
3591060	3593060	When the NCR tell you to recruit the Boomers
3593060	3595060	and you meet them and they're a bunch of messed up weirdos
3595060	3597060	who all pretend to remember Woodstock
3597060	3598560	even though none of them actually went,
3598560	3600560	you have to ask yourself if you think
3600560	3602060	recruiting them is a good idea.
3602060	3604560	Is their help worth getting their facilities
3604560	3606060	back up and running and getting them a weapon
3606060	3608060	capable of realizing their vision?
3608060	3610560	Or is this compromise necessary for the greater good?
3610560	3612560	Or could working with the NCR give them a chance
3613060	3615060	to open up and develop a healthier relationship
3615060	3617060	with the outside world because doing quests for them
3617060	3619060	isn't the only option to progress the story.
3619060	3621060	You have plenty of chances to ask yourself
3621060	3622560	how you want to deal with them.
3622560	3624060	Well, spoilers, this is footage
3624060	3626060	from my evil Legion playthrough.
3626060	3628560	They don't give a shit what faction you're aligned with.
3628560	3630060	Once you do a few things for them,
3630060	3632560	they'll work with NCR or the Legion if you ask.
3632560	3635060	Sure, we'll depose a democratically elected government.
3635060	3636560	It's basically all we do,
3636560	3638560	but first how do I change the wallpaper on my phone?
3638560	3641060	Later the NCR tell you to wipe out the Great Khans.
3641060	3643060	The Khans are a nuisance to the NCR
3643060	3644560	and have an allegiance with Caesar,
3644560	3646060	but it's a shaky one.
3646060	3648060	If you know the Legion, you know the main thing they do
3648060	3650560	is conquer other tribes and annihilate their identities
3650560	3652560	so you can start talking their leadership
3652560	3654060	into not wanting to work with Caesar.
3654060	3656060	The fact you can use pretty simple diplomacy
3656060	3658060	to get the Khans to change their minds
3658060	3660060	is a pretty serious criticism of the NCR.
3660060	3662060	I mean, they just asked you to kill them all for them.
3662060	3664060	They're basically an organized family
3664060	3665560	of drug-dealing raiders,
3665560	3668060	but does that mean it's okay to wipe them all out?
3668060	3670060	Will you do what the NCR wants
3670060	3671560	to help them hold the Hoover Dam?
3671560	3674560	And in the big picture, which faction should you side with?
3674560	3676060	What's the right answer?
3676060	3677560	I think the degree to which these questions
3677560	3679060	are compelling is evident
3679060	3680560	in how much longevity they've had.
3680560	3682560	I've seen people argue online for a decade now
3682560	3684060	that the independent route
3684060	3685560	is the only morally good option,
3685560	3688060	and I've also seen others say those people
3688060	3690060	are naive and doomed to be destroyed
3690060	3692060	by the much larger factions,
3692060	3694560	and it's better to do your best to support the NCR
3694560	3696060	and try to help them improve
3696060	3697560	because there's no other suitable
3697560	3699060	long-term power structure,
3699060	3700060	and for all their problems,
3700060	3701560	pissing them off and going rogue
3701560	3704060	is not a real solution to the fact you don't like them.
3704060	3705560	Arguments about sides in this struggle
3705560	3707060	are often deeply heated
3707060	3709560	because they tie into people's actual understandings
3709560	3711060	of the world around them,
3711060	3712560	their socio-political beliefs,
3712560	3714560	and their personal sense of pragmatism.
3714560	3717060	Being questioned on these levels by a computer game
3717060	3719560	is basically still largely unheard of.
3719560	3721560	The rare occasions a game really goes
3721560	3723060	for exploring these ideas,
3723060	3724560	it sweeps the game awards
3724560	3726060	and instantly becomes a modern classic.
3726060	3728060	Meanwhile, other games are still in the paddling pool
3728060	3731060	of, like, oh, was it bad to murder a bunch of people
3731060	3732060	with a knife?
3732060	3733060	A lot of people think politics
3733060	3734560	can be a turn-off for gamers,
3734560	3736060	but I've done some research and discovered
3736060	3738060	that politics is objectively fun
3738060	3740060	and all gamers love it all the time,
3740060	3741560	and the people who say they hate seeing them in games
3741560	3743560	actually love politics even more.
3743560	3745560	They just wish they were seeing different politics.
3745560	3747060	This might just be my opinion,
3747060	3748560	but I think it's good when video games
3748560	3751060	are about something and have ideas.
3751060	3753560	No one's going to rethink any aspect of their life
3753560	3756560	because of the story of Uncharted sponsored by Subway.
3756560	3758060	There's a reason why the best narrative games
3758060	3760560	are made by people who take big ideas seriously enough
3760560	3762060	to actually reckon with them.
3762060	3763560	The kind of people badass enough
3763560	3766560	to name drop Marx and Engels in their victory speech.
3766560	3769060	And Marx and Engels for providing us
3769060	3770560	the political education.
3770560	3771560	Thank you.
3771560	3772560	Thank you.
3772560	3773560	Thank you.
3773560	3775060	You don't see stuff like that normally
3775060	3777060	at hashtag the game awards.
3777060	3778560	Also sponsored by Subway.
3778560	3781060	Fresh indie game presented by Subway.
3781060	3782560	Fresh indie game?
3782560	3784060	More like eat fresh indie.
3784060	3785560	Ah, fucking slit my throat.
3785560	3786560	Clear cut.
3786560	3788060	Wow, can you tell I'm from Yorkshire?
3788060	3791060	Clear cut good versus evil choices are easy
3791060	3792560	and require little to no thinking.
3792560	3795560	So no matter how fun it is to be evil in your game
3795560	3797060	or how nice it feels to be good,
3797060	3799560	the moral decision itself isn't engaging.
3799560	3800560	When you give someone a choice
3800560	3802560	where there's no easy right answer
3802560	3804060	or where the right thing in the situation
3804060	3806060	is complicated enough that different people
3806060	3807060	will have different answers,
3807060	3808560	you've given people something
3808560	3810560	truly gripping to think about.
3810560	3812560	The NCR seem like the obvious good guys
3812560	3814060	compared to Caesar's Legion,
3814060	3816560	a fascist tribe of ancient Rome cosplayers
3816560	3819060	going around crucifying and enslaving people,
3819060	3821060	but half the game is spent dealing with the fact
3821060	3823060	the NCR just aren't that great either.
3823060	3824560	A lot of areas here are independent
3824560	3826560	and really aren't into the idea of being annexed
3826560	3828060	by these outsiders coming in
3828060	3830060	declaring themselves the government.
3830060	3832060	Towns like Goodsprings and Prim
3832060	3834060	don't stay independent for long,
3834060	3837060	not if you've got something the NCR wants.
3837060	3839560	One of the first characters you meet, Sunny Smiles,
3839560	3842060	says that she's heard a lot of bad shit about the Legion
3842060	3843560	but mostly from the NCR,
3843560	3845060	and as far as she knows,
3845060	3847060	they could just be making that up to justify being here.
3847060	3849060	The NCR are doing poorly in the region
3849060	3851060	because of a lot of internal politicking.
3851060	3853060	The Republic's senators want to keep their seats
3853060	3855560	and aren't interested in supporting an unpopular war.
3855560	3857560	The best troops are off fighting other battles,
3857560	3859060	including defending the interests
3859060	3861560	of the rich Brahmin barons who have a lot of sway.
3861560	3864060	Almost every soldier or ranger you run into
3864060	3866060	has a story about being stretched too thin,
3866060	3867560	not having the supplies they need,
3867560	3869560	the enemy being stronger than they were told.
3869560	3871560	The horribly understaffed correctional facility
3871560	3874060	has long since been taken over by its own prisoners.
3874060	3877060	Their quarries are full of guys sitting and waiting for help
3877060	3879060	because no one's dealing with the Deathclaws.
3879060	3881560	There's, like, five different gangs of raiders in the area,
3881560	3883560	so they're not really keeping the peace too well.
3883560	3885060	They just don't have the manpower
3885060	3886560	to deal with all these problems.
3886560	3888560	The fact there are so many quests you can do for them
3888560	3890560	is actually a really important plot point.
3890560	3893060	They're so overrun, they're farming out stuff
3893060	3894560	that needs doing to whoever comes along
3894560	3896060	and offers to lend a hand.
3896060	3898060	The NCR are certainly not doing a good job
3898060	3900060	of proving that their society works,
3900060	3902060	and it's not like they have clean hands here anyway.
3902060	3904060	One of the main reasons the Khans are willing to join
3904060	3905560	with Caesar to fight the NCR
3905560	3907560	is because the NCR massacred a bunch of them.
3907560	3909060	The Khans haven't been the good guys
3909060	3910560	in any of the Fallout games,
3910560	3912560	but they have a lot of legitimate grievances
3912560	3914060	and reasons to want to harm the Republic.
3914060	3915560	For the supposed good guys,
3915560	3918060	the NCR really love killing and subjugating
3918060	3919060	anything in their way.
3919060	3920560	Over on the western side of the map,
3920560	3922060	they're hiring mercenaries to harass
3922060	3924060	the peaceful super mutants into a fight
3924060	3925560	so they can justify killing them off
3925560	3927060	or driving them away.
3927060	3929560	The NCR's the biggest gang of thieves in the Mojave.
3929560	3931560	Only difference is they pass laws
3931560	3934060	to make their crimes legal before they commit them.
3934060	3935560	Almost every group in New Vegas
3935560	3937060	is attempting to rebuild the world
3937060	3938560	in the image of one that came before.
3938560	3941060	The NCR are obviously emulating the United States,
3941060	3943060	a society that had its upsides, sure,
3943060	3945060	but which also destroyed the world
3945060	3946560	and in the game as well.
3946560	3948060	The NCR's problems are mirrors
3948060	3950060	of real world society's problems
3950060	3952060	because that's what they're trying to build
3952060	3954560	and doing their best to replicate the power structure
3954560	3956560	of a society that ended in nuclear Armageddon
3956560	3959060	is a bit of an ambiguous idea, isn't it?
3959060	3961060	Democracy's good, but this entire series
3961060	3963560	is all about the, well, fallout
3963560	3965060	of that system's failures.
3965060	3967560	If you want to see the fate of democracies,
3967560	3969060	look out the windows.
3969060	3970560	If you decide to help them,
3970560	3972060	you have to compromise your values
3972060	3974060	in the hopes that eventually they'll work things out.
3974060	3976060	I think this is a reason why so many people
3976060	3978060	think the independent option is better.
3978060	3979560	Like, if you're going your own way,
3979560	3981060	you don't have to answer to these fuckers.
3981060	3982560	Caesar's Legion, on the other hand,
3982560	3984060	are a really interesting faction
3984060	3986060	because despite being basically awful,
3986060	3987560	the more you learn about them,
3987560	3989560	the more you understand why they're like this.
3989560	3991560	Caesar is obviously trying to rebuild things
3991560	3993060	more in the image of ancient Rome,
3993060	3995060	a society which, for all its problems,
3995060	3997060	lasted a long time in some form or another
3997060	4000560	and also, minor point, didn't destroy the entire world.
4000560	4002560	The early Romans built a civilization
4002560	4004560	out of what was basically nothing,
4004560	4006560	and in a world where technology and culture
4006560	4008560	has all been blasted back to square one,
4008560	4011560	using one of the first properly successful societies
4011560	4014060	as a blueprint for starting again isn't the worst idea.
4014060	4016060	Caesar makes the case that his autocratic,
4016060	4018060	brutal dictatorship is the best method
4018060	4020060	of surviving and thriving in the wasteland,
4020060	4021560	and he makes some really interesting arguments
4021560	4022560	why this is the case.
4022560	4024060	He cites ancient Roman history
4024060	4026560	and even Hegelian dialectics in his defense,
4026560	4028060	and this is a really fantastic moment
4028060	4029560	because of how many layers it has.
4029560	4031560	Firstly, a game being willing to engage with players
4031560	4033060	on a philosophical level,
4033060	4035060	even going as far as invoking the work
4035060	4037060	of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Maser Panhegel,
4037060	4038060	is just wonderful,
4038060	4039560	and it's so much more thought-provoking
4039560	4041060	than anything I'd come to expect from games
4041060	4042560	at the time when I played it,
4042560	4044060	but then there's the question of whether you agree
4044060	4046060	with his interpretation of that philosophy.
4046060	4047560	Is he just trying to sound clever?
4047560	4049060	Does he really think he's that smart
4049060	4050560	because he's read a few books?
4050560	4052060	He even drops historical references
4052060	4053560	to Fallout's events as well.
4053560	4055560	Tandi, a character you met in the first two Fallout games,
4055560	4057560	essentially made the NCR what it is
4057560	4059560	and served as president for 50 years.
4059560	4061560	By the way, the group you rescue her from in Fallout 1?
4061560	4063060	They're the Khans.
4063060	4065060	The NCR has been having to deal with these guys
4065060	4067060	since before it even really existed,
4067060	4068060	and you know what?
4068060	4070060	It was weird that she was still president
4070060	4071560	by the time of Fallout 2.
4071560	4073060	Caesar points this out.
4073060	4075560	He makes the point that the NCR worked really well
4075560	4077060	when it essentially had a strong leader
4077060	4078560	no one dared oppose,
4078560	4080060	and the infighting and corruption that emerged
4080060	4081560	when she died would have been avoided
4081560	4083060	if they just had dictators.
4083060	4085060	This is an actual salient criticism
4085060	4086560	of liberal democracy.
4086560	4088560	Say what you want about fascist autocracy,
4088560	4090560	but at least it means a bunch of ignorant people
4090560	4092060	can't accidentally vote in a moron
4092060	4094060	and completely destroy their society.
4094060	4097060	Instead, you have one strong, charismatic leader
4097060	4098560	destroying your society.
4098560	4100560	Every member of the Legion besides Caesar
4100560	4103060	has a horror story about how they ended up here.
4103060	4106560	Broke us by throwing our dogs on the fire.
4106560	4108560	Lucius, the head of Caesar's Praetorian Guard,
4108560	4110560	happily tells the story of his tribe
4110560	4112060	being conquered by the Legion.
4112060	4114060	The women of his tribe were turned into slaves
4114060	4115560	and all of the men and boys
4115560	4117560	who weren't fit for the military were killed,
4117560	4119560	and he's completely fine with all of this
4119560	4121560	because he's been told to believe since that day
4121560	4123560	that this made him more civilized.
4123560	4126060	Lucius has been made into an obedient servant.
4126060	4127560	He isn't even capable of recognizing
4127560	4130060	that a wrong was done to him and his people.
4130060	4132060	Perhaps the Legion's greatest evil
4132060	4134060	is that it convinces some of its worst victims
4134060	4136060	it did them a service and to make them do it
4136060	4137560	to others in its name,
4137560	4140060	but forcibly integrating conquered peoples like this
4140060	4142060	is arguably why they're such a successful
4142060	4143560	post-nuclear society.
4143560	4145560	They violently make people obey them
4145560	4148060	in a way that creates a very particular kind of,
4148060	4149560	well, peace.
4149560	4151060	Caesar's camp has a trader in it
4151060	4153060	who loves trading in Legion territories
4153060	4155060	because their lands are safer than the NCR's.
4155060	4157060	There's no raiders or criminals,
4157060	4158560	and that's a problem you've experienced firsthand
4158560	4159560	for the whole game.
4159560	4161060	The NCR are so poorly run
4161060	4162060	that when you commit a crime,
4162060	4164060	they send you to a really lax prison
4164060	4166060	and give you a bunch of dynamite to break out with.
4166060	4167560	The Legion's brutality
4167560	4169560	keeps everyone in their territory in line.
4169560	4172060	What's great about this is it's simultaneously
4172060	4174060	a criticism and a defense of the Legion.
4174060	4176060	You know, they're bad and they crucify people,
4176060	4177560	but at least there's no crime.
4177560	4178560	Can't argue with results.
4178560	4179560	Your bones.
4179560	4181060	But also it's, you know,
4181060	4184060	proof the Legion is terrible and has killed everyone.
4184060	4187060	The best thing is this is based on actual Roman history.
4187060	4188560	The ancient Romans saw themselves
4188560	4190560	as bringers of law and order to the world.
4190560	4192060	Peacekeepers, if you will.
4192060	4193560	Romans would frequently inscribe
4193560	4195560	peace given to the world on medals awarded
4195560	4197060	to soldiers serving the empire,
4197060	4199060	but here's a funny thing about history.
4199060	4201560	People tend to assume that Rome was this bastion
4201560	4203560	of morals and intellect.
4203560	4207060	Mostly based on historical records written by Romans,
4207060	4209560	their enslaved and murdered neighbors
4209560	4212060	might not have felt the same way about their ethics.
4212060	4213560	Tacitus, a Roman senator
4213560	4215560	and one of history's most important historians,
4215560	4217560	really famously has a quote from a chieftain
4217560	4220560	who fought the Roman army making this exact point for me.
4220560	4223560	They plunder, they slaughter, and they steal.
4223560	4226560	This they falsely name empire,
4226560	4229560	and where they make a wasteland, they call it peace.
4229560	4232060	The Legion keep the peace better than the NCR
4232060	4234060	and in a historically accurate fashion,
4234060	4236060	they do it by killing everyone.
4236060	4239060	Just as my namesake campaigned in Gaul
4239060	4241560	before he crossed the Rubicon,
4241560	4244560	so have I campaigned and will cross the Colorado.
4244560	4247060	By couching the Legion in actual history
4247060	4249060	and giving its leaders a comprehensive philosophy
4249060	4251060	and having people who feel like they benefit
4251060	4253060	from their actions, they stop just being
4253060	4255060	the bad guys you can join if you want
4255060	4257060	and start reflecting a real world view
4257060	4258560	that has a lot to say for itself,
4258560	4260060	and despite seeming like an absurd
4260060	4262060	and ridiculous faction, there's still a lot
4262060	4264060	of social commentary going on here too.
4264060	4266060	The Legion are actually a more scathing criticism
4266060	4268060	of a real world group than the NCR
4268060	4270060	because here's the thing about Edward Sallow,
4270060	4272560	a guy who just fucking called himself Caesar
4272560	4274560	because he read a book about ancient Rome
4274560	4277060	and decided it was cool and he could totally do that.
4277060	4279560	The guy's a larper. He's stealing valor.
4279560	4281560	He doesn't really know what he's doing.
4281560	4283560	He just thinks he's got a license to rule the world
4283560	4286060	because he knows what a Rubicon is.
4286060	4288560	Like the NCR, he idolizes a specific moment
4288560	4290560	in history he's decided is good
4290560	4293060	even though Rome fell apart too in the end.
4293060	4295060	Caesar's a really interesting criticism
4295060	4297060	of all the losers out there in the real world
4297060	4298560	who think they're smart because they've read
4298560	4300560	about ancient Rome. You know, the kind of people
4300560	4302560	who name their Discord server Athens
4302560	4304560	to make themselves feel a bit smarter.
4304560	4306560	The story doesn't pretend both sides
4306560	4308560	are equally as good. Relentless horrible murder
4308560	4310560	and crucifixion is bad actually.
4310560	4312560	That's literally how they killed Jesus
4312560	4315060	but by giving Caesar a lot more to say for himself,
4315060	4317560	actual arguments to think about and respond to,
4317560	4319560	this makes conflict much more involving.
4319560	4322060	You have to have reasons why you oppose
4322060	4324060	the ideas these people are putting forward
4324060	4325560	and even if you think they're wrong,
4325560	4327560	you at least understand why they think
4327560	4330560	their ideas work which is very strong characterization.
4330560	4332060	Project director Josh Sawyer
4332060	4333560	and lead writer John Gonzalez
4333560	4336560	did a really good job with making the Legion make sense
4336560	4338560	and this means siding with them is really interesting
4338560	4340560	because you can feel the difference
4340560	4342060	between working with them and the NCR.
4342060	4344060	It helps that so many quests for each faction
4344060	4345560	mirror each other so well.
4345560	4348060	At McCarran Airport, you're helping root out Legion spies
4348060	4350560	or you're helping those spies weaken the NCR.
4350560	4352560	Because the game has really laid the groundwork
4352560	4354560	for these conflicts and you have so much freedom
4354560	4356560	when it comes to how to take part in them,
4356560	4359060	all your actions within the story feel meaningful.
4359060	4361060	Man, I love preventing the assassination
4361060	4362060	of the president.
4362060	4363060	There, are you happy, cat?
4363060	4364560	I got both sides in there.
4364560	4366060	Your choices also affect your reputations
4366060	4367560	with the factions of the game
4367560	4369560	which massively changes the experience.
4369560	4371560	If you side with the Legion, at a certain point,
4371560	4373060	you can't even go too far into the strip
4373060	4376060	without a disguise because the NCR start fights with you.
4376060	4378060	To be fair, I did assassinate their leader
4378060	4379560	or in other playthroughs, maybe the Legion
4379560	4381060	are sending kill squads after me
4381060	4383060	because I blew up one of their most important commanders
4383060	4385060	and then kept shooting their soldiers.
4385060	4386560	These squads are nasty too.
4386560	4388560	Like, going to war with the Legion is not pretty.
4388560	4390560	It feels like a genuine consequence
4390560	4392560	to choosing to be hostile toward them like this.
4392560	4394560	Every single time their assassins turn up
4394560	4396060	and tell you you shouldn't have messed with them
4396060	4397560	and it's time to die,
4397560	4399560	the player is being given a reactive reminder
4399560	4401560	of the choices they personally made.
4401560	4404060	This is what role-playing games are about.
4404060	4406060	It's just great. It's also terrifying.
4406060	4407560	Oh, my God, he's so fast!
4407560	4409560	Thanks, Veronica.
4409560	4411560	Because there are so many different choices,
4411560	4414560	so many different ways of experiencing this story,
4414560	4417560	every choice that you make feels so much more genuine.
4417560	4419560	You really know for certain in this game
4419560	4421560	that this whole thing could have gone differently.
4421560	4423560	Since you're never being forced to do anything,
4423560	4426060	everything you do feels that much more personal
4426060	4428560	because on some level, you made a choice.
4428560	4431060	The player isn't forced to join the Brotherhood of Steel
4431060	4432560	as part of the main story.
4432560	4434060	You can choose to join them
4434060	4435560	if you want to steal all their stuff,
4435560	4438060	but the choice feels personal because you don't have to.
4438060	4440060	They aren't the main characters of the story here.
4440060	4443060	In fact, all the other factions ask you to blow them up.
4443060	4446060	Man, can you imagine having the guts to write a story
4446060	4448560	where all three of the game's big factions ask you
4448560	4451560	to kill the most iconic group in the series?
4451560	4453560	That's not how you write a Fallout game.
4453560	4456560	That's how you write the best Fallout game.

4476560	4478560	New Vegas strikes a perfect balance
4478560	4480560	between fidelity to the stories and groups
4480560	4483560	of the previous games and doing different things with them
4483560	4485560	and then adding new stuff to the setting entirely,
4485560	4487560	and this is admirable because it's apparently
4487560	4489560	very tempting to copy-paste things
4489560	4491560	for the sake of fan service or change things
4491560	4493560	in ways that come off as cynical attempts
4493560	4495560	to rewrite the story to be something else.
4495560	4498060	A great case in point here is bottle caps.
4498060	4501060	Caps became an iconic part of the early game's setting.
4501060	4503060	They were a really novel idea for currency
4503060	4505060	back in Fallout 1, but by Fallout 2,
4505060	4506060	times have changed.
4506060	4507060	The NCR have been making
4507060	4508560	their own money for years now.
4508560	4510560	Fallout 3 went back to bottle caps,
4510560	4512560	which felt really insincere,
4512560	4514560	like it hadn't invested much thought
4514560	4516560	into its world beyond borrowing
4516560	4518560	what seemed cool from previous games.
4518560	4520560	New Vegas, as a result of its creators
4520560	4522560	thinking about how its world would work,
4522560	4524560	has three different currencies
4524560	4526560	because the NCR are here, their money is here too,
4526560	4528560	and hey, look who it is on the $100 bill.
4528560	4530060	It's Tandy. That's really cool,
4530060	4532060	but it's not been adopted into the mainstream.
4532060	4533560	They don't run the place yet,
4533560	4535060	and a lot of people don't trust their money
4535060	4537560	and still use the caps that were used in this area before.
4537560	4541060	NCR people only pay you for doing quests in NCR money,
4541060	4543060	which they mention is worth less than it should be here
4543060	4545060	because people don't fully trust it.
4545060	4547060	The NCR's money is almost a threat.
4547060	4549560	They're insidiously making their way into Nevada,
4549560	4552060	and as the Legion creep their way west,
4552060	4553560	their money's here too. Ugh!
4553560	4555560	The game is using currency
4555560	4558060	to show the developing tensions and politics
4558060	4560060	of the post-post-nuclear world.
4560060	4561060	How cool is that?
4561060	4563060	By bothering to write explanations
4563060	4564560	and justifications for their setting,
4564560	4567060	New Vegas gets to have its caps and eat them too,
4567060	4568560	and what I love about this game is it puts
4568560	4570060	an equivalent amount of thought
4570060	4572560	into every other aspect of the series' canon.
4572560	4574060	The Brotherhood are given a treatment
4574060	4575560	befitting their belief system.
4575560	4577560	The Brotherhood of Steel's purpose in Fallout games
4577560	4579560	has been to hoard technology in their bunkers
4579560	4581560	in case the future needs it, which is cool,
4581560	4584060	but canonically, they've been doing that nonstop
4584060	4585060	for hundreds of years.
4585060	4587060	At a certain point, they're just hoarders,
4587060	4588560	so by now they're in hiding,
4588560	4590060	living under permanent lockdown
4590060	4592060	after losing a ton of people battling the NCR
4592060	4593560	over Helios One.
4593560	4595560	Almost every faction wants you to dispose of them
4595560	4597060	because they're just not worth dealing with,
4597060	4598560	but once you get inside, you find out
4598560	4600060	they're having internal struggles
4600060	4601560	over the future of the chapter,
4601560	4603060	and one possible way of saving them
4603060	4604560	requires a ton of work,
4604560	4606560	but it allows them to get over themselves a little
4606560	4609560	and lift their lockdown and declare a truce with the NCR.
4609560	4612060	It's really beautiful how much of a struggle it is
4612060	4613560	to get them to change their ways
4613560	4616060	and how small a part of the story they manage to be.
4616060	4618060	These are the guys who normally end up on the box
4618060	4620060	of Fallout games with less original things
4620060	4621560	to say for themselves, and here they are
4621560	4623560	playing a tiny role in the main story,
4623560	4626060	living an existence that comments on their behavior
4626060	4627060	in previous games.
4627060	4628560	If you find their secret base
4628560	4630060	and try to get in with a password you found
4630060	4631560	on the corpses of one of their patrols,
4631560	4633560	they capture you and put a bomb on your neck
4633560	4635560	until you prove that you're trustworthy,
4635560	4637560	and then they send you all around the world
4637560	4639060	doing busy work for them
4639060	4641060	before they even consider making you a member
4641060	4643060	and hearing you out on a truce with the NCR,
4643060	4644560	but you know what's really cool?
4644560	4645560	When you first come here,
4645560	4647560	you could have a companion with you
4647560	4649060	who's a member of the Brotherhood of Steel.
4649060	4650560	Hold on. I've got this.
4650560	4652060	So instead of getting captured,
4652060	4653560	you get the best scene in the game.
4653560	4655560	We gave you a password, Veronica.
4655560	4657560	It's for your safety.
4657560	4659060	I know where you live, Ramos.
4659060	4661060	Open up.
4661060	4662560	For Pete's sake.
4662560	4664060	Opening up.
4664060	4665560	Welcome back, Veronica.
4665560	4668060	And this skips the quest they make you do with the bomb.
4668060	4669560	They actually thought about what would happen
4669560	4670560	if you had Veronica when you came here.
4670560	4671560	It's great.
4671560	4673060	And speaking of Veronica,
4673060	4674560	her quest to try to get the Elder
4674560	4676060	to rethink the direction of the chapter
4676060	4677560	is truly fascinating
4677560	4679560	because no matter what technology
4679560	4681560	you help her find, she fails
4681560	4683560	and has to decide whether to remain
4683560	4685560	with the only family she ever knew,
4685560	4687060	supporting them even though she feels
4687060	4688060	like they might be doomed
4688060	4690060	or try to make a new life elsewhere.
4690060	4692560	Come on. I can't listen to this anymore.
4692560	4694060	The player doesn't have control
4694060	4696560	over whether Veronica succeeds in this situation.
4696560	4699060	Instead, their control is so much more personal.
4699060	4700560	Through how they talk to Veronica
4700560	4702560	about these ideas during the course of the quest,
4702560	4705560	they help Veronica decide what to do with her life.
4705560	4708560	This story is so personal and thoughtful and sad,
4708560	4710060	and it's a way of looking at the Brotherhood
4710060	4711560	and its members' relationships
4711560	4713060	that's completely unique.
4713060	4714560	And speaking of doomed,
4714560	4716060	technologically advanced factions,
4716060	4718560	I really like how the game treats the Enclave.
4718560	4720560	The Enclave were destroyed in Fallout 2,
4720560	4722560	uh, despite what some games will tell you,
4722560	4724560	and even though they're an iconic and cool faction,
4724560	4726060	they keep them destroyed here.
4726060	4728060	The Remnants are just a handful of old people
4728060	4730560	who happened to survive the fall of Navarro
4730560	4732060	and have at this point been out of it
4732060	4733060	longer than they were ever in,
4733060	4734560	but if Arcade Ganon,
4734560	4736560	a really cool companion character by the way,
4736560	4738560	trusts you enough, at a certain point he tells you
4738560	4740060	he's the son of one of the Remnants
4740060	4742060	and you and him can recruit the rest
4742060	4743560	to take part in Hoover Dam
4743560	4745560	and help Arcade decide how he should feel
4745560	4747560	about his relationship with his father's old crew
4747560	4748560	along the way.
4748560	4749560	The story involved here
4749560	4751060	is simultaneously really epic
4751060	4753060	and goes really deep into the lore
4753060	4754060	of the Fallout universe,
4754060	4756060	but it's also about this guy figuring out
4756060	4757560	where he stands with his history.
4757560	4759060	And at the Battle of Hoover Dam,
4759060	4760560	along with all the other factions you recruited,
4760560	4762560	the Remnants triumphantly turn up
4762560	4764060	in an old Enclave vertibird
4764060	4766560	and wearing the few suits of Enclave power armor
4766560	4767560	in the whole game world,
4767560	4769060	and they help in the fighting.
4769060	4770560	Seeing the survivors of the Enclave,
4770560	4772560	making this very small and easy to miss
4772560	4774060	appearance in the game,
4774060	4776560	giving them the chance of a small sort of redemption,
4776560	4778060	it just feels so good.
4778060	4779560	Also, this is a really small thing,
4779560	4781060	uh, but it meant a lot to me.
4781060	4783560	Um, Ganon and Veronica are both gay
4783560	4785560	and it barely comes up.
4785560	4787060	Like, it's a small part of their lives,
4787060	4788560	and that was a really big deal to me
4788560	4790060	playing this game when I was a bit younger.
4790060	4791560	I don't know. That really spoke to me.
4791560	4792560	Um, thanks.
4792560	4794560	The Super Mutants are given really thoughtful use
4794560	4795560	throughout the game as well.
4795560	4796560	They're so cool,
4796560	4798060	even though their stories are mostly sad.
4798060	4800060	Most of them are hanging around in Jacobstown,
4800060	4802060	separated from the rest of the world.
4802060	4803560	Nightkin were a big deal in Fallout 1,
4803560	4805060	invisible Super Mutants,
4805060	4806560	some of the toughest enemies in the game,
4806560	4808060	but they haven't really got much of a look-in
4808060	4809560	in future games until now.
4809560	4811060	Addiction to and withdrawal from
4811060	4812560	the dangerous ancient technology
4812560	4814060	that powered their invisibility,
4814060	4817060	Stealth Boys, is seriously affecting their minds
4817060	4819060	at this point, and many of them don't even like
4819060	4820560	being looked at by people.
4820560	4823060	I really like how every fight with Super Mutants
4823060	4825560	in this game is justified and understandable.
4825560	4827560	The mutants you fight at the Repcon facility
4827560	4830060	are losing their minds and searching desperately
4830060	4831560	for a shipment of Stealth Boys they heard
4831560	4833060	were sent there by accident long ago.
4833060	4834560	You can talk to their leader
4834560	4836060	and find a peaceful solution,
4836060	4837560	but not if you killed too many of his friends.
4837560	4839060	Then you have to fight him.
4839060	4840060	If you play very straightforwardly,
4840060	4841560	you kill a bunch of mutants,
4841560	4843560	fight their leader who's obviously angry about this,
4843560	4845560	and then later discover the Stealth Boys
4845560	4847560	they came here looking for were sent back.
4847560	4849560	You kill all of these desperate people
4849560	4851560	and find out they came here for nothing.
4851560	4852560	It's so bleak.
4852560	4854560	A peaceful solution means sneaking past
4854560	4857060	the ones that are too far gone to be talked down
4857060	4858560	and finding this out for them.
4858560	4860560	Antler is sad, Shuman.
4860560	4861560	I can go now.
4861560	4863560	Find Stealth Boys in other places.
4863560	4865560	Even when you have to fight Super Mutants,
4865560	4866560	there's a story to it,
4866560	4868560	and you feel really sorry for them.
4868560	4870060	There's a Super Mutant companion
4870060	4871560	who has memories of her grandchildren
4871560	4873060	from long, long ago.
4873060	4877060	Oh, someone wants to hear Grandma's stories.
4877060	4878560	And who isn't taking her medicine
4878560	4880060	because she doesn't want to forget them.
4880060	4881560	Like, that's just so sad
4881560	4884060	and such an interesting thing to explore,
4884060	4886560	especially for characters who, in the previous game,
4886560	4889060	were used as enemies to shoot.
4889060	4891060	You just feel so human, you know?
4891060	4892560	Black Mountain is one of the other places
4892560	4894560	Mutants are hostile, at least to begin with,
4894560	4897060	and in addition to being really tough and heavily armed,
4897060	4898560	they're aggressive for a reason.
4898560	4900560	Their leader is deliberately positioning herself
4900560	4903060	as a new master and relying on the Mutants' desire
4903060	4905560	for a leader and ordering them to attack humans on sight.
4905560	4907560	There's a peaceful solution to this too,
4907560	4908560	and when you come back,
4908560	4909560	the Mutants are just hanging out.
4909560	4910560	I love Neil.
4910560	4911560	Neil is one of the first Mutants
4911560	4912560	you're likely to run into,
4912560	4914060	and he's written to be an introduction
4914060	4916560	to the more subtle and complex Mutants of this game.
4916560	4917560	He basically runs up to you and says,
4917560	4919060	hey, we know what you think,
4919060	4920560	but we have a complicated history.
4920560	4923060	Many of us are just as intelligent as basic humans,
4923060	4924560	and the rest don't really have any choice
4924560	4926060	in the matter, do they?
4926060	4928060	He's like a tutorial for players who expected Mutants
4928060	4930560	to just run around randomly killing people.
4930560	4932560	I really like how if you insult him
4932560	4934560	and then apologize, he's like,
4934560	4936060	okay, since you apologized.
4936060	4937060	Like, he doesn't just attack you
4937060	4938560	the instant you say something mean.
4938560	4942060	He's, you know, a character with motivations.
4942060	4944060	He's here because the radio broadcast
4944060	4946060	attracting more easily manipulatable Mutants
4946060	4947560	is obviously a problem,
4947560	4950060	and he's trying to send them to Jacobstown instead.
4950060	4951560	I just really love seeing Mutants
4951560	4954060	with comprehensible motivations and actions again.
4954060	4957060	I feel bad for any of the Mutants I end up fighting.
4957060	4959060	In one of the more slum-like areas surrounding Vegas,
4959060	4961060	there's a friendly Super Mutant hanging out
4961060	4963560	serving as the area's protector from gangs of raiders.
4963560	4964560	Hi.
4964560	4966060	There's no quests related to him.
4966060	4967560	He's just a part of the world,
4967560	4969560	chilling out, fighting bad guys, and being cool.
4969560	4971560	If I have one criticism of New Vegas,
4971560	4973560	it's I wish there were a few more
4973560	4975560	casual Super Mutant NPCs in the world.
4975560	4978560	Apparently there was going to be a Super Mutant NCR ranger,
4978560	4980060	but he got cut for time.
4980060	4983060	What the NCR does have though are ghoul rangers.
4983060	4984560	We won't go quietly.
4984560	4986560	The Legion can count on that.
4986560	4988560	At this point, pre-war ghouls are ancient,
4988560	4990560	and most of them are either really, really good
4990560	4992560	at what they do or bored as hell.
4992560	4995060	So they're serving as some of the NCR's finest
4995060	4996560	or working as top scientists
4996560	4998060	like the one that went to Vault 22
4998060	5000060	or the one at Jacobstown who casually mentions
5000060	5001560	she's made new identities for herself
5001560	5003060	and moved on when she got bored
5003060	5004560	with whatever she was doing.
5004560	5006060	They've really thought about how ghouls
5006060	5007560	would work in this setting.
5007560	5009560	I mean, how do essentially immortal people
5009560	5011060	live their lives?
5011060	5012060	It's really cool.
5012060	5013560	Raoul, a ghoul companion,
5013560	5015060	is a really good mechanic,
5015060	5016560	but that's just his latest skill.
5016560	5018560	On top of that, he has a lifetime's worth
5018560	5021060	of experience as an honest-to-God cowboy,
5021060	5023060	and convincing him to go back to his roots
5023060	5025560	makes him the best companion in the game combat-wise.
5025560	5027060	The game never rests on the laurels
5027060	5028560	of the existing setting.
5028560	5030060	It's instead coming up with ways to evolve
5030060	5031560	and add to the material.
5031560	5033560	Stuff that you wouldn't have expected at all
5033560	5036060	like an army of LARPers or New Vegas itself,
5036060	5038560	a glowing symbol of pre-war decadence,
5038560	5040560	and its robot security guards answering
5040560	5042560	to a man on a TV screen fit right in
5042560	5045060	and add to Fallout's greatest creative strength
5045060	5046560	which is the sense that anything
5046560	5048060	could happen in this world.
5048060	5050060	God, Mr. House, what a sweet addition to the story.
5050060	5052060	This character is voiced by the late, great
5052060	5053560	René Auberginois.
5053560	5055060	He knocks this character out of the park
5055060	5058060	while being even more literally a face on a screen
5058060	5059060	than the other characters.
5059060	5060560	Give me 20 years,
5060560	5062560	and I'll reignite the high technology
5062560	5064060	development sectors.
5064060	5066560	50 years, and I'll have people in orbit.
5066560	5068060	Also, and this is a small thing,
5068060	5071060	but I love that New Vegas 1-Ups 3's major character
5071060	5073060	turns out to be a computer twist.
5073060	5075060	John Henry Eden is on the radio the whole game
5075060	5077060	and talks about being the president of America,
5077060	5079060	growing up in Kentucky, and so on,
5079060	5080560	but then when you meet him, he's a computer.
5080560	5083060	It's sort of a twist, and New Vegas rolls around,
5083060	5084560	and Mr. House is a major player,
5084560	5086560	and people talk about him like he's a real person,
5086560	5088560	but you get there, and he's a face on a TV screen,
5088560	5090560	and he also insists he's a real boy
5090560	5093560	who has somehow been alive for, like, 260 years,
5093560	5095060	which, yeah, right, of course,
5095060	5096560	but then if you get into the basement,
5096560	5099060	you discover, no, he's a real person
5099060	5102060	kept alive in a pod hooked up to all these computers.
5102060	5104060	I just like the little double twist there.
5104060	5105560	Oh, and if you kill him, this triggers
5105560	5108560	a mass email obituary he wrote himself
5108560	5110060	detailing how accomplished he was
5110060	5112060	and how the world is screwed now,
5112060	5114060	but I guess when your faction is basically you
5114060	5116060	and your robot friends, you might start
5116060	5117560	to get a little self-obsessed.
5117560	5119560	Like, if you want to see how to make a Fallout game,
5119560	5120560	there's a lesson here.
5120560	5122060	Don't rehash the iconic stuff
5122060	5123060	everyone already knows.
5123060	5124560	Come up with something completely new
5124560	5126560	like a faction of robot security guards
5126560	5129560	who answer to a pre-war ultra-capitalist businessman.
5129560	5131060	Don't ask what the Fallout setting
5131060	5132560	can bring to your creativity.
5132560	5134560	Ask what creativity you can bring
5134560	5135560	to the Fallout setting.
5135560	5137560	I mean, the man who shot you, Benny,
5137560	5140060	is such a fun personal antagonist for the player.
5140060	5142060	He's consistently funny and surprising.
5142060	5143060	You can choose to forgive him,
5143060	5145060	and he seems sincerely affected by this,
5145060	5147060	but then he tries to have you killed again anyway,
5147060	5149060	but if he gets captured by the Legion
5149060	5150560	when you and him get a quiet moment,
5150560	5153060	he tells you his entire plan to take over the Strip
5153060	5154560	and says you should do it instead.
5154560	5156060	The guy knows he's done for,
5156060	5157560	so he hands you his whole scheme
5157560	5159560	so someone else can be his legacy.
5159560	5161060	What an interesting character.
5161060	5162060	If the Legion get their hands on him,
5162060	5163560	you can choose how he dies,
5163560	5165560	and I think it's fitting given all we've been through together
5165560	5167060	to take him on in single combat.
5167060	5168060	Just him and me.
5168060	5169560	Just make sure your companions
5169560	5171060	aren't positioned with a view to the arena.
5171060	5172060	Arcade, no!
5172060	5173560	And speaking of his scheme,
5173560	5175060	Yes Man, a reprogrammed house robot
5175060	5176560	who can be used to take his place,
5176560	5177560	is so cool.
5177560	5179560	I was programmed to be helpful
5179560	5181560	and answer any questions I was asked.
5181560	5183060	I guess nobody bothered to restrict
5183060	5185060	who I answer questions for.
5185060	5187560	That was probably pretty dumb, huh?
5187560	5189060	He's really judgmental of your choices,
5189060	5191060	but he's programmed not to be able to disagree
5191060	5192560	with anything anyone says.
5192560	5195560	Okay. Consider them forgotten.
5195560	5197560	Along with the projections that predict
5197560	5199560	they'll be our biggest enemy.
5199560	5200560	Forgotten!
5200560	5202560	John Gonzalez is completely killing it
5202560	5203560	here with this guy.
5203560	5205060	All of these additions to the universe
5205060	5207060	will make any future Fallout game
5207060	5209560	that doesn't include them or make similar levels
5209560	5211560	of additions of their own feel empty
5211560	5213560	and lacking in vision by comparison.
5213560	5215560	After New Vegas, the bar has been raised
5215560	5217560	so high that they should probably just
5217560	5219060	stop making video games now.
5219060	5220560	There isn't even time to get into the fact
5220560	5222560	you can actually gamble in the New Vegas strip,
5222560	5224060	or you can play Caravan,
5224060	5226560	which I definitely know how to play.
5226560	5228560	all gasp
5228560	5230060	gunshots
5230060	5232560	Those bastards got Ringo in the end after all.
5232560	5235060	What a shame. It just keeps being engaging
5235060	5238060	and thought-provoking right up until the very end.
5238060	5240560	♪♪
5240560	5242560	The final confrontation takes place
5242560	5244560	at the Second Battle of Hoover Dam.
5244560	5246560	The game's complex and branching story means
5246560	5248560	that you can be fighting on either side in this battle,
5248560	5250560	and even then you might really just be playing
5250560	5252560	the NCR so House gets what he wants
5252560	5254560	or what you want with Yes Man's help.
5254560	5256560	The end game feels like the ultimate reward
5256560	5258060	for all the other work you did.
5258060	5260060	If you fired up the Securitrons,
5260060	5261560	a huge army of them is here to help out.
5261560	5263060	If you've recruited the Boomers
5263060	5264060	to whatever side you're on,
5264060	5266060	they're out here blowing stuff up for you.
5266060	5267560	If you didn't deal with the Khans earlier
5267560	5269560	in some form or another, you have to fight them here,
5269560	5271060	and if you're fighting for Caesar,
5271060	5272560	they genuinely do turn up and help you out.
5272560	5273560	It's pretty cool.
5273560	5275060	The end game goes out of its way
5275060	5278060	to feel like the culmination of lots of choices you've made.
5278060	5279560	Although it is a bit of a steamroll
5279560	5282060	if you recruited everyone you could for the NCR,
5282060	5284060	that feels good too since it's a reward
5284060	5285060	for the work you did.
5285060	5286560	In any of the three main story paths
5286560	5288560	that end up siding against the Legion here,
5288560	5290560	you eventually fight your way to their main camp
5290560	5292060	where their commander is waiting.
5292060	5294560	Legate Lanius has been talked about for the whole game
5294560	5296060	as a ruthlessly dedicated leader
5296060	5297560	and incredibly dangerous fighter,
5297560	5299060	and he genuinely does command you
5299060	5300560	if you side with the Legion,
5300560	5302060	but the buildup to actually fighting him
5302060	5304060	after all this time is really cool and tense.
5304060	5307060	Before the final battle, he engages you in conversation.
5307060	5308060	You again.
5308060	5313560	♪♪
5313560	5315560	-♪♪
5315560	5317060	-♪♪
5317060	5318560	Okay, so maybe we should try talking.
5318560	5320560	An envoy of Vegas,
5320560	5322560	yet you carry yourself for battle.
5322560	5327560	If so, you cannot truly be of that city of cowards.
5327560	5330060	Oh, man, his voice is so good. He's so cool.
5330060	5332560	Lanius seems completely unwilling to back down,
5332560	5335060	so totally invested in victory at any cost
5335060	5336560	that he'd rather die than give up.
5336560	5339060	Even Caesar's death isn't enough to deter him.
5339060	5340560	If you try to talk him out of fighting,
5340560	5342060	he's very resistant.
5342060	5344060	Lanius' entire system of morality
5344060	5346560	is so different from yours that you can't just say,
5346560	5348060	no, please don't be bad.
5348060	5349560	To talk him out of a fight,
5349560	5351060	you have to pick choices
5351060	5353060	that actually convince him of something.
5353060	5355560	You can point out that even if he wins,
5355560	5358060	the sheer size of the Western territory
5358060	5361060	makes controlling both it and the East far too difficult
5361060	5363060	and would eventually doom the Legion as a whole.
5363560	5365560	Hoover Dam is but a place.
5365560	5368560	I will not have it be the gravestone of the Legion,
5368560	5371060	whether quickly or, as you describe,
5371060	5373060	slowly by attrition.
5373060	5376060	This is fascinating because it's based in actual history too.
5376060	5377560	One of the real Roman Empire's problems
5377560	5380060	was that it was too big to effectively control
5380060	5382560	without falling apart, and eventually it split in two.
5382560	5384060	There are other ways out too,
5384060	5386560	like using bluff to convince him there's a trap up ahead
5386560	5388560	or even using barter to convince him
5388560	5390060	of the lack of supply lines.
5390060	5392060	The multiple different ways of convincing him
5392060	5393560	is a really nice way of rewarding players
5393560	5395060	who approach the game differently.
5395060	5397060	I genuinely can't believe that they managed
5397060	5399560	to make barter one of the most useful skills in the game.
5399560	5402060	Lanius fulfills a real mechanical challenge
5402060	5404060	both in dialogue or if you fight him,
5404060	5407060	but he still manages to make sense as a person.
5407060	5409560	Even if you have 100 speech, after convincing him,
5409560	5411060	you can still say the wrong thing
5411060	5412560	and make him attack you again anyway.
5412560	5415060	This final big conversation of the game
5415060	5416560	feels super cinematic.
5416560	5418560	It's such a cool finale to the story,
5418560	5420060	made even cooler by the knowledge
5420060	5421560	that if you'd made different choices,
5421560	5423560	he'd be the guy you answered to
5423560	5425560	while you fought across the dam in the other direction.
5425560	5428060	Despite being really just a series of speech checks
5428060	5429560	in a dialogue tree,
5429560	5432060	the quality of the execution of this final encounter
5432060	5433560	makes this last conversation
5433560	5436060	feel like a real argument with a real person.
5436060	5437560	Then if you're independent,
5437560	5439060	you can throw the NCR general off the dam.
5439060	5441060	Ah!
5441060	5444060	♪ Play it again ♪
5444060	5447060	♪ My Johnny ♪
5447060	5449060	As of today, it's been ten years
5449060	5450560	since Fallout New Vegas was released.
5450560	5452060	Well, not literally today.
5452060	5454060	I wanted this video out on the day of the anniversary,
5454060	5455060	but come on, it's me.
5455060	5456560	We all knew that wasn't gonna happen.
5456560	5459060	My producer Kat carved an NCR Ranger pumpkin
5459060	5461060	back when we thought we were gonna get this out in October.
5461060	5463060	It's not looking so good right now to be honest.
5463060	5465060	It's one of these very special games
5465060	5467560	where there's tons of choices you could plausibly make
5467560	5469060	for how to resolve the main quest
5469060	5471060	and so many other side quests
5471060	5472560	with tons and tons of different endings
5472560	5474560	for how you interacted with every major faction,
5474560	5477560	and the amount of variation is fantastic by itself,
5477560	5479060	but when it really comes down to it,
5479060	5481560	its real success is that it makes those choices
5481560	5483560	so interesting and compelling
5483560	5486560	that I enjoy making choices I made already
5486560	5488560	just to see them play out again,
5488560	5490560	and sure, maybe graphically it's showing its age.
5490560	5492060	There's some bugs here and there,
5492060	5493560	and it has some issues getting running
5493560	5495560	on Windows 10 and high refresh rate monitors,
5495560	5498060	but when a game has this much to say for itself,
5498060	5500060	it manages to stay timeless.
5500060	5502060	This game really gives me hope in a way.
5502060	5504560	It's proof that games like this can exist,
5504560	5506560	and I can't wait for there to be another one like it.
5506560	5508560	I genuinely don't understand
5508560	5510560	how they made this game in 18 months.
5510560	5512560	One of the most magical things about New Vegas
5512560	5514060	is that even when it was done
5514060	5515560	and the developers could have moved on,
5515560	5516560	some of them didn't.
5516560	5518560	People like lead developer Josh Sawyer
5518560	5520060	have continued to be active.
5520060	5521560	Sawyer's been responding to questions
5521560	5523060	about the game on Twitter and Tumblr
5523060	5524560	for years after the game's release,
5524560	5527060	even now, in fact, justifying his decisions,
5527060	5528560	taking and responding to criticism,
5528560	5530060	going into detail about what went
5530060	5531560	into the development process,
5531560	5533060	doing charity streams where apparently he said
5533060	5535060	I was reading way too much into that smirk
5535060	5537060	that one time, and yeah, I really fucked up there.
5537060	5539060	What a dumb mistake to make. I'm so sorry.
5539060	5541060	I don't know. Maybe this is a bit naive,
5541060	5542560	a bit of a wishy-washy statement,
5542560	5546060	but New Vegas is great because at every given moment,
5546060	5548560	it feels like a game made by a bunch of people
5548560	5550560	who would happily spend ten years
5550560	5552560	answering questions about it in their spare time.
5552560	5555060	You know, I've never sat down and tried to figure out
5555060	5557560	what I think the best games ever are,
5557560	5559560	but I know for a fact that Fallout New Vegas
5559560	5561060	is my favorite game,
5561060	5562560	and it has been for a long time.
5562560	5564060	Honestly, I'm kind of getting bored
5564060	5566060	of waiting for other games to come along and beat it,
5566060	5568060	so, um, I guess for now,
5568060	5569560	I'm willing to say that Fallout New Vegas
5569560	5571060	is the best game of all time.
5571060	5572060	Let's start a new list right now.
5572060	5573560	Here it is, number one,
5573560	5576060	and I'm gonna update this with every game
5576060	5578560	that I ever mention in any of my videos from now on
5578560	5580560	so eventually we can have a list of every game
5580560	5583060	from best to worst since I'm gonna be doing this forever
5583060	5584060	and I will never die.
5584060	5585060	So there we have it.
5585060	5586560	Fallout New Vegas is objectively
5586560	5588060	the best game of all time,
5588060	5590560	and for that it gets my highest score ever,
5590560	5592060	84 out of 100.
5592060	5593560	It's been ten years,
5593560	5595560	but it honestly feels like it just got here.
5595560	5597560	Fallout New Vegas might sometimes
5597560	5599060	run out of memory and crash,
5599060	5600560	but that's only because there's so many moments
5600560	5602060	worth remembering.
5602060	5603560	Oh, my God, I left that in the script.
5603560	5606560	["Spring Days"]
5606560	5609560	["Spring Days"]
5609560	5612560	["Spring Days"]
5612560	5615560	["Spring Days"]
5615560	5618560	["Spring Days"]
5618560	5620560	Oh, thanks for watching all the way through, folks.
5620560	5622560	Um, I had a really good time making this video.
5622560	5625060	It's, uh, really nice getting to just gush about
5625060	5627560	how much I love a thing that is really close to my heart.
5627560	5629560	I'm sorry that I haven't made that many videos this year.
5629560	5632560	I meant to make more, but it's been a really tough year.
5632560	5635060	Um, I had a few projects that required me
5635060	5638060	to fly out to interview people and stuff like that,
5638060	5640560	and they all had to be cancelled when COVID happened
5640560	5642560	and people started getting sick,
5642560	5645060	so that's–it's not been ideal.
5645060	5648560	I got pretty sick too, but I don't think it was the virus.
5648560	5649560	I think it was something else.
5649560	5651560	God, even though the video's finished now,
5651560	5653060	there are so many things I'm like,
5653060	5654060	oh, I should have mentioned this.
5654060	5656060	Like, there's, like, so much stuff.
5656060	5658560	Like, the way they reworked how guns work,
5658560	5660560	uh, the way damage has been changed,
5660560	5662560	the reintroduction of damage threshold,
5662560	5664060	all that stuff. I mean, there's so many even, like,
5664060	5665560	really tiny things that really stick out to me.
5665560	5667560	Like, if Wild Wasteland is turned on,
5667560	5669560	then in the credits of New Vegas, uh,
5669560	5671560	Dead Money, the name of one of the DLCs,
5671560	5672560	is just Dead Monkey.
5672560	5675560	Like, just weird, cute little things like that
5675560	5676560	just constantly.
5676560	5677560	It's just really good.
5677560	5679560	Have you figured out that I like this game yet?
5679560	5681060	I have a couple of videos
5681060	5683060	that are really close to being finished.
5683060	5684560	In fact, one of them will hopefully be out
5684560	5685560	before Christmas,
5685560	5688560	and then I'm gonna have one done in mid-January, I think.
5688560	5690560	So, um, it's good to be back up to speed
5690560	5693560	and, uh, show people what I've been doing all this time.
5693560	5696060	Honestly, the video coming out in January
5696060	5698060	might be the best video I've ever made,
5698060	5700060	and I'm so annoyed that this video
5700060	5701560	took so much longer than I expected
5701560	5703060	because I just can't wait to show it off.
5703060	5705560	However, it's about an issue
5705560	5707560	which will be more pressing in January,
5707560	5709560	so it's almost like I planned it that way,
5709560	5710560	but it's not.
5710560	5711560	It was a terrible mistake,
5711560	5713060	and I wish I could have done sooner.
5713060	5714560	Anyway, I'm just rambling now.
5714560	5717060	Um, I hope you all have a good Christmas.
5717060	5719060	Tune in in, like, literally three days
5719060	5720560	when a video about Christmas comes out.
5720560	5722060	I'm not even joking. See you then.
5722060	5723060	Anyway, I guess that's it.
5723060	5726060	I'll see you all, um, in hell,
5726060	5727560	and thank you all so much
5727560	5729560	for watching the video all the way through,
5729560	5731560	and if you're a patron, thank you for supporting me.
5731560	5734060	Uh, it's been very nice being able to continue drinking
5734060	5736560	sparkling water even during an apocalypse.
5736560	5738560	Um, I have one of those soda streams
5738560	5742060	where you, um, you can take the canister back in
5742060	5744060	for a discount on a replacement canister,
5744060	5746060	and every couple of months, you know,
5746060	5747560	I put on a mask and brave the trip
5747560	5750060	to the one store that replaces the canisters,
5750060	5752060	and that's basically my only interaction
5752060	5753560	with the outside world right now.
5753560	5755060	I've noticed that, uh, the credits are obviously
5755060	5756560	quite long considering how long
5756560	5758060	I've managed to talk during them,
5758060	5760060	so I'm thinking of maybe doing some kind of thing
5760060	5761560	where people can send me questions
5761560	5763060	and I'll read them out in the credits.
5763060	5765060	Maybe, like, it makes sense instead of these rambles,
5765060	5767060	or maybe people like me just talking about whatever.
5767060	5769060	It's fine. Anyway, I'm gonna go watch Columbo
5769060	5771060	and take a nap, so, uh,
5771060	5773060	you all have yourselves a great evening.
