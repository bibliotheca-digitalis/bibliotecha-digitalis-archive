0	26160	Ha, great play Mark, it's a real...
26160	27160	KILLER!
27160	28660	**Laughter**
28660	31660	**Intro Music**
31660	33660	**Explosion**
39160	42660	Pathologic is one of the best and smartest games that's ever been made.
42660	44660	And you know that's true because no one's played it.
44660	46660	Okay, that's not quite accurate.
46660	48660	A fair amount of people have tried to play it.
48660	50660	The Steam release has achievements
50660	54160	and there's an achievement for surviving the first of the twelve in-game days.
54160	55660	A day lasts about two hours.
55660	58160	According to its global gameplay stats page,
58160	61660	just 13.2% of all players made it that far.
61660	63160	The achievement for day one is called
63160	64160	I'm Not Dead.
64160	65660	It's just that kind of game.
65660	69160	It occupies a certain kind of space in game criticism.
69160	72160	Some game critics, mostly the ones who are...
72160	73660	uh...good,
73660	75660	will sing its praises day and night,
75660	77660	call it the best game you've never played,
77660	81660	argue it's a shining bastion of everything gaming could be but often isn't,
81660	85160	and labor very intensely to explain why games don't have to be fun
85160	86160	to be good.
86160	87660	Journalist, board game critic,
87660	89160	and wizard Quentin Smith
89160	92160	wrote three incredible articles about it in 2008
92160	93160	for Rock Paper Shotgun,
93160	95160	which are probably hugely responsible
95160	97160	for a lot of Western awareness of the game.
97160	99660	But when someone reads articles like these,
99660	101160	they might make the horrendous mistake
101160	102660	of actually trying to play it,
102660	104160	and we all know how that goes, don't we?
104160	105660	The game's just not fun.
105660	107160	It's not interesting to look at.
107160	109160	It doesn't feel good to play mechanically.
109160	110160	It's frustrating.
110160	112660	The story is confusing and wordy
112660	114660	and translated from Russian by a mystical rat
114660	116160	who only speaks in riddles.
116160	118160	It lacks almost anything
118160	120660	that would normally keep a person playing a game,
120660	124160	and yet people keep saying it's great.
124160	125660	I think it's great too.
125660	127160	It's an incredible game
127160	129160	that barely anyone will have the resilience
129160	131160	to actually play long enough to appreciate,
131160	133160	and that's maybe even the point.
133160	137160	So this time on the assorted mess of unrelated concepts
137160	139160	that can scarcely be called a YouTube channel,
139160	140660	I'm going to talk about all the things
140660	142660	I find particularly interesting about this game
142660	144660	and what they bring to making it so unique.
144660	146660	I'm also going to talk about the problems it has
146660	148660	that prevented it from seeing mainstream success
148660	150160	and then give a spirited defense
150160	151660	of half of those problems anyway
151660	153660	in the name of their artistic value.
153660	155160	It's not a bad game.
155160	158160	It's an amazing game, but it's also a bad game.
158160	160160	It's a major time investment too.
160160	162160	In many ways, it's a more interesting game
162160	163660	to discuss than play.
163660	165660	It's possible that Pathologic only exists
165660	167160	so that we may speculate about it.
167160	169660	So in a way, making this video
169660	171660	is really for my benefit more than yours.
171660	173660	I played over 60 hours of this thing.
173660	175660	I have almost 600 gigs
175660	177660	of Pathologic footage on my hard drive.
177660	179660	I get to make a video about it!
179660	181160	That was the deal!
181160	183660	♪ ♪
183660	187160	Part one, what is Pathologic?
187160	188660	Probably should've gone in the intro.
188660	191160	On the surface, it's a very easy game to explain.
191160	194160	Pathologic is a first-person survival horror RPG
194160	196660	with story rich and atmospheric.
196660	198160	Doesn't it look fun?
198160	200660	It's set in a town deep in the Russian steppe
200660	203160	at some ambiguous point in the last 100 years,
203160	205660	and by ambiguous, I mean imaginary.
205660	208160	There are guns, but they're kind of old-timey types.
208160	210160	A lot of the decor ranges from the late 1800s
210160	211660	to early 1900s,
211660	213660	but there's some Baroque-looking buildings lying around.
213660	215660	The town is built around its meat industry,
215660	217660	so there's bowls everywhere, but the abattoir
217660	219660	is some kind of huge ancient building
219660	221160	fused with the earth,
221160	223660	and its workers live in a huge housing complex
223660	225660	that looks nothing like the rest of the town,
225660	227160	and some buildings are actively impossible
227160	229160	like these staircases to nowhere,
229160	230660	and then there's the Polyhedron,
230660	233160	a giant floating tower that cannot be
233160	236160	sticking out of the earth suspended by unknown means
236160	238660	and made partially out of its own blueprints,
238660	241160	so, yeah, I'd say the time period's pretty ambiguous.
241160	243160	You play as one of three different kinds of Doctor
243160	245160	who each arrive in the town for their own reasons
245160	247160	just at the beginning of the outbreak
247160	249660	of a horrible plague that threatens the entire town
249660	252160	and probably the world if it manages to spread.
252160	254660	The Doctors have 12 days to get their shit together,
254660	256160	save the town,
256160	258160	and somehow survive long enough to do that.
258160	260660	In some ways, it's kind of an immersive sim.
260660	264160	You have an inventory, weapons, clothes, and items,
264160	266160	but look at the wording of these items.
266160	268160	It's not food. It's rations.
268160	270160	It's not medicine or healing.
270160	272660	It's drugs, and what is other?
272660	274660	Well, that's where you keep less common stuff
274660	277160	you can use or sell like hairpins and bracelets
277160	279660	and flowers you picked, and are those human organs?
279660	281160	As soon as you hit new game,
281160	283160	it becomes clear that any simple description
283160	285160	of its basic genre conventions
285160	287660	doesn't capture how the game actually feels.
287660	289160	The three playable characters,
289160	291160	the Bachelor, the Haruspex, and the Changeling,
291160	293160	aren't simply chosen by a menu.
293160	296160	So it's all about trickery to you?
296160	297660	Wherever have you come from?
297660	300660	No. No.
300660	302660	I detest trickery,
302660	306160	but if we ourselves are to suffer deception,
306160	308660	our hands are no longer tied.
308660	310160	Where are we?
310160	311660	We open in a theater,
311660	313660	which you actually visit in the game world later,
313660	315160	looking down on all three characters
315160	317660	as they argue on stage over who is best suited
317660	318660	to solving the problem.
318660	320660	I can do miracles.
320660	322160	Just let me.
322160	324160	Will you please be quiet?
324160	327160	The dialogue gets across each character's basic viewpoint.
327160	329660	It's also written in a strangely theatrical way.
329660	331160	The truth is my shepherd.
331160	333160	I will perform the operation.
333160	335160	Medica morbo adhibe.
335160	338660	Don't you go all bossy on me, clever clogs.
338660	341660	This calls for the gentle hand of a surgeon.
341660	345160	Your gentle hands are used to killing,
345160	347160	not giving life.
347160	350160	You will inevitably do harm.
350160	352160	As for Brainy,
352160	355160	he has no regard for casualties at all.
355160	356660	It sounds written.
356660	358660	It's not even trying to be natural.
358660	360160	It's like you're watching bad actors
360160	361660	stumbling through their lines
361660	363160	while rehearsing for a play,
363160	364660	which you are.
364660	366160	The actual play is about to begin
366160	368160	with you playing as one of them.
368160	369660	They conclude they can't work together
369660	371160	and time is of the essence,
371160	372660	and the house lights go down.
372660	374160	We won't ever get along.
374160	376160	I suggest we be on our way.
376160	377660	The sooner the better.
377660	379160	Off we go then?
379160	380160	Let's go.
380160	382160	The clock is ticking.
386660	388160	When you go to leave the theater,
388160	390660	then you get to choose which one you play.
390660	392160	Even before the game started,
392160	394160	the presentation is strangely off-kilter
394160	396160	and brings in ideas of performance
396160	397160	and the theatrical.
397160	400160	It's definitely the weirdest character selection process
400160	401160	I've ever experienced.
401160	402660	You can't play as the changeling
402660	403660	until you've finished the game
403660	404660	as one of the first two,
404660	406160	but frankly, if you're actually going
406160	407660	to play the game more than once,
407660	409660	you should play both of the first two first
409660	411160	and really you ought to start with The Bachelor.
411160	414160	He's regarded as the default pathologic experience.
414160	415660	He's slightly easier,
415660	417660	and his character is an outsider from the town,
417660	419660	so you learn more about it from that perspective,
419660	420660	and that's really helpful.
420660	422160	The Bachelor, Daniil Dankovsky,
422160	423660	is a bachelor of medicine
423660	426160	and is working on the ultimate utopian project
426160	427660	a doctor can aspire to,
427660	429160	defeating death itself.
429660	431660	It's not going well.
431660	434160	The powers that be, and the government I guess,
434160	435160	are shutting down his lab
435160	437160	unless he can come up with something substantive
437160	438660	to back up his ideas.
438660	440160	He's come to the town because he's heard
440160	442160	that a man who lives there, Simon Cain,
442160	444660	has lived a remarkably long life,
444660	446160	so maybe he can learn something
446160	447660	about defeating death from him.
447660	450160	Your quest log has the main mission for that day,
450160	451660	the side quests for that day,
451660	453160	and your overall mission,
453160	455160	which for The Bachelor is saving his career
455160	456660	and maybe all human life
456660	459160	by learning how to defeat death from Simon.
459160	460660	So you go to meet him,
460660	462160	and you learn from Simon's brother Georgie
462160	464160	that he died right before you got there.
464160	465660	Oh.
465660	467660	Well, Georgie asks you to help him find out
467660	469160	who or what killed him.
469160	471160	Luckily, you think you have a lead on how he died
471160	473160	because he met with a town community leader,
473160	475160	Isidor Burakh, right beforehand,
475160	477160	and he was a respected local cultural figure
477160	479160	and the town's head doctor of sorts,
479160	481160	so they might have discussed his health
481160	482660	or who might have wanted him dead.
482660	485660	So you go to meet him, and he's dead too.
485660	488160	People are speculating about a serial killer
488160	490160	or a demonic step creature of myth,
490160	492660	the Shabnackadir, being responsible,
492660	495660	and then you start to notice signs of a plague,
495660	498660	and it becomes clear it probably killed both of them
498660	500660	and is about to kill everyone else.
500660	503660	For days and days, as the lives of people in the town
503660	505660	and your own odds of survival get worse and worse,
505660	507160	that original quest,
507160	509160	Dankovsky's bright-eyed, naive mission
509160	512160	to defeat death itself on his way to meet a dead man,
512160	514660	will stare you in the face every time you open your menu
514660	516160	and check your mission.
516160	518160	For Dankovsky, this message doesn't update
518160	520660	when saving himself or the town become his priority.
520660	522660	For the rest of your sad life,
522660	524160	you have to deal with being reminded
524160	526660	that you came here for something completely unrelated.
526660	529160	So, yeah, get used to that.
529160	531660	Pathologic's not a game about getting answers
531660	534160	or resolutions to your personal quests
534160	536160	or even about being heroic.
536160	539160	It's not a game about feeling safe or having fun.
539160	541160	It's a game about part two,
541160	543160	futility and disempowerment.
543160	545160	You might be wondering why I'm reading the words out
545160	546160	when they're on the screen,
546160	547660	and that's because some people like to listen
547660	549160	to these videos instead of watch them.
549160	551160	I put a lot of effort into my visuals,
551160	553660	but, you know, that's fine.
553660	555160	So I think an important way of explaining
555160	557160	the features and effects of this game
557160	558160	is to talk about the first thing
558160	560160	that'll probably happen to a new player.
560160	561660	You start the game in the house of Eva Yan,
561660	563160	who's letting you sleep upstairs.
563160	565160	She tells you that she's heard noises outside
565160	567160	and there's some strange men hanging out in her garden.
567160	570160	Oh, I know how games work. This is a tutorial quest.
570160	572160	RPGs sometimes have easy early quests
572160	574660	that act as a sort of microcosm of the game,
574660	577160	a tutorial for how various mechanics work.
577160	578660	So you go outside and you're greeted
578660	581660	by these strange boys.
581660	584160	These aren't the characters hanging out in her garden.
584160	586660	These are more tutorial figures.
586660	589160	These are characters that pop up a lot in the game,
589160	590660	tragedians and executors.
590660	592160	These are their costumes.
592160	593660	They're actors at the local theater
593660	595160	performing plays and so on,
595160	597160	but executors also perform important roles
597160	599160	during the plague, like getting posted up
599160	601160	outside the houses of important sick people
601160	602160	to relay messages.
602160	603660	Given that the game is already being framed
603660	605660	as one large theater performance
605660	606660	with you as an actor,
606660	608160	sometimes they break the fourth wall,
608160	610160	like right now where they're telling you,
610160	611660	a living human person,
611660	613660	how to live in the world.
613660	616160	These characters teach you how the basic mechanics work.
616160	617660	Time advances no matter what,
617660	619160	so if you don't do the important things
619160	620660	you're supposed to be doing,
620660	622160	other people will have to do them for you
622160	623160	and might get sick,
623160	624660	and you might need them not to get sick,
624660	626160	so maybe don't let that happen.
626160	627660	Your reputation is important,
627660	629160	so don't start too many fights.
629160	631660	Eat food so you don't starve and die,
631660	632660	and so on.
632660	634660	This game came out in, like, 2004,
634660	636660	so the idea of having to eat to not die
636660	638660	and time mechanics was actually pretty unique
638660	639660	for the time.
639660	641660	This is executed in an awesome way.
641660	643160	Look at how this tutorial is framed.
643160	645660	This conversation won't take too much of your time,
645660	648160	especially since time stops during dialogues,
648160	650160	and our dialogue is extremely important.
650160	652160	You need to know how to play, after all.
652160	653660	What are you talking about?
653660	655660	I'm neither a gambler nor an actor.
655660	658160	He doesn't understand what the Tragedian means by play.
658160	660660	The Tragedian is talking past him to you
660660	662160	so that you know the mechanics,
662160	665160	but the Bachelor has no idea why someone's telling him this.
665160	667160	Need I remind a wise man like you
667160	669660	of the fact hunger is sated with food?
669660	671660	Food can be found in shops.
671660	674160	The Bachelor is having the weirdest conversation
674160	675160	of his life.
675160	676660	The fourth wall-breaking stuff in this game
676660	678160	is genuinely the best.
678160	679660	Anyway, what's next?
679660	681660	Ah, yes, the side quest.
681660	684160	So you go around to see about the men in Eva's garden
684160	685660	and get a cutscene showing them,
685660	688160	and you realize one of them is a creepy-looking,
688160	690660	inhuman worm-man.
690660	693660	Great, another thing I'll have to figure out later, I guess.
693660	696160	If you try to make them leave in a threatening way in dialogue,
696160	697160	a fight starts.
697160	698660	The way fights work in this game
698660	701160	is you get beaten to death in a matter of seconds
701160	702660	and the game is over.
702660	705160	♪
705160	706660	Oh.
706660	707660	Oh, jeez.
707660	709160	Hello again, you two.
709160	710660	Ah, no need to be so dramatic.
710660	712660	Actually, no, that's your job, isn't it?
712660	716660	In Pathologic, combat deliberately feels off.
716660	718160	The game has fighting mechanics
718160	721160	in the same sense that a car being driven off a cliff
721160	722660	has flight mechanics.
722660	725160	Punching is slow and plays a random animation
725160	727660	with a different length before the attack actually goes off,
727660	729660	and its range is highly deceptive.
729660	731660	The range enemies have with their attacks
731660	733160	is hard to decipher as well.
733160	737160	It's very swimmy, like there's lag in a single-player game.
737160	740160	You have to learn to intuit exactly when to close in
740160	741660	for your attack to hit
741660	743660	and when to step back and not get killed.
743660	746160	It's quite hard to be good at fighting in this game.
746160	747660	The game does everything it can
747660	750160	to stack the deck against you if you get in a fight.
750160	752660	The muggers who spawn at night open their combat with you
752660	754160	by throwing a knife at your face,
754160	757160	which, no joke, deals, like, 90% of your health
757160	758160	in a single hit.
758160	761160	No one gets distracted by guards once they pick a target.
761160	762660	They just keep going for you
762660	765160	while the guards chase them and hit them in the back,
765160	767160	and they seem to only reliably drop loot
767160	768660	if you're the one who kills them.
768660	771160	You can right-click to trigger a blocking animation,
771160	772160	which is pretty cool.
772160	773660	It doesn't actually do anything, though.
773660	775660	Guns are eventually an option.
775660	777660	They kill in one or two hits,
777660	779160	but bullets are super rare.
779160	781660	They're really expensive, and you have a tendency to miss
781660	784660	even when you're pointing the gun right at someone's head.
784660	786660	I don't know. It just feels a little weird,
786660	788660	but this actually works in the context of the gameplay
788660	790660	because it further disincentivizes you
790660	792660	in doing combat because even sure bets,
792660	794660	like bringing a gun to a knife fight,
794660	796160	are never really that sure.
796160	798160	Fighting always feels like a risk,
798160	800160	and it instills that you're not really supposed
800160	803160	to live through this game while getting in tons of fights.
803160	806660	You're never handed satisfaction or enjoyment from fighting,
806660	808160	which normally is the sort of thing
808160	811160	that's the most visceral part of a game experience.
811160	813660	The game knows this, too, and likes to throw challenges
813660	815660	designed to hurt you and not be satisfying
815660	817160	right in your face.
817160	818660	Once you're past the point in the game
818660	820660	where you're very likely to have a revolver,
820660	822160	a weapon with six shots,
822160	824660	before a very slow and vulnerable reloading animation,
824660	827660	a side quest pits you against seven guys,
828160	830160	and you have to stand still to open the menu,
830160	831660	which doesn't pause the game,
831660	833660	to unequip it to switch to anything else.
833660	835660	It's like the creators are laughing at you,
835660	838160	seeing what deliberately weird, difficult thing
838160	841160	they can put in front of you and have you still actually do.
841160	842660	This whole fight is optional,
842660	845660	so really it's your fault if you decide
845660	848160	to try a dozen times to shoot seven people
848160	849660	with a gun with six chambers.
849660	851660	Remember how I said early quests in games
851660	853160	are like a tutorial?
853160	855160	The lesson of this tutorial is you're gonna die
855160	856660	if you make bad decisions.
856660	858160	Heck, you're still probably gonna die
858160	859660	if you make good decisions.
859660	861660	Fighting is hard and punishing,
861660	863660	especially against more than one person,
863660	865660	and realistically you wouldn't be seeking out
865660	866660	fights like this.
866660	869160	You should be trying not to get killed first.
869160	871660	A two-on-one fight in the first two minutes of the game
871660	873660	before you know all the quirks of its combat
873660	875660	is a death sentence, and the developers know it.
875660	878160	They put this fight in here to teach the player lessons
878160	879660	about how they should be thinking
879660	881660	about the idea of fighting
881660	884160	or on the whole taking unnecessary risks.
884160	887160	Death is cheap and your health is expensive.
887160	888660	I mean that literally, too.
888660	890160	How do you get health back?
890160	893160	Simple, just rest in a bed for a few hours and...
893160	894160	Oh.
894160	895660	No, that does nothing.
895660	897160	Actually, it just made everything worse.
897160	898660	My hunger meter's gone up now.
898660	901160	Okay, I'll eat an egg and...
901160	903660	Oh, no, that's not gonna close my wounds.
903660	905160	It's an egg.
905160	907160	It made my hunger go down,
907160	910160	but wait, it only made it go down a tiny amount,
910160	912660	and that was all the food I could afford.
912660	913660	Oh, I'm fucked.
913660	915160	The only reliable way to heal
915160	917660	is to take a painkiller like Meridorm or Novocaine.
917660	919660	These are expensive, but they cause you to regain health
919660	921660	over the course of a few in-game hours
921660	924160	which is agonizingly slow, but it works.
924160	926160	They also cause a lot of exhaustion
926160	928160	which also raises over time while you're awake
928160	930660	and causes you health damage if it maxes out
930660	931660	just like hunger.
931660	934160	There are items that heal you without any downsides,
934160	935660	tourniquets and bandages,
935660	937160	but they don't heal you that much.
937160	938660	They're pretty hard to acquire,
938660	940160	and they're worth enough money
940160	941660	that you might as well just sell them
941660	945660	and buy some more delicious eggs.
945660	948660	Basically, in this game, taking damage hurts.
948660	950160	After retrying a few times,
950160	952160	if you manage to kill the two people in this fight,
952160	954160	the items they drop are barely worth
954160	955660	the health you lost to get them.
955660	957160	You get a couple of bullets,
957160	958660	like literally a handful,
958660	961160	and you don't even have a gun to use them with yet.
961160	963660	If you used the weapon you started with in the fight,
963660	966160	your scalpel, it's taken durability damage
966160	967660	and is now already less effective,
967660	969660	and you'll have to pay to get that repaired.
969660	971160	Oh, yeah, weapons lose durability
971160	972660	and effectiveness in this game,
972660	974160	and they do it super fast.
974160	976660	This fight is barely worth doing.
976660	978160	When I was playing, I just reloaded
978160	980160	and let the guys get on with whatever they were doing.
980160	981660	They're on the run from the law.
981660	983160	Whatever. They'll be on their way soon.
983160	984660	It's their problem, and they're not interested
984660	986160	in you or Eva anyways.
986160	988160	You can even ask them what the deal is with this guy.
988160	989660	He's just one of the locals.
989660	991160	Some of the people of this culture
991160	993160	are just physically different for some reason.
993160	995660	For me, the canon choice my bachelor made
995660	997160	was to leave these guys alone
997160	998160	and just let them go away.
998160	999660	It's fine. It's not worth it.
999660	1003160	This opening is an exercise in disempowerment.
1003160	1005160	You're not the main character of the story.
1005160	1006660	I mean, first of all, there's literally two
1006660	1009160	of the main characters, but on a deeper level,
1009160	1010660	you're not special,
1010660	1013160	and sometimes you have to keep your head down to survive.
1013160	1015160	You are nobody's hero.
1015160	1017660	Your character's stats page is a really helpful way
1017660	1019160	of keeping up with all eight
1019160	1021160	of the chokeholds the game has you in.
1021160	1023660	Reputation goes down when you start fights,
1023660	1026660	kill people, or other generally immoral things,
1026660	1028160	and goes up when you do good things
1028160	1030160	like in quests or killing muggers
1030160	1031660	or giving money to the poor
1031660	1033660	or medicine and alcohol to the sick.
1033660	1036660	Not to cure them, but to help ease their pain
1036660	1038160	so they can die in peace.
1038160	1040660	A pretty morbid way of doing good.
1040660	1043160	Despite being an RPG where you can get into fights
1043160	1044660	with anyone you want in the street,
1044660	1046660	a la Fallout or Elder Scrolls,
1046660	1048660	the game has a very powerful ability
1048660	1052160	to strongly incentivize that you don't do whatever you want.
1052160	1053660	Not only do fights hurt,
1053660	1056660	but your survival relies on you being accepted by society.
1056660	1058160	If your reputation is too low,
1058160	1059660	shopkeepers won't sell to you,
1059660	1062160	and then you're kind of doomed to starve to death
1062160	1065160	or to get sick to death or die to death.
1065160	1066660	Exhaustion just goes up over time
1066660	1068160	and is reduced by sleeping,
1068160	1070660	but there are things like raw coffee beans and lemons
1070660	1072660	which reduce exhaustion and give you more time
1072660	1074160	to do things other than sleeping,
1074160	1075660	but lemons increase your hunger
1075660	1077660	and coffee decreases your health
1077660	1078660	just like in real life,
1078660	1081660	but what's immunity and infection?
1081660	1084660	Well, immunity is your ability to resist the plague.
1084660	1086660	Kind of? Not really.
1086660	1088160	When the plague becomes a factor,
1088160	1089660	if you walk into a cloud of plague
1089660	1091160	or get touched by a plague carrier
1091160	1093660	or bitten by a rat, you get the plague.
1094660	1096660	Your immunity defaults to 50%.
1096660	1098660	There's expensive medicines you can take
1098660	1100160	which increase it temporarily,
1100160	1102160	but these also hurt you to use,
1102160	1103660	and you have to use quite a few
1103660	1105660	to raise your meter a useful amount.
1105660	1107160	If the meter's absurdly high,
1107160	1109160	and I mean close to 100%,
1109160	1110660	and you're wearing a couple of clothes
1110660	1112160	that protect from infection,
1112160	1113660	if you get hit by the plague,
1113660	1116660	you might, might not get infected.
1116660	1118160	It'll just lower your immunity a bunch
1118160	1120660	so you get infected the next time you touch something.
1120660	1122660	Hooray!
1122660	1124660	Hooray!
1124660	1131660	♪♪
1131660	1133160	If you get infected,
1133160	1134660	you start to lose health over time,
1134660	1137160	and occasionally your camera gets all wobbly and distorted,
1137160	1139660	and your infection level starts to raise nonstop,
1139660	1141660	and as it gets higher, the effects will get worse,
1141660	1143160	and if you get too infected,
1143160	1145660	some NPCs will try to kill you with fire.
1145660	1148160	There are antibiotics which decrease your infection level,
1148160	1150160	but these also hurt you to take
1150160	1151660	and are also expensive
1151660	1154660	and don't actually stop the plague once you're infected.
1154660	1156160	How do you cure the plague?
1156160	1157660	You can't. Fuck you.
1157660	1159660	Don't catch the plague, shithead!
1159660	1161160	That's not really up for discussion, is it?
1161160	1162660	It's a fucking plague.
1162660	1164660	Plagues are really bad.
1164660	1168160	Statistically, in Europe from 1200 to 1800,
1168160	1172160	roughly 100% of all living people died of the plague.
1172160	1174660	Okay, there are items that can cure the plague,
1174660	1177160	but you really want to not be wasting those.
1177160	1179160	The game's about curing the plague,
1179160	1181160	so you kind of might want to not use those
1181160	1183160	on your personal status effects.
1183160	1185160	If you get infected, either load a save
1185160	1188160	or prepare to have one extra thing to worry about
1188160	1190160	for the rest of the entire game.
1190160	1191660	There's one other important meter
1191660	1193660	you'll need to keep a close eye on as well.
1193660	1196160	Time. The clock doesn't wait for you.
1196160	1198160	Every day has a main quest,
1198160	1200160	and you have to complete the quest on time
1200160	1203160	or someone else has to do your job for you,
1203160	1205160	and they're not as good at your job, so...
1205160	1207160	The night has come.
1207160	1209160	The most pressing endeavors of the day
1209160	1211160	were fulfilled at the expense
1211160	1213160	of several lives of your bound.
1213160	1215160	If you don't complete a quest in time,
1215160	1216660	the story advances without you
1216660	1218160	and one of your friends gets sick,
1218160	1219660	which means you won't be able to talk to them
1219660	1221660	unless you give up some of your medicine at the door
1221660	1223160	to keep them upright for the day.
1223160	1226160	Some quest lines take place at certain times, too,
1226160	1228160	so you need to keep an eye on things and plan ahead.
1228160	1229660	Between all this and reputation,
1229660	1232660	the game imposes a horrible feeling of dread on the player,
1232660	1234660	a pressure that never really lets off.
1234660	1237160	There are so many things to manage, to think about,
1237160	1238660	just to stay alive,
1238660	1240160	and that's not even getting into the story
1240160	1242160	you're trying to progress while you do all this.
1242160	1243660	You're always on the clock
1243660	1246160	and almost always need to be in two places at once,
1246160	1247660	and as you navigate the town
1247660	1249660	to get where you're supposed to be going,
1249660	1253160	you get more and more aware of how slowly you walk.
1253160	1257160	♪♪
1257160	1258660	You can't run.
1258660	1260660	♪♪
1260660	1263660	It's just this.
1263660	1264660	It's horrible.
1264660	1266660	You're not a character in a fun RPG.
1266660	1268660	You're a person traveling
1268660	1270660	at frustratingly person-like speeds
1270660	1273660	trying to outrun about eight different ways of dying.
1273660	1277160	This is one of the first truly divisive things about the game.
1277160	1279160	The walk speed is slow,
1279160	1282160	and most of the game is about walking from place to place,
1282160	1284660	walking to buy food, walking to buy medicine,
1284660	1287160	walking to the trash can to find things to trade,
1287160	1288660	walking to talk to people,
1288660	1290660	and walking to the theater to see it predict
1290660	1292160	all the walking you're gonna do.
1292160	1294160	Speaking of the theater, every day after midnight,
1294160	1295660	they rehearse a new play.
1295660	1297660	These often comment on what happened that day
1297660	1300160	or predict the future in quite interesting ways.
1300160	1303160	People only fear bloodshed
1303160	1308160	when it's their blood and their shed.
1308160	1310160	Yeah, that's right. Stay out of my shed.
1310160	1311660	What the fuck are you talking about?
1311660	1313160	And as the plague spreads,
1313160	1315160	you start having to either take longer routes
1315160	1317160	to avoid infected districts
1317160	1319660	or start risking infection and having to load saves
1319660	1321660	and lose even more time.
1321660	1325160	This is not fun or pretty.
1325160	1326660	It's just walking.
1326660	1329160	I've had people tell me that walking is what turned them off.
1329160	1331660	It takes so long to get anywhere.
1331660	1333660	Even if you're not in immediate danger
1333660	1335160	because things are going well,
1335160	1337660	you're still giving up a lot of your time going places,
1337660	1339660	and the clock is still ticking down,
1339660	1341660	so you're always racing,
1341660	1343660	and you're always racing slowly.
1343660	1346660	But this is also the point of the game in Microcosm.
1346660	1349160	It's not supposed to be fun on its own.
1349160	1350660	Here's a head-scratcher.
1350660	1353160	Are games supposed to be fun?
1353160	1356660	Maybe, but should they always be?
1356660	1358660	Is that the only reaction games can
1358660	1361160	or should explore creating in their players?
1361160	1363160	Well, I think it's useful to at least experiment.
1363160	1365160	This boredom isn't a bug.
1365160	1366660	It's a feature.
1366660	1369660	It adds even further to this sense of disempowerment.
1369660	1372160	It also has a profound emotional effect.
1372160	1375160	As you get increasingly aware of your impending doom
1375160	1378160	and how limited your abilities to get things done really are,
1378160	1381160	even walking around becomes tense and stressful.
1381160	1384160	Pathologic is the subtlest survival horror experience
1384160	1385660	I've ever played.
1385660	1388660	The act of standing still in the game makes me nervous.
1388660	1390160	I'm wasting time.
1390160	1394660	Oh, shit, it's 3 o'clock. I have to be somewhere.
1394660	1397160	After a while, even the process of the travel
1397160	1399160	starts to really get its hooks in you.
1399160	1401660	Once you get used to it, there's nothing quite like it.
1401660	1404160	As the story deepens and becomes more complex,
1404160	1405660	the travel becomes an opportunity
1405660	1407160	to think about what's happening.
1407160	1408660	If you're being played,
1408660	1410160	why you're being asked to do this,
1410160	1411660	who it really benefits,
1411660	1414160	whether someone's messing you around to waste your time
1414160	1416160	and stop you figuring out what's really going on.
1416160	1419160	The walking becomes the most engaging thing in the world.
1419160	1421660	I've never been more alone with my own thoughts
1421660	1423160	than when I was playing Pathologic.
1423160	1426160	I'm one of the two remaining defenders of No Man's Sky.
1426160	1428160	The others were lost in the Great Purge,
1428160	1430160	but when it came out, I liked it at the time
1430160	1432160	almost primarily because it came closer
1432160	1434160	than any other game to doing this.
1434160	1435660	In fact, I made a reference to Pathologic
1435660	1437660	in my little video about it, but in reality,
1437660	1440160	Pathologic is still the absolute greatest of this
1440160	1441660	and puts No Man's Sky to shame,
1441660	1443160	especially when all the patches made it
1443160	1444660	much more like what everyone else wanted
1444660	1446660	and much less like what I had enjoyed.
1446660	1448660	Man, I should revisit that game.
1448660	1450160	Imagine a game holding your attention
1450160	1452660	not because anything in particular is happening
1452660	1455160	but entirely because it's got inside your head.
1455160	1456660	Oh, and then, just to make sure you're paying attention,
1456660	1458660	a plague cloud made of screaming skulls
1458660	1459660	flies at you and you go,
1459660	1460660	AHH!
1462660	1465160	The constant racing against the multitudinous clocks
1465160	1467660	of time, exhaustion, and hunger,
1467660	1469660	trying to get enough surplus stuff done
1469660	1471160	to afford to manage it all,
1471160	1473660	and the many ways you can be killed easily or survive
1473660	1475660	but with the game made even harder
1475660	1478660	by taking damage or losing time or getting infected
1478660	1480660	or getting so desperate you decide to kill a guy
1480660	1482160	in a dark alley for his food
1482160	1485160	is the exact opposite of a heroic fantasy story.
1485160	1488160	At all times, the player feels powerless.
1488160	1490160	Instead of the player being free,
1490160	1492160	but with some survival mechanics to keep track of,
1492160	1493160	it's flipped.
1493160	1495160	The game is a large collection of things
1495160	1497660	that will kill you unless you submit yourself
1497660	1498660	to their whims.
1498660	1500660	You're free, but you should be doing
1500660	1503160	what you're supposed to be doing or you'll fail and die.
1503160	1505160	You're placed under a level of constant stress
1505160	1508160	maintaining your frail body while racing against time
1508160	1510160	to actually get anything else done.
1510160	1512660	You're always technically in control,
1512660	1514660	but it's hard not to avoid the feeling
1514660	1517160	that you're the one being played by the game,
1517160	1519160	constantly reminded of all the things
1519160	1520660	you don't have time to do,
1520660	1522160	all the things you need to avoid,
1522160	1524160	and worrying maybe the game's gonna come up
1524160	1526660	with something new to stab you with on the next day,
1526660	1528660	which, uh...
1528660	1531660	Part 2.2, day two.
1531660	1535160	I came up with the titles in this video to amuse myself.
1535160	1536660	I don't really care what you think about them.
1536660	1539160	Day one is kind of a walk in the park.
1539160	1541160	You even have enough leeway to take a walk
1541160	1542160	in some of the parks.
1542160	1544160	You get used to the basic mechanics,
1544160	1546660	buy and eat some food, progress the story a little,
1546660	1548160	and meet some of the other characters,
1548160	1549660	and at the end you realize that a plague
1549660	1551160	might be about to hit.
1551160	1553660	If you manage to survive day one and complete the quest,
1553660	1554660	well, congratulations.
1554660	1556160	You've done better than most players,
1556160	1558160	but the real game hasn't started yet.
1558160	1560660	Day two is the next big hurdle,
1560660	1562660	and even less people make it past that.
1562660	1565160	The Bachelor's day two is where players will decide
1565160	1566660	if this game is for them or not,
1566660	1568160	and the drop-offs in terms of achievements
1568160	1569660	demonstrate this pretty well.
1569660	1571660	You'll know if the game is something you're going
1571660	1573660	to try to continue with after this,
1573660	1575160	so you make it to bed on time
1575160	1576660	with a decent amount of money prepared
1576660	1578160	in case you need to buy more things
1578160	1580160	and with all your meters sufficiently handled.
1580160	1582160	Maybe everyone's warnings about how hard this game is
1582160	1583660	were sufficient to prepare you,
1583660	1585160	and you've got this in the bag now.
1585160	1587160	♪ ♪
1587160	1590660	On the morning of day two, prices rise tenfold.
1590660	1592160	The money you started the game with
1592160	1596160	is no longer enough to buy a single delicious egg.
1596160	1598160	The plague hasn't properly hit yet,
1598160	1600160	but word's got out there's an outbreak coming
1600160	1602660	and people are stockpiling food and medicine.
1602660	1604660	Not only is being able to afford food
1604660	1607660	suddenly a much more pressing question than you expected,
1607660	1609160	any food you do have on you
1609160	1611160	doesn't seem like a good idea to eat.
1611160	1613660	I mean, that's a lot of money you're holding.
1613660	1615160	To make matters worse,
1615160	1616660	the town's governor, Alexander Saburov,
1616660	1618660	won't agree to do anything about the plague
1618660	1620660	because he'll be seen to be overstepping the mark
1620660	1622160	if the other rulers of the town
1622160	1623660	don't agree on there being one.
1623660	1625160	So a plague is starting,
1625160	1627660	but no one with the power to take proper action
1627660	1630160	will help because everyone has their own agenda.
1630160	1631660	So you spend a good deal of the day
1631660	1633160	with your hunger rising
1633160	1634660	and no sure way to solve it
1634660	1636160	because your money is worthless now
1636160	1638160	running around trying to find enough proof
1638160	1639660	to get all three of these groups
1639660	1641160	to agree there is a plague
1641160	1642660	and to give Saburov the power
1642660	1644160	to start making emergency orders.
1644160	1647160	Your main quest is getting these warring factions
1647160	1650160	to agree that the obvious problem exists.
1650160	1652660	Along the way, you pick up two side quests.
1652660	1655160	In one of them, you meet up with a former buddy of yours,
1655160	1656660	Andrei Stamatin, and upon agreeing
1656660	1659160	that the shits hit the fan, or rather the town,
1659160	1661160	you decide to get out while you can,
1661160	1663160	but Andrei won't leave without his brother Peter
1663160	1664660	who doesn't want to leave that much,
1664660	1667160	but Saburov, the guy who will get emergency powers
1667160	1669160	anytime soon, bears a long-standing grudge
1669160	1671160	against Peter which will probably lead
1671160	1673160	to him getting killed once that happens.
1673160	1674660	And this isn't unfounded, by the way.
1674660	1677660	When Saburov does get emergency powers later in the game,
1677660	1680160	he uses them to try to get Peter killed.
1680160	1682160	So you need to get proof this is the case
1682160	1683660	to get Peter to agree to leave with you both,
1683660	1685160	which you get from talking to Maria Kane,
1685160	1687160	Simon's niece, about this issue.
1687160	1690160	However, if you tell her why you need to know this,
1690160	1692160	she intervenes and prevents either of them
1692160	1694160	from leaving, failing the quest.
1694160	1696660	Unbeknownst to you, Maria needs these guys
1696660	1699660	in the town for her own reasons, so don't do that.
1699660	1701160	So you go to give this information to Peter.
1701160	1702660	Ah, fuck!
1702660	1704160	This is an actual recording
1704160	1705660	of the first time I saw this statue.
1705660	1707660	You can see in the footage that I freeze up.
1707660	1709160	Like, it's terrifying.
1709160	1711660	This is the second game ever to jump scare me
1711660	1713660	with a fucking still object.
1713660	1715160	It's genius.
1715160	1716660	I can't wait to show you the other one sometime.
1716660	1718160	That one's great, too.
1718160	1719660	You know which one I'm talking about.
1719660	1722160	You all agree to meet at the train station at 10 p.m.,
1722160	1724160	so you're starving and the town sucks,
1724160	1726160	but at least you have an escape plan now.
1726160	1727660	The second side quest is called
1727660	1729160	The House of the Living.
1729160	1730660	Several of the town's more charitable people
1730660	1732160	have decided to establish a shelter
1732160	1733660	for when the epidemic hits,
1733660	1735160	and they each give you money to buy some food
1735160	1738160	for the shelter before the prices rise any further.
1738160	1740160	I will make the purchases.
1740160	1745160	I have to do a lot of walking today anyway.
1745160	1748160	Ah.
1748160	1749660	The money they give you is not enough
1749660	1751160	to buy all the food they want,
1751160	1754160	so you actually have to use whatever spare money you have
1754160	1756160	or sell some of your items to afford this.
1756160	1758160	You give up all your remaining money
1758160	1761160	and items to get food you also need
1761160	1762660	just to give it away,
1762660	1764660	and you have to watch your hunger go up
1764660	1767160	and your time go down as you rush around
1767160	1769660	trying to find the stores with any bread or meat left.
1769660	1771160	When you get it all,
1771160	1772660	you're told the location of the shelter
1772660	1774160	so you can deliver it.
1774160	1775660	Let's just break this down.
1775660	1779660	Part of a quest on a day when food is incredibly scarce
1779660	1782660	involves carrying a ton of food somewhere
1782660	1784160	and not eating it.
1784160	1786660	It's actual torture running around
1786660	1788160	watching that hunger meter go up
1788160	1790660	and not knowing how you're going to resolve it
1790660	1792660	even though you're technically holding a solution
1792660	1794160	the whole time.
1794160	1796160	It's awkward and engaging and tense
1796160	1799660	in a way that no game has achieved before or since.
1799660	1801660	The game doesn't punish you for eating it either.
1801660	1803160	You don't have to do this quest.
1803160	1804660	You can just keep the food
1804660	1806660	or the money you were given to buy it with
1806660	1809160	and just ruin the chance to build the shelter,
1809160	1812160	but you don't because that's hardly what a doctor
1812160	1813660	would do preparing for the plague,
1813660	1815660	and maybe there's a reward for doing it
1815660	1817160	or it helps you further down the line.
1817160	1819160	You're making a positive moral choice
1819160	1820660	on a quest in a video game.
1820660	1822160	You know how this works.
1822160	1823660	There's something in it for you.
1823660	1826160	So you go to deliver the food.
1826160	1838160	♪♪
1838160	1840660	The house has already been hit by the plague.
1840660	1842660	Everyone there is sick and dying,
1842660	1845160	and the plague clouds will actively hunt you
1845160	1847160	through the house if you stay too long.
1847160	1848660	There's an executor there who tells you
1848660	1850660	this mission was obviously a failure,
1850660	1852660	so you leave and go back to the quest giver
1852660	1855160	and give her all the food intended for the shelter.
1855160	1857660	She gives you some nuts to tide you over
1857660	1859160	as thanks for your hard work.
1859160	1861160	The reward for successfully following this quest
1861160	1863660	to the end is dramatically worse
1863660	1866660	than the money or food you could have just run away with.
1866660	1868660	At the very least, this quest results
1868660	1870160	in finding proof of the plague,
1870160	1872160	so the part of the main quest where you go in search
1872160	1875160	of a plague-ridden house is at least solved by this too.
1875160	1877160	If you do the main quest instead, though,
1877160	1879160	you get a genuinely terrifying encounter
1879160	1881660	where as soon as you realize you've found a house
1881660	1883660	filled with women who have the plague,
1883660	1886160	once you try to leave, it spawns two more
1886160	1887660	right where you just came from,
1887660	1889660	and they try to grab you to appeal for help
1889660	1891660	and give you the plague if they do,
1891660	1893660	and you just have to dodge past them.
1893660	1897160	It's genuinely super scary and just emotionally awful.
1897160	1899160	You're just abandoning these women to die.
1899160	1901660	It's a horrible nightmare which, thankfully,
1901660	1904160	you cannot do if you did the house of the living.
1904160	1906160	Finally, Saburov has the power he needs
1906160	1908660	to start establishing hospitals under quarantine,
1908660	1911160	rationing food, distributing medicine, and so on,
1911160	1913160	and he even gives you a gun,
1913160	1915160	so it's a day late, but things are finally
1915160	1916660	where they should have been already,
1916660	1919160	perhaps too late to prevent a full-on outbreak,
1919160	1921160	but better than nothing at all.
1921160	1923660	You can defend yourself a little better now at least.
1923660	1925660	Luckily, you're getting out of here soon,
1925660	1927160	so 10 p.m. rolls around.
1927160	1929160	Your quests have been one major failure
1929160	1931660	and one minor resolution to a power squabble
1931660	1933660	that you're sure will heat up again tomorrow,
1933660	1935660	and you haven't eaten anything,
1935660	1937660	so you head to the train station.
1937660	1940660	When you get there, you find guards blocking the trains.
1940660	1942660	The Somatin brothers are nowhere to be seen.
1942660	1945160	They just didn't show up, and according to the guards,
1945160	1947160	no one can enter or leave the town now
1947160	1950160	because it's under quarantine thanks to the emergency powers
1950160	1952160	you helped Saburov get.
1952160	1955660	You just trapped yourself in the town.
1955660	1957160	If you try to talk your way out,
1957160	1958660	all the guards attack you,
1958660	1960160	and you lose reputation for killing them
1960160	1962160	because these guys were just doing their job.
1962160	1965660	Best of all, there's an executor standing there.
1965660	1967160	This one doesn't say anything
1967160	1970160	and seemingly can't be seen by the other characters.
1970160	1972160	He just stares at you, letting you know
1972160	1974660	he knows how dramatic the irony is,
1974660	1977660	laughing at you for thinking you can just leave the town.
1977660	1980660	So you're trapped, and you're starving.
1980660	1982660	In the middle of the night, you go to see a play
1982660	1984160	being rehearsed at the theater.
1984160	1986160	The play's about how you're fucked.
1986160	1988160	Bad news.
1988160	1990660	The governor will abuse his power.
1990660	1993660	When the morning hits, the game nonchalantly says,
1993660	1996160	it all ends in less than ten days.
1996160	1998160	Exhausted from a day's being a pawn
1998160	2001160	in someone else's power grab and scrambling for resources
2001160	2004160	for a quest that was doomed and starving half to death,
2004160	2006160	you eat one of the nuts.
2006160	2009160	♪♪
2009160	2011660	Great. You're completely fucked,
2011660	2013160	and you're on day three.
2013160	2016160	Day two is excellent game design.
2016160	2017660	It's deeply engaging.
2017660	2019660	Watching your attempts to get anything at all done
2019660	2021160	get frustrated,
2021160	2023160	and it also sets a general tone for the game.
2023160	2025160	It does the special game design trick
2025160	2027660	that I like to call recontextualizing.
2027660	2029660	Players come to games with their own expectations
2029660	2032160	and understandings of how a game is supposed to work
2032160	2033660	and feel and play,
2033660	2035660	a certain general set of ideas
2035660	2037660	about what all this is supposed to be like.
2037660	2039660	If you're playing an open world RPG,
2039660	2042160	you know what dialogue trees, shops,
2042160	2044160	and trading and hunger and time mechanics
2044160	2045660	and moral choices are,
2045660	2048160	and you think you know how they work.
2048160	2050160	Day one partially plays into this.
2050160	2052660	It takes pains to show how fragile you are
2052660	2054660	and all the work you have to do to not die,
2054660	2057160	but it's doable. It makes sense.
2057160	2060160	It doesn't feel that much different from a normal game.
2060160	2062160	When the prices rise so massively
2062160	2064160	that money is effectively worthless
2064160	2066160	and you were given no warning this would happen,
2066160	2069160	everything about how you relate to the game experience
2069160	2070660	is thrown out the window,
2070660	2072660	and you feel that happening in your brain
2072660	2075160	as you play and realize what just happened.
2075160	2077660	Walking around while slowly starving,
2077660	2079660	getting rid of the rest of your own items
2079660	2082160	to try to get the food for a doomed quest,
2082160	2084660	carrying food you can't eat around,
2084660	2087160	and wondering when you will get to eat,
2087160	2089660	and watching your meters inevitably rise
2089660	2091160	as you race to help the town
2091160	2093660	and only barely achieve anything,
2093660	2095660	you start to make realizations
2095660	2097660	about the scope of this experience.
2097660	2100160	You weren't playing a game with the mechanic
2100160	2102660	where you have the option of using money to buy things.
2102660	2106660	You were playing a game about having no money.
2106660	2108160	You weren't playing a game where you have
2108160	2109660	to eat food to survive.
2109660	2112660	You were playing a game about starving.
2112660	2114660	You weren't playing a game where you can choose
2114660	2116160	what sort of morals you have.
2116160	2118160	You were playing a game about how betraying
2118160	2120160	the people who trust you is better for you
2120160	2122660	than trying to be a hero, and doing the right thing
2122660	2124160	is an exercise in getting your time
2124160	2126160	and energy and money wasted.
2126160	2129660	Survival horror RPG? Lies.
2129660	2132660	You are playing a pain simulator.
2132660	2134660	This is a deeply masterful trick
2134660	2136660	I've seen very few developers pull,
2136660	2138660	where commonly understood mechanics
2138660	2141660	are twisted in such a fashion as to force the player
2141660	2144160	into a specific mindset and relationship
2144160	2145660	with those mechanics,
2145660	2148160	and everything straightforward suddenly becomes
2148160	2149660	different and off.
2149660	2151160	Once day two happens,
2151160	2153660	you no longer have any idea what's coming.
2153660	2156160	Money turning out to be virtually useless?
2156160	2158160	The growing threat of the plague?
2158160	2161160	Who knows how bad things will get in the next few days?
2161160	2163660	Even though the game doesn't get that much harder,
2163660	2165160	and technically the game isn't that hard
2165160	2166660	if you know what you're doing,
2166660	2169160	this sequence of experiences fills you with dread
2169160	2170660	for what might happen next,
2170660	2172660	and the game doesn't stay this difficult forever.
2172660	2175160	The point isn't how hard the game actually is
2175160	2177160	if you measure it objectively.
2177160	2180160	The point here is how the game makes you engage with it.
2180160	2183160	The game has a reputation of being depressingly punishing
2183160	2186160	and difficult, and while all this is true in places,
2186160	2188160	and it does get very hard in brief bursts,
2188160	2191160	the fact the game manages to create this reputation
2191160	2192660	without always being that hard
2192660	2195160	is a serious credit to its execution.
2195160	2197660	Day two grinds you beneath its heel,
2197660	2199160	and even if things pick up for you
2199160	2201160	or you master the art of stabbing bad men
2201160	2202660	for extra cash,
2202660	2205160	you'll never really feel in control again,
2205160	2207160	and that is genius design.
2207160	2209660	One of the ways you can make surviving slightly easier
2209660	2211660	is to sell your gun.
2211660	2213660	The gun you just got is worth a lot of money,
2213660	2215660	and so are bullets, which might be good
2215660	2217660	for solving some of the more pressing issues of the game.
2217660	2219160	You don't get in that many fights,
2219160	2220660	especially if you're avoiding them,
2220660	2222160	but being put in a position
2222160	2223660	where the best chance of survival
2223660	2225160	is getting rid of one of the main things
2225160	2227160	a first-person shooter is known for,
2227160	2229660	it's even in the name, that's a notable thing.
2229660	2232160	Almost everyone I know who made it this far
2232160	2233660	sold their first gun,
2233660	2236160	allowed themselves to remain vulnerable
2236160	2238660	for the chance to maybe not die of something else.
2238660	2241160	You can also learn to hold on to certain objects
2241160	2242660	to trade for better things.
2242660	2244660	In trash cans, you can find all kinds of stuff.
2244660	2246160	Sometimes people throw out jewelry
2246160	2247660	or needles or empty bottles,
2247660	2249660	which you can refill with water for free
2249660	2252160	and drink to reduce hunger and increase exhaustion
2252160	2254660	or save up to trade for bandages with the town drunks.
2254660	2256660	The children in the town will trade flowers
2256660	2259160	or nuts or blades for various useful things
2259160	2260660	like medicine and bullets,
2260660	2262660	so the nuts you got were useful.
2262660	2264660	You just might not have learned their value,
2264660	2267160	and this is another bigly clever thing the game does.
2267160	2269160	The economy isn't as simple as
2269160	2271660	I give you money and you give me my delicious egg.
2271660	2273660	It's a web of needs and wants
2273660	2275160	from a variety of NPCs
2275160	2278660	which informs the value of myriad different items
2278660	2281160	which you can benefit from if you pay attention and learn.
2281160	2283660	The game never hands any of this to you,
2283660	2285660	and that makes discovering and using these things
2285660	2288160	feel good, like you've worked it out
2288160	2289660	and solved something.
2289660	2292160	One type of child in the town, this little girl,
2292160	2294160	sometimes, very rarely,
2294160	2296660	has an item on her called Shmowda.
2296660	2299160	They're expensive to trade for, but they're worth it.
2299160	2301660	If you use it, it reduces your health to almost nothing,
2301660	2303660	but it cures the plague.
2303660	2305660	There's a very limited amount of real cures
2305660	2307160	available throughout the story,
2307160	2309660	so getting your hands on some of these is a real help.
2309660	2312660	Even if their downsides are too much for you to risk using,
2312660	2314660	other people will pay thousands and thousands
2314660	2317160	of rubles for them, almost $50 worth,
2317160	2318160	and hey, maybe some of your friends
2318160	2320160	might need curing later. Just saying.
2320160	2322160	This all works in the context of the story too.
2322160	2324160	The Bachelor is in a foreign town
2324160	2326160	whose customs aren't like the ones he's used to,
2326160	2328160	and so are you, and all this tension
2328160	2330160	and storytelling happens largely
2330160	2332660	while you're just walking from place to place in a town.
2332660	2334160	It's quite an experience,
2334160	2336660	and this experience is enhanced by the game's music,
2336660	2338660	which is some of the best in the business.
2338660	2340660	It takes a front seat during a lot of the walking,
2340660	2343160	and it does excellently with that spotlight.

2439660	2442660	By now, if you've been pausing to read the text for some reason,
2442660	2445660	you'll be very aware of how strange the writing is,
2445660	2447660	and whenever you begin dialogue with someone,
2447660	2449660	they actually say something out loud.
2449660	2453160	When we do not find peace of mind in ourselves,

2462160	2463660	I'm gonna use that in a future video
2463660	2465160	and pretend a philosopher said it.
2465160	2466160	Watch out for that.
2466160	2468660	Everyone's very wordy and flowery,
2468660	2470660	talking about their dreams and visions,
2470660	2473160	and sometimes it's hard to tell if you're discussing philosophy
2473160	2474660	instead of the task at hand.
2474660	2476660	The game has a very specific writing style,
2476660	2478660	one more evocative of your typical novel
2478660	2479660	than other games,
2479660	2481660	and it is, in my opinion, very well written.
2481660	2484660	It succeeds in making you feel transported to a world
2484660	2486660	where things aren't as simple as they seem,
2486660	2489660	where dream and metaphor are entangled with reality.
2489660	2491660	If a sentence feels strange or hard to follow,
2491660	2494660	it's doing that on purpose to make you feel weird,
2494660	2496660	like you have to put effort into understanding.
2496660	2498660	Instead of simply telling you you're a small part
2498660	2499660	of a strange universe,
2499660	2500660	it makes you feel that way
2500660	2502660	by refusing to pull its punches
2502660	2504160	with the ideas it's meditating on.
2504160	2505660	Try this on for size.
2505660	2508160	Do you believe in prophecies, Andres de Matin?
2508160	2508660	It depends.
2508660	2511160	I agree this may seem inconsistent with materialism.
2511160	2511660	On the other hand,
2511660	2514160	when your own experience convinces you to their effectiveness,
2514160	2515660	you have to take them into account.
2515660	2517160	I wonder that myself.
2517160	2518660	For a moment, I thought he was driven
2518660	2520160	by the same feeling that I am.
2520160	2522660	A great man, when unexpectedly betrayed
2522660	2523660	by the people he loves,
2523660	2525660	will often seek to fill the whole universe
2525660	2526660	with his blind spite.
2526660	2529160	Yes, the feeling is indeed familiar.
2529160	2531660	No one talks out loud like this in real life,
2531660	2532660	but that's not a mistake.
2532660	2533660	It's part of the point.
2533660	2536660	You're stuck in a world where people do talk like that
2536660	2538660	and have to untangle it to make sense of things.
2538660	2540660	It's very hard to call this game pretentious
2540660	2542660	because not only does pretentious mean
2542660	2545660	affecting a greater importance than is actually possessed,
2545660	2547660	and the game definitely does say important things,
2547660	2550660	but it's also too self-aware about how all this looks,
2550660	2552660	and it loves to make fun of itself.
2552660	2554160	The plays make fun of the characters
2554160	2555660	and plot and writing style.
2555660	2557660	The cool fourth-wall-breaking executors
2557660	2559660	complain about how unwieldy their outfits are.
2559660	2560660	It's lovely stuff.
2560660	2562660	While this video is definitely going to spoil
2562660	2563660	lots of the plot,
2563660	2565160	there's lots of really interesting aspects
2565160	2566660	I won't have time to go into detail about.
2566660	2568660	If you want a more complete breakdown
2568660	2570660	and analysis of the three characters' stories,
2570660	2572660	YouTuber Sulmatul made a great video doing so
2572660	2574160	linked in the description.
2574160	2576660	There's such a ridiculous amount of depth and complexity
2576660	2578160	that it still astounds me now,
2578160	2580660	and even trying to cover all of it is beyond my powers.
2580660	2582660	When I was talking about this with Mandalore Gaming,
2582660	2585160	whose video on Pathologic is also really worth checking out,
2585160	2587160	he offhand mentioned an entire aspect
2587160	2589660	of one of the characters I'd completely forgotten about
2589660	2591160	and isn't even in Sul's video either.
2591160	2593160	This game is about as dense with story
2593160	2595160	as a real novel with an equivalent amount
2595160	2596160	of words to read.
2596160	2597660	Obviously, really getting across
2597660	2599160	the cumulative feel of the writing style
2599160	2601160	is hard to do in video form,
2601160	2603160	and I was never really good at book reports anyway,
2603160	2605160	so instead I'll talk about some of the more specific
2605160	2607160	storytelling techniques that help the game achieve
2607160	2608160	what it's going for.
2608160	2611160	Firstly, the constant use of deception.
2611160	2613660	Other characters lie to you for all kinds of reasons
2613660	2615660	or have access to incomplete information
2615660	2617160	and then share it unreliably.
2617160	2619660	There's lots of manipulation and hearsay going on,
2619660	2621660	and it's left to you to figure out
2621660	2622660	what's actually happening.
2622660	2625160	Every character in this game has their own end.
2625160	2628160	Why does Maria Kane want to keep the Stamatins in town?
2628160	2630660	Why does the Inquisitor seem to always want
2630660	2632160	to investigate the Polyhedron
2632160	2633660	and find an excuse to destroy it?
2633660	2635660	Did Olgimsky lock up the termitary
2635660	2637660	to prevent the plague getting in
2637660	2639660	or has it already struck the place
2639660	2641660	and he was trying to prevent it spreading out?
2641660	2643160	Are his complaints that you should be looking
2643160	2644660	into the Kanes' business first
2644660	2646660	a genuine concern for their power plays,
2646660	2649160	or is he just trying to get you out of his hair
2649160	2650160	by pretending to be?
2650160	2652160	This goes the other way as well, of course.
2652160	2654160	Sometimes you can play dumb to learn more about someone
2654160	2655660	than they'd let on if they thought
2655660	2657160	you weren't on their side,
2657160	2659160	and sometimes you can lie for your own benefit,
2659160	2660660	like you can get a second pistol
2660660	2663160	if you tell Andrei you don't have one when he asks you.
2663160	2665160	Figuring out and catching someone in a lie
2665160	2667160	or successfully lying to someone else
2667160	2669660	feels great because you really are gaining ground
2669660	2671660	in a struggle for truth and control.
2671660	2674660	It's very engaging getting lied to by a story
2674660	2676660	and having to put the pieces together yourself.
2676660	2678660	Secondly, there's the way you experience
2678660	2680160	the same overall story
2680160	2682160	from three very different perspectives.
2682160	2683660	The Bachelor, for example,
2683660	2686160	is a clever and rational-minded man,
2686160	2688160	but he's so obsessed with pursuing
2688160	2690160	his specific lines of inquiry
2690160	2691660	that he spends a lot of time getting tricked
2691660	2694660	into doing busy work or ignoring the real story,
2694660	2697660	and when he is trying, he can be pretty bad at it.
2697660	2699660	He's an outsider, but rather than working
2699660	2702160	to gain people's trust and get on a decent footing,
2702160	2704660	the player's text options relate that the character
2704660	2706660	they're inhabiting can be a total asshole,
2706660	2709160	but could I please offer you a piece of advice?
2709160	2711160	I need no advice.
2711160	2712660	I mean, look at this choice.
2712660	2714660	This is something The Bachelor thought to say.
2714660	2717160	You're supposed to be asking this guy for help, Daniel.
2717160	2718660	What the fuck are you doing?
2718660	2720160	Several characters in the story have the power
2720160	2721660	to predict the future,
2721660	2723160	and The Bachelor has the power
2723160	2725660	to be a dismissive piece of shit to all of them.
2725660	2727160	The Bachelor says things that he must think
2727160	2728660	in his head sound really cool,
2728660	2731160	but to say to another person is, like, super weird.
2731160	2732660	You are broken, Lara.
2732660	2735660	I, on the other hand, am used to winning.
2735660	2737160	At numerous points in the game,
2737160	2739160	you can just randomly say a Latin phrase
2739160	2740160	to try and sound clever.
2740160	2742160	Medica morbo adhibe.
2742160	2744660	Asperty lies to The Bachelor about who's responsible
2744660	2746660	for the town's water supply being destroyed,
2746660	2748660	but the guy who actually did it just made a mistake.
2748660	2750660	She's buying time for him to get to safety
2750660	2752160	by sending you on a wild goose chase
2752160	2753660	because she rightfully believes The Bachelor
2753660	2756160	will try to fucking kill the guy if he gets the chance.
2756160	2757660	The Bachelor is such a piece of shit.
2757660	2759160	Look how he talks to this poor woman.
2759160	2761160	This is incredible characterization.
2761160	2762660	Like, you're just stuck in the body
2762660	2765160	of this pretentious buffoon. It's great.
2765160	2766660	In conversation with the Haruspex,
2766660	2769160	Asperty casually refers to The Bachelor
2769160	2772160	as the prickly prick that'll bury us all.
2772160	2774160	Bachelor's plot is largely a struggle to do
2774160	2776660	what seems obvious to him with his degree in medicine
2776660	2778160	but which conflict with the values
2778160	2779660	of the people of the town.
2779660	2781160	He wants to inspect Simon's body,
2781160	2783160	but the Kains have a family ritual
2783160	2785660	where bodies are left unobserved for 24 hours.
2785660	2788160	Then later he wants to dissect an infected body
2788160	2790160	to study the plague, but the local culture
2790160	2792660	forbids any kind of defilement of the body,
2792660	2794660	including surgery and autopsies.
2794660	2796660	It's a special right given only
2796660	2799660	to special families of medicine men, the Menkhu.
2799660	2801160	The Bachelor spends multiple days
2801160	2803160	literally and figuratively fighting
2803160	2804660	the people he's trying to save
2804660	2806160	to the point of getting arrested,
2806160	2807660	attempting to subvert their laws
2807660	2809160	so he can help sort things out.
2809160	2811660	By the end of this, Dankowski has a very low opinion
2811660	2813660	of the townspeople and their traditions
2813660	2815160	and decides he has to work within them
2815160	2817160	to get anything done and turns to someone
2817160	2819160	who can do the things he can't.
2819160	2820660	Over the course of his story,
2820660	2822660	Dankowski finds himself siding with the characters
2822660	2824660	who appeal the most to his belief system
2824660	2827660	about the world and against the more folksy wisdom
2827660	2830160	of the Haruspex and the supposed miracle working
2830160	2831160	of the Changeling.
2831160	2832660	All three characters play through
2832660	2836160	the same 12 days, and these stories aren't separate.
2836160	2837660	Whichever character you play,
2837660	2839660	the other characters are dropped in the world too
2839660	2841160	and follow their stories as well.
2841160	2843660	You even interact with them as part of your story.
2843660	2845660	You cross paths with the other characters quite a lot,
2845660	2847660	but you never really have an understanding
2847660	2849660	of what the other character's path is.
2849660	2852160	Early on, it sounds like the Haruspex is responsible
2852160	2854160	for the deaths of both Simon and Isidore,
2854160	2856160	though some people vouch for his innocence,
2856160	2859160	but then you find out that Isidore is his father.
2859160	2861160	Would he really just kill his dad like that?
2861160	2862660	But then it turns out the plague
2862660	2864160	might have killed those people,
2864160	2865660	as far as you know anyway,
2865660	2867160	but people seem to be saying he's going around
2867160	2868660	killing people now.
2868660	2870160	They're calling him the Ripper.
2870160	2873160	I'd wondered if maybe you play a serial killer in his plot.
2873160	2874660	When you talk to him, he seems reasonable
2874660	2876160	and like he's trying to make a cure
2876160	2878160	for the plague, a panacea,
2878160	2881660	but both you and Dankowski seem wary of his methods.
2881660	2885660	He's using a kind of medicine that seems kind of folksy
2885660	2888660	and a bit made up, so you kind of ignore it.
2888660	2890160	He's got his own shit to deal with,
2890160	2891660	something about a guy called Foreman Oyun
2891660	2893160	and what a big problem he poses.
2893160	2896160	Dankowski never even meets that guy, whoever he is,
2896160	2898160	but because he's a trusted member of this culture,
2898160	2900160	you need him to do some stuff for you.
2900160	2902160	For part of the main plot, you have to help
2902160	2904160	break him out of a prison to help you
2904160	2906160	because the governor doesn't believe he's innocent
2906160	2908160	of all the shit he's heard about him at this point.
2908160	2909660	Basically, when you're playing as the Bachelor,
2909660	2912160	the Haruspex seems a whole lot like a dangerous weirdo
2912160	2914160	whose help you happen to need,
2914160	2916160	but when you're playing as the Haruspex,
2916160	2918660	his side of the story actually starts to make sense,
2918660	2920160	and that kind of asymmetrical storytelling
2920160	2922660	isn't something you tend to get in video games.
2922660	2924160	In keeping with the unsettling
2924160	2926660	and anxiety-inducing design of the rest of the mechanics,
2926660	2929160	the game's dialogue system deliberately frustrates
2929160	2931660	your ability to fully understand the story too.
2931660	2933660	When you're talking to someone, you often have the chance
2933660	2936160	to ask questions or make observations,
2936160	2939160	but often in a chain of dialogue you can't come back to.
2939160	2941160	There aren't really dialogue trees here.
2941160	2943660	You ask one of several things, and that's your lot.
2943660	2946660	Sometimes dialogue choices exit out of the conversation
2946660	2948160	with no way to go back and progress it.
2948160	2950660	The only way to learn absolutely everything you can
2950660	2952660	is to load a lot of quick saves around dialogue
2952660	2954660	or try to only ask questions
2954660	2956660	you think you don't already know the answer to.
2956660	2959160	There is absolutely no way this wasn't intentional.
2959160	2962160	The game wants you to feel trapped in dialogue,
2962160	2964660	so you have to think carefully about what to ask
2964660	2967660	and if you can trust those answers to ever learn anything,
2967660	2969160	and you can't go back and ask the other
2969160	2971660	without the inconvenience of loading a save.
2971660	2974160	You have to figure out what thing your character should say
2974160	2976160	which won't end the talking if you want to learn more
2976160	2978660	about what's going on, so you learn to talk manipulatively
2978660	2980160	instead of truthfully.
2980160	2981660	Do you really need to tell someone
2981660	2984160	you think their idea is bad when you can play along
2984160	2985160	and learn more?
2985160	2987660	It makes even dialogue somewhat tense,
2987660	2989660	uncertain what option will end the talking.
2989660	2992160	Take into account it's possible to fail quests
2992160	2993660	by saying the wrong thing,
2993660	2996160	and you have a great system nestled precisely
2996160	2998660	in the fact it seems unforgiving and incomplete.
2998660	3002160	The system only feels bad if you're trained to expect
3002160	3004160	to be able to go back and learn everything you want,
3004160	3006660	but as we've just spent over 40 minutes covering,
3006660	3008660	the game's about not getting what you want
3008660	3010160	and hating people for it.
3010160	3012660	One thing that complicates discussions of the writing
3012660	3014160	is the fact that the game has had
3014160	3016160	two English translations now.
3016160	3018160	The first, which came out when the game was released overseas
3018160	3020660	in 2005, was notoriously so strange
3020660	3023160	that some sections of the game are borderline impossible
3023160	3025660	to understand without a guide or a philosophy degree,
3025660	3028160	and some sections were even taken out completely
3028160	3030660	for foreign releases because they just didn't make sense.
3030660	3033660	The HD remaster has a new, improved translation
3033660	3035660	and has the cut parts put back in.
3035660	3037160	It also has new voice recordings,
3037160	3041160	which is good because the last ones weren't great.
3041160	3045660	Your sensitive hands kill more often than present life.
3045660	3048160	You will inevitably cause harm,
3048160	3052160	and this smartass won't consider the losses at all.
3052160	3054160	You both lack mercy.
3054160	3055660	See, that's just not fitting at all.
3055660	3058660	The Changeling is an ambiguously magical little girl,
3058660	3062160	not an evil, elderly crone witch.
3062160	3065160	Simon, the land has cast out a monster
3065160	3068160	from the bowels to bridle his impudence.
3068160	3070660	Katharina. Oh, sorry, she's Katharina in this version.
3070660	3072660	Is one of those clairvoyants I mentioned earlier,
3072660	3075160	but she's also whacked out on morphine most of the time.
3075160	3077660	This voice really isn't appropriate for her.
3077660	3080160	I need morphine.
3080160	3081160	Yeah, that's better.
3081160	3083160	The new vocalists are much more fitting
3083160	3084660	and better directed, too.
3084660	3086660	They would have had to re-record the vocals anyway
3086660	3089160	because the translation they were going from was pretty bad.
3089160	3091160	For example, there's a cultural term
3091160	3093160	the Haruspex uses a lot to refer to the Bachelor,
3093160	3094660	uh, oinon.
3094660	3096160	Go, oinon.
3096160	3098660	I need time to pick up my tools.
3098660	3101160	Um, the original vocalizations,
3101160	3103160	well, they're left a little bit to be desired.
3103160	3104660	Go, onion.
3104660	3106660	I need to collect the tools.
3106660	3110160	This epidemic acts as if it has a mind of its own.
3110160	3113660	This disease behaves as though it has a mind of its own.
3113660	3116160	Yeah, see, maybe they forgot to delete a sentence there.
3116160	3116660	I don't know.
3116660	3119660	Traces of the supernatural are found more often
3119660	3122660	than most reasonable and wise people would like.
3122660	3124660	Mmm, not really feeling it.
3124660	3125660	Chimeras that had been...
3125660	3126660	Ha ha ha ha!
3126660	3128160	Chimeras worship...
3128160	3129660	Okay, that's a little better.
3129660	3132660	That sounds like it might even be a way of saying it.
3132660	3134660	It's Chimera, right?
3134660	3139160	Oh, God, I don't even know anymore how to pronounce...
3139160	3141660	Chimera. Please be Chimera.
3141660	3142660	Chimera.
3142660	3144160	What? WHAT?!
3144160	3145160	Screwed this one up.
3145160	3146160	Needs fixing.
3146160	3148160	That is not how you pronounce Chimera.
3148160	3150160	It sounds like someone machine-translated
3150160	3152160	the original Russian script into English
3152160	3154160	then went through doing right-click thesaurus
3154160	3155660	to make it sound smarter.
3155660	3157660	It's tough to pass and it really throws me off.
3157660	3159660	Every time a character's side of a conversation
3159660	3162660	turns out to be three lines of this kind of text,
3162660	3165160	my brain groans at me and I have to pause for a sec
3165160	3166660	to mentally prepare to read it.
3166660	3168660	The game's weird writing was like that
3168660	3169660	in the original game too.
3169660	3171660	Russians don't walk around talking like this.
3171660	3173160	This is just how it was written.
3173160	3175160	I originally thought this line in the old translation,
3175160	3176660	immortal dragon, was weird,
3176660	3178660	like they were trying to refer to Simon
3178660	3179660	as a mythological creature
3179660	3181660	but accidentally refer to him as a creature
3181660	3184160	that we have a lot of visual connotations for.
3184160	3186160	The new one says Leviathan,
3186160	3187160	which seems more appropriate.
3187160	3188660	If you call someone a Leviathan,
3188660	3190660	it sounds metaphorical and less literal,
3190660	3192660	but I checked and the original Russian version
3192660	3194160	calls him an immortal dragon too,
3194160	3196660	and dragon doesn't have any special metaphorical meaning
3196660	3198160	in Russian. It just means dragon.
3198160	3199660	It's just a weirdly written game
3199660	3201660	that the old translation makes even weirder
3201660	3203160	by taking it way too literally,
3203160	3205160	but there's an interesting intersection going on here.
3205160	3208160	You see, while the translation is improved,
3208160	3210660	at least in my opinion, the sense of strangeness
3210660	3212660	in the unforgiving and alien culture
3212660	3215160	of the strange town was completely intended.
3215660	3218660	Some people actually defend the older translation
3218660	3220160	for adding to this feel.
3220160	3221660	Like, some people will actually say
3221660	3224160	that the worst translation is better
3224160	3226660	at getting across the feel the game is going for.
3226660	3229160	Now, we're gonna get into some subjective territory here.
3229160	3231660	We're gonna have to peel away a few layers
3231660	3233660	of the onion of interpretation,
3233660	3236660	but while I can see that argument, I...
3236660	3239160	Phony! You're a fucking phony!
3239160	3241160	Okay, fine.
3241160	3242660	I have something embarrassing to admit
3242660	3244160	about my relationship with this game,
3244160	3246160	which really throws my pretentious hipster credentials
3246160	3247160	into question.
3247160	3249660	You telling him you're a phony yet?
3249660	3251160	Yeah, I'm doing it now.
3251160	3253160	Are you doing it?
3253160	3255160	Y-y-yeah, I'm doing it.
3255160	3256160	Are you doing it?
3256160	3257660	Get out of my fucking video!
3257660	3260160	You see, I have two failed prior attempts
3260160	3261660	to make it through this game.
3261660	3264160	In 2013, I found the Rock Paper Shotgun articles
3264160	3266160	by Quentin Smith, hallowed be his name,
3266160	3268160	and found them really convincing on the subject
3268160	3269660	of how games could be.
3269660	3271160	They really opened my eyes and changed
3271160	3272660	how I think about gaming,
3272660	3274660	so I decided to try the game for myself.
3274660	3277660	The original translation bounced me right off.
3277660	3279660	It was a little too much for me to want to sit down
3279660	3282160	and put time into when I bought it in 2013
3282160	3284160	and had a degree to pretend to work for
3284160	3285160	and Gundam to watch,
3285160	3286660	and I actually took a picture on my phone
3286660	3288660	of the funniest thing about this experience,
3288660	3290660	which was when the most understandable sentence
3290660	3293160	I'd read so far was a character apologizing
3293160	3295160	for if they don't make much sense.
3295160	3297160	I was like, yeah, thanks,
3297160	3298660	so I stopped.
3298660	3300660	Then a couple of years later, I tried again,
3300660	3302160	pushed past my initial problems,
3302160	3303660	hated being alone with my thoughts
3303660	3305160	when I was walking around the town
3305160	3306660	because most of my thoughts were about
3306660	3308160	how good Turn A Gundam was,
3308160	3309660	and basically did such a bad job
3309660	3311160	I was dying over and over on day two
3311160	3312660	and realized I'd have to go back
3312660	3314160	and gave up.
3314160	3316160	So I spent years agreeing with critics,
3316160	3317660	convinced of their arguments
3317660	3319160	that games could do more things
3319160	3321160	than be viscerally entertaining or mechanically fun,
3321160	3323660	despite failing to play the central game
3323660	3325160	many used in their example
3325160	3327160	of the value of negative experiences.
3327160	3329660	It was too negative for me, apparently.
3329660	3331660	Only now, with the HD edition
3331660	3333160	and the new translation,
3333160	3335160	did I finally stick with it long enough
3335160	3337160	to truly enter into the experience,
3337160	3339160	and I'm glad I finally got to do that,
3339160	3341660	and I think I really needed the better translation
3341660	3343160	to help bring me in.
3343160	3345660	That older version probably has its charms,
3345660	3348160	and I'm sure it must considering the game had defenders
3348160	3350660	for almost a decade before the fixed version came out,
3350660	3353160	but it was certainly too much for me.
3353160	3355160	However, even the new and improved version
3355160	3356660	of the game still has its problems.
3356660	3358160	We've already covered aspects of the game
3358160	3360160	that are just not gonna be for everyone.
3360160	3361660	The slow pace, the tone,
3361660	3363160	the feel of the gameplay and mechanics.
3363160	3365660	Now let's talk about the actual problems.
3365660	3371660	♪♪
3371660	3374160	Part four, the jank.
3374160	3376160	One thing that's absolutely necessary
3376160	3378160	to successfully progressing the story
3378160	3379660	is to read your mail.
3379660	3381660	You get letters from people over the course of the day,
3381660	3383160	and the only way to know you get them
3383160	3384660	is to know you get them,
3384660	3386660	and the only way to read them is to hit the L key
3386660	3389160	on your keyboard to open up the letters menu.
3389160	3391160	The game doesn't tell you this.
3391160	3394160	The game's tutorial, amazing in its own way as it is,
3394160	3396660	fails to tell you one of the most critical things
3396660	3398660	you need to know. If you don't read your mail,
3398660	3401160	you straight up will not know what to do on some days,
3401160	3403660	and as far as I can tell, nothing in the game tells you
3403660	3405660	unless you check your keyboard options.
3405660	3407160	This is a huge oversight.
3407160	3409160	The game does do interesting things
3409160	3410660	with not giving you proper information,
3410660	3412660	like it never tells you that food prices
3412660	3414660	are about to ruin your life, or it doesn't tell you
3414660	3416660	that some of your quests will end in disaster
3416660	3418160	and you maybe shouldn't have bothered
3418160	3419660	or run away with the money,
3419660	3421660	and if someone's not going to get to those moments
3421660	3422660	because they didn't understand
3422660	3424160	what they were supposed to be doing
3424160	3426160	or got annoyed they hadn't even been told
3426160	3427660	a core feature by the game,
3427660	3429160	it's a genuine flaw.
3429160	3430660	Speaking of the flaw...
3430660	3433160	Hear that thud?
3433160	3435160	When you have too many items in your inventory,
3435160	3437160	the item drops on the ground in a bag
3437160	3439160	and you have to drop something else to pick it up.
3439160	3441160	If this is a plot-important item,
3441160	3443660	not hearing that and looking down to swap something out
3443660	3445160	could cause a lot of problems.
3445160	3447160	Ha ha ha.
3447160	3449160	I think the game could have done a much better job
3449160	3451160	of letting you know when you don't have room for something.
3451160	3453660	This is a section from the changeling story later on.
3453660	3456160	I can't pick up this bag because my inventory is full,
3456160	3458160	but the game has no way of telling me,
3458160	3460160	so I'm just sitting here getting stabbed to death
3460160	3462160	and then I have to load a save and drop something
3462160	3463160	in order to pick this up.
3463160	3464660	This isn't as critical,
3464660	3466160	but it showcases the problem in a funny way.
3466160	3467660	If you sneak up on a rat
3467660	3469160	instead of letting them see you and chase you,
3469160	3471160	you can pick them up and actually use them
3471160	3472660	in rat races later on,
3472660	3474160	but if your inventory is full,
3474160	3476660	they just turn into a bag with a rat in it.
3476660	3478160	If you can't progress the story
3478160	3479660	because you dropped something
3479660	3481660	or you're too busy micromanaging what's in your inventory
3481660	3483660	in case you get given something important,
3483660	3485160	then you're being made to miss out
3485160	3486660	on what's good about the game
3486660	3488660	by a poorly implemented mechanic.
3488660	3490660	Pathologic is already not for everybody
3490660	3492660	and the mechanical stuff like this only detracts...
3492660	3493660	Oh, fuck!
3493660	3495160	The mechanical stuff like this
3495160	3497660	only detracts from what makes it truly unique.
3497660	3500160	There's a lot of jank in the game.
3500160	3502660	AI bugs out if you stand in the wrong place
3502660	3504660	during fights, spins in circles,
3504660	3506660	or stands still and waits to die.
3506660	3508660	You can get stuck in level geometry sometimes.
3508660	3510660	The physics like to explode.
3510660	3512660	The thing is, a lot of these sorts of problems
3512660	3514660	are a result of the game existing at all.
3514660	3517160	Like, you could spend a ton of man hours
3517160	3519660	making the AI work perfectly in fights
3519660	3521160	that aren't on completely flat ground,
3521160	3522660	or you can get the game out
3522660	3524160	before your team goes bust,
3524160	3526660	and in many ways, much like Eye Divine Cybermancy
3526660	3528660	or Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines,
3528660	3530160	AI bugs are a good thing.
3530160	3532660	They're a reminder of how much bloody work it took
3532660	3534160	to whip this thing into existence
3534160	3535660	with the available tools.
3535660	3537160	I still shudder when I think about
3537160	3538660	how to get the source engine to do things
3538660	3541160	I or Vampire did, and Pathologic's engine
3541160	3542660	seems like it was made out of whole cloth.
3542660	3544660	Do you have any idea how hard that is?
3544660	3546660	Video games are hard to program.
3546660	3549160	It takes years of work to make something good.
3549160	3552160	Games, as a rule, even the stable-looking ones,
3552160	3554660	are usually at their core hugely hacked together
3554660	3556160	to barely do whatever they do,
3556160	3559160	and even what seems like simple, slight changes
3559160	3561660	run the risk of absolutely obliterating
3561660	3563160	everything you hold dear,
3563160	3565160	so a lot of the game's weakest aspects
3565160	3567160	feel like a compromise for the inability
3567160	3568660	or instability of the engine.
3568660	3571160	In the story, for example, sometimes characters interact.
3571160	3573160	They talk or get one another to do things,
3573160	3574660	but while you're present,
3574660	3576160	characters are never doing anything.
3576160	3578660	They're just standing where they're supposed to be standing
3578660	3580660	and you go over and talk to them and you get the impression
3580660	3582160	they're in the middle of doing it
3582160	3583660	or taking a break or something.
3583660	3585660	Sometimes characters meet up to discuss something
3585660	3587660	or get attacked by soldiers and escape,
3587660	3589660	but it's always just happened when you walk in
3589660	3591660	and everything's already over whenever you're there.
3591660	3593160	It's not super immersion-breaking,
3593160	3594660	but a little more interaction
3594660	3596660	or being able to watch the characters do the things
3596660	3598660	you're told they did might have been nice.
3598660	3600660	Also, characters sharing a space together
3600660	3602160	don't seem to regard each other.
3602160	3603660	They either do their idle animation
3603660	3605660	and occasionally say lines like they normally do
3605660	3607660	just next to each other...
3607660	3609660	Yes? What is there to talk about now?
3609660	3611660	Are you sick or something?
3611660	3614160	How's my brother? Any news on him?
3614160	3616660	...or they're completely frozen in place.
3616660	3619160	You never even get to watch a conversation
3619160	3620660	between two characters.
3620660	3622160	Even when they're in the same room,
3622160	3623660	you talk to each of them separately.
3623660	3625160	Again, these aren't things I would really
3625160	3626660	criticize the game for.
3626660	3628660	These are reflective of the absolutely minuscule amount
3628660	3630660	of budget and time the developers had
3630660	3632160	and the limitations of their engine.
3632160	3633660	These are things that it would have been nice
3633660	3635660	to see working better but aren't a huge problem
3635660	3637160	when you're actually playing.
3637160	3638660	There's other technical problems too.
3638660	3640160	There's this weird bug where the screen's
3640160	3643160	entire color palette shifts when certain effects are playing
3643160	3645160	like fires or blood splatters during combat.
3645160	3646660	I'm sure there's a fix for this,
3646660	3648160	but I decided to just live with it.
3648160	3649660	It felt in the spirit of things to do that,
3649660	3650660	but it's still very distracting
3650660	3652160	and definitely not intentional.
3652160	3654160	All in all, all the little things like this
3654160	3655660	contribute to the overall feeling
3655660	3657660	that the creators had lofty ideas
3657660	3659660	for their story and world full of characters
3659660	3661660	to interact with and environments to explore
3661660	3663660	but were limited in what they could accomplish.
3663660	3665660	However, it's important not to confuse limitation
3665660	3667660	with artistic choice because some things
3667660	3669660	in the game are easy to dismiss as problems
3669660	3672160	but work in the context of the story that's being told
3672160	3674160	and the overall effect being attempted.
3674160	3675660	On that note, we haven't really talked
3675660	3677160	about the graphics yet.
3677160	3678660	Visually, even for the time, the game
3678660	3680160	was regarded as pretty ugly.
3680160	3682160	Everything is a weird angular facsimile
3682160	3683660	of what it's supposed to be.
3683660	3685160	The color palette is drab.
3685160	3687660	Infected and dying districts tint things
3687660	3690160	even uglier shades, and all the minor NPCs
3690160	3691660	look the same as each other.
3691660	3694160	However, I think that ugliness was deliberate
3694160	3696160	and actually serves a purpose.
3696160	3698660	Oh, no, it's the pretentious police!
3698660	3699660	They found me!
3700660	3702160	Oh, Jesus Christ!
3702160	3704660	The game is set in a dying rural town.
3704660	3707660	The sky is never clear, everyone's sick,
3707660	3709660	everything is depressing, and the filters
3709660	3711660	that turn up in infected areas make everything
3711660	3713160	even more sickly.
3713160	3715660	The fairly low texture detail and polygon count
3715660	3717660	do end up contributing to this look
3717660	3719160	and feel in their own way.
3719160	3720660	By being not much to look at,
3720660	3723160	the downer tone set by the story and mechanics
3723160	3725160	isn't thrown away by looking pretty.
3725160	3727660	The game's art design when it comes to characters
3727660	3730160	or the more interesting locations is imaginative enough
3730160	3732160	that even if it doesn't look visually great,
3732160	3733660	you can see what they're going for
3733660	3735660	and understand what it's supposed to be at least.
3735660	3737160	So, at least in my opinion,
3737160	3739160	the art style contributes to the feel.
3739160	3741160	I think it works that it looks like this
3741160	3743160	and not other ways, but I'm not sure
3743160	3745160	if I'm happy with saying that because if the game
3745160	3747660	had looked better, like if it was on par with Half-Life 2,
3747660	3749160	I don't think I'd have been saying,
3749160	3750660	this should have looked worse, would I?
3750660	3752660	It's one of those things where because it works
3752660	3754660	well enough for what it is, I don't feel a need
3754660	3756160	to complain that the graphics are bad
3756160	3757660	even though obviously they could be better.
3757660	3759160	People can decide for themselves
3759160	3761160	where the experience is improved or worsened
3761160	3763160	by things like bugs or inventory stuff
3763160	3765660	or the combat or graphics or translation
3765660	3767660	and ultimately the game is what you get out of it,
3767660	3770660	and for some people the line of what makes a game good
3770660	3772160	is very far away from anything
3772160	3774160	any version of this game is doing.
3774160	3776160	It's completely understandable why some people
3776160	3778660	don't engage with the game or want to and bounce off it.
3778660	3781160	I certainly did that the first two times
3781160	3782660	so I can respect that.
3782660	3784160	Like I said, it's not fun.
3784160	3786160	I can't really recommend you play it.
3786160	3788660	That's why I'm here sharing what I think is interesting
3788660	3790160	about the experience and not telling you
3790160	3791660	to play it for yourself.
3791660	3793660	I suffered so you didn't have to.
3793660	3796160	["Bloodborne"]
3796160	3798160	Once you get over the initial humps
3798160	3800160	and learn to deal with the difficult elements,
3800160	3803160	cope with the survival mechanics and get good at walking,
3803160	3805660	wow, what a phrase, get good at walking.
3805660	3807660	Learn to do a repetitive, unsatisfying thing
3807660	3809160	on your way to a goal.
3809160	3811160	Walking in Pathologic reminds me a little bit
3811160	3813160	of doing exercise or cleaning my kitchen.
3813160	3816160	It's not fun, but it's important to learn how to do it
3816160	3818660	or the empty cans of kidney beans that still have some juice
3818660	3820660	and a bean or two in them you left on the side
3820660	3822660	to figure out which bin to throw them out in
3822660	3824160	start to smell after getting left there
3824160	3825160	for a week and a half.
3825160	3826160	That's not a real story.
3826160	3828160	Once you figure out what the game is demanding of you,
3828160	3830160	it doesn't stay as difficult as it seems.
3830160	3833160	I think people tend to overstate the game's unpleasantness
3833160	3834160	when it's not a constant.
3834160	3836160	It's just an early spike as it teaches you
3836160	3838160	what the experience is going to be like.
3838160	3839660	Once you get into the swing of things,
3839660	3842160	The Bachelor is a cake walk but without the cake.
3842160	3844160	I mean, you aren't exactly given no help.
3844160	3846660	Almost everyone important trusts The Bachelor,
3846660	3848660	and he starts out with some useful items,
3848660	3850660	a weapon, decent money, some medicine,
3850660	3852660	and he can make a whole lot more during the game
3852660	3854660	doing quests for the rich people who trust him.
3854660	3856660	It is possible to get on top of the game's economy
3856660	3858660	and survival mechanics as The Bachelor.
3858660	3860660	It gets hard at times and even harder
3860660	3862660	if you insist on doing the good guy things in quests
3862660	3864160	like not running away with all the money
3864160	3865660	or food you bought for that one quest
3865660	3868160	or giving away literally all the money you have
3868160	3871160	saving six random people from getting wrongly executed,
3871160	3872660	which I didn't do.
3872660	3874660	I loaded my save after this cutscene played
3874660	3877160	and kept the money, and I'm a bad person for it,
3877160	3879660	but even if you do all the good guy things,
3879660	3881660	if you know what you're doing and take the opportunities
3881660	3883660	that are given to you, you can make it through alive
3883660	3885660	even while being a good person.
3885660	3887660	The Bachelor's story is technically quite hard
3887660	3889160	but ultimately forgiving.
3889160	3893160	It's a pretty balanced experience all in all.
3893160	3895160	Anyway, the Haruspex's story begins with you
3895160	3896660	bleeding to death.
3896660	3899160	Upon arriving at his hometown via the train station
3899160	3901160	after ten years away studying surgery,
3901160	3902660	the Haruspex, Artemy Burakh,
3902660	3904660	has been stabbed repeatedly in a fight
3904660	3907160	with multiple people who believed him to be a murderer
3907160	3909160	trying to escape via the station.
3909160	3911660	Artemy's just got here and he's already bleeding out
3911660	3914160	while wanted for his own father's murder,
3914160	3915660	and this isn't just a cutscene that happens
3915660	3917660	before the game starts. Oh, no.
3917660	3919660	You begin the game at the train station
3919660	3921660	surrounded by corpses with your health low,
3921660	3923160	your reputation even lower,
3923160	3924660	and your hunger and exhaustion meters
3924660	3926160	already half full.
3926160	3928160	Now if you were wondering why the Haruspex
3928160	3930160	did what he did in his playthrough,
3930160	3932160	here's the first of many reasons why.
3932160	3934160	It turns out that for Artemy,
3934160	3937160	everything was fucked all the time.
3937160	3939660	Yeah, sure, the Bachelor playthrough was pretty hard.
3939660	3941660	You maybe even figured out how to play it
3941660	3943160	and not die too much.
3943160	3945160	I bet you thought you were good at this game.
3945160	3947160	That's where you're wrong.
3947160	3949660	Daniil Dankovsky's fun step vacation
3949660	3951160	was just the tutorial
3951160	3954160	for Artemy Burakh's tormentous nightmare.
3954660	3960660	♪♪
3960660	3963160	Some people refer to playing the Haruspex as hard mode,
3963160	3964660	and I must admit, at the beginning,
3964660	3967160	it is a little bit like getting stabbed in the dick,
3967160	3969160	but after that it gets much worse.
3969160	3971160	Remember that horrifying moral quandary
3971160	3973160	as Dankovsky where you could risk
3973160	3975160	six innocent people getting executed
3975160	3977160	if you choose not to get involved in something
3977160	3978660	that isn't your business anyway?
3978660	3980660	The Haruspex has a moral quandary
3980660	3982660	a million billion times harder,
3982660	3984660	and it's his first quest.
3984660	3986660	After getting chased into the warehouse territory
3986660	3988660	by an angry mob, you go inside
3988660	3990160	and meet a gang of children.
3990160	3992160	This gang was there in the Bachelor's playthrough,
3992160	3994160	but you only really visited them, like, once.
3994160	3996160	They weren't really very interested in talking to you,
3996160	3997660	and the Bachelor was too busy sucking up
3997660	4000160	to the important people to care about a bunch of children.
4000160	4001660	When you talk to Notkin, their leader,
4001660	4003660	he says they have a rebel who stole something
4003660	4005660	from them to defect to a rival gang.
4005660	4008160	He says if you do him the favor of killing them for him,
4008160	4009660	he'll give you a gun and some ammo.
4009660	4011660	Now, I don't want to tip your hand as to whether
4011660	4013660	a gun might be a useful item to have in this playthrough,
4013660	4015160	but as soon as I left the building,
4015160	4016660	a man tried to beat me to death.
4016660	4018660	Remember that reputation mechanic?
4018660	4020160	It turns out that when it's low enough,
4020160	4022660	in addition to shopkeepers not trading with you,
4022660	4025660	all regular NPCs will attack you in the street.
4025660	4028160	Oh, and because these people are just law-abiding citizens
4028160	4029660	attacking a wanted criminal,
4029660	4031660	killing them in self-defense is a crime,
4031660	4034160	and your reputation will drop even further.
4034160	4035660	Ah.
4035660	4037660	Mmm.
4037660	4039160	So either you run away to preserve
4039160	4040660	what reputation you have left
4040660	4042160	and try to do good things to correct it
4042160	4044160	or fight back and make everything worse.
4044160	4045660	Good luck, fucker!
4045660	4049160	Have those guys seen me?
4049160	4050660	Yep, they've seen me.
4050660	4052160	I feel very seen right now.
4052160	4053660	Since fighting is more of a fact
4053660	4056160	of the Haruspex's short life, yeah,
4056160	4058160	having a gun would really help with that.
4058160	4060660	So you go out into the steppe and...
4060660	4062660	Oh. Oh, fuck off.
4062660	4065160	Of course. This was a gang of children.
4065160	4067660	Of course the rebel member is a kid.
4067660	4069660	So you can tell him off and send him on his way
4069660	4071660	for a minuscule reputation boost,
4071660	4073660	and if you kill him, it drops a bunch
4073660	4076660	because, you know, you've killed a child,
4076660	4079160	but your reputation already can't get much worse,
4079160	4081660	and Notkin's offer of a gun is a pretty big deal,
4081660	4083660	and this kid has a schmowder on him.
4083660	4085660	It's one of the critical items.
4085660	4087660	It's basically the one thing in the game
4087660	4090160	you can't pass up an opportunity to get.
4090160	4093160	Plus he's in a gang, so he knew the risks.
4093160	4096160	So you can get a gun super early on in Artemy's playthrough
4096160	4098660	but at a significant moral cost.
4098660	4100660	Obviously the kid is just polygons,
4100660	4102660	but if you take the roleplaying seriously
4102660	4105160	or even just stop for a moment and ask yourself
4105160	4108660	if you would do this in real life if it meant survival,
4108660	4110660	there's a lot of feelings to unpack here.
4110660	4112660	I mean, let's recap.
4112660	4115660	In many modern RPGs, child murder is still a thing
4115660	4117660	that won't even go on the table.
4117660	4119660	Get on the fucking table, MacReady!
4119660	4122660	Oh, I'll be back for you in Fallout 4, fucker,
4122660	4124660	when you're old enough to die!
4124660	4127660	In Pathologic, one of the most taboo things
4127660	4131660	there is in gaming is one character's first quest
4131660	4134160	and there's significant personal justification
4134160	4135660	for going through with it.
4135660	4138160	You are dying and you need the stuff
4138160	4139660	you get for it desperately.
4139660	4142160	You just have to find a way to live with the fact
4142160	4144660	that you are now wanted for a murder you definitely
4144660	4147160	did commit along with the one murder you didn't.
4147160	4149160	Now it's not all bad for the Haruspex.
4149160	4151660	Okay, it is, but he gets one thing.
4151660	4154160	As a Menkhu, he can also dissect corpses,
4154160	4156160	a thing the Bachelor had to get you out of prison
4156160	4157160	to do for him.
4157160	4159160	Every corpse you come across carries a heart,
4159160	4161160	a liver, one kidney,
4161160	4162160	I don't know, just go with it,
4162160	4163160	and some blood.
4163160	4166160	These grisly items form a new kind of currency.
4166160	4168660	Various characters in the game will trade you
4168660	4170160	really useful stuff for these,
4170160	4172660	opening up an entirely new black market economy.
4172660	4175160	Characters who wouldn't even talk to the Bachelor
4175160	4177160	are now an extra tool for survival
4177160	4178160	if you know where to look.
4178160	4180160	Give me the herbs, worm.
4180160	4183160	Artemy's father's secret lab has tools to make medicines
4183160	4186160	that can raise immunity and lower infection super easily
4186160	4188160	making him infinitely more survivable
4188160	4190160	when it comes to the plague than Dankovsky
4190160	4192160	if you put effort into perfecting the recipes.
4192160	4194160	They work like the medicine you've used before
4194160	4196660	but much stronger and with much less downsides
4196660	4197660	if you get them right.
4197660	4199660	I really like the asymmetrical storytelling
4199660	4201660	that's happening with this aspect of the gameplay.
4201660	4204160	Not only is it just an extra layer of fun stuff
4204160	4206160	to learn and master to survive in the town
4206160	4207660	and it feels good getting it right,
4207660	4209160	but you're also seeing the sides of the world
4209160	4212160	that Dankovsky's beliefs just denied him access to.
4212160	4214160	He thought that this medicine was made up
4214160	4215660	and here it is keeping you alive
4215660	4217160	even if you get infected as Artemy
4217160	4219160	and actually it's really hard not to as him.
4219160	4220160	It's much less of a problem
4220160	4222160	because of all these herbal remedies you've got
4222160	4224160	but that's about it, so you're fucked,
4224160	4226160	but once the plague becomes a problem,
4226160	4228660	you can live long enough to be killed by something else
4228660	4230660	like this great bit where as soon as you leave a building
4230660	4232160	it spawns two muggers outside
4232160	4233660	and they both throw knives at you
4233660	4235160	which kills you instantly.
4235160	4236660	At the very least, if you have to defend yourself
4236660	4238660	and lower your rep, you get to keep whatever
4238660	4242160	was in their pockets and their meat pockets
4242160	4243160	and with the new economy,
4243160	4245160	maybe not being accepted by society
4245160	4246660	isn't as much of a death sentence.
4246660	4248660	I really do feel like Burak doesn't enjoy
4248660	4250160	unnecessary violence.
4250160	4251160	He's an educated man.
4251160	4253160	He seems quite noble in a way.
4253160	4254660	He wouldn't do it if he didn't have to.
4254660	4256160	It's unbecoming of his station.
4256160	4258160	Wait, does that guy have a shotgun?
4258160	4259660	Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!
4259660	4261160	Getting a shotgun. One second.
4261160	4262660	Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
4262660	4265660	Getting a shotgun on day one feels a little broken
4265660	4267660	after how late I got one as the Bachelor,
4267660	4269160	but what makes it extra engaging
4269160	4271160	is the knowledge that I'll probably need it.
4271160	4272660	Selling weapons as the Harrisbacks
4272660	4274660	is even more nail-biting than before.
4274660	4277160	Just because of the way his campaign is set up,
4277160	4280160	you will need everything you could buy with that money
4280160	4282160	even more desperately than before,
4282160	4284160	but you also kinda need the g-
4284160	4286160	Wha-come on! What the fuck?!
4286160	4287660	There's five guys?!
4287660	4290160	So it's about now that I realized why Artemy ended up
4290160	4292160	with his reputation as the Ripper.
4292160	4293160	He was in a desperate place,
4293160	4295660	so he was forced to make difficult decisions,
4295660	4297160	and the few options available to him
4297160	4298660	involve getting his hands dirty.
4298660	4300660	The story makes a lot of sense now.
4300660	4302160	He wasn't a serial killer.
4302160	4304160	He was a guy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time
4304160	4305660	and has to fight to survive
4305660	4307660	and solve his own father's murder
4307660	4309160	and maybe help the town,
4309160	4311660	and one of his skills happens to be surgical ability.
4311660	4313660	Luckily, there are some chances to redeem yourself.
4313660	4315660	You hear one of your attackers from the opening
4315660	4317660	got away and is bleeding out in the graveyard.
4317660	4319160	This guy needs a blood transfusion,
4319160	4321660	and if I save his life, maybe he'll help clear my name.
4321660	4324160	So you traipse all the way across the entire town
4324160	4326160	to get to the hunchback who will draw some of your blood
4326160	4327660	for you if you have enough health to spare.
4327660	4329160	Pick it up.
4329160	4330660	Don't forget to pick it up this time
4330660	4332660	or you'll have to come all the way back again!
4332660	4335160	And then take a long stroll all the way back.
4335160	4337160	Did I say stroll? I meant to say...
4337160	4338660	Seven guys are chasing me.
4338660	4340660	Oh, God, stop it! Leave me alone!
4340660	4343160	I'm a good person. It's just a misunderstanding.
4343160	4344660	Oh, thank God, a sewing needle.
4344660	4346160	Hey, kid, take it. Thanks for the medicine.
4346160	4348160	I'll be needing that. Anyway, back to being chased.
4348160	4351160	The walking in the easy mode, the bachelor's playthrough,
4351160	4353160	was pretty tense at the best of times,
4353160	4355160	but now it's an active fight for survival.
4355160	4356660	Leave me alone, please!
4356660	4358660	Just let me do a good thing!
4358660	4361160	Why don't you try walking a mile in my shoes?
4361160	4362660	You know what? Don't put your feet
4362660	4364160	anywhere near my shoes.
4364160	4366160	You can all put both of your feet
4366160	4368160	in the grave.
4368160	4369660	Look, don't criticize my one-liner, okay?
4369660	4371160	I'm under a lot of stress.

4399160	4400160	-♪♪
4400160	4401160	Yay!
4401160	4403660	Now I'm well on my way to clearing my name,
4403660	4406160	and I'm only mostly poor and exhausted
4406160	4408160	and hungry and dead.
4408160	4409660	Fuck!
4409660	4411660	So remember the perspective thing I talked about?
4411660	4414160	The Haruspex, as a former local of this culture,
4414160	4416160	is trusted by the people who hate the bachelor
4416160	4418160	and spends a lot more time in places
4418160	4419660	the bachelor only got to go once
4419660	4421660	and then got the shit kicked out of him for going to.
4421660	4424160	Oh, yes, fucking get him, mate. Yeah!
4424160	4427160	So you see a completely different side of the story
4427160	4428660	and of the town since you spend time
4428660	4430160	being public enemy number one.
4430160	4432160	The reputation mechanics basically didn't come up
4432160	4434660	in the bachelor's run unless you killed people for no reason,
4434660	4436160	but now you have to face the problems
4436160	4439160	having a low one poses and build it back up to survive.
4439160	4442160	It's hyper-engaging, not just because it's hard
4442160	4444160	but because you remember how it was before.
4444160	4447160	It's the same conjuring trick as day two's food shortage.
4447160	4450160	Everything is different and scary all over again.
4450160	4452160	I love it. It's hard. It's punishing.
4452160	4455160	Arguably, it's incredibly unfair, but I love it.
4455160	4456660	You learn more about aspects of the plot
4456660	4458660	the town jester had no idea about.
4458660	4460660	For example, you are the reason the Stamatins
4460660	4462160	never turned up on day two
4462160	4464660	when cowardly little Dankowski tried to flee the town.
4464660	4466160	Maria found out about the plan
4466160	4468160	and got you to convince them to stay
4468160	4470160	by telling them you'd invented some cool new alcohol.
4470160	4472160	The Stamatins are really into the local drink,
4473160	4476160	an absinthe-like spirit with possibly magical properties,
4476160	4477660	and your medicines actually are derived
4477660	4479660	from the same ingredients which you can trade
4479660	4481160	with Andre for great stuff,
4481160	4483160	and then just to keep you on your toes,
4483160	4484660	once you get your reputation sorted,
4484660	4486660	a few days later it all happens again.
4486660	4489160	You get captured by Saburov's men and thrown in jail
4489160	4490660	just like you did in Daniel's story,
4490660	4492160	and here's where another aspect
4492160	4494160	of the multi-character structure becomes clear
4494160	4495660	by actively fucking you.
4495660	4497160	When you aren't in control of a character,
4497160	4499160	they make worse decisions than you did.
4499160	4501660	When you talk to him, he talks like the worst
4501660	4503660	of the options you could have chosen.
4503660	4505160	He's naturally more of a dick.
4505160	4507160	He even says random Latin phrases at you.
4507160	4508160	It's great.
4508160	4509660	I love this prickly little prick.
4509660	4511160	He's just so well-characterized,
4511160	4513160	and I love how much the game hammers home
4513160	4515660	what an idiot he is in this version of the story.
4515660	4518160	The big city guest jumps the gun too much.
4518160	4520660	Not the mystery-solving type, really.
4520660	4524160	But he doesn't know our traditions.
4524160	4526660	He's bound to be deceived.
4526660	4528660	Even the plays that you can go see
4528660	4530660	call Dankowski a piece of shit.
4530660	4533160	All in all, we can fight.
4533160	4536160	You self-serving jerk.
4536160	4540160	Dankowski believes the disease came from the wells.
4540160	4541660	He's wrong.
4541660	4543160	["Taps"]
4543160	4544660	But more importantly,
4544660	4546160	he never stages a prison break.
4546160	4548160	You have to break yourself out.
4548160	4550160	Then, later in the game,
4550160	4552160	he fucks up a quest you did easily
4552160	4553660	when you were playing as him,
4553660	4556160	and then you have to break him out of prison.
4556160	4557660	Nice going, Dankowski!
4557660	4559160	Okay, okay, fine.
4559160	4561160	Don't panic. I'll bargain for your release.
4561160	4563160	30 clips of rifle ammo?
4563160	4565160	Listen, there's a plague going on.
4565160	4566660	We're kind of on the clock here,
4566660	4569660	and I'm not giving bullets to a gang of violent kids.
4569660	4571660	Someone could get hurt.
4571660	4574160	["Taps"]
4574160	4576660	["Crying"]
4576660	4578160	["Taps"]
4578160	4581160	I did it. I saved the Bachelor.
4581160	4585160	["Taps"]
4585160	4588160	The Haruspex's main quests are to develop a panacea,
4588160	4590160	an actual cure for the plague,
4590160	4592160	to figure out who killed his father, obviously,
4592160	4595160	and to assume his father's duties in the Kin,
4595160	4596660	the people of the steppe.
4596660	4598660	To do this, he gets to go into the abattoir
4598660	4600160	and talk a lot with Foreman Oyun,
4600160	4601660	the guy who's currently in charge
4601660	4603660	and the Bachelor barely heard anything about
4603660	4605160	and who is also bad at his job
4605160	4608160	and everyone hates and wants you to replace him.
4608160	4610160	He starts giving you trials
4610160	4612660	to prove your worth.
4612660	4615160	Two of these trials are he gives you a poison
4615160	4617660	and you have to do something for him before you die of it.
4617660	4619160	I'm not gonna say the trials
4619160	4621160	are just tricks to try and kill you,
4621160	4623160	but I don't know. Hmm.
4623160	4627660	The final trial is to jump into a big hole and die.
4627660	4630660	Uh, I'm not really sure about this one, Chief.
4630660	4632660	He says it's a spiritual experience
4632660	4635660	and your father did this too to take his place in the Kin,
4635660	4638660	but no one else says anything about any trials.
4638660	4642160	By the way, uh, if you jump in the hole, you die.
4642160	4643660	There is a spiritual aspect
4643660	4645160	to Artemy's life in the town, though.
4645160	4647160	When you're walking around out in the steppe,
4647160	4650160	you can hear a cool distant chanting now.
4650160	4653160	["chanting"]
4653160	4659160	["chanting"]
4659160	4661160	A character later tells you the voice you're hearing
4661160	4663160	is your father's voice. That's really cool.
4663160	4665160	You feel more in touch with the land in his story
4665160	4666660	and you kind of are.
4666660	4669160	Artemy's medicines are made from plants that grow in the town
4669160	4670660	and he can actually pick them up
4670660	4672160	when he sees them around the place.
4672160	4675160	The wide open empty space you felt was kind of meaningless
4675160	4677160	as the Bachelor is suddenly rife with items
4677160	4678160	that can help you.
4678160	4680160	You start to literally see the town differently
4680160	4682660	as the Haruspex and that's just incredibly cool.
4682660	4684660	All the least fun bits of the first playthrough
4684660	4686160	are ramped up to 11.
4686160	4689160	The walking is even more excruciating and circular.
4689160	4691160	The survival mechanics are harder on account
4691160	4693660	of having no money and low reputation a lot of the time
4693660	4695160	and not having as many rich friends.
4695160	4698160	Many of the quests are deliberate in-story attempts
4698160	4701660	to waste your time and get you killed by Foreman Oyun,
4701660	4703160	but you're invested now.
4703160	4704660	The suffering is engaging
4704660	4706660	and you want to know what happens,
4706660	4708160	how it all shakes out for him.
4708160	4710160	You take the hours of walking in stride.
4710160	4711160	Ha ha.
4711160	4713160	You see all the efforts you go to as proof
4713160	4715160	that you're willing to go through hell and high water
4715160	4716160	to save this town.
4716160	4717160	If you didn't like this game,
4717160	4718660	you wouldn't get to this point anyway,
4718660	4720660	but if you somehow did, it's excruciating.
4720660	4721660	It's awful.
4721660	4723660	You're having a shit time being bored,
4723660	4725160	but if you care about the story,
4725160	4727160	if you've got immersed in the atmosphere
4727160	4729660	and are engaged fully with the survival mechanics
4729660	4732160	and your understanding of how much harder things are now,
4732160	4735160	this is the best fucking time I've had in a game in years.
4735160	4737160	It's still not fun.
4737160	4738660	It's something else.
4738660	4740660	This other thing I can't even describe.
4740660	4744160	It's satisfying in a way I'm not used to games being.
4744160	4747160	In a way, the game is asking you a serious question
4747160	4750160	about whether you're willing to be punished to succeed.
4750160	4752660	If you give up and close the game and stop playing it,
4752660	4754660	you're basically letting the town die
4754660	4756160	without your help, aren't you?
4756160	4759160	Oyun is trying to make you give up and stop playing,
4759160	4761160	and I'm not gonna let him.
4761160	4763660	I'm gonna solve this shit, and I'm gonna cure the town.
4763660	4765660	Just remember to pick up the quest items
4765660	4767160	that drop at your feet or you have to come
4767160	4768660	all the fucking way back again.
4768660	4770160	You also learn how badly you'd accidentally
4770160	4771660	messed a lot of things up as the Bachelor
4771660	4773160	without even knowing it.
4773160	4775160	Late in the game when you've learned a lot of the mystery
4775160	4777660	and figured out at last how to make a cure for the plague,
4777660	4780160	but only in extremely limited quantities
4780160	4782160	whose source ingredient is almost impossible to get,
4782160	4784660	there's one side quest where a giant bull
4784660	4787160	mysteriously appears stuck to a giant steak.
4787160	4790660	The giant bull's blood can be used as a source of the cure.
4790660	4792660	You get some from the bull and make arrangements
4792660	4794660	to get it pulled off the steak and rescued properly
4794660	4796660	the next day, which might even give you enough
4796660	4798660	to save the whole town.
4798660	4800660	Then you remember that when you were the Bachelor,
4800660	4803160	there was a side quest featuring a staked bull
4803160	4806660	surrounded by people which was a clear health hazard.
4806660	4809160	What if people congregating like that spreads the plague?
4809160	4810660	Or what if they're planning a riot?
4810660	4813160	So you nonchalantly ordered the bull to be burned
4813160	4814660	and thought nothing of it.

4823160	4825660	Dankowski, you prickly prick!
4825660	4827160	You've buried us all!
4827160	4829660	So make the most of the blood you got the day before
4829660	4831160	because that's all you're getting.
4831160	4834660	In any case, the Haruspex run is a spectacular playthrough.
4834660	4836160	It's excellently designed.
4836160	4839160	It forces you to relate to mechanics you felt like you knew
4839160	4841160	but in even more knuckle-tightening ways,
4841160	4843660	and every time you get one over on the world or Oyun
4843660	4846160	and survive to the next day having learned more,
4846160	4847660	it feels like a genuine victory.
4847660	4849660	Having an in-depth understanding of the layout
4849660	4851660	and purpose of each part of the town
4851660	4854160	and then getting to be a fugitive from the lore in it
4854160	4855660	is so cool.
4855660	4857160	You get to see your previous character
4857160	4859160	how other people saw him instead of how you probably felt
4859160	4860660	while playing as him.
4860660	4862660	You learn more about the mysteries of the town
4862660	4864160	from a second perspective,
4864160	4866160	and you finally have something of an idea
4866160	4867660	of how everything slots together.
4867660	4870160	All the problems the game has are even more glaring
4870160	4872660	after another 20 hours of playing a story in it,
4872660	4875160	but I had an even better time as the Haruspex overall,
4875160	4877660	and I'm glad I sat through the grim,
4877660	4880160	bloody nightmare of the story to the end.
4880160	4883160	The bitterest end.
4883160	4885660	Destruction is inevitable.
4885660	4888160	There's no miraculous way out.
4888160	4891160	There was nothing to hope for from the start.
4891160	4892660	I can't really talk about Pathologic
4892660	4894660	without showing you how it all shakes out.
4894660	4896160	It's too cool not to talk about.
4896160	4898660	By the final days, the town is a war zone.
4898660	4900660	An Inquisitor and later the army have shown up
4900660	4902160	to try to get things under control,
4902160	4903660	but the commander hates the Inquisitor
4903660	4905160	and they won't work with each other.
4905160	4907160	He loses control of a bunch of his troops.
4907160	4909160	Half of them die of the plague themselves,
4909160	4911160	and all they've really added to the proceedings
4911160	4913660	is now the army's shooting the diseased in the street,
4913660	4915660	so I really hope that you have medicine
4915660	4917660	because if you get too infected,
4917660	4919160	God, this last section is hard.
4919160	4920660	Actually, here's a weird thing.
4920660	4922160	If you get hit by the flamethrower,
4922160	4923660	it does a ton of damage,
4923660	4925160	but it also reduces your infection level.
4925160	4926660	I think it's meant to be a metaphor
4926660	4928160	for burning out your infection.
4928160	4930160	Usually this kills you, but due to a bug,
4930160	4931660	if you somehow survive the fire
4931660	4933160	because you got out of dodge super quick
4933160	4934660	and had a lot of health,
4934660	4936160	if it reduces your infection past zero,
4936160	4937660	it cures you of the disease.
4937660	4940160	Hey, thanks for that, you little fucker.
4940160	4943160	The disease itself is chasing you down
4943160	4945160	in an evolved, even faster form
4945160	4947160	that looks like angels made of blood.
4947160	4948660	It's a nightmare.
4948660	4950660	The army's brought a giant cannon
4950660	4953160	and has orders to shell the entire area to the ground
4953160	4955660	to prevent the plague from spreading if it comes to that,
4955660	4957660	and it is coming to that.
4957660	4959660	However, after a lot of false starts
4959660	4961160	and internal politicking
4961160	4962660	and generally getting messed around,
4962660	4965160	your characters manage to find a solution to the plague.
4965160	4968660	The trouble is each character finds their own solution.
4968660	4970660	The Bachelor has helped develop a vaccine
4970660	4973160	which can protect the healthy from getting infected
4973160	4974660	and falls in with the Kains,
4974660	4976160	the utopian academics and elites

4978160	4980160	the impossible structure next to their house
4980160	4982660	that has kept most of the town's children safe inside
4982660	4985160	and may now house Simon's soul.
4985160	4987160	It's a marvelous, miraculous thing
4987160	4989160	that heralds a new and beautiful future.
4989160	4992160	He also comes to think the town is a lost cause.
4992160	4994160	He's sick of the babblings of its people
4994160	4996160	whose customs have prevented him from helping them.
4996160	4997660	Over the course of the game,
4997660	4999660	the Bachelor's map of the town evolves
4999660	5001160	as he learns new things
5001160	5003660	and gets more and more disillusioned with his quest.
5003660	5006660	To the Bachelor, the town is an ugly and disgusting thing,
5006660	5008660	crammed on a hill where it shouldn't
5008660	5011160	with its blood and darkness seeping into the soil,
5011160	5014160	and eventually the beautiful, mathematical Polyhedron
5014160	5015660	joins it, a wonderful thing,
5015660	5017660	skewering through the dark earth
5017660	5019160	and its corrupted blood,
5019160	5021160	bigger and more important than anything else.
5021160	5023160	He believes at this point the plague is caused
5023160	5026160	by the backwater people's unsanitary practices
5026160	5028660	causing animal blood to congeal in the earth
5028660	5030160	for thousands of years.
5030160	5032660	The Bachelor wants the commander to shell the town,
5032660	5034660	destroying it and the plague
5034660	5036660	and freeing the Polyhedron of its corruption,
5036660	5038660	leaving the survivors to build a new town
5038660	5040160	on the other side of the river
5040160	5042160	governed by the visionary Kains.
5042160	5043660	If the Bachelor gets his way,
5043660	5045660	he really did bury them all.

5050660	5053160	The Haruspex, however, is a local of the town
5053160	5055660	and has gotten more involved in the internal struggles,
5055660	5058160	assumed his rightful place as the leader of the Kin,
5058160	5060160	and finally gained access to the source of blood
5060160	5063660	he can use to make a panacea and cure the infected,
5063660	5065660	a step closer to defeating the disease
5065660	5067160	than the Bachelor's vaccine.
5067160	5068660	He manages this after a, let's say,
5068660	5071660	mildly tedious final boss fight with the Foreman.
5071660	5074660	Yeah, the Haruspex run has a final boss fight in it?
5074660	5076660	Punch him 30 times and he does a quarter
5076660	5078160	of your health each hit.
5078160	5079660	You finally get your revenge on the man who,
5079660	5081660	it turns out, killed your father.
5081660	5083660	His map screen evolves as he learns too,
5083660	5085660	portraying the town as built on the back
5085660	5088160	of a giant bull with the veins of the world
5088160	5090660	portraying the town as a gigantic organism.
5090660	5093660	Then the Polyhedron appears, tearing through the veins,
5093660	5095160	injuring the earth itself.
5095160	5097660	Blood pools at the base of the tower,
5097660	5099660	myopic dreams of utopia
5099660	5102160	scraping a nightmarish wound into the earth.
5102160	5105160	To the Haruspex, the Polyhedron caused the plague
5105160	5108660	and it should be destroyed so the town can heal.

5115660	5117660	I like these two divergent climaxes.
5117660	5120160	Both characters have such different perspectives
5120160	5122160	and experiences that you can see how they came
5122160	5124160	to the conclusions they did, and it highlights
5124160	5125660	their differing philosophies about the world
5125660	5126660	and how to live in it.
5126660	5129160	Dankofsky wants to transcend the flesh
5129160	5130660	to defeat death itself,
5130660	5133160	to build wonderful and impossible things.
5133160	5135660	He doesn't really care about average people.
5135660	5137660	He feels like he's too important for them.
5137660	5139160	He doesn't even like them, really.
5139160	5141660	His ultimate medicine prevents infection,
5141660	5143660	shields you from the plague,
5143660	5146660	but doesn't actually stop it killing the people it gets to.
5146660	5149660	An ounce of prevention might be worth a pound of cure,
5149660	5152160	but what about all the people who need curing?
5152160	5154660	They get written off, not just by his version of medicine,
5154660	5157660	but the town itself has to die for him to be certain
5157660	5159160	the plague is dead with it.
5159160	5160660	He'd rather destroy something
5160660	5162160	than risk it spreading the disease,
5162160	5164160	a mistake that actually helped doom
5164160	5166160	the creation of more actual cures.
5166160	5168160	Every choice he made was understandable,
5168160	5170660	and yet it was never enough to actually save
5170660	5172160	most of the people of the town.
5172160	5174160	Artemy is a polar opposite.
5174160	5176160	He's more concerned with curing the sick
5176160	5177660	than protecting the healthy.
5177660	5180160	He gets down in the dirt, the bowels of the earth,
5180160	5182160	and makes tough sacrifices,
5182160	5184160	even killing innocent people,
5184160	5185660	but he does it compassionately
5185660	5187660	to try to end the suffering for real,
5187660	5190160	and protecting the townspeople means protecting them
5190160	5193160	from the high-minded idealism that led to the negligence
5193160	5195660	that failed to prevent the plague early on
5195660	5197160	and invented the structure
5197160	5199160	that caused it all in the first place.
5199160	5200660	A lot of this stuff is very ambiguous.
5200660	5202160	There's a lot of ways of looking at it,
5202160	5203660	but at least in my interpretation,
5203660	5206160	the game seems very concerned with the tensions
5206160	5208660	between the utopian dream of a better world
5208660	5211160	and the actual people who have to build it
5211160	5213660	and live through the follies that come with these projects.
5213660	5216660	It's hard not to notice this Russian game's parallels
5216660	5218160	with the history of the Soviet Union.
5218160	5220660	As for the changeling, ah, I can't be bothered.
5220660	5222660	I mean, come on, do I really need to do
5222660	5225160	a third 20-hour playthrough and then explain all of that?
5225160	5227160	I'm sure nothing that interesting happens in it.
5227160	5229160	These endings don't just happen on their own, however.
5229160	5231660	Left to its own devices, at the end of the 12th day,
5231660	5234160	the army destroys everything and the bad ending happens.
5234160	5236660	In order for your character to successfully get their ending,
5236660	5238660	none of their bound can be sick.
5238660	5240660	They have to prove that they're a good doctor,
5240660	5243160	which means doing the main quest on time every day,
5243160	5246160	and if you didn't, you have to cure the ones that got sick.
5246160	5248660	You can do this by using the panaceas or schmowders
5248660	5250160	you found over the course of the run,
5250160	5251660	so if you didn't use them yourself
5251660	5253660	or sell them for tons of cash,
5253660	5256160	they're a kind of get-out-of-bad-ending-free card
5256160	5257660	per person who got ill.
5257660	5259660	If you prove you've done your duty as a doctor,
5259660	5262160	you're let into the cathedral to argue your case,
5262160	5264660	and when the day ends, you get your character's ending.
5264660	5267160	Yay! The end.
5267160	5270160	♪♪
5270160	5272660	But on the same day, you also get letters
5272660	5274660	from the other two characters.
5274660	5276160	They both still have their own ideas
5276160	5278160	for what needs to be done about the plague,
5278160	5279660	but because you weren't in control of them,
5279660	5281160	they kept messing up.
5281160	5282660	Their plot lines weren't quite as successful
5282660	5284160	as they could have been,
5284160	5286160	and a bunch of their bound caught the plague.
5286160	5288160	They plead with you to help cure them
5288160	5289660	so they can argue their case too,
5289660	5291160	and if you cure all of them,
5291160	5292660	you can invite them to the cathedral
5292660	5295160	and actually pick their ending instead of yours.
5295160	5297660	You can tell the commander to go with someone else's idea
5297660	5299160	if you get them a seat at the table.
5299160	5300660	Then you get their ending instead,
5300660	5302160	and in the classic HD edition,
5302160	5303660	you get an achievement for it.
5303660	5305660	That's nice. You get that ending instead.
5305660	5306660	Cool.
5306660	5309160	♪♪
5309160	5311160	But if you do manage to invite someone else,
5311160	5312660	something else happens too.
5312660	5314660	You get a letter from the powers that be
5314660	5316660	inviting you to the Polyhedron.
5316660	5318660	You only go there, like, twice as the Bachelor
5318660	5321160	and once as the Haruspex, and you never go very far in.
5321160	5323660	Only those with young, unsullied, creative minds
5323660	5326160	can see it for more than a series of small rooms.
5326160	5328660	This time, you can descend to the very bottom
5328660	5330660	to meet the gods of the world.
5330660	5332660	Major spoilers from here on out, folks.

5346660	5349660	That model looks a whole lot like the town
5349660	5351660	with the Polyhedron sticking out, doesn't it?
5351660	5354660	Oh, fuck! It is the town!
5354660	5357660	You're in a garden, and two giant children are there
5357660	5359660	surprised that their doll has come to life.
5359660	5361660	The town, everyone in it,
5361660	5363660	and the plague are just an imaginary story
5363660	5365660	told by two kids in a sandbox.
5365660	5366660	They tell you you're a toy,
5366660	5368660	and you can complain about your fate
5368660	5370660	and how unfair being not real is at them,
5370660	5371660	but it's all futile.
5371660	5373660	You can't change anything.
5373660	5374660	They're kids playing God,

5376660	5379660	a doll who briefly got to question his masters
5379660	5380660	before returning to the game.
5380660	5383660	So, uh, this ending is pretty divisive,
5383660	5384660	to say the least.
5384660	5386660	It really annoyed some people.
5386660	5387660	There's plenty of posts out there
5387660	5389660	about how much it messes with them.
5389660	5391660	This happens 20 to 30 hours in
5391660	5393660	to a story you've been super engrossed in,
5393660	5395660	and if you do really good at the story,
5395660	5398660	the secret extra revelation is that none of it was real.
5398660	5399660	It was all in vain.
5399660	5400660	In fact, as Dankovsky,
5400660	5402660	your mission statement finally changes here
5402660	5404660	to tell you it was all in vain.
5404660	5407660	After a whole game of staring at Dankovsky's quest
5407660	5408660	to defeat death,
5408660	5410660	it finally changes to acknowledge
5410660	5412660	all his quests were always pointless.
5412660	5414660	He was never even real.
5414660	5416660	I mean, this is equivalent to a movie
5416660	5417660	all turning out to be a dream.
5417660	5419660	It's a bit of a kick in the teeth, honestly.
5419660	5421660	In a way, it's the ultimate depressing move
5421660	5424660	to have worked this hard and suffered so much
5424660	5426660	and then to be told you were just a toy.
5426660	5428660	It's so much, so mean,
5428660	5430660	and yet it's exactly what Pathologic
5430660	5432660	has been doing the whole time.
5432660	5433660	Even right at the end,
5433660	5436660	they still managed to hurt you
5436660	5438660	one last time.

5441660	5443660	There's an even more secret ending.
5443660	5445660	There's an even twistier fucking twist.
5445660	5448660	If you saved both other characters bound,
5448660	5450660	which as either character is hard as hell
5450660	5452660	since it requires all the panaceas you can possibly get
5452660	5455660	in their quests and the couple schmowders you can get,
5455660	5458660	which, let me remind you, requires child murder
5458660	5460660	plus maybe a few extras from trading with this kid
5460660	5463660	who barely turns up and rarely has a schmowder
5463660	5464660	to trade for anyway.
5464660	5466660	She wants, like, seven flowers for it too.
5466660	5469660	I got one from her in 20 hours playing the Bachelor,
5469660	5471660	and no, this isn't even the clip of me finding it.
5471660	5472660	I can't remember where it is
5472660	5474660	because there's, like, 23 hours of footage.

5480660	5483660	from the people who executed the whole thing
5483660	5485660	inviting you to the theater.

5492660	5493660	of the impossible quiz and it turned out
5493660	5494660	you had to have kept all the skips?
5494660	5496660	That's how getting here and realizing
5496660	5498660	I needed to have never used any of these things was.
5498660	5500660	I'm glad I didn't, but wow,
5500660	5502660	they give you cures to the status effect
5502660	5504660	that threatens you the most in the whole game,
5504660	5506660	and the only way to truly win is to never use any
5506660	5508660	and save them up for the end,
5508660	5510660	and they don't even tell you you were supposed to do this.
5510660	5513660	It's genius because it's so fucking mean.
5513660	5515660	I mean, it's just...
5515660	5517660	Ah.
5517660	5518660	Pathologic, man.
5518660	5520660	This close to the end
5520660	5522660	with the town ghostly and empty
5522660	5524660	awaiting the time of my final decision,

5542660	5544660	the walk to the theater

5565660	5567660	Well, they are, but they're more than that.
5567660	5569660	These are the developers of the game.
5569660	5571160	Holy shit!
5571160	5574160	The final secret is a chat with the developers.
5574160	5575660	The first thing they do is point out
5575660	5577160	the children aren't real either,
5577160	5578660	and I mean they're right too.
5578660	5580160	None of this is real.
5580160	5581660	Why would you be annoyed by the
5581660	5584160	it's all a game played by children twist ending?
5584160	5585660	It is all a game.
5585660	5587660	You always knew that.
5587660	5589660	You're literally playing a game.
5589660	5591660	The whole point is that games feel real
5591660	5593160	even though they aren't.
5593160	5595160	That's what suspension of disbelief is.
5595160	5597160	You never really believe a game is real,
5597160	5599660	but you briefly pretend you don't not believe
5599660	5601160	to engage with it,
5601160	5603160	and the game gave you a shitty twist
5603160	5605660	just to make you wonder why that twist hurts
5605660	5608160	when it's just telling you something you already knew.
5608160	5610160	God, what a cool double twist.
5610160	5611660	I love this so much.
5611660	5613660	You even get to pick whether to talk
5613660	5615660	as the character or as yourself.
5615660	5617160	God, this is cool.
5617160	5619160	In reality, all games are a conversation
5619160	5621160	between you and the developers.
5621160	5624160	All Pathologic does is rip down the curtain at the end
5624160	5626160	and show you that's what it was
5626160	5627660	and tell you that's okay.
5627660	5629660	It's fun to spend time in a world
5629660	5631160	someone else made for you.
5631160	5633660	It never had to be real to be real.
5633660	5636660	Oh, God, forgive me if my speech is unclear or absurd.
5636660	5638160	I'm still reeling from this.
5638160	5640660	Even writing the script after playing the game
5640660	5642660	and even saying it now,
5642660	5644660	I'm just, ah, I love this.
5644660	5646160	I can't even communicate it,
5646160	5647660	and that's what I've been trying to do
5648660	5650160	It's so good.
5650160	5652160	Anyway, time to go pick my ending.
5652160	5653660	You can say a final goodbye
5653660	5655660	to a bunch of the main characters on the last day
5655660	5657160	and talk about what might happen next.
5657160	5659160	Each of your bound has a thing to say to you.
5659160	5661160	As the Haruspex, if you got to meet the creators,
5661160	5663660	you can taunt the Inquisitor as the player
5663660	5665660	with the knowledge that she's all pretend,
5665660	5667160	and as the Bachelor, hey, changeling,
5667160	5668660	you've been weird and talking about
5668660	5671160	how transcendent and special you are this whole time,
5671160	5673160	but did you know this is all just a game
5673160	5674660	played by children?
5674660	5676160	Wait, what?
5676160	5677660	She knows?
5677660	5679160	She knows?
5679160	5680660	How long has she known?
5680660	5683160	What the fuck was happening in the changeling story?
5684160	5687160	So, it's all about trickery to you?
5687160	5688660	No.
5688660	5690160	No.
5690160	5692160	I detest trickery,
5692160	5695660	but if we ourselves are to suffer deception,
5695660	5697660	our hands are no longer tied.
5702160	5704660	Clara begins by waking up in a shallow grave.
5704660	5706660	The executors tell you you're going to be mistaken
5706660	5709660	for a murderer and a thief, but also a miracle worker,
5709660	5712160	and your reputation is always going to drop.
5712160	5715160	Clara is immediately adopted by Katerina Saburov,
5715160	5717660	the semi-magical lady and wife of the governor.
5717660	5720160	She sees her appearance as a sign of divine providence
5720160	5722160	who will do great things for the town
5722160	5724160	and believes you have magical healing powers.
5724160	5726160	You also hear that someone with your description
5726160	5727660	is thought of as a thief in the town,
5727660	5729160	and someone matching your appearance
5729160	5731160	was said to have killed Simon or Isidore.
5731160	5733660	Clara replies, yes, she is a good person,
5733660	5735160	and the bad things she'd heard
5735160	5737660	must have been her identical twin sister.
5737660	5741160	Huh. Is that an in-character fact about us?
5741160	5743160	Or did our character just tell a lie?
5743160	5745160	Well, it's both.
5745160	5746660	How is that possible?
5746660	5747660	Fuck you!
5747660	5749160	The Saburovs task Clara
5749160	5750660	with proving she has healing powers.
5750660	5752660	You hear there's been some violence out in the steppe.
5752660	5755660	Some guys tried to stop a murderer escaping the town
5755660	5756660	and got fucked up.
5756660	5758160	That sounds weirdly familiar.
5758160	5759660	And while you're there, you probably get into a fight
5759660	5761660	with the looters, and here's where you find out
5761660	5763660	that Clara's combat is hilariously terrible.
5763660	5765160	I mean that literally.
5765160	5767660	I was cackling when I discovered how shit this is.
5767660	5769660	Clara doesn't have a fist-fighting animation.
5769660	5771160	Instead, she kind of waves her hands around
5771160	5772660	all magic-like.
5772660	5775160	It's a very slow attack, and it does even less damage
5775160	5776660	than the previous character's attacks.
5776660	5778160	Oh, and she has tiny hands,
5778160	5780160	so she can't use any weapons or guns
5780160	5782160	except for one shitty gun that sucks.
5782160	5784160	So good luck in fights, says Clara.
5784160	5788160	45 hours and two earth-shattering revelations in,
5788160	5791160	and the game's still finding ways to destroy me.
5791160	5792660	This is the devs saying,
5792660	5794660	okay, we know you've probably figured out
5794660	5796660	how to fight in this game now,
5796660	5798660	so what if it was even harder?
5798660	5800660	From any kind of typical design standpoint,
5800660	5803160	this combat is horrendous, but it works
5803160	5805160	because at this point, you know the developers
5805160	5806660	are just messing with you for fun.
5806660	5808660	It's like when a close friend is rude to you
5808660	5810660	but in a cute way you both think is funny.
5810660	5812160	That's the kind of friendship you have
5812160	5813660	with the developers now.
5813660	5815160	I mean, to even get here,
5815160	5816660	you might have even met them already.
5816660	5818660	You then find the injured man you're supposed to save,
5818660	5820160	and you find out it's not a man.
5820160	5822160	It's, hey, remember this guy?
5822160	5823160	In this version of the story,
5823160	5825160	the Haruspex tried to kill the kid,
5825160	5827160	and the kid was injured but got away
5827160	5829160	because, you know, he's not as good at stuff
5829160	5830660	when you're not in control, that sort of thing.
5830660	5832660	From the kid's perspective and Clara's,
5832660	5834660	he's a monster who tried to kill a kid,
5834660	5837160	but from being the Haruspex, you know what was on the line.
5837160	5838160	It's cool storytelling.
5838160	5840660	You see Artemy's side, but you also have to recognize
5840660	5842660	that he's far from an innocent man here.
5842660	5844160	Luckily, he doesn't have as much blood
5844160	5845660	on his hands this time, it seems,
5845660	5847660	especially since we're going to help the boy.
5847660	5849660	Anyway, you lay on your hands to heal the kid
5849660	5851660	and complete the quest for, oh, he's dead.
5851660	5854160	So Clara's powers, if she has them at all,
5854160	5856160	don't seem to quite work how you expect,
5856160	5858160	at least not for healing traditional wounds.
5858160	5860160	The man who was supposed to serve as a witness
5860160	5862660	to your healing hands, far from assuming you're a charlatan
5862660	5864160	or a demon or a murderer,
5864160	5866160	actually still believes you're a hero though.
5866160	5868660	He decides the kid had been judged by your power
5868660	5871160	as a sinner and then killed instead of healed.
5871160	5874160	He thinks your power is the divine working through you
5874160	5875660	in mysterious ways.
5875660	5878660	Consider yourself purified.
5878660	5880660	You still have to prove you can heal people,
5880660	5883660	but he's basically sold on you as a divine being.
5883660	5886660	I'm not sure how to feel about this version of the story.
5886660	5889660	In a really good way, Haruspex made a very tough choice
5889660	5891660	and had to live with it, but I think it might actually
5891660	5893660	be even more bleak to have a story
5893660	5896660	where a character tries to heal the child of their wounds,
5896660	5898660	accidentally kills them, and is heralded
5898660	5900660	as a miraculous hero anyway.
5900660	5902660	I love this stuff. It's horrible.
5902660	5904160	It makes my skin crawl.
5904160	5906160	With the harder fighting and the constantly
5906160	5908660	lowering reputation you have to actively keep up
5908660	5911160	by doing good things, the game is pathologic
5911160	5913160	at its most pathologicist.
5913160	5915160	You have to do good things all the time.
5915160	5917160	Give money away, give up on your medicine,
5917160	5919660	kill baddies with your awful attacks, and so on.
5919660	5921660	Bachelor has a hard spike on day two,
5921660	5924160	and Haruspex has two hard spikes at the beginning
5924160	5926160	and partway through when he gets captured,
5926160	5928160	but Clara is constantly swimming
5928160	5930160	against a current of negative press.
5930160	5932160	Someone who looks exactly like her
5932160	5934160	has done a lot of bad things.
5934160	5936160	You have a new set of Bound, of course,
5936160	5937660	all the remaining main characters
5937660	5939660	who weren't in the first two's care.
5939660	5941660	As always, your job is to protect them
5941660	5943160	from getting infected or dying.
5943160	5945160	Wait, the Foreman of the Abattoir?
5945160	5946660	Oh, that's not gonna end well.
5946660	5949160	Clara's story has a lot of little extra things in it
5949160	5951160	to learn about character relationships and choices.
5951160	5953160	Lots of them are too small to go into depth about,
5953160	5955160	but at times it was like a victory lap,
5955160	5958160	the writers creating an extra post-playthrough story
5958160	5960160	for a character with a magical ability
5960160	5962660	that justifies them learning all kinds of new things.
5962660	5965160	It's another way of exploring the richness of the story.
5965160	5967160	You're still interacting with and causing the story
5967160	5968660	to play out the way it does,
5968660	5970160	but you have the strongest idea
5970160	5971660	of why it all worked out now
5971660	5973160	with two stories worth of hindsight.
5973160	5974660	When you talk to the Foreman
5974660	5976160	who gave the Haruspex so much trouble
5976160	5978160	and help him verify Artemy is a legitimate heir
5978160	5980660	to his position, this conversation causes him
5980660	5982660	to devise the trials he tormented you with
5982660	5984660	when you were playing the other story.
5984660	5987160	He comes up with them on purpose to get rid of Artemy.
5987160	5989660	Thanks, Clara, which is how it felt like as the Haruspex,
5989660	5991660	but getting that confirmation is really something.
5991660	5993660	On top of that, the thing where the other player characters
5993660	5996160	are worse at their jobs is cranked all the way up.
5996160	5997660	After the first few days,
5997660	5999160	the Bachelor and Haruspex's relationship
5999160	6000660	breaks down so bad,
6000660	6002660	they're actively trying to hunt each other down
6002660	6004160	for much of the story.
6004160	6005660	You get letters from their allies asking you
6005660	6007660	to find them and warn them the other is coming for them,
6007660	6009660	and you can even rat their locations out to each other
6009660	6011160	for money and medicine.
6011160	6012660	It's fun seeing how the worst possible
6012660	6014160	of their timelines plays out
6014160	6015660	when you aren't stopping either of them
6015660	6017160	from being jerks.
6017160	6018660	That said, it's clear that Clara
6018660	6020660	is the most rushed of the stories.
6020660	6023160	You can tell mainly because a lot of the side quests
6023160	6025160	are the same side quest each day.
6025160	6026660	For the second half of the game,
6026660	6028160	you have three side quests every day,
6028160	6029660	and they're always the same.
6029660	6031160	Two of them are to warn the Bachelor and Haruspex
6031160	6033160	about each other, and the third, well,
6033160	6034660	Clara starts getting letters
6034660	6036660	or possibly dream messages,
6036660	6039160	but it's in the letters menu, from her twin sister,
6039160	6041160	the evil Clara who is hiding out
6041160	6042660	somewhere new in the town each day.
6042660	6044660	If you don't find her based on cryptic messages
6044660	6047160	and get her to leave, which takes a lot of sleuthing
6047160	6048660	and running around infected houses,
6048660	6050160	the district she was hiding in
6050160	6052660	will be permanently infected for the rest of the game.
6052660	6055160	It's creepy talking to your own character too.
6055160	6056660	Whenever you find her in a house,
6056660	6058160	she's always facing away from you,
6058160	6059660	and it's super weird.
6059660	6061160	Dodging the plague in houses
6061160	6064160	to find a weird copy of yourself is great stuff.
6064160	6066160	You then also have to scare away her followers
6066160	6067660	who are hiding out in very hidden places
6067660	6069660	you won't think to look, and if you don't,
6069660	6071160	that area gets infected too.
6071160	6072660	So after the halfway point,
6072660	6075160	every day these are your three side quests.
6075160	6077160	They're always the same with the slight variation
6077160	6079160	being the house that the Bachelor and Haruspex
6079160	6081160	reach hiding in is a different place each day.
6081160	6083160	You only get given vague ideas of where they are
6083160	6084660	and you have to look around yourself,
6084660	6086660	and Clara's letters are actually quite cool puzzles,
6086660	6089160	I guess, to figure out where exactly she is in the town
6089160	6090660	based on your intuition and knowledge of the town
6090660	6092160	from two full playthroughs.
6092160	6094660	It's quite interesting, but having all three side quests
6094660	6096160	be the same one each day
6096160	6098660	with no real advancement of the plot really gets to me.
6098660	6101660	The other characters had serious cool subplot stuff,
6101660	6103660	but Clara just gets busy work.
6103660	6105660	I started to skip these quests after a few days.
6106160	6107660	There's also very little communication
6107660	6110160	that you can heal infected people as Clara.
6110160	6111660	Oh, did I mention that?
6111660	6113160	I didn't mention it earlier on purpose
6113160	6114660	because the game sure didn't.
6114660	6116160	When you use your hands on the infected,
6116160	6117660	it plays a different animation
6117660	6120160	and you get reputation back and they do a little bow.
6120160	6121660	It costs some health too, I guess.
6121660	6124160	So it's another thing you can do to keep your reputation up
6124160	6125660	and it's also a cool trade-off
6125660	6127160	because you lose health for doing it as well
6127160	6128660	and there's a risk of getting infected
6128660	6130160	while you're in those districts doing this,
6130160	6131660	but I don't remember being tutorialized
6131660	6133660	or told by the game you can do this.
6133660	6136160	I only know about this from other videos mentioning it.
6136160	6138660	I know Pathologic is a game that prides itself
6138660	6141160	on not conveying stuff and letting you figure things out,
6141160	6144160	but from a design perspective, this feels like a misstep.
6144160	6146160	I feel like if they'd had more time or resources,
6146160	6147660	they'd have made this much clearer.
6147660	6149160	I mean, they seem to give the implication
6149160	6151160	Clara's attack is an attack.
6151160	6152660	You use it to kill people
6152660	6154660	and it kills the first person you try to heal
6154660	6156660	and the first person you actually heal
6156660	6158160	happens in a cut scene.
6158160	6160660	They do the opposite of letting you know you can do this
6160660	6162660	and this only works on these characters too,
6162660	6164660	not the people who appear to be in the early stages
6164660	6166660	of infection. They just drop dead.
6166660	6168660	Like I said earlier, for the HD edition,
6168660	6170660	all the character audio was re-recorded,
6170660	6173160	but in Clara's scenario, specifically for Katarina
6173160	6175660	on around day three, for some reason,
6175660	6178160	one of the old voice actor's lines is still in there.
6178160	6180660	Nothing threatens your daughter.
6180660	6183660	Everyone will die but you will remain.
6183660	6186160	I feel like this sort of oversight probably happened
6186160	6188160	because development of Clara was rushed
6188160	6190160	even for the HD version
6190160	6192660	and an old line slipped through and didn't get caught,
6192660	6195160	which makes sense. A very small amount of players
6195160	6196660	ever get to the point this could happen,
6196660	6198160	and I'm glad they spent the time elsewhere
6198160	6200160	instead of triple checking all the voice lines
6200160	6202160	for every character for every character's story,
6202160	6203660	but it's at least a good indicator
6203660	6205160	of how generally rushed
6205160	6206660	some of the changeling's stuff is.
6206660	6209160	It's a minor thing but it points to the major thing
6209160	6211160	or at the very least I noticed it and I want to pretend
6211160	6212660	that I can make a point out of it.
6212660	6214660	Overall, if you were interested in Pathologic's story,
6214660	6216660	Clara's route is really satisfying.
6216660	6218660	If you're not, it's just more text
6218660	6221660	and combat even more frustrating than before
6221660	6224160	and yet more walking, but it's much more rewarding
6224160	6226160	in forthcoming with information than the others.
6226160	6227660	You put the work in.
6227660	6229660	You played 20 to 40 hours of story.
6229660	6232160	Now lots of the missing pieces you were curious about
6232160	6233160	can get filled in.
6233160	6235160	The story isn't pulling its punches either.
6235160	6237160	They know you've already played the game once.
6237160	6239160	I love a lot of sequels to movies and games
6239160	6240660	where they don't need to reestablish
6240660	6242160	or explain the simpler stuff.
6242160	6244160	They can just go nuts with established material
6244160	6246160	and ideas and this really hits that spot.
6246160	6248160	It gets kind of meta toward the end too,
6248160	6250160	so it's all about trickery to you?
6250160	6251660	Wherever have you come from?
6251660	6253660	No, I detest trickery.
6253660	6256160	If we ourselves are to suffer deception,
6256160	6258160	our hands are no longer tied.
6258160	6260160	It's like Clara kind of knows what's happening
6260160	6261660	without having to be told.
6261660	6263660	Some of her text options imply information
6263660	6265660	she never even learns herself,
6265660	6267660	but you know it from the other stories.
6267660	6270160	This is some Malkavian shit right here.
6270160	6272160	God, I should really make that vampire video
6272160	6273160	I teased years ago.
6273160	6275160	It's on the pile somewhere.
6275160	6277160	Hey, you, what are you doing out of your cage?
6277160	6279160	I'll get to you!
6279160	6281160	It even starts to become clear what the story
6281160	6284160	might really have been about all along.
6284160	6287160	Like, what does the Polyhedron actually do?
6287160	6289160	People say it can store dreams
6289160	6291160	so people can revisit them and share them
6291160	6294160	or trap a soul and keep a dead person alive,
6294160	6295160	but what does that mean?
6295160	6297160	Are souls literal things
6297160	6299660	or an ephemeral conceptual thing?
6299660	6301660	The idea of someone,
6301660	6303660	the presence they can manifest
6303660	6305160	through the effects of actions
6305160	6306660	from while they were alive?
6306660	6310160	Is a piece of my soul in this video?
6310160	6312660	Perhaps even surviving after my death?
6312660	6315160	I put a lot of myself in my work.
6315160	6317660	Am I immortal now?
6317660	6321160	In a sense, maybe I am.
6321160	6324160	I'm going to say the word now.
6324160	6326160	Now.
6326160	6328660	When did I say that?
6328660	6331160	Looking at the clock, it's 416 a.m.
6331160	6334160	on the 9th of November, 2019,
6334160	6337160	but when did I really say it?
6337160	6340660	I, now, will be 27
6340660	6343660	and talking about pathologic forever,
6343660	6346660	even if you come back in another 27 years.
6346660	6350160	Maybe I'm immortal and freed from earthly flesh
6350160	6352660	by existing in the form of a video.
6352660	6354660	Maybe the opposite is true.
6354660	6357160	Maybe I'm trapped here forever
6357160	6359660	and maybe this is worse than being dead.
6359660	6360660	Ahem.
6360660	6362660	Forgive me if my speech is unclear or absurd.
6362660	6364660	You have a lot more in-depth conversations
6364660	6367160	along these philosophical and spiritual lines,
6367160	6369660	and to me now, the Polyhedron feels like a metaphor
6369660	6371160	for video games themselves.
6371160	6372660	The rest of the town represents
6372660	6375160	the down-to-earth, day-to-day, boring reality
6375160	6377160	of walking to places, talking to people,
6377160	6379660	getting lied to, being a regular person,
6379660	6381660	eating food, getting sick sometimes,
6381660	6384160	and eventually dying, but in video games,
6384160	6386160	in art, death isn't real.
6386160	6387660	You can be whoever you like.
6387660	6389660	Games are stories, but more than that,
6389660	6391660	a way for people to share their stories
6391660	6393660	with others forever, to take part in them
6393660	6395660	and live on past the boundaries
6395660	6397660	of their simple material existence.
6397660	6400160	Everyone who made Pathologic will be dead one day,
6400160	6403160	but they'll still be here in this world they made,
6403160	6405660	staring out at you in eternal polygons,
6405660	6408660	talking to you, sharing their ideas and feelings,
6408660	6412160	a hand reaching from the grave to grasp you once more.
6412160	6415660	Art is the road to awe, to permanent expression,
6415660	6418160	and games are a collaborative expression too.
6418160	6421160	You're playing it, interacting, being in it.
6421160	6422660	This game is made for you.
6422660	6424160	Aren't you a part of it?
6424160	6425660	This game is a reminder of the immense
6425660	6427660	spiritual value of games,
6427660	6430160	to be somewhere else and move and act in it,
6430160	6433160	to be a piece of someone else's vision for a moment.
6433160	6435660	The Polyhedron represents the uplifting,
6435660	6438660	unrealistic, and yet truly real power
6438660	6441160	imbued upon us by our ability to have dreams,
6441160	6443160	literally and figuratively.
6443160	6444660	That's just how it reads to me, though.
6444660	6446660	It certainly feels that way at times.
6446660	6448160	Speaking of the Polyhedron,
6448160	6450160	when you visit there as Clara partway through,
6450160	6451660	you get to descend to the bottom
6451660	6453160	and meet the gods of the world
6453160	6455160	several days earlier than the other characters.
6455160	6458160	They're genuinely shocked to see you this time.
6458160	6460160	It's like Clara herself has more power
6460160	6462160	than the creators thought she would,
6462160	6464160	and here explains why Clara is the way she is,
6464160	6466660	why there's such confusion about her nature,
6466660	6468160	why there's two of her.
6468160	6469660	The powers that be are in disagreement
6469660	6471160	over who she is and what she's doing.
6471160	6472660	One of them thinks she's a thief,
6472660	6474160	and the other thinks that she is some kind
6474160	6475660	of divine being in their story.
6475660	6477160	I think this is actually really clever.
6477160	6479660	The powers that be are having competing interpretations
6479660	6481160	of this character they've made.
6481160	6483160	Clara's quest eventually leads to the discovery
6483160	6484660	of how her healing hands work.
6484660	6486660	They transform people's blood,
6486660	6489160	give them something that can protect them from the disease,
6489160	6491160	and if she uses it on stronger people,
6491160	6493160	for example, her bound, if they're sacrificed
6493160	6494660	and their blood is taken,
6494660	6497160	it can be used to make many cures for the plague,
6497160	6498660	so she can get seven of her bound
6498660	6500660	to agree to atone for their sins
6500660	6503160	by being sacrificed to save the town.
6503160	6504660	When you describe this to Foreman Oyun,
6504660	6507160	he sees it as a chance to undo the damage he's caused
6507160	6509160	and agrees wholeheartedly.
6509160	6510660	He tells you to tell the Haruspex
6510660	6512160	to not bother with the final trial,
6512160	6513660	the one where he jumps into a hole and dies,
6513660	6515160	since he no longer needs to kill him
6515160	6517160	to protect his position in the kin.
6517160	6518660	You can straight up ask him what happens
6518660	6520160	if he'd gone in the hole,
6520160	6521660	and he tells you he would have died
6521660	6524160	because, yeah, it's a big hole.
6524160	6525660	I left this out when I was talking about
6525660	6527160	the Haruspex for dramatic effect,
6527160	6528660	but I don't want to not mention it.
6528660	6530660	As the Haruspex, you do get Clara cryptically offering
6530660	6532660	to assist you, and if you agree,
6532660	6535160	when you go in the hole, you instead get this cool scene
6535160	6538160	where you can see your own corpse surrounded by executors
6538160	6540160	and you can choose someone from Clara's bound
6540160	6541660	to die in your place.
6541660	6544160	Artemy survives by doing this and then fights the Foreman,
6544160	6546160	so it really was a spiritual experience,
6546160	6548160	if you let the Changeling into your life at least.
6548160	6550660	I guess this is because Clara in the Haruspex's story
6550660	6552160	doesn't get her shit together enough
6552160	6554160	to realize she can use Oyun to solve
6554160	6556160	the plague problem directly herself.
6556160	6558160	Anyway, it's very funny to me that in Clara's run,
6558160	6559660	the Haruspex is genuinely prepping
6559660	6561660	to jump into a hole and die.
6561660	6564160	So Oyun and six others agree to make this sacrifice,
6564160	6565660	and that's her ending.
6565660	6567160	The town and tower get preserved,
6567160	6569160	but at the expense of people sometimes giving up
6569160	6570660	their lives to maintain it.
6570660	6572160	I like this ending. It feels like the reminder
6572160	6574160	that for society to survive intact
6574160	6577160	requires work and sacrifice to protect itself
6577160	6579660	from its own internal tensions and contradictions.
6579660	6580660	That sort of thing.
6580660	6583160	Clara's map evolutions are suitably miraculous.
6583160	6585660	Instead of either the town or the tower being monstrous,
6585660	6589160	the tower is a part of the town harboring some new thing,
6589160	6591160	a dream, a life, the future,
6591160	6592660	and the town is feeding it.
6592660	6595660	It's a symbiotic relationship which takes sacrifice
6595660	6597660	but which might be worth preserving,
6597660	6600660	and the sky is dreamlike reflecting either Clara's
6600660	6603160	more miraculous, fantastical perspective
6603160	6606160	or her knowledge that the world really is a dream of sorts.
6606160	6608160	Clara's first extra ending is nothing special.
6608160	6610160	You've already met them once in this playthrough,
6610160	6612160	so there's no real revelation here.
6612160	6613660	Hey, guys, it's me again.
6613660	6616660	Third time round now. How's it going?
6619660	6621160	Whoa, fuck.
6621160	6622660	Okay, that's cool.
6622660	6624660	The game keeps being meta about all the things
6624660	6625660	I think it won't address.
6625660	6627160	Like, just when meeting the developers
6627160	6629160	was starting to become a repetitive idea,
6629160	6631660	here it is getting one-upped by the third go-round
6631660	6633660	making fun of how that's starting to feel,
6633660	6635660	and here in the game, Clara kind of validates
6635660	6637660	my thoughts about the town and the polyhedron,
6637660	6639660	talking about these characters as if they're fragments
6639660	6642160	of real people, and in a way,
6642160	6644160	I really do feel like I know these people now.
6644160	6646660	I've spent a lot of time with them in their world
6646660	6648160	experiencing their creation.
6648160	6649660	You can even ask them more directly
6649660	6651160	what the other characters' stories
6651160	6652660	were supposed to be about.
6652660	6654660	It's a fantastic send-off getting to discuss the story
6654660	6656660	with its creators.
6656660	6659660	Holy shit, that's so fucking cool.
6659660	6662660	I talked about this earlier. It is on purpose.
6662660	6664660	Oh, man, this is great. I love this.
6664660	6666660	I utterly love this. This is the best thing ever,
6666660	6668660	and it's so tiny, so small.
6668660	6671160	It's the devs showing you all the little tricks
6671160	6673660	they used to make you frustrated and trapped
6673660	6677160	right there being complained about by you.
6677160	6679160	Ah, God, it's excellent.
6679160	6681160	You can ask what their plan was with the changeling,
6681160	6682660	and they make a joke about how rushed
6682660	6684160	and slapped together it was.
6684160	6686160	That's fun. I like that they're acknowledging things
6686160	6688660	the player would definitely have noticed about this by now.
6688660	6690660	It feels personal and real.
6690660	6692160	They're not resting on their laurels
6692160	6694160	and being pretentious about themes or ideas.
6694160	6696660	They're apologizing for things they knew they got wrong
6696660	6698160	and even making a joke at the expense
6698160	6700160	of this own indulgent last part.
6700160	6702660	What a great ending. God, I've loved the story of this.
6702660	6704660	I wish I could have gone into more detail about it,
6704660	6706660	but just talking about the things that jumped out to me
6706660	6708160	the most has taken this long.
6708160	6709660	It's been genuinely super awesome.
6710160	6712160	Even though it's all fake, it's all just a kid's game,
6712160	6714660	and on top of that, it's all just a video game,
6714660	6716660	I feel a sense of achievement for having stuck with it
6716660	6718660	in a strange way. Also, I quite like how hard
6718660	6720660	you have to work to achieve the actual good ending.
6720660	6723160	Like, the Bachelor's ending is just, like, fucked.
6723160	6725660	He's such a shithead, and the Haruspex's ending
6725660	6728160	does kind of destroy a really awesome, cool invention.
6728160	6730660	It's only by actually playing through the whole game
6730660	6733160	at least twice that you get the chance
6733160	6735660	to really get a decent ending for people.
6735660	6737660	Breathe it in.
6737660	6739160	Actually, no, don't breathe it in.
6739160	6740660	You didn't have to play the whole game.
6740660	6741660	You just listened to me talk about it
6741660	6743660	for a couple hours. Fuck you.
6743660	6745660	There are fine things, old boy,
6745660	6748160	which are more brilliant when unfinished
6748160	6751160	than when finished too much.
6751160	6754160	So Pathologic does a lot of very clever things
6754160	6757160	to make you feel a way games rarely even try
6757160	6758660	to make people feel,
6758660	6760660	and I think it achieves its goals fairly well.
6760660	6763160	It's an experience I have a hard time recommending
6763160	6764660	and which I know to be flawed,
6764660	6767160	but which I'm extremely glad I played in full.
6767160	6768660	Pathologic is the antidote
6768660	6771160	to the entire modern game design ethos.
6771160	6773160	It isn't a skinner box that rewards you
6773160	6776660	with simpler satisfactions like beautiful splatter graphics
6776660	6778660	when you get a headshot or a quest
6778660	6780660	that makes you feel heroic and powerful.
6780660	6783660	It makes you stare at the abyss of human cruelty
6783660	6786160	and ignorance and dares you to blink,
6786160	6788160	to close the game and give up.
6788160	6790160	I can't think of many other games that manage that.
6790160	6793160	I super love this game and its world.
6793160	6795660	Even though I don't think I'll ever want to touch it again
6796660	6798160	I'm glad I did it all,
6798160	6799160	and I feel like I've learned a lot
6799160	6800660	about the potential of games
6800660	6803160	and the many unique ways games can have
6803160	6804660	all kinds of effects on you.
6804660	6807660	All that said, and I've said it so much in this video,
6807660	6810660	I'm not making this to recommend a 15-year-old game.
6810660	6812660	I'm making it because I couldn't recommend
6812660	6814160	this 15-year-old game.
6814160	6816660	I could barely even recommend it to myself.
6816660	6818660	It took years to get around to playing it
6818660	6820160	past the first couple hours.
6820160	6821660	I had a really interesting time,
6821660	6824660	but 65 hours is a long time to spend
6824660	6826660	to eventually have an interesting time,
6826660	6828660	and I couldn't in good conscience
6828660	6831660	inflict that on someone else by telling them to try it.
6831660	6834660	Especially not now.
6834660	6837660	["Hidamare"]
6837660	6841660	["Hidamare"]
6841660	6844660	["Hidamare"]
6844660	6847660	So, yeah, love Pathologic.
6847660	6848660	Amazing game.
6848660	6850660	One of the best games ever.
6850660	6852660	Artistic masterpiece, but don't play it.
6852660	6853660	It sucks.
6853660	6855660	Luckily, there exists a game that does everything
6855660	6858160	Pathologic 1 does wrong right.
6858160	6861160	A game I can recommend so, so much more.
6861160	6863660	That game is Pathologic 2.
6863660	6865660	You don't have to play one to understand two,
6865660	6867660	especially not now that I've told you everything
6867660	6868660	you need to know about it.
6868660	6870660	When I sat down to play Pathologic 2,
6870660	6873660	I cynically assumed it would be a compromised version of one,
6873660	6875660	graphically and technically improved
6875660	6878660	but lacking the sorts of bold design elements
6878660	6880660	that contributed to making the original so unique.
6880660	6883660	Like, making a game like Pathologic more accessible
6883660	6885660	and understanding for a newer audience,
6885660	6887660	making it more engaging to play even,
6887660	6889660	would surely mitigate what it did best.
6889660	6892660	I've never assumed so wrong.
6892660	6895160	It's even more horrifying, even harder,
6895160	6898160	and a massive step forward in every possible way.
6898160	6899160	Except the music.
6899160	6900660	The music in 1 is better in my opinion,
6900660	6902660	but the music is still incredible stuff.
6902660	6905660	Like, top 10 best music in games, no question.
6905660	6907660	The creators made good on maintaining
6907660	6910160	the atmosphere and feel while removing the bugs
6910160	6911660	and elements that were truly bad
6911660	6913160	and took away from the experience.
6913160	6914660	They even threw in meta stuff
6914660	6916160	for people who played the first
6916160	6918160	or even people who knew the twists from the first.
6918160	6920160	I learned painstakingly the hard way
6920160	6922160	and you just learned easily over one video.
6922160	6926160	Perhaps, finally, after all these long years,
6926160	6928160	the deep game is here.
6928160	6932160	Well, almost here because Pathologic 2 isn't done yet.
6932160	6934160	It's not in early access per se
6934160	6935660	but not only is it still getting
6935660	6937660	what I'd say are critical bug fixes,
6937660	6939660	for example, an update while I was making this video
6939660	6941160	solved the performance problems
6941160	6942660	I would have talked about right now,
6942660	6944160	so nice one there,
6944160	6946160	but only one of the game's original stories
6946160	6948160	is in this version, at least right now.
6948160	6949660	The Haruspex.
6949660	6951660	It's still a full game because Pathologic
6951660	6953660	was three full games already basically,
6953660	6956160	but they're going to add more if they can afford to.
6956160	6958660	I'd buy the others as DLC or expansions, frankly.
6958660	6960660	There was a demo, the Marble Nest,
6960660	6962660	a few years ago where you play as the Bachelor for a day
6962660	6964660	and they just patched that into the main game
6964660	6966660	as an improved version of itself
6966660	6968160	and that's awesome too,
6968160	6971660	and yes, the Bachelor is even more of a shit.
6971660	6973160	I love him.
6973160	6976160	Truth does not do as much good in the world
6976160	6978160	as its counterfeits do evil.
6978160	6979660	God, what a great character.
6979660	6981160	I love him so much.
6981160	6983160	He's just, he's so well written
6983160	6984660	as an insufferable fucker.
6984660	6986160	Oh, man, he's great.
6986160	6988160	I swear to God I'm gonna cosplay as him
6988160	6989160	first chance I get.
6989160	6991660	Pathologic 2 isn't exactly a block puh...
6991660	6992660	there.
6992660	6994160	Sorry, I've spent hours and hours
6994160	6995660	recording this voiceover.
6995660	6997660	The game isn't exactly a blockbuster,
6997660	6998660	smash hit.
6998660	7000160	It's a niche sequel
7000160	7002160	to a barely known cult classic from Russia
7002160	7003160	a decade ago,
7003160	7005160	loved mostly by native Russian speakers
7005160	7007160	and Western pretentious nerd critics.
7007160	7009160	That's not a jab at pretentious nerd critics.
7009160	7010160	I'm one of those.
7010160	7011660	Did you hear that fucking bit
7011660	7013160	about this video having a soul?
7013160	7014660	Come on, let's not pretend I'm any better,
7014660	7016160	but even if we love it,
7016160	7018160	we're not exactly a huge demographic.
7018160	7020660	I don't tend to do calls to action in my videos.
7020660	7022660	I like to let people make up their own minds
7022660	7024160	about what to do with their lives
7024160	7025660	or whether a game is for them.
7025660	7027160	If you play Pathologic 1
7027160	7030160	after I deliberately didn't recommend it,
7030160	7031160	congratulations.
7031160	7032660	You passed the true test
7032660	7034160	by deciding to play the game for yourself,
7034160	7035660	and I love you for that.
7035660	7037160	Good luck with the fight with Bali,
7037160	7039160	and on day one, you can find extra food
7039160	7040660	left out on Nina's grave.
7040660	7042160	Pretend I left that for you.
7042160	7043660	Mwah. Keep the fact
7043660	7045660	I didn't recommend the first game
7045660	7047660	despite loving it in mind
7047660	7050160	when I say you should buy Pathologic 2.
7050160	7051660	It still might not be for you,
7051660	7054660	but you absolutely must try it to find out,
7054660	7056660	and in a world where mainstream games
7056660	7058660	are starting to feel like they're converging
7058660	7061160	upon the same Pavlovian uniform design
7061160	7063160	with only minor branding variations,
7063160	7065160	supporting independent work and true experiments
7065160	7067160	with the form, even if they don't turn out
7067160	7068660	to be something you personally like,
7068660	7071160	seems like THE step forward for video games.
7071160	7073160	The only other obvious step forward I can think of
7073160	7075160	is starting a game developers union.
7075160	7077660	Pathologic 1 is the best game you didn't play.
7077660	7080660	It's the best game I almost didn't play,
7080660	7082660	but Pathologic 2 is better,
7082660	7084660	and you are going to play it.
7084660	7087160	Go experience one of the most unique,
7087160	7090660	satisfyingly hurtful experiences there is in gaming.
7090660	7092160	I'd analyze it in detail,
7092160	7094160	but that would require spoiling it,
7094160	7096160	and you are going to play this,
7096160	7097660	so I wouldn't do that to you.
7097660	7099160	Not for a while, at least.
7099160	7100660	I need time to collect data
7100660	7102160	about other people's experiences
7102160	7104660	and think about how it achieves the effects it does,
7104660	7107160	and I want to play it all the way through three more times.
7107160	7108660	Okay, everybody break.
7108660	7110660	Go play Pathologic 2 and meet back here
7110660	7112660	in, I don't know, six months to compare notes
7112660	7114660	for my analysis of the sequel.
7114660	7116160	Oh, and whatever you do,
7116160	7118160	don't take the traveler's deal!
7118160	7121160	You weren't supposed to take the deal, Brendan!
7121160	7133660	♪♪
7133660	7136160	Hey, thanks for watching all the way, friend.
7136160	7138660	My videos are supported by my backers over on Patreon,
7138660	7140160	and I love them for it.
7140160	7142160	I used to do a thing where I read everyone out
7142160	7144160	who backed a certain amount during the credits,
7144160	7146160	but I have the best problem ever
7146160	7148660	of there being too many people to do that,
7148660	7150160	so I'm reading them out one last time
7150160	7151660	before I change things over.
7151660	7154160	In the future, people who back me $10 or more per video
7154160	7156160	can vote on what my next video is.
7156160	7158160	I'll have polls for what I feel like working on
7158160	7160660	or based on ideas and suggestions you folks give me.
7160660	7162660	I always want to do, like, four different things at once,
7162660	7165160	so this will hopefully give me some more perspective.
7165160	7166660	I'm amazed that I've somehow been
7166660	7168160	as well-supported as I have,
7168160	7170660	and I'm eternally thankful for being able
7170660	7173660	to do ridiculous things like get covered in soy,
7173660	7175160	build and destroy a set,
7175160	7177160	or spend almost a month playing and reading
7177160	7180160	and writing about an old Russian video game masterpiece.
7180160	7182160	With your continued support, I hope to do
7182160	7183660	even more ridiculous things.
7183660	7185160	So for the last time,
7185160	7186660	at least for the foreseeable future,
7186660	7188160	if I ever finish any of the video games
7188160	7189660	I'm trying to make, I'll hide a reading
7189660	7191160	of all my patrons' names in there.
7191160	7192660	In addition to all the names
7192660	7194160	scrolling past the screen right now,
7194160	7196160	I'd especially like to thank
