WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:26.160
Ha, great play Mark, it's a real...

00:26.160 --> 00:27.160
KILLER!

00:27.160 --> 00:28.660
**Laughter**

00:28.660 --> 00:31.660
**Intro Music**

00:31.660 --> 00:33.660
**Explosion**

00:39.160 --> 00:42.660
Pathologic is one of the best and smartest games that's ever been made.

00:42.660 --> 00:44.660
And you know that's true because no one's played it.

00:44.660 --> 00:46.660
Okay, that's not quite accurate.

00:46.660 --> 00:48.660
A fair amount of people have tried to play it.

00:48.660 --> 00:50.660
The Steam release has achievements

00:50.660 --> 00:54.160
and there's an achievement for surviving the first of the twelve in-game days.

00:54.160 --> 00:55.660
A day lasts about two hours.

00:55.660 --> 00:58.160
According to its global gameplay stats page,

00:58.160 --> 01:01.660
just 13.2% of all players made it that far.

01:01.660 --> 01:03.160
The achievement for day one is called

01:03.160 --> 01:04.160
I'm Not Dead.

01:04.160 --> 01:05.660
It's just that kind of game.

01:05.660 --> 01:09.160
It occupies a certain kind of space in game criticism.

01:09.160 --> 01:12.160
Some game critics, mostly the ones who are...

01:12.160 --> 01:13.660
uh...good,

01:13.660 --> 01:15.660
will sing its praises day and night,

01:15.660 --> 01:17.660
call it the best game you've never played,

01:17.660 --> 01:21.660
argue it's a shining bastion of everything gaming could be but often isn't,

01:21.660 --> 01:25.160
and labor very intensely to explain why games don't have to be fun

01:25.160 --> 01:26.160
to be good.

01:26.160 --> 01:27.660
Journalist, board game critic,

01:27.660 --> 01:29.160
and wizard Quentin Smith

01:29.160 --> 01:32.160
wrote three incredible articles about it in 2008

01:32.160 --> 01:33.160
for Rock Paper Shotgun,

01:33.160 --> 01:35.160
which are probably hugely responsible

01:35.160 --> 01:37.160
for a lot of Western awareness of the game.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.660
But when someone reads articles like these,

01:39.660 --> 01:41.160
they might make the horrendous mistake

01:41.160 --> 01:42.660
of actually trying to play it,

01:42.660 --> 01:44.160
and we all know how that goes, don't we?

01:44.160 --> 01:45.660
The game's just not fun.

01:45.660 --> 01:47.160
It's not interesting to look at.

01:47.160 --> 01:49.160
It doesn't feel good to play mechanically.

01:49.160 --> 01:50.160
It's frustrating.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.660
The story is confusing and wordy

01:52.660 --> 01:54.660
and translated from Russian by a mystical rat

01:54.660 --> 01:56.160
who only speaks in riddles.

01:56.160 --> 01:58.160
It lacks almost anything

01:58.160 --> 02:00.660
that would normally keep a person playing a game,

02:00.660 --> 02:04.160
and yet people keep saying it's great.

02:04.160 --> 02:05.660
I think it's great too.

02:05.660 --> 02:07.160
It's an incredible game

02:07.160 --> 02:09.160
that barely anyone will have the resilience

02:09.160 --> 02:11.160
to actually play long enough to appreciate,

02:11.160 --> 02:13.160
and that's maybe even the point.

02:13.160 --> 02:17.160
So this time on the assorted mess of unrelated concepts

02:17.160 --> 02:19.160
that can scarcely be called a YouTube channel,

02:19.160 --> 02:20.660
I'm going to talk about all the things

02:20.660 --> 02:22.660
I find particularly interesting about this game

02:22.660 --> 02:24.660
and what they bring to making it so unique.

02:24.660 --> 02:26.660
I'm also going to talk about the problems it has

02:26.660 --> 02:28.660
that prevented it from seeing mainstream success

02:28.660 --> 02:30.160
and then give a spirited defense

02:30.160 --> 02:31.660
of half of those problems anyway

02:31.660 --> 02:33.660
in the name of their artistic value.

02:33.660 --> 02:35.160
It's not a bad game.

02:35.160 --> 02:38.160
It's an amazing game, but it's also a bad game.

02:38.160 --> 02:40.160
It's a major time investment too.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.160
In many ways, it's a more interesting game

02:42.160 --> 02:43.660
to discuss than play.

02:43.660 --> 02:45.660
It's possible that Pathologic only exists

02:45.660 --> 02:47.160
so that we may speculate about it.

02:47.160 --> 02:49.660
So in a way, making this video

02:49.660 --> 02:51.660
is really for my benefit more than yours.

02:51.660 --> 02:53.660
I played over 60 hours of this thing.

02:53.660 --> 02:55.660
I have almost 600 gigs

02:55.660 --> 02:57.660
of Pathologic footage on my hard drive.

02:57.660 --> 02:59.660
I get to make a video about it!

02:59.660 --> 03:01.160
That was the deal!

03:01.160 --> 03:03.660
♪ ♪

03:03.660 --> 03:07.160
Part one, what is Pathologic?

03:07.160 --> 03:08.660
Probably should've gone in the intro.

03:08.660 --> 03:11.160
On the surface, it's a very easy game to explain.

03:11.160 --> 03:14.160
Pathologic is a first-person survival horror RPG

03:14.160 --> 03:16.660
with story rich and atmospheric.

03:16.660 --> 03:18.160
Doesn't it look fun?

03:18.160 --> 03:20.660
It's set in a town deep in the Russian steppe

03:20.660 --> 03:23.160
at some ambiguous point in the last 100 years,

03:23.160 --> 03:25.660
and by ambiguous, I mean imaginary.

03:25.660 --> 03:28.160
There are guns, but they're kind of old-timey types.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.160
A lot of the decor ranges from the late 1800s

03:30.160 --> 03:31.660
to early 1900s,

03:31.660 --> 03:33.660
but there's some Baroque-looking buildings lying around.

03:33.660 --> 03:35.660
The town is built around its meat industry,

03:35.660 --> 03:37.660
so there's bowls everywhere, but the abattoir

03:37.660 --> 03:39.660
is some kind of huge ancient building

03:39.660 --> 03:41.160
fused with the earth,

03:41.160 --> 03:43.660
and its workers live in a huge housing complex

03:43.660 --> 03:45.660
that looks nothing like the rest of the town,

03:45.660 --> 03:47.160
and some buildings are actively impossible

03:47.160 --> 03:49.160
like these staircases to nowhere,

03:49.160 --> 03:50.660
and then there's the Polyhedron,

03:50.660 --> 03:53.160
a giant floating tower that cannot be

03:53.160 --> 03:56.160
sticking out of the earth suspended by unknown means

03:56.160 --> 03:58.660
and made partially out of its own blueprints,

03:58.660 --> 04:01.160
so, yeah, I'd say the time period's pretty ambiguous.

04:01.160 --> 04:03.160
You play as one of three different kinds of Doctor

04:03.160 --> 04:05.160
who each arrive in the town for their own reasons

04:05.160 --> 04:07.160
just at the beginning of the outbreak

04:07.160 --> 04:09.660
of a horrible plague that threatens the entire town

04:09.660 --> 04:12.160
and probably the world if it manages to spread.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.660
The Doctors have 12 days to get their shit together,

04:14.660 --> 04:16.160
save the town,

04:16.160 --> 04:18.160
and somehow survive long enough to do that.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.660
In some ways, it's kind of an immersive sim.

04:20.660 --> 04:24.160
You have an inventory, weapons, clothes, and items,

04:24.160 --> 04:26.160
but look at the wording of these items.

04:26.160 --> 04:28.160
It's not food. It's rations.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.160
It's not medicine or healing.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.660
It's drugs, and what is other?

04:32.660 --> 04:34.660
Well, that's where you keep less common stuff

04:34.660 --> 04:37.160
you can use or sell like hairpins and bracelets

04:37.160 --> 04:39.660
and flowers you picked, and are those human organs?

04:39.660 --> 04:41.160
As soon as you hit new game,

04:41.160 --> 04:43.160
it becomes clear that any simple description

04:43.160 --> 04:45.160
of its basic genre conventions

04:45.160 --> 04:47.660
doesn't capture how the game actually feels.

04:47.660 --> 04:49.160
The three playable characters,

04:49.160 --> 04:51.160
the Bachelor, the Haruspex, and the Changeling,

04:51.160 --> 04:53.160
aren't simply chosen by a menu.

04:53.160 --> 04:56.160
So it's all about trickery to you?

04:56.160 --> 04:57.660
Wherever have you come from?

04:57.660 --> 05:00.660
No. No.

05:00.660 --> 05:02.660
I detest trickery,

05:02.660 --> 05:06.160
but if we ourselves are to suffer deception,

05:06.160 --> 05:08.660
our hands are no longer tied.

05:08.660 --> 05:10.160
Where are we?

05:10.160 --> 05:11.660
We open in a theater,

05:11.660 --> 05:13.660
which you actually visit in the game world later,

05:13.660 --> 05:15.160
looking down on all three characters

05:15.160 --> 05:17.660
as they argue on stage over who is best suited

05:17.660 --> 05:18.660
to solving the problem.

05:18.660 --> 05:20.660
I can do miracles.

05:20.660 --> 05:22.160
Just let me.

05:22.160 --> 05:24.160
Will you please be quiet?

05:24.160 --> 05:27.160
The dialogue gets across each character's basic viewpoint.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.660
It's also written in a strangely theatrical way.

05:29.660 --> 05:31.160
The truth is my shepherd.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.160
I will perform the operation.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.160
Medica morbo adhibe.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.660
Don't you go all bossy on me, clever clogs.

05:38.660 --> 05:41.660
This calls for the gentle hand of a surgeon.

05:41.660 --> 05:45.160
Your gentle hands are used to killing,

05:45.160 --> 05:47.160
not giving life.

05:47.160 --> 05:50.160
You will inevitably do harm.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.160
As for Brainy,

05:52.160 --> 05:55.160
he has no regard for casualties at all.

05:55.160 --> 05:56.660
It sounds written.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.660
It's not even trying to be natural.

05:58.660 --> 06:00.160
It's like you're watching bad actors

06:00.160 --> 06:01.660
stumbling through their lines

06:01.660 --> 06:03.160
while rehearsing for a play,

06:03.160 --> 06:04.660
which you are.

06:04.660 --> 06:06.160
The actual play is about to begin

06:06.160 --> 06:08.160
with you playing as one of them.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.660
They conclude they can't work together

06:09.660 --> 06:11.160
and time is of the essence,

06:11.160 --> 06:12.660
and the house lights go down.

06:12.660 --> 06:14.160
We won't ever get along.

06:14.160 --> 06:16.160
I suggest we be on our way.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.660
The sooner the better.

06:17.660 --> 06:19.160
Off we go then?

06:19.160 --> 06:20.160
Let's go.

06:20.160 --> 06:22.160
The clock is ticking.

06:26.660 --> 06:28.160
When you go to leave the theater,

06:28.160 --> 06:30.660
then you get to choose which one you play.

06:30.660 --> 06:32.160
Even before the game started,

06:32.160 --> 06:34.160
the presentation is strangely off-kilter

06:34.160 --> 06:36.160
and brings in ideas of performance

06:36.160 --> 06:37.160
and the theatrical.

06:37.160 --> 06:40.160
It's definitely the weirdest character selection process

06:40.160 --> 06:41.160
I've ever experienced.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.660
You can't play as the changeling

06:42.660 --> 06:43.660
until you've finished the game

06:43.660 --> 06:44.660
as one of the first two,

06:44.660 --> 06:46.160
but frankly, if you're actually going

06:46.160 --> 06:47.660
to play the game more than once,

06:47.660 --> 06:49.660
you should play both of the first two first

06:49.660 --> 06:51.160
and really you ought to start with The Bachelor.

06:51.160 --> 06:54.160
He's regarded as the default pathologic experience.

06:54.160 --> 06:55.660
He's slightly easier,

06:55.660 --> 06:57.660
and his character is an outsider from the town,

06:57.660 --> 06:59.660
so you learn more about it from that perspective,

06:59.660 --> 07:00.660
and that's really helpful.

07:00.660 --> 07:02.160
The Bachelor, Daniil Dankovsky,

07:02.160 --> 07:03.660
is a bachelor of medicine

07:03.660 --> 07:06.160
and is working on the ultimate utopian project

07:06.160 --> 07:07.660
a doctor can aspire to,

07:07.660 --> 07:09.160
defeating death itself.

07:09.660 --> 07:11.660
It's not going well.

07:11.660 --> 07:14.160
The powers that be, and the government I guess,

07:14.160 --> 07:15.160
are shutting down his lab

07:15.160 --> 07:17.160
unless he can come up with something substantive

07:17.160 --> 07:18.660
to back up his ideas.

07:18.660 --> 07:20.160
He's come to the town because he's heard

07:20.160 --> 07:22.160
that a man who lives there, Simon Cain,

07:22.160 --> 07:24.660
has lived a remarkably long life,

07:24.660 --> 07:26.160
so maybe he can learn something

07:26.160 --> 07:27.660
about defeating death from him.

07:27.660 --> 07:30.160
Your quest log has the main mission for that day,

07:30.160 --> 07:31.660
the side quests for that day,

07:31.660 --> 07:33.160
and your overall mission,

07:33.160 --> 07:35.160
which for The Bachelor is saving his career

07:35.160 --> 07:36.660
and maybe all human life

07:36.660 --> 07:39.160
by learning how to defeat death from Simon.

07:39.160 --> 07:40.660
So you go to meet him,

07:40.660 --> 07:42.160
and you learn from Simon's brother Georgie

07:42.160 --> 07:44.160
that he died right before you got there.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.660
Oh.

07:45.660 --> 07:47.660
Well, Georgie asks you to help him find out

07:47.660 --> 07:49.160
who or what killed him.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.160
Luckily, you think you have a lead on how he died

07:51.160 --> 07:53.160
because he met with a town community leader,

07:53.160 --> 07:55.160
Isidor Burakh, right beforehand,

07:55.160 --> 07:57.160
and he was a respected local cultural figure

07:57.160 --> 07:59.160
and the town's head doctor of sorts,

07:59.160 --> 08:01.160
so they might have discussed his health

08:01.160 --> 08:02.660
or who might have wanted him dead.

08:02.660 --> 08:05.660
So you go to meet him, and he's dead too.

08:05.660 --> 08:08.160
People are speculating about a serial killer

08:08.160 --> 08:10.160
or a demonic step creature of myth,

08:10.160 --> 08:12.660
the Shabnackadir, being responsible,

08:12.660 --> 08:15.660
and then you start to notice signs of a plague,

08:15.660 --> 08:18.660
and it becomes clear it probably killed both of them

08:18.660 --> 08:20.660
and is about to kill everyone else.

08:20.660 --> 08:23.660
For days and days, as the lives of people in the town

08:23.660 --> 08:25.660
and your own odds of survival get worse and worse,

08:25.660 --> 08:27.160
that original quest,

08:27.160 --> 08:29.160
Dankovsky's bright-eyed, naive mission

08:29.160 --> 08:32.160
to defeat death itself on his way to meet a dead man,

08:32.160 --> 08:34.660
will stare you in the face every time you open your menu

08:34.660 --> 08:36.160
and check your mission.

08:36.160 --> 08:38.160
For Dankovsky, this message doesn't update

08:38.160 --> 08:40.660
when saving himself or the town become his priority.

08:40.660 --> 08:42.660
For the rest of your sad life,

08:42.660 --> 08:44.160
you have to deal with being reminded

08:44.160 --> 08:46.660
that you came here for something completely unrelated.

08:46.660 --> 08:49.160
So, yeah, get used to that.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.660
Pathologic's not a game about getting answers

08:51.660 --> 08:54.160
or resolutions to your personal quests

08:54.160 --> 08:56.160
or even about being heroic.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.160
It's not a game about feeling safe or having fun.

08:59.160 --> 09:01.160
It's a game about part two,

09:01.160 --> 09:03.160
futility and disempowerment.

09:03.160 --> 09:05.160
You might be wondering why I'm reading the words out

09:05.160 --> 09:06.160
when they're on the screen,

09:06.160 --> 09:07.660
and that's because some people like to listen

09:07.660 --> 09:09.160
to these videos instead of watch them.

09:09.160 --> 09:11.160
I put a lot of effort into my visuals,

09:11.160 --> 09:13.660
but, you know, that's fine.

09:13.660 --> 09:15.160
So I think an important way of explaining

09:15.160 --> 09:17.160
the features and effects of this game

09:17.160 --> 09:18.160
is to talk about the first thing

09:18.160 --> 09:20.160
that'll probably happen to a new player.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.660
You start the game in the house of Eva Yan,

09:21.660 --> 09:23.160
who's letting you sleep upstairs.

09:23.160 --> 09:25.160
She tells you that she's heard noises outside

09:25.160 --> 09:27.160
and there's some strange men hanging out in her garden.

09:27.160 --> 09:30.160
Oh, I know how games work. This is a tutorial quest.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.160
RPGs sometimes have easy early quests

09:32.160 --> 09:34.660
that act as a sort of microcosm of the game,

09:34.660 --> 09:37.160
a tutorial for how various mechanics work.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.660
So you go outside and you're greeted

09:38.660 --> 09:41.660
by these strange boys.

09:41.660 --> 09:44.160
These aren't the characters hanging out in her garden.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.660
These are more tutorial figures.

09:46.660 --> 09:49.160
These are characters that pop up a lot in the game,

09:49.160 --> 09:50.660
tragedians and executors.

09:50.660 --> 09:52.160
These are their costumes.

09:52.160 --> 09:53.660
They're actors at the local theater

09:53.660 --> 09:55.160
performing plays and so on,

09:55.160 --> 09:57.160
but executors also perform important roles

09:57.160 --> 09:59.160
during the plague, like getting posted up

09:59.160 --> 10:01.160
outside the houses of important sick people

10:01.160 --> 10:02.160
to relay messages.

10:02.160 --> 10:03.660
Given that the game is already being framed

10:03.660 --> 10:05.660
as one large theater performance

10:05.660 --> 10:06.660
with you as an actor,

10:06.660 --> 10:08.160
sometimes they break the fourth wall,

10:08.160 --> 10:10.160
like right now where they're telling you,

10:10.160 --> 10:11.660
a living human person,

10:11.660 --> 10:13.660
how to live in the world.

10:13.660 --> 10:16.160
These characters teach you how the basic mechanics work.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.660
Time advances no matter what,

10:17.660 --> 10:19.160
so if you don't do the important things

10:19.160 --> 10:20.660
you're supposed to be doing,

10:20.660 --> 10:22.160
other people will have to do them for you

10:22.160 --> 10:23.160
and might get sick,

10:23.160 --> 10:24.660
and you might need them not to get sick,

10:24.660 --> 10:26.160
so maybe don't let that happen.

10:26.160 --> 10:27.660
Your reputation is important,

10:27.660 --> 10:29.160
so don't start too many fights.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.660
Eat food so you don't starve and die,

10:31.660 --> 10:32.660
and so on.

10:32.660 --> 10:34.660
This game came out in, like, 2004,

10:34.660 --> 10:36.660
so the idea of having to eat to not die

10:36.660 --> 10:38.660
and time mechanics was actually pretty unique

10:38.660 --> 10:39.660
for the time.

10:39.660 --> 10:41.660
This is executed in an awesome way.

10:41.660 --> 10:43.160
Look at how this tutorial is framed.

10:43.160 --> 10:45.660
This conversation won't take too much of your time,

10:45.660 --> 10:48.160
especially since time stops during dialogues,

10:48.160 --> 10:50.160
and our dialogue is extremely important.

10:50.160 --> 10:52.160
You need to know how to play, after all.

10:52.160 --> 10:53.660
What are you talking about?

10:53.660 --> 10:55.660
I'm neither a gambler nor an actor.

10:55.660 --> 10:58.160
He doesn't understand what the Tragedian means by play.

10:58.160 --> 11:00.660
The Tragedian is talking past him to you

11:00.660 --> 11:02.160
so that you know the mechanics,

11:02.160 --> 11:05.160
but the Bachelor has no idea why someone's telling him this.

11:05.160 --> 11:07.160
Need I remind a wise man like you

11:07.160 --> 11:09.660
of the fact hunger is sated with food?

11:09.660 --> 11:11.660
Food can be found in shops.

11:11.660 --> 11:14.160
The Bachelor is having the weirdest conversation

11:14.160 --> 11:15.160
of his life.

11:15.160 --> 11:16.660
The fourth wall-breaking stuff in this game

11:16.660 --> 11:18.160
is genuinely the best.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.660
Anyway, what's next?

11:19.660 --> 11:21.660
Ah, yes, the side quest.

11:21.660 --> 11:24.160
So you go around to see about the men in Eva's garden

11:24.160 --> 11:25.660
and get a cutscene showing them,

11:25.660 --> 11:28.160
and you realize one of them is a creepy-looking,

11:28.160 --> 11:30.660
inhuman worm-man.

11:30.660 --> 11:33.660
Great, another thing I'll have to figure out later, I guess.

11:33.660 --> 11:36.160
If you try to make them leave in a threatening way in dialogue,

11:36.160 --> 11:37.160
a fight starts.

11:37.160 --> 11:38.660
The way fights work in this game

11:38.660 --> 11:41.160
is you get beaten to death in a matter of seconds

11:41.160 --> 11:42.660
and the game is over.

11:42.660 --> 11:45.160
♪

11:45.160 --> 11:46.660
Oh.

11:46.660 --> 11:47.660
Oh, jeez.

11:47.660 --> 11:49.160
Hello again, you two.

11:49.160 --> 11:50.660
Ah, no need to be so dramatic.

11:50.660 --> 11:52.660
Actually, no, that's your job, isn't it?

11:52.660 --> 11:56.660
In Pathologic, combat deliberately feels off.

11:56.660 --> 11:58.160
The game has fighting mechanics

11:58.160 --> 12:01.160
in the same sense that a car being driven off a cliff

12:01.160 --> 12:02.660
has flight mechanics.

12:02.660 --> 12:05.160
Punching is slow and plays a random animation

12:05.160 --> 12:07.660
with a different length before the attack actually goes off,

12:07.660 --> 12:09.660
and its range is highly deceptive.

12:09.660 --> 12:11.660
The range enemies have with their attacks

12:11.660 --> 12:13.160
is hard to decipher as well.

12:13.160 --> 12:17.160
It's very swimmy, like there's lag in a single-player game.

12:17.160 --> 12:20.160
You have to learn to intuit exactly when to close in

12:20.160 --> 12:21.660
for your attack to hit

12:21.660 --> 12:23.660
and when to step back and not get killed.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.160
It's quite hard to be good at fighting in this game.

12:26.160 --> 12:27.660
The game does everything it can

12:27.660 --> 12:30.160
to stack the deck against you if you get in a fight.

12:30.160 --> 12:32.660
The muggers who spawn at night open their combat with you

12:32.660 --> 12:34.160
by throwing a knife at your face,

12:34.160 --> 12:37.160
which, no joke, deals, like, 90% of your health

12:37.160 --> 12:38.160
in a single hit.

12:38.160 --> 12:41.160
No one gets distracted by guards once they pick a target.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.660
They just keep going for you

12:42.660 --> 12:45.160
while the guards chase them and hit them in the back,

12:45.160 --> 12:47.160
and they seem to only reliably drop loot

12:47.160 --> 12:48.660
if you're the one who kills them.

12:48.660 --> 12:51.160
You can right-click to trigger a blocking animation,

12:51.160 --> 12:52.160
which is pretty cool.

12:52.160 --> 12:53.660
It doesn't actually do anything, though.

12:53.660 --> 12:55.660
Guns are eventually an option.

12:55.660 --> 12:57.660
They kill in one or two hits,

12:57.660 --> 12:59.160
but bullets are super rare.

12:59.160 --> 13:01.660
They're really expensive, and you have a tendency to miss

13:01.660 --> 13:04.660
even when you're pointing the gun right at someone's head.

13:04.660 --> 13:06.660
I don't know. It just feels a little weird,

13:06.660 --> 13:08.660
but this actually works in the context of the gameplay

13:08.660 --> 13:10.660
because it further disincentivizes you

13:10.660 --> 13:12.660
in doing combat because even sure bets,

13:12.660 --> 13:14.660
like bringing a gun to a knife fight,

13:14.660 --> 13:16.160
are never really that sure.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.160
Fighting always feels like a risk,

13:18.160 --> 13:20.160
and it instills that you're not really supposed

13:20.160 --> 13:23.160
to live through this game while getting in tons of fights.

13:23.160 --> 13:26.660
You're never handed satisfaction or enjoyment from fighting,

13:26.660 --> 13:28.160
which normally is the sort of thing

13:28.160 --> 13:31.160
that's the most visceral part of a game experience.

13:31.160 --> 13:33.660
The game knows this, too, and likes to throw challenges

13:33.660 --> 13:35.660
designed to hurt you and not be satisfying

13:35.660 --> 13:37.160
right in your face.

13:37.160 --> 13:38.660
Once you're past the point in the game

13:38.660 --> 13:40.660
where you're very likely to have a revolver,

13:40.660 --> 13:42.160
a weapon with six shots,

13:42.160 --> 13:44.660
before a very slow and vulnerable reloading animation,

13:44.660 --> 13:47.660
a side quest pits you against seven guys,

13:48.160 --> 13:50.160
and you have to stand still to open the menu,

13:50.160 --> 13:51.660
which doesn't pause the game,

13:51.660 --> 13:53.660
to unequip it to switch to anything else.

13:53.660 --> 13:55.660
It's like the creators are laughing at you,

13:55.660 --> 13:58.160
seeing what deliberately weird, difficult thing

13:58.160 --> 14:01.160
they can put in front of you and have you still actually do.

14:01.160 --> 14:02.660
This whole fight is optional,

14:02.660 --> 14:05.660
so really it's your fault if you decide

14:05.660 --> 14:08.160
to try a dozen times to shoot seven people

14:08.160 --> 14:09.660
with a gun with six chambers.

14:09.660 --> 14:11.660
Remember how I said early quests in games

14:11.660 --> 14:13.160
are like a tutorial?

14:13.160 --> 14:15.160
The lesson of this tutorial is you're gonna die

14:15.160 --> 14:16.660
if you make bad decisions.

14:16.660 --> 14:18.160
Heck, you're still probably gonna die

14:18.160 --> 14:19.660
if you make good decisions.

14:19.660 --> 14:21.660
Fighting is hard and punishing,

14:21.660 --> 14:23.660
especially against more than one person,

14:23.660 --> 14:25.660
and realistically you wouldn't be seeking out

14:25.660 --> 14:26.660
fights like this.

14:26.660 --> 14:29.160
You should be trying not to get killed first.

14:29.160 --> 14:31.660
A two-on-one fight in the first two minutes of the game

14:31.660 --> 14:33.660
before you know all the quirks of its combat

14:33.660 --> 14:35.660
is a death sentence, and the developers know it.

14:35.660 --> 14:38.160
They put this fight in here to teach the player lessons

14:38.160 --> 14:39.660
about how they should be thinking

14:39.660 --> 14:41.660
about the idea of fighting

14:41.660 --> 14:44.160
or on the whole taking unnecessary risks.

14:44.160 --> 14:47.160
Death is cheap and your health is expensive.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.660
I mean that literally, too.

14:48.660 --> 14:50.160
How do you get health back?

14:50.160 --> 14:53.160
Simple, just rest in a bed for a few hours and...

14:53.160 --> 14:54.160
Oh.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.660
No, that does nothing.

14:55.660 --> 14:57.160
Actually, it just made everything worse.

14:57.160 --> 14:58.660
My hunger meter's gone up now.

14:58.660 --> 15:01.160
Okay, I'll eat an egg and...

15:01.160 --> 15:03.660
Oh, no, that's not gonna close my wounds.

15:03.660 --> 15:05.160
It's an egg.

15:05.160 --> 15:07.160
It made my hunger go down,

15:07.160 --> 15:10.160
but wait, it only made it go down a tiny amount,

15:10.160 --> 15:12.660
and that was all the food I could afford.

15:12.660 --> 15:13.660
Oh, I'm fucked.

15:13.660 --> 15:15.160
The only reliable way to heal

15:15.160 --> 15:17.660
is to take a painkiller like Meridorm or Novocaine.

15:17.660 --> 15:19.660
These are expensive, but they cause you to regain health

15:19.660 --> 15:21.660
over the course of a few in-game hours

15:21.660 --> 15:24.160
which is agonizingly slow, but it works.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.160
They also cause a lot of exhaustion

15:26.160 --> 15:28.160
which also raises over time while you're awake

15:28.160 --> 15:30.660
and causes you health damage if it maxes out

15:30.660 --> 15:31.660
just like hunger.

15:31.660 --> 15:34.160
There are items that heal you without any downsides,

15:34.160 --> 15:35.660
tourniquets and bandages,

15:35.660 --> 15:37.160
but they don't heal you that much.

15:37.160 --> 15:38.660
They're pretty hard to acquire,

15:38.660 --> 15:40.160
and they're worth enough money

15:40.160 --> 15:41.660
that you might as well just sell them

15:41.660 --> 15:45.660
and buy some more delicious eggs.

15:45.660 --> 15:48.660
Basically, in this game, taking damage hurts.

15:48.660 --> 15:50.160
After retrying a few times,

15:50.160 --> 15:52.160
if you manage to kill the two people in this fight,

15:52.160 --> 15:54.160
the items they drop are barely worth

15:54.160 --> 15:55.660
the health you lost to get them.

15:55.660 --> 15:57.160
You get a couple of bullets,

15:57.160 --> 15:58.660
like literally a handful,

15:58.660 --> 16:01.160
and you don't even have a gun to use them with yet.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.660
If you used the weapon you started with in the fight,

16:03.660 --> 16:06.160
your scalpel, it's taken durability damage

16:06.160 --> 16:07.660
and is now already less effective,

16:07.660 --> 16:09.660
and you'll have to pay to get that repaired.

16:09.660 --> 16:11.160
Oh, yeah, weapons lose durability

16:11.160 --> 16:12.660
and effectiveness in this game,

16:12.660 --> 16:14.160
and they do it super fast.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.660
This fight is barely worth doing.

16:16.660 --> 16:18.160
When I was playing, I just reloaded

16:18.160 --> 16:20.160
and let the guys get on with whatever they were doing.

16:20.160 --> 16:21.660
They're on the run from the law.

16:21.660 --> 16:23.160
Whatever. They'll be on their way soon.

16:23.160 --> 16:24.660
It's their problem, and they're not interested

16:24.660 --> 16:26.160
in you or Eva anyways.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.160
You can even ask them what the deal is with this guy.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.660
He's just one of the locals.

16:29.660 --> 16:31.160
Some of the people of this culture

16:31.160 --> 16:33.160
are just physically different for some reason.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.660
For me, the canon choice my bachelor made

16:35.660 --> 16:37.160
was to leave these guys alone

16:37.160 --> 16:38.160
and just let them go away.

16:38.160 --> 16:39.660
It's fine. It's not worth it.

16:39.660 --> 16:43.160
This opening is an exercise in disempowerment.

16:43.160 --> 16:45.160
You're not the main character of the story.

16:45.160 --> 16:46.660
I mean, first of all, there's literally two

16:46.660 --> 16:49.160
of the main characters, but on a deeper level,

16:49.160 --> 16:50.660
you're not special,

16:50.660 --> 16:53.160
and sometimes you have to keep your head down to survive.

16:53.160 --> 16:55.160
You are nobody's hero.

16:55.160 --> 16:57.660
Your character's stats page is a really helpful way

16:57.660 --> 16:59.160
of keeping up with all eight

16:59.160 --> 17:01.160
of the chokeholds the game has you in.

17:01.160 --> 17:03.660
Reputation goes down when you start fights,

17:03.660 --> 17:06.660
kill people, or other generally immoral things,

17:06.660 --> 17:08.160
and goes up when you do good things

17:08.160 --> 17:10.160
like in quests or killing muggers

17:10.160 --> 17:11.660
or giving money to the poor

17:11.660 --> 17:13.660
or medicine and alcohol to the sick.

17:13.660 --> 17:16.660
Not to cure them, but to help ease their pain

17:16.660 --> 17:18.160
so they can die in peace.

17:18.160 --> 17:20.660
A pretty morbid way of doing good.

17:20.660 --> 17:23.160
Despite being an RPG where you can get into fights

17:23.160 --> 17:24.660
with anyone you want in the street,

17:24.660 --> 17:26.660
a la Fallout or Elder Scrolls,

17:26.660 --> 17:28.660
the game has a very powerful ability

17:28.660 --> 17:32.160
to strongly incentivize that you don't do whatever you want.

17:32.160 --> 17:33.660
Not only do fights hurt,

17:33.660 --> 17:36.660
but your survival relies on you being accepted by society.

17:36.660 --> 17:38.160
If your reputation is too low,

17:38.160 --> 17:39.660
shopkeepers won't sell to you,

17:39.660 --> 17:42.160
and then you're kind of doomed to starve to death

17:42.160 --> 17:45.160
or to get sick to death or die to death.

17:45.160 --> 17:46.660
Exhaustion just goes up over time

17:46.660 --> 17:48.160
and is reduced by sleeping,

17:48.160 --> 17:50.660
but there are things like raw coffee beans and lemons

17:50.660 --> 17:52.660
which reduce exhaustion and give you more time

17:52.660 --> 17:54.160
to do things other than sleeping,

17:54.160 --> 17:55.660
but lemons increase your hunger

17:55.660 --> 17:57.660
and coffee decreases your health

17:57.660 --> 17:58.660
just like in real life,

17:58.660 --> 18:01.660
but what's immunity and infection?

18:01.660 --> 18:04.660
Well, immunity is your ability to resist the plague.

18:04.660 --> 18:06.660
Kind of? Not really.

18:06.660 --> 18:08.160
When the plague becomes a factor,

18:08.160 --> 18:09.660
if you walk into a cloud of plague

18:09.660 --> 18:11.160
or get touched by a plague carrier

18:11.160 --> 18:13.660
or bitten by a rat, you get the plague.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.660
Your immunity defaults to 50%.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.660
There's expensive medicines you can take

18:18.660 --> 18:20.160
which increase it temporarily,

18:20.160 --> 18:22.160
but these also hurt you to use,

18:22.160 --> 18:23.660
and you have to use quite a few

18:23.660 --> 18:25.660
to raise your meter a useful amount.

18:25.660 --> 18:27.160
If the meter's absurdly high,

18:27.160 --> 18:29.160
and I mean close to 100%,

18:29.160 --> 18:30.660
and you're wearing a couple of clothes

18:30.660 --> 18:32.160
that protect from infection,

18:32.160 --> 18:33.660
if you get hit by the plague,

18:33.660 --> 18:36.660
you might, might not get infected.

18:36.660 --> 18:38.160
It'll just lower your immunity a bunch

18:38.160 --> 18:40.660
so you get infected the next time you touch something.

18:40.660 --> 18:42.660
Hooray!

18:42.660 --> 18:44.660
Hooray!

18:44.660 --> 18:51.660
♪♪

18:51.660 --> 18:53.160
If you get infected,

18:53.160 --> 18:54.660
you start to lose health over time,

18:54.660 --> 18:57.160
and occasionally your camera gets all wobbly and distorted,

18:57.160 --> 18:59.660
and your infection level starts to raise nonstop,

18:59.660 --> 19:01.660
and as it gets higher, the effects will get worse,

19:01.660 --> 19:03.160
and if you get too infected,

19:03.160 --> 19:05.660
some NPCs will try to kill you with fire.

19:05.660 --> 19:08.160
There are antibiotics which decrease your infection level,

19:08.160 --> 19:10.160
but these also hurt you to take

19:10.160 --> 19:11.660
and are also expensive

19:11.660 --> 19:14.660
and don't actually stop the plague once you're infected.

19:14.660 --> 19:16.160
How do you cure the plague?

19:16.160 --> 19:17.660
You can't. Fuck you.

19:17.660 --> 19:19.660
Don't catch the plague, shithead!

19:19.660 --> 19:21.160
That's not really up for discussion, is it?

19:21.160 --> 19:22.660
It's a fucking plague.

19:22.660 --> 19:24.660
Plagues are really bad.

19:24.660 --> 19:28.160
Statistically, in Europe from 1200 to 1800,

19:28.160 --> 19:32.160
roughly 100% of all living people died of the plague.

19:32.160 --> 19:34.660
Okay, there are items that can cure the plague,

19:34.660 --> 19:37.160
but you really want to not be wasting those.

19:37.160 --> 19:39.160
The game's about curing the plague,

19:39.160 --> 19:41.160
so you kind of might want to not use those

19:41.160 --> 19:43.160
on your personal status effects.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.160
If you get infected, either load a save

19:45.160 --> 19:48.160
or prepare to have one extra thing to worry about

19:48.160 --> 19:50.160
for the rest of the entire game.

19:50.160 --> 19:51.660
There's one other important meter

19:51.660 --> 19:53.660
you'll need to keep a close eye on as well.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.160
Time. The clock doesn't wait for you.

19:56.160 --> 19:58.160
Every day has a main quest,

19:58.160 --> 20:00.160
and you have to complete the quest on time

20:00.160 --> 20:03.160
or someone else has to do your job for you,

20:03.160 --> 20:05.160
and they're not as good at your job, so...

20:05.160 --> 20:07.160
The night has come.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.160
The most pressing endeavors of the day

20:09.160 --> 20:11.160
were fulfilled at the expense

20:11.160 --> 20:13.160
of several lives of your bound.

20:13.160 --> 20:15.160
If you don't complete a quest in time,

20:15.160 --> 20:16.660
the story advances without you

20:16.660 --> 20:18.160
and one of your friends gets sick,

20:18.160 --> 20:19.660
which means you won't be able to talk to them

20:19.660 --> 20:21.660
unless you give up some of your medicine at the door

20:21.660 --> 20:23.160
to keep them upright for the day.

20:23.160 --> 20:26.160
Some quest lines take place at certain times, too,

20:26.160 --> 20:28.160
so you need to keep an eye on things and plan ahead.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.660
Between all this and reputation,

20:29.660 --> 20:32.660
the game imposes a horrible feeling of dread on the player,

20:32.660 --> 20:34.660
a pressure that never really lets off.

20:34.660 --> 20:37.160
There are so many things to manage, to think about,

20:37.160 --> 20:38.660
just to stay alive,

20:38.660 --> 20:40.160
and that's not even getting into the story

20:40.160 --> 20:42.160
you're trying to progress while you do all this.

20:42.160 --> 20:43.660
You're always on the clock

20:43.660 --> 20:46.160
and almost always need to be in two places at once,

20:46.160 --> 20:47.660
and as you navigate the town

20:47.660 --> 20:49.660
to get where you're supposed to be going,

20:49.660 --> 20:53.160
you get more and more aware of how slowly you walk.

20:57.160 --> 20:58.660
You can't run.

♪♪

21:00.660 --> 21:03.660
It's just this.

21:03.660 --> 21:04.660
It's horrible.

21:04.660 --> 21:06.660
You're not a character in a fun RPG.

21:06.660 --> 21:08.660
You're a person traveling

21:08.660 --> 21:10.660
at frustratingly person-like speeds

21:10.660 --> 21:13.660
trying to outrun about eight different ways of dying.

21:13.660 --> 21:17.160
This is one of the first truly divisive things about the game.

21:17.160 --> 21:19.160
The walk speed is slow,

21:19.160 --> 21:22.160
and most of the game is about walking from place to place,

21:22.160 --> 21:24.660
walking to buy food, walking to buy medicine,

21:24.660 --> 21:27.160
walking to the trash can to find things to trade,

21:27.160 --> 21:28.660
walking to talk to people,

21:28.660 --> 21:30.660
and walking to the theater to see it predict

21:30.660 --> 21:32.160
all the walking you're gonna do.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.160
Speaking of the theater, every day after midnight,

21:34.160 --> 21:35.660
they rehearse a new play.

21:35.660 --> 21:37.660
These often comment on what happened that day

21:37.660 --> 21:40.160
or predict the future in quite interesting ways.

21:40.160 --> 21:43.160
People only fear bloodshed

21:43.160 --> 21:48.160
when it's their blood and their shed.

21:48.160 --> 21:50.160
Yeah, that's right. Stay out of my shed.

21:50.160 --> 21:51.660
What the fuck are you talking about?

21:51.660 --> 21:53.160
And as the plague spreads,

21:53.160 --> 21:55.160
you start having to either take longer routes

21:55.160 --> 21:57.160
to avoid infected districts

21:57.160 --> 21:59.660
or start risking infection and having to load saves

21:59.660 --> 22:01.660
and lose even more time.

22:01.660 --> 22:05.160
This is not fun or pretty.

22:05.160 --> 22:06.660
It's just walking.

22:06.660 --> 22:09.160
I've had people tell me that walking is what turned them off.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.660
It takes so long to get anywhere.

22:11.660 --> 22:13.660
Even if you're not in immediate danger

22:13.660 --> 22:15.160
because things are going well,

22:15.160 --> 22:17.660
you're still giving up a lot of your time going places,

22:17.660 --> 22:19.660
and the clock is still ticking down,

22:19.660 --> 22:21.660
so you're always racing,

22:21.660 --> 22:23.660
and you're always racing slowly.

22:23.660 --> 22:26.660
But this is also the point of the game in Microcosm.

22:26.660 --> 22:29.160
It's not supposed to be fun on its own.

22:29.160 --> 22:30.660
Here's a head-scratcher.

22:30.660 --> 22:33.160
Are games supposed to be fun?

22:33.160 --> 22:36.660
Maybe, but should they always be?

22:36.660 --> 22:38.660
Is that the only reaction games can

22:38.660 --> 22:41.160
or should explore creating in their players?

22:41.160 --> 22:43.160
Well, I think it's useful to at least experiment.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.160
This boredom isn't a bug.

22:45.160 --> 22:46.660
It's a feature.

22:46.660 --> 22:49.660
It adds even further to this sense of disempowerment.

22:49.660 --> 22:52.160
It also has a profound emotional effect.

22:52.160 --> 22:55.160
As you get increasingly aware of your impending doom

22:55.160 --> 22:58.160
and how limited your abilities to get things done really are,

22:58.160 --> 23:01.160
even walking around becomes tense and stressful.

23:01.160 --> 23:04.160
Pathologic is the subtlest survival horror experience

23:04.160 --> 23:05.660
I've ever played.

23:05.660 --> 23:08.660
The act of standing still in the game makes me nervous.

23:08.660 --> 23:10.160
I'm wasting time.

23:10.160 --> 23:14.660
Oh, shit, it's 3 o'clock. I have to be somewhere.

23:14.660 --> 23:17.160
After a while, even the process of the travel

23:17.160 --> 23:19.160
starts to really get its hooks in you.

23:19.160 --> 23:21.660
Once you get used to it, there's nothing quite like it.

23:21.660 --> 23:24.160
As the story deepens and becomes more complex,

23:24.160 --> 23:25.660
the travel becomes an opportunity

23:25.660 --> 23:27.160
to think about what's happening.

23:27.160 --> 23:28.660
If you're being played,

23:28.660 --> 23:30.160
why you're being asked to do this,

23:30.160 --> 23:31.660
who it really benefits,

23:31.660 --> 23:34.160
whether someone's messing you around to waste your time

23:34.160 --> 23:36.160
and stop you figuring out what's really going on.

23:36.160 --> 23:39.160
The walking becomes the most engaging thing in the world.

23:39.160 --> 23:41.660
I've never been more alone with my own thoughts

23:41.660 --> 23:43.160
than when I was playing Pathologic.

23:43.160 --> 23:46.160
I'm one of the two remaining defenders of No Man's Sky.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.160
The others were lost in the Great Purge,

23:48.160 --> 23:50.160
but when it came out, I liked it at the time

23:50.160 --> 23:52.160
almost primarily because it came closer

23:52.160 --> 23:54.160
than any other game to doing this.

23:54.160 --> 23:55.660
In fact, I made a reference to Pathologic

23:55.660 --> 23:57.660
in my little video about it, but in reality,

23:57.660 --> 24:00.160
Pathologic is still the absolute greatest of this

24:00.160 --> 24:01.660
and puts No Man's Sky to shame,

24:01.660 --> 24:03.160
especially when all the patches made it

24:03.160 --> 24:04.660
much more like what everyone else wanted

24:04.660 --> 24:06.660
and much less like what I had enjoyed.

24:06.660 --> 24:08.660
Man, I should revisit that game.

24:08.660 --> 24:10.160
Imagine a game holding your attention

24:10.160 --> 24:12.660
not because anything in particular is happening

24:12.660 --> 24:15.160
but entirely because it's got inside your head.

24:15.160 --> 24:16.660
Oh, and then, just to make sure you're paying attention,

24:16.660 --> 24:18.660
a plague cloud made of screaming skulls

24:18.660 --> 24:19.660
flies at you and you go,

24:19.660 --> 24:20.660
AHH!

24:22.660 --> 24:25.160
The constant racing against the multitudinous clocks

24:25.160 --> 24:27.660
of time, exhaustion, and hunger,

24:27.660 --> 24:29.660
trying to get enough surplus stuff done

24:29.660 --> 24:31.160
to afford to manage it all,

24:31.160 --> 24:33.660
and the many ways you can be killed easily or survive

24:33.660 --> 24:35.660
but with the game made even harder

24:35.660 --> 24:38.660
by taking damage or losing time or getting infected

24:38.660 --> 24:40.660
or getting so desperate you decide to kill a guy

24:40.660 --> 24:42.160
in a dark alley for his food

24:42.160 --> 24:45.160
is the exact opposite of a heroic fantasy story.

24:45.160 --> 24:48.160
At all times, the player feels powerless.

24:48.160 --> 24:50.160
Instead of the player being free,

24:50.160 --> 24:52.160
but with some survival mechanics to keep track of,

24:52.160 --> 24:53.160
it's flipped.

24:53.160 --> 24:55.160
The game is a large collection of things

24:55.160 --> 24:57.660
that will kill you unless you submit yourself

24:57.660 --> 24:58.660
to their whims.

24:58.660 --> 25:00.660
You're free, but you should be doing

25:00.660 --> 25:03.160
what you're supposed to be doing or you'll fail and die.

25:03.160 --> 25:05.160
You're placed under a level of constant stress

25:05.160 --> 25:08.160
maintaining your frail body while racing against time

25:08.160 --> 25:10.160
to actually get anything else done.

25:10.160 --> 25:12.660
You're always technically in control,

25:12.660 --> 25:14.660
but it's hard not to avoid the feeling

25:14.660 --> 25:17.160
that you're the one being played by the game,

25:17.160 --> 25:19.160
constantly reminded of all the things

25:19.160 --> 25:20.660
you don't have time to do,

25:20.660 --> 25:22.160
all the things you need to avoid,

25:22.160 --> 25:24.160
and worrying maybe the game's gonna come up

25:24.160 --> 25:26.660
with something new to stab you with on the next day,

25:26.660 --> 25:28.660
which, uh...

25:28.660 --> 25:31.660
Part 2.2, day two.

25:31.660 --> 25:35.160
I came up with the titles in this video to amuse myself.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.660
I don't really care what you think about them.

25:36.660 --> 25:39.160
Day one is kind of a walk in the park.

25:39.160 --> 25:41.160
You even have enough leeway to take a walk

25:41.160 --> 25:42.160
in some of the parks.

25:42.160 --> 25:44.160
You get used to the basic mechanics,

25:44.160 --> 25:46.660
buy and eat some food, progress the story a little,

25:46.660 --> 25:48.160
and meet some of the other characters,

25:48.160 --> 25:49.660
and at the end you realize that a plague

25:49.660 --> 25:51.160
might be about to hit.

25:51.160 --> 25:53.660
If you manage to survive day one and complete the quest,

25:53.660 --> 25:54.660
well, congratulations.

25:54.660 --> 25:56.160
You've done better than most players,

25:56.160 --> 25:58.160
but the real game hasn't started yet.

25:58.160 --> 26:00.660
Day two is the next big hurdle,

26:00.660 --> 26:02.660
and even less people make it past that.

26:02.660 --> 26:05.160
The Bachelor's day two is where players will decide

26:05.160 --> 26:06.660
if this game is for them or not,

26:06.660 --> 26:08.160
and the drop-offs in terms of achievements

26:08.160 --> 26:09.660
demonstrate this pretty well.

26:09.660 --> 26:11.660
You'll know if the game is something you're going

26:11.660 --> 26:13.660
to try to continue with after this,

26:13.660 --> 26:15.160
so you make it to bed on time

26:15.160 --> 26:16.660
with a decent amount of money prepared

26:16.660 --> 26:18.160
in case you need to buy more things

26:18.160 --> 26:20.160
and with all your meters sufficiently handled.

26:20.160 --> 26:22.160
Maybe everyone's warnings about how hard this game is

26:22.160 --> 26:23.660
were sufficient to prepare you,

26:23.660 --> 26:25.160
and you've got this in the bag now.

26:25.160 --> 26:27.160
♪ ♪

26:27.160 --> 26:30.660
On the morning of day two, prices rise tenfold.

26:30.660 --> 26:32.160
The money you started the game with

26:32.160 --> 26:36.160
is no longer enough to buy a single delicious egg.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.160
The plague hasn't properly hit yet,

26:38.160 --> 26:40.160
but word's got out there's an outbreak coming

26:40.160 --> 26:42.660
and people are stockpiling food and medicine.

26:42.660 --> 26:44.660
Not only is being able to afford food

26:44.660 --> 26:47.660
suddenly a much more pressing question than you expected,

26:47.660 --> 26:49.160
any food you do have on you

26:49.160 --> 26:51.160
doesn't seem like a good idea to eat.

26:51.160 --> 26:53.660
I mean, that's a lot of money you're holding.

26:53.660 --> 26:55.160
To make matters worse,

26:55.160 --> 26:56.660
the town's governor, Alexander Saburov,

26:56.660 --> 26:58.660
won't agree to do anything about the plague

26:58.660 --> 27:00.660
because he'll be seen to be overstepping the mark

27:00.660 --> 27:02.160
if the other rulers of the town

27:02.160 --> 27:03.660
don't agree on there being one.

27:03.660 --> 27:05.160
So a plague is starting,

27:05.160 --> 27:07.660
but no one with the power to take proper action

27:07.660 --> 27:10.160
will help because everyone has their own agenda.

27:10.160 --> 27:11.660
So you spend a good deal of the day

27:11.660 --> 27:13.160
with your hunger rising

27:13.160 --> 27:14.660
and no sure way to solve it

27:14.660 --> 27:16.160
because your money is worthless now

27:16.160 --> 27:18.160
running around trying to find enough proof

27:18.160 --> 27:19.660
to get all three of these groups

27:19.660 --> 27:21.160
to agree there is a plague

27:21.160 --> 27:22.660
and to give Saburov the power

27:22.660 --> 27:24.160
to start making emergency orders.

27:24.160 --> 27:27.160
Your main quest is getting these warring factions

27:27.160 --> 27:30.160
to agree that the obvious problem exists.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.660
Along the way, you pick up two side quests.

27:32.660 --> 27:35.160
In one of them, you meet up with a former buddy of yours,

27:35.160 --> 27:36.660
Andrei Stamatin, and upon agreeing

27:36.660 --> 27:39.160
that the shits hit the fan, or rather the town,

27:39.160 --> 27:41.160
you decide to get out while you can,

27:41.160 --> 27:43.160
but Andrei won't leave without his brother Peter

27:43.160 --> 27:44.660
who doesn't want to leave that much,

27:44.660 --> 27:47.160
but Saburov, the guy who will get emergency powers

27:47.160 --> 27:49.160
anytime soon, bears a long-standing grudge

27:49.160 --> 27:51.160
against Peter which will probably lead

27:51.160 --> 27:53.160
to him getting killed once that happens.

27:53.160 --> 27:54.660
And this isn't unfounded, by the way.

27:54.660 --> 27:57.660
When Saburov does get emergency powers later in the game,

27:57.660 --> 28:00.160
he uses them to try to get Peter killed.

28:00.160 --> 28:02.160
So you need to get proof this is the case

28:02.160 --> 28:03.660
to get Peter to agree to leave with you both,

28:03.660 --> 28:05.160
which you get from talking to Maria Kane,

28:05.160 --> 28:07.160
Simon's niece, about this issue.

28:07.160 --> 28:10.160
However, if you tell her why you need to know this,

28:10.160 --> 28:12.160
she intervenes and prevents either of them

28:12.160 --> 28:14.160
from leaving, failing the quest.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.660
Unbeknownst to you, Maria needs these guys

28:16.660 --> 28:19.660
in the town for her own reasons, so don't do that.

28:19.660 --> 28:21.160
So you go to give this information to Peter.

28:21.160 --> 28:22.660
Ah, fuck!

28:22.660 --> 28:24.160
This is an actual recording

28:24.160 --> 28:25.660
of the first time I saw this statue.

28:25.660 --> 28:27.660
You can see in the footage that I freeze up.

28:27.660 --> 28:29.160
Like, it's terrifying.

28:29.160 --> 28:31.660
This is the second game ever to jump scare me

28:31.660 --> 28:33.660
with a fucking still object.

28:33.660 --> 28:35.160
It's genius.

28:35.160 --> 28:36.660
I can't wait to show you the other one sometime.

28:36.660 --> 28:38.160
That one's great, too.

28:38.160 --> 28:39.660
You know which one I'm talking about.

28:39.660 --> 28:42.160
You all agree to meet at the train station at 10 p.m.,

28:42.160 --> 28:44.160
so you're starving and the town sucks,

28:44.160 --> 28:46.160
but at least you have an escape plan now.

28:46.160 --> 28:47.660
The second side quest is called

28:47.660 --> 28:49.160
The House of the Living.

28:49.160 --> 28:50.660
Several of the town's more charitable people

28:50.660 --> 28:52.160
have decided to establish a shelter

28:52.160 --> 28:53.660
for when the epidemic hits,

28:53.660 --> 28:55.160
and they each give you money to buy some food

28:55.160 --> 28:58.160
for the shelter before the prices rise any further.

28:58.160 --> 29:00.160
I will make the purchases.

29:00.160 --> 29:05.160
I have to do a lot of walking today anyway.

29:05.160 --> 29:08.160
Ah.

29:08.160 --> 29:09.660
The money they give you is not enough

29:09.660 --> 29:11.160
to buy all the food they want,

29:11.160 --> 29:14.160
so you actually have to use whatever spare money you have

29:14.160 --> 29:16.160
or sell some of your items to afford this.

29:16.160 --> 29:18.160
You give up all your remaining money

29:18.160 --> 29:21.160
and items to get food you also need

29:21.160 --> 29:22.660
just to give it away,

29:22.660 --> 29:24.660
and you have to watch your hunger go up

29:24.660 --> 29:27.160
and your time go down as you rush around

29:27.160 --> 29:29.660
trying to find the stores with any bread or meat left.

29:29.660 --> 29:31.160
When you get it all,

29:31.160 --> 29:32.660
you're told the location of the shelter

29:32.660 --> 29:34.160
so you can deliver it.

29:34.160 --> 29:35.660
Let's just break this down.

29:35.660 --> 29:39.660
Part of a quest on a day when food is incredibly scarce

29:39.660 --> 29:42.660
involves carrying a ton of food somewhere

29:42.660 --> 29:44.160
and not eating it.

29:44.160 --> 29:46.660
It's actual torture running around

29:46.660 --> 29:48.160
watching that hunger meter go up

29:48.160 --> 29:50.660
and not knowing how you're going to resolve it

29:50.660 --> 29:52.660
even though you're technically holding a solution

29:52.660 --> 29:54.160
the whole time.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.160
It's awkward and engaging and tense

29:56.160 --> 29:59.660
in a way that no game has achieved before or since.

29:59.660 --> 30:01.660
The game doesn't punish you for eating it either.

30:01.660 --> 30:03.160
You don't have to do this quest.

30:03.160 --> 30:04.660
You can just keep the food

30:04.660 --> 30:06.660
or the money you were given to buy it with

30:06.660 --> 30:09.160
and just ruin the chance to build the shelter,

30:09.160 --> 30:12.160
but you don't because that's hardly what a doctor

30:12.160 --> 30:13.660
would do preparing for the plague,

30:13.660 --> 30:15.660
and maybe there's a reward for doing it

30:15.660 --> 30:17.160
or it helps you further down the line.

30:17.160 --> 30:19.160
You're making a positive moral choice

30:19.160 --> 30:20.660
on a quest in a video game.

30:20.660 --> 30:22.160
You know how this works.

30:22.160 --> 30:23.660
There's something in it for you.

30:23.660 --> 30:26.160
So you go to deliver the food.

30:26.160 --> 30:38.160
♪♪

30:38.160 --> 30:40.660
The house has already been hit by the plague.

30:40.660 --> 30:42.660
Everyone there is sick and dying,

30:42.660 --> 30:45.160
and the plague clouds will actively hunt you

30:45.160 --> 30:47.160
through the house if you stay too long.

30:47.160 --> 30:48.660
There's an executor there who tells you

30:48.660 --> 30:50.660
this mission was obviously a failure,

30:50.660 --> 30:52.660
so you leave and go back to the quest giver

30:52.660 --> 30:55.160
and give her all the food intended for the shelter.

30:55.160 --> 30:57.660
She gives you some nuts to tide you over

30:57.660 --> 30:59.160
as thanks for your hard work.

30:59.160 --> 31:01.160
The reward for successfully following this quest

31:01.160 --> 31:03.660
to the end is dramatically worse

31:03.660 --> 31:06.660
than the money or food you could have just run away with.

31:06.660 --> 31:08.660
At the very least, this quest results

31:08.660 --> 31:10.160
in finding proof of the plague,

31:10.160 --> 31:12.160
so the part of the main quest where you go in search

31:12.160 --> 31:15.160
of a plague-ridden house is at least solved by this too.

31:15.160 --> 31:17.160
If you do the main quest instead, though,

31:17.160 --> 31:19.160
you get a genuinely terrifying encounter

31:19.160 --> 31:21.660
where as soon as you realize you've found a house

31:21.660 --> 31:23.660
filled with women who have the plague,

31:23.660 --> 31:26.160
once you try to leave, it spawns two more

31:26.160 --> 31:27.660
right where you just came from,

31:27.660 --> 31:29.660
and they try to grab you to appeal for help

31:29.660 --> 31:31.660
and give you the plague if they do,

31:31.660 --> 31:33.660
and you just have to dodge past them.

31:33.660 --> 31:37.160
It's genuinely super scary and just emotionally awful.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.160
You're just abandoning these women to die.

31:39.160 --> 31:41.660
It's a horrible nightmare which, thankfully,

31:41.660 --> 31:44.160
you cannot do if you did the house of the living.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.160
Finally, Saburov has the power he needs

31:46.160 --> 31:48.660
to start establishing hospitals under quarantine,

31:48.660 --> 31:51.160
rationing food, distributing medicine, and so on,

31:51.160 --> 31:53.160
and he even gives you a gun,

31:53.160 --> 31:55.160
so it's a day late, but things are finally

31:55.160 --> 31:56.660
where they should have been already,

31:56.660 --> 31:59.160
perhaps too late to prevent a full-on outbreak,

31:59.160 --> 32:01.160
but better than nothing at all.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.660
You can defend yourself a little better now at least.

32:03.660 --> 32:05.660
Luckily, you're getting out of here soon,

32:05.660 --> 32:07.160
so 10 p.m. rolls around.

32:07.160 --> 32:09.160
Your quests have been one major failure

32:09.160 --> 32:11.660
and one minor resolution to a power squabble

32:11.660 --> 32:13.660
that you're sure will heat up again tomorrow,

32:13.660 --> 32:15.660
and you haven't eaten anything,

32:15.660 --> 32:17.660
so you head to the train station.

32:17.660 --> 32:20.660
When you get there, you find guards blocking the trains.

32:20.660 --> 32:22.660
The Somatin brothers are nowhere to be seen.

32:22.660 --> 32:25.160
They just didn't show up, and according to the guards,

32:25.160 --> 32:27.160
no one can enter or leave the town now

32:27.160 --> 32:30.160
because it's under quarantine thanks to the emergency powers

32:30.160 --> 32:32.160
you helped Saburov get.

32:32.160 --> 32:35.660
You just trapped yourself in the town.

32:35.660 --> 32:37.160
If you try to talk your way out,

32:37.160 --> 32:38.660
all the guards attack you,

32:38.660 --> 32:40.160
and you lose reputation for killing them

32:40.160 --> 32:42.160
because these guys were just doing their job.

32:42.160 --> 32:45.660
Best of all, there's an executor standing there.

32:45.660 --> 32:47.160
This one doesn't say anything

32:47.160 --> 32:50.160
and seemingly can't be seen by the other characters.

32:50.160 --> 32:52.160
He just stares at you, letting you know

32:52.160 --> 32:54.660
he knows how dramatic the irony is,

32:54.660 --> 32:57.660
laughing at you for thinking you can just leave the town.

32:57.660 --> 33:00.660
So you're trapped, and you're starving.

33:00.660 --> 33:02.660
In the middle of the night, you go to see a play

33:02.660 --> 33:04.160
being rehearsed at the theater.

33:04.160 --> 33:06.160
The play's about how you're fucked.

33:06.160 --> 33:08.160
Bad news.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.660
The governor will abuse his power.

33:10.660 --> 33:13.660
When the morning hits, the game nonchalantly says,

33:13.660 --> 33:16.160
it all ends in less than ten days.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.160
Exhausted from a day's being a pawn

33:18.160 --> 33:21.160
in someone else's power grab and scrambling for resources

33:21.160 --> 33:24.160
for a quest that was doomed and starving half to death,

33:24.160 --> 33:26.160
you eat one of the nuts.

33:26.160 --> 33:29.160
♪♪

33:29.160 --> 33:31.660
Great. You're completely fucked,

33:31.660 --> 33:33.160
and you're on day three.

33:33.160 --> 33:36.160
Day two is excellent game design.

33:36.160 --> 33:37.660
It's deeply engaging.

33:37.660 --> 33:39.660
Watching your attempts to get anything at all done

33:39.660 --> 33:41.160
get frustrated,

33:41.160 --> 33:43.160
and it also sets a general tone for the game.

33:43.160 --> 33:45.160
It does the special game design trick

33:45.160 --> 33:47.660
that I like to call recontextualizing.

33:47.660 --> 33:49.660
Players come to games with their own expectations

33:49.660 --> 33:52.160
and understandings of how a game is supposed to work

33:52.160 --> 33:53.660
and feel and play,

33:53.660 --> 33:55.660
a certain general set of ideas

33:55.660 --> 33:57.660
about what all this is supposed to be like.

33:57.660 --> 33:59.660
If you're playing an open world RPG,

33:59.660 --> 34:02.160
you know what dialogue trees, shops,

34:02.160 --> 34:04.160
and trading and hunger and time mechanics

34:04.160 --> 34:05.660
and moral choices are,

34:05.660 --> 34:08.160
and you think you know how they work.

34:08.160 --> 34:10.160
Day one partially plays into this.

34:10.160 --> 34:12.660
It takes pains to show how fragile you are

34:12.660 --> 34:14.660
and all the work you have to do to not die,

34:14.660 --> 34:17.160
but it's doable. It makes sense.

34:17.160 --> 34:20.160
It doesn't feel that much different from a normal game.

34:20.160 --> 34:22.160
When the prices rise so massively

34:22.160 --> 34:24.160
that money is effectively worthless

34:24.160 --> 34:26.160
and you were given no warning this would happen,

34:26.160 --> 34:29.160
everything about how you relate to the game experience

34:29.160 --> 34:30.660
is thrown out the window,

34:30.660 --> 34:32.660
and you feel that happening in your brain

34:32.660 --> 34:35.160
as you play and realize what just happened.

34:35.160 --> 34:37.660
Walking around while slowly starving,

34:37.660 --> 34:39.660
getting rid of the rest of your own items

34:39.660 --> 34:42.160
to try to get the food for a doomed quest,

34:42.160 --> 34:44.660
carrying food you can't eat around,

34:44.660 --> 34:47.160
and wondering when you will get to eat,

34:47.160 --> 34:49.660
and watching your meters inevitably rise

34:49.660 --> 34:51.160
as you race to help the town

34:51.160 --> 34:53.660
and only barely achieve anything,

34:53.660 --> 34:55.660
you start to make realizations

34:55.660 --> 34:57.660
about the scope of this experience.

34:57.660 --> 35:00.160
You weren't playing a game with the mechanic

35:00.160 --> 35:02.660
where you have the option of using money to buy things.

35:02.660 --> 35:06.660
You were playing a game about having no money.

35:06.660 --> 35:08.160
You weren't playing a game where you have

35:08.160 --> 35:09.660
to eat food to survive.

35:09.660 --> 35:12.660
You were playing a game about starving.

35:12.660 --> 35:14.660
You weren't playing a game where you can choose

35:14.660 --> 35:16.160
what sort of morals you have.

35:16.160 --> 35:18.160
You were playing a game about how betraying

35:18.160 --> 35:20.160
the people who trust you is better for you

35:20.160 --> 35:22.660
than trying to be a hero, and doing the right thing

35:22.660 --> 35:24.160
is an exercise in getting your time

35:24.160 --> 35:26.160
and energy and money wasted.

35:26.160 --> 35:29.660
Survival horror RPG? Lies.

35:29.660 --> 35:32.660
You are playing a pain simulator.

35:32.660 --> 35:34.660
This is a deeply masterful trick

35:34.660 --> 35:36.660
I've seen very few developers pull,

35:36.660 --> 35:38.660
where commonly understood mechanics

35:38.660 --> 35:41.660
are twisted in such a fashion as to force the player

35:41.660 --> 35:44.160
into a specific mindset and relationship

35:44.160 --> 35:45.660
with those mechanics,

35:45.660 --> 35:48.160
and everything straightforward suddenly becomes

35:48.160 --> 35:49.660
different and off.

35:49.660 --> 35:51.160
Once day two happens,

35:51.160 --> 35:53.660
you no longer have any idea what's coming.

35:53.660 --> 35:56.160
Money turning out to be virtually useless?

35:56.160 --> 35:58.160
The growing threat of the plague?

35:58.160 --> 36:01.160
Who knows how bad things will get in the next few days?

36:01.160 --> 36:03.660
Even though the game doesn't get that much harder,

36:03.660 --> 36:05.160
and technically the game isn't that hard

36:05.160 --> 36:06.660
if you know what you're doing,

36:06.660 --> 36:09.160
this sequence of experiences fills you with dread

36:09.160 --> 36:10.660
for what might happen next,

36:10.660 --> 36:12.660
and the game doesn't stay this difficult forever.

36:12.660 --> 36:15.160
The point isn't how hard the game actually is

36:15.160 --> 36:17.160
if you measure it objectively.

36:17.160 --> 36:20.160
The point here is how the game makes you engage with it.

36:20.160 --> 36:23.160
The game has a reputation of being depressingly punishing

36:23.160 --> 36:26.160
and difficult, and while all this is true in places,

36:26.160 --> 36:28.160
and it does get very hard in brief bursts,

36:28.160 --> 36:31.160
the fact the game manages to create this reputation

36:31.160 --> 36:32.660
without always being that hard

36:32.660 --> 36:35.160
is a serious credit to its execution.

36:35.160 --> 36:37.660
Day two grinds you beneath its heel,

36:37.660 --> 36:39.160
and even if things pick up for you

36:39.160 --> 36:41.160
or you master the art of stabbing bad men

36:41.160 --> 36:42.660
for extra cash,

36:42.660 --> 36:45.160
you'll never really feel in control again,

36:45.160 --> 36:47.160
and that is genius design.

36:47.160 --> 36:49.660
One of the ways you can make surviving slightly easier

36:49.660 --> 36:51.660
is to sell your gun.

36:51.660 --> 36:53.660
The gun you just got is worth a lot of money,

36:53.660 --> 36:55.660
and so are bullets, which might be good

36:55.660 --> 36:57.660
for solving some of the more pressing issues of the game.

36:57.660 --> 36:59.160
You don't get in that many fights,

36:59.160 --> 37:00.660
especially if you're avoiding them,

37:00.660 --> 37:02.160
but being put in a position

37:02.160 --> 37:03.660
where the best chance of survival

37:03.660 --> 37:05.160
is getting rid of one of the main things

37:05.160 --> 37:07.160
a first-person shooter is known for,

37:07.160 --> 37:09.660
it's even in the name, that's a notable thing.

37:09.660 --> 37:12.160
Almost everyone I know who made it this far

37:12.160 --> 37:13.660
sold their first gun,

37:13.660 --> 37:16.160
allowed themselves to remain vulnerable

37:16.160 --> 37:18.660
for the chance to maybe not die of something else.

37:18.660 --> 37:21.160
You can also learn to hold on to certain objects

37:21.160 --> 37:22.660
to trade for better things.

37:22.660 --> 37:24.660
In trash cans, you can find all kinds of stuff.

37:24.660 --> 37:26.160
Sometimes people throw out jewelry

37:26.160 --> 37:27.660
or needles or empty bottles,

37:27.660 --> 37:29.660
which you can refill with water for free

37:29.660 --> 37:32.160
and drink to reduce hunger and increase exhaustion

37:32.160 --> 37:34.660
or save up to trade for bandages with the town drunks.

37:34.660 --> 37:36.660
The children in the town will trade flowers

37:36.660 --> 37:39.160
or nuts or blades for various useful things

37:39.160 --> 37:40.660
like medicine and bullets,

37:40.660 --> 37:42.660
so the nuts you got were useful.

37:42.660 --> 37:44.660
You just might not have learned their value,

37:44.660 --> 37:47.160
and this is another bigly clever thing the game does.

37:47.160 --> 37:49.160
The economy isn't as simple as

37:49.160 --> 37:51.660
I give you money and you give me my delicious egg.

37:51.660 --> 37:53.660
It's a web of needs and wants

37:53.660 --> 37:55.160
from a variety of NPCs

37:55.160 --> 37:58.660
which informs the value of myriad different items

37:58.660 --> 38:01.160
which you can benefit from if you pay attention and learn.

38:01.160 --> 38:03.660
The game never hands any of this to you,

38:03.660 --> 38:05.660
and that makes discovering and using these things

38:05.660 --> 38:08.160
feel good, like you've worked it out

38:08.160 --> 38:09.660
and solved something.

38:09.660 --> 38:12.160
One type of child in the town, this little girl,

38:12.160 --> 38:14.160
sometimes, very rarely,

38:14.160 --> 38:16.660
has an item on her called Shmowda.

38:16.660 --> 38:19.160
They're expensive to trade for, but they're worth it.

38:19.160 --> 38:21.660
If you use it, it reduces your health to almost nothing,

38:21.660 --> 38:23.660
but it cures the plague.

38:23.660 --> 38:25.660
There's a very limited amount of real cures

38:25.660 --> 38:27.160
available throughout the story,

38:27.160 --> 38:29.660
so getting your hands on some of these is a real help.

38:29.660 --> 38:32.660
Even if their downsides are too much for you to risk using,

38:32.660 --> 38:34.660
other people will pay thousands and thousands

38:34.660 --> 38:37.160
of rubles for them, almost $50 worth,

38:37.160 --> 38:38.160
and hey, maybe some of your friends

38:38.160 --> 38:40.160
might need curing later. Just saying.

38:40.160 --> 38:42.160
This all works in the context of the story too.

38:42.160 --> 38:44.160
The Bachelor is in a foreign town

38:44.160 --> 38:46.160
whose customs aren't like the ones he's used to,

38:46.160 --> 38:48.160
and so are you, and all this tension

38:48.160 --> 38:50.160
and storytelling happens largely

38:50.160 --> 38:52.660
while you're just walking from place to place in a town.

38:52.660 --> 38:54.160
It's quite an experience,

38:54.160 --> 38:56.660
and this experience is enhanced by the game's music,

38:56.660 --> 38:58.660
which is some of the best in the business.

38:58.660 --> 39:00.660
It takes a front seat during a lot of the walking,

39:00.660 --> 39:03.160
and it does excellently with that spotlight.

39:03.160 --> 39:11.160
♪ ♪

39:11.160 --> 39:13.660
It's intensely atmospheric and moody,

39:13.660 --> 39:16.160
and when it needs to be, it's strange and unsettling.

39:16.160 --> 39:26.660
♪ ♪

39:26.660 --> 39:29.160
It feels, at the same time, natural and alien,

39:29.160 --> 39:30.660
like you're witnessing a normality

39:30.660 --> 39:32.660
that isn't familiar to you personally.

39:32.660 --> 39:41.660
♪ ♪

39:41.660 --> 39:45.160
Synths are used alongside more naturalistic drums and rhythms

39:45.160 --> 39:47.160
to further destabilize the setting.

39:47.160 --> 39:49.160
The music even evolves with the story.

39:49.160 --> 39:51.160
Each main region of the town has a theme,

39:51.160 --> 39:53.160
and when that area gets infected,

39:53.160 --> 39:57.160
its theme changes and becomes even more strange and distorted.

39:57.160 --> 40:06.160
♪ ♪

40:06.160 --> 40:08.660
On top of the slightly remixed original music,

40:08.660 --> 40:11.660
you can now hear a distant and frenzied chanting.

40:11.660 --> 40:13.660
It's great, and some of the tracks

40:13.660 --> 40:16.160
sound subtly different for different characters,

40:16.160 --> 40:17.160
which is awesome.

40:17.160 --> 40:19.660
The opening theme is a real banger, too.

40:19.660 --> 40:28.660
♪ ♪

40:28.660 --> 40:31.160
Except it sounds oddly familiar.

40:31.160 --> 40:33.660
I can't quite put my finger on it.

40:33.660 --> 40:34.660
Oh.

40:34.660 --> 40:36.660
♪ ♪

40:36.660 --> 40:37.660
Aw, damn it!

40:37.660 --> 40:39.660
Part three, the writing.

40:39.660 --> 40:42.660
By now, if you've been pausing to read the text for some reason,

40:42.660 --> 40:45.660
you'll be very aware of how strange the writing is,

40:45.660 --> 40:47.660
and whenever you begin dialogue with someone,

40:47.660 --> 40:49.660
they actually say something out loud.

40:49.660 --> 40:53.160
When we do not find peace of mind in ourselves,

40:53.160 --> 40:55.660
it is useless to seek it elsewhere.

40:55.660 --> 40:58.160
Truth does not do as much good in the world

40:58.160 --> 41:00.660
as the appearance of truth does evil.

41:00.660 --> 41:02.160
Oh, wow, that's a good quote.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.660
I'm gonna use that in a future video

41:03.660 --> 41:05.160
and pretend a philosopher said it.

41:05.160 --> 41:06.160
Watch out for that.

41:06.160 --> 41:08.660
Everyone's very wordy and flowery,

41:08.660 --> 41:10.660
talking about their dreams and visions,

41:10.660 --> 41:13.160
and sometimes it's hard to tell if you're discussing philosophy

41:13.160 --> 41:14.660
instead of the task at hand.

41:14.660 --> 41:16.660
The game has a very specific writing style,

41:16.660 --> 41:18.660
one more evocative of your typical novel

41:18.660 --> 41:19.660
than other games,

41:19.660 --> 41:21.660
and it is, in my opinion, very well written.

41:21.660 --> 41:24.660
It succeeds in making you feel transported to a world

41:24.660 --> 41:26.660
where things aren't as simple as they seem,

41:26.660 --> 41:29.660
where dream and metaphor are entangled with reality.

41:29.660 --> 41:31.660
If a sentence feels strange or hard to follow,

41:31.660 --> 41:34.660
it's doing that on purpose to make you feel weird,

41:34.660 --> 41:36.660
like you have to put effort into understanding.

41:36.660 --> 41:38.660
Instead of simply telling you you're a small part

41:38.660 --> 41:39.660
of a strange universe,

41:39.660 --> 41:40.660
it makes you feel that way

41:40.660 --> 41:42.660
by refusing to pull its punches

41:42.660 --> 41:44.160
with the ideas it's meditating on.

41:44.160 --> 41:45.660
Try this on for size.

41:45.660 --> 41:48.160
Do you believe in prophecies, Andres de Matin?

41:48.160 --> 41:48.660
It depends.

41:48.660 --> 41:51.160
I agree this may seem inconsistent with materialism.

41:51.160 --> 41:51.660
On the other hand,

41:51.660 --> 41:54.160
when your own experience convinces you to their effectiveness,

41:54.160 --> 41:55.660
you have to take them into account.

41:55.660 --> 41:57.160
I wonder that myself.

41:57.160 --> 41:58.660
For a moment, I thought he was driven

41:58.660 --> 42:00.160
by the same feeling that I am.

42:00.160 --> 42:02.660
A great man, when unexpectedly betrayed

42:02.660 --> 42:03.660
by the people he loves,

42:03.660 --> 42:05.660
will often seek to fill the whole universe

42:05.660 --> 42:06.660
with his blind spite.

42:06.660 --> 42:09.160
Yes, the feeling is indeed familiar.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.660
No one talks out loud like this in real life,

42:11.660 --> 42:12.660
but that's not a mistake.

42:12.660 --> 42:13.660
It's part of the point.

42:13.660 --> 42:16.660
You're stuck in a world where people do talk like that

42:16.660 --> 42:18.660
and have to untangle it to make sense of things.

42:18.660 --> 42:20.660
It's very hard to call this game pretentious

42:20.660 --> 42:22.660
because not only does pretentious mean

42:22.660 --> 42:25.660
affecting a greater importance than is actually possessed,

42:25.660 --> 42:27.660
and the game definitely does say important things,

42:27.660 --> 42:30.660
but it's also too self-aware about how all this looks,

42:30.660 --> 42:32.660
and it loves to make fun of itself.

42:32.660 --> 42:34.160
The plays make fun of the characters

42:34.160 --> 42:35.660
and plot and writing style.

42:35.660 --> 42:37.660
The cool fourth-wall-breaking executors

42:37.660 --> 42:39.660
complain about how unwieldy their outfits are.

42:39.660 --> 42:40.660
It's lovely stuff.

42:40.660 --> 42:42.660
While this video is definitely going to spoil

42:42.660 --> 42:43.660
lots of the plot,

42:43.660 --> 42:45.160
there's lots of really interesting aspects

42:45.160 --> 42:46.660
I won't have time to go into detail about.

42:46.660 --> 42:48.660
If you want a more complete breakdown

42:48.660 --> 42:50.660
and analysis of the three characters' stories,

42:50.660 --> 42:52.660
YouTuber Sulmatul made a great video doing so

42:52.660 --> 42:54.160
linked in the description.

42:54.160 --> 42:56.660
There's such a ridiculous amount of depth and complexity

42:56.660 --> 42:58.160
that it still astounds me now,

42:58.160 --> 43:00.660
and even trying to cover all of it is beyond my powers.

43:00.660 --> 43:02.660
When I was talking about this with Mandalore Gaming,

43:02.660 --> 43:05.160
whose video on Pathologic is also really worth checking out,

43:05.160 --> 43:07.160
he offhand mentioned an entire aspect

43:07.160 --> 43:09.660
of one of the characters I'd completely forgotten about

43:09.660 --> 43:11.160
and isn't even in Sul's video either.

43:11.160 --> 43:13.160
This game is about as dense with story

43:13.160 --> 43:15.160
as a real novel with an equivalent amount

43:15.160 --> 43:16.160
of words to read.

43:16.160 --> 43:17.660
Obviously, really getting across

43:17.660 --> 43:19.160
the cumulative feel of the writing style

43:19.160 --> 43:21.160
is hard to do in video form,

43:21.160 --> 43:23.160
and I was never really good at book reports anyway,

43:23.160 --> 43:25.160
so instead I'll talk about some of the more specific

43:25.160 --> 43:27.160
storytelling techniques that help the game achieve

43:27.160 --> 43:28.160
what it's going for.

43:28.160 --> 43:31.160
Firstly, the constant use of deception.

43:31.160 --> 43:33.660
Other characters lie to you for all kinds of reasons

43:33.660 --> 43:35.660
or have access to incomplete information

43:35.660 --> 43:37.160
and then share it unreliably.

43:37.160 --> 43:39.660
There's lots of manipulation and hearsay going on,

43:39.660 --> 43:41.660
and it's left to you to figure out

43:41.660 --> 43:42.660
what's actually happening.

43:42.660 --> 43:45.160
Every character in this game has their own end.

43:45.160 --> 43:48.160
Why does Maria Kane want to keep the Stamatins in town?

43:48.160 --> 43:50.660
Why does the Inquisitor seem to always want

43:50.660 --> 43:52.160
to investigate the Polyhedron

43:52.160 --> 43:53.660
and find an excuse to destroy it?

43:53.660 --> 43:55.660
Did Olgimsky lock up the termitary

43:55.660 --> 43:57.660
to prevent the plague getting in

43:57.660 --> 43:59.660
or has it already struck the place

43:59.660 --> 44:01.660
and he was trying to prevent it spreading out?

44:01.660 --> 44:03.160
Are his complaints that you should be looking

44:03.160 --> 44:04.660
into the Kanes' business first

44:04.660 --> 44:06.660
a genuine concern for their power plays,

44:06.660 --> 44:09.160
or is he just trying to get you out of his hair

44:09.160 --> 44:10.160
by pretending to be?

44:10.160 --> 44:12.160
This goes the other way as well, of course.

44:12.160 --> 44:14.160
Sometimes you can play dumb to learn more about someone

44:14.160 --> 44:15.660
than they'd let on if they thought

44:15.660 --> 44:17.160
you weren't on their side,

44:17.160 --> 44:19.160
and sometimes you can lie for your own benefit,

44:19.160 --> 44:20.660
like you can get a second pistol

44:20.660 --> 44:23.160
if you tell Andrei you don't have one when he asks you.

44:23.160 --> 44:25.160
Figuring out and catching someone in a lie

44:25.160 --> 44:27.160
or successfully lying to someone else

44:27.160 --> 44:29.660
feels great because you really are gaining ground

44:29.660 --> 44:31.660
in a struggle for truth and control.

44:31.660 --> 44:34.660
It's very engaging getting lied to by a story

44:34.660 --> 44:36.660
and having to put the pieces together yourself.

44:36.660 --> 44:38.660
Secondly, there's the way you experience

44:38.660 --> 44:40.160
the same overall story

44:40.160 --> 44:42.160
from three very different perspectives.

44:42.160 --> 44:43.660
The Bachelor, for example,

44:43.660 --> 44:46.160
is a clever and rational-minded man,

44:46.160 --> 44:48.160
but he's so obsessed with pursuing

44:48.160 --> 44:50.160
his specific lines of inquiry

44:50.160 --> 44:51.660
that he spends a lot of time getting tricked

44:51.660 --> 44:54.660
into doing busy work or ignoring the real story,

44:54.660 --> 44:57.660
and when he is trying, he can be pretty bad at it.

44:57.660 --> 44:59.660
He's an outsider, but rather than working

44:59.660 --> 45:02.160
to gain people's trust and get on a decent footing,

45:02.160 --> 45:04.660
the player's text options relate that the character

45:04.660 --> 45:06.660
they're inhabiting can be a total asshole,

45:06.660 --> 45:09.160
but could I please offer you a piece of advice?

45:09.160 --> 45:11.160
I need no advice.

45:11.160 --> 45:12.660
I mean, look at this choice.

45:12.660 --> 45:14.660
This is something The Bachelor thought to say.

45:14.660 --> 45:17.160
You're supposed to be asking this guy for help, Daniel.

45:17.160 --> 45:18.660
What the fuck are you doing?

45:18.660 --> 45:20.160
Several characters in the story have the power

45:20.160 --> 45:21.660
to predict the future,

45:21.660 --> 45:23.160
and The Bachelor has the power

45:23.160 --> 45:25.660
to be a dismissive piece of shit to all of them.

45:25.660 --> 45:27.160
The Bachelor says things that he must think

45:27.160 --> 45:28.660
in his head sound really cool,

45:28.660 --> 45:31.160
but to say to another person is, like, super weird.

45:31.160 --> 45:32.660
You are broken, Lara.

45:32.660 --> 45:35.660
I, on the other hand, am used to winning.

45:35.660 --> 45:37.160
At numerous points in the game,

45:37.160 --> 45:39.160
you can just randomly say a Latin phrase

45:39.160 --> 45:40.160
to try and sound clever.

45:40.160 --> 45:42.160
Medica morbo adhibe.

45:42.160 --> 45:44.660
Asperty lies to The Bachelor about who's responsible

45:44.660 --> 45:46.660
for the town's water supply being destroyed,

45:46.660 --> 45:48.660
but the guy who actually did it just made a mistake.

45:48.660 --> 45:50.660
She's buying time for him to get to safety

45:50.660 --> 45:52.160
by sending you on a wild goose chase

45:52.160 --> 45:53.660
because she rightfully believes The Bachelor

45:53.660 --> 45:56.160
will try to fucking kill the guy if he gets the chance.

45:56.160 --> 45:57.660
The Bachelor is such a piece of shit.

45:57.660 --> 45:59.160
Look how he talks to this poor woman.

45:59.160 --> 46:01.160
This is incredible characterization.

46:01.160 --> 46:02.660
Like, you're just stuck in the body

46:02.660 --> 46:05.160
of this pretentious buffoon. It's great.

46:05.160 --> 46:06.660
In conversation with the Haruspex,

46:06.660 --> 46:09.160
Asperty casually refers to The Bachelor

46:09.160 --> 46:12.160
as the prickly prick that'll bury us all.

46:12.160 --> 46:14.160
Bachelor's plot is largely a struggle to do

46:14.160 --> 46:16.660
what seems obvious to him with his degree in medicine

46:16.660 --> 46:18.160
but which conflict with the values

46:18.160 --> 46:19.660
of the people of the town.

46:19.660 --> 46:21.160
He wants to inspect Simon's body,

46:21.160 --> 46:23.160
but the Kains have a family ritual

46:23.160 --> 46:25.660
where bodies are left unobserved for 24 hours.

46:25.660 --> 46:28.160
Then later he wants to dissect an infected body

46:28.160 --> 46:30.160
to study the plague, but the local culture

46:30.160 --> 46:32.660
forbids any kind of defilement of the body,

46:32.660 --> 46:34.660
including surgery and autopsies.

46:34.660 --> 46:36.660
It's a special right given only

46:36.660 --> 46:39.660
to special families of medicine men, the Menkhu.

46:39.660 --> 46:41.160
The Bachelor spends multiple days

46:41.160 --> 46:43.160
literally and figuratively fighting

46:43.160 --> 46:44.660
the people he's trying to save

46:44.660 --> 46:46.160
to the point of getting arrested,

46:46.160 --> 46:47.660
attempting to subvert their laws

46:47.660 --> 46:49.160
so he can help sort things out.

46:49.160 --> 46:51.660
By the end of this, Dankowski has a very low opinion

46:51.660 --> 46:53.660
of the townspeople and their traditions

46:53.660 --> 46:55.160
and decides he has to work within them

46:55.160 --> 46:57.160
to get anything done and turns to someone

46:57.160 --> 46:59.160
who can do the things he can't.

46:59.160 --> 47:00.660
Over the course of his story,

47:00.660 --> 47:02.660
Dankowski finds himself siding with the characters

47:02.660 --> 47:04.660
who appeal the most to his belief system

47:04.660 --> 47:07.660
about the world and against the more folksy wisdom

47:07.660 --> 47:10.160
of the Haruspex and the supposed miracle working

47:10.160 --> 47:11.160
of the Changeling.

47:11.160 --> 47:12.660
All three characters play through

47:12.660 --> 47:16.160
the same 12 days, and these stories aren't separate.

47:16.160 --> 47:17.660
Whichever character you play,

47:17.660 --> 47:19.660
the other characters are dropped in the world too

47:19.660 --> 47:21.160
and follow their stories as well.

47:21.160 --> 47:23.660
You even interact with them as part of your story.

47:23.660 --> 47:25.660
You cross paths with the other characters quite a lot,

47:25.660 --> 47:27.660
but you never really have an understanding

47:27.660 --> 47:29.660
of what the other character's path is.

47:29.660 --> 47:32.160
Early on, it sounds like the Haruspex is responsible

47:32.160 --> 47:34.160
for the deaths of both Simon and Isidore,

47:34.160 --> 47:36.160
though some people vouch for his innocence,

47:36.160 --> 47:39.160
but then you find out that Isidore is his father.

47:39.160 --> 47:41.160
Would he really just kill his dad like that?

47:41.160 --> 47:42.660
But then it turns out the plague

47:42.660 --> 47:44.160
might have killed those people,

47:44.160 --> 47:45.660
as far as you know anyway,

47:45.660 --> 47:47.160
but people seem to be saying he's going around

47:47.160 --> 47:48.660
killing people now.

47:48.660 --> 47:50.160
They're calling him the Ripper.

47:50.160 --> 47:53.160
I'd wondered if maybe you play a serial killer in his plot.

47:53.160 --> 47:54.660
When you talk to him, he seems reasonable

47:54.660 --> 47:56.160
and like he's trying to make a cure

47:56.160 --> 47:58.160
for the plague, a panacea,

47:58.160 --> 48:01.660
but both you and Dankowski seem wary of his methods.

48:01.660 --> 48:05.660
He's using a kind of medicine that seems kind of folksy

48:05.660 --> 48:08.660
and a bit made up, so you kind of ignore it.

48:08.660 --> 48:10.160
He's got his own shit to deal with,

48:10.160 --> 48:11.660
something about a guy called Foreman Oyun

48:11.660 --> 48:13.160
and what a big problem he poses.

48:13.160 --> 48:16.160
Dankowski never even meets that guy, whoever he is,

48:16.160 --> 48:18.160
but because he's a trusted member of this culture,

48:18.160 --> 48:20.160
you need him to do some stuff for you.

48:20.160 --> 48:22.160
For part of the main plot, you have to help

48:22.160 --> 48:24.160
break him out of a prison to help you

48:24.160 --> 48:26.160
because the governor doesn't believe he's innocent

48:26.160 --> 48:28.160
of all the shit he's heard about him at this point.

48:28.160 --> 48:29.660
Basically, when you're playing as the Bachelor,

48:29.660 --> 48:32.160
the Haruspex seems a whole lot like a dangerous weirdo

48:32.160 --> 48:34.160
whose help you happen to need,

48:34.160 --> 48:36.160
but when you're playing as the Haruspex,

48:36.160 --> 48:38.660
his side of the story actually starts to make sense,

48:38.660 --> 48:40.160
and that kind of asymmetrical storytelling

48:40.160 --> 48:42.660
isn't something you tend to get in video games.

48:42.660 --> 48:44.160
In keeping with the unsettling

48:44.160 --> 48:46.660
and anxiety-inducing design of the rest of the mechanics,

48:46.660 --> 48:49.160
the game's dialogue system deliberately frustrates

48:49.160 --> 48:51.660
your ability to fully understand the story too.

48:51.660 --> 48:53.660
When you're talking to someone, you often have the chance

48:53.660 --> 48:56.160
to ask questions or make observations,

48:56.160 --> 48:59.160
but often in a chain of dialogue you can't come back to.

48:59.160 --> 49:01.160
There aren't really dialogue trees here.

49:01.160 --> 49:03.660
You ask one of several things, and that's your lot.

49:03.660 --> 49:06.660
Sometimes dialogue choices exit out of the conversation

49:06.660 --> 49:08.160
with no way to go back and progress it.

49:08.160 --> 49:10.660
The only way to learn absolutely everything you can

49:10.660 --> 49:12.660
is to load a lot of quick saves around dialogue

49:12.660 --> 49:14.660
or try to only ask questions

49:14.660 --> 49:16.660
you think you don't already know the answer to.

49:16.660 --> 49:19.160
There is absolutely no way this wasn't intentional.

49:19.160 --> 49:22.160
The game wants you to feel trapped in dialogue,

49:22.160 --> 49:24.660
so you have to think carefully about what to ask

49:24.660 --> 49:27.660
and if you can trust those answers to ever learn anything,

49:27.660 --> 49:29.160
and you can't go back and ask the other

49:29.160 --> 49:31.660
without the inconvenience of loading a save.

49:31.660 --> 49:34.160
You have to figure out what thing your character should say

49:34.160 --> 49:36.160
which won't end the talking if you want to learn more

49:36.160 --> 49:38.660
about what's going on, so you learn to talk manipulatively

49:38.660 --> 49:40.160
instead of truthfully.

49:40.160 --> 49:41.660
Do you really need to tell someone

49:41.660 --> 49:44.160
you think their idea is bad when you can play along

49:44.160 --> 49:45.160
and learn more?

49:45.160 --> 49:47.660
It makes even dialogue somewhat tense,

49:47.660 --> 49:49.660
uncertain what option will end the talking.

49:49.660 --> 49:52.160
Take into account it's possible to fail quests

49:52.160 --> 49:53.660
by saying the wrong thing,

49:53.660 --> 49:56.160
and you have a great system nestled precisely

49:56.160 --> 49:58.660
in the fact it seems unforgiving and incomplete.

49:58.660 --> 50:02.160
The system only feels bad if you're trained to expect

50:02.160 --> 50:04.160
to be able to go back and learn everything you want,

50:04.160 --> 50:06.660
but as we've just spent over 40 minutes covering,

50:06.660 --> 50:08.660
the game's about not getting what you want

50:08.660 --> 50:10.160
and hating people for it.

50:10.160 --> 50:12.660
One thing that complicates discussions of the writing

50:12.660 --> 50:14.160
is the fact that the game has had

50:14.160 --> 50:16.160
two English translations now.

50:16.160 --> 50:18.160
The first, which came out when the game was released overseas

50:18.160 --> 50:20.660
in 2005, was notoriously so strange

50:20.660 --> 50:23.160
that some sections of the game are borderline impossible

50:23.160 --> 50:25.660
to understand without a guide or a philosophy degree,

50:25.660 --> 50:28.160
and some sections were even taken out completely

50:28.160 --> 50:30.660
for foreign releases because they just didn't make sense.

50:30.660 --> 50:33.660
The HD remaster has a new, improved translation

50:33.660 --> 50:35.660
and has the cut parts put back in.

50:35.660 --> 50:37.160
It also has new voice recordings,

50:37.160 --> 50:41.160
which is good because the last ones weren't great.

50:41.160 --> 50:45.660
Your sensitive hands kill more often than present life.

50:45.660 --> 50:48.160
You will inevitably cause harm,

50:48.160 --> 50:52.160
and this smartass won't consider the losses at all.

50:52.160 --> 50:54.160
You both lack mercy.

50:54.160 --> 50:55.660
See, that's just not fitting at all.

50:55.660 --> 50:58.660
The Changeling is an ambiguously magical little girl,

50:58.660 --> 51:02.160
not an evil, elderly crone witch.

51:02.160 --> 51:05.160
Simon, the land has cast out a monster

51:05.160 --> 51:08.160
from the bowels to bridle his impudence.

51:08.160 --> 51:10.660
Katharina. Oh, sorry, she's Katharina in this version.

51:10.660 --> 51:12.660
Is one of those clairvoyants I mentioned earlier,

51:12.660 --> 51:15.160
but she's also whacked out on morphine most of the time.

51:15.160 --> 51:17.660
This voice really isn't appropriate for her.

51:17.660 --> 51:20.160
I need morphine.

51:20.160 --> 51:21.160
Yeah, that's better.

51:21.160 --> 51:23.160
The new vocalists are much more fitting

51:23.160 --> 51:24.660
and better directed, too.

51:24.660 --> 51:26.660
They would have had to re-record the vocals anyway

51:26.660 --> 51:29.160
because the translation they were going from was pretty bad.

51:29.160 --> 51:31.160
For example, there's a cultural term

51:31.160 --> 51:33.160
the Haruspex uses a lot to refer to the Bachelor,

51:33.160 --> 51:34.660
uh, oinon.

51:34.660 --> 51:36.160
Go, oinon.

51:36.160 --> 51:38.660
I need time to pick up my tools.

51:38.660 --> 51:41.160
Um, the original vocalizations,

51:41.160 --> 51:43.160
well, they're left a little bit to be desired.

51:43.160 --> 51:44.660
Go, onion.

51:44.660 --> 51:46.660
I need to collect the tools.

51:46.660 --> 51:50.160
This epidemic acts as if it has a mind of its own.

51:50.160 --> 51:53.660
This disease behaves as though it has a mind of its own.

51:53.660 --> 51:56.160
Yeah, see, maybe they forgot to delete a sentence there.

51:56.160 --> 51:56.660
I don't know.

51:56.660 --> 51:59.660
Traces of the supernatural are found more often

51:59.660 --> 52:02.660
than most reasonable and wise people would like.

52:02.660 --> 52:04.660
Mmm, not really feeling it.

52:04.660 --> 52:05.660
Chimeras that had been...

52:05.660 --> 52:06.660
Ha ha ha ha!

52:06.660 --> 52:08.160
Chimeras worship...

52:08.160 --> 52:09.660
Okay, that's a little better.

52:09.660 --> 52:12.660
That sounds like it might even be a way of saying it.

52:12.660 --> 52:14.660
It's Chimera, right?

52:14.660 --> 52:19.160
Oh, God, I don't even know anymore how to pronounce...

52:19.160 --> 52:21.660
Chimera. Please be Chimera.

52:21.660 --> 52:22.660
Chimera.

52:22.660 --> 52:24.160
What? WHAT?!

52:24.160 --> 52:25.160
Screwed this one up.

52:25.160 --> 52:26.160
Needs fixing.

52:26.160 --> 52:28.160
That is not how you pronounce Chimera.

52:28.160 --> 52:30.160
It sounds like someone machine-translated

52:30.160 --> 52:32.160
the original Russian script into English

52:32.160 --> 52:34.160
then went through doing right-click thesaurus

52:34.160 --> 52:35.660
to make it sound smarter.

52:35.660 --> 52:37.660
It's tough to pass and it really throws me off.

52:37.660 --> 52:39.660
Every time a character's side of a conversation

52:39.660 --> 52:42.660
turns out to be three lines of this kind of text,

52:42.660 --> 52:45.160
my brain groans at me and I have to pause for a sec

52:45.160 --> 52:46.660
to mentally prepare to read it.

52:46.660 --> 52:48.660
The game's weird writing was like that

52:48.660 --> 52:49.660
in the original game too.

52:49.660 --> 52:51.660
Russians don't walk around talking like this.

52:51.660 --> 52:53.160
This is just how it was written.

52:53.160 --> 52:55.160
I originally thought this line in the old translation,

52:55.160 --> 52:56.660
immortal dragon, was weird,

52:56.660 --> 52:58.660
like they were trying to refer to Simon

52:58.660 --> 52:59.660
as a mythological creature

52:59.660 --> 53:01.660
but accidentally refer to him as a creature

53:01.660 --> 53:04.160
that we have a lot of visual connotations for.

53:04.160 --> 53:06.160
The new one says Leviathan,

53:06.160 --> 53:07.160
which seems more appropriate.

53:07.160 --> 53:08.660
If you call someone a Leviathan,

53:08.660 --> 53:10.660
it sounds metaphorical and less literal,

53:10.660 --> 53:12.660
but I checked and the original Russian version

53:12.660 --> 53:14.160
calls him an immortal dragon too,

53:14.160 --> 53:16.660
and dragon doesn't have any special metaphorical meaning

53:16.660 --> 53:18.160
in Russian. It just means dragon.

53:18.160 --> 53:19.660
It's just a weirdly written game

53:19.660 --> 53:21.660
that the old translation makes even weirder

53:21.660 --> 53:23.160
by taking it way too literally,

53:23.160 --> 53:25.160
but there's an interesting intersection going on here.

53:25.160 --> 53:28.160
You see, while the translation is improved,

53:28.160 --> 53:30.660
at least in my opinion, the sense of strangeness

53:30.660 --> 53:32.660
in the unforgiving and alien culture

53:32.660 --> 53:35.160
of the strange town was completely intended.

53:35.660 --> 53:38.660
Some people actually defend the older translation

53:38.660 --> 53:40.160
for adding to this feel.

53:40.160 --> 53:41.660
Like, some people will actually say

53:41.660 --> 53:44.160
that the worst translation is better

53:44.160 --> 53:46.660
at getting across the feel the game is going for.

53:46.660 --> 53:49.160
Now, we're gonna get into some subjective territory here.

53:49.160 --> 53:51.660
We're gonna have to peel away a few layers

53:51.660 --> 53:53.660
of the onion of interpretation,

53:53.660 --> 53:56.660
but while I can see that argument, I...

53:56.660 --> 53:59.160
Phony! You're a fucking phony!

53:59.160 --> 54:01.160
Okay, fine.

54:01.160 --> 54:02.660
I have something embarrassing to admit

54:02.660 --> 54:04.160
about my relationship with this game,

54:04.160 --> 54:06.160
which really throws my pretentious hipster credentials

54:06.160 --> 54:07.160
into question.

54:07.160 --> 54:09.660
You telling him you're a phony yet?

54:09.660 --> 54:11.160
Yeah, I'm doing it now.

54:11.160 --> 54:13.160
Are you doing it?

54:13.160 --> 54:15.160
Y-y-yeah, I'm doing it.

54:15.160 --> 54:16.160
Are you doing it?

54:16.160 --> 54:17.660
Get out of my fucking video!

54:17.660 --> 54:20.160
You see, I have two failed prior attempts

54:20.160 --> 54:21.660
to make it through this game.

54:21.660 --> 54:24.160
In 2013, I found the Rock Paper Shotgun articles

54:24.160 --> 54:26.160
by Quentin Smith, hallowed be his name,

54:26.160 --> 54:28.160
and found them really convincing on the subject

54:28.160 --> 54:29.660
of how games could be.

54:29.660 --> 54:31.160
They really opened my eyes and changed

54:31.160 --> 54:32.660
how I think about gaming,

54:32.660 --> 54:34.660
so I decided to try the game for myself.

54:34.660 --> 54:37.660
The original translation bounced me right off.

54:37.660 --> 54:39.660
It was a little too much for me to want to sit down

54:39.660 --> 54:42.160
and put time into when I bought it in 2013

54:42.160 --> 54:44.160
and had a degree to pretend to work for

54:44.160 --> 54:45.160
and Gundam to watch,

54:45.160 --> 54:46.660
and I actually took a picture on my phone

54:46.660 --> 54:48.660
of the funniest thing about this experience,

54:48.660 --> 54:50.660
which was when the most understandable sentence

54:50.660 --> 54:53.160
I'd read so far was a character apologizing

54:53.160 --> 54:55.160
for if they don't make much sense.

54:55.160 --> 54:57.160
I was like, yeah, thanks,

54:57.160 --> 54:58.660
so I stopped.

54:58.660 --> 55:00.660
Then a couple of years later, I tried again,

55:00.660 --> 55:02.160
pushed past my initial problems,

55:02.160 --> 55:03.660
hated being alone with my thoughts

55:03.660 --> 55:05.160
when I was walking around the town

55:05.160 --> 55:06.660
because most of my thoughts were about

55:06.660 --> 55:08.160
how good Turn A Gundam was,

55:08.160 --> 55:09.660
and basically did such a bad job

55:09.660 --> 55:11.160
I was dying over and over on day two

55:11.160 --> 55:12.660
and realized I'd have to go back

55:12.660 --> 55:14.160
and gave up.

55:14.160 --> 55:16.160
So I spent years agreeing with critics,

55:16.160 --> 55:17.660
convinced of their arguments

55:17.660 --> 55:19.160
that games could do more things

55:19.160 --> 55:21.160
than be viscerally entertaining or mechanically fun,

55:21.160 --> 55:23.660
despite failing to play the central game

55:23.660 --> 55:25.160
many used in their example

55:25.160 --> 55:27.160
of the value of negative experiences.

55:27.160 --> 55:29.660
It was too negative for me, apparently.

55:29.660 --> 55:31.660
Only now, with the HD edition

55:31.660 --> 55:33.160
and the new translation,

55:33.160 --> 55:35.160
did I finally stick with it long enough

55:35.160 --> 55:37.160
to truly enter into the experience,

55:37.160 --> 55:39.160
and I'm glad I finally got to do that,

55:39.160 --> 55:41.660
and I think I really needed the better translation

55:41.660 --> 55:43.160
to help bring me in.

55:43.160 --> 55:45.660
That older version probably has its charms,

55:45.660 --> 55:48.160
and I'm sure it must considering the game had defenders

55:48.160 --> 55:50.660
for almost a decade before the fixed version came out,

55:50.660 --> 55:53.160
but it was certainly too much for me.

55:53.160 --> 55:55.160
However, even the new and improved version

55:55.160 --> 55:56.660
of the game still has its problems.

55:56.660 --> 55:58.160
We've already covered aspects of the game

55:58.160 --> 56:00.160
that are just not gonna be for everyone.

56:00.160 --> 56:01.660
The slow pace, the tone,

56:01.660 --> 56:03.160
the feel of the gameplay and mechanics.

56:03.160 --> 56:05.660
Now let's talk about the actual problems.

56:05.660 --> 56:11.660
♪♪

56:11.660 --> 56:14.160
Part four, the jank.

56:14.160 --> 56:16.160
One thing that's absolutely necessary

56:16.160 --> 56:18.160
to successfully progressing the story

56:18.160 --> 56:19.660
is to read your mail.

56:19.660 --> 56:21.660
You get letters from people over the course of the day,

56:21.660 --> 56:23.160
and the only way to know you get them

56:23.160 --> 56:24.660
is to know you get them,

56:24.660 --> 56:26.660
and the only way to read them is to hit the L key

56:26.660 --> 56:29.160
on your keyboard to open up the letters menu.

56:29.160 --> 56:31.160
The game doesn't tell you this.

56:31.160 --> 56:34.160
The game's tutorial, amazing in its own way as it is,

56:34.160 --> 56:36.660
fails to tell you one of the most critical things

56:36.660 --> 56:38.660
you need to know. If you don't read your mail,

56:38.660 --> 56:41.160
you straight up will not know what to do on some days,

56:41.160 --> 56:43.660
and as far as I can tell, nothing in the game tells you

56:43.660 --> 56:45.660
unless you check your keyboard options.

56:45.660 --> 56:47.160
This is a huge oversight.

56:47.160 --> 56:49.160
The game does do interesting things

56:49.160 --> 56:50.660
with not giving you proper information,

56:50.660 --> 56:52.660
like it never tells you that food prices

56:52.660 --> 56:54.660
are about to ruin your life, or it doesn't tell you

56:54.660 --> 56:56.660
that some of your quests will end in disaster

56:56.660 --> 56:58.160
and you maybe shouldn't have bothered

56:58.160 --> 56:59.660
or run away with the money,

56:59.660 --> 57:01.660
and if someone's not going to get to those moments

57:01.660 --> 57:02.660
because they didn't understand

57:02.660 --> 57:04.160
what they were supposed to be doing

57:04.160 --> 57:06.160
or got annoyed they hadn't even been told

57:06.160 --> 57:07.660
a core feature by the game,

57:07.660 --> 57:09.160
it's a genuine flaw.

57:09.160 --> 57:10.660
Speaking of the flaw...

57:10.660 --> 57:13.160
Hear that thud?

57:13.160 --> 57:15.160
When you have too many items in your inventory,

57:15.160 --> 57:17.160
the item drops on the ground in a bag

57:17.160 --> 57:19.160
and you have to drop something else to pick it up.

57:19.160 --> 57:21.160
If this is a plot-important item,

57:21.160 --> 57:23.660
not hearing that and looking down to swap something out

57:23.660 --> 57:25.160
could cause a lot of problems.

57:25.160 --> 57:27.160
Ha ha ha.

57:27.160 --> 57:29.160
I think the game could have done a much better job

57:29.160 --> 57:31.160
of letting you know when you don't have room for something.

57:31.160 --> 57:33.660
This is a section from the changeling story later on.

57:33.660 --> 57:36.160
I can't pick up this bag because my inventory is full,

57:36.160 --> 57:38.160
but the game has no way of telling me,

57:38.160 --> 57:40.160
so I'm just sitting here getting stabbed to death

57:40.160 --> 57:42.160
and then I have to load a save and drop something

57:42.160 --> 57:43.160
in order to pick this up.

57:43.160 --> 57:44.660
This isn't as critical,

57:44.660 --> 57:46.160
but it showcases the problem in a funny way.

57:46.160 --> 57:47.660
If you sneak up on a rat

57:47.660 --> 57:49.160
instead of letting them see you and chase you,

57:49.160 --> 57:51.160
you can pick them up and actually use them

57:51.160 --> 57:52.660
in rat races later on,

57:52.660 --> 57:54.160
but if your inventory is full,

57:54.160 --> 57:56.660
they just turn into a bag with a rat in it.

57:56.660 --> 57:58.160
If you can't progress the story

57:58.160 --> 57:59.660
because you dropped something

57:59.660 --> 58:01.660
or you're too busy micromanaging what's in your inventory

58:01.660 --> 58:03.660
in case you get given something important,

58:03.660 --> 58:05.160
then you're being made to miss out

58:05.160 --> 58:06.660
on what's good about the game

58:06.660 --> 58:08.660
by a poorly implemented mechanic.

58:08.660 --> 58:10.660
Pathologic is already not for everybody

58:10.660 --> 58:12.660
and the mechanical stuff like this only detracts...

58:12.660 --> 58:13.660
Oh, fuck!

58:13.660 --> 58:15.160
The mechanical stuff like this

58:15.160 --> 58:17.660
only detracts from what makes it truly unique.

58:17.660 --> 58:20.160
There's a lot of jank in the game.

58:20.160 --> 58:22.660
AI bugs out if you stand in the wrong place

58:22.660 --> 58:24.660
during fights, spins in circles,

58:24.660 --> 58:26.660
or stands still and waits to die.

58:26.660 --> 58:28.660
You can get stuck in level geometry sometimes.

58:28.660 --> 58:30.660
The physics like to explode.

58:30.660 --> 58:32.660
The thing is, a lot of these sorts of problems

58:32.660 --> 58:34.660
are a result of the game existing at all.

58:34.660 --> 58:37.160
Like, you could spend a ton of man hours

58:37.160 --> 58:39.660
making the AI work perfectly in fights

58:39.660 --> 58:41.160
that aren't on completely flat ground,

58:41.160 --> 58:42.660
or you can get the game out

58:42.660 --> 58:44.160
before your team goes bust,

58:44.160 --> 58:46.660
and in many ways, much like Eye Divine Cybermancy

58:46.660 --> 58:48.660
or Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines,

58:48.660 --> 58:50.160
AI bugs are a good thing.

58:50.160 --> 58:52.660
They're a reminder of how much bloody work it took

58:52.660 --> 58:54.160
to whip this thing into existence

58:54.160 --> 58:55.660
with the available tools.

58:55.660 --> 58:57.160
I still shudder when I think about

58:57.160 --> 58:58.660
how to get the source engine to do things

58:58.660 --> 59:01.160
I or Vampire did, and Pathologic's engine

59:01.160 --> 59:02.660
seems like it was made out of whole cloth.

59:02.660 --> 59:04.660
Do you have any idea how hard that is?

59:04.660 --> 59:06.660
Video games are hard to program.

59:06.660 --> 59:09.160
It takes years of work to make something good.

59:09.160 --> 59:12.160
Games, as a rule, even the stable-looking ones,

59:12.160 --> 59:14.660
are usually at their core hugely hacked together

59:14.660 --> 59:16.160
to barely do whatever they do,

59:16.160 --> 59:19.160
and even what seems like simple, slight changes

59:19.160 --> 59:21.660
run the risk of absolutely obliterating

59:21.660 --> 59:23.160
everything you hold dear,

59:23.160 --> 59:25.160
so a lot of the game's weakest aspects

59:25.160 --> 59:27.160
feel like a compromise for the inability

59:27.160 --> 59:28.660
or instability of the engine.

59:28.660 --> 59:31.160
In the story, for example, sometimes characters interact.

59:31.160 --> 59:33.160
They talk or get one another to do things,

59:33.160 --> 59:34.660
but while you're present,

59:34.660 --> 59:36.160
characters are never doing anything.

59:36.160 --> 59:38.660
They're just standing where they're supposed to be standing

59:38.660 --> 59:40.660
and you go over and talk to them and you get the impression

59:40.660 --> 59:42.160
they're in the middle of doing it

59:42.160 --> 59:43.660
or taking a break or something.

59:43.660 --> 59:45.660
Sometimes characters meet up to discuss something

59:45.660 --> 59:47.660
or get attacked by soldiers and escape,

59:47.660 --> 59:49.660
but it's always just happened when you walk in

59:49.660 --> 59:51.660
and everything's already over whenever you're there.

59:51.660 --> 59:53.160
It's not super immersion-breaking,

59:53.160 --> 59:54.660
but a little more interaction

59:54.660 --> 59:56.660
or being able to watch the characters do the things

59:56.660 --> 59:58.660
you're told they did might have been nice.

59:58.660 --> 01:00:00.660
Also, characters sharing a space together

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:02.160
don't seem to regard each other.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.660
They either do their idle animation

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:05.660
and occasionally say lines like they normally do

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:07.660
just next to each other...

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:09.660
Yes? What is there to talk about now?

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.660
Are you sick or something?

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:14.160
How's my brother? Any news on him?

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:16.660
...or they're completely frozen in place.

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:19.160
You never even get to watch a conversation

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.660
between two characters.

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:22.160
Even when they're in the same room,

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.660
you talk to each of them separately.

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:25.160
Again, these aren't things I would really

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:26.660
criticize the game for.

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:28.660
These are reflective of the absolutely minuscule amount

01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:30.660
of budget and time the developers had

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:32.160
and the limitations of their engine.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.660
These are things that it would have been nice

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:35.660
to see working better but aren't a huge problem

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:37.160
when you're actually playing.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.660
There's other technical problems too.

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:40.160
There's this weird bug where the screen's

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:43.160
entire color palette shifts when certain effects are playing

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:45.160
like fires or blood splatters during combat.

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:46.660
I'm sure there's a fix for this,

01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:48.160
but I decided to just live with it.

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.660
It felt in the spirit of things to do that,

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:50.660
but it's still very distracting

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:52.160
and definitely not intentional.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:54.160
All in all, all the little things like this

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.660
contribute to the overall feeling

01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.660
that the creators had lofty ideas

01:00:57.660 --> 01:00:59.660
for their story and world full of characters

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.660
to interact with and environments to explore

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:03.660
but were limited in what they could accomplish.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.660
However, it's important not to confuse limitation

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:07.660
with artistic choice because some things

01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:09.660
in the game are easy to dismiss as problems

01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:12.160
but work in the context of the story that's being told

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.160
and the overall effect being attempted.

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.660
On that note, we haven't really talked

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:17.160
about the graphics yet.

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:18.660
Visually, even for the time, the game

01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:20.160
was regarded as pretty ugly.

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.160
Everything is a weird angular facsimile

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.660
of what it's supposed to be.

01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:25.160
The color palette is drab.

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.660
Infected and dying districts tint things

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:30.160
even uglier shades, and all the minor NPCs

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.660
look the same as each other.

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:34.160
However, I think that ugliness was deliberate

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:36.160
and actually serves a purpose.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.660
Oh, no, it's the pretentious police!

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:39.660
They found me!

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:42.160
Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.660
The game is set in a dying rural town.

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:47.660
The sky is never clear, everyone's sick,

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:49.660
everything is depressing, and the filters

01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:51.660
that turn up in infected areas make everything

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:53.160
even more sickly.

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:55.660
The fairly low texture detail and polygon count

01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:57.660
do end up contributing to this look

01:01:57.660 --> 01:01:59.160
and feel in their own way.

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:00.660
By being not much to look at,

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:03.160
the downer tone set by the story and mechanics

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.160
isn't thrown away by looking pretty.

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:07.660
The game's art design when it comes to characters

01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:10.160
or the more interesting locations is imaginative enough

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.160
that even if it doesn't look visually great,

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.660
you can see what they're going for

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:15.660
and understand what it's supposed to be at least.

01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:17.160
So, at least in my opinion,

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:19.160
the art style contributes to the feel.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.160
I think it works that it looks like this

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:23.160
and not other ways, but I'm not sure

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.160
if I'm happy with saying that because if the game

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:27.660
had looked better, like if it was on par with Half-Life 2,

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:29.160
I don't think I'd have been saying,

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.660
this should have looked worse, would I?

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:32.660
It's one of those things where because it works

01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:34.660
well enough for what it is, I don't feel a need

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:36.160
to complain that the graphics are bad

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.660
even though obviously they could be better.

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:39.160
People can decide for themselves

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:41.160
where the experience is improved or worsened

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.160
by things like bugs or inventory stuff

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.660
or the combat or graphics or translation

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:47.660
and ultimately the game is what you get out of it,

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:50.660
and for some people the line of what makes a game good

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:52.160
is very far away from anything

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.160
any version of this game is doing.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:56.160
It's completely understandable why some people

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.660
don't engage with the game or want to and bounce off it.

01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:01.160
I certainly did that the first two times

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.660
so I can respect that.

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:04.160
Like I said, it's not fun.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.160
I can't really recommend you play it.

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:08.660
That's why I'm here sharing what I think is interesting

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:10.160
about the experience and not telling you

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.660
to play it for yourself.

01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:13.660
I suffered so you didn't have to.

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:16.160
["Bloodborne"]

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:18.160
Once you get over the initial humps

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.160
and learn to deal with the difficult elements,

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:23.160
cope with the survival mechanics and get good at walking,

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.660
wow, what a phrase, get good at walking.

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:27.660
Learn to do a repetitive, unsatisfying thing

01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:29.160
on your way to a goal.

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.160
Walking in Pathologic reminds me a little bit

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.160
of doing exercise or cleaning my kitchen.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:36.160
It's not fun, but it's important to learn how to do it

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.660
or the empty cans of kidney beans that still have some juice

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:40.660
and a bean or two in them you left on the side

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:42.660
to figure out which bin to throw them out in

01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:44.160
start to smell after getting left there

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.160
for a week and a half.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.160
That's not a real story.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:48.160
Once you figure out what the game is demanding of you,

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:50.160
it doesn't stay as difficult as it seems.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:53.160
I think people tend to overstate the game's unpleasantness

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.160
when it's not a constant.

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.160
It's just an early spike as it teaches you

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.160
what the experience is going to be like.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.660
Once you get into the swing of things,

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:02.160
The Bachelor is a cake walk but without the cake.

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.160
I mean, you aren't exactly given no help.

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:06.660
Almost everyone important trusts The Bachelor,

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:08.660
and he starts out with some useful items,

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:10.660
a weapon, decent money, some medicine,

01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:12.660
and he can make a whole lot more during the game

01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:14.660
doing quests for the rich people who trust him.

01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:16.660
It is possible to get on top of the game's economy

01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:18.660
and survival mechanics as The Bachelor.

01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:20.660
It gets hard at times and even harder

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:22.660
if you insist on doing the good guy things in quests

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:24.160
like not running away with all the money

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.660
or food you bought for that one quest

01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:28.160
or giving away literally all the money you have

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:31.160
saving six random people from getting wrongly executed,

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:32.660
which I didn't do.

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:34.660
I loaded my save after this cutscene played

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:37.160
and kept the money, and I'm a bad person for it,

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.660
but even if you do all the good guy things,

01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:41.660
if you know what you're doing and take the opportunities

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:43.660
that are given to you, you can make it through alive

01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:45.660
even while being a good person.

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:47.660
The Bachelor's story is technically quite hard

01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:49.160
but ultimately forgiving.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:53.160
It's a pretty balanced experience all in all.

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.160
Anyway, the Haruspex's story begins with you

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.660
bleeding to death.

01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:59.160
Upon arriving at his hometown via the train station

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.160
after ten years away studying surgery,

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.660
the Haruspex, Artemy Burakh,

01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:04.660
has been stabbed repeatedly in a fight

01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:07.160
with multiple people who believed him to be a murderer

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.160
trying to escape via the station.

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:11.660
Artemy's just got here and he's already bleeding out

01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:14.160
while wanted for his own father's murder,

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.660
and this isn't just a cutscene that happens

01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:17.660
before the game starts. Oh, no.

01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:19.660
You begin the game at the train station

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:21.660
surrounded by corpses with your health low,

01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:23.160
your reputation even lower,

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.660
and your hunger and exhaustion meters

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:26.160
already half full.

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.160
Now if you were wondering why the Haruspex

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.160
did what he did in his playthrough,

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.160
here's the first of many reasons why.

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:34.160
It turns out that for Artemy,

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:37.160
everything was fucked all the time.

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:39.660
Yeah, sure, the Bachelor playthrough was pretty hard.

01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:41.660
You maybe even figured out how to play it

01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:43.160
and not die too much.

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:45.160
I bet you thought you were good at this game.

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:47.160
That's where you're wrong.

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:49.660
Daniil Dankovsky's fun step vacation

01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:51.160
was just the tutorial

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:54.160
for Artemy Burakh's tormentous nightmare.

01:05:54.660 --> 01:06:00.660
♪♪

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:03.160
Some people refer to playing the Haruspex as hard mode,

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.660
and I must admit, at the beginning,

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:07.160
it is a little bit like getting stabbed in the dick,

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:09.160
but after that it gets much worse.

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.160
Remember that horrifying moral quandary

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:13.160
as Dankovsky where you could risk

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:15.160
six innocent people getting executed

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:17.160
if you choose not to get involved in something

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.660
that isn't your business anyway?

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:20.660
The Haruspex has a moral quandary

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:22.660
a million billion times harder,

01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:24.660
and it's his first quest.

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:26.660
After getting chased into the warehouse territory

01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:28.660
by an angry mob, you go inside

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:30.160
and meet a gang of children.

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.160
This gang was there in the Bachelor's playthrough,

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.160
but you only really visited them, like, once.

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.160
They weren't really very interested in talking to you,

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:37.660
and the Bachelor was too busy sucking up

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:40.160
to the important people to care about a bunch of children.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:41.660
When you talk to Notkin, their leader,

01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:43.660
he says they have a rebel who stole something

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:45.660
from them to defect to a rival gang.

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:48.160
He says if you do him the favor of killing them for him,

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.660
he'll give you a gun and some ammo.

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:51.660
Now, I don't want to tip your hand as to whether

01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:53.660
a gun might be a useful item to have in this playthrough,

01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:55.160
but as soon as I left the building,

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.660
a man tried to beat me to death.

01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:58.660
Remember that reputation mechanic?

01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:00.160
It turns out that when it's low enough,

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.660
in addition to shopkeepers not trading with you,

01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:05.660
all regular NPCs will attack you in the street.

01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:08.160
Oh, and because these people are just law-abiding citizens

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:09.660
attacking a wanted criminal,

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:11.660
killing them in self-defense is a crime,

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:14.160
and your reputation will drop even further.

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.660
Ah.

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:17.660
Mmm.

01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:19.160
So either you run away to preserve

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.660
what reputation you have left

01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:22.160
and try to do good things to correct it

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:24.160
or fight back and make everything worse.

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.660
Good luck, fucker!

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:29.160
Have those guys seen me?

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.660
Yep, they've seen me.

01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:32.160
I feel very seen right now.

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.660
Since fighting is more of a fact

01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:36.160
of the Haruspex's short life, yeah,

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:38.160
having a gun would really help with that.

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.660
So you go out into the steppe and...

01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:42.660
Oh. Oh, fuck off.

01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:45.160
Of course. This was a gang of children.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.660
Of course the rebel member is a kid.

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:49.660
So you can tell him off and send him on his way

01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:51.660
for a minuscule reputation boost,

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:53.660
and if you kill him, it drops a bunch

01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:56.660
because, you know, you've killed a child,

01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:59.160
but your reputation already can't get much worse,

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.660
and Notkin's offer of a gun is a pretty big deal,

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:03.660
and this kid has a schmowder on him.

01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:05.660
It's one of the critical items.

01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:07.660
It's basically the one thing in the game

01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:10.160
you can't pass up an opportunity to get.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:13.160
Plus he's in a gang, so he knew the risks.

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:16.160
So you can get a gun super early on in Artemy's playthrough

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.660
but at a significant moral cost.

01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:20.660
Obviously the kid is just polygons,

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:22.660
but if you take the roleplaying seriously

01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:25.160
or even just stop for a moment and ask yourself

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:28.660
if you would do this in real life if it meant survival,

01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:30.660
there's a lot of feelings to unpack here.

01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:32.660
I mean, let's recap.

01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:35.660
In many modern RPGs, child murder is still a thing

01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:37.660
that won't even go on the table.

01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:39.660
Get on the fucking table, MacReady!

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:42.660
Oh, I'll be back for you in Fallout 4, fucker,

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:44.660
when you're old enough to die!

01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:47.660
In Pathologic, one of the most taboo things

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:51.660
there is in gaming is one character's first quest

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:54.160
and there's significant personal justification

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.660
for going through with it.

01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:58.160
You are dying and you need the stuff

01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.660
you get for it desperately.

01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:02.160
You just have to find a way to live with the fact

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:04.660
that you are now wanted for a murder you definitely

01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:07.160
did commit along with the one murder you didn't.

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:09.160
Now it's not all bad for the Haruspex.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:11.660
Okay, it is, but he gets one thing.

01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:14.160
As a Menkhu, he can also dissect corpses,

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.160
a thing the Bachelor had to get you out of prison

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.160
to do for him.

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:19.160
Every corpse you come across carries a heart,

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.160
a liver, one kidney,

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:22.160
I don't know, just go with it,

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.160
and some blood.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:26.160
These grisly items form a new kind of currency.

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:28.660
Various characters in the game will trade you

01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:30.160
really useful stuff for these,

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:32.660
opening up an entirely new black market economy.

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:35.160
Characters who wouldn't even talk to the Bachelor

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:37.160
are now an extra tool for survival

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:38.160
if you know where to look.

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:40.160
Give me the herbs, worm.

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:43.160
Artemy's father's secret lab has tools to make medicines

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:46.160
that can raise immunity and lower infection super easily

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:48.160
making him infinitely more survivable

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:50.160
when it comes to the plague than Dankovsky

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:52.160
if you put effort into perfecting the recipes.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:54.160
They work like the medicine you've used before

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:56.660
but much stronger and with much less downsides

01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:57.660
if you get them right.

01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:59.660
I really like the asymmetrical storytelling

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:01.660
that's happening with this aspect of the gameplay.

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:04.160
Not only is it just an extra layer of fun stuff

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.160
to learn and master to survive in the town

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.660
and it feels good getting it right,

01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:09.160
but you're also seeing the sides of the world

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:12.160
that Dankovsky's beliefs just denied him access to.

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:14.160
He thought that this medicine was made up

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:15.660
and here it is keeping you alive

01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:17.160
even if you get infected as Artemy

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:19.160
and actually it's really hard not to as him.

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.160
It's much less of a problem

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.160
because of all these herbal remedies you've got

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:24.160
but that's about it, so you're fucked,

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:26.160
but once the plague becomes a problem,

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:28.660
you can live long enough to be killed by something else

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:30.660
like this great bit where as soon as you leave a building

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:32.160
it spawns two muggers outside

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.660
and they both throw knives at you

01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:35.160
which kills you instantly.

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:36.660
At the very least, if you have to defend yourself

01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:38.660
and lower your rep, you get to keep whatever

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:42.160
was in their pockets and their meat pockets

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:43.160
and with the new economy,

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:45.160
maybe not being accepted by society

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:46.660
isn't as much of a death sentence.

01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:48.660
I really do feel like Burak doesn't enjoy

01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:50.160
unnecessary violence.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:51.160
He's an educated man.

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.160
He seems quite noble in a way.

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:54.660
He wouldn't do it if he didn't have to.

01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:56.160
It's unbecoming of his station.

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.160
Wait, does that guy have a shotgun?

01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.660
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:01.160
Getting a shotgun. One second.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:02.660
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:05.660
Getting a shotgun on day one feels a little broken

01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:07.660
after how late I got one as the Bachelor,

01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:09.160
but what makes it extra engaging

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.160
is the knowledge that I'll probably need it.

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:12.660
Selling weapons as the Harrisbacks

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:14.660
is even more nail-biting than before.

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:17.160
Just because of the way his campaign is set up,

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:20.160
you will need everything you could buy with that money

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.160
even more desperately than before,

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.160
but you also kinda need the g-

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:26.160
Wha-come on! What the fuck?!

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:27.660
There's five guys?!

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:30.160
So it's about now that I realized why Artemy ended up

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:32.160
with his reputation as the Ripper.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:33.160
He was in a desperate place,

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:35.660
so he was forced to make difficult decisions,

01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:37.160
and the few options available to him

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.660
involve getting his hands dirty.

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:40.660
The story makes a lot of sense now.

01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:42.160
He wasn't a serial killer.

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:44.160
He was a guy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:45.660
and has to fight to survive

01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:47.660
and solve his own father's murder

01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:49.160
and maybe help the town,

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:51.660
and one of his skills happens to be surgical ability.

01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:53.660
Luckily, there are some chances to redeem yourself.

01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:55.660
You hear one of your attackers from the opening

01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:57.660
got away and is bleeding out in the graveyard.

01:11:57.660 --> 01:11:59.160
This guy needs a blood transfusion,

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.660
and if I save his life, maybe he'll help clear my name.

01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:04.160
So you traipse all the way across the entire town

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:06.160
to get to the hunchback who will draw some of your blood

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.660
for you if you have enough health to spare.

01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:09.160
Pick it up.

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.660
Don't forget to pick it up this time

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.660
or you'll have to come all the way back again!

01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:15.160
And then take a long stroll all the way back.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:17.160
Did I say stroll? I meant to say...

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.660
Seven guys are chasing me.

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:20.660
Oh, God, stop it! Leave me alone!

01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:23.160
I'm a good person. It's just a misunderstanding.

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.660
Oh, thank God, a sewing needle.

01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:26.160
Hey, kid, take it. Thanks for the medicine.

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.160
I'll be needing that. Anyway, back to being chased.

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:31.160
The walking in the easy mode, the bachelor's playthrough,

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:33.160
was pretty tense at the best of times,

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:35.160
but now it's an active fight for survival.

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:36.660
Leave me alone, please!

01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:38.660
Just let me do a good thing!

01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:41.160
Why don't you try walking a mile in my shoes?

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.660
You know what? Don't put your feet

01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:44.160
anywhere near my shoes.

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.160
You can all put both of your feet

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:48.160
in the grave.

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.660
Look, don't criticize my one-liner, okay?

01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:51.160
I'm under a lot of stress.

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.160
-♪♪

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:15.160
And blood transfusion. I did it!

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.160
I saved a life!

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.160
-♪♪

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:20.160
-♪♪

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:21.160
Yay!

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:23.660
Now I'm well on my way to clearing my name,

01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:26.160
and I'm only mostly poor and exhausted

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:28.160
and hungry and dead.

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:29.660
Fuck!

01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:31.660
So remember the perspective thing I talked about?

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:34.160
The Haruspex, as a former local of this culture,

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.160
is trusted by the people who hate the bachelor

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:38.160
and spends a lot more time in places

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:39.660
the bachelor only got to go once

01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:41.660
and then got the shit kicked out of him for going to.

01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:44.160
Oh, yes, fucking get him, mate. Yeah!

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:47.160
So you see a completely different side of the story

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.660
and of the town since you spend time

01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:50.160
being public enemy number one.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.160
The reputation mechanics basically didn't come up

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:54.660
in the bachelor's run unless you killed people for no reason,

01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:56.160
but now you have to face the problems

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:59.160
having a low one poses and build it back up to survive.

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:02.160
It's hyper-engaging, not just because it's hard

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.160
but because you remember how it was before.

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:07.160
It's the same conjuring trick as day two's food shortage.

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:10.160
Everything is different and scary all over again.

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:12.160
I love it. It's hard. It's punishing.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:15.160
Arguably, it's incredibly unfair, but I love it.

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.660
You learn more about aspects of the plot

01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:18.660
the town jester had no idea about.

01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:20.660
For example, you are the reason the Stamatins

01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:22.160
never turned up on day two

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:24.660
when cowardly little Dankowski tried to flee the town.

01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:26.160
Maria found out about the plan

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:28.160
and got you to convince them to stay

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:30.160
by telling them you'd invented some cool new alcohol.

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:32.160
The Stamatins are really into the local drink,

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.160
an absinthe-like spirit with possibly magical properties,

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.660
and your medicines actually are derived

01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:39.660
from the same ingredients which you can trade

01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:41.160
with Andre for great stuff,

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:43.160
and then just to keep you on your toes,

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:44.660
once you get your reputation sorted,

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:46.660
a few days later it all happens again.

01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:49.160
You get captured by Saburov's men and thrown in jail

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.660
just like you did in Daniel's story,

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:52.160
and here's where another aspect

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.160
of the multi-character structure becomes clear

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.660
by actively fucking you.

01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:57.160
When you aren't in control of a character,

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:59.160
they make worse decisions than you did.

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:01.660
When you talk to him, he talks like the worst

01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:03.660
of the options you could have chosen.

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:05.160
He's naturally more of a dick.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:07.160
He even says random Latin phrases at you.

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.160
It's great.

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:09.660
I love this prickly little prick.

01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:11.160
He's just so well-characterized,

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:13.160
and I love how much the game hammers home

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.660
what an idiot he is in this version of the story.

01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:18.160
The big city guest jumps the gun too much.

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:20.660
Not the mystery-solving type, really.

01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:24.160
But he doesn't know our traditions.

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:26.660
He's bound to be deceived.

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:28.660
Even the plays that you can go see

01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:30.660
call Dankowski a piece of shit.

01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:33.160
All in all, we can fight.

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:36.160
You self-serving jerk.

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:40.160
Dankowski believes the disease came from the wells.

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.660
He's wrong.

01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:43.160
["Taps"]

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.660
But more importantly,

01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:46.160
he never stages a prison break.

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.160
You have to break yourself out.

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:50.160
Then, later in the game,

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:52.160
he fucks up a quest you did easily

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.660
when you were playing as him,

01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:56.160
and then you have to break him out of prison.

01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:57.660
Nice going, Dankowski!

01:15:57.660 --> 01:15:59.160
Okay, okay, fine.

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:01.160
Don't panic. I'll bargain for your release.

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:03.160
30 clips of rifle ammo?

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:05.160
Listen, there's a plague going on.

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.660
We're kind of on the clock here,

01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:09.660
and I'm not giving bullets to a gang of violent kids.

01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:11.660
Someone could get hurt.

01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:14.160
["Taps"]

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.660
["Crying"]

01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:18.160
["Taps"]

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:21.160
I did it. I saved the Bachelor.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:25.160
["Taps"]

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:28.160
The Haruspex's main quests are to develop a panacea,

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:30.160
an actual cure for the plague,

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:32.160
to figure out who killed his father, obviously,

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:35.160
and to assume his father's duties in the Kin,

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.660
the people of the steppe.

01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:38.660
To do this, he gets to go into the abattoir

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:40.160
and talk a lot with Foreman Oyun,

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.660
the guy who's currently in charge

01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:43.660
and the Bachelor barely heard anything about

01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:45.160
and who is also bad at his job

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:48.160
and everyone hates and wants you to replace him.

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:50.160
He starts giving you trials

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:52.660
to prove your worth.

01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:55.160
Two of these trials are he gives you a poison

01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:57.660
and you have to do something for him before you die of it.

01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:59.160
I'm not gonna say the trials

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:01.160
are just tricks to try and kill you,

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:03.160
but I don't know. Hmm.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:07.660
The final trial is to jump into a big hole and die.

01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:10.660
Uh, I'm not really sure about this one, Chief.

01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:12.660
He says it's a spiritual experience

01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:15.660
and your father did this too to take his place in the Kin,

01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:18.660
but no one else says anything about any trials.

01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:22.160
By the way, uh, if you jump in the hole, you die.

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:23.660
There is a spiritual aspect

01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:25.160
to Artemy's life in the town, though.

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:27.160
When you're walking around out in the steppe,

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:30.160
you can hear a cool distant chanting now.

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:33.160
["chanting"]

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:39.160
["chanting"]

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.160
A character later tells you the voice you're hearing

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:43.160
is your father's voice. That's really cool.

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.160
You feel more in touch with the land in his story

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.660
and you kind of are.

01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:49.160
Artemy's medicines are made from plants that grow in the town

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:50.660
and he can actually pick them up

01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:52.160
when he sees them around the place.

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:55.160
The wide open empty space you felt was kind of meaningless

01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.160
as the Bachelor is suddenly rife with items

01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:58.160
that can help you.

01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:00.160
You start to literally see the town differently

01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:02.660
as the Haruspex and that's just incredibly cool.

01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:04.660
All the least fun bits of the first playthrough

01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:06.160
are ramped up to 11.

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:09.160
The walking is even more excruciating and circular.

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.160
The survival mechanics are harder on account

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:13.660
of having no money and low reputation a lot of the time

01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:15.160
and not having as many rich friends.

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:18.160
Many of the quests are deliberate in-story attempts

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:21.660
to waste your time and get you killed by Foreman Oyun,

01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:23.160
but you're invested now.

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.660
The suffering is engaging

01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:26.660
and you want to know what happens,

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:28.160
how it all shakes out for him.

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:30.160
You take the hours of walking in stride.

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:31.160
Ha ha.

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:33.160
You see all the efforts you go to as proof

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:35.160
that you're willing to go through hell and high water

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.160
to save this town.

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.160
If you didn't like this game,

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.660
you wouldn't get to this point anyway,

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:40.660
but if you somehow did, it's excruciating.

01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:41.660
It's awful.

01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:43.660
You're having a shit time being bored,

01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:45.160
but if you care about the story,

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.160
if you've got immersed in the atmosphere

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.660
and are engaged fully with the survival mechanics

01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:52.160
and your understanding of how much harder things are now,

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.160
this is the best fucking time I've had in a game in years.

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:57.160
It's still not fun.

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.660
It's something else.

01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:00.660
This other thing I can't even describe.

01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:04.160
It's satisfying in a way I'm not used to games being.

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:07.160
In a way, the game is asking you a serious question

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:10.160
about whether you're willing to be punished to succeed.

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:12.660
If you give up and close the game and stop playing it,

01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:14.660
you're basically letting the town die

01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:16.160
without your help, aren't you?

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:19.160
Oyun is trying to make you give up and stop playing,

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:21.160
and I'm not gonna let him.

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.660
I'm gonna solve this shit, and I'm gonna cure the town.

01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:25.660
Just remember to pick up the quest items

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.160
that drop at your feet or you have to come

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:28.660
all the fucking way back again.

01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:30.160
You also learn how badly you'd accidentally

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:31.660
messed a lot of things up as the Bachelor

01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:33.160
without even knowing it.

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:35.160
Late in the game when you've learned a lot of the mystery

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:37.660
and figured out at last how to make a cure for the plague,

01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:40.160
but only in extremely limited quantities

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:42.160
whose source ingredient is almost impossible to get,

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:44.660
there's one side quest where a giant bull

01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:47.160
mysteriously appears stuck to a giant steak.

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:50.660
The giant bull's blood can be used as a source of the cure.

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:52.660
You get some from the bull and make arrangements

01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:54.660
to get it pulled off the steak and rescued properly

01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:56.660
the next day, which might even give you enough

01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:58.660
to save the whole town.

01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:00.660
Then you remember that when you were the Bachelor,

01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:03.160
there was a side quest featuring a staked bull

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:06.660
surrounded by people which was a clear health hazard.

01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:09.160
What if people congregating like that spreads the plague?

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:10.660
Or what if they're planning a riot?

01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:13.160
So you nonchalantly ordered the bull to be burned

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:14.660
and thought nothing of it.

You've buried us all!

So make the most of the blood you got the day before

01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:31.160
because that's all you're getting.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:34.660
In any case, the Haruspex run is a spectacular playthrough.

01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:36.160
It's excellently designed.

01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:39.160
It forces you to relate to mechanics you felt like you knew

01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:41.160
but in even more knuckle-tightening ways,

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:43.660
and every time you get one over on the world or Oyun

01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:46.160
and survive to the next day having learned more,

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:47.660
it feels like a genuine victory.

01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:49.660
Having an in-depth understanding of the layout

01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:51.660
and purpose of each part of the town

01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:54.160
and then getting to be a fugitive from the lore in it

01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:55.660
is so cool.

01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:57.160
You get to see your previous character

01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:59.160
how other people saw him instead of how you probably felt

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.660
while playing as him.

01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:02.660
You learn more about the mysteries of the town

01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:04.160
from a second perspective,

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:06.160
and you finally have something of an idea

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:07.660
of how everything slots together.

01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:10.160
All the problems the game has are even more glaring

01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:12.660
after another 20 hours of playing a story in it,

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:15.160
but I had an even better time as the Haruspex overall,

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:17.660
and I'm glad I sat through the grim,

01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:20.160
bloody nightmare of the story to the end.

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:23.160
The bitterest end.

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:25.660
Destruction is inevitable.

01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:28.160
There's no miraculous way out.

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:31.160
There was nothing to hope for from the start.

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:32.660
I can't really talk about Pathologic

01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:34.660
without showing you how it all shakes out.

01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:36.160
It's too cool not to talk about.

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:38.660
By the final days, the town is a war zone.

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:40.660
An Inquisitor and later the army have shown up

01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:42.160
to try to get things under control,

01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:43.660
but the commander hates the Inquisitor

01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:45.160
and they won't work with each other.

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:47.160
He loses control of a bunch of his troops.

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.160
Half of them die of the plague themselves,

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:51.160
and all they've really added to the proceedings

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:53.660
is now the army's shooting the diseased in the street,

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:55.660
so I really hope that you have medicine

01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:57.660
because if you get too infected,

01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:59.160
God, this last section is hard.

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.660
Actually, here's a weird thing.

01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:02.160
If you get hit by the flamethrower,

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.660
it does a ton of damage,

01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:05.160
but it also reduces your infection level.

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:06.660
I think it's meant to be a metaphor

01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:08.160
for burning out your infection.

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:10.160
Usually this kills you, but due to a bug,

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:11.660
if you somehow survive the fire

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.160
because you got out of dodge super quick

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.660
and had a lot of health,

01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:16.160
if it reduces your infection past zero,

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:17.660
it cures you of the disease.

01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:20.160
Hey, thanks for that, you little fucker.

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:23.160
The disease itself is chasing you down

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:25.160
in an evolved, even faster form

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:27.160
that looks like angels made of blood.

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:28.660
It's a nightmare.

01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:30.660
The army's brought a giant cannon

01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:33.160
and has orders to shell the entire area to the ground

01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:35.660
to prevent the plague from spreading if it comes to that,

01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:37.660
and it is coming to that.

01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:39.660
However, after a lot of false starts

01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:41.160
and internal politicking

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:42.660
and generally getting messed around,

01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:45.160
your characters manage to find a solution to the plague.

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:48.660
The trouble is each character finds their own solution.

01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:50.660
The Bachelor has helped develop a vaccine

01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:53.160
which can protect the healthy from getting infected

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:54.660
and falls in with the Kains,

01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:56.160
the utopian academics and elites

01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:58.160
who helped develop the Polyhedron,

01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:00.160
the impossible structure next to their house

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:02.660
that has kept most of the town's children safe inside

01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:05.160
and may now house Simon's soul.

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:07.160
It's a marvelous, miraculous thing

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:09.160
that heralds a new and beautiful future.

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:12.160
He also comes to think the town is a lost cause.

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:14.160
He's sick of the babblings of its people

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.160
whose customs have prevented him from helping them.

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:17.660
Over the course of the game,

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:19.660
the Bachelor's map of the town evolves

01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:21.160
as he learns new things

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.660
and gets more and more disillusioned with his quest.

01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:26.660
To the Bachelor, the town is an ugly and disgusting thing,

01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:28.660
crammed on a hill where it shouldn't

01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:31.160
with its blood and darkness seeping into the soil,

01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:34.160
and eventually the beautiful, mathematical Polyhedron

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:35.660
joins it, a wonderful thing,

01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:37.660
skewering through the dark earth

01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:39.160
and its corrupted blood,

01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:41.160
bigger and more important than anything else.

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:43.160
He believes at this point the plague is caused

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:46.160
by the backwater people's unsanitary practices

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:48.660
causing animal blood to congeal in the earth

01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:50.160
for thousands of years.

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.660
The Bachelor wants the commander to shell the town,

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:54.660
destroying it and the plague

01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:56.660
and freeing the Polyhedron of its corruption,

01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:58.660
leaving the survivors to build a new town

01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:00.160
on the other side of the river

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.160
governed by the visionary Kains.

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:03.660
If the Bachelor gets his way,

01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:05.660
he really did bury them all.

The Haruspex, however, is a local of the town

assumed his rightful place as the leader of the Kin,

and finally gained access to the source of blood

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:23.660
he can use to make a panacea and cure the infected,

01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:25.660
a step closer to defeating the disease

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:27.160
than the Bachelor's vaccine.

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.660
He manages this after a, let's say,

01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:31.660
mildly tedious final boss fight with the Foreman.

01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:34.660
Yeah, the Haruspex run has a final boss fight in it?

01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:36.660
Punch him 30 times and he does a quarter

01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:38.160
of your health each hit.

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.660
You finally get your revenge on the man who,

01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:41.660
it turns out, killed your father.

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:43.660
His map screen evolves as he learns too,

01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:45.660
portraying the town as built on the back

01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:48.160
of a giant bull with the veins of the world

01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:50.660
portraying the town as a gigantic organism.

01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:53.660
Then the Polyhedron appears, tearing through the veins,

01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:55.160
injuring the earth itself.

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:57.660
Blood pools at the base of the tower,

myopic dreams of utopia

scraping a nightmarish wound into the earth.

01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:05.160
To the Haruspex, the Polyhedron caused the plague

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:08.660
and it should be destroyed so the town can heal.

I like these two divergent climaxes.

Both characters have such different perspectives

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:22.160
and experiences that you can see how they came

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:24.160
to the conclusions they did, and it highlights

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:25.660
their differing philosophies about the world

01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:26.660
and how to live in it.

Dankofsky wants to transcend the flesh

shields you from the plague,

01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:46.660

They get written off, not just by his version of medicine,

01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:57.660
but the town itself has to die for him to be certain

01:25:57.660 --> 01:25:59.160
the plague is dead with it.

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:00.660
He'd rather destroy something

01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:02.160
than risk it spreading the disease,

and yet it was never enough to actually save

01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:12.160
most of the people of the town.

01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:14.160
Artemy is a polar opposite.

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:16.160
He's more concerned with curing the sick

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.660
than protecting the healthy.

even killing innocent people,

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:35.660
that failed to prevent the plague early on

01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:37.160
and invented the structure

01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:39.160
that caused it all in the first place.

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:40.660
A lot of this stuff is very ambiguous.

01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:42.160
There's a lot of ways of looking at it,

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.660
but at least in my interpretation,

01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:46.160
the game seems very concerned with the tensions

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:48.660
between the utopian dream of a better world

01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:51.160
and the actual people who have to build it

01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:53.660
and live through the follies that come with these projects.

01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:56.660
It's hard not to notice this Russian game's parallels

01:26:56.660 --> 01:26:58.160
with the history of the Soviet Union.

01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:00.660
As for the changeling, ah, I can't be bothered.

I mean, come on, do I really need to do

01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:05.160
a third 20-hour playthrough and then explain all of that?

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:07.160
I'm sure nothing that interesting happens in it.

01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:09.160
These endings don't just happen on their own, however.

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:11.660
Left to its own devices, at the end of the 12th day,

01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:14.160
the army destroys everything and the bad ending happens.

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:16.660
In order for your character to successfully get their ending,

01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:18.660
none of their bound can be sick.

01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:20.660
They have to prove that they're a good doctor,

01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:23.160
which means doing the main quest on time every day,

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:26.160
and if you didn't, you have to cure the ones that got sick.

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:28.660
You can do this by using the panaceas or schmowders

01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:30.160
you found over the course of the run,

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:31.660
so if you didn't use them yourself

01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:33.660
or sell them for tons of cash,

01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:36.160
they're a kind of get-out-of-bad-ending-free card

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:37.660
per person who got ill.

01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:39.660
If you prove you've done your duty as a doctor,

01:27:39.660 --> 01:27:42.160
you're let into the cathedral to argue your case,

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:44.660
and when the day ends, you get your character's ending.

The first thing they do is point out

01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:57.160
the children aren't real either,

01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:58.660

You're literally playing a game.

01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:11.660
The whole point is that games feel real

01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:13.160
even though they aren't.

01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:15.160
That's what suspension of disbelief is.

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:17.160
You never really believe a game is real,

01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:19.660

01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:25.660
just to make you wonder why that twist hurts

01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:28.160
when it's just telling you something you already knew.

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:30.160

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:31.660
I love this so much.

01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:33.660
You even get to pick whether to talk

01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:35.660
as the character or as yourself.

01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:37.160
God, this is cool.

01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:39.160
In reality, all games are a conversation

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:41.160
between you and the developers.

01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:44.160
All Pathologic does is rip down the curtain at the end

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:46.160
and show you that's what it was

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:47.660
and tell you that's okay.

01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:49.660

I'm still reeling from this.

01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:00.660
Even writing the script after playing the game

01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:02.660
and even saying it now,

01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:04.660
I'm just, ah, I love this.

I can't even communicate it,

It's so good.

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:12.160
Anyway, time to go pick my ending.

01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:13.660

What the fuck was happening in the changeling story?

01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:47.160
So, it's all about trickery to you?

01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:48.660
No.

01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:50.160
No.

01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:52.160
I detest trickery,

01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:55.660
but if we ourselves are to suffer deception,

01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:57.660
our hands are no longer tied.

01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:04.660
Clara begins by waking up in a shallow grave.

01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:06.660
The executors tell you you're going to be mistaken

01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:09.660
for a murderer and a thief, but also a miracle worker,

01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:12.160
and your reputation is always going to drop.

01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:15.160
Clara is immediately adopted by Katerina Saburov,

01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:17.660
the semi-magical lady and wife of the governor.

01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:20.160
She sees her appearance as a sign of divine providence

01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:22.160
who will do great things for the town

01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:24.160
and believes you have magical healing powers.

01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:26.160
You also hear that someone with your description

01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:27.660
is thought of as a thief in the town,

01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:29.160
and someone matching your appearance

01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:31.160
was said to have killed Simon or Isidore.

01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:33.660
Clara replies, yes, she is a good person,

01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:35.160
and the bad things she'd heard

01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:37.660
must have been her identical twin sister.

01:35:37.660 --> 01:35:41.160
Huh. Is that an in-character fact about us?

01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:43.160
Or did our character just tell a lie?

01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:45.160
Well, it's both.

01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:46.660
How is that possible?

01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:47.660
Fuck you!

01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:49.160
The Saburovs task Clara

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:50.660
with proving she has healing powers.

01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:52.660
You hear there's been some violence out in the steppe.

01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:55.660
Some guys tried to stop a murderer escaping the town

01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:56.660
and got fucked up.

01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:58.160
That sounds weirdly familiar.

01:35:58.160 --> 01:35:59.660
And while you're there, you probably get into a fight

01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:01.660
with the looters, and here's where you find out

01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:03.660
that Clara's combat is hilariously terrible.

01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:05.160
I mean that literally.

01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:07.660
I was cackling when I discovered how shit this is.

01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:09.660
Clara doesn't have a fist-fighting animation.

01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:11.160
Instead, she kind of waves her hands around

01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:12.660
all magic-like.

01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:15.160
It's a very slow attack, and it does even less damage

01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:16.660
than the previous character's attacks.

01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:18.160
Oh, and she has tiny hands,

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:20.160
so she can't use any weapons or guns

01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:22.160
except for one shitty gun that sucks.

01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:24.160
So good luck in fights, says Clara.

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:28.160
45 hours and two earth-shattering revelations in,

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:31.160
and the game's still finding ways to destroy me.

01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:32.660
This is the devs saying,

01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:34.660
okay, we know you've probably figured out

01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:36.660
how to fight in this game now,

01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:38.660
so what if it was even harder?

01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:40.660
From any kind of typical design standpoint,

01:36:40.660 --> 01:36:43.160
this combat is horrendous, but it works

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:45.160
because at this point, you know the developers

01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:46.660
are just messing with you for fun.

01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:48.660
It's like when a close friend is rude to you

01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:50.660
but in a cute way you both think is funny.

01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:52.160
That's the kind of friendship you have

01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:53.660
with the developers now.

01:36:53.660 --> 01:36:55.160
I mean, to even get here,

01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:56.660
you might have even met them already.

01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:58.660
You then find the injured man you're supposed to save,

01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:00.160
and you find out it's not a man.

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:02.160
It's, hey, remember this guy?

01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:03.160
In this version of the story,

01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:05.160
the Haruspex tried to kill the kid,

01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:07.160
and the kid was injured but got away

01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:09.160
because, you know, he's not as good at stuff

01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:10.660
when you're not in control, that sort of thing.

01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:12.660
From the kid's perspective and Clara's,

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:14.660
he's a monster who tried to kill a kid,

01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:17.160
but from being the Haruspex, you know what was on the line.

01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:18.160
It's cool storytelling.

01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:20.660
You see Artemy's side, but you also have to recognize

01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:22.660
that he's far from an innocent man here.

01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:24.160
Luckily, he doesn't have as much blood

01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:25.660
on his hands this time, it seems,

01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:27.660
especially since we're going to help the boy.

01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:29.660
Anyway, you lay on your hands to heal the kid

01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:31.660
and complete the quest for, oh, he's dead.

01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:34.160
So Clara's powers, if she has them at all,

01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:36.160
don't seem to quite work how you expect,

01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:38.160
at least not for healing traditional wounds.

01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:40.160
The man who was supposed to serve as a witness

01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:42.660
to your healing hands, far from assuming you're a charlatan

01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:44.160
or a demon or a murderer,

01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:46.160
actually still believes you're a hero though.

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:48.660
He decides the kid had been judged by your power

01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:51.160
as a sinner and then killed instead of healed.

01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:54.160
He thinks your power is the divine working through you

01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:55.660
in mysterious ways.

01:37:55.660 --> 01:37:58.660
Consider yourself purified.

01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:00.660
You still have to prove you can heal people,

01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:03.660
but he's basically sold on you as a divine being.

01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:06.660
I'm not sure how to feel about this version of the story.

01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:09.660
In a really good way, Haruspex made a very tough choice

01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:11.660
and had to live with it, but I think it might actually

01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:13.660
be even more bleak to have a story

01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:16.660
where a character tries to heal the child of their wounds,

01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:18.660
accidentally kills them, and is heralded

01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:20.660
as a miraculous hero anyway.

01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:22.660
I love this stuff. It's horrible.

01:38:22.660 --> 01:38:24.160
It makes my skin crawl.

01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:26.160
With the harder fighting and the constantly

01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:28.660
lowering reputation you have to actively keep up

01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:31.160
by doing good things, the game is pathologic

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:33.160
at its most pathologicist.

01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:35.160
You have to do good things all the time.

01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:37.160
Give money away, give up on your medicine,

01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:39.660
kill baddies with your awful attacks, and so on.

01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:41.660
Bachelor has a hard spike on day two,

01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:44.160
and Haruspex has two hard spikes at the beginning

01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:46.160
and partway through when he gets captured,

01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:48.160
but Clara is constantly swimming

01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:50.160
against a current of negative press.

01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:52.160
Someone who looks exactly like her

01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:54.160
has done a lot of bad things.

01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:56.160
You have a new set of Bound, of course,

01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:57.660
all the remaining main characters

01:38:57.660 --> 01:38:59.660
who weren't in the first two's care.

01:38:59.660 --> 01:39:01.660
As always, your job is to protect them

01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:03.160
from getting infected or dying.

01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:05.160
Wait, the Foreman of the Abattoir?

01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:06.660
Oh, that's not gonna end well.

01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:09.160
Clara's story has a lot of little extra things in it

01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:11.160
to learn about character relationships and choices.

01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:13.160
Lots of them are too small to go into depth about,

01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:15.160
but at times it was like a victory lap,

01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:18.160
the writers creating an extra post-playthrough story

01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:20.160
for a character with a magical ability

01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:22.660
that justifies them learning all kinds of new things.

01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:25.160
It's another way of exploring the richness of the story.

01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:27.160
You're still interacting with and causing the story

01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:28.660
to play out the way it does,

01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:30.160
but you have the strongest idea

01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:31.660
of why it all worked out now

01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:33.160
with two stories worth of hindsight.

01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:34.660
When you talk to the Foreman

01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:36.160
who gave the Haruspex so much trouble

01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:38.160
and help him verify Artemy is a legitimate heir

01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:40.660
to his position, this conversation causes him

01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:42.660
to devise the trials he tormented you with

01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:44.660
when you were playing the other story.

01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:47.160
He comes up with them on purpose to get rid of Artemy.

01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:49.660
Thanks, Clara, which is how it felt like as the Haruspex,

01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:51.660
but getting that confirmation is really something.

01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:53.660
On top of that, the thing where the other player characters

01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:56.160
are worse at their jobs is cranked all the way up.

01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:57.660
After the first few days,

01:39:57.660 --> 01:39:59.160
the Bachelor and Haruspex's relationship

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:00.660
breaks down so bad,

01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:02.660
they're actively trying to hunt each other down

01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:04.160
for much of the story.

01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:05.660
You get letters from their allies asking you

01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:07.660
to find them and warn them the other is coming for them,

01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:09.660
and you can even rat their locations out to each other

01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:11.160
for money and medicine.

01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:12.660
It's fun seeing how the worst possible

01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:14.160
of their timelines plays out

01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:15.660
when you aren't stopping either of them

01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:17.160
from being jerks.

01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:18.660
That said, it's clear that Clara

01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:20.660
is the most rushed of the stories.

01:40:20.660 --> 01:40:23.160
You can tell mainly because a lot of the side quests

01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:25.160
are the same side quest each day.

01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:26.660
For the second half of the game,

01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:28.160
you have three side quests every day,

01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:29.660
and they're always the same.

01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:31.160
Two of them are to warn the Bachelor and Haruspex

01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:33.160
about each other, and the third, well,

01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:34.660
Clara starts getting letters

01:40:34.660 --> 01:40:36.660
or possibly dream messages,

01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:39.160
but it's in the letters menu, from her twin sister,

01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:41.160
the evil Clara who is hiding out

01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:42.660
somewhere new in the town each day.

01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:44.660
If you don't find her based on cryptic messages

01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:47.160
and get her to leave, which takes a lot of sleuthing

01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:48.660
and running around infected houses,

01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:50.160
the district she was hiding in

01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:52.660
will be permanently infected for the rest of the game.

01:40:52.660 --> 01:40:55.160
It's creepy talking to your own character too.

01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:56.660
Whenever you find her in a house,

01:40:56.660 --> 01:40:58.160
she's always facing away from you,

01:40:58.160 --> 01:40:59.660
and it's super weird.

01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:01.160
Dodging the plague in houses

01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:04.160
to find a weird copy of yourself is great stuff.

01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:06.160
You then also have to scare away her followers

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:07.660
who are hiding out in very hidden places

01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:09.660
you won't think to look, and if you don't,

01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:11.160
that area gets infected too.

01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:12.660
So after the halfway point,

01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:15.160
every day these are your three side quests.

01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:17.160
They're always the same with the slight variation

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:19.160
being the house that the Bachelor and Haruspex

01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:21.160
reach hiding in is a different place each day.

01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:23.160
You only get given vague ideas of where they are

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:24.660
and you have to look around yourself,

01:41:24.660 --> 01:41:26.660
and Clara's letters are actually quite cool puzzles,

01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:29.160
I guess, to figure out where exactly she is in the town

01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:30.660
based on your intuition and knowledge of the town

01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:32.160
from two full playthroughs.

01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:34.660
It's quite interesting, but having all three side quests

01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:36.160
be the same one each day

01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:38.660
with no real advancement of the plot really gets to me.

01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:41.660
The other characters had serious cool subplot stuff,

01:41:41.660 --> 01:41:43.660
but Clara just gets busy work.

01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:45.660
I started to skip these quests after a few days.

01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:47.660
There's also very little communication

01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:50.160
that you can heal infected people as Clara.

01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:51.660
Oh, did I mention that?

01:41:51.660 --> 01:41:53.160
I didn't mention it earlier on purpose

01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:54.660
because the game sure didn't.

01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:56.160
When you use your hands on the infected,

01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:57.660
it plays a different animation

01:41:57.660 --> 01:42:00.160
and you get reputation back and they do a little bow.

01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:01.660
It costs some health too, I guess.

01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:04.160
So it's another thing you can do to keep your reputation up

01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:05.660
and it's also a cool trade-off

01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:07.160
because you lose health for doing it as well

01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:08.660
and there's a risk of getting infected

01:42:08.660 --> 01:42:10.160
while you're in those districts doing this,

01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:11.660
but I don't remember being tutorialized

01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:13.660
or told by the game you can do this.

01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:16.160
I only know about this from other videos mentioning it.

01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:18.660
I know Pathologic is a game that prides itself

01:42:18.660 --> 01:42:21.160
on not conveying stuff and letting you figure things out,

01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:24.160
but from a design perspective, this feels like a misstep.

01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:26.160
I feel like if they'd had more time or resources,

01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:27.660
they'd have made this much clearer.

01:42:27.660 --> 01:42:29.160
I mean, they seem to give the implication

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:31.160
Clara's attack is an attack.

01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:32.660
You use it to kill people

01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:34.660
and it kills the first person you try to heal

01:42:34.660 --> 01:42:36.660
and the first person you actually heal

01:42:36.660 --> 01:42:38.160
happens in a cut scene.

01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:40.660
They do the opposite of letting you know you can do this

01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:42.660
and this only works on these characters too,

01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:44.660
not the people who appear to be in the early stages

01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:46.660
of infection. They just drop dead.

01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:48.660
Like I said earlier, for the HD edition,

01:42:48.660 --> 01:42:50.660
all the character audio was re-recorded,

01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:53.160
but in Clara's scenario, specifically for Katarina

01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:55.660
on around day three, for some reason,

01:42:55.660 --> 01:42:58.160
one of the old voice actor's lines is still in there.

01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:00.660
Nothing threatens your daughter.

01:43:00.660 --> 01:43:03.660
Everyone will die but you will remain.

01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:06.160
I feel like this sort of oversight probably happened

01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:08.160
because development of Clara was rushed

01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:10.160
even for the HD version

01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:12.660
and an old line slipped through and didn't get caught,

01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:15.160
which makes sense. A very small amount of players

01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:16.660
ever get to the point this could happen,

01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:18.160
and I'm glad they spent the time elsewhere

01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:20.160
instead of triple checking all the voice lines

01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:22.160
for every character for every character's story,

01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:23.660
but it's at least a good indicator

01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:25.160
of how generally rushed

01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:26.660
some of the changeling's stuff is.

01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:29.160
It's a minor thing but it points to the major thing

01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:31.160
or at the very least I noticed it and I want to pretend

01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:32.660
that I can make a point out of it.

01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:34.660
Overall, if you were interested in Pathologic's story,

01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:36.660
Clara's route is really satisfying.

01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:38.660
If you're not, it's just more text

01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:41.660
and combat even more frustrating than before

01:43:41.660 --> 01:43:44.160
and yet more walking, but it's much more rewarding

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:46.160
in forthcoming with information than the others.

01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:47.660
You put the work in.

01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:49.660
You played 20 to 40 hours of story.

01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:52.160
Now lots of the missing pieces you were curious about

01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:53.160
can get filled in.

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:55.160
The story isn't pulling its punches either.

01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:57.160
They know you've already played the game once.

01:43:57.160 --> 01:43:59.160
I love a lot of sequels to movies and games

01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:00.660
where they don't need to reestablish

01:44:00.660 --> 01:44:02.160
or explain the simpler stuff.

01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:04.160
They can just go nuts with established material

01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:06.160
and ideas and this really hits that spot.

01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:08.160
It gets kind of meta toward the end too,

01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:10.160
so it's all about trickery to you?

01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:11.660
Wherever have you come from?

01:44:11.660 --> 01:44:13.660
No, I detest trickery.

01:44:13.660 --> 01:44:16.160
If we ourselves are to suffer deception,

01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:18.160
our hands are no longer tied.

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:20.160
It's like Clara kind of knows what's happening

01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:21.660
without having to be told.

01:44:21.660 --> 01:44:23.660
Some of her text options imply information

01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:25.660
she never even learns herself,

01:44:25.660 --> 01:44:27.660
but you know it from the other stories.

01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:30.160
This is some Malkavian shit right here.

01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:32.160
God, I should really make that vampire video

01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:33.160
I teased years ago.

01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:35.160
It's on the pile somewhere.

01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:37.160
Hey, you, what are you doing out of your cage?

01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:39.160
I'll get to you!

01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:41.160
It even starts to become clear what the story

01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:44.160
might really have been about all along.

01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:47.160
Like, what does the Polyhedron actually do?

01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:49.160
People say it can store dreams

01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:51.160
so people can revisit them and share them

01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:54.160
or trap a soul and keep a dead person alive,

01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:55.160
but what does that mean?

01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:57.160
Are souls literal things

01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:59.660
or an ephemeral conceptual thing?

01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:01.660
The idea of someone,

01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:03.660
the presence they can manifest

01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:05.160
through the effects of actions

01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:06.660
from while they were alive?

01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:10.160
Is a piece of my soul in this video?

01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:12.660
Perhaps even surviving after my death?

01:45:12.660 --> 01:45:15.160
I put a lot of myself in my work.

01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:17.660
Am I immortal now?

01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:21.160
In a sense, maybe I am.

01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:24.160
I'm going to say the word now.

01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:26.160
Now.

01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:28.660
When did I say that?

01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:31.160
Looking at the clock, it's 416 a.m.

01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:34.160
on the 9th of November, 2019,

01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:37.160
but when did I really say it?

01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:40.660
I, now, will be 27

01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:43.660
and talking about pathologic forever,

01:45:43.660 --> 01:45:46.660
even if you come back in another 27 years.

01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:50.160
Maybe I'm immortal and freed from earthly flesh

01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:52.660
by existing in the form of a video.

01:45:52.660 --> 01:45:54.660
Maybe the opposite is true.

01:45:54.660 --> 01:45:57.160
Maybe I'm trapped here forever

01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:59.660
and maybe this is worse than being dead.

01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:00.660
Ahem.

01:46:00.660 --> 01:46:02.660
Forgive me if my speech is unclear or absurd.

01:46:02.660 --> 01:46:04.660
You have a lot more in-depth conversations

01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:07.160
along these philosophical and spiritual lines,

01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:09.660
and to me now, the Polyhedron feels like a metaphor

01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:11.160
for video games themselves.

01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:12.660
The rest of the town represents

01:46:12.660 --> 01:46:15.160
the down-to-earth, day-to-day, boring reality

01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:17.160
of walking to places, talking to people,

01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:19.660
getting lied to, being a regular person,

01:46:19.660 --> 01:46:21.660
eating food, getting sick sometimes,

01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:24.160
and eventually dying, but in video games,

01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:26.160
in art, death isn't real.

01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:27.660
You can be whoever you like.

01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:29.660
Games are stories, but more than that,

01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:31.660
a way for people to share their stories

01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:33.660
with others forever, to take part in them

01:46:33.660 --> 01:46:35.660
and live on past the boundaries

01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:37.660
of their simple material existence.

01:46:37.660 --> 01:46:40.160
Everyone who made Pathologic will be dead one day,

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:43.160
but they'll still be here in this world they made,

01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:45.660
staring out at you in eternal polygons,

01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:48.660
talking to you, sharing their ideas and feelings,

01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:52.160
a hand reaching from the grave to grasp you once more.

01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:55.660
Art is the road to awe, to permanent expression,

01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:58.160
and games are a collaborative expression too.

01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:01.160
You're playing it, interacting, being in it.

01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:02.660
This game is made for you.

01:47:02.660 --> 01:47:04.160
Aren't you a part of it?

01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:05.660
This game is a reminder of the immense

01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:07.660
spiritual value of games,

01:47:07.660 --> 01:47:10.160
to be somewhere else and move and act in it,

01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:13.160
to be a piece of someone else's vision for a moment.

01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:15.660
The Polyhedron represents the uplifting,

01:47:15.660 --> 01:47:18.660
unrealistic, and yet truly real power

01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:21.160
imbued upon us by our ability to have dreams,

01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:23.160
literally and figuratively.

01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:24.660
That's just how it reads to me, though.

01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:26.660
It certainly feels that way at times.

01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:28.160
Speaking of the Polyhedron,

01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:30.160
when you visit there as Clara partway through,

01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:31.660
you get to descend to the bottom

01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:33.160
and meet the gods of the world

01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:35.160
several days earlier than the other characters.

01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:38.160
They're genuinely shocked to see you this time.

01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:40.160
It's like Clara herself has more power

01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:42.160
than the creators thought she would,

01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:44.160
and here explains why Clara is the way she is,

01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:46.660
why there's such confusion about her nature,

01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:48.160
why there's two of her.

01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:49.660
The powers that be are in disagreement

01:47:49.660 --> 01:47:51.160
over who she is and what she's doing.

01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:52.660
One of them thinks she's a thief,

01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:54.160
and the other thinks that she is some kind

01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:55.660
of divine being in their story.

01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:57.160
I think this is actually really clever.

01:47:57.160 --> 01:47:59.660
The powers that be are having competing interpretations

01:47:59.660 --> 01:48:01.160
of this character they've made.

01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:03.160
Clara's quest eventually leads to the discovery

01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:04.660
of how her healing hands work.

01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:06.660
They transform people's blood,

01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:09.160
give them something that can protect them from the disease,

01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:11.160
and if she uses it on stronger people,

01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:13.160
for example, her bound, if they're sacrificed

01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:14.660
and their blood is taken,

01:48:14.660 --> 01:48:17.160
it can be used to make many cures for the plague,

01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:18.660
so she can get seven of her bound

01:48:18.660 --> 01:48:20.660
to agree to atone for their sins

01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:23.160
by being sacrificed to save the town.

01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:24.660
When you describe this to Foreman Oyun,

01:48:24.660 --> 01:48:27.160
he sees it as a chance to undo the damage he's caused

01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:29.160
and agrees wholeheartedly.

01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:30.660
He tells you to tell the Haruspex

01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:32.160
to not bother with the final trial,

01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:33.660
the one where he jumps into a hole and dies,

01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:35.160
since he no longer needs to kill him

01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:37.160
to protect his position in the kin.

01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:38.660
You can straight up ask him what happens

01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:40.160
if he'd gone in the hole,

01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:41.660
and he tells you he would have died

01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:44.160
because, yeah, it's a big hole.

01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:45.660
I left this out when I was talking about

01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:47.160
the Haruspex for dramatic effect,

01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:48.660
but I don't want to not mention it.

01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:50.660
As the Haruspex, you do get Clara cryptically offering

01:48:50.660 --> 01:48:52.660
to assist you, and if you agree,

01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:55.160
when you go in the hole, you instead get this cool scene

01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:58.160
where you can see your own corpse surrounded by executors

01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:00.160
and you can choose someone from Clara's bound

01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:01.660
to die in your place.

01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:04.160
Artemy survives by doing this and then fights the Foreman,

01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:06.160
so it really was a spiritual experience,

01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:08.160
if you let the Changeling into your life at least.

01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:10.660
I guess this is because Clara in the Haruspex's story

01:49:10.660 --> 01:49:12.160
doesn't get her shit together enough

01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:14.160
to realize she can use Oyun to solve

01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:16.160
the plague problem directly herself.

01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:18.160
Anyway, it's very funny to me that in Clara's run,

01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:19.660
the Haruspex is genuinely prepping

01:49:19.660 --> 01:49:21.660
to jump into a hole and die.

01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:24.160
So Oyun and six others agree to make this sacrifice,

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:25.660
and that's her ending.

01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:27.160
The town and tower get preserved,

01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:29.160
but at the expense of people sometimes giving up

01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:30.660
their lives to maintain it.

01:49:30.660 --> 01:49:32.160
I like this ending. It feels like the reminder

01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:34.160
that for society to survive intact

01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:37.160
requires work and sacrifice to protect itself

01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:39.660
from its own internal tensions and contradictions.

01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:40.660
That sort of thing.

01:49:40.660 --> 01:49:43.160
Clara's map evolutions are suitably miraculous.

01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:45.660
Instead of either the town or the tower being monstrous,

01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:49.160
the tower is a part of the town harboring some new thing,

01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:51.160
a dream, a life, the future,

01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:52.660
and the town is feeding it.

01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:55.660
It's a symbiotic relationship which takes sacrifice

01:49:55.660 --> 01:49:57.660
but which might be worth preserving,

01:49:57.660 --> 01:50:00.660
and the sky is dreamlike reflecting either Clara's

01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:03.160
more miraculous, fantastical perspective

01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:06.160
or her knowledge that the world really is a dream of sorts.

01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:08.160
Clara's first extra ending is nothing special.

01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:10.160
You've already met them once in this playthrough,

01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:12.160
so there's no real revelation here.

01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:13.660
Hey, guys, it's me again.

01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:16.660
Third time round now. How's it going?

01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:21.160
Whoa, fuck.

01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:22.660
Okay, that's cool.

01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:24.660
The game keeps being meta about all the things

01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:25.660
I think it won't address.

01:50:25.660 --> 01:50:27.160
Like, just when meeting the developers

01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:29.160
was starting to become a repetitive idea,

01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:31.660
here it is getting one-upped by the third go-round

01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:33.660
making fun of how that's starting to feel,

01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:35.660
and here in the game, Clara kind of validates

01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:37.660
my thoughts about the town and the polyhedron,

01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:39.660
talking about these characters as if they're fragments

01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:42.160
of real people, and in a way,

01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:44.160
I really do feel like I know these people now.

01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:46.660
I've spent a lot of time with them in their world

01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:48.160
experiencing their creation.

01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:49.660
You can even ask them more directly

01:50:49.660 --> 01:50:51.160
what the other characters' stories

01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:52.660
were supposed to be about.

01:50:52.660 --> 01:50:54.660
It's a fantastic send-off getting to discuss the story

01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:56.660
with its creators.

01:50:56.660 --> 01:50:59.660
Holy shit, that's so fucking cool.

01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:02.660
I talked about this earlier. It is on purpose.

01:51:02.660 --> 01:51:04.660
Oh, man, this is great. I love this.

01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:06.660
I utterly love this. This is the best thing ever,

01:51:06.660 --> 01:51:08.660
and it's so tiny, so small.

01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:11.160
It's the devs showing you all the little tricks

01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:13.660
they used to make you frustrated and trapped

01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:17.160
right there being complained about by you.

01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:19.160
Ah, God, it's excellent.

01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:21.160
You can ask what their plan was with the changeling,

01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:22.660
and they make a joke about how rushed

01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:24.160
and slapped together it was.

01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:26.160
That's fun. I like that they're acknowledging things

01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:28.660
the player would definitely have noticed about this by now.

01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:30.660
It feels personal and real.

01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:32.160
They're not resting on their laurels

01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:34.160
and being pretentious about themes or ideas.

01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:36.660
They're apologizing for things they knew they got wrong

01:51:36.660 --> 01:51:38.160
and even making a joke at the expense

01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:40.160
of this own indulgent last part.

01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:42.660
What a great ending. God, I've loved the story of this.

01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:44.660
I wish I could have gone into more detail about it,

01:51:44.660 --> 01:51:46.660
but just talking about the things that jumped out to me

01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:48.160
the most has taken this long.

01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:49.660
It's been genuinely super awesome.

01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:52.160
Even though it's all fake, it's all just a kid's game,

01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:54.660
and on top of that, it's all just a video game,

01:51:54.660 --> 01:51:56.660
I feel a sense of achievement for having stuck with it

01:51:56.660 --> 01:51:58.660
in a strange way. Also, I quite like how hard

01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:00.660
you have to work to achieve the actual good ending.

01:52:00.660 --> 01:52:03.160
Like, the Bachelor's ending is just, like, fucked.

01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:05.660
He's such a shithead, and the Haruspex's ending

01:52:05.660 --> 01:52:08.160
does kind of destroy a really awesome, cool invention.

01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:10.660
It's only by actually playing through the whole game

01:52:10.660 --> 01:52:13.160
at least twice that you get the chance

01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:15.660
to really get a decent ending for people.

01:52:15.660 --> 01:52:17.660
Breathe it in.

01:52:17.660 --> 01:52:19.160
Actually, no, don't breathe it in.

01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:20.660
You didn't have to play the whole game.

01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:21.660
You just listened to me talk about it

01:52:21.660 --> 01:52:23.660
for a couple hours. Fuck you.

01:52:23.660 --> 01:52:25.660
There are fine things, old boy,

01:52:25.660 --> 01:52:28.160
which are more brilliant when unfinished

01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:31.160
than when finished too much.

01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:34.160
So Pathologic does a lot of very clever things

01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:37.160
to make you feel a way games rarely even try

01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:38.660
to make people feel,

01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:40.660
and I think it achieves its goals fairly well.

01:52:40.660 --> 01:52:43.160
It's an experience I have a hard time recommending

01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:44.660
and which I know to be flawed,

01:52:44.660 --> 01:52:47.160
but which I'm extremely glad I played in full.

01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:48.660
Pathologic is the antidote

01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:51.160
to the entire modern game design ethos.

01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:53.160
It isn't a skinner box that rewards you

01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:56.660
with simpler satisfactions like beautiful splatter graphics

01:52:56.660 --> 01:52:58.660
when you get a headshot or a quest

01:52:58.660 --> 01:53:00.660
that makes you feel heroic and powerful.

01:53:00.660 --> 01:53:03.660
It makes you stare at the abyss of human cruelty

01:53:03.660 --> 01:53:06.160
and ignorance and dares you to blink,

01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:08.160
to close the game and give up.

01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:10.160
I can't think of many other games that manage that.

01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:13.160
I super love this game and its world.

01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:15.660
Even though I don't think I'll ever want to touch it again

01:53:16.660 --> 01:53:18.160
I'm glad I did it all,

01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:19.160
and I feel like I've learned a lot

01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:20.660
about the potential of games

01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:23.160
and the many unique ways games can have

01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:24.660
all kinds of effects on you.

01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:27.660
All that said, and I've said it so much in this video,

01:53:27.660 --> 01:53:30.660
I'm not making this to recommend a 15-year-old game.

01:53:30.660 --> 01:53:32.660
I'm making it because I couldn't recommend

01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:34.160
this 15-year-old game.

01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:36.660
I could barely even recommend it to myself.

01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:38.660
It took years to get around to playing it

01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:40.160
past the first couple hours.

01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:41.660
I had a really interesting time,

01:53:41.660 --> 01:53:44.660
but 65 hours is a long time to spend

01:53:44.660 --> 01:53:46.660
to eventually have an interesting time,

01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:48.660
and I couldn't in good conscience

01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:51.660
inflict that on someone else by telling them to try it.

01:53:51.660 --> 01:53:54.660
Especially not now.

01:53:54.660 --> 01:53:57.660
["Hidamare"]

01:53:57.660 --> 01:54:01.660
["Hidamare"]

01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:04.660
["Hidamare"]

01:54:04.660 --> 01:54:07.660
So, yeah, love Pathologic.

01:54:07.660 --> 01:54:08.660
Amazing game.

01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:10.660
One of the best games ever.

01:54:10.660 --> 01:54:12.660
Artistic masterpiece, but don't play it.

01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:13.660
It sucks.

01:54:13.660 --> 01:54:15.660
Luckily, there exists a game that does everything

01:54:15.660 --> 01:54:18.160
Pathologic 1 does wrong right.

01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:21.160
A game I can recommend so, so much more.

01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:23.660
That game is Pathologic 2.

01:54:23.660 --> 01:54:25.660
You don't have to play one to understand two,

01:54:25.660 --> 01:54:27.660
especially not now that I've told you everything

01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:28.660
you need to know about it.

01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:30.660
When I sat down to play Pathologic 2,

01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:33.660
I cynically assumed it would be a compromised version of one,

01:54:33.660 --> 01:54:35.660
graphically and technically improved

01:54:35.660 --> 01:54:38.660
but lacking the sorts of bold design elements

01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:40.660
that contributed to making the original so unique.

01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:43.660
Like, making a game like Pathologic more accessible

01:54:43.660 --> 01:54:45.660
and understanding for a newer audience,

01:54:45.660 --> 01:54:47.660
making it more engaging to play even,

01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:49.660
would surely mitigate what it did best.

01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:52.660
I've never assumed so wrong.

01:54:52.660 --> 01:54:55.160
It's even more horrifying, even harder,

01:54:55.160 --> 01:54:58.160
and a massive step forward in every possible way.

01:54:58.160 --> 01:54:59.160
Except the music.

01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:00.660
The music in 1 is better in my opinion,

01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:02.660
but the music is still incredible stuff.

01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:05.660
Like, top 10 best music in games, no question.

01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:07.660
The creators made good on maintaining

01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:10.160
the atmosphere and feel while removing the bugs

01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:11.660
and elements that were truly bad

01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:13.160
and took away from the experience.

01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:14.660
They even threw in meta stuff

01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:16.160
for people who played the first

01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:18.160
or even people who knew the twists from the first.

01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:20.160
I learned painstakingly the hard way

01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:22.160
and you just learned easily over one video.

01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:26.160
Perhaps, finally, after all these long years,

01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:28.160
the deep game is here.

01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:32.160
Well, almost here because Pathologic 2 isn't done yet.

01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:34.160
It's not in early access per se

01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:35.660
but not only is it still getting

01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:37.660
what I'd say are critical bug fixes,

01:55:37.660 --> 01:55:39.660
for example, an update while I was making this video

01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:41.160
solved the performance problems

01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:42.660
I would have talked about right now,

01:55:42.660 --> 01:55:44.160
so nice one there,

01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:46.160
but only one of the game's original stories

01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:48.160
is in this version, at least right now.

01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:49.660
The Haruspex.

01:55:49.660 --> 01:55:51.660
It's still a full game because Pathologic

01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:53.660
was three full games already basically,

01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:56.160
but they're going to add more if they can afford to.

01:55:56.160 --> 01:55:58.660
I'd buy the others as DLC or expansions, frankly.

01:55:58.660 --> 01:56:00.660
There was a demo, the Marble Nest,

01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:02.660
a few years ago where you play as the Bachelor for a day

01:56:02.660 --> 01:56:04.660
and they just patched that into the main game

01:56:04.660 --> 01:56:06.660
as an improved version of itself

01:56:06.660 --> 01:56:08.160
and that's awesome too,

01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:11.660
and yes, the Bachelor is even more of a shit.

01:56:11.660 --> 01:56:13.160
I love him.

01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:16.160
Truth does not do as much good in the world

01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:18.160
as its counterfeits do evil.

01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:19.660
God, what a great character.

01:56:19.660 --> 01:56:21.160
I love him so much.

01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:23.160
He's just, he's so well written

01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:24.660
as an insufferable fucker.

01:56:24.660 --> 01:56:26.160
Oh, man, he's great.

01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:28.160
I swear to God I'm gonna cosplay as him

01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:29.160
first chance I get.

01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:31.660
Pathologic 2 isn't exactly a block puh...

01:56:31.660 --> 01:56:32.660
there.

01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:34.160
Sorry, I've spent hours and hours

01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:35.660
recording this voiceover.

01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:37.660
The game isn't exactly a blockbuster,

01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:38.660
smash hit.

01:56:38.660 --> 01:56:40.160
It's a niche sequel

01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:42.160
to a barely known cult classic from Russia

01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:43.160
a decade ago,

01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:45.160
loved mostly by native Russian speakers

01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:47.160
and Western pretentious nerd critics.

01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:49.160
That's not a jab at pretentious nerd critics.

01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:50.160
I'm one of those.

01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:51.660
Did you hear that fucking bit

01:56:51.660 --> 01:56:53.160
about this video having a soul?

01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:54.660
Come on, let's not pretend I'm any better,

01:56:54.660 --> 01:56:56.160
but even if we love it,

01:56:56.160 --> 01:56:58.160
we're not exactly a huge demographic.

01:56:58.160 --> 01:57:00.660
I don't tend to do calls to action in my videos.

01:57:00.660 --> 01:57:02.660
I like to let people make up their own minds

01:57:02.660 --> 01:57:04.160
about what to do with their lives

01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:05.660
or whether a game is for them.

01:57:05.660 --> 01:57:07.160
If you play Pathologic 1

01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:10.160
after I deliberately didn't recommend it,

01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:11.160
congratulations.

01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:12.660
You passed the true test

01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:14.160
by deciding to play the game for yourself,

01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:15.660
and I love you for that.

01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:17.160
Good luck with the fight with Bali,

01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:19.160
and on day one, you can find extra food

01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:20.660
left out on Nina's grave.

01:57:20.660 --> 01:57:22.160
Pretend I left that for you.

01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:23.660
Mwah. Keep the fact

01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:25.660
I didn't recommend the first game

01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:27.660
despite loving it in mind

01:57:27.660 --> 01:57:30.160
when I say you should buy Pathologic 2.

01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:31.660
It still might not be for you,

01:57:31.660 --> 01:57:34.660
but you absolutely must try it to find out,

01:57:34.660 --> 01:57:36.660
and in a world where mainstream games

01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:38.660
are starting to feel like they're converging

01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:41.160
upon the same Pavlovian uniform design

01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:43.160
with only minor branding variations,

01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:45.160
supporting independent work and true experiments

01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:47.160
with the form, even if they don't turn out

01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:48.660
to be something you personally like,

01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:51.160
seems like THE step forward for video games.

01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:53.160
The only other obvious step forward I can think of

01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:55.160
is starting a game developers union.

01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:57.660
Pathologic 1 is the best game you didn't play.

01:57:57.660 --> 01:58:00.660
It's the best game I almost didn't play,

01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:02.660
but Pathologic 2 is better,

01:58:02.660 --> 01:58:04.660
and you are going to play it.

01:58:04.660 --> 01:58:07.160
Go experience one of the most unique,

01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:10.660
satisfyingly hurtful experiences there is in gaming.

01:58:10.660 --> 01:58:12.160
I'd analyze it in detail,

01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:14.160
but that would require spoiling it,

01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:16.160
and you are going to play this,

01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:17.660
so I wouldn't do that to you.

01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:19.160
Not for a while, at least.

01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:20.660
I need time to collect data

01:58:20.660 --> 01:58:22.160
about other people's experiences

01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:24.660
and think about how it achieves the effects it does,

01:58:24.660 --> 01:58:27.160
and I want to play it all the way through three more times.

01:58:27.160 --> 01:58:28.660
Okay, everybody break.

01:58:28.660 --> 01:58:30.660
Go play Pathologic 2 and meet back here

01:58:30.660 --> 01:58:32.660
in, I don't know, six months to compare notes

01:58:32.660 --> 01:58:34.660
for my analysis of the sequel.

01:58:34.660 --> 01:58:36.160
Oh, and whatever you do,

01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:38.160
don't take the traveler's deal!

01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:41.160
You weren't supposed to take the deal, Brendan!

01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:53.660
♪♪

01:58:53.660 --> 01:58:56.160
Hey, thanks for watching all the way, friend.

01:58:56.160 --> 01:58:58.660
My videos are supported by my backers over on Patreon,

01:58:58.660 --> 01:59:00.160
and I love them for it.

01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:02.160
I used to do a thing where I read everyone out

01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:04.160
who backed a certain amount during the credits,

01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:06.160
but I have the best problem ever

01:59:06.160 --> 01:59:08.660
of there being too many people to do that,

01:59:08.660 --> 01:59:10.160
so I'm reading them out one last time

01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:11.660
before I change things over.

01:59:11.660 --> 01:59:14.160
In the future, people who back me $10 or more per video

01:59:14.160 --> 01:59:16.160
can vote on what my next video is.

01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:18.160
I'll have polls for what I feel like working on

01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:20.660
or based on ideas and suggestions you folks give me.

01:59:20.660 --> 01:59:22.660
I always want to do, like, four different things at once,

01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:25.160
so this will hopefully give me some more perspective.

01:59:25.160 --> 01:59:26.660
I'm amazed that I've somehow been

01:59:26.660 --> 01:59:28.160
as well-supported as I have,

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:30.660
and I'm eternally thankful for being able

01:59:30.660 --> 01:59:33.660
to do ridiculous things like get covered in soy,

01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:35.160
build and destroy a set,

01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:37.160
or spend almost a month playing and reading

01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:40.160
and writing about an old Russian video game masterpiece.

01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:42.160
With your continued support, I hope to do

01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:43.660
even more ridiculous things.

01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:45.160
So for the last time,

01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:46.660
at least for the foreseeable future,

01:59:46.660 --> 01:59:48.160
if I ever finish any of the video games

01:59:48.160 --> 01:59:49.660
I'm trying to make, I'll hide a reading

01:59:49.660 --> 01:59:51.160

01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:52.660
