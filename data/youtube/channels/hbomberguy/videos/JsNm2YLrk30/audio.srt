1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,160
Ha, great play Mark, it's a real...

2
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,160
KILLER!

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,660
**Laughter**

4
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,660
**Intro Music**

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,660
**Explosion**

6
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,660
Pathologic is one of the best and smartest games that's ever been made.

7
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,660
And you know that's true because no one's played it.

8
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,660
Okay, that's not quite accurate.

9
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,660
A fair amount of people have tried to play it.

10
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,660
The Steam release has achievements

11
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,160
and there's an achievement for surviving the first of the twelve in-game days.

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,660
A day lasts about two hours.

13
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,160
According to its global gameplay stats page,

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,660
just 13.2% of all players made it that far.

15
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,160
The achievement for day one is called

16
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,160
I'm Not Dead.

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,660
It's just that kind of game.

18
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,160
It occupies a certain kind of space in game criticism.

19
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,160
Some game critics, mostly the ones who are...

20
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,660
uh...good,

21
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,660
will sing its praises day and night,

22
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,660
call it the best game you've never played,

23
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,660
argue it's a shining bastion of everything gaming could be but often isn't,

24
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,160
and labor very intensely to explain why games don't have to be fun

25
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,160
to be good.

26
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,660
Journalist, board game critic,

27
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,160
and wizard Quentin Smith

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,160
wrote three incredible articles about it in 2008

29
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,160
for Rock Paper Shotgun,

30
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,160
which are probably hugely responsible

31
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,160
for a lot of Western awareness of the game.

32
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,660
But when someone reads articles like these,

33
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,160
they might make the horrendous mistake

34
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,660
of actually trying to play it,

35
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,160
and we all know how that goes, don't we?

36
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,660
The game's just not fun.

37
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,160
It's not interesting to look at.

38
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,160
It doesn't feel good to play mechanically.

39
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,160
It's frustrating.

40
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,660
The story is confusing and wordy

41
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,660
and translated from Russian by a mystical rat

42
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,160
who only speaks in riddles.

43
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,160
It lacks almost anything

44
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,660
that would normally keep a person playing a game,

45
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,160
and yet people keep saying it's great.

46
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,660
I think it's great too.

47
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,160
It's an incredible game

48
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,160
that barely anyone will have the resilience

49
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,160
to actually play long enough to appreciate,

50
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,160
and that's maybe even the point.

51
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,160
So this time on the assorted mess of unrelated concepts

52
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,160
that can scarcely be called a YouTube channel,

53
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,660
I'm going to talk about all the things

54
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,660
I find particularly interesting about this game

55
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,660
and what they bring to making it so unique.

56
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,660
I'm also going to talk about the problems it has

57
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,660
that prevented it from seeing mainstream success

58
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,160
and then give a spirited defense

59
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,660
of half of those problems anyway

60
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,660
in the name of their artistic value.

61
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,160
It's not a bad game.

62
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,160
It's an amazing game, but it's also a bad game.

63
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,160
It's a major time investment too.

64
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,160
In many ways, it's a more interesting game

65
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,660
to discuss than play.

66
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,660
It's possible that Pathologic only exists

67
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,160
so that we may speculate about it.

68
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,660
So in a way, making this video

69
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,660
is really for my benefit more than yours.

70
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,660
I played over 60 hours of this thing.

71
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,660
I have almost 600 gigs

72
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,660
of Pathologic footage on my hard drive.

73
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,660
I get to make a video about it!

74
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,160
That was the deal!

75
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,660
♪ ♪

76
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,160
Part one, what is Pathologic?

77
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,660
Probably should've gone in the intro.

78
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,160
On the surface, it's a very easy game to explain.

79
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,160
Pathologic is a first-person survival horror RPG

80
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,660
with story rich and atmospheric.

81
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,160
Doesn't it look fun?

82
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,660
It's set in a town deep in the Russian steppe

83
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,160
at some ambiguous point in the last 100 years,

84
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,660
and by ambiguous, I mean imaginary.

85
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,160
There are guns, but they're kind of old-timey types.

86
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,160
A lot of the decor ranges from the late 1800s

87
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,660
to early 1900s,

88
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,660
but there's some Baroque-looking buildings lying around.

89
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,660
The town is built around its meat industry,

90
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,660
so there's bowls everywhere, but the abattoir

91
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,660
is some kind of huge ancient building

92
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,160
fused with the earth,

93
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,660
and its workers live in a huge housing complex

94
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,660
that looks nothing like the rest of the town,

95
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,160
and some buildings are actively impossible

96
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,160
like these staircases to nowhere,

97
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,660
and then there's the Polyhedron,

98
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,160
a giant floating tower that cannot be

99
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,160
sticking out of the earth suspended by unknown means

100
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,660
and made partially out of its own blueprints,

101
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,160
so, yeah, I'd say the time period's pretty ambiguous.

102
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
You play as one of three different kinds of Doctor

103
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,160
who each arrive in the town for their own reasons

104
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,160
just at the beginning of the outbreak

105
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,660
of a horrible plague that threatens the entire town

106
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,160
and probably the world if it manages to spread.

107
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,660
The Doctors have 12 days to get their shit together,

108
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,160
save the town,

109
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,160
and somehow survive long enough to do that.

110
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,660
In some ways, it's kind of an immersive sim.

111
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,160
You have an inventory, weapons, clothes, and items,

112
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,160
but look at the wording of these items.

113
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,160
It's not food. It's rations.

114
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,160
It's not medicine or healing.

115
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,660
It's drugs, and what is other?

116
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,660
Well, that's where you keep less common stuff

117
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,160
you can use or sell like hairpins and bracelets

118
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,660
and flowers you picked, and are those human organs?

119
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,160
As soon as you hit new game,

120
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,160
it becomes clear that any simple description

121
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,160
of its basic genre conventions

122
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,660
doesn't capture how the game actually feels.

123
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,160
The three playable characters,

124
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,160
the Bachelor, the Haruspex, and the Changeling,

125
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,160
aren't simply chosen by a menu.

126
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,160
So it's all about trickery to you?

127
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,660
Wherever have you come from?

128
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,660
No. No.

129
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,660
I detest trickery,

130
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,160
but if we ourselves are to suffer deception,

131
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,660
our hands are no longer tied.

132
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,160
Where are we?

133
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,660
We open in a theater,

134
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,660
which you actually visit in the game world later,

135
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,160
looking down on all three characters

136
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,660
as they argue on stage over who is best suited

137
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,660
to solving the problem.

138
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,660
I can do miracles.

139
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,160
Just let me.

140
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,160
Will you please be quiet?

141
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,160
The dialogue gets across each character's basic viewpoint.

142
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,660
It's also written in a strangely theatrical way.

143
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,160
The truth is my shepherd.

144
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,160
I will perform the operation.

145
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,160
Medica morbo adhibe.

146
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,660
Don't you go all bossy on me, clever clogs.

147
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,660
This calls for the gentle hand of a surgeon.

148
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,160
Your gentle hands are used to killing,

149
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,160
not giving life.

150
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,160
You will inevitably do harm.

151
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,160
As for Brainy,

152
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,160
he has no regard for casualties at all.

153
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,660
It sounds written.

154
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,660
It's not even trying to be natural.

155
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,160
It's like you're watching bad actors

156
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,660
stumbling through their lines

157
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,160
while rehearsing for a play,

158
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,660
which you are.

159
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,160
The actual play is about to begin

160
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
with you playing as one of them.

161
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,660
They conclude they can't work together

162
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,160
and time is of the essence,

163
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,660
and the house lights go down.

164
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,160
We won't ever get along.

165
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,160
I suggest we be on our way.

166
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,660
The sooner the better.

167
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,160
Off we go then?

168
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
Let's go.

169
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
The clock is ticking.

170
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,160
When you go to leave the theater,

171
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,660
then you get to choose which one you play.

172
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,160
Even before the game started,

173
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
the presentation is strangely off-kilter

174
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,160
and brings in ideas of performance

175
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,160
and the theatrical.

176
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,160
It's definitely the weirdest character selection process

177
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
I've ever experienced.

178
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,660
You can't play as the changeling

179
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,660
until you've finished the game

180
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,660
as one of the first two,

181
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,160
but frankly, if you're actually going

182
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,660
to play the game more than once,

183
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,660
you should play both of the first two first

184
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,160
and really you ought to start with The Bachelor.

185
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,160
He's regarded as the default pathologic experience.

186
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,660
He's slightly easier,

187
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,660
and his character is an outsider from the town,

188
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,660
so you learn more about it from that perspective,

189
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,660
and that's really helpful.

190
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,160
The Bachelor, Daniil Dankovsky,

191
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,660
is a bachelor of medicine

192
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,160
and is working on the ultimate utopian project

193
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,660
a doctor can aspire to,

194
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,160
defeating death itself.

195
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,660
It's not going well.

196
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,160
The powers that be, and the government I guess,

197
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
are shutting down his lab

198
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,160
unless he can come up with something substantive

199
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,660
to back up his ideas.

200
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,160
He's come to the town because he's heard

201
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
that a man who lives there, Simon Cain,

202
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,660
has lived a remarkably long life,

203
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,160
so maybe he can learn something

204
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,660
about defeating death from him.

205
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,160
Your quest log has the main mission for that day,

206
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,660
the side quests for that day,

207
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,160
and your overall mission,

208
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,160
which for The Bachelor is saving his career

209
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,660
and maybe all human life

210
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,160
by learning how to defeat death from Simon.

211
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,660
So you go to meet him,

212
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,160
and you learn from Simon's brother Georgie

213
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,160
that he died right before you got there.

214
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,660
Oh.

215
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,660
Well, Georgie asks you to help him find out

216
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,160
who or what killed him.

217
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,160
Luckily, you think you have a lead on how he died

218
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,160
because he met with a town community leader,

219
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,160
Isidor Burakh, right beforehand,

220
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,160
and he was a respected local cultural figure

221
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,160
and the town's head doctor of sorts,

222
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,160
so they might have discussed his health

223
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,660
or who might have wanted him dead.

224
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,660
So you go to meet him, and he's dead too.

225
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,160
People are speculating about a serial killer

226
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
or a demonic step creature of myth,

227
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,660
the Shabnackadir, being responsible,

228
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,660
and then you start to notice signs of a plague,

229
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,660
and it becomes clear it probably killed both of them

230
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,660
and is about to kill everyone else.

231
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,660
For days and days, as the lives of people in the town

232
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,660
and your own odds of survival get worse and worse,

233
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,160
that original quest,

234
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,160
Dankovsky's bright-eyed, naive mission

235
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,160
to defeat death itself on his way to meet a dead man,

236
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,660
will stare you in the face every time you open your menu

237
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,160
and check your mission.

238
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,160
For Dankovsky, this message doesn't update

239
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,660
when saving himself or the town become his priority.

240
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,660
For the rest of your sad life,

241
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,160
you have to deal with being reminded

242
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,660
that you came here for something completely unrelated.

243
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,160
So, yeah, get used to that.

244
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,660
Pathologic's not a game about getting answers

245
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,160
or resolutions to your personal quests

246
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,160
or even about being heroic.

247
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,160
It's not a game about feeling safe or having fun.

248
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,160
It's a game about part two,

249
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,160
futility and disempowerment.

250
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,160
You might be wondering why I'm reading the words out

251
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
when they're on the screen,

252
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,660
and that's because some people like to listen

253
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,160
to these videos instead of watch them.

254
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,160
I put a lot of effort into my visuals,

255
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,660
but, you know, that's fine.

256
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,160
So I think an important way of explaining

257
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,160
the features and effects of this game

258
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,160
is to talk about the first thing

259
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
that'll probably happen to a new player.

260
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,660
You start the game in the house of Eva Yan,

261
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,160
who's letting you sleep upstairs.

262
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,160
She tells you that she's heard noises outside

263
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,160
and there's some strange men hanging out in her garden.

264
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Oh, I know how games work. This is a tutorial quest.

265
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
RPGs sometimes have easy early quests

266
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,660
that act as a sort of microcosm of the game,

267
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,160
a tutorial for how various mechanics work.

268
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,660
So you go outside and you're greeted

269
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,660
by these strange boys.

270
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,160
These aren't the characters hanging out in her garden.

271
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,660
These are more tutorial figures.

272
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,160
These are characters that pop up a lot in the game,

273
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,660
tragedians and executors.

274
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,160
These are their costumes.

275
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,660
They're actors at the local theater

276
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,160
performing plays and so on,

277
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,160
but executors also perform important roles

278
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,160
during the plague, like getting posted up

279
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
outside the houses of important sick people

280
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
to relay messages.

281
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,660
Given that the game is already being framed

282
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,660
as one large theater performance

283
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,660
with you as an actor,

284
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,160
sometimes they break the fourth wall,

285
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,160
like right now where they're telling you,

286
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,660
a living human person,

287
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,660
how to live in the world.

288
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,160
These characters teach you how the basic mechanics work.

289
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,660
Time advances no matter what,

290
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,160
so if you don't do the important things

291
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,660
you're supposed to be doing,

292
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,160
other people will have to do them for you

293
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
and might get sick,

294
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,660
and you might need them not to get sick,

295
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,160
so maybe don't let that happen.

296
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,660
Your reputation is important,

297
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,160
so don't start too many fights.

298
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,660
Eat food so you don't starve and die,

299
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,660
and so on.

300
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,660
This game came out in, like, 2004,

301
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,660
so the idea of having to eat to not die

302
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,660
and time mechanics was actually pretty unique

303
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,660
for the time.

304
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,660
This is executed in an awesome way.

305
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,160
Look at how this tutorial is framed.

306
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,660
This conversation won't take too much of your time,

307
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,160
especially since time stops during dialogues,

308
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,160
and our dialogue is extremely important.

309
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
You need to know how to play, after all.

310
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,660
What are you talking about?

311
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,660
I'm neither a gambler nor an actor.

312
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,160
He doesn't understand what the Tragedian means by play.

313
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,660
The Tragedian is talking past him to you

314
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,160
so that you know the mechanics,

315
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,160
but the Bachelor has no idea why someone's telling him this.

316
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,160
Need I remind a wise man like you

317
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,660
of the fact hunger is sated with food?

318
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,660
Food can be found in shops.

319
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,160
The Bachelor is having the weirdest conversation

320
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
of his life.

321
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,660
The fourth wall-breaking stuff in this game

322
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,160
is genuinely the best.

323
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,660
Anyway, what's next?

324
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,660
Ah, yes, the side quest.

325
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,160
So you go around to see about the men in Eva's garden

326
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,660
and get a cutscene showing them,

327
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,160
and you realize one of them is a creepy-looking,

328
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,660
inhuman worm-man.

329
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,660
Great, another thing I'll have to figure out later, I guess.

330
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,160
If you try to make them leave in a threatening way in dialogue,

331
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
a fight starts.

332
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,660
The way fights work in this game

333
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,160
is you get beaten to death in a matter of seconds

334
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,660
and the game is over.

335
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,160
♪

336
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,660
Oh.

337
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,660
Oh, jeez.

338
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,160
Hello again, you two.

339
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,660
Ah, no need to be so dramatic.

340
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,660
Actually, no, that's your job, isn't it?

341
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,660
In Pathologic, combat deliberately feels off.

342
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,160
The game has fighting mechanics

343
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,160
in the same sense that a car being driven off a cliff

344
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,660
has flight mechanics.

345
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,160
Punching is slow and plays a random animation

346
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,660
with a different length before the attack actually goes off,

347
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,660
and its range is highly deceptive.

348
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,660
The range enemies have with their attacks

349
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,160
is hard to decipher as well.

350
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,160
It's very swimmy, like there's lag in a single-player game.

351
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,160
You have to learn to intuit exactly when to close in

352
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,660
for your attack to hit

353
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,660
and when to step back and not get killed.

354
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,160
It's quite hard to be good at fighting in this game.

355
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,660
The game does everything it can

356
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,160
to stack the deck against you if you get in a fight.

357
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,660
The muggers who spawn at night open their combat with you

358
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,160
by throwing a knife at your face,

359
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,160
which, no joke, deals, like, 90% of your health

360
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
in a single hit.

361
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,160
No one gets distracted by guards once they pick a target.

362
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,660
They just keep going for you

363
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,160
while the guards chase them and hit them in the back,

364
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,160
and they seem to only reliably drop loot

365
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,660
if you're the one who kills them.

366
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,160
You can right-click to trigger a blocking animation,

367
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
which is pretty cool.

368
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,660
It doesn't actually do anything, though.

369
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,660
Guns are eventually an option.

370
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,660
They kill in one or two hits,

371
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,160
but bullets are super rare.

372
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,660
They're really expensive, and you have a tendency to miss

373
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,660
even when you're pointing the gun right at someone's head.

374
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,660
I don't know. It just feels a little weird,

375
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,660
but this actually works in the context of the gameplay

376
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,660
because it further disincentivizes you

377
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,660
in doing combat because even sure bets,

378
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,660
like bringing a gun to a knife fight,

379
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,160
are never really that sure.

380
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
Fighting always feels like a risk,

381
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
and it instills that you're not really supposed

382
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,160
to live through this game while getting in tons of fights.

383
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,660
You're never handed satisfaction or enjoyment from fighting,

384
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,160
which normally is the sort of thing

385
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,160
that's the most visceral part of a game experience.

386
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,660
The game knows this, too, and likes to throw challenges

387
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,660
designed to hurt you and not be satisfying

388
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,160
right in your face.

389
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,660
Once you're past the point in the game

390
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,660
where you're very likely to have a revolver,

391
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,160
a weapon with six shots,

392
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,660
before a very slow and vulnerable reloading animation,

393
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,660
a side quest pits you against seven guys,

394
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,160
and you have to stand still to open the menu,

395
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,660
which doesn't pause the game,

396
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,660
to unequip it to switch to anything else.

397
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,660
It's like the creators are laughing at you,

398
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,160
seeing what deliberately weird, difficult thing

399
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,160
they can put in front of you and have you still actually do.

400
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,660
This whole fight is optional,

401
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,660
so really it's your fault if you decide

402
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,160
to try a dozen times to shoot seven people

403
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,660
with a gun with six chambers.

404
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,660
Remember how I said early quests in games

405
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,160
are like a tutorial?

406
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,160
The lesson of this tutorial is you're gonna die

407
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,660
if you make bad decisions.

408
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,160
Heck, you're still probably gonna die

409
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,660
if you make good decisions.

410
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,660
Fighting is hard and punishing,

411
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,660
especially against more than one person,

412
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,660
and realistically you wouldn't be seeking out

413
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,660
fights like this.

414
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,160
You should be trying not to get killed first.

415
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,660
A two-on-one fight in the first two minutes of the game

416
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,660
before you know all the quirks of its combat

417
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,660
is a death sentence, and the developers know it.

418
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,160
They put this fight in here to teach the player lessons

419
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,660
about how they should be thinking

420
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,660
about the idea of fighting

421
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,160
or on the whole taking unnecessary risks.

422
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,160
Death is cheap and your health is expensive.

423
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,660
I mean that literally, too.

424
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,160
How do you get health back?

425
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,160
Simple, just rest in a bed for a few hours and...

426
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,160
Oh.

427
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,660
No, that does nothing.

428
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,160
Actually, it just made everything worse.

429
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,660
My hunger meter's gone up now.

430
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,160
Okay, I'll eat an egg and...

431
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,660
Oh, no, that's not gonna close my wounds.

432
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,160
It's an egg.

433
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,160
It made my hunger go down,

434
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,160
but wait, it only made it go down a tiny amount,

435
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,660
and that was all the food I could afford.

436
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,660
Oh, I'm fucked.

437
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,160
The only reliable way to heal

438
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,660
is to take a painkiller like Meridorm or Novocaine.

439
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,660
These are expensive, but they cause you to regain health

440
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,660
over the course of a few in-game hours

441
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,160
which is agonizingly slow, but it works.

442
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
They also cause a lot of exhaustion

443
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
which also raises over time while you're awake

444
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,660
and causes you health damage if it maxes out

445
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,660
just like hunger.

446
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,160
There are items that heal you without any downsides,

447
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,660
tourniquets and bandages,

448
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,160
but they don't heal you that much.

449
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,660
They're pretty hard to acquire,

450
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,160
and they're worth enough money

451
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,660
that you might as well just sell them

452
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,660
and buy some more delicious eggs.

453
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,660
Basically, in this game, taking damage hurts.

454
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,160
After retrying a few times,

455
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
if you manage to kill the two people in this fight,

456
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
the items they drop are barely worth

457
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,660
the health you lost to get them.

458
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,160
You get a couple of bullets,

459
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,660
like literally a handful,

460
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,160
and you don't even have a gun to use them with yet.

461
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,660
If you used the weapon you started with in the fight,

462
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,160
your scalpel, it's taken durability damage

463
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,660
and is now already less effective,

464
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,660
and you'll have to pay to get that repaired.

465
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,160
Oh, yeah, weapons lose durability

466
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,660
and effectiveness in this game,

467
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,160
and they do it super fast.

468
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,660
This fight is barely worth doing.

469
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,160
When I was playing, I just reloaded

470
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,160
and let the guys get on with whatever they were doing.

471
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,660
They're on the run from the law.

472
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,160
Whatever. They'll be on their way soon.

473
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,660
It's their problem, and they're not interested

474
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,160
in you or Eva anyways.

475
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
You can even ask them what the deal is with this guy.

476
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,660
He's just one of the locals.

477
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,160
Some of the people of this culture

478
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,160
are just physically different for some reason.

479
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,660
For me, the canon choice my bachelor made

480
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,160
was to leave these guys alone

481
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,160
and just let them go away.

482
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,660
It's fine. It's not worth it.

483
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,160
This opening is an exercise in disempowerment.

484
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,160
You're not the main character of the story.

485
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,660
I mean, first of all, there's literally two

486
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,160
of the main characters, but on a deeper level,

487
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,660
you're not special,

488
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,160
and sometimes you have to keep your head down to survive.

489
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,160
You are nobody's hero.

490
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,660
Your character's stats page is a really helpful way

491
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,160
of keeping up with all eight

492
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,160
of the chokeholds the game has you in.

493
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,660
Reputation goes down when you start fights,

494
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,660
kill people, or other generally immoral things,

495
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,160
and goes up when you do good things

496
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
like in quests or killing muggers

497
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,660
or giving money to the poor

498
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,660
or medicine and alcohol to the sick.

499
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,660
Not to cure them, but to help ease their pain

500
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,160
so they can die in peace.

501
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,660
A pretty morbid way of doing good.

502
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,160
Despite being an RPG where you can get into fights

503
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,660
with anyone you want in the street,

504
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,660
a la Fallout or Elder Scrolls,

505
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,660
the game has a very powerful ability

506
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:32,160
to strongly incentivize that you don't do whatever you want.

507
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,660
Not only do fights hurt,

508
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,660
but your survival relies on you being accepted by society.

509
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,160
If your reputation is too low,

510
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,660
shopkeepers won't sell to you,

511
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,160
and then you're kind of doomed to starve to death

512
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,160
or to get sick to death or die to death.

513
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,660
Exhaustion just goes up over time

514
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,160
and is reduced by sleeping,

515
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,660
but there are things like raw coffee beans and lemons

516
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,660
which reduce exhaustion and give you more time

517
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,160
to do things other than sleeping,

518
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,660
but lemons increase your hunger

519
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,660
and coffee decreases your health

520
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,660
just like in real life,

521
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,660
but what's immunity and infection?

522
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,660
Well, immunity is your ability to resist the plague.

523
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,660
Kind of? Not really.

524
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,160
When the plague becomes a factor,

525
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,660
if you walk into a cloud of plague

526
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,160
or get touched by a plague carrier

527
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,660
or bitten by a rat, you get the plague.

528
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,660
Your immunity defaults to 50%.

529
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,660
There's expensive medicines you can take

530
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,160
which increase it temporarily,

531
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
but these also hurt you to use,

532
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,660
and you have to use quite a few

533
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,660
to raise your meter a useful amount.

534
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,160
If the meter's absurdly high,

535
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,160
and I mean close to 100%,

536
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,660
and you're wearing a couple of clothes

537
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,160
that protect from infection,

538
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,660
if you get hit by the plague,

539
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,660
you might, might not get infected.

540
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,160
It'll just lower your immunity a bunch

541
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,660
so you get infected the next time you touch something.

542
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,660
Hooray!

543
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,660
Hooray!

♪♪

545
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,160
If you get infected,

546
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,660
you start to lose health over time,

547
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,160
and occasionally your camera gets all wobbly and distorted,

548
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,660
and your infection level starts to raise nonstop,

549
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,660
and as it gets higher, the effects will get worse,

550
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,160
and if you get too infected,

551
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,660
some NPCs will try to kill you with fire.

552
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,160
There are antibiotics which decrease your infection level,

553
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
but these also hurt you to take

554
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,660
and are also expensive

555
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,660
and don't actually stop the plague once you're infected.

556
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,160
How do you cure the plague?

557
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,660
You can't. Fuck you.

558
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,660
Don't catch the plague, shithead!

559
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,160
That's not really up for discussion, is it?

560
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,660
It's a fucking plague.

561
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,660
Plagues are really bad.

562
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,160
Statistically, in Europe from 1200 to 1800,

563
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,160
roughly 100% of all living people died of the plague.

564
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,660
Okay, there are items that can cure the plague,

565
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,160
but you really want to not be wasting those.

566
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,160
The game's about curing the plague,

567
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,160
so you kind of might want to not use those

568
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,160
on your personal status effects.

569
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,160
If you get infected, either load a save

570
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,160
or prepare to have one extra thing to worry about

571
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
for the rest of the entire game.

572
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,660
There's one other important meter

573
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,660
you'll need to keep a close eye on as well.

574
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,160
Time. The clock doesn't wait for you.

575
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,160
Every day has a main quest,

576
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
and you have to complete the quest on time

577
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,160
or someone else has to do your job for you,

578
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,160
and they're not as good at your job, so...

579
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,160
The night has come.

580
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,160
The most pressing endeavors of the day

581
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,160
were fulfilled at the expense

582
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
of several lives of your bound.

583
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,160
If you don't complete a quest in time,

584
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,660
the story advances without you

585
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,160
and one of your friends gets sick,

586
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,660
which means you won't be able to talk to them

587
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,660
unless you give up some of your medicine at the door

588
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,160
to keep them upright for the day.

589
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,160
Some quest lines take place at certain times, too,

590
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,160
so you need to keep an eye on things and plan ahead.

591
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,660
Between all this and reputation,

592
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,660
the game imposes a horrible feeling of dread on the player,

593
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,660
a pressure that never really lets off.

594
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,160
There are so many things to manage, to think about,

595
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,660
just to stay alive,

596
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,160
and that's not even getting into the story

597
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,160
you're trying to progress while you do all this.

598
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,660
You're always on the clock

599
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,160
and almost always need to be in two places at once,

600
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,660
and as you navigate the town

601
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,660
to get where you're supposed to be going,

602
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,160
you get more and more aware of how slowly you walk.

It's horrible.

You're not a character in a fun RPG.

609
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,660
You're a person traveling

00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,660
at frustratingly person-like speeds

611
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,660
trying to outrun about eight different ways of dying.

612
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,160
This is one of the first truly divisive things about the game.

613
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,160
The walk speed is slow,

614
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,160
and most of the game is about walking from place to place,

615
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,660
walking to buy food, walking to buy medicine,

616
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,160
walking to the trash can to find things to trade,

617
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,660
walking to talk to people,

618
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,660
and walking to the theater to see it predict

619
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,160
all the walking you're gonna do.

620
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,160
Speaking of the theater, every day after midnight,

621
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,660
they rehearse a new play.

622
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,660
These often comment on what happened that day

623
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,160
or predict the future in quite interesting ways.

624
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,160
People only fear bloodshed

625
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:48,160

Yeah, that's right. Stay out of my shed.

What the fuck are you talking about?

628
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,160
And as the plague spreads,

629
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,160
you start having to either take longer routes

630
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,160
to avoid infected districts

631
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,660
or start risking infection and having to load saves

632
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,660
and lose even more time.

633
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,160
This is not fun or pretty.

634
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,660
It's just walking.

635
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,160
I've had people tell me that walking is what turned them off.

636
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,660
It takes so long to get anywhere.

637
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,660
Even if you're not in immediate danger

638
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,160
because things are going well,

639
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,660
you're still giving up a lot of your time going places,

640
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,660
and the clock is still ticking down,

641
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,660
so you're always racing,

642
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,660
and you're always racing slowly.

643
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,660
But this is also the point of the game in Microcosm.

644
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,160
It's not supposed to be fun on its own.

645
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,660
Here's a head-scratcher.

646
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,160
Are games supposed to be fun?

647
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,660
Maybe, but should they always be?

648
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,660
Is that the only reaction games can

649
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,160
or should explore creating in their players?

650
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,160
Well, I think it's useful to at least experiment.

651
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,160
This boredom isn't a bug.

652
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,660
It's a feature.

653
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,660
It adds even further to this sense of disempowerment.

654
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,160
It also has a profound emotional effect.

655
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,160
As you get increasingly aware of your impending doom

656
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,160
and how limited your abilities to get things done really are,

657
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,160
even walking around becomes tense and stressful.

658
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,160
Pathologic is the subtlest survival horror experience

659
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,660
I've ever played.

660
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,660
The act of standing still in the game makes me nervous.

661
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,160
I'm wasting time.

662
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,660
Oh, shit, it's 3 o'clock. I have to be somewhere.

663
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,160
After a while, even the process of the travel

664
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,160
starts to really get its hooks in you.

665
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,660
Once you get used to it, there's nothing quite like it.

666
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,160
As the story deepens and becomes more complex,

667
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,660
the travel becomes an opportunity

668
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,160
to think about what's happening.

669
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,660
If you're being played,

670
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,160
why you're being asked to do this,

671
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,660
who it really benefits,

672
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,160
whether someone's messing you around to waste your time

673
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,160
and stop you figuring out what's really going on.

674
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,160
The walking becomes the most engaging thing in the world.

675
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,660
I've never been more alone with my own thoughts

676
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,160
than when I was playing Pathologic.

677
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,160
I'm one of the two remaining defenders of No Man's Sky.

678
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,160
The others were lost in the Great Purge,

679
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,160
but when it came out, I liked it at the time

680
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,160
almost primarily because it came closer

681
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,160
than any other game to doing this.

682
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,660
In fact, I made a reference to Pathologic

683
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,660
in my little video about it, but in reality,

684
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,160
Pathologic is still the absolute greatest of this

685
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,660
and puts No Man's Sky to shame,

686
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,160
especially when all the patches made it

687
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,660
much more like what everyone else wanted

688
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,660
and much less like what I had enjoyed.

689
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,660
Man, I should revisit that game.

690
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,160
Imagine a game holding your attention

691
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,660
not because anything in particular is happening

692
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,160
but entirely because it's got inside your head.

693
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,660
Oh, and then, just to make sure you're paying attention,

694
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,660
a plague cloud made of screaming skulls

695
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,660
flies at you and you go,

696
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,660
AHH!

697
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,160
The constant racing against the multitudinous clocks

698
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,660
of time, exhaustion, and hunger,

699
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,660
trying to get enough surplus stuff done

700
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,160
to afford to manage it all,

701
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,660
and the many ways you can be killed easily or survive

702
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,660
but with the game made even harder

703
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,660
by taking damage or losing time or getting infected

704
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,660
or getting so desperate you decide to kill a guy

705
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,160
in a dark alley for his food

706
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,160
is the exact opposite of a heroic fantasy story.

707
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,160
At all times, the player feels powerless.

708
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,160
Instead of the player being free,

709
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,160
but with some survival mechanics to keep track of,

710
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
it's flipped.

711
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,160
The game is a large collection of things

712
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,660
that will kill you unless you submit yourself

713
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,660
to their whims.

714
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,660
You're free, but you should be doing

715
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,160
what you're supposed to be doing or you'll fail and die.

716
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,160
You're placed under a level of constant stress

717
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,160
maintaining your frail body while racing against time

718
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,160
to actually get anything else done.

719
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,660
You're always technically in control,

720
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,660
but it's hard not to avoid the feeling

721
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,160
that you're the one being played by the game,

722
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,160
constantly reminded of all the things

723
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,660
you don't have time to do,

724
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,160
all the things you need to avoid,

725
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,160
and worrying maybe the game's gonna come up

726
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,660
with something new to stab you with on the next day,

727
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,660
which, uh...

728
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,660
Part 2.2, day two.

729
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,160
I came up with the titles in this video to amuse myself.

730
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,660
I don't really care what you think about them.

731
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,160
Day one is kind of a walk in the park.

732
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,160
You even have enough leeway to take a walk

733
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,160
in some of the parks.

734
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,160
You get used to the basic mechanics,

735
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,660
buy and eat some food, progress the story a little,

736
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,160
and meet some of the other characters,

737
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,660
and at the end you realize that a plague

738
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,160
might be about to hit.

739
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,660
If you manage to survive day one and complete the quest,

740
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
well, congratulations.

741
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,160
You've done better than most players,

742
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,160
but the real game hasn't started yet.

743
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,660
Day two is the next big hurdle,

744
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,660
and even less people make it past that.

745
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,160
The Bachelor's day two is where players will decide

746
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,660
if this game is for them or not,

747
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,160
and the drop-offs in terms of achievements

748
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,660
demonstrate this pretty well.

749
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,660
You'll know if the game is something you're going

750
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,660
to try to continue with after this,

751
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,160
so you make it to bed on time

752
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,660
with a decent amount of money prepared

753
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,160
in case you need to buy more things

754
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,160
and with all your meters sufficiently handled.

755
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,160
Maybe everyone's warnings about how hard this game is

756
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,660
were sufficient to prepare you,

757
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,160
and you've got this in the bag now.

758
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,160
♪ ♪

759
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,660
On the morning of day two, prices rise tenfold.

760
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,160
The money you started the game with

761
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,160
is no longer enough to buy a single delicious egg.

762
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,160
The plague hasn't properly hit yet,

763
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,160
but word's got out there's an outbreak coming

764
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,660
and people are stockpiling food and medicine.

765
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,660
Not only is being able to afford food

766
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,660
suddenly a much more pressing question than you expected,

767
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,160
any food you do have on you

768
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,160
doesn't seem like a good idea to eat.

769
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,660
I mean, that's a lot of money you're holding.

770
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,160
To make matters worse,

771
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,660
the town's governor, Alexander Saburov,

772
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,660
won't agree to do anything about the plague

773
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,660
because he'll be seen to be overstepping the mark

774
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,160
if the other rulers of the town

775
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,660
don't agree on there being one.

776
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,160
So a plague is starting,

777
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,660
but no one with the power to take proper action

778
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,160
will help because everyone has their own agenda.

779
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,660
So you spend a good deal of the day

780
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,160
with your hunger rising

781
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,660
and no sure way to solve it

782
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,160
because your money is worthless now

783
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,160
running around trying to find enough proof

784
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,660
to get all three of these groups

785
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,160
to agree there is a plague

786
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,660
and to give Saburov the power

787
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,160
to start making emergency orders.

788
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,160
Your main quest is getting these warring factions

789
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,160
to agree that the obvious problem exists.

790
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,660
Along the way, you pick up two side quests.

791
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,160
In one of them, you meet up with a former buddy of yours,

792
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,660
Andrei Stamatin, and upon agreeing

793
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,160
that the shits hit the fan, or rather the town,

794
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,160
you decide to get out while you can,

795
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,160
but Andrei won't leave without his brother Peter

796
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,660
who doesn't want to leave that much,

797
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,160
but Saburov, the guy who will get emergency powers

798
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,160
anytime soon, bears a long-standing grudge

799
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,160
against Peter which will probably lead

800
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,160
to him getting killed once that happens.

801
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,660
And this isn't unfounded, by the way.

802
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,660
When Saburov does get emergency powers later in the game,

803
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,160
he uses them to try to get Peter killed.

804
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,160
So you need to get proof this is the case

805
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,660
to get Peter to agree to leave with you both,

806
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,160
which you get from talking to Maria Kane,

807
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,160
Simon's niece, about this issue.

808
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,160
However, if you tell her why you need to know this,

809
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,160
she intervenes and prevents either of them

810
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,160
from leaving, failing the quest.

811
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,660
Unbeknownst to you, Maria needs these guys

812
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,660
in the town for her own reasons, so don't do that.

813
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,160
So you go to give this information to Peter.

814
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,660
Ah, fuck!

815
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,160
This is an actual recording

816
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,660
of the first time I saw this statue.

817
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,660
You can see in the footage that I freeze up.

818
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,160
Like, it's terrifying.

819
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,660
This is the second game ever to jump scare me

820
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,660
with a fucking still object.

821
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,160
It's genius.

822
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,660
I can't wait to show you the other one sometime.

823
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,160
That one's great, too.

824
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,660
You know which one I'm talking about.

825
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,160
You all agree to meet at the train station at 10 p.m.,

826
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,160
so you're starving and the town sucks,

827
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,160
but at least you have an escape plan now.

828
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,660
The second side quest is called

829
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,160
The House of the Living.

830
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,660
Several of the town's more charitable people

831
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,160
have decided to establish a shelter

832
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,660
for when the epidemic hits,

833
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,160
and they each give you money to buy some food

834
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,160
for the shelter before the prices rise any further.

835
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,160
I will make the purchases.

836
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:05,160
I have to do a lot of walking today anyway.

837
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,160
Ah.

838
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,660
The money they give you is not enough

839
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,160
to buy all the food they want,

840
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,160
so you actually have to use whatever spare money you have

841
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,160
or sell some of your items to afford this.

842
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,160
You give up all your remaining money

843
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,160
and items to get food you also need

844
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,660
just to give it away,

845
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,660
and you have to watch your hunger go up

846
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,160
and your time go down as you rush around

847
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,660
trying to find the stores with any bread or meat left.

848
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,160
When you get it all,

849
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,660
you're told the location of the shelter

850
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,160
so you can deliver it.

851
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,660
Let's just break this down.

852
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:39,660
Part of a quest on a day when food is incredibly scarce

853
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,660
involves carrying a ton of food somewhere

854
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,160
and not eating it.

855
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,660
It's actual torture running around

856
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,160
watching that hunger meter go up

857
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,660
and not knowing how you're going to resolve it

858
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,660
even though you're technically holding a solution

859
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,160
the whole time.

860
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,160
It's awkward and engaging and tense

861
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,660
in a way that no game has achieved before or since.

862
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,660
The game doesn't punish you for eating it either.

863
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,160
You don't have to do this quest.

864
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,660
You can just keep the food

865
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,660
or the money you were given to buy it with

866
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,160
and just ruin the chance to build the shelter,

867
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,160
but you don't because that's hardly what a doctor

868
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,660
would do preparing for the plague,

869
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,660
and maybe there's a reward for doing it

870
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,160
or it helps you further down the line.

871
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,160
You're making a positive moral choice

872
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,660
on a quest in a video game.

873
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,160
You know how this works.

874
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,660
There's something in it for you.

875
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,160
So you go to deliver the food.

876
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:38,160
♪♪

877
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,660
The house has already been hit by the plague.

878
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,660
Everyone there is sick and dying,

879
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,160
and the plague clouds will actively hunt you

880
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,160
through the house if you stay too long.

881
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,660
There's an executor there who tells you

882
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,660
this mission was obviously a failure,

883
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,660
so you leave and go back to the quest giver

884
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,160
and give her all the food intended for the shelter.

885
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,660
She gives you some nuts to tide you over

886
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,160
as thanks for your hard work.

887
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,160
The reward for successfully following this quest

888
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,660
to the end is dramatically worse

889
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,660
than the money or food you could have just run away with.

890
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,660
At the very least, this quest results

891
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,160
in finding proof of the plague,

892
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
so the part of the main quest where you go in search

893
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,160
of a plague-ridden house is at least solved by this too.

894
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,160
If you do the main quest instead, though,

895
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,160
you get a genuinely terrifying encounter

896
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,660
where as soon as you realize you've found a house

897
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,660
filled with women who have the plague,

898
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,160
once you try to leave, it spawns two more

899
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,660
right where you just came from,

900
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,660
and they try to grab you to appeal for help

901
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,660
and give you the plague if they do,

902
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,660
and you just have to dodge past them.

903
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:37,160
It's genuinely super scary and just emotionally awful.

904
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,160
You're just abandoning these women to die.

905
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,660
It's a horrible nightmare which, thankfully,

906
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,160
you cannot do if you did the house of the living.

907
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,160
Finally, Saburov has the power he needs

908
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,660
to start establishing hospitals under quarantine,

909
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,160
rationing food, distributing medicine, and so on,

910
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,160
and he even gives you a gun,

911
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,160
so it's a day late, but things are finally

912
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,660
where they should have been already,

913
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,160
perhaps too late to prevent a full-on outbreak,

914
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,160
but better than nothing at all.

915
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,660
You can defend yourself a little better now at least.

916
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,660
Luckily, you're getting out of here soon,

917
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,160
so 10 p.m. rolls around.

918
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,160
Your quests have been one major failure

919
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,660
and one minor resolution to a power squabble

920
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,660
that you're sure will heat up again tomorrow,

921
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,660
and you haven't eaten anything,

922
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,660
so you head to the train station.

923
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,660
When you get there, you find guards blocking the trains.

924
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,660
The Somatin brothers are nowhere to be seen.

925
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,160
They just didn't show up, and according to the guards,

926
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,160
no one can enter or leave the town now

927
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,160
because it's under quarantine thanks to the emergency powers

928
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,160
you helped Saburov get.

929
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,660
You just trapped yourself in the town.

930
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,160
If you try to talk your way out,

931
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,660
all the guards attack you,

932
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,160
and you lose reputation for killing them

933
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,160
because these guys were just doing their job.

934
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,660
Best of all, there's an executor standing there.

935
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,160
This one doesn't say anything

936
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,160
and seemingly can't be seen by the other characters.

937
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,160
He just stares at you, letting you know

938
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,660
he knows how dramatic the irony is,

939
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,660
laughing at you for thinking you can just leave the town.

940
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,660
So you're trapped, and you're starving.

941
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,660
In the middle of the night, you go to see a play

942
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,160
being rehearsed at the theater.

943
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,160
The play's about how you're fucked.

944
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,160
Bad news.

945
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,660
The governor will abuse his power.

946
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,660
When the morning hits, the game nonchalantly says,

947
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,160
it all ends in less than ten days.

948
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,160
Exhausted from a day's being a pawn

949
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,160
in someone else's power grab and scrambling for resources

950
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,160
for a quest that was doomed and starving half to death,

951
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,160
you eat one of the nuts.

952
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,160
♪♪

953
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,660
Great. You're completely fucked,

954
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,160
and you're on day three.

955
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,160
Day two is excellent game design.

956
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,660
It's deeply engaging.

957
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,660
Watching your attempts to get anything at all done

958
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,160
get frustrated,

959
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,160
and it also sets a general tone for the game.

960
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,160
It does the special game design trick

961
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,660
that I like to call recontextualizing.

962
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,660
Players come to games with their own expectations

963
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,160
and understandings of how a game is supposed to work

964
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,660
and feel and play,

965
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,660
a certain general set of ideas

966
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,660
about what all this is supposed to be like.

967
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,660
If you're playing an open world RPG,

968
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,160
you know what dialogue trees, shops,

969
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,160
and trading and hunger and time mechanics

970
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,660
and moral choices are,

971
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,160
and you think you know how they work.

972
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,160
Day one partially plays into this.

973
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,660
It takes pains to show how fragile you are

974
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,660
and all the work you have to do to not die,

975
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,160
but it's doable. It makes sense.

976
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,160
It doesn't feel that much different from a normal game.

977
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,160
When the prices rise so massively

978
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,160
that money is effectively worthless

979
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,160
and you were given no warning this would happen,

980
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,160
everything about how you relate to the game experience

981
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,660
is thrown out the window,

982
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,660
and you feel that happening in your brain

983
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:35,160
as you play and realize what just happened.

984
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,660
Walking around while slowly starving,

985
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,660
getting rid of the rest of your own items

986
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,160
to try to get the food for a doomed quest,

987
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,660
carrying food you can't eat around,

988
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,160
and wondering when you will get to eat,

989
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,660
and watching your meters inevitably rise

990
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,160
as you race to help the town

991
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,660
and only barely achieve anything,

992
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,660
you start to make realizations

993
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,660
about the scope of this experience.

994
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,160
You weren't playing a game with the mechanic

995
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,660
where you have the option of using money to buy things.

996
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,660
You were playing a game about having no money.

997
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,160
You weren't playing a game where you have

998
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,660
to eat food to survive.

999
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,660
You were playing a game about starving.

1000
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,660
You weren't playing a game where you can choose

1001
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,160
what sort of morals you have.

1002
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,160
You were playing a game about how betraying

1003
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,160
the people who trust you is better for you

1004
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,660
than trying to be a hero, and doing the right thing

1005
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,160
is an exercise in getting your time

1006
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,160
and energy and money wasted.

1007
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,660
Survival horror RPG? Lies.

1008
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,660
You are playing a pain simulator.

1009
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,660
This is a deeply masterful trick

1010
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,660
I've seen very few developers pull,

1011
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,660
where commonly understood mechanics

1012
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,660
are twisted in such a fashion as to force the player

1013
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,160
into a specific mindset and relationship

1014
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,660
with those mechanics,

1015
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,160
and everything straightforward suddenly becomes

1016
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,660
different and off.

1017
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,160
Once day two happens,

1018
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,660
you no longer have any idea what's coming.

1019
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,160
Money turning out to be virtually useless?

1020
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,160
The growing threat of the plague?

1021
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,160
Who knows how bad things will get in the next few days?

1022
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,660
Even though the game doesn't get that much harder,

1023
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,160
and technically the game isn't that hard

1024
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,660
if you know what you're doing,

1025
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,160
this sequence of experiences fills you with dread

1026
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,660
for what might happen next,

1027
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,660
and the game doesn't stay this difficult forever.

1028
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,160
The point isn't how hard the game actually is

1029
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,160
if you measure it objectively.

1030
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,160
The point here is how the game makes you engage with it.

1031
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,160
The game has a reputation of being depressingly punishing

1032
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,160
and difficult, and while all this is true in places,

1033
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,160
and it does get very hard in brief bursts,

1034
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,160
the fact the game manages to create this reputation

1035
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,660
without always being that hard

1036
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,160
is a serious credit to its execution.

1037
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,660
Day two grinds you beneath its heel,

1038
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,160
and even if things pick up for you

1039
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,160
or you master the art of stabbing bad men

1040
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,660
for extra cash,

1041
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,160
you'll never really feel in control again,

1042
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,160
and that is genius design.

1043
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,660
One of the ways you can make surviving slightly easier

1044
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,660
is to sell your gun.

1045
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,660
The gun you just got is worth a lot of money,

1046
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,660
and so are bullets, which might be good

1047
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,660
for solving some of the more pressing issues of the game.

1048
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,160
You don't get in that many fights,

1049
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,660
especially if you're avoiding them,

1050
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,160
but being put in a position

1051
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,660
where the best chance of survival

1052
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,160
is getting rid of one of the main things

1053
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,160
a first-person shooter is known for,

1054
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,660
it's even in the name, that's a notable thing.

1055
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,160
Almost everyone I know who made it this far

1056
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,660
sold their first gun,

1057
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,160
allowed themselves to remain vulnerable

1058
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,660
for the chance to maybe not die of something else.

1059
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,160
You can also learn to hold on to certain objects

1060
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,660
to trade for better things.

1061
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,660
In trash cans, you can find all kinds of stuff.

1062
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,160
Sometimes people throw out jewelry

1063
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,660
or needles or empty bottles,

1064
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,660
which you can refill with water for free

1065
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,160
and drink to reduce hunger and increase exhaustion

1066
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,660
or save up to trade for bandages with the town drunks.

1067
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,660
The children in the town will trade flowers

1068
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,160
or nuts or blades for various useful things

1069
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,660
like medicine and bullets,

1070
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,660
so the nuts you got were useful.

1071
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,660
You just might not have learned their value,

1072
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,160
and this is another bigly clever thing the game does.

1073
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,160
The economy isn't as simple as

1074
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,660
I give you money and you give me my delicious egg.

1075
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,660
It's a web of needs and wants

1076
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,160
from a variety of NPCs

1077
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,660
which informs the value of myriad different items

1078
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,160
which you can benefit from if you pay attention and learn.

1079
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,660
The game never hands any of this to you,

1080
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,660
and that makes discovering and using these things

1081
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,160
feel good, like you've worked it out

1082
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,660
and solved something.

1083
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,160
One type of child in the town, this little girl,

1084
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,160
sometimes, very rarely,

1085
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,660
has an item on her called Shmowda.

1086
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,160
They're expensive to trade for, but they're worth it.

1087
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,660
If you use it, it reduces your health to almost nothing,

1088
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,660
but it cures the plague.

1089
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,660
There's a very limited amount of real cures

1090
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,160
available throughout the story,

1091
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,660
so getting your hands on some of these is a real help.

1092
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,660
Even if their downsides are too much for you to risk using,

1093
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,660
other people will pay thousands and thousands

1094
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,160
of rubles for them, almost $50 worth,

1095
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
and hey, maybe some of your friends

1096
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,160
might need curing later. Just saying.

1097
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,160
This all works in the context of the story too.

1098
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,160
The Bachelor is in a foreign town

1099
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,160
whose customs aren't like the ones he's used to,

1100
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,160
and so are you, and all this tension

1101
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
and storytelling happens largely

1102
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,660
while you're just walking from place to place in a town.

1103
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,160
It's quite an experience,

1104
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,660
and this experience is enhanced by the game's music,

1105
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,660
which is some of the best in the business.

1106
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,660
It takes a front seat during a lot of the walking,

1107
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,160
and it does excellently with that spotlight.

1108

♪ ♪

1109
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,660
It's intensely atmospheric and moody,

1110
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,160
and when it needs to be, it's strange and unsettling.

1112
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,160
It feels, at the same time, natural and alien,

like you're witnessing a normality

1114
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,660
that isn't familiar to you personally.

1115
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:41,660
♪ ♪

1116
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:45,160
Synths are used alongside more naturalistic drums and rhythms

1117
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,160
to further destabilize the setting.

1118
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,160
The music even evolves with the story.

1119
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,160
Each main region of the town has a theme,

1120
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,160
and when that area gets infected,

1121
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,160
its theme changes and becomes even more strange and distorted.

1122
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:06,160
♪ ♪

1123
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,660
On top of the slightly remixed original music,

1124
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,660
you can now hear a distant and frenzied chanting.

1125
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,660
It's great, and some of the tracks

1126
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,160
sound subtly different for different characters,

1127
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,160
which is awesome.

1128
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,660
The opening theme is a real banger, too.

Part three, the writing.

1136
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,660
By now, if you've been pausing to read the text for some reason,

1137
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,660
you'll be very aware of how strange the writing is,

1138
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,660
and whenever you begin dialogue with someone,

1139
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,660
they actually say something out loud.

1140
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:53,160
When we do not find peace of mind in ourselves,

1141
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,660
it is useless to seek it elsewhere.

1142
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,160
Truth does not do as much good in the world

1143
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,660
as the appearance of truth does evil.

1144
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,160
Oh, wow, that's a good quote.

1145
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,660
I'm gonna use that in a future video

1146
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,160
and pretend a philosopher said it.

1147
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,160
Watch out for that.

1148
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,660
Everyone's very wordy and flowery,

1149
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,660
talking about their dreams and visions,

1150
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:13,160
and sometimes it's hard to tell if you're discussing philosophy

1151
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,660
instead of the task at hand.

1152
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,660
The game has a very specific writing style,

1153
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,660
one more evocative of your typical novel

1154
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,660
than other games,

1155
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,660
and it is, in my opinion, very well written.

1156
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,660
It succeeds in making you feel transported to a world

1157
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,660
where things aren't as simple as they seem,

1158
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:29,660
where dream and metaphor are entangled with reality.

1159
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,660
If a sentence feels strange or hard to follow,

1160
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,660
it's doing that on purpose to make you feel weird,

1161
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,660
like you have to put effort into understanding.

1162
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,660
Instead of simply telling you you're a small part

1163
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,660
of a strange universe,

1164
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,660
it makes you feel that way

1165
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,660
by refusing to pull its punches

1166
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,160
with the ideas it's meditating on.

1167
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,660
Try this on for size.

1168
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,160
Do you believe in prophecies, Andres de Matin?

1169
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:48,660
It depends.

1170
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,160
I agree this may seem inconsistent with materialism.

1171
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:51,660
On the other hand,

1172
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,160
when your own experience convinces you to their effectiveness,

1173
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,660
you have to take them into account.

1174
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,160
I wonder that myself.

1175
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,660
For a moment, I thought he was driven

1176
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,160
by the same feeling that I am.

1177
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,660
A great man, when unexpectedly betrayed

1178
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,660
by the people he loves,

1179
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,660
will often seek to fill the whole universe

1180
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,660
with his blind spite.

1181
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,160
Yes, the feeling is indeed familiar.

1182
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,660
No one talks out loud like this in real life,

1183
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,660
but that's not a mistake.

1184
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,660
It's part of the point.

1185
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:16,660
You're stuck in a world where people do talk like that

1186
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,660
and have to untangle it to make sense of things.

1187
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,660
It's very hard to call this game pretentious

1188
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,660
because not only does pretentious mean

1189
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,660
affecting a greater importance than is actually possessed,

1190
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,660
and the game definitely does say important things,

1191
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,660
but it's also too self-aware about how all this looks,

1192
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,660
and it loves to make fun of itself.

1193
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,160
The plays make fun of the characters

1194
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,660
and plot and writing style.

1195
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,660
The cool fourth-wall-breaking executors

1196
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,660
complain about how unwieldy their outfits are.

1197
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,660
It's lovely stuff.

1198
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,660
While this video is definitely going to spoil

1199
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,660
lots of the plot,

1200
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,160
there's lots of really interesting aspects

1201
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,660
I won't have time to go into detail about.

1202
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,660
If you want a more complete breakdown

1203
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,660
and analysis of the three characters' stories,

1204
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,660
YouTuber Sulmatul made a great video doing so

1205
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,160
linked in the description.

1206
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,660
There's such a ridiculous amount of depth and complexity

1207
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,160
that it still astounds me now,

1208
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,660
and even trying to cover all of it is beyond my powers.

1209
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,660
When I was talking about this with Mandalore Gaming,

1210
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:05,160
whose video on Pathologic is also really worth checking out,

1211
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,160
he offhand mentioned an entire aspect

1212
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,660
of one of the characters I'd completely forgotten about

1213
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,160
and isn't even in Sul's video either.

1214
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,160
This game is about as dense with story

1215
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,160
as a real novel with an equivalent amount

1216
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,160
of words to read.

1217
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,660
Obviously, really getting across

1218
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,160
the cumulative feel of the writing style

1219
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,160
is hard to do in video form,

1220
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,160
and I was never really good at book reports anyway,

1221
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,160
so instead I'll talk about some of the more specific

1222
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,160
storytelling techniques that help the game achieve

1223
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,160
what it's going for.

1224
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,160
Firstly, the constant use of deception.

1225
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,660
Other characters lie to you for all kinds of reasons

1226
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,660
or have access to incomplete information

1227
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,160
and then share it unreliably.

1228
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,660
There's lots of manipulation and hearsay going on,

1229
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,660
and it's left to you to figure out

1230
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,660
what's actually happening.

1231
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,160
Every character in this game has their own end.

1232
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,160
Why does Maria Kane want to keep the Stamatins in town?

1233
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,660
Why does the Inquisitor seem to always want

1234
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,160
to investigate the Polyhedron

1235
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,660
and find an excuse to destroy it?

1236
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,660
Did Olgimsky lock up the termitary

1237
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,660
to prevent the plague getting in

1238
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,660
or has it already struck the place

1239
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,660
and he was trying to prevent it spreading out?

1240
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,160
Are his complaints that you should be looking

1241
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,660
into the Kanes' business first

1242
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,660
a genuine concern for their power plays,

1243
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,160
or is he just trying to get you out of his hair

1244
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,160
by pretending to be?

1245
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,160
This goes the other way as well, of course.

1246
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,160
Sometimes you can play dumb to learn more about someone

1247
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,660
than they'd let on if they thought

1248
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,160
you weren't on their side,

1249
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,160
and sometimes you can lie for your own benefit,

1250
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,660
like you can get a second pistol

1251
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,160
if you tell Andrei you don't have one when he asks you.

1252
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,160
Figuring out and catching someone in a lie

1253
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,160
or successfully lying to someone else

1254
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,660
feels great because you really are gaining ground

1255
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,660
in a struggle for truth and control.

1256
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:34,660
It's very engaging getting lied to by a story

1257
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,660
and having to put the pieces together yourself.

1258
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,660
Secondly, there's the way you experience

1259
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,160
the same overall story

1260
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,160
from three very different perspectives.

1261
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,660
The Bachelor, for example,

1262
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:46,160
is a clever and rational-minded man,

1263
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,160
but he's so obsessed with pursuing

1264
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,160
his specific lines of inquiry

1265
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,660
that he spends a lot of time getting tricked

1266
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:54,660
into doing busy work or ignoring the real story,

1267
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:57,660
and when he is trying, he can be pretty bad at it.

1268
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,660
He's an outsider, but rather than working

1269
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:02,160
to gain people's trust and get on a decent footing,

1270
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,660
the player's text options relate that the character

1271
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,660
they're inhabiting can be a total asshole,

1272
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,160
but could I please offer you a piece of advice?

1273
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,160
I need no advice.

1274
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,660
I mean, look at this choice.

1275
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,660
This is something The Bachelor thought to say.

1276
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,160
You're supposed to be asking this guy for help, Daniel.

1277
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,660
What the fuck are you doing?

1278
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,160
Several characters in the story have the power

1279
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,660
to predict the future,

1280
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,160
and The Bachelor has the power

1281
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,660
to be a dismissive piece of shit to all of them.

1282
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,160
The Bachelor says things that he must think

1283
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,660
in his head sound really cool,

1284
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:31,160
but to say to another person is, like, super weird.

1285
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,660
You are broken, Lara.

1286
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,660
I, on the other hand, am used to winning.

1287
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,160
At numerous points in the game,

1288
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,160
you can just randomly say a Latin phrase

1289
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,160
to try and sound clever.

1290
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,160
Medica morbo adhibe.

1291
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,660
Asperty lies to The Bachelor about who's responsible

1292
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,660
for the town's water supply being destroyed,

1293
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,660
but the guy who actually did it just made a mistake.

1294
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,660
She's buying time for him to get to safety

1295
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,160
by sending you on a wild goose chase

1296
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,660
because she rightfully believes The Bachelor

1297
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,160
will try to fucking kill the guy if he gets the chance.

1298
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,660
The Bachelor is such a piece of shit.

1299
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,160
Look how he talks to this poor woman.

1300
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,160
This is incredible characterization.

1301
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,660
Like, you're just stuck in the body

1302
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:05,160
of this pretentious buffoon. It's great.

1303
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,660
In conversation with the Haruspex,

1304
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,160
Asperty casually refers to The Bachelor

1305
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,160
as the prickly prick that'll bury us all.

1306
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,160
Bachelor's plot is largely a struggle to do

1307
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,660
what seems obvious to him with his degree in medicine

1308
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,160
but which conflict with the values

1309
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,660
of the people of the town.

1310
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,160
He wants to inspect Simon's body,

1311
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,160
but the Kains have a family ritual

1312
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,660
where bodies are left unobserved for 24 hours.

1313
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:28,160
Then later he wants to dissect an infected body

1314
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,160
to study the plague, but the local culture

1315
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,660
forbids any kind of defilement of the body,

1316
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,660
including surgery and autopsies.

1317
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,660
It's a special right given only

1318
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,660
to special families of medicine men, the Menkhu.

1319
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,160
The Bachelor spends multiple days

1320
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,160
literally and figuratively fighting

1321
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,660
the people he's trying to save

1322
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,160
to the point of getting arrested,

1323
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,660
attempting to subvert their laws

1324
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,160
so he can help sort things out.

1325
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,660
By the end of this, Dankowski has a very low opinion

1326
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,660
of the townspeople and their traditions

1327
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,160
and decides he has to work within them

1328
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,160
to get anything done and turns to someone

1329
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,160
who can do the things he can't.

1330
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,660
Over the course of his story,

1331
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,660
Dankowski finds himself siding with the characters

1332
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,660
who appeal the most to his belief system

1333
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:07,660
about the world and against the more folksy wisdom

1334
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,160
of the Haruspex and the supposed miracle working

1335
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,160
of the Changeling.

1336
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,660
All three characters play through

1337
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:16,160
the same 12 days, and these stories aren't separate.

1338
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,660
Whichever character you play,

1339
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,660
the other characters are dropped in the world too

1340
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,160
and follow their stories as well.

1341
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,660
You even interact with them as part of your story.

1342
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,660
You cross paths with the other characters quite a lot,

1343
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,660
but you never really have an understanding

1344
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,660
of what the other character's path is.

1345
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:32,160
Early on, it sounds like the Haruspex is responsible

1346
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,160
for the deaths of both Simon and Isidore,

1347
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,160
though some people vouch for his innocence,

1348
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,160
but then you find out that Isidore is his father.

1349
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,160
Would he really just kill his dad like that?

1350
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,660
But then it turns out the plague

1351
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,160
might have killed those people,

1352
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,660
as far as you know anyway,

1353
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,160
but people seem to be saying he's going around

1354
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,660
killing people now.

1355
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,160
They're calling him the Ripper.

1356
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,160
I'd wondered if maybe you play a serial killer in his plot.

1357
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,660
When you talk to him, he seems reasonable

1358
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,160
and like he's trying to make a cure

1359
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,160
for the plague, a panacea,

1360
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,660
but both you and Dankowski seem wary of his methods.

1361
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:05,660
He's using a kind of medicine that seems kind of folksy

1362
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:08,660
and a bit made up, so you kind of ignore it.

1363
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,160
He's got his own shit to deal with,

1364
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,660
something about a guy called Foreman Oyun

1365
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,160
and what a big problem he poses.

1366
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:16,160
Dankowski never even meets that guy, whoever he is,

1367
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,160
but because he's a trusted member of this culture,

1368
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,160
you need him to do some stuff for you.

1369
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,160
For part of the main plot, you have to help

1370
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,160
break him out of a prison to help you

1371
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,160
because the governor doesn't believe he's innocent

1372
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,160
of all the shit he's heard about him at this point.

1373
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,660
Basically, when you're playing as the Bachelor,

1374
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:32,160
the Haruspex seems a whole lot like a dangerous weirdo

1375
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,160
whose help you happen to need,

1376
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,160
but when you're playing as the Haruspex,

1377
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,660
his side of the story actually starts to make sense,

1378
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,160
and that kind of asymmetrical storytelling

1379
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,660
isn't something you tend to get in video games.

1380
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,160
In keeping with the unsettling

1381
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,660
and anxiety-inducing design of the rest of the mechanics,

1382
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:49,160
the game's dialogue system deliberately frustrates

1383
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,660
your ability to fully understand the story too.

1384
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,660
When you're talking to someone, you often have the chance

1385
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:56,160
to ask questions or make observations,

1386
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,160
but often in a chain of dialogue you can't come back to.

1387
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,160
There aren't really dialogue trees here.

1388
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,660
You ask one of several things, and that's your lot.

1389
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,660
Sometimes dialogue choices exit out of the conversation

1390
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,160
with no way to go back and progress it.

1391
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,660
The only way to learn absolutely everything you can

1392
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,660
is to load a lot of quick saves around dialogue

1393
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,660
or try to only ask questions

1394
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,660
you think you don't already know the answer to.

1395
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:19,160
There is absolutely no way this wasn't intentional.

1396
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,160
The game wants you to feel trapped in dialogue,

1397
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,660
so you have to think carefully about what to ask

1398
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,660
and if you can trust those answers to ever learn anything,

1399
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,160
and you can't go back and ask the other

1400
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,660
without the inconvenience of loading a save.

1401
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:34,160
You have to figure out what thing your character should say

1402
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,160
which won't end the talking if you want to learn more

1403
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,660
about what's going on, so you learn to talk manipulatively

1404
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:40,160
instead of truthfully.

1405
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,660
Do you really need to tell someone

1406
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:44,160
you think their idea is bad when you can play along

1407
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,160
and learn more?

1408
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,660
It makes even dialogue somewhat tense,

1409
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:49,660
uncertain what option will end the talking.

1410
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:52,160
Take into account it's possible to fail quests

1411
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,660
by saying the wrong thing,

1412
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,160
and you have a great system nestled precisely

1413
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,660
in the fact it seems unforgiving and incomplete.

1414
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:02,160
The system only feels bad if you're trained to expect

1415
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,160
to be able to go back and learn everything you want,

1416
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,660
but as we've just spent over 40 minutes covering,

1417
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:08,660
the game's about not getting what you want

1418
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:10,160
and hating people for it.

1419
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,660
One thing that complicates discussions of the writing

1420
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,160
is the fact that the game has had

1421
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,160
two English translations now.

1422
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,160
The first, which came out when the game was released overseas

1423
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,660
in 2005, was notoriously so strange

1424
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:23,160
that some sections of the game are borderline impossible

1425
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,660
to understand without a guide or a philosophy degree,

1426
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:28,160
and some sections were even taken out completely

1427
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,660
for foreign releases because they just didn't make sense.

1428
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,660
The HD remaster has a new, improved translation

1429
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,660
and has the cut parts put back in.

1430
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,160
It also has new voice recordings,

1431
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:41,160
which is good because the last ones weren't great.

1432
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:45,660
Your sensitive hands kill more often than present life.

1433
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:48,160
You will inevitably cause harm,

1434
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:52,160
and this smartass won't consider the losses at all.

1435
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,160
You both lack mercy.

1436
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,660
See, that's just not fitting at all.

1437
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:58,660
The Changeling is an ambiguously magical little girl,

1438
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:02,160
not an evil, elderly crone witch.

1439
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,160
Simon, the land has cast out a monster

1440
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,160
from the bowels to bridle his impudence.

1441
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,660
Katharina. Oh, sorry, she's Katharina in this version.

1442
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,660
Is one of those clairvoyants I mentioned earlier,

1443
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:15,160
but she's also whacked out on morphine most of the time.

1444
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,660
This voice really isn't appropriate for her.

1445
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,160
I need morphine.

1446
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,160
Yeah, that's better.

1447
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,160
The new vocalists are much more fitting

1448
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,660
and better directed, too.

1449
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,660
They would have had to re-record the vocals anyway

1450
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,160
because the translation they were going from was pretty bad.

1451
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,160
For example, there's a cultural term

1452
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,160
the Haruspex uses a lot to refer to the Bachelor,

1453
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,660
uh, oinon.

1454
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,160
Go, oinon.

1455
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,660
I need time to pick up my tools.

1456
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:41,160
Um, the original vocalizations,

1457
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,160
well, they're left a little bit to be desired.

1458
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,660
Go, onion.

1459
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,660
I need to collect the tools.

1460
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:50,160
This epidemic acts as if it has a mind of its own.

1461
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,660
This disease behaves as though it has a mind of its own.

1462
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,160
Yeah, see, maybe they forgot to delete a sentence there.

1463
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:56,660
I don't know.

1464
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:59,660
Traces of the supernatural are found more often

1465
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:02,660
than most reasonable and wise people would like.

1466
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,660
Mmm, not really feeling it.

1467
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,660
Chimeras that had been...

1468
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:06,660
Ha ha ha ha!

1469
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,160
Chimeras worship...

1470
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,660
Okay, that's a little better.

1471
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,660
That sounds like it might even be a way of saying it.

1472
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,660
It's Chimera, right?

1473
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:19,160
Oh, God, I don't even know anymore how to pronounce...

1474
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,660
Chimera. Please be Chimera.

1475
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:22,660
Chimera.

1476
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,160
What? WHAT?!

1477
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,160
Screwed this one up.

1478
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,160
Needs fixing.

1479
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,160
That is not how you pronounce Chimera.

1480
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,160
It sounds like someone machine-translated

1481
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,160
the original Russian script into English

1482
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,160
then went through doing right-click thesaurus

1483
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,660
to make it sound smarter.

1484
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,660
It's tough to pass and it really throws me off.

1485
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,660
Every time a character's side of a conversation

1486
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,660
turns out to be three lines of this kind of text,

1487
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,160
my brain groans at me and I have to pause for a sec

1488
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,660
to mentally prepare to read it.

1489
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,660
The game's weird writing was like that

1490
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,660
in the original game too.

1491
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,660
Russians don't walk around talking like this.

1492
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,160
This is just how it was written.

1493
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,160
I originally thought this line in the old translation,

1494
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,660
immortal dragon, was weird,

1495
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,660
like they were trying to refer to Simon

1496
00:52:58,660 --> 00:52:59,660
as a mythological creature

1497
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:01,660
but accidentally refer to him as a creature

1498
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:04,160
that we have a lot of visual connotations for.

1499
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,160
The new one says Leviathan,

1500
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,160
which seems more appropriate.

1501
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,660
If you call someone a Leviathan,

1502
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,660
it sounds metaphorical and less literal,

1503
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,660
but I checked and the original Russian version

1504
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,160
calls him an immortal dragon too,

1505
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,660
and dragon doesn't have any special metaphorical meaning

1506
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,160
in Russian. It just means dragon.

1507
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,660
It's just a weirdly written game

1508
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,660
that the old translation makes even weirder

1509
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,160
by taking it way too literally,

1510
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,160
but there's an interesting intersection going on here.

1511
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,160
You see, while the translation is improved,

1512
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,660
at least in my opinion, the sense of strangeness

1513
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,660
in the unforgiving and alien culture

1514
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:35,160
of the strange town was completely intended.

1515
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:38,660
Some people actually defend the older translation

1516
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:40,160
for adding to this feel.

1517
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,660
Like, some people will actually say

1518
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:44,160
that the worst translation is better

1519
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,660
at getting across the feel the game is going for.

1520
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:49,160
Now, we're gonna get into some subjective territory here.

1521
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,660
We're gonna have to peel away a few layers

1522
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,660
of the onion of interpretation,

1523
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:56,660
but while I can see that argument, I...

1524
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:59,160
Phony! You're a fucking phony!

1525
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,160
Okay, fine.

1526
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,660
I have something embarrassing to admit

1527
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,160
about my relationship with this game,

1528
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,160
which really throws my pretentious hipster credentials

1529
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,160
into question.

1530
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,660
You telling him you're a phony yet?

1531
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,160
Yeah, I'm doing it now.

1532
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,160
Are you doing it?

1533
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,160
Y-y-yeah, I'm doing it.

1534
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,160
Are you doing it?

1535
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,660
Get out of my fucking video!

1536
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:20,160
You see, I have two failed prior attempts

1537
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,660
to make it through this game.

1538
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:24,160
In 2013, I found the Rock Paper Shotgun articles

1539
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,160
by Quentin Smith, hallowed be his name,

1540
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,160
and found them really convincing on the subject

1541
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,660
of how games could be.

1542
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,160
They really opened my eyes and changed

1543
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,660
how I think about gaming,

1544
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,660
so I decided to try the game for myself.

1545
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:37,660
The original translation bounced me right off.

1546
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:39,660
It was a little too much for me to want to sit down

1547
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:42,160
and put time into when I bought it in 2013

1548
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,160
and had a degree to pretend to work for

1549
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,160
and Gundam to watch,

1550
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,660
and I actually took a picture on my phone

1551
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,660
of the funniest thing about this experience,

1552
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,660
which was when the most understandable sentence

1553
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:53,160
I'd read so far was a character apologizing

1554
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,160
for if they don't make much sense.

1555
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,160
I was like, yeah, thanks,

1556
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,660
so I stopped.

1557
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:00,660
Then a couple of years later, I tried again,

1558
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,160
pushed past my initial problems,

1559
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,660
hated being alone with my thoughts

1560
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,160
when I was walking around the town

1561
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,660
because most of my thoughts were about

1562
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,160
how good Turn A Gundam was,

1563
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,660
and basically did such a bad job

1564
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,160
I was dying over and over on day two

1565
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,660
and realized I'd have to go back

1566
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,160
and gave up.

1567
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,160
So I spent years agreeing with critics,

1568
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,660
convinced of their arguments

1569
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,160
that games could do more things

1570
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,160
than be viscerally entertaining or mechanically fun,

1571
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,660
despite failing to play the central game

1572
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,160
many used in their example

1573
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,160
of the value of negative experiences.

1574
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,660
It was too negative for me, apparently.

1575
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,660
Only now, with the HD edition

1576
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,160
and the new translation,

1577
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,160
did I finally stick with it long enough

1578
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,160
to truly enter into the experience,

1579
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,160
and I'm glad I finally got to do that,

1580
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,660
and I think I really needed the better translation

1581
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,160
to help bring me in.

1582
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,660
That older version probably has its charms,

1583
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:48,160
and I'm sure it must considering the game had defenders

1584
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,660
for almost a decade before the fixed version came out,

1585
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:53,160
but it was certainly too much for me.

1586
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,160
However, even the new and improved version

1587
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,660
of the game still has its problems.

1588
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,160
We've already covered aspects of the game

1589
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,160
that are just not gonna be for everyone.

1590
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,660
The slow pace, the tone,

1591
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:03,160
the feel of the gameplay and mechanics.

1592
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,660
Now let's talk about the actual problems.

1593
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:11,660
♪♪

1594
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:14,160
Part four, the jank.

1595
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,160
One thing that's absolutely necessary

1596
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,160
to successfully progressing the story

1597
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,660
is to read your mail.

1598
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,660
You get letters from people over the course of the day,

1599
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,160
and the only way to know you get them

1600
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,660
is to know you get them,

1601
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,660
and the only way to read them is to hit the L key

1602
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:29,160
on your keyboard to open up the letters menu.

1603
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,160
The game doesn't tell you this.

1604
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,160
The game's tutorial, amazing in its own way as it is,

1605
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,660
fails to tell you one of the most critical things

1606
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,660
you need to know. If you don't read your mail,

1607
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:41,160
you straight up will not know what to do on some days,

1608
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,660
and as far as I can tell, nothing in the game tells you

1609
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:45,660
unless you check your keyboard options.

1610
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,160
This is a huge oversight.

1611
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,160
The game does do interesting things

1612
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,660
with not giving you proper information,

1613
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:52,660
like it never tells you that food prices

1614
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,660
are about to ruin your life, or it doesn't tell you

1615
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,660
that some of your quests will end in disaster

1616
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:58,160
and you maybe shouldn't have bothered

1617
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,660
or run away with the money,

1618
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,660
and if someone's not going to get to those moments

1619
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:02,660
because they didn't understand

1620
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,160
what they were supposed to be doing

1621
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,160
or got annoyed they hadn't even been told

1622
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,660
a core feature by the game,

1623
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:09,160
it's a genuine flaw.

1624
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,660
Speaking of the flaw...

1625
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,160
Hear that thud?

1626
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,160
When you have too many items in your inventory,

1627
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,160
the item drops on the ground in a bag

1628
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,160
and you have to drop something else to pick it up.

1629
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,160
If this is a plot-important item,

1630
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,660
not hearing that and looking down to swap something out

1631
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,160
could cause a lot of problems.

1632
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,160
Ha ha ha.

1633
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,160
I think the game could have done a much better job

1634
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,160
of letting you know when you don't have room for something.

1635
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,660
This is a section from the changeling story later on.

1636
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:36,160
I can't pick up this bag because my inventory is full,

1637
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,160
but the game has no way of telling me,

1638
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,160
so I'm just sitting here getting stabbed to death

1639
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,160
and then I have to load a save and drop something

1640
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,160
in order to pick this up.

1641
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,660
This isn't as critical,

1642
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,160
but it showcases the problem in a funny way.

1643
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,660
If you sneak up on a rat

1644
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,160
instead of letting them see you and chase you,

1645
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,160
you can pick them up and actually use them

1646
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,660
in rat races later on,

1647
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:54,160
but if your inventory is full,

1648
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,660
they just turn into a bag with a rat in it.

1649
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,160
If you can't progress the story

1650
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,660
because you dropped something

1651
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,660
or you're too busy micromanaging what's in your inventory

1652
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,660
in case you get given something important,

1653
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,160
then you're being made to miss out

1654
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,660
on what's good about the game

1655
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,660
by a poorly implemented mechanic.

1656
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,660
Pathologic is already not for everybody

1657
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,660
and the mechanical stuff like this only detracts...

1658
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,660
Oh, fuck!

1659
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:15,160
The mechanical stuff like this

1660
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,660
only detracts from what makes it truly unique.

1661
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,160
There's a lot of jank in the game.

1662
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,660
AI bugs out if you stand in the wrong place

1663
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:24,660
during fights, spins in circles,

1664
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:26,660
or stands still and waits to die.

1665
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:28,660
You can get stuck in level geometry sometimes.

1666
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,660
The physics like to explode.

1667
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,660
The thing is, a lot of these sorts of problems

1668
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:34,660
are a result of the game existing at all.

1669
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:37,160
Like, you could spend a ton of man hours

1670
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,660
making the AI work perfectly in fights

1671
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:41,160
that aren't on completely flat ground,

1672
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,660
or you can get the game out

1673
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,160
before your team goes bust,

1674
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,660
and in many ways, much like Eye Divine Cybermancy

1675
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,660
or Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines,

1676
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:50,160
AI bugs are a good thing.

1677
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,660
They're a reminder of how much bloody work it took

1678
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:54,160
to whip this thing into existence

1679
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,660
with the available tools.

1680
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,160
I still shudder when I think about

1681
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,660
how to get the source engine to do things

1682
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,160
I or Vampire did, and Pathologic's engine

1683
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,660
seems like it was made out of whole cloth.

1684
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:04,660
Do you have any idea how hard that is?

1685
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:06,660
Video games are hard to program.

1686
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:09,160
It takes years of work to make something good.

1687
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,160
Games, as a rule, even the stable-looking ones,

1688
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,660
are usually at their core hugely hacked together

1689
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,160
to barely do whatever they do,

1690
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:19,160
and even what seems like simple, slight changes

1691
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,660
run the risk of absolutely obliterating

1692
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:23,160
everything you hold dear,

1693
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,160
so a lot of the game's weakest aspects

1694
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,160
feel like a compromise for the inability

1695
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,660
or instability of the engine.

1696
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:31,160
In the story, for example, sometimes characters interact.

1697
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,160
They talk or get one another to do things,

1698
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,660
but while you're present,

1699
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,160
characters are never doing anything.

1700
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,660
They're just standing where they're supposed to be standing

1701
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,660
and you go over and talk to them and you get the impression

1702
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,160
they're in the middle of doing it

1703
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,660
or taking a break or something.

1704
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,660
Sometimes characters meet up to discuss something

1705
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,660
or get attacked by soldiers and escape,

1706
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,660
but it's always just happened when you walk in

1707
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:51,660
and everything's already over whenever you're there.

1708
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:53,160
It's not super immersion-breaking,

1709
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,660
but a little more interaction

1710
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,660
or being able to watch the characters do the things

1711
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,660
you're told they did might have been nice.

1712
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,660
Also, characters sharing a space together

1713
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:02,160
don't seem to regard each other.

1714
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,660
They either do their idle animation

1715
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,660
and occasionally say lines like they normally do

1716
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:07,660
just next to each other...

1717
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:09,660
Yes? What is there to talk about now?

1718
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:11,660
Are you sick or something?

1719
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:14,160
How's my brother? Any news on him?

1720
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,660
...or they're completely frozen in place.

1721
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:19,160
You never even get to watch a conversation

1722
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,660
between two characters.

1723
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,160
Even when they're in the same room,

1724
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,660
you talk to each of them separately.

1725
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:25,160
Again, these aren't things I would really

1726
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,660
criticize the game for.

1727
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:28,660
These are reflective of the absolutely minuscule amount

1728
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:30,660
of budget and time the developers had

1729
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,160
and the limitations of their engine.

1730
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,660
These are things that it would have been nice

1731
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,660
to see working better but aren't a huge problem

1732
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:37,160
when you're actually playing.

1733
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,660
There's other technical problems too.

1734
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:40,160
There's this weird bug where the screen's

1735
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,160
entire color palette shifts when certain effects are playing

1736
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,160
like fires or blood splatters during combat.

1737
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,660
I'm sure there's a fix for this,

1738
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,160
but I decided to just live with it.

1739
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,660
It felt in the spirit of things to do that,

1740
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:50,660
but it's still very distracting

1741
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,160
and definitely not intentional.

1742
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,160
All in all, all the little things like this

1743
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,660
contribute to the overall feeling

1744
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:57,660
that the creators had lofty ideas

1745
01:00:57,660 --> 01:00:59,660
for their story and world full of characters

1746
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:01,660
to interact with and environments to explore

1747
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:03,660
but were limited in what they could accomplish.

1748
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,660
However, it's important not to confuse limitation

1749
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:07,660
with artistic choice because some things

1750
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,660
in the game are easy to dismiss as problems

1751
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:12,160
but work in the context of the story that's being told

1752
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,160
and the overall effect being attempted.

1753
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,660
On that note, we haven't really talked

1754
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,160
about the graphics yet.

1755
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,660
Visually, even for the time, the game

1756
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,160
was regarded as pretty ugly.

1757
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,160
Everything is a weird angular facsimile

1758
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,660
of what it's supposed to be.

1759
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,160
The color palette is drab.

1760
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,660
Infected and dying districts tint things

1761
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:30,160
even uglier shades, and all the minor NPCs

1762
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,660
look the same as each other.

1763
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:34,160
However, I think that ugliness was deliberate

1764
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,160
and actually serves a purpose.

1765
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,660
Oh, no, it's the pretentious police!

1766
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:39,660
They found me!

1767
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,160
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1768
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,660
The game is set in a dying rural town.

1769
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:47,660
The sky is never clear, everyone's sick,

1770
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:49,660
everything is depressing, and the filters

1771
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,660
that turn up in infected areas make everything

1772
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:53,160
even more sickly.

1773
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,660
The fairly low texture detail and polygon count

1774
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:57,660
do end up contributing to this look

1775
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:59,160
and feel in their own way.

1776
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,660
By being not much to look at,

1777
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:03,160
the downer tone set by the story and mechanics

1778
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,160
isn't thrown away by looking pretty.

1779
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,660
The game's art design when it comes to characters

1780
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:10,160
or the more interesting locations is imaginative enough

1781
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,160
that even if it doesn't look visually great,

1782
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,660
you can see what they're going for

1783
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:15,660
and understand what it's supposed to be at least.

1784
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:17,160
So, at least in my opinion,

1785
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,160
the art style contributes to the feel.

1786
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,160
I think it works that it looks like this

1787
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,160
and not other ways, but I'm not sure

1788
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,160
if I'm happy with saying that because if the game

1789
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,660
had looked better, like if it was on par with Half-Life 2,

1790
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,160
I don't think I'd have been saying,

1791
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,660
this should have looked worse, would I?

1792
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:32,660
It's one of those things where because it works

1793
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:34,660
well enough for what it is, I don't feel a need

1794
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,160
to complain that the graphics are bad

1795
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,660
even though obviously they could be better.

1796
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:39,160
People can decide for themselves

1797
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,160
where the experience is improved or worsened

1798
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,160
by things like bugs or inventory stuff

1799
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,660
or the combat or graphics or translation

1800
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:47,660
and ultimately the game is what you get out of it,

1801
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:50,660
and for some people the line of what makes a game good

1802
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:52,160
is very far away from anything

1803
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,160
any version of this game is doing.

1804
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,160
It's completely understandable why some people

1805
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,660
don't engage with the game or want to and bounce off it.

1806
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:01,160
I certainly did that the first two times

1807
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,660
so I can respect that.

1808
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:04,160
Like I said, it's not fun.

1809
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,160
I can't really recommend you play it.

1810
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,660
That's why I'm here sharing what I think is interesting

1811
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,160
about the experience and not telling you

1812
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,660
to play it for yourself.

1813
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:13,660
I suffered so you didn't have to.

1814
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:16,160
["Bloodborne"]

1815
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,160
Once you get over the initial humps

1816
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,160
and learn to deal with the difficult elements,

1817
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,160
cope with the survival mechanics and get good at walking,

1818
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,660
wow, what a phrase, get good at walking.

1819
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:27,660
Learn to do a repetitive, unsatisfying thing

1820
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:29,160
on your way to a goal.

1821
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,160
Walking in Pathologic reminds me a little bit

1822
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,160
of doing exercise or cleaning my kitchen.

1823
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:36,160
It's not fun, but it's important to learn how to do it

1824
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,660
or the empty cans of kidney beans that still have some juice

1825
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:40,660
and a bean or two in them you left on the side

1826
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:42,660
to figure out which bin to throw them out in

1827
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,160
start to smell after getting left there

1828
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,160
for a week and a half.

1829
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,160
That's not a real story.

1830
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,160
Once you figure out what the game is demanding of you,

1831
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,160
it doesn't stay as difficult as it seems.

1832
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,160
I think people tend to overstate the game's unpleasantness

1833
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,160
when it's not a constant.

1834
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,160
It's just an early spike as it teaches you

1835
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,160
what the experience is going to be like.

1836
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,660
Once you get into the swing of things,

1837
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:02,160
The Bachelor is a cake walk but without the cake.

1838
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,160
I mean, you aren't exactly given no help.

1839
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,660
Almost everyone important trusts The Bachelor,

1840
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:08,660
and he starts out with some useful items,

1841
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:10,660
a weapon, decent money, some medicine,

1842
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:12,660
and he can make a whole lot more during the game

1843
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:14,660
doing quests for the rich people who trust him.

1844
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:16,660
It is possible to get on top of the game's economy

1845
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:18,660
and survival mechanics as The Bachelor.

1846
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:20,660
It gets hard at times and even harder

1847
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:22,660
if you insist on doing the good guy things in quests

1848
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:24,160
like not running away with all the money

1849
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,660
or food you bought for that one quest

1850
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:28,160
or giving away literally all the money you have

1851
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,160
saving six random people from getting wrongly executed,

1852
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:32,660
which I didn't do.

1853
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,660
I loaded my save after this cutscene played

1854
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:37,160
and kept the money, and I'm a bad person for it,

1855
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,660
but even if you do all the good guy things,

1856
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:41,660
if you know what you're doing and take the opportunities

1857
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:43,660
that are given to you, you can make it through alive

1858
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:45,660
even while being a good person.

1859
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:47,660
The Bachelor's story is technically quite hard

1860
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:49,160
but ultimately forgiving.

1861
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:53,160
It's a pretty balanced experience all in all.

1862
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,160
Anyway, the Haruspex's story begins with you

1863
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,660
bleeding to death.

1864
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:59,160
Upon arriving at his hometown via the train station

1865
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,160
after ten years away studying surgery,

1866
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,660
the Haruspex, Artemy Burakh,

1867
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:04,660
has been stabbed repeatedly in a fight

1868
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:07,160
with multiple people who believed him to be a murderer

1869
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,160
trying to escape via the station.

1870
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,660
Artemy's just got here and he's already bleeding out

1871
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:14,160
while wanted for his own father's murder,

1872
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,660
and this isn't just a cutscene that happens

1873
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:17,660
before the game starts. Oh, no.

1874
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:19,660
You begin the game at the train station

1875
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:21,660
surrounded by corpses with your health low,

1876
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:23,160
your reputation even lower,

1877
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,660
and your hunger and exhaustion meters

1878
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,160
already half full.

1879
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,160
Now if you were wondering why the Haruspex

1880
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,160
did what he did in his playthrough,

1881
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,160
here's the first of many reasons why.

1882
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,160
It turns out that for Artemy,

1883
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:37,160
everything was fucked all the time.

1884
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,660
Yeah, sure, the Bachelor playthrough was pretty hard.

1885
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:41,660
You maybe even figured out how to play it

1886
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:43,160
and not die too much.

1887
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,160
I bet you thought you were good at this game.

1888
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:47,160
That's where you're wrong.

1889
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,660
Daniil Dankovsky's fun step vacation

1890
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:51,160
was just the tutorial

1891
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:54,160
for Artemy Burakh's tormentous nightmare.

1892
01:05:54,660 --> 01:06:00,660
♪♪

1893
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:03,160
Some people refer to playing the Haruspex as hard mode,

1894
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,660
and I must admit, at the beginning,

1895
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:07,160
it is a little bit like getting stabbed in the dick,

1896
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,160
but after that it gets much worse.

1897
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,160
Remember that horrifying moral quandary

1898
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,160
as Dankovsky where you could risk

1899
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,160
six innocent people getting executed

1900
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,160
if you choose not to get involved in something

1901
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,660
that isn't your business anyway?

1902
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:20,660
The Haruspex has a moral quandary

1903
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:22,660
a million billion times harder,

1904
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:24,660
and it's his first quest.

1905
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,660
After getting chased into the warehouse territory

1906
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:28,660
by an angry mob, you go inside

1907
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:30,160
and meet a gang of children.

1908
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,160
This gang was there in the Bachelor's playthrough,

1909
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,160
but you only really visited them, like, once.

1910
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,160
They weren't really very interested in talking to you,

1911
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,660
and the Bachelor was too busy sucking up

1912
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,160
to the important people to care about a bunch of children.

1913
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,660
When you talk to Notkin, their leader,

1914
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:43,660
he says they have a rebel who stole something

1915
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:45,660
from them to defect to a rival gang.

1916
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:48,160
He says if you do him the favor of killing them for him,

1917
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,660
he'll give you a gun and some ammo.

1918
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:51,660
Now, I don't want to tip your hand as to whether

1919
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:53,660
a gun might be a useful item to have in this playthrough,

1920
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:55,160
but as soon as I left the building,

1921
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,660
a man tried to beat me to death.

1922
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:58,660
Remember that reputation mechanic?

1923
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:00,160
It turns out that when it's low enough,

1924
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,660
in addition to shopkeepers not trading with you,

1925
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:05,660
all regular NPCs will attack you in the street.

1926
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:08,160
Oh, and because these people are just law-abiding citizens

1927
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,660
attacking a wanted criminal,

1928
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:11,660
killing them in self-defense is a crime,

1929
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:14,160
and your reputation will drop even further.

1930
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,660
Ah.

1931
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:17,660
Mmm.

1932
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:19,160
So either you run away to preserve

1933
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,660
what reputation you have left

1934
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:22,160
and try to do good things to correct it

1935
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,160
or fight back and make everything worse.

1936
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,660
Good luck, fucker!

1937
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:29,160
Have those guys seen me?

1938
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,660
Yep, they've seen me.

1939
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:32,160
I feel very seen right now.

1940
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,660
Since fighting is more of a fact

1941
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:36,160
of the Haruspex's short life, yeah,

1942
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,160
having a gun would really help with that.

1943
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,660
So you go out into the steppe and...

1944
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,660
Oh. Oh, fuck off.

1945
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:45,160
Of course. This was a gang of children.

1946
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,660
Of course the rebel member is a kid.

1947
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:49,660
So you can tell him off and send him on his way

1948
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:51,660
for a minuscule reputation boost,

1949
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,660
and if you kill him, it drops a bunch

1950
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:56,660
because, you know, you've killed a child,

1951
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:59,160
but your reputation already can't get much worse,

1952
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,660
and Notkin's offer of a gun is a pretty big deal,

1953
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,660
and this kid has a schmowder on him.

1954
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:05,660
It's one of the critical items.

1955
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:07,660
It's basically the one thing in the game

1956
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:10,160
you can't pass up an opportunity to get.

1957
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:13,160
Plus he's in a gang, so he knew the risks.

1958
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:16,160
So you can get a gun super early on in Artemy's playthrough

1959
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,660
but at a significant moral cost.

1960
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:20,660
Obviously the kid is just polygons,

1961
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:22,660
but if you take the roleplaying seriously

1962
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:25,160
or even just stop for a moment and ask yourself

1963
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:28,660
if you would do this in real life if it meant survival,

1964
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:30,660
there's a lot of feelings to unpack here.

1965
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:32,660
I mean, let's recap.

1966
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:35,660
In many modern RPGs, child murder is still a thing

1967
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:37,660
that won't even go on the table.

1968
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:39,660
Get on the fucking table, MacReady!

1969
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:42,660
Oh, I'll be back for you in Fallout 4, fucker,

1970
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,660
when you're old enough to die!

1971
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:47,660
In Pathologic, one of the most taboo things

1972
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:51,660
there is in gaming is one character's first quest

1973
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:54,160
and there's significant personal justification

1974
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,660
for going through with it.

1975
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:58,160
You are dying and you need the stuff

1976
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,660
you get for it desperately.

1977
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:02,160
You just have to find a way to live with the fact

1978
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:04,660
that you are now wanted for a murder you definitely

1979
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:07,160
did commit along with the one murder you didn't.

1980
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:09,160
Now it's not all bad for the Haruspex.

1981
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,660
Okay, it is, but he gets one thing.

1982
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:14,160
As a Menkhu, he can also dissect corpses,

1983
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:16,160
a thing the Bachelor had to get you out of prison

1984
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,160
to do for him.

1985
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,160
Every corpse you come across carries a heart,

1986
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:21,160
a liver, one kidney,

1987
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,160
I don't know, just go with it,

1988
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,160
and some blood.

1989
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:26,160
These grisly items form a new kind of currency.

1990
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,660
Various characters in the game will trade you

1991
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:30,160
really useful stuff for these,

1992
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:32,660
opening up an entirely new black market economy.

1993
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:35,160
Characters who wouldn't even talk to the Bachelor

1994
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,160
are now an extra tool for survival

1995
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,160
if you know where to look.

1996
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,160
Give me the herbs, worm.

1997
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:43,160
Artemy's father's secret lab has tools to make medicines

1998
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:46,160
that can raise immunity and lower infection super easily

1999
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:48,160
making him infinitely more survivable

2000
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:50,160
when it comes to the plague than Dankovsky

2001
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,160
if you put effort into perfecting the recipes.

2002
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:54,160
They work like the medicine you've used before

2003
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,660
but much stronger and with much less downsides

2004
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:57,660
if you get them right.

2005
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:59,660
I really like the asymmetrical storytelling

2006
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:01,660
that's happening with this aspect of the gameplay.

2007
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:04,160
Not only is it just an extra layer of fun stuff

2008
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,160
to learn and master to survive in the town

2009
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,660
and it feels good getting it right,

2010
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:09,160
but you're also seeing the sides of the world

2011
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:12,160
that Dankovsky's beliefs just denied him access to.

2012
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,160
He thought that this medicine was made up

2013
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,660
and here it is keeping you alive

2014
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:17,160
even if you get infected as Artemy

2015
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,160
and actually it's really hard not to as him.

2016
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,160
It's much less of a problem

2017
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,160
because of all these herbal remedies you've got

2018
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:24,160
but that's about it, so you're fucked,

2019
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:26,160
but once the plague becomes a problem,

2020
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,660
you can live long enough to be killed by something else

2021
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:30,660
like this great bit where as soon as you leave a building

2022
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:32,160
it spawns two muggers outside

2023
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,660
and they both throw knives at you

2024
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:35,160
which kills you instantly.

2025
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,660
At the very least, if you have to defend yourself

2026
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:38,660
and lower your rep, you get to keep whatever

2027
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:42,160
was in their pockets and their meat pockets

2028
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,160
and with the new economy,

2029
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,160
maybe not being accepted by society

2030
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,660
isn't as much of a death sentence.

2031
01:10:46,660 --> 01:10:48,660
I really do feel like Burak doesn't enjoy

2032
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:50,160
unnecessary violence.

2033
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,160
He's an educated man.

2034
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,160
He seems quite noble in a way.

2035
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,660
He wouldn't do it if he didn't have to.

2036
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:56,160
It's unbecoming of his station.

2037
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,160
Wait, does that guy have a shotgun?

2038
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,660
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

2039
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:01,160
Getting a shotgun. One second.

2040
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,660
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

2041
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:05,660
Getting a shotgun on day one feels a little broken

2042
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:07,660
after how late I got one as the Bachelor,

2043
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:09,160
but what makes it extra engaging

2044
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:11,160
is the knowledge that I'll probably need it.

2045
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,660
Selling weapons as the Harrisbacks

2046
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:14,660
is even more nail-biting than before.

2047
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:17,160
Just because of the way his campaign is set up,

2048
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:20,160
you will need everything you could buy with that money

2049
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,160
even more desperately than before,

2050
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:24,160
but you also kinda need the g-

2051
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:26,160
Wha-come on! What the fuck?!

2052
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,660
There's five guys?!

2053
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:30,160
So it's about now that I realized why Artemy ended up

2054
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,160
with his reputation as the Ripper.

2055
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,160
He was in a desperate place,

2056
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:35,660
so he was forced to make difficult decisions,

2057
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:37,160
and the few options available to him

2058
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,660
involve getting his hands dirty.

2059
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:40,660
The story makes a lot of sense now.

2060
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:42,160
He wasn't a serial killer.

2061
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,160
He was a guy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time

2062
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,660
and has to fight to survive

2063
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:47,660
and solve his own father's murder

2064
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:49,160
and maybe help the town,

2065
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,660
and one of his skills happens to be surgical ability.

2066
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:53,660
Luckily, there are some chances to redeem yourself.

2067
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:55,660
You hear one of your attackers from the opening

2068
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:57,660
got away and is bleeding out in the graveyard.

2069
01:11:57,660 --> 01:11:59,160
This guy needs a blood transfusion,

2070
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,660
and if I save his life, maybe he'll help clear my name.

2071
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:04,160
So you traipse all the way across the entire town

2072
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:06,160
to get to the hunchback who will draw some of your blood

2073
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,660
for you if you have enough health to spare.

2074
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:09,160
Pick it up.

2075
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,660
Don't forget to pick it up this time

2076
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,660
or you'll have to come all the way back again!

2077
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:15,160
And then take a long stroll all the way back.

2078
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,160
Did I say stroll? I meant to say...

2079
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,660
Seven guys are chasing me.

2080
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:20,660
Oh, God, stop it! Leave me alone!

2081
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:23,160
I'm a good person. It's just a misunderstanding.

2082
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,660
Oh, thank God, a sewing needle.

2083
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:26,160
Hey, kid, take it. Thanks for the medicine.

2084
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,160
I'll be needing that. Anyway, back to being chased.

2085
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:31,160
The walking in the easy mode, the bachelor's playthrough,

2086
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:33,160
was pretty tense at the best of times,

2087
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,160
but now it's an active fight for survival.

2088
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,660
Leave me alone, please!

2089
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,660
Just let me do a good thing!

2090
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:41,160
Why don't you try walking a mile in my shoes?

2091
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,660
You know what? Don't put your feet

2092
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:44,160
anywhere near my shoes.

2093
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,160
You can all put both of your feet

2094
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:48,160
in the grave.

2095
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:49,660
Look, don't criticize my one-liner, okay?

2096
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:51,160
I'm under a lot of stress.

Fuck!

2117
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:31,660
So remember the perspective thing I talked about?

2118
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:34,160
The Haruspex, as a former local of this culture,

2119
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,160
is trusted by the people who hate the bachelor

2120
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,160
and spends a lot more time in places

2121
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:39,660
the bachelor only got to go once

2122
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:41,660
and then got the shit kicked out of him for going to.

2123
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:44,160
Oh, yes, fucking get him, mate. Yeah!

2124
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:47,160
So you see a completely different side of the story

2125
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,660
and of the town since you spend time

2126
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:50,160
being public enemy number one.

2127
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,160
The reputation mechanics basically didn't come up

2128
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,660
in the bachelor's run unless you killed people for no reason,

2129
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:56,160
but now you have to face the problems

2130
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:59,160
having a low one poses and build it back up to survive.

2131
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:02,160
It's hyper-engaging, not just because it's hard

2132
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:04,160
but because you remember how it was before.

2133
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:07,160
It's the same conjuring trick as day two's food shortage.

2134
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:10,160
Everything is different and scary all over again.

2135
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:12,160
I love it. It's hard. It's punishing.

2136
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,160
Arguably, it's incredibly unfair, but I love it.

2137
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,660
You learn more about aspects of the plot

2138
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:18,660
the town jester had no idea about.

2139
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:20,660
For example, you are the reason the Stamatins

2140
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:22,160
never turned up on day two

2141
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:24,660
when cowardly little Dankowski tried to flee the town.

2142
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:26,160
Maria found out about the plan

2143
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:28,160
and got you to convince them to stay

2144
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:30,160
by telling them you'd invented some cool new alcohol.

2145
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:32,160
The Stamatins are really into the local drink,

2146
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:36,160
an absinthe-like spirit with possibly magical properties,

2147
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,660
and your medicines actually are derived

2148
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:39,660
from the same ingredients which you can trade

2149
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:41,160
with Andre for great stuff,

2150
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,160
and then just to keep you on your toes,

2151
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,660
once you get your reputation sorted,

2152
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:46,660
a few days later it all happens again.

2153
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:49,160
You get captured by Saburov's men and thrown in jail

2154
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:50,660
just like you did in Daniel's story,

2155
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:52,160
and here's where another aspect

2156
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:54,160
of the multi-character structure becomes clear

2157
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,660
by actively fucking you.

2158
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:57,160
When you aren't in control of a character,

2159
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,160
they make worse decisions than you did.

2160
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,660
When you talk to him, he talks like the worst

2161
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:03,660
of the options you could have chosen.

2162
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:05,160
He's naturally more of a dick.

2163
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,160
He even says random Latin phrases at you.

2164
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,160
It's great.

2165
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,660
I love this prickly little prick.

2166
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:11,160
He's just so well-characterized,

2167
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,160
and I love how much the game hammers home

2168
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,660
what an idiot he is in this version of the story.

2169
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:18,160
The big city guest jumps the gun too much.

2170
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,660
Not the mystery-solving type, really.

2171
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:24,160
But he doesn't know our traditions.

2172
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,660
He's bound to be deceived.

2173
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:28,660
Even the plays that you can go see

2174
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:30,660
call Dankowski a piece of shit.

2175
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:33,160
All in all, we can fight.

2176
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:36,160
You self-serving jerk.

2177
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:40,160
Dankowski believes the disease came from the wells.

2178
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,660
He's wrong.

2179
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:43,160
["Taps"]

2180
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:44,660
But more importantly,

2181
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:46,160
he never stages a prison break.

2182
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:48,160
You have to break yourself out.

2183
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,160
Then, later in the game,

2184
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:52,160
he fucks up a quest you did easily

2185
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:53,660
when you were playing as him,

2186
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:56,160
and then you have to break him out of prison.

2187
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,660
Nice going, Dankowski!

2188
01:15:57,660 --> 01:15:59,160
Okay, okay, fine.

2189
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,160
Don't panic. I'll bargain for your release.

2190
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:03,160
30 clips of rifle ammo?

2191
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,160
Listen, there's a plague going on.

2192
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,660
We're kind of on the clock here,

2193
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:09,660
and I'm not giving bullets to a gang of violent kids.

2194
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:11,660
Someone could get hurt.

2195
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:14,160
["Taps"]

2196
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,660
["Crying"]

2197
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:18,160
["Taps"]

2198
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:21,160
I did it. I saved the Bachelor.

2199
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:25,160
["Taps"]

2200
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:28,160
The Haruspex's main quests are to develop a panacea,

2201
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,160
an actual cure for the plague,

2202
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:32,160
to figure out who killed his father, obviously,

2203
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:35,160
and to assume his father's duties in the Kin,

2204
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,660
the people of the steppe.

2205
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:38,660
To do this, he gets to go into the abattoir

2206
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:40,160
and talk a lot with Foreman Oyun,

2207
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,660
the guy who's currently in charge

2208
01:16:41,660 --> 01:16:43,660
and the Bachelor barely heard anything about

2209
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:45,160
and who is also bad at his job

2210
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:48,160
and everyone hates and wants you to replace him.

2211
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:50,160
He starts giving you trials

2212
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:52,660
to prove your worth.

2213
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:55,160
Two of these trials are he gives you a poison

2214
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:57,660
and you have to do something for him before you die of it.

2215
01:16:57,660 --> 01:16:59,160
I'm not gonna say the trials

2216
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,160
are just tricks to try and kill you,

2217
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:03,160
but I don't know. Hmm.

2218
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:07,660
The final trial is to jump into a big hole and die.

2219
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:10,660
Uh, I'm not really sure about this one, Chief.

2220
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:12,660
He says it's a spiritual experience

2221
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:15,660
and your father did this too to take his place in the Kin,

2222
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:18,660
but no one else says anything about any trials.

2223
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:22,160
By the way, uh, if you jump in the hole, you die.

2224
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,660
There is a spiritual aspect

2225
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:25,160
to Artemy's life in the town, though.

2226
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:27,160
When you're walking around out in the steppe,

2227
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:30,160
you can hear a cool distant chanting now.

2228
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:33,160
["chanting"]

2229
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:39,160
["chanting"]

2230
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:41,160
A character later tells you the voice you're hearing

2231
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:43,160
is your father's voice. That's really cool.

2232
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:45,160
You feel more in touch with the land in his story

2233
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,660
and you kind of are.

2234
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:49,160
Artemy's medicines are made from plants that grow in the town

2235
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,660
and he can actually pick them up

2236
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:52,160
when he sees them around the place.

2237
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:55,160
The wide open empty space you felt was kind of meaningless

2238
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:57,160
as the Bachelor is suddenly rife with items

2239
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:58,160
that can help you.

2240
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,160
You start to literally see the town differently

2241
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:02,660
as the Haruspex and that's just incredibly cool.

2242
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:04,660
All the least fun bits of the first playthrough

2243
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:06,160
are ramped up to 11.

2244
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:09,160
The walking is even more excruciating and circular.

2245
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,160
The survival mechanics are harder on account

2246
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,660
of having no money and low reputation a lot of the time

2247
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:15,160
and not having as many rich friends.

2248
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:18,160
Many of the quests are deliberate in-story attempts

2249
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:21,660
to waste your time and get you killed by Foreman Oyun,

2250
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:23,160
but you're invested now.

2251
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:24,660
The suffering is engaging

2252
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:26,660
and you want to know what happens,

2253
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,160
how it all shakes out for him.

2254
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:30,160
You take the hours of walking in stride.

2255
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:31,160
Ha ha.

2256
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,160
You see all the efforts you go to as proof

2257
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:35,160
that you're willing to go through hell and high water

2258
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,160
to save this town.

2259
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,160
If you didn't like this game,

2260
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,660
you wouldn't get to this point anyway,

2261
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:40,660
but if you somehow did, it's excruciating.

2262
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:41,660
It's awful.

2263
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:43,660
You're having a shit time being bored,

2264
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:45,160
but if you care about the story,

2265
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:47,160
if you've got immersed in the atmosphere

2266
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,660
and are engaged fully with the survival mechanics

2267
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:52,160
and your understanding of how much harder things are now,

2268
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:55,160
this is the best fucking time I've had in a game in years.

2269
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,160
It's still not fun.

2270
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,660
It's something else.

2271
01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:00,660
This other thing I can't even describe.

2272
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:04,160
It's satisfying in a way I'm not used to games being.

2273
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:07,160
In a way, the game is asking you a serious question

2274
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:10,160
about whether you're willing to be punished to succeed.

2275
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:12,660
If you give up and close the game and stop playing it,

2276
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:14,660
you're basically letting the town die

2277
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:16,160
without your help, aren't you?

2278
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,160
Oyun is trying to make you give up and stop playing,

2279
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:21,160
and I'm not gonna let him.

2280
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:23,660
I'm gonna solve this shit, and I'm gonna cure the town.

2281
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:25,660
Just remember to pick up the quest items

2282
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:27,160
that drop at your feet or you have to come

2283
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:28,660
all the fucking way back again.

2284
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:30,160
You also learn how badly you'd accidentally

2285
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:31,660
messed a lot of things up as the Bachelor

2286
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:33,160
without even knowing it.

2287
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:35,160
Late in the game when you've learned a lot of the mystery

2288
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:37,660
and figured out at last how to make a cure for the plague,

2289
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:40,160
but only in extremely limited quantities

2290
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:42,160
whose source ingredient is almost impossible to get,

2291
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:44,660
there's one side quest where a giant bull

2292
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:47,160
mysteriously appears stuck to a giant steak.

2293
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:50,660
The giant bull's blood can be used as a source of the cure.

2294
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:52,660
You get some from the bull and make arrangements

2295
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:54,660
to get it pulled off the steak and rescued properly

2296
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:56,660
the next day, which might even give you enough

2297
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:58,660
to save the whole town.

2298
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:00,660
Then you remember that when you were the Bachelor,

2299
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:03,160
there was a side quest featuring a staked bull

2300
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:06,660
surrounded by people which was a clear health hazard.

2301
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:09,160
What if people congregating like that spreads the plague?

2302
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:10,660
Or what if they're planning a riot?

2303
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:13,160
So you nonchalantly ordered the bull to be burned

2304
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,660
and thought nothing of it.

You've buried us all!

2311
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:29,660
So make the most of the blood you got the day before

2312
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:31,160
because that's all you're getting.

2313
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:34,660
In any case, the Haruspex run is a spectacular playthrough.

2314
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:36,160
It's excellently designed.

2315
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:39,160
It forces you to relate to mechanics you felt like you knew

2316
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,160
but in even more knuckle-tightening ways,

2317
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:43,660
and every time you get one over on the world or Oyun

2318
01:20:43,660 --> 01:20:46,160
and survive to the next day having learned more,

2319
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:47,660
it feels like a genuine victory.

2320
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:49,660
Having an in-depth understanding of the layout

2321
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:51,660
and purpose of each part of the town

2322
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:54,160
and then getting to be a fugitive from the lore in it

2323
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:55,660
is so cool.

2324
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:57,160
You get to see your previous character

2325
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:59,160
how other people saw him instead of how you probably felt

2326
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,660
while playing as him.

2327
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:02,660
You learn more about the mysteries of the town

2328
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:04,160
from a second perspective,

2329
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:06,160
and you finally have something of an idea

2330
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:07,660
of how everything slots together.

2331
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:10,160
All the problems the game has are even more glaring

2332
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:12,660
after another 20 hours of playing a story in it,

2333
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:15,160
but I had an even better time as the Haruspex overall,

2334
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:17,660
and I'm glad I sat through the grim,

2335
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:20,160
bloody nightmare of the story to the end.

2336
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:23,160
The bitterest end.

2337
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,660
Destruction is inevitable.

2338
01:21:25,660 --> 01:21:28,160
There's no miraculous way out.

2339
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:31,160
There was nothing to hope for from the start.

2340
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,660
I can't really talk about Pathologic

2341
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:34,660
without showing you how it all shakes out.

2342
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:36,160
It's too cool not to talk about.

2343
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:38,660
By the final days, the town is a war zone.

2344
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,660
An Inquisitor and later the army have shown up

2345
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:42,160
to try to get things under control,

2346
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,660
but the commander hates the Inquisitor

2347
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:45,160
and they won't work with each other.

2348
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:47,160
He loses control of a bunch of his troops.

2349
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:49,160
Half of them die of the plague themselves,

2350
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:51,160
and all they've really added to the proceedings

2351
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:53,660
is now the army's shooting the diseased in the street,

2352
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:55,660
so I really hope that you have medicine

2353
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:57,660
because if you get too infected,

2354
01:21:57,660 --> 01:21:59,160
God, this last section is hard.

2355
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,660
Actually, here's a weird thing.

2356
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:02,160
If you get hit by the flamethrower,

2357
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,660
it does a ton of damage,

2358
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:05,160
but it also reduces your infection level.

2359
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:06,660
I think it's meant to be a metaphor

2360
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:08,160
for burning out your infection.

2361
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,160
Usually this kills you, but due to a bug,

2362
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,660
if you somehow survive the fire

2363
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,160
because you got out of dodge super quick

2364
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:14,660
and had a lot of health,

2365
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:16,160
if it reduces your infection past zero,

2366
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:17,660
it cures you of the disease.

2367
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:20,160
Hey, thanks for that, you little fucker.

2368
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:23,160
The disease itself is chasing you down

2369
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:25,160
in an evolved, even faster form

2370
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:27,160
that looks like angels made of blood.

2371
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,660
It's a nightmare.

2372
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:30,660
The army's brought a giant cannon

2373
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:33,160
and has orders to shell the entire area to the ground

2374
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:35,660
to prevent the plague from spreading if it comes to that,

2375
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:37,660
and it is coming to that.

2376
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:39,660
However, after a lot of false starts

2377
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:41,160
and internal politicking

2378
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:42,660
and generally getting messed around,

2379
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:45,160
your characters manage to find a solution to the plague.

2380
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:48,660
The trouble is each character finds their own solution.

2381
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:50,660
The Bachelor has helped develop a vaccine

2382
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:53,160
which can protect the healthy from getting infected

2383
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:54,660
and falls in with the Kains,

2384
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:56,160
the utopian academics and elites

2385
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:58,160
who helped develop the Polyhedron,

2386
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:00,160
the impossible structure next to their house

2387
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:02,660
that has kept most of the town's children safe inside

2388
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:05,160
and may now house Simon's soul.

2389
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,160
It's a marvelous, miraculous thing

2390
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:09,160
that heralds a new and beautiful future.

2391
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:12,160
He also comes to think the town is a lost cause.

2392
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:14,160
He's sick of the babblings of its people

2393
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:16,160
whose customs have prevented him from helping them.

2394
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,660
Over the course of the game,

2395
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:19,660
the Bachelor's map of the town evolves

2396
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:21,160
as he learns new things

2397
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:23,660
and gets more and more disillusioned with his quest.

2398
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:26,660
To the Bachelor, the town is an ugly and disgusting thing,

2399
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:28,660
crammed on a hill where it shouldn't

2400
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:31,160
with its blood and darkness seeping into the soil,

2401
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:34,160
and eventually the beautiful, mathematical Polyhedron

2402
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:35,660
joins it, a wonderful thing,

2403
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:37,660
skewering through the dark earth

2404
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:39,160

2405
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:41,160
bigger and more important than anything else.

2406
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:43,160
He believes at this point the plague is caused

2407
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:46,160
by the backwater people's unsanitary practices

2408
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:48,660

Every choice he made was understandable,

2470
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:10,660
and yet it was never enough to actually save

2471
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:12,160
most of the people of the town.

2472
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:14,160
Artemy is a polar opposite.

2473
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:16,160
He's more concerned with curing the sick

2474
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:17,660
than protecting the healthy.

2475
01:26:17,660 --> 01:26:20,160
He gets down in the dirt, the bowels of the earth,

2476
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,160
and makes tough sacrifices,

2477
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:24,160
even killing innocent people,

2478
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:25,660
but he does it compassionately

2479
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:27,660
to try to end the suffering for real,

2480
01:26:27,660 --> 01:26:30,160
and protecting the townspeople means protecting them

2481
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:33,160
from the high-minded idealism that led to the negligence

2482
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:35,660
that failed to prevent the plague early on

2483
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:37,160
and invented the structure

2484
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:39,160
that caused it all in the first place.

2485
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,660
A lot of this stuff is very ambiguous.

2486
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:42,160
There's a lot of ways of looking at it,

2487
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:43,660
but at least in my interpretation,

2488
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:46,160
the game seems very concerned with the tensions

2489
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,660
between the utopian dream of a better world

2490
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:51,160
and the actual people who have to build it

2491
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:53,660
and live through the follies that come with these projects.

2492
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:56,660
It's hard not to notice this Russian game's parallels

2493
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:58,160
with the history of the Soviet Union.

2494
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:00,660
As for the changeling, ah, I can't be bothered.

2495
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:02,660
I mean, come on, do I really need to do

2496
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:05,160
a third 20-hour playthrough and then explain all of that?

2497
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,160
I'm sure nothing that interesting happens in it.

2498
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,160
These endings don't just happen on their own, however.

2499
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:11,660
Left to its own devices, at the end of the 12th day,

2500
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:14,160
the army destroys everything and the bad ending happens.

2501
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:16,660
In order for your character to successfully get their ending,

2502
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:18,660
none of their bound can be sick.

2503
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:20,660
They have to prove that they're a good doctor,

2504
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:23,160
which means doing the main quest on time every day,

2505
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:26,160
and if you didn't, you have to cure the ones that got sick.

2506
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:28,660
You can do this by using the panaceas or schmowders

2507
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:30,160
you found over the course of the run,

2508
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:31,660

2509
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:33,660
or sell them for tons of cash,

2510
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:36,160
they're a kind of get-out-of-bad-ending-free card

2511
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:37,660
per person who got ill.

2512
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:39,660
If you prove you've done your duty as a doctor,

2513
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:42,160
you're let into the cathedral to argue your case,

2514
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,660
and when the day ends, you get your character's ending.

2515
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:47,160

They plead with you to help cure them

2527
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:09,660
so they can argue their case too,

2528
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:11,160
and if you cure all of them,

2529
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:12,660
you can invite them to the cathedral

2531
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:17,660

awaiting the time of my final decision,

2644
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:06,660
getting a last minute secret invitation

2645
01:32:06,660 --> 01:32:08,660
from the figures behind everything,

2646
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:10,660
even more behind everything than the gods

2647
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:12,660
who made the world,

2648
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:14,660
is so mysterious and satisfying and amazing.

2649
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:16,660
I can't tell you how cool that last trip

2650
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:18,660
from the Polyhedron to the theater was.

2651
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:20,660
In a town with no more dangers,

2652
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:22,660
no more threats, just me and the empty world,

2653
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:24,660
the walk to the theater

2654
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:26,660
is the most amazing journey of all.

2655
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:30,660
Are these the same guys from the tutorial?

2656
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:32,660
The ones no one but me could even see?

2657
01:32:41,660 --> 01:32:43,660
Oh, my God.

2658
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:45,660
These aren't the people behind the events.

2659
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:47,660
Well, they are, but they're more than that.

2660
01:32:47,660 --> 01:32:49,660
These are the developers of the game.

2661
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:51,160
Holy shit!

2662
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:54,160
The final secret is a chat with the developers.

2663
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:55,660
The first thing they do is point out

2664
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:57,160
the children aren't real either,

2665
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:58,660
and I mean they're right too.

2666
01:32:58,660 --> 01:33:00,160
None of this is real.

2667
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:01,660
Why would you be annoyed by the

2668
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:04,160
it's all a game played by children twist ending?

2669
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:05,660
It is all a game.

2670
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:07,660
You always knew that.

2671
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:09,660
You're literally playing a game.

2672
01:33:09,660 --> 01:33:11,660
The whole point is that games feel real

2673
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:13,160
even though they aren't.

2674
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:15,160
That's what suspension of disbelief is.

2675
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:17,160
You never really believe a game is real,

2676
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:19,660
but you briefly pretend you don't not believe

2677
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:21,160
to engage with it,

2678
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:23,160
and the game gave you a shitty twist

2679
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:25,660
just to make you wonder why that twist hurts

2680
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:28,160
when it's just telling you something you already knew.

2681
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:30,160
God, what a cool double twist.

2682
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:31,660
I love this so much.

2683
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:33,660
You even get to pick whether to talk

2684
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:35,660
as the character or as yourself.

2685
01:33:35,660 --> 01:33:37,160
God, this is cool.

2686
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:39,160
In reality, all games are a conversation

2687
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:41,160
between you and the developers.

2688
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:44,160
All Pathologic does is rip down the curtain at the end

2689
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:46,160
and show you that's what it was

2690
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:47,660
and tell you that's okay.

2691
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:49,660
It's fun to spend time in a world

2692
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:51,160
someone else made for you.

2693
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:53,660
It never had to be real to be real.

2694
01:33:53,660 --> 01:33:56,660
Oh, God, forgive me if my speech is unclear or absurd.

2695
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:58,160
I'm still reeling from this.

2696
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:00,660
Even writing the script after playing the game

2697
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:02,660
and even saying it now,

2698
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:04,660
I'm just, ah, I love this.

2699
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:06,160
I can't even communicate it,

2700
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:07,660
and that's what I've been trying to do

2701
01:34:08,660 --> 01:34:10,160
It's so good.

2702
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:12,160
Anyway, time to go pick my ending.

2703
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:13,660
You can say a final goodbye

2704
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:15,660
to a bunch of the main characters on the last day

2705
01:34:15,660 --> 01:34:17,160
and talk about what might happen next.

2706
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:19,160
Each of your bound has a thing to say to you.

2707
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:21,160
As the Haruspex, if you got to meet the creators,

2708
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:23,660
you can taunt the Inquisitor as the player

2709
01:34:23,660 --> 01:34:25,660
with the knowledge that she's all pretend,

2710
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:27,160
and as the Bachelor, hey, changeling,

2711
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:28,660
you've been weird and talking about

2712
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:31,160
how transcendent and special you are this whole time,

2713
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:33,160
but did you know this is all just a game

2714
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:34,660
played by children?

2715
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:36,160
Wait, what?

2716
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:37,660
She knows?

2717
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:39,160
She knows?

2718
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:40,660
How long has she known?

2719
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:43,160
What the fuck was happening in the changeling story?

2720
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:47,160
So, it's all about trickery to you?

2721
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:48,660
No.

2722
01:34:48,660 --> 01:34:50,160
No.

2723
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:52,160
I detest trickery,

2724
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:55,660
but if we ourselves are to suffer deception,

2725
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:57,660
our hands are no longer tied.

2726
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:04,660
Clara begins by waking up in a shallow grave.

2727
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:06,660
The executors tell you you're going to be mistaken

2728
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:09,660
for a murderer and a thief, but also a miracle worker,

2729
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:12,160
and your reputation is always going to drop.

2730
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:15,160
Clara is immediately adopted by Katerina Saburov,

2731
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:17,660
the semi-magical lady and wife of the governor.

2732
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:20,160
She sees her appearance as a sign of divine providence

2733
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:22,160
who will do great things for the town

2734
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:24,160
and believes you have magical healing powers.

2735
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,160
You also hear that someone with your description

2736
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:27,660
is thought of as a thief in the town,

2737
01:35:27,660 --> 01:35:29,160
and someone matching your appearance

2738
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:31,160
was said to have killed Simon or Isidore.

2739
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:33,660
Clara replies, yes, she is a good person,

2740
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:35,160
and the bad things she'd heard

2741
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:37,660
must have been her identical twin sister.

2742
01:35:37,660 --> 01:35:41,160
Huh. Is that an in-character fact about us?

2743
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:43,160
Or did our character just tell a lie?

2744
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:45,160
Well, it's both.

2745
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:46,660
How is that possible?

2746
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:47,660
Fuck you!

2747
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:49,160
The Saburovs task Clara

2748
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,660
with proving she has healing powers.

2749
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:52,660
You hear there's been some violence out in the steppe.

2750
01:35:52,660 --> 01:35:55,660
Some guys tried to stop a murderer escaping the town

2751
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:56,660
and got fucked up.

2752
01:35:56,660 --> 01:35:58,160
That sounds weirdly familiar.

2753
01:35:58,160 --> 01:35:59,660
And while you're there, you probably get into a fight

2754
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:01,660
with the looters, and here's where you find out

2755
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:03,660
that Clara's combat is hilariously terrible.

2756
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:05,160
I mean that literally.

2757
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:07,660
I was cackling when I discovered how shit this is.

2758
01:36:07,660 --> 01:36:09,660
Clara doesn't have a fist-fighting animation.

2759
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:11,160
Instead, she kind of waves her hands around

2760
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:12,660
all magic-like.

2761
01:36:12,660 --> 01:36:15,160
It's a very slow attack, and it does even less damage

2762
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:16,660
than the previous character's attacks.

2763
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:18,160
Oh, and she has tiny hands,

2764
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:20,160
so she can't use any weapons or guns

2765
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:22,160
except for one shitty gun that sucks.

2766
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:24,160
So good luck in fights, says Clara.

2767
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:28,160
45 hours and two earth-shattering revelations in,

2768
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:31,160
and the game's still finding ways to destroy me.

2769
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:32,660
This is the devs saying,

2770
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:34,660
okay, we know you've probably figured out

2771
01:36:34,660 --> 01:36:36,660
how to fight in this game now,

2772
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:38,660
so what if it was even harder?

2773
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:40,660
From any kind of typical design standpoint,

2774
01:36:40,660 --> 01:36:43,160
this combat is horrendous, but it works

2775
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:45,160
because at this point, you know the developers

2776
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:46,660
are just messing with you for fun.

2777
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:48,660
It's like when a close friend is rude to you

2778
01:36:48,660 --> 01:36:50,660
but in a cute way you both think is funny.

2779
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:52,160
That's the kind of friendship you have

2780
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:53,660
with the developers now.

2781
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:55,160
I mean, to even get here,

2782
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:56,660
you might have even met them already.

2783
01:36:56,660 --> 01:36:58,660
You then find the injured man you're supposed to save,

2784
01:36:58,660 --> 01:37:00,160
and you find out it's not a man.

2785
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:02,160
It's, hey, remember this guy?

2786
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:03,160
In this version of the story,

2787
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:05,160
the Haruspex tried to kill the kid,

2788
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:07,160
and the kid was injured but got away

2789
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:09,160
because, you know, he's not as good at stuff

2790
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:10,660
when you're not in control, that sort of thing.

2791
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:12,660
From the kid's perspective and Clara's,

2792
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:14,660
he's a monster who tried to kill a kid,

2793
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:17,160
but from being the Haruspex, you know what was on the line.

2794
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:18,160
It's cool storytelling.

2795
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:20,660
You see Artemy's side, but you also have to recognize

2796
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:22,660
that he's far from an innocent man here.

2797
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:24,160
Luckily, he doesn't have as much blood

2798
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:25,660
on his hands this time, it seems,

2799
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:27,660
especially since we're going to help the boy.

2800
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:29,660
Anyway, you lay on your hands to heal the kid

2801
01:37:29,660 --> 01:37:31,660
and complete the quest for, oh, he's dead.

2802
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:34,160
So Clara's powers, if she has them at all,

2803
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:36,160
don't seem to quite work how you expect,

2804
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:38,160
at least not for healing traditional wounds.

2805
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:40,160
The man who was supposed to serve as a witness

2806
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:42,660
to your healing hands, far from assuming you're a charlatan

2807
01:37:42,660 --> 01:37:44,160
or a demon or a murderer,

2808
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:46,160
actually still believes you're a hero though.

2809
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:48,660
He decides the kid had been judged by your power

2810
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:51,160
as a sinner and then killed instead of healed.

2811
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:54,160
He thinks your power is the divine working through you

2812
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:55,660
in mysterious ways.

2813
01:37:55,660 --> 01:37:58,660
Consider yourself purified.

2814
01:37:58,660 --> 01:38:00,660
You still have to prove you can heal people,

2815
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:03,660
but he's basically sold on you as a divine being.

2816
01:38:03,660 --> 01:38:06,660
I'm not sure how to feel about this version of the story.

2817
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:09,660
In a really good way, Haruspex made a very tough choice

2818
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:11,660
and had to live with it, but I think it might actually

2819
01:38:11,660 --> 01:38:13,660
be even more bleak to have a story

2820
01:38:13,660 --> 01:38:16,660
where a character tries to heal the child of their wounds,

2821
01:38:16,660 --> 01:38:18,660
accidentally kills them, and is heralded

2822
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:20,660
as a miraculous hero anyway.

2823
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:22,660
I love this stuff. It's horrible.

2824
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:24,160
It makes my skin crawl.

2825
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:26,160
With the harder fighting and the constantly

2826
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:28,660
lowering reputation you have to actively keep up

2827
01:38:28,660 --> 01:38:31,160
by doing good things, the game is pathologic

2828
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:33,160
at its most pathologicist.

2829
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:35,160
You have to do good things all the time.

2830
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:37,160
Give money away, give up on your medicine,

2831
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:39,660
kill baddies with your awful attacks, and so on.

2832
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:41,660
Bachelor has a hard spike on day two,

2833
01:38:41,660 --> 01:38:44,160
and Haruspex has two hard spikes at the beginning

2834
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:46,160
and partway through when he gets captured,

2835
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:48,160
but Clara is constantly swimming

2836
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:50,160
against a current of negative press.

2837
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:52,160
Someone who looks exactly like her

2838
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:54,160
has done a lot of bad things.

2839
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:56,160
You have a new set of Bound, of course,

2840
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:57,660
all the remaining main characters

2841
01:38:57,660 --> 01:38:59,660
who weren't in the first two's care.

2842
01:38:59,660 --> 01:39:01,660
As always, your job is to protect them

2843
01:39:01,660 --> 01:39:03,160
from getting infected or dying.

2844
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:05,160
Wait, the Foreman of the Abattoir?

2845
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:06,660
Oh, that's not gonna end well.

2846
01:39:06,660 --> 01:39:09,160
Clara's story has a lot of little extra things in it

2847
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:11,160
to learn about character relationships and choices.

2848
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:13,160
Lots of them are too small to go into depth about,

2849
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:15,160
but at times it was like a victory lap,

2850
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:18,160
the writers creating an extra post-playthrough story

2851
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:20,160
for a character with a magical ability

2852
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:22,660
that justifies them learning all kinds of new things.

2853
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:25,160
It's another way of exploring the richness of the story.

2854
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:27,160
You're still interacting with and causing the story

2855
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:28,660
to play out the way it does,

2856
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:30,160
but you have the strongest idea

2857
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:31,660
of why it all worked out now

2858
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:33,160
with two stories worth of hindsight.

2859
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:34,660
When you talk to the Foreman

2860
01:39:34,660 --> 01:39:36,160
who gave the Haruspex so much trouble

2861
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:38,160
and help him verify Artemy is a legitimate heir

2862
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:40,660
to his position, this conversation causes him

2863
01:39:40,660 --> 01:39:42,660
to devise the trials he tormented you with

2864
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:44,660
when you were playing the other story.

2865
01:39:44,660 --> 01:39:47,160
He comes up with them on purpose to get rid of Artemy.

2866
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:49,660
Thanks, Clara, which is how it felt like as the Haruspex,

2867
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:51,660
but getting that confirmation is really something.

2868
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:53,660
On top of that, the thing where the other player characters

2869
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:56,160
are worse at their jobs is cranked all the way up.

2870
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:57,660
After the first few days,

2871
01:39:57,660 --> 01:39:59,160
the Bachelor and Haruspex's relationship

2872
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:00,660
breaks down so bad,

2873
01:40:00,660 --> 01:40:02,660
they're actively trying to hunt each other down

2874
01:40:02,660 --> 01:40:04,160
for much of the story.

2875
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:05,660
You get letters from their allies asking you

2876
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:07,660
to find them and warn them the other is coming for them,

2877
01:40:07,660 --> 01:40:09,660
and you can even rat their locations out to each other

2878
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:11,160
for money and medicine.

2879
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:12,660
It's fun seeing how the worst possible

2880
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:14,160
of their timelines plays out

2881
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:15,660
when you aren't stopping either of them

2882
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:17,160
from being jerks.

2883
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:18,660
That said, it's clear that Clara

2884
01:40:18,660 --> 01:40:20,660
is the most rushed of the stories.

2885
01:40:20,660 --> 01:40:23,160
You can tell mainly because a lot of the side quests

2886
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:25,160
are the same side quest each day.

2887
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:26,660
For the second half of the game,

2888
01:40:26,660 --> 01:40:28,160
you have three side quests every day,

2889
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:29,660
and they're always the same.

2890
01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:31,160
Two of them are to warn the Bachelor and Haruspex

2891
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:33,160
about each other, and the third, well,

2892
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:34,660
Clara starts getting letters

2893
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:36,660
or possibly dream messages,

2894
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:39,160
but it's in the letters menu, from her twin sister,

2895
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:41,160
the evil Clara who is hiding out

2896
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:42,660
somewhere new in the town each day.

2897
01:40:42,660 --> 01:40:44,660
If you don't find her based on cryptic messages

2898
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:47,160
and get her to leave, which takes a lot of sleuthing

2899
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:48,660
and running around infected houses,

2900
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:50,160
the district she was hiding in

2901
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:52,660
will be permanently infected for the rest of the game.

2902
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:55,160
It's creepy talking to your own character too.

2903
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:56,660
Whenever you find her in a house,

2904
01:40:56,660 --> 01:40:58,160
she's always facing away from you,

2905
01:40:58,160 --> 01:40:59,660
and it's super weird.

2906
01:40:59,660 --> 01:41:01,160
Dodging the plague in houses

2907
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:04,160
to find a weird copy of yourself is great stuff.

2908
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:06,160
You then also have to scare away her followers

2909
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:07,660
who are hiding out in very hidden places

2910
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:09,660
you won't think to look, and if you don't,

2911
01:41:09,660 --> 01:41:11,160
that area gets infected too.

2912
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:12,660
So after the halfway point,

2913
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:15,160
every day these are your three side quests.

2914
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:17,160
They're always the same with the slight variation

2915
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:19,160
being the house that the Bachelor and Haruspex

2916
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:21,160
reach hiding in is a different place each day.

2917
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:23,160
You only get given vague ideas of where they are

2918
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:24,660
and you have to look around yourself,

2919
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:26,660
and Clara's letters are actually quite cool puzzles,

2920
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:29,160
I guess, to figure out where exactly she is in the town

2921
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:30,660
based on your intuition and knowledge of the town

2922
01:41:30,660 --> 01:41:32,160
from two full playthroughs.

2923
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:34,660
It's quite interesting, but having all three side quests

2924
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:36,160
be the same one each day

2925
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:38,660
with no real advancement of the plot really gets to me.

2926
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:41,660
The other characters had serious cool subplot stuff,

2927
01:41:41,660 --> 01:41:43,660
but Clara just gets busy work.

2928
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:45,660
I started to skip these quests after a few days.

2929
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:47,660
There's also very little communication

2930
01:41:47,660 --> 01:41:50,160
that you can heal infected people as Clara.

2931
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:51,660
Oh, did I mention that?

2932
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:53,160
I didn't mention it earlier on purpose

2933
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:54,660
because the game sure didn't.

2934
01:41:54,660 --> 01:41:56,160
When you use your hands on the infected,

2935
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:57,660
it plays a different animation

2936
01:41:57,660 --> 01:42:00,160
and you get reputation back and they do a little bow.

2937
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:01,660
It costs some health too, I guess.

2938
01:42:01,660 --> 01:42:04,160
So it's another thing you can do to keep your reputation up

2939
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:05,660
and it's also a cool trade-off

2940
01:42:05,660 --> 01:42:07,160
because you lose health for doing it as well

2941
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:08,660
and there's a risk of getting infected

2942
01:42:08,660 --> 01:42:10,160
while you're in those districts doing this,

2943
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:11,660
but I don't remember being tutorialized

2944
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:13,660
or told by the game you can do this.

2945
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:16,160
I only know about this from other videos mentioning it.

2946
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:18,660
I know Pathologic is a game that prides itself

2947
01:42:18,660 --> 01:42:21,160
on not conveying stuff and letting you figure things out,

2948
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:24,160
but from a design perspective, this feels like a misstep.

2949
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:26,160
I feel like if they'd had more time or resources,

2950
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:27,660
they'd have made this much clearer.

2951
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:29,160
I mean, they seem to give the implication

2952
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:31,160
Clara's attack is an attack.

2953
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:32,660
You use it to kill people

2954
01:42:32,660 --> 01:42:34,660
and it kills the first person you try to heal

2955
01:42:34,660 --> 01:42:36,660
and the first person you actually heal

2956
01:42:36,660 --> 01:42:38,160
happens in a cut scene.

2957
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:40,660
They do the opposite of letting you know you can do this

2958
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:42,660
and this only works on these characters too,

2959
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:44,660
not the people who appear to be in the early stages

2960
01:42:44,660 --> 01:42:46,660
of infection. They just drop dead.

2961
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:48,660
Like I said earlier, for the HD edition,

2962
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:50,660
all the character audio was re-recorded,

2963
01:42:50,660 --> 01:42:53,160
but in Clara's scenario, specifically for Katarina

2964
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:55,660
on around day three, for some reason,

2965
01:42:55,660 --> 01:42:58,160
one of the old voice actor's lines is still in there.

2966
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:00,660
Nothing threatens your daughter.

2967
01:43:00,660 --> 01:43:03,660
Everyone will die but you will remain.

2968
01:43:03,660 --> 01:43:06,160
I feel like this sort of oversight probably happened

2969
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:08,160
because development of Clara was rushed

2970
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:10,160
even for the HD version

2971
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:12,660
and an old line slipped through and didn't get caught,

2972
01:43:12,660 --> 01:43:15,160
which makes sense. A very small amount of players

2973
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:16,660
ever get to the point this could happen,

2974
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:18,160
and I'm glad they spent the time elsewhere

2975
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:20,160
instead of triple checking all the voice lines

2976
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:22,160
for every character for every character's story,

2977
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:23,660
but it's at least a good indicator

2978
01:43:23,660 --> 01:43:25,160
of how generally rushed

2979
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:26,660
some of the changeling's stuff is.

2980
01:43:26,660 --> 01:43:29,160
It's a minor thing but it points to the major thing

2981
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:31,160
or at the very least I noticed it and I want to pretend

2982
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:32,660
that I can make a point out of it.

2983
01:43:32,660 --> 01:43:34,660
Overall, if you were interested in Pathologic's story,

2984
01:43:34,660 --> 01:43:36,660
Clara's route is really satisfying.

2985
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:38,660
If you're not, it's just more text

2986
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:41,660
and combat even more frustrating than before

2987
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:44,160
and yet more walking, but it's much more rewarding

2988
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:46,160
in forthcoming with information than the others.

2989
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:47,660
You put the work in.

2990
01:43:47,660 --> 01:43:49,660
You played 20 to 40 hours of story.

2991
01:43:49,660 --> 01:43:52,160
Now lots of the missing pieces you were curious about

2992
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:53,160
can get filled in.

2993
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:55,160
The story isn't pulling its punches either.

2994
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:57,160
They know you've already played the game once.

2995
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:59,160
I love a lot of sequels to movies and games

2996
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:00,660
where they don't need to reestablish

2997
01:44:00,660 --> 01:44:02,160
or explain the simpler stuff.

2998
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:04,160
They can just go nuts with established material

2999
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:06,160
and ideas and this really hits that spot.

3000
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:08,160
It gets kind of meta toward the end too,

3001
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:10,160
so it's all about trickery to you?

3002
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:11,660
Wherever have you come from?

3003
01:44:11,660 --> 01:44:13,660
No, I detest trickery.

3004
01:44:13,660 --> 01:44:16,160
If we ourselves are to suffer deception,

3005
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:18,160
our hands are no longer tied.

3006
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:20,160
It's like Clara kind of knows what's happening

3007
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:21,660
without having to be told.

3008
01:44:21,660 --> 01:44:23,660
Some of her text options imply information

3009
01:44:23,660 --> 01:44:25,660
she never even learns herself,

3010
01:44:25,660 --> 01:44:27,660
but you know it from the other stories.

3011
01:44:27,660 --> 01:44:30,160
This is some Malkavian shit right here.

3012
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:32,160
God, I should really make that vampire video

3013
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:33,160
I teased years ago.

3014
01:44:33,160 --> 01:44:35,160
It's on the pile somewhere.

3015
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:37,160
Hey, you, what are you doing out of your cage?

3016
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:39,160
I'll get to you!

3017
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:41,160
It even starts to become clear what the story

3018
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:44,160
might really have been about all along.

3019
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:47,160
Like, what does the Polyhedron actually do?

3020
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:49,160
People say it can store dreams

3021
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:51,160
so people can revisit them and share them

3022
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:54,160
or trap a soul and keep a dead person alive,

3023
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:55,160
but what does that mean?

3024
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:57,160
Are souls literal things

3025
01:44:57,160 --> 01:44:59,660
or an ephemeral conceptual thing?

3026
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:01,660
The idea of someone,

3027
01:45:01,660 --> 01:45:03,660
the presence they can manifest

3028
01:45:03,660 --> 01:45:05,160
through the effects of actions

3029
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:06,660
from while they were alive?

3030
01:45:06,660 --> 01:45:10,160
Is a piece of my soul in this video?

3031
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:12,660
Perhaps even surviving after my death?

3032
01:45:12,660 --> 01:45:15,160
I put a lot of myself in my work.

3033
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:17,660
Am I immortal now?

3034
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:21,160
In a sense, maybe I am.

3035
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:24,160
I'm going to say the word now.

3036
01:45:24,160 --> 01:45:26,160
Now.

3037
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:28,660
When did I say that?

3038
01:45:28,660 --> 01:45:31,160
Looking at the clock, it's 416 a.m.

3039
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:34,160
on the 9th of November, 2019,

3040
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:37,160
but when did I really say it?

3041
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:40,660
I, now, will be 27

3042
01:45:40,660 --> 01:45:43,660
and talking about pathologic forever,

3043
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:46,660
even if you come back in another 27 years.

3044
01:45:46,660 --> 01:45:50,160
Maybe I'm immortal and freed from earthly flesh

3045
01:45:50,160 --> 01:45:52,660
by existing in the form of a video.

3046
01:45:52,660 --> 01:45:54,660
Maybe the opposite is true.

3047
01:45:54,660 --> 01:45:57,160
Maybe I'm trapped here forever

3048
01:45:57,160 --> 01:45:59,660
and maybe this is worse than being dead.

3049
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:00,660
Ahem.

3050
01:46:00,660 --> 01:46:02,660
Forgive me if my speech is unclear or absurd.

3051
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:04,660
You have a lot more in-depth conversations

3052
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:07,160
along these philosophical and spiritual lines,

3053
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:09,660
and to me now, the Polyhedron feels like a metaphor

3054
01:46:09,660 --> 01:46:11,160
for video games themselves.

3055
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:12,660
The rest of the town represents

3056
01:46:12,660 --> 01:46:15,160
the down-to-earth, day-to-day, boring reality

3057
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:17,160
of walking to places, talking to people,

3058
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:19,660
getting lied to, being a regular person,

3059
01:46:19,660 --> 01:46:21,660
eating food, getting sick sometimes,

3060
01:46:21,660 --> 01:46:24,160
and eventually dying, but in video games,

3061
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:26,160
in art, death isn't real.

3062
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:27,660
You can be whoever you like.

3063
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:29,660
Games are stories, but more than that,

3064
01:46:29,660 --> 01:46:31,660
a way for people to share their stories

3065
01:46:31,660 --> 01:46:33,660
with others forever, to take part in them

3066
01:46:33,660 --> 01:46:35,660
and live on past the boundaries

3067
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:37,660
of their simple material existence.

3068
01:46:37,660 --> 01:46:40,160
Everyone who made Pathologic will be dead one day,

3069
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:43,160
but they'll still be here in this world they made,

3070
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:45,660
staring out at you in eternal polygons,

3071
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:48,660
talking to you, sharing their ideas and feelings,

3072
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:52,160
a hand reaching from the grave to grasp you once more.

3073
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:55,660
Art is the road to awe, to permanent expression,

3074
01:46:55,660 --> 01:46:58,160
and games are a collaborative expression too.

3075
01:46:58,160 --> 01:47:01,160
You're playing it, interacting, being in it.

3076
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:02,660
This game is made for you.

3077
01:47:02,660 --> 01:47:04,160
Aren't you a part of it?

3078
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:05,660
This game is a reminder of the immense

3079
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:07,660
spiritual value of games,

3080
01:47:07,660 --> 01:47:10,160
to be somewhere else and move and act in it,

3081
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:13,160
to be a piece of someone else's vision for a moment.

3082
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:15,660
The Polyhedron represents the uplifting,

3083
01:47:15,660 --> 01:47:18,660
unrealistic, and yet truly real power

3084
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:21,160
imbued upon us by our ability to have dreams,

3085
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:23,160
literally and figuratively.

3086
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:24,660
That's just how it reads to me, though.

3087
01:47:24,660 --> 01:47:26,660
It certainly feels that way at times.

3088
01:47:26,660 --> 01:47:28,160
Speaking of the Polyhedron,

3089
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:30,160
when you visit there as Clara partway through,

3090
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:31,660
you get to descend to the bottom

3091
01:47:31,660 --> 01:47:33,160
and meet the gods of the world

3092
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:35,160
several days earlier than the other characters.

3093
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:38,160
They're genuinely shocked to see you this time.

3094
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:40,160
It's like Clara herself has more power

3095
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:42,160
than the creators thought she would,

3096
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:44,160
and here explains why Clara is the way she is,

3097
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:46,660
why there's such confusion about her nature,

3098
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:48,160
why there's two of her.

3099
01:47:48,160 --> 01:47:49,660
The powers that be are in disagreement

3100
01:47:49,660 --> 01:47:51,160
over who she is and what she's doing.

3101
01:47:51,160 --> 01:47:52,660
One of them thinks she's a thief,

3102
01:47:52,660 --> 01:47:54,160
and the other thinks that she is some kind

3103
01:47:54,160 --> 01:47:55,660
of divine being in their story.

3104
01:47:55,660 --> 01:47:57,160
I think this is actually really clever.

3105
01:47:57,160 --> 01:47:59,660
The powers that be are having competing interpretations

3106
01:47:59,660 --> 01:48:01,160
of this character they've made.

3107
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:03,160
Clara's quest eventually leads to the discovery

3108
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:04,660
of how her healing hands work.

3109
01:48:04,660 --> 01:48:06,660
They transform people's blood,

3110
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:09,160
give them something that can protect them from the disease,

3111
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:11,160
and if she uses it on stronger people,

3112
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:13,160
for example, her bound, if they're sacrificed

3113
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:14,660
and their blood is taken,

3114
01:48:14,660 --> 01:48:17,160
it can be used to make many cures for the plague,

3115
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:18,660
so she can get seven of her bound

3116
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:20,660
to agree to atone for their sins

3117
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:23,160
by being sacrificed to save the town.

3118
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:24,660
When you describe this to Foreman Oyun,

3119
01:48:24,660 --> 01:48:27,160
he sees it as a chance to undo the damage he's caused

3120
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:29,160
and agrees wholeheartedly.

3121
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:30,660
He tells you to tell the Haruspex

3122
01:48:30,660 --> 01:48:32,160
to not bother with the final trial,

3123
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:33,660
the one where he jumps into a hole and dies,

3124
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:35,160
since he no longer needs to kill him

3125
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:37,160
to protect his position in the kin.

3126
01:48:37,160 --> 01:48:38,660
You can straight up ask him what happens

3127
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:40,160
if he'd gone in the hole,

3128
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:41,660
and he tells you he would have died

3129
01:48:41,660 --> 01:48:44,160
because, yeah, it's a big hole.

3130
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:45,660
I left this out when I was talking about

3131
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:47,160
the Haruspex for dramatic effect,

3132
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:48,660
but I don't want to not mention it.

3133
01:48:48,660 --> 01:48:50,660
As the Haruspex, you do get Clara cryptically offering

3134
01:48:50,660 --> 01:48:52,660
to assist you, and if you agree,

3135
01:48:52,660 --> 01:48:55,160
when you go in the hole, you instead get this cool scene

3136
01:48:55,160 --> 01:48:58,160
where you can see your own corpse surrounded by executors

3137
01:48:58,160 --> 01:49:00,160
and you can choose someone from Clara's bound

3138
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:01,660
to die in your place.

3139
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:04,160
Artemy survives by doing this and then fights the Foreman,

3140
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:06,160
so it really was a spiritual experience,

3141
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:08,160
if you let the Changeling into your life at least.

3142
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:10,660
I guess this is because Clara in the Haruspex's story

3143
01:49:10,660 --> 01:49:12,160
doesn't get her shit together enough

3144
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:14,160
to realize she can use Oyun to solve

3145
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:16,160
the plague problem directly herself.

3146
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:18,160
Anyway, it's very funny to me that in Clara's run,

3147
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:19,660
the Haruspex is genuinely prepping

3148
01:49:19,660 --> 01:49:21,660
to jump into a hole and die.

3149
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:24,160
So Oyun and six others agree to make this sacrifice,

3150
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:25,660
and that's her ending.

3151
01:49:25,660 --> 01:49:27,160
The town and tower get preserved,

3152
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:29,160
but at the expense of people sometimes giving up

3153
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:30,660
their lives to maintain it.

3154
01:49:30,660 --> 01:49:32,160
I like this ending. It feels like the reminder

3155
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:34,160
that for society to survive intact

3156
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:37,160
requires work and sacrifice to protect itself

3157
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:39,660
from its own internal tensions and contradictions.

3158
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:40,660
That sort of thing.

3159
01:49:40,660 --> 01:49:43,160
Clara's map evolutions are suitably miraculous.

3160
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:45,660
Instead of either the town or the tower being monstrous,

3161
01:49:45,660 --> 01:49:49,160
the tower is a part of the town harboring some new thing,

3162
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:51,160
a dream, a life, the future,

3163
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:52,660
and the town is feeding it.

3164
01:49:52,660 --> 01:49:55,660
It's a symbiotic relationship which takes sacrifice

3165
01:49:55,660 --> 01:49:57,660
but which might be worth preserving,

3166
01:49:57,660 --> 01:50:00,660
and the sky is dreamlike reflecting either Clara's

3167
01:50:00,660 --> 01:50:03,160
more miraculous, fantastical perspective

3168
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:06,160
or her knowledge that the world really is a dream of sorts.

3169
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:08,160
Clara's first extra ending is nothing special.

3170
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:10,160
You've already met them once in this playthrough,

3171
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:12,160
so there's no real revelation here.

3172
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:13,660
Hey, guys, it's me again.

3173
01:50:13,660 --> 01:50:16,660
Third time round now. How's it going?

3174
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:21,160
Whoa, fuck.

3175
01:50:21,160 --> 01:50:22,660
Okay, that's cool.

3176
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:24,660
The game keeps being meta about all the things

3177
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:25,660
I think it won't address.

3178
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:27,160
Like, just when meeting the developers

3179
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:29,160
was starting to become a repetitive idea,

3180
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:31,660
here it is getting one-upped by the third go-round

3181
01:50:31,660 --> 01:50:33,660
making fun of how that's starting to feel,

3182
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:35,660
and here in the game, Clara kind of validates

3183
01:50:35,660 --> 01:50:37,660
my thoughts about the town and the polyhedron,

3184
01:50:37,660 --> 01:50:39,660
talking about these characters as if they're fragments

3185
01:50:39,660 --> 01:50:42,160
of real people, and in a way,

3186
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:44,160
I really do feel like I know these people now.

3187
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:46,660
I've spent a lot of time with them in their world

3188
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:48,160
experiencing their creation.

3189
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:49,660
You can even ask them more directly

3190
01:50:49,660 --> 01:50:51,160
what the other characters' stories

3191
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:52,660
were supposed to be about.

3192
01:50:52,660 --> 01:50:54,660
It's a fantastic send-off getting to discuss the story

3193
01:50:54,660 --> 01:50:56,660
with its creators.

3194
01:50:56,660 --> 01:50:59,660
Holy shit, that's so fucking cool.

3195
01:50:59,660 --> 01:51:02,660
I talked about this earlier. It is on purpose.

3196
01:51:02,660 --> 01:51:04,660
Oh, man, this is great. I love this.

3197
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:06,660
I utterly love this. This is the best thing ever,

3198
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:08,660
and it's so tiny, so small.

3199
01:51:08,660 --> 01:51:11,160
It's the devs showing you all the little tricks

3200
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:13,660
they used to make you frustrated and trapped

3201
01:51:13,660 --> 01:51:17,160
right there being complained about by you.

3202
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:19,160
Ah, God, it's excellent.

3203
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:21,160
You can ask what their plan was with the changeling,

3204
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:22,660
and they make a joke about how rushed

3205
01:51:22,660 --> 01:51:24,160
and slapped together it was.

3206
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:26,160
That's fun. I like that they're acknowledging things

3207
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:28,660
the player would definitely have noticed about this by now.

3208
01:51:28,660 --> 01:51:30,660
It feels personal and real.

3209
01:51:30,660 --> 01:51:32,160
They're not resting on their laurels

3210
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:34,160
and being pretentious about themes or ideas.

3211
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:36,660
They're apologizing for things they knew they got wrong

3212
01:51:36,660 --> 01:51:38,160
and even making a joke at the expense

3213
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:40,160
of this own indulgent last part.

3214
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:42,660
What a great ending. God, I've loved the story of this.

3215
01:51:42,660 --> 01:51:44,660
I wish I could have gone into more detail about it,

3216
01:51:44,660 --> 01:51:46,660
but just talking about the things that jumped out to me

3217
01:51:46,660 --> 01:51:48,160
the most has taken this long.

3218
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:49,660
It's been genuinely super awesome.

3219
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:52,160
Even though it's all fake, it's all just a kid's game,

3220
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:54,660
and on top of that, it's all just a video game,

3221
01:51:54,660 --> 01:51:56,660
I feel a sense of achievement for having stuck with it

3222
01:51:56,660 --> 01:51:58,660
in a strange way. Also, I quite like how hard

3223
01:51:58,660 --> 01:52:00,660
you have to work to achieve the actual good ending.

3224
01:52:00,660 --> 01:52:03,160
Like, the Bachelor's ending is just, like, fucked.

3225
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:05,660
He's such a shithead, and the Haruspex's ending

3226
01:52:05,660 --> 01:52:08,160
does kind of destroy a really awesome, cool invention.

3227
01:52:08,160 --> 01:52:10,660
It's only by actually playing through the whole game

3228
01:52:10,660 --> 01:52:13,160
at least twice that you get the chance

3229
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:15,660
to really get a decent ending for people.

3230
01:52:15,660 --> 01:52:17,660
Breathe it in.

3231
01:52:17,660 --> 01:52:19,160
Actually, no, don't breathe it in.

3232
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:20,660
You didn't have to play the whole game.

3233
01:52:20,660 --> 01:52:21,660
You just listened to me talk about it

3234
01:52:21,660 --> 01:52:23,660
for a couple hours. Fuck you.

3235
01:52:23,660 --> 01:52:25,660
There are fine things, old boy,

3236
01:52:25,660 --> 01:52:28,160
which are more brilliant when unfinished

3237
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:31,160
than when finished too much.

3238
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:34,160
So Pathologic does a lot of very clever things

3239
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:37,160
to make you feel a way games rarely even try

3240
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:38,660
to make people feel,

3241
01:52:38,660 --> 01:52:40,660
and I think it achieves its goals fairly well.

3242
01:52:40,660 --> 01:52:43,160
It's an experience I have a hard time recommending

3243
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:44,660
and which I know to be flawed,

3244
01:52:44,660 --> 01:52:47,160
but which I'm extremely glad I played in full.

3245
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:48,660
Pathologic is the antidote

3246
01:52:48,660 --> 01:52:51,160
to the entire modern game design ethos.

3247
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:53,160
It isn't a skinner box that rewards you

3248
01:52:53,160 --> 01:52:56,660
with simpler satisfactions like beautiful splatter graphics

3249
01:52:56,660 --> 01:52:58,660
when you get a headshot or a quest

3250
01:52:58,660 --> 01:53:00,660
that makes you feel heroic and powerful.

3251
01:53:00,660 --> 01:53:03,660
It makes you stare at the abyss of human cruelty

3252
01:53:03,660 --> 01:53:06,160
and ignorance and dares you to blink,

3253
01:53:06,160 --> 01:53:08,160
to close the game and give up.

3254
01:53:08,160 --> 01:53:10,160
I can't think of many other games that manage that.

3255
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:13,160
I super love this game and its world.

3256
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:15,660
Even though I don't think I'll ever want to touch it again

3257
01:53:16,660 --> 01:53:18,160
I'm glad I did it all,

3258
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:19,160
and I feel like I've learned a lot

3259
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:20,660
about the potential of games

3260
01:53:20,660 --> 01:53:23,160
and the many unique ways games can have

3261
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:24,660
all kinds of effects on you.

3262
01:53:24,660 --> 01:53:27,660
All that said, and I've said it so much in this video,

3263
01:53:27,660 --> 01:53:30,660
I'm not making this to recommend a 15-year-old game.

3264
01:53:30,660 --> 01:53:32,660
I'm making it because I couldn't recommend

3265
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:34,160
this 15-year-old game.

3266
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:36,660
I could barely even recommend it to myself.

3267
01:53:36,660 --> 01:53:38,660
It took years to get around to playing it

3268
01:53:38,660 --> 01:53:40,160
past the first couple hours.

3269
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:41,660
I had a really interesting time,

3270
01:53:41,660 --> 01:53:44,660
but 65 hours is a long time to spend

3271
01:53:44,660 --> 01:53:46,660
to eventually have an interesting time,

3272
01:53:46,660 --> 01:53:48,660
and I couldn't in good conscience

3273
01:53:48,660 --> 01:53:51,660
inflict that on someone else by telling them to try it.

3274
01:53:51,660 --> 01:53:54,660
Especially not now.

3275
01:53:54,660 --> 01:53:57,660
["Hidamare"]

3276
01:53:57,660 --> 01:54:01,660
["Hidamare"]

3277
01:54:01,660 --> 01:54:04,660
["Hidamare"]

3278
01:54:04,660 --> 01:54:07,660
So, yeah, love Pathologic.

3279
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:08,660
Amazing game.

3280
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:10,660
One of the best games ever.

3281
01:54:10,660 --> 01:54:12,660
Artistic masterpiece, but don't play it.

3282
01:54:12,660 --> 01:54:13,660
It sucks.

3283
01:54:13,660 --> 01:54:15,660
Luckily, there exists a game that does everything

3284
01:54:15,660 --> 01:54:18,160
Pathologic 1 does wrong right.

3285
01:54:18,160 --> 01:54:21,160
A game I can recommend so, so much more.

3286
01:54:21,160 --> 01:54:23,660
That game is Pathologic 2.

3287
01:54:23,660 --> 01:54:25,660
You don't have to play one to understand two,

3288
01:54:25,660 --> 01:54:27,660
especially not now that I've told you everything

3289
01:54:27,660 --> 01:54:28,660
you need to know about it.

3290
01:54:28,660 --> 01:54:30,660
When I sat down to play Pathologic 2,

3291
01:54:30,660 --> 01:54:33,660
I cynically assumed it would be a compromised version of one,

3292
01:54:33,660 --> 01:54:35,660
graphically and technically improved

3293
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:38,660
but lacking the sorts of bold design elements

3294
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:40,660
that contributed to making the original so unique.

3295
01:54:40,660 --> 01:54:43,660
Like, making a game like Pathologic more accessible

3296
01:54:43,660 --> 01:54:45,660
and understanding for a newer audience,

3297
01:54:45,660 --> 01:54:47,660
making it more engaging to play even,

3298
01:54:47,660 --> 01:54:49,660
would surely mitigate what it did best.

3299
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:52,660
I've never assumed so wrong.

3300
01:54:52,660 --> 01:54:55,160
It's even more horrifying, even harder,

3301
01:54:55,160 --> 01:54:58,160
and a massive step forward in every possible way.

3302
01:54:58,160 --> 01:54:59,160
Except the music.

3303
01:54:59,160 --> 01:55:00,660
The music in 1 is better in my opinion,

3304
01:55:00,660 --> 01:55:02,660
but the music is still incredible stuff.

3305
01:55:02,660 --> 01:55:05,660
Like, top 10 best music in games, no question.

3306
01:55:05,660 --> 01:55:07,660
The creators made good on maintaining

3307
01:55:07,660 --> 01:55:10,160
the atmosphere and feel while removing the bugs

3308
01:55:10,160 --> 01:55:11,660
and elements that were truly bad

3309
01:55:11,660 --> 01:55:13,160
and took away from the experience.

3310
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:14,660
They even threw in meta stuff

3311
01:55:14,660 --> 01:55:16,160
for people who played the first

3312
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:18,160
or even people who knew the twists from the first.

3313
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:20,160
I learned painstakingly the hard way

3314
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:22,160
and you just learned easily over one video.

3315
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:26,160
Perhaps, finally, after all these long years,

3316
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:28,160
the deep game is here.

3317
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:32,160
Well, almost here because Pathologic 2 isn't done yet.

3318
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:34,160
It's not in early access per se

3319
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:35,660
but not only is it still getting

3320
01:55:35,660 --> 01:55:37,660
what I'd say are critical bug fixes,

3321
01:55:37,660 --> 01:55:39,660
for example, an update while I was making this video

3322
01:55:39,660 --> 01:55:41,160
solved the performance problems

3323
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:42,660
I would have talked about right now,

3324
01:55:42,660 --> 01:55:44,160
so nice one there,

3325
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:46,160
but only one of the game's original stories

3326
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:48,160
is in this version, at least right now.

3327
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:49,660
The Haruspex.

3328
01:55:49,660 --> 01:55:51,660
It's still a full game because Pathologic

3329
01:55:51,660 --> 01:55:53,660
was three full games already basically,

3330
01:55:53,660 --> 01:55:56,160
but they're going to add more if they can afford to.

3331
01:55:56,160 --> 01:55:58,660
I'd buy the others as DLC or expansions, frankly.

3332
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:00,660
There was a demo, the Marble Nest,

3333
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:02,660
a few years ago where you play as the Bachelor for a day

3334
01:56:02,660 --> 01:56:04,660
and they just patched that into the main game

3335
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:06,660
as an improved version of itself

3336
01:56:06,660 --> 01:56:08,160
and that's awesome too,

3337
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:11,660
and yes, the Bachelor is even more of a shit.

3338
01:56:11,660 --> 01:56:13,160
I love him.

3339
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:16,160
Truth does not do as much good in the world

3340
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:18,160
as its counterfeits do evil.

3341
01:56:18,160 --> 01:56:19,660
God, what a great character.

3342
01:56:19,660 --> 01:56:21,160
I love him so much.

3343
01:56:21,160 --> 01:56:23,160
He's just, he's so well written

3344
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:24,660
as an insufferable fucker.

3345
01:56:24,660 --> 01:56:26,160
Oh, man, he's great.

3346
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:28,160
I swear to God I'm gonna cosplay as him

3347
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:29,160
first chance I get.

3348
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:31,660
Pathologic 2 isn't exactly a block puh...

3349
01:56:31,660 --> 01:56:32,660
there.

3350
01:56:32,660 --> 01:56:34,160
Sorry, I've spent hours and hours

3351
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:35,660
recording this voiceover.

3352
01:56:35,660 --> 01:56:37,660
The game isn't exactly a blockbuster,

3353
01:56:37,660 --> 01:56:38,660
smash hit.

3354
01:56:38,660 --> 01:56:40,160
It's a niche sequel

3355
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:42,160
to a barely known cult classic from Russia

3356
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:43,160
a decade ago,

3357
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:45,160
loved mostly by native Russian speakers

3358
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:47,160
and Western pretentious nerd critics.

3359
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:49,160
That's not a jab at pretentious nerd critics.

3360
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:50,160
I'm one of those.

3361
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:51,660
Did you hear that fucking bit

3362
01:56:51,660 --> 01:56:53,160
about this video having a soul?

3363
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:54,660
Come on, let's not pretend I'm any better,

3364
01:56:54,660 --> 01:56:56,160
but even if we love it,

3365
01:56:56,160 --> 01:56:58,160
we're not exactly a huge demographic.

3366
01:56:58,160 --> 01:57:00,660
I don't tend to do calls to action in my videos.

3367
01:57:00,660 --> 01:57:02,660
I like to let people make up their own minds

3368
01:57:02,660 --> 01:57:04,160
about what to do with their lives

3369
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:05,660
or whether a game is for them.

3370
01:57:05,660 --> 01:57:07,160
If you play Pathologic 1

3371
01:57:07,160 --> 01:57:10,160
after I deliberately didn't recommend it,

3372
01:57:10,160 --> 01:57:11,160
congratulations.

3373
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:12,660
You passed the true test

3374
01:57:12,660 --> 01:57:14,160
by deciding to play the game for yourself,

3375
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:15,660
and I love you for that.

3376
01:57:15,660 --> 01:57:17,160
Good luck with the fight with Bali,

3377
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:19,160
and on day one, you can find extra food

3378
01:57:19,160 --> 01:57:20,660
left out on Nina's grave.

3379
01:57:20,660 --> 01:57:22,160
Pretend I left that for you.

3380
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:23,660
Mwah. Keep the fact

3381
01:57:23,660 --> 01:57:25,660
I didn't recommend the first game

3382
01:57:25,660 --> 01:57:27,660
despite loving it in mind

3383
01:57:27,660 --> 01:57:30,160
when I say you should buy Pathologic 2.

3384
01:57:30,160 --> 01:57:31,660
It still might not be for you,

3385
01:57:31,660 --> 01:57:34,660
but you absolutely must try it to find out,

3386
01:57:34,660 --> 01:57:36,660
and in a world where mainstream games

3387
01:57:36,660 --> 01:57:38,660
are starting to feel like they're converging

3388
01:57:38,660 --> 01:57:41,160
upon the same Pavlovian uniform design

3389
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:43,160
with only minor branding variations,

3390
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:45,160
supporting independent work and true experiments

3391
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:47,160
with the form, even if they don't turn out

3392
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:48,660
to be something you personally like,

3393
01:57:48,660 --> 01:57:51,160
seems like THE step forward for video games.

3394
01:57:51,160 --> 01:57:53,160
The only other obvious step forward I can think of

3395
01:57:53,160 --> 01:57:55,160
is starting a game developers union.

3396
01:57:55,160 --> 01:57:57,660
Pathologic 1 is the best game you didn't play.

3397
01:57:57,660 --> 01:58:00,660
It's the best game I almost didn't play,

3398
01:58:00,660 --> 01:58:02,660
but Pathologic 2 is better,

3399
01:58:02,660 --> 01:58:04,660
and you are going to play it.

3400
01:58:04,660 --> 01:58:07,160
Go experience one of the most unique,

3401
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:10,660
satisfyingly hurtful experiences there is in gaming.

3402
01:58:10,660 --> 01:58:12,160
I'd analyze it in detail,

3403
01:58:12,160 --> 01:58:14,160
but that would require spoiling it,

3404
01:58:14,160 --> 01:58:16,160
and you are going to play this,

3405
01:58:16,160 --> 01:58:17,660
so I wouldn't do that to you.

3406
01:58:17,660 --> 01:58:19,160
Not for a while, at least.

3407
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:20,660
I need time to collect data

3408
01:58:20,660 --> 01:58:22,160
about other people's experiences

3409
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:24,660
and think about how it achieves the effects it does,

3410
01:58:24,660 --> 01:58:27,160
and I want to play it all the way through three more times.

3411
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:28,660
Okay, everybody break.

3412
01:58:28,660 --> 01:58:30,660
Go play Pathologic 2 and meet back here

3413
01:58:30,660 --> 01:58:32,660
in, I don't know, six months to compare notes

3414
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:34,660
for my analysis of the sequel.

3415
01:58:34,660 --> 01:58:36,160
Oh, and whatever you do,

3416
01:58:36,160 --> 01:58:38,160
don't take the traveler's deal!

3417
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:41,160
You weren't supposed to take the deal, Brendan!

3419
01:58:53,660 --> 01:58:56,160
Hey, thanks for watching all the way, friend.

3420
01:58:56,160 --> 01:58:58,660
My videos are supported by my backers over on Patreon,

3421
01:58:58,660 --> 01:59:00,160
and I love them for it.

3422
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:02,160
I used to do a thing where I read everyone out

3423
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:04,160
who backed a certain amount during the credits,

3424
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:06,160
but I have the best problem ever

3425
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:08,660
of there being too many people to do that,

3426
01:59:08,660 --> 01:59:10,160
so I'm reading them out one last time

3427
01:59:10,160 --> 01:59:11,660
before I change things over.

3428
01:59:11,660 --> 01:59:14,160
In the future, people who back me $10 or more per video

3429
01:59:14,160 --> 01:59:16,160
can vote on what my next video is.

3430
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:18,160
I'll have polls for what I feel like working on

3431
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:20,660
or based on ideas and suggestions you folks give me.

3432
01:59:20,660 --> 01:59:22,660
I always want to do, like, four different things at once,

3433
01:59:22,660 --> 01:59:25,160
so this will hopefully give me some more perspective.

3434
01:59:25,160 --> 01:59:26,660
I'm amazed that I've somehow been

3435
01:59:26,660 --> 01:59:28,160
as well-supported as I have,

3436
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:30,660
and I'm eternally thankful for being able

3437
01:59:30,660 --> 01:59:33,660
to do ridiculous things like get covered in soy,

3438
01:59:33,660 --> 01:59:35,160
build and destroy a set,

3439
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:37,160
or spend almost a month playing and reading

3440
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:40,160
and writing about an old Russian video game masterpiece.

3441
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:42,160
With your continued support, I hope to do

3442
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:43,660
even more ridiculous things.

3443
01:59:43,660 --> 01:59:45,160
So for the last time,

3444
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:46,660
at least for the foreseeable future,

3445
01:59:46,660 --> 01:59:48,160
if I ever finish any of the video games

3446
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:49,660
I'm trying to make, I'll hide a reading

3447
