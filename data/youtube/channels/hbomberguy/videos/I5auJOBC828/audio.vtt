00:00.000 --> 00:11.420
By now you probably know what a speedrun is already.

00:11.420 --> 00:14.340
It's where players commit to beating a game as fast as possible.

00:14.340 --> 00:16.340
On the surface, it's a bit silly.

00:16.340 --> 00:20.060
People sitting down with one game, playing it over and over,

00:20.060 --> 00:23.300
dedicating immense time and effort to learning its ins and outs

00:23.300 --> 00:27.260
and learning skills that probably aren't all that helpful anywhere else.

00:27.260 --> 00:31.040
And yet, somehow, the experience of taking part in

00:31.040 --> 00:33.800
or even watching someone try to speedrun a game

00:33.800 --> 00:37.300
is exhilarating and amazing and just fun,

00:37.300 --> 00:40.640
and speedruns of some games frequently get millions of views.

00:40.640 --> 00:43.060
This clearly matters to a lot of people,

00:43.060 --> 00:44.800
so there's probably a reason why,

00:44.800 --> 00:48.100
and I was having trouble scratching out the reasons why,

00:48.100 --> 00:52.400
so I arrived at the obvious solution of writing a YouTube video about it.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.240
Speedrunning is really fun to watch,

00:54.240 --> 00:56.940
and stories about speedrunning are consistently fascinating,

00:56.960 --> 00:59.420
and I really want to talk about why,

00:59.420 --> 01:01.800
and no one's managed to stop me so far.

01:01.800 --> 01:05.340
["Souls"]

01:05.340 --> 01:09.060
It's generally accepted that the Souls series is pretty difficult,

01:09.060 --> 01:10.940
and they are, at least for beginners,

01:10.940 --> 01:15.020
because the games are generally not great at teaching you how to really grasp playing them.

01:15.020 --> 01:16.940
I've heard there's already a video out there somewhere

01:16.940 --> 01:19.940
that drones on and on for way too long trying to explain this,

01:19.940 --> 01:21.020
so we'll ignore that here.

01:21.020 --> 01:24.240
This difficulty is the prime reason why speedruns of games in this series

01:24.240 --> 01:25.820
are so entertaining to watch.

01:25.840 --> 01:27.500
Owing to the games' inaccessibility

01:27.500 --> 01:30.800
and the time investment required to get good, as it were,

01:30.800 --> 01:33.680
watching someone blast through them is just plain fun.

01:33.680 --> 01:36.600
What's interesting in a more in-depth way about speedruns, though,

01:36.600 --> 01:38.680
is seeing how they develop over time,

01:38.680 --> 01:41.440
and Dark Souls is a perfect example of why.

01:41.440 --> 01:42.860
Part 1.

01:42.860 --> 01:44.600
Development.

01:44.600 --> 01:47.280
The earliest speedrun on record at speedruns.com,

01:47.280 --> 01:49.660
a fantastic resource, by the way, for Dark Souls,

01:49.660 --> 01:51.400
is by Japanese runner Twilight.

01:51.400 --> 01:54.900
In 2011, a lot less was known about how Dark Souls really ticked,

01:54.900 --> 01:56.740
and there was yet to be much of a community

01:56.740 --> 01:59.940
to help pick away at all the possible fastest approaches to the game,

01:59.940 --> 02:03.240
so Twilight's run consists largely of combining general tricks

02:03.240 --> 02:06.780
that were widely known early on for making the game easier or faster.

02:06.780 --> 02:10.060
For example, in Dark Souls, there are multiple different starting classes

02:10.060 --> 02:12.400
with their own stats, starting items, and abilities.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.560
While some do have unique advantages,

02:14.560 --> 02:17.900
the Pyromancer starts with the ability to throw fireballs,

02:17.900 --> 02:20.480
something none of the others can access for quite a while,

02:20.480 --> 02:23.100
so it's usually the one recommended to new players

02:23.100 --> 02:24.880
because if they're having trouble fighting,

02:24.880 --> 02:26.840
they can throw fire on people.

02:26.840 --> 02:29.300
I mean, come on. So Twilight picks them.

02:29.300 --> 02:31.800
It's not really a surprise. It's kind of the obvious choice

02:31.800 --> 02:33.640
if you were to think about how to speedrun this game

02:33.640 --> 02:35.020
if you played it a few times.

02:35.020 --> 02:37.020
The next big choice is the starting gift.

02:37.020 --> 02:39.260
Players can choose something extra to start the game with

02:39.260 --> 02:40.880
from a list at character creation.

02:40.880 --> 02:43.980
Normally in Dark Souls, early on to continue deeper into the game,

02:43.980 --> 02:46.220
players have to go through a fairly tough area,

02:46.220 --> 02:49.420
fight a difficult boss to get a key to another difficult area,

02:49.420 --> 02:51.420
then fight another boss there to progress through

02:51.460 --> 02:53.660
to another difficult area called Blighttown,

02:53.660 --> 02:55.080
which leads down to another boss,

02:55.080 --> 02:56.580
which is guarding a bell you need to ring

02:56.580 --> 02:57.780
to progress the game,

02:57.780 --> 03:00.280
but for, uh, reasons,

03:00.280 --> 03:02.500
the developers made one of the starting items

03:02.500 --> 03:04.200
players can choose from a key

03:04.200 --> 03:06.240
that unlocks a gate in the starting area,

03:06.240 --> 03:08.160
which skips past two of those bosses

03:08.160 --> 03:10.620
right into the lower part of Blighttown,

03:10.620 --> 03:12.880
so it's pretty clear what item a speedrunner

03:12.880 --> 03:14.280
would want to start with here.

03:14.280 --> 03:16.880
It's just the most obviously fast and helpful choice.

03:16.880 --> 03:18.200
I mean, look at the other ones.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.380
Binoculars, a rubbish ring,

03:20.380 --> 03:22.740
a n-n-a more rubbish ring,

03:22.740 --> 03:25.280
pendant, trinket, no effect,

03:25.280 --> 03:26.780
black firebombs?

03:26.780 --> 03:28.780
What a garbage option.

03:28.780 --> 03:30.700
Why would anyone ever pick that?

03:30.700 --> 03:32.120
I don't know. I guess they're pretty good.

03:32.120 --> 03:35.500
I mean, they're more deadly than STD bomb.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.920
What? Another initially obvious trick for speedrunning

03:37.920 --> 03:39.960
involves this drake that turns up early on

03:39.960 --> 03:41.120
and hangs out up here.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.540
Getting a decent weapon in this game

03:42.540 --> 03:43.780
usually takes some time,

03:43.780 --> 03:45.740
but once you get to this big scary boy,

03:45.740 --> 03:48.160
one recommended way for new players to get an advantage

03:48.160 --> 03:50.740
so they don't have too hard a time starting out

03:50.740 --> 03:53.240
is to sit in a safe place and spam arrows at its tail

03:53.240 --> 03:55.480
until it breaks off, giving you this sword.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.940
The drake sword deals a ridiculous amount of damage

03:57.940 --> 03:59.820
for the place in the game where you can get it.

03:59.820 --> 04:02.200
It drops off in its usefulness quite quickly,

04:02.200 --> 04:03.240
but for early players,

04:03.240 --> 04:05.120
it's just a fantastic weapon to pick up,

04:05.120 --> 04:06.860
but instead of wasting time and arrows,

04:06.860 --> 04:08.280
of which they had neither,

04:08.280 --> 04:10.360
Twilight simply dodged behind it

04:10.360 --> 04:12.440
when it jumped down and cut its tail off

04:12.440 --> 04:13.980
and then ran to the next area.

04:13.980 --> 04:16.160
This is one of the most cathartic things

04:16.160 --> 04:17.520
you can see in a speedrun.

04:17.600 --> 04:20.060
You know, you spend a bunch of time dying to its fire

04:20.060 --> 04:21.220
or getting kicked to death,

04:21.220 --> 04:24.020
and then you see someone else just steal its tail

04:24.020 --> 04:25.380
and run away with it

04:25.380 --> 04:27.380
and proceed to beat people to death with it

04:27.380 --> 04:28.680
for the rest of the game.

04:28.680 --> 04:29.520
It's great.

04:29.520 --> 04:30.680
A lot of Twilight's early run

04:30.680 --> 04:33.100
consists of playing the game the way one normally would,

04:33.100 --> 04:35.840
but just doing more running and ignoring enemies.

04:35.840 --> 04:39.060
Early runs like this play the game basically as normal,

04:39.060 --> 04:40.720
but very quickly and precisely

04:40.720 --> 04:43.480
doing the most obviously easy and fast moves.

04:43.480 --> 04:45.300
Twilight burns all the remaining bosses

04:45.300 --> 04:46.600
with their hot, hot hands

04:46.600 --> 04:47.800
and grabs enough humanity

04:47.800 --> 04:49.800
that they can feed it to the Daughter of Chaos

04:49.800 --> 04:52.800
and open a shortcut past all the major fire-based bosses,

04:52.800 --> 04:55.060
which obviously would take a long time to fight

04:55.060 --> 04:56.880
when all your weapons are fire.

04:56.880 --> 05:00.560
Have you ever tried actually fighting fire with fire?

05:00.560 --> 05:01.840
I'm on a watch list now.

05:01.840 --> 05:04.500
After a lot of running past things and killing bosses,

05:04.500 --> 05:05.960
they gather the four Lord Souls

05:05.960 --> 05:07.420
required to open the big door

05:07.420 --> 05:09.140
to the remnants of Great Uncle Gwynn's

05:09.140 --> 05:11.000
mega weekend barbecue and kill him

05:11.000 --> 05:13.460
so someone can finally call the fire department,

05:13.460 --> 05:17.280
and they do it in an hour and 26 minutes in in-game time.

05:17.280 --> 05:21.160
This is an ungodly fast speed to finish Dark Souls,

05:21.160 --> 05:23.500
but there was a lot of improvement to make.

05:23.500 --> 05:25.340
What I think is interesting about the early runs

05:25.340 --> 05:27.540
through the game is that they weren't just improving

05:27.540 --> 05:29.500
on execution of the same route

05:29.500 --> 05:31.660
or finding slightly more improved paths,

05:31.660 --> 05:34.500
but the nature of the entire route from the very start

05:34.500 --> 05:35.920
was still up for debate.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.280
Nothing was set in stone,

05:37.280 --> 05:40.160
even what type of character you chose to play as,

05:40.160 --> 05:42.620
and it wasn't clear what the fastest way would really be,

05:42.660 --> 05:44.740
and that's a really fun experimental period

05:44.740 --> 05:46.240
in the development of a speed run.

05:46.240 --> 05:48.200
This is where Dark Souls runs excel

05:48.200 --> 05:49.820
in the spectatorship aspect.

05:49.820 --> 05:52.400
In lots of other games, you don't have as much choice

05:52.400 --> 05:55.280
or freedom in where to go or what sort of character to play

05:55.280 --> 05:56.700
or what weapon to use.

05:56.700 --> 05:59.120
There are so many other paths or decisions

05:59.120 --> 06:00.940
that could have been made in a Souls game

06:00.940 --> 06:04.020
that the next run threatens to be completely different,

06:04.020 --> 06:05.660
and, well, it was.

06:05.660 --> 06:07.940
The next world record was set three months later

06:07.940 --> 06:10.620
and has gone on to be the longest standing world record,

06:10.660 --> 06:12.660
lasting 13 months.

06:12.660 --> 06:15.240
It was set by another Japanese runner, Keita.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.480
I hope I'm pronouncing that properly.

06:16.480 --> 06:19.740
Ke, and then it's a neon gate, so Keita.

06:19.740 --> 06:20.620
KEITA.

06:20.620 --> 06:22.280
All right, what's really fun about this run

06:22.280 --> 06:25.120
was it diverged from Twilight's path immediately.

06:25.120 --> 06:27.540
Not only do they start the game with a different class

06:27.540 --> 06:28.660
right out of the gate,

06:28.660 --> 06:30.400
but once they make it to Firelink Shrine

06:30.400 --> 06:32.580
and you assume their run is gonna be similar looking

06:32.580 --> 06:33.740
but with slight improvements,

06:33.740 --> 06:37.280
they get up and immediately head in the opposite direction.

06:37.280 --> 06:38.040
KEITA.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.580
Goes to parts of the game Twilight never even sees

06:40.580 --> 06:41.420
in their run.

06:41.420 --> 06:43.000
Firstly, they go to the Valley of Drakes,

06:43.000 --> 06:44.280
dodge between the drakes,

06:44.280 --> 06:45.820
and grab the Red Tearstone Ring,

06:45.820 --> 06:47.420
which boosts the player's damage output

06:47.420 --> 06:50.580
by roughly 66% when they're below 20% health.

06:50.580 --> 06:51.960
By playing more riskily,

06:51.960 --> 06:54.240
KEITA becomes much more dangerous.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.540
This is the kind of improvement I love seeing in speedruns,

06:56.540 --> 06:58.660
learning to abuse a risk-reward mechanic

06:58.660 --> 07:01.620
to just get the rewards by simply playing really well.

07:01.620 --> 07:03.540
In a speedrun, a risk-reward item

07:03.540 --> 07:06.660
can very frequently become a reward.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.240
Then they run into Darkroot Basin

07:08.240 --> 07:09.860
and encounter the Black Knight there.

07:09.860 --> 07:12.180
Now, Black Knights are tough enemies in the early game.

07:12.180 --> 07:13.320
They don't take much damage

07:13.320 --> 07:15.320
even when you riposte or backstab them.

07:15.320 --> 07:16.780
You can see this is gonna take quite a-

07:16.780 --> 07:18.100
Oh, he's pushed him off the cliff.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.400
Is rewarded with the Black Knight Halberd.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.240
You only get this weapon for killing the knight

07:22.240 --> 07:24.060
like 20% of the time,

07:24.060 --> 07:26.140
and these knights don't respawn.

07:26.140 --> 07:28.780
This halberd forms the basis of KEITA's strategy,

07:28.780 --> 07:30.560
so if they don't get the halberd here,

07:30.560 --> 07:32.480
they would have to start the run again.

07:32.480 --> 07:34.640
There are definitely countless runs

07:34.640 --> 07:37.240
on the cutting room floor that ended here just because.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.240
You can slightly increase the chance of it dropping

07:39.240 --> 07:41.160
if you have more humanity on you,

07:41.160 --> 07:43.020
but it's still like a crapshoot.

07:43.020 --> 07:44.900
Now, there's a reason the last thing you fight

07:44.900 --> 07:47.940
before the final boss is a Black Knight with a halberd.

07:47.940 --> 07:49.480
Gwyn knew what was up.

07:49.480 --> 07:52.900
This weapon absolutely mashes most enemies and bosses.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.320
Then they just keep going and run all the way around

07:55.320 --> 07:57.740
to the Darkroot Basin entrance to the Undead Parish,

07:57.740 --> 07:59.700
skipping several areas completely.

07:59.700 --> 08:02.280
After beating the gargoyles with a regular old axe,

08:02.280 --> 08:03.520
they use the souls they've gained

08:03.520 --> 08:05.820
to level up enough to equip the halberd,

08:05.820 --> 08:08.820
which they can now just about wield if they two-hand it.

08:08.860 --> 08:10.860
Cairta had precisely figured out

08:10.860 --> 08:13.140
the most efficient way to get the souls they needed

08:13.140 --> 08:15.180
to use this weapon as early as possible.

08:15.180 --> 08:17.360
This means they're able to utterly destroy

08:17.360 --> 08:20.180
the fire bosses that Twilight had to skip completely

08:20.180 --> 08:21.440
because of their weapons.

08:21.440 --> 08:24.820
It's literally faster for Cairta to run through all this

08:24.820 --> 08:26.640
and kill all these bosses

08:26.640 --> 08:28.520
than it is to gather the materials

08:28.520 --> 08:30.280
required to just skip them.

08:30.280 --> 08:33.680
Overall, Cairta saved 15 entire minutes over Twilight

08:33.680 --> 08:35.900
while killing more bosses.

08:35.900 --> 08:38.060
Most of the current record holders in Dark Souls

08:38.060 --> 08:39.880
use this basic strategy now,

08:39.880 --> 08:41.340
but they've saved even more time

08:41.340 --> 08:43.380
by discovering new holes in the game to exploit,

08:43.380 --> 08:45.180
like by messing with the camera system

08:45.180 --> 08:47.520
enough to go out of bounds and enter Sen's Fortress early.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.180
They've improved the strategy so much

08:49.180 --> 08:51.720
that they don't even use the Master Key anymore.

Instead, they use black fire bombs to...

Black fire bombs?

09:07.800 --> 09:11.140
I just shouldn't be allowed to talk about Dark Souls anymore.

Someone should just fucking come and stop me

09:13.020 --> 09:16.440
before I make him another fucking idiot of myself.

The creation and development of new runs through games

09:35.340 --> 09:37.340
is really, really fun to watch,

09:37.340 --> 09:39.960
but in a way that's hard to describe.

09:39.960 --> 09:43.540
It's a kind of logistical fun.

09:43.540 --> 09:44.800
Is that a kind of fun?

09:44.800 --> 09:47.380
That doesn't sound like a kind of fun.

09:47.380 --> 09:51.180
It reminds me of the feeling I got when I had my GPS out,

09:51.180 --> 09:53.380
and it told me to take a route through a park

09:53.380 --> 09:54.680
that I knew really well, and I was like,

09:54.680 --> 09:56.600
nah, I can go through that faster,

09:56.600 --> 10:00.020
and I walked a different route, and I got through it faster.

10:00.020 --> 10:01.260
It just felt amazing.

10:01.260 --> 10:03.760
It's a bit like the feeling I got

No one I showed this script suggested better titles,

10:30.600 --> 10:32.560
so I'm just gonna have to go with these ones.

10:32.560 --> 10:35.140
Now, I have to admit, I've so far deliberately

10:35.140 --> 10:37.560
not mentioned something about the Dark Souls run.

10:37.560 --> 10:39.680
The progression I described is actually only one

10:39.680 --> 10:42.520
of several different categories of run through the game,

10:42.520 --> 10:45.020
one known as any% no wrong warp.

10:45.020 --> 10:47.060
Like I said before, most of the normal run

10:47.060 --> 10:49.060
is spent killing all the major bosses

10:49.060 --> 10:51.560
to get the Lord Souls to unlock the big door,

10:51.560 --> 10:53.520
which is why it was kind of a big deal

10:53.520 --> 10:56.480
when players figured out a way to teleport right here

10:56.480 --> 10:59.760
on the other side of the door without having to open it.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.600
The game's DLC added an arena

11:01.600 --> 11:03.480
where players could fight each other online.

11:03.480 --> 11:05.300
Swang into tomorrow!

11:05.300 --> 11:06.600
After beating Artorias,

11:06.600 --> 11:08.480
who incidentally was my favorite boss fight

11:08.480 --> 11:10.940
in the series until Bloodborne's DLC came out,

11:10.940 --> 11:14.640
you gain access to the Battle of Stoicism gazebo,

11:14.640 --> 11:17.020
which presumably sounds better in Japanese.

11:17.020 --> 11:20.020
When they join the arena through the gazebo,

11:20.020 --> 11:22.100
players receive a purple coward's crystal,

11:22.100 --> 11:23.400
which they can use to quit a fight

11:23.400 --> 11:25.020
and teleport back to the entrance.

11:25.020 --> 11:27.180
It does this by telling the game to move you

11:27.180 --> 11:29.140
to a certain map and position,

11:29.140 --> 11:31.360
the map being the main DLC area,

11:31.360 --> 11:33.700
and the position being the entrance to the arena.

11:33.700 --> 11:35.120
Now, there are other items in the game

11:35.120 --> 11:36.200
which work similarly,

11:36.200 --> 11:38.440
like the Homeward Bonio or the Dark Sign.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.160
They tell the game to take you to the map

11:40.160 --> 11:41.980
where you last rested at a bonfire

11:41.980 --> 11:43.860
and the position of that bonfire.

11:43.860 --> 11:46.200
So let's say you last rested at the bonfire

11:46.200 --> 11:47.400
in front of the big door.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.160
Barring specific circumstances,

11:49.160 --> 11:51.520
using one of these two items will take you back here.

11:51.520 --> 11:54.400
Now, you can't normally use the purple coward's crystal

11:54.400 --> 11:56.360
outside of the arena. It's grayed out.

11:56.360 --> 11:57.900
Trying to use it makes your character

11:57.900 --> 12:00.060
have a panic attack and think about all the times

12:00.060 --> 12:02.020
they said, you too, when a waiter told them

12:02.020 --> 12:03.940
to enjoy their food, but there's a glitch

12:03.940 --> 12:05.560
that allows players to use items

12:05.560 --> 12:07.060
even when they're not intended to

12:07.060 --> 12:08.720
by trying to use it,

12:08.720 --> 12:10.260
switching to an item they can use,

12:10.260 --> 12:11.260
like the Estus flask,

12:11.260 --> 12:13.360
while holding down the Use button still,

12:13.360 --> 12:15.680
running off an edge while toggling weapons,

12:15.680 --> 12:18.560
and pressing the Use button again on an exact frame,

12:18.560 --> 12:21.860
causing the player to drink the item along with the flask,

12:21.860 --> 12:25.180
which uses it even if you're not supposed to be able to.

12:25.180 --> 12:26.440
What a handy item.

12:26.440 --> 12:29.060
You can visit the gazebo whenever you like.

12:29.060 --> 12:30.220
But here's the thing.

12:30.220 --> 12:31.760
Using the crystal in the main game

12:31.760 --> 12:34.480
has a fancy long animation where you can't do anything

12:34.480 --> 12:36.360
as the game fades to a loading screen,

12:36.360 --> 12:37.860
but when you use it this way,

12:37.860 --> 12:41.060
you can still walk around and use items before it fades,

12:41.060 --> 12:44.360
so what if we used another item that teleports us

12:44.360 --> 12:46.820
while this other effect was going off?

12:46.820 --> 12:48.940
Well, to put it simply,

12:48.940 --> 12:51.260
the game gets confused.

12:51.260 --> 12:54.400
It tries to load you to the map of the last used bonfire,

12:54.400 --> 12:56.900
which in our case is the bonfire before the big door,

12:56.900 --> 12:59.120
which we cleverly napped at before coming here,

12:59.120 --> 13:01.740
but the position of the arena entrance.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.740
The arena entrance the game is looking for

13:03.740 --> 13:05.580
doesn't exist in this map, though,

13:05.580 --> 13:07.900
so instead it takes you to the pre-programmed

13:07.900 --> 13:09.700
default position in the level,

13:09.700 --> 13:12.660
and it turns out that the default position for this area

13:12.660 --> 13:15.040
is inside the Kiln of the First Flame,

13:15.040 --> 13:18.820
so now all players need to do to beat the game

13:18.820 --> 13:22.580
is gain access to this bonfire and the DLC battle arenas,

13:22.580 --> 13:25.620
and then they can warp directly to the last area.

13:25.620 --> 13:26.880
Oh, and also they have to perform

13:26.880 --> 13:28.760
an absurdly precise set of inputs

13:28.760 --> 13:30.960
with barely even a frame of lenience.

13:30.960 --> 13:33.620
Seriously, it's really hard getting this footage alone.

13:33.620 --> 13:35.260
Took me, like, 25 minutes,

13:35.260 --> 13:37.180
but if you can execute this consistently,

13:37.180 --> 13:39.540
which speedrunners are really good at learning to do,

13:39.540 --> 13:41.800
this method saves a lot of time.

13:41.800 --> 13:44.080
However, it was decided by the community

13:44.080 --> 13:46.420
to be so different from the other runs,

13:46.420 --> 13:48.120
since you have to both own the DLC

13:48.120 --> 13:49.920
and abuse a pretty major glitch,

13:49.920 --> 13:52.620
that all runs prior to the discovery of this glitch

13:52.620 --> 13:54.760
and after the discovery but which don't use it

13:54.760 --> 13:57.060
should be split off into their own separate category.

13:57.060 --> 13:59.260
At this point, the Dark Souls speedrun community

13:59.260 --> 14:02.060
has split the game into at least 14 different categories

14:02.060 --> 14:03.900
ranging from extra difficult challenges

14:03.900 --> 14:05.300
such as killing all the bosses

14:05.300 --> 14:07.760
or completing the entire game without leveling up

14:07.760 --> 14:10.140
to absurdist challenges like completing the game

14:10.140 --> 14:12.800
after collecting one of every ring item in the game.

14:12.800 --> 14:14.760
The Lord of the Rings run.

14:14.760 --> 14:15.760
That's a clever name.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.400
This kind of separation of a run

14:17.400 --> 14:20.180
into distinct categories also happened in Bloodborne.

14:20.180 --> 14:21.640
When the game was initially released,

14:21.640 --> 14:23.100
a glitch in some of the architecture

14:23.100 --> 14:24.180
for the game was discovered,

14:24.180 --> 14:26.020
resulting in the player being able to leap off

14:26.020 --> 14:27.600
at an angle from a coffin

14:27.600 --> 14:29.480
and get onto a raised section of wall,

14:29.480 --> 14:31.480
then do an attack at another part of a wall

14:31.480 --> 14:32.480
to clip through,

14:32.480 --> 14:34.320
skipping a whole bunch of the game.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.060
For example, the fight with Ghasgwagni

14:36.060 --> 14:37.680
and leading to the creation of a route

14:37.680 --> 14:39.400
which, supplemented by other tricks,

14:39.400 --> 14:41.900
would eventually only take about 20 minutes,

14:41.900 --> 14:43.480
which is utterly absurd.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.780
However, Bloodborne was pretty heavily patched

14:45.780 --> 14:48.180
after release, making lots of changes and fixes

14:48.180 --> 14:50.400
including that error in the architecture

14:50.400 --> 14:52.900
and also, incidentally, much better load times.

14:52.940 --> 14:54.660
This makes this run impossible to do

14:54.660 --> 14:56.700
on a properly patched version of the game.

14:56.700 --> 14:58.320
It also means the version of the game

14:58.320 --> 15:00.780
you would play today on an online PS4

15:00.780 --> 15:03.320
would be unable to do the fastest speedruns,

15:03.320 --> 15:05.660
which puts you at a pretty major disadvantage.

15:05.660 --> 15:08.400
The solution was for new categories to be created,

15:08.400 --> 15:10.320
so runners could run the original version

15:10.320 --> 15:11.540
of the game if they wanted,

15:11.540 --> 15:14.160
but runners could also compete using the current patch.

15:14.160 --> 15:16.280
The current fastest patched run of the game

15:16.280 --> 15:17.700
is slower by eight minutes,

15:17.700 --> 15:20.160
although, incidentally, because of the massive fixes

15:20.160 --> 15:22.500
to load times, despite the in-game timer

15:22.560 --> 15:24.560
telling you it's almost eight minutes slower,

15:24.560 --> 15:27.680
it's a minute faster to watch in real time.

15:27.680 --> 15:30.020
Bloodborne was messed up when it came out, wasn't it?

15:30.020 --> 15:31.560
Bloodborne's a really interesting game

15:31.560 --> 15:33.640
to run as well in general for a lot of reasons,

15:33.640 --> 15:35.400
one of them being the beast blood pellet,

15:35.400 --> 15:37.120
which adds a meter filled by dealing

15:37.120 --> 15:39.160
certain types of damage, and the higher the meter,

15:39.160 --> 15:41.860
the more damage the player both deals and receives.

15:41.860 --> 15:44.000
It's a bit risk-reward in normal play,

15:44.000 --> 15:45.620
but it's a godsend for speedrunners,

15:45.620 --> 15:47.660
and in some ways, it makes the game easier

15:47.660 --> 15:51.040
for speedrunners by specifically rewarding fast play.

15:51.040 --> 15:53.420
The diverging any% categories in these games

15:53.420 --> 15:56.120
raises interesting questions about the hobby.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.620
In games with multiple categories,

15:58.620 --> 16:01.000
which one is the real speedrun?

16:01.000 --> 16:04.060
Why are some glitches and tricks permitted and others not?

16:04.060 --> 16:07.140
Shouldn't the goal be to create the fastest singular run

16:07.140 --> 16:09.480
and agree on one standard set of rules

16:09.480 --> 16:11.560
for what the speedrun should be?

16:11.560 --> 16:14.280
And how does one decide when something is allowed

16:14.280 --> 16:17.280
and when something should be a separate category or banned?

16:17.320 --> 16:21.060
Well, it depends on both the game and its community.

16:21.060 --> 16:22.860
A game that's impacted by these questions

16:22.860 --> 16:24.900
in a big way is Mirror's Edge.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.480
Mirror's Edge is a game very close to my heart,

16:29.480 --> 16:31.540
to the point that I've speedrun it before as well.

16:31.540 --> 16:34.280
If I'd bothered to submit the run to speedruns.com,

16:34.280 --> 16:39.340
I'd officially be in 201st place.

16:39.340 --> 16:41.260
The thing about Mirror's Edge is it's a game

16:41.260 --> 16:42.840
about moving very quickly.

16:42.840 --> 16:44.460
The player character is very mobile,

16:44.460 --> 16:46.640
has a diverse set of moves across surfaces,

16:46.660 --> 16:48.460
and for picking up speed, and different ways

16:48.460 --> 16:50.740
of jumping onto, off of, and across things.

16:50.740 --> 16:52.840
There are also a lot of little ways the mechanics

16:52.840 --> 16:55.080
can be manipulated to go even faster.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.840
This makes it an ideal speed game.

16:56.840 --> 16:59.380
This runner just executed a trick so quickly

16:59.380 --> 17:01.420
at the beginning that you probably didn't even see it.

17:01.420 --> 17:04.000
Right as they loaded in, they turned to the side

17:04.000 --> 17:06.260
and did a side hop, which immediately gets them

17:06.260 --> 17:07.340
up to top speed.

17:07.340 --> 17:08.800
This is one of my favorite tricks right here.

17:08.800 --> 17:11.300
Normally, this pole, like, you have to slowly

17:11.300 --> 17:13.440
do a balancing act as you walk across it.

17:13.860 --> 17:15.860
You're taking your sweet old time.

17:15.860 --> 17:18.080
Runners have reached the point where they leap onto it

17:18.080 --> 17:19.540
in a straight line and don't fall off,

17:19.540 --> 17:21.120
and then turn and do another jump off of it,

17:21.120 --> 17:23.040
so they never have to do it. It's incredible.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.920
Playing Mirror's Edge as fast as you can,

17:24.920 --> 17:26.920
and then going online and checking out a speedrun

17:26.920 --> 17:28.300
is a really fun experience.

17:28.300 --> 17:30.220
There are so many nuances and specifics

17:30.220 --> 17:32.300
to the game's level designs and movement mechanics

17:32.300 --> 17:34.600
that it's just a joy to see how much extra speed

17:34.600 --> 17:36.060
can be teased out.

17:36.060 --> 17:38.600
But the game's parkour focus and aesthetic

17:38.600 --> 17:40.400
also poses a question for runners.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.640
What does it mean to speedrun?

17:42.680 --> 17:44.680
What does it mean to speedrun Mirror's Edge?

17:44.680 --> 17:46.440
There's a variety of interesting glitches

17:46.440 --> 17:48.140
available to exploit if you want to beat

17:48.140 --> 17:49.600
Mirror's Edge as fast as possible,

17:49.600 --> 17:51.560
but some of them significantly impact

17:51.560 --> 17:53.980
the way the game is played and what the experience

17:53.980 --> 17:55.280
of watching it is like.

17:55.280 --> 17:57.160
Take, for example, the out-of-bounds glitch,

17:57.160 --> 17:58.280
or OOB.

17:58.280 --> 18:00.540
Plenty of games let you get OOB of the level

18:00.540 --> 18:02.740
and use this to get to places meant to be reached

18:02.740 --> 18:04.500
through slower or harder means.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.280
This can be used very egregiously

18:06.280 --> 18:08.920
to bypass large chunks of several levels,

18:08.920 --> 18:11.380
and this is technically much, much faster

18:11.420 --> 18:13.240
than playing the game the normal way.

18:13.240 --> 18:16.540
But it also runs counter to the sort of principles

18:16.540 --> 18:19.300
that make Mirror's Edge the game you'd want to see speedrun

18:19.300 --> 18:20.720
in the first place, doesn't it?

18:20.720 --> 18:22.680
It's a game all about motion, finesse,

18:22.680 --> 18:24.680
clever use of controls and timing

18:24.680 --> 18:27.260
to skirt along the edge of the proverbial mirror,

18:27.260 --> 18:30.140
not to clip through it and then just win.

18:30.140 --> 18:32.640
Part of the fun of speedrunning is watching a game

18:32.640 --> 18:35.220
being played very skillfully and very quickly,

18:35.220 --> 18:37.600
and some tricks rub up against what some people

18:37.600 --> 18:40.440
would define as skillfully playing the game.

18:40.460 --> 18:42.260
So Mirror's Edge has multiple categories

18:42.260 --> 18:43.460
for the main run through the game,

18:43.460 --> 18:46.000
including Any% and Glitchless.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.800
In Any%, you can be treated to a faster run of the game

18:48.800 --> 18:50.340
using a lot of technical trickery

18:50.340 --> 18:53.300
to run across surfaces in weird and impossible ways,

18:53.300 --> 18:56.220
accelerate far faster than was probably ever intended,

18:56.220 --> 18:59.400
abuse a bizarre mistake in the wall-run kick programming

18:59.400 --> 19:02.180
that allows you to jump on one frame right afterwards

19:02.180 --> 19:04.020
like Faith had a double jump or something,

19:04.020 --> 19:07.020
slide into parts of the world you were never meant to see,

19:07.020 --> 19:09.700
have an LSD trip nightmare as every frame

19:09.700 --> 19:12.280
of Faith's movement is suspended before her eyes,

19:12.280 --> 19:14.040
and climb through moving elevators

19:14.040 --> 19:16.080
to shoot up into darkness.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.460
This run is really interesting and showcases

19:18.460 --> 19:20.300
some amazing tricks and moves,

19:20.300 --> 19:22.760
but it's also maybe not the sort of stuff

19:22.760 --> 19:25.300
it's fun to see specifically in a speedrun

19:25.300 --> 19:26.560
of this type of game.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.480
This is obviously highly subjective, of course,

19:28.480 --> 19:31.260
but the community seems to agree with me, so I win.

19:31.260 --> 19:34.360
In around 2013, they introduced the Glitchless category,

19:34.360 --> 19:36.860
which specifically prohibits using major glitches

19:36.860 --> 19:38.820
that alter the flow of the game in this way.

19:38.820 --> 19:40.940
Glitchless runs don't go out of bounds,

19:40.940 --> 19:43.320
don't abuse the weird extra jump you can get

19:43.320 --> 19:44.400
from kicking off a wall,

19:44.400 --> 19:46.400
and prohibit a few other specific tricks

19:46.400 --> 19:49.160
that some people might deem against the spirit

19:49.160 --> 19:50.200
of Mirror's Edge.

19:50.200 --> 19:53.660
Glitchless has never and will never be faster than any percent,

19:53.660 --> 19:57.000
but to me, at least, it's even more entertaining to watch.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.660
Runners in this category are navigating

19:58.660 --> 20:01.040
through more of the intended world of Mirror's Edge,

20:01.040 --> 20:04.120
which, for someone who played and really liked the game,

20:04.120 --> 20:06.180
is a way more interesting challenge.

20:06.180 --> 20:08.420
All kinds of segments that are completely avoided

20:08.440 --> 20:10.400
by fairly easy tricks in any percent

20:10.400 --> 20:13.520
have to actually be played and routed properly in Glitchless.

20:13.520 --> 20:17.120
Let's compare just one jump across both categories.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.740
Here's the entrance to the RPA building in the second level.

20:19.740 --> 20:22.240
This jump is one of the first properly tough jumps

20:22.240 --> 20:23.620
in the game. It's a long distance,

20:23.620 --> 20:25.580
but also involves downward traversal.

20:25.580 --> 20:28.420
You have to approach it at speed and jump really late,

20:28.420 --> 20:31.120
but also roll when you land or you get hurt.

20:31.120 --> 20:33.720
Either rolling or taking damage is really slow.

20:33.720 --> 20:36.600
A runner doesn't really want to do either of those things.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.380
In the current Glitchless world record,

20:38.400 --> 20:41.400
the runner Wreck executes an incredibly skillful maneuver

20:41.400 --> 20:43.680
to take full advantage of this rail here,

20:43.680 --> 20:46.520
so they land on the rail instead of the regular ground,

20:46.520 --> 20:48.820
which prevents them having to roll or take damage,

20:48.820 --> 20:52.620
but they also turned in midair and executed a side jump

20:52.620 --> 20:55.400
to immediately get back to top speed when they landed.

20:55.400 --> 20:57.000
This is really, really cool.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.120
It's really difficult to do. I can't do it.

20:59.120 --> 21:01.820
Here's the same part in the current Any% world record

21:01.820 --> 21:03.160
by Philotrax.

21:03.160 --> 21:04.920
Trax abuses the wall kick jump

21:04.920 --> 21:07.960
to effectively fly over this challenging gap,

21:07.960 --> 21:10.140
landing safely on some of the game's trademark

21:10.140 --> 21:12.520
white plant furniture stuff.

21:12.520 --> 21:15.060
Extrapolating tricks like this across a full game run

21:15.060 --> 21:18.020
makes for two very different and uniquely interesting paths

21:18.020 --> 21:19.260
through the game to watch.

21:19.260 --> 21:21.480
Earlier, I asked the question of which category

21:21.480 --> 21:24.280
should be considered the real speedrunner of the game,

21:24.280 --> 21:27.060
but I don't think there's an objective answer,

21:27.060 --> 21:28.360
at least for most games.

21:28.360 --> 21:29.700
Even in Bloodborne's case,

21:29.700 --> 21:31.780
using bugs that were patched out later,

21:31.780 --> 21:34.240
this is a version of Bloodborne that was released,

21:34.240 --> 21:36.420
and it beats the game as fast as possible,

21:36.420 --> 21:38.460
and in Mirror's Edge, maybe clipping through walls

21:38.460 --> 21:41.580
should be seen as just as valid a strategy as not doing so,

21:41.580 --> 21:43.800
but everyone gets to decide for themselves

21:43.800 --> 21:46.000
how to figure out what a speedrun needs to be,

21:46.000 --> 21:47.640
and usually there's gonna be enough people

21:47.640 --> 21:49.520
who feel that way that it's gonna end up

21:49.520 --> 21:50.720
as a speedrun category,

21:50.720 --> 21:52.220
and the Mirror's Edge community has come up

21:52.220 --> 21:54.440
with quite a lot of categories over the years.

21:54.440 --> 21:56.720
I've only talked about one of the extra ones so far.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.400
There's also Any% in bounds,

21:58.400 --> 22:00.680
which specifically avoids out-of-bounds glitches

22:00.680 --> 22:02.320
if you think going oob is wrong

22:02.320 --> 22:03.780
and are okay with the more advanced

22:03.780 --> 22:05.440
wall kick jump tricks and stuff.

22:05.460 --> 22:06.880
There's much more healthy competition

22:06.880 --> 22:09.440
when there are multiple agreed sets of rules to choose from.

22:09.440 --> 22:11.680
I imagine if there had only been one ruling

22:11.680 --> 22:14.100
for how to speedrun Mirror's Edge,

22:14.100 --> 22:16.520
it would be a lot less satisfying for a lot of runners

22:16.520 --> 22:18.480
and wouldn't have seen quite as many runners

22:18.480 --> 22:19.860
come and go over the years.

22:19.860 --> 22:21.820
One runner eventually got a job at DICE

22:21.820 --> 22:23.240
and worked on the sequel,

22:23.240 --> 22:25.900
which apparently some people even played,

22:25.900 --> 22:26.740
so that's nice.

22:26.740 --> 22:29.160
Speedrunning is a completely arbitrary challenge,

22:29.160 --> 22:32.160
one that most developers never even think to account for,

22:32.160 --> 22:34.340
so it's totally fine to have multiple ways

22:34.360 --> 22:35.740
of categorizing runs,

22:35.740 --> 22:37.700
different kinds of challenge and so on

22:37.700 --> 22:40.540
because some types of run are more interesting than others

22:40.540 --> 22:42.700
and none are really any more valid

22:42.700 --> 22:45.340
because they're all ultimately just silly things

22:45.340 --> 22:47.880
some people do for the sake of fun and competition.

22:47.880 --> 22:50.260
I think it's cool that even what it means

22:50.260 --> 22:53.300
to play a game quickly can be up for discussion sometimes.

22:53.300 --> 22:54.920
My favorite type of Mirror's Edge run

22:54.920 --> 22:58.100
is the 69 stars category, which is very nice.

22:58.100 --> 22:59.940
It's the category for running through all the game's

22:59.940 --> 23:01.480
optional time trials in one sitting

23:01.480 --> 23:02.760
and getting all the stars.

23:02.780 --> 23:04.860
It really embodies the things I enjoy the most

23:04.860 --> 23:06.280
about the Glitchless speedrun.

23:06.280 --> 23:08.820
It's just great performances utilizing mechanics

23:08.820 --> 23:11.120
mostly intended by the game's developers.

23:11.120 --> 23:13.960
Runners do awesome stuff like ignore the game's

23:13.960 --> 23:15.620
in-built run-ups for big jumps

23:15.620 --> 23:18.580
and instead make really precise movement over them

23:18.580 --> 23:21.660
to jump manually at the edge and make it further and faster.

23:21.660 --> 23:22.660
It's awesome.

23:22.660 --> 23:26.040
The current number one record is by Voatiem?

23:26.040 --> 23:27.680
Voatiem? I'm not sure,

23:27.680 --> 23:31.000
who got in just a teeny smidge over 21 minutes

23:31.000 --> 23:33.080
due to a couple of minor mistakes.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.540
You're kidding, right?

23:34.540 --> 23:37.460
Someone is going to beat 21 minutes in this category,

23:37.460 --> 23:38.960
and I can't wait. It's gonna be awesome.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.960
And because Mirror's Edge seems to inspire

23:40.960 --> 23:43.840
utter obsession in its fans, myself included,

23:43.840 --> 23:47.060
speedrun.com also has a category extension leaderboard

23:47.060 --> 23:49.600
for even more weirder and specific runs.

23:49.600 --> 23:52.220
Uh, speedrun.com slash memeem.

23:52.220 --> 23:53.680
Heh heh. It's pretty great.

23:53.680 --> 23:55.440
There's a true Glitchless category here

23:55.440 --> 23:58.140
for weirdo purists like me who just want to see

23:58.140 --> 24:00.780
the actual game played near perfectly.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.800
There's categories that often only even have

24:02.800 --> 24:04.480
one or two submitters where, like,

24:04.480 --> 24:06.400
runs where one runner uses the mouse

24:06.400 --> 24:07.780
and another uses the keyboard

24:07.780 --> 24:10.520
or where two runners each use half of one controller.

24:10.520 --> 24:12.280
Honestly, this is just getting silly now.

24:12.280 --> 24:13.860
What about a New Game Plus category

24:13.860 --> 24:16.240
where players chapter select the last segment

24:16.240 --> 24:18.000
and beat it in 13 seconds

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
and people are genuinely down to counting milliseconds

24:21.000 --> 24:23.120
to figure out who was actually the fastest?

24:23.120 --> 24:25.840
What about RBO, reverse boss order,

24:25.840 --> 24:28.420
where runners chapter select to each boss in the game

24:28.440 --> 24:31.240
in reverse order and time beating each of them?

24:31.240 --> 24:34.860
What about reverse RBO, where they do RBO backwards?

24:34.860 --> 24:36.280
Why would you do it like that?

24:36.280 --> 24:38.080
That's just boss. Why is it called that?

24:38.080 --> 24:40.660
How about Any% x 25,

24:40.660 --> 24:42.820
where one runner has decided to run the game

24:42.820 --> 24:45.080
25 times in a row,

24:45.080 --> 24:47.660
which took over 17 hours

24:47.660 --> 24:50.720
and which they openly declare no one will ever beat?

24:50.720 --> 24:52.720
What the fuck are your sidesteps right now?

24:52.720 --> 24:56.600
I told you I'm not even paying attention anymore.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.540
Why would you do this, Hekigan?

24:58.540 --> 25:01.460
Was your 60-millisecond lead in New Game Plus

25:01.460 --> 25:04.000
not enough anymore? Did you need something stronger?

25:04.000 --> 25:05.800
What are you doing to yourself?

25:06.800 --> 25:10.100
This is also where the segmented speedrun lives

25:10.100 --> 25:12.860
with various runners including the aforementioned Hekigan,

25:12.860 --> 25:15.640
Votime, Votime,

25:15.640 --> 25:18.600
Philotrax, and Wreck all contributing small segments

25:18.600 --> 25:21.100
to produce an absolutely incredible run.

25:21.100 --> 25:23.940
It's a fabulous expression of a community's commitment

25:23.940 --> 25:25.660
to beating a game as fast as possible

25:25.660 --> 25:27.620
and their years of developing skills

25:27.620 --> 25:30.320
and learning more and more about how the game works.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.960
I love it. Link in the description.

25:31.960 --> 25:34.000
Just give it a look. It's just great.

25:34.020 --> 25:37.040
There's a tremendous sense of community to speedrunning.

25:37.040 --> 25:39.200
People share information and discoveries,

25:39.200 --> 25:40.700
discuss theories together,

25:40.700 --> 25:43.300
and all the tricks used in runs are by their nature

25:43.300 --> 25:45.380
immediately available for further analysis

25:45.380 --> 25:46.660
and use in other runs.

25:46.660 --> 25:47.760
I remember, like, way back in the day,

25:47.760 --> 25:49.720
like, in 2014, like, I was in a Skype call

25:49.720 --> 25:51.880
with some other SMS runners.

25:51.880 --> 25:53.760
We were watching Tobu do some runs,

25:53.760 --> 25:56.180
and we've never seen that spin jump before,

25:56.180 --> 25:58.480
and it just, like, it blew our minds.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.400
We're like, okay, I'm never gonna go for that,

26:00.400 --> 26:01.680
and that was just, like, commonplace,

26:01.700 --> 26:03.120
so that just goes to show, like,

26:03.120 --> 26:04.420
how far this game has come.

26:04.420 --> 26:06.080
Yeah. Speedrunning is an almost

26:06.080 --> 26:09.080
inherently collectivist activity in this sense.

26:09.080 --> 26:11.160
While there is competition to be the best

26:11.160 --> 26:12.540
and take or hold the record,

26:12.540 --> 26:14.960
almost no record holder has completely earned

26:14.960 --> 26:16.640
that position all on their own.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.100
The best runs owe a debt to the discoveries

26:19.100 --> 26:21.420
and ideas contributed by previous runners.

26:21.420 --> 26:23.020
The best run is often representative

26:23.020 --> 26:24.840
of many people's contributions

26:24.840 --> 26:26.800
alongside the runner's own skill, of course.

26:26.800 --> 26:29.900
In a sense, speedruns are always a group effort.

26:29.920 --> 26:33.040
It's really not surprising that awesome charity events

26:33.040 --> 26:35.380
like GDQ have emerged from this space.

26:35.380 --> 26:37.120
It's just a grander scaled version

26:37.120 --> 26:39.680
of what speedrunning had kind of always been.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.800
You can't copyright a technique or strategy

26:41.800 --> 26:43.640
for beating a video game quickly.

26:43.640 --> 26:45.760
There are no patents in speedrunning.

26:45.760 --> 26:47.260
Proving that you got a time

26:47.260 --> 26:49.640
or even getting the fastest time

26:49.640 --> 26:52.560
isn't just an achievement or personal victory.

26:52.560 --> 26:55.260
It's also automatically a contribution

26:55.260 --> 26:57.360
to the greater community effort,

26:57.360 --> 26:58.900
and that's radical.

26:59.860 --> 27:02.180
But speedrunning isn't always about socialism.

27:02.180 --> 27:05.180
Sometimes it's about beating video games very quickly.

27:05.180 --> 27:07.640
Part three, in-depth investigation.

27:07.640 --> 27:09.600
Actually, no, I've thought of a better title for this one.

27:09.600 --> 27:10.900
Donkey Kong.

27:10.900 --> 27:11.440
Ah!

27:11.440 --> 27:14.440
["DONKEY KONG 64 THEME"]

27:14.440 --> 27:17.700
["DONKEY KONG 64 THEME"]

27:17.700 --> 27:19.940
Donkey Kong 64 is a game by Rareware

27:19.940 --> 27:21.280
for the Nintendo 64.

27:21.280 --> 27:22.400
Oh, you don't need to know that part.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.700
It's very much the embodiment of the stereotypes

27:24.700 --> 27:26.560
about Rare's games for the time period.

27:26.560 --> 27:29.560
Large levels full of hundreds of different specific items

27:29.560 --> 27:32.720
you have to collect to unlock more things to collect.

27:32.720 --> 27:35.860
For instance, each level has 500 bananas,

27:35.860 --> 27:37.940
but what makes it particularly troublesome

27:37.940 --> 27:39.860
is that some items are specifically

27:39.860 --> 27:42.260
for one of the five characters you play.

27:42.260 --> 27:44.220
To collect enough stuff to progress,

27:44.220 --> 27:46.020
you'd have to traverse the same environments

27:46.020 --> 27:48.180
over and over with every character,

27:48.180 --> 27:49.980
and the levels were often really big.

27:49.980 --> 27:51.640
At the time, it made the game feel big

27:51.640 --> 27:53.520
and like a cool, sprawling adventure

27:53.520 --> 27:55.440
that lasted a long time and had a lot of chances

27:55.440 --> 27:57.400
to see how each character can progress

27:57.400 --> 27:58.480
through the same environment

27:58.480 --> 28:00.440
using their own skills and abilities.

28:00.440 --> 28:02.560
That's because I was seven years old.

28:02.560 --> 28:03.860
["BOOM"]

28:03.860 --> 28:06.480
Now it just feels like time-consuming busywork.

28:06.480 --> 28:08.320
Lots of this was completely unnecessary

28:08.320 --> 28:09.940
from a design standpoint, too.

28:09.940 --> 28:11.820
You could design a game with collectibles

28:11.820 --> 28:14.060
only one character could reach in the first place

28:14.060 --> 28:16.020
instead of most of the time just having them

28:16.020 --> 28:17.560
hanging out there, faded out,

28:17.560 --> 28:19.780
reminding you you're gonna have to come back here again

28:19.780 --> 28:20.900
with another character,

28:20.900 --> 28:23.100
and running back to that barrel that changes characters

28:23.100 --> 28:25.600
because you need to pick something else up is awful.

28:25.600 --> 28:27.640
Running back to previously completed levels

28:27.640 --> 28:30.020
because you finally have the characters you needed

28:30.020 --> 28:32.360
to pick up those bananas you'd already walked past

28:32.360 --> 28:34.680
eight times is a more painful tragedy

28:34.680 --> 28:36.400
than Titus Andronicus.

28:36.400 --> 28:39.400
I would cut off my hand and send it to Emperor Saturninus

28:39.400 --> 28:41.320
if it meant I could have just picked that banana up

28:41.320 --> 28:44.680
four hours ago with Daddy Kong instead of Yankle Kong.

28:44.680 --> 28:46.940
I can feel my cells dividing

28:46.940 --> 28:50.360
as my precious existence rushes toward its finite end

28:50.360 --> 28:53.620
with nothing in the world to beguile my sorrow

28:53.620 --> 28:55.660
but the sweet siren song of,

28:55.660 --> 28:57.820
ooh, banana.

28:57.820 --> 29:00.900
Donkey Kong 64 is an existential crisis

29:00.900 --> 29:03.580
in the form of a video game cartridge.

29:03.580 --> 29:07.860
I'm actually more aware of the futility of my existence

29:07.860 --> 29:10.240
after trying to go back and play this.

29:10.240 --> 29:13.940
Now, I could sit you down and explain the progression

29:13.940 --> 29:16.040
of the Donkey Kong 64 Any% run to you

29:16.040 --> 29:17.740
like it was the back of my hand,

29:17.780 --> 29:20.540
but firstly, there's already a video

29:20.540 --> 29:22.700
by Summoning Salt out there doing just that,

29:22.700 --> 29:24.320
and that video's better than anything I could do,

29:24.320 --> 29:25.860
so you should just go check that one out,

29:25.860 --> 29:28.320
and secondly, well, to be honest,

29:28.320 --> 29:31.240
I've seen a lot of speedruns at this point,

29:31.240 --> 29:32.860
and I'm kind of used to it, you know?

29:32.860 --> 29:34.360
Oh, yeah, Donkey Kong 64,

29:34.360 --> 29:36.580
a game I beat in 72 hours as a kid

29:36.580 --> 29:38.900
being beaten by a professional in 30 minutes.

29:38.900 --> 29:41.580
Yeah, sure, that's impressive.

29:41.580 --> 29:46.860
To a clown at the circus, I need something stronger.

29:46.860 --> 29:48.820
I've built up a tolerance to this stuff.

29:48.820 --> 29:51.360
We need to go deeper and darker.

29:51.360 --> 29:53.020
We need to talk about the players who will settle

29:53.020 --> 29:55.320
for nothing more than total conquest,

29:55.320 --> 29:57.560
and no, I'm not talking about

29:57.560 --> 30:00.560
Donkey Kong Country 2 Diddy's Kong Quest.

30:00.560 --> 30:02.020
You get it's a pun.

30:02.020 --> 30:07.020
No, I'm talking about the Donkey Kong 64 100% speedrun.

30:07.020 --> 30:08.600
Yeah.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.860
Well, technically, it's the 101% speedrun

30:10.860 --> 30:12.900
because Rareware were pretty good

30:12.900 --> 30:15.100
at ironically recognizing that they'd put

30:15.100 --> 30:17.340
way too many collectibles in their goddamn game.

30:17.340 --> 30:19.420
To achieve 101% completion,

30:19.420 --> 30:21.560
players must collect the Nintendo coin,

30:21.560 --> 30:23.640
the Rareware coin, all eight keys,

30:23.640 --> 30:25.960
all ten battle crowns, all 20 fairies,

30:25.960 --> 30:28.420
all 201 golden bananas,

30:28.420 --> 30:30.260
and all 40 banana medals,

30:30.260 --> 30:31.880
each of which is awarded for collecting

30:31.880 --> 30:34.520
75 of a Kong's bananas in a level

30:34.520 --> 30:38.640
for a total of 3,000 bananas.

30:38.640 --> 30:41.220
Hey, but sometimes they come in little bunches of five.

30:41.220 --> 30:42.340
Thanks, Donkey Kong.

30:42.340 --> 30:44.420
The rules list for this run on speedrun.com

30:44.420 --> 30:46.240
actually includes the stipulation

30:46.240 --> 30:48.240
that to submit runs for this category,

30:48.240 --> 30:49.820
you must hate yourself.

30:49.820 --> 30:53.420
Runners in this category endure such supreme torments

30:53.420 --> 30:55.080
that one of them fucking streamed themselves

30:55.080 --> 30:57.460
breaking their cartridge to make sure it was over.

30:57.460 --> 30:59.000
This is my DK cart.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.660
Fun fact.

31:00.660 --> 31:02.240
Did you know that the PAL version

31:02.240 --> 31:04.620
of the Donkey Kong 64 cartridge was gray,

31:04.620 --> 31:07.320
but the US retail version was banana yellow?

31:07.320 --> 31:09.860
Heh, you learn something new every day.

31:09.860 --> 31:11.820
This run is challenging in far more ways

31:11.820 --> 31:12.960
than the traditional run.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
In that run, your objective is fairly simple.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.540
Find the fastest way to the end,

31:16.540 --> 31:17.620
whatever that way may be,

31:17.620 --> 31:19.200
abusing cutscene glitches,

31:19.200 --> 31:20.920
level skips, moon jumps, et cetera,

31:20.920 --> 31:22.120
effectively ending up with runs

31:22.120 --> 31:23.860
where you do as little as possible.

31:23.860 --> 31:26.460
This run's core is having to actually do

31:26.460 --> 31:28.120
everything the game asks of you,

31:28.120 --> 31:29.920
planning the most efficient route possible

31:29.920 --> 31:30.960
through all of it,

31:30.960 --> 31:33.160
and then somehow actually doing it all

31:33.160 --> 31:34.660
precisely and quickly,

31:34.660 --> 31:36.860
but with hundreds of golden bananas to collect,

31:36.860 --> 31:39.080
and some of these can be very challenging,

31:39.080 --> 31:41.500
and thousands of bananas!

31:41.500 --> 31:44.000
Executing on all of this in succession

31:44.000 --> 31:47.040
introduces a new kind of test for these runners,

31:47.040 --> 31:48.200
resilience.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.460
Paradoxically, as with the Beast Blood pellet,

31:50.460 --> 31:52.040
when quicker strategies are found,

31:52.040 --> 31:54.280
often that makes the game easier to beat

31:54.280 --> 31:56.040
because the length of time you have to focus

31:56.040 --> 31:57.860
on execution has gotten shorter.

31:57.860 --> 32:00.320
You only have to pull off 30 minutes of good stuff

32:00.320 --> 32:02.580
to beat the Any% run in 30 minutes.

32:02.580 --> 32:05.500
If something takes around five hours to beat,

32:05.500 --> 32:08.460
that's five hours of time to make mistakes in.

32:08.460 --> 32:11.580
Five hours to get tired or lose focus

32:11.580 --> 32:14.380
or slip from your intended most efficient path.

32:14.380 --> 32:17.200
These runs are essentially torture,

32:17.200 --> 32:18.960
and they're amazing.

32:18.960 --> 32:22.280
There's a three-year-old run by German runner 360 Chris M.

32:22.280 --> 32:26.040
that took 19 hours and 53 minutes.

32:26.040 --> 32:29.820
The best part of this run is it has face cam.

32:29.820 --> 32:34.160
You can watch in real time as the sun sets and rises,

32:34.160 --> 32:36.780
and he gets ever closer to making it to the end.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.240
He no-sells it, too.

32:38.280 --> 32:40.780
Like, by the end, he still doesn't seem that tired.

32:40.780 --> 32:41.900
It's kind of awesome.

32:41.900 --> 32:43.100
Despite there being plenty of runs

32:43.100 --> 32:44.940
that are way, way more optimized,

32:44.940 --> 32:47.440
the better runs push the five-and-a-half-hours mark,

32:47.440 --> 32:49.780
there's something very special about runs like this one

32:49.780 --> 32:51.360
where they probably know their planned route

32:51.360 --> 32:53.020
is gonna take them a full day,

32:53.020 --> 32:55.280
but they sit down and do it.

32:55.280 --> 32:58.780
I kind of love runs like this just for their sheer dedication

32:58.780 --> 33:00.940
regardless of how efficient they are.

33:00.940 --> 33:03.480
Yeah!

33:03.480 --> 33:04.940
Whoo!

33:04.940 --> 33:06.440
Sub 20, boys!

33:06.480 --> 33:08.640
PB, boys. I PB'd by, uh,

33:08.640 --> 33:10.340
four hours and six minutes.

33:10.340 --> 33:11.340
Pretty solid.

33:11.340 --> 33:13.560
Wait, his last attempt took nearly 25 hou—

33:13.560 --> 33:14.480
Holy shi—

33:14.480 --> 33:16.260
The various runs of this game have led players

33:16.260 --> 33:18.940
to look very closely at almost every aspect,

33:18.940 --> 33:21.020
even going so far as using hacking software

33:21.020 --> 33:22.940
to analyze the code in detail,

33:22.940 --> 33:24.680
looking for anything that can be exploited

33:24.680 --> 33:25.860
to make runs faster.

33:25.860 --> 33:28.680
DK64 has been investigated in a level of detail

33:28.680 --> 33:30.980
greater than the developers could have ever intended

33:30.980 --> 33:33.300
or expected, and that's led to new discoveries

33:34.160 --> 33:36.420
but also to something really cool.

33:36.420 --> 33:37.840
Enter Isotarge.

33:37.840 --> 33:40.220
Isotarge is a runner with a really respectable time

33:40.220 --> 33:41.380
in the any% category,

33:41.380 --> 33:43.260
but it's also the longest-standing run

33:43.260 --> 33:44.720
in the top ten by far.

33:44.720 --> 33:47.460
In fact, it was the world record for six months back in 2015.

33:47.460 --> 33:49.800
Isotarge has made a lot of contributions to the community,

33:49.800 --> 33:51.960
including spending a lot of time digging around

33:51.960 --> 33:54.080
inside the game's code, finding new glitches

33:54.080 --> 33:55.960
and holes in world geometry and so on,

33:55.960 --> 33:58.220
anything that could be exploited to get better runs.

33:58.220 --> 34:00.080
Isotarge has found a lot of cool stuff in the game,

34:00.080 --> 34:02.460
including this image of a Rareware employee's face

34:02.460 --> 34:03.960
hidden inside the game's files,

34:03.960 --> 34:06.780
which looks like it's been edited in a Game Boy Camera,

34:06.780 --> 34:08.780
but they've also found stuff like this.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.460
Out-of-bounds collectibles.

34:10.460 --> 34:12.700
It's common for developers to leave items and objects

34:12.700 --> 34:14.960
in places players can't get to in the game proper

34:14.960 --> 34:16.500
and not worry about removing them,

34:16.500 --> 34:19.080
like this coin hidden in a wall in Mario 64

34:19.080 --> 34:20.960
that someone actually figured out how to get,

34:20.960 --> 34:22.960
and since these items exist well outside

34:22.960 --> 34:24.240
the intended scope of the game,

34:24.240 --> 34:26.660
runs don't usually consider them collectibles

34:26.660 --> 34:27.580
as part of a run.

34:27.580 --> 34:29.040
They're more cool oddities

34:29.040 --> 34:31.160
that shouldn't really be considered as game objects

34:31.160 --> 34:32.200
to be collected.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.980
But what if an item was absolutely collectible

34:34.980 --> 34:36.280
without any glitches,

34:36.280 --> 34:38.160
but no one had found it before?

34:38.160 --> 34:39.820
One day when messing around in the game's code

34:39.820 --> 34:41.940
looking for flags for collectible objects,

34:41.940 --> 34:43.360
Isotarge found a banana coin

34:43.360 --> 34:46.620
that hadn't been accounted for in the level Fungi Forest.

34:46.620 --> 34:49.580
Banana coins in DK64 are used to buy items and upgrades,

34:49.580 --> 34:52.120
and because this is Donkey Kong 64,

34:52.120 --> 34:54.740
there are six different kinds of banana coin.

34:54.740 --> 34:56.160
There's one color for each character,

34:56.160 --> 34:57.540
but also a multicolored one,

34:57.540 --> 34:58.940
which is usually hard to find

34:58.940 --> 35:00.980
and gives five coins to every character

35:01.020 --> 35:02.180
as soon as it's collected.

35:02.180 --> 35:03.980
There's only 15 of them in the game,

35:03.980 --> 35:05.860
one in each level except Angry Aztec,

35:05.860 --> 35:09.140
which has two, and seven in the hub world of DK Isles.

35:09.140 --> 35:11.260
This new coin wasn't any of the ones

35:11.260 --> 35:12.940
that had been collected before,

35:12.940 --> 35:14.680
but unlike the other items,

35:14.680 --> 35:16.720
this one wasn't out of bounds.

35:16.720 --> 35:19.640
It was hidden in a place no one had ever thought to check,

35:19.640 --> 35:21.940
hidden in the tall grass in the level,

35:21.940 --> 35:24.140
right about hee- no, wait, sorry,

35:24.140 --> 35:25.860
right about...

35:25.860 --> 35:27.680
here.

35:27.680 --> 35:28.940
And there it is.

35:28.940 --> 35:30.220
As far as I can tell,

35:30.220 --> 35:33.340
this coin isn't mentioned anywhere on the Internet

35:33.340 --> 35:36.340
prior to its discovery by Isotarge in the game's code,

35:36.340 --> 35:37.640
and it's not in any strategy guide

35:37.640 --> 35:39.840
from the time period I can get my hands on.

35:39.840 --> 35:41.760
It's not really known whether the developers

35:41.760 --> 35:43.140
put this coin here intentionally,

35:43.140 --> 35:44.720
or forgot to remove it,

35:44.720 --> 35:47.880
or why they thought to give so little indication it was there.

35:47.880 --> 35:50.180
It's easy to see why it was missed for so long.

35:50.180 --> 35:51.680
Now, a cool kicker to this story

35:51.680 --> 35:54.800
would be that it invalidated all the 101% runs,

35:54.800 --> 35:56.880
or it turned out that there are now technically

35:56.880 --> 35:58.760
102% runs or something,

35:58.760 --> 36:01.420
but banana coins aren't counted for percentages

36:01.420 --> 36:02.500
on the game's menu screen,

36:02.500 --> 36:04.340
and the total amount of coins you can get

36:04.340 --> 36:06.000
isn't even listed in the game anywhere.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.960
The 101% run doesn't even include all of the bananas

36:08.960 --> 36:11.000
because the game only counts banana medals

36:11.000 --> 36:12.760
towards completion, so they don't even get

36:12.760 --> 36:16.420
all the bananas in the runs where you get 101% completion,

36:16.420 --> 36:18.580
which is a bit of a disappointment, really.

36:18.580 --> 36:20.500
You should get them all next time.

36:20.500 --> 36:22.040
To amuse me.

36:22.040 --> 36:24.040
Here's the SGDQ run in 2017,

36:24.040 --> 36:25.420
soon after the coin was discovered,

36:25.420 --> 36:28.080
where they just stopped to get it for kicks.

36:28.100 --> 36:30.580
Lo and behold, it is...

36:30.580 --> 36:33.120
the Rainbow Coin!

36:33.120 --> 36:34.360
Yeah.

36:34.360 --> 36:37.080
Uh, that Rainbow Coin has been hidden

36:37.080 --> 36:38.860
basically since the game came out,

36:38.860 --> 36:41.660
so, uh, over 16 years, right?

36:41.660 --> 36:43.660
It's not technically a major discovery,

36:43.660 --> 36:45.580
and it changes nothing about how the game is run

36:45.580 --> 36:46.620
in the main categories,

36:46.620 --> 36:47.920
outside of what are essentially

36:47.920 --> 36:50.580
ultra-masochistic jokes that people only really do

36:50.580 --> 36:53.080
just to be one of the two people who ever did it at all,

36:53.080 --> 36:55.580
but it's still a really, really cool discovery.

36:55.580 --> 36:58.420
Something was hidden just out of plain sight,

36:58.420 --> 37:00.580
even to the people who would make a point

37:00.580 --> 37:02.580
of collecting everything in the game

37:02.580 --> 37:04.580
for 17 years.

37:04.580 --> 37:06.080
What's fun about the Banana Coin

37:06.080 --> 37:07.920
is that it's kind of an abstract example

37:07.920 --> 37:09.920
of how awesome speedrunning communities are

37:09.920 --> 37:12.080
for deconstructing and examining games.

37:12.080 --> 37:14.080
Like, people are so dedicated

37:14.080 --> 37:16.080
to coming to an understanding of a game,

37:16.080 --> 37:18.080
they're uncovering things which probably would've remained

37:18.080 --> 37:19.580
hidden forever otherwise.

37:19.580 --> 37:22.080
And that's just neat, no matter how you peel it.

37:22.080 --> 37:23.580
Oh, God, did I just say...

37:23.580 --> 37:25.580
Why is speedrunning awesome?

37:25.580 --> 37:27.580
Because people are awesome.

37:27.580 --> 37:29.580
Because watching someone try something

37:29.580 --> 37:31.580
over and over again, getting better and better,

37:31.580 --> 37:33.580
and learning new secrets and strategies

37:33.580 --> 37:35.580
in order to be the best at something,

37:35.580 --> 37:37.080
sometimes for years,

37:37.080 --> 37:40.080
is compelling and fascinating and human

37:40.080 --> 37:42.580
in a way that no other form of media,

37:42.580 --> 37:45.580
no television show could ever adequately replicate,

37:45.580 --> 37:48.080
because a real human person

37:48.080 --> 37:50.080
is sitting right there and doing it.

37:50.080 --> 37:52.080
I opened this video using clips

37:52.080 --> 37:54.580
from an attempt to finish Zelda Ocarina of Time

37:54.580 --> 37:57.580
in the Any% category by skater82297.

37:57.580 --> 38:00.580
This video in particular is one of my favorites.

38:00.580 --> 38:03.080
This guy's been hammering away at Zelda Ocarina of Time

38:03.080 --> 38:04.580
since at least 2014,

38:04.580 --> 38:06.580
shaving seconds, fractions of seconds,

38:06.580 --> 38:08.080
off of his personal best.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.580
Here's a cool trick. On speedrun.com,

38:09.580 --> 38:12.080
you can actually click to see all of the obsoleted runs,

38:12.080 --> 38:15.580
runs that a runner has themselves gone on to supersede.

38:15.580 --> 38:17.580
If you turn that on,

38:17.580 --> 38:21.580
this guy basically is the top 20 fastest runs of Zelda

38:21.580 --> 38:23.080
of all time.

38:23.080 --> 38:24.580
But he didn't have number one.

38:24.580 --> 38:26.080
Someone else was faster than him.

38:26.080 --> 38:28.080
So he just kept going and going.

38:28.080 --> 38:29.580
And you can see all of his runs.

38:29.580 --> 38:31.080
And live on his channel,

38:31.080 --> 38:34.080
you could have seen all of the many, many attempts

38:34.080 --> 38:36.580
that went into even getting those runs.

38:36.580 --> 38:38.580
And in this run, you see him get annoyed

38:38.580 --> 38:40.080
by the tiniest things.

38:40.080 --> 38:43.080
Goma doesn't activate for about a second longer

38:43.080 --> 38:44.580
than he thinks it should,

38:44.580 --> 38:46.580
and it just frustrates the hell out of him.

38:48.080 --> 38:49.580
Dude.

38:49.580 --> 38:50.580
Fuck you!

38:50.580 --> 38:51.580
Fuck you!

38:51.580 --> 38:53.080
Fuck you! Fuck you!

38:53.080 --> 38:54.080
Fuck you.

38:54.080 --> 38:55.580
No. Fucking shit, dude.

38:55.580 --> 38:57.080
Fuck off.

38:57.080 --> 38:58.580
I'm mad. Now fuck off.

38:58.580 --> 39:01.080
He's angry about this boss not spawning fast enough,

39:01.080 --> 39:03.580
even though he can kill it in seconds flat.

39:03.580 --> 39:05.080
That was bullshit, dude.

39:05.080 --> 39:06.080
That was utter shit.

39:06.080 --> 39:07.580
That was bullshit.

39:07.580 --> 39:10.580
A random onlooker would wonder why someone did this to themselves,

39:10.580 --> 39:12.080
did something over and over,

39:12.080 --> 39:14.080
even though it clearly wasn't any fun for them.

39:14.080 --> 39:18.080
But then, they get deeper and deeper into the run.

39:18.580 --> 39:22.580
And they start to realize that this might be the one.

39:22.580 --> 39:25.080
The tone changes.

39:25.080 --> 39:27.080
Things get quiet.

39:29.580 --> 39:32.080
This might be happening.

39:32.080 --> 39:34.080
Is it happening?

39:36.580 --> 39:40.080
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.080
Oh, my God.

39:41.080 --> 39:44.080
Towards the end, he can barely even control his breathing.

39:45.080 --> 39:47.080
He's panicking. He's anxious.

39:47.080 --> 39:50.080
But he knows that if he can just execute on the ideas

39:50.080 --> 39:52.080
that he's been developing for years,

39:52.080 --> 39:54.080
this might be it.

39:55.080 --> 39:56.580
Oh, my God, dude!

39:56.580 --> 39:59.080
Oh, my fucking God!

39:59.080 --> 40:01.080
Oh!

40:01.080 --> 40:04.080
Okay. Okay.

40:07.080 --> 40:08.080
Yes, dude!

40:08.080 --> 40:10.080
Fucking yes!

40:10.080 --> 40:11.080
Yes!

40:11.080 --> 40:13.080
Oh, my God!

40:13.080 --> 40:15.080
Yes!

40:15.080 --> 40:16.080
Yes!

40:16.080 --> 40:18.080
Yes, dude!

40:18.080 --> 40:20.080
Oh, my God!

40:20.080 --> 40:22.080
Yes!

40:22.080 --> 40:24.080
Oh, my God!

40:24.080 --> 40:26.080
Oh, my God, dude!

40:26.080 --> 40:30.080
This run is currently the fastest run anyone has ever done

40:30.080 --> 40:32.080
of The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.

40:32.080 --> 40:34.080
And then, in that moment,

40:34.080 --> 40:38.080
in that period of being utterly overjoyed at this achievement,

40:38.080 --> 40:40.080
it becomes clear why people do this.

40:40.080 --> 40:43.080
And what you can get from this that you can't get anywhere else.

40:43.080 --> 40:45.080
It's a story.

40:45.080 --> 40:47.080
Not something written or directed by someone.

40:47.080 --> 40:50.080
A real human story.

40:50.080 --> 40:53.080
It's a story of perseverance and triumph.

40:53.080 --> 40:57.080
And it's derived from something so small and silly-seeming,

40:57.080 --> 41:00.080
but that only makes it more beautiful in a way.

41:00.080 --> 41:04.080
And the best part is, the story's not over.

41:04.080 --> 41:08.080
There's almost always more to learn about how to run any given game.

41:08.080 --> 41:11.080
Always someone trying to beat the record.

41:11.080 --> 41:13.080
And anyone can be a part of that.

41:13.080 --> 41:17.080
Or, at the very least, anyone can be there to watch it happen.

41:17.080 --> 41:20.080
This is probably why so many people tune in to events like GDQ

41:20.080 --> 41:23.080
and even donate money to support work that helps keep people alive

41:23.080 --> 41:26.080
so they can spend time with the people they love.

41:26.080 --> 41:28.080
Or, you know, watching speedruns.

41:28.080 --> 41:30.080
Hmm.

41:30.080 --> 41:32.080
Hmm.

41:38.080 --> 41:42.080
Okay, I have to admit, I told a bit of a porky pie earlier.

41:42.080 --> 41:44.080
That's Cockney rhyming slang for lie,

41:44.080 --> 41:48.080
which I clearly know, obvious Cockney, that I am.

41:48.080 --> 41:52.080
I never actually beat Donkey Kong 64 as a kid.

41:52.080 --> 41:54.080
I played it for 72 hours, and then I couldn't beat

41:54.080 --> 41:56.080
the Donkey Kong arcade part near the end,

41:56.080 --> 41:59.080
which you need to do to unlock the final boss fight.

41:59.080 --> 42:04.080
So I had 72 hours of play and nothing to show for it.

42:04.080 --> 42:07.080
And, frankly, that's piss.

42:07.080 --> 42:11.080
So to finally put this little fucker to rest,

42:11.080 --> 42:13.080
I'm gonna stream it.

42:13.080 --> 42:15.080
I'm gonna start the game again,

42:15.080 --> 42:17.080
and I'm gonna get absolutely everything in that game,

42:17.080 --> 42:20.080
including the rainbow coin just to bring everything full circle,

42:20.080 --> 42:22.080
and I'm gonna get absolutely everything, all the bananas,

42:22.080 --> 42:25.080
not the minimum required for 101% completion,

42:25.080 --> 42:27.080
and I'm not gonna stop until it's done.

42:27.080 --> 42:31.080
I might, I will, fall asleep in my chair.

42:31.080 --> 42:33.080
I'm not that resilient, although it is currently,

42:33.080 --> 42:36.080
no joke, 2.41 a.m.

42:36.080 --> 42:38.080
Hope you can see that.

42:38.080 --> 42:40.080
So I might do okay, but I should probably rig it up

42:40.080 --> 42:43.080
so that if anyone donates, an air horn will go off

42:43.080 --> 42:45.080
and wake me up. Let's just torture me

42:45.080 --> 42:47.080
for other people's enjoyment.

42:47.080 --> 42:49.080
And all the donations will go to charity.

42:49.080 --> 42:52.080
So finally some good can come out of Donkey Kong 64,

42:52.080 --> 42:54.080
because certainly no fun has come out of it.

42:54.080 --> 42:56.080
Anyway, thanks for watching this video.

42:56.080 --> 42:59.080
Um, it's really just a love letter to the speedrunning community

42:59.080 --> 43:02.080
because I just find it's been such a fulfilling part of my life,

43:02.080 --> 43:04.080
and it looks like a lot of other people's.

43:04.080 --> 43:07.080
A lot of gaming spaces can be pretty clicky at times,

43:07.080 --> 43:09.080
and I think speedrunning has generally avoided that

43:09.080 --> 43:12.080
with a lot of sort of close-knit but quite friendly communities.

43:12.080 --> 43:14.080
A lot of people were really forthcoming with information

43:14.080 --> 43:16.080
when I was doing research for this video,

43:16.080 --> 43:18.080
and that was just really awesome, and I just think it's cool

43:18.080 --> 43:21.080
how people can share the things they enjoy

43:21.080 --> 43:23.080
and learn more about stuff and occasionally raise

43:23.080 --> 43:25.080
quite a lot of money for some really good causes.

43:25.080 --> 43:28.080
I just think the whole thing is so fun and kind

43:28.080 --> 43:31.080
in a way that you don't see very often.

43:31.080 --> 43:33.080
So, yeah, just thought it was nice.

43:37.080 --> 43:40.080
Probably could have thought of a clever ending to this video,

43:40.080 --> 43:42.080
but...

43:42.080 --> 43:44.080
Uh...
