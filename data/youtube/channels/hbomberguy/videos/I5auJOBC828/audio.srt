1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,420
By now you probably know what a speedrun is already.

2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,340
It's where players commit to beating a game as fast as possible.

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,340
On the surface, it's a bit silly.

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,060
People sitting down with one game, playing it over and over,

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,300
dedicating immense time and effort to learning its ins and outs

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,260
and learning skills that probably aren't all that helpful anywhere else.

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,040
And yet, somehow, the experience of taking part in

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,800
or even watching someone try to speedrun a game

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,300
is exhilarating and amazing and just fun,

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,640
and speedruns of some games frequently get millions of views.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,060
This clearly matters to a lot of people,

12
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,800
so there's probably a reason why,

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,100
and I was having trouble scratching out the reasons why,

14
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,400
so I arrived at the obvious solution of writing a YouTube video about it.

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,240
Speedrunning is really fun to watch,

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,940
and stories about speedrunning are consistently fascinating,

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,420
and I really want to talk about why,

18
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,800
and no one's managed to stop me so far.

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,340
["Souls"]

20
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,060
It's generally accepted that the Souls series is pretty difficult,

21
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,940
and they are, at least for beginners,

22
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,020
because the games are generally not great at teaching you how to really grasp playing them.

23
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,940
I've heard there's already a video out there somewhere

24
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,940
that drones on and on for way too long trying to explain this,

25
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,020
so we'll ignore that here.

26
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,240
This difficulty is the prime reason why speedruns of games in this series

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,820
are so entertaining to watch.

28
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,500
Owing to the games' inaccessibility

29
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,800
and the time investment required to get good, as it were,

30
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,680
watching someone blast through them is just plain fun.

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,600
What's interesting in a more in-depth way about speedruns, though,

32
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,680
is seeing how they develop over time,

33
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,440
and Dark Souls is a perfect example of why.

34
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,860
Part 1.

35
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,600
Development.

36
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,280
The earliest speedrun on record at speedruns.com,

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,660
a fantastic resource, by the way, for Dark Souls,

38
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,400
is by Japanese runner Twilight.

39
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,900
In 2011, a lot less was known about how Dark Souls really ticked,

40
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,740
and there was yet to be much of a community

41
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,940
to help pick away at all the possible fastest approaches to the game,

42
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,240
so Twilight's run consists largely of combining general tricks

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,780
that were widely known early on for making the game easier or faster.

44
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,060
For example, in Dark Souls, there are multiple different starting classes

45
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,400
with their own stats, starting items, and abilities.

46
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,560
While some do have unique advantages,

47
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,900
the Pyromancer starts with the ability to throw fireballs,

48
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,480
something none of the others can access for quite a while,

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,100
so it's usually the one recommended to new players

50
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,880
because if they're having trouble fighting,

51
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,840
they can throw fire on people.

52
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,300
I mean, come on. So Twilight picks them.

53
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,800
It's not really a surprise. It's kind of the obvious choice

54
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,640
if you were to think about how to speedrun this game

55
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,020
if you played it a few times.

56
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,020
The next big choice is the starting gift.

57
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,260
Players can choose something extra to start the game with

58
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,880
from a list at character creation.

59
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,980
Normally in Dark Souls, early on to continue deeper into the game,

60
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,220
players have to go through a fairly tough area,

61
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,420
fight a difficult boss to get a key to another difficult area,

62
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,420
then fight another boss there to progress through

63
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,660
to another difficult area called Blighttown,

64
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,080
which leads down to another boss,

65
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,580
which is guarding a bell you need to ring

66
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,780
to progress the game,

67
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,280
but for, uh, reasons,

68
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,500
the developers made one of the starting items

69
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,200
players can choose from a key

70
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,240
that unlocks a gate in the starting area,

71
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,160
which skips past two of those bosses

72
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,620
right into the lower part of Blighttown,

73
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,880
so it's pretty clear what item a speedrunner

74
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,280
would want to start with here.

75
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,880
It's just the most obviously fast and helpful choice.

76
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,200
I mean, look at the other ones.

77
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,380
Binoculars, a rubbish ring,

78
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,740
a n-n-a more rubbish ring,

79
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,280
pendant, trinket, no effect,

80
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,780
black firebombs?

81
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,780
What a garbage option.

82
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,700
Why would anyone ever pick that?

83
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,120
I don't know. I guess they're pretty good.

84
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,500
I mean, they're more deadly than STD bomb.

85
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,920
What? Another initially obvious trick for speedrunning

86
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,960
involves this drake that turns up early on

87
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,120
and hangs out up here.

88
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,540
Getting a decent weapon in this game

89
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,780
usually takes some time,

90
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,740
but once you get to this big scary boy,

91
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,160
one recommended way for new players to get an advantage

92
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,740
so they don't have too hard a time starting out

93
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,240
is to sit in a safe place and spam arrows at its tail

94
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,480
until it breaks off, giving you this sword.

95
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,940
The drake sword deals a ridiculous amount of damage

96
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,820
for the place in the game where you can get it.

97
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,200
It drops off in its usefulness quite quickly,

98
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,240
but for early players,

99
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,120
it's just a fantastic weapon to pick up,

100
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,860
but instead of wasting time and arrows,

101
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,280
of which they had neither,

102
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,360
Twilight simply dodged behind it

103
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,440
when it jumped down and cut its tail off

104
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,980
and then ran to the next area.

105
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,160
This is one of the most cathartic things

106
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,520
you can see in a speedrun.

107
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,060
You know, you spend a bunch of time dying to its fire

108
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,220
or getting kicked to death,

109
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,020
and then you see someone else just steal its tail

110
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,380
and run away with it

111
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,380
and proceed to beat people to death with it

112
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,680
for the rest of the game.

113
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,520
It's great.

114
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,680
A lot of Twilight's early run

115
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,100
consists of playing the game the way one normally would,

116
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,840
but just doing more running and ignoring enemies.

117
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,060
Early runs like this play the game basically as normal,

118
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,720
but very quickly and precisely

119
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,480
doing the most obviously easy and fast moves.

120
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,300
Twilight burns all the remaining bosses

121
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,600
with their hot, hot hands

122
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,800
and grabs enough humanity

123
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
that they can feed it to the Daughter of Chaos

124
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,800
and open a shortcut past all the major fire-based bosses,

125
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,060
which obviously would take a long time to fight

126
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,880
when all your weapons are fire.

127
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,560
Have you ever tried actually fighting fire with fire?

128
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,840
I'm on a watch list now.

129
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,500
After a lot of running past things and killing bosses,

130
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,960
they gather the four Lord Souls

131
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,420
required to open the big door

132
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,140
to the remnants of Great Uncle Gwynn's

133
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,000
mega weekend barbecue and kill him

134
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,460
so someone can finally call the fire department,

135
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,280
and they do it in an hour and 26 minutes in in-game time.

136
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,160
This is an ungodly fast speed to finish Dark Souls,

137
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,500
but there was a lot of improvement to make.

138
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,340
What I think is interesting about the early runs

139
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,540
through the game is that they weren't just improving

140
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,500
on execution of the same route

141
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,660
or finding slightly more improved paths,

142
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,500
but the nature of the entire route from the very start

143
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,920
was still up for debate.

144
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,280
Nothing was set in stone,

145
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,160
even what type of character you chose to play as,

146
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,620
and it wasn't clear what the fastest way would really be,

147
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,740
and that's a really fun experimental period

148
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,240
in the development of a speed run.

149
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,200
This is where Dark Souls runs excel

150
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,820
in the spectatorship aspect.

151
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,400
In lots of other games, you don't have as much choice

152
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,280
or freedom in where to go or what sort of character to play

153
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,700
or what weapon to use.

154
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,120
There are so many other paths or decisions

155
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,940
that could have been made in a Souls game

156
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,020
that the next run threatens to be completely different,

157
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,660
and, well, it was.

158
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,940
The next world record was set three months later

159
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,620
and has gone on to be the longest standing world record,

160
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,660
lasting 13 months.

161
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,240
It was set by another Japanese runner, Keita.

162
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,480
I hope I'm pronouncing that properly.

163
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,740
Ke, and then it's a neon gate, so Keita.

164
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,620
KEITA.

165
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,280
All right, what's really fun about this run

166
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,120
was it diverged from Twilight's path immediately.

167
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,540
Not only do they start the game with a different class

168
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,660
right out of the gate,

169
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,400
but once they make it to Firelink Shrine

170
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,580
and you assume their run is gonna be similar looking

171
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,740
but with slight improvements,

172
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,280
they get up and immediately head in the opposite direction.

173
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,040
KEITA.

174
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,580
Goes to parts of the game Twilight never even sees

175
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,420
in their run.

176
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,000
Firstly, they go to the Valley of Drakes,

177
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,280
dodge between the drakes,

178
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,820
and grab the Red Tearstone Ring,

179
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,420
which boosts the player's damage output

180
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,580
by roughly 66% when they're below 20% health.

181
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,960
By playing more riskily,

182
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,240
KEITA becomes much more dangerous.

183
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,540
This is the kind of improvement I love seeing in speedruns,

184
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,660
learning to abuse a risk-reward mechanic

185
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,620
to just get the rewards by simply playing really well.

186
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,540
In a speedrun, a risk-reward item

187
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,660
can very frequently become a reward.

188
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,240
Then they run into Darkroot Basin

189
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,860
and encounter the Black Knight there.

190
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,180
Now, Black Knights are tough enemies in the early game.

191
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,320
They don't take much damage

192
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,320
even when you riposte or backstab them.

193
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,780
You can see this is gonna take quite a-

194
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,100
Oh, he's pushed him off the cliff.

195
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,400
Is rewarded with the Black Knight Halberd.

196
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,240
You only get this weapon for killing the knight

197
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,060
like 20% of the time,

198
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,140
and these knights don't respawn.

199
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,780
This halberd forms the basis of KEITA's strategy,

200
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,560
so if they don't get the halberd here,

201
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,480
they would have to start the run again.

202
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,640
There are definitely countless runs

203
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,240
on the cutting room floor that ended here just because.

204
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,240
You can slightly increase the chance of it dropping

205
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,160
if you have more humanity on you,

206
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,020
but it's still like a crapshoot.

207
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,900
Now, there's a reason the last thing you fight

208
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,940
before the final boss is a Black Knight with a halberd.

209
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,480
Gwyn knew what was up.

210
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,900
This weapon absolutely mashes most enemies and bosses.

211
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,320
Then they just keep going and run all the way around

212
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,740
to the Darkroot Basin entrance to the Undead Parish,

213
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,700
skipping several areas completely.

214
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,280
After beating the gargoyles with a regular old axe,

215
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,520
they use the souls they've gained

216
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,820
to level up enough to equip the halberd,

217
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,820
which they can now just about wield if they two-hand it.

218
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,860
Cairta had precisely figured out

219
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,140
the most efficient way to get the souls they needed

220
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,180
to use this weapon as early as possible.

221
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,360
This means they're able to utterly destroy

222
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,180
the fire bosses that Twilight had to skip completely

223
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,440
because of their weapons.

224
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,820
It's literally faster for Cairta to run through all this

225
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,640
and kill all these bosses

226
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,520
than it is to gather the materials

227
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,280
required to just skip them.

228
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,680
Overall, Cairta saved 15 entire minutes over Twilight

229
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,900
while killing more bosses.

230
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,060
Most of the current record holders in Dark Souls

231
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,880
use this basic strategy now,

232
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,340
but they've saved even more time

233
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,380
by discovering new holes in the game to exploit,

234
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,180
like by messing with the camera system

235
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,520
enough to go out of bounds and enter Sen's Fortress early.

236
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,180
They've improved the strategy so much

237
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,720
that they don't even use the Master Key anymore.

238
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,600
Instead, they use black fire bombs to...

239
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,020
Oh, no.

240
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,800

That doesn't sound like a kind of fun.

It reminds me of the feeling I got when I had my GPS out,

The progression I described is actually only one

281

of several different categories of run through the game,

282

one known as any% no wrong warp.

283
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,060
Like I said before, most of the normal run

284
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,060
is spent killing all the major bosses

285
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,560
to get the Lord Souls to unlock the big door,

286
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,520
which is why it was kind of a big deal

287
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,480
when players figured out a way to teleport right here

288
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,760
on the other side of the door without having to open it.

289
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,600
The game's DLC added an arena

290
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,480
where players could fight each other online.

291
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,300

After beating Artorias,

293
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,480
who incidentally was my favorite boss fight

294
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,940
in the series until Bloodborne's DLC came out,

295
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,640
you gain access to the Battle of Stoicism gazebo,

296
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,020
which presumably sounds better in Japanese.

297
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,020
When they join the arena through the gazebo,

298
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,100
players receive a purple coward's crystal,

299
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,400
which they can use to quit a fight

300
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,020
and teleport back to the entrance.

301
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,180
It does this by telling the game to move you

302
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,140
to a certain map and position,

303
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,360
the map being the main DLC area,

304
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,700
and the position being the entrance to the arena.

305
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,120
Now, there are other items in the game

306
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,200
which work similarly,

307
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,440
like the Homeward Bonio or the Dark Sign.

308
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,160
They tell the game to take you to the map

309
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,980
where you last rested at a bonfire

310
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,860
and the position of that bonfire.

311
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,200
So let's say you last rested at the bonfire

312
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,400
in front of the big door.

313
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,160
Barring specific circumstances,

314
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,520
using one of these two items will take you back here.

315
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,400
Now, you can't normally use the purple coward's crystal

316
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,360
outside of the arena. It's grayed out.

317
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,900
Trying to use it makes your character

318
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,060
have a panic attack and think about all the times

319
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,020
they said, you too, when a waiter told them

320
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,940
to enjoy their food, but there's a glitch

321
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,560
that allows players to use items

322
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,060
even when they're not intended to

323
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,720
by trying to use it,

324
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,260
switching to an item they can use,

325
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,260
like the Estus flask,

326
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,360
while holding down the Use button still,

327
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,680
running off an edge while toggling weapons,

328
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,560
and pressing the Use button again on an exact frame,

329
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,860
causing the player to drink the item along with the flask,

330
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,180
which uses it even if you're not supposed to be able to.

331
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,440
What a handy item.

332
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,060
You can visit the gazebo whenever you like.

333
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,220
But here's the thing.

334
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,760
Using the crystal in the main game

335
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,480
has a fancy long animation where you can't do anything

336
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,360
as the game fades to a loading screen,

337
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,860
but when you use it this way,

338
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,060
you can still walk around and use items before it fades,

339
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,360
so what if we used another item that teleports us

340
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,820
while this other effect was going off?

341
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,940
Well, to put it simply,

342
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,260
the game gets confused.

343
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,400
It tries to load you to the map of the last used bonfire,

344
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,900
which in our case is the bonfire before the big door,

345
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,120
which we cleverly napped at before coming here,

346
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,740
but the position of the arena entrance.

347
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,740
The arena entrance the game is looking for

348
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,580
doesn't exist in this map, though,

349
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,900
so instead it takes you to the pre-programmed

350
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,700
default position in the level,

351
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,660
and it turns out that the default position for this area

352
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,040
is inside the Kiln of the First Flame,

353
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,820
so now all players need to do to beat the game

354
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,580
is gain access to this bonfire and the DLC battle arenas,

355
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,620
and then they can warp directly to the last area.

356
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,880
Oh, and also they have to perform

357
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,760
an absurdly precise set of inputs

358
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,960
with barely even a frame of lenience.

359
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,620
Seriously, it's really hard getting this footage alone.

360
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,260
Took me, like, 25 minutes,

361
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,180
but if you can execute this consistently,

362
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,540
which speedrunners are really good at learning to do,

363
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,800
this method saves a lot of time.

364
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,080
However, it was decided by the community

365
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,420
to be so different from the other runs,

366
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,120
since you have to both own the DLC

367
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,920
and abuse a pretty major glitch,

368
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,620
that all runs prior to the discovery of this glitch

369
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,760
and after the discovery but which don't use it

370
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,060
should be split off into their own separate category.

371
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,260
At this point, the Dark Souls speedrun community

372
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,060
has split the game into at least 14 different categories

373
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,900
ranging from extra difficult challenges

374
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,300
such as killing all the bosses

375
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,760
or completing the entire game without leveling up

376
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,140
to absurdist challenges like completing the game

377
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,800
after collecting one of every ring item in the game.

378
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,760
The Lord of the Rings run.

379
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
That's a clever name.

380
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,400
This kind of separation of a run

381
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,180
into distinct categories also happened in Bloodborne.

382
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,640
When the game was initially released,

383
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,100
a glitch in some of the architecture

384
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,180
for the game was discovered,

385
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,020
resulting in the player being able to leap off

386
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,600
at an angle from a coffin

387
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,480
and get onto a raised section of wall,

388
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,480
then do an attack at another part of a wall

389
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,480
to clip through,

390
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,320
skipping a whole bunch of the game.

391
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,060
For example, the fight with Ghasgwagni

392
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,680
and leading to the creation of a route

393
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,400
which, supplemented by other tricks,

394
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,900
would eventually only take about 20 minutes,

395
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,480
which is utterly absurd.

396
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,780
However, Bloodborne was pretty heavily patched

397
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,180
after release, making lots of changes and fixes

398
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,400
including that error in the architecture

399
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,900
and also, incidentally, much better load times.

400
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,660
This makes this run impossible to do

401
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,700
on a properly patched version of the game.

402
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,320
It also means the version of the game

403
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,780
you would play today on an online PS4

404
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,320
would be unable to do the fastest speedruns,

405
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,660
which puts you at a pretty major disadvantage.

406
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,400
The solution was for new categories to be created,

407
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,320
so runners could run the original version

408
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,540
of the game if they wanted,

409
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,160
but runners could also compete using the current patch.

410
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,280
The current fastest patched run of the game

411
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,700
is slower by eight minutes,

412
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,160
although, incidentally, because of the massive fixes

413
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,500
to load times, despite the in-game timer

414
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
telling you it's almost eight minutes slower,

415
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,680
it's a minute faster to watch in real time.

416
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,020
Bloodborne was messed up when it came out, wasn't it?

417
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,560
Bloodborne's a really interesting game

418
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,640
to run as well in general for a lot of reasons,

419
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,400
one of them being the beast blood pellet,

420
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,120
which adds a meter filled by dealing

421
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,160
certain types of damage, and the higher the meter,

422
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,860
the more damage the player both deals and receives.

423
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,000
It's a bit risk-reward in normal play,

424
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,620
but it's a godsend for speedrunners,

425
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,660
and in some ways, it makes the game easier

426
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,040
for speedrunners by specifically rewarding fast play.

427
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,420
The diverging any% categories in these games

428
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,120
raises interesting questions about the hobby.

429
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,620
In games with multiple categories,

430
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,000
which one is the real speedrun?

431
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,060
Why are some glitches and tricks permitted and others not?

432
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,140
Shouldn't the goal be to create the fastest singular run

433
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,480
and agree on one standard set of rules

434
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,560
for what the speedrun should be?

435
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,280
And how does one decide when something is allowed

436
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,280
and when something should be a separate category or banned?

437
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,060
Well, it depends on both the game and its community.

438
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,860
A game that's impacted by these questions

439
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,900
in a big way is Mirror's Edge.

440
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,480
Mirror's Edge is a game very close to my heart,

441
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,540
to the point that I've speedrun it before as well.

442
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,280
If I'd bothered to submit the run to speedruns.com,

443
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:39,340
I'd officially be in 201st place.

444
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,260
The thing about Mirror's Edge is it's a game

445
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,840
about moving very quickly.

446
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,460
The player character is very mobile,

447
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,640
has a diverse set of moves across surfaces,

448
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,460
and for picking up speed, and different ways

449
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,740
of jumping onto, off of, and across things.

450
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,840
There are also a lot of little ways the mechanics

451
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,080
can be manipulated to go even faster.

452
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,840
This makes it an ideal speed game.

453
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,380
This runner just executed a trick so quickly

454
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,420
at the beginning that you probably didn't even see it.

455
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,000
Right as they loaded in, they turned to the side

456
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,260
and did a side hop, which immediately gets them

457
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,340
up to top speed.

458
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,800
This is one of my favorite tricks right here.

459
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,300
Normally, this pole, like, you have to slowly

460
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,440
do a balancing act as you walk across it.

461
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,860
You're taking your sweet old time.

462
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,080
Runners have reached the point where they leap onto it

463
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,540
in a straight line and don't fall off,

464
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,120
and then turn and do another jump off of it,

465
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,040
so they never have to do it. It's incredible.

466
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,920
Playing Mirror's Edge as fast as you can,

467
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
and then going online and checking out a speedrun

468
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,300
is a really fun experience.

469
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,220
There are so many nuances and specifics

470
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,300
to the game's level designs and movement mechanics

471
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,600
that it's just a joy to see how much extra speed

472
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,060
can be teased out.

473
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,600
But the game's parkour focus and aesthetic

474
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,400
also poses a question for runners.

475
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,640
What does it mean to speedrun?

476
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,680
What does it mean to speedrun Mirror's Edge?

477
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,440
There's a variety of interesting glitches

478
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,140
available to exploit if you want to beat

479
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,600
Mirror's Edge as fast as possible,

480
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,560
but some of them significantly impact

481
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,980
the way the game is played and what the experience

482
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,280
of watching it is like.

483
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,160
Take, for example, the out-of-bounds glitch,

484
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,280
or OOB.

485
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,540
Plenty of games let you get OOB of the level

486
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,740
and use this to get to places meant to be reached

487
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,500
through slower or harder means.

488
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,280
This can be used very egregiously

489
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,920
to bypass large chunks of several levels,

490
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,380
and this is technically much, much faster

491
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,240
than playing the game the normal way.

492
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,540
But it also runs counter to the sort of principles

493
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,300
that make Mirror's Edge the game you'd want to see speedrun

494
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,720
in the first place, doesn't it?

495
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,680
It's a game all about motion, finesse,

496
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,680
clever use of controls and timing

497
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,260
to skirt along the edge of the proverbial mirror,

498
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,140
not to clip through it and then just win.

499
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,640
Part of the fun of speedrunning is watching a game

500
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,220
being played very skillfully and very quickly,

501
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,600
and some tricks rub up against what some people

502
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,440
would define as skillfully playing the game.

503
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,260
So Mirror's Edge has multiple categories

504
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,460
for the main run through the game,

505
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,000
including Any% and Glitchless.

506
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,800
In Any%, you can be treated to a faster run of the game

507
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,340
using a lot of technical trickery

508
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,300
to run across surfaces in weird and impossible ways,

509
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,220
accelerate far faster than was probably ever intended,

510
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,400
abuse a bizarre mistake in the wall-run kick programming

511
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,180
that allows you to jump on one frame right afterwards

512
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,020
like Faith had a double jump or something,

513
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,020
slide into parts of the world you were never meant to see,

514
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,700
have an LSD trip nightmare as every frame

515
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,280
of Faith's movement is suspended before her eyes,

516
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,040
and climb through moving elevators

517
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,080
to shoot up into darkness.

518
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,460
This run is really interesting and showcases

519
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,300
some amazing tricks and moves,

520
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,760
but it's also maybe not the sort of stuff

521
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,300
it's fun to see specifically in a speedrun

522
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,560
of this type of game.

523
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,480
This is obviously highly subjective, of course,

524
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,260
but the community seems to agree with me, so I win.

525
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,360
In around 2013, they introduced the Glitchless category,

526
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,860
which specifically prohibits using major glitches

527
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,820
that alter the flow of the game in this way.

528
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,940
Glitchless runs don't go out of bounds,

529
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,320
don't abuse the weird extra jump you can get

530
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,400
from kicking off a wall,

531
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
and prohibit a few other specific tricks

532
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,160
that some people might deem against the spirit

533
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,200
of Mirror's Edge.

534
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,660
Glitchless has never and will never be faster than any percent,

535
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,000
but to me, at least, it's even more entertaining to watch.

536
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,660
Runners in this category are navigating

537
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,040
through more of the intended world of Mirror's Edge,

538
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,120
which, for someone who played and really liked the game,

539
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,180
is a way more interesting challenge.

540
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,420
All kinds of segments that are completely avoided

541
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,400
by fairly easy tricks in any percent

542
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,520
have to actually be played and routed properly in Glitchless.

543
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,120
Let's compare just one jump across both categories.

544
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,740
Here's the entrance to the RPA building in the second level.

545
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,240
This jump is one of the first properly tough jumps

546
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,620
in the game. It's a long distance,

547
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,580
but also involves downward traversal.

548
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,420
You have to approach it at speed and jump really late,

549
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,120
but also roll when you land or you get hurt.

550
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,720
Either rolling or taking damage is really slow.

551
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,600
A runner doesn't really want to do either of those things.

552
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,380
In the current Glitchless world record,

553
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,400
the runner Wreck executes an incredibly skillful maneuver

554
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,680
to take full advantage of this rail here,

555
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,520
so they land on the rail instead of the regular ground,

556
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,820
which prevents them having to roll or take damage,

557
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,620
but they also turned in midair and executed a side jump

558
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,400
to immediately get back to top speed when they landed.

559
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,000
This is really, really cool.

560
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,120
It's really difficult to do. I can't do it.

561
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,820
Here's the same part in the current Any% world record

562
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,160
by Philotrax.

563
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,920
Trax abuses the wall kick jump

564
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,960
to effectively fly over this challenging gap,

565
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,140
landing safely on some of the game's trademark

566
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,520
white plant furniture stuff.

567
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,060
Extrapolating tricks like this across a full game run

568
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,020
makes for two very different and uniquely interesting paths

569
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,260
through the game to watch.

570
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,480
Earlier, I asked the question of which category

571
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,280
should be considered the real speedrunner of the game,

572
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,060
but I don't think there's an objective answer,

573
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,360
at least for most games.

574
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,700
Even in Bloodborne's case,

575
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,780
using bugs that were patched out later,

576
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,240
this is a version of Bloodborne that was released,

577
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,420
and it beats the game as fast as possible,

578
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,460
and in Mirror's Edge, maybe clipping through walls

579
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,580
should be seen as just as valid a strategy as not doing so,

580
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,800
but everyone gets to decide for themselves

581
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,000
how to figure out what a speedrun needs to be,

582
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,640
and usually there's gonna be enough people

583
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,520
who feel that way that it's gonna end up

584
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,720
as a speedrun category,

585
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,220
and the Mirror's Edge community has come up

586
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,440
with quite a lot of categories over the years.

587
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,720
I've only talked about one of the extra ones so far.

588
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,400
There's also Any% in bounds,

589
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,680
which specifically avoids out-of-bounds glitches

590
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,320
if you think going oob is wrong

591
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,780
and are okay with the more advanced

592
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,440
wall kick jump tricks and stuff.

593
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,880
There's much more healthy competition

594
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,440
when there are multiple agreed sets of rules to choose from.

595
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,680
I imagine if there had only been one ruling

596
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,100
for how to speedrun Mirror's Edge,

597
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,520
it would be a lot less satisfying for a lot of runners

598
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,480
and wouldn't have seen quite as many runners

599
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,860
come and go over the years.

600
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,820
One runner eventually got a job at DICE

601
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,240
and worked on the sequel,

602
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,900
which apparently some people even played,

603
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,740
so that's nice.

604
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,160
Speedrunning is a completely arbitrary challenge,

605
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,160
one that most developers never even think to account for,

606
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,340
so it's totally fine to have multiple ways

607
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,740
of categorizing runs,

608
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,700
different kinds of challenge and so on

609
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,540
because some types of run are more interesting than others

610
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,700
and none are really any more valid

611
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,340
because they're all ultimately just silly things

612
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,880
some people do for the sake of fun and competition.

613
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,260
I think it's cool that even what it means

614
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,300
to play a game quickly can be up for discussion sometimes.

615
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,920
My favorite type of Mirror's Edge run

616
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,100
is the 69 stars category, which is very nice.

617
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,940
It's the category for running through all the game's

618
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,480
optional time trials in one sitting

619
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,760
and getting all the stars.

620
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,860
It really embodies the things I enjoy the most

621
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,280
about the Glitchless speedrun.

622
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,820
It's just great performances utilizing mechanics

623
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,120
mostly intended by the game's developers.

624
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,960
Runners do awesome stuff like ignore the game's

625
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,620
in-built run-ups for big jumps

626
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,580
and instead make really precise movement over them

627
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,660
to jump manually at the edge and make it further and faster.

628
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,660
It's awesome.

629
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,040
The current number one record is by Voatiem?

630
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,680
Voatiem? I'm not sure,

631
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,000
who got in just a teeny smidge over 21 minutes

632
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,080
due to a couple of minor mistakes.

633
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,540
You're kidding, right?

634
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,460
Someone is going to beat 21 minutes in this category,

635
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,960
and I can't wait. It's gonna be awesome.

636
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,960
And because Mirror's Edge seems to inspire

637
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,840
utter obsession in its fans, myself included,

638
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,060
speedrun.com also has a category extension leaderboard

639
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,600
for even more weirder and specific runs.

640
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,220
Uh, speedrun.com slash memeem.

641
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,680
Heh heh. It's pretty great.

642
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,440
There's a true Glitchless category here

643
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,140
for weirdo purists like me who just want to see

644
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,780
the actual game played near perfectly.

645
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
There's categories that often only even have

646
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,480
one or two submitters where, like,

647
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,400
runs where one runner uses the mouse

648
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,780
and another uses the keyboard

649
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,520
or where two runners each use half of one controller.

650
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,280
Honestly, this is just getting silly now.

651
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,860
What about a New Game Plus category

652
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,240
where players chapter select the last segment

653
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,000
and beat it in 13 seconds

654
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
and people are genuinely down to counting milliseconds

655
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,120
to figure out who was actually the fastest?

656
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,840
What about RBO, reverse boss order,

657
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,420
where runners chapter select to each boss in the game

658
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,240
in reverse order and time beating each of them?

659
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,860
What about reverse RBO, where they do RBO backwards?

660
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,280
Why would you do it like that?

661
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,080
That's just boss. Why is it called that?

662
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,660
How about Any% x 25,

663
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,820
where one runner has decided to run the game

664
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,080
25 times in a row,

665
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,660
which took over 17 hours

666
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,720
and which they openly declare no one will ever beat?

667
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,720
What the fuck are your sidesteps right now?

668
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,600
I told you I'm not even paying attention anymore.

669
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,540
Why would you do this, Hekigan?

670
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,460
Was your 60-millisecond lead in New Game Plus

671
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,000
not enough anymore? Did you need something stronger?

672
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,800
What are you doing to yourself?

673
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,100
This is also where the segmented speedrun lives

674
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,860
with various runners including the aforementioned Hekigan,

675
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,640
Votime, Votime,

676
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,600
Philotrax, and Wreck all contributing small segments

677
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,100
to produce an absolutely incredible run.

678
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,940
It's a fabulous expression of a community's commitment

679
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,660
to beating a game as fast as possible

680
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,620
and their years of developing skills

681
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,320
and learning more and more about how the game works.

682
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,960
I love it. Link in the description.

683
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,000
Just give it a look. It's just great.

684
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,040
There's a tremendous sense of community to speedrunning.

685
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,200
People share information and discoveries,

686
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,700
discuss theories together,

687
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,300
and all the tricks used in runs are by their nature

688
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,380
immediately available for further analysis

689
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,660
and use in other runs.

690
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,760
I remember, like, way back in the day,

691
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,720
like, in 2014, like, I was in a Skype call

692
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,880
with some other SMS runners.

693
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,760
We were watching Tobu do some runs,

694
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,180
and we've never seen that spin jump before,

695
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,480
and it just, like, it blew our minds.

696
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,400
We're like, okay, I'm never gonna go for that,

697
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,680
and that was just, like, commonplace,

698
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,120
so that just goes to show, like,

699
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,420
how far this game has come.

700
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,080
Yeah. Speedrunning is an almost

701
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,080
inherently collectivist activity in this sense.

702
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,160
While there is competition to be the best

703
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,540
and take or hold the record,

704
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,960
almost no record holder has completely earned

705
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,640
that position all on their own.

706
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,100
The best runs owe a debt to the discoveries

707
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,420
and ideas contributed by previous runners.

708
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,020
The best run is often representative

709
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,840
of many people's contributions

710
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,800
alongside the runner's own skill, of course.

711
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,900
In a sense, speedruns are always a group effort.

712
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,040
It's really not surprising that awesome charity events

713
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,380
like GDQ have emerged from this space.

714
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,120
It's just a grander scaled version

715
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,680
of what speedrunning had kind of always been.

716
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,800
You can't copyright a technique or strategy

717
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,640
for beating a video game quickly.

718
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,760
There are no patents in speedrunning.

719
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,260
Proving that you got a time

720
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,640
or even getting the fastest time

721
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,560
isn't just an achievement or personal victory.

722
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,260
It's also automatically a contribution

723
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,360
to the greater community effort,

724
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,900
and that's radical.

725
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,180
But speedrunning isn't always about socialism.

726
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:05,180
Sometimes it's about beating video games very quickly.

727
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,640
Part three, in-depth investigation.

728
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,600
Actually, no, I've thought of a better title for this one.

729
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,900
Donkey Kong.

730
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,440
Ah!

731
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,440
["DONKEY KONG 64 THEME"]

732
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,700
["DONKEY KONG 64 THEME"]

733
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,940
Donkey Kong 64 is a game by Rareware

734
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,280
for the Nintendo 64.

735
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,400
Oh, you don't need to know that part.

736
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,700
It's very much the embodiment of the stereotypes

737
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,560
about Rare's games for the time period.

738
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,560
Large levels full of hundreds of different specific items

739
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,720
you have to collect to unlock more things to collect.

740
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,860
For instance, each level has 500 bananas,

741
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,940
but what makes it particularly troublesome

742
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,860
is that some items are specifically

743
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,260
for one of the five characters you play.

744
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,220
To collect enough stuff to progress,

745
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,020
you'd have to traverse the same environments

746
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,180
over and over with every character,

747
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,980
and the levels were often really big.

748
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,640
At the time, it made the game feel big

749
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,520
and like a cool, sprawling adventure

750
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,440
that lasted a long time and had a lot of chances

751
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,400
to see how each character can progress

752
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,480
through the same environment

753
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,440
using their own skills and abilities.

754
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,560
That's because I was seven years old.

755
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,860
["BOOM"]

756
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,480
Now it just feels like time-consuming busywork.

757
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,320
Lots of this was completely unnecessary

758
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,940
from a design standpoint, too.

759
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,820
You could design a game with collectibles

760
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,060
only one character could reach in the first place

761
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,020
instead of most of the time just having them

762
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,560
hanging out there, faded out,

763
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,780
reminding you you're gonna have to come back here again

764
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,900
with another character,

765
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,100
and running back to that barrel that changes characters

766
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,600
because you need to pick something else up is awful.

767
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,640
Running back to previously completed levels

768
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,020
because you finally have the characters you needed

769
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,360
to pick up those bananas you'd already walked past

770
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,680
eight times is a more painful tragedy

771
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,400
than Titus Andronicus.

772
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,400
I would cut off my hand and send it to Emperor Saturninus

773
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,320
if it meant I could have just picked that banana up

774
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,680
four hours ago with Daddy Kong instead of Yankle Kong.

775
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,940
I can feel my cells dividing

776
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,360
as my precious existence rushes toward its finite end

777
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,620
with nothing in the world to beguile my sorrow

778
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,660
but the sweet siren song of,

779
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,820
ooh, banana.

780
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,900
Donkey Kong 64 is an existential crisis

781
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,580
in the form of a video game cartridge.

782
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,860
I'm actually more aware of the futility of my existence

783
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,240
after trying to go back and play this.

784
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,940
Now, I could sit you down and explain the progression

785
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,040
of the Donkey Kong 64 Any% run to you

786
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,740
like it was the back of my hand,

787
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,540
but firstly, there's already a video

788
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,700
by Summoning Salt out there doing just that,

789
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,320
and that video's better than anything I could do,

790
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,860
so you should just go check that one out,

791
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,320
and secondly, well, to be honest,

792
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,240
I've seen a lot of speedruns at this point,

793
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,860
and I'm kind of used to it, you know?

794
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,360
Oh, yeah, Donkey Kong 64,

795
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,580
a game I beat in 72 hours as a kid

796
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,900
being beaten by a professional in 30 minutes.

797
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,580
Yeah, sure, that's impressive.

798
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:46,860
To a clown at the circus, I need something stronger.

799
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,820
I've built up a tolerance to this stuff.

800
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,360
We need to go deeper and darker.

801
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,020
We need to talk about the players who will settle

802
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,320
for nothing more than total conquest,

803
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,560
and no, I'm not talking about

804
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,560
Donkey Kong Country 2 Diddy's Kong Quest.

805
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,020
You get it's a pun.

806
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:07,020
No, I'm talking about the Donkey Kong 64 100% speedrun.

807
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,600
Yeah.

808
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,860
Well, technically, it's the 101% speedrun

809
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,900
because Rareware were pretty good

810
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,100
at ironically recognizing that they'd put

811
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,340
way too many collectibles in their goddamn game.

812
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,420
To achieve 101% completion,

813
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,560
players must collect the Nintendo coin,

814
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,640
the Rareware coin, all eight keys,

815
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,960
all ten battle crowns, all 20 fairies,

816
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,420
all 201 golden bananas,

817
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,260
and all 40 banana medals,

818
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,880
each of which is awarded for collecting

819
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,520
75 of a Kong's bananas in a level

820
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:38,640
for a total of 3,000 bananas.

821
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,220
Hey, but sometimes they come in little bunches of five.

822
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,340
Thanks, Donkey Kong.

823
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,420
The rules list for this run on speedrun.com

824
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,240
actually includes the stipulation

825
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,240
that to submit runs for this category,

826
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,820
you must hate yourself.

827
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,420
Runners in this category endure such supreme torments

828
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,080
that one of them fucking streamed themselves

829
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,460
breaking their cartridge to make sure it was over.

830
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,000
This is my DK cart.

831
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,660
Fun fact.

832
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,240
Did you know that the PAL version

833
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,620
of the Donkey Kong 64 cartridge was gray,

834
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,320
but the US retail version was banana yellow?

835
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,860
Heh, you learn something new every day.

836
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,820
This run is challenging in far more ways

837
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,960
than the traditional run.

838
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
In that run, your objective is fairly simple.

839
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,540
Find the fastest way to the end,

840
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,620
whatever that way may be,

841
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,200
abusing cutscene glitches,

842
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,920
level skips, moon jumps, et cetera,

843
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,120
effectively ending up with runs

844
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,860
where you do as little as possible.

845
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,460
This run's core is having to actually do

846
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,120
everything the game asks of you,

847
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,920
planning the most efficient route possible

848
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,960
through all of it,

849
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,160
and then somehow actually doing it all

850
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,660
precisely and quickly,

851
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,860
but with hundreds of golden bananas to collect,

852
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,080
and some of these can be very challenging,

853
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,500
and thousands of bananas!

854
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,000
Executing on all of this in succession

855
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,040
introduces a new kind of test for these runners,

856
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,200
resilience.

857
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,460
Paradoxically, as with the Beast Blood pellet,

858
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,040
when quicker strategies are found,

859
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,280
often that makes the game easier to beat

860
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,040
because the length of time you have to focus

861
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,860
on execution has gotten shorter.

862
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,320
You only have to pull off 30 minutes of good stuff

863
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,580
to beat the Any% run in 30 minutes.

864
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,500
If something takes around five hours to beat,

865
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,460
that's five hours of time to make mistakes in.

866
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,580
Five hours to get tired or lose focus

867
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,380
or slip from your intended most efficient path.

868
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:17,200
These runs are essentially torture,

869
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,960
and they're amazing.

870
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,280
There's a three-year-old run by German runner 360 Chris M.

871
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,040
that took 19 hours and 53 minutes.

872
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,820
The best part of this run is it has face cam.

873
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:34,160
You can watch in real time as the sun sets and rises,

874
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,780
and he gets ever closer to making it to the end.

875
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,240
He no-sells it, too.

876
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,780
Like, by the end, he still doesn't seem that tired.

877
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,900
It's kind of awesome.

878
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,100
Despite there being plenty of runs

879
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,940
that are way, way more optimized,

880
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,440
the better runs push the five-and-a-half-hours mark,

881
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,780
there's something very special about runs like this one

882
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,360
where they probably know their planned route

883
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,020
is gonna take them a full day,

884
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,280
but they sit down and do it.

885
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,780
I kind of love runs like this just for their sheer dedication

886
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,940
regardless of how efficient they are.

887
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,480
Yeah!

888
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,940
Whoo!

889
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,440
Sub 20, boys!

890
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,640
PB, boys. I PB'd by, uh,

891
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,340
four hours and six minutes.

892
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,340
Pretty solid.

893
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,560
Wait, his last attempt took nearly 25 hou—

894
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,480
Holy shi—

895
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,260
The various runs of this game have led players

896
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,940
to look very closely at almost every aspect,

897
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,020
even going so far as using hacking software

898
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,940
to analyze the code in detail,

899
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,680
looking for anything that can be exploited

900
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,860
to make runs faster.

901
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,680
DK64 has been investigated in a level of detail

902
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,980
greater than the developers could have ever intended

903
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,300
or expected, and that's led to new discoveries

904
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,420
but also to something really cool.

905
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,840
Enter Isotarge.

906
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,220
Isotarge is a runner with a really respectable time

907
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,380
in the any% category,

908
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,260
but it's also the longest-standing run

909
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,720
in the top ten by far.

910
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,460
In fact, it was the world record for six months back in 2015.

911
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,800
Isotarge has made a lot of contributions to the community,

912
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,960
including spending a lot of time digging around

913
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,080
inside the game's code, finding new glitches

914
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,960
and holes in world geometry and so on,

915
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,220
anything that could be exploited to get better runs.

916
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,080
Isotarge has found a lot of cool stuff in the game,

917
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,460
including this image of a Rareware employee's face

918
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,960
hidden inside the game's files,

919
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,780
which looks like it's been edited in a Game Boy Camera,

920
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,780
but they've also found stuff like this.

921
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,460
Out-of-bounds collectibles.

922
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,700
It's common for developers to leave items and objects

923
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,960
in places players can't get to in the game proper

924
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,500
and not worry about removing them,

925
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,080
like this coin hidden in a wall in Mario 64

926
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,960
that someone actually figured out how to get,

927
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,960
and since these items exist well outside

928
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,240
the intended scope of the game,

929
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,660
runs don't usually consider them collectibles

930
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,580
as part of a run.

931
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,040
They're more cool oddities

932
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,160
that shouldn't really be considered as game objects

933
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,200
to be collected.

934
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,980
But what if an item was absolutely collectible

935
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,280
without any glitches,

936
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,160
but no one had found it before?

937
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,820
One day when messing around in the game's code

938
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,940
looking for flags for collectible objects,

939
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,360
Isotarge found a banana coin

940
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,620
that hadn't been accounted for in the level Fungi Forest.

941
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,580
Banana coins in DK64 are used to buy items and upgrades,

942
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,120
and because this is Donkey Kong 64,

943
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,740
there are six different kinds of banana coin.

944
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,160
There's one color for each character,

945
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,540
but also a multicolored one,

946
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,940
which is usually hard to find

947
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,980
and gives five coins to every character

948
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,180
as soon as it's collected.

949
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,980
There's only 15 of them in the game,

950
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,860
one in each level except Angry Aztec,

951
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,140
which has two, and seven in the hub world of DK Isles.

952
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,260
This new coin wasn't any of the ones

953
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,940
that had been collected before,

954
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,680
but unlike the other items,

955
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,720
this one wasn't out of bounds.

956
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,640
It was hidden in a place no one had ever thought to check,

957
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,940
hidden in the tall grass in the level,

958
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,140
right about hee- no, wait, sorry,

959
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,860
right about...

960
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,680
here.

961
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,940
And there it is.

962
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,220
As far as I can tell,

963
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:33,340
this coin isn't mentioned anywhere on the Internet

964
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,340
prior to its discovery by Isotarge in the game's code,

965
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,640
and it's not in any strategy guide

966
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,840
from the time period I can get my hands on.

967
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,760
It's not really known whether the developers

968
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,140
put this coin here intentionally,

969
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,720
or forgot to remove it,

970
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,880
or why they thought to give so little indication it was there.

971
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,180
It's easy to see why it was missed for so long.

972
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,680
Now, a cool kicker to this story

973
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,800
would be that it invalidated all the 101% runs,

974
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,880
or it turned out that there are now technically

975
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,760
102% runs or something,

976
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,420
but banana coins aren't counted for percentages

977
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,500
on the game's menu screen,

978
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,340
and the total amount of coins you can get

979
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,000
isn't even listed in the game anywhere.

980
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,960
The 101% run doesn't even include all of the bananas

981
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,000
because the game only counts banana medals

982
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,760
towards completion, so they don't even get

983
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,420
all the bananas in the runs where you get 101% completion,

984
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,580
which is a bit of a disappointment, really.

985
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,500
You should get them all next time.

986
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,040
To amuse me.

987
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,040
Here's the SGDQ run in 2017,

988
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,420
soon after the coin was discovered,

989
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,080
where they just stopped to get it for kicks.

990
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,580
Lo and behold, it is...

991
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,120
the Rainbow Coin!

992
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,360
Yeah.

993
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,080
Uh, that Rainbow Coin has been hidden

994
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,860
basically since the game came out,

995
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,660
so, uh, over 16 years, right?

996
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,660
It's not technically a major discovery,

997
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,580
and it changes nothing about how the game is run

998
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,620
in the main categories,

999
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,920
outside of what are essentially

1000
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,580
ultra-masochistic jokes that people only really do

1001
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,080
just to be one of the two people who ever did it at all,

1002
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,580
but it's still a really, really cool discovery.

1003
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,420
Something was hidden just out of plain sight,

1004
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,580
even to the people who would make a point

1005
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,580
of collecting everything in the game

1006
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,580
for 17 years.

1007
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,080
What's fun about the Banana Coin

1008
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,920
is that it's kind of an abstract example

1009
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,920
of how awesome speedrunning communities are

1010
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,080
for deconstructing and examining games.

1011
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,080
Like, people are so dedicated

1012
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,080
to coming to an understanding of a game,

1013
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,080
they're uncovering things which probably would've remained

1014
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,580
hidden forever otherwise.

1015
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,080
And that's just neat, no matter how you peel it.

1016
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,580
Oh, God, did I just say...

1017
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,580
Why is speedrunning awesome?

1018
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,580
Because people are awesome.

1019
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,580
Because watching someone try something

1020
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,580
over and over again, getting better and better,

1021
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,580
and learning new secrets and strategies

1022
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,580
in order to be the best at something,

1023
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,080
sometimes for years,

1024
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,080
is compelling and fascinating and human

1025
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,580
in a way that no other form of media,

1026
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:45,580
no television show could ever adequately replicate,

1027
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,080
because a real human person

1028
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,080
is sitting right there and doing it.

1029
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,080
I opened this video using clips

1030
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,580
from an attempt to finish Zelda Ocarina of Time

1031
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,580
in the Any% category by skater82297.

1032
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,580
This video in particular is one of my favorites.

1033
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,080
This guy's been hammering away at Zelda Ocarina of Time

1034
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,580
since at least 2014,

1035
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,580
shaving seconds, fractions of seconds,

1036
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,080
off of his personal best.

1037
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,580
Here's a cool trick. On speedrun.com,

1038
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,080
you can actually click to see all of the obsoleted runs,

1039
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,580
runs that a runner has themselves gone on to supersede.

1040
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,580
If you turn that on,

1041
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,580
this guy basically is the top 20 fastest runs of Zelda

1042
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,080
of all time.

1043
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,580
But he didn't have number one.

1044
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,080
Someone else was faster than him.

1045
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,080
So he just kept going and going.

1046
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,580
And you can see all of his runs.

1047
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,080
And live on his channel,

1048
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,080
you could have seen all of the many, many attempts

1049
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,580
that went into even getting those runs.

1050
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,580
And in this run, you see him get annoyed

1051
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,080
by the tiniest things.

1052
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,080
Goma doesn't activate for about a second longer

1053
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,580
than he thinks it should,

1054
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,580
and it just frustrates the hell out of him.

1055
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,580
Dude.

1056
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,580
Fuck you!

1057
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,580
Fuck you!

1058
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,080
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1059
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,080
Fuck you.

1060
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,580
No. Fucking shit, dude.

1061
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,080
Fuck off.

1062
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,580
I'm mad. Now fuck off.

1063
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,080
He's angry about this boss not spawning fast enough,

1064
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,580
even though he can kill it in seconds flat.

1065
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,080
That was bullshit, dude.

1066
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,080
That was utter shit.

1067
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,580
That was bullshit.

1068
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,580
A random onlooker would wonder why someone did this to themselves,

1069
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,080
did something over and over,

1070
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,080
even though it clearly wasn't any fun for them.

1071
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,080
But then, they get deeper and deeper into the run.

1072
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:22,580
And they start to realize that this might be the one.

1073
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,080
The tone changes.

1074
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,080
Things get quiet.

1075
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,080
This might be happening.

1076
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,080
Is it happening?

1077
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:40,080
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1078
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,080
Oh, my God.

1079
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,080
Towards the end, he can barely even control his breathing.

1080
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,080
He's panicking. He's anxious.

1081
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:50,080
But he knows that if he can just execute on the ideas

1082
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,080
that he's been developing for years,

1083
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,080
this might be it.

1084
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,580
Oh, my God, dude!

1085
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,080
Oh, my fucking God!

1086
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,080
Oh!

1087
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,080
Okay. Okay.

1088
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,080
Yes, dude!

1089
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,080
Fucking yes!

1090
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,080
Yes!

1091
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,080
Oh, my God!

1092
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,080
Yes!

1093
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,080
Yes!

1094
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,080
Yes, dude!

1095
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,080
Oh, my God!

1096
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,080
Yes!

1097
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,080
Oh, my God!

1098
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,080
Oh, my God, dude!

1099
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:30,080
This run is currently the fastest run anyone has ever done

1100
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,080
of The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.

1101
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,080
And then, in that moment,

1102
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:38,080
in that period of being utterly overjoyed at this achievement,

1103
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,080
it becomes clear why people do this.

1104
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,080
And what you can get from this that you can't get anywhere else.

1105
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,080
It's a story.

1106
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,080
Not something written or directed by someone.

1107
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,080
A real human story.

1108
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,080
It's a story of perseverance and triumph.

1109
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:57,080
And it's derived from something so small and silly-seeming,

1110
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,080
but that only makes it more beautiful in a way.

1111
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,080
And the best part is, the story's not over.

1112
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:08,080
There's almost always more to learn about how to run any given game.

1113
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,080
Always someone trying to beat the record.

1114
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,080
And anyone can be a part of that.

1115
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:17,080
Or, at the very least, anyone can be there to watch it happen.

1116
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,080
This is probably why so many people tune in to events like GDQ

1117
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,080
and even donate money to support work that helps keep people alive

1118
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,080
so they can spend time with the people they love.

1119
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,080
Or, you know, watching speedruns.

1120
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,080
Hmm.

1121
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,080
Hmm.

1122
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:42,080
Okay, I have to admit, I told a bit of a porky pie earlier.

1123
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,080
That's Cockney rhyming slang for lie,

1124
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,080
which I clearly know, obvious Cockney, that I am.

1125
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:52,080
I never actually beat Donkey Kong 64 as a kid.

1126
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,080
I played it for 72 hours, and then I couldn't beat

1127
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,080
the Donkey Kong arcade part near the end,

1128
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,080
which you need to do to unlock the final boss fight.

1129
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:04,080
So I had 72 hours of play and nothing to show for it.

1130
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,080
And, frankly, that's piss.

1131
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:11,080
So to finally put this little fucker to rest,

1132
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,080
I'm gonna stream it.

1133
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,080
I'm gonna start the game again,

1134
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,080
and I'm gonna get absolutely everything in that game,

1135
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,080
including the rainbow coin just to bring everything full circle,

1136
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,080
and I'm gonna get absolutely everything, all the bananas,

1137
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,080
not the minimum required for 101% completion,

1138
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,080
and I'm not gonna stop until it's done.

1139
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:31,080
I might, I will, fall asleep in my chair.

1140
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,080
I'm not that resilient, although it is currently,

1141
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,080
no joke, 2.41 a.m.

1142
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,080
Hope you can see that.

1143
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,080
So I might do okay, but I should probably rig it up

1144
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,080
so that if anyone donates, an air horn will go off

1145
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,080
and wake me up. Let's just torture me

1146
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,080
for other people's enjoyment.

1147
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,080
And all the donations will go to charity.

1148
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,080
So finally some good can come out of Donkey Kong 64,

1149
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,080
because certainly no fun has come out of it.

1150
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,080
Anyway, thanks for watching this video.

1151
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,080
Um, it's really just a love letter to the speedrunning community

1152
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,080
because I just find it's been such a fulfilling part of my life,

1153
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,080
and it looks like a lot of other people's.

1154
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,080
A lot of gaming spaces can be pretty clicky at times,

1155
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,080
and I think speedrunning has generally avoided that

1156
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,080
with a lot of sort of close-knit but quite friendly communities.

1157
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,080
A lot of people were really forthcoming with information

1158
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,080
when I was doing research for this video,

1159
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,080
and that was just really awesome, and I just think it's cool

1160
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,080
how people can share the things they enjoy

1161
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,080
and learn more about stuff and occasionally raise

1162
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,080
quite a lot of money for some really good causes.

1163
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,080
I just think the whole thing is so fun and kind

1164
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,080
in a way that you don't see very often.

1165
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,080
So, yeah, just thought it was nice.

1166
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,080
Probably could have thought of a clever ending to this video,

1167
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,080
but...

1168
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,080
Uh...
