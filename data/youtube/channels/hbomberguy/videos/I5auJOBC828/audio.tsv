0	11420	By now you probably know what a speedrun is already.
11420	14340	It's where players commit to beating a game as fast as possible.
14340	16340	On the surface, it's a bit silly.
16340	20060	People sitting down with one game, playing it over and over,
20060	23300	dedicating immense time and effort to learning its ins and outs
23300	27260	and learning skills that probably aren't all that helpful anywhere else.
27260	31040	And yet, somehow, the experience of taking part in
31040	33800	or even watching someone try to speedrun a game
33800	37300	is exhilarating and amazing and just fun,
37300	40640	and speedruns of some games frequently get millions of views.
40640	43060	This clearly matters to a lot of people,
43060	44800	so there's probably a reason why,
44800	48100	and I was having trouble scratching out the reasons why,
48100	52400	so I arrived at the obvious solution of writing a YouTube video about it.
52400	54240	Speedrunning is really fun to watch,
54240	56940	and stories about speedrunning are consistently fascinating,
56960	59420	and I really want to talk about why,
59420	61800	and no one's managed to stop me so far.
61800	65340	["Souls"]
65340	69060	It's generally accepted that the Souls series is pretty difficult,
69060	70940	and they are, at least for beginners,
70940	75020	because the games are generally not great at teaching you how to really grasp playing them.
75020	76940	I've heard there's already a video out there somewhere
76940	79940	that drones on and on for way too long trying to explain this,
79940	81020	so we'll ignore that here.
81020	84240	This difficulty is the prime reason why speedruns of games in this series
84240	85820	are so entertaining to watch.
85840	87500	Owing to the games' inaccessibility
87500	90800	and the time investment required to get good, as it were,
90800	93680	watching someone blast through them is just plain fun.
93680	96600	What's interesting in a more in-depth way about speedruns, though,
96600	98680	is seeing how they develop over time,
98680	101440	and Dark Souls is a perfect example of why.
101440	102860	Part 1.
102860	104600	Development.
104600	107280	The earliest speedrun on record at speedruns.com,
107280	109660	a fantastic resource, by the way, for Dark Souls,
109660	111400	is by Japanese runner Twilight.
111400	114900	In 2011, a lot less was known about how Dark Souls really ticked,
114900	116740	and there was yet to be much of a community
116740	119940	to help pick away at all the possible fastest approaches to the game,
119940	123240	so Twilight's run consists largely of combining general tricks
123240	126780	that were widely known early on for making the game easier or faster.
126780	130060	For example, in Dark Souls, there are multiple different starting classes
130060	132400	with their own stats, starting items, and abilities.
132400	134560	While some do have unique advantages,
134560	137900	the Pyromancer starts with the ability to throw fireballs,
137900	140480	something none of the others can access for quite a while,
140480	143100	so it's usually the one recommended to new players
143100	144880	because if they're having trouble fighting,
144880	146840	they can throw fire on people.
146840	149300	I mean, come on. So Twilight picks them.
149300	151800	It's not really a surprise. It's kind of the obvious choice
151800	153640	if you were to think about how to speedrun this game
153640	155020	if you played it a few times.
155020	157020	The next big choice is the starting gift.
157020	159260	Players can choose something extra to start the game with
159260	160880	from a list at character creation.
160880	163980	Normally in Dark Souls, early on to continue deeper into the game,
163980	166220	players have to go through a fairly tough area,
166220	169420	fight a difficult boss to get a key to another difficult area,
169420	171420	then fight another boss there to progress through
171460	173660	to another difficult area called Blighttown,
173660	175080	which leads down to another boss,
175080	176580	which is guarding a bell you need to ring
176580	177780	to progress the game,
177780	180280	but for, uh, reasons,
180280	182500	the developers made one of the starting items
182500	184200	players can choose from a key
184200	186240	that unlocks a gate in the starting area,
186240	188160	which skips past two of those bosses
188160	190620	right into the lower part of Blighttown,
190620	192880	so it's pretty clear what item a speedrunner
192880	194280	would want to start with here.
194280	196880	It's just the most obviously fast and helpful choice.
196880	198200	I mean, look at the other ones.
198200	200380	Binoculars, a rubbish ring,
200380	202740	a n-n-a more rubbish ring,
202740	205280	pendant, trinket, no effect,
205280	206780	black firebombs?
206780	208780	What a garbage option.
208780	210700	Why would anyone ever pick that?
210700	212120	I don't know. I guess they're pretty good.
212120	215500	I mean, they're more deadly than STD bomb.
215500	217920	What? Another initially obvious trick for speedrunning
217920	219960	involves this drake that turns up early on
219960	221120	and hangs out up here.
221120	222540	Getting a decent weapon in this game
222540	223780	usually takes some time,
223780	225740	but once you get to this big scary boy,
225740	228160	one recommended way for new players to get an advantage
228160	230740	so they don't have too hard a time starting out
230740	233240	is to sit in a safe place and spam arrows at its tail
233240	235480	until it breaks off, giving you this sword.
235480	237940	The drake sword deals a ridiculous amount of damage
237940	239820	for the place in the game where you can get it.
239820	242200	It drops off in its usefulness quite quickly,
242200	243240	but for early players,
243240	245120	it's just a fantastic weapon to pick up,
245120	246860	but instead of wasting time and arrows,
246860	248280	of which they had neither,
248280	250360	Twilight simply dodged behind it
250360	252440	when it jumped down and cut its tail off
252440	253980	and then ran to the next area.
253980	256160	This is one of the most cathartic things
256160	257520	you can see in a speedrun.
257600	260060	You know, you spend a bunch of time dying to its fire
260060	261220	or getting kicked to death,
261220	264020	and then you see someone else just steal its tail
264020	265380	and run away with it
265380	267380	and proceed to beat people to death with it
267380	268680	for the rest of the game.
268680	269520	It's great.
269520	270680	A lot of Twilight's early run
270680	273100	consists of playing the game the way one normally would,
273100	275840	but just doing more running and ignoring enemies.
275840	279060	Early runs like this play the game basically as normal,
279060	280720	but very quickly and precisely
280720	283480	doing the most obviously easy and fast moves.
283480	285300	Twilight burns all the remaining bosses
285300	286600	with their hot, hot hands
286600	287800	and grabs enough humanity
287800	289800	that they can feed it to the Daughter of Chaos
289800	292800	and open a shortcut past all the major fire-based bosses,
292800	295060	which obviously would take a long time to fight
295060	296880	when all your weapons are fire.
296880	300560	Have you ever tried actually fighting fire with fire?
300560	301840	I'm on a watch list now.
301840	304500	After a lot of running past things and killing bosses,
304500	305960	they gather the four Lord Souls
305960	307420	required to open the big door
307420	309140	to the remnants of Great Uncle Gwynn's
309140	311000	mega weekend barbecue and kill him
311000	313460	so someone can finally call the fire department,
313460	317280	and they do it in an hour and 26 minutes in in-game time.
317280	321160	This is an ungodly fast speed to finish Dark Souls,
321160	323500	but there was a lot of improvement to make.
323500	325340	What I think is interesting about the early runs
325340	327540	through the game is that they weren't just improving
327540	329500	on execution of the same route
329500	331660	or finding slightly more improved paths,
331660	334500	but the nature of the entire route from the very start
334500	335920	was still up for debate.
335920	337280	Nothing was set in stone,
337280	340160	even what type of character you chose to play as,
340160	342620	and it wasn't clear what the fastest way would really be,
342660	344740	and that's a really fun experimental period
344740	346240	in the development of a speed run.
346240	348200	This is where Dark Souls runs excel
348200	349820	in the spectatorship aspect.
349820	352400	In lots of other games, you don't have as much choice
352400	355280	or freedom in where to go or what sort of character to play
355280	356700	or what weapon to use.
356700	359120	There are so many other paths or decisions
359120	360940	that could have been made in a Souls game
360940	364020	that the next run threatens to be completely different,
364020	365660	and, well, it was.
365660	367940	The next world record was set three months later
367940	370620	and has gone on to be the longest standing world record,
370660	372660	lasting 13 months.
372660	375240	It was set by another Japanese runner, Keita.
375240	376480	I hope I'm pronouncing that properly.
376480	379740	Ke, and then it's a neon gate, so Keita.
379740	380620	KEITA.
380620	382280	All right, what's really fun about this run
382280	385120	was it diverged from Twilight's path immediately.
385120	387540	Not only do they start the game with a different class
387540	388660	right out of the gate,
388660	390400	but once they make it to Firelink Shrine
390400	392580	and you assume their run is gonna be similar looking
392580	393740	but with slight improvements,
393740	397280	they get up and immediately head in the opposite direction.
397280	398040	KEITA.
398040	400580	Goes to parts of the game Twilight never even sees
400580	401420	in their run.
401420	403000	Firstly, they go to the Valley of Drakes,
403000	404280	dodge between the drakes,
404280	405820	and grab the Red Tearstone Ring,
405820	407420	which boosts the player's damage output
407420	410580	by roughly 66% when they're below 20% health.
410580	411960	By playing more riskily,
411960	414240	KEITA becomes much more dangerous.
414240	416540	This is the kind of improvement I love seeing in speedruns,
416540	418660	learning to abuse a risk-reward mechanic
418660	421620	to just get the rewards by simply playing really well.
421620	423540	In a speedrun, a risk-reward item
423540	426660	can very frequently become a reward.
426660	428240	Then they run into Darkroot Basin
428240	429860	and encounter the Black Knight there.
429860	432180	Now, Black Knights are tough enemies in the early game.
432180	433320	They don't take much damage
433320	435320	even when you riposte or backstab them.
435320	436780	You can see this is gonna take quite a-
436780	438100	Oh, he's pushed him off the cliff.
438100	440400	Is rewarded with the Black Knight Halberd.
440400	442240	You only get this weapon for killing the knight
442240	444060	like 20% of the time,
444060	446140	and these knights don't respawn.
446140	448780	This halberd forms the basis of KEITA's strategy,
448780	450560	so if they don't get the halberd here,
450560	452480	they would have to start the run again.
452480	454640	There are definitely countless runs
454640	457240	on the cutting room floor that ended here just because.
457240	459240	You can slightly increase the chance of it dropping
459240	461160	if you have more humanity on you,
461160	463020	but it's still like a crapshoot.
463020	464900	Now, there's a reason the last thing you fight
464900	467940	before the final boss is a Black Knight with a halberd.
467940	469480	Gwyn knew what was up.
469480	472900	This weapon absolutely mashes most enemies and bosses.
472900	475320	Then they just keep going and run all the way around
475320	477740	to the Darkroot Basin entrance to the Undead Parish,
477740	479700	skipping several areas completely.
479700	482280	After beating the gargoyles with a regular old axe,
482280	483520	they use the souls they've gained
483520	485820	to level up enough to equip the halberd,
485820	488820	which they can now just about wield if they two-hand it.
488860	490860	Cairta had precisely figured out
490860	493140	the most efficient way to get the souls they needed
493140	495180	to use this weapon as early as possible.
495180	497360	This means they're able to utterly destroy
497360	500180	the fire bosses that Twilight had to skip completely
500180	501440	because of their weapons.
501440	504820	It's literally faster for Cairta to run through all this
504820	506640	and kill all these bosses
506640	508520	than it is to gather the materials
508520	510280	required to just skip them.
510280	513680	Overall, Cairta saved 15 entire minutes over Twilight
513680	515900	while killing more bosses.
515900	518060	Most of the current record holders in Dark Souls
518060	519880	use this basic strategy now,
519880	521340	but they've saved even more time
521340	523380	by discovering new holes in the game to exploit,
523380	525180	like by messing with the camera system
525180	527520	enough to go out of bounds and enter Sen's Fortress early.
527520	529180	They've improved the strategy so much
529180	531720	that they don't even use the Master Key anymore.
531720	534600	Instead, they use black fire bombs to...
534600	536020	Oh, no.
536020	537800	Black fire bombs?
537800	541720	What a garbage option.
541720	547020	Why would anyone ever pick that?
547800	551140	I just shouldn't be allowed to talk about Dark Souls anymore.
551140	553020	Someone should just fucking come and stop me
553020	556440	before I make him another fucking idiot of myself.
556440	559100	Could someone ever please stop me talking about Dark Sou-
559100	561860	♪♪
561860	563320	-♪♪
563320	565900	This just goes to show how much a run can develop.
565900	568480	The once really obvious main choices
568480	571060	of Pyromancer, Master Key, and Drake Sword
571060	573260	have all, in turn, been superseded.
573260	575260	The creation and development of new runs through games
575340	577340	is really, really fun to watch,
577340	579960	but in a way that's hard to describe.
579960	583540	It's a kind of logistical fun.
583540	584800	Is that a kind of fun?
584800	587380	That doesn't sound like a kind of fun.
587380	591180	It reminds me of the feeling I got when I had my GPS out,
591180	593380	and it told me to take a route through a park
593380	594680	that I knew really well, and I was like,
594680	596600	nah, I can go through that faster,
596600	600020	and I walked a different route, and I got through it faster.
600020	601260	It just felt amazing.
601260	603760	It's a bit like the feeling I got
603760	606380	when I decided I was gonna do my taxes eight months early.
606380	608380	Have you ever done your taxes early?
608380	611420	♪♪
611420	613180	Speedrunning is for you.
613180	614800	♪♪
614800	616680	W-welcome, friend!
616680	619100	♪♪
619100	620960	Wha-?
620960	624680	I have a script for this bit, but I forgot all the words.
624680	627840	Part two, categorization and arbitrarin-
627840	630600	No one I showed this script suggested better titles,
630600	632560	so I'm just gonna have to go with these ones.
632560	635140	Now, I have to admit, I've so far deliberately
635140	637560	not mentioned something about the Dark Souls run.
637560	639680	The progression I described is actually only one
639680	642520	of several different categories of run through the game,
642520	645020	one known as any% no wrong warp.
645020	647060	Like I said before, most of the normal run
647060	649060	is spent killing all the major bosses
649060	651560	to get the Lord Souls to unlock the big door,
651560	653520	which is why it was kind of a big deal
653520	656480	when players figured out a way to teleport right here
656480	659760	on the other side of the door without having to open it.
659760	661600	The game's DLC added an arena
661600	663480	where players could fight each other online.
663480	665300	Swang into tomorrow!
665300	666600	After beating Artorias,
666600	668480	who incidentally was my favorite boss fight
668480	670940	in the series until Bloodborne's DLC came out,
670940	674640	you gain access to the Battle of Stoicism gazebo,
674640	677020	which presumably sounds better in Japanese.
677020	680020	When they join the arena through the gazebo,
680020	682100	players receive a purple coward's crystal,
682100	683400	which they can use to quit a fight
683400	685020	and teleport back to the entrance.
685020	687180	It does this by telling the game to move you
687180	689140	to a certain map and position,
689140	691360	the map being the main DLC area,
691360	693700	and the position being the entrance to the arena.
693700	695120	Now, there are other items in the game
695120	696200	which work similarly,
696200	698440	like the Homeward Bonio or the Dark Sign.
698440	700160	They tell the game to take you to the map
700160	701980	where you last rested at a bonfire
701980	703860	and the position of that bonfire.
703860	706200	So let's say you last rested at the bonfire
706200	707400	in front of the big door.
707400	709160	Barring specific circumstances,
709160	711520	using one of these two items will take you back here.
711520	714400	Now, you can't normally use the purple coward's crystal
714400	716360	outside of the arena. It's grayed out.
716360	717900	Trying to use it makes your character
717900	720060	have a panic attack and think about all the times
720060	722020	they said, you too, when a waiter told them
722020	723940	to enjoy their food, but there's a glitch
723940	725560	that allows players to use items
725560	727060	even when they're not intended to
727060	728720	by trying to use it,
728720	730260	switching to an item they can use,
730260	731260	like the Estus flask,
731260	733360	while holding down the Use button still,
733360	735680	running off an edge while toggling weapons,
735680	738560	and pressing the Use button again on an exact frame,
738560	741860	causing the player to drink the item along with the flask,
741860	745180	which uses it even if you're not supposed to be able to.
745180	746440	What a handy item.
746440	749060	You can visit the gazebo whenever you like.
749060	750220	But here's the thing.
750220	751760	Using the crystal in the main game
751760	754480	has a fancy long animation where you can't do anything
754480	756360	as the game fades to a loading screen,
756360	757860	but when you use it this way,
757860	761060	you can still walk around and use items before it fades,
761060	764360	so what if we used another item that teleports us
764360	766820	while this other effect was going off?
766820	768940	Well, to put it simply,
768940	771260	the game gets confused.
771260	774400	It tries to load you to the map of the last used bonfire,
774400	776900	which in our case is the bonfire before the big door,
776900	779120	which we cleverly napped at before coming here,
779120	781740	but the position of the arena entrance.
781740	783740	The arena entrance the game is looking for
783740	785580	doesn't exist in this map, though,
785580	787900	so instead it takes you to the pre-programmed
787900	789700	default position in the level,
789700	792660	and it turns out that the default position for this area
792660	795040	is inside the Kiln of the First Flame,
795040	798820	so now all players need to do to beat the game
798820	802580	is gain access to this bonfire and the DLC battle arenas,
802580	805620	and then they can warp directly to the last area.
805620	806880	Oh, and also they have to perform
806880	808760	an absurdly precise set of inputs
808760	810960	with barely even a frame of lenience.
810960	813620	Seriously, it's really hard getting this footage alone.
813620	815260	Took me, like, 25 minutes,
815260	817180	but if you can execute this consistently,
817180	819540	which speedrunners are really good at learning to do,
819540	821800	this method saves a lot of time.
821800	824080	However, it was decided by the community
824080	826420	to be so different from the other runs,
826420	828120	since you have to both own the DLC
828120	829920	and abuse a pretty major glitch,
829920	832620	that all runs prior to the discovery of this glitch
832620	834760	and after the discovery but which don't use it
834760	837060	should be split off into their own separate category.
837060	839260	At this point, the Dark Souls speedrun community
839260	842060	has split the game into at least 14 different categories
842060	843900	ranging from extra difficult challenges
843900	845300	such as killing all the bosses
845300	847760	or completing the entire game without leveling up
847760	850140	to absurdist challenges like completing the game
850140	852800	after collecting one of every ring item in the game.
852800	854760	The Lord of the Rings run.
854760	855760	That's a clever name.
855760	857400	This kind of separation of a run
857400	860180	into distinct categories also happened in Bloodborne.
860180	861640	When the game was initially released,
861640	863100	a glitch in some of the architecture
863100	864180	for the game was discovered,
864180	866020	resulting in the player being able to leap off
866020	867600	at an angle from a coffin
867600	869480	and get onto a raised section of wall,
869480	871480	then do an attack at another part of a wall
871480	872480	to clip through,
872480	874320	skipping a whole bunch of the game.
874320	876060	For example, the fight with Ghasgwagni
876060	877680	and leading to the creation of a route
877680	879400	which, supplemented by other tricks,
879400	881900	would eventually only take about 20 minutes,
881900	883480	which is utterly absurd.
883480	885780	However, Bloodborne was pretty heavily patched
885780	888180	after release, making lots of changes and fixes
888180	890400	including that error in the architecture
890400	892900	and also, incidentally, much better load times.
892940	894660	This makes this run impossible to do
894660	896700	on a properly patched version of the game.
896700	898320	It also means the version of the game
898320	900780	you would play today on an online PS4
900780	903320	would be unable to do the fastest speedruns,
903320	905660	which puts you at a pretty major disadvantage.
905660	908400	The solution was for new categories to be created,
908400	910320	so runners could run the original version
910320	911540	of the game if they wanted,
911540	914160	but runners could also compete using the current patch.
914160	916280	The current fastest patched run of the game
916280	917700	is slower by eight minutes,
917700	920160	although, incidentally, because of the massive fixes
920160	922500	to load times, despite the in-game timer
922560	924560	telling you it's almost eight minutes slower,
924560	927680	it's a minute faster to watch in real time.
927680	930020	Bloodborne was messed up when it came out, wasn't it?
930020	931560	Bloodborne's a really interesting game
931560	933640	to run as well in general for a lot of reasons,
933640	935400	one of them being the beast blood pellet,
935400	937120	which adds a meter filled by dealing
937120	939160	certain types of damage, and the higher the meter,
939160	941860	the more damage the player both deals and receives.
941860	944000	It's a bit risk-reward in normal play,
944000	945620	but it's a godsend for speedrunners,
945620	947660	and in some ways, it makes the game easier
947660	951040	for speedrunners by specifically rewarding fast play.
951040	953420	The diverging any% categories in these games
953420	956120	raises interesting questions about the hobby.
956120	958620	In games with multiple categories,
958620	961000	which one is the real speedrun?
961000	964060	Why are some glitches and tricks permitted and others not?
964060	967140	Shouldn't the goal be to create the fastest singular run
967140	969480	and agree on one standard set of rules
969480	971560	for what the speedrun should be?
971560	974280	And how does one decide when something is allowed
974280	977280	and when something should be a separate category or banned?
977320	981060	Well, it depends on both the game and its community.
981060	982860	A game that's impacted by these questions
982860	984900	in a big way is Mirror's Edge.
987400	989480	Mirror's Edge is a game very close to my heart,
989480	991540	to the point that I've speedrun it before as well.
991540	994280	If I'd bothered to submit the run to speedruns.com,
994280	999340	I'd officially be in 201st place.
999340	1001260	The thing about Mirror's Edge is it's a game
1001260	1002840	about moving very quickly.
1002840	1004460	The player character is very mobile,
1004460	1006640	has a diverse set of moves across surfaces,
1006660	1008460	and for picking up speed, and different ways
1008460	1010740	of jumping onto, off of, and across things.
1010740	1012840	There are also a lot of little ways the mechanics
1012840	1015080	can be manipulated to go even faster.
1015080	1016840	This makes it an ideal speed game.
1016840	1019380	This runner just executed a trick so quickly
1019380	1021420	at the beginning that you probably didn't even see it.
1021420	1024000	Right as they loaded in, they turned to the side
1024000	1026260	and did a side hop, which immediately gets them
1026260	1027340	up to top speed.
1027340	1028800	This is one of my favorite tricks right here.
1028800	1031300	Normally, this pole, like, you have to slowly
1031300	1033440	do a balancing act as you walk across it.
1033860	1035860	You're taking your sweet old time.
1035860	1038080	Runners have reached the point where they leap onto it
1038080	1039540	in a straight line and don't fall off,
1039540	1041120	and then turn and do another jump off of it,
1041120	1043040	so they never have to do it. It's incredible.
1043040	1044920	Playing Mirror's Edge as fast as you can,
1044920	1046920	and then going online and checking out a speedrun
1046920	1048300	is a really fun experience.
1048300	1050220	There are so many nuances and specifics
1050220	1052300	to the game's level designs and movement mechanics
1052300	1054600	that it's just a joy to see how much extra speed
1054600	1056060	can be teased out.
1056060	1058600	But the game's parkour focus and aesthetic
1058600	1060400	also poses a question for runners.
1060400	1062640	What does it mean to speedrun?
1062680	1064680	What does it mean to speedrun Mirror's Edge?
1064680	1066440	There's a variety of interesting glitches
1066440	1068140	available to exploit if you want to beat
1068140	1069600	Mirror's Edge as fast as possible,
1069600	1071560	but some of them significantly impact
1071560	1073980	the way the game is played and what the experience
1073980	1075280	of watching it is like.
1075280	1077160	Take, for example, the out-of-bounds glitch,
1077160	1078280	or OOB.
1078280	1080540	Plenty of games let you get OOB of the level
1080540	1082740	and use this to get to places meant to be reached
1082740	1084500	through slower or harder means.
1084500	1086280	This can be used very egregiously
1086280	1088920	to bypass large chunks of several levels,
1088920	1091380	and this is technically much, much faster
1091420	1093240	than playing the game the normal way.
1093240	1096540	But it also runs counter to the sort of principles
1096540	1099300	that make Mirror's Edge the game you'd want to see speedrun
1099300	1100720	in the first place, doesn't it?
1100720	1102680	It's a game all about motion, finesse,
1102680	1104680	clever use of controls and timing
1104680	1107260	to skirt along the edge of the proverbial mirror,
1107260	1110140	not to clip through it and then just win.
1110140	1112640	Part of the fun of speedrunning is watching a game
1112640	1115220	being played very skillfully and very quickly,
1115220	1117600	and some tricks rub up against what some people
1117600	1120440	would define as skillfully playing the game.
1120460	1122260	So Mirror's Edge has multiple categories
1122260	1123460	for the main run through the game,
1123460	1126000	including Any% and Glitchless.
1126000	1128800	In Any%, you can be treated to a faster run of the game
1128800	1130340	using a lot of technical trickery
1130340	1133300	to run across surfaces in weird and impossible ways,
1133300	1136220	accelerate far faster than was probably ever intended,
1136220	1139400	abuse a bizarre mistake in the wall-run kick programming
1139400	1142180	that allows you to jump on one frame right afterwards
1142180	1144020	like Faith had a double jump or something,
1144020	1147020	slide into parts of the world you were never meant to see,
1147020	1149700	have an LSD trip nightmare as every frame
1149700	1152280	of Faith's movement is suspended before her eyes,
1152280	1154040	and climb through moving elevators
1154040	1156080	to shoot up into darkness.
1156080	1158460	This run is really interesting and showcases
1158460	1160300	some amazing tricks and moves,
1160300	1162760	but it's also maybe not the sort of stuff
1162760	1165300	it's fun to see specifically in a speedrun
1165300	1166560	of this type of game.
1166560	1168480	This is obviously highly subjective, of course,
1168480	1171260	but the community seems to agree with me, so I win.
1171260	1174360	In around 2013, they introduced the Glitchless category,
1174360	1176860	which specifically prohibits using major glitches
1176860	1178820	that alter the flow of the game in this way.
1178820	1180940	Glitchless runs don't go out of bounds,
1180940	1183320	don't abuse the weird extra jump you can get
1183320	1184400	from kicking off a wall,
1184400	1186400	and prohibit a few other specific tricks
1186400	1189160	that some people might deem against the spirit
1189160	1190200	of Mirror's Edge.
1190200	1193660	Glitchless has never and will never be faster than any percent,
1193660	1197000	but to me, at least, it's even more entertaining to watch.
1197000	1198660	Runners in this category are navigating
1198660	1201040	through more of the intended world of Mirror's Edge,
1201040	1204120	which, for someone who played and really liked the game,
1204120	1206180	is a way more interesting challenge.
1206180	1208420	All kinds of segments that are completely avoided
1208440	1210400	by fairly easy tricks in any percent
1210400	1213520	have to actually be played and routed properly in Glitchless.
1213520	1217120	Let's compare just one jump across both categories.
1217120	1219740	Here's the entrance to the RPA building in the second level.
1219740	1222240	This jump is one of the first properly tough jumps
1222240	1223620	in the game. It's a long distance,
1223620	1225580	but also involves downward traversal.
1225580	1228420	You have to approach it at speed and jump really late,
1228420	1231120	but also roll when you land or you get hurt.
1231120	1233720	Either rolling or taking damage is really slow.
1233720	1236600	A runner doesn't really want to do either of those things.
1236600	1238380	In the current Glitchless world record,
1238400	1241400	the runner Wreck executes an incredibly skillful maneuver
1241400	1243680	to take full advantage of this rail here,
1243680	1246520	so they land on the rail instead of the regular ground,
1246520	1248820	which prevents them having to roll or take damage,
1248820	1252620	but they also turned in midair and executed a side jump
1252620	1255400	to immediately get back to top speed when they landed.
1255400	1257000	This is really, really cool.
1257000	1259120	It's really difficult to do. I can't do it.
1259120	1261820	Here's the same part in the current Any% world record
1261820	1263160	by Philotrax.
1263160	1264920	Trax abuses the wall kick jump
1264920	1267960	to effectively fly over this challenging gap,
1267960	1270140	landing safely on some of the game's trademark
1270140	1272520	white plant furniture stuff.
1272520	1275060	Extrapolating tricks like this across a full game run
1275060	1278020	makes for two very different and uniquely interesting paths
1278020	1279260	through the game to watch.
1279260	1281480	Earlier, I asked the question of which category
1281480	1284280	should be considered the real speedrunner of the game,
1284280	1287060	but I don't think there's an objective answer,
1287060	1288360	at least for most games.
1288360	1289700	Even in Bloodborne's case,
1289700	1291780	using bugs that were patched out later,
1291780	1294240	this is a version of Bloodborne that was released,
1294240	1296420	and it beats the game as fast as possible,
1296420	1298460	and in Mirror's Edge, maybe clipping through walls
1298460	1301580	should be seen as just as valid a strategy as not doing so,
1301580	1303800	but everyone gets to decide for themselves
1303800	1306000	how to figure out what a speedrun needs to be,
1306000	1307640	and usually there's gonna be enough people
1307640	1309520	who feel that way that it's gonna end up
1309520	1310720	as a speedrun category,
1310720	1312220	and the Mirror's Edge community has come up
1312220	1314440	with quite a lot of categories over the years.
1314440	1316720	I've only talked about one of the extra ones so far.
1316720	1318400	There's also Any% in bounds,
1318400	1320680	which specifically avoids out-of-bounds glitches
1320680	1322320	if you think going oob is wrong
1322320	1323780	and are okay with the more advanced
1323780	1325440	wall kick jump tricks and stuff.
1325460	1326880	There's much more healthy competition
1326880	1329440	when there are multiple agreed sets of rules to choose from.
1329440	1331680	I imagine if there had only been one ruling
1331680	1334100	for how to speedrun Mirror's Edge,
1334100	1336520	it would be a lot less satisfying for a lot of runners
1336520	1338480	and wouldn't have seen quite as many runners
1338480	1339860	come and go over the years.
1339860	1341820	One runner eventually got a job at DICE
1341820	1343240	and worked on the sequel,
1343240	1345900	which apparently some people even played,
1345900	1346740	so that's nice.
1346740	1349160	Speedrunning is a completely arbitrary challenge,
1349160	1352160	one that most developers never even think to account for,
1352160	1354340	so it's totally fine to have multiple ways
1354360	1355740	of categorizing runs,
1355740	1357700	different kinds of challenge and so on
1357700	1360540	because some types of run are more interesting than others
1360540	1362700	and none are really any more valid
1362700	1365340	because they're all ultimately just silly things
1365340	1367880	some people do for the sake of fun and competition.
1367880	1370260	I think it's cool that even what it means
1370260	1373300	to play a game quickly can be up for discussion sometimes.
1373300	1374920	My favorite type of Mirror's Edge run
1374920	1378100	is the 69 stars category, which is very nice.
1378100	1379940	It's the category for running through all the game's
1379940	1381480	optional time trials in one sitting
1381480	1382760	and getting all the stars.
1382780	1384860	It really embodies the things I enjoy the most
1384860	1386280	about the Glitchless speedrun.
1386280	1388820	It's just great performances utilizing mechanics
1388820	1391120	mostly intended by the game's developers.
1391120	1393960	Runners do awesome stuff like ignore the game's
1393960	1395620	in-built run-ups for big jumps
1395620	1398580	and instead make really precise movement over them
1398580	1401660	to jump manually at the edge and make it further and faster.
1401660	1402660	It's awesome.
1402660	1406040	The current number one record is by Voatiem?
1406040	1407680	Voatiem? I'm not sure,
1407680	1411000	who got in just a teeny smidge over 21 minutes
1411000	1413080	due to a couple of minor mistakes.
1413080	1414540	You're kidding, right?
1414540	1417460	Someone is going to beat 21 minutes in this category,
1417460	1418960	and I can't wait. It's gonna be awesome.
1418960	1420960	And because Mirror's Edge seems to inspire
1420960	1423840	utter obsession in its fans, myself included,
1423840	1427060	speedrun.com also has a category extension leaderboard
1427060	1429600	for even more weirder and specific runs.
1429600	1432220	Uh, speedrun.com slash memeem.
1432220	1433680	Heh heh. It's pretty great.
1433680	1435440	There's a true Glitchless category here
1435440	1438140	for weirdo purists like me who just want to see
1438140	1440780	the actual game played near perfectly.
1440800	1442800	There's categories that often only even have
1442800	1444480	one or two submitters where, like,
1444480	1446400	runs where one runner uses the mouse
1446400	1447780	and another uses the keyboard
1447780	1450520	or where two runners each use half of one controller.
1450520	1452280	Honestly, this is just getting silly now.
1452280	1453860	What about a New Game Plus category
1453860	1456240	where players chapter select the last segment
1456240	1458000	and beat it in 13 seconds
1458000	1461000	and people are genuinely down to counting milliseconds
1461000	1463120	to figure out who was actually the fastest?
1463120	1465840	What about RBO, reverse boss order,
1465840	1468420	where runners chapter select to each boss in the game
1468440	1471240	in reverse order and time beating each of them?
1471240	1474860	What about reverse RBO, where they do RBO backwards?
1474860	1476280	Why would you do it like that?
1476280	1478080	That's just boss. Why is it called that?
1478080	1480660	How about Any% x 25,
1480660	1482820	where one runner has decided to run the game
1482820	1485080	25 times in a row,
1485080	1487660	which took over 17 hours
1487660	1490720	and which they openly declare no one will ever beat?
1490720	1492720	What the fuck are your sidesteps right now?
1492720	1496600	I told you I'm not even paying attention anymore.
1496620	1498540	Why would you do this, Hekigan?
1498540	1501460	Was your 60-millisecond lead in New Game Plus
1501460	1504000	not enough anymore? Did you need something stronger?
1504000	1505800	What are you doing to yourself?
1506800	1510100	This is also where the segmented speedrun lives
1510100	1512860	with various runners including the aforementioned Hekigan,
1512860	1515640	Votime, Votime,
1515640	1518600	Philotrax, and Wreck all contributing small segments
1518600	1521100	to produce an absolutely incredible run.
1521100	1523940	It's a fabulous expression of a community's commitment
1523940	1525660	to beating a game as fast as possible
1525660	1527620	and their years of developing skills
1527620	1530320	and learning more and more about how the game works.
1530320	1531960	I love it. Link in the description.
1531960	1534000	Just give it a look. It's just great.
1534020	1537040	There's a tremendous sense of community to speedrunning.
1537040	1539200	People share information and discoveries,
1539200	1540700	discuss theories together,
1540700	1543300	and all the tricks used in runs are by their nature
1543300	1545380	immediately available for further analysis
1545380	1546660	and use in other runs.
1546660	1547760	I remember, like, way back in the day,
1547760	1549720	like, in 2014, like, I was in a Skype call
1549720	1551880	with some other SMS runners.
1551880	1553760	We were watching Tobu do some runs,
1553760	1556180	and we've never seen that spin jump before,
1556180	1558480	and it just, like, it blew our minds.
1558480	1560400	We're like, okay, I'm never gonna go for that,
1560400	1561680	and that was just, like, commonplace,
1561700	1563120	so that just goes to show, like,
1563120	1564420	how far this game has come.
1564420	1566080	Yeah. Speedrunning is an almost
1566080	1569080	inherently collectivist activity in this sense.
1569080	1571160	While there is competition to be the best
1571160	1572540	and take or hold the record,
1572540	1574960	almost no record holder has completely earned
1574960	1576640	that position all on their own.
1576640	1579100	The best runs owe a debt to the discoveries
1579100	1581420	and ideas contributed by previous runners.
1581420	1583020	The best run is often representative
1583020	1584840	of many people's contributions
1584840	1586800	alongside the runner's own skill, of course.
1586800	1589900	In a sense, speedruns are always a group effort.
1589920	1593040	It's really not surprising that awesome charity events
1593040	1595380	like GDQ have emerged from this space.
1595380	1597120	It's just a grander scaled version
1597120	1599680	of what speedrunning had kind of always been.
1599680	1601800	You can't copyright a technique or strategy
1601800	1603640	for beating a video game quickly.
1603640	1605760	There are no patents in speedrunning.
1605760	1607260	Proving that you got a time
1607260	1609640	or even getting the fastest time
1609640	1612560	isn't just an achievement or personal victory.
1612560	1615260	It's also automatically a contribution
1615260	1617360	to the greater community effort,
1617360	1618900	and that's radical.
1619860	1622180	But speedrunning isn't always about socialism.
1622180	1625180	Sometimes it's about beating video games very quickly.
1625180	1627640	Part three, in-depth investigation.
1627640	1629600	Actually, no, I've thought of a better title for this one.
1629600	1630900	Donkey Kong.
1630900	1631440	Ah!
1631440	1634440	["DONKEY KONG 64 THEME"]
1634440	1637700	["DONKEY KONG 64 THEME"]
1637700	1639940	Donkey Kong 64 is a game by Rareware
1639940	1641280	for the Nintendo 64.
1641280	1642400	Oh, you don't need to know that part.
1642400	1644700	It's very much the embodiment of the stereotypes
1644700	1646560	about Rare's games for the time period.
1646560	1649560	Large levels full of hundreds of different specific items
1649560	1652720	you have to collect to unlock more things to collect.
1652720	1655860	For instance, each level has 500 bananas,
1655860	1657940	but what makes it particularly troublesome
1657940	1659860	is that some items are specifically
1659860	1662260	for one of the five characters you play.
1662260	1664220	To collect enough stuff to progress,
1664220	1666020	you'd have to traverse the same environments
1666020	1668180	over and over with every character,
1668180	1669980	and the levels were often really big.
1669980	1671640	At the time, it made the game feel big
1671640	1673520	and like a cool, sprawling adventure
1673520	1675440	that lasted a long time and had a lot of chances
1675440	1677400	to see how each character can progress
1677400	1678480	through the same environment
1678480	1680440	using their own skills and abilities.
1680440	1682560	That's because I was seven years old.
1682560	1683860	["BOOM"]
1683860	1686480	Now it just feels like time-consuming busywork.
1686480	1688320	Lots of this was completely unnecessary
1688320	1689940	from a design standpoint, too.
1689940	1691820	You could design a game with collectibles
1691820	1694060	only one character could reach in the first place
1694060	1696020	instead of most of the time just having them
1696020	1697560	hanging out there, faded out,
1697560	1699780	reminding you you're gonna have to come back here again
1699780	1700900	with another character,
1700900	1703100	and running back to that barrel that changes characters
1703100	1705600	because you need to pick something else up is awful.
1705600	1707640	Running back to previously completed levels
1707640	1710020	because you finally have the characters you needed
1710020	1712360	to pick up those bananas you'd already walked past
1712360	1714680	eight times is a more painful tragedy
1714680	1716400	than Titus Andronicus.
1716400	1719400	I would cut off my hand and send it to Emperor Saturninus
1719400	1721320	if it meant I could have just picked that banana up
1721320	1724680	four hours ago with Daddy Kong instead of Yankle Kong.
1724680	1726940	I can feel my cells dividing
1726940	1730360	as my precious existence rushes toward its finite end
1730360	1733620	with nothing in the world to beguile my sorrow
1733620	1735660	but the sweet siren song of,
1735660	1737820	ooh, banana.
1737820	1740900	Donkey Kong 64 is an existential crisis
1740900	1743580	in the form of a video game cartridge.
1743580	1747860	I'm actually more aware of the futility of my existence
1747860	1750240	after trying to go back and play this.
1750240	1753940	Now, I could sit you down and explain the progression
1753940	1756040	of the Donkey Kong 64 Any% run to you
1756040	1757740	like it was the back of my hand,
1757780	1760540	but firstly, there's already a video
1760540	1762700	by Summoning Salt out there doing just that,
1762700	1764320	and that video's better than anything I could do,
1764320	1765860	so you should just go check that one out,
1765860	1768320	and secondly, well, to be honest,
1768320	1771240	I've seen a lot of speedruns at this point,
1771240	1772860	and I'm kind of used to it, you know?
1772860	1774360	Oh, yeah, Donkey Kong 64,
1774360	1776580	a game I beat in 72 hours as a kid
1776580	1778900	being beaten by a professional in 30 minutes.
1778900	1781580	Yeah, sure, that's impressive.
1781580	1786860	To a clown at the circus, I need something stronger.
1786860	1788820	I've built up a tolerance to this stuff.
1788820	1791360	We need to go deeper and darker.
1791360	1793020	We need to talk about the players who will settle
1793020	1795320	for nothing more than total conquest,
1795320	1797560	and no, I'm not talking about
1797560	1800560	Donkey Kong Country 2 Diddy's Kong Quest.
1800560	1802020	You get it's a pun.
1802020	1807020	No, I'm talking about the Donkey Kong 64 100% speedrun.
1807020	1808600	Yeah.
1808600	1810860	Well, technically, it's the 101% speedrun
1810860	1812900	because Rareware were pretty good
1812900	1815100	at ironically recognizing that they'd put
1815100	1817340	way too many collectibles in their goddamn game.
1817340	1819420	To achieve 101% completion,
1819420	1821560	players must collect the Nintendo coin,
1821560	1823640	the Rareware coin, all eight keys,
1823640	1825960	all ten battle crowns, all 20 fairies,
1825960	1828420	all 201 golden bananas,
1828420	1830260	and all 40 banana medals,
1830260	1831880	each of which is awarded for collecting
1831880	1834520	75 of a Kong's bananas in a level
1834520	1838640	for a total of 3,000 bananas.
1838640	1841220	Hey, but sometimes they come in little bunches of five.
1841220	1842340	Thanks, Donkey Kong.
1842340	1844420	The rules list for this run on speedrun.com
1844420	1846240	actually includes the stipulation
1846240	1848240	that to submit runs for this category,
1848240	1849820	you must hate yourself.
1849820	1853420	Runners in this category endure such supreme torments
1853420	1855080	that one of them fucking streamed themselves
1855080	1857460	breaking their cartridge to make sure it was over.
1857460	1859000	This is my DK cart.
1859000	1860660	Fun fact.
1860660	1862240	Did you know that the PAL version
1862240	1864620	of the Donkey Kong 64 cartridge was gray,
1864620	1867320	but the US retail version was banana yellow?
1867320	1869860	Heh, you learn something new every day.
1869860	1871820	This run is challenging in far more ways
1871820	1872960	than the traditional run.
1873000	1875000	In that run, your objective is fairly simple.
1875000	1876540	Find the fastest way to the end,
1876540	1877620	whatever that way may be,
1877620	1879200	abusing cutscene glitches,
1879200	1880920	level skips, moon jumps, et cetera,
1880920	1882120	effectively ending up with runs
1882120	1883860	where you do as little as possible.
1883860	1886460	This run's core is having to actually do
1886460	1888120	everything the game asks of you,
1888120	1889920	planning the most efficient route possible
1889920	1890960	through all of it,
1890960	1893160	and then somehow actually doing it all
1893160	1894660	precisely and quickly,
1894660	1896860	but with hundreds of golden bananas to collect,
1896860	1899080	and some of these can be very challenging,
1899080	1901500	and thousands of bananas!
1901500	1904000	Executing on all of this in succession
1904000	1907040	introduces a new kind of test for these runners,
1907040	1908200	resilience.
1908200	1910460	Paradoxically, as with the Beast Blood pellet,
1910460	1912040	when quicker strategies are found,
1912040	1914280	often that makes the game easier to beat
1914280	1916040	because the length of time you have to focus
1916040	1917860	on execution has gotten shorter.
1917860	1920320	You only have to pull off 30 minutes of good stuff
1920320	1922580	to beat the Any% run in 30 minutes.
1922580	1925500	If something takes around five hours to beat,
1925500	1928460	that's five hours of time to make mistakes in.
1928460	1931580	Five hours to get tired or lose focus
1931580	1934380	or slip from your intended most efficient path.
1934380	1937200	These runs are essentially torture,
1937200	1938960	and they're amazing.
1938960	1942280	There's a three-year-old run by German runner 360 Chris M.
1942280	1946040	that took 19 hours and 53 minutes.
1946040	1949820	The best part of this run is it has face cam.
1949820	1954160	You can watch in real time as the sun sets and rises,
1954160	1956780	and he gets ever closer to making it to the end.
1956780	1958240	He no-sells it, too.
1958280	1960780	Like, by the end, he still doesn't seem that tired.
1960780	1961900	It's kind of awesome.
1961900	1963100	Despite there being plenty of runs
1963100	1964940	that are way, way more optimized,
1964940	1967440	the better runs push the five-and-a-half-hours mark,
1967440	1969780	there's something very special about runs like this one
1969780	1971360	where they probably know their planned route
1971360	1973020	is gonna take them a full day,
1973020	1975280	but they sit down and do it.
1975280	1978780	I kind of love runs like this just for their sheer dedication
1978780	1980940	regardless of how efficient they are.
1980940	1983480	Yeah!
1983480	1984940	Whoo!
1984940	1986440	Sub 20, boys!
1986480	1988640	PB, boys. I PB'd by, uh,
1988640	1990340	four hours and six minutes.
1990340	1991340	Pretty solid.
1991340	1993560	Wait, his last attempt took nearly 25 hou—
1993560	1994480	Holy shi—
1994480	1996260	The various runs of this game have led players
1996260	1998940	to look very closely at almost every aspect,
1998940	2001020	even going so far as using hacking software
2001020	2002940	to analyze the code in detail,
2002940	2004680	looking for anything that can be exploited
2004680	2005860	to make runs faster.
2005860	2008680	DK64 has been investigated in a level of detail
2008680	2010980	greater than the developers could have ever intended
2010980	2013300	or expected, and that's led to new discoveries
2014160	2016420	but also to something really cool.
2016420	2017840	Enter Isotarge.
2017840	2020220	Isotarge is a runner with a really respectable time
2020220	2021380	in the any% category,
2021380	2023260	but it's also the longest-standing run
2023260	2024720	in the top ten by far.
2024720	2027460	In fact, it was the world record for six months back in 2015.
2027460	2029800	Isotarge has made a lot of contributions to the community,
2029800	2031960	including spending a lot of time digging around
2031960	2034080	inside the game's code, finding new glitches
2034080	2035960	and holes in world geometry and so on,
2035960	2038220	anything that could be exploited to get better runs.
2038220	2040080	Isotarge has found a lot of cool stuff in the game,
2040080	2042460	including this image of a Rareware employee's face
2042460	2043960	hidden inside the game's files,
2043960	2046780	which looks like it's been edited in a Game Boy Camera,
2046780	2048780	but they've also found stuff like this.
2048780	2050460	Out-of-bounds collectibles.
2050460	2052700	It's common for developers to leave items and objects
2052700	2054960	in places players can't get to in the game proper
2054960	2056500	and not worry about removing them,
2056500	2059080	like this coin hidden in a wall in Mario 64
2059080	2060960	that someone actually figured out how to get,
2060960	2062960	and since these items exist well outside
2062960	2064240	the intended scope of the game,
2064240	2066660	runs don't usually consider them collectibles
2066660	2067580	as part of a run.
2067580	2069040	They're more cool oddities
2069040	2071160	that shouldn't really be considered as game objects
2071160	2072200	to be collected.
2072200	2074980	But what if an item was absolutely collectible
2074980	2076280	without any glitches,
2076280	2078160	but no one had found it before?
2078160	2079820	One day when messing around in the game's code
2079820	2081940	looking for flags for collectible objects,
2081940	2083360	Isotarge found a banana coin
2083360	2086620	that hadn't been accounted for in the level Fungi Forest.
2086620	2089580	Banana coins in DK64 are used to buy items and upgrades,
2089580	2092120	and because this is Donkey Kong 64,
2092120	2094740	there are six different kinds of banana coin.
2094740	2096160	There's one color for each character,
2096160	2097540	but also a multicolored one,
2097540	2098940	which is usually hard to find
2098940	2100980	and gives five coins to every character
2101020	2102180	as soon as it's collected.
2102180	2103980	There's only 15 of them in the game,
2103980	2105860	one in each level except Angry Aztec,
2105860	2109140	which has two, and seven in the hub world of DK Isles.
2109140	2111260	This new coin wasn't any of the ones
2111260	2112940	that had been collected before,
2112940	2114680	but unlike the other items,
2114680	2116720	this one wasn't out of bounds.
2116720	2119640	It was hidden in a place no one had ever thought to check,
2119640	2121940	hidden in the tall grass in the level,
2121940	2124140	right about hee- no, wait, sorry,
2124140	2125860	right about...
2125860	2127680	here.
2127680	2128940	And there it is.
2128940	2130220	As far as I can tell,
2130220	2133340	this coin isn't mentioned anywhere on the Internet
2133340	2136340	prior to its discovery by Isotarge in the game's code,
2136340	2137640	and it's not in any strategy guide
2137640	2139840	from the time period I can get my hands on.
2139840	2141760	It's not really known whether the developers
2141760	2143140	put this coin here intentionally,
2143140	2144720	or forgot to remove it,
2144720	2147880	or why they thought to give so little indication it was there.
2147880	2150180	It's easy to see why it was missed for so long.
2150180	2151680	Now, a cool kicker to this story
2151680	2154800	would be that it invalidated all the 101% runs,
2154800	2156880	or it turned out that there are now technically
2156880	2158760	102% runs or something,
2158760	2161420	but banana coins aren't counted for percentages
2161420	2162500	on the game's menu screen,
2162500	2164340	and the total amount of coins you can get
2164340	2166000	isn't even listed in the game anywhere.
2166000	2168960	The 101% run doesn't even include all of the bananas
2168960	2171000	because the game only counts banana medals
2171000	2172760	towards completion, so they don't even get
2172760	2176420	all the bananas in the runs where you get 101% completion,
2176420	2178580	which is a bit of a disappointment, really.
2178580	2180500	You should get them all next time.
2180500	2182040	To amuse me.
2182040	2184040	Here's the SGDQ run in 2017,
2184040	2185420	soon after the coin was discovered,
2185420	2188080	where they just stopped to get it for kicks.
2188100	2190580	Lo and behold, it is...
2190580	2193120	the Rainbow Coin!
2193120	2194360	Yeah.
2194360	2197080	Uh, that Rainbow Coin has been hidden
2197080	2198860	basically since the game came out,
2198860	2201660	so, uh, over 16 years, right?
2201660	2203660	It's not technically a major discovery,
2203660	2205580	and it changes nothing about how the game is run
2205580	2206620	in the main categories,
2206620	2207920	outside of what are essentially
2207920	2210580	ultra-masochistic jokes that people only really do
2210580	2213080	just to be one of the two people who ever did it at all,
2213080	2215580	but it's still a really, really cool discovery.
2215580	2218420	Something was hidden just out of plain sight,
2218420	2220580	even to the people who would make a point
2220580	2222580	of collecting everything in the game
2222580	2224580	for 17 years.
2224580	2226080	What's fun about the Banana Coin
2226080	2227920	is that it's kind of an abstract example
2227920	2229920	of how awesome speedrunning communities are
2229920	2232080	for deconstructing and examining games.
2232080	2234080	Like, people are so dedicated
2234080	2236080	to coming to an understanding of a game,
2236080	2238080	they're uncovering things which probably would've remained
2238080	2239580	hidden forever otherwise.
2239580	2242080	And that's just neat, no matter how you peel it.
2242080	2243580	Oh, God, did I just say...
2243580	2245580	Why is speedrunning awesome?
2245580	2247580	Because people are awesome.
2247580	2249580	Because watching someone try something
2249580	2251580	over and over again, getting better and better,
2251580	2253580	and learning new secrets and strategies
2253580	2255580	in order to be the best at something,
2255580	2257080	sometimes for years,
2257080	2260080	is compelling and fascinating and human
2260080	2262580	in a way that no other form of media,
2262580	2265580	no television show could ever adequately replicate,
2265580	2268080	because a real human person
2268080	2270080	is sitting right there and doing it.
2270080	2272080	I opened this video using clips
2272080	2274580	from an attempt to finish Zelda Ocarina of Time
2274580	2277580	in the Any% category by skater82297.
2277580	2280580	This video in particular is one of my favorites.
2280580	2283080	This guy's been hammering away at Zelda Ocarina of Time
2283080	2284580	since at least 2014,
2284580	2286580	shaving seconds, fractions of seconds,
2286580	2288080	off of his personal best.
2288080	2289580	Here's a cool trick. On speedrun.com,
2289580	2292080	you can actually click to see all of the obsoleted runs,
2292080	2295580	runs that a runner has themselves gone on to supersede.
2295580	2297580	If you turn that on,
2297580	2301580	this guy basically is the top 20 fastest runs of Zelda
2301580	2303080	of all time.
2303080	2304580	But he didn't have number one.
2304580	2306080	Someone else was faster than him.
2306080	2308080	So he just kept going and going.
2308080	2309580	And you can see all of his runs.
2309580	2311080	And live on his channel,
2311080	2314080	you could have seen all of the many, many attempts
2314080	2316580	that went into even getting those runs.
2316580	2318580	And in this run, you see him get annoyed
2318580	2320080	by the tiniest things.
2320080	2323080	Goma doesn't activate for about a second longer
2323080	2324580	than he thinks it should,
2324580	2326580	and it just frustrates the hell out of him.
2328080	2329580	Dude.
2329580	2330580	Fuck you!
2330580	2331580	Fuck you!
2331580	2333080	Fuck you! Fuck you!
2333080	2334080	Fuck you.
2334080	2335580	No. Fucking shit, dude.
2335580	2337080	Fuck off.
2337080	2338580	I'm mad. Now fuck off.
2338580	2341080	He's angry about this boss not spawning fast enough,
2341080	2343580	even though he can kill it in seconds flat.
2343580	2345080	That was bullshit, dude.
2345080	2346080	That was utter shit.
2346080	2347580	That was bullshit.
2347580	2350580	A random onlooker would wonder why someone did this to themselves,
2350580	2352080	did something over and over,
2352080	2354080	even though it clearly wasn't any fun for them.
2354080	2358080	But then, they get deeper and deeper into the run.
2358580	2362580	And they start to realize that this might be the one.
2362580	2365080	The tone changes.
2365080	2367080	Things get quiet.
2369580	2372080	This might be happening.
2372080	2374080	Is it happening?
2376580	2380080	Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
2380080	2381080	Oh, my God.
2381080	2384080	Towards the end, he can barely even control his breathing.
2385080	2387080	He's panicking. He's anxious.
2387080	2390080	But he knows that if he can just execute on the ideas
2390080	2392080	that he's been developing for years,
2392080	2394080	this might be it.
2395080	2396580	Oh, my God, dude!
2396580	2399080	Oh, my fucking God!
2399080	2401080	Oh!
2401080	2404080	Okay. Okay.
2407080	2408080	Yes, dude!
2408080	2410080	Fucking yes!
2410080	2411080	Yes!
2411080	2413080	Oh, my God!
2413080	2415080	Yes!
2415080	2416080	Yes!
2416080	2418080	Yes, dude!
2418080	2420080	Oh, my God!
2420080	2422080	Yes!
2422080	2424080	Oh, my God!
2424080	2426080	Oh, my God, dude!
2426080	2430080	This run is currently the fastest run anyone has ever done
2430080	2432080	of The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
2432080	2434080	And then, in that moment,
2434080	2438080	in that period of being utterly overjoyed at this achievement,
2438080	2440080	it becomes clear why people do this.
2440080	2443080	And what you can get from this that you can't get anywhere else.
2443080	2445080	It's a story.
2445080	2447080	Not something written or directed by someone.
2447080	2450080	A real human story.
2450080	2453080	It's a story of perseverance and triumph.
2453080	2457080	And it's derived from something so small and silly-seeming,
2457080	2460080	but that only makes it more beautiful in a way.
2460080	2464080	And the best part is, the story's not over.
2464080	2468080	There's almost always more to learn about how to run any given game.
2468080	2471080	Always someone trying to beat the record.
2471080	2473080	And anyone can be a part of that.
2473080	2477080	Or, at the very least, anyone can be there to watch it happen.
2477080	2480080	This is probably why so many people tune in to events like GDQ
2480080	2483080	and even donate money to support work that helps keep people alive
2483080	2486080	so they can spend time with the people they love.
2486080	2488080	Or, you know, watching speedruns.
2488080	2490080	Hmm.
2490080	2492080	Hmm.
2498080	2502080	Okay, I have to admit, I told a bit of a porky pie earlier.
2502080	2504080	That's Cockney rhyming slang for lie,
2504080	2508080	which I clearly know, obvious Cockney, that I am.
2508080	2512080	I never actually beat Donkey Kong 64 as a kid.
2512080	2514080	I played it for 72 hours, and then I couldn't beat
2514080	2516080	the Donkey Kong arcade part near the end,
2516080	2519080	which you need to do to unlock the final boss fight.
2519080	2524080	So I had 72 hours of play and nothing to show for it.
2524080	2527080	And, frankly, that's piss.
2527080	2531080	So to finally put this little fucker to rest,
2531080	2533080	I'm gonna stream it.
2533080	2535080	I'm gonna start the game again,
2535080	2537080	and I'm gonna get absolutely everything in that game,
2537080	2540080	including the rainbow coin just to bring everything full circle,
2540080	2542080	and I'm gonna get absolutely everything, all the bananas,
2542080	2545080	not the minimum required for 101% completion,
2545080	2547080	and I'm not gonna stop until it's done.
2547080	2551080	I might, I will, fall asleep in my chair.
2551080	2553080	I'm not that resilient, although it is currently,
2553080	2556080	no joke, 2.41 a.m.
2556080	2558080	Hope you can see that.
2558080	2560080	So I might do okay, but I should probably rig it up
2560080	2563080	so that if anyone donates, an air horn will go off
2563080	2565080	and wake me up. Let's just torture me
2565080	2567080	for other people's enjoyment.
2567080	2569080	And all the donations will go to charity.
2569080	2572080	So finally some good can come out of Donkey Kong 64,
2572080	2574080	because certainly no fun has come out of it.
2574080	2576080	Anyway, thanks for watching this video.
2576080	2579080	Um, it's really just a love letter to the speedrunning community
2579080	2582080	because I just find it's been such a fulfilling part of my life,
2582080	2584080	and it looks like a lot of other people's.
2584080	2587080	A lot of gaming spaces can be pretty clicky at times,
2587080	2589080	and I think speedrunning has generally avoided that
2589080	2592080	with a lot of sort of close-knit but quite friendly communities.
2592080	2594080	A lot of people were really forthcoming with information
2594080	2596080	when I was doing research for this video,
2596080	2598080	and that was just really awesome, and I just think it's cool
2598080	2601080	how people can share the things they enjoy
2601080	2603080	and learn more about stuff and occasionally raise
2603080	2605080	quite a lot of money for some really good causes.
2605080	2608080	I just think the whole thing is so fun and kind
2608080	2611080	in a way that you don't see very often.
2611080	2613080	So, yeah, just thought it was nice.
2617080	2620080	Probably could have thought of a clever ending to this video,
2620080	2622080	but...
2622080	2624080	Uh...
