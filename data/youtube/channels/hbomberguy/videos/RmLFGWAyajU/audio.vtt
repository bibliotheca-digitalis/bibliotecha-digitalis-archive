00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
We'll try to explain our thinking on how we're coming across and why we're doing overkill the way it is.

00:04.800 --> 00:06.000
You can think and draw at the same time?

00:06.000 --> 00:06.500
Yeah.

00:06.500 --> 00:10.800
And especially if it's gonna be overkill, his equipment's gotta be overkill as well.

00:10.800 --> 00:11.500
Oh, heck yeah.

00:11.500 --> 00:15.100
Always remember, always remember, he's tough, but he's not violent.

00:15.100 --> 00:19.000
Along those lines, he's got the biggest shoulder pads ever existed.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.500
I figured he would.

00:20.500 --> 00:24.000
Okay, I'm gonna give him, I'm gonna give him some big knee pads here,

00:24.000 --> 00:27.800
because a guy like him that's got some armor and got some guns and stuff like that,

00:28.800 --> 00:30.800
Boy, he looks grim, doesn't he?

00:30.800 --> 00:34.800
Kids, you know, I mean, the kids, the kids like the dark, moody stuff, I mean,

00:34.800 --> 00:35.800
They seem to, yeah.

00:35.800 --> 00:38.800
But I have a question I've been wanting to ask you guys.

00:38.800 --> 00:42.800
How long does it take these people to get dressed, these kind of characters?

00:42.800 --> 00:43.800
Who says they undress?

00:43.800 --> 00:47.800
I mean, they're something, they have to get out quickly to save the world,

00:47.800 --> 00:50.800
but it takes them an hour and a half to get into all of this stuff, because they work fast.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.800
That's right, getting into the costume is like going to the bathroom in a comic book.

00:53.800 --> 00:57.800
You never show it, but you assume that Superman and Batman and Spider-Man

00:57.800 --> 00:59.800
actually do go and urinate every now and then, right?

00:59.800 --> 01:01.800
Right, but you never do show it, do you?

01:01.800 --> 01:02.800
No.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.800
But you do show, very often you show people getting dressed, especially women,

01:07.800 --> 01:09.800
I seem to recall that now and then.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.800
Do you draw hands? Are you into hands?

01:11.800 --> 01:12.800
Oh, yeah, I'm the best.

01:12.800 --> 01:13.800
You do hands?

01:13.800 --> 01:18.800
Why don't we give them, here, wires coming out here, coming down.

01:18.800 --> 01:19.800
Oh, they love that stuff.

01:19.800 --> 01:20.800
The kids love wires.

01:20.800 --> 01:21.800
The wires that he'll triple.

01:21.800 --> 01:22.800
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:23.800 --> 01:24.800
Hey, you draw good wires.

01:24.800 --> 01:25.800
Oh.

01:26.800 --> 01:30.800
Does he have a double identity? Is he really a meek accountant in real life?

01:30.800 --> 01:32.800
Who else could he be besides Overkill?

01:32.800 --> 01:36.800
Well, I mean, when he takes off all these clothes, is he a 87-pound weakling?

01:36.800 --> 01:38.800
Do you see him taking a rough fist?

01:38.800 --> 01:39.800
Okay.

01:39.800 --> 01:40.800
Okay.

01:40.800 --> 01:45.800
His thumb, he would have three different cannons that are facing you for the large kapooey.

01:46.800 --> 01:47.800
So, right here.

01:47.800 --> 01:50.800
They could be, like, missile launchers or whatever, but he's going to have those right over here.

01:50.800 --> 01:54.800
What makes you make those value judgments? Why only three? He's got four knuckles.

01:54.800 --> 01:55.800
Because the reader's crazy.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.800
Why does he have more on that side than that side?

01:57.800 --> 01:58.800
No, no.

01:58.800 --> 02:04.800
For the sake of our unseen viewers, is this really the type of thought process that you guys go through when you create characters?

02:04.800 --> 02:06.800
Yes, except for we have more than 20 minutes.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.800
We're using probably longer than you usually do.

02:09.800 --> 02:13.800
Well, I think I've got to say, seriously, which isn't easy for me to do,

02:13.800 --> 02:18.800
but I think it's very impressive that in a matter of 20 minutes, you guys could come up with something like this.

02:18.800 --> 02:22.800
I mean, bad as it is, it's still impressive that you were able to do it this quickly.

02:22.800 --> 02:23.800
Yeah, that's a cool logo.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.800
Rob, didn't you promise that you would draw and we would do the talking?

02:26.800 --> 02:27.800
I'm sorry.

02:27.800 --> 02:30.800
And when you grow up a little more, you know, we'll let you in there with the grown-ups.

02:30.800 --> 02:34.800
When you were creating characters, Stan, what was the process back then?

02:34.800 --> 02:38.800
I mean, because Rob and I right now, we do our own writing and our own drawing.

02:38.800 --> 02:41.800
We don't collaborate with anybody anymore, so...

02:41.800 --> 02:44.800
That's the problem, and I've been meaning to talk to you guys about that.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.800
Boy, he is one grim-looking guy.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.800
There's no way this man can move.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.800
He's got to have a power to defy gravity, I would say, just looking at him.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.800
He's a tank. I mean, what do you think?

02:53.800 --> 02:58.800
Now, the funniest thing would be if you say that these are jets and he's the fastest man alive.

02:58.800 --> 03:02.800
We've got to justify all of this paraphernalia somehow.

03:02.800 --> 03:06.800
I don't know that you're really doing my character right.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.800
That's all right, I guess, for such beginners.

03:09.800 --> 03:13.800
We have a minute and a half or so. I want to tighten those feet.

03:13.800 --> 03:14.800
All right, guys?

03:14.800 --> 03:17.800
Give him an ankle bone here, an ankle bone here.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.800
I think it takes you longer to sign your name than to do a picture.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.800
Heck yeah, it is.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.800
I'm going to step out, okay?

03:25.800 --> 03:29.800
Incidentally, you guys have ruined us. We've decided to give up comics and we're going into showbiz.
