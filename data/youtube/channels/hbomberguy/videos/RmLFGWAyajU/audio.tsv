0	4800	We'll try to explain our thinking on how we're coming across and why we're doing overkill the way it is.
4800	6000	You can think and draw at the same time?
6000	6500	Yeah.
6500	10800	And especially if it's gonna be overkill, his equipment's gotta be overkill as well.
10800	11500	Oh, heck yeah.
11500	15100	Always remember, always remember, he's tough, but he's not violent.
15100	19000	Along those lines, he's got the biggest shoulder pads ever existed.
19000	20500	I figured he would.
20500	24000	Okay, I'm gonna give him, I'm gonna give him some big knee pads here,
24000	27800	because a guy like him that's got some armor and got some guns and stuff like that,
28800	30800	Boy, he looks grim, doesn't he?
30800	34800	Kids, you know, I mean, the kids, the kids like the dark, moody stuff, I mean,
34800	35800	They seem to, yeah.
35800	38800	But I have a question I've been wanting to ask you guys.
38800	42800	How long does it take these people to get dressed, these kind of characters?
42800	43800	Who says they undress?
43800	47800	I mean, they're something, they have to get out quickly to save the world,
47800	50800	but it takes them an hour and a half to get into all of this stuff, because they work fast.
50800	53800	That's right, getting into the costume is like going to the bathroom in a comic book.
53800	57800	You never show it, but you assume that Superman and Batman and Spider-Man
57800	59800	actually do go and urinate every now and then, right?
59800	61800	Right, but you never do show it, do you?
61800	62800	No.
64800	67800	But you do show, very often you show people getting dressed, especially women,
67800	69800	I seem to recall that now and then.
69800	71800	Do you draw hands? Are you into hands?
71800	72800	Oh, yeah, I'm the best.
72800	73800	You do hands?
73800	78800	Why don't we give them, here, wires coming out here, coming down.
78800	79800	Oh, they love that stuff.
79800	80800	The kids love wires.
80800	81800	The wires that he'll triple.
81800	82800	Oh, yeah, yeah.
83800	84800	Hey, you draw good wires.
84800	85800	Oh.
86800	90800	Does he have a double identity? Is he really a meek accountant in real life?
90800	92800	Who else could he be besides Overkill?
92800	96800	Well, I mean, when he takes off all these clothes, is he a 87-pound weakling?
96800	98800	Do you see him taking a rough fist?
98800	99800	Okay.
99800	100800	Okay.
100800	105800	His thumb, he would have three different cannons that are facing you for the large kapooey.
106800	107800	So, right here.
107800	110800	They could be, like, missile launchers or whatever, but he's going to have those right over here.
110800	114800	What makes you make those value judgments? Why only three? He's got four knuckles.
114800	115800	Because the reader's crazy.
115800	117800	Why does he have more on that side than that side?
117800	118800	No, no.
118800	124800	For the sake of our unseen viewers, is this really the type of thought process that you guys go through when you create characters?
124800	126800	Yes, except for we have more than 20 minutes.
127800	129800	We're using probably longer than you usually do.
129800	133800	Well, I think I've got to say, seriously, which isn't easy for me to do,
133800	138800	but I think it's very impressive that in a matter of 20 minutes, you guys could come up with something like this.
138800	142800	I mean, bad as it is, it's still impressive that you were able to do it this quickly.
142800	143800	Yeah, that's a cool logo.
143800	146800	Rob, didn't you promise that you would draw and we would do the talking?
146800	147800	I'm sorry.
147800	150800	And when you grow up a little more, you know, we'll let you in there with the grown-ups.
150800	154800	When you were creating characters, Stan, what was the process back then?
154800	158800	I mean, because Rob and I right now, we do our own writing and our own drawing.
158800	161800	We don't collaborate with anybody anymore, so...
161800	164800	That's the problem, and I've been meaning to talk to you guys about that.
164800	166800	Boy, he is one grim-looking guy.
166800	168800	There's no way this man can move.
168800	171800	He's got to have a power to defy gravity, I would say, just looking at him.
171800	173800	He's a tank. I mean, what do you think?
173800	178800	Now, the funniest thing would be if you say that these are jets and he's the fastest man alive.
178800	182800	We've got to justify all of this paraphernalia somehow.
182800	186800	I don't know that you're really doing my character right.
186800	189800	That's all right, I guess, for such beginners.
189800	193800	We have a minute and a half or so. I want to tighten those feet.
193800	194800	All right, guys?
194800	197800	Give him an ankle bone here, an ankle bone here.
199800	202800	I think it takes you longer to sign your name than to do a picture.
202800	203800	Heck yeah, it is.
203800	205800	I'm going to step out, okay?
205800	209800	Incidentally, you guys have ruined us. We've decided to give up comics and we're going into showbiz.
