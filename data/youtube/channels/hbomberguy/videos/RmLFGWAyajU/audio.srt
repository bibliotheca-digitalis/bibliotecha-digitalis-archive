1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
We'll try to explain our thinking on how we're coming across and why we're doing overkill the way it is.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,000
You can think and draw at the same time?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Yeah.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,800
And especially if it's gonna be overkill, his equipment's gotta be overkill as well.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,500
Oh, heck yeah.

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,100
Always remember, always remember, he's tough, but he's not violent.

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,000
Along those lines, he's got the biggest shoulder pads ever existed.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,500
I figured he would.

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,000
Okay, I'm gonna give him, I'm gonna give him some big knee pads here,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,800
because a guy like him that's got some armor and got some guns and stuff like that,

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,800
Boy, he looks grim, doesn't he?

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
Kids, you know, I mean, the kids, the kids like the dark, moody stuff, I mean,

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
They seem to, yeah.

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,800
But I have a question I've been wanting to ask you guys.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,800
How long does it take these people to get dressed, these kind of characters?

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,800
Who says they undress?

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,800
I mean, they're something, they have to get out quickly to save the world,

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,800
but it takes them an hour and a half to get into all of this stuff, because they work fast.

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,800
That's right, getting into the costume is like going to the bathroom in a comic book.

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,800
You never show it, but you assume that Superman and Batman and Spider-Man

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,800
actually do go and urinate every now and then, right?

22
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,800
Right, but you never do show it, do you?

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,800
No.

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,800
But you do show, very often you show people getting dressed, especially women,

25
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,800
I seem to recall that now and then.

26
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,800
Do you draw hands? Are you into hands?

27
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,800
Oh, yeah, I'm the best.

28
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,800
You do hands?

29
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Why don't we give them, here, wires coming out here, coming down.

30
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,800
Oh, they love that stuff.

31
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
The kids love wires.

32
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,800
The wires that he'll triple.

33
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
Oh, yeah, yeah.

34
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
Hey, you draw good wires.

35
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
Oh.

36
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,800
Does he have a double identity? Is he really a meek accountant in real life?

37
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,800
Who else could he be besides Overkill?

38
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,800
Well, I mean, when he takes off all these clothes, is he a 87-pound weakling?

39
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Do you see him taking a rough fist?

40
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,800
Okay.

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Okay.

42
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,800
His thumb, he would have three different cannons that are facing you for the large kapooey.

43
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
So, right here.

44
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,800
They could be, like, missile launchers or whatever, but he's going to have those right over here.

45
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,800
What makes you make those value judgments? Why only three? He's got four knuckles.

46
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800
Because the reader's crazy.

47
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,800
Why does he have more on that side than that side?

48
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
No, no.

49
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,800
For the sake of our unseen viewers, is this really the type of thought process that you guys go through when you create characters?

50
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Yes, except for we have more than 20 minutes.

51
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,800
We're using probably longer than you usually do.

52
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Well, I think I've got to say, seriously, which isn't easy for me to do,

53
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,800
but I think it's very impressive that in a matter of 20 minutes, you guys could come up with something like this.

54
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,800
I mean, bad as it is, it's still impressive that you were able to do it this quickly.

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
Yeah, that's a cool logo.

56
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Rob, didn't you promise that you would draw and we would do the talking?

57
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,800
And when you grow up a little more, you know, we'll let you in there with the grown-ups.

59
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,800
When you were creating characters, Stan, what was the process back then?

60
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,800
I mean, because Rob and I right now, we do our own writing and our own drawing.

61
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,800
We don't collaborate with anybody anymore, so...

62
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,800
That's the problem, and I've been meaning to talk to you guys about that.

63
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
Boy, he is one grim-looking guy.

64
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
There's no way this man can move.

65
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,800
He's got to have a power to defy gravity, I would say, just looking at him.

66
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
He's a tank. I mean, what do you think?

67
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,800
Now, the funniest thing would be if you say that these are jets and he's the fastest man alive.

68
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,800
We've got to justify all of this paraphernalia somehow.

69
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,800
I don't know that you're really doing my character right.

70
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,800
That's all right, I guess, for such beginners.

71
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,800
We have a minute and a half or so. I want to tighten those feet.

72
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,800
All right, guys?

73
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Give him an ankle bone here, an ankle bone here.

74
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,800
I think it takes you longer to sign your name than to do a picture.

75
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Heck yeah, it is.

76
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,800
I'm going to step out, okay?

77
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Incidentally, you guys have ruined us. We've decided to give up comics and we're going into showbiz.
