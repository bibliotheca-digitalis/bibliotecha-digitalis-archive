1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
This video is an offshoot from the video I made about Bloodborne.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,200
I realized partway through recording it that attempts to defend and talk up Dark Souls 2

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,280
were worming their way into the Bloodborne video,

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,520
so instead of making the Bloodborne video even longer,

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,880
I decided to cut those parts out and then put them in their own video.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,280
Then I realized this video made no sense

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,160
because it was just a mishmash of stuff lifted from a different video

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,680
pasted together without context,

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,360
so I remade it all, which took bloody ages.

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,440
This game is unfairly maligned.

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,280
I think Dark Souls 1 was incredible,

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,040
and people who really liked that one had kind of unrealistic expectations

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,000
and got inevitably burned by the sequel being different

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,240
or failing to be as spectacular and new as its predecessor when it came out.

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,800
Judging it as a game, I think it's really good.

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,400
It's not as good as Bloodborne,

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,760
but it's a little bit...

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,000
It's a little bit better than Dark Souls 1.

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,480
Oh, I mean, in my opinion, it's a little bit better than Dark Souls 1.

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,920
Okay, it's about as good as Dark Souls 1,

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,440
but it has some differences I prefer.

22
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,400
Okay, it's not as good as Dark Souls 1,

23
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,200
but the changes were an interesting and useful risk

24
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,760
that's more valuable existing than not existing

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,160
and is genuinely better than just getting more of Dark Souls 1,

26
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,960
which we already have and you can still just go back to and play if you want to.

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,160
And I personally think I had more fun with it.

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,680
I think the Emerald Herald is a better waifu than Guinevere.

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:36,000
â™ª

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,400
We might as well start with a discussion of the health system,

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,200
which I feel is the core building block of the Souls games

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,080
because it dictates the rhythm and structure of the gameplay

33
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,240
and creates the weighty sense of challenge and difficulty the series is known for.

34
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,600
Ironically, it's very easy to just make something hard.

35
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,080
Making a game challenging while also being fun

36
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,360
requires a very dense and carefully arranged interplay of mechanics.

37
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,520
This is the tightrope games have to walk.

38
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,440
How do you make a player feel challenged

39
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,840
so that their success is a rewarding experience

40
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,360
without making them feel overly punished or simply frustrated?

41
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,600
This balance is difficult to execute.

42
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,080
The reason Souls games are difficult in the first place

43
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,480
is because of the way damage works in the games.

44
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,680
If everything was the same,

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,800
but all attacks did a half or a quarter the damage they do,

46
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,640
the game would be fundamentally different,

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,040
less challenging, and less fun as a result.

48
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,680
Things wouldn't be as weighty because the damage wasn't as important

49
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,160
and dodging wouldn't feel as necessary and so on.

50
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,000
This is why a lot of first-person shooters

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,960
have a difficulty mode they explicitly recommend over the others

52
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,800
because games usually manipulate difficulty

53
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,120
by making the damage sliders be higher or lower

54
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,000
and in most games there's a specific amount of damage

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,240
attacks are most enjoyable to be working with.

56
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,000
Souls games have no difficulty setting

57
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,720
because there's almost no way to make the game easier

58
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,920
without fundamentally altering the thing that makes the games fun.

59
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,280
In a Souls game, you generally can only take a couple of hits before dying.

60
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,520
Healing, therefore, is an important mechanic.

61
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,440
How do you let the player gain health back?

62
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,280
This is an important mechanic to talk about

63
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,880
because it defines the flow of the rest of the ensuing game experience.

64
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,880
Let's say there was no healing whatsoever

65
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,080
or you healed instantly without there even being an animation

66
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,440
or, as in Bloodborne,

67
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,720
you could heal back damage you took if you retaliated quickly.

68
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,040
These utterly change the rest of the mechanics

69
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,960
and therefore the rest of the game experience

70
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,160
because they change how the player is led to interact with them.

71
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,040
The guy who gets to decide how players get health back

72
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,680
actually is responsible for more of the game

73
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,320
than the people who design the levels in a weird way.

74
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,240
Souls games have done this a variety of ways

75
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,720
with a variety of impacts on core gameplay.

76
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,040
In Demon's Souls, you healed by using different kinds of grass you found or purchased.

77
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,240
Stopping to grab a bite, however, was very slow and deliberate

78
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,080
and it stopped you dead in your tracks.

79
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,200
While this is fine if you already beat the thing that damaged you,

80
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,600
in a lot of direct combat situations,

81
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,960
stopping to heal is either not going to work or is going to get you killed.

82
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,880
It's a calculated risk every time

83
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,600
and in boss fights, finding places in the rhythm of the battle

84
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,200
when healing was a good idea

85
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,120
was key to survival for people who couldn't always avoid taking that damage.

86
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,520
There is something of a downside to this, however.

87
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,600
Firstly, while it is very calculated and purposeful and challenging to heal,

88
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,200
should it be?

89
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,080
It's fair, but is it good to be in a situation

90
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,800
where the most pressing thing, trying to heal,

91
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,360
is a really bad idea that would itself kill you?

92
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,720
A lot of early players die while mashing the heal button.

93
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,680
That's not fun,

94
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,200
even if simply not doing that is technically the sound response.

95
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,400
Secondly, in Demon's Souls,

96
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,520
you immediately have access to all the healing items you'll ever need.

97
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,120
You can buy as many of them as you want

98
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,000
as soon as the game properly starts and always go back for more

99
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,080
and they're fairly easy to farm from enemies.

100
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,800
This means that if they master the timing to heal in battle,

101
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,400
they're practically unkillable

102
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,440
and can't be worn down by attrition as they progress to a level.

103
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,640
As long as no one encounter can fully drain your life bar,

104
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,160
which can still happen a lot,

105
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,320
Demon's Souls' difficulty is reduced quite a bit

106
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,240
from where it was probably meant to be.

107
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,800
You technically have access to an infama-

108
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,520
Infama?

109
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,480
Infinite amount of life as long as you use it properly.

110
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,000
Dark Souls replaced this health system entirely with the Estus Flask,

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,560
a healing item which you couldn't buy more of.

112
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,160
You had a limited amount of uses

113
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,880
which recharged at bonfires or when you died.

114
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,600
Yes, I know you can also get health back by using a humanity,

115
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,520
but doing that burns such a rare resource

116
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,080
that I couldn't really regard it as a source of healing

117
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,200
unless you're one of those good-at-Dark-Souls people I've heard so much about.

118
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,560
This meant you had a finite amount of life at any given time.

119
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,800
This also means attrition becomes a factor.

120
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,280
Damage you take is health you aren't getting back

121
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,360
until you reach a place that restores Estus.

122
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,000
This can make the game more interesting and more risky.

123
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,480
It also means that there's a net maximum amount of times

124
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,440
you can possibly be hit by enemies or a boss in a single run.

125
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,400
In this regard, Dark Souls is tremendously more difficult,

126
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,920
but also more satisfying because of the new element of challenge it adds.

127
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,880
However, you're still left basically prone while you do it,

128
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,960
and it still takes just long enough that getting killed

129
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,680
while trying to heal is an annoying and common possibility.

130
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,280
And it means if you're on a run to a boss

131
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,960
and you take a certain amount of damage,

132
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,280
you feel like you're already doomed on this run

133
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,800
because there's no way you can get past them

134
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,400
with that little health remaining,

135
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,880
so you have to go back or just go on a doomed run

136
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,480
and die and come back again.

137
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,560
And that can kind of wear down your ability

138
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,280
to keep playing the game and enjoy it,

139
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,040
which is a big deal in games.

140
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,720
Dark Souls 2, in my opinion, fixes some of this pretty well.

141
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,720
Firstly, it takes an age to drink again,

142
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,120
making it even more deliberate than the Demon's Souls one,

143
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,840
and your health actually recovers over a very short amount of time

144
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,120
instead of instantaneously.

145
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,600
This forces the player to not even consider healing

146
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,800
until they're free and clear

147
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,840
because there's no chance they'll just get the Estus to their lips

148
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,600
before getting hit and stay alive.

149
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,160
Ironically, by being even more slow and deliberate,

150
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,880
it further disencourages the thing that causes annoyance

151
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,440
when it doesn't work, dying while trying to heal.

152
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,040
However, Dark Souls 2 also supplements this with life gems.

153
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,960
Life gems are a little bit like the grass,

154
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,680
down to being purchasable and coming in numerous sizes.

155
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,760
They take a while to use, and they heal over time very slowly.

156
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,520
This is genius.

157
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,520
You see, attrition isn't necessarily a fun kind of challenge.

158
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,120
It can create a nice feeling

159
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,320
and a risk that you'll be worn down too far to make it anywhere,

160
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,760
but you know what isn't fun?

161
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,360
Knowing you're definitely fucked

162
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,680
because you'll most likely lose the remaining health you have

163
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,040
before you get anywhere new.

164
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,600
Knowing you're at the limit your healing can possibly take you

165
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,680
with your abilities and you're just not good enough

166
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,080
and you're gonna have to keep playing this area over and over

167
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,160
or go farming and level up or something.

168
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,640
By bringing back theoretically infinite health

169
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,640
but making it heal very slowly,

170
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,200
the creators have introduced a way to get around this annoyance

171
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,440
without making the player feel totally invincible.

172
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,280
They also have tactical uses.

173
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,440
Since they take a while to use and are slow,

174
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,040
they're risky to use in fights,

175
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,360
but if you're good at not immediately dying,

176
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,640
they still heal you,

177
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,680
so you can run out of Estus and still have access to a source of healing

178
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,760
that requires some skill to use effectively,

179
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,200
which is kind of cool and smart.

180
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,680
They're also useful for if you expect to take damage

181
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,480
but don't think you'll be able to stop and heal later.

182
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,280
In some boss fights, using a gem when you get the chance

183
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,760
and then attacking means you'll get some health back

184
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,440
even if you get hit a bit later.

185
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,200
This is frankly a welcome addition.

186
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,680
I've heard the criticism that the addition of life gems

187
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,560
utterly destroys the delicate balance of the entire game

188
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,280
and it's erased the majesty of the Estus flask

189
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,800
and its purposeful limitation of a player's maximum amount of mistakes.

190
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,440
This, in a sense, is an accurate analysis.

191
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,520
The balance is shifted.

192
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,600
However, it's shifted in favor of the player

193
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,640
in a way that's overall positive for the experience.

194
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,280
Bloodborne probably does the best with its use of healing.

195
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,640
Blood vials are simultaneously infinite and finite.

196
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,320
You can buy a bunch quite easily

197
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,640
but only have 20 on hand at any time.

198
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,960
The more you find in a level are immediately usable

199
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,640
if you had less than 20 on you,

200
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,360
so you can use more than 20 if you use one in a fight

201
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,120
and then one drops from a corpse later,

202
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,320
which happens fairly often.

203
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,600
The healing is also quicker

204
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,400
and you have a lot of control over movement while you do it.

205
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,360
This is good.

206
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,440
I just talked about how good it was being made tactical

207
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,640
the way it was in 2,

208
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,400
but ultimately, as a mechanic,

209
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,720
I think it's more enjoyable to be able to heal quickly

210
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,400
because dying while healing

211
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,240
or dying because you were unable to heal

212
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,000
because tactically it would have killed you

213
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,600
is just never fun or interesting.

214
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,840
If I was to grade all four games' healing methods,

215
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,240
I would put Dark Souls last here

216
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,480
because I don't personally think its method of attrition

217
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,880
is all that fun when it comes down to it

218
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,960
and the precise amount of time it takes to heal

219
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,560
and the way it immobilizes you

220
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,720
makes it always a tantalizing risk

221
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,800
you think you might just be able to make,

222
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,240
which means more players die

223
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,320
trying to heal in this game than any other.

224
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,680
I think Dark Souls 2 is the second best behind Bloodborne

225
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,840
and, hey, that's pretty good.

226
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,880
â™ªâ™ª

227
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,520
One criticism I see made a lot about Dark Souls 2

228
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,760
is that a lot of the bosses and also a lot of enemies

229
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,000
are what amounts to humanoid people in armor.

230
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,920
This isn't just an aesthetic complaint.

231
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,120
It's also a problem in the sense

232
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,560
that a lot of the fights with enemies

233
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,640
amount to learning how they swing a weapon,

234
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,920
how to get past their weapon,

235
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,440
and which direction their swings go.

236
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,200
And since there's a finite amount of ways

237
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,640
a humanoid can swing a sword,

238
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,560
it's possible to even start confusing enemies

239
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,920
and their attacks for each other.

240
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,600
A lot of bosses are very similar,

241
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,640
unlike the previous game,

242
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,720
which has more of a variety of unique bosses

243
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
like the gaping dragon or Nito

244
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,040
or Seath the Scaleless breaking up the monotony.

245
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,360
And indeed, there are quite a lot of humanoid opponents

246
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,840
who fight with swords in what amounts to a duel.

247
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,800
But here's the thing.

248
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,400
I'm gonna make a different argument here.

249
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,680
I'm not gonna argue that the bosses

250
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,960
are all sufficiently different,

251
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,400
which, in my opinion, they are,

252
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,640
or that there are plenty of different kinds of boss fight

253
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,840
breaking up the monotony,

254
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,040
which there is,

255
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,520
but instead I'm going to play the wild card

256
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,280
and be the needless contrarian that people say I am.

257
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,160
I'm gonna argue in favor of dudes in armor.

258
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,320
I think the best kinds of fight in games

259
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,240
are against enemies on roughly equal footing

260
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,040
with the player.

261
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,960
All games, not just Souls games.

262
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,720
There's something viscerally satisfying

263
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,920
about facing off with someone

264
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,080
making use of the same skill set as you.

265
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,760
The best boss fights in Devil May Cry

266
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,600
are the fights against Vergil or Dante

267
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,280
or another human-sized opponent

268
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,800
with another ridiculous sword.

269
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,240
The best boss fight in God Hand

270
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,760
and also gaming history

271
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,880
is against Azel, who has the Devil Hand, and so on.

272
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,040
It's far more compelling to fight a person

273
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,600
making use of skills you yourself could be using

274
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,440
than someone with far more powers than you

275
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,600
or who is an incomprehensible mess.

276
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,840
It feels good, to put it simply.

277
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,160
Dark Souls had a couple of regular enemies in the game

278
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,440
who scratched this itch for me,

279
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,000
like, uh, the NPC invasions,

280
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,200
like Manny to Mildred,

281
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,320
uh, Lautrec,

282
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,160
the crestfallen guy when he goes hollow,

283
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,160
or Oscar when you return to the asylum,

284
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,040
or Rickard.

285
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,560
These kinds of fight are the best

286
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,920
and most memorable.

287
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,440
In fact, I just remember those offhand.

288
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,640
I didn't even put those in the script.

289
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,680
I just decided to list them

290
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,880
because I just know them all.

291
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,560
PvP is so fun in these games

292
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,080
for this exact reason.

293
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,320
You're fighting people on the same footing as you

294
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,920
with access to the same resources.

295
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,640
It's just great.

296
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,760
It's- it's a puzzle

297
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,120
where you all pick your poison

298
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,560
and then you fight to see who is poisoned the most.

299
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,120
Um...

300
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,800
But in Dark Souls, the only boss fight

301
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,760
that comes really close to getting this right

302
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,760
is Artorias in the DLC.

303
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,720
Ornstein and S-

304
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,520
mmm...

305
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,400
kind of did it,

306
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,960
but you were too busy dealing with the other guy,

307
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,520
uh,

308
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,960
so you could never really focus

309
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,920
on the aspect of the fight

310
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,320
that's like this straightforward, cool duel, you know?

311
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,360
And then they get really big

312
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,960
and then it becomes a very different kind of thing.

313
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,360
Artorias is a really, really good fight.

314
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,280
He's not exactly on equal footing with you.

315
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,280
He's presented as a very strong person,

316
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,720
larger than life, literally,

317
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,920
corrupted by evil,

318
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,280
but he's a brilliant fight

319
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,280
because he never comes off as ridiculous.

320
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,520
He even dodges and rolls the way a person would.

321
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
You get this fantastic mix of outsmarting

322
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,720
a fellow consciousness

323
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,320
trying to beat you in a straight fight,

324
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,600
Before Dark Souls 2,

325
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,360
I would describe Knight Artorias

326
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,280
as the platonic ideal

327
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,880
of a Dark Souls boss fight.

328
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,760
It's the most pared-down, purified form

329
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
of single combat

330
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,080
with another swordsman in the Souls games,

331
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,520
and that's really, to me,

332
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,600
the best thing.

333
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,160
Dark Souls 2 has a lot more of this kind of fight

334
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,360
than the previous two games

335
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,720
and more than Bloodborne also,

336
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,640
and this, I must stress for me,

337
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,840
this is my opinion,

338
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,800
is a gift.

339
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,320
The pursuer, the lost sinner,

340
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,760
the looking-glass knight,

341
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,560
Velstadt,

342
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,160
and in the DLCs, the Fume Knight

343
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,400
and Sir Valon and the Burnt Ivory King.

344
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,680
In my opinion,

345
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,320
these fights are what the Souls games' mechanics

346
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,000
are vessels for.

347
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,240
This is what the game should be built around.

348
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,080
There's even the old Dragon Slayer,

349
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,160
a version of the Ornstein and Smurfs fight

350
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,840
that indulges in this aspect

351
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,240
more than fighting two people at once could do.

352
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,440
I remember telling my friends

353
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,600
that I'd wished there'd been a one-on-one fight

354
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,960
with a character like Ornstein,

355
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,880
perhaps as a mini-boss later on,

356
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,960
and those friends played the PS3 version of 2

357
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,800
while I waited for it to come out on PC.

358
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,480
The first thing they did when it came out

359
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,360
was tell me where to go for a cool surprise over Skype,

360
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,320
and I got the fight I'd wanted from the previous game.

361
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,520
I'm sure people complained

362
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,640
that this was a needless rehash or fan pandering,

363
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,840
but it was literally a fight

364
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,920
I specifically thought would have been fun

365
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,520
and missed not having,

366
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,240
and I'm glad someone working on Dark Souls 2

367
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,120
agreed with me.

368
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,800
Honestly, when I saw early critics saying,

369
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,920
Dark Souls 2 is pretty great,

370
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,840
but you fight a lot of dudes in armor,

371
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,840
I remember immediately thinking,

372
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,800
hell, yes.

373
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,000
There are other kinds of fight,

374
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,120
and it's good to have them,

375
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,320
but they are the best.

376
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,160
Perhaps one of the worst things

377
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,160
about Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1

378
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,640
is they didn't properly master this idea yet.

379
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,800
Demon's Souls had the penetrator, don't laugh,

380
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,440
and some decent NPC fights like Garl Vinland,

381
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,920
the actual final boss of the Valley of Defilement.

382
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,600
I mentioned the ones Dark Souls had,

383
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,720
but 2 elevated these fights to their proper place

384
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,120
as the core kind of fight you did the most,

385
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,320
and I love it for that.

386
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,560
The Heide Knights are criminally underrated.

387
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,640
They deliberately look and fight very differently

388
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,480
from the Black Knights of Dark Souls 1,

389
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,520
and if you let them get up,

390
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,240
which you should do,

391
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,600
because why else are you attacking them?

392
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,200
They sit down and do nothing on purpose

393
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,560
until you want to fight them.

394
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,240
The fight is usually pretty cool.

395
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,360
They kill me a lot,

396
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,920
so I can't show me beating them here really easily,

397
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
which would have been nice footage to have,

398
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,880
but, um...

399
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,080
The narrative critics create

400
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,360
when they talk about dudes in armor

401
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,520
is that the developers ran out of ideas,

402
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,000
but with just a slight change in perspective,

403
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,520
it becomes clear that the developers

404
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,120
had a really good new idea,

405
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,040
which was to use more of a kind of fight

406
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,920
that was vastly underutilized in previous games

407
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,360
and worked really well.

408
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,880
Does that really count as a new idea?

409
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,800
Yeah, sure.

410
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,400
Well, I'm gonna claim it is, at least,

411
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,760
and you can't stop me.

412
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,080
It's a fundamental change in the makeup of the game,

413
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,760
and in my opinion, it's for the better.

414
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,840
That's not to say that's the only kind of boss fight, though.

415
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,560
Like in Dark Souls,

416
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,160
there are plenty of different kinds of fight

417
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,120
breaking up the monotony

418
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,840
against bigger bosses like the Last Giant.

419
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,520
Uh, there's unique, one-of-a-kind fights

420
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,000
like the one with Scorpioness Nagica

421
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,600
who visually resembles Quelaag

422
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,440
but is a very different kind of fight,

423
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,080
but there's all kinds.

424
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,120
There's the Royal Rat Vanguard,

425
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,000
there's the Congregation,

426
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,280
there's the Covetous Demon,

427
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,160
there's, uh, Mr. Chariot,

428
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,440
and there's the Dark Lurker

429
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,160
if you couldn't be bothered to go do all the stuff

430
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,840
that you need to do to fight him,

431
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,640
which I couldn't,

432
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,080
so I didn't get any footage of it.

433
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,200
I've also heard the criticism

434
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,320
that there are too many bosses

435
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,080
that consist of fights with large groups,

436
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,000
and this is proof of the game's poor design.

437
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,640
Similar problems extend to other boss fights,

438
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,160
which seem to follow the mantra,

439
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,600
if you can't make it good,

440
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,680
make it difficult by adding more stuff.

441
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,760
This is Matthew Matosis.

442
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,680
His Dark Souls 2 critique video came out

443
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,520
just over a month after the release of the game

444
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,120
in April 2014.

445
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,880
It blew up somewhat on the internet,

446
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,240
to the point that a lot of the times

447
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,920
I see someone in person or online

448
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,360
talking about Dark Souls 2,

449
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,640
they're often using criticisms

450
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,000
that can be heard in this video,

451
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,280
and many who don't like the game

452
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,760
will cite it as a source for their explanation of why.

453
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,760
In fact, when asking viewers for criticisms

454
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,600
that they would want to see me respond to,

455
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,200
the bulk of them linked this video,

456
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,640
and most of the people that didn't

457
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,080
did so because they knew for certain

458
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,840
I would have already seen this one by now.

459
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,200
We're dealing with a piece of criticism

460
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,560
that had, in its own way,

461
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,920
quite a fundamental impact

462
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,440
on discourse surrounding the game.

463
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
The arguments got copied, repeated, referenced,

464
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,400
and in many ways, I think,

465
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,000
the prevailing dismissive attitudes

466
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,440
towards the game's quality

467
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,920
started to crystallize as a result of this video.

468
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,920
That's not to say the video is literally to blame

469
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,840
for negativity towards Dark Souls 2,

470
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,360
but regardless, it is necessary

471
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,480
that this critique be defeated and destroyed at all costs.

472
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,920
The mechanics of the Souls games

473
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,840
are built for one-on-one engagements

474
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,600
thanks to its slow attack animations

475
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,760
which are uninterruptible once they start,

476
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,800
and a lock-on camera

477
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,120
which focuses heavily on a single foe.

478
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,280
This early criticism is an interesting one.

479
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,200
The claim is that adding more enemies into the game

480
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,560
and also into some boss fights

481
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,960
is a lazy attempt to increase difficulty,

482
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,840
and that this is bad

483
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,680
because Souls games are specifically designed

484
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,080
to work best against single-enemy encounters.

485
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,240
Matthew Matosis is entitled to his opinion,

486
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,520
and I respect that,

487
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,200
but here's why this is a lie.

488
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,800
There are absolutely ways of dealing

489
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,320
with larger numbers of crowds.

490
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,080
It just requires different behavior

491
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,440
than how you normally deal with enemies

492
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,880
when there's just one or two.

493
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,960
Crowd control is a different skill

494
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,880
than the one that you're normally required to test,

495
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,560
but it's one that's worth testing

496
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,400
and really isn't in previous games.

497
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
I remember God Hand being criticized

498
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,920
for having too many enemies for an engine

499
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,080
that was claimed to only really work best

500
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,360
in one-on-one fights,

501
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,880
but you can look up people playing it

502
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,960
and see there's plenty of crowd control,

503
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,280
but not if you always play the way you do

504
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,040
against just one opponent at a time.

505
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,600
Take the prowling Magus fight, for example.

506
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,520
If you want to kill one of the crawling undead

507
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,560
littering this fight,

508
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,320
your eyes need to be taken off the casters

509
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,080
at the back in order to lock on.

510
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,600
Ah, you see, here's your problem.

511
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,760
Matthew makes the supposedly obvious criticism

512
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,840
that locking on makes it hard to see your enemy

513
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,280
so the fight isn't well-designed,

514
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,520
or fights against groups are inherently bad

515
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,280
in this type of game or something,

516
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
but why would you lock on?

517
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,000
You see, the Dark Souls series has this amazing feature

518
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,920
where, using the right stick,

519
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,680
you can rotate the camera

520
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,920
to show anything you want on the screen.

521
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,000
You can manually control the camera yourself.

522
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,200
When you think about it,

523
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,360
his argument actually is that the lock-on system

524
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
works best against single enemies,

525
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,120
and he's right about that,

526
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,960
but that's why you don't lock on

527
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,720
in a fight against multiple enemies.

528
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,240
Arguably, the main lesson you're taught

529
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,920
as early on as the first real areas

530
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,840
is that enemies are attacking from all over the place

531
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,280
and you ought to keep your wits about you

532
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,480
more than just pressing the button

533
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,960
that focuses on one person and hoping for the best.

534
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,640
This is a game that prides itself

535
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,320
on expecting you to look where you're going,

536
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,920
even as far back as the first game

537
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,440
with the guy hiding behind the doorway

538
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,040
and people hiding in corners

539
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,720
even all the way over in Bloodborne.

540
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,520
The lock-on system is a tool to be utilized carefully,

541
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,520
just like every other ability and mechanic.

542
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,320
Matt found the lock-on function was bad in this scenario

543
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,720
and concluded that it was a flaw with the game.

544
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
The challenge in this boss fight, like with the rats,

545
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,600
is to avoid getting swarmed and put into a bad situation

546
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,760
to keep track of yourself and navigate carefully.

547
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,760
If you locked directly onto one of the enemies,

548
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,720
you would have a problem,

549
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,280
and that means you don't do that.

550
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,040
Dark Souls II uses fights like this

551
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,800
and a generally different sort of level design

552
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,240
to teach you that in this world,

553
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,440
sometimes focusing down on a specific individual is a mistake.

554
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,280
Matthew didn't like Dark Souls II as much

555
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,560
because he didn't learn this lesson

556
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,160
and kept trying to play it the exact way

557
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,360
he played the previous two.

558
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,400
He also invokes the time you fight against the two Dragon Riders,

559
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,480
and there's a cute little clip I want to show

560
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,000
where he locks onto one

561
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,920
and then has to angle himself precisely

562
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,120
so he can see the two of them.

563
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,680
The twin Dragon Riders are another example of this.

564
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,520
You want to avoid attacks from both of them

565
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,360
while periodically damaging one of them,

566
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,680
but in order to do so, you need to lock onto one

567
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,120
and position yourself in such a way

568
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,400
so you can see the other.

569
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,120
This clip is meant to show how bad the lock-on system is

570
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,320
in two-person fights

571
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
and therefore how poorly designed this fight is

572
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,000
for putting this guy all the way over there,

573
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,200
but the thing is,

574
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,440
you could just not hit the lock-on button.

575
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,800
You could just not do that.

576
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,640
You can aim the camera wherever you want.

577
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,400
You can still dodge and attack.

578
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,540
You know...

579
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,960
["clicking"]

580
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,040
I looked back over the footage of me doing this fight

581
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,240
and I didn't lock on at all

582
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,280
until one of them was dead

583
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,080
and it became a good idea to completely focus on one enemy.

584
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,440
This naturally occurred to me

585
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,920
because this is how Dark Souls 2 teaches you to play.

586
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,440
I honestly think the mechanics

587
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,920
and the way they're utilized in the first two games

588
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,640
has gotten so ingrained in people who liked those two

589
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,160
that it makes them play weirdly

590
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,680
in games that work slightly differently

591
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,280
or have different kinds of challenge

592
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,120
and this strikes them as a flaw.

593
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,800
I got some criticism on my last video

594
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,440
that it's wrong to say it's possible to play a game wrong

595
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,360
and there's a lot of ways of playing Dark Souls

596
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,640
and they're all equally valid

597
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,480
if that's how the player wants to do it

598
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,000
and, yeah, kinda,

599
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,400
but all I can say is I can definitely see

600
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,640
why Matthew Matosis and other critics

601
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,480
had a less good time with Dark Souls 2

602
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,080
if this is how they approached it.

603
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,800
This looks a whole lot like playing the game wrong

604
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,320
and blaming the game for it.

605
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,080
I still do really bad in this fight, though.

606
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,720
Notice yourself.

607
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,520
Just cut away from this quicker in the final edit.

608
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,840
Also, we need to edit out the part where I say this, please.

609
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,400
Matthew is still trying to use the lock-on mechanic in fights

610
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,800
even as late as the Watcher and Defender bosses

611
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,320
and he's still using a shield.

612
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,440
Aw, bless.

613
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,360
Someone really liked the previous games

614
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,240
and tried real hard not to unlearn what they learned there.

615
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,880
This kind of criticism sheds light on the critical perspective

616
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,800
that approached the game in the first place.

617
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,400
Players who went into the game expecting it to be exactly like the previous ones

618
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,480
inevitably did badly in these sections

619
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,800
and seemingly blamed the game for it.

620
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,280
Joseph Anderson, a critic who put out three videos

621
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,040
about Dark Souls in late 2015

622
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,360
and was much less negative about the game,

623
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,120
similarly doesn't use the lock-on feature

624
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,120
in many of the fights he shows in his video

625
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,080
and, like me, he fought most of them without using a shield either.

626
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,840
In the same manner that shields are fine,

627
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,520
but not if they engender passivity,

628
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,200
the lock-on system is a great mechanic

629
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,920
that can accidentally engender a reliance upon it.

630
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,840
Also, Monster Hunter, a series many regard as very similar in a lot of ways,

631
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,640
has basically no lock-on functionality whatsoever

632
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,600
and the subhuman criminals who love Monster Hunter

633
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,560
seem to do just fine using it to see the enemies however they want.

634
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,280
That's not to say Monster Hunter wouldn't benefit from having one,

635
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,480
but if it did have one,

636
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,480
it would probably be something to use sparingly,

637
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,000
much like in Dark Souls 2.

638
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Also, it's worth remembering that this type of boss

639
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,240
has been present in Souls games for a long time.

640
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,080
You might remember, I don't know, the Phalanx,

641
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,800
uh, the first real boss in Demon's Souls.

642
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,600
It's a fight about balancing the interplay between the actual opponent

643
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,240
and the numerous creatures that break off from it and act independently,

644
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,480
threatening to surround and overwhelm you.

645
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,120
Then, right after, there's the Tower Knight boss fight.

646
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,920
Jeez, the first two bosses in the first game in the series

647
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,400
and both of the muse mechanics Matthew Matosis concluded

648
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,680
are inherently antithetical to the core of the Souls games.

649
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,640
What, did the developers not realize how their game worked?

650
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,080
If I look onto the Archer, I can't see the Tower Knight unless I stand here.

651
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,800
I can't use the function designed for focusing on one person

652
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,920
and see everyone else.

653
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,960
What, did the B-team design this game?

654
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,560
Ahahahahahahaha

655
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,520
[(static)]

656
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,240
Attacks also lock on to an unnecessary degree.

657
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,240
When a boss goes to do an overhead attack,

658
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,000
it will usually track the player up until the very last moment before impact.

659
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,840
When Matthew Matosis makes this comment,

660
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,400
in order to make an example of a superior fight,

661
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,880
he cuts to footage of the Adjudicator,

662
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,880
the...least memorable fight in the entire Souls series?

663
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,400
I forget the Adjudicator exists every time I play Demon's Souls without fail,

664
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,200
and then I go,

665
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,240
oh yeah, this guy,

666
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,720
and I kill him on the first try and forget about him again.

667
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,480
His attacks go for where you used to be 10 minutes ago.

668
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,560
No aspect of this boss should be the model for how fights should work in Souls games.

669
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,680
The simple fact is that in previous entries in the series,

670
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,360
circle strafing enemies has been an easy way to cheese a lot of the game.

671
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,440
Because the enemies focus in on you more,

672
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,240
guess what?

673
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,880
You actually have to dodge some of their attacks now,

674
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,200
using timing and knowledge of the right direction to move

675
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,520
based on judging how the enemy's moving.

676
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,800
A lot of the fights Mr. Matosis, if that is his real name,

677
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,000
uses to make examples of this apparent horrific problem

678
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,400
actually show him mistiming a dodge,

679
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,360
or dodging in the direction of the swing.

680
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,760
I don't think this demonstrates what he thinks it's demonstrating.

681
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,600
Bosses all over the series lock right onto you as their attack goes off.

682
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,200
This happens because on some level,

683
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,600
the game is about learning how and when to dodge

684
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,120
instead of just spinning a circle around someone so they can never hit you.

685
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,200
The amount of lock-on enemies have in this game

686
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,640
is only a problem if you don't know how to dodge attacks.

687
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,280
I honestly think this footage speaks for itself.

688
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,200
Here we're getting into the bedrock of some fundamental differences

689
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,720
in the way Dark Souls 2 is made,

690
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,520
and what it achieves versus the previous game's decisions,

691
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,480
both in terms of gameplay and in terms of storytelling.

692
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,560
Dark Souls is commonly lauded for being one large interconnected world.

693
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,200
I criticized this perception a little in the Bloodborne video,

694
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,680
and because I'm a hack, I'm gonna rehash that here.

695
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,600
Dark Souls' interconnectedness is fun

696
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,000
and creates an interesting sense of being in a real place,

697
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
and it's cool you can find yourself in a real world

698
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,240
and creates an interesting sense of being in a real place,

699
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,800
and it's cool you can find ways of getting from one place to another

700
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,240
and nice little shortcuts,

701
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,800
but it also weakens the game in a lot of ways.

702
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,800
Okay, I know that's contentious.

703
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,880
I'm not stupid. Hear me out here.

704
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,120
It's technically a good thing

705
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,760
that the areas lead across and into each other so much.

706
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,080
Blighttown, for example, is made more interesting

707
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,920
by the fact it connects both the Depths

708
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,080
and the Valley of Drakes and the Great Hollow,

709
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,760
and it leads to Quelaag's domain

710
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,320
and later is used to access the Demon Ruins.

711
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,440
However, let's think for a moment

712
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,920
about level design and encounter design.

713
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,080
When you're designing a world that can be traversed across

714
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,200
to all these different places or even simply back and forth,

715
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,120
in this case, climbing out of Blighttown

716
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,720
once you first kill Quelaag,

717
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,360
you're designing a level that makes compromises

718
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,600
to be usable in all these ways at once.

719
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,440
No enemy encounter can be designed

720
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
to play really well in one direction

721
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,560
because you aren't,

722
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,320
and encounters all have to compensate

723
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,880
for the fact you're gonna be coming back through it the other way.

724
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,160
In fact, at a certain point,

725
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,000
it becomes clear the developers realized

726
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,560
they'd forgotten to fully compensate for this.

727
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,720
The blow dart guys who inflict Toxic on you

728
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,760
are basically unavoidable if you're trying to get out

729
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,560
because of the inevitable ladder climbing you have to do.

730
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,920
So they made them not respawn,

731
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,760
so you only ever have to kill them once,

732
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,360
and therefore, on your way back out,

733
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,960
you probably don't have to deal with them at all

734
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,000
because you killed them all.

735
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,400
But this also severely compromises

736
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,160
the challenge of going down

737
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,680
because it means each blow dart guy

738
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,840
only ever has to be dealt with once.

739
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,680
You can basically just run to them,

740
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,720
die killing them,

741
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,440
and then carry on in a now much easier area.

742
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,800
By having to account for the fact

743
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,960
you're gonna have to come back the other way,

744
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,680
the fun and challenge of going through it

745
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,600
either way is hamstrung.

746
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,280
This is not great design.

747
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,920
You can even see a more ideal version of Blighttown

748
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,360
in Anor Londo.

749
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,480
You can only ever fight these enemies this one way,

750
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,800
and that means this one way's really interesting.

751
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,760
You know?

752
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,880
This section's great.

753
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,360
There's no way to come back the way you came,

754
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,880
but there's also no reason to

755
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,480
because once Anor Londo is beaten,

756
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,520
you unlock the ability to warp between bonfires,

757
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,280
seemingly an acknowledgment that this area

758
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,840
makes no sense going through it backwards to get out.

759
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,520
Plus, at this point in the game,

760
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,360
the developers had definitely realized

761
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,200
that running back and forth between areas

762
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
is actually really tedious.

763
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,680
But because warping wasn't really fully fleshed out

764
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,640
in Dark Souls 1,

765
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,720
there's an awful lot of needless walking.

766
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,320
Walking back to bonfires you already lit

767
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,360
but can't warp to,

768
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,480
walking through long paths,

769
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,920
or walking through still long

770
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,440
but slightly shorter paths

771
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,840
because this one's technically a shortcut,

772
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,840
and then you die and you have to do it again.

773
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,280
It's not good.

774
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,640
It's not the best it could be.

775
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,280
I just want to fight Artorias again.

776
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,000
It's a cool fight,

777
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,840
but there's, like, five minutes of walking

778
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,280
every single time,

779
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,040
even with this shortcut.

780
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,840
And guess what?

781
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,080
If you didn't find the bonfire at the Daughter of Chaos,

782
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,600
which, by the way, why would you?

783
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,480
Because it's a secret hidden behind an illusionary wall.

784
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,480
There's no nearby warpable bonfire

785
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,000
for beating the Demon Ruins.

786
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,240
So, when it's time to go do that bit,

787
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:32,960
guess what?

788
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,160
It's time to go all the way back

789
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,080
through Blighttown again.

790
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,840
Yaaaaaay!

791
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,840
Blighttown was so busy leading down

792
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,840
into Quelaag's Domain and the Demon Ruins

793
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,880
and the Great Hollow,

794
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,040
leading across into the Valley of Drakes,

795
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,640
and leading up into the depths

796
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,840
and its own arse

797
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,560
that it forgot to have particularly good gameplay

798
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,640
or to have any frames.

799
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,600
Hey, check it out.

800
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,240
I didn't even need to invoke Dark Souls 2

801
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,800
to explain why Dark Souls 1's interconnectedness

802
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,240
is bad in a lot of cases,

803
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,200
but I guess I should

804
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,160
since I'm talking about Dark Souls 2.

805
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,920
Dark Souls 2's version of Blighttown,

806
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,720
the Gutter,

807
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,160
is way better designed

808
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,320
because it's built to be journeyed through once

809
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,600
in one direction.

810
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,640
Once you're in the Gutter,

811
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,040
it's literally impossible to climb out, actually.

812
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,160
You would have to warp,

813
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,920
which you can now mercifully do

814
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,040
at the beginning of the game

815
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,720
and between any bonfire.

816
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,680
It's almost like this game

817
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,280
was designed to be played by people

818
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,640
who don't want to fucking

819
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,320
run around in circles for hours,

820
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,520
which is an improvement,

821
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,200
I would say, personally.

822
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,560
There's a lot of sheer drops

823
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,840
and daring leaps.

824
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,520
The enemies can be designed purely

825
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,880
for this one direction

826
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,800
and no other bullshit,

827
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,920
like the beetles,

828
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,840
which one direction are better than.

829
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,200
Enemies only stop respawning

830
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,720
if you've killed them so many times,

831
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,400
it's clear they're not really a problem for you

832
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,560
and you just need to get back to later bits

833
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,920
instead of immediately

834
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,520
never respawning ever again

835
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,800
because the developers knew

836
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,560
they were a bit rubbish.

837
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,480
The treatment of these areas in particular

838
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,760
is emblematicâ€”

839
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,560
I love that wordâ€”

840
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,640
of the game's overall approaches to design

841
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,640
and I'm not gonna tell you which one is better,

842
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,760
but it's obvious.

843
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,360
So far, I've only talked about world design

844
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,040
in terms of the ensuing level design,

845
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,280
but that's not the only thing impacted by that.

846
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,120
There's also an aesthetic component

847
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,880
and this, I think, is an aspect

848
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,720
that most exemplifies the difference

849
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,160
in concerns and goals

850
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,800
between the first two Dark Souls games in particular.

851
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,880
Dark Souls 1's world has, let's call it,

852
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,040
a physical coherency to it.

853
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,400
If you're standing in a high place

854
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,600
and look in a direction,

855
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,120
you will see a place you end up going

856
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,080
later in the game.

857
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,600
The world of Lordran feels like

858
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,000
a physically consistent, objective world.

859
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,400
Here's a 3D model of the Dark Souls 1 world.

860
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,040
Apart from a few very clearly separated sections,

861
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,560
it all physically ties together,

862
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,520
which is pretty cool.

863
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,960
Meanwhile, in Dark Souls 2,

864
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,480
this is far from the case.

865
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,880
Plenty of places don't make visual sense.

866
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,400
You can get to the top of a tower

867
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,240
you physically see in the distance

868
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,680
and you can see how tall it is,

869
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,960
but then at the tippy top,

870
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,400
you find an elevator

871
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,320
and it takes you further up

872
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,600
into nowhere

873
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
and you emerge in a lava land

874
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,280
that couldn't possibly exist.

875
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,400
Theoretically, you could dig

876
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,840
a deep enough hole in the ground

877
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,440
and all the lava would just flow out

878
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,120
into the world below and kill everyone.

879
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,720
Remember the compiled 3D model

880
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,920
of Dark Souls 1?

881
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,760
Here's the model for Dark Souls 2.

882
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,640
["Dark Souls II"-style music playing in the background,

883
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,880
with a fast-paced drum beat,

884
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,160
and a fast-paced drum beat with a fast-paced drum beat

885
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,040
and a fast-paced drum beat with a fast-paced drum beat

886
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,760
and a fast-paced drum beat with a fast-paced drum beat

887
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,760
and a fast-paced drum beat with a fast-paced drum beat

888
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,880
It's just they're in the same place.

889
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,480
The universe of Dark Souls 2

890
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,520
is a nonsensical, free-associative nightmare

891
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,080
in which you find yourself in impossible places,

892
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,000
architecture giving way to other worlds

893
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,120
without warning,

894
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,680
the world itself falling apart,

895
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,760
becoming physically untrustworthy.

896
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,480
It's an Overlook Hotel-style monster.

897
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,440
People have criticized the game for being like this,

898
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,920
but I have a question.

899
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,680
How is this a bad thing?

900
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,800
The sense of mystery this creates was really compelling to me

901
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,320
as I worked my way through the world.

902
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,920
I never knew what I was going to see next

903
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,840
because I literally couldn't see it coming.

904
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,600
Something I enjoyed about Dark Souls 1

905
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,720
was this idea that time itself was beginning to fall apart.

906
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,760
You encountered the spirits of those who came before you and died,

907
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,560
like you could find their armor on presumably their corpses,

908
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,200
and in the DLC, you literally go back in time.

909
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,640
The Age of Fire was ending,

910
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,920
and reality, on some level, was ending with it.

911
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,760
Dark Souls 2 gets to constantly benefit

912
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,320
not only from linearity leading to specific visuals

913
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,160
along with better-planned encounters,

914
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,760
but it's pushed up even further by embracing inconsistency.

915
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,160
The result is that you're constantly parading through places

916
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,920
that feel like they're out of a fantasy film

917
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,520
or an 80s album cover.

918
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,840
Take, for example, the Dragon Shrine right here.

919
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,920
You get this majestic moment of a secret sky castle.

920
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,040
I say that again.

921
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,960
Secret sky castle being revealed to you for the first time,

922
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,200
completely hidden from visibility

923
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,800
until you go up this one elevator.

924
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,560
You get this ridiculously epic, in the traditional sense,

925
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,440
grandiose shot of a majestic, ornate shrine

926
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,960
circled by a dozen dragons

927
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,600
revealing itself to you as you go through a passage.

928
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,360
You can't see the shrine from the ground,

929
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,320
and you can't see any landmarks on the ground below from here.

930
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,680
Concrete cohesiveness is thrown out in favor of a puzzling,

931
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,800
surprising, and beautiful incohesiveness.

932
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,400
We're dealing with two contrasting methods of showing a fantasy world.

933
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,640
I say contrasting because, in my opinion,

934
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,800
neither is inherently superior.

935
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,600
The trouble, I think, is that some either assume this

936
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,720
because the first did,

937
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,880
or simply wanted what the first had.

938
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,920
And that's not quite the same as judging something on its own merits,

939
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,520
but I can still see the point there.

940
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:35,040
["Dark Souls II"]

941
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,600
I've heard the complaint that Dark Souls II is linear.

942
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,960
This is true.

943
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,920
Many critics then go on to say that this makes it worse than Dark Souls,

944
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,440
which was non-linear.

945
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,160
This is treason, and I'll see you in hell.

946
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,000
As we just established, Dark Souls is interconnected.

947
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,920
It is not non-linear.

948
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,000
This is not semantics. This is a big deal.

949
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,880
I swear to God.

950
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,400
You have clear-cut objectives that you have to complete in a set order.

951
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,560
You can technically kill Quelaag first before the bell gargoyles.

952
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,120
You can also ignore the depths if you want to.

953
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,440
But you have to kill these two bosses,

954
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,040
you have to ring two bells,

955
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,800
you have to do Sen's Fortress,

956
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,320
and then you do Anor Londo,

957
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,800
and then you have to collect four Lord Souls to progress,

958
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,040
which you can do in any order if you want,

959
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,560
but you have to do all of them.

960
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,240
This isn't non-linear.

961
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,440
This is a choice of which linear path you take first.

962
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,440
This sense of linearity is disguised by the interconnectedness

963
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,000
and the sense of having to run back and forth through a world

964
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,080
because the warps weren't fully fleshed out,

965
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,920
but that's not non-linearity.

966
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:39,360
That's actually kind of bad design, uh, masking linearity.

967
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,800
At least in Dark Souls II,

968
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,520
you don't technically need to beat all four main bosses

969
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,360
to unlock the entrance to Drangleic.

970
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,120
You can just get a lot of souls.

971
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,360
That's actually way more of an alternative

972
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,520
than any part of Dark Souls I.

973
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,600
For a hugely entertaining comparison,

974
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,560
check out the two AGDQ speedruns of the two games.

975
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,000
Oh, I started with a Master Key so I can kill the two bosses

976
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,800
I have no choice but to kill in a slightly different order

977
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,160
if I want to,

978
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,720
but I'm, uh, I'm not going to

979
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,840
because it turns out the intended way was faster anyway.

980
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,600
Fuck you! I used Bonfire Aesthetics

981
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,960
to kill the Rotten four times

982
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,280
and skip three quarters of the main fucking game.

983
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,120
See you in shit, Dark Souls!

984
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,920
Also, not only could Dark Souls have easily been less linear

985
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,960
if it wanted to,

986
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,960
the game fucking contrives itself

987
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,240
to ensure that it isn't with needless bullshit.

988
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,760
Do you want to beat Seath the Skeletalist

989
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,600
before putting the Lordvessel on the thing?

990
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,720
Nice try, idiot.

991
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,320
Impassable magic fog.

992
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,520
Oh, you just beat Quelaag?

993
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,840
I want to see what's going on in the obvious path past her

994
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,120
that it makes sense to go down

995
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,280
instead of climbing all the way back out immediately.

996
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,240
Well, fuck you!

997
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,160
We put some fucking mist here

998
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,920
because we arbitrarily decided

999
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,200
you don't get to do this stuff.

1000
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,720
You got to do the other things first.

1001
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,000
See you in 10 to 15 hours, you worthless piss hound.

1002
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,760
Do you want to see what Neato's up to?

1003
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,880
Tune in next time whenâ€”

1004
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,200
Go fuck yourself, idiot!

1005
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,840
Do you want to kill the four kings before doing anything else?

1006
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,880
Well, guess what?

1007
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,520
You can.

1008
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,520
You can get their Lord Soul first thing if you want to.

1009
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,520
You just need Artorias' ring from Sif.

1010
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,400
Oh, my goodness.

1011
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,960
There's so much freedom in these games.

1012
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,360
A similar mechanic is used in Dark Souls II,

1013
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,160
but it's with doors that are off the beaten path,

1014
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,440
do not block the most obvious form of progress,

1015
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,960
and you might even forget about them

1016
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,240
until you get the king's ring

1017
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,240
and realize that's the symbol of the king

1018
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,280
they were talking about,

1019
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,040
and it's like you figured out a mystery

1020
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,440
and you get to watch an ancient fantasy door

1021
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,120
slowly unlock when you put it on.

1022
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,640
I like ancient fantasy doors.

1023
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,040
They'reâ€”they're a thing that I'm into.

1024
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,880
That sounds really weird, but I mean that.

1025
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,080
I like cool doors.

1026
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,280
Shut up.

1027
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:35,920
They're nice.

1028
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,800
It's a nice door!

1029
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,400
On top of all of that,

1030
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,920
Dark Souls II has a very different kind of design overall

1031
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,000
with an enhanced focus on player freedom

1032
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,280
in the actual fights,

1033
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,560
which are the things that you spend

1034
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,240
most of the time doing in these games.

1035
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,400
Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1's encounters

1036
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,800
are, in a sense, kind of restrictive.

1037
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,400
Each area and encounter,

1038
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,160
by which I mean distinguishable fight

1039
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,680
between a group in the game,

1040
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,560
exists to test the player in some specific way.

1041
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,480
The Tower Knight exists to test

1042
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,760
how you deal with an encounter

1043
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,040
with one big slow enemy

1044
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,440
supplemented by a multitude of ranged attackers.

1045
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,720
The player can use any items

1046
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,480
they have at their disposal to deal with thisâ€”

1047
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,800
magic, swords, shields, items, or what have youâ€”

1048
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,960
but crucially, the same skill is being tested

1049
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,000
no matter what,

1050
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,480
namely, how you deal with this one situation.

1051
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,920
So no matter what your loadout wasâ€”

1052
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,960
you know, axe, big sword, daggers, magic, arrowsâ€”

1053
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,120
you're either dodging a ridiculous amount of arrows

1054
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,080
to fight this guy,

1055
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,400
or more likely taking out all the archers one by one

1056
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,000
with whatever you happen to have on you

1057
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,680
and then engaging the knight on his own.

1058
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,280
The archers on the walls of Anor Londo

1059
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,480
exist to test how you deal with

1060
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,600
walking down a straight path

1061
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,280
with attacks that can easily knock you off.

1062
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,040
No matter what sort of character you are,

1063
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,680
the same thing is being tested no matter what,

1064
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,280
and you have to employ the same skills

1065
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,720
to get past it no matter what.

1066
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,520
You're literally walking a straight, linear path.

1067
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,200
A lot of the first two Souls games

1068
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,440
are based on putting you in a specific place,

1069
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,440
then throwing a specific thing at you

1070
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,240
and making you deal with it the way they want you to do.

1071
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,200
In Sen's Fortress,

1072
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,040
you're walking between the same sets of traps

1073
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,600
and negotiating the same fortress in the same way

1074
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,600
no matter what character you built.

1075
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,640
In all of these examples,

1076
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,720
the focus is on an enclosed space

1077
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,040
so you can be forced into dealing with the scenario

1078
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,520
the developers want you to engage with.

1079
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,560
Ironically, despite being supposedly way more linear,

1080
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,080
Dark Souls 2 is generally designed

1081
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,920
in a much more free, open way

1082
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,600
in regards to its encounters.

1083
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,840
Encounters take place in a much wider open area

1084
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,360
with a focus on having more space

1085
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,120
to navigate as you see fit.

1086
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,880
Pair ogs on play.

1087
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,720
In this room, there are several knights.

1088
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,520
The knights are very difficult to face as a bunched-up group,

1089
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,080
but if you want, you can lead them out onto the battlements

1090
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,920
where they're unable to attack all at once.

1091
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,760
However, there's a risk of falling off

1092
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,000
and there's a guy in the distance shooting arrows at you.

1093
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,320
The player is encouraged to know where they want to fight

1094
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,680
and make decisions about how to engage in the combat

1095
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,440
beyond knowing when to dodge

1096
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,160
in fights against more manageable amounts of enemies.

1097
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,840
This approach generally extends

1098
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,200
throughout the rest of the game.

1099
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,800
This increases player freedom

1100
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,280
by letting them decide precisely how and where

1101
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,480
to pitch their battles,

1102
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,000
and mobility and positioning

1103
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,240
become much more important aspects of the game.

1104
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,200
Combat is much more free form as a result.

1105
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,480
Archers in the previous games are, let's call it, forceful.

1106
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,320
They're put there, and you have no choice

1107
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,280
but to deal with them.

1108
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,120
They're usually supplementing a different enemy,

1109
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,640
so you either have to deal with them

1110
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,480
while the archers are shooting at you,

1111
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,640
or you have to take time out before that fight

1112
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,760
just to deal with the archers

1113
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,280
before resuming it unhindered.

1114
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,440
And if you die, you have to take the time out

1115
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,880
to deal with the archers yet again,

1116
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,400
along with walking all the way back

1117
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,600
through a gauntlet of enemies,

1118
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,920
which, in these games, always respawn.

1119
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,760
God, that sounds like fun, doesn't it?

1120
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,960
I wonder why, statistically,

1121
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,880
so many people stop playing here.

1122
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,000
I wonder.

1123
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,720
I-I...

1124
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,400
Maybe it's the player's fault.

1125
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,840
Ranged attackers in Dark Souls II

1126
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,520
are tremendously less annoying.

1127
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,120
Take, for example, the ones in the encounter

1128
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,320
I already described.

1129
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,400
The player has the option of engaging the enemy

1130
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,240
in places the archer can't attack you at all,

1131
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,520
but fighting in that area

1132
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,200
has its own particular trade-offs.

1133
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,960
The player gets to decide

1134
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,240
how to deal with the archers

1135
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,000
instead of basically having no choice

1136
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,440
but to continuously dodge them

1137
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,120
because this is THE place

1138
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,800
this fight is supposed to happen,

1139
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800
or painstakingly take them out

1140
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,200
every time you want to do the fight.

1141
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,200
There's archers and other kinds of ranged attackers

1142
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,800
in the Forest of Fallen Giants,

1143
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,240
but there's now room to maneuver

1144
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,160
and move your enemies away from their range

1145
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,400
into different areas with different characteristics.

1146
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,760
Like I said, you get to choose

1147
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,600
how and where to have these fights.

1148
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,080
The open space is better for the clump of enemies,

1149
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,000
but you have to worry about the archer,

1150
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,320
or you can go for the ranged attackers first

1151
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,720
and take the risk of being overwhelmed or caught out,

1152
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,720
but then fight them free from that problem.

1153
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,240
You can chase after the archers here,

1154
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,680
but they'll follow you up the ladder,

1155
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,800
and that'll create a gauntlet,

1156
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,480
which you then have to avoid by jumping down

1157
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,480
or cutting through them.

1158
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,640
This fight can play out a lot of different ways

1159
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,640
based on how you choose to move within it,

1160
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,400
whereas in the previous games,

1161
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,080
it's mostly just you have to do this thing

1162
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,960
first till you'll die,

1163
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,920
and then you dodge the attacks

1164
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,920
and attack them to win,

1165
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,720
and honestly, Dark Souls 2's better.

1166
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,320
Often people have criticized this game

1167
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,800
for having multitudes more enemies to fight at once,

1168
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,360
and this is an artificial inflation of difficulty,

1169
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,120
but the thing is, because of Dark Souls 2's

1170
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,280
vastly different kind of level design,

1171
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,440
this is simply a different kind of challenge

1172
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,280
provided to the player than the previous ones,

1173
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,800
and it's not an insurmountable one.

1174
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
The challenge in areas with tons of dudes

1175
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,360
is in how you deal with tons of dudes at once.

1176
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,400
If you're out of position,

1177
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,880
you'll get displaced and destroyed by the swarm.

1178
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,200
Videos critical of the amount of enemies in Dark Souls 2

1179
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,120
will often show you contextless footage

1180
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,080
of their character surrounded and being ganked to death,

1181
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,000
and look how unfair this is,

1182
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,440
but what they're showing takes place

1183
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,680
after the point where they already messed up

1184
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,600
by letting themselves get utterly surrounded

1185
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,040
like this in the first place.

1186
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,200
The previous games rarely make your strategy

1187
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,880
when it comes to relative positioning

1188
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,720
as crucial as Dark Souls 2,

1189
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,760
but there are a couple.

1190
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,920
My fave is this bridge in Demon's Souls.

1191
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,200
Once you stand here,

1192
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,720
see the guys blocking the end,

1193
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,240
and turn around and realize

1194
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,320
every enemy you failed to kill on the way here

1195
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,320
is now funneling down the other end,

1196
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,040
you're struck with the beautifully tense realization

1197
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,360
that if you don't do something now,

1198
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,560
you're already dead.

1199
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,200
But many of the main areas and boss fights in Dark Souls 2

1200
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,120
draw this aspect into critical focus

1201
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,040
and in a much more freeform way,

1202
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,440
where instead of simply being trapped in a small area,

1203
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,640
you're in a large area

1204
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,680
and have to deal with a group

1205
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,760
that's actively threatening to surround you.

1206
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,640
Instead of the passive challenge of a physical choke point,

1207
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,320
the fight is a reactive challenge

1208
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,160
in the form of a moving set of enemies

1209
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,840
that can easily form a choke point

1210
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,880
with their own movements,

1211
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,720
which you can then deal with however you like.

1212
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,120
Fights against groups can play out totally differently

1213
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,720
based on how you fight in them,

1214
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,240
and that's just really cool.

1215
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,840
When a friend was playing through Dark Souls 1

1216
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,880
and asking for help,

1217
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,400
I would just tell them literally the thing

1218
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,920
they were meant to do to get past that area,

1219
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,840
because usually there was one main way,

1220
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,720
and if you didn't know what it was,

1221
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,440
it would kill you.

1222
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,320
In Dark Souls 2,

1223
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,160
the same friend never had to ask for advice

1224
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,920
because they were free to figure it out.

1225
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,960
There were other ways through

1226
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,400
based on what things they had with them

1227
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,320
and how they wanted to do that fight.

1228
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,000
It was a lot more interesting

1229
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,480
for players who aren't already mega fans

1230
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,680
of the first Dark Souls game

1231
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,920
and what it specifically did with fights.

1232
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,080
I think people who want to be critical of Dark Souls 2

1233
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,440
can look at the amount of enemies and go,

1234
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,720
ah, they just threw more in,

1235
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,720
but the entire design of the game

1236
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,120
is almost fundamentally different in so many ways

1237
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,000
that I really don't feel like that's an accurate comparison.

1238
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
The Shrine of Amarna has a ton of magic users,

1239
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,920
but they're in an area where firing back at them

1240
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,880
is finally doable,

1241
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,640
unlike the archers in the Tower Knight fight

1242
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,920
or the Demon fight,

1243
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,680
and you can use magic or arrows

1244
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,200
based on what you have with you.

1245
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,320
Dodging them is trivial

1246
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,000
because you can see the attacks coming

1247
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,760
far more than a bunch of tiny arrows,

1248
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,680
and there's plenty of cover you can utilize

1249
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,720
in various different ways

1250
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,680
so you can fight enemies

1251
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,000
while not in the way of magic if you want to.

1252
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,720
The final run to the boss is famously very tough,

1253
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,400
but this is a fairly late game area

1254
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,680
in a Dark Souls game.

1255
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,560
It being hard is kind of the thing

1256
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,560
that you paid to do.

1257
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,480
Also, I just summoned for it.

1258
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,680
It's okay. I don't have a problem with it.

1259
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,800
They usually die during the fight,

1260
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,000
and that makes it interesting

1261
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,840
because it's like you take casualties

1262
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,040
and then you carry on.

1263
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:49,760
I like it.

1264
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,360
I like summoning in these games.

1265
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,640
There's a bunch of purists out there

1266
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:52,960
who are like,

1267
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,320
I never summon for any fights

1268
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,640
because I want to be the best.

1269
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,920
I want to handle them all.

1270
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,000
I mean, sure.

1271
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,440
Yeah, good for you.

1272
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,280
I'm sure it feels tremendously good,

1273
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,240
and it must be really annoying

1274
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:06,800
that there are fights

1275
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,800
that you really, really should summon for,

1276
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,680
but I like having friends

1277
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,920
who join me and do stuff.

1278
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,560
I like that.

1279
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,720
Speaking of having friends,

1280
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,640
Dark Souls 2 lets you have friends.

1281
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,800
There are even rings your character can wear

1282
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,640
that mean it's really easy to single out

1283
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,960
exactly who you want to summon.

1284
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,680
You can have friends in Dark Souls now.

1285
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,440
The network isn't going to melt down.

1286
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,560
You're not going to have to install

1287
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,160
a bunch of third-party mods

1288
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,680
and hope that makes it work.

1289
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,200
The game works now, guys.

1290
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,800
I don't want to be seen to be dismissive

1291
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,120
and just say people who die a lot

1292
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,040
in group encounters are just bad at it

1293
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,440
and their criticism is false.

1294
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,640
That would be really stupid

1295
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,240
to just say out loud like that.

1296
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,640
So instead, I said it over...

1297
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,160
10 minutes.

1298
00:43:52,160 --> 00:44:01,120
â™ªâ™ª

1299
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,240
Some of you might be familiar

1300
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,600
with my video about Bloodborne.

1301
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,360
It kinda revolutionized

1302
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,680
the face of game design for all time.

1303
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,240
Just kidding.

1304
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,320
But it did kind of invent a newish concept,

1305
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,280
at least I think it does.

1306
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,040
I haven't heard anyone else using it before,

1307
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,400
called play conditioning,

1308
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,920
which refers to the way a game

1309
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,960
leads you to play it

1310
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,120
with the execution of its mechanics.

1311
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,960
When a game kills you very easily,

1312
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,240
tells you to prepare to die,

1313
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,200
and hands you a shield,

1314
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,400
and teaches you how to use it,

1315
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,520
you're taught specific rules

1316
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,480
about that game's world

1317
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,520
and it sticks with you.

1318
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,880
The rest of the game experience

1319
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,920
could have been better served

1320
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,520
by a different early approach,

1321
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,360
but you've been quite definitively taught

1322
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,480
a specific one

1323
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,600
and it'll probably be a struggle

1324
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,560
to unlearn it.

1325
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,760
I brought this up in the video

1326
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,040
to make the point that Bloodborne

1327
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,640
quite deftly pushes the player

1328
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,320
into a more frenetic direction

1329
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,600
with a few subtle changes

1330
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,720
to its base mechanics

1331
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,960
and much wider reaching executions

1332
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,240
of those mechanics.

1333
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,400
There is still one or maybe two

1334
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,360
shields in the game,

1335
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,600
but you don't find them for so long

1336
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,440
that you learned not to use them.

1337
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,040
They exist almost to show you

1338
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,200
that you never really needed them.

1339
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,440
The shield engendered passivity.

1340
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,520
That wording's actually kind of genius.

1341
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,200
The game's own item description

1342
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,440
directly blames shields themselves,

1343
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,040
not players for not realizing

1344
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,560
how they're supposed to use them.

1345
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,400
I think that's really clever

1346
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,760
and also an honest admission

1347
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,960
that they kind of messed up

1348
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,160
in Dark Souls 1.

1349
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,840
Some folks disagreed with my comments

1350
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,720
that playing with a shield

1351
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,080
was an inherently wrong,

1352
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,600
slow, overly defensive,

1353
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,720
or boring way to play,

1354
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,240
and I do have to stress

1355
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,600
that's just my opinion.

1356
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,440
You can play the games however you want.

1357
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,720
I'm just describing how the game

1358
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,480
is most fun in my opinion

1359
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,680
and the ways I think the game

1360
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,960
leads people to play it

1361
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,000
in those more fun ways

1362
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,040
than the previous ones.

1363
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,480
While Bloodborne is undisputedly

1364
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,520
the master of this,

1365
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,560
Dark Souls 2 does a lot

1366
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,680
of really great things

1367
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,120
with play conditioning also,

1368
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,480
things that other critics dismiss

1369
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,440
as minor tweaks

1370
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,960
or just don't talk about at all.

1371
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,920
In the Bloodborne video,

1372
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,360
my central example was the shield,

1373
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,960
and we might as well start there too

1374
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,760
because people don't

1375
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:50,720
fucking mention this.

1376
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,160
Dark Souls 2 has shields.

1377
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,200
It has plenty of them,

1378
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,080
and they're fine.

1379
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:54,720
They work well,

1380
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,400
and you can get some very defend-y ones

1381
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,600
that do all the stuff you need,

1382
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,640
and you can buff them

1383
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,080
lots of different ways too,

1384
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,520
but here's the thing.

1385
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,360
Only one class

1386
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,360
starts with a shield at all

1387
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,880
in Dark Souls 2.

1388
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,040
In fact, that class, the warrior,

1389
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,520
begins life with a broken sword.

1390
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,320
Every other character

1391
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,360
starts with some semblance

1392
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,560
of a fighting setup.

1393
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,080
The knight has a broadsword,

1394
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,160
the swordsman has two plus one swords,

1395
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,000
the bandit has an axe and a bow,

1396
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:20,800
and so on.

1397
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,080
Starting with a shield

1398
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,440
handicaps you in many ways

1399
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,400
at the start of this game.

1400
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,320
It forces you to use ingenuity

1401
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,360
to get access to a weapon

1402
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,400
that's more viable.

1403
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,400
It's not even that great a shield.

1404
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,000
Other classes having no shield

1405
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
are forced to use dodging or parrying

1406
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,920
or make good use of what they're given.

1407
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,240
This is a tiny, tiny, simple change

1408
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,000
to just starting loadouts,

1409
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,240
but it's fantastic design.

1410
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,600
It alters the shape

1411
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,680
of the entire game experience.

1412
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,920
You're expected, told even,

1413
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,960
to make use of the engine

1414
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,000
in a vastly different way

1415
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,960
from how you're led to think

1416
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,800
you're supposed to play the first game.

1417
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,240
Shields you acquire early on

1418
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,000
don't even block 100% of damage,

1419
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,360
and you don't have much life,

1420
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,520
so blocking is treated as a last resort

1421
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,560
for if you really don't know

1422
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,080
what else to do about an attack

1423
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,760
or haven't learned its timing yet.

1424
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,600
Dark Souls 2 is the first game in the series

1425
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,800
where you started getting players

1426
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,400
who were more casually walking around

1427
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,440
without a shield at all,

1428
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,640
preferring two-handing

1429
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,080
or the new power stance

1430
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,840
added for dual-wielding characters.

1431
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,040
By the time you reach shields

1432
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,400
that actually block lots of damage

1433
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,400
the way early shields did in the first game,

1434
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,680
you've employed a level of skill

1435
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,120
getting to them that means using them

1436
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,480
would be a waste of a good hand

1437
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,240
you could be keeping another weapon in

1438
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,120
or some magic.

1439
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,240
Dodging like this would have seemed

1440
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,400
like a needless, risky waste of time

1441
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,080
to the old me if I had a shield

1442
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,160
and could block the damage perfectly well,

1443
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,680
but it would have been so slow.

1444
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,120
You don't need Dark Souls 2

1445
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,560
to teach you to play this way, obviously.

1446
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,600
You can figure it out

1447
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,720
if you do a lot of practicing

1448
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,080
or look up a lot of YouTube videos

1449
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,680
or do PvP or whatever,

1450
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,520
but being forced to play that way

1451
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,480
by the game

1452
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,560
makes you learn it so much faster.

1453
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,240
Other touches can be seen here, too,

1454
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,200
like parrying.

1455
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,880
In Dark Souls 1, parrying offered

1456
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,480
a brief, clumsy moment

1457
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,680
to get in a riposte.

1458
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,360
Oh, and you can't even do a riposte

1459
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,520
if you're two-handing in Dark Souls 1.

1460
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,000
Thanks, fuckers.

1461
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,840
The sound effect was satisfying

1462
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,880
but hard to make out

1463
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,400
if anything else was happening.

1464
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,400
The window to respond was short

1465
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,680
and the animations that played

1466
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,720
where enemies were parried

1467
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,040
were often really short and vague.

1468
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,720
I didn't parry a lot in Dark Souls 1

1469
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,480
because, frankly, I didn't trust the game

1470
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,240
enough to let me capitalize on it.

1471
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,160
In Dark Souls 2, parrying triggers

1472
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,920
a loud, ultra-cool sound.

1473
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,880
The enemies fall down in a protracted

1474
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,120
dear-god-my-entire-world-is-ending

1475
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,280
animation and stay there for ages

1476
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,040
while they wait for you to capitalize.

1477
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,440
This is, in a word, encouraging.

1478
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,440
You feel like you've made a decisive move

1479
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,440
and might even have already won.

1480
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,720
You feel rewarded for learning

1481
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,000
how an enemy attacks.

1482
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,680
It's obvious you've pulled it off

1483
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,280
and you have plenty of time to react

1484
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,640
to knowing you've done it.

1485
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,080
I felt, like I said,

1486
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,240
encouraged to keep parrying.

1487
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,200
Instead of abandoning it

1488
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,080
after the early levels,

1489
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,120
I only really using it

1490
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,720
on heavily choreographed enemies

1491
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,840
like I did in 1.

1492
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,440
Parrying really only came into its own

1493
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,040
in Bloodborne which handed you a weapon

1494
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,560
specifically for doing it

1495
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,960
and made even monstrous enemies parryable

1496
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,160
but this represents a step

1497
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,440
in the right direction.

1498
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,280
I realized, playing Dark Souls 2,

1499
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,040
that the reason it seemed too hard

1500
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,640
to get to the level of skill

1501
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,920
other people were displaying

1502
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,360
was because getting there required

1503
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,600
lots of time investment and practice

1504
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,640
to get around the fact

1505
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,720
the game itself did a pretty bad job

1506
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,240
of getting you there by itself.

1507
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:18,880
The phrase,

1508
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,720
"'Get good' has been around for ages

1509
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,480
but was massively popularized

1510
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,680
in the Souls community

1511
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,280
and this is because the gulf of skill

1512
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,800
is so wide between new

1513
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,080
and experienced players

1514
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,360
that it's almost impossible

1515
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,200
to help someone get on their level,

1516
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,960
the only advice being, basically,

1517
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,960
to keep playing until they become good

1518
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:35,760
at the game.

1519
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,960
No matter how you look at it,

1520
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,640
the fact the community has trouble

1521
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,400
introducing the game it's built around

1522
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,760
to new players

1523
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,520
constitutes something of a problem

1524
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,440
and this is a problem I feel Dark Souls 2

1525
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,200
solves with some very careful changes

1526
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,000
in its design.

1527
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,040
I said before that I thought

1528
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,320
Dark Souls was incredible

1529
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,240
but I owe that to DS2

1530
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,640
showing me the way to appreciate it properly

1531
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,680
and the way to approach it

1532
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,520
in a way that was actually really fun.

1533
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,520
The blueprint for Bloodborne,

1534
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,120
the blood print, if you will,

1535
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,880
of a lot of creative decisions,

1536
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,400
lies in Dark Souls 2.

1537
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,240
I'm unsure if it directly inspired

1538
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,000
the attitudes to shields and healing

1539
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,680
and level design and so on in Bloodborne

1540
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,960
but even if it didn't,

1541
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,720
the way Bloodborne seemingly builds

1542
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,760
on these ideas for me

1543
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,240
shows that 2 was a step in the right direction

1544
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,880
even if it didn't get everything right.

1545
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,120
Dark Souls 1 is, on a technical level,

1546
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,480
interesting and complex.

1547
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,920
The opening cinematic explains

1548
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,680
the setup of the world of the story.

1549
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,000
Gwyn and Co. mess up the ancient dragons,

1550
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,400
build a society using the power of the soul,

1551
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,560
and people start becoming undead and going mad

1552
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,080
and the empire eventually collapses

1553
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,280
when the flames start to go out

1554
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,040
and Gwyn fucks up trying to fix it.

1555
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,320
But what the player actually does

1556
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,240
is run around a mostly empty world

1557
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,360
killing the people who remain

1558
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,880
so they can open a big door.

1559
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,720
There isn't much actual interaction

1560
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,080
with this story.

1561
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,520
The stuff about everlasting dragons

1562
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,480
and a war to kill them all

1563
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,920
doesn't really have much of an impact

1564
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:00,960
on the story of the player

1565
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,240
killing the people who killed them

1566
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,360
and nicking their souls.

1567
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,600
What the first game excels at is lore.

1568
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,440
In the sense that through item descriptions

1569
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,400
and chance encounters

1570
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,840
with the people who remain in the world

1571
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,280
and are safe to talk to,

1572
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,840
you can learn little tidbits about them as people.

1573
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,040
You can run into a character,

1574
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,480
have a brief conversation,

1575
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,480
and be sure that if you pay attention to the world

1576
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,480
and objects related to them or their people,

1577
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,640
you'll learn something about them and their culture.

1578
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,320
The closest you get to a story

1579
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,240
is a guy saying ring some bells.

1580
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,320
There's an old saying in my family.

1581
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,840
Fuck your family.

1582
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,200
This is the reason for the whole mission.

1583
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,400
Like, you meet this guy who's like,

1584
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,200
you know, my family have this fucked up stupid belief.

1585
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,040
Or another guy saying ring some bells.

1586
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,040
Or a serpent saying, hey, Gwyn was cool.

1587
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,080
Kill his friends.

1588
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,680
Or a different serpent saying,

1589
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,040
Gwyn wasn't cool at all.

1590
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,320
He was really rude.

1591
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,360
Kill his friends.

1592
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,040
The fun of the game comes from figuring out

1593
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,360
a complete picture of what you can find,

1594
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,280
but there isn't really a narrative

1595
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,720
happening for most of it.

1596
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,400
The player isn't really given a chance

1597
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,040
to interact with the important events in this world.

1598
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,320
They're just picking up the pieces

1599
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,920
of stuff that already happened.

1600
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,600
In comparison, to me,

1601
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,240
Dark Souls 2 does something really interesting.

1602
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,640
You get a cool metaphorical sequence in the opening

1603
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,360
where a Darkseid-branded character's family

1604
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,520
melts away under the weight of the curse

1605
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,080
making you live so long you forget everything.

1606
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,080
Already we're given our first proper theme,

1607
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,040
and it works on both the personal and world level

1608
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,680
in that the world is making less and less sense

1609
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,360
because things are falling away,

1610
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,440
which, by the way, coincides really well

1611
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,440
with the fact the world design is like that.

1612
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,880
The story itself, to start with,

1613
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,520
is self-consciously a rehash of the previous game.

1614
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,080
The Emerald Herald tells you you need to face the king,

1615
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,240
and to do that, you need some big souls.

1616
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,160
Oh, cool. Thanks. Nice one.

1617
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,120
So you do that.

1618
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,400
Along the way, you find areas

1619
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,680
and bosses strangely evocative of the previous ones.

1620
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,840
Nadjka is, shall we say, Quelaag-adjacent.

1621
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,640
The gutter is very Blighttown-y, and so on.

1622
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,760
There's a lot of parallels,

1623
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,360
but it's never quite made clear

1624
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,680
that you're explicitly in the same world as Lordran

1625
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,760
or at least not the same places.

1626
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,840
There's just a subtle thing in the back of your head

1627
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,080
about how this all seems oddly familiar.

1628
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,200
So you kill all the enemies,

1629
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,280
and on the way, there are these occasional locked doors.

1630
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,000
There's no explicit sense that you're missing any large areas.

1631
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,760
All the paths terminate in dead ends

1632
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,480
or weird shrines with the primal bonfires in them.

1633
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,120
The game is pretty long just accounting for these four paths.

1634
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,560
So when you go to Castle Drangleic,

1635
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,560
you get the sense this really is the end game.

1636
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,240
You progress all the way through the castle

1637
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,280
to the shrine beneath,

1638
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,040
and then through the Grave of Saints.

1639
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,720
There's a real sense of build-up.

1640
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,840
Then you fight Velstadt,

1641
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,680
who's guarding the door to Vendrick.

1642
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,720
After beating him,

1643
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,440
you finally go to meet your presumably final opponent,

1644
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,040
the same final opponents you fought in Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1,

1645
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,680
the corrupted king of the world you've been walking through.

1646
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,080
But instead, this happens.

1647
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,880
Vendrick is a shadow of the man talked about in the lore

1648
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,560
and by the characters that remember him.

1649
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,480
He, like the fate of the rest of the undead,

1650
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,720
like the player's character will eventually become,

1651
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,920
has lost his mind.

1652
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,760
You don't have to fight Vendrick at all.

1653
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,120
He's not your enemy.

1654
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:18,160
He's just a man who lost his way and everything else with it.

1655
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,800
It's hard to relate how touching this is.

1656
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,880
The game genuinely feels like it was building

1657
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,040
to the very final confrontation.

1658
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,280
It's a game about a man who's lost his way,

1659
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,120
and he's trying to find his way back.

1660
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,600
It was building to the very final confrontation.

1661
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,160
The room is built to have a dramatic passage down steps

1662
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,600
similar to the lead-up to Gwyn,

1663
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,240
and it's built so that the camera naturally passes through it

1664
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,720
to reveal what Vendrick has become.

1665
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,000
I feel bad for spoiling it

1666
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,760
for people who haven't experienced the game yet,

1667
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,640
but this moment is pivotal to what makes the story interesting.

1668
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,960
You're built up for the traditional Souls game encounter

1669
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,080
with a fallen king,

1670
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,520
and instead you're faced with a thing

1671
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,080
to whom it doesn't even occur to fight you anymore,

1672
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,920
shambling around almost naked.

1673
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,680
You just have to pick up the king's ring,

1674
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,120
which unlocks the final areas

1675
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,960
and allows you to head to Aldia's keep

1676
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,560
and eventually meet the ancient dragon

1677
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,480
who's also not interested in fighting you.

1678
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,240
He gives you the Ashen Mist Heart,

1679
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,560
which lets you journey into the memories of giants

1680
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,400
from the old war Vendrick fought.

1681
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,920
You get to see a lot of the damage

1682
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,000
that you encounter in the main path happening.

1683
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,120
It's really neat.

1684
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,360
Killing the giant lord lets you face Nashandra,

1685
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,280
Vendrick's queen, at the Throne of Want.

1686
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,000
Killing her nets you precisely one ending.

1687
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,360
Your character sits on the throne,

1688
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,200
presumably having become the new king,

1689
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,720
and then the credits play.

1690
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,400
But instead of resetting the game,

1691
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,600
it just carries on.

1692
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,040
You're put back in the world.

1693
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,040
The game deliberately undercuts its story.

1694
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,340
You win,

1695
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,080
but what do you win?

1696
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,720
Kingship over a dying world?

1697
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,320
The chance to sit in a chair?

1698
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,160
Only one character in the game

1699
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,320
even recognizes you as the new king,

1700
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,640
Shal'Kuar, the seemingly immortal cat

1701
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,400
who also knows most of the rest of the lore

1702
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,680
about the other bosses.

1703
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,480
If you want to,

1704
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,880
you can use bonfire ascetics to refight old bosses

1705
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,640
or refresh enemies if you exhaust them,

1706
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,560
or you can completely kill all the NPCs

1707
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,760
even the Emerald Herald.

1708
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,360
You can make the world of Dark Souls 2

1709
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,320
completely empty of people and monsters.

1710
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,000
The only way to access New Game Plus

1711
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,520
is to sit at a bonfire

1712
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,000
and deliberately choose to start it all over again.

1713
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,120
I like these choices

1714
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,960
because they hammer home the hopelessness

1715
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,120
of the Dark Souls story that was there in one,

1716
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,480
but undercut by the fact

1717
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,760
no matter what ending you got,

1718
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,520
you just started at the beginning again.

1719
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,680
Dark Souls 2 forces you to contemplate

1720
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,120
how little you've really achieved

1721
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,320
with all these deaths,

1722
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,080
and then forces you to decide

1723
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,920
when it's time to do it all again.

1724
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,720
Ultimately, Dark Souls 2 is about cycles.

1725
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,400
The story is deliberately evocative

1726
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,600
of the previous game,

1727
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,600
exploring the empire of a king who fell,

1728
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,880
but with an explicit focus

1729
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,040
on how this has all happened before,

1730
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,880
and not just coincidentally.

1731
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,440
Perhaps it's something we're doomed to keep doing.

1732
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,000
Humanity,

1733
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,720
perhaps unable to ever fully escape its own nature,

1734
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,200
is repeating its mistakes over and over.

1735
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,280
For a game with so much architecture and character

1736
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,720
in so many of its designs,

1737
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,200
the best piece of imagery is the simplest one,

1738
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,120
the symbol of the dark sign.

1739
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,800
It's a loop, a circle,

1740
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,800
reflecting the way the undead return to life

1741
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,840
no matter what,

1742
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,160
continuing even after they lose their minds.

1743
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,960
Humanity itself is trapped in this loop.

1744
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,960
The story is much more for the player

1745
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,080
than in the previous game.

1746
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,760
It's a story in which the player is expected

1747
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,200
to contemplate their own actions

1748
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,480
instead of those of others,

1749
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,080
and recognize that the problem here

1750
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,240
isn't the mistakes of the king or his people,

1751
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,480
but that people as a whole were unable to escape

1752
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,720
the mistakes that happened in Dark Souls 1.

1753
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,640
But what's even better is how it makes sure to tell you

1754
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,080
this isn't just one repeat.

1755
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,080
No, the story of Dark Souls 1 has happened

1756
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,760
maybe countless times,

1757
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,960
so many you don't know and will never fully comprehend it.

1758
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,800
In a prison cell in the Lost Bastille

1759
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,240
is a man made of stone.

1760
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,080
If you unfreeze him, he refers to himself

1761
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,920
as Straid of Olaphis.

1762
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,640
Olaphis was a kingdom where Drangleic now stands,

1763
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,400
untold generations ago,

1764
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,120
so long ago that no one but Straid

1765
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,880
and the descriptions of spells and items

1766
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,040
invented by him or belonging to him

1767
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,160
even mention it.

1768
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,400
In Dark Souls 1, all the various areas and people

1769
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,680
and their stories and what happened

1770
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,000
can be pieced together quite meticulously.

1771
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,440
You can, with enough work,

1772
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,240
put together a complete universe out of the facts.

1773
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,440
In Dark Souls 2, an entire civilization

1774
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,120
can be so utterly lost

1775
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,840
that only one man even knows its name.

1776
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,840
Who knows how many empires rose and fell

1777
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,280
between Olaphis and Drangleic

1778
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,200
or Lordran and Drangleic,

1779
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,600
but pieces of them lie scattered everywhere,

1780
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,520
decayed, colossal wrecks,

1781
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,280
each with their own rise to power

1782
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,480
and their own mad kings

1783
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,800
and their own undead curse rending them apart.

1784
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,040
The Forest of Fallen Giants is Vendrick's doing,

1785
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,240
but Earthen Peak?

1786
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,440
The Old Iron Keep?

1787
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,840
These places rose and fell on their own terms.

1788
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,680
The DLC, which we'll get to later,

1789
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,840
each covers its own completely separate tale

1790
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,360
of a kingdom that rose and fell

1791
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,800
in roughly the same area.

1792
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,920
What's compelling about this

1793
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,120
is that it's more bizarre,

1794
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,240
more unexplained,

1795
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,680
and more human.

1796
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,680
People in the Souls universe are victims

1797
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,920
of a history they might never be able to learn.

1798
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,240
The story is about being lost

1799
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,720
in a confusing maze you can never fully understand,

1800
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,720
a feeling strengthened by the nightmarish

1801
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,480
of the actual physical world.

1802
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,640
Quelaag alone was simply a sad story

1803
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,560
about a woman transformed into a demon

1804
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,480
by an attempt to create more life,

1805
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,000
but now she's contextualized

1806
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,080
as a victim of a far deeper problem

1807
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,080
that mankind is having trouble escaping,

1808
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,120
because no matter what,

1809
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,600
it seems to keep happening over and over.

1810
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,600
Something really cool and kind of subtle

1811
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,760
is hidden in the basement of Majula.

1812
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,280
Down, hidden in the dirt,

1813
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,200
so small not many people notice,

1814
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,880
is a small, fractured piece

1815
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,800
of the Lordvessel from the first game.

1816
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,920
This is the best expression

1817
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,320
of what Dark Souls 2 is doing with its story.

1818
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,680
It's interested in telling a story

1819
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,920
about being unable to fully piece together

1820
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,880
what's happening,

1821
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,400
as the character loses their minds

1822
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,880
in a doomed world of destroyed statues.

1823
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,000
Your character doesn't even know

1824
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,280
what a Lordvessel is.

1825
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,640
To them, this is nothing,

1826
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,240
just a thing lying in the dust.

1827
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,080
It also represents the developers' attempts

1828
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,840
to do their own thing and move on

1829
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,160
by reducing an iconic part of the previous game

1830
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,080
to a piece of rubble in a basement.

1831
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,920
For me, the weakest parts of the previous games

1832
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,840
is when I got handed a whole heap of names,

1833
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,280
roles, and backstory.

1834
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,400
Demon's Souls did this, too,

1835
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,680
by just listing a bunch of people

1836
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:54,880
who went into the fog.

1837
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,080
I could just find those people

1838
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,280
and learn about them manually,

1839
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,640
but instead, the first games open

1840
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,240
with a needless role call

1841
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,160
and a story about a fight with dragons

1842
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,760
that doesn't really tell me anything.

1843
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,360
The guys I'm going to kill

1844
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,600
killed a bunch of dragons a long time ago,

1845
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,520
and that's important,

1846
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,800
because...

1847
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,120
Mmmmmmm.

1848
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,280
One flaw in the themes of Dark Souls 1

1849
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,880
was for all its criticisms of the world

1850
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:17,840
Gwyn had built,

1851
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,480
an awful lot of time was dedicated to his kingdom,

1852
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,000
to exploring its majesty,

1853
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,920
and even when you darken Anor Londo,

1854
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,440
you still find yourself compelled

1855
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,600
to look upon his works and despair.

1856
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,200
Dark Souls 2 does the most compelling

1857
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,120
and interesting thing it could possibly do

1858
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,560
with the story of Gwyn,

1859
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:33,680
Lord of Cinder,

1860
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,040
Master of Anor Londo,

1861
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,240
King of Lordran.

1862
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,440
It asks,

1863
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,400
who?

1864
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,120
I don't even think he's mentioned by name at all.

1865
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:44,400
Gwyn may well have been a good and mighty king,

1866
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,680
but the lone and level sands stretch far away,

1867
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,360
and he is gone.

1868
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:52,320
The paranoid king who had Straid petrified is gone,

1869
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,920
the king of Lordran is gone,

1870
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,760
and the king of Drangleic is gone,

1871
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,640
but his burnt-out husk still walks the earth yet,

1872
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,040
and we remember him for now.

1873
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,360
I think a lot of people wanted

1874
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:16,080
a story with the exact type of intricacies

1875
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,200
of the previous game.

1876
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,880
I can see wanting that

1877
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,120
and understand being disappointed,

1878
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,360
but I prefer the lonesomeness

1879
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,760
and the unsolvable puzzle you're given

1880
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,160
of a world where the weight of time

1881
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,320
has dissolved away most of history,

1882
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,760
and even the physical world

1883
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,000
twists into itself in impossible ways

1884
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,360
and icy peaks can give way to the flames of chaos.

1885
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,400
It's maddening and majestic at the same time

1886
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,920
in a way that no concretely designed physical world

1887
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,520
can ever be.

1888
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,800
This is imagery.

1889
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,560
This is visual metaphor.

1890
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,480
There's doubtless plenty of theory-crafting

1891
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,600
in Souls lore circles

1892
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,680
about who the woman with the spinning wheel is

1893
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,280
when you're told everything you need to know

1894
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,280
in just how she's presented here.

1895
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,720
She's deliberately evocative

1896
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,120
of the fortune-telling spirits with spinning wheels

1897
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,800
that exist seemingly throughout

1898
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,720
human mythology and folklore.

1899
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:05,520
More specifically,

1900
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,120
this character appears to be a reference

1901
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,880
to one of the most popular portrayals

1902
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,640
of this type of character in film history,

1903
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,640
the one that appears in Akira Kurosawa's

1904
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,440
Throne of Blood,

1905
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,120
also known as Spider-Web Castle.

1906
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,360
Throne of Blood is an adaptation of Macbeth.

1907
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,200
In case you haven't heard of Macbeth,

1908
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,120
Macbeth's about a happy-go-lucky guy

1909
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,120
whose destiny is to become king,

1910
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:25,200
but it turns out being the king

1911
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,520
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

1912
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:34,640
["Spider-Web Castle"]

1913
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,680
Interestingly enough,

1914
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:36,720
right before the character

1915
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,720
who's a reference to Spider-Web Castle,

1916
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,480
just to make sure you know they get it,

1917
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,240
they've just put a spider right there.

1918
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,440
The appearance of a character

1919
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,280
seemingly straight out of this film,

1920
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,440
a film about the darkness befalling people

1921
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,120
whose destiny is to rule,

1922
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,720
is a better piece of storytelling

1923
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,560
than all the item descriptions

1924
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,040
and all the loot drops in the world.

1925
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,320
But because it relies on

1926
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,840
understanding of imagery

1927
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,280
outside of video games

1928
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,280
and visual storytelling,

1929
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,800
none of this information can be found

1930
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,600
on any wiki about the story of the Souls series.

1931
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,560
In a way,

1932
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,000
the story of Dark Souls 2

1933
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,680
is the ultimate in nerd horror.

1934
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,440
It tells a story of a universe

1935
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,640
it's impossible to build

1936
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,200
a comprehensive fucking wiki about.

1937
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,240
And to nerds,

1938
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,400
that's the scariest thing there is.

1939
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,920
This opening proceeds into

1940
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,840
a series of destroyed castles,

1941
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,960
ruined thrones,

1942
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,640
mad, dead kings.

1943
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,720
When you finally get your own throne,

1944
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,200
there's a worrying ambivalence to it.

1945
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,200
The best Dark Souls 1 could muster

1946
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,200
was having sad music

1947
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,640
play over the last boss,

1948
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,200
and if you look at Jimmy's pants,

1949
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,880
it tells you how bad he was

1950
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,240
when he was a kid.

1951
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,760
Dark Souls 2 puts you

1952
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,680
into the role of the last boss,

1953
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,280
becoming patriarch of a world

1954
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:46,880
on its way to its doom,

1955
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,280
ultimately failing to achieve anything.

1956
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,080
And it asks you how you feel about that

1957
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,520
and where you go from here.

1958
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,800
The pacing of Dark Souls 1

1959
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,320
wasn't great after the Lordvessel,

1960
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,000
but it did a lot more with a lot less

1961
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,440
when it came to its plot.

1962
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,360
Its introductory video set up the world

1963
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,440
and the major players very efficiently.

1964
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,480
Efficient storytelling is being placed over

1965
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,040
good storytelling,

1966
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,120
or even a good story.

1967
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,160
I think gamers on the whole

1968
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,440
are still kind of enamored

1969
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,000
with a wikipedia-style approach to storytelling,

1970
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,400
where everything can be concretely pieced together

1971
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,760
in an objective narrative,

1972
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,440
when really I think there's a lot of other ways

1973
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,880
you can explore a story.

1974
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,720
The intro video to Dark Souls 2

1975
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:26,160
shows the main character dropping

1976
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,600
into some kind of whirlpool

1977
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,600
because the old lady tells us we're cursed

1978
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,720
and the only hope of a cure

1979
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,720
is to go to Drangleic for some reason.

1980
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,320
She actually says we'll have no idea

1981
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:35,200
why we're going to do

1982
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,120
any of the stuff we're about to do.

1983
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:40,640
This visual metaphor for falling into darkness,

1984
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,280
you know,

1985
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,760
the thing that going hollow does to your mind,

1986
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,640
is reduced to falling into

1987
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,480
some kind of whirlpool.

1988
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,920
A woman visually coded

1989
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,520
as having the power to see the future,

1990
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,960
predicting a horrible fate

1991
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:53,760
in which we do things

1992
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,520
without fully understanding their purpose

1993
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,040
because we lose our minds,

1994
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,240
is reduced to

1995
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,520
the old lady

1996
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,960
telling us to go to Drangleic

1997
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,480
for some reason.

1998
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,720
No wonder this critical approach to storytelling

1999
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,800
resulted in finding the story lacking.

2000
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,480
No, this is just an old lady

2001
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:09,920
telling us to do things

2002
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,120
for some reason.

2003
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,040
There's no nuance or meaning

2004
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:16,320
or cinematic language being utilized here.

2005
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,600
That level of understanding

2006
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,520
has no place in my

2007
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,920
nuanced critique of a video game.

2008
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,320
New Game Plus is the bad ending.

2009
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,000
You press a button and admit

2010
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:26,800
that all that's left

2011
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,720
is for everything to happen again.

2012
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:29,600
There's another ending,

2013
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,520
which came out when all the DLCs had come out

2014
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,520
and also adds a new character.

2015
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,800
I think this aspect of the story

2016
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:35,920
is interesting in its own way,

2017
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,280
but I don't like how people use it

2018
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,200
as an excuse to criticize Dark Souls 2,

2019
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,720
pretending there wasn't enough story

2020
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,600
in the initial release

2021
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:42,800
and this is an admission of that

2022
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,400
and they're finally fixing it,

2023
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,840
or they're patching the story in

2024
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,120
in post or something.

2025
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:48,560
There's plenty of story,

2026
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,640
but just not the kind everyone wanted.

2027
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,080
For me, it was already complete

2028
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,520
in its incompleteness,

2029
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,800
but giving the player the option

2030
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,440
of getting an ending

2031
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,480
where they beat another boss

2032
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,320
and walk out is a nice little bonus.

2033
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,520
It's a nice extra little thing

2034
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,800
to give people and that's all right.

2035
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,640
The DLC to Dark Souls 2 is fantastic.

2036
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,160
Each one experiments with mechanics

2037
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,520
in cool and interesting ways

2038
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:10,640
I don't want to get too far into

2039
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,320
because we're already pressed for time.

2040
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,760
Rest assured they're all lengthy enough

2041
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,120
to feel like worthwhile additions.

2042
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,960
I'll rattle off the fun stuff I really liked.

2043
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,640
I like Broom Tower's verticality

2044
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,240
and the way you unlocked more access

2045
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,040
from the central hub

2046
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:23,120
once you got the key wedge thing.

2047
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,960
I like Crown of the Old Iron King's gimmick

2048
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,000
of having the first boss

2049
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,040
and the Iron King himself

2050
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,640
be just to your left when you come in

2051
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:29,600
and you can take a series

2052
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:30,720
of looping paths around

2053
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,000
to make the first boss visible

2054
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:32,800
then go around again

2055
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,680
once the ice melts

2056
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,040
to gain access to more soldiers

2057
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,320
for the Old Iron King fight.

2058
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,920
You could find and build a little army

2059
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,120
to help you even out the odds

2060
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,400
and that's really cool.

2061
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,840
I like the puzzles that require you

2062
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,680
to actually use a bow to progress.

2063
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,440
The Souls games, when it comes down to it,

2064
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:46,960
are something of an offshoot from Zelda

2065
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,640
and its attempt to bring some honest-to-god

2066
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,400
bow-and-arrow puzzles to the game.

2067
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,200
It was unexpected,

2068
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,720
but it fit together quite well.

2069
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,920
I like these ghost guys

2070
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,840
who look like phantoms you see online.

2071
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,880
It actually trips you up

2072
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:57,920
when you discover they're real

2073
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:58,880
and they attack you.

2074
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,080
It makes for a cool fakeout

2075
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,040
I just spoiled for you,

2076
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,480
so I hope you already played this bit.

2077
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,400
Sin the Slumbering Dragon is a hard fight,

2078
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,480
but the first really fun fight with a dragon

2079
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,760
in basically any of these games

2080
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:08,640
for me personally,

2081
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,760
especially after the optional

2082
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,800
Ancient Dragon fight

2083
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,160
which is honestly a chore.

2084
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,600
In many ways, the DLC embodies

2085
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,040
Dark Souls 2 in microcosm,

2086
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,160
being willing to go all the way

2087
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,600
and experimenting with its mechanics

2088
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,120
to create new and unique areas,

2089
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:19,840
and in doing so,

2090
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:20,960
it also comes to embody

2091
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,400
the very best the Souls series

2092
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,840
has to offer as a whole.

2093
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:26,800
It's everything that I think I ever wanted

2094
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:27,840
from a Souls game,

2095
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:30,480
and it's part of Dark Souls 2,

2096
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,000
so Dark Souls 2 wins.

2097
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,120
Scholar of the First Sin is a second edition

2098
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,320
of Dark Souls 2 that came out

2099
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,680
nearly two years ago now.

2100
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,120
It bundled together the DLCs

2101
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,400
for the original release of the game,

2102
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,400
had some graphical and performance updates,

2103
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,640
and put the items that grant access to the DLC

2104
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:45,680
in the world itself

2105
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:46,560
as things to find

2106
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,160
instead of items you simply start with

2107
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,200
if you owned the DLC

2108
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,240
in the previous version.

2109
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,920
This version's really interesting.

2110
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:52,880
I'm not going to say good,

2111
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:53,680
interesting.

2112
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:54,560
Instead of a simple,

2113
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,320
slightly visually improved bundle,

2114
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,600
it actually dramatically changes

2115
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:58,560
most of the game.

2116
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,000
Almost all of the enemy encounters

2117
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,120
and placements have been altered,

2118
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,080
and the amount of enemies

2119
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,680
has overall increased massively.

2120
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,360
I've played Dark Souls 2 multiple times

2121
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,400
before playing this version,

2122
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,680
and I found it to be very different

2123
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:08,560
and much harder

2124
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:10,640
despite superficially being the same game.

2125
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,000
It's more frustrating too.

2126
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:12,960
A lot of people didn't like

2127
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:13,600
the amount of enemies

2128
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,280
you often fight at once in Dark Souls 2,

2129
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,480
something I didn't have a problem with

2130
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,360
in that game,

2131
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,880
but in this it's definitely difficult

2132
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:19,760
enough to be annoying

2133
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:20,800
even if you know how to deal

2134
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,000
with groups in this engine.

2135
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:22,560
Honestly,

2136
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,640
the game this reminds me of the most

2137
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,640
is Super Mario Bros. 2.

2138
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:27,840
The Japanese Mario 2

2139
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:30,160
is like an optional harder Mario game,

2140
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:30,960
pushing the engine

2141
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,160
and player skill requirements

2142
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,520
to the absolute limit

2143
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:34,880
before it becomes unsellable

2144
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,240
as a consumer product.

2145
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:36,560
Heck,

2146
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,840
they didn't even bother selling it

2147
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,040
in the West for a reason.

2148
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,120
I'd call Scholar a pretty good game.

2149
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:41,840
It's challenging,

2150
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,520
it's entertainingly funny in places,

2151
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,280
and it's a nice way of playing a game

2152
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:45,920
I love dearly

2153
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,680
in a new, remixed way.

2154
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,400
However,

2155
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,160
I have to qualify calling it good.

2156
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,760
It's good only within

2157
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,520
the context of Dark Souls 2

2158
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,800
already existing,

2159
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,920
of there being about a year

2160
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,200
of playing the original version

2161
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,480
to prepare for this one.

2162
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,760
I would not recommend this game

2163
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,840
to anyone as a first game in the series,

2164
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:02,640
which for some people

2165
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,480
this might have saddeningly been.

2166
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,000
It's for people who are diehard fans

2167
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:06,880
of the series already

2168
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,960
or even just fans of 2 specifically,

2169
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:09,920
and for those people,

2170
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,040
even when it's not fun,

2171
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,400
it's fun as an entertaining

2172
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,360
little experiment

2173
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,720
with a bunch of aspects of the game

2174
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:15,920
tweaked just enough.

2175
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,520
It feels almost like a ROM hack

2176
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,400
of Dark Souls 2

2177
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:19,520
they made for fun,

2178
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,160
and for some people

2179
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,440
that might be a condemnation,

2180
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:22,240
especially considering

2181
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,760
it's the cost of a full-priced game.

2182
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:25,360
So I can't heartily recommend it,

2183
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,800
but the Soul games are quite difficult

2184
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,000
to recommend already.

2185
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,200
Something I like specifically

2186
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,560
is the entrance to the Earthen Peak

2187
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,520
from Harvest Valley.

2188
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,400
There's a couple of enemies

2189
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,040
in the original,

2190
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,280
but it seems quite underutilized,

2191
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,720
like it's a short, quick rush

2192
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:37,520
through an area that could be

2193
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,640
more fleshed out.

2194
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:39,200
In Scholar,

2195
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,560
it's significantly altered.

2196
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,680
There's way more enemies,

2197
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:42,880
it's way more difficult,

2198
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,160
there's purposeful traps

2199
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,680
for if you try and run past,

2200
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:46,960
and it has more enemy types

2201
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:47,760
that appear in, like,

2202
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,280
two places in the original game,

2203
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,080
which is nice.

2204
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:50,880
There are also more

2205
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,000
Hidey Nights in general,

2206
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:52,640
which is great

2207
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,920
and something I wanted,

2208
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,120
and also they're way more aggressive.

2209
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:55,760
Some of them get up

2210
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:56,800
and go for you now,

2211
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:57,840
and that's a really cool thing

2212
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,040
that you just don't expect

2213
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,160
if you play the original,

2214
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,760
and that's really, really fun.

2215
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:02,800
Also, something I quite like

2216
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,600
about both games

2217
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,960
is that in each one,

2218
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,160
someone's credentials

2219
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,440
are called into question.

2220
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,160
In the original,

2221
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,280
in Hidey's Tower,

2222
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,240
the Dragon Rider looked

2223
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,040
like an idiot.

2224
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:11,920
There were no dragons

2225
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,120
anywhere for most of the game.

2226
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,800
Why is he called the Dragon Rider?

2227
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:15,360
What?

2228
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,160
That's ridiculous.

2229
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,600
The guy's obviously lying.

2230
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,040
But in Scholar,

2231
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,480
it's the Dragon Slayer

2232
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,600
just over the way from him

2233
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,200
who's clearly lying on his resume.

2234
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,320
There's a dragon right outside

2235
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,200
his fucking office!

2236
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,360
Don't get the Scholar edition

2237
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,400
unless you similarly

2238
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,080
really like two already

2239
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:30,960
and don't approach it

2240
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,080
as its own game per se,

2241
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,120
but as another way

2242
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:33,920
of playing a game

2243
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:34,720
you already liked

2244
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:35,840
for what it was doing,

2245
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:36,720
and you'll probably

2246
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:37,600
have a good time.

2247
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,400
I honestly want to see

2248
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,440
more games like this.

2249
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:40,080
I would have liked

2250
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:40,880
a similar edition

2251
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:41,600
along these lines

2252
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,560
for every Souls game,

2253
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,120
to be honest.

2254
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:47,360
Wait, wait.

2255
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:48,080
Hold on a second.

2256
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:56,880
Obviously,

2257
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,160
a lot of game criticism

2258
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,920
is based on subjective experience,

2259
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:00,960
which can't exactly

2260
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,240
be proven wrong,

2261
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:03,120
sadly,

2262
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:03,760
but that's not what

2263
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,960
I'm trying to do here.

2264
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:05,920
My aim as a critic

2265
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,280
isn't just to try and find ways

2266
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,040
of looking at and analyzing games

2267
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:09,680
and their design

2268
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:10,400
that are useful

2269
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,200
and help in forming

2270
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,640
better ideas of quality,

2271
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,480
but also to try and understand

2272
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:15,600
and explain why

2273
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,680
other people reacted differently.

2274
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:18,720
I've had some pushback

2275
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:19,680
from people on some of my

2276
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,280
long game analysis videos,

2277
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,480
usually by people who enjoyed

2278
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,920
a game I was being critical about

2279
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,600
or didn't enjoy a game I liked

2280
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,480
or who played the game

2281
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,600
a way I said was wrong

2282
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,720
and happened to like it.

2283
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,320
I in no way mean to diminish

2284
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,440
other people's experiences

2285
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,080
of a game.

2286
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,200
If you didn't like something,

2287
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,240
I can't reason you

2288
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,200
into liking it.

2289
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,320
My aim is to understand

2290
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:37,440
why people do or don't

2291
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,080
like something

2292
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:38,960
and learn from that

2293
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,000
and use the information

2294
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:40,640
in my work.

2295
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:41,440
I've gone on record

2296
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:42,480
as thinking the Souls games

2297
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,520
are all very good,

2298
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,240
but that doesn't make

2299
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:45,680
other people not liking them

2300
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,360
or not thinking that wrong.

2301
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,560
They're useful because

2302
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:49,680
you learn why people

2303
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,800
wouldn't enjoy something,

2304
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:51,840
and that's really helpful

2305
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:52,960
if you, for example,

2306
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,000
are interested in what makes

2307
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,760
a game fun to a lot of people,

2308
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:57,520
which is really financially

2309
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,040
lucrative nowadays.

2310
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,160
I feel the games got better

2311
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:01,440
at correcting the sort of problems

2312
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:02,800
that caused not a lot of people

2313
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,080
to enjoy them early on,

2314
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,600
at least without a lot of friction

2315
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:06,240
at the start,

2316
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,600
and somewhat interestingly,

2317
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:08,400
helped them go back

2318
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,160
and appreciate the previous ones.

2319
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,040
Everyone's entitled

2320
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,160
to their opinion,

2321
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:13,120
and in my opinion,

2322
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,040
every other game critic

2323
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,080
is stupid.

2324
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,160
Okay, I can't even

2325
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,200
make that joke here.

2326
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:21,920
You see,

2327
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:22,800
the overly negative

2328
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:23,600
critical response

2329
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,720
from Souls diehards

2330
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,000
and some spheres of the internet

2331
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:26,800
isn't even accurate

2332
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,320
to what most game critics said

2333
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,840
when the game first came out.

2334
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:30,560
On the whole,

2335
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:31,600
people loved it.

2336
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,360
The misgivings came specifically

2337
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,040
from folks like Matthew Matosis

2338
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,480
and the popularity of his video

2339
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,440
predicated centrally

2340
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,720
on how the game couldn't possibly

2341
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:39,600
be as good as the first

2342
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,960
because Miyazaki didn't make it

2343
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,560
and locking on in some fights

2344
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,440
isn't a good idea

2345
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,560
and the opening cutscene

2346
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:45,520
didn't talk about a war

2347
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,560
that already happened

2348
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,680
and has no effect on us

2349
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:48,720
as a player.

2350
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:49,520
Ignore how,

2351
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:50,640
in Dark Souls 2,

2352
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:51,920
there's a similar ancient war

2353
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:52,960
in the distant past,

2354
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,240
but you get to learn about it

2355
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:55,280
over the course of the game

2356
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,800
instead of a pre-rendered cutscene

2357
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:57,600
at the beginning,

2358
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,880
and then you get to actually

2359
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,080
go fight in it?!

2360
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,440
Critics at the time of release

2361
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,480
liked it a lot,

2362
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,280
the exact same way

2363
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,640
critics liked Demon's Souls

2364
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,920
a lot back when this whole series

2365
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:06,720
was new and strange

2366
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:07,680
and not many people played

2367
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,640
or liked it.

2368
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,080
People who think about games a lot

2369
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,280
are more likely to easily

2370
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,560
get into a new experience

2371
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:13,600
than people who just play them

2372
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:14,320
as a hobby.

2373
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,600
Internet critics like Yahtzee

2374
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,320
wiped their ass

2375
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,440
all over various aspects

2376
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:17,840
of the games

2377
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:18,640
that would later say

2378
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:19,920
they loved when audiences

2379
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,280
started to get a hang of the games

2380
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:21,840
and it turned out

2381
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,440
they were talking bollocks.

2382
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,720
Fuck you, Demon's Souls.

2383
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:25,840
A challenge is one thing,

2384
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,720
but trying to break down

2385
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:27,600
a fucking cement wall

2386
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:28,240
with your forehead

2387
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:28,800
isn't a challenge,

2388
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:29,680
it's grounds for getting

2389
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:30,800
fucking sectioned.

2390
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:31,920
Demon's Souls is one of the most

2391
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,280
rewarding, challenging games

2392
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,720
ever to hit the PS3.

2393
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:35,840
It may not be for everyone,

2394
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:37,040
but I still urge everyone

2395
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,240
to at least try it.

2396
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,080
And GameSpot's 2009 game

2397
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:40,720
of the year is...

2398
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:43,680
Demon's Souls.

2399
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,280
Demon's Souls is like

2400
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,480
nothing you've ever played.

2401
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,560
Do you hear that?

2402
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,920
It was the best

2403
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,120
and most innovative game

2404
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,000
of 2009.

2405
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,920
That's Kevin Van Flipping Ord.

2406
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,440
That's the thought criminal

2407
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,320
who was so wrong

2408
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,360
about Fallout 3

2409
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,240
he was found dead

2410
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,680
in his cell last year

2411
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:02,720
next to an apology

2412
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:04,560
written in my blood.

2413
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:05,680
Even he has been

2414
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:06,640
on the ground floor

2415
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:07,680
of the Souls series

2416
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,880
since day one.

2417
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:09,760
It turns out that

2418
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:10,960
professional game critics

2419
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:11,680
are quite often

2420
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:12,800
more ahead of the curb

2421
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,000
than the average consumer

2422
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,760
or the not-to-be-rude

2423
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:16,720
fanboy types

2424
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,000
who will dismiss a sequel

2425
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:18,960
for being too different

2426
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:19,840
to the one they first

2427
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:20,880
fell in love with.

2428
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,160
Mainstream game critics

2429
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:23,200
can be wrong,

2430
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,640
but they've been consistently

2431
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,000
right about the Souls series

2432
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,360
from day one.

2433
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,800
It's only corners of the internet

2434
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,720
full of rose-tinted fanboyishness

2435
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,080
towards the first Dark Souls

2436
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,680
that result in the ridiculous

2437
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,200
treatment of the second game.

2438
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,400
When it comes down to it,

2439
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,600
Dark Souls was

2440
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,720
a fantastic game,

2441
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:39,520
even though it's flawed

2442
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:40,160
in a lot of ways

2443
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:41,280
that are so much more obvious

2444
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,240
now than ever.

2445
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:43,600
I think the sheer surprise

2446
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,040
of how good Dark Souls was

2447
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:45,760
after most people

2448
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,280
missed the boat on Demon's Souls

2449
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,720
made it a hard act to follow

2450
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:49,760
and lots of fans got

2451
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,920
unrealistic expectations about it.

2452
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,680
The online response to Dark Souls 3

2453
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,040
sounds overall lukewarm

2454
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:55,920
but positive,

2455
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,200
and I think that might be because

2456
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,360
at least in regards to this one series,

2457
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,800
maybe not a couple others,

2458
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,680
people have cooled

2459
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:02,640
and learned to manage

2460
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:03,920
their expectations.

2461
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:04,960
I'm interested in finally

2462
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:05,520
getting to play it

2463
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:06,560
after working for so long

2464
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:07,600
on videos about the games

2465
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:08,400
that preceded it.

2466
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,120
I'm a little worried

2467
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,000
that the fan reaction

2468
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:10,960
to some aspects of 2

2469
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:11,920
made them walk back

2470
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:12,720
on the good ideas

2471
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:13,840
in an effort to be more like

2472
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:14,640
the first one,

2473
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:15,600
but I'm gonna play it

2474
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,800
and judge it on its own merits

2475
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:17,520
as its own game

2476
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,120
before I really consider that.

2477
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,400
In the meantime,

2478
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,240
Dark Souls 2 is not perfect,

2479
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:22,880
but you can have

2480
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,240
a grand old time with it.

2481
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,200
The gameplay contains

2482
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,320
some of the tightest moments

2483
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,520
in the whole series

2484
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,120
and some really fun variations

2485
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,080
on the formula.

2486
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:30,880
It tells a story

2487
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:31,920
that instead of redoing

2488
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:32,560
the original

2489
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,520
or trying to build on it

2490
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,880
in a straightforward way,

2491
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,160
self-consciously explores

2492
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:37,280
what it means to exist

2493
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,480
in a specific position

2494
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:39,760
in gaming culture

2495
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:40,560
and asks us

2496
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,680
what the things we desire

2497
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:42,480
from games

2498
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,680
say about us.

2499
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:45,520
I really enjoyed Dark Souls 2,

2500
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,800
and I think there's a lot of things

2501
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:47,680
that make it good,

2502
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,120
and if you didn't enjoy it,

2503
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,160
that's okay.

2504
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:51,200
Your different opinions

2505
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:52,000
and experiences

2506
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,040
are equally as valid,

2507
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,000
and I know I talk

2508
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,360
authoritatively sometimes,

2509
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,480
but I hope it's clear

2510
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,600
I'm just offering my opinion

2511
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,880
in a way I think is interesting

2512
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,080
or convincing,

2513
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:02,320
and it's okay to disagree with me.

2514
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,120
For now.

2515
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:15,120
[â™ª Music â™ª

2516
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,720
Thanks so much for watching

2517
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:18,000
this really long addendum

2518
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,920
to a super long video.

2519
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,120
Making this kind of criticism

2520
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,400
takes a ridiculous amount

2521
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:23,440
of time and effort,

2522
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,320
and it always takes

2523
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:24,960
so much longer

2524
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,080
than I think it will,

2525
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,360
so I really would like

2526
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,240
to thank my patrons

2527
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,440
for keeping me in spaghetti

2528
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,120
and moisturizer while I work.

2529
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,000
In addition to the names

2530
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,440
going past the screen right now,

2531
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,680
I'd especially like to thank

If you've made it this far,

2655
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:16,480
you either listened to the credits like a true believer,

2656
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:19,840
or guessed correctly I'd put something after the credits and skipped ahead,

2657
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,120
like a meanie.

2658
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:22,080
In any case,

2659
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:26,320
the time has come to tally up the votes from the secret vote I held at the end of the Bloodborne video.

2660
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:27,840
Let's see which one won.

2661
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,120

01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,560

Ah, fuck it. Deus Ex. Let's do that one.
