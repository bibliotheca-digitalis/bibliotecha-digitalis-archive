0	2960	This video is an offshoot from the video I made about Bloodborne.
2960	7200	I realized partway through recording it that attempts to defend and talk up Dark Souls 2
7200	9280	were worming their way into the Bloodborne video,
9280	11520	so instead of making the Bloodborne video even longer,
11520	14880	I decided to cut those parts out and then put them in their own video.
14880	17280	Then I realized this video made no sense
17280	20160	because it was just a mishmash of stuff lifted from a different video
20160	21680	pasted together without context,
21680	25360	so I remade it all, which took bloody ages.
25360	27440	This game is unfairly maligned.
27440	29280	I think Dark Souls 1 was incredible,
29280	33040	and people who really liked that one had kind of unrealistic expectations
33040	36000	and got inevitably burned by the sequel being different
36000	40240	or failing to be as spectacular and new as its predecessor when it came out.
40240	42800	Judging it as a game, I think it's really good.
42800	44400	It's not as good as Bloodborne,
44400	45760	but it's a little bit...
45760	48000	It's a little bit better than Dark Souls 1.
48960	52480	Oh, I mean, in my opinion, it's a little bit better than Dark Souls 1.
53680	55920	Okay, it's about as good as Dark Souls 1,
55920	57440	but it has some differences I prefer.
58240	60400	Okay, it's not as good as Dark Souls 1,
60400	63200	but the changes were an interesting and useful risk
63200	65760	that's more valuable existing than not existing
65760	68160	and is genuinely better than just getting more of Dark Souls 1,
68160	70960	which we already have and you can still just go back to and play if you want to.
72240	74160	And I personally think I had more fun with it.
75600	79680	I think the Emerald Herald is a better waifu than Guinevere.
79680	96000	♪
96000	98400	We might as well start with a discussion of the health system,
98400	101200	which I feel is the core building block of the Souls games
101200	104080	because it dictates the rhythm and structure of the gameplay
104080	108240	and creates the weighty sense of challenge and difficulty the series is known for.
108240	111600	Ironically, it's very easy to just make something hard.
111600	114080	Making a game challenging while also being fun
114080	117360	requires a very dense and carefully arranged interplay of mechanics.
117360	119520	This is the tightrope games have to walk.
119520	121440	How do you make a player feel challenged
121440	123840	so that their success is a rewarding experience
123840	127360	without making them feel overly punished or simply frustrated?
127360	129600	This balance is difficult to execute.
129600	132080	The reason Souls games are difficult in the first place
132080	134480	is because of the way damage works in the games.
134480	135680	If everything was the same,
135680	138800	but all attacks did a half or a quarter the damage they do,
138800	140640	the game would be fundamentally different,
140640	143040	less challenging, and less fun as a result.
143040	145680	Things wouldn't be as weighty because the damage wasn't as important
145680	148160	and dodging wouldn't feel as necessary and so on.
148160	150000	This is why a lot of first-person shooters
150000	152960	have a difficulty mode they explicitly recommend over the others
152960	154800	because games usually manipulate difficulty
154800	157120	by making the damage sliders be higher or lower
157120	160000	and in most games there's a specific amount of damage
160000	162240	attacks are most enjoyable to be working with.
162240	164000	Souls games have no difficulty setting
164080	166720	because there's almost no way to make the game easier
166720	169920	without fundamentally altering the thing that makes the games fun.
169920	173280	In a Souls game, you generally can only take a couple of hits before dying.
173280	175520	Healing, therefore, is an important mechanic.
175520	177440	How do you let the player gain health back?
177440	179280	This is an important mechanic to talk about
179280	182880	because it defines the flow of the rest of the ensuing game experience.
182880	184880	Let's say there was no healing whatsoever
184880	188080	or you healed instantly without there even being an animation
188080	189440	or, as in Bloodborne,
189440	192720	you could heal back damage you took if you retaliated quickly.
192720	195040	These utterly change the rest of the mechanics
195040	196960	and therefore the rest of the game experience
196960	200160	because they change how the player is led to interact with them.
200160	203040	The guy who gets to decide how players get health back
203040	205680	actually is responsible for more of the game
205680	208320	than the people who design the levels in a weird way.
208320	210240	Souls games have done this a variety of ways
210240	212720	with a variety of impacts on core gameplay.
212720	217040	In Demon's Souls, you healed by using different kinds of grass you found or purchased.
217040	220240	Stopping to grab a bite, however, was very slow and deliberate
220240	222080	and it stopped you dead in your tracks.
222080	225200	While this is fine if you already beat the thing that damaged you,
225200	227600	in a lot of direct combat situations,
227600	230960	stopping to heal is either not going to work or is going to get you killed.
230960	232880	It's a calculated risk every time
232880	235600	and in boss fights, finding places in the rhythm of the battle
235600	237200	when healing was a good idea
237200	241120	was key to survival for people who couldn't always avoid taking that damage.
241120	243520	There is something of a downside to this, however.
243520	247600	Firstly, while it is very calculated and purposeful and challenging to heal,
248240	249200	should it be?
249200	252080	It's fair, but is it good to be in a situation
252080	254800	where the most pressing thing, trying to heal,
254800	257360	is a really bad idea that would itself kill you?
257360	260720	A lot of early players die while mashing the heal button.
260720	261680	That's not fun,
261680	265200	even if simply not doing that is technically the sound response.
265200	266400	Secondly, in Demon's Souls,
266400	269520	you immediately have access to all the healing items you'll ever need.
269520	271120	You can buy as many of them as you want
271120	274000	as soon as the game properly starts and always go back for more
274000	276080	and they're fairly easy to farm from enemies.
276080	278800	This means that if they master the timing to heal in battle,
278800	280400	they're practically unkillable
280400	283440	and can't be worn down by attrition as they progress to a level.
283440	286640	As long as no one encounter can fully drain your life bar,
286640	288160	which can still happen a lot,
288160	290320	Demon's Souls' difficulty is reduced quite a bit
290320	292240	from where it was probably meant to be.
292240	294800	You technically have access to an infama-
294800	295520	Infama?
295520	298480	Infinite amount of life as long as you use it properly.
298480	302000	Dark Souls replaced this health system entirely with the Estus Flask,
302000	304560	a healing item which you couldn't buy more of.
304560	306160	You had a limited amount of uses
306160	308880	which recharged at bonfires or when you died.
308880	311600	Yes, I know you can also get health back by using a humanity,
311600	313520	but doing that burns such a rare resource
313520	316080	that I couldn't really regard it as a source of healing
316080	319200	unless you're one of those good-at-Dark-Souls people I've heard so much about.
319200	322560	This meant you had a finite amount of life at any given time.
322560	324800	This also means attrition becomes a factor.
324800	327280	Damage you take is health you aren't getting back
327280	329360	until you reach a place that restores Estus.
329360	332000	This can make the game more interesting and more risky.
332000	334480	It also means that there's a net maximum amount of times
334480	337440	you can possibly be hit by enemies or a boss in a single run.
337440	340400	In this regard, Dark Souls is tremendously more difficult,
340400	343920	but also more satisfying because of the new element of challenge it adds.
343920	346880	However, you're still left basically prone while you do it,
346880	348960	and it still takes just long enough that getting killed
348960	351680	while trying to heal is an annoying and common possibility.
351680	353280	And it means if you're on a run to a boss
353280	354960	and you take a certain amount of damage,
354960	357280	you feel like you're already doomed on this run
357280	358800	because there's no way you can get past them
358800	360400	with that little health remaining,
360400	362880	so you have to go back or just go on a doomed run
362880	364480	and die and come back again.
364480	366560	And that can kind of wear down your ability
366560	369280	to keep playing the game and enjoy it,
369280	371040	which is a big deal in games.
371040	374720	Dark Souls 2, in my opinion, fixes some of this pretty well.
374720	376720	Firstly, it takes an age to drink again,
376720	379120	making it even more deliberate than the Demon's Souls one,
379120	381840	and your health actually recovers over a very short amount of time
381840	383120	instead of instantaneously.
383120	385600	This forces the player to not even consider healing
385600	386800	until they're free and clear
386800	389840	because there's no chance they'll just get the Estus to their lips
389840	391600	before getting hit and stay alive.
391600	394160	Ironically, by being even more slow and deliberate,
394160	396880	it further disencourages the thing that causes annoyance
396880	399440	when it doesn't work, dying while trying to heal.
399440	403040	However, Dark Souls 2 also supplements this with life gems.
403040	404960	Life gems are a little bit like the grass,
404960	407680	down to being purchasable and coming in numerous sizes.
407680	411760	They take a while to use, and they heal over time very slowly.
411760	413520	This is genius.
413520	417520	You see, attrition isn't necessarily a fun kind of challenge.
417520	419120	It can create a nice feeling
419120	422320	and a risk that you'll be worn down too far to make it anywhere,
422320	423760	but you know what isn't fun?
423760	425360	Knowing you're definitely fucked
425360	427680	because you'll most likely lose the remaining health you have
427680	429040	before you get anywhere new.
429040	431600	Knowing you're at the limit your healing can possibly take you
431600	433680	with your abilities and you're just not good enough
433680	436080	and you're gonna have to keep playing this area over and over
436080	438160	or go farming and level up or something.
438160	440640	By bringing back theoretically infinite health
440640	442640	but making it heal very slowly,
442640	445200	the creators have introduced a way to get around this annoyance
445200	447440	without making the player feel totally invincible.
447440	449280	They also have tactical uses.
449280	451440	Since they take a while to use and are slow,
451440	453040	they're risky to use in fights,
453040	455360	but if you're good at not immediately dying,
455360	456640	they still heal you,
456640	459680	so you can run out of Estus and still have access to a source of healing
459680	461760	that requires some skill to use effectively,
461760	463200	which is kind of cool and smart.
463200	465680	They're also useful for if you expect to take damage
465680	468480	but don't think you'll be able to stop and heal later.
468480	471280	In some boss fights, using a gem when you get the chance
471280	473760	and then attacking means you'll get some health back
473760	475440	even if you get hit a bit later.
475440	477200	This is frankly a welcome addition.
477200	479680	I've heard the criticism that the addition of life gems
479680	482560	utterly destroys the delicate balance of the entire game
482560	485280	and it's erased the majesty of the Estus flask
485280	488800	and its purposeful limitation of a player's maximum amount of mistakes.
488800	491440	This, in a sense, is an accurate analysis.
491440	493520	The balance is shifted.
493520	495600	However, it's shifted in favor of the player
495600	498640	in a way that's overall positive for the experience.
498640	501280	Bloodborne probably does the best with its use of healing.
501280	504640	Blood vials are simultaneously infinite and finite.
504640	506320	You can buy a bunch quite easily
506320	508640	but only have 20 on hand at any time.
508640	510960	The more you find in a level are immediately usable
510960	512640	if you had less than 20 on you,
512640	515360	so you can use more than 20 if you use one in a fight
515360	517120	and then one drops from a corpse later,
517120	518320	which happens fairly often.
518320	519600	The healing is also quicker
519600	522400	and you have a lot of control over movement while you do it.
522400	523360	This is good.
523360	525440	I just talked about how good it was being made tactical
525440	526640	the way it was in 2,
526640	528400	but ultimately, as a mechanic,
528400	530720	I think it's more enjoyable to be able to heal quickly
530720	532400	because dying while healing
532400	534240	or dying because you were unable to heal
534240	536000	because tactically it would have killed you
536000	537600	is just never fun or interesting.
537600	539840	If I was to grade all four games' healing methods,
539840	542240	I would put Dark Souls last here
542240	544480	because I don't personally think its method of attrition
544480	546880	is all that fun when it comes down to it
546880	548960	and the precise amount of time it takes to heal
548960	550560	and the way it immobilizes you
550560	552720	makes it always a tantalizing risk
552720	554800	you think you might just be able to make,
554800	556240	which means more players die
556240	558320	trying to heal in this game than any other.
558320	561680	I think Dark Souls 2 is the second best behind Bloodborne
561680	563840	and, hey, that's pretty good.
564000	570880	♪♪
570880	573520	One criticism I see made a lot about Dark Souls 2
573520	575760	is that a lot of the bosses and also a lot of enemies
575760	578000	are what amounts to humanoid people in armor.
578000	579920	This isn't just an aesthetic complaint.
579920	581120	It's also a problem in the sense
581120	582560	that a lot of the fights with enemies
582560	584640	amount to learning how they swing a weapon,
584640	585920	how to get past their weapon,
585920	587440	and which direction their swings go.
587440	589200	And since there's a finite amount of ways
589200	590640	a humanoid can swing a sword,
590640	592560	it's possible to even start confusing enemies
592640	593920	and their attacks for each other.
593920	595600	A lot of bosses are very similar,
595600	596640	unlike the previous game,
596640	598720	which has more of a variety of unique bosses
598720	600720	like the gaping dragon or Nito
600720	603040	or Seath the Scaleless breaking up the monotony.
603040	605360	And indeed, there are quite a lot of humanoid opponents
605360	607840	who fight with swords in what amounts to a duel.
607840	608800	But here's the thing.
608800	610400	I'm gonna make a different argument here.
610400	611680	I'm not gonna argue that the bosses
611680	612960	are all sufficiently different,
612960	614400	which, in my opinion, they are,
614400	616640	or that there are plenty of different kinds of boss fight
616640	617840	breaking up the monotony,
617840	619040	which there is,
619040	621520	but instead I'm going to play the wild card
621520	625280	and be the needless contrarian that people say I am.
625280	628160	I'm gonna argue in favor of dudes in armor.
628160	630320	I think the best kinds of fight in games
630320	632240	are against enemies on roughly equal footing
632240	633040	with the player.
633040	634960	All games, not just Souls games.
634960	636720	There's something viscerally satisfying
636720	637920	about facing off with someone
637920	640080	making use of the same skill set as you.
640080	641760	The best boss fights in Devil May Cry
641760	643600	are the fights against Vergil or Dante
643600	645280	or another human-sized opponent
645280	646800	with another ridiculous sword.
646800	648240	The best boss fight in God Hand
648240	649760	and also gaming history
649760	652880	is against Azel, who has the Devil Hand, and so on.
652880	655040	It's far more compelling to fight a person
655040	657600	making use of skills you yourself could be using
657600	659440	than someone with far more powers than you
659440	661600	or who is an incomprehensible mess.
661600	663840	It feels good, to put it simply.
663840	666160	Dark Souls had a couple of regular enemies in the game
666160	667440	who scratched this itch for me,
667440	670000	like, uh, the NPC invasions,
670000	671200	like Manny to Mildred,
671200	672320	uh, Lautrec,
672320	674160	the crestfallen guy when he goes hollow,
674160	676160	or Oscar when you return to the asylum,
676160	677040	or Rickard.
677040	678560	These kinds of fight are the best
678560	679920	and most memorable.
679920	681440	In fact, I just remember those offhand.
681440	682640	I didn't even put those in the script.
682640	683680	I just decided to list them
683680	684880	because I just know them all.
684880	686560	PvP is so fun in these games
686560	688080	for this exact reason.
688080	690320	You're fighting people on the same footing as you
690320	691920	with access to the same resources.
691920	692640	It's just great.
692640	693760	It's- it's a puzzle
693760	695120	where you all pick your poison
695120	698560	and then you fight to see who is poisoned the most.
698560	699120	Um...
699120	700800	But in Dark Souls, the only boss fight
700800	703760	that comes really close to getting this right
703760	705760	is Artorias in the DLC.
705760	706720	Ornstein and S-
706720	707520	mmm...
707520	708400	kind of did it,
708400	710960	but you were too busy dealing with the other guy,
710960	711520	uh,
711520	712960	so you could never really focus
712960	713920	on the aspect of the fight
713920	716320	that's like this straightforward, cool duel, you know?
716320	717360	And then they get really big
717360	718960	and then it becomes a very different kind of thing.
718960	721360	Artorias is a really, really good fight.
721360	723280	He's not exactly on equal footing with you.
723280	725280	He's presented as a very strong person,
725280	726720	larger than life, literally,
726720	727920	corrupted by evil,
727920	729280	but he's a brilliant fight
729280	731280	because he never comes off as ridiculous.
731280	733520	He even dodges and rolls the way a person would.
733520	735520	You get this fantastic mix of outsmarting
735520	736720	a fellow consciousness
736720	738320	trying to beat you in a straight fight,
738480	739600	Before Dark Souls 2,
739600	741360	I would describe Knight Artorias
741360	743280	as the platonic ideal
743280	744880	of a Dark Souls boss fight.
744880	747760	It's the most pared-down, purified form
747760	749760	of single combat
749760	752080	with another swordsman in the Souls games,
752080	753520	and that's really, to me,
754080	755600	the best thing.
755600	758160	Dark Souls 2 has a lot more of this kind of fight
758160	759360	than the previous two games
759360	760720	and more than Bloodborne also,
760720	762640	and this, I must stress for me,
762640	763840	this is my opinion,
763840	764800	is a gift.
764800	766320	The pursuer, the lost sinner,
766320	767760	the looking-glass knight,
767760	768560	Velstadt,
768560	770160	and in the DLCs, the Fume Knight
770160	772400	and Sir Valon and the Burnt Ivory King.
772400	773680	In my opinion,
773680	776320	these fights are what the Souls games' mechanics
776320	778000	are vessels for.
778000	780240	This is what the game should be built around.
780240	782080	There's even the old Dragon Slayer,
782080	784160	a version of the Ornstein and Smurfs fight
784160	785840	that indulges in this aspect
785840	788240	more than fighting two people at once could do.
788240	789440	I remember telling my friends
789440	791600	that I'd wished there'd been a one-on-one fight
791600	792960	with a character like Ornstein,
792960	794880	perhaps as a mini-boss later on,
794880	796960	and those friends played the PS3 version of 2
796960	798800	while I waited for it to come out on PC.
798800	800480	The first thing they did when it came out
800480	803360	was tell me where to go for a cool surprise over Skype,
803360	806320	and I got the fight I'd wanted from the previous game.
806320	807520	I'm sure people complained
807520	810640	that this was a needless rehash or fan pandering,
810640	811840	but it was literally a fight
811840	813920	I specifically thought would have been fun
813920	815520	and missed not having,
815520	818240	and I'm glad someone working on Dark Souls 2
818240	819120	agreed with me.
819120	820800	Honestly, when I saw early critics saying,
820800	821920	Dark Souls 2 is pretty great,
821920	823840	but you fight a lot of dudes in armor,
823840	825840	I remember immediately thinking,
825840	826800	hell, yes.
826800	828000	There are other kinds of fight,
828000	829120	and it's good to have them,
829120	830320	but they are the best.
830320	832160	Perhaps one of the worst things
832160	834160	about Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1
834160	836640	is they didn't properly master this idea yet.
836640	838800	Demon's Souls had the penetrator, don't laugh,
838800	841440	and some decent NPC fights like Garl Vinland,
841440	843920	the actual final boss of the Valley of Defilement.
843920	845600	I mentioned the ones Dark Souls had,
845600	848720	but 2 elevated these fights to their proper place
848720	851120	as the core kind of fight you did the most,
851120	852320	and I love it for that.
852320	854560	The Heide Knights are criminally underrated.
854560	856640	They deliberately look and fight very differently
856640	858480	from the Black Knights of Dark Souls 1,
858480	859520	and if you let them get up,
859520	860240	which you should do,
860240	861600	because why else are you attacking them?
861600	863200	They sit down and do nothing on purpose
863200	864560	until you want to fight them.
864560	866240	The fight is usually pretty cool.
866240	867360	They kill me a lot,
867360	869920	so I can't show me beating them here really easily,
869920	871920	which would have been nice footage to have,
871920	872880	but, um...
872880	874080	The narrative critics create
874080	875360	when they talk about dudes in armor
875360	877520	is that the developers ran out of ideas,
877520	880000	but with just a slight change in perspective,
880000	881520	it becomes clear that the developers
881520	883120	had a really good new idea,
883120	885040	which was to use more of a kind of fight
885040	887920	that was vastly underutilized in previous games
887920	889360	and worked really well.
889360	890880	Does that really count as a new idea?
891520	892800	Yeah, sure.
892800	894400	Well, I'm gonna claim it is, at least,
894400	895760	and you can't stop me.
895760	898080	It's a fundamental change in the makeup of the game,
898080	899760	and in my opinion, it's for the better.
899760	901840	That's not to say that's the only kind of boss fight, though.
901840	902560	Like in Dark Souls,
902560	904160	there are plenty of different kinds of fight
904160	905120	breaking up the monotony
905120	907840	against bigger bosses like the Last Giant.
907840	909520	Uh, there's unique, one-of-a-kind fights
909520	912000	like the one with Scorpioness Nagica
912000	913600	who visually resembles Quelaag
913600	915440	but is a very different kind of fight,
915440	916080	but there's all kinds.
916080	917120	There's the Royal Rat Vanguard,
917120	918000	there's the Congregation,
918000	919280	there's the Covetous Demon,
919280	922160	there's, uh, Mr. Chariot,
922160	923440	and there's the Dark Lurker
923440	926160	if you couldn't be bothered to go do all the stuff
926160	927840	that you need to do to fight him,
927840	928640	which I couldn't,
928640	930080	so I didn't get any footage of it.
930080	931200	I've also heard the criticism
931200	932320	that there are too many bosses
932320	934080	that consist of fights with large groups,
934080	936000	and this is proof of the game's poor design.
936560	938640	Similar problems extend to other boss fights,
938640	940160	which seem to follow the mantra,
940160	941600	if you can't make it good,
941600	943680	make it difficult by adding more stuff.
943680	945760	This is Matthew Matosis.
945760	947680	His Dark Souls 2 critique video came out
947680	949520	just over a month after the release of the game
949520	951120	in April 2014.
951120	952880	It blew up somewhat on the internet,
952880	954240	to the point that a lot of the times
954240	955920	I see someone in person or online
955920	957360	talking about Dark Souls 2,
957360	958640	they're often using criticisms
958640	960000	that can be heard in this video,
960000	961280	and many who don't like the game
961280	963760	will cite it as a source for their explanation of why.
963760	965760	In fact, when asking viewers for criticisms
965760	967600	that they would want to see me respond to,
967600	969200	the bulk of them linked this video,
969200	970640	and most of the people that didn't
970640	972080	did so because they knew for certain
972080	973840	I would have already seen this one by now.
973840	975200	We're dealing with a piece of criticism
975200	976560	that had, in its own way,
976560	977920	quite a fundamental impact
977920	979440	on discourse surrounding the game.
979440	981440	The arguments got copied, repeated, referenced,
981440	982400	and in many ways, I think,
982400	984000	the prevailing dismissive attitudes
984000	985440	towards the game's quality
985440	987920	started to crystallize as a result of this video.
987920	989920	That's not to say the video is literally to blame
989920	991840	for negativity towards Dark Souls 2,
991840	993360	but regardless, it is necessary
993360	996480	that this critique be defeated and destroyed at all costs.
996560	997920	The mechanics of the Souls games
997920	999840	are built for one-on-one engagements
999840	1001600	thanks to its slow attack animations
1001600	1003760	which are uninterruptible once they start,
1003760	1004800	and a lock-on camera
1004800	1007120	which focuses heavily on a single foe.
1007120	1009280	This early criticism is an interesting one.
1009280	1011200	The claim is that adding more enemies into the game
1011200	1012560	and also into some boss fights
1012560	1014960	is a lazy attempt to increase difficulty,
1014960	1015840	and that this is bad
1015840	1017680	because Souls games are specifically designed
1017680	1020080	to work best against single-enemy encounters.
1020080	1022240	Matthew Matosis is entitled to his opinion,
1022240	1023520	and I respect that,
1023520	1025200	but here's why this is a lie.
1025200	1026800	There are absolutely ways of dealing
1026800	1028320	with larger numbers of crowds.
1028320	1030080	It just requires different behavior
1030080	1031440	than how you normally deal with enemies
1031440	1032880	when there's just one or two.
1032880	1034960	Crowd control is a different skill
1034960	1036880	than the one that you're normally required to test,
1036880	1038560	but it's one that's worth testing
1038560	1040400	and really isn't in previous games.
1040400	1042400	I remember God Hand being criticized
1042400	1043920	for having too many enemies for an engine
1043920	1046080	that was claimed to only really work best
1046080	1047360	in one-on-one fights,
1047360	1048880	but you can look up people playing it
1048880	1050960	and see there's plenty of crowd control,
1050960	1053280	but not if you always play the way you do
1053280	1055040	against just one opponent at a time.
1055360	1057600	Take the prowling Magus fight, for example.
1057600	1059520	If you want to kill one of the crawling undead
1059520	1060560	littering this fight,
1060560	1062320	your eyes need to be taken off the casters
1062320	1064080	at the back in order to lock on.
1064080	1065600	Ah, you see, here's your problem.
1065600	1067760	Matthew makes the supposedly obvious criticism
1067760	1069840	that locking on makes it hard to see your enemy
1069840	1071280	so the fight isn't well-designed,
1071280	1073520	or fights against groups are inherently bad
1073520	1075280	in this type of game or something,
1075280	1077280	but why would you lock on?
1077280	1080000	You see, the Dark Souls series has this amazing feature
1080000	1081920	where, using the right stick,
1081920	1083680	you can rotate the camera
1083680	1085920	to show anything you want on the screen.
1085920	1088000	You can manually control the camera yourself.
1088000	1089200	When you think about it,
1089200	1091360	his argument actually is that the lock-on system
1091360	1093360	works best against single enemies,
1093360	1095120	and he's right about that,
1095120	1096960	but that's why you don't lock on
1096960	1098720	in a fight against multiple enemies.
1098720	1100240	Arguably, the main lesson you're taught
1100240	1101920	as early on as the first real areas
1101920	1103840	is that enemies are attacking from all over the place
1103840	1105280	and you ought to keep your wits about you
1105280	1106480	more than just pressing the button
1106480	1108960	that focuses on one person and hoping for the best.
1108960	1110640	This is a game that prides itself
1110640	1112320	on expecting you to look where you're going,
1112320	1113920	even as far back as the first game
1113920	1115440	with the guy hiding behind the doorway
1115440	1117040	and people hiding in corners
1117040	1118720	even all the way over in Bloodborne.
1118720	1121520	The lock-on system is a tool to be utilized carefully,
1121520	1123520	just like every other ability and mechanic.
1123520	1126320	Matt found the lock-on function was bad in this scenario
1126320	1128720	and concluded that it was a flaw with the game.
1128720	1130720	The challenge in this boss fight, like with the rats,
1130720	1133600	is to avoid getting swarmed and put into a bad situation
1133600	1135760	to keep track of yourself and navigate carefully.
1135760	1137760	If you locked directly onto one of the enemies,
1137760	1138720	you would have a problem,
1138720	1141280	and that means you don't do that.
1141360	1143040	Dark Souls II uses fights like this
1143040	1144800	and a generally different sort of level design
1144800	1146240	to teach you that in this world,
1146240	1149440	sometimes focusing down on a specific individual is a mistake.
1149440	1151280	Matthew didn't like Dark Souls II as much
1151280	1152560	because he didn't learn this lesson
1152560	1154160	and kept trying to play it the exact way
1154160	1155360	he played the previous two.
1155360	1158400	He also invokes the time you fight against the two Dragon Riders,
1158400	1160480	and there's a cute little clip I want to show
1160480	1162000	where he locks onto one
1162000	1163920	and then has to angle himself precisely
1163920	1165120	so he can see the two of them.
1165120	1167680	The twin Dragon Riders are another example of this.
1167680	1169520	You want to avoid attacks from both of them
1169520	1171360	while periodically damaging one of them,
1171360	1173680	but in order to do so, you need to lock onto one
1173680	1175120	and position yourself in such a way
1175120	1176400	so you can see the other.
1176400	1179120	This clip is meant to show how bad the lock-on system is
1179120	1180320	in two-person fights
1180320	1182320	and therefore how poorly designed this fight is
1182320	1184000	for putting this guy all the way over there,
1184000	1185200	but the thing is,
1185200	1187440	you could just not hit the lock-on button.
1187440	1188800	You could just not do that.
1188800	1190640	You can aim the camera wherever you want.
1190640	1192400	You can still dodge and attack.
1193040	1193540	You know...
1193540	1194960	["clicking"]
1194960	1197040	I looked back over the footage of me doing this fight
1197040	1198240	and I didn't lock on at all
1198240	1199280	until one of them was dead
1199280	1202080	and it became a good idea to completely focus on one enemy.
1202080	1203440	This naturally occurred to me
1203440	1205920	because this is how Dark Souls 2 teaches you to play.
1205920	1207440	I honestly think the mechanics
1207440	1209920	and the way they're utilized in the first two games
1209920	1212640	has gotten so ingrained in people who liked those two
1212640	1214160	that it makes them play weirdly
1214160	1215680	in games that work slightly differently
1215680	1217280	or have different kinds of challenge
1217280	1219120	and this strikes them as a flaw.
1219120	1220800	I got some criticism on my last video
1220800	1223440	that it's wrong to say it's possible to play a game wrong
1223440	1225360	and there's a lot of ways of playing Dark Souls
1225360	1226640	and they're all equally valid
1226640	1228480	if that's how the player wants to do it
1228480	1230000	and, yeah, kinda,
1230000	1232400	but all I can say is I can definitely see
1232400	1234640	why Matthew Matosis and other critics
1234640	1236480	had a less good time with Dark Souls 2
1236480	1238080	if this is how they approached it.
1238080	1240800	This looks a whole lot like playing the game wrong
1240800	1242320	and blaming the game for it.
1242320	1244080	I still do really bad in this fight, though.
1244080	1244720	Notice yourself.
1244720	1247520	Just cut away from this quicker in the final edit.
1247520	1249840	Also, we need to edit out the part where I say this, please.
1249840	1252400	Matthew is still trying to use the lock-on mechanic in fights
1252400	1254800	even as late as the Watcher and Defender bosses
1254800	1256320	and he's still using a shield.
1256320	1257440	Aw, bless.
1257440	1259360	Someone really liked the previous games
1259360	1262240	and tried real hard not to unlearn what they learned there.
1262240	1264880	This kind of criticism sheds light on the critical perspective
1264880	1266800	that approached the game in the first place.
1266800	1270400	Players who went into the game expecting it to be exactly like the previous ones
1270400	1272480	inevitably did badly in these sections
1272480	1274800	and seemingly blamed the game for it.
1274800	1277280	Joseph Anderson, a critic who put out three videos
1277280	1279040	about Dark Souls in late 2015
1279040	1281360	and was much less negative about the game,
1281360	1283120	similarly doesn't use the lock-on feature
1283200	1285120	in many of the fights he shows in his video
1285120	1288080	and, like me, he fought most of them without using a shield either.
1288080	1289840	In the same manner that shields are fine,
1289840	1291520	but not if they engender passivity,
1291520	1293200	the lock-on system is a great mechanic
1293200	1295920	that can accidentally engender a reliance upon it.
1295920	1299840	Also, Monster Hunter, a series many regard as very similar in a lot of ways,
1299840	1302640	has basically no lock-on functionality whatsoever
1302640	1305600	and the subhuman criminals who love Monster Hunter
1305600	1308560	seem to do just fine using it to see the enemies however they want.
1308560	1311280	That's not to say Monster Hunter wouldn't benefit from having one,
1311280	1312480	but if it did have one,
1312480	1314480	it would probably be something to use sparingly,
1314480	1316000	much like in Dark Souls 2.
1316000	1318000	Also, it's worth remembering that this type of boss
1318000	1320240	has been present in Souls games for a long time.
1320240	1322080	You might remember, I don't know, the Phalanx,
1322080	1324800	uh, the first real boss in Demon's Souls.
1324800	1327600	It's a fight about balancing the interplay between the actual opponent
1327600	1330240	and the numerous creatures that break off from it and act independently,
1330240	1332480	threatening to surround and overwhelm you.
1332480	1335120	Then, right after, there's the Tower Knight boss fight.
1335120	1337920	Jeez, the first two bosses in the first game in the series
1337920	1340400	and both of the muse mechanics Matthew Matosis concluded
1340400	1343680	are inherently antithetical to the core of the Souls games.
1343680	1346640	What, did the developers not realize how their game worked?
1346640	1350080	If I look onto the Archer, I can't see the Tower Knight unless I stand here.
1350080	1352800	I can't use the function designed for focusing on one person
1352800	1353920	and see everyone else.
1354480	1356960	What, did the B-team design this game?
1356960	1358560	Ahahahahahahaha
1358560	1359520	[(static)]
1359520	1362240	Attacks also lock on to an unnecessary degree.
1362240	1364240	When a boss goes to do an overhead attack,
1364240	1368000	it will usually track the player up until the very last moment before impact.
1368000	1369840	When Matthew Matosis makes this comment,
1369840	1372400	in order to make an example of a superior fight,
1372400	1374880	he cuts to footage of the Adjudicator,
1374880	1378880	the...least memorable fight in the entire Souls series?
1379440	1384400	I forget the Adjudicator exists every time I play Demon's Souls without fail,
1384400	1385200	and then I go,
1385200	1386240	oh yeah, this guy,
1386240	1388720	and I kill him on the first try and forget about him again.
1388720	1392480	His attacks go for where you used to be 10 minutes ago.
1392480	1396560	No aspect of this boss should be the model for how fights should work in Souls games.
1396560	1399680	The simple fact is that in previous entries in the series,
1399680	1403360	circle strafing enemies has been an easy way to cheese a lot of the game.
1403360	1405440	Because the enemies focus in on you more,
1405440	1406240	guess what?
1406240	1408880	You actually have to dodge some of their attacks now,
1408880	1413200	using timing and knowledge of the right direction to move
1413200	1415520	based on judging how the enemy's moving.
1415520	1418800	A lot of the fights Mr. Matosis, if that is his real name,
1418800	1422000	uses to make examples of this apparent horrific problem
1422000	1424400	actually show him mistiming a dodge,
1424400	1427360	or dodging in the direction of the swing.
1427360	1431760	I don't think this demonstrates what he thinks it's demonstrating.
1431760	1435600	Bosses all over the series lock right onto you as their attack goes off.
1435600	1437200	This happens because on some level,
1437200	1439600	the game is about learning how and when to dodge
1439600	1443120	instead of just spinning a circle around someone so they can never hit you.
1443120	1445200	The amount of lock-on enemies have in this game
1445200	1448640	is only a problem if you don't know how to dodge attacks.
1448640	1451280	I honestly think this footage speaks for itself.
1452000	1455200	Here we're getting into the bedrock of some fundamental differences
1455200	1456720	in the way Dark Souls 2 is made,
1456720	1459520	and what it achieves versus the previous game's decisions,
1459520	1462480	both in terms of gameplay and in terms of storytelling.
1462480	1466560	Dark Souls is commonly lauded for being one large interconnected world.
1466560	1469200	I criticized this perception a little in the Bloodborne video,
1469200	1471680	and because I'm a hack, I'm gonna rehash that here.
1471680	1473600	Dark Souls' interconnectedness is fun
1473600	1476000	and creates an interesting sense of being in a real place,
1476000	1478000	and it's cool you can find yourself in a real world
1478000	1480240	and creates an interesting sense of being in a real place,
1480240	1482800	and it's cool you can find ways of getting from one place to another
1482800	1484240	and nice little shortcuts,
1484240	1486800	but it also weakens the game in a lot of ways.
1486800	1488800	Okay, I know that's contentious.
1488800	1490880	I'm not stupid. Hear me out here.
1490880	1493120	It's technically a good thing
1493120	1495760	that the areas lead across and into each other so much.
1495760	1498080	Blighttown, for example, is made more interesting
1498080	1499920	by the fact it connects both the Depths
1499920	1502080	and the Valley of Drakes and the Great Hollow,
1502080	1503760	and it leads to Quelaag's domain
1503760	1506320	and later is used to access the Demon Ruins.
1507120	1509440	However, let's think for a moment
1509440	1511920	about level design and encounter design.
1511920	1514080	When you're designing a world that can be traversed across
1514080	1517200	to all these different places or even simply back and forth,
1517200	1519120	in this case, climbing out of Blighttown
1519120	1520720	once you first kill Quelaag,
1520720	1523360	you're designing a level that makes compromises
1523360	1525600	to be usable in all these ways at once.
1525600	1527440	No enemy encounter can be designed
1527440	1529440	to play really well in one direction
1529440	1530560	because you aren't,
1530560	1532320	and encounters all have to compensate
1532320	1534880	for the fact you're gonna be coming back through it the other way.
1534880	1536160	In fact, at a certain point,
1536160	1538000	it becomes clear the developers realized
1538000	1540560	they'd forgotten to fully compensate for this.
1540560	1542720	The blow dart guys who inflict Toxic on you
1542720	1545760	are basically unavoidable if you're trying to get out
1545760	1548560	because of the inevitable ladder climbing you have to do.
1548560	1549920	So they made them not respawn,
1549920	1551760	so you only ever have to kill them once,
1551760	1553360	and therefore, on your way back out,
1553360	1554960	you probably don't have to deal with them at all
1554960	1556000	because you killed them all.
1556000	1558400	But this also severely compromises
1558400	1560160	the challenge of going down
1560160	1561680	because it means each blow dart guy
1561680	1563840	only ever has to be dealt with once.
1563840	1565680	You can basically just run to them,
1565680	1566720	die killing them,
1566720	1569440	and then carry on in a now much easier area.
1569440	1570800	By having to account for the fact
1570800	1572960	you're gonna have to come back the other way,
1572960	1575680	the fun and challenge of going through it
1575680	1577600	either way is hamstrung.
1577600	1579280	This is not great design.
1579280	1581920	You can even see a more ideal version of Blighttown
1581920	1583360	in Anor Londo.
1583360	1586480	You can only ever fight these enemies this one way,
1586480	1588800	and that means this one way's really interesting.
1588800	1589760	You know?
1589760	1590880	This section's great.
1590880	1593360	There's no way to come back the way you came,
1593360	1594880	but there's also no reason to
1594880	1596480	because once Anor Londo is beaten,
1596480	1599520	you unlock the ability to warp between bonfires,
1599520	1601280	seemingly an acknowledgment that this area
1601280	1603840	makes no sense going through it backwards to get out.
1603840	1605520	Plus, at this point in the game,
1605520	1607360	the developers had definitely realized
1607360	1609200	that running back and forth between areas
1609200	1611200	is actually really tedious.
1611200	1613680	But because warping wasn't really fully fleshed out
1613680	1614640	in Dark Souls 1,
1614640	1616720	there's an awful lot of needless walking.
1616720	1618320	Walking back to bonfires you already lit
1618320	1619360	but can't warp to,
1619360	1620480	walking through long paths,
1620480	1621920	or walking through still long
1621920	1623440	but slightly shorter paths
1623440	1625840	because this one's technically a shortcut,
1625840	1627840	and then you die and you have to do it again.
1627840	1629280	It's not good.
1629280	1630640	It's not the best it could be.
1631600	1633280	I just want to fight Artorias again.
1633280	1634000	It's a cool fight,
1634000	1635840	but there's, like, five minutes of walking
1635840	1637280	every single time,
1637280	1639040	even with this shortcut.
1639040	1639840	And guess what?
1639840	1642080	If you didn't find the bonfire at the Daughter of Chaos,
1642080	1643600	which, by the way, why would you?
1643600	1646480	Because it's a secret hidden behind an illusionary wall.
1646480	1648480	There's no nearby warpable bonfire
1648480	1650000	for beating the Demon Ruins.
1650000	1652240	So, when it's time to go do that bit,
1652240	1652960	guess what?
1652960	1654160	It's time to go all the way back
1654160	1656080	through Blighttown again.
1656080	1657840	Yaaaaaay!
1657840	1659840	Blighttown was so busy leading down
1659840	1661840	into Quelaag's Domain and the Demon Ruins
1661840	1662880	and the Great Hollow,
1662880	1665040	leading across into the Valley of Drakes,
1665040	1666640	and leading up into the depths
1666640	1667840	and its own arse
1667840	1670560	that it forgot to have particularly good gameplay
1670560	1672640	or to have any frames.
1672640	1673600	Hey, check it out.
1673600	1676240	I didn't even need to invoke Dark Souls 2
1676240	1678800	to explain why Dark Souls 1's interconnectedness
1678800	1680240	is bad in a lot of cases,
1680240	1681200	but I guess I should
1681200	1684160	since I'm talking about Dark Souls 2.
1684160	1685920	Dark Souls 2's version of Blighttown,
1685920	1686720	the Gutter,
1686720	1688160	is way better designed
1688160	1690320	because it's built to be journeyed through once
1690320	1691600	in one direction.
1691600	1692640	Once you're in the Gutter,
1692640	1695040	it's literally impossible to climb out, actually.
1695040	1696160	You would have to warp,
1696160	1697920	which you can now mercifully do
1697920	1699040	at the beginning of the game
1699040	1700720	and between any bonfire.
1700720	1701680	It's almost like this game
1701680	1703280	was designed to be played by people
1703280	1704640	who don't want to fucking
1704640	1706320	run around in circles for hours,
1706320	1707520	which is an improvement,
1707520	1709200	I would say, personally.
1709200	1710560	There's a lot of sheer drops
1710560	1711840	and daring leaps.
1711840	1713520	The enemies can be designed purely
1713520	1714880	for this one direction
1714880	1716800	and no other bullshit,
1716800	1717920	like the beetles,
1717920	1719840	which one direction are better than.
1719840	1721200	Enemies only stop respawning
1721200	1722720	if you've killed them so many times,
1722720	1724400	it's clear they're not really a problem for you
1724400	1726560	and you just need to get back to later bits
1726560	1727920	instead of immediately
1727920	1729520	never respawning ever again
1729520	1730800	because the developers knew
1730800	1732560	they were a bit rubbish.
1732560	1734480	The treatment of these areas in particular
1734480	1735760	is emblematic—
1735760	1736560	I love that word—
1736560	1738640	of the game's overall approaches to design
1738640	1740640	and I'm not gonna tell you which one is better,
1740640	1741760	but it's obvious.
1741760	1743360	So far, I've only talked about world design
1743360	1745040	in terms of the ensuing level design,
1745040	1747280	but that's not the only thing impacted by that.
1747280	1749120	There's also an aesthetic component
1749120	1750880	and this, I think, is an aspect
1750880	1752720	that most exemplifies the difference
1752720	1754160	in concerns and goals
1754160	1756800	between the first two Dark Souls games in particular.
1756800	1758880	Dark Souls 1's world has, let's call it,
1758880	1761040	a physical coherency to it.
1761040	1762400	If you're standing in a high place
1762400	1763600	and look in a direction,
1763600	1765120	you will see a place you end up going
1765120	1766080	later in the game.
1766080	1767600	The world of Lordran feels like
1767600	1770000	a physically consistent, objective world.
1770000	1772400	Here's a 3D model of the Dark Souls 1 world.
1772400	1775040	Apart from a few very clearly separated sections,
1775040	1776560	it all physically ties together,
1776560	1777520	which is pretty cool.
1777520	1778960	Meanwhile, in Dark Souls 2,
1778960	1780480	this is far from the case.
1780480	1782880	Plenty of places don't make visual sense.
1782880	1784400	You can get to the top of a tower
1784400	1786240	you physically see in the distance
1786240	1787680	and you can see how tall it is,
1787680	1788960	but then at the tippy top,
1788960	1790400	you find an elevator
1790400	1792320	and it takes you further up
1792320	1793600	into nowhere
1793600	1795600	and you emerge in a lava land
1795600	1797280	that couldn't possibly exist.
1797280	1798400	Theoretically, you could dig
1798400	1799840	a deep enough hole in the ground
1799840	1801440	and all the lava would just flow out
1801440	1803120	into the world below and kill everyone.
1803120	1804720	Remember the compiled 3D model
1804720	1805920	of Dark Souls 1?
1805920	1807760	Here's the model for Dark Souls 2.
1807760	1810640	["Dark Souls II"-style music playing in the background,
1810640	1812880	with a fast-paced drum beat,
1812880	1816160	and a fast-paced drum beat with a fast-paced drum beat
1816160	1819040	and a fast-paced drum beat with a fast-paced drum beat
1819040	1821760	and a fast-paced drum beat with a fast-paced drum beat
1821760	1823760	and a fast-paced drum beat with a fast-paced drum beat
1823920	1826880	It's just they're in the same place.
1826880	1828480	The universe of Dark Souls 2
1828480	1831520	is a nonsensical, free-associative nightmare
1831520	1834080	in which you find yourself in impossible places,
1834080	1836000	architecture giving way to other worlds
1836000	1837120	without warning,
1837120	1839680	the world itself falling apart,
1839680	1841760	becoming physically untrustworthy.
1841760	1844480	It's an Overlook Hotel-style monster.
1844480	1847440	People have criticized the game for being like this,
1847440	1849920	but I have a question.
1849920	1851680	How is this a bad thing?
1851760	1854800	The sense of mystery this creates was really compelling to me
1854800	1856320	as I worked my way through the world.
1856320	1857920	I never knew what I was going to see next
1857920	1859840	because I literally couldn't see it coming.
1859840	1861600	Something I enjoyed about Dark Souls 1
1861600	1864720	was this idea that time itself was beginning to fall apart.
1864720	1867760	You encountered the spirits of those who came before you and died,
1867760	1870560	like you could find their armor on presumably their corpses,
1870560	1873200	and in the DLC, you literally go back in time.
1873200	1874640	The Age of Fire was ending,
1874640	1877920	and reality, on some level, was ending with it.
1877920	1879760	Dark Souls 2 gets to constantly benefit
1879760	1882320	not only from linearity leading to specific visuals
1882320	1884160	along with better-planned encounters,
1884160	1887760	but it's pushed up even further by embracing inconsistency.
1887760	1890160	The result is that you're constantly parading through places
1890160	1891920	that feel like they're out of a fantasy film
1891920	1893520	or an 80s album cover.
1893520	1895840	Take, for example, the Dragon Shrine right here.
1895840	1899920	You get this majestic moment of a secret sky castle.
1899920	1901040	I say that again.
1901040	1904960	Secret sky castle being revealed to you for the first time,
1904960	1907200	completely hidden from visibility
1907200	1908800	until you go up this one elevator.
1908800	1912560	You get this ridiculously epic, in the traditional sense,
1912560	1915440	grandiose shot of a majestic, ornate shrine
1915440	1916960	circled by a dozen dragons
1916960	1919600	revealing itself to you as you go through a passage.
1919600	1921360	You can't see the shrine from the ground,
1921360	1924320	and you can't see any landmarks on the ground below from here.
1924320	1927680	Concrete cohesiveness is thrown out in favor of a puzzling,
1927680	1930800	surprising, and beautiful incohesiveness.
1930800	1934400	We're dealing with two contrasting methods of showing a fantasy world.
1934400	1936640	I say contrasting because, in my opinion,
1936640	1938800	neither is inherently superior.
1938800	1941600	The trouble, I think, is that some either assume this
1941600	1942720	because the first did,
1942720	1944880	or simply wanted what the first had.
1944880	1947920	And that's not quite the same as judging something on its own merits,
1947920	1949520	but I can still see the point there.
1949520	1955040	["Dark Souls II"]
1955040	1957600	I've heard the complaint that Dark Souls II is linear.
1957600	1958960	This is true.
1958960	1961920	Many critics then go on to say that this makes it worse than Dark Souls,
1961920	1963440	which was non-linear.
1963440	1966160	This is treason, and I'll see you in hell.
1966160	1970000	As we just established, Dark Souls is interconnected.
1970000	1971920	It is not non-linear.
1971920	1974000	This is not semantics. This is a big deal.
1974000	1974880	I swear to God.
1974880	1978400	You have clear-cut objectives that you have to complete in a set order.
1978400	1982560	You can technically kill Quelaag first before the bell gargoyles.
1982560	1985120	You can also ignore the depths if you want to.
1985120	1987440	But you have to kill these two bosses,
1987440	1989040	you have to ring two bells,
1989040	1990800	you have to do Sen's Fortress,
1990800	1992320	and then you do Anor Londo,
1992320	1994800	and then you have to collect four Lord Souls to progress,
1994800	1997040	which you can do in any order if you want,
1997040	1998560	but you have to do all of them.
1998560	2000240	This isn't non-linear.
2000240	2003440	This is a choice of which linear path you take first.
2003440	2007440	This sense of linearity is disguised by the interconnectedness
2007440	2010000	and the sense of having to run back and forth through a world
2010000	2012080	because the warps weren't fully fleshed out,
2012080	2013920	but that's not non-linearity.
2013920	2019360	That's actually kind of bad design, uh, masking linearity.
2019360	2020800	At least in Dark Souls II,
2020800	2023520	you don't technically need to beat all four main bosses
2023520	2025360	to unlock the entrance to Drangleic.
2025360	2027120	You can just get a lot of souls.
2027120	2029360	That's actually way more of an alternative
2029360	2031520	than any part of Dark Souls I.
2031520	2033600	For a hugely entertaining comparison,
2033600	2036560	check out the two AGDQ speedruns of the two games.
2036560	2040000	Oh, I started with a Master Key so I can kill the two bosses
2040000	2042800	I have no choice but to kill in a slightly different order
2042800	2044160	if I want to,
2044160	2046720	but I'm, uh, I'm not going to
2046720	2049840	because it turns out the intended way was faster anyway.
2049840	2051600	Fuck you! I used Bonfire Aesthetics
2051600	2052960	to kill the Rotten four times
2052960	2055280	and skip three quarters of the main fucking game.
2055280	2057120	See you in shit, Dark Souls!
2057120	2059920	Also, not only could Dark Souls have easily been less linear
2059920	2060960	if it wanted to,
2060960	2062960	the game fucking contrives itself
2062960	2066240	to ensure that it isn't with needless bullshit.
2066240	2067760	Do you want to beat Seath the Skeletalist
2067760	2069600	before putting the Lordvessel on the thing?
2069600	2070720	Nice try, idiot.
2070720	2072320	Impassable magic fog.
2072320	2073520	Oh, you just beat Quelaag?
2073520	2075840	I want to see what's going on in the obvious path past her
2075840	2077120	that it makes sense to go down
2077120	2079280	instead of climbing all the way back out immediately.
2079280	2080240	Well, fuck you!
2080240	2082160	We put some fucking mist here
2082160	2083920	because we arbitrarily decided
2083920	2085200	you don't get to do this stuff.
2085200	2086720	You got to do the other things first.
2086720	2090000	See you in 10 to 15 hours, you worthless piss hound.
2090000	2091760	Do you want to see what Neato's up to?
2091760	2092880	Tune in next time when—
2092880	2095200	Go fuck yourself, idiot!
2095200	2097840	Do you want to kill the four kings before doing anything else?
2097840	2098880	Well, guess what?
2098880	2099520	You can.
2099520	2101520	You can get their Lord Soul first thing if you want to.
2101520	2103520	You just need Artorias' ring from Sif.
2103520	2104400	Oh, my goodness.
2104400	2106960	There's so much freedom in these games.
2106960	2109360	A similar mechanic is used in Dark Souls II,
2109360	2112160	but it's with doors that are off the beaten path,
2112160	2115440	do not block the most obvious form of progress,
2115440	2116960	and you might even forget about them
2116960	2118240	until you get the king's ring
2118240	2120240	and realize that's the symbol of the king
2120240	2121280	they were talking about,
2121280	2123040	and it's like you figured out a mystery
2123040	2125440	and you get to watch an ancient fantasy door
2125440	2127120	slowly unlock when you put it on.
2127120	2128640	I like ancient fantasy doors.
2128640	2131040	They're—they're a thing that I'm into.
2131040	2132880	That sounds really weird, but I mean that.
2132880	2134080	I like cool doors.
2134720	2135280	Shut up.
2135280	2135920	They're nice.
2135920	2136800	It's a nice door!
2141040	2142400	On top of all of that,
2142400	2145920	Dark Souls II has a very different kind of design overall
2145920	2148000	with an enhanced focus on player freedom
2148000	2149280	in the actual fights,
2149280	2150560	which are the things that you spend
2150560	2152240	most of the time doing in these games.
2152240	2154400	Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1's encounters
2154400	2156800	are, in a sense, kind of restrictive.
2156800	2158400	Each area and encounter,
2158400	2160160	by which I mean distinguishable fight
2160160	2161680	between a group in the game,
2161680	2164560	exists to test the player in some specific way.
2164560	2166480	The Tower Knight exists to test
2166480	2167760	how you deal with an encounter
2167760	2169040	with one big slow enemy
2169040	2171440	supplemented by a multitude of ranged attackers.
2171440	2172720	The player can use any items
2172720	2174480	they have at their disposal to deal with this—
2174480	2176800	magic, swords, shields, items, or what have you—
2176800	2178960	but crucially, the same skill is being tested
2178960	2180000	no matter what,
2180000	2182480	namely, how you deal with this one situation.
2182480	2183920	So no matter what your loadout was—
2183920	2188960	you know, axe, big sword, daggers, magic, arrows—
2188960	2191120	you're either dodging a ridiculous amount of arrows
2191120	2192080	to fight this guy,
2192080	2194400	or more likely taking out all the archers one by one
2194400	2196000	with whatever you happen to have on you
2196000	2197680	and then engaging the knight on his own.
2197680	2199280	The archers on the walls of Anor Londo
2199280	2200480	exist to test how you deal with
2200480	2201600	walking down a straight path
2201600	2203280	with attacks that can easily knock you off.
2203280	2205040	No matter what sort of character you are,
2205040	2207680	the same thing is being tested no matter what,
2207680	2209280	and you have to employ the same skills
2209280	2210720	to get past it no matter what.
2210720	2213520	You're literally walking a straight, linear path.
2213520	2215200	A lot of the first two Souls games
2215200	2217440	are based on putting you in a specific place,
2217440	2219440	then throwing a specific thing at you
2219440	2222240	and making you deal with it the way they want you to do.
2222240	2223200	In Sen's Fortress,
2223200	2225040	you're walking between the same sets of traps
2225040	2227600	and negotiating the same fortress in the same way
2227600	2229600	no matter what character you built.
2229600	2230640	In all of these examples,
2230640	2232720	the focus is on an enclosed space
2232720	2235040	so you can be forced into dealing with the scenario
2235040	2237520	the developers want you to engage with.
2237520	2240560	Ironically, despite being supposedly way more linear,
2240560	2242080	Dark Souls 2 is generally designed
2242080	2243920	in a much more free, open way
2243920	2245600	in regards to its encounters.
2245600	2247840	Encounters take place in a much wider open area
2247840	2249360	with a focus on having more space
2249360	2251120	to navigate as you see fit.
2251120	2252880	Pair ogs on play.
2252880	2254720	In this room, there are several knights.
2254720	2257520	The knights are very difficult to face as a bunched-up group,
2257520	2260080	but if you want, you can lead them out onto the battlements
2260080	2261920	where they're unable to attack all at once.
2261920	2263760	However, there's a risk of falling off
2263760	2266000	and there's a guy in the distance shooting arrows at you.
2266000	2268320	The player is encouraged to know where they want to fight
2268320	2271680	and make decisions about how to engage in the combat
2271680	2273440	beyond knowing when to dodge
2273440	2276160	in fights against more manageable amounts of enemies.
2276160	2277840	This approach generally extends
2277840	2279200	throughout the rest of the game.
2279200	2280800	This increases player freedom
2280800	2283280	by letting them decide precisely how and where
2283280	2284480	to pitch their battles,
2284480	2286000	and mobility and positioning
2286000	2288240	become much more important aspects of the game.
2288240	2291200	Combat is much more free form as a result.
2291200	2294480	Archers in the previous games are, let's call it, forceful.
2294480	2296320	They're put there, and you have no choice
2296320	2297280	but to deal with them.
2297280	2299120	They're usually supplementing a different enemy,
2299120	2300640	so you either have to deal with them
2300640	2302480	while the archers are shooting at you,
2302480	2304640	or you have to take time out before that fight
2304640	2305760	just to deal with the archers
2305760	2307280	before resuming it unhindered.
2307280	2309440	And if you die, you have to take the time out
2309440	2310880	to deal with the archers yet again,
2310880	2312400	along with walking all the way back
2312400	2313600	through a gauntlet of enemies,
2313600	2315920	which, in these games, always respawn.
2315920	2317760	God, that sounds like fun, doesn't it?
2317760	2318960	I wonder why, statistically,
2318960	2320880	so many people stop playing here.
2320880	2322000	I wonder.
2322000	2322720	I-I...
2322720	2324400	Maybe it's the player's fault.
2324400	2325840	Ranged attackers in Dark Souls II
2325840	2327520	are tremendously less annoying.
2327520	2329120	Take, for example, the ones in the encounter
2329120	2330320	I already described.
2330320	2332400	The player has the option of engaging the enemy
2332400	2334240	in places the archer can't attack you at all,
2334240	2335520	but fighting in that area
2335520	2337200	has its own particular trade-offs.
2337200	2338960	The player gets to decide
2338960	2340240	how to deal with the archers
2340240	2342000	instead of basically having no choice
2342000	2343440	but to continuously dodge them
2343440	2345120	because this is THE place
2345120	2346800	this fight is supposed to happen,
2346800	2348800	or painstakingly take them out
2348800	2351200	every time you want to do the fight.
2351200	2353200	There's archers and other kinds of ranged attackers
2353200	2354800	in the Forest of Fallen Giants,
2354800	2356240	but there's now room to maneuver
2356240	2358160	and move your enemies away from their range
2358160	2360400	into different areas with different characteristics.
2360400	2361760	Like I said, you get to choose
2361760	2363600	how and where to have these fights.
2363600	2366080	The open space is better for the clump of enemies,
2366080	2368000	but you have to worry about the archer,
2368000	2370320	or you can go for the ranged attackers first
2370320	2372720	and take the risk of being overwhelmed or caught out,
2372720	2374720	but then fight them free from that problem.
2374720	2376240	You can chase after the archers here,
2376240	2377680	but they'll follow you up the ladder,
2377680	2378800	and that'll create a gauntlet,
2378800	2380480	which you then have to avoid by jumping down
2380480	2382480	or cutting through them.
2382480	2384640	This fight can play out a lot of different ways
2384640	2386640	based on how you choose to move within it,
2386640	2388400	whereas in the previous games,
2388400	2390080	it's mostly just you have to do this thing
2390080	2390960	first till you'll die,
2390960	2391920	and then you dodge the attacks
2391920	2393920	and attack them to win,
2393920	2396720	and honestly, Dark Souls 2's better.
2396720	2398320	Often people have criticized this game
2398320	2400800	for having multitudes more enemies to fight at once,
2400800	2403360	and this is an artificial inflation of difficulty,
2403360	2405120	but the thing is, because of Dark Souls 2's
2405120	2407280	vastly different kind of level design,
2407280	2409440	this is simply a different kind of challenge
2409440	2411280	provided to the player than the previous ones,
2411280	2412800	and it's not an insurmountable one.
2412800	2414800	The challenge in areas with tons of dudes
2414800	2417360	is in how you deal with tons of dudes at once.
2417360	2418400	If you're out of position,
2418400	2420880	you'll get displaced and destroyed by the swarm.
2420880	2423200	Videos critical of the amount of enemies in Dark Souls 2
2423280	2425120	will often show you contextless footage
2425120	2428080	of their character surrounded and being ganked to death,
2428080	2430000	and look how unfair this is,
2430000	2431440	but what they're showing takes place
2431440	2433680	after the point where they already messed up
2433680	2435600	by letting themselves get utterly surrounded
2435600	2437040	like this in the first place.
2437040	2439200	The previous games rarely make your strategy
2439200	2440880	when it comes to relative positioning
2440880	2442720	as crucial as Dark Souls 2,
2442720	2443760	but there are a couple.
2443760	2445920	My fave is this bridge in Demon's Souls.
2445920	2447200	Once you stand here,
2447200	2448720	see the guys blocking the end,
2448720	2450240	and turn around and realize
2450240	2452320	every enemy you failed to kill on the way here
2452400	2454320	is now funneling down the other end,
2454320	2457040	you're struck with the beautifully tense realization
2457040	2459360	that if you don't do something now,
2459360	2460560	you're already dead.
2460560	2463200	But many of the main areas and boss fights in Dark Souls 2
2463200	2465120	draw this aspect into critical focus
2465120	2467040	and in a much more freeform way,
2467040	2469440	where instead of simply being trapped in a small area,
2469440	2470640	you're in a large area
2470640	2471680	and have to deal with a group
2471680	2473760	that's actively threatening to surround you.
2473760	2476640	Instead of the passive challenge of a physical choke point,
2476640	2478320	the fight is a reactive challenge
2478320	2480160	in the form of a moving set of enemies
2480160	2481840	that can easily form a choke point
2481840	2482880	with their own movements,
2482880	2484720	which you can then deal with however you like.
2484720	2487120	Fights against groups can play out totally differently
2487120	2488720	based on how you fight in them,
2488720	2490240	and that's just really cool.
2490240	2491840	When a friend was playing through Dark Souls 1
2491840	2492880	and asking for help,
2492880	2494400	I would just tell them literally the thing
2494400	2495920	they were meant to do to get past that area,
2495920	2497840	because usually there was one main way,
2497840	2498720	and if you didn't know what it was,
2498720	2499440	it would kill you.
2499440	2500320	In Dark Souls 2,
2500320	2502160	the same friend never had to ask for advice
2502160	2503920	because they were free to figure it out.
2503920	2504960	There were other ways through
2504960	2506400	based on what things they had with them
2506400	2508320	and how they wanted to do that fight.
2508320	2510000	It was a lot more interesting
2510000	2512480	for players who aren't already mega fans
2512480	2513680	of the first Dark Souls game
2513680	2515920	and what it specifically did with fights.
2515920	2518080	I think people who want to be critical of Dark Souls 2
2518080	2519440	can look at the amount of enemies and go,
2519440	2520720	ah, they just threw more in,
2520720	2522720	but the entire design of the game
2522720	2525120	is almost fundamentally different in so many ways
2525120	2528000	that I really don't feel like that's an accurate comparison.
2528000	2530000	The Shrine of Amarna has a ton of magic users,
2530000	2531920	but they're in an area where firing back at them
2531920	2532880	is finally doable,
2532880	2534640	unlike the archers in the Tower Knight fight
2534640	2535920	or the Demon fight,
2535920	2537680	and you can use magic or arrows
2537680	2539200	based on what you have with you.
2539200	2540320	Dodging them is trivial
2540320	2542000	because you can see the attacks coming
2542000	2543760	far more than a bunch of tiny arrows,
2543760	2545680	and there's plenty of cover you can utilize
2545680	2546720	in various different ways
2546720	2547680	so you can fight enemies
2547680	2550000	while not in the way of magic if you want to.
2550000	2552720	The final run to the boss is famously very tough,
2552720	2554400	but this is a fairly late game area
2554400	2555680	in a Dark Souls game.
2555680	2558560	It being hard is kind of the thing
2558560	2560560	that you paid to do.
2560560	2562480	Also, I just summoned for it.
2562480	2563680	It's okay. I don't have a problem with it.
2563680	2564800	They usually die during the fight,
2564800	2566000	and that makes it interesting
2566000	2567840	because it's like you take casualties
2567840	2569040	and then you carry on.
2569120	2569760	I like it.
2569760	2571360	I like summoning in these games.
2571360	2572640	There's a bunch of purists out there
2572640	2572960	who are like,
2572960	2574320	I never summon for any fights
2574320	2576640	because I want to be the best.
2576640	2577920	I want to handle them all.
2580400	2582000	I mean, sure.
2582000	2583440	Yeah, good for you.
2583440	2585280	I'm sure it feels tremendously good,
2585280	2586240	and it must be really annoying
2586240	2586800	that there are fights
2586800	2588800	that you really, really should summon for,
2588800	2591680	but I like having friends
2591680	2593920	who join me and do stuff.
2593920	2594560	I like that.
2595120	2596720	Speaking of having friends,
2596720	2598640	Dark Souls 2 lets you have friends.
2598640	2600800	There are even rings your character can wear
2600800	2602640	that mean it's really easy to single out
2602640	2604960	exactly who you want to summon.
2604960	2607680	You can have friends in Dark Souls now.
2607680	2609440	The network isn't going to melt down.
2609440	2610560	You're not going to have to install
2610560	2612160	a bunch of third-party mods
2612160	2613680	and hope that makes it work.
2615040	2617200	The game works now, guys.
2617200	2618800	I don't want to be seen to be dismissive
2618800	2621120	and just say people who die a lot
2621120	2623040	in group encounters are just bad at it
2623040	2625440	and their criticism is false.
2625440	2626640	That would be really stupid
2626640	2628240	to just say out loud like that.
2628240	2630640	So instead, I said it over...
2631600	2632160	10 minutes.
2632160	2641120	♪♪
2641120	2642240	Some of you might be familiar
2642240	2643600	with my video about Bloodborne.
2643600	2645360	It kinda revolutionized
2645360	2647680	the face of game design for all time.
2647680	2648240	Just kidding.
2648240	2650320	But it did kind of invent a newish concept,
2650320	2651280	at least I think it does.
2651280	2653040	I haven't heard anyone else using it before,
2653040	2654400	called play conditioning,
2654400	2655920	which refers to the way a game
2655920	2656960	leads you to play it
2657040	2659120	with the execution of its mechanics.
2659120	2660960	When a game kills you very easily,
2660960	2662240	tells you to prepare to die,
2662240	2663200	and hands you a shield,
2663200	2664400	and teaches you how to use it,
2664400	2665520	you're taught specific rules
2665520	2666480	about that game's world
2666480	2667520	and it sticks with you.
2667520	2668880	The rest of the game experience
2668880	2669920	could have been better served
2669920	2671520	by a different early approach,
2671520	2673360	but you've been quite definitively taught
2673360	2674480	a specific one
2674480	2675600	and it'll probably be a struggle
2675600	2676560	to unlearn it.
2676560	2677760	I brought this up in the video
2677760	2679040	to make the point that Bloodborne
2679040	2680640	quite deftly pushes the player
2680640	2682320	into a more frenetic direction
2682320	2683600	with a few subtle changes
2683600	2684720	to its base mechanics
2684720	2686960	and much wider reaching executions
2686960	2688240	of those mechanics.
2688240	2690400	There is still one or maybe two
2690400	2691360	shields in the game,
2691360	2693600	but you don't find them for so long
2693600	2695440	that you learned not to use them.
2695440	2697040	They exist almost to show you
2697040	2699200	that you never really needed them.
2699200	2701440	The shield engendered passivity.
2701440	2703520	That wording's actually kind of genius.
2703520	2705200	The game's own item description
2705200	2707440	directly blames shields themselves,
2707440	2709040	not players for not realizing
2709040	2710560	how they're supposed to use them.
2710560	2712400	I think that's really clever
2712400	2713760	and also an honest admission
2713760	2714960	that they kind of messed up
2714960	2716160	in Dark Souls 1.
2716160	2717840	Some folks disagreed with my comments
2717840	2718720	that playing with a shield
2718720	2720080	was an inherently wrong,
2720080	2721600	slow, overly defensive,
2721600	2722720	or boring way to play,
2722720	2724240	and I do have to stress
2724240	2725600	that's just my opinion.
2725600	2727440	You can play the games however you want.
2727440	2728720	I'm just describing how the game
2728720	2730480	is most fun in my opinion
2730480	2731680	and the ways I think the game
2731680	2732960	leads people to play it
2732960	2734000	in those more fun ways
2734000	2735040	than the previous ones.
2735040	2736480	While Bloodborne is undisputedly
2736480	2737520	the master of this,
2737520	2738560	Dark Souls 2 does a lot
2738560	2739680	of really great things
2739680	2741120	with play conditioning also,
2741120	2742480	things that other critics dismiss
2742480	2743440	as minor tweaks
2743440	2744960	or just don't talk about at all.
2744960	2745920	In the Bloodborne video,
2745920	2747360	my central example was the shield,
2747360	2748960	and we might as well start there too
2748960	2749760	because people don't
2749760	2750720	fucking mention this.
2750720	2752160	Dark Souls 2 has shields.
2752160	2753200	It has plenty of them,
2753200	2754080	and they're fine.
2754080	2754720	They work well,
2754720	2756400	and you can get some very defend-y ones
2756400	2757600	that do all the stuff you need,
2757600	2758640	and you can buff them
2758640	2760080	lots of different ways too,
2760080	2761520	but here's the thing.
2761520	2763360	Only one class
2763360	2765360	starts with a shield at all
2765360	2766880	in Dark Souls 2.
2766880	2769040	In fact, that class, the warrior,
2769040	2771520	begins life with a broken sword.
2771520	2772320	Every other character
2772320	2773360	starts with some semblance
2773360	2774560	of a fighting setup.
2774560	2776080	The knight has a broadsword,
2776080	2778160	the swordsman has two plus one swords,
2778160	2780000	the bandit has an axe and a bow,
2780000	2780800	and so on.
2780800	2782080	Starting with a shield
2782080	2783440	handicaps you in many ways
2783440	2784400	at the start of this game.
2784400	2786320	It forces you to use ingenuity
2786320	2787360	to get access to a weapon
2787360	2788400	that's more viable.
2788400	2790400	It's not even that great a shield.
2790400	2792000	Other classes having no shield
2792000	2794000	are forced to use dodging or parrying
2794000	2795920	or make good use of what they're given.
2795920	2798240	This is a tiny, tiny, simple change
2798240	2800000	to just starting loadouts,
2800000	2802240	but it's fantastic design.
2802400	2803600	It alters the shape
2803600	2805680	of the entire game experience.
2805680	2807920	You're expected, told even,
2807920	2808960	to make use of the engine
2808960	2810000	in a vastly different way
2810000	2810960	from how you're led to think
2810960	2812800	you're supposed to play the first game.
2812800	2814240	Shields you acquire early on
2814240	2816000	don't even block 100% of damage,
2816000	2817360	and you don't have much life,
2817360	2819520	so blocking is treated as a last resort
2819520	2820560	for if you really don't know
2820560	2822080	what else to do about an attack
2822080	2823760	or haven't learned its timing yet.
2823760	2825600	Dark Souls 2 is the first game in the series
2825600	2826800	where you started getting players
2826800	2828400	who were more casually walking around
2828400	2829440	without a shield at all,
2829440	2830640	preferring two-handing
2830640	2832080	or the new power stance
2832080	2833840	added for dual-wielding characters.
2833840	2835040	By the time you reach shields
2835040	2836400	that actually block lots of damage
2836400	2838400	the way early shields did in the first game,
2838400	2839680	you've employed a level of skill
2839680	2841120	getting to them that means using them
2841120	2842480	would be a waste of a good hand
2842480	2844240	you could be keeping another weapon in
2844240	2845120	or some magic.
2845120	2846240	Dodging like this would have seemed
2846240	2848400	like a needless, risky waste of time
2848400	2850080	to the old me if I had a shield
2850080	2852160	and could block the damage perfectly well,
2852160	2853680	but it would have been so slow.
2853680	2855120	You don't need Dark Souls 2
2855120	2856560	to teach you to play this way, obviously.
2856560	2857600	You can figure it out
2857600	2858720	if you do a lot of practicing
2858720	2860080	or look up a lot of YouTube videos
2860080	2861680	or do PvP or whatever,
2861680	2863520	but being forced to play that way
2863520	2864480	by the game
2864480	2866560	makes you learn it so much faster.
2866560	2868240	Other touches can be seen here, too,
2868240	2869200	like parrying.
2869200	2870880	In Dark Souls 1, parrying offered
2870880	2872480	a brief, clumsy moment
2872480	2873680	to get in a riposte.
2873680	2875360	Oh, and you can't even do a riposte
2875360	2877520	if you're two-handing in Dark Souls 1.
2877520	2880000	Thanks, fuckers.
2880000	2881840	The sound effect was satisfying
2881840	2882880	but hard to make out
2882880	2884400	if anything else was happening.
2884400	2886400	The window to respond was short
2886400	2887680	and the animations that played
2887680	2888720	where enemies were parried
2888720	2891040	were often really short and vague.
2891040	2892720	I didn't parry a lot in Dark Souls 1
2892720	2894480	because, frankly, I didn't trust the game
2894480	2896240	enough to let me capitalize on it.
2896240	2898160	In Dark Souls 2, parrying triggers
2898160	2899920	a loud, ultra-cool sound.
2902720	2904880	The enemies fall down in a protracted
2904880	2907120	dear-god-my-entire-world-is-ending
2907120	2909280	animation and stay there for ages
2909280	2911040	while they wait for you to capitalize.
2911040	2913440	This is, in a word, encouraging.
2913440	2915440	You feel like you've made a decisive move
2915440	2917440	and might even have already won.
2917440	2918720	You feel rewarded for learning
2918720	2920000	how an enemy attacks.
2920000	2921680	It's obvious you've pulled it off
2921680	2923280	and you have plenty of time to react
2923280	2924640	to knowing you've done it.
2924640	2926080	I felt, like I said,
2926080	2928240	encouraged to keep parrying.
2928240	2929200	Instead of abandoning it
2929200	2930080	after the early levels,
2930080	2931120	I only really using it
2931120	2932720	on heavily choreographed enemies
2932720	2933840	like I did in 1.
2933840	2935440	Parrying really only came into its own
2935440	2937040	in Bloodborne which handed you a weapon
2937040	2938560	specifically for doing it
2938560	2940960	and made even monstrous enemies parryable
2940960	2942160	but this represents a step
2942160	2943440	in the right direction.
2943440	2945280	I realized, playing Dark Souls 2,
2945280	2947040	that the reason it seemed too hard
2947040	2948640	to get to the level of skill
2948640	2949920	other people were displaying
2949920	2951360	was because getting there required
2951360	2953600	lots of time investment and practice
2953600	2954640	to get around the fact
2954640	2956720	the game itself did a pretty bad job
2956720	2958240	of getting you there by itself.
2958240	2958880	The phrase,
2958880	2960720	"'Get good' has been around for ages
2960720	2962480	but was massively popularized
2962480	2963680	in the Souls community
2963680	2965280	and this is because the gulf of skill
2965280	2966800	is so wide between new
2966800	2968080	and experienced players
2968080	2969360	that it's almost impossible
2969360	2971200	to help someone get on their level,
2971200	2972960	the only advice being, basically,
2972960	2974960	to keep playing until they become good
2974960	2975760	at the game.
2975760	2976960	No matter how you look at it,
2976960	2978640	the fact the community has trouble
2978640	2980400	introducing the game it's built around
2980400	2981760	to new players
2981760	2983520	constitutes something of a problem
2983520	2985440	and this is a problem I feel Dark Souls 2
2985440	2987200	solves with some very careful changes
2987200	2988000	in its design.
2988000	2989040	I said before that I thought
2989040	2990320	Dark Souls was incredible
2990320	2992240	but I owe that to DS2
2992240	2994640	showing me the way to appreciate it properly
2994640	2995680	and the way to approach it
2995680	2997520	in a way that was actually really fun.
2998080	2999520	The blueprint for Bloodborne,
2999520	3001120	the blood print, if you will,
3001120	3002880	of a lot of creative decisions,
3002880	3004400	lies in Dark Souls 2.
3004400	3006240	I'm unsure if it directly inspired
3006240	3008000	the attitudes to shields and healing
3008000	3009680	and level design and so on in Bloodborne
3009680	3010960	but even if it didn't,
3010960	3012720	the way Bloodborne seemingly builds
3012720	3013760	on these ideas for me
3013760	3016240	shows that 2 was a step in the right direction
3016240	3018880	even if it didn't get everything right.
3028880	3031120	Dark Souls 1 is, on a technical level,
3031120	3032480	interesting and complex.
3032480	3033920	The opening cinematic explains
3033920	3035680	the setup of the world of the story.
3035680	3038000	Gwyn and Co. mess up the ancient dragons,
3038000	3040400	build a society using the power of the soul,
3040400	3042560	and people start becoming undead and going mad
3042560	3044080	and the empire eventually collapses
3044080	3045280	when the flames start to go out
3045280	3047040	and Gwyn fucks up trying to fix it.
3047040	3048320	But what the player actually does
3048320	3050240	is run around a mostly empty world
3050240	3051360	killing the people who remain
3051360	3052880	so they can open a big door.
3052880	3054720	There isn't much actual interaction
3054720	3056080	with this story.
3056080	3057520	The stuff about everlasting dragons
3057520	3058480	and a war to kill them all
3058480	3059920	doesn't really have much of an impact
3059920	3060960	on the story of the player
3060960	3062240	killing the people who killed them
3062240	3063360	and nicking their souls.
3063360	3065600	What the first game excels at is lore.
3065600	3067440	In the sense that through item descriptions
3067440	3068400	and chance encounters
3068400	3069840	with the people who remain in the world
3069840	3071280	and are safe to talk to,
3071280	3073840	you can learn little tidbits about them as people.
3073840	3075040	You can run into a character,
3075040	3076480	have a brief conversation,
3076480	3078480	and be sure that if you pay attention to the world
3078480	3080480	and objects related to them or their people,
3080480	3082640	you'll learn something about them and their culture.
3082640	3084320	The closest you get to a story
3084320	3086240	is a guy saying ring some bells.
3086240	3088320	There's an old saying in my family.
3088320	3089840	Fuck your family.
3089840	3091200	This is the reason for the whole mission.
3091200	3092400	Like, you meet this guy who's like,
3092400	3095200	you know, my family have this fucked up stupid belief.
3095200	3097040	Or another guy saying ring some bells.
3097040	3099040	Or a serpent saying, hey, Gwyn was cool.
3099040	3100080	Kill his friends.
3100080	3101680	Or a different serpent saying,
3101680	3103040	Gwyn wasn't cool at all.
3103040	3104320	He was really rude.
3104320	3105360	Kill his friends.
3105360	3107040	The fun of the game comes from figuring out
3107040	3109360	a complete picture of what you can find,
3109360	3111280	but there isn't really a narrative
3111280	3112720	happening for most of it.
3112720	3114400	The player isn't really given a chance
3114400	3117040	to interact with the important events in this world.
3117040	3118320	They're just picking up the pieces
3118320	3119920	of stuff that already happened.
3119920	3121600	In comparison, to me,
3121600	3124240	Dark Souls 2 does something really interesting.
3124240	3126640	You get a cool metaphorical sequence in the opening
3126640	3129360	where a Darkseid-branded character's family
3129360	3131520	melts away under the weight of the curse
3131520	3134080	making you live so long you forget everything.
3134080	3136080	Already we're given our first proper theme,
3136080	3139040	and it works on both the personal and world level
3139040	3141680	in that the world is making less and less sense
3141680	3143360	because things are falling away,
3143360	3145440	which, by the way, coincides really well
3145440	3147440	with the fact the world design is like that.
3147440	3148880	The story itself, to start with,
3148880	3151520	is self-consciously a rehash of the previous game.
3151520	3154080	The Emerald Herald tells you you need to face the king,
3154080	3156240	and to do that, you need some big souls.
3156240	3158160	Oh, cool. Thanks. Nice one.
3158160	3159120	So you do that.
3159120	3160400	Along the way, you find areas
3160400	3163680	and bosses strangely evocative of the previous ones.
3163680	3167840	Nadjka is, shall we say, Quelaag-adjacent.
3167840	3170640	The gutter is very Blighttown-y, and so on.
3170640	3171760	There's a lot of parallels,
3171760	3173360	but it's never quite made clear
3173360	3175680	that you're explicitly in the same world as Lordran
3175680	3177760	or at least not the same places.
3177760	3179840	There's just a subtle thing in the back of your head
3179840	3182080	about how this all seems oddly familiar.
3182080	3183200	So you kill all the enemies,
3183200	3185280	and on the way, there are these occasional locked doors.
3185280	3188000	There's no explicit sense that you're missing any large areas.
3188000	3189760	All the paths terminate in dead ends
3189760	3192480	or weird shrines with the primal bonfires in them.
3192480	3195120	The game is pretty long just accounting for these four paths.
3195120	3196560	So when you go to Castle Drangleic,
3196560	3198560	you get the sense this really is the end game.
3198560	3200240	You progress all the way through the castle
3200240	3201280	to the shrine beneath,
3201280	3203040	and then through the Grave of Saints.
3203040	3204720	There's a real sense of build-up.
3204720	3205840	Then you fight Velstadt,
3205840	3207680	who's guarding the door to Vendrick.
3207680	3208720	After beating him,
3208720	3211440	you finally go to meet your presumably final opponent,
3211440	3215040	the same final opponents you fought in Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1,
3215040	3217680	the corrupted king of the world you've been walking through.
3217680	3220080	But instead, this happens.
3241520	3244880	Vendrick is a shadow of the man talked about in the lore
3244880	3246560	and by the characters that remember him.
3246560	3248480	He, like the fate of the rest of the undead,
3248480	3250720	like the player's character will eventually become,
3250720	3251920	has lost his mind.
3251920	3253760	You don't have to fight Vendrick at all.
3253760	3255120	He's not your enemy.
3255120	3258160	He's just a man who lost his way and everything else with it.
3258160	3260800	It's hard to relate how touching this is.
3260800	3262880	The game genuinely feels like it was building
3262880	3265040	to the very final confrontation.
3265040	3267280	It's a game about a man who's lost his way,
3267280	3269120	and he's trying to find his way back.
3269120	3271600	It was building to the very final confrontation.
3271600	3274160	The room is built to have a dramatic passage down steps
3274160	3275600	similar to the lead-up to Gwyn,
3275600	3278240	and it's built so that the camera naturally passes through it
3278240	3280720	to reveal what Vendrick has become.
3280720	3282000	I feel bad for spoiling it
3282000	3283760	for people who haven't experienced the game yet,
3283760	3286640	but this moment is pivotal to what makes the story interesting.
3286640	3288960	You're built up for the traditional Souls game encounter
3288960	3290080	with a fallen king,
3290080	3291520	and instead you're faced with a thing
3291520	3294080	to whom it doesn't even occur to fight you anymore,
3294080	3295920	shambling around almost naked.
3295920	3297680	You just have to pick up the king's ring,
3297680	3299120	which unlocks the final areas
3299120	3300960	and allows you to head to Aldia's keep
3300960	3302560	and eventually meet the ancient dragon
3302560	3304480	who's also not interested in fighting you.
3304480	3306240	He gives you the Ashen Mist Heart,
3306240	3308560	which lets you journey into the memories of giants
3308560	3310400	from the old war Vendrick fought.
3310400	3311920	You get to see a lot of the damage
3311920	3314000	that you encounter in the main path happening.
3314000	3315120	It's really neat.
3315120	3317360	Killing the giant lord lets you face Nashandra,
3317360	3319280	Vendrick's queen, at the Throne of Want.
3319280	3322000	Killing her nets you precisely one ending.
3322000	3323360	Your character sits on the throne,
3323360	3325200	presumably having become the new king,
3325200	3326720	and then the credits play.
3326720	3328400	But instead of resetting the game,
3328400	3329600	it just carries on.
3329600	3331040	You're put back in the world.
3331040	3333040	The game deliberately undercuts its story.
3333840	3334340	You win,
3334960	3336080	but what do you win?
3336720	3338720	Kingship over a dying world?
3338720	3340320	The chance to sit in a chair?
3340960	3342160	Only one character in the game
3342160	3344320	even recognizes you as the new king,
3344320	3346640	Shal'Kuar, the seemingly immortal cat
3346640	3348400	who also knows most of the rest of the lore
3348400	3349680	about the other bosses.
3349680	3350480	If you want to,
3350480	3352880	you can use bonfire ascetics to refight old bosses
3352880	3354640	or refresh enemies if you exhaust them,
3354640	3356560	or you can completely kill all the NPCs
3356560	3357760	even the Emerald Herald.
3357760	3359360	You can make the world of Dark Souls 2
3359360	3362320	completely empty of people and monsters.
3362320	3364000	The only way to access New Game Plus
3364000	3365520	is to sit at a bonfire
3365520	3368000	and deliberately choose to start it all over again.
3368000	3369120	I like these choices
3369120	3370960	because they hammer home the hopelessness
3370960	3373120	of the Dark Souls story that was there in one,
3373120	3374480	but undercut by the fact
3374480	3375760	no matter what ending you got,
3375760	3377520	you just started at the beginning again.
3377520	3379680	Dark Souls 2 forces you to contemplate
3379680	3381120	how little you've really achieved
3381120	3382320	with all these deaths,
3382320	3384080	and then forces you to decide
3384080	3385920	when it's time to do it all again.
3385920	3388720	Ultimately, Dark Souls 2 is about cycles.
3388720	3390400	The story is deliberately evocative
3390400	3391600	of the previous game,
3391600	3393600	exploring the empire of a king who fell,
3393600	3394880	but with an explicit focus
3394880	3397040	on how this has all happened before,
3397040	3398880	and not just coincidentally.
3398880	3401440	Perhaps it's something we're doomed to keep doing.
3401440	3402000	Humanity,
3402000	3404720	perhaps unable to ever fully escape its own nature,
3404720	3407200	is repeating its mistakes over and over.
3407200	3409280	For a game with so much architecture and character
3409280	3410720	in so many of its designs,
3410720	3413200	the best piece of imagery is the simplest one,
3413200	3415120	the symbol of the dark sign.
3415120	3416800	It's a loop, a circle,
3416800	3418800	reflecting the way the undead return to life
3418800	3419840	no matter what,
3419840	3422160	continuing even after they lose their minds.
3422160	3424960	Humanity itself is trapped in this loop.
3424960	3426960	The story is much more for the player
3426960	3428080	than in the previous game.
3428080	3429760	It's a story in which the player is expected
3429760	3431200	to contemplate their own actions
3431200	3432480	instead of those of others,
3432480	3434080	and recognize that the problem here
3434080	3436240	isn't the mistakes of the king or his people,
3436240	3438480	but that people as a whole were unable to escape
3438480	3440720	the mistakes that happened in Dark Souls 1.
3440720	3442640	But what's even better is how it makes sure to tell you
3442640	3444080	this isn't just one repeat.
3444080	3446080	No, the story of Dark Souls 1 has happened
3446080	3447760	maybe countless times,
3447760	3450960	so many you don't know and will never fully comprehend it.
3450960	3452800	In a prison cell in the Lost Bastille
3452800	3454240	is a man made of stone.
3454240	3456080	If you unfreeze him, he refers to himself
3456080	3457920	as Straid of Olaphis.
3457920	3460640	Olaphis was a kingdom where Drangleic now stands,
3460640	3462400	untold generations ago,
3462400	3465120	so long ago that no one but Straid
3465120	3466880	and the descriptions of spells and items
3466880	3469040	invented by him or belonging to him
3469040	3470160	even mention it.
3470160	3472400	In Dark Souls 1, all the various areas and people
3472400	3473680	and their stories and what happened
3473680	3476000	can be pieced together quite meticulously.
3476000	3477440	You can, with enough work,
3477440	3480240	put together a complete universe out of the facts.
3480240	3483440	In Dark Souls 2, an entire civilization
3483440	3485120	can be so utterly lost
3485120	3487840	that only one man even knows its name.
3487840	3489840	Who knows how many empires rose and fell
3489840	3491280	between Olaphis and Drangleic
3491280	3493200	or Lordran and Drangleic,
3493200	3495600	but pieces of them lie scattered everywhere,
3495600	3497520	decayed, colossal wrecks,
3497520	3499280	each with their own rise to power
3499280	3500480	and their own mad kings
3500480	3502800	and their own undead curse rending them apart.
3502800	3505040	The Forest of Fallen Giants is Vendrick's doing,
3505040	3506240	but Earthen Peak?
3506240	3507440	The Old Iron Keep?
3507440	3509840	These places rose and fell on their own terms.
3509840	3511680	The DLC, which we'll get to later,
3511680	3513840	each covers its own completely separate tale
3513840	3515360	of a kingdom that rose and fell
3515360	3516800	in roughly the same area.
3516800	3517920	What's compelling about this
3517920	3519120	is that it's more bizarre,
3519120	3520240	more unexplained,
3520240	3521680	and more human.
3521680	3523680	People in the Souls universe are victims
3523680	3525920	of a history they might never be able to learn.
3525920	3528240	The story is about being lost
3528240	3530720	in a confusing maze you can never fully understand,
3530720	3532720	a feeling strengthened by the nightmarish
3532880	3534480	of the actual physical world.
3534480	3536640	Quelaag alone was simply a sad story
3536640	3538560	about a woman transformed into a demon
3538560	3540480	by an attempt to create more life,
3540480	3542000	but now she's contextualized
3542000	3544080	as a victim of a far deeper problem
3544080	3546080	that mankind is having trouble escaping,
3546080	3547120	because no matter what,
3547120	3549600	it seems to keep happening over and over.
3549600	3551600	Something really cool and kind of subtle
3551600	3553760	is hidden in the basement of Majula.
3553760	3555280	Down, hidden in the dirt,
3555280	3557200	so small not many people notice,
3557200	3558880	is a small, fractured piece
3558880	3560800	of the Lordvessel from the first game.
3560800	3561920	This is the best expression
3561920	3564320	of what Dark Souls 2 is doing with its story.
3564320	3565680	It's interested in telling a story
3565680	3567920	about being unable to fully piece together
3567920	3568880	what's happening,
3568880	3570400	as the character loses their minds
3570400	3572880	in a doomed world of destroyed statues.
3572880	3574000	Your character doesn't even know
3574000	3575280	what a Lordvessel is.
3575280	3576640	To them, this is nothing,
3576640	3578240	just a thing lying in the dust.
3578240	3580080	It also represents the developers' attempts
3580080	3581840	to do their own thing and move on
3581840	3584160	by reducing an iconic part of the previous game
3584160	3586080	to a piece of rubble in a basement.
3586080	3587920	For me, the weakest parts of the previous games
3587920	3589840	is when I got handed a whole heap of names,
3589840	3591280	roles, and backstory.
3591280	3592400	Demon's Souls did this, too,
3592400	3593680	by just listing a bunch of people
3593680	3594880	who went into the fog.
3594880	3596080	I could just find those people
3596080	3597280	and learn about them manually,
3597280	3598640	but instead, the first games open
3598640	3600240	with a needless role call
3600240	3602160	and a story about a fight with dragons
3602160	3603760	that doesn't really tell me anything.
3603760	3605360	The guys I'm going to kill
3605360	3607600	killed a bunch of dragons a long time ago,
3607600	3609520	and that's important,
3609520	3610800	because...
3610800	3613120	Mmmmmmm.
3613120	3615280	One flaw in the themes of Dark Souls 1
3615280	3616880	was for all its criticisms of the world
3616880	3617840	Gwyn had built,
3617840	3620480	an awful lot of time was dedicated to his kingdom,
3620480	3622000	to exploring its majesty,
3622000	3623920	and even when you darken Anor Londo,
3623920	3625440	you still find yourself compelled
3625440	3627600	to look upon his works and despair.
3627600	3629200	Dark Souls 2 does the most compelling
3629200	3631120	and interesting thing it could possibly do
3631120	3632560	with the story of Gwyn,
3632560	3633680	Lord of Cinder,
3633680	3635040	Master of Anor Londo,
3635040	3636240	King of Lordran.
3636240	3637440	It asks,
3637440	3638400	who?
3638400	3641120	I don't even think he's mentioned by name at all.
3641120	3644400	Gwyn may well have been a good and mighty king,
3644400	3647680	but the lone and level sands stretch far away,
3647680	3649360	and he is gone.
3649360	3652320	The paranoid king who had Straid petrified is gone,
3652320	3653920	the king of Lordran is gone,
3653920	3655760	and the king of Drangleic is gone,
3655760	3658640	but his burnt-out husk still walks the earth yet,
3658640	3661040	and we remember him for now.
3671440	3673360	I think a lot of people wanted
3673360	3676080	a story with the exact type of intricacies
3676080	3677200	of the previous game.
3677200	3678880	I can see wanting that
3678880	3681120	and understand being disappointed,
3681120	3683360	but I prefer the lonesomeness
3683360	3685760	and the unsolvable puzzle you're given
3685760	3688160	of a world where the weight of time
3688160	3690320	has dissolved away most of history,
3690320	3691760	and even the physical world
3691760	3694000	twists into itself in impossible ways
3694000	3697360	and icy peaks can give way to the flames of chaos.
3697360	3700400	It's maddening and majestic at the same time
3700400	3703920	in a way that no concretely designed physical world
3703920	3705520	can ever be.
3705520	3706800	This is imagery.
3706800	3708560	This is visual metaphor.
3708560	3710480	There's doubtless plenty of theory-crafting
3710480	3711600	in Souls lore circles
3711600	3713680	about who the woman with the spinning wheel is
3713680	3715280	when you're told everything you need to know
3715280	3717280	in just how she's presented here.
3717280	3718720	She's deliberately evocative
3718720	3721120	of the fortune-telling spirits with spinning wheels
3721120	3722800	that exist seemingly throughout
3722800	3724720	human mythology and folklore.
3724720	3725520	More specifically,
3725520	3727120	this character appears to be a reference
3727120	3728880	to one of the most popular portrayals
3728880	3730640	of this type of character in film history,
3730640	3732640	the one that appears in Akira Kurosawa's
3732640	3733440	Throne of Blood,
3733440	3735120	also known as Spider-Web Castle.
3735120	3737360	Throne of Blood is an adaptation of Macbeth.
3737360	3739200	In case you haven't heard of Macbeth,
3739200	3741120	Macbeth's about a happy-go-lucky guy
3741120	3743120	whose destiny is to become king,
3743120	3745200	but it turns out being the king
3745200	3747520	isn't all it's cracked up to be.
3747520	3754640	["Spider-Web Castle"]
3754640	3755680	Interestingly enough,
3755680	3756720	right before the character
3756720	3758720	who's a reference to Spider-Web Castle,
3758720	3760480	just to make sure you know they get it,
3760480	3762240	they've just put a spider right there.
3762240	3763440	The appearance of a character
3763440	3765280	seemingly straight out of this film,
3765280	3767440	a film about the darkness befalling people
3767440	3769120	whose destiny is to rule,
3769120	3770720	is a better piece of storytelling
3770720	3772560	than all the item descriptions
3772560	3775040	and all the loot drops in the world.
3775040	3776320	But because it relies on
3776320	3777840	understanding of imagery
3777840	3779280	outside of video games
3779280	3781280	and visual storytelling,
3781280	3782800	none of this information can be found
3782800	3785600	on any wiki about the story of the Souls series.
3785600	3786560	In a way,
3786560	3788000	the story of Dark Souls 2
3788000	3789680	is the ultimate in nerd horror.
3789680	3791440	It tells a story of a universe
3791440	3792640	it's impossible to build
3792640	3795200	a comprehensive fucking wiki about.
3795200	3796240	And to nerds,
3796240	3798400	that's the scariest thing there is.
3798400	3799920	This opening proceeds into
3799920	3801840	a series of destroyed castles,
3801840	3802960	ruined thrones,
3802960	3804640	mad, dead kings.
3804640	3806720	When you finally get your own throne,
3806720	3809200	there's a worrying ambivalence to it.
3809200	3811200	The best Dark Souls 1 could muster
3811200	3813200	was having sad music
3813200	3814640	play over the last boss,
3814640	3817200	and if you look at Jimmy's pants,
3817200	3818880	it tells you how bad he was
3818880	3820240	when he was a kid.
3820240	3821760	Dark Souls 2 puts you
3821760	3823680	into the role of the last boss,
3823680	3825280	becoming patriarch of a world
3825280	3826880	on its way to its doom,
3826880	3829280	ultimately failing to achieve anything.
3829280	3832080	And it asks you how you feel about that
3832080	3833520	and where you go from here.
3833520	3834800	The pacing of Dark Souls 1
3834800	3836320	wasn't great after the Lordvessel,
3836320	3838000	but it did a lot more with a lot less
3838000	3839440	when it came to its plot.
3839440	3841360	Its introductory video set up the world
3841360	3843440	and the major players very efficiently.
3843440	3846480	Efficient storytelling is being placed over
3847440	3849040	good storytelling,
3849040	3851120	or even a good story.
3851120	3852160	I think gamers on the whole
3852160	3853440	are still kind of enamored
3853440	3856000	with a wikipedia-style approach to storytelling,
3856000	3858400	where everything can be concretely pieced together
3858400	3859760	in an objective narrative,
3859760	3861440	when really I think there's a lot of other ways
3861440	3862880	you can explore a story.
3862880	3864720	The intro video to Dark Souls 2
3864720	3866160	shows the main character dropping
3866160	3867600	into some kind of whirlpool
3867600	3869600	because the old lady tells us we're cursed
3869600	3870720	and the only hope of a cure
3870720	3872720	is to go to Drangleic for some reason.
3872720	3874320	She actually says we'll have no idea
3874320	3875200	why we're going to do
3875200	3877120	any of the stuff we're about to do.
3877120	3880640	This visual metaphor for falling into darkness,
3880640	3881280	you know,
3881280	3883760	the thing that going hollow does to your mind,
3883760	3886640	is reduced to falling into
3886640	3888480	some kind of whirlpool.
3888480	3889920	A woman visually coded
3889920	3891520	as having the power to see the future,
3891520	3892960	predicting a horrible fate
3892960	3893760	in which we do things
3893760	3895520	without fully understanding their purpose
3895520	3897040	because we lose our minds,
3897040	3898240	is reduced to
3898240	3899520	the old lady
3899520	3900960	telling us to go to Drangleic
3900960	3902480	for some reason.
3902480	3904720	No wonder this critical approach to storytelling
3904720	3906800	resulted in finding the story lacking.
3906800	3908480	No, this is just an old lady
3908480	3909920	telling us to do things
3909920	3911120	for some reason.
3911120	3913040	There's no nuance or meaning
3913040	3916320	or cinematic language being utilized here.
3916320	3917600	That level of understanding
3917600	3919520	has no place in my
3919520	3921920	nuanced critique of a video game.
3921920	3924320	New Game Plus is the bad ending.
3924320	3926000	You press a button and admit
3926000	3926800	that all that's left
3926800	3928720	is for everything to happen again.
3928720	3929600	There's another ending,
3929600	3931520	which came out when all the DLCs had come out
3931520	3933520	and also adds a new character.
3933520	3934800	I think this aspect of the story
3934800	3935920	is interesting in its own way,
3935920	3937280	but I don't like how people use it
3937280	3939200	as an excuse to criticize Dark Souls 2,
3939200	3940720	pretending there wasn't enough story
3940720	3941600	in the initial release
3941600	3942800	and this is an admission of that
3942800	3944400	and they're finally fixing it,
3944400	3945840	or they're patching the story in
3945840	3947120	in post or something.
3947120	3948560	There's plenty of story,
3948640	3950640	but just not the kind everyone wanted.
3950640	3952080	For me, it was already complete
3952080	3953520	in its incompleteness,
3953520	3954800	but giving the player the option
3954800	3955440	of getting an ending
3955440	3956480	where they beat another boss
3956480	3958320	and walk out is a nice little bonus.
3958320	3959520	It's a nice extra little thing
3959520	3960800	to give people and that's all right.
3964320	3966640	The DLC to Dark Souls 2 is fantastic.
3966640	3968160	Each one experiments with mechanics
3968160	3969520	in cool and interesting ways
3969520	3970640	I don't want to get too far into
3970640	3972320	because we're already pressed for time.
3972320	3973760	Rest assured they're all lengthy enough
3973760	3975120	to feel like worthwhile additions.
3975120	3976960	I'll rattle off the fun stuff I really liked.
3976960	3978640	I like Broom Tower's verticality
3978640	3980240	and the way you unlocked more access
3980240	3981040	from the central hub
3981040	3983120	once you got the key wedge thing.
3983120	3984960	I like Crown of the Old Iron King's gimmick
3984960	3986000	of having the first boss
3986000	3987040	and the Iron King himself
3987040	3988640	be just to your left when you come in
3988640	3989600	and you can take a series
3989600	3990720	of looping paths around
3990720	3992000	to make the first boss visible
3992000	3992800	then go around again
3992800	3993680	once the ice melts
3993680	3995040	to gain access to more soldiers
3995040	3996320	for the Old Iron King fight.
3996320	3997920	You could find and build a little army
3997920	3999120	to help you even out the odds
3999120	4000400	and that's really cool.
4000400	4001840	I like the puzzles that require you
4001840	4003680	to actually use a bow to progress.
4003680	4005440	The Souls games, when it comes down to it,
4005440	4006960	are something of an offshoot from Zelda
4006960	4008640	and its attempt to bring some honest-to-god
4008640	4010400	bow-and-arrow puzzles to the game.
4010400	4011200	It was unexpected,
4011200	4012720	but it fit together quite well.
4012720	4013920	I like these ghost guys
4013920	4015840	who look like phantoms you see online.
4015840	4016880	It actually trips you up
4016880	4017920	when you discover they're real
4017920	4018880	and they attack you.
4018880	4020080	It makes for a cool fakeout
4020080	4021040	I just spoiled for you,
4021040	4022480	so I hope you already played this bit.
4022480	4024400	Sin the Slumbering Dragon is a hard fight,
4024400	4026480	but the first really fun fight with a dragon
4026480	4027760	in basically any of these games
4027760	4028640	for me personally,
4028640	4029760	especially after the optional
4029760	4030800	Ancient Dragon fight
4030800	4032160	which is honestly a chore.
4032160	4033600	In many ways, the DLC embodies
4033600	4035040	Dark Souls 2 in microcosm,
4035040	4036160	being willing to go all the way
4036160	4037600	and experimenting with its mechanics
4037600	4039120	to create new and unique areas,
4039120	4039840	and in doing so,
4039840	4040960	it also comes to embody
4040960	4042400	the very best the Souls series
4042400	4043840	has to offer as a whole.
4043840	4046800	It's everything that I think I ever wanted
4046800	4047840	from a Souls game,
4047840	4050480	and it's part of Dark Souls 2,
4050480	4052000	so Dark Souls 2 wins.
4053200	4055120	Scholar of the First Sin is a second edition
4055120	4056320	of Dark Souls 2 that came out
4056320	4057680	nearly two years ago now.
4057680	4059120	It bundled together the DLCs
4059120	4060400	for the original release of the game,
4060400	4062400	had some graphical and performance updates,
4062400	4064640	and put the items that grant access to the DLC
4064640	4065680	in the world itself
4065680	4066560	as things to find
4066560	4068160	instead of items you simply start with
4068160	4069200	if you owned the DLC
4069200	4070240	in the previous version.
4070240	4071920	This version's really interesting.
4071920	4072880	I'm not going to say good,
4072880	4073680	interesting.
4073680	4074560	Instead of a simple,
4074560	4076320	slightly visually improved bundle,
4076320	4077600	it actually dramatically changes
4077600	4078560	most of the game.
4078560	4080000	Almost all of the enemy encounters
4080000	4081120	and placements have been altered,
4081120	4082080	and the amount of enemies
4082080	4083680	has overall increased massively.
4083680	4085360	I've played Dark Souls 2 multiple times
4085360	4086400	before playing this version,
4086400	4087680	and I found it to be very different
4087680	4088560	and much harder
4088560	4090640	despite superficially being the same game.
4090640	4092000	It's more frustrating too.
4092000	4092960	A lot of people didn't like
4092960	4093600	the amount of enemies
4093600	4095280	you often fight at once in Dark Souls 2,
4095280	4096480	something I didn't have a problem with
4096480	4097360	in that game,
4097360	4098880	but in this it's definitely difficult
4098880	4099760	enough to be annoying
4099760	4100800	even if you know how to deal
4100800	4102000	with groups in this engine.
4102000	4102560	Honestly,
4102560	4104640	the game this reminds me of the most
4104640	4106640	is Super Mario Bros. 2.
4106640	4107840	The Japanese Mario 2
4107840	4110160	is like an optional harder Mario game,
4110160	4110960	pushing the engine
4110960	4112160	and player skill requirements
4112160	4113520	to the absolute limit
4113520	4114880	before it becomes unsellable
4114880	4116240	as a consumer product.
4116240	4116560	Heck,
4116560	4117840	they didn't even bother selling it
4117840	4119040	in the West for a reason.
4119040	4121120	I'd call Scholar a pretty good game.
4121120	4121840	It's challenging,
4121840	4123520	it's entertainingly funny in places,
4123760	4125280	and it's a nice way of playing a game
4125280	4125920	I love dearly
4125920	4127680	in a new, remixed way.
4127680	4128400	However,
4128400	4130160	I have to qualify calling it good.
4130160	4131760	It's good only within
4131760	4133520	the context of Dark Souls 2
4133520	4134800	already existing,
4134800	4135920	of there being about a year
4135920	4137200	of playing the original version
4137200	4138480	to prepare for this one.
4138480	4139760	I would not recommend this game
4139760	4141840	to anyone as a first game in the series,
4141840	4142640	which for some people
4142640	4144480	this might have saddeningly been.
4144480	4146000	It's for people who are diehard fans
4146000	4146880	of the series already
4146880	4148960	or even just fans of 2 specifically,
4148960	4149920	and for those people,
4149920	4151040	even when it's not fun,
4151040	4152400	it's fun as an entertaining
4152400	4153360	little experiment
4153360	4154720	with a bunch of aspects of the game
4154720	4155920	tweaked just enough.
4155920	4157520	It feels almost like a ROM hack
4157520	4158400	of Dark Souls 2
4158400	4159520	they made for fun,
4159520	4160160	and for some people
4160160	4161440	that might be a condemnation,
4161440	4162240	especially considering
4162240	4163760	it's the cost of a full-priced game.
4163760	4165360	So I can't heartily recommend it,
4165360	4166800	but the Soul games are quite difficult
4166800	4168000	to recommend already.
4168000	4169200	Something I like specifically
4169200	4170560	is the entrance to the Earthen Peak
4170560	4171520	from Harvest Valley.
4171520	4172400	There's a couple of enemies
4172400	4173040	in the original,
4173040	4175280	but it seems quite underutilized,
4175280	4176720	like it's a short, quick rush
4176720	4177520	through an area that could be
4177520	4178640	more fleshed out.
4178640	4179200	In Scholar,
4179200	4180560	it's significantly altered.
4180560	4181680	There's way more enemies,
4181760	4182880	it's way more difficult,
4182880	4184160	there's purposeful traps
4184160	4185680	for if you try and run past,
4185680	4186960	and it has more enemy types
4186960	4187760	that appear in, like,
4187760	4189280	two places in the original game,
4189280	4190080	which is nice.
4190080	4190880	There are also more
4190880	4192000	Hidey Nights in general,
4192000	4192640	which is great
4192640	4193920	and something I wanted,
4193920	4195120	and also they're way more aggressive.
4195120	4195760	Some of them get up
4195760	4196800	and go for you now,
4196800	4197840	and that's a really cool thing
4197840	4199040	that you just don't expect
4199040	4200160	if you play the original,
4200160	4201760	and that's really, really fun.
4201760	4202800	Also, something I quite like
4202800	4203600	about both games
4203600	4204960	is that in each one,
4204960	4206160	someone's credentials
4206160	4207440	are called into question.
4207440	4208160	In the original,
4208160	4209280	in Hidey's Tower,
4209280	4210240	the Dragon Rider looked
4210240	4211040	like an idiot.
4211040	4211920	There were no dragons
4211920	4213120	anywhere for most of the game.
4213120	4214800	Why is he called the Dragon Rider?
4214800	4215360	What?
4215360	4216160	That's ridiculous.
4216160	4217600	The guy's obviously lying.
4217600	4219040	But in Scholar,
4219040	4220480	it's the Dragon Slayer
4220480	4221600	just over the way from him
4221600	4223200	who's clearly lying on his resume.
4223200	4224320	There's a dragon right outside
4224320	4225200	his fucking office!
4225840	4227360	Don't get the Scholar edition
4227360	4228400	unless you similarly
4228400	4230080	really like two already
4230080	4230960	and don't approach it
4230960	4232080	as its own game per se,
4232080	4233120	but as another way
4233120	4233920	of playing a game
4233920	4234720	you already liked
4234720	4235840	for what it was doing,
4235840	4236720	and you'll probably
4236720	4237600	have a good time.
4237600	4238400	I honestly want to see
4238400	4239440	more games like this.
4239440	4240080	I would have liked
4240080	4240880	a similar edition
4240880	4241600	along these lines
4241600	4242560	for every Souls game,
4242560	4243120	to be honest.
4246800	4247360	Wait, wait.
4247360	4248080	Hold on a second.
4256320	4256880	Obviously,
4256880	4258160	a lot of game criticism
4258160	4259920	is based on subjective experience,
4259920	4260960	which can't exactly
4260960	4262240	be proven wrong,
4262240	4263120	sadly,
4263120	4263760	but that's not what
4263760	4264960	I'm trying to do here.
4264960	4265920	My aim as a critic
4265920	4267280	isn't just to try and find ways
4267280	4269040	of looking at and analyzing games
4269040	4269680	and their design
4269680	4270400	that are useful
4270400	4271200	and help in forming
4271200	4272640	better ideas of quality,
4272640	4274480	but also to try and understand
4274480	4275600	and explain why
4275600	4277680	other people reacted differently.
4277680	4278720	I've had some pushback
4278720	4279680	from people on some of my
4279680	4281280	long game analysis videos,
4281280	4282480	usually by people who enjoyed
4282480	4283920	a game I was being critical about
4283920	4285600	or didn't enjoy a game I liked
4285600	4286480	or who played the game
4286480	4287600	a way I said was wrong
4287600	4288720	and happened to like it.
4288720	4290320	I in no way mean to diminish
4290320	4291440	other people's experiences
4291440	4292080	of a game.
4292080	4293200	If you didn't like something,
4293200	4294240	I can't reason you
4294240	4295200	into liking it.
4295200	4296320	My aim is to understand
4296320	4297440	why people do or don't
4297440	4298080	like something
4298080	4298960	and learn from that
4298960	4300000	and use the information
4300000	4300640	in my work.
4300640	4301440	I've gone on record
4301440	4302480	as thinking the Souls games
4302480	4303520	are all very good,
4303520	4304240	but that doesn't make
4304240	4305680	other people not liking them
4305680	4307360	or not thinking that wrong.
4307360	4308560	They're useful because
4308560	4309680	you learn why people
4309680	4310800	wouldn't enjoy something,
4310800	4311840	and that's really helpful
4311840	4312960	if you, for example,
4312960	4314000	are interested in what makes
4314000	4315760	a game fun to a lot of people,
4315760	4317520	which is really financially
4317520	4319040	lucrative nowadays.
4319040	4320160	I feel the games got better
4320160	4321440	at correcting the sort of problems
4321440	4322800	that caused not a lot of people
4322800	4324080	to enjoy them early on,
4324080	4325600	at least without a lot of friction
4325600	4326240	at the start,
4326240	4327600	and somewhat interestingly,
4327600	4328400	helped them go back
4328400	4330160	and appreciate the previous ones.
4330160	4331040	Everyone's entitled
4331040	4332160	to their opinion,
4332160	4333120	and in my opinion,
4333680	4335040	every other game critic
4335040	4336080	is stupid.
4339280	4340160	Okay, I can't even
4340160	4341200	make that joke here.
4341200	4341920	You see,
4341920	4342800	the overly negative
4342800	4343600	critical response
4343600	4344720	from Souls diehards
4344720	4346000	and some spheres of the internet
4346000	4346800	isn't even accurate
4346800	4348320	to what most game critics said
4348320	4349840	when the game first came out.
4349840	4350560	On the whole,
4350560	4351600	people loved it.
4351600	4353360	The misgivings came specifically
4353360	4355040	from folks like Matthew Matosis
4355040	4356480	and the popularity of his video
4356480	4357440	predicated centrally
4357440	4358720	on how the game couldn't possibly
4358720	4359600	be as good as the first
4359600	4360960	because Miyazaki didn't make it
4360960	4362560	and locking on in some fights
4362560	4363440	isn't a good idea
4363440	4364560	and the opening cutscene
4364560	4365520	didn't talk about a war
4365520	4366560	that already happened
4366560	4367680	and has no effect on us
4367680	4368720	as a player.
4368720	4369520	Ignore how,
4369520	4370640	in Dark Souls 2,
4370640	4371920	there's a similar ancient war
4371920	4372960	in the distant past,
4372960	4374240	but you get to learn about it
4374240	4375280	over the course of the game
4375280	4376800	instead of a pre-rendered cutscene
4376800	4377600	at the beginning,
4377600	4378880	and then you get to actually
4378880	4380080	go fight in it?!
4380080	4381440	Critics at the time of release
4381440	4382480	liked it a lot,
4382480	4383280	the exact same way
4383280	4384640	critics liked Demon's Souls
4384640	4385920	a lot back when this whole series
4385920	4386720	was new and strange
4386720	4387680	and not many people played
4387680	4388640	or liked it.
4388640	4390080	People who think about games a lot
4390080	4391280	are more likely to easily
4391280	4392560	get into a new experience
4392560	4393600	than people who just play them
4393600	4394320	as a hobby.
4394320	4395600	Internet critics like Yahtzee
4395600	4396320	wiped their ass
4396320	4397440	all over various aspects
4397440	4397840	of the games
4397840	4398640	that would later say
4398640	4399920	they loved when audiences
4399920	4401280	started to get a hang of the games
4401280	4401840	and it turned out
4401840	4403440	they were talking bollocks.
4403440	4404720	Fuck you, Demon's Souls.
4404720	4405840	A challenge is one thing,
4405840	4406720	but trying to break down
4406720	4407600	a fucking cement wall
4407600	4408240	with your forehead
4408240	4408800	isn't a challenge,
4408800	4409680	it's grounds for getting
4409680	4410800	fucking sectioned.
4410800	4411920	Demon's Souls is one of the most
4411920	4413280	rewarding, challenging games
4413280	4414720	ever to hit the PS3.
4414720	4415840	It may not be for everyone,
4416080	4417040	but I still urge everyone
4417040	4418240	to at least try it.
4418240	4420080	And GameSpot's 2009 game
4420080	4420720	of the year is...
4422160	4423680	Demon's Souls.
4423680	4425280	Demon's Souls is like
4425280	4426480	nothing you've ever played.
4427360	4428560	Do you hear that?
4428560	4429920	It was the best
4429920	4431120	and most innovative game
4431120	4432000	of 2009.
4432560	4435920	That's Kevin Van Flipping Ord.
4435920	4437440	That's the thought criminal
4437440	4438320	who was so wrong
4438320	4439360	about Fallout 3
4439360	4440240	he was found dead
4440240	4441680	in his cell last year
4441680	4442720	next to an apology
4442720	4444560	written in my blood.
4444560	4445680	Even he has been
4445680	4446640	on the ground floor
4446640	4447680	of the Souls series
4447680	4448880	since day one.
4448880	4449760	It turns out that
4449760	4450960	professional game critics
4450960	4451680	are quite often
4451680	4452800	more ahead of the curb
4452800	4454000	than the average consumer
4454000	4455760	or the not-to-be-rude
4455760	4456720	fanboy types
4456720	4458000	who will dismiss a sequel
4458000	4458960	for being too different
4458960	4459840	to the one they first
4459840	4460880	fell in love with.
4460880	4462160	Mainstream game critics
4462160	4463200	can be wrong,
4463200	4464640	but they've been consistently
4464640	4466000	right about the Souls series
4466000	4467360	from day one.
4467360	4468800	It's only corners of the internet
4468800	4470720	full of rose-tinted fanboyishness
4470720	4472080	towards the first Dark Souls
4472080	4473680	that result in the ridiculous
4473680	4475200	treatment of the second game.
4475200	4476400	When it comes down to it,
4476400	4477600	Dark Souls was
4477600	4478720	a fantastic game,
4478720	4479520	even though it's flawed
4479520	4480160	in a lot of ways
4480160	4481280	that are so much more obvious
4481280	4482240	now than ever.
4482240	4483600	I think the sheer surprise
4483600	4485040	of how good Dark Souls was
4485040	4485760	after most people
4485760	4487280	missed the boat on Demon's Souls
4487280	4488720	made it a hard act to follow
4488720	4489760	and lots of fans got
4489760	4491920	unrealistic expectations about it.
4491920	4493680	The online response to Dark Souls 3
4493680	4495040	sounds overall lukewarm
4495040	4495920	but positive,
4495920	4497200	and I think that might be because
4497200	4499360	at least in regards to this one series,
4499360	4500800	maybe not a couple others,
4500800	4501680	people have cooled
4501760	4502640	and learned to manage
4502640	4503920	their expectations.
4503920	4504960	I'm interested in finally
4504960	4505520	getting to play it
4505520	4506560	after working for so long
4506560	4507600	on videos about the games
4507600	4508400	that preceded it.
4508400	4509120	I'm a little worried
4509120	4510000	that the fan reaction
4510000	4510960	to some aspects of 2
4510960	4511920	made them walk back
4511920	4512720	on the good ideas
4512720	4513840	in an effort to be more like
4513840	4514640	the first one,
4514640	4515600	but I'm gonna play it
4515600	4516800	and judge it on its own merits
4516800	4517520	as its own game
4517520	4519120	before I really consider that.
4519120	4520400	In the meantime,
4520400	4522240	Dark Souls 2 is not perfect,
4522240	4522880	but you can have
4522880	4524240	a grand old time with it.
4524240	4525200	The gameplay contains
4525200	4526320	some of the tightest moments
4526320	4527520	in the whole series
4527520	4529120	and some really fun variations
4529120	4530080	on the formula.
4530080	4530880	It tells a story
4530880	4531920	that instead of redoing
4531920	4532560	the original
4532560	4533520	or trying to build on it
4533520	4534880	in a straightforward way,
4534880	4536160	self-consciously explores
4536160	4537280	what it means to exist
4537280	4538480	in a specific position
4538480	4539760	in gaming culture
4539760	4540560	and asks us
4540560	4541680	what the things we desire
4541680	4542480	from games
4542480	4543680	say about us.
4543680	4545520	I really enjoyed Dark Souls 2,
4545520	4546800	and I think there's a lot of things
4546800	4547680	that make it good,
4547680	4549120	and if you didn't enjoy it,
4549120	4550160	that's okay.
4550160	4551200	Your different opinions
4551200	4552000	and experiences
4552000	4553040	are equally as valid,
4553040	4554000	and I know I talk
4554000	4555360	authoritatively sometimes,
4555360	4556480	but I hope it's clear
4556480	4557600	I'm just offering my opinion
4557600	4558880	in a way I think is interesting
4558880	4560080	or convincing,
4560080	4562320	and it's okay to disagree with me.
4562320	4563120	For now.
4563120	4575120	[♪ Music ♪
4575520	4576720	Thanks so much for watching
4576720	4578000	this really long addendum
4578000	4579920	to a super long video.
4579920	4581120	Making this kind of criticism
4581120	4582400	takes a ridiculous amount
4582400	4583440	of time and effort,
4583440	4584320	and it always takes
4584320	4584960	so much longer
4584960	4586080	than I think it will,
4586080	4587360	so I really would like
4587360	4588240	to thank my patrons
4588240	4589440	for keeping me in spaghetti
