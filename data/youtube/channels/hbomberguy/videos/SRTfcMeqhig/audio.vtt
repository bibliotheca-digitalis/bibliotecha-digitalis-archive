WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
This video is an offshoot from the video I made about Bloodborne.

00:02.960 --> 00:07.200
I realized partway through recording it that attempts to defend and talk up Dark Souls 2

00:07.200 --> 00:09.280
were worming their way into the Bloodborne video,

00:09.280 --> 00:11.520
so instead of making the Bloodborne video even longer,

00:11.520 --> 00:14.880
I decided to cut those parts out and then put them in their own video.

00:14.880 --> 00:17.280
Then I realized this video made no sense

00:17.280 --> 00:20.160
because it was just a mishmash of stuff lifted from a different video

00:20.160 --> 00:21.680
pasted together without context,

00:21.680 --> 00:25.360
so I remade it all, which took bloody ages.

00:25.360 --> 00:27.440
This game is unfairly maligned.

00:27.440 --> 00:29.280
I think Dark Souls 1 was incredible,

00:29.280 --> 00:33.040
and people who really liked that one had kind of unrealistic expectations

00:33.040 --> 00:36.000
and got inevitably burned by the sequel being different

00:36.000 --> 00:40.240
or failing to be as spectacular and new as its predecessor when it came out.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.800
Judging it as a game, I think it's really good.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.400
It's not as good as Bloodborne,

00:44.400 --> 00:45.760
but it's a little bit...

00:45.760 --> 00:48.000
It's a little bit better than Dark Souls 1.

00:48.960 --> 00:52.480
Oh, I mean, in my opinion, it's a little bit better than Dark Souls 1.

00:53.680 --> 00:55.920
Okay, it's about as good as Dark Souls 1,

00:55.920 --> 00:57.440
but it has some differences I prefer.

00:58.240 --> 01:00.400
Okay, it's not as good as Dark Souls 1,

01:00.400 --> 01:03.200
but the changes were an interesting and useful risk

01:03.200 --> 01:05.760
that's more valuable existing than not existing

01:05.760 --> 01:08.160
and is genuinely better than just getting more of Dark Souls 1,

01:08.160 --> 01:10.960
which we already have and you can still just go back to and play if you want to.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.160
And I personally think I had more fun with it.

01:15.600 --> 01:19.680
I think the Emerald Herald is a better waifu than Guinevere.

01:19.680 --> 01:36.000
♪

01:36.000 --> 01:38.400
We might as well start with a discussion of the health system,

01:38.400 --> 01:41.200
which I feel is the core building block of the Souls games

01:41.200 --> 01:44.080
because it dictates the rhythm and structure of the gameplay

01:44.080 --> 01:48.240
and creates the weighty sense of challenge and difficulty the series is known for.

01:48.240 --> 01:51.600
Ironically, it's very easy to just make something hard.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.080
Making a game challenging while also being fun

01:54.080 --> 01:57.360
requires a very dense and carefully arranged interplay of mechanics.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.520
This is the tightrope games have to walk.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.440
How do you make a player feel challenged

02:01.440 --> 02:03.840
so that their success is a rewarding experience

02:03.840 --> 02:07.360
without making them feel overly punished or simply frustrated?

02:07.360 --> 02:09.600
This balance is difficult to execute.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.080
The reason Souls games are difficult in the first place

02:12.080 --> 02:14.480
is because of the way damage works in the games.

02:14.480 --> 02:15.680
If everything was the same,

02:15.680 --> 02:18.800
but all attacks did a half or a quarter the damage they do,

02:18.800 --> 02:20.640
the game would be fundamentally different,

02:20.640 --> 02:23.040
less challenging, and less fun as a result.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.680
Things wouldn't be as weighty because the damage wasn't as important

02:25.680 --> 02:28.160
and dodging wouldn't feel as necessary and so on.

02:28.160 --> 02:30.000
This is why a lot of first-person shooters

02:30.000 --> 02:32.960
have a difficulty mode they explicitly recommend over the others

02:32.960 --> 02:34.800
because games usually manipulate difficulty

02:34.800 --> 02:37.120
by making the damage sliders be higher or lower

02:37.120 --> 02:40.000
and in most games there's a specific amount of damage

02:40.000 --> 02:42.240
attacks are most enjoyable to be working with.

02:42.240 --> 02:44.000
Souls games have no difficulty setting

02:44.080 --> 02:46.720
because there's almost no way to make the game easier

02:46.720 --> 02:49.920
without fundamentally altering the thing that makes the games fun.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.280
In a Souls game, you generally can only take a couple of hits before dying.

02:53.280 --> 02:55.520
Healing, therefore, is an important mechanic.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.440
How do you let the player gain health back?

02:57.440 --> 02:59.280
This is an important mechanic to talk about

02:59.280 --> 03:02.880
because it defines the flow of the rest of the ensuing game experience.

03:02.880 --> 03:04.880
Let's say there was no healing whatsoever

03:04.880 --> 03:08.080
or you healed instantly without there even being an animation

03:08.080 --> 03:09.440
or, as in Bloodborne,

03:09.440 --> 03:12.720
you could heal back damage you took if you retaliated quickly.

03:12.720 --> 03:15.040
These utterly change the rest of the mechanics

03:15.040 --> 03:16.960
and therefore the rest of the game experience

03:16.960 --> 03:20.160
because they change how the player is led to interact with them.

03:20.160 --> 03:23.040
The guy who gets to decide how players get health back

03:23.040 --> 03:25.680
actually is responsible for more of the game

03:25.680 --> 03:28.320
than the people who design the levels in a weird way.

03:28.320 --> 03:30.240
Souls games have done this a variety of ways

03:30.240 --> 03:32.720
with a variety of impacts on core gameplay.

03:32.720 --> 03:37.040
In Demon's Souls, you healed by using different kinds of grass you found or purchased.

03:37.040 --> 03:40.240
Stopping to grab a bite, however, was very slow and deliberate

03:40.240 --> 03:42.080
and it stopped you dead in your tracks.

03:42.080 --> 03:45.200
While this is fine if you already beat the thing that damaged you,

03:45.200 --> 03:47.600
in a lot of direct combat situations,

03:47.600 --> 03:50.960
stopping to heal is either not going to work or is going to get you killed.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.880
It's a calculated risk every time

03:52.880 --> 03:55.600
and in boss fights, finding places in the rhythm of the battle

03:55.600 --> 03:57.200
when healing was a good idea

03:57.200 --> 04:01.120
was key to survival for people who couldn't always avoid taking that damage.

04:01.120 --> 04:03.520
There is something of a downside to this, however.

04:03.520 --> 04:07.600
Firstly, while it is very calculated and purposeful and challenging to heal,

04:08.240 --> 04:09.200
should it be?

04:09.200 --> 04:12.080
It's fair, but is it good to be in a situation

04:12.080 --> 04:14.800
where the most pressing thing, trying to heal,

04:14.800 --> 04:17.360
is a really bad idea that would itself kill you?

04:17.360 --> 04:20.720
A lot of early players die while mashing the heal button.

04:20.720 --> 04:21.680
That's not fun,

04:21.680 --> 04:25.200
even if simply not doing that is technically the sound response.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.400
Secondly, in Demon's Souls,

04:26.400 --> 04:29.520
you immediately have access to all the healing items you'll ever need.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.120
You can buy as many of them as you want

04:31.120 --> 04:34.000
as soon as the game properly starts and always go back for more

04:34.000 --> 04:36.080
and they're fairly easy to farm from enemies.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.800
This means that if they master the timing to heal in battle,

04:38.800 --> 04:40.400
they're practically unkillable

04:40.400 --> 04:43.440
and can't be worn down by attrition as they progress to a level.

04:43.440 --> 04:46.640
As long as no one encounter can fully drain your life bar,

04:46.640 --> 04:48.160
which can still happen a lot,

04:48.160 --> 04:50.320
Demon's Souls' difficulty is reduced quite a bit

04:50.320 --> 04:52.240
from where it was probably meant to be.

04:52.240 --> 04:54.800
You technically have access to an infama-

04:54.800 --> 04:55.520
Infama?

04:55.520 --> 04:58.480
Infinite amount of life as long as you use it properly.

04:58.480 --> 05:02.000
Dark Souls replaced this health system entirely with the Estus Flask,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.560
a healing item which you couldn't buy more of.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.160
You had a limited amount of uses

05:06.160 --> 05:08.880
which recharged at bonfires or when you died.

05:08.880 --> 05:11.600
Yes, I know you can also get health back by using a humanity,

05:11.600 --> 05:13.520
but doing that burns such a rare resource

05:13.520 --> 05:16.080
that I couldn't really regard it as a source of healing

05:16.080 --> 05:19.200
unless you're one of those good-at-Dark-Souls people I've heard so much about.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.560
This meant you had a finite amount of life at any given time.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.800
This also means attrition becomes a factor.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.280
Damage you take is health you aren't getting back

05:27.280 --> 05:29.360
until you reach a place that restores Estus.

05:29.360 --> 05:32.000
This can make the game more interesting and more risky.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.480
It also means that there's a net maximum amount of times

05:34.480 --> 05:37.440
you can possibly be hit by enemies or a boss in a single run.

05:37.440 --> 05:40.400
In this regard, Dark Souls is tremendously more difficult,

05:40.400 --> 05:43.920
but also more satisfying because of the new element of challenge it adds.

05:43.920 --> 05:46.880
However, you're still left basically prone while you do it,

05:46.880 --> 05:48.960
and it still takes just long enough that getting killed

05:48.960 --> 05:51.680
while trying to heal is an annoying and common possibility.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.280
And it means if you're on a run to a boss

05:53.280 --> 05:54.960
and you take a certain amount of damage,

05:54.960 --> 05:57.280
you feel like you're already doomed on this run

05:57.280 --> 05:58.800
because there's no way you can get past them

05:58.800 --> 06:00.400
with that little health remaining,

06:00.400 --> 06:02.880
so you have to go back or just go on a doomed run

06:02.880 --> 06:04.480
and die and come back again.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.560
And that can kind of wear down your ability

06:06.560 --> 06:09.280
to keep playing the game and enjoy it,

06:09.280 --> 06:11.040
which is a big deal in games.

06:11.040 --> 06:14.720
Dark Souls 2, in my opinion, fixes some of this pretty well.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.720
Firstly, it takes an age to drink again,

06:16.720 --> 06:19.120
making it even more deliberate than the Demon's Souls one,

06:19.120 --> 06:21.840
and your health actually recovers over a very short amount of time

06:21.840 --> 06:23.120
instead of instantaneously.

06:23.120 --> 06:25.600
This forces the player to not even consider healing

06:25.600 --> 06:26.800
until they're free and clear

06:26.800 --> 06:29.840
because there's no chance they'll just get the Estus to their lips

06:29.840 --> 06:31.600
before getting hit and stay alive.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.160
Ironically, by being even more slow and deliberate,

06:34.160 --> 06:36.880
it further disencourages the thing that causes annoyance

06:36.880 --> 06:39.440
when it doesn't work, dying while trying to heal.

06:39.440 --> 06:43.040
However, Dark Souls 2 also supplements this with life gems.

06:43.040 --> 06:44.960
Life gems are a little bit like the grass,

06:44.960 --> 06:47.680
down to being purchasable and coming in numerous sizes.

06:47.680 --> 06:51.760
They take a while to use, and they heal over time very slowly.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.520
This is genius.

06:53.520 --> 06:57.520
You see, attrition isn't necessarily a fun kind of challenge.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.120
It can create a nice feeling

06:59.120 --> 07:02.320
and a risk that you'll be worn down too far to make it anywhere,

07:02.320 --> 07:03.760
but you know what isn't fun?

07:03.760 --> 07:05.360
Knowing you're definitely fucked

07:05.360 --> 07:07.680
because you'll most likely lose the remaining health you have

07:07.680 --> 07:09.040
before you get anywhere new.

07:09.040 --> 07:11.600
Knowing you're at the limit your healing can possibly take you

07:11.600 --> 07:13.680
with your abilities and you're just not good enough

07:13.680 --> 07:16.080
and you're gonna have to keep playing this area over and over

07:16.080 --> 07:18.160
or go farming and level up or something.

07:18.160 --> 07:20.640
By bringing back theoretically infinite health

07:20.640 --> 07:22.640
but making it heal very slowly,

07:22.640 --> 07:25.200
the creators have introduced a way to get around this annoyance

07:25.200 --> 07:27.440
without making the player feel totally invincible.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.280
They also have tactical uses.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.440
Since they take a while to use and are slow,

07:31.440 --> 07:33.040
they're risky to use in fights,

07:33.040 --> 07:35.360
but if you're good at not immediately dying,

07:35.360 --> 07:36.640
they still heal you,

07:36.640 --> 07:39.680
so you can run out of Estus and still have access to a source of healing

07:39.680 --> 07:41.760
that requires some skill to use effectively,

07:41.760 --> 07:43.200
which is kind of cool and smart.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.680
They're also useful for if you expect to take damage

07:45.680 --> 07:48.480
but don't think you'll be able to stop and heal later.

07:48.480 --> 07:51.280
In some boss fights, using a gem when you get the chance

07:51.280 --> 07:53.760
and then attacking means you'll get some health back

07:53.760 --> 07:55.440
even if you get hit a bit later.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.200
This is frankly a welcome addition.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.680
I've heard the criticism that the addition of life gems

07:59.680 --> 08:02.560
utterly destroys the delicate balance of the entire game

08:02.560 --> 08:05.280
and it's erased the majesty of the Estus flask

08:05.280 --> 08:08.800
and its purposeful limitation of a player's maximum amount of mistakes.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.440
This, in a sense, is an accurate analysis.

08:11.440 --> 08:13.520
The balance is shifted.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.600
However, it's shifted in favor of the player

08:15.600 --> 08:18.640
in a way that's overall positive for the experience.

08:18.640 --> 08:21.280
Bloodborne probably does the best with its use of healing.

08:21.280 --> 08:24.640
Blood vials are simultaneously infinite and finite.

08:24.640 --> 08:26.320
You can buy a bunch quite easily

08:26.320 --> 08:28.640
but only have 20 on hand at any time.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.960
The more you find in a level are immediately usable

08:30.960 --> 08:32.640
if you had less than 20 on you,

08:32.640 --> 08:35.360
so you can use more than 20 if you use one in a fight

08:35.360 --> 08:37.120
and then one drops from a corpse later,

08:37.120 --> 08:38.320
which happens fairly often.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.600
The healing is also quicker

08:39.600 --> 08:42.400
and you have a lot of control over movement while you do it.

08:42.400 --> 08:43.360
This is good.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.440
I just talked about how good it was being made tactical

08:45.440 --> 08:46.640
the way it was in 2,

08:46.640 --> 08:48.400
but ultimately, as a mechanic,

08:48.400 --> 08:50.720
I think it's more enjoyable to be able to heal quickly

08:50.720 --> 08:52.400
because dying while healing

08:52.400 --> 08:54.240
or dying because you were unable to heal

08:54.240 --> 08:56.000
because tactically it would have killed you

08:56.000 --> 08:57.600
is just never fun or interesting.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.840
If I was to grade all four games' healing methods,

08:59.840 --> 09:02.240
I would put Dark Souls last here

09:02.240 --> 09:04.480
because I don't personally think its method of attrition

09:04.480 --> 09:06.880
is all that fun when it comes down to it

09:06.880 --> 09:08.960
and the precise amount of time it takes to heal

09:08.960 --> 09:10.560
and the way it immobilizes you

09:10.560 --> 09:12.720
makes it always a tantalizing risk

09:12.720 --> 09:14.800
you think you might just be able to make,

09:14.800 --> 09:16.240
which means more players die

09:16.240 --> 09:18.320
trying to heal in this game than any other.

09:18.320 --> 09:21.680
I think Dark Souls 2 is the second best behind Bloodborne

09:21.680 --> 09:23.840
and, hey, that's pretty good.

09:24.000 --> 09:30.880
♪♪

09:30.880 --> 09:33.520
One criticism I see made a lot about Dark Souls 2

09:33.520 --> 09:35.760
is that a lot of the bosses and also a lot of enemies

09:35.760 --> 09:38.000
are what amounts to humanoid people in armor.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.920
This isn't just an aesthetic complaint.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.120
It's also a problem in the sense

09:41.120 --> 09:42.560
that a lot of the fights with enemies

09:42.560 --> 09:44.640
amount to learning how they swing a weapon,

09:44.640 --> 09:45.920
how to get past their weapon,

09:45.920 --> 09:47.440
and which direction their swings go.

09:47.440 --> 09:49.200
And since there's a finite amount of ways

09:49.200 --> 09:50.640
a humanoid can swing a sword,

09:50.640 --> 09:52.560
it's possible to even start confusing enemies

09:52.640 --> 09:53.920
and their attacks for each other.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.600
A lot of bosses are very similar,

09:55.600 --> 09:56.640
unlike the previous game,

09:56.640 --> 09:58.720
which has more of a variety of unique bosses

09:58.720 --> 10:00.720
like the gaping dragon or Nito

10:00.720 --> 10:03.040
or Seath the Scaleless breaking up the monotony.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.360
And indeed, there are quite a lot of humanoid opponents

10:05.360 --> 10:07.840
who fight with swords in what amounts to a duel.

10:07.840 --> 10:08.800
But here's the thing.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.400
I'm gonna make a different argument here.

10:10.400 --> 10:11.680
I'm not gonna argue that the bosses

10:11.680 --> 10:12.960
are all sufficiently different,

10:12.960 --> 10:14.400
which, in my opinion, they are,

10:14.400 --> 10:16.640
or that there are plenty of different kinds of boss fight

10:16.640 --> 10:17.840
breaking up the monotony,

10:17.840 --> 10:19.040
which there is,

10:19.040 --> 10:21.520
but instead I'm going to play the wild card

10:21.520 --> 10:25.280
and be the needless contrarian that people say I am.

10:25.280 --> 10:28.160
I'm gonna argue in favor of dudes in armor.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.320
I think the best kinds of fight in games

10:30.320 --> 10:32.240
are against enemies on roughly equal footing

10:32.240 --> 10:33.040
with the player.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.960
All games, not just Souls games.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.720
There's something viscerally satisfying

10:36.720 --> 10:37.920
about facing off with someone

10:37.920 --> 10:40.080
making use of the same skill set as you.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.760
The best boss fights in Devil May Cry

10:41.760 --> 10:43.600
are the fights against Vergil or Dante

10:43.600 --> 10:45.280
or another human-sized opponent

10:45.280 --> 10:46.800
with another ridiculous sword.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.240
The best boss fight in God Hand

10:48.240 --> 10:49.760
and also gaming history

10:49.760 --> 10:52.880
is against Azel, who has the Devil Hand, and so on.

10:52.880 --> 10:55.040
It's far more compelling to fight a person

10:55.040 --> 10:57.600
making use of skills you yourself could be using

10:57.600 --> 10:59.440
than someone with far more powers than you

10:59.440 --> 11:01.600
or who is an incomprehensible mess.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.840
It feels good, to put it simply.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.160
Dark Souls had a couple of regular enemies in the game

11:06.160 --> 11:07.440
who scratched this itch for me,

11:07.440 --> 11:10.000
like, uh, the NPC invasions,

11:10.000 --> 11:11.200
like Manny to Mildred,

11:11.200 --> 11:12.320
uh, Lautrec,

11:12.320 --> 11:14.160
the crestfallen guy when he goes hollow,

11:14.160 --> 11:16.160
or Oscar when you return to the asylum,

11:16.160 --> 11:17.040
or Rickard.

11:17.040 --> 11:18.560
These kinds of fight are the best

11:18.560 --> 11:19.920
and most memorable.

11:19.920 --> 11:21.440
In fact, I just remember those offhand.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.640
I didn't even put those in the script.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.680
I just decided to list them

11:23.680 --> 11:24.880
because I just know them all.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.560
PvP is so fun in these games

11:26.560 --> 11:28.080
for this exact reason.

11:28.080 --> 11:30.320
You're fighting people on the same footing as you

11:30.320 --> 11:31.920
with access to the same resources.

11:31.920 --> 11:32.640
It's just great.

11:32.640 --> 11:33.760
It's- it's a puzzle

11:33.760 --> 11:35.120
where you all pick your poison

11:35.120 --> 11:38.560
and then you fight to see who is poisoned the most.

11:38.560 --> 11:39.120
Um...

11:39.120 --> 11:40.800
But in Dark Souls, the only boss fight

11:40.800 --> 11:43.760
that comes really close to getting this right

11:43.760 --> 11:45.760
is Artorias in the DLC.

11:45.760 --> 11:46.720
Ornstein and S-

11:46.720 --> 11:47.520
mmm...

11:47.520 --> 11:48.400
kind of did it,

11:48.400 --> 11:50.960
but you were too busy dealing with the other guy,

11:50.960 --> 11:51.520
uh,

11:51.520 --> 11:52.960
so you could never really focus

11:52.960 --> 11:53.920
on the aspect of the fight

11:53.920 --> 11:56.320
that's like this straightforward, cool duel, you know?

11:56.320 --> 11:57.360
And then they get really big

11:57.360 --> 11:58.960
and then it becomes a very different kind of thing.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.360
Artorias is a really, really good fight.

12:01.360 --> 12:03.280
He's not exactly on equal footing with you.

12:03.280 --> 12:05.280
He's presented as a very strong person,

12:05.280 --> 12:06.720
larger than life, literally,

12:06.720 --> 12:07.920
corrupted by evil,

12:07.920 --> 12:09.280
but he's a brilliant fight

12:09.280 --> 12:11.280
because he never comes off as ridiculous.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.520
He even dodges and rolls the way a person would.

12:13.520 --> 12:15.520
You get this fantastic mix of outsmarting

12:15.520 --> 12:16.720
a fellow consciousness

12:16.720 --> 12:18.320
trying to beat you in a straight fight,

12:18.480 --> 12:19.600
Before Dark Souls 2,

12:19.600 --> 12:21.360
I would describe Knight Artorias

12:21.360 --> 12:23.280
as the platonic ideal

12:23.280 --> 12:24.880
of a Dark Souls boss fight.

12:24.880 --> 12:27.760
It's the most pared-down, purified form

12:27.760 --> 12:29.760
of single combat

12:29.760 --> 12:32.080
with another swordsman in the Souls games,

12:32.080 --> 12:33.520
and that's really, to me,

12:34.080 --> 12:35.600
the best thing.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.160
Dark Souls 2 has a lot more of this kind of fight

12:38.160 --> 12:39.360
than the previous two games

12:39.360 --> 12:40.720
and more than Bloodborne also,

12:40.720 --> 12:42.640
and this, I must stress for me,

12:42.640 --> 12:43.840
this is my opinion,

12:43.840 --> 12:44.800
is a gift.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.320
The pursuer, the lost sinner,

12:46.320 --> 12:47.760
the looking-glass knight,

12:47.760 --> 12:48.560
Velstadt,

12:48.560 --> 12:50.160
and in the DLCs, the Fume Knight

12:50.160 --> 12:52.400
and Sir Valon and the Burnt Ivory King.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.680
In my opinion,

12:53.680 --> 12:56.320
these fights are what the Souls games' mechanics

12:56.320 --> 12:58.000
are vessels for.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.240
This is what the game should be built around.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.080
There's even the old Dragon Slayer,

13:02.080 --> 13:04.160
a version of the Ornstein and Smurfs fight

13:04.160 --> 13:05.840
that indulges in this aspect

13:05.840 --> 13:08.240
more than fighting two people at once could do.

13:08.240 --> 13:09.440
I remember telling my friends

13:09.440 --> 13:11.600
that I'd wished there'd been a one-on-one fight

13:11.600 --> 13:12.960
with a character like Ornstein,

13:12.960 --> 13:14.880
perhaps as a mini-boss later on,

13:14.880 --> 13:16.960
and those friends played the PS3 version of 2

13:16.960 --> 13:18.800
while I waited for it to come out on PC.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.480
The first thing they did when it came out

13:20.480 --> 13:23.360
was tell me where to go for a cool surprise over Skype,

13:23.360 --> 13:26.320
and I got the fight I'd wanted from the previous game.

13:26.320 --> 13:27.520
I'm sure people complained

13:27.520 --> 13:30.640
that this was a needless rehash or fan pandering,

13:30.640 --> 13:31.840
but it was literally a fight

13:31.840 --> 13:33.920
I specifically thought would have been fun

13:33.920 --> 13:35.520
and missed not having,

13:35.520 --> 13:38.240
and I'm glad someone working on Dark Souls 2

13:38.240 --> 13:39.120
agreed with me.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.800
Honestly, when I saw early critics saying,

13:40.800 --> 13:41.920
Dark Souls 2 is pretty great,

13:41.920 --> 13:43.840
but you fight a lot of dudes in armor,

13:43.840 --> 13:45.840
I remember immediately thinking,

13:45.840 --> 13:46.800
hell, yes.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.000
There are other kinds of fight,

13:48.000 --> 13:49.120
and it's good to have them,

13:49.120 --> 13:50.320
but they are the best.

13:50.320 --> 13:52.160
Perhaps one of the worst things

13:52.160 --> 13:54.160
about Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1

13:54.160 --> 13:56.640
is they didn't properly master this idea yet.

13:56.640 --> 13:58.800
Demon's Souls had the penetrator, don't laugh,

13:58.800 --> 14:01.440
and some decent NPC fights like Garl Vinland,

14:01.440 --> 14:03.920
the actual final boss of the Valley of Defilement.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.600
I mentioned the ones Dark Souls had,

14:05.600 --> 14:08.720
but 2 elevated these fights to their proper place

14:08.720 --> 14:11.120
as the core kind of fight you did the most,

14:11.120 --> 14:12.320
and I love it for that.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.560
The Heide Knights are criminally underrated.

14:14.560 --> 14:16.640
They deliberately look and fight very differently

14:16.640 --> 14:18.480
from the Black Knights of Dark Souls 1,

14:18.480 --> 14:19.520
and if you let them get up,

14:19.520 --> 14:20.240
which you should do,

14:20.240 --> 14:21.600
because why else are you attacking them?

14:21.600 --> 14:23.200
They sit down and do nothing on purpose

14:23.200 --> 14:24.560
until you want to fight them.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.240
The fight is usually pretty cool.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.360
They kill me a lot,

14:27.360 --> 14:29.920
so I can't show me beating them here really easily,

14:29.920 --> 14:31.920
which would have been nice footage to have,

14:31.920 --> 14:32.880
but, um...

14:32.880 --> 14:34.080
The narrative critics create

14:34.080 --> 14:35.360
when they talk about dudes in armor

14:35.360 --> 14:37.520
is that the developers ran out of ideas,

14:37.520 --> 14:40.000
but with just a slight change in perspective,

14:40.000 --> 14:41.520
it becomes clear that the developers

14:41.520 --> 14:43.120
had a really good new idea,

14:43.120 --> 14:45.040
which was to use more of a kind of fight

14:45.040 --> 14:47.920
that was vastly underutilized in previous games

14:47.920 --> 14:49.360
and worked really well.

14:49.360 --> 14:50.880
Does that really count as a new idea?

14:51.520 --> 14:52.800
Yeah, sure.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.400
Well, I'm gonna claim it is, at least,

14:54.400 --> 14:55.760
and you can't stop me.

14:55.760 --> 14:58.080
It's a fundamental change in the makeup of the game,

14:58.080 --> 14:59.760
and in my opinion, it's for the better.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.840
That's not to say that's the only kind of boss fight, though.

15:01.840 --> 15:02.560
Like in Dark Souls,

15:02.560 --> 15:04.160
there are plenty of different kinds of fight

15:04.160 --> 15:05.120
breaking up the monotony

15:05.120 --> 15:07.840
against bigger bosses like the Last Giant.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.520
Uh, there's unique, one-of-a-kind fights

15:09.520 --> 15:12.000
like the one with Scorpioness Nagica

15:12.000 --> 15:13.600
who visually resembles Quelaag

15:13.600 --> 15:15.440
but is a very different kind of fight,

15:15.440 --> 15:16.080
but there's all kinds.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.120
There's the Royal Rat Vanguard,

15:17.120 --> 15:18.000
there's the Congregation,

15:18.000 --> 15:19.280
there's the Covetous Demon,

15:19.280 --> 15:22.160
there's, uh, Mr. Chariot,

15:22.160 --> 15:23.440
and there's the Dark Lurker

15:23.440 --> 15:26.160
if you couldn't be bothered to go do all the stuff

15:26.160 --> 15:27.840
that you need to do to fight him,

15:27.840 --> 15:28.640
which I couldn't,

15:28.640 --> 15:30.080
so I didn't get any footage of it.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.200
I've also heard the criticism

15:31.200 --> 15:32.320
that there are too many bosses

15:32.320 --> 15:34.080
that consist of fights with large groups,

15:34.080 --> 15:36.000
and this is proof of the game's poor design.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.640
Similar problems extend to other boss fights,

15:38.640 --> 15:40.160
which seem to follow the mantra,

15:40.160 --> 15:41.600
if you can't make it good,

15:41.600 --> 15:43.680
make it difficult by adding more stuff.

15:43.680 --> 15:45.760
This is Matthew Matosis.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.680
His Dark Souls 2 critique video came out

15:47.680 --> 15:49.520
just over a month after the release of the game

15:49.520 --> 15:51.120
in April 2014.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.880
It blew up somewhat on the internet,

15:52.880 --> 15:54.240
to the point that a lot of the times

15:54.240 --> 15:55.920
I see someone in person or online

15:55.920 --> 15:57.360
talking about Dark Souls 2,

15:57.360 --> 15:58.640
they're often using criticisms

15:58.640 --> 16:00.000
that can be heard in this video,

16:00.000 --> 16:01.280
and many who don't like the game

16:01.280 --> 16:03.760
will cite it as a source for their explanation of why.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.760
In fact, when asking viewers for criticisms

16:05.760 --> 16:07.600
that they would want to see me respond to,

16:07.600 --> 16:09.200
the bulk of them linked this video,

16:09.200 --> 16:10.640
and most of the people that didn't

16:10.640 --> 16:12.080
did so because they knew for certain

16:12.080 --> 16:13.840
I would have already seen this one by now.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.200
We're dealing with a piece of criticism

16:15.200 --> 16:16.560
that had, in its own way,

16:16.560 --> 16:17.920
quite a fundamental impact

16:17.920 --> 16:19.440
on discourse surrounding the game.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.440
The arguments got copied, repeated, referenced,

16:21.440 --> 16:22.400
and in many ways, I think,

16:22.400 --> 16:24.000
the prevailing dismissive attitudes

16:24.000 --> 16:25.440
towards the game's quality

16:25.440 --> 16:27.920
started to crystallize as a result of this video.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.920
That's not to say the video is literally to blame

16:29.920 --> 16:31.840
for negativity towards Dark Souls 2,

16:31.840 --> 16:33.360
but regardless, it is necessary

16:33.360 --> 16:36.480
that this critique be defeated and destroyed at all costs.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.920
The mechanics of the Souls games

16:37.920 --> 16:39.840
are built for one-on-one engagements

16:39.840 --> 16:41.600
thanks to its slow attack animations

16:41.600 --> 16:43.760
which are uninterruptible once they start,

16:43.760 --> 16:44.800
and a lock-on camera

16:44.800 --> 16:47.120
which focuses heavily on a single foe.

16:47.120 --> 16:49.280
This early criticism is an interesting one.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.200
The claim is that adding more enemies into the game

16:51.200 --> 16:52.560
and also into some boss fights

16:52.560 --> 16:54.960
is a lazy attempt to increase difficulty,

16:54.960 --> 16:55.840
and that this is bad

16:55.840 --> 16:57.680
because Souls games are specifically designed

16:57.680 --> 17:00.080
to work best against single-enemy encounters.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.240
Matthew Matosis is entitled to his opinion,

17:02.240 --> 17:03.520
and I respect that,

17:03.520 --> 17:05.200
but here's why this is a lie.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.800
There are absolutely ways of dealing

17:06.800 --> 17:08.320
with larger numbers of crowds.

17:08.320 --> 17:10.080
It just requires different behavior

17:10.080 --> 17:11.440
than how you normally deal with enemies

17:11.440 --> 17:12.880
when there's just one or two.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.960
Crowd control is a different skill

17:14.960 --> 17:16.880
than the one that you're normally required to test,

17:16.880 --> 17:18.560
but it's one that's worth testing

17:18.560 --> 17:20.400
and really isn't in previous games.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.400
I remember God Hand being criticized

17:22.400 --> 17:23.920
for having too many enemies for an engine

17:23.920 --> 17:26.080
that was claimed to only really work best

17:26.080 --> 17:27.360
in one-on-one fights,

17:27.360 --> 17:28.880
but you can look up people playing it

17:28.880 --> 17:30.960
and see there's plenty of crowd control,

17:30.960 --> 17:33.280
but not if you always play the way you do

17:33.280 --> 17:35.040
against just one opponent at a time.

17:35.360 --> 17:37.600
Take the prowling Magus fight, for example.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.520
If you want to kill one of the crawling undead

17:39.520 --> 17:40.560
littering this fight,

17:40.560 --> 17:42.320
your eyes need to be taken off the casters

17:42.320 --> 17:44.080
at the back in order to lock on.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.600
Ah, you see, here's your problem.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.760
Matthew makes the supposedly obvious criticism

17:47.760 --> 17:49.840
that locking on makes it hard to see your enemy

17:49.840 --> 17:51.280
so the fight isn't well-designed,

17:51.280 --> 17:53.520
or fights against groups are inherently bad

17:53.520 --> 17:55.280
in this type of game or something,

17:55.280 --> 17:57.280
but why would you lock on?

17:57.280 --> 18:00.000
You see, the Dark Souls series has this amazing feature

18:00.000 --> 18:01.920
where, using the right stick,

18:01.920 --> 18:03.680
you can rotate the camera

18:03.680 --> 18:05.920
to show anything you want on the screen.

18:05.920 --> 18:08.000
You can manually control the camera yourself.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.200
When you think about it,

18:09.200 --> 18:11.360
his argument actually is that the lock-on system

18:11.360 --> 18:13.360
works best against single enemies,

18:13.360 --> 18:15.120
and he's right about that,

18:15.120 --> 18:16.960
but that's why you don't lock on

18:16.960 --> 18:18.720
in a fight against multiple enemies.

18:18.720 --> 18:20.240
Arguably, the main lesson you're taught

18:20.240 --> 18:21.920
as early on as the first real areas

18:21.920 --> 18:23.840
is that enemies are attacking from all over the place

18:23.840 --> 18:25.280
and you ought to keep your wits about you

18:25.280 --> 18:26.480
more than just pressing the button

18:26.480 --> 18:28.960
that focuses on one person and hoping for the best.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.640
This is a game that prides itself

18:30.640 --> 18:32.320
on expecting you to look where you're going,

18:32.320 --> 18:33.920
even as far back as the first game

18:33.920 --> 18:35.440
with the guy hiding behind the doorway

18:35.440 --> 18:37.040
and people hiding in corners

18:37.040 --> 18:38.720
even all the way over in Bloodborne.

18:38.720 --> 18:41.520
The lock-on system is a tool to be utilized carefully,

18:41.520 --> 18:43.520
just like every other ability and mechanic.

18:43.520 --> 18:46.320
Matt found the lock-on function was bad in this scenario

18:46.320 --> 18:48.720
and concluded that it was a flaw with the game.

18:48.720 --> 18:50.720
The challenge in this boss fight, like with the rats,

18:50.720 --> 18:53.600
is to avoid getting swarmed and put into a bad situation

18:53.600 --> 18:55.760
to keep track of yourself and navigate carefully.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.760
If you locked directly onto one of the enemies,

18:57.760 --> 18:58.720
you would have a problem,

18:58.720 --> 19:01.280
and that means you don't do that.

19:01.360 --> 19:03.040
Dark Souls II uses fights like this

19:03.040 --> 19:04.800
and a generally different sort of level design

19:04.800 --> 19:06.240
to teach you that in this world,

19:06.240 --> 19:09.440
sometimes focusing down on a specific individual is a mistake.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.280
Matthew didn't like Dark Souls II as much

19:11.280 --> 19:12.560
because he didn't learn this lesson

19:12.560 --> 19:14.160
and kept trying to play it the exact way

19:14.160 --> 19:15.360
he played the previous two.

19:15.360 --> 19:18.400
He also invokes the time you fight against the two Dragon Riders,

19:18.400 --> 19:20.480
and there's a cute little clip I want to show

19:20.480 --> 19:22.000
where he locks onto one

19:22.000 --> 19:23.920
and then has to angle himself precisely

19:23.920 --> 19:25.120
so he can see the two of them.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.680
The twin Dragon Riders are another example of this.

19:27.680 --> 19:29.520
You want to avoid attacks from both of them

19:29.520 --> 19:31.360
while periodically damaging one of them,

19:31.360 --> 19:33.680
but in order to do so, you need to lock onto one

19:33.680 --> 19:35.120
and position yourself in such a way

19:35.120 --> 19:36.400
so you can see the other.

19:36.400 --> 19:39.120
This clip is meant to show how bad the lock-on system is

19:39.120 --> 19:40.320
in two-person fights

19:40.320 --> 19:42.320
and therefore how poorly designed this fight is

19:42.320 --> 19:44.000
for putting this guy all the way over there,

19:44.000 --> 19:45.200
but the thing is,

19:45.200 --> 19:47.440
you could just not hit the lock-on button.

19:47.440 --> 19:48.800
You could just not do that.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.640
You can aim the camera wherever you want.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.400
You can still dodge and attack.

19:53.040 --> 19:53.540
You know...

19:53.540 --> 19:54.960
["clicking"]

19:54.960 --> 19:57.040
I looked back over the footage of me doing this fight

19:57.040 --> 19:58.240
and I didn't lock on at all

19:58.240 --> 19:59.280
until one of them was dead

19:59.280 --> 20:02.080
and it became a good idea to completely focus on one enemy.

20:02.080 --> 20:03.440
This naturally occurred to me

20:03.440 --> 20:05.920
because this is how Dark Souls 2 teaches you to play.

20:05.920 --> 20:07.440
I honestly think the mechanics

20:07.440 --> 20:09.920
and the way they're utilized in the first two games

20:09.920 --> 20:12.640
has gotten so ingrained in people who liked those two

20:12.640 --> 20:14.160
that it makes them play weirdly

20:14.160 --> 20:15.680
in games that work slightly differently

20:15.680 --> 20:17.280
or have different kinds of challenge

20:17.280 --> 20:19.120
and this strikes them as a flaw.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.800
I got some criticism on my last video

20:20.800 --> 20:23.440
that it's wrong to say it's possible to play a game wrong

20:23.440 --> 20:25.360
and there's a lot of ways of playing Dark Souls

20:25.360 --> 20:26.640
and they're all equally valid

20:26.640 --> 20:28.480
if that's how the player wants to do it

20:28.480 --> 20:30.000
and, yeah, kinda,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.400
but all I can say is I can definitely see

20:32.400 --> 20:34.640
why Matthew Matosis and other critics

20:34.640 --> 20:36.480
had a less good time with Dark Souls 2

20:36.480 --> 20:38.080
if this is how they approached it.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.800
This looks a whole lot like playing the game wrong

20:40.800 --> 20:42.320
and blaming the game for it.

20:42.320 --> 20:44.080
I still do really bad in this fight, though.

20:44.080 --> 20:44.720
Notice yourself.

20:44.720 --> 20:47.520
Just cut away from this quicker in the final edit.

20:47.520 --> 20:49.840
Also, we need to edit out the part where I say this, please.

20:49.840 --> 20:52.400
Matthew is still trying to use the lock-on mechanic in fights

20:52.400 --> 20:54.800
even as late as the Watcher and Defender bosses

20:54.800 --> 20:56.320
and he's still using a shield.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.440
Aw, bless.

20:57.440 --> 20:59.360
Someone really liked the previous games

20:59.360 --> 21:02.240
and tried real hard not to unlearn what they learned there.

21:02.240 --> 21:04.880
This kind of criticism sheds light on the critical perspective

21:04.880 --> 21:06.800
that approached the game in the first place.

21:06.800 --> 21:10.400
Players who went into the game expecting it to be exactly like the previous ones

21:10.400 --> 21:12.480
inevitably did badly in these sections

21:12.480 --> 21:14.800
and seemingly blamed the game for it.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.280
Joseph Anderson, a critic who put out three videos

21:17.280 --> 21:19.040
about Dark Souls in late 2015

21:19.040 --> 21:21.360
and was much less negative about the game,

21:21.360 --> 21:23.120
similarly doesn't use the lock-on feature

21:23.200 --> 21:25.120
in many of the fights he shows in his video

21:25.120 --> 21:28.080
and, like me, he fought most of them without using a shield either.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.840
In the same manner that shields are fine,

21:29.840 --> 21:31.520
but not if they engender passivity,

21:31.520 --> 21:33.200
the lock-on system is a great mechanic

21:33.200 --> 21:35.920
that can accidentally engender a reliance upon it.

21:35.920 --> 21:39.840
Also, Monster Hunter, a series many regard as very similar in a lot of ways,

21:39.840 --> 21:42.640
has basically no lock-on functionality whatsoever

21:42.640 --> 21:45.600
and the subhuman criminals who love Monster Hunter

21:45.600 --> 21:48.560
seem to do just fine using it to see the enemies however they want.

21:48.560 --> 21:51.280
That's not to say Monster Hunter wouldn't benefit from having one,

21:51.280 --> 21:52.480
but if it did have one,

21:52.480 --> 21:54.480
it would probably be something to use sparingly,

21:54.480 --> 21:56.000
much like in Dark Souls 2.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Also, it's worth remembering that this type of boss

21:58.000 --> 22:00.240
has been present in Souls games for a long time.

22:00.240 --> 22:02.080
You might remember, I don't know, the Phalanx,

22:02.080 --> 22:04.800
uh, the first real boss in Demon's Souls.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.600
It's a fight about balancing the interplay between the actual opponent

22:07.600 --> 22:10.240
and the numerous creatures that break off from it and act independently,

22:10.240 --> 22:12.480
threatening to surround and overwhelm you.

22:12.480 --> 22:15.120
Then, right after, there's the Tower Knight boss fight.

22:15.120 --> 22:17.920
Jeez, the first two bosses in the first game in the series

22:17.920 --> 22:20.400
and both of the muse mechanics Matthew Matosis concluded

22:20.400 --> 22:23.680
are inherently antithetical to the core of the Souls games.

22:23.680 --> 22:26.640
What, did the developers not realize how their game worked?

22:26.640 --> 22:30.080
If I look onto the Archer, I can't see the Tower Knight unless I stand here.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.800
I can't use the function designed for focusing on one person

22:32.800 --> 22:33.920
and see everyone else.

22:34.480 --> 22:36.960
What, did the B-team design this game?

22:36.960 --> 22:38.560
Ahahahahahahaha

22:38.560 --> 22:39.520
[(static)]

22:39.520 --> 22:42.240
Attacks also lock on to an unnecessary degree.

22:42.240 --> 22:44.240
When a boss goes to do an overhead attack,

22:44.240 --> 22:48.000
it will usually track the player up until the very last moment before impact.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.840
When Matthew Matosis makes this comment,

22:49.840 --> 22:52.400
in order to make an example of a superior fight,

22:52.400 --> 22:54.880
he cuts to footage of the Adjudicator,

22:54.880 --> 22:58.880
the...least memorable fight in the entire Souls series?

22:59.440 --> 23:04.400
I forget the Adjudicator exists every time I play Demon's Souls without fail,

23:04.400 --> 23:05.200
and then I go,

23:05.200 --> 23:06.240
oh yeah, this guy,

23:06.240 --> 23:08.720
and I kill him on the first try and forget about him again.

23:08.720 --> 23:12.480
His attacks go for where you used to be 10 minutes ago.

23:12.480 --> 23:16.560
No aspect of this boss should be the model for how fights should work in Souls games.

23:16.560 --> 23:19.680
The simple fact is that in previous entries in the series,

23:19.680 --> 23:23.360
circle strafing enemies has been an easy way to cheese a lot of the game.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.440
Because the enemies focus in on you more,

23:25.440 --> 23:26.240
guess what?

23:26.240 --> 23:28.880
You actually have to dodge some of their attacks now,

23:28.880 --> 23:33.200
using timing and knowledge of the right direction to move

23:33.200 --> 23:35.520
based on judging how the enemy's moving.

23:35.520 --> 23:38.800
A lot of the fights Mr. Matosis, if that is his real name,

23:38.800 --> 23:42.000
uses to make examples of this apparent horrific problem

23:42.000 --> 23:44.400
actually show him mistiming a dodge,

23:44.400 --> 23:47.360
or dodging in the direction of the swing.

23:47.360 --> 23:51.760
I don't think this demonstrates what he thinks it's demonstrating.

23:51.760 --> 23:55.600
Bosses all over the series lock right onto you as their attack goes off.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.200
This happens because on some level,

23:57.200 --> 23:59.600
the game is about learning how and when to dodge

23:59.600 --> 24:03.120
instead of just spinning a circle around someone so they can never hit you.

24:03.120 --> 24:05.200
The amount of lock-on enemies have in this game

24:05.200 --> 24:08.640
is only a problem if you don't know how to dodge attacks.

24:08.640 --> 24:11.280
I honestly think this footage speaks for itself.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.200
Here we're getting into the bedrock of some fundamental differences

24:15.200 --> 24:16.720
in the way Dark Souls 2 is made,

24:16.720 --> 24:19.520
and what it achieves versus the previous game's decisions,

24:19.520 --> 24:22.480
both in terms of gameplay and in terms of storytelling.

24:22.480 --> 24:26.560
Dark Souls is commonly lauded for being one large interconnected world.

24:26.560 --> 24:29.200
I criticized this perception a little in the Bloodborne video,

24:29.200 --> 24:31.680
and because I'm a hack, I'm gonna rehash that here.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.600
Dark Souls' interconnectedness is fun

24:33.600 --> 24:36.000
and creates an interesting sense of being in a real place,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
and it's cool you can find yourself in a real world

24:38.000 --> 24:40.240
and creates an interesting sense of being in a real place,

24:40.240 --> 24:42.800
and it's cool you can find ways of getting from one place to another

24:42.800 --> 24:44.240
and nice little shortcuts,

24:44.240 --> 24:46.800
but it also weakens the game in a lot of ways.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.800
Okay, I know that's contentious.

24:48.800 --> 24:50.880
I'm not stupid. Hear me out here.

24:50.880 --> 24:53.120
It's technically a good thing

24:53.120 --> 24:55.760
that the areas lead across and into each other so much.

24:55.760 --> 24:58.080
Blighttown, for example, is made more interesting

24:58.080 --> 24:59.920
by the fact it connects both the Depths

24:59.920 --> 25:02.080
and the Valley of Drakes and the Great Hollow,

25:02.080 --> 25:03.760
and it leads to Quelaag's domain

25:03.760 --> 25:06.320
and later is used to access the Demon Ruins.

25:07.120 --> 25:09.440
However, let's think for a moment

25:09.440 --> 25:11.920
about level design and encounter design.

25:11.920 --> 25:14.080
When you're designing a world that can be traversed across

25:14.080 --> 25:17.200
to all these different places or even simply back and forth,

25:17.200 --> 25:19.120
in this case, climbing out of Blighttown

25:19.120 --> 25:20.720
once you first kill Quelaag,

25:20.720 --> 25:23.360
you're designing a level that makes compromises

25:23.360 --> 25:25.600
to be usable in all these ways at once.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.440
No enemy encounter can be designed

25:27.440 --> 25:29.440
to play really well in one direction

25:29.440 --> 25:30.560
because you aren't,

25:30.560 --> 25:32.320
and encounters all have to compensate

25:32.320 --> 25:34.880
for the fact you're gonna be coming back through it the other way.

25:34.880 --> 25:36.160
In fact, at a certain point,

25:36.160 --> 25:38.000
it becomes clear the developers realized

25:38.000 --> 25:40.560
they'd forgotten to fully compensate for this.

25:40.560 --> 25:42.720
The blow dart guys who inflict Toxic on you

25:42.720 --> 25:45.760
are basically unavoidable if you're trying to get out

25:45.760 --> 25:48.560
because of the inevitable ladder climbing you have to do.

25:48.560 --> 25:49.920
So they made them not respawn,

25:49.920 --> 25:51.760
so you only ever have to kill them once,

25:51.760 --> 25:53.360
and therefore, on your way back out,

25:53.360 --> 25:54.960
you probably don't have to deal with them at all

25:54.960 --> 25:56.000
because you killed them all.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.400
But this also severely compromises

25:58.400 --> 26:00.160
the challenge of going down

26:00.160 --> 26:01.680
because it means each blow dart guy

26:01.680 --> 26:03.840
only ever has to be dealt with once.

26:03.840 --> 26:05.680
You can basically just run to them,

26:05.680 --> 26:06.720
die killing them,

26:06.720 --> 26:09.440
and then carry on in a now much easier area.

26:09.440 --> 26:10.800
By having to account for the fact

26:10.800 --> 26:12.960
you're gonna have to come back the other way,

26:12.960 --> 26:15.680
the fun and challenge of going through it

26:15.680 --> 26:17.600
either way is hamstrung.

26:17.600 --> 26:19.280
This is not great design.

26:19.280 --> 26:21.920
You can even see a more ideal version of Blighttown

26:21.920 --> 26:23.360
in Anor Londo.

26:23.360 --> 26:26.480
You can only ever fight these enemies this one way,

26:26.480 --> 26:28.800
and that means this one way's really interesting.

26:28.800 --> 26:29.760
You know?

26:29.760 --> 26:30.880
This section's great.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.360
There's no way to come back the way you came,

26:33.360 --> 26:34.880
but there's also no reason to

26:34.880 --> 26:36.480
because once Anor Londo is beaten,

26:36.480 --> 26:39.520
you unlock the ability to warp between bonfires,

26:39.520 --> 26:41.280
seemingly an acknowledgment that this area

26:41.280 --> 26:43.840
makes no sense going through it backwards to get out.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.520
Plus, at this point in the game,

26:45.520 --> 26:47.360
the developers had definitely realized

26:47.360 --> 26:49.200
that running back and forth between areas

26:49.200 --> 26:51.200
is actually really tedious.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.680
But because warping wasn't really fully fleshed out

26:53.680 --> 26:54.640
in Dark Souls 1,

26:54.640 --> 26:56.720
there's an awful lot of needless walking.

26:56.720 --> 26:58.320
Walking back to bonfires you already lit

26:58.320 --> 26:59.360
but can't warp to,

26:59.360 --> 27:00.480
walking through long paths,

27:00.480 --> 27:01.920
or walking through still long

27:01.920 --> 27:03.440
but slightly shorter paths

27:03.440 --> 27:05.840
because this one's technically a shortcut,

27:05.840 --> 27:07.840
and then you die and you have to do it again.

27:07.840 --> 27:09.280
It's not good.

27:09.280 --> 27:10.640
It's not the best it could be.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.280
I just want to fight Artorias again.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.000
It's a cool fight,

27:14.000 --> 27:15.840
but there's, like, five minutes of walking

27:15.840 --> 27:17.280
every single time,

27:17.280 --> 27:19.040
even with this shortcut.

27:19.040 --> 27:19.840
And guess what?

27:19.840 --> 27:22.080
If you didn't find the bonfire at the Daughter of Chaos,

27:22.080 --> 27:23.600
which, by the way, why would you?

27:23.600 --> 27:26.480
Because it's a secret hidden behind an illusionary wall.

27:26.480 --> 27:28.480
There's no nearby warpable bonfire

27:28.480 --> 27:30.000
for beating the Demon Ruins.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.240
So, when it's time to go do that bit,

27:32.240 --> 27:32.960
guess what?

27:32.960 --> 27:34.160
It's time to go all the way back

27:34.160 --> 27:36.080
through Blighttown again.

27:36.080 --> 27:37.840
Yaaaaaay!

27:37.840 --> 27:39.840
Blighttown was so busy leading down

27:39.840 --> 27:41.840
into Quelaag's Domain and the Demon Ruins

27:41.840 --> 27:42.880
and the Great Hollow,

27:42.880 --> 27:45.040
leading across into the Valley of Drakes,

27:45.040 --> 27:46.640
and leading up into the depths

27:46.640 --> 27:47.840
and its own arse

27:47.840 --> 27:50.560
that it forgot to have particularly good gameplay

27:50.560 --> 27:52.640
or to have any frames.

27:52.640 --> 27:53.600
Hey, check it out.

27:53.600 --> 27:56.240
I didn't even need to invoke Dark Souls 2

27:56.240 --> 27:58.800
to explain why Dark Souls 1's interconnectedness

27:58.800 --> 28:00.240
is bad in a lot of cases,

28:00.240 --> 28:01.200
but I guess I should

28:01.200 --> 28:04.160
since I'm talking about Dark Souls 2.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.920
Dark Souls 2's version of Blighttown,

28:05.920 --> 28:06.720
the Gutter,

28:06.720 --> 28:08.160
is way better designed

28:08.160 --> 28:10.320
because it's built to be journeyed through once

28:10.320 --> 28:11.600
in one direction.

28:11.600 --> 28:12.640
Once you're in the Gutter,

28:12.640 --> 28:15.040
it's literally impossible to climb out, actually.

28:15.040 --> 28:16.160
You would have to warp,

28:16.160 --> 28:17.920
which you can now mercifully do

28:17.920 --> 28:19.040
at the beginning of the game

28:19.040 --> 28:20.720
and between any bonfire.

28:20.720 --> 28:21.680
It's almost like this game

28:21.680 --> 28:23.280
was designed to be played by people

28:23.280 --> 28:24.640
who don't want to fucking

28:24.640 --> 28:26.320
run around in circles for hours,

28:26.320 --> 28:27.520
which is an improvement,

28:27.520 --> 28:29.200
I would say, personally.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.560
There's a lot of sheer drops

28:30.560 --> 28:31.840
and daring leaps.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.520
The enemies can be designed purely

28:33.520 --> 28:34.880
for this one direction

28:34.880 --> 28:36.800
and no other bullshit,

28:36.800 --> 28:37.920
like the beetles,

28:37.920 --> 28:39.840
which one direction are better than.

28:39.840 --> 28:41.200
Enemies only stop respawning

28:41.200 --> 28:42.720
if you've killed them so many times,

28:42.720 --> 28:44.400
it's clear they're not really a problem for you

28:44.400 --> 28:46.560
and you just need to get back to later bits

28:46.560 --> 28:47.920
instead of immediately

28:47.920 --> 28:49.520
never respawning ever again

28:49.520 --> 28:50.800
because the developers knew

28:50.800 --> 28:52.560
they were a bit rubbish.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.480
The treatment of these areas in particular

28:54.480 --> 28:55.760
is emblematic—

28:55.760 --> 28:56.560
I love that word—

28:56.560 --> 28:58.640
of the game's overall approaches to design

28:58.640 --> 29:00.640
and I'm not gonna tell you which one is better,

29:00.640 --> 29:01.760
but it's obvious.

29:01.760 --> 29:03.360
So far, I've only talked about world design

29:03.360 --> 29:05.040
in terms of the ensuing level design,

29:05.040 --> 29:07.280
but that's not the only thing impacted by that.

29:07.280 --> 29:09.120
There's also an aesthetic component

29:09.120 --> 29:10.880
and this, I think, is an aspect

29:10.880 --> 29:12.720
that most exemplifies the difference

29:12.720 --> 29:14.160
in concerns and goals

29:14.160 --> 29:16.800
between the first two Dark Souls games in particular.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.880
Dark Souls 1's world has, let's call it,

29:18.880 --> 29:21.040
a physical coherency to it.

29:21.040 --> 29:22.400
If you're standing in a high place

29:22.400 --> 29:23.600
and look in a direction,

29:23.600 --> 29:25.120
you will see a place you end up going

29:25.120 --> 29:26.080
later in the game.

29:26.080 --> 29:27.600
The world of Lordran feels like

29:27.600 --> 29:30.000
a physically consistent, objective world.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.400
Here's a 3D model of the Dark Souls 1 world.

29:32.400 --> 29:35.040
Apart from a few very clearly separated sections,

29:35.040 --> 29:36.560
it all physically ties together,

29:36.560 --> 29:37.520
which is pretty cool.

29:37.520 --> 29:38.960
Meanwhile, in Dark Souls 2,

29:38.960 --> 29:40.480
this is far from the case.

29:40.480 --> 29:42.880
Plenty of places don't make visual sense.

29:42.880 --> 29:44.400
You can get to the top of a tower

29:44.400 --> 29:46.240
you physically see in the distance

29:46.240 --> 29:47.680
and you can see how tall it is,

29:47.680 --> 29:48.960
but then at the tippy top,

29:48.960 --> 29:50.400
you find an elevator

29:50.400 --> 29:52.320
and it takes you further up

29:52.320 --> 29:53.600
into nowhere

29:53.600 --> 29:55.600
and you emerge in a lava land

29:55.600 --> 29:57.280
that couldn't possibly exist.

29:57.280 --> 29:58.400
Theoretically, you could dig

29:58.400 --> 29:59.840
a deep enough hole in the ground

29:59.840 --> 30:01.440
and all the lava would just flow out

30:01.440 --> 30:03.120
into the world below and kill everyone.

30:03.120 --> 30:04.720
Remember the compiled 3D model

30:04.720 --> 30:05.920
of Dark Souls 1?

30:05.920 --> 30:07.760
Here's the model for Dark Souls 2.

30:07.760 --> 30:10.640
["Dark Souls II"-style music playing in the background,

30:10.640 --> 30:12.880
with a fast-paced drum beat,

30:12.880 --> 30:16.160
and a fast-paced drum beat with a fast-paced drum beat

30:16.160 --> 30:19.040
and a fast-paced drum beat with a fast-paced drum beat

30:19.040 --> 30:21.760
and a fast-paced drum beat with a fast-paced drum beat

30:21.760 --> 30:23.760
and a fast-paced drum beat with a fast-paced drum beat

30:23.920 --> 30:26.880
It's just they're in the same place.

30:26.880 --> 30:28.480
The universe of Dark Souls 2

30:28.480 --> 30:31.520
is a nonsensical, free-associative nightmare

30:31.520 --> 30:34.080
in which you find yourself in impossible places,

30:34.080 --> 30:36.000
architecture giving way to other worlds

30:36.000 --> 30:37.120
without warning,

30:37.120 --> 30:39.680
the world itself falling apart,

30:39.680 --> 30:41.760
becoming physically untrustworthy.

30:41.760 --> 30:44.480
It's an Overlook Hotel-style monster.

30:44.480 --> 30:47.440
People have criticized the game for being like this,

30:47.440 --> 30:49.920
but I have a question.

30:49.920 --> 30:51.680
How is this a bad thing?

30:51.760 --> 30:54.800
The sense of mystery this creates was really compelling to me

30:54.800 --> 30:56.320
as I worked my way through the world.

30:56.320 --> 30:57.920
I never knew what I was going to see next

30:57.920 --> 30:59.840
because I literally couldn't see it coming.

30:59.840 --> 31:01.600
Something I enjoyed about Dark Souls 1

31:01.600 --> 31:04.720
was this idea that time itself was beginning to fall apart.

31:04.720 --> 31:07.760
You encountered the spirits of those who came before you and died,

31:07.760 --> 31:10.560
like you could find their armor on presumably their corpses,

31:10.560 --> 31:13.200
and in the DLC, you literally go back in time.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.640
The Age of Fire was ending,

31:14.640 --> 31:17.920
and reality, on some level, was ending with it.

31:17.920 --> 31:19.760
Dark Souls 2 gets to constantly benefit

31:19.760 --> 31:22.320
not only from linearity leading to specific visuals

31:22.320 --> 31:24.160
along with better-planned encounters,

31:24.160 --> 31:27.760
but it's pushed up even further by embracing inconsistency.

31:27.760 --> 31:30.160
The result is that you're constantly parading through places

31:30.160 --> 31:31.920
that feel like they're out of a fantasy film

31:31.920 --> 31:33.520
or an 80s album cover.

31:33.520 --> 31:35.840
Take, for example, the Dragon Shrine right here.

31:35.840 --> 31:39.920
You get this majestic moment of a secret sky castle.

31:39.920 --> 31:41.040
I say that again.

31:41.040 --> 31:44.960
Secret sky castle being revealed to you for the first time,

31:44.960 --> 31:47.200
completely hidden from visibility

31:47.200 --> 31:48.800
until you go up this one elevator.

31:48.800 --> 31:52.560
You get this ridiculously epic, in the traditional sense,

31:52.560 --> 31:55.440
grandiose shot of a majestic, ornate shrine

31:55.440 --> 31:56.960
circled by a dozen dragons

31:56.960 --> 31:59.600
revealing itself to you as you go through a passage.

31:59.600 --> 32:01.360
You can't see the shrine from the ground,

32:01.360 --> 32:04.320
and you can't see any landmarks on the ground below from here.

32:04.320 --> 32:07.680
Concrete cohesiveness is thrown out in favor of a puzzling,

32:07.680 --> 32:10.800
surprising, and beautiful incohesiveness.

32:10.800 --> 32:14.400
We're dealing with two contrasting methods of showing a fantasy world.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.640
I say contrasting because, in my opinion,

32:16.640 --> 32:18.800
neither is inherently superior.

32:18.800 --> 32:21.600
The trouble, I think, is that some either assume this

32:21.600 --> 32:22.720
because the first did,

32:22.720 --> 32:24.880
or simply wanted what the first had.

32:24.880 --> 32:27.920
And that's not quite the same as judging something on its own merits,

32:27.920 --> 32:29.520
but I can still see the point there.

32:29.520 --> 32:35.040
["Dark Souls II"]

32:35.040 --> 32:37.600
I've heard the complaint that Dark Souls II is linear.

32:37.600 --> 32:38.960
This is true.

32:38.960 --> 32:41.920
Many critics then go on to say that this makes it worse than Dark Souls,

32:41.920 --> 32:43.440
which was non-linear.

32:43.440 --> 32:46.160
This is treason, and I'll see you in hell.

32:46.160 --> 32:50.000
As we just established, Dark Souls is interconnected.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.920
It is not non-linear.

32:51.920 --> 32:54.000
This is not semantics. This is a big deal.

32:54.000 --> 32:54.880
I swear to God.

32:54.880 --> 32:58.400
You have clear-cut objectives that you have to complete in a set order.

32:58.400 --> 33:02.560
You can technically kill Quelaag first before the bell gargoyles.

33:02.560 --> 33:05.120
You can also ignore the depths if you want to.

33:05.120 --> 33:07.440
But you have to kill these two bosses,

33:07.440 --> 33:09.040
you have to ring two bells,

33:09.040 --> 33:10.800
you have to do Sen's Fortress,

33:10.800 --> 33:12.320
and then you do Anor Londo,

33:12.320 --> 33:14.800
and then you have to collect four Lord Souls to progress,

33:14.800 --> 33:17.040
which you can do in any order if you want,

33:17.040 --> 33:18.560
but you have to do all of them.

33:18.560 --> 33:20.240
This isn't non-linear.

33:20.240 --> 33:23.440
This is a choice of which linear path you take first.

33:23.440 --> 33:27.440
This sense of linearity is disguised by the interconnectedness

33:27.440 --> 33:30.000
and the sense of having to run back and forth through a world

33:30.000 --> 33:32.080
because the warps weren't fully fleshed out,

33:32.080 --> 33:33.920
but that's not non-linearity.

33:33.920 --> 33:39.360
That's actually kind of bad design, uh, masking linearity.

33:39.360 --> 33:40.800
At least in Dark Souls II,

33:40.800 --> 33:43.520
you don't technically need to beat all four main bosses

33:43.520 --> 33:45.360
to unlock the entrance to Drangleic.

33:45.360 --> 33:47.120
You can just get a lot of souls.

33:47.120 --> 33:49.360
That's actually way more of an alternative

33:49.360 --> 33:51.520
than any part of Dark Souls I.

33:51.520 --> 33:53.600
For a hugely entertaining comparison,

33:53.600 --> 33:56.560
check out the two AGDQ speedruns of the two games.

33:56.560 --> 34:00.000
Oh, I started with a Master Key so I can kill the two bosses

34:00.000 --> 34:02.800
I have no choice but to kill in a slightly different order

34:02.800 --> 34:04.160
if I want to,

34:04.160 --> 34:06.720
but I'm, uh, I'm not going to

34:06.720 --> 34:09.840
because it turns out the intended way was faster anyway.

34:09.840 --> 34:11.600
Fuck you! I used Bonfire Aesthetics

34:11.600 --> 34:12.960
to kill the Rotten four times

34:12.960 --> 34:15.280
and skip three quarters of the main fucking game.

34:15.280 --> 34:17.120
See you in shit, Dark Souls!

34:17.120 --> 34:19.920
Also, not only could Dark Souls have easily been less linear

34:19.920 --> 34:20.960
if it wanted to,

34:20.960 --> 34:22.960
the game fucking contrives itself

34:22.960 --> 34:26.240
to ensure that it isn't with needless bullshit.

34:26.240 --> 34:27.760
Do you want to beat Seath the Skeletalist

34:27.760 --> 34:29.600
before putting the Lordvessel on the thing?

34:29.600 --> 34:30.720
Nice try, idiot.

34:30.720 --> 34:32.320
Impassable magic fog.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.520
Oh, you just beat Quelaag?

34:33.520 --> 34:35.840
I want to see what's going on in the obvious path past her

34:35.840 --> 34:37.120
that it makes sense to go down

34:37.120 --> 34:39.280
instead of climbing all the way back out immediately.

34:39.280 --> 34:40.240
Well, fuck you!

34:40.240 --> 34:42.160
We put some fucking mist here

34:42.160 --> 34:43.920
because we arbitrarily decided

34:43.920 --> 34:45.200
you don't get to do this stuff.

34:45.200 --> 34:46.720
You got to do the other things first.

34:46.720 --> 34:50.000
See you in 10 to 15 hours, you worthless piss hound.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.760
Do you want to see what Neato's up to?

34:51.760 --> 34:52.880
Tune in next time when—

34:52.880 --> 34:55.200
Go fuck yourself, idiot!

34:55.200 --> 34:57.840
Do you want to kill the four kings before doing anything else?

34:57.840 --> 34:58.880
Well, guess what?

34:58.880 --> 34:59.520
You can.

34:59.520 --> 35:01.520
You can get their Lord Soul first thing if you want to.

35:01.520 --> 35:03.520
You just need Artorias' ring from Sif.

35:03.520 --> 35:04.400
Oh, my goodness.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.960
There's so much freedom in these games.

35:06.960 --> 35:09.360
A similar mechanic is used in Dark Souls II,

35:09.360 --> 35:12.160
but it's with doors that are off the beaten path,

35:12.160 --> 35:15.440
do not block the most obvious form of progress,

35:15.440 --> 35:16.960
and you might even forget about them

35:16.960 --> 35:18.240
until you get the king's ring

35:18.240 --> 35:20.240
and realize that's the symbol of the king

35:20.240 --> 35:21.280
they were talking about,

35:21.280 --> 35:23.040
and it's like you figured out a mystery

35:23.040 --> 35:25.440
and you get to watch an ancient fantasy door

35:25.440 --> 35:27.120
slowly unlock when you put it on.

35:27.120 --> 35:28.640
I like ancient fantasy doors.

35:28.640 --> 35:31.040
They're—they're a thing that I'm into.

35:31.040 --> 35:32.880
That sounds really weird, but I mean that.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.080
I like cool doors.

35:34.720 --> 35:35.280
Shut up.

35:35.280 --> 35:35.920
They're nice.

35:35.920 --> 35:36.800
It's a nice door!

35:41.040 --> 35:42.400
On top of all of that,

35:42.400 --> 35:45.920
Dark Souls II has a very different kind of design overall

35:45.920 --> 35:48.000
with an enhanced focus on player freedom

35:48.000 --> 35:49.280
in the actual fights,

35:49.280 --> 35:50.560
which are the things that you spend

35:50.560 --> 35:52.240
most of the time doing in these games.

35:52.240 --> 35:54.400
Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1's encounters

35:54.400 --> 35:56.800
are, in a sense, kind of restrictive.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.400
Each area and encounter,

35:58.400 --> 36:00.160
by which I mean distinguishable fight

36:00.160 --> 36:01.680
between a group in the game,

36:01.680 --> 36:04.560
exists to test the player in some specific way.

36:04.560 --> 36:06.480
The Tower Knight exists to test

36:06.480 --> 36:07.760
how you deal with an encounter

36:07.760 --> 36:09.040
with one big slow enemy

36:09.040 --> 36:11.440
supplemented by a multitude of ranged attackers.

36:11.440 --> 36:12.720
The player can use any items

36:12.720 --> 36:14.480
they have at their disposal to deal with this—

36:14.480 --> 36:16.800
magic, swords, shields, items, or what have you—

36:16.800 --> 36:18.960
but crucially, the same skill is being tested

36:18.960 --> 36:20.000
no matter what,

36:20.000 --> 36:22.480
namely, how you deal with this one situation.

36:22.480 --> 36:23.920
So no matter what your loadout was—

36:23.920 --> 36:28.960
you know, axe, big sword, daggers, magic, arrows—

36:28.960 --> 36:31.120
you're either dodging a ridiculous amount of arrows

36:31.120 --> 36:32.080
to fight this guy,

36:32.080 --> 36:34.400
or more likely taking out all the archers one by one

36:34.400 --> 36:36.000
with whatever you happen to have on you

36:36.000 --> 36:37.680
and then engaging the knight on his own.

36:37.680 --> 36:39.280
The archers on the walls of Anor Londo

36:39.280 --> 36:40.480
exist to test how you deal with

36:40.480 --> 36:41.600
walking down a straight path

36:41.600 --> 36:43.280
with attacks that can easily knock you off.

36:43.280 --> 36:45.040
No matter what sort of character you are,

36:45.040 --> 36:47.680
the same thing is being tested no matter what,

36:47.680 --> 36:49.280
and you have to employ the same skills

36:49.280 --> 36:50.720
to get past it no matter what.

36:50.720 --> 36:53.520
You're literally walking a straight, linear path.

36:53.520 --> 36:55.200
A lot of the first two Souls games

36:55.200 --> 36:57.440
are based on putting you in a specific place,

36:57.440 --> 36:59.440
then throwing a specific thing at you

36:59.440 --> 37:02.240
and making you deal with it the way they want you to do.

37:02.240 --> 37:03.200
In Sen's Fortress,

37:03.200 --> 37:05.040
you're walking between the same sets of traps

37:05.040 --> 37:07.600
and negotiating the same fortress in the same way

37:07.600 --> 37:09.600
no matter what character you built.

37:09.600 --> 37:10.640
In all of these examples,

37:10.640 --> 37:12.720
the focus is on an enclosed space

37:12.720 --> 37:15.040
so you can be forced into dealing with the scenario

37:15.040 --> 37:17.520
the developers want you to engage with.

37:17.520 --> 37:20.560
Ironically, despite being supposedly way more linear,

37:20.560 --> 37:22.080
Dark Souls 2 is generally designed

37:22.080 --> 37:23.920
in a much more free, open way

37:23.920 --> 37:25.600
in regards to its encounters.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.840
Encounters take place in a much wider open area

37:27.840 --> 37:29.360
with a focus on having more space

37:29.360 --> 37:31.120
to navigate as you see fit.

37:31.120 --> 37:32.880
Pair ogs on play.

37:32.880 --> 37:34.720
In this room, there are several knights.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.520
The knights are very difficult to face as a bunched-up group,

37:37.520 --> 37:40.080
but if you want, you can lead them out onto the battlements

37:40.080 --> 37:41.920
where they're unable to attack all at once.

37:41.920 --> 37:43.760
However, there's a risk of falling off

37:43.760 --> 37:46.000
and there's a guy in the distance shooting arrows at you.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.320
The player is encouraged to know where they want to fight

37:48.320 --> 37:51.680
and make decisions about how to engage in the combat

37:51.680 --> 37:53.440
beyond knowing when to dodge

37:53.440 --> 37:56.160
in fights against more manageable amounts of enemies.

37:56.160 --> 37:57.840
This approach generally extends

37:57.840 --> 37:59.200
throughout the rest of the game.

37:59.200 --> 38:00.800
This increases player freedom

38:00.800 --> 38:03.280
by letting them decide precisely how and where

38:03.280 --> 38:04.480
to pitch their battles,

38:04.480 --> 38:06.000
and mobility and positioning

38:06.000 --> 38:08.240
become much more important aspects of the game.

38:08.240 --> 38:11.200
Combat is much more free form as a result.

38:11.200 --> 38:14.480
Archers in the previous games are, let's call it, forceful.

38:14.480 --> 38:16.320
They're put there, and you have no choice

38:16.320 --> 38:17.280
but to deal with them.

38:17.280 --> 38:19.120
They're usually supplementing a different enemy,

38:19.120 --> 38:20.640
so you either have to deal with them

38:20.640 --> 38:22.480
while the archers are shooting at you,

38:22.480 --> 38:24.640
or you have to take time out before that fight

38:24.640 --> 38:25.760
just to deal with the archers

38:25.760 --> 38:27.280
before resuming it unhindered.

38:27.280 --> 38:29.440
And if you die, you have to take the time out

38:29.440 --> 38:30.880
to deal with the archers yet again,

38:30.880 --> 38:32.400
along with walking all the way back

38:32.400 --> 38:33.600
through a gauntlet of enemies,

38:33.600 --> 38:35.920
which, in these games, always respawn.

38:35.920 --> 38:37.760
God, that sounds like fun, doesn't it?

38:37.760 --> 38:38.960
I wonder why, statistically,

38:38.960 --> 38:40.880
so many people stop playing here.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.000
I wonder.

38:42.000 --> 38:42.720
I-I...

38:42.720 --> 38:44.400
Maybe it's the player's fault.

38:44.400 --> 38:45.840
Ranged attackers in Dark Souls II

38:45.840 --> 38:47.520
are tremendously less annoying.

38:47.520 --> 38:49.120
Take, for example, the ones in the encounter

38:49.120 --> 38:50.320
I already described.

38:50.320 --> 38:52.400
The player has the option of engaging the enemy

38:52.400 --> 38:54.240
in places the archer can't attack you at all,

38:54.240 --> 38:55.520
but fighting in that area

38:55.520 --> 38:57.200
has its own particular trade-offs.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.960
The player gets to decide

38:58.960 --> 39:00.240
how to deal with the archers

39:00.240 --> 39:02.000
instead of basically having no choice

39:02.000 --> 39:03.440
but to continuously dodge them

39:03.440 --> 39:05.120
because this is THE place

39:05.120 --> 39:06.800
this fight is supposed to happen,

39:06.800 --> 39:08.800
or painstakingly take them out

39:08.800 --> 39:11.200
every time you want to do the fight.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.200
There's archers and other kinds of ranged attackers

39:13.200 --> 39:14.800
in the Forest of Fallen Giants,

39:14.800 --> 39:16.240
but there's now room to maneuver

39:16.240 --> 39:18.160
and move your enemies away from their range

39:18.160 --> 39:20.400
into different areas with different characteristics.

39:20.400 --> 39:21.760
Like I said, you get to choose

39:21.760 --> 39:23.600
how and where to have these fights.

39:23.600 --> 39:26.080
The open space is better for the clump of enemies,

39:26.080 --> 39:28.000
but you have to worry about the archer,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.320
or you can go for the ranged attackers first

39:30.320 --> 39:32.720
and take the risk of being overwhelmed or caught out,

39:32.720 --> 39:34.720
but then fight them free from that problem.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.240
You can chase after the archers here,

39:36.240 --> 39:37.680
but they'll follow you up the ladder,

39:37.680 --> 39:38.800
and that'll create a gauntlet,

39:38.800 --> 39:40.480
which you then have to avoid by jumping down

39:40.480 --> 39:42.480
or cutting through them.

39:42.480 --> 39:44.640
This fight can play out a lot of different ways

39:44.640 --> 39:46.640
based on how you choose to move within it,

39:46.640 --> 39:48.400
whereas in the previous games,

39:48.400 --> 39:50.080
it's mostly just you have to do this thing

39:50.080 --> 39:50.960
first till you'll die,

39:50.960 --> 39:51.920
and then you dodge the attacks

39:51.920 --> 39:53.920
and attack them to win,

39:53.920 --> 39:56.720
and honestly, Dark Souls 2's better.

39:56.720 --> 39:58.320
Often people have criticized this game

39:58.320 --> 40:00.800
for having multitudes more enemies to fight at once,

40:00.800 --> 40:03.360
and this is an artificial inflation of difficulty,

40:03.360 --> 40:05.120
but the thing is, because of Dark Souls 2's

40:05.120 --> 40:07.280
vastly different kind of level design,

40:07.280 --> 40:09.440
this is simply a different kind of challenge

40:09.440 --> 40:11.280
provided to the player than the previous ones,

40:11.280 --> 40:12.800
and it's not an insurmountable one.

40:12.800 --> 40:14.800
The challenge in areas with tons of dudes

40:14.800 --> 40:17.360
is in how you deal with tons of dudes at once.

40:17.360 --> 40:18.400
If you're out of position,

40:18.400 --> 40:20.880
you'll get displaced and destroyed by the swarm.

40:20.880 --> 40:23.200
Videos critical of the amount of enemies in Dark Souls 2

40:23.280 --> 40:25.120
will often show you contextless footage

40:25.120 --> 40:28.080
of their character surrounded and being ganked to death,

40:28.080 --> 40:30.000
and look how unfair this is,

40:30.000 --> 40:31.440
but what they're showing takes place

40:31.440 --> 40:33.680
after the point where they already messed up

40:33.680 --> 40:35.600
by letting themselves get utterly surrounded

40:35.600 --> 40:37.040
like this in the first place.

40:37.040 --> 40:39.200
The previous games rarely make your strategy

40:39.200 --> 40:40.880
when it comes to relative positioning

40:40.880 --> 40:42.720
as crucial as Dark Souls 2,

40:42.720 --> 40:43.760
but there are a couple.

40:43.760 --> 40:45.920
My fave is this bridge in Demon's Souls.

40:45.920 --> 40:47.200
Once you stand here,

40:47.200 --> 40:48.720
see the guys blocking the end,

40:48.720 --> 40:50.240
and turn around and realize

40:50.240 --> 40:52.320
every enemy you failed to kill on the way here

40:52.400 --> 40:54.320
is now funneling down the other end,

40:54.320 --> 40:57.040
you're struck with the beautifully tense realization

40:57.040 --> 40:59.360
that if you don't do something now,

40:59.360 --> 41:00.560
you're already dead.

41:00.560 --> 41:03.200
But many of the main areas and boss fights in Dark Souls 2

41:03.200 --> 41:05.120
draw this aspect into critical focus

41:05.120 --> 41:07.040
and in a much more freeform way,

41:07.040 --> 41:09.440
where instead of simply being trapped in a small area,

41:09.440 --> 41:10.640
you're in a large area

41:10.640 --> 41:11.680
and have to deal with a group

41:11.680 --> 41:13.760
that's actively threatening to surround you.

41:13.760 --> 41:16.640
Instead of the passive challenge of a physical choke point,

41:16.640 --> 41:18.320
the fight is a reactive challenge

41:18.320 --> 41:20.160
in the form of a moving set of enemies

41:20.160 --> 41:21.840
that can easily form a choke point

41:21.840 --> 41:22.880
with their own movements,

41:22.880 --> 41:24.720
which you can then deal with however you like.

41:24.720 --> 41:27.120
Fights against groups can play out totally differently

41:27.120 --> 41:28.720
based on how you fight in them,

41:28.720 --> 41:30.240
and that's just really cool.

41:30.240 --> 41:31.840
When a friend was playing through Dark Souls 1

41:31.840 --> 41:32.880
and asking for help,

41:32.880 --> 41:34.400
I would just tell them literally the thing

41:34.400 --> 41:35.920
they were meant to do to get past that area,

41:35.920 --> 41:37.840
because usually there was one main way,

41:37.840 --> 41:38.720
and if you didn't know what it was,

41:38.720 --> 41:39.440
it would kill you.

41:39.440 --> 41:40.320
In Dark Souls 2,

41:40.320 --> 41:42.160
the same friend never had to ask for advice

41:42.160 --> 41:43.920
because they were free to figure it out.

41:43.920 --> 41:44.960
There were other ways through

41:44.960 --> 41:46.400
based on what things they had with them

41:46.400 --> 41:48.320
and how they wanted to do that fight.

41:48.320 --> 41:50.000
It was a lot more interesting

41:50.000 --> 41:52.480
for players who aren't already mega fans

41:52.480 --> 41:53.680
of the first Dark Souls game

41:53.680 --> 41:55.920
and what it specifically did with fights.

41:55.920 --> 41:58.080
I think people who want to be critical of Dark Souls 2

41:58.080 --> 41:59.440
can look at the amount of enemies and go,

41:59.440 --> 42:00.720
ah, they just threw more in,

42:00.720 --> 42:02.720
but the entire design of the game

42:02.720 --> 42:05.120
is almost fundamentally different in so many ways

42:05.120 --> 42:08.000
that I really don't feel like that's an accurate comparison.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
The Shrine of Amarna has a ton of magic users,

42:10.000 --> 42:11.920
but they're in an area where firing back at them

42:11.920 --> 42:12.880
is finally doable,

42:12.880 --> 42:14.640
unlike the archers in the Tower Knight fight

42:14.640 --> 42:15.920
or the Demon fight,

42:15.920 --> 42:17.680
and you can use magic or arrows

42:17.680 --> 42:19.200
based on what you have with you.

42:19.200 --> 42:20.320
Dodging them is trivial

42:20.320 --> 42:22.000
because you can see the attacks coming

42:22.000 --> 42:23.760
far more than a bunch of tiny arrows,

42:23.760 --> 42:25.680
and there's plenty of cover you can utilize

42:25.680 --> 42:26.720
in various different ways

42:26.720 --> 42:27.680
so you can fight enemies

42:27.680 --> 42:30.000
while not in the way of magic if you want to.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.720
The final run to the boss is famously very tough,

42:32.720 --> 42:34.400
but this is a fairly late game area

42:34.400 --> 42:35.680
in a Dark Souls game.

42:35.680 --> 42:38.560
It being hard is kind of the thing

42:38.560 --> 42:40.560
that you paid to do.

42:40.560 --> 42:42.480
Also, I just summoned for it.

42:42.480 --> 42:43.680
It's okay. I don't have a problem with it.

42:43.680 --> 42:44.800
They usually die during the fight,

42:44.800 --> 42:46.000
and that makes it interesting

42:46.000 --> 42:47.840
because it's like you take casualties

42:47.840 --> 42:49.040
and then you carry on.

42:49.120 --> 42:49.760
I like it.

42:49.760 --> 42:51.360
I like summoning in these games.

42:51.360 --> 42:52.640
There's a bunch of purists out there

42:52.640 --> 42:52.960
who are like,

42:52.960 --> 42:54.320
I never summon for any fights

42:54.320 --> 42:56.640
because I want to be the best.

42:56.640 --> 42:57.920
I want to handle them all.

43:00.400 --> 43:02.000
I mean, sure.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.440
Yeah, good for you.

43:03.440 --> 43:05.280
I'm sure it feels tremendously good,

43:05.280 --> 43:06.240
and it must be really annoying

43:06.240 --> 43:06.800
that there are fights

43:06.800 --> 43:08.800
that you really, really should summon for,

43:08.800 --> 43:11.680
but I like having friends

43:11.680 --> 43:13.920
who join me and do stuff.

43:13.920 --> 43:14.560
I like that.

43:15.120 --> 43:16.720
Speaking of having friends,

43:16.720 --> 43:18.640
Dark Souls 2 lets you have friends.

43:18.640 --> 43:20.800
There are even rings your character can wear

43:20.800 --> 43:22.640
that mean it's really easy to single out

43:22.640 --> 43:24.960
exactly who you want to summon.

43:24.960 --> 43:27.680
You can have friends in Dark Souls now.

43:27.680 --> 43:29.440
The network isn't going to melt down.

43:29.440 --> 43:30.560
You're not going to have to install

43:30.560 --> 43:32.160
a bunch of third-party mods

43:32.160 --> 43:33.680
and hope that makes it work.

43:35.040 --> 43:37.200
The game works now, guys.

43:37.200 --> 43:38.800
I don't want to be seen to be dismissive

43:38.800 --> 43:41.120
and just say people who die a lot

43:41.120 --> 43:43.040
in group encounters are just bad at it

43:43.040 --> 43:45.440
and their criticism is false.

43:45.440 --> 43:46.640
That would be really stupid

43:46.640 --> 43:48.240
to just say out loud like that.

43:48.240 --> 43:50.640
So instead, I said it over...

43:51.600 --> 43:52.160
10 minutes.

43:52.160 --> 44:01.120
♪♪

44:01.120 --> 44:02.240
Some of you might be familiar

44:02.240 --> 44:03.600
with my video about Bloodborne.

44:03.600 --> 44:05.360
It kinda revolutionized

44:05.360 --> 44:07.680
the face of game design for all time.

44:07.680 --> 44:08.240
Just kidding.

44:08.240 --> 44:10.320
But it did kind of invent a newish concept,

44:10.320 --> 44:11.280
at least I think it does.

44:11.280 --> 44:13.040
I haven't heard anyone else using it before,

44:13.040 --> 44:14.400
called play conditioning,

44:14.400 --> 44:15.920
which refers to the way a game

44:15.920 --> 44:16.960
leads you to play it

44:17.040 --> 44:19.120
with the execution of its mechanics.

44:19.120 --> 44:20.960
When a game kills you very easily,

44:20.960 --> 44:22.240
tells you to prepare to die,

44:22.240 --> 44:23.200
and hands you a shield,

44:23.200 --> 44:24.400
and teaches you how to use it,

44:24.400 --> 44:25.520
you're taught specific rules

44:25.520 --> 44:26.480
about that game's world

44:26.480 --> 44:27.520
and it sticks with you.

44:27.520 --> 44:28.880
The rest of the game experience

44:28.880 --> 44:29.920
could have been better served

44:29.920 --> 44:31.520
by a different early approach,

44:31.520 --> 44:33.360
but you've been quite definitively taught

44:33.360 --> 44:34.480
a specific one

44:34.480 --> 44:35.600
and it'll probably be a struggle

44:35.600 --> 44:36.560
to unlearn it.

44:36.560 --> 44:37.760
I brought this up in the video

44:37.760 --> 44:39.040
to make the point that Bloodborne

44:39.040 --> 44:40.640
quite deftly pushes the player

44:40.640 --> 44:42.320
into a more frenetic direction

44:42.320 --> 44:43.600
with a few subtle changes

44:43.600 --> 44:44.720
to its base mechanics

44:44.720 --> 44:46.960
and much wider reaching executions

44:46.960 --> 44:48.240
of those mechanics.

44:48.240 --> 44:50.400
There is still one or maybe two

44:50.400 --> 44:51.360
shields in the game,

44:51.360 --> 44:53.600
but you don't find them for so long

44:53.600 --> 44:55.440
that you learned not to use them.

44:55.440 --> 44:57.040
They exist almost to show you

44:57.040 --> 44:59.200
that you never really needed them.

44:59.200 --> 45:01.440
The shield engendered passivity.

45:01.440 --> 45:03.520
That wording's actually kind of genius.

45:03.520 --> 45:05.200
The game's own item description

45:05.200 --> 45:07.440
directly blames shields themselves,

45:07.440 --> 45:09.040
not players for not realizing

45:09.040 --> 45:10.560
how they're supposed to use them.

45:10.560 --> 45:12.400
I think that's really clever

45:12.400 --> 45:13.760
and also an honest admission

45:13.760 --> 45:14.960
that they kind of messed up

45:14.960 --> 45:16.160
in Dark Souls 1.

45:16.160 --> 45:17.840
Some folks disagreed with my comments

45:17.840 --> 45:18.720
that playing with a shield

45:18.720 --> 45:20.080
was an inherently wrong,

45:20.080 --> 45:21.600
slow, overly defensive,

45:21.600 --> 45:22.720
or boring way to play,

45:22.720 --> 45:24.240
and I do have to stress

45:24.240 --> 45:25.600
that's just my opinion.

45:25.600 --> 45:27.440
You can play the games however you want.

45:27.440 --> 45:28.720
I'm just describing how the game

45:28.720 --> 45:30.480
is most fun in my opinion

45:30.480 --> 45:31.680
and the ways I think the game

45:31.680 --> 45:32.960
leads people to play it

45:32.960 --> 45:34.000
in those more fun ways

45:34.000 --> 45:35.040
than the previous ones.

45:35.040 --> 45:36.480
While Bloodborne is undisputedly

45:36.480 --> 45:37.520
the master of this,

45:37.520 --> 45:38.560
Dark Souls 2 does a lot

45:38.560 --> 45:39.680
of really great things

45:39.680 --> 45:41.120
with play conditioning also,

45:41.120 --> 45:42.480
things that other critics dismiss

45:42.480 --> 45:43.440
as minor tweaks

45:43.440 --> 45:44.960
or just don't talk about at all.

45:44.960 --> 45:45.920
In the Bloodborne video,

45:45.920 --> 45:47.360
my central example was the shield,

45:47.360 --> 45:48.960
and we might as well start there too

45:48.960 --> 45:49.760
because people don't

45:49.760 --> 45:50.720
fucking mention this.

45:50.720 --> 45:52.160
Dark Souls 2 has shields.

45:52.160 --> 45:53.200
It has plenty of them,

45:53.200 --> 45:54.080
and they're fine.

45:54.080 --> 45:54.720
They work well,

45:54.720 --> 45:56.400
and you can get some very defend-y ones

45:56.400 --> 45:57.600
that do all the stuff you need,

45:57.600 --> 45:58.640
and you can buff them

45:58.640 --> 46:00.080
lots of different ways too,

46:00.080 --> 46:01.520
but here's the thing.

46:01.520 --> 46:03.360
Only one class

46:03.360 --> 46:05.360
starts with a shield at all

46:05.360 --> 46:06.880
in Dark Souls 2.

46:06.880 --> 46:09.040
In fact, that class, the warrior,

46:09.040 --> 46:11.520
begins life with a broken sword.

46:11.520 --> 46:12.320
Every other character

46:12.320 --> 46:13.360
starts with some semblance

46:13.360 --> 46:14.560
of a fighting setup.

46:14.560 --> 46:16.080
The knight has a broadsword,

46:16.080 --> 46:18.160
the swordsman has two plus one swords,

46:18.160 --> 46:20.000
the bandit has an axe and a bow,

46:20.000 --> 46:20.800
and so on.

46:20.800 --> 46:22.080
Starting with a shield

46:22.080 --> 46:23.440
handicaps you in many ways

46:23.440 --> 46:24.400
at the start of this game.

46:24.400 --> 46:26.320
It forces you to use ingenuity

46:26.320 --> 46:27.360
to get access to a weapon

46:27.360 --> 46:28.400
that's more viable.

46:28.400 --> 46:30.400
It's not even that great a shield.

46:30.400 --> 46:32.000
Other classes having no shield

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
are forced to use dodging or parrying

46:34.000 --> 46:35.920
or make good use of what they're given.

46:35.920 --> 46:38.240
This is a tiny, tiny, simple change

46:38.240 --> 46:40.000
to just starting loadouts,

46:40.000 --> 46:42.240
but it's fantastic design.

46:42.400 --> 46:43.600
It alters the shape

46:43.600 --> 46:45.680
of the entire game experience.

46:45.680 --> 46:47.920
You're expected, told even,

46:47.920 --> 46:48.960
to make use of the engine

46:48.960 --> 46:50.000
in a vastly different way

46:50.000 --> 46:50.960
from how you're led to think

46:50.960 --> 46:52.800
you're supposed to play the first game.

46:52.800 --> 46:54.240
Shields you acquire early on

46:54.240 --> 46:56.000
don't even block 100% of damage,

46:56.000 --> 46:57.360
and you don't have much life,

46:57.360 --> 46:59.520
so blocking is treated as a last resort

46:59.520 --> 47:00.560
for if you really don't know

47:00.560 --> 47:02.080
what else to do about an attack

47:02.080 --> 47:03.760
or haven't learned its timing yet.

47:03.760 --> 47:05.600
Dark Souls 2 is the first game in the series

47:05.600 --> 47:06.800
where you started getting players

47:06.800 --> 47:08.400
who were more casually walking around

47:08.400 --> 47:09.440
without a shield at all,

47:09.440 --> 47:10.640
preferring two-handing

47:10.640 --> 47:12.080
or the new power stance

47:12.080 --> 47:13.840
added for dual-wielding characters.

47:13.840 --> 47:15.040
By the time you reach shields

47:15.040 --> 47:16.400
that actually block lots of damage

47:16.400 --> 47:18.400
the way early shields did in the first game,

47:18.400 --> 47:19.680
you've employed a level of skill

47:19.680 --> 47:21.120
getting to them that means using them

47:21.120 --> 47:22.480
would be a waste of a good hand

47:22.480 --> 47:24.240
you could be keeping another weapon in

47:24.240 --> 47:25.120
or some magic.

47:25.120 --> 47:26.240
Dodging like this would have seemed

47:26.240 --> 47:28.400
like a needless, risky waste of time

47:28.400 --> 47:30.080
to the old me if I had a shield

47:30.080 --> 47:32.160
and could block the damage perfectly well,

47:32.160 --> 47:33.680
but it would have been so slow.

47:33.680 --> 47:35.120
You don't need Dark Souls 2

47:35.120 --> 47:36.560
to teach you to play this way, obviously.

47:36.560 --> 47:37.600
You can figure it out

47:37.600 --> 47:38.720
if you do a lot of practicing

47:38.720 --> 47:40.080
or look up a lot of YouTube videos

47:40.080 --> 47:41.680
or do PvP or whatever,

47:41.680 --> 47:43.520
but being forced to play that way

47:43.520 --> 47:44.480
by the game

47:44.480 --> 47:46.560
makes you learn it so much faster.

47:46.560 --> 47:48.240
Other touches can be seen here, too,

47:48.240 --> 47:49.200
like parrying.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.880
In Dark Souls 1, parrying offered

47:50.880 --> 47:52.480
a brief, clumsy moment

47:52.480 --> 47:53.680
to get in a riposte.

47:53.680 --> 47:55.360
Oh, and you can't even do a riposte

47:55.360 --> 47:57.520
if you're two-handing in Dark Souls 1.

47:57.520 --> 48:00.000
Thanks, fuckers.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.840
The sound effect was satisfying

48:01.840 --> 48:02.880
but hard to make out

48:02.880 --> 48:04.400
if anything else was happening.

48:04.400 --> 48:06.400
The window to respond was short

48:06.400 --> 48:07.680
and the animations that played

48:07.680 --> 48:08.720
where enemies were parried

48:08.720 --> 48:11.040
were often really short and vague.

48:11.040 --> 48:12.720
I didn't parry a lot in Dark Souls 1

48:12.720 --> 48:14.480
because, frankly, I didn't trust the game

48:14.480 --> 48:16.240
enough to let me capitalize on it.

48:16.240 --> 48:18.160
In Dark Souls 2, parrying triggers

48:18.160 --> 48:19.920
a loud, ultra-cool sound.

48:22.720 --> 48:24.880
The enemies fall down in a protracted

48:24.880 --> 48:27.120
dear-god-my-entire-world-is-ending

48:27.120 --> 48:29.280
animation and stay there for ages

48:29.280 --> 48:31.040
while they wait for you to capitalize.

48:31.040 --> 48:33.440
This is, in a word, encouraging.

48:33.440 --> 48:35.440
You feel like you've made a decisive move

48:35.440 --> 48:37.440
and might even have already won.

48:37.440 --> 48:38.720
You feel rewarded for learning

48:38.720 --> 48:40.000
how an enemy attacks.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.680
It's obvious you've pulled it off

48:41.680 --> 48:43.280
and you have plenty of time to react

48:43.280 --> 48:44.640
to knowing you've done it.

48:44.640 --> 48:46.080
I felt, like I said,

48:46.080 --> 48:48.240
encouraged to keep parrying.

48:48.240 --> 48:49.200
Instead of abandoning it

48:49.200 --> 48:50.080
after the early levels,

48:50.080 --> 48:51.120
I only really using it

48:51.120 --> 48:52.720
on heavily choreographed enemies

48:52.720 --> 48:53.840
like I did in 1.

48:53.840 --> 48:55.440
Parrying really only came into its own

48:55.440 --> 48:57.040
in Bloodborne which handed you a weapon

48:57.040 --> 48:58.560
specifically for doing it

48:58.560 --> 49:00.960
and made even monstrous enemies parryable

49:00.960 --> 49:02.160
but this represents a step

49:02.160 --> 49:03.440
in the right direction.

49:03.440 --> 49:05.280
I realized, playing Dark Souls 2,

49:05.280 --> 49:07.040
that the reason it seemed too hard

49:07.040 --> 49:08.640
to get to the level of skill

49:08.640 --> 49:09.920
other people were displaying

49:09.920 --> 49:11.360
was because getting there required

49:11.360 --> 49:13.600
lots of time investment and practice

49:13.600 --> 49:14.640
to get around the fact

49:14.640 --> 49:16.720
the game itself did a pretty bad job

49:16.720 --> 49:18.240
of getting you there by itself.

49:18.240 --> 49:18.880
The phrase,

49:18.880 --> 49:20.720
"'Get good' has been around for ages

49:20.720 --> 49:22.480
but was massively popularized

49:22.480 --> 49:23.680
in the Souls community

49:23.680 --> 49:25.280
and this is because the gulf of skill

49:25.280 --> 49:26.800
is so wide between new

49:26.800 --> 49:28.080
and experienced players

49:28.080 --> 49:29.360
that it's almost impossible

49:29.360 --> 49:31.200
to help someone get on their level,

49:31.200 --> 49:32.960
the only advice being, basically,

49:32.960 --> 49:34.960
to keep playing until they become good

49:34.960 --> 49:35.760
at the game.

49:35.760 --> 49:36.960
No matter how you look at it,

49:36.960 --> 49:38.640
the fact the community has trouble

49:38.640 --> 49:40.400
introducing the game it's built around

49:40.400 --> 49:41.760
to new players

49:41.760 --> 49:43.520
constitutes something of a problem

49:43.520 --> 49:45.440
and this is a problem I feel Dark Souls 2

49:45.440 --> 49:47.200
solves with some very careful changes

49:47.200 --> 49:48.000
in its design.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.040
I said before that I thought

49:49.040 --> 49:50.320
Dark Souls was incredible

49:50.320 --> 49:52.240
but I owe that to DS2

49:52.240 --> 49:54.640
showing me the way to appreciate it properly

49:54.640 --> 49:55.680
and the way to approach it

49:55.680 --> 49:57.520
in a way that was actually really fun.

49:58.080 --> 49:59.520
The blueprint for Bloodborne,

49:59.520 --> 50:01.120
the blood print, if you will,

50:01.120 --> 50:02.880
of a lot of creative decisions,

50:02.880 --> 50:04.400
lies in Dark Souls 2.

50:04.400 --> 50:06.240
I'm unsure if it directly inspired

50:06.240 --> 50:08.000
the attitudes to shields and healing

50:08.000 --> 50:09.680
and level design and so on in Bloodborne

50:09.680 --> 50:10.960
but even if it didn't,

50:10.960 --> 50:12.720
the way Bloodborne seemingly builds

50:12.720 --> 50:13.760
on these ideas for me

50:13.760 --> 50:16.240
shows that 2 was a step in the right direction

50:16.240 --> 50:18.880
even if it didn't get everything right.

50:28.880 --> 50:31.120
Dark Souls 1 is, on a technical level,

50:31.120 --> 50:32.480
interesting and complex.

50:32.480 --> 50:33.920
The opening cinematic explains

50:33.920 --> 50:35.680
the setup of the world of the story.

50:35.680 --> 50:38.000
Gwyn and Co. mess up the ancient dragons,

50:38.000 --> 50:40.400
build a society using the power of the soul,

50:40.400 --> 50:42.560
and people start becoming undead and going mad

50:42.560 --> 50:44.080
and the empire eventually collapses

50:44.080 --> 50:45.280
when the flames start to go out

50:45.280 --> 50:47.040
and Gwyn fucks up trying to fix it.

50:47.040 --> 50:48.320
But what the player actually does

50:48.320 --> 50:50.240
is run around a mostly empty world

50:50.240 --> 50:51.360
killing the people who remain

50:51.360 --> 50:52.880
so they can open a big door.

50:52.880 --> 50:54.720
There isn't much actual interaction

50:54.720 --> 50:56.080
with this story.

50:56.080 --> 50:57.520
The stuff about everlasting dragons

50:57.520 --> 50:58.480
and a war to kill them all

50:58.480 --> 50:59.920
doesn't really have much of an impact

50:59.920 --> 51:00.960
on the story of the player

51:00.960 --> 51:02.240
killing the people who killed them

51:02.240 --> 51:03.360
and nicking their souls.

51:03.360 --> 51:05.600
What the first game excels at is lore.

51:05.600 --> 51:07.440
In the sense that through item descriptions

51:07.440 --> 51:08.400
and chance encounters

51:08.400 --> 51:09.840
with the people who remain in the world

51:09.840 --> 51:11.280
and are safe to talk to,

51:11.280 --> 51:13.840
you can learn little tidbits about them as people.

51:13.840 --> 51:15.040
You can run into a character,

51:15.040 --> 51:16.480
have a brief conversation,

51:16.480 --> 51:18.480
and be sure that if you pay attention to the world

51:18.480 --> 51:20.480
and objects related to them or their people,

51:20.480 --> 51:22.640
you'll learn something about them and their culture.

51:22.640 --> 51:24.320
The closest you get to a story

51:24.320 --> 51:26.240
is a guy saying ring some bells.

51:26.240 --> 51:28.320
There's an old saying in my family.

51:28.320 --> 51:29.840
Fuck your family.

51:29.840 --> 51:31.200
This is the reason for the whole mission.

51:31.200 --> 51:32.400
Like, you meet this guy who's like,

51:32.400 --> 51:35.200
you know, my family have this fucked up stupid belief.

51:35.200 --> 51:37.040
Or another guy saying ring some bells.

51:37.040 --> 51:39.040
Or a serpent saying, hey, Gwyn was cool.

51:39.040 --> 51:40.080
Kill his friends.

51:40.080 --> 51:41.680
Or a different serpent saying,

51:41.680 --> 51:43.040
Gwyn wasn't cool at all.

51:43.040 --> 51:44.320
He was really rude.

51:44.320 --> 51:45.360
Kill his friends.

51:45.360 --> 51:47.040
The fun of the game comes from figuring out

51:47.040 --> 51:49.360
a complete picture of what you can find,

51:49.360 --> 51:51.280
but there isn't really a narrative

51:51.280 --> 51:52.720
happening for most of it.

51:52.720 --> 51:54.400
The player isn't really given a chance

51:54.400 --> 51:57.040
to interact with the important events in this world.

51:57.040 --> 51:58.320
They're just picking up the pieces

51:58.320 --> 51:59.920
of stuff that already happened.

51:59.920 --> 52:01.600
In comparison, to me,

52:01.600 --> 52:04.240
Dark Souls 2 does something really interesting.

52:04.240 --> 52:06.640
You get a cool metaphorical sequence in the opening

52:06.640 --> 52:09.360
where a Darkseid-branded character's family

52:09.360 --> 52:11.520
melts away under the weight of the curse

52:11.520 --> 52:14.080
making you live so long you forget everything.

52:14.080 --> 52:16.080
Already we're given our first proper theme,

52:16.080 --> 52:19.040
and it works on both the personal and world level

52:19.040 --> 52:21.680
in that the world is making less and less sense

52:21.680 --> 52:23.360
because things are falling away,

52:23.360 --> 52:25.440
which, by the way, coincides really well

52:25.440 --> 52:27.440
with the fact the world design is like that.

52:27.440 --> 52:28.880
The story itself, to start with,

52:28.880 --> 52:31.520
is self-consciously a rehash of the previous game.

52:31.520 --> 52:34.080
The Emerald Herald tells you you need to face the king,

52:34.080 --> 52:36.240
and to do that, you need some big souls.

52:36.240 --> 52:38.160
Oh, cool. Thanks. Nice one.

52:38.160 --> 52:39.120
So you do that.

52:39.120 --> 52:40.400
Along the way, you find areas

52:40.400 --> 52:43.680
and bosses strangely evocative of the previous ones.

52:43.680 --> 52:47.840
Nadjka is, shall we say, Quelaag-adjacent.

52:47.840 --> 52:50.640
The gutter is very Blighttown-y, and so on.

52:50.640 --> 52:51.760
There's a lot of parallels,

52:51.760 --> 52:53.360
but it's never quite made clear

52:53.360 --> 52:55.680
that you're explicitly in the same world as Lordran

52:55.680 --> 52:57.760
or at least not the same places.

52:57.760 --> 52:59.840
There's just a subtle thing in the back of your head

52:59.840 --> 53:02.080
about how this all seems oddly familiar.

53:02.080 --> 53:03.200
So you kill all the enemies,

53:03.200 --> 53:05.280
and on the way, there are these occasional locked doors.

53:05.280 --> 53:08.000
There's no explicit sense that you're missing any large areas.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.760
All the paths terminate in dead ends

53:09.760 --> 53:12.480
or weird shrines with the primal bonfires in them.

53:12.480 --> 53:15.120
The game is pretty long just accounting for these four paths.

53:15.120 --> 53:16.560
So when you go to Castle Drangleic,

53:16.560 --> 53:18.560
you get the sense this really is the end game.

53:18.560 --> 53:20.240
You progress all the way through the castle

53:20.240 --> 53:21.280
to the shrine beneath,

53:21.280 --> 53:23.040
and then through the Grave of Saints.

53:23.040 --> 53:24.720
There's a real sense of build-up.

53:24.720 --> 53:25.840
Then you fight Velstadt,

53:25.840 --> 53:27.680
who's guarding the door to Vendrick.

53:27.680 --> 53:28.720
After beating him,

53:28.720 --> 53:31.440
you finally go to meet your presumably final opponent,

53:31.440 --> 53:35.040
the same final opponents you fought in Demon's Souls and Dark Souls 1,

53:35.040 --> 53:37.680
the corrupted king of the world you've been walking through.

53:37.680 --> 53:40.080
But instead, this happens.

54:01.520 --> 54:04.880
Vendrick is a shadow of the man talked about in the lore

54:04.880 --> 54:06.560
and by the characters that remember him.

54:06.560 --> 54:08.480
He, like the fate of the rest of the undead,

54:08.480 --> 54:10.720
like the player's character will eventually become,

54:10.720 --> 54:11.920
has lost his mind.

54:11.920 --> 54:13.760
You don't have to fight Vendrick at all.

54:13.760 --> 54:15.120
He's not your enemy.

54:15.120 --> 54:18.160
He's just a man who lost his way and everything else with it.

54:18.160 --> 54:20.800
It's hard to relate how touching this is.

54:20.800 --> 54:22.880
The game genuinely feels like it was building

54:22.880 --> 54:25.040
to the very final confrontation.

54:25.040 --> 54:27.280
It's a game about a man who's lost his way,

54:27.280 --> 54:29.120
and he's trying to find his way back.

54:29.120 --> 54:31.600
It was building to the very final confrontation.

54:31.600 --> 54:34.160
The room is built to have a dramatic passage down steps

54:34.160 --> 54:35.600
similar to the lead-up to Gwyn,

54:35.600 --> 54:38.240
and it's built so that the camera naturally passes through it

54:38.240 --> 54:40.720
to reveal what Vendrick has become.

54:40.720 --> 54:42.000
I feel bad for spoiling it

54:42.000 --> 54:43.760
for people who haven't experienced the game yet,

54:43.760 --> 54:46.640
but this moment is pivotal to what makes the story interesting.

54:46.640 --> 54:48.960
You're built up for the traditional Souls game encounter

54:48.960 --> 54:50.080
with a fallen king,

54:50.080 --> 54:51.520
and instead you're faced with a thing

54:51.520 --> 54:54.080
to whom it doesn't even occur to fight you anymore,

54:54.080 --> 54:55.920
shambling around almost naked.

54:55.920 --> 54:57.680
You just have to pick up the king's ring,

54:57.680 --> 54:59.120
which unlocks the final areas

54:59.120 --> 55:00.960
and allows you to head to Aldia's keep

55:00.960 --> 55:02.560
and eventually meet the ancient dragon

55:02.560 --> 55:04.480
who's also not interested in fighting you.

55:04.480 --> 55:06.240
He gives you the Ashen Mist Heart,

55:06.240 --> 55:08.560
which lets you journey into the memories of giants

55:08.560 --> 55:10.400
from the old war Vendrick fought.

55:10.400 --> 55:11.920
You get to see a lot of the damage

55:11.920 --> 55:14.000
that you encounter in the main path happening.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.120
It's really neat.

55:15.120 --> 55:17.360
Killing the giant lord lets you face Nashandra,

55:17.360 --> 55:19.280
Vendrick's queen, at the Throne of Want.

55:19.280 --> 55:22.000
Killing her nets you precisely one ending.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.360
Your character sits on the throne,

55:23.360 --> 55:25.200
presumably having become the new king,

55:25.200 --> 55:26.720
and then the credits play.

55:26.720 --> 55:28.400
But instead of resetting the game,

55:28.400 --> 55:29.600
it just carries on.

55:29.600 --> 55:31.040
You're put back in the world.

55:31.040 --> 55:33.040
The game deliberately undercuts its story.

55:33.840 --> 55:34.340
You win,

55:34.960 --> 55:36.080
but what do you win?

55:36.720 --> 55:38.720
Kingship over a dying world?

55:38.720 --> 55:40.320
The chance to sit in a chair?

55:40.960 --> 55:42.160
Only one character in the game

55:42.160 --> 55:44.320
even recognizes you as the new king,

55:44.320 --> 55:46.640
Shal'Kuar, the seemingly immortal cat

55:46.640 --> 55:48.400
who also knows most of the rest of the lore

55:48.400 --> 55:49.680
about the other bosses.

55:49.680 --> 55:50.480
If you want to,

55:50.480 --> 55:52.880
you can use bonfire ascetics to refight old bosses

55:52.880 --> 55:54.640
or refresh enemies if you exhaust them,

55:54.640 --> 55:56.560
or you can completely kill all the NPCs

55:56.560 --> 55:57.760
even the Emerald Herald.

55:57.760 --> 55:59.360
You can make the world of Dark Souls 2

55:59.360 --> 56:02.320
completely empty of people and monsters.

56:02.320 --> 56:04.000
The only way to access New Game Plus

56:04.000 --> 56:05.520
is to sit at a bonfire

56:05.520 --> 56:08.000
and deliberately choose to start it all over again.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.120
I like these choices

56:09.120 --> 56:10.960
because they hammer home the hopelessness

56:10.960 --> 56:13.120
of the Dark Souls story that was there in one,

56:13.120 --> 56:14.480
but undercut by the fact

56:14.480 --> 56:15.760
no matter what ending you got,

56:15.760 --> 56:17.520
you just started at the beginning again.

56:17.520 --> 56:19.680
Dark Souls 2 forces you to contemplate

56:19.680 --> 56:21.120
how little you've really achieved

56:21.120 --> 56:22.320
with all these deaths,

56:22.320 --> 56:24.080
and then forces you to decide

56:24.080 --> 56:25.920
when it's time to do it all again.

56:25.920 --> 56:28.720
Ultimately, Dark Souls 2 is about cycles.

56:28.720 --> 56:30.400
The story is deliberately evocative

56:30.400 --> 56:31.600
of the previous game,

56:31.600 --> 56:33.600
exploring the empire of a king who fell,

56:33.600 --> 56:34.880
but with an explicit focus

56:34.880 --> 56:37.040
on how this has all happened before,

56:37.040 --> 56:38.880
and not just coincidentally.

56:38.880 --> 56:41.440
Perhaps it's something we're doomed to keep doing.

56:41.440 --> 56:42.000
Humanity,

56:42.000 --> 56:44.720
perhaps unable to ever fully escape its own nature,

56:44.720 --> 56:47.200
is repeating its mistakes over and over.

56:47.200 --> 56:49.280
For a game with so much architecture and character

56:49.280 --> 56:50.720
in so many of its designs,

56:50.720 --> 56:53.200
the best piece of imagery is the simplest one,

56:53.200 --> 56:55.120
the symbol of the dark sign.

56:55.120 --> 56:56.800
It's a loop, a circle,

56:56.800 --> 56:58.800
reflecting the way the undead return to life

56:58.800 --> 56:59.840
no matter what,

56:59.840 --> 57:02.160
continuing even after they lose their minds.

57:02.160 --> 57:04.960
Humanity itself is trapped in this loop.

57:04.960 --> 57:06.960
The story is much more for the player

57:06.960 --> 57:08.080
than in the previous game.

57:08.080 --> 57:09.760
It's a story in which the player is expected

57:09.760 --> 57:11.200
to contemplate their own actions

57:11.200 --> 57:12.480
instead of those of others,

57:12.480 --> 57:14.080
and recognize that the problem here

57:14.080 --> 57:16.240
isn't the mistakes of the king or his people,

57:16.240 --> 57:18.480
but that people as a whole were unable to escape

57:18.480 --> 57:20.720
the mistakes that happened in Dark Souls 1.

57:20.720 --> 57:22.640
But what's even better is how it makes sure to tell you

57:22.640 --> 57:24.080
this isn't just one repeat.

57:24.080 --> 57:26.080
No, the story of Dark Souls 1 has happened

57:26.080 --> 57:27.760
maybe countless times,

57:27.760 --> 57:30.960
so many you don't know and will never fully comprehend it.

57:30.960 --> 57:32.800
In a prison cell in the Lost Bastille

57:32.800 --> 57:34.240
is a man made of stone.

57:34.240 --> 57:36.080
If you unfreeze him, he refers to himself

57:36.080 --> 57:37.920
as Straid of Olaphis.

57:37.920 --> 57:40.640
Olaphis was a kingdom where Drangleic now stands,

57:40.640 --> 57:42.400
untold generations ago,

57:42.400 --> 57:45.120
so long ago that no one but Straid

57:45.120 --> 57:46.880
and the descriptions of spells and items

57:46.880 --> 57:49.040
invented by him or belonging to him

57:49.040 --> 57:50.160
even mention it.

57:50.160 --> 57:52.400
In Dark Souls 1, all the various areas and people

57:52.400 --> 57:53.680
and their stories and what happened

57:53.680 --> 57:56.000
can be pieced together quite meticulously.

57:56.000 --> 57:57.440
You can, with enough work,

57:57.440 --> 58:00.240
put together a complete universe out of the facts.

58:00.240 --> 58:03.440
In Dark Souls 2, an entire civilization

58:03.440 --> 58:05.120
can be so utterly lost

58:05.120 --> 58:07.840
that only one man even knows its name.

58:07.840 --> 58:09.840
Who knows how many empires rose and fell

58:09.840 --> 58:11.280
between Olaphis and Drangleic

58:11.280 --> 58:13.200
or Lordran and Drangleic,

58:13.200 --> 58:15.600
but pieces of them lie scattered everywhere,

58:15.600 --> 58:17.520
decayed, colossal wrecks,

58:17.520 --> 58:19.280
each with their own rise to power

58:19.280 --> 58:20.480
and their own mad kings

58:20.480 --> 58:22.800
and their own undead curse rending them apart.

58:22.800 --> 58:25.040
The Forest of Fallen Giants is Vendrick's doing,

58:25.040 --> 58:26.240
but Earthen Peak?

58:26.240 --> 58:27.440
The Old Iron Keep?

58:27.440 --> 58:29.840
These places rose and fell on their own terms.

58:29.840 --> 58:31.680
The DLC, which we'll get to later,

58:31.680 --> 58:33.840
each covers its own completely separate tale

58:33.840 --> 58:35.360
of a kingdom that rose and fell

58:35.360 --> 58:36.800
in roughly the same area.

58:36.800 --> 58:37.920
What's compelling about this

58:37.920 --> 58:39.120
is that it's more bizarre,

58:39.120 --> 58:40.240
more unexplained,

58:40.240 --> 58:41.680
and more human.

58:41.680 --> 58:43.680
People in the Souls universe are victims

58:43.680 --> 58:45.920
of a history they might never be able to learn.

58:45.920 --> 58:48.240
The story is about being lost

58:48.240 --> 58:50.720
in a confusing maze you can never fully understand,

58:50.720 --> 58:52.720
a feeling strengthened by the nightmarish

58:52.880 --> 58:54.480
of the actual physical world.

58:54.480 --> 58:56.640
Quelaag alone was simply a sad story

58:56.640 --> 58:58.560
about a woman transformed into a demon

58:58.560 --> 59:00.480
by an attempt to create more life,

59:00.480 --> 59:02.000
but now she's contextualized

59:02.000 --> 59:04.080
as a victim of a far deeper problem

59:04.080 --> 59:06.080
that mankind is having trouble escaping,

59:06.080 --> 59:07.120
because no matter what,

59:07.120 --> 59:09.600
it seems to keep happening over and over.

59:09.600 --> 59:11.600
Something really cool and kind of subtle

59:11.600 --> 59:13.760
is hidden in the basement of Majula.

59:13.760 --> 59:15.280
Down, hidden in the dirt,

59:15.280 --> 59:17.200
so small not many people notice,

59:17.200 --> 59:18.880
is a small, fractured piece

59:18.880 --> 59:20.800
of the Lordvessel from the first game.

59:20.800 --> 59:21.920
This is the best expression

59:21.920 --> 59:24.320
of what Dark Souls 2 is doing with its story.

59:24.320 --> 59:25.680
It's interested in telling a story

59:25.680 --> 59:27.920
about being unable to fully piece together

59:27.920 --> 59:28.880
what's happening,

59:28.880 --> 59:30.400
as the character loses their minds

59:30.400 --> 59:32.880
in a doomed world of destroyed statues.

59:32.880 --> 59:34.000
Your character doesn't even know

59:34.000 --> 59:35.280
what a Lordvessel is.

59:35.280 --> 59:36.640
To them, this is nothing,

59:36.640 --> 59:38.240
just a thing lying in the dust.

59:38.240 --> 59:40.080
It also represents the developers' attempts

59:40.080 --> 59:41.840
to do their own thing and move on

59:41.840 --> 59:44.160
by reducing an iconic part of the previous game

59:44.160 --> 59:46.080
to a piece of rubble in a basement.

59:46.080 --> 59:47.920
For me, the weakest parts of the previous games

59:47.920 --> 59:49.840
is when I got handed a whole heap of names,

59:49.840 --> 59:51.280
roles, and backstory.

59:51.280 --> 59:52.400
Demon's Souls did this, too,

59:52.400 --> 59:53.680
by just listing a bunch of people

59:53.680 --> 59:54.880
who went into the fog.

59:54.880 --> 59:56.080
I could just find those people

59:56.080 --> 59:57.280
and learn about them manually,

59:57.280 --> 59:58.640
but instead, the first games open

59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.240
with a needless role call

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:02.160
and a story about a fight with dragons

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.760
that doesn't really tell me anything.

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.360
The guys I'm going to kill

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:07.600
killed a bunch of dragons a long time ago,

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.520
and that's important,

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:10.800
because...

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.120
Mmmmmmm.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.280
One flaw in the themes of Dark Souls 1

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:16.880
was for all its criticisms of the world

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:17.840
Gwyn had built,

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:20.480
an awful lot of time was dedicated to his kingdom,

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.000
to exploring its majesty,

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.920
and even when you darken Anor Londo,

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.440
you still find yourself compelled

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.600
to look upon his works and despair.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.200
Dark Souls 2 does the most compelling

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.120
and interesting thing it could possibly do

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.560
with the story of Gwyn,

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:33.680
Lord of Cinder,

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.040
Master of Anor Londo,

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.240
King of Lordran.

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.440
It asks,

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:38.400
who?

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.120
I don't even think he's mentioned by name at all.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.400
Gwyn may well have been a good and mighty king,

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.680
but the lone and level sands stretch far away,

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:49.360
and he is gone.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:52.320
The paranoid king who had Straid petrified is gone,

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:53.920
the king of Lordran is gone,

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.760
and the king of Drangleic is gone,

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:58.640
but his burnt-out husk still walks the earth yet,

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:01.040
and we remember him for now.

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.360
I think a lot of people wanted

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:16.080
a story with the exact type of intricacies

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:17.200
of the previous game.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.880
I can see wanting that

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:21.120
and understand being disappointed,

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:23.360
but I prefer the lonesomeness

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.760
and the unsolvable puzzle you're given

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.160
of a world where the weight of time

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.320
has dissolved away most of history,

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.760
and even the physical world

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.000
twists into itself in impossible ways

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.360
and icy peaks can give way to the flames of chaos.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:40.400
It's maddening and majestic at the same time

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.920
in a way that no concretely designed physical world

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:45.520
can ever be.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:46.800
This is imagery.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.560
This is visual metaphor.

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.480
There's doubtless plenty of theory-crafting

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:51.600
in Souls lore circles

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.680
about who the woman with the spinning wheel is

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.280
when you're told everything you need to know

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.280
in just how she's presented here.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.720
She's deliberately evocative

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.120
of the fortune-telling spirits with spinning wheels

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.800
that exist seemingly throughout

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.720
human mythology and folklore.

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:05.520
More specifically,

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.120
this character appears to be a reference

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:08.880
to one of the most popular portrayals

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.640
of this type of character in film history,

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.640
the one that appears in Akira Kurosawa's

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:13.440
Throne of Blood,

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:15.120
also known as Spider-Web Castle.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:17.360
Throne of Blood is an adaptation of Macbeth.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.200
In case you haven't heard of Macbeth,

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.120
Macbeth's about a happy-go-lucky guy

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.120
whose destiny is to become king,

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.200
but it turns out being the king

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.520
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:34.640
["Spider-Web Castle"]

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:35.680
Interestingly enough,

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:36.720
right before the character

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.720
who's a reference to Spider-Web Castle,

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.480
just to make sure you know they get it,

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:42.240
they've just put a spider right there.

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.440
The appearance of a character

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.280
seemingly straight out of this film,

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.440
a film about the darkness befalling people

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:49.120
whose destiny is to rule,

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.720
is a better piece of storytelling

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.560
than all the item descriptions

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:55.040
and all the loot drops in the world.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.320
But because it relies on

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:57.840
understanding of imagery

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.280
outside of video games

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.280
and visual storytelling,

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:02.800
none of this information can be found

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:05.600
on any wiki about the story of the Souls series.

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:06.560
In a way,

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.000
the story of Dark Souls 2

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.680
is the ultimate in nerd horror.

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:11.440
It tells a story of a universe

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.640
it's impossible to build

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:15.200
a comprehensive fucking wiki about.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.240
And to nerds,

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.400
that's the scariest thing there is.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:19.920
This opening proceeds into

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.840
a series of destroyed castles,

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:22.960
ruined thrones,

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.640
mad, dead kings.

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:26.720
When you finally get your own throne,

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.200
there's a worrying ambivalence to it.

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.200
The best Dark Souls 1 could muster

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.200
was having sad music

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.640
play over the last boss,

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:37.200
and if you look at Jimmy's pants,

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.880
it tells you how bad he was

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.240
when he was a kid.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:41.760
Dark Souls 2 puts you

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.680
into the role of the last boss,

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.280
becoming patriarch of a world

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.880
on its way to its doom,

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:49.280
ultimately failing to achieve anything.

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:52.080
And it asks you how you feel about that

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:53.520
and where you go from here.

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:54.800
The pacing of Dark Souls 1

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.320
wasn't great after the Lordvessel,

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.000
but it did a lot more with a lot less

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.440
when it came to its plot.

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:01.360
Its introductory video set up the world

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:03.440
and the major players very efficiently.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:06.480
Efficient storytelling is being placed over

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.040
good storytelling,

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:11.120
or even a good story.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:12.160
I think gamers on the whole

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.440
are still kind of enamored

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:16.000
with a wikipedia-style approach to storytelling,

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.400
where everything can be concretely pieced together

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.760
in an objective narrative,

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.440
when really I think there's a lot of other ways

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.880
you can explore a story.

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:24.720
The intro video to Dark Souls 2

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.160
shows the main character dropping

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.600
into some kind of whirlpool

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.600
because the old lady tells us we're cursed

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.720
and the only hope of a cure

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.720
is to go to Drangleic for some reason.

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.320
She actually says we'll have no idea

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.200
why we're going to do

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.120
any of the stuff we're about to do.

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:40.640
This visual metaphor for falling into darkness,

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:41.280
you know,

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.760
the thing that going hollow does to your mind,

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.640
is reduced to falling into

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.480
some kind of whirlpool.

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.920
A woman visually coded

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.520
as having the power to see the future,

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.960
predicting a horrible fate

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:53.760
in which we do things

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.520
without fully understanding their purpose

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.040
because we lose our minds,

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.240
is reduced to

01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.520
the old lady

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.960
telling us to go to Drangleic

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:02.480
for some reason.

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.720
No wonder this critical approach to storytelling

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.800
resulted in finding the story lacking.

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.480
No, this is just an old lady

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:09.920
telling us to do things

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.120
for some reason.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.040
There's no nuance or meaning

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:16.320
or cinematic language being utilized here.

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:17.600
That level of understanding

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.520
has no place in my

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.920
nuanced critique of a video game.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:24.320
New Game Plus is the bad ending.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.000
You press a button and admit

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:26.800
that all that's left

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.720
is for everything to happen again.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:29.600
There's another ending,

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.520
which came out when all the DLCs had come out

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.520
and also adds a new character.

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:34.800
I think this aspect of the story

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:35.920
is interesting in its own way,

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:37.280
but I don't like how people use it

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:39.200
as an excuse to criticize Dark Souls 2,

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.720
pretending there wasn't enough story

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:41.600
in the initial release

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:42.800
and this is an admission of that

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:44.400
and they're finally fixing it,

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:45.840
or they're patching the story in

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.120
in post or something.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:48.560
There's plenty of story,

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.640
but just not the kind everyone wanted.

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.080
For me, it was already complete

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:53.520
in its incompleteness,

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:54.800
but giving the player the option

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:55.440
of getting an ending

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:56.480
where they beat another boss

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.320
and walk out is a nice little bonus.

01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:59.520
It's a nice extra little thing

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.800
to give people and that's all right.

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.640
The DLC to Dark Souls 2 is fantastic.

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.160
Each one experiments with mechanics

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.520
in cool and interesting ways

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:10.640
I don't want to get too far into

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:12.320
because we're already pressed for time.

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:13.760
Rest assured they're all lengthy enough

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.120
to feel like worthwhile additions.

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:16.960
I'll rattle off the fun stuff I really liked.

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.640
I like Broom Tower's verticality

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.240
and the way you unlocked more access

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:21.040
from the central hub

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.120
once you got the key wedge thing.

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:24.960
I like Crown of the Old Iron King's gimmick

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:26.000
of having the first boss

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.040
and the Iron King himself

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.640
be just to your left when you come in

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.600
and you can take a series

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:30.720
of looping paths around

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.000
to make the first boss visible

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:32.800
then go around again

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:33.680
once the ice melts

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.040
to gain access to more soldiers

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.320
for the Old Iron King fight.

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:37.920
You could find and build a little army

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:39.120
to help you even out the odds

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.400
and that's really cool.

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:41.840
I like the puzzles that require you

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.680
to actually use a bow to progress.

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.440
The Souls games, when it comes down to it,

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:46.960
are something of an offshoot from Zelda

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.640
and its attempt to bring some honest-to-god

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:50.400
bow-and-arrow puzzles to the game.

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:51.200
It was unexpected,

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.720
but it fit together quite well.

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.920
I like these ghost guys

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:55.840
who look like phantoms you see online.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:56.880
It actually trips you up

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:57.920
when you discover they're real

01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:58.880
and they attack you.

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.080
It makes for a cool fakeout

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:01.040
I just spoiled for you,

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.480
so I hope you already played this bit.

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.400
Sin the Slumbering Dragon is a hard fight,

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.480
but the first really fun fight with a dragon

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:07.760
in basically any of these games

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:08.640
for me personally,

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.760
especially after the optional

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:10.800
Ancient Dragon fight

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.160
which is honestly a chore.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.600
In many ways, the DLC embodies

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:15.040
Dark Souls 2 in microcosm,

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.160
being willing to go all the way

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:17.600
and experimenting with its mechanics

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.120
to create new and unique areas,

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:19.840
and in doing so,

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:20.960
it also comes to embody

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.400
the very best the Souls series

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.840
has to offer as a whole.

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:26.800
It's everything that I think I ever wanted

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:27.840
from a Souls game,

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:30.480
and it's part of Dark Souls 2,

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:32.000
so Dark Souls 2 wins.

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.120
Scholar of the First Sin is a second edition

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.320
of Dark Souls 2 that came out

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.680
nearly two years ago now.

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:39.120
It bundled together the DLCs

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.400
for the original release of the game,

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.400
had some graphical and performance updates,

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.640
and put the items that grant access to the DLC

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.680
in the world itself

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:46.560
as things to find

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.160
instead of items you simply start with

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.200
if you owned the DLC

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.240
in the previous version.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:51.920
This version's really interesting.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:52.880
I'm not going to say good,

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:53.680
interesting.

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:54.560
Instead of a simple,

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.320
slightly visually improved bundle,

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.600
it actually dramatically changes

01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:58.560
most of the game.

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.000
Almost all of the enemy encounters

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.120
and placements have been altered,

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:02.080
and the amount of enemies

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:03.680
has overall increased massively.

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.360
I've played Dark Souls 2 multiple times

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:06.400
before playing this version,

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:07.680
and I found it to be very different

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:08.560
and much harder

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:10.640
despite superficially being the same game.

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:12.000
It's more frustrating too.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:12.960
A lot of people didn't like

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:13.600
the amount of enemies

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:15.280
you often fight at once in Dark Souls 2,

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:16.480
something I didn't have a problem with

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.360
in that game,

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:18.880
but in this it's definitely difficult

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:19.760
enough to be annoying

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:20.800
even if you know how to deal

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.000
with groups in this engine.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:22.560
Honestly,

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.640
the game this reminds me of the most

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.640
is Super Mario Bros. 2.

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:27.840
The Japanese Mario 2

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:30.160
is like an optional harder Mario game,

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:30.960
pushing the engine

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:32.160
and player skill requirements

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:33.520
to the absolute limit

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:34.880
before it becomes unsellable

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.240
as a consumer product.

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:36.560
Heck,

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:37.840
they didn't even bother selling it

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:39.040
in the West for a reason.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.120
I'd call Scholar a pretty good game.

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:41.840
It's challenging,

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.520
it's entertainingly funny in places,

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.280
and it's a nice way of playing a game

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:45.920
I love dearly

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:47.680
in a new, remixed way.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:48.400
However,

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:50.160
I have to qualify calling it good.

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.760
It's good only within

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:53.520
the context of Dark Souls 2

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:54.800
already existing,

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:55.920
of there being about a year

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:57.200
of playing the original version

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.480
to prepare for this one.

01:08:58.480 --> 01:08:59.760
I would not recommend this game

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:01.840
to anyone as a first game in the series,

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:02.640
which for some people

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.480
this might have saddeningly been.

01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:06.000
It's for people who are diehard fans

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:06.880
of the series already

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.960
or even just fans of 2 specifically,

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:09.920
and for those people,

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.040
even when it's not fun,

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.400
it's fun as an entertaining

01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:13.360
little experiment

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:14.720
with a bunch of aspects of the game

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:15.920
tweaked just enough.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.520
It feels almost like a ROM hack

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:18.400
of Dark Souls 2

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:19.520
they made for fun,

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:20.160
and for some people

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.440
that might be a condemnation,

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:22.240
especially considering

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:23.760
it's the cost of a full-priced game.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.360
So I can't heartily recommend it,

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:26.800
but the Soul games are quite difficult

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.000
to recommend already.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.200
Something I like specifically

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.560
is the entrance to the Earthen Peak

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:31.520
from Harvest Valley.

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:32.400
There's a couple of enemies

01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:33.040
in the original,

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.280
but it seems quite underutilized,

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:36.720
like it's a short, quick rush

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:37.520
through an area that could be

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:38.640
more fleshed out.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:39.200
In Scholar,

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:40.560
it's significantly altered.

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:41.680
There's way more enemies,

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:42.880
it's way more difficult,

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.160
there's purposeful traps

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.680
for if you try and run past,

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.960
and it has more enemy types

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:47.760
that appear in, like,

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:49.280
two places in the original game,

01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:50.080
which is nice.

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:50.880
There are also more

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.000
Hidey Nights in general,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:52.640
which is great

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:53.920
and something I wanted,

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:55.120
and also they're way more aggressive.

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:55.760
Some of them get up

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:56.800
and go for you now,

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:57.840
and that's a really cool thing

01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.040
that you just don't expect

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.160
if you play the original,

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.760
and that's really, really fun.

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:02.800
Also, something I quite like

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:03.600
about both games

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:04.960
is that in each one,

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:06.160
someone's credentials

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.440
are called into question.

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.160
In the original,

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:09.280
in Hidey's Tower,

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.240
the Dragon Rider looked

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:11.040
like an idiot.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:11.920
There were no dragons

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.120
anywhere for most of the game.

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.800
Why is he called the Dragon Rider?

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:15.360
What?

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.160
That's ridiculous.

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.600
The guy's obviously lying.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:19.040
But in Scholar,

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:20.480
it's the Dragon Slayer

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:21.600
just over the way from him

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:23.200
who's clearly lying on his resume.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.320
There's a dragon right outside

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.200
his fucking office!

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:27.360
Don't get the Scholar edition

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:28.400
unless you similarly

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.080
really like two already

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:30.960
and don't approach it

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.080
as its own game per se,

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:33.120
but as another way

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:33.920
of playing a game

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.720
you already liked

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:35.840
for what it was doing,

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:36.720
and you'll probably

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:37.600
have a good time.

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.400
I honestly want to see

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.440
more games like this.

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:40.080
I would have liked

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:40.880
a similar edition

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:41.600
along these lines

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:42.560
for every Souls game,

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:43.120
to be honest.

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:47.360
Wait, wait.

01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:48.080
Hold on a second.

01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:56.880
Obviously,

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.160
a lot of game criticism

01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.920
is based on subjective experience,

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:00.960
which can't exactly

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.240
be proven wrong,

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.120
sadly,

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:03.760
but that's not what

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:04.960
I'm trying to do here.

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:05.920
My aim as a critic

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:07.280
isn't just to try and find ways

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:09.040
of looking at and analyzing games

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:09.680
and their design

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:10.400
that are useful

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.200
and help in forming

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.640
better ideas of quality,

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.480
but also to try and understand

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:15.600
and explain why

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.680
other people reacted differently.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:18.720
I've had some pushback

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.680
from people on some of my

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:21.280
long game analysis videos,

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:22.480
usually by people who enjoyed

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:23.920
a game I was being critical about

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:25.600
or didn't enjoy a game I liked

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:26.480
or who played the game

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:27.600
a way I said was wrong

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:28.720
and happened to like it.

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:30.320
I in no way mean to diminish

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:31.440
other people's experiences

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.080
of a game.

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:33.200
If you didn't like something,

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.240
I can't reason you

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:35.200
into liking it.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.320
My aim is to understand

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:37.440
why people do or don't

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.080
like something

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:38.960
and learn from that

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:40.000
and use the information

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:40.640
in my work.

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:41.440
I've gone on record

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:42.480
as thinking the Souls games

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:43.520
are all very good,

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:44.240
but that doesn't make

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:45.680
other people not liking them

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:47.360
or not thinking that wrong.

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.560
They're useful because

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:49.680
you learn why people

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:50.800
wouldn't enjoy something,

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:51.840
and that's really helpful

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:52.960
if you, for example,

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.000
are interested in what makes

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.760
a game fun to a lot of people,

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.520
which is really financially

01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:59.040
lucrative nowadays.

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.160
I feel the games got better

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:01.440
at correcting the sort of problems

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:02.800
that caused not a lot of people

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:04.080
to enjoy them early on,

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.600
at least without a lot of friction

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:06.240
at the start,

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:07.600
and somewhat interestingly,

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:08.400
helped them go back

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.160
and appreciate the previous ones.

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.040
Everyone's entitled

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.160
to their opinion,

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:13.120
and in my opinion,

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:15.040
every other game critic

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.080
is stupid.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:20.160
Okay, I can't even

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:21.200
make that joke here.

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:21.920
You see,

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:22.800
the overly negative

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:23.600
critical response

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:24.720
from Souls diehards

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.000
and some spheres of the internet

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:26.800
isn't even accurate

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.320
to what most game critics said

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.840
when the game first came out.

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:30.560
On the whole,

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:31.600
people loved it.

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.360
The misgivings came specifically

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.040
from folks like Matthew Matosis

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:36.480
and the popularity of his video

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:37.440
predicated centrally

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:38.720
on how the game couldn't possibly

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:39.600
be as good as the first

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:40.960
because Miyazaki didn't make it

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:42.560
and locking on in some fights

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:43.440
isn't a good idea

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:44.560
and the opening cutscene

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.520
didn't talk about a war

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.560
that already happened

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:47.680
and has no effect on us

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:48.720
as a player.

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:49.520
Ignore how,

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:50.640
in Dark Souls 2,

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:51.920
there's a similar ancient war

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:52.960
in the distant past,

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:54.240
but you get to learn about it

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:55.280
over the course of the game

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.800
instead of a pre-rendered cutscene

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:57.600
at the beginning,

01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:58.880
and then you get to actually

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:00.080
go fight in it?!

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:01.440
Critics at the time of release

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.480
liked it a lot,

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:03.280
the exact same way

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.640
critics liked Demon's Souls

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:05.920
a lot back when this whole series

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:06.720
was new and strange

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:07.680
and not many people played

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:08.640
or liked it.

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.080
People who think about games a lot

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.280
are more likely to easily

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.560
get into a new experience

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.600
than people who just play them

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:14.320
as a hobby.

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:15.600
Internet critics like Yahtzee

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:16.320
wiped their ass

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:17.440
all over various aspects

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:17.840
of the games

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:18.640
that would later say

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:19.920
they loved when audiences

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.280
started to get a hang of the games

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:21.840
and it turned out

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:23.440
they were talking bollocks.

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:24.720
Fuck you, Demon's Souls.

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:25.840
A challenge is one thing,

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:26.720
but trying to break down

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:27.600
a fucking cement wall

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.240
with your forehead

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:28.800
isn't a challenge,

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:29.680
it's grounds for getting

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:30.800
fucking sectioned.

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:31.920
Demon's Souls is one of the most

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.280
rewarding, challenging games

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.720
ever to hit the PS3.

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:35.840
It may not be for everyone,

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.040
but I still urge everyone

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.240
to at least try it.

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.080
And GameSpot's 2009 game

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:40.720
of the year is...

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:43.680
Demon's Souls.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.280
Demon's Souls is like

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:46.480
nothing you've ever played.

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:48.560
Do you hear that?

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:49.920
It was the best

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:51.120
and most innovative game

01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:52.000
of 2009.

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:55.920
That's Kevin Van Flipping Ord.

01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.440
That's the thought criminal

01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:58.320
who was so wrong

01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:59.360
about Fallout 3

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:00.240
he was found dead

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:01.680
in his cell last year

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:02.720
next to an apology

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.560
written in my blood.

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.680
Even he has been

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:06.640
on the ground floor

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:07.680
of the Souls series

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:08.880
since day one.

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:09.760
It turns out that

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:10.960
professional game critics

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:11.680
are quite often

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:12.800
more ahead of the curb

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:14.000
than the average consumer

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.760
or the not-to-be-rude

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:16.720
fanboy types

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.000
who will dismiss a sequel

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:18.960
for being too different

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:19.840
to the one they first

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:20.880
fell in love with.

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.160
Mainstream game critics

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.200
can be wrong,

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:24.640
but they've been consistently

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.000
right about the Souls series

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.360
from day one.

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.800
It's only corners of the internet

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.720
full of rose-tinted fanboyishness

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.080
towards the first Dark Souls

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:33.680
that result in the ridiculous

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:35.200
treatment of the second game.

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.400
When it comes down to it,

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.600
Dark Souls was

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:38.720
a fantastic game,

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:39.520
even though it's flawed

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:40.160
in a lot of ways

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:41.280
that are so much more obvious

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:42.240
now than ever.

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:43.600
I think the sheer surprise

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:45.040
of how good Dark Souls was

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:45.760
after most people

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.280
missed the boat on Demon's Souls

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:48.720
made it a hard act to follow

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:49.760
and lots of fans got

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.920
unrealistic expectations about it.

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.680
The online response to Dark Souls 3

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.040
sounds overall lukewarm

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:55.920
but positive,

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.200
and I think that might be because

01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:59.360
at least in regards to this one series,

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:00.800
maybe not a couple others,

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:01.680
people have cooled

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:02.640
and learned to manage

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:03.920
their expectations.

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:04.960
I'm interested in finally

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:05.520
getting to play it

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:06.560
after working for so long

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:07.600
on videos about the games

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:08.400
that preceded it.

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.120
I'm a little worried

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:10.000
that the fan reaction

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:10.960
to some aspects of 2

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:11.920
made them walk back

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:12.720
on the good ideas

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:13.840
in an effort to be more like

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:14.640
the first one,

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:15.600
but I'm gonna play it

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:16.800
and judge it on its own merits

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:17.520
as its own game

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:19.120
before I really consider that.

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.400
In the meantime,

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.240
Dark Souls 2 is not perfect,

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:22.880
but you can have

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:24.240
a grand old time with it.

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:25.200
The gameplay contains

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:26.320
some of the tightest moments

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.520
in the whole series

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:29.120
and some really fun variations

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:30.080
on the formula.

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:30.880
It tells a story

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:31.920
that instead of redoing

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:32.560
the original

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:33.520
or trying to build on it

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:34.880
in a straightforward way,

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:36.160
self-consciously explores

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.280
what it means to exist

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:38.480
in a specific position

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:39.760
in gaming culture

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:40.560
and asks us

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:41.680
what the things we desire

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:42.480
from games

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:43.680
say about us.

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:45.520
I really enjoyed Dark Souls 2,

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:46.800
and I think there's a lot of things

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:47.680
that make it good,

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:49.120
and if you didn't enjoy it,

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:50.160
that's okay.

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:51.200
Your different opinions

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:52.000
and experiences

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.040
are equally as valid,

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.000
and I know I talk

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.360
authoritatively sometimes,

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:56.480
but I hope it's clear

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:57.600
I'm just offering my opinion

01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:58.880
in a way I think is interesting

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:00.080
or convincing,

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:02.320
and it's okay to disagree with me.

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:03.120
For now.

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:16.720
Thanks so much for watching

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:18.000
this really long addendum

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.920
to a super long video.

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:21.120
Making this kind of criticism

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.400
takes a ridiculous amount

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:23.440
of time and effort,

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:24.320
and it always takes

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:24.960
so much longer

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:26.080
than I think it will,

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.360

If you've made it this far,

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:16.480
you either listened to the credits like a true believer,

01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:19.840
or guessed correctly I'd put something after the credits and skipped ahead,

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.120
like a meanie.
