00:00.000 --> 00:05.500
Now I know what you all want. You want me to cut to a shot of David Serrini saying something stupid.

00:08.500 --> 00:11.500
So yes, white genocide is a thing that's going on right now.

00:11.500 --> 00:14.500
And if you haven't noticed it yet, it's because you haven't opened your eyes.

00:14.500 --> 00:16.500
No, I haven't!

00:19.500 --> 00:21.500
I just swallowed my gum.

00:22.500 --> 00:26.500
But that actually wouldn't be fair, because he didn't do a video review of The Force Awakens.

00:26.500 --> 00:29.500
Instead, he wrote one for his website.

00:29.500 --> 00:33.500
A website that shills for, no joke, testosterone cream.

00:33.500 --> 00:38.000
The one thing David Serrini definitely does understand is his core demographic.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Obviously, this is a move I agree with. Not the cream, the written review, since

00:42.000 --> 00:45.500
writing something ahead of time gives you a chance to think more about what you're saying,

00:45.500 --> 00:48.000
so you're not just blurting out nonsense.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
Although even with a script, not everyone can get that right.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
The pre-sexual fantasies of a broken boy.

00:55.500 --> 01:00.500
Oh god, this is gonna be great.

01:00.500 --> 01:04.500
Listen up, white man. JJ Abrams hates you.

01:04.500 --> 01:11.000
He relishes the thought of your extinction as he looks forward to a multi-culti-matriarchy

01:11.000 --> 01:18.500
where instead of studying math and sciences, everyone sits around discussing their feelings.

01:18.500 --> 01:21.500
Why specifically is it JJ Abrams who hates me?

01:21.500 --> 01:26.000
You know, he co-wrote the script, along with returning Star Wars writer Lawrence Kasdan

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
and Michael Arndt.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
Does that mean that the writing is fine, but the direction of the film specifically hates white men?

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
Paying money to see his film is the equivalent of auto-gastration.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
It's literally the same thing as cutting off your balls.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
So that's what all the cream is for.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
He also refers to Finn as Mace Dindu, and apparently had to Google the name

01:50.000 --> 01:52.500
of one of the main characters in a film he's analysing.

01:52.500 --> 01:57.500
Davis is part of the proud, several-month-old tradition in the men's rights movement

01:57.500 --> 02:02.500
where you pretend to be fucking stupid and incapable of remembering people's names for attention.

02:02.500 --> 02:10.000
When, um, when the girl meets the black dude, the co-main star of the movie.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
This is because looking like you don't know anything about what you're talking about

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
only makes your review more convincing.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Matt Zoller-Zeitz is far too informed.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
I prefer it when critics forget large portions of the film.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Take the red pill, like in The Matrix.

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
Remember the scene where the, uh, the, the, the black guy offers John Matrix the pills?

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Did I mention that all lives matter?

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
Towards the end, the only reason he finally nuts up and fights not-Darth Vader

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
is because he got the scent feminist Skywalker's white pussy into his nose.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
What? Hey, hang on.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
They must have cut that part out for the version screened in the UK.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I don't remember anything like that.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
At this point in his review, I was thinking,

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
I'm pleasantly surprised Davis is making genuine effort to actually talk about the content of the film

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
to a certain degree and not spew too much of a neo-reactionary manifesto.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
But then I scrolled down...

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
Feminist Skywalker, on the other hand, came out of the womb already an expert on everything.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
The blame for this Star War can be assigned entirely to his dick.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
This entire film is metaphorical for affirmative action.

03:23.000 --> 03:30.000
Women in today's society graduate high school endowed with physical female hiring quotas,

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
failed at school, broke the law, gave birth to a bastard.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
Meanwhile, the boys who were raised beside her have been deliberately held back.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
They are presumed rapists from birth.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
That civilization is a result of men's labor.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
Feminists have never, and will never, accomplish anything of worth

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
because they reject the masculine principle.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
The women of the greatest accomplishments are those who submitted.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
The women who believed...

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Oh my god.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
Women bleed on the birthing bed while men bleed on the battlefield.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
That is the nature of the species man.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
It is women who have trouble keeping it in their pants,

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
and yet we're supposed to believe that men are the ones who think with their little heads.

04:18.000 --> 04:25.000
This world of gender fluidity sells itself as freedom, but it is anything but.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
You'd think that with the advantage of writing the article in advance

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
and decades of having to think and breathe on Earth,

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Davis would have been able to remind himself to stay on point,

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
but like in his videos about Star Trek and feminism, and also maybe slightly Marxists,

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
he's just using a Star Wars review as an excuse to talk about how society is all thanks to men.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Not men like him, obviously.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
I'm pretty sure George Washington never farted and shitted all over the social media

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
He even revels in not knowing the main characters' names.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
So, I guess if you're into purposeful ignorance, this is the review for you.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
For everyone else, though, it's garbage.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Nilpoise. Nil...po...po...uh...po...

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Keimpokta!

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
Interestingly enough, the name Keimpokta is a name that's been around for a long time.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
It's a name that's been around for a long time, but it's not a name that's been around for a long time.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
It's a name that's been around for a long time, but it's not a name that's been around for a long time.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Keimpokta!

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
Interestingly enough, masculinity-praising website Return of Kings,

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
authors of such amazing articles as How Not to Get Raped,

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
and Wow! They Cast a Black Woman to Play Hermione in a Harry Potter Play,

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
have written an article about how terrible this film is.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I bet it's great.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Let's read it and see how reasonable it is.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Right after I've had a quick snack.

05:46.000 --> 05:59.000
Oh, it's horrid. It's actually just terrible.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
And that's not even a joke.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
I'm gonna go wash my mouth.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
Oh, uh, spoilers, it's literally all the same

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
weak-ass criticisms we've seen before.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Sorry.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
I mean, Rey beat an idiot kid with a homemade lightsaber,

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
and Luke lost to the fucking Chosen One, the greatest Jedi of all time,

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
so that comparison's totally reasonable, right?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Okay, it's a dumb article, you get the point.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
But even better, they then published another one,

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
detailing how their reporting cost Star Wars $4.2 million.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
What an astounding figure.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
I mean, Disney wipes their fucking ass with million-dollar bills, but still.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
How did they arrive at that amazing figure, you ask?

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Easy!

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
They held a poll of their readers,

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
asking if their reporting affected their decision to see the film,

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
took the amount of users visiting their site in a month,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
figured out how much that would be in film tickets,

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
and divided that by the people who said yes.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Just do the math!

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Let's look at that poll again.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
How many people took part?

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Um, any statistician worth their salt

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
will tell you that a poll of 565 people

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
will not accurately reflect the opinions of 900,000 users.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Not even unique users, by the way,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
so a bunch of these users will just be the same people

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
accessing the site at different times of day,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
and a bunch of them would have been, for example, me,

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
laughing at these fucking hilarious articles,

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
with my ad blocker turned on, by the way.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Also, I couldn't help but notice that the question isn't

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
did our reporting make you not see it?

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
It just said did it affect your decision to see it,

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
which doesn't really mean anything.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Seeing the idiots on Return O' Kings

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
rant about how a black stormtrooper is ruining Star Wars

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
because something-something Ayn Rand white genocide

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
did affect my decision, too. It made me want to see it more.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
Also, if you think Trey J. Abrams is a good enough director

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
to single-handedly bring about the end of white people with his stories,

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
you do realize you're paying him a compliment, right?

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
You really have to wonder why so many right-wing conservative types

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
have problems with The Force Awakens.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
I'm beginning to think it's something to do with the black-clad fascists

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
who rant about degenerates and who try to commit genocide getting stopped.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
Okay, I could literally talk about other people's opinions of Star Wars forever,

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
and in fact, I plan on arguing with people about Star Wars

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
for the rest of my natural life.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
I like the prequels, and I will fight you!

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
But for now, let's finish up with this.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
It's an image macro one of the 4chan-type sites came up with

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
detailing a shocking conspiracy.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
The white female audience is conditioned to identify with the female

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
with her cuck staff shaped like a large black member

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
grasped at hand at all times.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
They must be conditioned to become attracted to the black male lead.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
This is a censored version, by the way.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
The original was punctuated with loads of shots of white women

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
having a lovely time with black penises.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Whoever made this image was very, very afraid of a future

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
where white women don't pay attention to him,

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
but also had a lot of these images on hand ready to use.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
I guess I'll have to compliment the anonymous author on their preparedness?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Let's go with that.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
Who is the white male audience supposed to identify with?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Simple.

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
The little white cuck ball.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I thought this part of the image was from the censorship,

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
but it's actually in the original, too.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
This is the fate of the white man in the West.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
Okay, the worst thing is BB-8 is actually the only Star Wars character

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
I've ever wanted to cosplay.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
It's working!

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
The feminists have got me!

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Help!

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
It hurts to do that voice.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Oh, I'm not going to re-record that part.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Fuck you.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
In conclusion, social justice warriors, or third-wave feminists,

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
or whatever buzzword you decide to call them this week,

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
are useless non-creatives who will never amount to anything

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
and just whine ineffectually about things they don't like.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
And the only way to stop them is to whine about them

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
even more ineffectually, which will cause them to melt.

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
Now, when I first saw this image, I assumed it was a joke or a parody.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
I mean, how ridiculous is it?

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
The assertion that there's a coded conspiracy to teach women

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
to find black people attractive and diminish the power of the white man.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
But then I realized I've heard that somewhere before.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Remember this video?

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
Yeah, the one I showed you out of context at the beginning?

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
It's a video about cuckoldery and how Davis sees imagery of cuckoldery everywhere,

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
and this is somehow everyone else's fault but his.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
Constantly streaming through advertisements, through public events,

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
are these images of cuckoldery.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
The most obvious ones being, of course, the interracial cuckoldery.

10:36.000 --> 10:43.000
But even ignoring that, you will find a lot of cuckold themes throughout the media.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
It's being indoctrinated into our culture.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
It would be rude of me not to explain what Davis meant by genocide,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
so I thought I'd go back to it at the end.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
In his opinion, the media's full of images designed to make it seem okay

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
for women to cheat on their lovers with non-white people

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
and thus destroy them by way of breeding them out.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
And it's fully within the UN definition of genocide

11:05.000 --> 11:12.000
to try and destroy a race of people through genetic dilution.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
The media is teaching us to stop breeding properly.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
The media's trying to kill white people.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
He's deadly serious.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
He invokes the UN definition of genocide.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
Well, he misuses it, but he tries to invoke it.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
Star Wars, for Davis, is just another head on a hydra

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
trying to destroy his beloved white people.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
Davis is quick in his videos to assert that he's not racist,

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
that racism is just a buzzword thrown around to try and censor him,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
and that he just likes white people a lot,

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
and calling black people by the n-word is actually a sign of mutual respect.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
But in the comments of his review,

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
he makes the claim that predominantly black areas have more crime

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
not because of complicated social or economic factors,

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
but simply because blacks are less capable of being civilized, or something.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
That's why I bothered to talk about the 4chan macro.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
It's stupid, but it reflects the genuine beliefs

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
on display by the alternative right on the internet.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Davis is fun to laugh at.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I'm probably his biggest fan.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
But eventually, if you start to really think about what he's saying,

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
and try to humor him by taking him seriously,

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
it stops being funny, and it starts being sad.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
Davis is someone who clearly puts a lot of thought into what he professes,

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
and he might even have a modicum of actual education on some subjects.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Yet, what he comes up with, in all seriousness,

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
is completely indistinguishable from an image macro

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
that is itself almost impossible to discern from parody.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
Davis got a nice bump in viewership, thanks to Gamergate,

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
a movement co-opted and manipulated from the start

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
by predominantly right-wing and libertarian ideologies for their own benefit,

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
but he's hemorrhaged most of them in the past year or so.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
It's not difficult to see why.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
Oddly enough, there's a film series that's above these petty politics.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
It's called Star Wars. You might have heard of it.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
In it, mankind just sort of...

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
is kind of nice to itself.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
You know, it doesn't ever really come up

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
what gender or ethnicity a character is.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
There's still murder, there's still death, there's still genocide,

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
but it's always for ideals or for class reasons.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
We've managed to move beyond race as an issue at all,

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
and for a film series that's literally about war,

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
that's bizarrely utopian,

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
and I can't help but agree with that.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
It's science fiction, it's basically fantasy,

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
but I think there's a good message there,

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
something that you can believe in.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Brothers, sisters,

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
beneath the sky, there is one family.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Nothing really divides us.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
It's all an illusion clouding our judgment.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
We are all one people,

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
and I don't think there's anything we can't achieve.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
And I live for the day, that bright, shining day in the future,

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
when as one race, as one species,

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
we can kill those fucking space fish!

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
I'd like to say a very big thank you to all of my supporters on Patreon,

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
everyone you just saw before in the credits,

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
but an extra special thanks to Alexander Corbett and Heshy Lifeson.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
I couldn't have done it without you.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
Those Star Wars Pez dispensers were like 99 pence each on eBay.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
It was a nightmare.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
Luckily, I found a place that sold them local, and I stole them.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
For those of you interested in patronizing me,

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
and helping me consume more than just coffee and apples,

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
I'll have you know that a $2 donation will give you access

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
to all the weird bonus stuff I cut out of videos for time,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
and because I've decided it's a little bit too experimental.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
I would genuinely appreciate any donation.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
I haven't been able to afford new pajamas in like a decade.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
This stuff's starting to tear.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
I actually have to wear my normal clothes over this.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
It won't come off anymore.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Anyway, thanks a lot to my patrons.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
I really do need the money.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
As you can tell, I have a lot of mouths to feed.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Ah! Jesus!

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
I need to cut your claws. That fucking hurts.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Ah!

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
I really regret trying to get the cat to pose with me in that shot.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
He's looking himself in the corner now.
