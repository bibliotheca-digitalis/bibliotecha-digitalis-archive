1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Now I know what you all want. You want me to cut to a shot of David Serrini saying something stupid.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,500
So yes, white genocide is a thing that's going on right now.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,500
And if you haven't noticed it yet, it's because you haven't opened your eyes.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,500
No, I haven't!

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,500
I just swallowed my gum.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,500
But that actually wouldn't be fair, because he didn't do a video review of The Force Awakens.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Instead, he wrote one for his website.

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,500
A website that shills for, no joke, testosterone cream.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,000
The one thing David Serrini definitely does understand is his core demographic.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Obviously, this is a move I agree with. Not the cream, the written review, since

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,500
writing something ahead of time gives you a chance to think more about what you're saying,

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,000
so you're not just blurting out nonsense.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Although even with a script, not everyone can get that right.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The pre-sexual fantasies of a broken boy.

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Oh god, this is gonna be great.

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,500
Listen up, white man. JJ Abrams hates you.

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:11,000
He relishes the thought of your extinction as he looks forward to a multi-culti-matriarchy

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,500
where instead of studying math and sciences, everyone sits around discussing their feelings.

19
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,500
Why specifically is it JJ Abrams who hates me?

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,000
You know, he co-wrote the script, along with returning Star Wars writer Lawrence Kasdan

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and Michael Arndt.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Does that mean that the writing is fine, but the direction of the film specifically hates white men?

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Paying money to see his film is the equivalent of auto-gastration.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's literally the same thing as cutting off your balls.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So that's what all the cream is for.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He also refers to Finn as Mace Dindu, and apparently had to Google the name

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,500
of one of the main characters in a film he's analysing.

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Davis is part of the proud, several-month-old tradition in the men's rights movement

29
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,500
where you pretend to be fucking stupid and incapable of remembering people's names for attention.

30
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:10,000
When, um, when the girl meets the black dude, the co-main star of the movie.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
This is because looking like you don't know anything about what you're talking about

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
only makes your review more convincing.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Matt Zoller-Zeitz is far too informed.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I prefer it when critics forget large portions of the film.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Take the red pill, like in The Matrix.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Remember the scene where the, uh, the, the, the black guy offers John Matrix the pills?

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Did I mention that all lives matter?

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Towards the end, the only reason he finally nuts up and fights not-Darth Vader

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
is because he got the scent feminist Skywalker's white pussy into his nose.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What? Hey, hang on.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
They must have cut that part out for the version screened in the UK.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I don't remember anything like that.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
At this point in his review, I was thinking,

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm pleasantly surprised Davis is making genuine effort to actually talk about the content of the film

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
to a certain degree and not spew too much of a neo-reactionary manifesto.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But then I scrolled down...

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Feminist Skywalker, on the other hand, came out of the womb already an expert on everything.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The blame for this Star War can be assigned entirely to his dick.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This entire film is metaphorical for affirmative action.

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Women in today's society graduate high school endowed with physical female hiring quotas,

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
failed at school, broke the law, gave birth to a bastard.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Meanwhile, the boys who were raised beside her have been deliberately held back.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
They are presumed rapists from birth.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That civilization is a result of men's labor.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Feminists have never, and will never, accomplish anything of worth

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
because they reject the masculine principle.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The women of the greatest accomplishments are those who submitted.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The women who believed...

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Oh my god.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Women bleed on the birthing bed while men bleed on the battlefield.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That is the nature of the species man.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It is women who have trouble keeping it in their pants,

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and yet we're supposed to believe that men are the ones who think with their little heads.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This world of gender fluidity sells itself as freedom, but it is anything but.

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You'd think that with the advantage of writing the article in advance

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and decades of having to think and breathe on Earth,

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Davis would have been able to remind himself to stay on point,

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
but like in his videos about Star Trek and feminism, and also maybe slightly Marxists,

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
he's just using a Star Wars review as an excuse to talk about how society is all thanks to men.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Not men like him, obviously.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm pretty sure George Washington never farted and shitted all over the social media

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He even revels in not knowing the main characters' names.

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So, I guess if you're into purposeful ignorance, this is the review for you.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
For everyone else, though, it's garbage.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Nilpoise. Nil...po...po...uh...po...

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Keimpokta!

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Interestingly enough, the name Keimpokta is a name that's been around for a long time.

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's a name that's been around for a long time, but it's not a name that's been around for a long time.

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's a name that's been around for a long time, but it's not a name that's been around for a long time.

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Keimpokta!

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Interestingly enough, masculinity-praising website Return of Kings,

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
authors of such amazing articles as How Not to Get Raped,

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and Wow! They Cast a Black Woman to Play Hermione in a Harry Potter Play,

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
have written an article about how terrible this film is.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I bet it's great.

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Let's read it and see how reasonable it is.

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Right after I've had a quick snack.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh, it's horrid. It's actually just terrible.

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And that's not even a joke.

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm gonna go wash my mouth.

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Oh, uh, spoilers, it's literally all the same

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
weak-ass criticisms we've seen before.

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Sorry.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I mean, Rey beat an idiot kid with a homemade lightsaber,

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and Luke lost to the fucking Chosen One, the greatest Jedi of all time,

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
so that comparison's totally reasonable, right?

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Okay, it's a dumb article, you get the point.

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But even better, they then published another one,

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
detailing how their reporting cost Star Wars $4.2 million.

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What an astounding figure.

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I mean, Disney wipes their fucking ass with million-dollar bills, but still.

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
How did they arrive at that amazing figure, you ask?

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Easy!

104
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
They held a poll of their readers,

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
asking if their reporting affected their decision to see the film,

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
took the amount of users visiting their site in a month,

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
figured out how much that would be in film tickets,

108
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and divided that by the people who said yes.

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Just do the math!

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Let's look at that poll again.

111
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
How many people took part?

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Um, any statistician worth their salt

113
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
will tell you that a poll of 565 people

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
will not accurately reflect the opinions of 900,000 users.

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Not even unique users, by the way,

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
so a bunch of these users will just be the same people

117
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
accessing the site at different times of day,

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and a bunch of them would have been, for example, me,

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
laughing at these fucking hilarious articles,

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
with my ad blocker turned on, by the way.

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Also, I couldn't help but notice that the question isn't

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
did our reporting make you not see it?

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It just said did it affect your decision to see it,

124
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
which doesn't really mean anything.

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Seeing the idiots on Return O' Kings

126
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
rant about how a black stormtrooper is ruining Star Wars

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
because something-something Ayn Rand white genocide

128
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
did affect my decision, too. It made me want to see it more.

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Also, if you think Trey J. Abrams is a good enough director

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
to single-handedly bring about the end of white people with his stories,

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
you do realize you're paying him a compliment, right?

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You really have to wonder why so many right-wing conservative types

133
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
have problems with The Force Awakens.

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm beginning to think it's something to do with the black-clad fascists

135
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
who rant about degenerates and who try to commit genocide getting stopped.

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay, I could literally talk about other people's opinions of Star Wars forever,

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and in fact, I plan on arguing with people about Star Wars

138
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
for the rest of my natural life.

139
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I like the prequels, and I will fight you!

140
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But for now, let's finish up with this.

141
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's an image macro one of the 4chan-type sites came up with

142
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
detailing a shocking conspiracy.

143
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The white female audience is conditioned to identify with the female

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
with her cuck staff shaped like a large black member

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
grasped at hand at all times.

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
They must be conditioned to become attracted to the black male lead.

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
This is a censored version, by the way.

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The original was punctuated with loads of shots of white women

149
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
having a lovely time with black penises.

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Whoever made this image was very, very afraid of a future

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
where white women don't pay attention to him,

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
but also had a lot of these images on hand ready to use.

153
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I guess I'll have to compliment the anonymous author on their preparedness?

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Let's go with that.

155
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Who is the white male audience supposed to identify with?

156
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Simple.

157
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The little white cuck ball.

158
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I thought this part of the image was from the censorship,

159
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
but it's actually in the original, too.

160
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
This is the fate of the white man in the West.

161
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Okay, the worst thing is BB-8 is actually the only Star Wars character

162
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I've ever wanted to cosplay.

163
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's working!

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The feminists have got me!

165
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Help!

166
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

167
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It hurts to do that voice.

168
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh, I'm not going to re-record that part.

169
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Fuck you.

170
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
In conclusion, social justice warriors, or third-wave feminists,

171
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
or whatever buzzword you decide to call them this week,

172
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
are useless non-creatives who will never amount to anything

173
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and just whine ineffectually about things they don't like.

174
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And the only way to stop them is to whine about them

175
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
even more ineffectually, which will cause them to melt.

176
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Now, when I first saw this image, I assumed it was a joke or a parody.

177
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I mean, how ridiculous is it?

178
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The assertion that there's a coded conspiracy to teach women

179
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
to find black people attractive and diminish the power of the white man.

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But then I realized I've heard that somewhere before.

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Remember this video?

182
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah, the one I showed you out of context at the beginning?

183
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's a video about cuckoldery and how Davis sees imagery of cuckoldery everywhere,

184
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
and this is somehow everyone else's fault but his.

185
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Constantly streaming through advertisements, through public events,

186
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
are these images of cuckoldery.

187
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The most obvious ones being, of course, the interracial cuckoldery.

188
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But even ignoring that, you will find a lot of cuckold themes throughout the media.

189
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's being indoctrinated into our culture.

190
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It would be rude of me not to explain what Davis meant by genocide,

191
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
so I thought I'd go back to it at the end.

192
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
In his opinion, the media's full of images designed to make it seem okay

193
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
for women to cheat on their lovers with non-white people

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
and thus destroy them by way of breeding them out.

195
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And it's fully within the UN definition of genocide

196
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
to try and destroy a race of people through genetic dilution.

197
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The media is teaching us to stop breeding properly.

198
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The media's trying to kill white people.

199
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He's deadly serious.

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
He invokes the UN definition of genocide.

201
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Well, he misuses it, but he tries to invoke it.

202
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Star Wars, for Davis, is just another head on a hydra

203
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
trying to destroy his beloved white people.

204
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Davis is quick in his videos to assert that he's not racist,

205
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
that racism is just a buzzword thrown around to try and censor him,

206
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
and that he just likes white people a lot,

207
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
and calling black people by the n-word is actually a sign of mutual respect.

208
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But in the comments of his review,

209
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
he makes the claim that predominantly black areas have more crime

210
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
not because of complicated social or economic factors,

211
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
but simply because blacks are less capable of being civilized, or something.

212
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That's why I bothered to talk about the 4chan macro.

213
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's stupid, but it reflects the genuine beliefs

214
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
on display by the alternative right on the internet.

215
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Davis is fun to laugh at.

216
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm probably his biggest fan.

217
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But eventually, if you start to really think about what he's saying,

218
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
and try to humor him by taking him seriously,

219
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
it stops being funny, and it starts being sad.

220
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Davis is someone who clearly puts a lot of thought into what he professes,

221
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and he might even have a modicum of actual education on some subjects.

222
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yet, what he comes up with, in all seriousness,

223
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
is completely indistinguishable from an image macro

224
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
that is itself almost impossible to discern from parody.

225
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Davis got a nice bump in viewership, thanks to Gamergate,

226
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
a movement co-opted and manipulated from the start

227
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
by predominantly right-wing and libertarian ideologies for their own benefit,

228
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
but he's hemorrhaged most of them in the past year or so.

229
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's not difficult to see why.

230
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Oddly enough, there's a film series that's above these petty politics.

231
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's called Star Wars. You might have heard of it.

232
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
In it, mankind just sort of...

233
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
is kind of nice to itself.

234
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You know, it doesn't ever really come up

235
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
what gender or ethnicity a character is.

236
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
There's still murder, there's still death, there's still genocide,

237
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
but it's always for ideals or for class reasons.

238
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
We've managed to move beyond race as an issue at all,

239
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
and for a film series that's literally about war,

240
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
that's bizarrely utopian,

241
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and I can't help but agree with that.

242
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's science fiction, it's basically fantasy,

243
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
but I think there's a good message there,

244
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
something that you can believe in.

245
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Brothers, sisters,

246
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
beneath the sky, there is one family.

247
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Nothing really divides us.

248
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's all an illusion clouding our judgment.

249
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
We are all one people,

250
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and I don't think there's anything we can't achieve.

251
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And I live for the day, that bright, shining day in the future,

252
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
when as one race, as one species,

253
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
we can kill those fucking space fish!

254
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'd like to say a very big thank you to all of my supporters on Patreon,

255
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
everyone you just saw before in the credits,

256
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
but an extra special thanks to Alexander Corbett and Heshy Lifeson.

257
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I couldn't have done it without you.

258
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Those Star Wars Pez dispensers were like 99 pence each on eBay.

259
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It was a nightmare.

260
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Luckily, I found a place that sold them local, and I stole them.

261
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
For those of you interested in patronizing me,

262
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
and helping me consume more than just coffee and apples,

263
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'll have you know that a $2 donation will give you access

264
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
to all the weird bonus stuff I cut out of videos for time,

265
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
and because I've decided it's a little bit too experimental.

266
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I would genuinely appreciate any donation.

267
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I haven't been able to afford new pajamas in like a decade.

268
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
This stuff's starting to tear.

269
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I actually have to wear my normal clothes over this.

270
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It won't come off anymore.

271
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Anyway, thanks a lot to my patrons.

272
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I really do need the money.

273
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
As you can tell, I have a lot of mouths to feed.

274
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Ah! Jesus!

275
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I need to cut your claws. That fucking hurts.

276
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Ah!

277
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I really regret trying to get the cat to pose with me in that shot.

278
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
He's looking himself in the corner now.
