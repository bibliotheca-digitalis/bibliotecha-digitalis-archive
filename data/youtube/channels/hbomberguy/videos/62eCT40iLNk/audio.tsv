0	5500	Now I know what you all want. You want me to cut to a shot of David Serrini saying something stupid.
8500	11500	So yes, white genocide is a thing that's going on right now.
11500	14500	And if you haven't noticed it yet, it's because you haven't opened your eyes.
14500	16500	No, I haven't!
19500	21500	I just swallowed my gum.
22500	26500	But that actually wouldn't be fair, because he didn't do a video review of The Force Awakens.
26500	29500	Instead, he wrote one for his website.
29500	33500	A website that shills for, no joke, testosterone cream.
33500	38000	The one thing David Serrini definitely does understand is his core demographic.
38000	42000	Obviously, this is a move I agree with. Not the cream, the written review, since
42000	45500	writing something ahead of time gives you a chance to think more about what you're saying,
45500	48000	so you're not just blurting out nonsense.
48000	51000	Although even with a script, not everyone can get that right.
51000	55000	The pre-sexual fantasies of a broken boy.
55500	60500	Oh god, this is gonna be great.
60500	64500	Listen up, white man. JJ Abrams hates you.
64500	71000	He relishes the thought of your extinction as he looks forward to a multi-culti-matriarchy
71000	78500	where instead of studying math and sciences, everyone sits around discussing their feelings.
78500	81500	Why specifically is it JJ Abrams who hates me?
81500	86000	You know, he co-wrote the script, along with returning Star Wars writer Lawrence Kasdan
86000	89000	and Michael Arndt.
89000	94000	Does that mean that the writing is fine, but the direction of the film specifically hates white men?
94000	99000	Paying money to see his film is the equivalent of auto-gastration.
99000	104000	It's literally the same thing as cutting off your balls.
104000	106000	So that's what all the cream is for.
106000	110000	He also refers to Finn as Mace Dindu, and apparently had to Google the name
110000	112500	of one of the main characters in a film he's analysing.
112500	117500	Davis is part of the proud, several-month-old tradition in the men's rights movement
117500	122500	where you pretend to be fucking stupid and incapable of remembering people's names for attention.
122500	130000	When, um, when the girl meets the black dude, the co-main star of the movie.
130000	133000	This is because looking like you don't know anything about what you're talking about
133000	135000	only makes your review more convincing.
135000	137000	Matt Zoller-Zeitz is far too informed.
137000	140000	I prefer it when critics forget large portions of the film.
140000	143000	Take the red pill, like in The Matrix.
143000	150000	Remember the scene where the, uh, the, the, the black guy offers John Matrix the pills?
150000	152000	Did I mention that all lives matter?
152000	157000	Towards the end, the only reason he finally nuts up and fights not-Darth Vader
157000	163000	is because he got the scent feminist Skywalker's white pussy into his nose.
163000	165000	What? Hey, hang on.
167000	170000	They must have cut that part out for the version screened in the UK.
170000	172000	I don't remember anything like that.
172000	175000	At this point in his review, I was thinking,
175000	180000	I'm pleasantly surprised Davis is making genuine effort to actually talk about the content of the film
180000	185000	to a certain degree and not spew too much of a neo-reactionary manifesto.
185000	188000	But then I scrolled down...
188000	194000	Feminist Skywalker, on the other hand, came out of the womb already an expert on everything.
194000	199000	The blame for this Star War can be assigned entirely to his dick.
199000	203000	This entire film is metaphorical for affirmative action.
203000	210000	Women in today's society graduate high school endowed with physical female hiring quotas,
210000	215000	failed at school, broke the law, gave birth to a bastard.
215000	220000	Meanwhile, the boys who were raised beside her have been deliberately held back.
220000	223000	They are presumed rapists from birth.
223000	226000	That civilization is a result of men's labor.
226000	230000	Feminists have never, and will never, accomplish anything of worth
230000	233000	because they reject the masculine principle.
233000	238000	The women of the greatest accomplishments are those who submitted.
238000	240000	The women who believed...
241000	243000	Oh my god.
243000	247000	Women bleed on the birthing bed while men bleed on the battlefield.
247000	250000	That is the nature of the species man.
250000	253000	It is women who have trouble keeping it in their pants,
253000	258000	and yet we're supposed to believe that men are the ones who think with their little heads.
258000	265000	This world of gender fluidity sells itself as freedom, but it is anything but.
265000	268000	You'd think that with the advantage of writing the article in advance
268000	272000	and decades of having to think and breathe on Earth,
272000	275000	Davis would have been able to remind himself to stay on point,
275000	280000	but like in his videos about Star Trek and feminism, and also maybe slightly Marxists,
280000	285000	he's just using a Star Wars review as an excuse to talk about how society is all thanks to men.
285000	286000	Not men like him, obviously.
286000	290000	I'm pretty sure George Washington never farted and shitted all over the social media
290000	293000	He even revels in not knowing the main characters' names.
293000	298000	So, I guess if you're into purposeful ignorance, this is the review for you.
298000	300000	For everyone else, though, it's garbage.
300000	304000	Nilpoise. Nil...po...po...uh...po...
304000	306000	Keimpokta!
306000	309000	Interestingly enough, the name Keimpokta is a name that's been around for a long time.
309000	313000	It's a name that's been around for a long time, but it's not a name that's been around for a long time.
313000	316000	It's a name that's been around for a long time, but it's not a name that's been around for a long time.
317000	319000	Keimpokta!
319000	323000	Interestingly enough, masculinity-praising website Return of Kings,
323000	326000	authors of such amazing articles as How Not to Get Raped,
326000	331000	and Wow! They Cast a Black Woman to Play Hermione in a Harry Potter Play,
331000	336000	have written an article about how terrible this film is.
336000	338000	I bet it's great.
338000	341000	Let's read it and see how reasonable it is.
341000	343000	Right after I've had a quick snack.
346000	359000	Oh, it's horrid. It's actually just terrible.
359000	361000	And that's not even a joke.
361000	364000	I'm gonna go wash my mouth.
364000	370000	Oh, uh, spoilers, it's literally all the same
370000	372000	weak-ass criticisms we've seen before.
372000	373000	Sorry.
373000	376000	I mean, Rey beat an idiot kid with a homemade lightsaber,
376000	380000	and Luke lost to the fucking Chosen One, the greatest Jedi of all time,
380000	383000	so that comparison's totally reasonable, right?
383000	385000	Okay, it's a dumb article, you get the point.
385000	387000	But even better, they then published another one,
387000	391000	detailing how their reporting cost Star Wars $4.2 million.
391000	393000	What an astounding figure.
393000	397000	I mean, Disney wipes their fucking ass with million-dollar bills, but still.
397000	399000	How did they arrive at that amazing figure, you ask?
399000	400000	Easy!
400000	401000	They held a poll of their readers,
401000	404000	asking if their reporting affected their decision to see the film,
404000	407000	took the amount of users visiting their site in a month,
407000	409000	figured out how much that would be in film tickets,
409000	411000	and divided that by the people who said yes.
411000	413000	Just do the math!
413000	415000	Let's look at that poll again.
415000	418000	How many people took part?
418000	421000	Um, any statistician worth their salt
421000	424000	will tell you that a poll of 565 people
424000	429000	will not accurately reflect the opinions of 900,000 users.
429000	431000	Not even unique users, by the way,
431000	433000	so a bunch of these users will just be the same people
433000	435000	accessing the site at different times of day,
435000	437000	and a bunch of them would have been, for example, me,
437000	440000	laughing at these fucking hilarious articles,
440000	442000	with my ad blocker turned on, by the way.
442000	445000	Also, I couldn't help but notice that the question isn't
445000	448000	did our reporting make you not see it?
448000	451000	It just said did it affect your decision to see it,
451000	453000	which doesn't really mean anything.
453000	455000	Seeing the idiots on Return O' Kings
455000	458000	rant about how a black stormtrooper is ruining Star Wars
458000	461000	because something-something Ayn Rand white genocide
461000	464000	did affect my decision, too. It made me want to see it more.
464000	467000	Also, if you think Trey J. Abrams is a good enough director
467000	470000	to single-handedly bring about the end of white people with his stories,
470000	473000	you do realize you're paying him a compliment, right?
473000	476000	You really have to wonder why so many right-wing conservative types
476000	478000	have problems with The Force Awakens.
478000	482000	I'm beginning to think it's something to do with the black-clad fascists
482000	486000	who rant about degenerates and who try to commit genocide getting stopped.
486000	490000	Okay, I could literally talk about other people's opinions of Star Wars forever,
490000	493000	and in fact, I plan on arguing with people about Star Wars
493000	495000	for the rest of my natural life.
495000	498000	I like the prequels, and I will fight you!
498000	500000	But for now, let's finish up with this.
500000	503000	It's an image macro one of the 4chan-type sites came up with
503000	505000	detailing a shocking conspiracy.
505000	509000	The white female audience is conditioned to identify with the female
509000	513000	with her cuck staff shaped like a large black member
513000	515000	grasped at hand at all times.
515000	520000	They must be conditioned to become attracted to the black male lead.
520000	522000	This is a censored version, by the way.
522000	525000	The original was punctuated with loads of shots of white women
525000	528000	having a lovely time with black penises.
528000	531000	Whoever made this image was very, very afraid of a future
531000	533000	where white women don't pay attention to him,
533000	537000	but also had a lot of these images on hand ready to use.
537000	542000	I guess I'll have to compliment the anonymous author on their preparedness?
542000	544000	Let's go with that.
544000	547000	Who is the white male audience supposed to identify with?
547000	548000	Simple.
548000	553000	The little white cuck ball.
553000	555000	I thought this part of the image was from the censorship,
555000	557000	but it's actually in the original, too.
557000	560000	This is the fate of the white man in the West.
560000	564000	Okay, the worst thing is BB-8 is actually the only Star Wars character
564000	566000	I've ever wanted to cosplay.
566000	568000	It's working!
568000	570000	The feminists have got me!
570000	571000	Help!
571000	572000	Ha-ha-ha-ha!
572000	577000	It hurts to do that voice.
577000	579000	Oh, I'm not going to re-record that part.
579000	580000	Fuck you.
580000	583000	In conclusion, social justice warriors, or third-wave feminists,
583000	586000	or whatever buzzword you decide to call them this week,
586000	589000	are useless non-creatives who will never amount to anything
589000	593000	and just whine ineffectually about things they don't like.
593000	596000	And the only way to stop them is to whine about them
596000	599000	even more ineffectually, which will cause them to melt.
599000	603000	Now, when I first saw this image, I assumed it was a joke or a parody.
603000	605000	I mean, how ridiculous is it?
605000	609000	The assertion that there's a coded conspiracy to teach women
609000	613000	to find black people attractive and diminish the power of the white man.
613000	616000	But then I realized I've heard that somewhere before.
616000	617000	Remember this video?
617000	620000	Yeah, the one I showed you out of context at the beginning?
620000	624000	It's a video about cuckoldery and how Davis sees imagery of cuckoldery everywhere,
624000	627000	and this is somehow everyone else's fault but his.
627000	630000	Constantly streaming through advertisements, through public events,
630000	632000	are these images of cuckoldery.
632000	636000	The most obvious ones being, of course, the interracial cuckoldery.
636000	643000	But even ignoring that, you will find a lot of cuckold themes throughout the media.
643000	646000	It's being indoctrinated into our culture.
646000	649000	It would be rude of me not to explain what Davis meant by genocide,
649000	651000	so I thought I'd go back to it at the end.
651000	655000	In his opinion, the media's full of images designed to make it seem okay
655000	657000	for women to cheat on their lovers with non-white people
657000	661000	and thus destroy them by way of breeding them out.
661000	665000	And it's fully within the UN definition of genocide
665000	672000	to try and destroy a race of people through genetic dilution.
672000	676000	The media is teaching us to stop breeding properly.
676000	678000	The media's trying to kill white people.
678000	680000	He's deadly serious.
680000	683000	He invokes the UN definition of genocide.
683000	687000	Well, he misuses it, but he tries to invoke it.
687000	690000	Star Wars, for Davis, is just another head on a hydra
690000	692000	trying to destroy his beloved white people.
692000	695000	Davis is quick in his videos to assert that he's not racist,
695000	699000	that racism is just a buzzword thrown around to try and censor him,
699000	701000	and that he just likes white people a lot,
701000	705000	and calling black people by the n-word is actually a sign of mutual respect.
705000	707000	But in the comments of his review,
707000	710000	he makes the claim that predominantly black areas have more crime
710000	713000	not because of complicated social or economic factors,
713000	717000	but simply because blacks are less capable of being civilized, or something.
717000	720000	That's why I bothered to talk about the 4chan macro.
720000	724000	It's stupid, but it reflects the genuine beliefs
724000	727000	on display by the alternative right on the internet.
727000	729000	Davis is fun to laugh at.
729000	731000	I'm probably his biggest fan.
731000	734000	But eventually, if you start to really think about what he's saying,
734000	737000	and try to humor him by taking him seriously,
737000	740000	it stops being funny, and it starts being sad.
740000	744000	Davis is someone who clearly puts a lot of thought into what he professes,
744000	748000	and he might even have a modicum of actual education on some subjects.
748000	750000	Yet, what he comes up with, in all seriousness,
750000	753000	is completely indistinguishable from an image macro
753000	757000	that is itself almost impossible to discern from parody.
757000	760000	Davis got a nice bump in viewership, thanks to Gamergate,
760000	763000	a movement co-opted and manipulated from the start
763000	767000	by predominantly right-wing and libertarian ideologies for their own benefit,
767000	770000	but he's hemorrhaged most of them in the past year or so.
770000	773000	It's not difficult to see why.
773000	777000	Oddly enough, there's a film series that's above these petty politics.
777000	779000	It's called Star Wars. You might have heard of it.
779000	782000	In it, mankind just sort of...
782000	784000	is kind of nice to itself.
784000	787000	You know, it doesn't ever really come up
787000	790000	what gender or ethnicity a character is.
790000	794000	There's still murder, there's still death, there's still genocide,
794000	799000	but it's always for ideals or for class reasons.
799000	803000	We've managed to move beyond race as an issue at all,
803000	806000	and for a film series that's literally about war,
806000	809000	that's bizarrely utopian,
809000	812000	and I can't help but agree with that.
812000	815000	It's science fiction, it's basically fantasy,
815000	818000	but I think there's a good message there,
818000	821000	something that you can believe in.
821000	824000	Brothers, sisters,
824000	827000	beneath the sky, there is one family.
827000	829000	Nothing really divides us.
829000	832000	It's all an illusion clouding our judgment.
832000	835000	We are all one people,
835000	838000	and I don't think there's anything we can't achieve.
838000	842000	And I live for the day, that bright, shining day in the future,
842000	845000	when as one race, as one species,
845000	848000	we can kill those fucking space fish!
858000	861000	I'd like to say a very big thank you to all of my supporters on Patreon,
861000	863000	everyone you just saw before in the credits,
863000	867000	but an extra special thanks to Alexander Corbett and Heshy Lifeson.
867000	869000	I couldn't have done it without you.
869000	872000	Those Star Wars Pez dispensers were like 99 pence each on eBay.
872000	874000	It was a nightmare.
874000	877000	Luckily, I found a place that sold them local, and I stole them.
877000	879000	For those of you interested in patronizing me,
879000	882000	and helping me consume more than just coffee and apples,
882000	885000	I'll have you know that a $2 donation will give you access
885000	889000	to all the weird bonus stuff I cut out of videos for time,
889000	891000	and because I've decided it's a little bit too experimental.
891000	894000	I would genuinely appreciate any donation.
894000	897000	I haven't been able to afford new pajamas in like a decade.
897000	899000	This stuff's starting to tear.
899000	901000	I actually have to wear my normal clothes over this.
901000	903000	It won't come off anymore.
903000	905000	Anyway, thanks a lot to my patrons.
905000	907000	I really do need the money.
907000	910000	As you can tell, I have a lot of mouths to feed.
916000	918000	Ah! Jesus!
918000	921000	I need to cut your claws. That fucking hurts.
921000	922000	Ah!
922000	925000	I really regret trying to get the cat to pose with me in that shot.
925000	928000	He's looking himself in the corner now.
