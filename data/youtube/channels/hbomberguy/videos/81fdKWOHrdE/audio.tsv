4800	6040	When it was first announced,
6040	8340	RWBY seemed like it was gonna be great.
8340	11760	It was produced by a darling of independent web content
11760	14500	and created by a legendary animation genius
14500	16420	and some of his most trusted colleagues
16420	18000	and written by two...
18000	20500	but even with all this stuff in place,
20500	22120	RWBY's pretty bad.
22120	25160	The basic concept, a 3-D anime about monster hunters,
25160	27380	is great, and when it tries to flesh this out,
27380	29420	there's some really interesting ideas at times,
29420	32040	and in brief moments, it's got scenes or segments
32040	33460	that suddenly really work,
33460	36080	but overall, it's confusing and frustrating.
36080	37300	It isn't fun to watch,
37300	39580	and no matter how much attention you give it,
39580	41180	your attention is only rewarded
41180	43720	with more writing or animation problems.
43720	45840	It's not, like, the worst show ever made,
45840	47460	but RWBY's failures matter
47460	50000	because it really could have been something,
50000	52500	and that makes the parts that were good even sadder
52500	54920	because you can always see what it could have been
54920	56500	and maybe almost was.
56500	59000	I wanna just call this garbage and move on with my life,
59040	60380	but it's just not that simple,
60380	61500	which is a shame for me.
61500	63540	It means I can't use the most popular video title
63540	65200	I use when I criticize media.
65200	68080	Is this it? Is this gonna be on my fucking gravestone?
68080	70460	Eight long years into production
70460	73120	with a massive crew by web video standards
73120	75120	and its eighth season on the way.
75120	77200	Sorry, volume. They call them volume?
77200	79500	The show has garnered a pretty large following
79500	81420	and a super devout fan base,
81420	82760	and it's easy to see why.
82760	86340	The show frequently threatens to suddenly become good.
86340	88340	People saw what it promised
88380	90300	and believed it would deliver.
90300	91960	The pieces are all still there,
91960	94100	and sometimes, just often enough
94100	95520	for people to keep watching,
95520	98140	it looks like they're going to fall into place.
98140	100140	♪♪
101380	103020	But they never have,
103020	104980	and it's starting to become clear
104980	106640	that they probably never will,
106640	109140	and that makes the show infinitely more disappointing
109140	111140	than something you could easily say is worse,
111140	113060	and the reasons why the show has failed
113060	114480	to become what it could have been
114480	116640	are multitudinous and interlinked.
116660	119320	There's a million distractingly small problems
119320	121120	that ultimately aren't that big a deal
121120	122880	and weaken real criticism
122880	124460	by being given too much attention,
124460	126420	and every major problem ties into
126420	128960	and is responsible for every other major problem
128960	131460	in a way that makes it almost impossible to unpick.
131460	135600	RWBY may be the first show ever to be holistically bad,
135600	137600	but do not despair, fellow believers
137600	140860	in objective analysis of cartoons.
140860	142640	I'm here to defend you
142640	144900	and eviscerate RWBY with a sword
144900	146860	made of logic and reason.
146860	149120	It's a metaphorical sword, really.
149120	150580	Oh, also it can turn into a gun
150580	152580	because that would be cool.
152580	155340	Uh, this is how media criticism works, right?
155340	157920	So this time on the increasingly infrequent
157920	161140	cries for help my family refuses to believe is my job,
161140	162920	I'll be exploring the problems that started
162920	164920	in the early years of the show's development,
164920	166300	how they set the tone for a show
166300	168220	that never quite ended up where it could have been,
168220	170180	why it matters that such a promising thing
170180	171100	turned out this way,
171100	174140	and exactly how and why so many decent ideas
174140	175760	can often get misunderstood
175760	178600	when writers simply borrow them from other shows they like.
178600	180800	I'm focusing primarily on the first three seasons
180800	181940	of the show in this video
181940	183860	because RWBY can be pretty neatly divided
183860	185320	into two separate eras
185320	187180	with two different sets of problems
187180	188600	that don't fully overlap,
188600	190060	and for the purposes of criticism,
190060	191940	I intend to treat them as distinct entities
191940	192780	in most cases.
192780	193820	If you're a fan of the show,
193820	195520	you're probably dreading the worst here,
195520	197480	although if you're a fan of the second half of the show,
197480	198780	you probably already agree
198780	200120	with most of what I'm going to say,
200120	201820	but in any case, if you like RWBY
201820	203320	and you still watch this video,
203380	205800	I love you and thank you for joining me on this journey.
205800	208840	My goal isn't to make anyone think less of a show,
208840	210920	just to think more about it.
210920	213560	It's important to be critical of media you enjoy,
213560	215260	and there is a lot to enjoy about RWBY,
215260	217180	so I hope to give credit where it's due,
217180	218600	and in the places that aren't as good,
218600	220100	well, that's way more interesting.
220100	221680	It's often said that failure
221680	223600	is one of the best learning experiences,
223600	224720	and in that respect,
224720	227400	RWBY has a lot of good things to teach.
227400	230900	Oh, do we not have a cool animated intro for this video?
230900	233900	It's about an anime. It would've been kind of cool.
233900	235400	Are we just going with the standard?
235400	238080	What? It's fine. I mean, it's a bit underwhelming, but...
238080	239820	Hey, do you all remember Rooster Teeth?
239820	242240	No, I don't mean AT&T's, Warner Media's,
242240	243700	Otter Media's Rooster Teeth,
243700	245200	the company with hundreds of employees
245200	248340	that makes podcasts and shows and movies and games.
248340	251540	Rooster Teeth is starting video game development.
251540	253800	It's a company that's been around for a long time.
253800	255800	It's a company that's been around for a long time.
256780	258780	It's a company that's been around for a long time.
258780	259780	It's a company that's been around for a long time.
259780	261280	I mean, Rooster Teeth,
261280	262880	the five or so people who made
262880	264660	Red vs. Blue in their bedroom.
264660	266840	Hey. Yeah?
266840	268540	You ever wonder why we're here?
268540	269960	It's one of life's great mysteries, isn't it?
269960	272880	Popular on the web in the early years was machinima.
272880	275880	People would pose and act characters in games,
275880	279340	effectively using video games as a medium for making movies.
279340	281800	Not in my diner, you don't know Lumberjacks.
281800	284020	The new city design, it just say no Lumberjacks.
284020	285180	Oh, yeah, I didn't see that sign.
285200	286940	Red vs. Blue wasn't the first attempt
286940	288200	to make something like this,
288200	290200	but it was far and away the most popular one.
290200	292700	All right, here's the plan.
292700	295460	And it was shockingly successful.
295460	297960	People who had no idea what machinima was
297960	299500	knew about Red vs. Blue.
299500	301880	How many people could make a show half as good as this
301880	303680	using what amounts to a microphone
303680	304840	and a copy of Halo?
304840	307340	I certainly couldn't, and I know because I tried,
307340	309140	and I'm so glad no one saw that.
309140	311880	I was saved by not knowing how to upload videos
311880	312980	when I was 12.
312980	316360	YouTube would simply not accept my Windows Movie Maker file.
316360	318200	As a business, 2000's Rooster Teeth
318200	320740	were incredibly smart, a tiny team producing
320740	323500	a fairly simple show made in a video game engine
323500	325540	but managing to promote it and build it
325540	327880	into a recognizable brand of its own.
327880	329080	The show had merch.
329080	332000	Not Halo merch, but Red vs. Blue merch.
332000	335080	Rooster Teeth had done what was basically impossible
335080	338540	and successfully built a business making machinima.
338540	340760	Not even machinima did that.
340800	342580	So yeah, well done to Bernie Burns
342580	343620	and the rest of the team.
343620	345000	Anyway, then it kept going for, like,
345000	346920	a decade while I wasn't looking.
346920	349140	No, really. They're still making Red vs. Blue
349140	350380	over at Rooster Teeth.
350380	351380	Did you know that?
351380	352980	Can you conceive of the idea
352980	354880	that a show you had fun with in your bedroom
354880	357860	when you were in high school is 17 seasons deep?
357860	359900	I found that out while I was working on this video
359900	362360	and a friend told me that they're on season 17.
362360	364240	It's still hitting me.
364240	366020	Why haven't they stopped?
366020	368660	Well, it's not because the creators of Red vs. Blue
368680	370800	had 17 years of ideas in them.
370800	373060	Rooster Teeth isn't a small company
373060	375740	whose people can do what they want creatively anymore.
375740	376940	They've been bought.
376940	378900	They're part of a large conglomerate now
378900	382660	and their work isn't just a show they like making for fun
382660	384040	because they had a nice idea.
384040	387460	It's an intellectual property with a capital I and P,
387460	389320	and they're gonna keep making it for as long
389320	391040	as it theoretically makes money
391040	393740	no matter how little anyone wants to make it.
393740	395660	As Bernie has always said,
395660	398080	as long as people like it, we will keep making it.
398080	399380	Yep, so shut the fuck up.
399380	400760	And even once you hate it,
400760	402720	even once you're totally fed up with it,
402720	404640	you're like, just stop. We'll still be there.
404640	405640	We're gonna milk the shit out of it.
405640	407100	Every penny is worth it.
407100	409340	Meanwhile, in another corner of the internet,
409340	412440	another form of early web hashtag content
412440	413720	was being produced.
413720	416680	A guy named Monty Oum was putting 3D animations
416680	419060	of some incredibly cool fights on the internet
419060	421560	on places like early YouTube and DeviantArt
421560	422600	and game trailers.
422600	424360	God, remember game trailers?
424360	425700	Oh, I feel so old now.
425740	428700	His most long-running work was the Dead Fantasy series,
428700	430620	short fights featuring the female characters
430620	432280	from Dead or Alive and Final Fantasy.
432280	434400	These animations are still really cool.
434400	435860	They're basically just characters you know
435860	438460	from stuff fighting, but that's all they have to be.
438460	441000	The fights feel desperate, violent, impactful,
441000	443200	cool, fast, and incredibly technical.
443200	445300	There's nothing quite as good as these
445300	446800	at the things these are doing,
446800	449040	but perhaps the most well-known Monty animation
449040	450920	was released in 2007.
450920	452840	It was called Haloid.
452840	454500	Haloid is utterly fantastic.
454520	457400	Halo Man beats up hundreds of Halo aliens,
457400	460060	but then Metroid Man turns up and they fight,
460060	462820	but then it turns out Metroid Man is a girl
462820	464280	and then they fight each other again
464280	467200	and also more aliens in a big sequence so epic
467200	470160	only music taken directly from the Matrix Reloaded's
470160	472820	Burly Brawl scene could possibly do it justice,
472820	474460	and they even pay homage to some scenes
474460	475620	from that fight while they're at it.
475620	477380	They blow all the aliens up and escape,
477380	478700	reenacting another cool scene
478700	480540	from the Matrix Reloaded in the process,
480540	484840	but then it turns out that Halo Man was also a girl.
484840	485840	Oh, my God!
485840	488220	And then they watch the sun set.
488220	490140	Ah, that's nice.
490140	491800	Maybe I'm being overly sentimental
491800	493260	about some animated fights,
493260	496520	but the late, great Monty Oum was basically a genius
496520	497520	at what he did.
497520	499280	The guy passed away really tragically
499280	500940	and suddenly in 2015,
500940	502820	but the body of work he left behind
502820	505560	is genuinely fantastic and inspirational.
505560	508480	It's fascinating to me that stuff Monty made for fun,
508480	510240	for free in a couple of weeks
510240	513280	is infinitely more dynamic and fun and engaging
513280	516020	than stuff real, big-budget animation productions
516020	517020	have put together.
517020	518900	I can barely think of a handful of things
518900	520400	that even remotely compare.
520400	522360	For a time, Rooster Teeth and Monty Oum
522360	524780	were just their own things off in their own corners
524780	528500	of the Internet, but then, 2010, PAX.
528500	531120	Rooster Teeth premiere a new episode of Red vs. Blue.
531120	532960	It's standard fare for the show, really.
532960	535580	Familiar characters, familiar engine limitations,
535580	537960	cute meta jokes about how nerfed the pistol was
537960	538960	in the new Halo game.
538980	540520	You know, these things aren't quite as effective
540520	541520	as they used to be.
541520	542980	We're robbing...now.
542980	543980	But then...
543980	545980	Do you want to hear a...
545980	549980	♪♪
549980	550980	More?
550980	552700	♪♪
552700	554700	How much longer does it take, asshole?
554700	558040	-♪♪
558040	559380	I wasn't there when this happened,
559380	561960	but I remember going as wild as this crowd did
561960	563460	when I saw this episode online.
564420	565420	Oh, my God!
565420	569100	-♪♪
569100	571800	The limitations of the Halo games had been broken.
571800	572800	Who could be behind it?
572800	574520	Oh, who am I kidding? You know who's behind it.
574520	575520	You've guessed this bit.
575520	578440	We saw a short film called Haloid
578440	580560	by a gentleman by the name of Monty Oum.
580560	583480	-♪♪
583480	586400	And we were extremely impressed by what we saw.
586400	587560	This is, if you haven't seen it before,
587560	589940	it's a piece where Master Chief fights Metroid.
589940	591080	Wow, Bernie.
591080	593120	Video game knowledge check fail.
593160	594740	It's Sergeant Metroid.
594740	596740	Have some respect for the troops.
596740	599820	Monty had been hired in secret by Rooster Teeth
599820	602580	to work on animation for the new season of Red vs. Blue.
602580	604780	For almost 10 years now, I've been so in love
604780	606080	with how they introduce him.
606080	607880	He's literally in the audience and they say,
607880	610000	hey, Monty's here now, and he just gets up
610000	612000	and joins in as the fourth panelist.
612000	613340	It's excellent showmanship
613340	615000	and also just really kind of beautiful.
615000	616720	So now in Red vs. Blue,
616720	618460	there were suddenly tons of interesting
618460	620420	and creative animated sequences
620420	622180	and when some kind of fight was going to happen
622200	623940	instead of being in-engine characters
623940	625740	standing and shooting at each other
625740	628540	and being kind of boring, it'd be a Monty-Ohm fight.
628540	630920	These sequences really added a lot to the series.
630920	632760	All right, now you're just showing off.
632760	634460	Well, that's a big thing. We like doing team-up stuff, right?
634460	636000	And we found Monty on the Internet.
636000	637800	Here's something he's doing that's really cool
637800	639920	that we can't do so we're just gonna come together
639920	641040	and make something cool.
641040	642920	As they grew, they expanded their production
642920	646100	of other shows and podcasts and became a media entity
646100	648520	which would eventually be worthy of the ultimate prize,
648520	650560	being bought and turned into a subsidiary
650560	652020	of a larger media conglomerate.
652020	654600	However, their biggest show and Monty's animations
654600	656600	were still technically just fan works
656600	658640	of someone else's intellectual property.
658640	661020	Monty and the others clearly wanted to paint
661020	663680	on a bigger canvas and have a fresh start.
663680	666020	Monty wanted to create something as expressive
666020	668900	and unique and stylish as the anime and video games
668900	670020	that had inspired him.
670020	672020	Like, Monty and I are working on right now
672020	674140	a whole series that's just not machinima at all.
674140	675400	It's just animation stuff.
675400	677320	Right. And we're throwing around ideas for that.
677320	680280	This show would turn out to be called RWBY
680280	682160	and the first of four trailers for the series
682160	683460	was released with the conclusion
683460	685080	of Red vs. Blue season 10.
685080	687460	But, uh, RWBY, which we finally showed a trailer for
687460	689960	at the conclusion of Red vs. Blue season 10 last night.
689960	692120	Fuck yeah. We're fucking excited.
692120	693500	It's, it's awesome.
695780	698580	Now, obviously, I'm kind of biased against this show.
698580	701280	I'm making a whole video about why I didn't like it.
701280	703040	Keep this in mind when I say that
703040	705780	RWBY's Red trailer fucking owns.
705780	709780	["RWBY's Red Trailer"]
709780	712280	It's an extravaganza of violence,
712280	714580	visual style, speed, timing,
714580	718000	and this is one of the most fantastic things ever.
718000	721000	Everyone who saw this flipped the fuck out.
721000	724540	Holy shit, it's a scythe that turns into a gun.
724540	728460	Oh! The Red trailer has 15 million views on YouTube.
728460	730960	That's more than any episode of RWBY.
730960	733500	That's more than any episode of Red vs. Blue.
733500	735700	The first episode has 14 million views
735700	739580	and just for the record, uh, the second episode has 6.8.
739580	741680	The only things on Rooster Teeth's channel
741680	743880	with more views are the really cool Monty fight
743880	746220	from Red vs. Blue season eight which I already showed
746220	748640	which they uploaded on its own separately from the show
748640	750100	because they knew it was amazing,
750100	752140	a joke Angry Birds movie trailer
752140	754520	that went viral twice, you know, once when it came out
754520	756360	and then again when actual trailers
756360	759060	for the actual real Angry Birds movie started coming out
759060	761860	and, uh, Minecraft Let's Play because of course.
761860	763020	The trailer is very simple.
763020	764740	This Red character visits a grave
764740	766360	then gets accosted by werewolves
766360	768400	before fighting and killing dozens of them
768400	769760	but it's so much more than that.
769760	772900	It's so cool looking, so good feeling to watch
772900	774780	and just so alive with motion
774780	776700	that it sells the show right away.
776700	778360	You immediately want to see more of it
778360	780440	and know what's going on in this world.
780440	781940	Welcome back, by the way.
781940	784160	I'm saying that because half the people watching this video
784160	786160	remembered the Red trailer while I was talking about it
786160	787500	and paused to go watch it again.
787500	789200	Another thing I want to bring up while we're here
789200	791000	is that this is the best piece of music
791000	792800	Jeff Williams has ever composed.
792800	794540	Jeff had been doing music for Rooster Teeth
794540	796460	since early in the Red vs. Blue days
796460	797960	and while he was clearly talented,
797980	799900	there wasn't much room in Red vs. Blue
799900	801820	most of the time for his music to shine
801820	804120	and this trailer really gives him the chance to do that
804120	806960	and he clearly latched onto it like a limpet.
806960	808360	The song in this trailer introduces
808360	809660	a really powerful motif.
809660	810660	It's this bit here.
810660	815840	["Limpet"]
815840	817840	It has a surprising amount of versatility.
817840	819460	It gets used later in this fight
819460	821300	in a much more intense variation.
821300	826760	["Limpet"]
826780	829240	This sound will basically be Ruby's,
829240	831200	both the show and the characters,
831200	833240	central theme for the rest of the series.
833240	835080	They knew they had something great with this
835080	836460	and they just went with it.
836460	838740	The White trailer introduces us to a character
838740	841000	called Weiss who appears to be a singer
841000	842740	and intercuts her singing with a sequence
842740	844760	where she fights a giant knight with a rapier
844760	846080	with a revolver in the handle.
846080	848800	She has more of a magic-oriented fight style
848800	849840	and the fight's pretty good.
849840	851840	I really like how expressive the visuals are
851840	853000	in these first two trailers.
853000	856100	The world is stark colors and the lighting is harsh.
856100	858060	The backgrounds here are blacks and whites.
858060	860340	It's hard to tell if the events of the trailer are literal
860340	862220	or if this is a liminal space
862220	863680	and the knight represents something.
863680	866100	I like the red on the inside of her dress and boots too.
866100	869060	It really pops out and makes the whole visual design work.
869060	871680	They've really committed to making the character one color
871680	873600	but giving them just enough of other stuff
873600	875340	that it stands out even more.
875340	878100	Weiss's singing is done by Casey Lee Williams,
878100	881380	Jeff Williams's daughter, who was 15 at the time.
881380	883720	Casey's clearly pretty talented so it works.
883720	885680	Weiss wins and it fades back to her singing
885680	887760	for the audience but the wound she got in the fight
887760	888840	fades to a scar.
888840	891800	Did she get it in this fight or from something else?
891800	892920	Ooh, mysterious.
892920	895600	The black trailer introduces us to...
895600	898420	writing and voice acting.
898420	901460	Blake, it's time.
901460	904000	I'm sorry, what? I'll turn that up for you.
904000	907040	Blake, it's time.
907040	908340	Oh, God, I shouldn't have turned it up.
908340	910680	They anime ninja run over to catch a train
910680	913180	snaking through this beautifully designed red forest.
913180	916220	Inside the train is a cool fight with evil robots.
916220	918000	Yeah! The fight's pretty good.
918000	920140	Blake's weapon is a sword whose holster
920140	921840	is another bigger sword
921840	924100	and they're connected by a string or something.
924100	925720	Also, it can turn into a gun.
925720	927600	Uh, it looks neat but I couldn't tell you
927600	929420	exactly what it does.
929420	930220	I like it though.
930220	931920	The music in this trailer has lyrics too
931920	933840	sung again by Casey Lee Williams.
933840	936140	The singing is, well, this time she's being pushed
936140	938600	to sing aggressive anime fight music.
938600	941220	♪ A boy with a knife and a chain ♪
941220	943840	♪ A boy with torture and a pain ♪
943840	946340	♪ A boy with ridicule and hate ♪
946340	948300	Oh! The fight is cool though.
948300	950220	I don't think it's as cool as the red trailer
950220	952300	because it's set in or on a train
952300	954720	so the fight sequences are in a rectangular box
954720	956260	or basically just a straight line.
956260	957840	It's hard to have creative movements
957840	959180	and camera work in that setup.
959180	960340	It's a bit of a limitation.
960340	962980	Halfway through, we get the first proper story beat
962980	964420	of our whole show.
964420	965380	Perfect.
965380	967300	Ugh, I'll set the charges.
967300	968960	What about the crew members?
968960	970300	What about them?
970300	972660	Oh, I think he might be a bad guy.
972660	974420	This is the beginning of a writing problem
974420	977200	which starts here and continues to plague the show
977200	979960	until, uh, actually it hasn't stopped yet.
979960	981340	When you have a character straight up say,
981340	983300	I don't care about killing civilians,
983300	985000	to someone's face, what you're doing
985000	986700	is having a character openly admit
986700	988700	they've been written to be the bad guy
988700	990840	and that's incredibly weird because they've written
990840	993840	monsters into the setting that are just generically evil
993840	997080	and want to destroy humanity because that's in their nature
997120	1000080	so it's very weird that the actual characters
1000080	1002320	that you wrote behave like that too.
1002320	1003580	Anyway, they get attacked by a robot
1003580	1006620	and the guy cuts it apart in a genuinely really cool shot
1006620	1008080	but then he gets to the front of the car
1008080	1010580	and Blake says goodbye and cuts the car free,
1010580	1012740	leaving him behind, obviously having a problem
1012740	1015200	with his being okay with killing innocent people
1015200	1016360	and I guess this is the first time
1016360	1017580	she's noticed this about him
1017580	1019580	and as she disappears into the distance
1019580	1021500	and the colors really beautifully fade away
1021500	1023120	so she's alone in a void
1023120	1024700	and we're given a meaningful impression
1024700	1026120	of her emotional state,
1026120	1029540	the audience is struck with one lingering thought.
1029540	1030700	He can make that jump.
1030700	1032820	In the yellow trailer, we're introduced to Yang,
1032820	1034620	a character based on Goldilocks
1034620	1038740	so we have Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Goldilocks
1038740	1041580	and, uh, this one isn't really clear yet
1041580	1043400	but trust me, we'll get to it.
1043400	1045160	It's...we'll get to it.
1045160	1046740	Yang goes to a bar whose soundtrack
1046740	1048540	is a remix of the theme from the red trailer.
1048540	1051900	["Red Riding Hood Theme"]
1051900	1053660	It's neat. She beats up the manager
1053660	1055780	over whether he's seen someone in a picture
1055780	1058100	and she's written like two adult men
1058100	1060520	who've never written anything professionally before
1060520	1063860	except for Red vs. Blue trying to write a teenage girl.
1063860	1065860	Weirdly specific impression there.
1065860	1068020	Oh, Junior, I was just playing with you.
1068020	1069480	Don't be so sensitive.
1069480	1071640	Come on. Let's kiss and make up, okay?
1071640	1073240	But after two minutes, she punches the guy
1073240	1075320	and a fight starts and the trailer gets really good.
1075320	1078560	Her weapons are gloves that unfold into fist guns.
1078560	1080480	Yang's design and basic fighting style
1080480	1083440	seem very evocative of Tifa from Final Fantasy VII,
1083440	1085600	a character Monty previously liked to use a lot
1085600	1087300	in Dead Fantasy. It kind of makes sense
1087300	1089380	that some of the characters are designed around characters
1089380	1090800	he previously liked animating,
1090800	1092380	but now they're his own characters
1092380	1093880	that he has total control over.
1093880	1096460	Yang has three back-to-back cool fights
1096460	1098960	against a gang of guys who all dress like Jim Sterling,
1098960	1101300	two ladies who I guess are bodyguards or something,
1101300	1103000	and then against the guy she punched earlier.
1103000	1104640	She punches him with so much power
1104640	1106880	that the screen gets a Photoshop filter over it
1106880	1108380	and when she lands outside the bar,
1108380	1109380	Ruby is there.
1109380	1111760	Yang? Is that you?
1111760	1113300	Oh, no. Is that how she talked?
1113300	1114920	The writing and voice acting could do
1114920	1117960	with some refining and some of Jeff's musical decisions
1117960	1119920	could be dialed back just a little bit,
1119920	1122700	but basically these trailers are some of the coolest
1122700	1125240	possible trailers for a cartoon ever.
1125240	1128380	Like, if you showed me every trailer for every cartoon
1128380	1131160	and asked me which one I'd want to see at the end of that,
1131160	1133280	of course I'd pick Lunatics Unleashed.
1133280	1136000	I mean, seriously, this is fucking insane.
1136000	1138820	Why would anyone make this? I have to know!
1138820	1141160	But at a very close second, I'd pick this one.
1141160	1144040	Literally millions of people have gone back
1144040	1145580	to watch the red trailer again,
1145580	1147240	and looking at view figures, they've done that
1147240	1149740	instead of watching more of the actual show.
1149740	1152040	They're not just amazing teasers for a show.
1152040	1153240	They're just good.
1153240	1155660	It's so hard not to be on board
1155660	1157620	for the show these trailers are pointing to.
1157620	1160360	They imply a show that's going to be utterly,
1160360	1162320	fantastically tremendous.
1164200	1165860	But then it came out and it was bad.
1165860	1167860	["Lunatics Unleashed"]
1167860	1169440	Oh, you're still here. Right.
1169440	1172620	So Ruby isn't as simple as a bad show, is it?
1172620	1175320	It's a bad show which could have been something,
1175320	1177120	something truly amazing,
1177120	1179620	and that makes its problems infinitely more interesting
1179620	1181360	and important to explore,
1181360	1182980	and it's especially worth doing
1182980	1184980	because the show's creators do try
1184980	1187100	to be receptive to criticism.
1187100	1190640	Well, they try, but this manifests in a strange way
1190640	1192220	I'd like to discuss real quick.
1192220	1194140	The writers have talked on podcasts,
1194140	1196300	commentary tracks, panels, and so on
1196300	1198940	about the ways people have been shitty about the show
1198940	1200860	and how important it is to not be an asshole
1200860	1202280	when you're criticizing something.
1202320	1203320	People will make a comment.
1203320	1204680	Maybe it's, like, a criticism or something,
1204680	1207600	and you go, oh, okay, yeah, that's a fair critique,
1207600	1208440	but you don't want to listen to them
1208440	1209520	because of the way they said it,
1209520	1212120	which is something I think most people agree with.
1212120	1215520	It's really tough when you get a criticism
1215520	1218160	that you actually agree with
1218160	1219820	but you think was expressed
1219820	1222660	in an incredibly insensitive and rude way
1222660	1223920	because you never want to know
1223920	1225340	what the writer has to say about that.
1225340	1227960	That's not the way you get things.
1227960	1228800	It's just not.
1228800	1230380	I really get what he's saying here,
1230380	1232660	and, yeah, plenty of criticism of the show
1232660	1234820	is worthless dog shit.
1234820	1237220	For some reason, this show seems to attract people
1237220	1240740	who need excuses to yell at cartoon women,
1240740	1242100	but I'm having a hard time
1242100	1245220	finding more than one or two decent examples
1245220	1247460	of times they've really explored
1247460	1249860	actual criticisms of the show,
1249860	1252740	and the fact the show keeps making the same mistakes
1252740	1254820	implies they kinda don't.
1254820	1256460	I've seen the writers sometimes, quote,
1256460	1258580	retweet someone being shitty about the show
1258580	1260180	and responding to this behavior,
1260220	1263100	and, again, often what they're saying is correct.
1263100	1265660	If you have a point but you're an asshole about it,
1265660	1267700	no one will want to listen to you.
1267700	1271340	I basically agree completely with what Miles is saying here,
1271340	1274420	but he appears to spend a significant amount less time
1274420	1276220	responding to the kinds of criticism
1276220	1278180	he says he wants to see,
1278180	1280380	and there is good-faith criticism out there,
1280380	1283700	so stepping over them to point at bad-faith criticisms
1283700	1286100	and complain about how they're not helpful
1286100	1288180	means that, functionally, all you're doing
1288180	1291380	is rewarding shitty people with time and attention
1291380	1294020	you then don't spend engaging with the people
1294020	1296580	who make the decent criticisms of your work,
1296580	1300220	and as a lifelong fan of Rooster Teeth and Monty Oum,
1300220	1303140	I certainly hope it's clear that my criticism
1303140	1305180	comes from a well-meaning place.
1305180	1307380	I'm only here because I really thought
1307380	1308900	the show could have been great,
1308900	1311180	and I still think that maybe it could be.
1311180	1312100	Hey, see?
1312100	1314100	The chapel wasn't just here to be a reference
1314100	1315500	to that scene from Kingsman.
1315500	1317900	It was also a clever metaphor for my intent
1317900	1320420	to make a good-faith criticism.

1370240	1372780	RWBY is about a girl who goes to anime warrior school
1372780	1373940	after getting invited
1373940	1376360	by the ominous and enigmatic headmaster,
1376360	1377660	Sephiroth Dumbledore,
1377660	1380160	and RWBY and her sister and new friends
1380160	1382160	mess about doing plot lines
1382160	1384280	that don't go anywhere for a few years
1384280	1387620	while the show decides what its story actually is.
1387620	1389120	Okay, wait, we're getting ahead of ourselves.
1389120	1391120	I wanted to start this video by doing the thing
1391120	1393740	all the smart video essayists are doing nowadays
1393740	1396040	where they sum up the plot of the thing they're analyzing
1396040	1397920	in a funny way that lays the groundwork
1397920	1399880	for future critique, but trying to delve into
1399880	1401920	and describe the deeper story problems
1401920	1403420	misses the surface problem
1403440	1405440	that there basically isn't one.
1405440	1406820	There's a really telling scene
1406820	1408120	at the end of the second season
1408120	1409820	where the main characters sit around
1409820	1411740	discussing the events of the show so far
1411740	1413820	and conclude that they don't really know
1413820	1415500	what's happening or why
1415500	1417200	and haven't figured anything out yet.
1417200	1418700	We didn't solve everything.
1418700	1419880	A lot of people were hurt,
1419880	1422720	and we still don't even know why they did this
1422720	1424540	or who that mystery girl was.
1424540	1426540	The show attempts to justify this, though.
1426540	1428880	Not every story has an eaten tidy ending.
1428880	1432520	Stories don't have to make sense or go anywhere.
1432540	1435540	Now, to a certain extent, this is an okay point to make.
1435540	1437740	Like, in real life, things don't have arcs
1437740	1439660	or necessarily lead anywhere,
1439660	1442420	but if 28 episodes into your story,
1442420	1443960	you're ending a season on a character
1443960	1445960	giving what amounts to a justification
1445960	1447540	for the story not mattering,
1447540	1450140	maybe the plot could have done with some more work.
1450140	1452840	The dog mimicking Yang is really cute, though,
1452840	1454180	so at least there's that.
1454180	1455640	Uh, time for bed?
1455640	1457380	Oh, please. Absolutely. Yes.
1457380	1459520	This is the season two finale.
1459520	1462100	We don't know what the story is.
1462180	1463180	Nap time.
1463180	1465140	Almost all of our main characters
1465140	1468440	don't find out what the actual story that's going on
1468440	1472280	actually is until about halfway through season four
1472280	1475620	where someone tells them while sitting around a campfire.
1475620	1477400	Ruby's story is one of those stories
1477400	1479860	that I like to call theoretically interesting
1479860	1481700	where, like, if you read it on Wikipedia,
1481700	1482960	it would sound really cool,
1482960	1484580	and in the show, there are plenty of times
1484580	1485960	where the characters sit you down
1485960	1487300	and tell you what the story was,
1487300	1490000	and you go, oh, that's actually really interesting.
1490000	1491500	I wish I'd seen some of that,
1491500	1494080	but in the actual episodes of the show you get to see,
1494080	1495580	not much happens at all,
1495580	1498120	so to hone in on why the story ended up like this,
1498120	1500380	we're gonna have to explore how the show was made.
1500380	1502540	Monty Oum was the main creator of Ruby,
1502540	1505500	but it seems like he didn't do much of the writing himself.
1505500	1507500	In interviews, Monty and the rest of Rooster Teeth
1507500	1509500	have been up front that Monty's not that interested
1509500	1511300	in the writing part of making a show.
1511300	1513220	And we do stuff like writing characters
1513220	1515260	and storylines and stuff that he doesn't really,
1515260	1516420	I don't know if he's just not interested in it,
1516420	1518940	but he doesn't do it. He likes all the animation.
1518940	1521140	Monty was more of a visual storyteller
1521160	1523820	and seemed to prefer to have writers do the writing part,
1523820	1526240	which means the show has some other important creators,
1526240	1528080	Miles Luna and Kerry Shawcross.
1528080	1530740	Ruby is being, it's directed by Monty Oum,
1530740	1533880	uh, and then, uh, Monty, Kerry, and myself
1533880	1535220	are the lead writers for the show.
1535220	1537260	Kerry had done some editing and compositing work
1537260	1540100	on Red vs. Blue and Miles had done machinimating,
1540100	1542560	like the head bobbing to the recorded dialogue,
1542560	1543600	on season nine.
1543600	1546220	He then wrote 13 minutes worth of miniseries
1546220	1548060	and helped co-write season ten.
1548060	1550140	Fucking with Ruby was a lot of fun.
1550140	1551640	It was a lot of fun to make.
1551640	1553900	It was really scary because it was essentially
1553900	1557160	the first time that either of us had ever written anything.
1558020	1561120	Oh, I appear to have accidentally paused that clip.
1561120	1562320	Written anything.
1562320	1563820	On this scale. Yeah, on this scale.
1563820	1565580	On this scale, for sure, yeah.
1565580	1567820	There's a fourth really important team member
1567820	1570200	who often goes unmentioned even though he's in the credits
1570200	1572960	of Ruby from even the first trailer, Shane Neuville.
1572960	1574340	He was a close friend of Monty's
1574340	1576380	and the two collaborated quite a lot on stuff.
1576380	1578040	He'd worked with him on the animated parts
1578040	1579040	of Red vs. Blue.
1579080	1582500	Monty or Shane will choreograph fights
1582500	1583780	or whatever sequences.
1583780	1585580	And he's made some great stuff on his own.
1585580	1589120	Monty first came up with some of the basic concepts for Ruby
1589120	1591120	while eating in an IHOP with Shane.
1591120	1593040	He doesn't get credited very often for his role
1593040	1594220	in the making of the series,
1594220	1596720	but some of the best animated moments were made by him.
1596720	1598880	So Monty came up with the basic ideas
1598880	1601060	for Ruby's world and characters and story
1601060	1603100	and then brought on Kerry and Miles as writers
1603100	1604560	and Shane as another animator.
1604560	1606300	The kind of thing we want to deliberate on
1606320	1609240	and put more thought into is, like, the plot and character.
1609240	1610620	And that's the stuff that Miles and Kerry's
1610620	1611620	been helping me with.
1611620	1613000	So, like, um...
1613000	1615500	Monty, Kerry, and Miles appear to have worked together
1615500	1618160	to come up with a basic outline of the plot and setting,
1618160	1619460	but most importantly for Monty,
1619460	1621380	the action sequences that were going to happen
1621380	1622880	and when in the story they happened,
1622880	1625140	and then Monty, Shane, and maybe a few others
1625140	1627180	went off to start work on the action scenes,
1627180	1629260	in doing so crafting some of the most cool
1629260	1631440	and elaborate action sequences ever made.
1631440	1633900	Meanwhile, the writers and the rest of the animation team
1633900	1635600	put together the rest of the scenes.
1635620	1637500	Eventually the three of us all decided on
1637500	1640780	a few set rules and characters and, um,
1640780	1642700	story ideas that we wanted to stick to.
1642700	1646040	Monty's working on, like, action and, like,
1646040	1648340	the design and the look of the show
1648340	1652080	and he kind of had us go off and start writing,
1652080	1653960	uh, the first episode.
1653960	1655720	Yeah. This division of work does seem
1655720	1657140	to make sense on the surface.
1657140	1659020	However, something Miles is being nice
1659020	1661140	and not mentioning is that sometimes Monty
1661140	1664680	would just disappear and then come up with new characters,
1664680	1666760	story elements, and action sequences
1666760	1669520	which the writers would then suddenly have to make room for
1669520	1671480	in their script. More on that later,
1671480	1673060	but for now, generally speaking,
1673060	1674820	Monty and Shane did the fights,
1674820	1676360	Kerry and Miles wrote the words,
1676360	1678240	and another team of animators put together
1678240	1679360	the non-action scenes.
1679360	1680900	The three of us would have a lot of meetings
1680900	1683620	and collaborate on the show to the point where
1683620	1685860	I just started coming up with the broad strokes eventually
1685860	1687160	and they would work. They had pretty much written
1687160	1688880	the book or the bulk of the show.
1688880	1690340	So in Monty's own words,
1690340	1692760	the bulk of the show is written by these writers.
1692760	1694340	To a certain extent, it's a bit like
1694340	1696800	if Dead Fantasy was a full animated series
1696800	1698620	with writers hired to connect the dots
1698620	1700800	and explain and justify the fights that were happening.
1700800	1702500	So there's a lot of good places to start
1702500	1704420	when analyzing the show's writing process,
1704420	1706020	but the best place is probably
1706020	1707520	the very beginning of the show.
1707520	1709480	I know, right? I'm a genius.
1709480	1711940	The opening of RWBY really doesn't set up
1711940	1714180	the story too well, but it does set up
1714180	1716140	the writing problems we'll go on to see
1716140	1718060	throughout the story in a useful way.
1718060	1720180	RWBY begins with a very simplistic-looking
1720180	1722860	introductory animation explaining the basic setting
1723540	1725920	with the slight problem that it doesn't actually
1725920	1726960	do that at all.
1726960	1728800	All it actually says is there's man
1728800	1731220	and also dangerous monsters that want to eat them up
1731220	1733520	called Grimm, as in Grimm's fairy tales,
1733520	1736180	which is kind of cute, and then man discovered dust,
1736180	1738440	a magical substance, well, magical-ish.
1738440	1740180	We'll get to that later, which can be used
1740180	1742680	to defeat them in some vague way.
1742680	1746780	This power was appropriately named Dust.
1746780	1748520	Why is that an appropriate name?
1748520	1749620	Hang on.
1749620	1753620	Man born from dust was strong, wise, and resourceful.
1753620	1756260	Okay, so it's called Dust because we, like,
1756260	1760640	came from dust, man, and that's the intro.
1760640	1762520	You'd think they'd explain a little bit more
1762520	1764940	about the world itself or what the setting is like,
1764940	1766560	and as they zoom out on a world map,
1766560	1769400	you briefly see four castles, so what's going on there?
1769400	1771440	Are they countries? But before you can be told
1771440	1773240	anything more important than dust,
1773240	1774860	they evaporate and we transition
1774860	1776520	to the first real scene of the story.
1776520	1778020	The intro doesn't share information,
1778020	1780260	which might have been really good to know going in
1780260	1783100	so people aren't confused when it suddenly comes up later.
1783100	1784900	For example, there's a third species
1784900	1787680	separate from humans or Grimm called the Faunus
1787680	1789600	whose existence and treatment by humans
1789600	1791700	is supposedly one of the driving elements
1791700	1792900	of the entire plot.
1792900	1794280	The first time this plot element
1794280	1796980	or even what a Faunus is comes up
1796980	1799740	is about 11 episodes into the show.
1799740	1801360	It must be hard to be a Faunus.
1801360	1803700	Your first reaction to a core plot point is,
1803700	1805580	to be a what? What's that?
1805580	1808000	The Faunus are mentioned once at the end of episode one
1808060	1810320	on TV when a piece of concept art
1810320	1812980	briefly brings up something called the Faunus protests.
1812980	1816320	This Saturday's Faunus civil rights protest turned dark.
1816320	1818860	But before they can actually tell you what that is,
1818860	1820540	it cuts out and then they don't come up again
1820540	1822000	until near the end of the season,
1822000	1824500	so it's almost like a surprise when they come back up.
1824500	1826500	For another example, in RWBY's setting,
1826500	1829160	every character has a power called Assemblance,
1829160	1831380	an ability completely unique to them.
1831380	1834340	What Assemblance is or the fact they exist at all
1834340	1837300	or how this universe's version of magic even works
1837320	1839520	isn't mentioned in the slightest in the opening
1839520	1840900	where that might have been nice,
1840900	1844020	and the name Semblance isn't even said in the show
1844020	1846280	until episode four...teen.
1846280	1847700	Fourteen. Sorry, I stuttered.
1847700	1849400	The four kingdoms and their relationships
1849400	1851320	with each other and their fragile peace
1851320	1853820	barely comes up until that peace is fractured
1853820	1855820	in season three where you suddenly learn
1855820	1857740	as it's happening that this peace
1857740	1860740	was incredibly easy to fracture and was hanging by a thread.
1860740	1862880	Our kingdoms are at the brink of war.
1862880	1865540	Wait, what? Are they? What's happening?
1865540	1867960	These all would have been really useful to know
1867960	1870460	going into the story or at least should be
1870460	1873420	properly set up at some point and not just dumped on you
1873420	1875080	the instant they become relevant,
1875080	1877300	but instead basic aspects of the setting
1877300	1879040	start to feel almost like twists
1879040	1881540	when they suddenly come up multiple hours in
1881540	1883920	with no groundwork laid for you whatsoever,
1883920	1886420	and the main opportunity to set some of this stuff up
1886420	1888980	and get the audience on the same narrative page,
1888980	1890940	the intro, gets thrown away
1890940	1892720	to give you a commercial for dust.
1892720	1895180	Why? Well, the first scene in the show
1895200	1897120	is the main villain of the first season
1897120	1899740	robbing a dust store and Ruby fighting them.
1899740	1902080	Now, in abstract, this opening scene itself
1902080	1903420	is a fine idea.
1903420	1905960	It's a very common and punchy way to start a story,
1905960	1908540	have a crime happen and the main character stopping it.
1908540	1909960	It's immediately engaging.
1909960	1912220	It draws the viewer in with action and stakes,
1912220	1913880	and it's a strong way of establishing
1913880	1915920	the primary hero and villain of a story.
1915920	1918940	Now, they could be robbing a bank or a convenience store
1918940	1921520	or a gas station or a jewelry store
1921520	1923020	or an analog for these things
1923020	1924440	that's appropriate to the setting,
1924440	1927360	but the decision was made to have it be a dust store,
1927360	1928740	and this is a decent choice too.
1928740	1930420	It's an important thing within the setting.
1930420	1933040	However, this does pose a problem for your audience
1933040	1935540	because now you're opening on the attempted theft
1935540	1937620	of a fantasy resource which has no point
1937620	1940040	of easy comparison to anything in real life.
1940040	1942760	You know how everyone knows what the One Ring is
1942760	1945640	because it's a ring that has evil magical properties
1945640	1946760	so you kind of get it?
1946760	1948380	Not quite as many people engaged
1948380	1951340	with the Silmarils, did they?
1951340	1953900	God, even admitting I know what that is embarrasses me.
1953900	1956020	If you just opened on this robbery without the intro,
1956020	1957900	people would get the gist of robbery
1957900	1959020	and girl stopping them,
1959020	1961520	but not what dust is or what it does
1961520	1962980	or why it's so important,
1962980	1965320	but you kind of have to start with the dust store
1965320	1967320	because it's a unique place for the setting
1967320	1969320	which could be interesting if it's pulled off well,
1969320	1971780	and the plan of the main villain for this season
1971780	1974040	is that he's stealing all the dust from everywhere,
1974040	1976000	so it's economically good storytelling
1976000	1977920	to open on one of those attempted thefts,
1977920	1980220	so in order for everyone to know what dust is
1980220	1981380	and why it's important,
1981380	1983680	the intro animation for the entire series
1983700	1985380	was either written or rewritten
1985380	1987800	to primarily focus on explaining dust
1987800	1989880	which is a tremendously poor idea
1989880	1991880	because now nothing else is explained.
1991880	1992880	When it comes down to it,
1992880	1994560	there's stuff much more important
1994560	1995840	to set up in the story
1995840	1998060	than some guy robbing a store.
1998060	1999760	Compounding this is that the plot
1999760	2002680	of the entire first season is this bad guy,
2002680	2003980	Clockwork Orange Man,
2003980	2005900	is trying to steal dust.
2005900	2009240	Why? Well, you'll find out in season never
2009240	2011520	because they dropped that plot point.
2011520	2012520	I'm not even kidding.
2012540	2014160	They changed their mind about the plot,
2014160	2015340	so none of this matters.
2015340	2017920	So yeah, on top of the obviously quite large problem
2017920	2019540	that the writers didn't know what their story
2019540	2021460	was going to be until after they'd finished
2021460	2022680	writing a season of it,
2022680	2025760	the chance to set up and explain the wider setting
2025760	2028140	so people know a little more is squandered
2028140	2030600	in order to explain why the next scene in the show
2030600	2032180	is supposed to be important
2032180	2034600	and then it turns out not to be anyway.
2034600	2037140	This is the opposite of economical storytelling.
2037140	2039740	This is...expensive storytelling.
2039740	2041480	This jumbled mess of ideas,
2041520	2043520	plot decisions, intro priorities,
2043520	2045620	and later changes makes the intro feel
2045620	2047780	like a first draft that they couldn't change.
2047780	2049320	In the commentary track, they talk a lot about
2049320	2051120	how cool it was that they got the voice actress
2051120	2053660	for Cortana from Halo to do the opening voiceover
2053660	2056320	and it seems like she might have had a pretty busy schedule,
2056320	2059080	so I have the sinking feeling that they wrote the intro
2059080	2061200	and then recorded it and then realized
2061200	2062920	that maybe it could have done with some more work
2062920	2063920	and it was too late.
2063920	2066080	That's, that's just my speculation there though,
2066080	2068000	but this stuff needs to be the strongest
2068000	2069300	because it's the best chance you have
2069320	2071780	to sell an audience on your setting and story.
2071780	2073840	The only thing really holding up its end here
2073840	2075540	is Monty's fight with the robbers,
2075540	2077460	which is really good, and also the transition
2077460	2079260	to the fight from the scene in the store
2079260	2081140	employs a really cool technique I love
2081140	2083340	called shifting diegesis because you think
2083340	2084840	that you're just hearing the music
2084840	2086840	but it's actually playing on Ruby's headphones.
2086840	2089220	["I'm the one who's gonna get it"]
2089220	2091220	["I'm the one who's gonna get it"]
2091220	2093180	That and the fight are really cool
2093180	2095440	and because of the intro not being super great,
2095440	2097440	I think it's the only thing that really hooks people in
2097440	2098600	in the first few minutes.
2098620	2100000	No one's watching the intro and going,
2100000	2102280	oh, wow, dust sold.
2102280	2105240	The show ends up having a lot of interesting ideas,
2105240	2108260	but those ideas are executed on and explained to you
2108260	2111640	extremely poorly in a way that really lets the show down.
2111640	2112960	I'm gonna say this right now.
2112960	2115420	Ruby's story gets interesting.
2115420	2118960	Ruby is a really fun show to write a wiki about.
2118960	2121060	There's some great stuff in there over the years,
2121060	2124020	but the story telling only gets worse
2124020	2126760	and the setting is one of the most poorly communicated
2126800	2129520	the world had ever seen before Bright came out.
2129520	2131560	Let's talk about world building and more importantly
2131560	2133560	how you convey that world to the viewer.
2133560	2135520	A thing lots of good fiction stories
2135520	2137760	for young adults try to do is craft a story
2137760	2139100	where you learn how things work
2139100	2140980	without being explicitly told.
2140980	2142760	The setting of, say, Avatar
2142760	2144760	to pick a completely random example
2144760	2147020	doesn't tell you exactly how everything works
2147020	2149400	because this world is normal to the people living in it
2149400	2152400	so no one would need to stop and ask what's going on.
2152400	2155020	Sometimes you meet people who can throw fire at you
2155020	2156440	and that's just not that surprising.
2156460	2158460	There's a nation full of people who can do that
2158460	2159880	and hey, you probably have a relative
2159880	2161960	who can throw rocks without touching them.
2161960	2163000	That's life, man.
2163000	2164340	So for the sake of the audience,
2164340	2167460	the story is written so the unique aspects of the world
2167460	2168960	come up in ways where the audience
2168960	2170220	learns how things work.
2170220	2171880	It's waterbending and it's...
2171880	2174600	Yeah, yeah, an ancient art unique to our culture,
2174600	2175840	blah, blah, blah.
2175840	2177520	This example from the first episode
2177520	2179180	is a little clumsy and obvious
2179180	2180520	compared to the rest of the show,
2180520	2182400	but it's really solid exposition
2182400	2184560	especially for a show that children might be watching.
2184560	2186600	You now know what waterbending is
2186600	2188600	and that it's unique to a culture
2188600	2191240	and that this is all so normal in this world
2191240	2193520	that even teenagers are casually dismissive
2193520	2195560	about this information and you learn all of this
2195560	2197660	without even feeling like you're being told.
2197660	2199480	You think you're just watching two siblings
2199480	2201160	arguing about how to catch a fish,
2201160	2203280	you fucking idiot, but you're secretly having
2203280	2205540	the main concepts of the world explained to you.
2205540	2207580	It's clever. Katara's trying to catch a fish
2207580	2209460	with waterbending, but in real life,
2209460	2211840	the viewer is the fish out of water.
2211840	2213760	Ha ha ha. Who let you in here?
2214200	2215920	I once heard someone smarter than me
2215920	2218120	calling this naturalistic storytelling.
2218120	2220640	The story never condescends to its audience
2220640	2222720	by pausing to tell you how the world works.
2222720	2224640	Instead, it just tells the story
2224640	2227440	in a way that makes it easier to understand how it works,
2227440	2228980	but if you're a talentless hack,
2228980	2231020	there are other ways of writing exposition.
2231020	2232480	In, say, Harry Potter,
2232480	2234200	Harry is a person from our world
2234200	2236240	learning about a much more magical one
2236240	2237440	hidden behind his own,
2237440	2239240	so the viewer is told how some things work
2239240	2240620	by way of Harry learning
2240620	2242860	because Harry doesn't know and needs to be told,
2242880	2245260	so we get scenes where people tell Harry
2245260	2246260	how the world works.
2246260	2248100	Now, I personally think it's better
2248100	2250100	to discover things without having a character
2250100	2251820	just be told, but a lot of Harry Potter
2251820	2253320	takes place at a school,
2253320	2255440	so almost all interesting storytelling
2255440	2256520	is kept to a minimum.
2256520	2259120	Harry Potter isn't as good as when you read it as a child.
2259120	2261280	The hottest take of 2014.
2261280	2263540	The exposition in RWBY is, well,
2263540	2265660	there's a character in the story called Jaune.
2265660	2267700	Jaune Ark. Do you get it?
2267700	2270080	Who inexplicably doesn't know basic elements
2270080	2271300	of the setting he lives in,
2271320	2273060	and at several points early in the story,
2273060	2274660	another character takes him aside
2274660	2276240	to tell him how things work.
2276240	2278360	Do you know what aura is?
2278360	2279820	For example, in an early scene,
2279820	2282740	this character, Pyrrha, explains aura to him.
2282740	2284700	She gives a long speech about how aura
2284700	2287540	is a manifestation of your spiritual energy,
2287540	2289080	nay, your soul.
2289080	2291460	Basically, you have a shield for a while in fights
2291460	2293920	like in Halo. I guess old habits die hard.
2293920	2296180	Aura is the manifestation of our soul.
2296180	2298100	It bears our burdens and shields our heart.
2298100	2299460	Have you ever felt like you were being watched?
2299460	2300800	Our aura can be our shield.
2300800	2302220	Everyone has it, even anima.
2302220	2303800	The monsters we fight lack a soul.
2303800	2306140	Creatures' manifestation, they are the darkness.
2306140	2307440	It's not about understanding.
2307440	2308900	So start by wearing light.
2308900	2310320	Just manifest our aura.
2310320	2311640	Get it with everyone.
2311640	2313360	It's like a force field!
2313360	2315060	Okay, Miles, Kerry,
2315060	2316560	you just made your whole audience
2316560	2318480	sit through that exposition.
2318480	2320780	You can't then make a joke about how simple
2320780	2322080	the explanation could have been.
2322080	2323900	Also, when you're doing exposition,
2323900	2325500	you still have to think about the character
2325500	2326820	who's saying it and why.
2326820	2328540	You know, Pyrrha's a teenager.
2328540	2330540	Young adults don't tend to walk around
2330580	2332780	with entire speeches about how their world works
2332780	2334460	prepared in case someone asks.
2334460	2336740	That's just really strange characterization.
2336740	2338660	It's also really strange writing-wise
2338660	2340300	for Jaune to not know this.
2340300	2342500	Jaune is the latest in a long line
2342500	2345600	of heroic monster hunters and is in anime warrior school
2345600	2347600	because he wants to live up to this legacy.
2347600	2350140	My father, my grandfather, and his father before him
2350140	2351140	were all warriors.
2351140	2353140	They were all heroes.
2353140	2354260	I wanted to be one too.
2354260	2356940	There's no way he didn't, at some point,
2356940	2359780	pick up this concept growing up or in training
2359800	2361900	or, you know, it is a core aspect
2361900	2364220	of, like, life in this world.
2364220	2367560	Jaune's character not knowing is such poor characterization
2367560	2369740	that it literally doesn't make sense.
2369740	2372660	You know, in Harry Potter, Harry was a literal child
2372660	2375540	who was deliberately sheltered from magic all his life,
2375540	2378360	so his not knowing stuff was explained by the story.
2378360	2381540	That's kind of the only way this expository style works.
2381540	2383040	You have to incorporate them not knowing
2383040	2384920	into the character or it doesn't make sense.
2384920	2387340	If you want to explain one of the world's mechanics,
2387360	2389780	it's not great to do it by having a character
2389780	2392980	whose whole life revolves around knowing this information,
2392980	2396460	not know it, and for the first person he ever asks about it
2396460	2398820	to happen to have a speech prepared.
2398820	2402580	Jaune's idiocy is often used to try to make hilarious jokes
2402580	2404840	about man not know thing.
2404840	2407580	There's no way I put my gear in locker 636 yesterday.
2407580	2409460	I would have remembered having to count that high.
2409460	2410720	Ha ha ha ha ha.
2410720	2413000	But more than for a joke, it's also a vehicle
2413000	2414760	for someone to have an excuse to give
2414760	2417520	really straightforward sounding exposition for the audience.
2417520	2419640	In the scene where Jaune first meets Pyrrha,
2419640	2422360	Weiss tells him who Pyrrha is.
2422360	2424320	This is Pyrrha. Hello again.
2424320	2426740	Pyrrha graduated top of her class at Sanctum.
2426740	2427740	Never heard of it.
2427740	2429040	Do you know who Pyrrha is?
2429040	2432460	Let me tell you and also the viewer who she is
2432460	2434420	and list some of her accomplishments.
2434420	2436300	She's won the Mistral Regional Tournaments
2436300	2437540	four years in a row.
2437540	2439000	A new record. The what?
2439000	2441720	It's not just that Jaune's characterization suffers
2441720	2444720	from him being written to be literally born yesterday.
2444720	2447400	It's that everyone else's characterization suffers too
2447400	2450560	when they essentially have to pause being their own characters
2450560	2452680	in order to explain the story to someone.
2452680	2455280	Pyrrha, in my opinion, is one of the most interesting characters
2455280	2457660	in the show, but so much of the time she could have spent,
2457660	2460780	like, being interesting or doing something interesting
2460780	2463660	is spent obsessed with teaching Jaune everything
2463660	2465960	he needs to know and how to fight.
2465960	2468780	I've seen people call this show progressive and feminist
2468780	2470920	because it has a lot of female main characters,
2470920	2472460	but looking at how they're written,
2472460	2474120	I don't think I can agree there.
2474120	2478580	This strong female character is basically immediately reduced
2478580	2481200	to doing all of the emotional and physical labor
2481200	2483880	for this guy. A huge portion of the early show's
2483880	2487120	screen time is dedicated not to the main characters of Ruby,
2487120	2489760	who the show is named for, but to Jaune,
2489760	2493460	the real main character getting trained and explained to
2493460	2496720	and flirted with by Pyrrha, the coolest girl in school.
2496720	2499260	Incidentally, Jaune is voiced by Miles Luna,
2499260	2501140	the lead writer of the show.
2501160	2502160	Hey, Pyrrha.
2502160	2503460	What's up, girl? How you doing?
2503460	2505160	She's so pretty.
2505160	2507380	She's so pretty.
2507380	2508760	She's so pretty.
2508760	2511000	So even while having a comic relief character
2511000	2513000	who doesn't know things he definitely would
2513000	2514500	so people can explain it to him,
2514500	2517020	the show is still struggling for good opportunities
2517020	2519020	to explain the setting and plot.
2519020	2522020	Luckily for exposition's sake, but not the viewers,
2522020	2524600	they have, like Harry Potter, set a majority
2524600	2527400	of the early show in a school so often the viewer
2527400	2530480	is in a literal classroom being lectured to
2530500	2533000	and no, it doesn't become fun when the characters
2533000	2534460	in the scene are bored of it too.
2534460	2536460	However, because they're trying to make
2536460	2539160	the exposition naturalistic, you're also expected
2539160	2542680	to immediately grasp multiple abstract concepts
2542680	2544140	that aren't explained at all.
2544140	2546100	Take, for example, semblances.
2546100	2547100	What's a semblance?
2547100	2548480	Okay, well, they're not magic.
2548480	2551100	Something the show is very careful to explain
2551100	2553780	is that they're not magic because people don't think
2553780	2555320	magic is real in this setting.
2555320	2558400	We have dust semblances, but I mean,
2558400	2560320	there's no such thing as magic.
2560320	2562360	To them, semblances are normal and magic
2562360	2565280	would be really weird, but just for my own entertainment,
2565280	2567500	three of the things I just showed you were semblances
2567500	2568780	and one of them was magic.
2568780	2570240	Good luck figuring out which is which
2570240	2572620	without being explicitly told by the story.
2572620	2576340	Every character in RWBY has one really unique special ability.
2576340	2578800	Blake can leave shadow clones behind
2578800	2581680	and use dust to augment their elemental abilities.
2581680	2583460	Uh, Yang can go Super Saiyan
2583460	2585560	and get more powerful when she's angry,
2585560	2588560	but then later they re-explain that it's her getting stronger
2588600	2591600	as she gets hurt more, like she channels the damage.
2591600	2593340	With each hit, she gets stronger
2593340	2595600	and she uses that energy to fight back.
2595600	2597220	Then later they change it again
2597220	2598640	to how it is her getting angry.
2598640	2600980	Her father calls it basically a temper tantrum.
2600980	2602680	Basically a temper tantrum.
2602680	2605240	Oh, and then they change it back again in volume six.
2605240	2607060	His semblance is like yours.
2607060	2608740	He absorbs energy through his sword,
2608740	2611360	stores it up, and then sends it back when he's ready.
2611360	2613620	So if you're confused about how the main character's
2613620	2615460	semblances actually work, it's okay.
2615460	2616500	So were the writers.
2616500	2618000	This isn't just me nitpicking.
2618020	2619640	This lack of internal logic
2619640	2621480	when it comes to something even as simple
2621480	2624200	as one of our four main character's abilities
2624200	2626480	makes the show very confusing to watch.
2626480	2627820	When you're watching Yang fighting,
2627820	2630040	you don't know whether to feel if she's actually in trouble
2630040	2632160	or if she's waiting to unleash her power,
2632160	2635000	and that means it's kind of hard to ever really know
2635000	2637660	what level of danger one of your main characters is in,
2637660	2639080	and that really sucks.
2639080	2641300	Oh, also another expository problem
2641300	2642420	is in this scene too.
2642420	2644420	A guy who can move this quickly
2644420	2645960	is currently fighting Yang.
2645960	2647920	He's just off screen while this is happening.
2647920	2651560	Did he stop so Blake can tell Yang his semblance?
2651560	2654260	Is he just waiting for the exposition to finish?
2654260	2656560	Listen, guys, I'm not trying to be mean,
2656560	2659680	but, like, show one other person your script
2659680	2660680	before you're done.
2660680	2662520	Like, just show it to one person.
2662520	2664520	Ruby's power is she can move really quickly
2664520	2666660	and turns into a weird orb made of cloth
2666660	2668320	and rose petals as she does it.
2668320	2671040	Weiss can make symbols appear that either lock things
2671040	2673080	in place or stick people to things,
2673080	2674740	but also she can summon monsters?
2674740	2676420	But this isn't magic. It's not magic.
2676420	2678500	Glinda Goodwitch, yeah, really clever,
2678500	2681040	can, well, she can basically do magic,
2681040	2683800	like control things and shoot energy
2683800	2685660	and put broken things back together
2685660	2688000	and instantly kill monsters, but it's not magic,
2688000	2691180	and Pyrrha is basically Magnet Man from the X-Men,
2691180	2692800	so this is a totally cool thing
2692800	2694180	to put in your fantasy setting.
2694180	2695640	It's very shounen anime.
2695640	2697520	It really fits. It's a fine idea.
2697520	2700720	So how is this explained to you by the story?
2700720	2702680	Well, uh, they don't.
2702680	2705260	The intro doesn't mention it along with most things,
2705260	2707220	and for the vast majority of the first season,
2707220	2708520	it's not mentioned at all.
2708520	2711020	You see some crazy magical-looking stuff
2711020	2713600	happening, and you assume based on people's reactions
2713600	2715940	that some people can do magic in this world,
2715940	2720360	and that's fine, but then 14 episodes into the show,
2720360	2723260	Pyrrha saves Jaune's life by manipulating his shield
2723260	2725360	from afar with her Magnet Man powers,
2725360	2727900	which we didn't know she had until this moment either,
2727900	2730480	by the way, and all the other characters react to this
2730480	2732400	as if it's a crazy unique thing.
2732400	2734320	Uh, what?
2734340	2737560	Despite tons of magical shit happening before that
2737560	2739260	and one of the people in this scene
2739260	2743060	surprised by Pyrrha's power can seemingly also do magic,
2743060	2745100	and they have this conversation about it.
2745100	2746480	How did you?
2746480	2749320	Well, Ruby has her speed.
2749320	2751440	You have your glyphs.
2751440	2754060	My semblance is polarity.
2754060	2755860	This is the first time in the show
2755860	2758360	anyone has mentioned semblances.
2758360	2760860	This just happens.
2760860	2765060	Nobody watching the show knows what that word means yet.
2765060	2768320	So then, bam, right as you're maybe getting to grips
2768320	2769900	with everything else you've been told,
2769900	2773200	brushed up on your in-show Ruby 101 classes,
2773200	2775700	it turns out fundamental things you thought you knew
2775700	2777560	about the setting, like that there's magic
2777560	2779440	and that's fine, were lies,
2779440	2782060	and actually every single character in the world
2782060	2785940	has one unique thing they can do with its own special name
2785940	2788820	that is explicitly not the same thing as magic,
2788820	2790320	but just to fuck with you,
2790320	2793700	magic does also exist in addition to all this.
2793700	2795020	The idea's completely fine,
2795020	2797400	but this is not how you convey it to an audience.
2797400	2798660	This scene is supposed to be about
2798660	2801020	Jaune's personal growth as a character,
2801020	2803240	but instead, first-time viewers are gonna be going,
2803240	2804740	hang on, what's a semblance?
2804740	2806200	I thought people could just do magic.
2806200	2810020	Imagine if the first time anyone said bending
2810020	2814120	in Avatar the Last Airbender was 14 episodes in,
2814120	2816480	but in addition, Pyrrha also specifically
2816480	2818400	is keeping her semblance a secret.
2818400	2819860	We gotta tell them what happened!
2819860	2821940	We could...
2821940	2825600	or perhaps we could just keep it our little secret.
2825600	2827440	She doesn't broadcast her power,
2827440	2829560	so it puts her opponents at a disadvantage.
2829560	2831600	But then later when some other characters
2831600	2833020	figure out what her power is,
2833020	2834780	they call it by the same name.
2834780	2836400	Her semblance is polarity.
2836400	2838400	So it's a secret, but everyone knows
2838400	2840600	the specific name of Pyrrha's ability
2840600	2843100	without needing to be told it once they see her do it.
2843100	2845520	What I'm trying to say is semblance is a kind
2845520	2848760	of a semi-complicated concept to just drop on people.
2848760	2849760	They don't have to be.
2849760	2851480	There are tons of shows and anime
2851480	2854100	where every character has a unique ability of some sort.
2854100	2856520	There's this great narrative technique
2856520	2859180	that a lot of anime utilizes nowadays
2859180	2862940	where they explain what is happening in them.
2862940	2864400	In JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,
2864400	2867720	almost every main character has a power called a stand,
2867720	2870020	but the way they introduce it is they have a character
2870020	2872260	getting confused by these weird powers he has
2872260	2874100	and then two other characters turn up
2874100	2877300	to explain what a stand is to him so he gets it,
2877300	2881180	thus helping to ensure that you also know how stands work
2881180	2884980	so that the audience knows what's happening in the story.
2884980	2887260	So, yeah, it's not like every character
2887260	2889600	having a power is a bad story idea,
2889600	2892300	but semblances are specifically made stranger
2892300	2894220	by either the lack of exposition
2894220	2897300	or the presence of incredibly confusing exposition.
2897300	2900100	Like in volume five, they explain what semblances are
2900100	2902680	to another character, presumably because they realized
2902680	2904800	the audience had never been actually told
2904800	2908920	what semblances were in the show for five seasons.
2908920	2910600	Can you see the problem here?
2910600	2912460	When these ideas and story components
2912460	2914420	are being explained so strangely
2914420	2916340	and it's taking seasons to correct,
2916340	2918540	eventually the viewer either stops watching
2918540	2921540	or stops caring about really understanding what's going on.
2921540	2924920	They start to treat it like it's not really worth their time
2924920	2927840	and tune it out while they wait for the next cool fight.
2927840	2931180	Good exposition and proper conveyance of information
2931180	2934500	are so important in stories, especially fantasy stories.
2934500	2937420	If you do it in a boring way or do it badly
2937420	2940680	or don't do it at all or explain only one thing
2940680	2942420	in the introduction of your whole series
2942420	2944640	and then it turns out not to be as big a plot point
2944640	2947040	as you'd thought, the audience's experience
2947040	2949840	of your potentially good story is damaged
2949840	2952180	and it's really hard to get that goodwill back
2952180	2953180	when you've lost it.
2953180	2954840	I'm only realizing now,
2954840	2956460	writing this video,
2956460	2960040	exactly how cool Ruby's story could have been
2960080	2962820	if it was written in a way that wasn't such a struggle
2962820	2963940	to get to grips with.
2963940	2965780	The show is having such a problem
2965780	2967820	conveying its world that you have to watch
2967820	2970740	another different show to learn basic shit.
2970740	2973500	Despite spending tons of time sitting you down
2973500	2975040	telling you how the world works,
2975040	2976700	they still don't manage to tell you enough
2976700	2978960	about the setting for you to be able to understand it,
2978960	2980820	so they made a second companion show
2980820	2982660	consisting entirely of lectures
2982660	2984620	called, Ruby, World of Remnant.
2984620	2987120	Everyone's favorite part of watching a cartoon.
2987120	2990080	The homework, like what all the countries are
2990080	2991360	and how they work,
2991360	2993480	how Huntsman Academies work,
2993480	2995520	and the basic history of the world
2995520	2997360	along with the major mechanics of the show
2997360	2999520	like what Grimm actually are,
2999520	3001240	what Faunus are,
3001240	3002940	how Aura works,
3002940	3004520	what Assemblance is.
3004520	3005980	Oh, and how could we forget
3005980	3008740	the cross-continental transmit system?
3008740	3010520	The creators seem to have realized
3010520	3012320	that this isn't explained very well
3012320	3013860	in the story that they wrote,
3013860	3017220	so they essentially made a private personal Wikipedia
3017220	3018900	to tell you what was happening.
3018900	3020760	In the commentary track for volume two,
3020760	3023400	they basically admit that World of Remnant exists
3023400	3025020	to patch up all of these holes.
3025020	3026180	We have the World of Remnant videos
3026180	3028600	to kind of get, uh, some exposition across,
3028600	3030260	um, as best we could.
3030260	3031480	As best we could?
3031480	3034640	Guys, no one was forcing you to write the story badly.
3034640	3037520	They're even animated in the same style as the intro,
3037520	3040260	effectively admitting the actual introduction
3040260	3041560	didn't explain anything.
3041560	3043400	If you watch through Ruby on Crunchyroll,
3043440	3044680	which, uh, why?
3044680	3045840	The World of Remnant episodes
3045840	3047760	are scattered between the normal ones.
3047760	3049800	They're genuinely telling you that the best way
3049800	3051720	to experience Ruby is for the show
3051720	3053060	to stop every now and then
3053060	3054720	so that you can be told a few minutes
3054720	3056440	of straight exposition.
3056440	3059520	The World of Remnant is a dangerous place.
3059520	3062180	It especially doesn't help that the explanations
3062180	3064600	in World of Remnant aren't very good either.
3064600	3066600	The World of Remnant episode about Grimm
3066600	3069680	explains that we don't really know much about Grimm.
3069680	3071980	Scientists perpetually find themselves
3072020	3074480	with more questions than answers.
3074480	3076940	Little else is known about the creatures of Grimm.
3076940	3079020	Great. Thanks.
3079020	3081060	The World of Remnant episode on Semblances
3081060	3083180	tells us that every single Semblance
3083180	3084800	is completely unique.
3084800	3088940	The Wielder Semblance is completely unique.
3088940	3091060	But then it turns out that Weiss's Semblance
3091060	3093440	isn't unique and the Schnee family
3093440	3095400	have the exact same Semblances
3095400	3097060	like it's in their blood or something
3097060	3099680	and her sister Winter can do the same things as her.
3099680	3101920	Every Schnee has the ability to summon.
3101920	3103260	We have for generations.
3103260	3105640	So they're unique except when they're not.
3105640	3108560	I'm glad there's a video explaining how this works,
3108560	3111220	but it would also help if the explanation made sense
3111220	3114260	and if it didn't just raise more questions also.
3114260	3115840	We Schnees are unique.
3115840	3118380	Unlike many, our Semblance is hereditary.
3118380	3121880	Winter is telling this piece of information to her sister.
3121880	3123760	She's one of the only other people
3123760	3125800	who already knows this.
3125800	3127420	This isn't how you write exposition!
3127460	3129800	I don't want to be down on the concepts themselves here.
3129800	3132160	The idea of Semblances and the idea of someone
3132160	3134420	keeping their Semblance a secret to have an advantage
3134420	3136580	or a Semblance that runs in the bloodline of a family
3136580	3138840	and gives one of our leads a reputation to live up to
3138840	3140960	are all decent things to put in a story
3140960	3143500	and they could all potentially be really interesting,
3143500	3145000	but for those things to be interesting,
3145000	3147580	they have to be actually conveyed well
3147580	3150200	and then used well in the story itself.
3150200	3152120	A good idea isn't enough.
3152120	3154840	The World of Remnant episode about the Schnee Dust Company
3154840	3156700	largely covers the life and times
3156740	3158740	of a really interesting-sounding character
3158740	3160320	who we never see in the show
3160320	3163660	and who never actually comes up by name ever.
3163660	3166700	They just invented a cool guy and made up a story about him.
3166700	3170440	You don't get story points because an idea sounded good.
3170440	3173360	In fact, it just means you lose more points by wasting it.
3173360	3176120	If you do watch all of RWBY and do enough research
3176120	3178700	and ask around on the Reddit but only once you've consulted
3178700	3180360	the wiki and watched World of Remnant,
3180360	3183480	you might finally know what the story of RWBY
3183480	3185820	was supposed to be and understand how cool
3185820	3188640	so many aspects of the plot sound in the abstract,
3188640	3191020	but you probably won't have had a good time.
3191020	3192860	You can't just tell me how good the story
3192860	3195640	or concepts might be in a side cartoon.
3195640	3197860	You have to tell me a good story.
3197860	3200060	If you try to get someone new into RWBY,
3200060	3202780	pay attention to how much you have to explain things
3202780	3203900	on the show's behalf.
3203900	3206060	Even if you like the show and think it's good
3206060	3208180	or at least gets good, thinking critically,
3208180	3210060	we have to acknowledge that it certainly takes
3210060	3210940	some getting there.
3210940	3213320	It's especially disappointing when sometimes
3213320	3215560	you can see the show setting things up quite well.
3215600	3218220	When RWBY gets done beating up the Sterling squad,
3218220	3220220	the bad guy manages to get away in a ship
3220220	3222760	even though a new lady turns up to help RWBY stop him.
3222760	3225100	I bring this up because, credit where it's due,
3225100	3227520	there is some pretty good storytelling going on here.
3227520	3230100	When this new character turns up and is wrecking shop,
3230100	3231800	Malcolm McDowellboy says...
3231800	3234140	["We got a huntress!"
3234140	3235560	And this is a really good line
3235560	3236940	because the audience is like,
3236940	3238840	that sounds neat. What's that?
3238840	3241300	I bet they're important, and then right after,
3241300	3243880	RWBY reacts like meeting a huntress is really cool.
3244000	3247700	["You're a huntress.
3247700	3249700	Can I have your autograph?"
3249700	3251740	This is a decently animated scene
3251740	3253420	but also good exposition,
3253420	3255420	especially compared to the rest of the show.
3255420	3257000	We know that hunters are a big deal
3257000	3258580	without having to be directly told
3258580	3260160	who they are or what they do,
3260160	3262040	based purely on seeing a guy react
3262040	3263840	in a kind of panic to her appearance
3263840	3265700	and how RWBY reacts herself.
3265700	3268240	It's fun and cool and doesn't bog you down
3268240	3269740	with explicit explanations,
3269740	3273240	so the writing in this sequence specifically really works.
3273280	3275400	That said, you fully learn what huntsmen
3275400	3277900	and huntresses are by sitting in a classroom
3277900	3280240	while they make a point about how this is boring
3280240	3282240	and the other characters aren't paying attention.
3282240	3284700	["Individuals who have sworn to protect
3284700	3287060	those who cannot protect themselves."
3287060	3288240	Oh, really? Wow, thanks.
3288240	3289400	This scene was worth my time.
3289400	3291160	Surely there's a more interesting way
3291160	3292820	to explain things to your audience
3292820	3294060	than with a lecture.
3294060	3295700	Besides, that's what World of Remnants'
3295700	3296980	huntsman episode is for.
3296980	3298860	What this scene with Glinda implies to me
3298860	3300600	is that someone on the writing team
3300600	3302440	did know how to write exposition
3302440	3304020	and his name was Monty Oum.
3304020	3306800	The action scenes, the ones Monty had gone off to make
3306800	3308380	while the writers wrote the other stuff,
3308380	3310680	are consistently the most interesting examples
3310680	3313100	of character writing and storytelling in the show.
3313100	3315180	In volume two, our characters are so busy
3315180	3317680	having drama or doing wacky skits
3317680	3320100	to establish why these characters are actually friends.
3320100	3321680	Did you steal my binder?
3321680	3322980	I am not a crook.
3322980	3323980	What are you talking about?
3323980	3325340	You said a dog?
3325340	3327020	And a male?
3327020	3329180	But a few episodes in, we have this big fight
3329180	3331340	where the team work together to beat a big mecha,
3331340	3334200	and in this scene, Monty does all the characterization
3334200	3335660	that could have happened in the show.
3335660	3336960	The characters' team work,
3336960	3339280	using each other's abilities in conjunction together,
3339280	3341540	is choreographed and prepared in a way
3341540	3343280	that shows the audience that these characters
3343280	3344880	have learned to work together.
3344880	3349200	Each move even gets called for by Ruby using a code word.
3349200	3350200	Freezer burn!
3350200	3351580	Checkmate!
3351580	3352920	Ladybug!
3352920	3354880	Blastoise!
3354880	3356120	We have to slow it down!
3356120	3357920	And how do you propose we do that?
3357920	3359420	Ice flowers!
3359460	3361200	Showing that she's grown and learned
3361200	3362780	to direct the team she's leading.
3362780	3364960	The audience can finally tell that these characters
3364960	3366780	have a really intimate knowledge of each other
3366780	3367620	and their skills.
3367620	3369700	These names were actually chosen by Monty
3369700	3371580	as a reference to the ship names
3371580	3373500	the fandom had come up with for the characters.
3373500	3374380	What's a ship?
3374380	3375200	Uh.
3375200	3376420	Sorry, that wasn't meant to signify
3376420	3377500	my feelings on the subject.
3377500	3380280	Well, a ship is a thing fan discussions of media
3380280	3383580	end up doing when fans want or predict characters
3383580	3385920	to end up in a relationship together.
3385920	3387740	Sometimes creators make subtle nods
3387740	3389160	to these communities in their work,
3389200	3390360	like in Steven Universe.
3390360	3392360	That one time they had a literal ship
3392360	3393520	with two characters on it.
3393520	3396280	Referencing the ship names is a little bit creepy.
3396280	3398280	Ruby is, like, 15, you know?
3398280	3400940	Ruby Rose is a 15-year-old girl.
3400940	3403440	But at least let's take careful note
3403440	3405600	of how Ruby and Yang are the only pair
3405600	3407280	that don't do a team attack here
3407280	3408660	because that would mean acknowledging
3408660	3410940	the part of your fandom that came up with a ship name
3410940	3413940	for two half-siblings, which is fucking disgusting.
3413940	3416320	In addition to being a really cool Monty fight,
3416320	3418740	we're seeing our main characters in action as a group
3418780	3420520	and learning about how they've grown together
3420520	3421520	between seasons.
3421520	3423860	Would have been nice to see them grow
3423860	3426320	in the actual show, but credit where it's due.
3426320	3428140	It's well-conveyed exposition.
3428140	3429860	You might not even notice you're learning
3429860	3431680	about the characters because you're watching them
3431680	3432940	beat up a giant robot.
3432940	3433820	It's a good scene.
3433820	3435520	Like, that's the thing about early Ruby.
3435520	3438320	It'll just keep inexplicably having good scenes
3438320	3440020	that are either super fun to watch
3440020	3442980	or work way better story-wise than anything around them,
3442980	3444900	and usually it's the action sequences
3444900	3447560	which somehow manage to outright the writing
3447640	3449640	of the scenes the writers came up with.
3449640	3450640	Here's another example.
3450640	3452060	As we've mentioned, the bad guys
3452060	3454140	finding out Pyrrha's semblance is a big deal,
3454140	3456640	but since this discovery is made during a fight,
3456640	3459920	it's done really well using animation and artistry.
3459920	3461840	Mercury has a sparring match with Pyrrha
3461840	3464460	and the action is shot to focus specifically
3464460	3466340	on the attention Mercury is paying
3466340	3467760	to how she moves and fights,
3467760	3469460	like he's trying to figure her out.
3469460	3472040	Then when she tries to stealthily use her semblance
3472040	3475000	to avoid one of his attacks, he notices what she's doing.
3475000	3477000	It was actually animated by Shane Neuville
3477020	3478780	whose grasp of using animation
3478780	3480480	to tell a story is really good.
3480480	3482480	In the director's commentary track for this scene,
3482480	3485160	the whole team can't not gush about the work he does.
3485160	3486360	Was this Shane? This is all Shane.
3486360	3487940	Yeah. This is all Shane layering
3487940	3489400	in that tiny little stuff where it's like
3489400	3490660	he got the tone of the fight.
3490660	3492400	He knew what this was about. Yeah, man.
3492400	3493740	The way they were able to read each other
3493740	3495200	and the movements. Barring the kicks
3495200	3496660	and flips and everything, it's just there's so much
3496660	3498040	going on, like, in the performance.
3498040	3499400	It's like a silent dialogue scene.
3499400	3500540	Oh, my god. I love this.
3500540	3501740	We're looking at their faces
3501740	3503740	and seeing them examine things.
3503740	3506200	It's a really strongly characterized scene
3507200	3508860	Also, I got that reference.
3508860	3510600	Good one, Shane. Compare and contrast
3510600	3513440	with when the bad guys actually discuss Pyrrha's power
3513440	3515060	and they're just sitting around going,
3515060	3517240	oh, she can control magnets.
3517240	3520160	It's called polarity which I also know somehow.
3520160	3523200	Like, it's so weird that really well-told scenes
3523200	3524360	are right next to this.
3524360	3527120	Scenes made by Monty and Shane feel like pieces
3527120	3530280	of a much better or at least better told show
3530280	3533700	trapped next to this stuff and outside of the fights,
3533700	3536200	the animation is, well...
3538700	3539700	Cut it out!
3539700	3540700	I'm gonna get him!
3540700	3541700	Oh!
3541700	3542700	Come on!
3545200	3547700	We have big plans for you, Roman.
3547700	3550200	The fuck? Is that just fucking concept art?
3550200	3552700	If you want to really unproductively hate Ruby
3552700	3554700	all day forever, you know, if for some reason
3554700	3556940	you've decided it's your job to be angry
3556940	3560120	and sad all your life, there's tons of animation problems
3560120	3562700	or ugly sequences or shots to poke fun at
3562700	3564200	but talking about them in this video
3564200	3567200	seems like a distraction because the show looking perfect
3567200	3570200	wouldn't fix its core writing and storytelling problems
3570200	3572500	and I've enjoyed much worse looking shows
3572500	3574200	because they told a better story.
3574200	3576700	The biggest problem with the show isn't the animation
3576700	3577700	surrounding these fights.
3577700	3579700	It's the story surrounding these fights.
3579700	3581700	It's the way these fights are being connected
3581700	3584040	or rather not connected by the writing.
3584040	3585700	A useful thing to know is that while working
3585700	3588200	on Red vs. Blue, the script would have gaps in it
3588200	3590200	marked Monty action sequence here.
3590200	3593200	I would then find places in that script,
3593200	3596200	places within between the lines in that table read
3596200	3598200	and start inserting my sequences in the parts
3598200	3600200	where Bernie's script would say
3600200	3601700	Monty action sequence here.
3601700	3604200	Red vs. Blue had a script but how exactly
3604200	3606700	the fights looked was entirely up to Monty
3606700	3608700	since he was the best at deciding that stuff.
3608700	3610200	While the rest of the show was being made
3610200	3612200	in the traditional machinima style
3612200	3614200	in the Halo games themselves, Monty was making
3614200	3616700	the best possible fight he could and these pieces
3616700	3619200	of the show joined together at the end of this process
3619200	3620200	pretty organically.
3620200	3623200	Early RWBY was made using a fairly similar principle.
3623200	3625700	The three main creators had agreed on the story
3625700	3627700	in the broad strokes and then Monty was doing
3627700	3630200	the fights in the same way but with the writers
3630200	3632200	actually writing out the plot they'd agreed upon
3632200	3634700	while Monty was making the action sequences.
3634700	3636700	To give an example, the first fight takes place
3636700	3639200	in a street environment so they wrote the dust store robbery
3639200	3642200	and then as quickly as possible moved the events outside
3642200	3645200	to connect with the street fight and then up to the rooftops
3645200	3646700	to connect to another Monty fight.
3646700	3648200	You can see this in the version of the show
3648200	3650200	on the DVD extras where they show episode one
3650200	3651200	with the storyboards.
3651200	3653200	Everything the main crew were working on
3653200	3654700	had been written and had storyboards
3654700	3656700	so the animators knew what visuals to go for
3656700	3658700	and then when Monty's cool fights are happening,
3658700	3661200	the storyboard is just a black card that reads
3661200	3663700	Monty action and given what his fights were like,
3663700	3666200	three exclamation marks is appropriate.
3666200	3668700	The we got a Huntress part I praised earlier
3668700	3671700	was also a Monty action sequence on the storyboard
3671700	3674200	so it's likely Monty came up with the idea
3674200	3676200	to have Torchwick say words to this effect
3676200	3678700	and not the writers whose best idea
3678700	3680200	for conveying what a Huntress is
3680200	3683200	is to have a professor tell our Huntresses in training
3683200	3685700	in a classroom as if they've never been told before
3685700	3688700	even though they're going to a school for Huntresses
3688700	3691700	and then to write a side cartoon telling you again.
3691700	3693200	In another good example when the characters
3693200	3694700	are being tested in the woods,
3694700	3696700	the characters all get their individual plot lines
3696700	3698200	and then when it's time for the big Monty fight
3698200	3700200	designed to happen at this point in the story,
3700200	3702200	we get this insert shot of the characters running
3702200	3704200	to the specific location where Monty's fight was done.
3704200	3706200	Now this is one of the standout action sequences
3706200	3708200	of Monty's career. It's really good.
3708200	3710200	It's one of my favorite animated sequences
3710200	3712200	in basically anything. It's just great
3712200	3716200	but really disappointingly due to some strange writing choices,
3716200	3718200	it doesn't actually connect to the story
3718200	3720200	that was just happening because the gang's plan
3720200	3722200	at this point was to run away
3722200	3724200	from the big monsters attacking them.
3724200	3726200	There's no point in fighting these things.
3726200	3727700	Run and live.
3727700	3729200	That is an idea I can get behind.
3729200	3732200	But as soon as Monty fight mode begins,
3732200	3733700	it's like they were leading them here
3733700	3735200	to have a proper place to fight them.
3735200	3737200	I'm assuming Monty and the writers had decided
3737200	3739200	on this fight in a very broad way
3739200	3741700	like during the trial the gang fights some giant monsters
3741700	3743700	and it's really cool and Monty made this fight
3743700	3746200	thinking the writers would come up with an explanation
3746200	3748200	but the explanation ended up being,
3748200	3749700	let's run away.
3749700	3751200	There's no point in fighting these things.
3751200	3754200	Ah, I don't know how to make this clear enough.
3754200	3757700	That is the one thing that you do not write
3757700	3761200	immediately before cutting to a fight against them
3761200	3763200	and the worst part is this is probably
3763200	3765700	the most seamless connection between the story
3765700	3767700	and action the show manages to do
3767700	3769700	because you can at least, like, assume
3769700	3771700	that their means of escape got cut off
3771700	3773700	or they got too close and they had to fight
3773700	3776200	but when they have several characters agree to run away
3776200	3778200	and they say they're going to run away,
3778200	3781200	having them just kind of stop, it's very strange.
3781200	3783200	Another really strange thing you start to notice
3783200	3785200	when you try and keep track of how the fights
3785200	3787700	are being connected is that character arcs seem to start
3787700	3789700	and then suddenly stop on a whim.
3789700	3791700	When the characters get sorted into teams,
3791700	3793700	Ruby is made the leader of Team Ruby
3793700	3796200	and this annoys Weiss who thinks Ruby isn't very smart
3796200	3799200	or good and who she argued with a lot during the test
3799200	3801700	but then during the test, Weiss decided to be nicer?
3801700	3804700	I'll be...nicer.
3804700	3807200	But she's mad again now because she wanted to be the leader.
3807200	3808700	This seems like it's going to set up
3808700	3810200	interesting character tensions,
3810200	3811700	maybe a developing friendship
3811700	3813700	with emotional speed bumps along the way
3813700	3815700	but it's resolved instantly when Weiss complains
3815700	3817200	to a professor and they say,
3818200	3819200	That's preposterous.
3819200	3821200	And Weiss decides to be nice.
3821200	3825200	I am going to be the best teammate you will ever have.
3825200	3828200	I'll be...nicer.
3828200	3829200	Problem solved.
3829200	3830200	Writing!
3830200	3832200	Like, all Weiss needed was for a man in a position
3832200	3834200	of authority to give her a good telling off.
3834200	3836200	Your exceptional skill on the battlefield
3836200	3838200	is matched only by your poor attitude.
3838200	3840200	Just so you know, Weiss' main character arc
3840200	3842200	is about her relationship with her abusive
3842200	3844700	and controlling father so the idea this is what she needed
3844700	3846200	is actually kind of gross.
3846200	3848200	Me, personally, I still don't see it as a big deal.
3848200	3849200	I'm just like, I don't see them as like,
3849200	3851200	these are four females that are awesome.
3851200	3854200	I'm like, no, these are just four cool kids that are fun.
3854200	3856200	Can't really think of any moment really
3856200	3858200	where we sat down and we're like, okay,
3858200	3860200	this is happening or we want this to happen
3860200	3861200	because they are female.
3861200	3863200	Yeah, no, it's always just been like,
3863200	3864200	it's just like, they're four people.
3864200	3865200	They're awkward teenagers.
3865200	3867200	Hey, hashtag RWBY fans.
3867200	3868200	Have you heard?
3868200	3870700	Yang Xiaolong is going to fight Tifa Lockhart.
3870700	3872200	My money's on the hot one.
3872200	3874200	All right, so we've got Yang Xiaolong.
3874200	3877200	She is the bubbly one on the bunch.
3877200	3878200	She's just so happy.
3878200	3880200	She's the party girl.
3880200	3882200	She's, you know, pretty much everything
3882200	3883200	everybody wants in a girl.
3883200	3886200	So they brought back the interesting character conflict
3886200	3889200	of the test then re-resolved it right away.
3889200	3892200	This is like watching a learner driver stall their car.
3892200	3894200	Like, come on, you almost got a story going.
3894200	3895200	Just, just keep going at it.
3895200	3897200	Immediately after having a character
3897200	3899200	just give up on what their character arc should have been,
3899200	3901200	the plot suddenly switches gears
3901200	3902200	and focuses on someone else.
3902200	3903200	Wait, gears?
3903200	3904200	And then it was the stall the car thing.
3904200	3906200	Was that a deliberate metaphor?
3906200	3907200	No, that was an accident. I'm sorry.
3907200	3909200	Thus begins the Xion arc.
3909200	3911200	A big portion of volume one,
3911200	3914200	four of the show's first 16 episodes,
3914200	3915200	is about how Xion actually forged
3915200	3918200	his anime college transcript to get into this school
3918200	3921200	which makes him the deepest character we've met so far.
3921200	3922200	Wow, who'd have thought?
3922200	3924200	And then he gets bullied by a generic mean guy
3924200	3926200	who threatens to tell people his secret
3926200	3927200	and get him kicked out,
3927200	3928200	but then he stands up to him
3928200	3929200	and saves him from a big grim,
3929200	3932200	and now he respects him so he won't share his secret.
3932200	3934200	That's the solution to bullying, kids.
3934200	3935200	Save them from a monster
3935200	3937200	and maybe they'll leave you alone
3937200	3938200	out of respect.
3938200	3940200	Xion finally asks Pyrrha for the help
3940200	3941200	she was offering him
3941200	3943200	instead of pointlessly refusing it,
3943200	3944200	and it becomes kind of clear
3944200	3945200	Pyrrha's working really hard on this guy
3945200	3947200	because she's into him for some reason.
3947200	3949200	This multi-episode break
3949200	3952200	from covering any of the main characters of RWBY?
3952200	3954200	You know, it's in the name.
3954200	3956200	To focus on one of the lead writer's characters
3956200	3957200	certainly seems strange,
3957200	3959200	but what makes the pace even stranger
3959200	3961200	is that once those episodes are done,
3961200	3962200	there are two episodes left
3962200	3964200	and they have to now connect the story
3964200	3966200	to this final fight scene in a shipyard starring,
3966200	3968200	and I can't stress this enough,
3968200	3972200	two characters who have not yet appeared in the show.
3972200	3974200	Oops!
3974200	3976200	So the next episode starts and, uh,
3976200	3978200	here's Sun. He's here now.
3978200	3979200	And then while chasing him,
3979200	3981200	the gang randomly runs into,
3981200	3984200	no, literally runs into Penny,
3984200	3986200	the other character who they forgot to put in earlier
3986200	3988200	because there was just nothing you could have cut
3988200	3990200	to establish these characters sooner.
3990200	3992200	This pure gold just has to stay in.
3992200	3994200	So now these characters are here just in time
3994200	3995200	for the climactic fight.
3995200	3998200	Sun's stick that turns into nunchucks
3998200	4000200	that are also guns is so fun to watch.
4000200	4002200	It's just amazing.
4002200	4004200	However, because of the frankly bizarre pacing
4004200	4006200	caused by the show's production,
4006200	4008200	I have barely any idea who most
4008200	4010200	of the characters involved even are,
4010200	4012200	which affects my engagement somewhat.
4012200	4013200	It's a really cool scene,
4013200	4015200	but it feels very disconnected
4015200	4016200	from the rest of the story.
4016200	4018200	Now, exactly how this problem got here
4018200	4021200	isn't something it feels fair to speculate about too hard.
4021200	4023200	I'm sure you could easily conclude that the three
4023200	4025200	agreed on a story and then the writers just messed up,
4025200	4027200	making the plot feel like a cohesive hole
4027200	4029200	with the action sequences, and writing-wise,
4029200	4031200	the show feels very idiosyncratic
4031200	4033200	and self-conscious, like it's looking for something
4033200	4036200	to spend its time doing before the next fight
4036200	4038200	and therefore misspending the time
4038200	4040200	that would have added context and character
4040200	4041200	to those fights until it's too late
4041200	4043200	to really do that stuff properly,
4043200	4045200	but at the same time, some behind-the-scenes material
4045200	4047200	and panels and stuff seem to imply that Monty went away
4047200	4049200	and then came back with new characters
4049200	4051200	and action sequences for them and dropped it
4051200	4053200	on Miles and Kerry with little to no notice.
4053200	4055200	However this disconnect got here,
4055200	4057200	it's not very good and relates
4057200	4059200	to some serious production problems.
4059200	4061200	Like, if your main creative leads aren't on the same page
4061200	4063200	about what's happening in the story,
4063200	4065200	the story's probably not gonna wind up very good,
4065200	4067200	and also the way a huge swath of the show
4067200	4069200	isn't about Team RWBY
4069200	4071200	and their plot line evaporates
4071200	4073200	to make way for the adventures of some guy,
4073200	4075200	the writers don't seem to be handling
4075200	4077200	the story they did know they were supposed to do
4077200	4078200	that well either.
4078200	4080200	It certainly doesn't make it look any better
4080200	4082200	that the guy is voiced by one of them.
4082200	4083200	Oh, and then in volume two,
4083200	4085200	they correct for this problem
4085200	4087200	by adding a second author insert?
4087200	4089200	Uh...
4089200	4091200	So a guy called Neptune turns up.
4091200	4093200	He's a really cool, attractive guy who wears goggles,
4093200	4095200	and they make a point of showing how wise
4095200	4097200	is into him, like, right away.
4097200	4099200	Let's not assume that this is, like, author insert
4099200	4101200	wish fulfillment or whatever.
4101200	4103200	Like, let's assume they just came up with this character
4103200	4105200	and then Kerry Shawcross decided to voice him.
4105200	4107200	Like, hey, if you're writing a whole show,
4107200	4108200	you should get to voice one of the characters.
4108200	4109200	That's fine.
4109200	4110200	But come on.
4110200	4112200	It was really weird that you picked Neptune, man.
4112200	4114200	This character gets into love triangle stuff
4114200	4117200	with a bunch of young female characters
4117200	4119200	who you write,
4119200	4121200	so it just feels weird,
4121200	4124200	and then this character hangs out a bunch with Yang.
4124200	4125200	You know.
4125200	4127200	Pretty much everything everybody wants in a girl.
4127200	4129200	Oh, what a woman.
4129200	4130200	Uh, she's 17, so...
4130200	4133200	And yeah, in volume two, the plot pauses itself
4133200	4135200	for a shockingly long amount of time
4135200	4137200	to have an arc where our characters prepare
4137200	4139200	for the school prom and figure out who's inviting who
4139200	4141200	because Weiss wants to go with Neptune
4141200	4143200	but Jaune wants to go with Weiss
4143200	4144200	but Pyrrha wants to go with Jaune
4144200	4146200	and she can't bring herself to ask it,
4146200	4148200	so whenever something in the show happens
4148200	4149200	that's really strangely explained
4149200	4151200	and you wish got, like, told to you better,
4151200	4153200	remember that they had time to do it
4153200	4155200	and spent it writing scenes
4155200	4157200	where the two characters voiced by them
4157200	4158200	hang out at a prom.
4158200	4160200	Hey, guys, you know when you were talking
4160200	4162200	about needing to get exposition across as best you could?
4162200	4163200	Put it here.
4163200	4165200	Put naturalistic exposition in the scenes
4165200	4167200	where this fucking prom would have gone.
4167200	4169200	The prom stuff isn't even necessarily bad either.
4169200	4171200	It's nice seeing the sweet dance animations
4171200	4173200	Monty did for it.
4173200	4175200	He was a big fan of animating dancing along with fights
4175200	4177200	and it's cool seeing this stuff in RWBY too
4177200	4179200	and a lot of the character and relationship stuff
4179200	4182200	happening in the prom scenes is, like, fine.
4182200	4184200	The problem with the scene is even if it's perfect,
4184200	4186200	it's yet another thing that's happening
4186200	4187200	instead of a story.
4187200	4189200	It just becomes aggravating knowing
4189200	4191200	you're watching all of this and basically still waiting
4191200	4193200	for the plot to start again,
4193200	4194200	and you know how it starts again?
4194200	4196200	Well, right at the end of the episode
4196200	4198200	before the final two of the season,
4198200	4201200	the ground suddenly opens up under Ruby's feet
4201200	4204200	and she falls into the plot.
4204200	4206200	Watching this show knowing that it had a creative lead
4206200	4209200	and two writers and the plot consisted
4209200	4212200	of a bunch of people fucking about going to the prom
4212200	4215200	and not doing much else for most of the season?
4215200	4218200	Like, seriously, what were you doing?
4218200	4220200	It turns out there's an entire dead
4220200	4222200	underground civilization the bad guy
4222200	4224200	and his goons are doing an evil plan in
4224200	4226200	but the next fights that Monty was making
4226200	4229200	were a series of fights on and in a train
4229200	4231200	riffing on the ideas he'd had during the black trailer
4231200	4234200	and those scenes are supposed to happen now
4234200	4236200	so the dead, destroyed civilization
4236200	4238200	that Ruby just fell into
4238200	4240200	has a working rail network with a train in it.
4240200	4242200	This is another instance of there's no point
4242200	4244200	in fighting these things.
4244200	4246200	Like, instead of the plot leading organically
4246200	4247200	into the fights on the train,
4247200	4249200	the train is just there
4249200	4251200	when it needs to be in the story.
4251200	4254200	I feel like there might have been a slightly easier way
4254200	4256200	of getting the characters onto a train.
4256200	4258200	That's all I'm saying, but once we get there,
4258200	4260200	the actual action sequences on the train
4260200	4261200	are really well done.
4261200	4263200	Monty and Shane and the rest of the team
4263200	4265200	do some really stellar work here.
4266200	4267200	Oh!
4273200	4275200	The Zwei scene from yesterday was Shane Neuville's idea.
4275200	4277200	Blame him. Thank you, Shane.
4277200	4278200	That scene was amazing.
4278200	4279200	Oh, and thank you, Harley Dwartz
4279200	4281200	who Shane says helped.
4281200	4284200	This is the second best shot in the entire show ever
4284200	4285200	of all time.
4285200	4287200	Ha ha! Do you get it? Do you get it?
4287200	4290200	And I wish the writing and story had the kind of energy
4290200	4292200	the animators were capable of manifesting.
4292200	4293200	There is this one really cool fight
4293200	4296200	between Yang and Neo, a character fans love
4296200	4298200	because her deal is she doesn't talk
4298200	4300200	and therefore cannot be ruined by the writers.
4300200	4301200	She actually beats Yang,
4301200	4303200	and then a strange warrior woman
4303200	4305200	we don't know at all turns up to protect her,
4305200	4308200	and Neo is so fuck-off scared of whoever this lady is
4308200	4310200	that she's like, nope, peace out,
4310200	4311200	and then the lady leaves.
4311200	4313200	It's really cool and mysterious,
4313200	4315200	but there is one teeny issue with this scene,
4315200	4319200	and that's the really good music that plays during it.
4319200	4327200	♪
4327200	4329200	This is genuinely a pretty awesome track.
4329200	4331200	It really builds tension and mystery
4331200	4333200	for what's going on with this character
4333200	4334200	and what her deal is.
4334200	4336200	This track is also the best piece of music
4336200	4338200	that Jeff Williams didn't make.
4338200	4340200	Well, that's not fair to say. That's kind of mean,
4340200	4342200	but when I first heard this song,
4342200	4343200	I couldn't get it out of my head,
4343200	4345200	and I realized that I couldn't
4345200	4347200	because I'd heard it a bunch somewhere else before,
4347200	4349200	and then I remembered that I spent most of 2014
4349200	4351200	listening to the soundtrack to the Godzilla movie
4351200	4353200	that came out that year.
4353200	4365200	♪
4365200	4367200	They found the bones of the Godzilla soundtrack,
4367200	4371200	and they rebuilt him into Midi-Godzilla.
4371200	4373200	Now, I'm not saying this is plagiarism or anything.
4373200	4375200	These songs are just incredibly similar
4375200	4377200	because they're both very generic,
4377200	4379200	but I do kind of secretly hope that they got the idea
4379200	4381200	from the Godzilla movie because I love finding
4381200	4384200	other secret Godzilla fans out there.
4384200	4386200	Oh, Shin Godzilla was so good, wasn't it?
4386200	4387200	The train crashes into the city,
4387200	4389200	so a bunch of grim attack people.
4389200	4391200	♪
4391200	4392200	All our main characters work together
4392200	4394200	to beat up some monsters for a while.
4394200	4396200	Oh, look, a reference to Haloid,
4396200	4398200	which was itself a reference to the Matrix.
4398200	4399200	I love it.
4399200	4401200	It's a pretty good end to a volume, you know,
4401200	4404200	defending a city from a bunch of monsters.
4404200	4405200	Ah.
4405200	4407200	And then Team Coffee shows up.
4407200	4409200	Team Coffee, four characters
4409200	4412200	who've barely been on screen until this exact moment
4412200	4415200	and only get mentioned in passing like once,
4415200	4418200	appear and heroically single-handedly kill
4418200	4420200	almost all the grim in a matter of seconds.
4420200	4423200	I absolutely love the music for this fight.
4423200	4430200	♪
4430200	4431200	Uh, it's awful.
4431200	4433200	It's objectively a terrible song,
4433200	4434200	but I love it.
4434200	4436200	It's like if the Sonic Adventure soundtracks
4436200	4438200	vomited into my mouth and I want it.
4438200	4440200	This is the climactic action sequence
4440200	4442200	of the volume, by the way.
4442200	4443200	Monsters attack the city,
4443200	4446200	and four other characters turn up
4446200	4447200	and save the day.
4447200	4450200	That's the...that's the story!
4450200	4452200	Once again, a bunch of characters we barely know
4452200	4454200	are starring in the climactic fight
4454200	4455200	of a season of the show.
4455200	4457200	Who the hell is this guy?
4457200	4458200	What are his weapons?
4458200	4459200	Why does he look like that?
4459200	4460200	What is the point of having a story
4460200	4462200	if this is how it ends every season?
4462200	4464200	If I wanted context-free fighting,
4464200	4466200	I'd watch Dead Fantasy again.
4466200	4469200	The whole point of RWBY is that there were writers
4469200	4471200	helping make it something more than that,
4471200	4474200	connect the fights in an organic and meaningful way.
4474200	4476200	RWBY could have just been a collection
4476200	4479200	of fun fights uploaded on a YouTube channel,
4479200	4482200	and all it would have lost is several hours of baggage.
4482200	4484200	You just destroyed my favorite clothing store.
4484200	4487200	Oh, you can barely tell a man wrote this.
4487200	4489200	There's one particular strange moment in this scene
4489200	4491200	that really encapsulates the problems the writer...
4491200	4493200	the problems the writing is having.
4493200	4495200	Why do I write such long sentences?
4495200	4496200	This character, the bunny girl
4496200	4498200	who appeared very briefly in season one,
4498200	4499200	her name is Velvet.
4499200	4502200	She has a weird case that's got her weapon hidden in it,
4502200	4504200	and when she goes to use it in the fight,
4504200	4505200	her leader, who's a name I had to Google
4505200	4507200	because I don't think we're told it until the next season,
4507200	4509200	no, I'm not gonna tell you what it is,
4509200	4510200	says...
4510200	4511200	Hey, come on.
4511200	4514200	You spent all semester building that up.
4514200	4515200	Don't waste it here.
4515200	4517200	...and proceeds to do all the killing herself
4517200	4520200	with her cool minigun bag thing.
4520200	4521200	It's great.
4521200	4522200	This line is meant to be, like,
4522200	4525200	a funny nod to the audience, right?
4525200	4527200	Like, we've been building that up for ages.
4527200	4528200	Let's not waste it now.
4528200	4529200	It's meant to be a funny joke,
4529200	4532200	but the problem is that joke requires the setup
4532200	4535200	of us having seen that Velvet has a weapon
4535200	4537200	and wanting to find out what it is,
4537200	4539200	but because the story's writing has been so mismanaged,
4539200	4543200	Velvet has been on screen for literally seconds
4543200	4544200	in the show so far.
4544200	4546200	The clip of Velvet you're seeing right now,
4546200	4549200	this is her only appearance in volume two.
4549200	4550200	She just walked off screen, right?
4550200	4551200	She's gone. That's it.
4551200	4552200	See you in the climax.
4552200	4554200	So all we get is this scene of the group
4554200	4556200	leaving for a mission and another character
4556200	4558200	mentioning they sure have been away
4558200	4559200	on that mission for a while.
4559200	4562200	Team Coffee's away mission lasted longer than expected.
4562200	4565200	We don't know who this character is.
4565200	4567200	The joke about Velvet's weapon combined with her
4567200	4569200	and her team's sparse appearance in the show
4569200	4571200	despite saving the day at the end
4571200	4573200	is perhaps the clearest look
4573200	4575200	into the early show's production problems.
4575200	4577200	Was this scene planned in advance
4577200	4579200	and then the writers didn't have room
4579200	4581200	to give Team Coffee a place in the story
4581200	4583200	because there was already too many characters to handle
4583200	4584200	and all the prom stuff?
4584200	4587200	Did Monty and co. suddenly drop the climactic fight
4587200	4589200	on the rest of the creators at the last minute
4589200	4590200	and then they had to scramble
4590200	4592200	to give it any sort of last minute justification?
4592200	4595200	Did the creative leads all mutually agree
4595200	4597200	that the best way to end a season of the show
4597200	4600200	was for it to star a bunch of random new characters?
4600200	4602200	I don't know, and it doesn't feel right to speculate,
4602200	4603200	but I do know that the way things are
4603200	4605200	means the story sucks.
4605200	4607200	The plot scenes of the show feel so weightless
4607200	4609200	and contribute so little to the thing
4609200	4611200	that really works, the fights,
4611200	4614200	that the story ends up being basically an afterthought.
4614200	4616200	I do have to say, though, it does look like
4616200	4618200	at some point in the production process
4618200	4620200	Team Coffee, or at least Velvet,
4620200	4622200	were meant to play a larger role in the show
4622200	4624200	and there is evidence that suggests this.
4624200	4626200	The behind-the-scenes production diaries for volume two
4626200	4629200	spend a lot of time specifically covering
4629200	4631200	the creation and development of Velvet.
4631200	4632200	So we thought we would introduce you
4632200	4634200	to the various parts of the production pipeline
4634200	4636200	by following the supporting character of Velvet
4636200	4638200	that we introduced in volume one
4638200	4640200	and follow her from concept to modeling
4640200	4642200	and how she comes to life in the recording booth
4642200	4644200	and in the animation and in the edit.
4644200	4646200	They sifted through hundreds of fan submissions.
4646200	4648200	Over 1,300 submissions.
4648200	4651200	We see the modelers and rigging and artists
4651200	4652200	working on her and her weapons.
4652200	4654200	We see the effort that goes into designing
4654200	4655200	the case for her cool weapon,
4655200	4657200	but we don't want to spoil what's in it.
4657200	4659200	So this is what her weapon's gonna be in.
4659200	4660200	We're not showing the weapon yet,
4660200	4662200	because you're not gonna see that yet.
4662200	4664200	But we need something for her to carry it in.
4664200	4666200	You know, as if to imply that at some point in the show,
4666200	4669200	we would see Velvet have a box with the weapon in it
4669200	4671200	and people go, ooh, what's in it?
4671200	4672200	And she'd be like, ah, you'll see.
4672200	4674200	We meet the voice actress, all of this stuff.
4674200	4677200	Hours and hours of multiple artists
4677200	4680200	putting time and attention into creating this character
4680200	4682200	and all of this work goes into the creation
4682200	4686200	of a character who, due to some kind of natural disaster,
4686200	4690200	is on screen for, like, 30 seconds maximum
4690200	4693200	and does nothing just to give you a sense
4693200	4696200	of how miserably mismanaged the writing was.
4696200	4699200	Velvet is speaking for about 14 seconds
4699200	4701200	of volume two of RWBY.
4701200	4703200	I just showed you all of it.
4703200	4705200	The interview with the voice actress
4705200	4707200	in the behind-the-scenes material is longer than that.
4707200	4710200	I think volume two might have needed a second draft.
4710200	4713200	This fight is technically really cool looking
4713200	4715200	and I really enjoy the animation,
4715200	4717200	especially this bit where the Grimm's legs flip out,
4717200	4719200	but imagine how much better the scene would have felt
4719200	4721200	if you knew who these characters were
4721200	4725200	or if this fight felt at all like part of a story,
4725200	4726200	you know?
4726200	4728200	It turns out that even compared to Machinima,
4728200	4731200	making an animated series is, like, really hard.
4731200	4733200	A whole ton of people have to work together
4733200	4736200	as part of a huge process to get this thing made.
4736200	4739200	And RWBY is a higher level of production
4739200	4741200	than any other show we've ever produced.
4741200	4743200	And if the process isn't being managed very well
4743200	4745200	or the big picture ideas aren't there,
4745200	4747200	then the resulting show suffers massively.
4747200	4749200	There are tons of scenes in the show
4749200	4751200	that are fairly decent, especially the fights,
4751200	4753200	but because of issues with putting the show together,
4753200	4756200	the result is a show that's less than the sum of its parts
4756200	4760200	and what feels like two full seasons of teething problems.
4760200	4761200	You know, there are lots of shows with, like,
4761200	4764200	fun fights to watch like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
4764200	4765200	which I brought up earlier,
4765200	4767200	but the thing about those shows is
4767200	4769200	even when I remember the really cool fights,
4769200	4771200	I go back and watch entire episodes
4771200	4772200	or arcs of the show again.
4772200	4773200	I don't just go like,
4773200	4774200	oh, remember that fight? That fight's good.
4774200	4776200	Let's just watch that out of context.
4776200	4777200	Like, no, the storytelling is part
4777200	4779200	of what accentuates those scenes.
4779200	4781200	Fights in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure feel meaningful
4781200	4783200	because they've been built up to by the plot.
4783200	4786200	Monty's fights are still some of the coolest fights,
4786200	4788200	but they're never gonna have the impact they could have done
4788200	4790200	because either due to a lack of planning
4790200	4793200	of what the story would be or very poor writing choices
4793200	4795200	being made in connecting his action sequences,
4795200	4798200	the story these fights should have been a part of
4798200	4800200	is practically non-existent,
4800200	4802200	and honestly, it just seems like such a waste, you know?
4802200	4804200	So far we've mostly talked about the production
4804200	4806200	and execution angle of RWBY,
4806200	4808200	the telling of the story, the conveyance of the world,
4808200	4810200	and how well the writers incorporated
4810200	4811200	the action sequences,
4811200	4813200	but now we need to dig one layer deeper
4813200	4816200	and discuss the story they're trying to tell.
4816200	4818200	Remember that first fight in the dust store
4818200	4821200	and how I talked about how it is kind of a good idea
4821200	4822200	for an introductory scene?
4822200	4824200	Because introducing your protagonist
4824200	4826200	by having them stop a robbery is a good idea
4826200	4827200	for an opening.
4827200	4828200	In fact, it's a good intro
4828200	4830200	in the movie they got this idea from.
4830200	4832200	Oh, plot twist!
4832200	4834200	["Planet of the Apes"]
4834200	4835200	["Planet of the Apes"]
4835200	4837200	Cowboy Bebop is a great anime.
4837200	4839200	It's a 26-episode series,
4839200	4840200	and it also has a feature-length movie.
4840200	4842200	In the movie, they reintroduce
4842200	4843200	the main characters from the show
4843200	4844200	by having there be a convenience store
4844200	4846200	getting held up at gunpoint,
4846200	4847200	and Spike, the main character,
4847200	4849200	comes in with headphones on and shops around
4849200	4851200	pretending he can't tell what's going on
4851200	4852200	before expertly taking them all out
4852200	4854200	with some backup from his friend.
4854200	4856200	This is a really good opening scene.
4856200	4858200	The problem with RWBY is that its writers
4858200	4860200	didn't seem to know why it was a good opening.
4860200	4862200	This opening works well in the movie
4862200	4863200	because it takes the opportunity
4863200	4865200	to tell us about our characters
4865200	4866200	and how they think.
4866200	4868200	Spike tells a guy holding an old woman hostage
4868200	4870200	that he doesn't care if he shoots her.
4870200	4872200	Sorry, lady, but we don't protect or serve.
4872200	4874200	This is strictly business.
4874200	4875200	What?
4875200	4877200	Guess you'll just have to chalk it up to bad luck.
4877200	4878200	Which makes you think, oh, wow,
4878200	4880200	maybe this guy has no real regard for human life,
4880200	4882200	but then it turns out he did that
4882200	4884200	to get the guy to turn his gun on him
4884200	4885200	in order to save the lady's life,
4885200	4887200	so really he has no regard for his own life
4887200	4889200	and will gladly put himself in extra danger
4889200	4891200	if it means it might help someone else.
4891200	4893200	This scene is good because it's what we call
4893200	4894200	characterization.
4894200	4896200	We're learning about our main character
4896200	4897200	and how he thinks.
4897200	4899200	The action is well animated and nice looking,
4899200	4901200	but that's secondary to the experience
4901200	4903200	of learning about our characters.
4903200	4905200	We're learning how little Spike values his own life.
4905200	4907200	If you keep on pushing it like this,
4907200	4910200	you're really going to get cut down to size for good.
4910200	4911200	Sorry.
4911200	4913200	I'm not exactly the delicate, cautious type.
4913200	4915200	In the show, we have a lot of time
4915200	4917200	to learn in detail that Spike has embraced
4917200	4919200	a very specific philosophy toward his life.
4919200	4922200	Whatever happens, happens.
4922200	4925200	And he doesn't even really see himself as alive,
4925200	4927200	and this enables him to more easily throw himself
4927200	4929200	at life or death situations.
4929200	4931200	How he got this way is part of the story.
4931200	4933200	The movie sets up this part of his character
4933200	4935200	incredibly quickly for people who didn't see the show
4935200	4937200	or refreshes people who need a reminder
4937200	4939200	by showing how he saves a woman's life
4939200	4941200	by making sure it's him being shot at instead.
4941200	4943200	We're seeing a dimension of his character
4943200	4945200	which the rest of the story is going to go on to explore.
4945200	4948200	What does a man who doesn't value his own life
4948200	4950200	do with his life other than constantly risk it
4950200	4952200	in ways he didn't have to?
4952200	4954200	Is this a heroic trait or is it a bit sad
4954200	4956200	to constantly live this way?
4956200	4958200	Welcome to the core themes of Cowboy Bebop.
4958200	4960200	I mean, the movie's literally called
4960200	4961200	Knocking on Heaven's Door.
4961200	4963200	Like, the film's about these ideas.
4963200	4965200	This robbery doesn't really have anything
4965200	4967200	to do with the plot at all.
4967200	4969200	It's an unrelated opening scene,
4969200	4971200	but Cowboy Bebop's scene is better storytelling
4971200	4973200	because it is telling you things
4973200	4975200	and you are learning something
4975200	4977200	and your brain is thinking about it.
4977200	4979200	I wanna know more about what Spike's deal is.
4979200	4981200	I wanna see what he does next.
4981200	4984200	What does Ruby set up about Ruby in this first scene?
4984200	4987200	Well, she's reading weapon magazine
4987200	4989200	and actually distracted instead of pretending
4989200	4992200	which I guess shows us that she likes weapons a lot
4992200	4994200	and she's still a child who doesn't pay much attention
4994200	4995200	to her surroundings.
4995200	4997200	We also see she's a really strong fighter.
4997200	4999200	For example, without taking her weapon out,
4999200	5001200	using her bare hands,
5001200	5003200	she beats the shit out of two guys
5003200	5005200	bigger than her and sends them flying.
5005200	5007200	Remember this part. I'm gonna do a thing.
5007200	5009200	This isn't really much characterization.
5009200	5012200	Events in stories, even in intensive action sequences,
5012200	5015200	are compelling largely because of how meaningful
5015200	5017200	they are to the audience and this is achieved
5017200	5019200	by developing a connection with the characters.
5019200	5022200	The gang in Bebop choose to get involved in this
5022200	5024200	and choose how specifically to handle
5024200	5025200	everything that happens,
5025200	5027200	and Spike even deliberately chooses
5027200	5029200	to put himself in way more danger
5029200	5030200	to try to help someone else.
5030200	5032200	What these decisions are
5032200	5034200	and why they make them are interesting.
5034200	5037200	The story of this movie is what we call character-driven.
5037200	5038200	In this opening scene,
5038200	5041200	Ruby never actually has to make a choice.
5041200	5042200	She just happens to be there,
5042200	5045200	just happens to be a badass anime warrior
5045200	5046200	who can beat these guys easily,
5046200	5048200	and then just happens to be seen doing it
5048200	5050200	by a professor at Anime Hogwarts
5050200	5052200	who refers her to the headmaster.
5052200	5054200	Ruby gets into this school and is therefore present
5054200	5056200	for the rest of the plot of the show
5056200	5058200	because she happened to be in a store
5058200	5060200	while it was being robbed.
5060200	5062200	This isn't character-driven story writing.
5062200	5065200	This is coincidence-driven story writing.
5065200	5067200	Also, about this scene where Ruby is, like,
5067200	5070200	being interrogated by Glinda and Gandalf Goku,
5070200	5073200	they're, like, in this dimly lit chamber
5073200	5075200	like it's a prison or something,
5075200	5077200	but then it turns out that she was brought here
5077200	5080200	to be invited to a school.
5080200	5082200	Hello. Nice to meet you.
5082200	5084200	You want to come to my school?
5084200	5087200	Why is it shot and lit like an interrogation?
5087200	5088200	Where are they?
5088200	5092200	Is this, like, a safe house that this guy has?
5092200	5094200	Okay, there actually is an explanation
5094200	5095200	for why this scene is like this,
5095200	5096200	and we're gonna get into it.
5096200	5098200	Don't you worry. It's a doozy.
5098200	5100200	So the issue with the dust store robbery
5100200	5103200	is that Ruby doesn't actually choose to do anything.
5103200	5106200	A fight happens at her, and she wins.
5106200	5108200	To be honest, that's basically the entire plot of the show,
5108200	5110200	except sometimes the fight happens
5110200	5112200	at someone else we barely know.
5112200	5115200	So the issue with this scene is lack of characterization,
5115200	5117200	and this isn't a failure of the writing
5117200	5119200	of the specific scene but a more general problem
5119200	5122200	with the way the creative leads treat the characters.
5122200	5125200	Ruby hasn't been made a particularly interesting person.
5125200	5128200	She has a cool gun and is good at fighting
5128200	5131200	and wants to be a hero, and that's about it.
5131200	5133200	Your book. Does it have a name?
5133200	5135200	It's about a man with two souls.
5135200	5136200	I love books.
5136200	5138200	I love books.
5138200	5139200	Our main character, ladies and gentlemen.
5139200	5141200	Coming up with compelling characters
5141200	5142200	who make interesting decisions
5143200	5146200	is basically the core job of stories.
5146200	5148200	Ruby is effectively a blank slate,
5148200	5150200	so she's just not interesting
5150200	5152200	except when she's physically doing something interesting
5152200	5155200	with her cool gun, like bouncing in the air
5155200	5157200	using its blowback to slow her descent.
5157200	5160200	That's interesting for a couple of seconds.
5160200	5162200	Ruby's so poorly characterized
5162200	5164200	that the writers are still making up their minds
5164200	5166200	multiple seasons in to the point
5166200	5168200	that even what little we do know about her
5168200	5171200	gets rewritten to try to make her more interesting
5171200	5172200	than she first appeared.
5172200	5174200	For example, when Ruby falls into the plot,
5174200	5176200	she doesn't have a weapon with her,
5176200	5178200	but luckily, as we've seen,
5178200	5180200	she's an expert at hand-to-hand combat
5180200	5181200	and can easily dispatch the...
5181200	5182200	Ow!
5182200	5184200	Oh, wait.
5184200	5186200	Between these two scenes, the writers decided
5186200	5188200	it would be more interesting for Ruby
5188200	5190200	to be useless without her weapon.
5190200	5192200	Wow, you are much more manageable
5192200	5194200	without that oversized gardening tool of yours.
5194200	5196200	So now we're in a situation
5196200	5198200	where characters' basic abilities
5198200	5199200	are being rewritten on a whim
5199200	5201200	to try to make the story more interesting,
5201200	5203200	and maybe it is more interesting,
5203200	5206200	and all you have to do to engage with this new story
5206200	5209200	is forget the events of the very first scene in the show.
5209200	5212200	So what little characterization is happening
5212200	5214200	in this scene gets rewritten later.
5214200	5217200	This means even in potentially cool scenes
5217200	5220200	taken directly from one of the best anime ever,
5220200	5222200	the scene doesn't work because the character
5222200	5224200	doesn't have an opportunity to act,
5224200	5226200	to make choices, so, yeah,
5226200	5228200	I'm gonna say this scene doesn't work very well,
5228200	5230200	because it doesn't have any decently
5230200	5232200	thought-out characters in it
5232200	5235200	and therefore has nothing to tell or show us about them
5235200	5237200	except for the basic aesthetic design
5237200	5238200	of Ruby and her weapon
5238200	5240200	and the coolness of the fight animations.
5240200	5242200	So the writers evidently had seen
5242200	5244200	the opening of Cowboy Bebop the movie,
5244200	5246200	enjoyed it because it's great...
5246200	5247200	Nice.
5247200	5249200	And decided to start their show in a similar way
5249200	5251200	but didn't know why Cowboy Bebop's opening
5251200	5253200	actually worked so well,
5253200	5255200	so they just borrowed the surface components.
5255200	5257200	Store robbery, acting distracted,
5257200	5259200	headphones, and cool fight
5259200	5261200	without using them in a way
5261200	5264200	that does anything specific for the audience.
5264200	5266200	Now, you could say, well, how do you know
5266200	5268200	this is the scene that inspired them?
5268200	5270200	What if the scenes just happen to be similar?
5270200	5273200	Well, if that's the case, the scene still doesn't work
5273200	5275200	and the comparison still shows how much better
5275200	5277200	the scene could have been if it was being used
5277200	5279200	for actual characterization, but, yeah,
5279200	5281200	maybe the similarities are accidental.
5281200	5284200	To prove they aren't, I'd have to somehow demonstrate
5284200	5286200	the creators had seen Cowboy Bebop
5286200	5288200	and there's just no easy way.
5288200	5289200	If I had to recommend a show to someone
5289200	5290200	looking to get into anime,
5290200	5292200	I'd go with my personal favorite, Cowboy Bebop,
5292200	5293200	because I think it's got enough, like,
5293200	5294200	Western stuff going on.
5294200	5295200	I'll just say Spike.
5295200	5296200	I'm just gonna say Spike Spiegel
5296200	5298200	from Cowboy Bebop because he's just like water
5298200	5300200	and he's so cool.
5300200	5301200	My favorite is Cowboy Bebop.
5301200	5303200	My favorite anime is Cowboy Bebop.
5303200	5305200	My favorite anime is Cowboy Bebop
5305200	5307200	and although it's not technically an anime,
5307200	5309200	I also love Avatar the Last Airbender.
5309200	5311200	Avatar. Hmm.
5311200	5313200	Okay, so I'm gonna go out on a limb here
5313200	5316200	and say maybe Miles was inspired by his favorite anime
5316200	5318200	while trying to write an anime.
5318200	5320200	You know what? I keep falling back to Bebop,
5320200	5322200	but, uh, uh, uh,
5322200	5324200	you shouldn't just run away from your past.
5324200	5325200	Sometimes you just gotta deal with the problems
5325200	5327200	that you started and if you don't,
5327200	5328200	they will catch up with you.
5328200	5331200	Keep in mind I'm not saying this is plagiarism.
5331200	5333200	Creative theft is a different thing entirely.
5333200	5335200	I'm saying this is derivative
5335200	5337200	and doesn't even replicate the thing it's trying to.
5337200	5340200	It's certainly not wrong to draw inspiration
5340200	5341200	from other works you like
5341200	5344200	or even pay deliberate homage to things you enjoy
5344200	5346200	or which seem fitting to reference in a scene.
5346200	5348200	I mean, Cowboy Bebop does this all the time
5348200	5349200	and the convenience store scene
5349200	5351200	actually references Pulp Fiction
5351200	5352200	when one of the robbers they don't know about
5352200	5354200	comes out of the bathroom and surprises them
5354200	5357200	which happens literally three times in Pulp Fiction.
5357200	5358200	I'm gonna take a shit.
5358200	5359200	Pretty sure this is a reference
5359200	5360200	and I should know.
5360200	5362200	I had a lot of very long arguments
5362200	5364200	on now-deleted fan forums about whether this counts
5364200	5366200	and let me just say to Mazin Kaiser X
5366200	5367200	if you're still out there,
5367200	5369200	I have a YouTube channel now
5369200	5371200	so fuck you, you little philistine.
5371200	5372200	I win.
5372200	5373200	What I'm getting at here is that firstly,
5373200	5375200	I've always been cool
5375200	5376200	but also that there's nothing wrong
5376200	5378200	with wearing your inspiration on your sleeve.
5378200	5381200	What is wrong is doing it without understanding
5381200	5383200	what made the original thing work
5383200	5385200	because now it's not a cool introduction
5385200	5387200	to a character, story, and setting
5387200	5389200	inspired by another good thing.
5389200	5392200	It's a weird, clunky, and unnecessary scene
5392200	5395200	whose best feature is it reminds people of Cowboy Bebop
5395200	5398200	but RWBY doesn't just remind me of Bebop.
5398200	5400200	It reminds me of a lot of other anime
5400200	5402200	and this is a result of the show's design.
5402200	5404200	And then the next day, he was like,
5404200	5406200	hey, we should make an anime.
5406200	5408200	So as prep before writing the show,
5408200	5410200	Monty gave the writers some homework.
5410200	5412200	Anime homework.
5412200	5414200	Uh, I went to Carrie and I went, I, I,
5414200	5416200	I gave him anime homework.
5416200	5417200	If you, if you want to be honest,
5417200	5418200	you should do some anime homework
5418200	5420200	so I just started giving him shows to watch
5420200	5423200	that we could, you know, work comparatively to
5423200	5426200	and then, um, Miles was the second person onto this
5426200	5428200	where I would give him anime homework.
5428200	5430200	Watch this show if you wanna, if you wanna be part of it.
5430200	5431200	Now, I don't like admitting this.
5431200	5432200	I'm kind of secretive about it,
5432200	5434200	but I've seen a lot of anime in my time
5434200	5436200	and I know a bit about it.
5436200	5438200	I'd like to think no one's noticed this about me,
5438200	5441200	but we've somehow finally reached a place
5441200	5443200	where proper criticism of a piece of media
5443200	5445200	relies on using that knowledge,
5445200	5446200	a concept which terrifies me,
5446200	5448200	but with the benefit of your trust,
5448200	5450200	we'll come out the other side having learned more
5450200	5452200	and improved our analytical technique.
5452200	5453200	So in the name of science,
5453200	5455200	let's punch this plate of spaghetti
5455200	5458200	in order to reverse engineer it to its component ingredients
5458200	5460200	and find out what's really going on.
5460200	5462200	It's a reference, but I'm also making
5462200	5465200	a clever metaphor for analysis.
5465200	5467200	do-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
5467200	5472200	♪♪
5472200	5475200	RWBY is inspired by anime not just in terms of visuals
5475200	5477200	but more directly by the tropes and idioms
5477200	5480200	and basic story elements of shows the creators liked
5480200	5482200	or at least were told to watch.
5482200	5484200	The problem is it draws far too much
5484200	5487200	on ideas and concepts that feel like anime
5487200	5489200	without really understanding what made
5489200	5491200	the things it's borrowing actually work
5491200	5493200	in the shows they were in.
5493200	5495200	RWBY is a really strange bunch of shows,
5495200	5497200	and if you're willing to check,
5497200	5499200	you can even find out which ones.
5499200	5501200	In a Reddit thread, Miles Luna said what some of the shows
5501200	5503200	on his anime homework list were.
5503200	5505200	Among them, Gurren Lagann, Soul Eater,
5505200	5507200	Naruto, Bleach, and Black Rock Shooter.
5507200	5509200	Some of these shows have direct parallels
5509200	5511200	with RWBY's story.
5511200	5513200	Naruto, Bleach, and Soul Eater especially
5513200	5514200	have direct contrasts.
5514200	5516200	All these shows have large casts of characters
5516200	5518200	who all, for their specific story reasons,
5518200	5520200	have their own unique powers.
5520200	5522200	This is really traditional for shounen shows.
5522200	5524200	Everyone kind of has their own deal, and in Bleach,
5524200	5527200	almost every main character has a unique magical sword
5527200	5529200	which grants them a specific ability,
5529200	5532200	and the main character in Soul Eater wields a cool scythe.
5532200	5535200	It's not that hard to tell what ideas RWBY
5535200	5537200	is borrowing from these shows, is it?
5537200	5539200	But again, the core elements being borrowed
5539200	5542200	are the really basic Wikipedia-level synopsis ideas.
5542200	5544200	The sort of stuff people who don't watch anime
5544200	5546200	think anime is about,
5546200	5548200	like the school for learning anime fighting,
5548200	5551200	the large cast of characters with cool abilities and powers,
5551200	5553200	the super simple stuff that isn't really
5553200	5555200	why anyone watches something.
5555200	5557200	These shows work because they're really about
5557200	5560200	the characters and their choices and relationships,
5560200	5562200	and they happen to be set against a fun,
5562200	5564200	fantastical background with cool action.
5564200	5566200	Boruto's dad and his army of frenemies
5566200	5569200	live rich inner lives and form interesting connections
5569200	5572200	with each other and the audience as they grow and change.
5572200	5575200	In Soul Eater, the cool weapons are alive
5575200	5578200	and lots of focus is put on how they relate to
5578200	5581200	and work with their users, and this also happens in Bleach
5581200	5583200	but, you know, in a way where it seems really awesome
5583200	5586200	and you choose to watch it over all the other shounen
5586200	5588200	at the time and then it crushes your hopes and dreams,
5588200	5591200	and it seems like in the early RWBY Weiss relationship,
5591200	5593200	this is what they were going for.
5593200	5595200	The way they bicker in the early trial
5595200	5597200	and Weiss is angry about not being the leader later,
5597200	5599200	this is honestly, genuinely the beginning
5599200	5601200	of an interesting relationship,
5601200	5603200	but instead of making this an aspect of the show,
5603200	5605200	they fix it and make someone else's life
5605200	5607200	the focus of the show for half of it,
5607200	5609200	and then someone else turns up to do all the fighting,
5609200	5611200	so the thing that makes these shows work,
5611200	5613200	the characters, their relationships,
5613200	5615200	your engagement with the characters as they do
5615200	5617200	fun fights is absent.
5617200	5620200	It's a stew but without the most important ingredient,
5620200	5622200	the stew mix. That's the rule, by the way.
5622200	5624200	You're allowed to make food metaphors in criticism
5624200	5626200	but only when they're actually a clever reference.
5626200	5628200	At best, the main character,
5628200	5630200	who theoretically should be the most interesting,
5630200	5634200	is a lady in a nice outfit with a cool gun.
5634200	5637200	That's a really low ceiling to put on a story.
5637200	5640200	RWBY feels like fan fiction of a show that doesn't exist.
5640200	5642200	Except, no, that's not true.
5642200	5645200	There is one specific show it feels a whole lot
5645200	5647200	like fan fiction for.
5647200	5649200	To quote Miles Luna again,
5649200	5651200	if you want to get a feel of what the show will be like,
5651200	5653200	watch Avatar The Last Airbender.
5653200	5655200	Oh, this explains a lot of things.
5655200	5657200	Once you go watch Avatar, you start to realize
5657200	5659200	where a lot of the show came from.
5659200	5661200	For example, Avatar is set in a world
5661200	5662200	with four nations in it.
5662200	5666200	Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.
5666200	5668200	RWBY has four kingdoms,
5668200	5669200	so you see it's different.
5669200	5671200	The four kingdoms.
5671200	5673200	They're called kingdoms because, well,
5673200	5674200	they can't call them nations, can they?
5674200	5676200	In Avatar, in times of stress,
5676200	5678200	the Avatar enters a state where his eyes glow
5678200	5680200	and he manifests amazing powers.
5680200	5683200	You'll never guess that three seasons into the story
5683200	5685200	with zero setup that this is a thing,
5685200	5687200	RWBY's eyes suddenly glow,
5687200	5689200	and she's revealed to have the amazing power
5689200	5692200	to instantly turn even the most powerful Grimm to stone.
5692200	5695200	You learn she has this power the instant it happens,
5695200	5697200	and you only learn what this power is in retrospect
5697200	5699200	because there was no room in the story
5699200	5700200	to set this up, was there?
5700200	5702200	Another cool thing about Avatar is that the Avatar
5702200	5705200	reincarnates into a new form whenever he dies.
5705200	5707200	Completely coincidentally, there's a character in RWBY
5707200	5709200	whose spirit goes on to inhabit a new form
5709200	5711200	whenever he dies. Amazing.
5711200	5712200	You see, it's actually a clever twist
5712200	5714200	because no one would have expected them
5714200	5715200	to be that obvious,
5715200	5718200	so when they really did just do Avatar again,
5718200	5719200	it's a genuine surprise.
5719200	5722200	Oh, another massively important plot element.
5722200	5724200	One of the antagonists is a revolutionary
5724200	5726200	political movement reacting to oppression
5726200	5730200	led by a man in a mask with horrendous scars underneath.
5730200	5731200	Was I talking about RWBY there?
5731200	5733200	No, I was talking about Avatar, Legend of Korra,
5733200	5735200	but, yes, that also happens in RWBY.
5735200	5737200	Oh, actually, you see, the scar is different
5737200	5739200	because it's over one of his eyes.
5739200	5741200	That's slightly different from Avatar,
5741200	5742200	so it's not the same thing.
5742200	5744200	You see, no, what's this picture of Zuko doing here?
5744200	5747200	Then in later seasons, they decide to take the story
5747200	5748200	in a very different direction,
5748200	5749200	you know, to make it a bit more unique,
5749200	5751200	so now the characters have to travel the world
5751200	5753200	and visit lots of different towns and villages
5753200	5755200	and cultures on their way,
5755200	5756200	which is completely unlike Avatar
5756200	5758200	because when it happens in Avatar, it's good.
5758200	5760200	Remember when I was positive about the potential
5760200	5762200	of RWBY's story and setting?
5762200	5765200	Well, it feels like I'm really just complimenting
5765200	5766200	the material it borrowed.
5766200	5768200	So many of RWBY's choices seem made
5768200	5770200	specifically that way because it was that way
5770200	5773200	in Avatar even though it's completely unnecessary
5773200	5774200	to borrow those parts.
5774200	5778200	Why is it that every time you play with magic water,
5778200	5780200	I get soaked?
5780200	5783200	It's not magic. It's waterbending.
5783200	5784200	Oh, my God.
5784200	5785200	Is that where the characters' powers
5785200	5787200	not being magic came from?
5787200	5789200	Why would you even think to do that?
5789200	5791200	I always thought each season of RWBY being called a volume
5791200	5794200	was a bit weird and unwieldy, and guess what?
5794200	5795200	It turns out it sounds way better
5795200	5797200	when they're called books.
5797200	5799200	Even the intro voiceover sometimes sounds
5799200	5801200	like they right-click Thesaurus
5801200	5803200	some aspects of Avatar's intro.
5803200	5805200	My grandmother used to tell me stories
5805200	5806200	about the old days.
5806200	5807200	Legends.
5807200	5810200	Stories scattered through time.
5810200	5811200	It's like the show's playing a game
5811200	5813200	of telephone with Avatar.
5813200	5815200	Those words in that order sounded good,
5815200	5818200	so let's use some words that are a bit similar
5818200	5821200	in a different order and also make it all about dust.
5821200	5824200	The thing that made Avatar's introduction work
5824200	5826200	is it set up a lot of stuff at once.
5826200	5829200	For example, how this settings version of magic worked,
5829200	5831200	the thing you didn't mention at all,
5831200	5833200	or the fact there were four big nations.
5833200	5835200	You know, the thing you didn't mention at all
5835200	5838200	except for when four castle-looking things
5838200	5840200	turn up for three seconds before disappearing.
5840200	5842200	Jaune is a pretty direct analog for Sokka
5842200	5844200	to the point where the creators just say
5844200	5845200	that's what he's based on.
5845200	5846200	Oh, no, I was saying, like,
5846200	5848200	when you first did Reeds and I was like,
5848200	5850200	we need, like, a Sokka character.
5850200	5852200	And this retroactively explains
5852200	5854200	why Jaune's plot line was so weird.
5854200	5856200	Jaune Arc had this subplot of Jaune
5856200	5858200	not accepting Pyrrha's offer to help train him
5858200	5859200	to be a better fighter,
5859200	5861200	but his explanation for why was always really strange.
5861200	5863200	He wants to get better without help,
5863200	5866200	or he's not really a hero or something.
5866200	5868200	If I can't do this on my own,
5868200	5869200	then what good am I?
5869200	5872200	But he never tries and never pays attention in class,
5872200	5874200	so that's bullshit,
5874200	5876200	and at the end of his section of the story,
5876200	5877200	he just accepts her help.
5877200	5879200	Standing up to a bully taught him to...
5879200	5882200	This confusing arc happens because it happened to Sokka.
5882200	5884200	In Avatar, a story with characters
5884200	5887200	with depth and infinitely better world building,
5887200	5889200	in the beginning Sokka is not a great warrior,
5889200	5891200	but he desperately wants to be one.
5891200	5893200	He's from a culture that looks down on the idea
5893200	5894200	of women being fighters,
5894200	5896200	but then he gets wrecked by an order
5896200	5898200	of female warriors who protect a village
5898200	5899200	on their travels and has to confront
5899200	5900200	his beliefs about women.
5900200	5902200	He learns a lesson from this
5902200	5903200	and begs them to train him.
5903200	5905200	He gets better as a fighter,
5905200	5907200	but this plot line is super engaging for an audience
5907200	5909200	because we get to watch him grow as a person
5909200	5911200	and change his beliefs.
5911200	5913200	Sokka starts out, like, kind of as a shitty teen.
5913200	5914200	I thought I would really not like him
5914200	5915200	when I first watched Avatar,
5915200	5917200	but he grows so much.
5917200	5920200	He becomes such an interesting character super quickly.
5920200	5922200	So now it's clear why Jaune's arc
5922200	5924200	is seemingly missing pieces.
5924200	5926200	It's not just that Sokka was written better,
5926200	5927200	but more specifically,
5927200	5929200	it's clear the writers liked the idea
5929200	5931200	of giving their Sokka character the same arc,
5931200	5933200	but the problem with this arc is
5933200	5935200	it means one of your core characters starts out
5935200	5938200	as a bit of a chauvinist and needs time and work
5938200	5940200	to grow into a better person,
5940200	5942200	but if you're trying to write a cool, progressive anime
5942200	5944200	starring mostly girls,
5944200	5946200	you don't want to have a character acting like that,
5946200	5948200	do you? That sounds kind of heavy,
5948200	5950200	and are you really going to write your character
5950200	5952200	who you voice to act like that?
5952200	5954200	So Jaune is written to already start out
5954200	5956200	as basically a good person
5956200	5958200	who respects women's abilities as fighters
5958200	5960200	who simply needs to learn to accept help
5960200	5963200	instead of refusing it for what is now no reason.
5963200	5965200	It actually turns out that a ton of weird things
5965200	5967200	about RWBY happened that way
5967200	5969200	because they were like that in Avatar.
5969200	5971200	The interrogation thing in the first episode of RWBY
5971200	5973200	was always a silly choice.
5973200	5975200	Why take her to this weird dimly lit empty room
5975200	5977200	to invite her to a school?
5977200	5979200	But it makes much more sense if you happen to have seen
5979200	5981200	the first episode of Legend of Korra
5981200	5983200	when Korra gets arrested and interrogated.
5983200	5985200	If a scene in RWBY seems out of place
5985200	5987200	or like a scene from another show
5987200	5989200	just happened for no reason in the middle of this one,
5989200	5991200	it's probably because it did,
5991200	5993200	so it's pretty clear to the point
5993200	5995200	they literally admit it that a big problem
5995200	5997200	with RWBY's writing is that the creators
5997200	5999200	are grasping wildly at shows they like
5999200	6001200	for things to recreate in their show
6001200	6003200	in the hopes of crafting a story.
6003200	6005200	It's only technically been written
6005200	6007200	in one sense of the word.
6007200	6009200	It's more of a reconstituted amalgam
6009200	6011200	of things they thought were cool elsewhere.
6011200	6013200	Grind up all that meat and stuff it
6013200	6015200	into a sausage casing or I guess
6015200	6017200	in this case a body pillow.
6017200	6019200	No, Miles, what are you doing? This is really embarrassing.
6019200	6022200	Ruby Rose is a 15-year-old girl.
6022200	6024200	If you like anything about RWBY
6024200	6026200	and you haven't seen much anime before
6026200	6028200	because it didn't seem like it was for you,
6028200	6030200	I guarantee you right now there's a show
6030200	6032200	in this list that the thing you liked
6032200	6034200	about RWBY came from and you'd like
6034200	6036200	that show a hell of a lot more
6036200	6038200	and let's be honest, it's probably Avatar.
6038200	6040200	A lot of people I've met who are really big fans
6040200	6042200	of RWBY tend to be not into anime.
6042200	6044200	They don't think it's for them or they haven't watched it
6044200	6046200	before yet, but if you take the plunge
6046200	6048200	and then you see how good a show using these ideas
6048200	6050200	could be, you'll very quickly be able
6050200	6052200	to see why a lot of people with a bit more
6052200	6054200	of a frame of reference are so disappointed
6054200	6056200	with this show. Go pick a show from that list
6056200	6058200	and have a better time. Seriously.
6058200	6060200	Just make sure it's not Bleach. Don't make the same mistake
6060200	6062200	I did. Please, you mustn't! You have to!
6062200	6064200	There's a scene in volume two where it turns out
6064200	6066200	Yang and Ruby have a family dog called Zwei.
6066200	6068200	There's a dog in Cowboy Bebop
6068200	6070200	of the same breed called Ain.
6070200	6072200	Get it? The creators are trying to make a cute
6072200	6074200	reference to a show they like.
6074200	6076200	They don't seem to have realized they've referenced
6076200	6078200	all the shows they like quite enough already.
6078200	6080200	I was hoping they'd eventually
6080200	6082200	try doing something else.
6082200	6084200	The real impact of all this on Ruby's potential
6084200	6086200	is that it means the things
6086200	6088200	that are truly unique about it get ignored.
6088200	6090200	Because the world building is vague
6090200	6092200	and really just a loose approximation
6092200	6094200	of nine other cartoons, all kinds
6094200	6096200	of little tidbits crop up that would be
6096200	6098200	so interesting if they went anywhere
6098200	6100200	but never will. Remember Crescent Rose?
6100200	6102200	You know, one of the most dangerous weapons
6102200	6104200	ever designed? One of the most dangerous
6104200	6106200	weapons ever designed? There is one
6106200	6108200	really interesting story element to it
6108200	6110200	which is that Ruby designed it.
6110200	6112200	Well, I'm kind of a dork
6112200	6114200	when it comes to weapons. I guess I did go
6114200	6116200	a little overboard in designing it.
6116200	6118200	Ruby designed this weapon. One of the most
6118200	6120200	dangerous weapons ever designed. Now,
6120200	6122200	if you were looking at the script and you'd
6122200	6124200	written these two things, what you should
6124200	6126200	do at that moment is kiss yourself
6126200	6128200	and realize that you've just struck
6128200	6130200	fucking gold. The main character
6130200	6132200	of your show is a child inventor
6132200	6134200	who can craft incredible machines
6134200	6136200	that kill. What a fantastic
6136200	6138200	premise for a story and Ruby
6138200	6140200	loves to read weapon magazines
6140200	6142200	and nerds out about the weapons she sees
6142200	6144200	when she first gets to anime warrior school.
6144200	6146200	Like, they've almost written a
6146200	6148200	character here and everything else about
6148200	6150200	Ruby's character is the most milquetoast
6150200	6152200	stuff possible like, oh, she wants to be a hero?
6152200	6154200	Great. I love books.
6154200	6156200	I think this line annoys me so much because
6156200	6158200	like, Ruby has a really interesting character
6158200	6160200	trait you could be doing something with.
6160200	6162200	And you're doing this?
6162200	6164200	No! No, you can't! I forbid it!
6164200	6166200	And when this comes up,
6166200	6168200	Ruby's talking to Jaune whose deal is
6168200	6170200	he just has a regular sword.
6170200	6172200	Like, it's a punchline. And when I was
6172200	6174200	first watching the show, I was really having my doubts
6174200	6176200	about where things were going, but when this happened,
6176200	6178200	I thought, oh, cool.
6178200	6180200	Ruby's gonna help him design a unique
6180200	6182200	weapon that really works for him and we're
6182200	6184200	gonna see them coming up with it and building
6184200	6186200	it and developing as friends and that's
6186200	6188200	gonna be so cool. Jaune's gonna come
6188200	6190200	into his own and learn things about himself
6190200	6192200	as he does it and grow as a fighter
6192200	6194200	and as a person and there's something really wholesome
6194200	6196200	about learning a skill and building something
6196200	6198200	in a story. That'll be a really cool
6198200	6200200	thing to follow. And then,
6200200	6202200	it didn't happen for a season because they were doing
6202200	6204200	anime bullshit instead.
6204200	6206200	Fighting monsters, dealing with bullies,
6206200	6208200	falling asleep during pointless
6208200	6210200	exposition. Oh, and in the show as well.
6210200	6212200	And then for years, I kept thinking,
6212200	6214200	when are they gonna do it? When are they gonna do it?
6214200	6216200	When are they going to use
6216200	6218200	Ruby's interesting character trait
6218200	6220200	that they just seemingly forgot she has?
6220200	6222200	And then, finally,
6222200	6224200	in volume four,
6224200	6226200	they go to a blacksmith and a character
6226200	6228200	who we've never seen before and never will again
6228200	6230200	upgrades Jaune's sword using
6230200	6232200	pieces of his girlfriend's armor.
6232200	6234200	And Ruby rarely, if ever, talks about
6234200	6236200	the fact she made Crescent Rose and
6236200	6238200	she stops nerding out about weapons except
6238200	6240200	for, like, once per season if the
6240200	6242200	writers remember that was her one unique
6242200	6244200	character trait. Ah, but I'm sure you're
6244200	6246200	going somewhere with this Avatar remake.
6246200	6248200	Don't let me distract you. No, I'm not even fucking
6248200	6250200	kidding you. Even the forging of
6250200	6252200	a sword out of some cool material he
6252200	6254200	has is a thing Sokka does in Avatar.
6254200	6256200	It just doesn't stop.
6256200	6258200	It never stops. This show has
6258200	6260200	so many cool concepts that
6260200	6262200	just crop up like that where if you're paying
6262200	6264200	attention, there's tremendous potential being
6264200	6266200	laid down here and then they ignore it to just
6266200	6268200	loosely copy stuff from
6268200	6270200	fucking Bleach. Look, that guy
6270200	6272200	has the sword that's a bit like the
6272200	6274200	one from Bleach. Do you remember
6274200	6276200	Bleach? I remember
6276200	6278200	Bleach. Someone
6278200	6280200	please validate me remembering so much
6280200	6282200	Bleach. There's a Roger Ebert quote I always
6282200	6284200	really liked and used in a draft of
6284200	6286200	this video I was working on like five
6286200	6288200	years ago which Lindsay Ellis happened
6288200	6290200	to use first in a video before
6290200	6292200	me so now it feels like I'm ripping her off.
6292200	6294200	Thanks, Lindsay. Where when reviewing
6294200	6296200	Battlefield Earth, he makes the comment that the
6296200	6298200	director has learned from better films
6298200	6300200	that directors sometimes tilt their
6300200	6302200	cameras but he has not learned why.
6302200	6304200	I'm gonna take a shit. I believe Miles
6304200	6306200	when he tells me Avatar is one of his
6306200	6308200	favorite shows but I'm not convinced
6308200	6310200	he knows why he liked it. Cowboy Bebop
6310200	6312200	is cool because it's about a man who
6312200	6314200	believes his life is already over
6314200	6316200	throwing himself into life or death situations
6316200	6318200	to feel alive again. Spike
6318200	6320200	Spiegel carries a weight with
6320200	6322200	him and you have to watch him do his best
6322200	6324200	to pretend he isn't. Cowboy
6324200	6326200	Bebop is not cool because
6326200	6328200	he's good at spinny kicks and
6328200	6330200	his friend has a robot arm and frankly
6330200	6332200	the idea that that's what really
6332200	6334200	mattered is personally offensive
6334200	6336200	to me. If you really respect this
6336200	6338200	material, you should borrow the things
6338200	6340200	that gave it meaning, not all of this
6340200	6342200	surface level stuff. This is kind of
6342200	6344200	the important thing to drill in on here.
6344200	6346200	These shows aren't about cool powers
6346200	6348200	or great visuals or engaging
6348200	6350200	fights. They have those but on a core
6350200	6352200	level, what they're really about is
6352200	6354200	characters, people who you feel
6354200	6356200	things for, who you watch do things,
6356200	6358200	who you can be invested in. If you
6358200	6360200	don't have that base layer of engagement
6360200	6362200	with the people in your story,
6362200	6364200	you don't really have much of anything.
6364200	6366200	If you have a cool fight but you haven't made
6366200	6368200	people interested in or understand
6368200	6370200	why they're fighting, then you
6370200	6372200	don't even really have the fight, do you?
6372200	6374200	Lots of things in the show are references to
6374200	6376200	other Rooster Teeth properties. There's
6376200	6378200	in-jokes everywhere, posters from other shows,
6378200	6380200	quotes from their podcasts,
6380200	6382200	this store's name is a pun on
6382200	6384200	a simple walk into Mordor,
6384200	6386200	that show they did about walking in New Zealand.
6386200	6388200	Even tiny things like
6388200	6390200	Jaune's locker number is a reference
6390200	6392200	to the address of Rooster Teeth's old studio.
6392200	6394200	Whatever unique story and
6394200	6396200	potential there is in here, it's taking
6396200	6398200	refuge behind an immense patchwork
6398200	6400200	quilt of references to
6400200	6402200	other things they like, other things
6402200	6404200	their company made, and eventually
6404200	6406200	references to the few things people
6406200	6408200	seemed to like about the show itself.
6408200	6410200	One of the standout moments that people
6410200	6412200	really liked about early RWBY is the part
6412200	6414200	where Nora pokes Ren's nose and says
6414200	6416200	boop. Boop. People really
6416200	6418200	liked that because it's a genuinely
6418200	6420200	simple and cute moment that you don't
6420200	6422200	need to know Rooster Teeth lore to enjoy
6422200	6424200	and isn't trying and failing
6424200	6426200	to emulate something else. It's just nice.
6426200	6428200	You know? That's good. It's cute.
6428200	6430200	People also really liked the way Penny introduced
6430200	6432200	herself because it's genuinely a really
6432200	6434200	nice moment. Like, Weiss accidentally
6434200	6436200	knocks her over and she just goes
6436200	6438200	salutations.
6438200	6440200	That's funny. That's good writing. That's
6440200	6442200	characterization. It's immediately clear
6442200	6444200	that something is up with Penny. It's good.
6444200	6446200	Please stop being sometimes
6446200	6448200	good and getting my hopes up.
6448200	6450200	So, of course, in addition to selling
6450200	6452200	merchandise that quotes these moments,
6452200	6454200	in the second season Nora starts wearing
6454200	6456200	a boop shirt. They don't have room
6456200	6458200	to make the prom stuff interesting
6458200	6460200	or to connect Monty's fights properly
6460200	6462200	and make them feel like part of a story
6462200	6464200	but they had room to go, hey,
6464200	6466200	remember when she said boop?
6466200	6468200	Well, it's in stores now. The show is
6468200	6470200	just a continuous list of references
6470200	6472200	to other things that were good,
6472200	6474200	and by the middle of season two, sorry,
6474200	6476200	book two, sorry, volume two,
6476200	6478200	it's referencing the few good parts
6478200	6480200	of itself. Writing, like,
6480200	6482200	the word writing is often
6482200	6484200	used to mean a lot of
6484200	6486200	different things but at its core
6486200	6488200	writing means
6488200	6490200	making decisions and
6490200	6492200	risking making the wrong one.
6492200	6494200	What's acutely frustrating about Ruby
6494200	6496200	is that Miles and Kerry don't
6496200	6498200	necessarily always make
6498200	6500200	bad decisions. It's that they have
6500200	6502200	done almost everything they can to
6502200	6504200	make them, to abdicate the
6504200	6506200	responsibility of having to write
6506200	6508200	a story of their own. They don't understand
6508200	6510200	exactly why the
6510200	6512200	things they're borrowing actually were
6512200	6514200	enjoyable, which makes it worse, but
6514200	6516200	centrally they're in this mess because they're
6516200	6518200	going out of their way not to be
6518200	6520200	unique and thereby failing to do
6520200	6522200	interesting things with or apparently
6522200	6524200	even notice the potential
6524200	6526200	that an original animated work made for
6526200	6528200	the internet with no oversight can have.
6528200	6530200	The show could have been
6530200	6532200	anything, and it wants to be anything
6532200	6534200	other than itself, and that wasted
6534200	6536200	potential will never not be tremendously
6536200	6538200	disappointing. When you take
6538200	6540200	no risks and try to say
6540200	6542200	very little while looking like
6542200	6544200	you're saying something important, you get
6544200	6546200	a story element like the Faunus.
6546200	6550200	By later in the first volume,
6550200	6552200	we finally sat in a classroom and learned what
6552200	6554200	the Faunus are and also seen the bully character
6554200	6556200	mistreating one of them. The Faunus are
6556200	6558200	a stand-in for the oppressed races
6558200	6560200	of the world. Yes, that is correct.
6560200	6562200	I did not misspeak. These guys
6562200	6564200	have to talk about racism now
6564200	6566200	and I am here for
6566200	6568200	it. I've heard it mentioned that this aspect
6568200	6570200	of the story was originally conceived by
6570200	6572200	Monty, but unfortunately the story
6572200	6574200	is being written by the men who brought you
6574200	6576200	My Semblance is Polarity?
6576200	6578200	The big twist in volume
6578200	6580200	one is that Blake is a Faunus.
6580200	6582200	She gets mad at Weiss for being a racist
6582200	6584200	and runs away and dramatically
6584200	6586200	takes off her bow to reveal
6586200	6588200	her fat ears in addition
6588200	6590200	to her normal ears. Have you guessed which
6590200	6592200	fairy tale character Blake is based on yet?
6592200	6594200	Well, I'll tell you.
6594200	6597200	She's Beauty and the Beast.
6597200	6599200	Ugh!
6599200	6601200	Now, I don't know about you, but Ruby didn't
6601200	6603200	initially strike me as a show that was
6603200	6605200	trying to be about something this heavy.
6605200	6607200	I mean, for the most part, it's been an adventure
6607200	6609200	story about kids beating up monsters
6609200	6611200	and bad guys, so when this happened,
6611200	6613200	I don't know, it seemed a little weird.
6613200	6615200	Like, is this particular show with
6615200	6617200	the tone you've set so far really ready
6617200	6619200	for something as serious as this?
6619200	6621200	I'm queen of the castle.
6621200	6623200	I'm queen of the castle.
6623200	6625200	Like, we're in the middle of this fairly light-hearted
6625200	6627200	show, so light-hearted characters have
6627200	6629200	a magic shield in fights so they can't get
6629200	6631200	hurt too badly, and then in a classroom
6631200	6633200	the comedy fast-talking coffee-drinking
6633200	6635200	professor guy, voiced by
6635200	6637200	the guy who plays Caboose in Red vs.
6637200	6639200	Blue, starts to discuss the
6639200	6641200	horrific tragedy of the mistreatment
6641200	6643200	of the Faunus. Prior to the Faunus
6643200	6645200	Rights Revolution, more popularly known as
6645200	6647200	the Faunus War, they begin to explore
6647200	6649200	the topic of racism by using
6649200	6651200	the comedy silly-talky man.
6651200	6653200	Now, have
6653200	6655200	any among you been subjugated or
6655200	6657200	discriminated because of your Faunus heritage?
6657200	6659200	The issue of racism is a big part
6659200	6661200	of the rest of the story, or at least it tries
6661200	6663200	to be. A central component
6663200	6665200	of the plot is the White Fang, a group
6665200	6667200	of Faunus who do crimes and terrorism
6667200	6669200	in the name of Faunus liberation. The White Fang
6669200	6671200	are presented as antagonists in the
6671200	6673200	story. They work with the bad man from volume
6673200	6675200	one and do a bunch of crimes, including
6675200	6677200	the train thing. A lot of the goons getting
6677200	6679200	fought in fights in volumes one,
6679200	6681200	two, three,
6681200	6683200	four, and five are
6683200	6685200	White Fang members. When the main characters
6685200	6687200	aren't fighting Grimm, they're beating
6687200	6689200	the shit out of in-universe minorities,
6689200	6691200	but it's okay. You know they're bad because
6691200	6693200	they all talk in the evil voice.
6693200	6695200	Finally,
6695200	6697200	I get to kill a shnee.
6697200	6699200	Oh, I think he might be a bad
6699200	6701200	guy. Once again, we're seeing the writing problems
6701200	6703200	that made Jaune's character so terrible
6703200	6705200	creeping in here. This argument between
6705200	6707200	Weiss and Blake comes to a head because,
6707200	6709200	at least initially, Weiss was written to be
6709200	6710200	kind of racist.
6710200	6712200	Hmm. The White Fang.
6712200	6714200	What an awful bunch of degenerates.
6714200	6716200	I don't particularly trust
6716200	6718200	the Faunus. Her family profited
6718200	6720200	from exploitative Faunus labor and maybe
6720200	6722200	slavery, but it's hard to tell exactly what
6722200	6724200	because the show is written badly. Infamous
6724200	6726200	for its controversial labor forces.
6726200	6728200	And she seems to take the opportunity to be shitty
6728200	6730200	about Faunus when it presents itself.
6730200	6732200	Stop calling him a degenerate. He's a person.
6732200	6734200	Oh, I'm sorry.
6734200	6736200	Would you like me to stop referring to the trash
6736200	6738200	can as a trash can?
6738200	6740200	But at some point down the line, the writers were smart
6740200	6742200	enough to see a problem with writing a main character
6742200	6744200	with this flaw. Weiss being racist
6744200	6746200	might affect the audience's ability
6746200	6748200	to relate to the character, wouldn't it?
6748200	6750200	The creators want the audience to like this lady
6750200	6752200	as they go on adventures with her and watch her
6752200	6754200	dote on pup boy Bebop.
6754200	6756200	How many members of your audience are really gonna
6756200	6758200	want to cosplay as the Weiss
6758200	6760200	supremacist? So her beliefs about
6760200	6762200	the Faunus are quietly dropped off
6762200	6764200	screen and we are to assume she's
6764200	6766200	anti-racist in future volumes.
6766200	6768200	She just says, hey, whatever, we're a team.
6768200	6770200	Let's work together now, and then in the next volume
6770200	6772200	this side of her character is quietly
6772200	6774200	forgotten. Knowing this show, I
6774200	6776200	presume a man told her off screen not to be
6776200	6778200	a racist anymore and she went, okay.
6778200	6780200	In volume two she says she wants
6780200	6782200	to become a Huntress specifically to try
6782200	6784200	to do better than her family name has
6784200	6786200	been in the past and she doesn't like what her
6786200	6788200	father is doing, implicitly saying
6788200	6790200	she became a fighter who protects the world
6790200	6792200	because she wants to not be like her
6792200	6794200	racist family. This is done instead
6794200	6796200	of having her grapple with her
6796200	6798200	prejudice towards a group of people and
6798200	6800200	growing and changing and learning.
6800200	6802200	You know, akin to what a story would
6802200	6804200	do. They made her racist and then rewrote
6804200	6806200	her to never have been racist.
6806200	6808200	The writers are far too precious
6808200	6810200	about their characters to permit them to have,
6810200	6812200	like, flaws or lives
6812200	6814200	or even personalities beyond
6814200	6816200	cookie cutter heroics.
6816200	6818200	They don't need to learn anything
6818200	6820200	or grow, which makes them fundamentally
6820200	6822200	uninteresting, and in the same way
6822200	6824200	the writers are far too precious
6824200	6826200	about their world itself. They want
6826200	6828200	their world to not be so fundamentally
6828200	6830200	flawed that a group like the White Fang is necessary.
6830200	6832200	You see, the issue here is the White Fang
6832200	6834200	are basically in the right. The Faunus
6834200	6836200	are an oppressed people whose
6836200	6838200	struggle for liberation and equality
6838200	6840200	is immediately, the instant you
6840200	6842200	actually think about it, the morally
6842200	6844200	correct side of the argument. Spoilers
6844200	6846200	for real life, but we recently discovered
6846200	6848200	in lab tests on mice that racism
6848200	6850200	is wrong, but, like, if you have a movement
6850200	6852200	whose purpose is to liberate an oppressed
6852200	6854200	group, that means your society
6854200	6856200	has some incredibly deep-set problems,
6856200	6858200	right? People who need liberating
6858200	6860200	from something? You know the Black Panthers
6860200	6862200	didn't pop into existence because things
6862200	6864200	were fine in the 60s, right?
6864200	6866200	Oh, I really hate Hbomb's political videos,
6866200	6868200	but I love his media stuff. It's way better.
6868200	6870200	Ha! I tricked you! But Miles and
6870200	6872200	Kerry realized at some point that
6872200	6874200	if you introduce a group like this,
6874200	6876200	then the main society of your story
6876200	6878200	is a systemically racist one,
6878200	6880200	and a huge portion of your main characters
6880200	6882200	would be tacitly implicated in this
6882200	6884200	by living in that society and not
6884200	6886200	doing anything about the way those people are treated.
6886200	6888200	Basically, they'd be writing a pretty grim
6888200	6890200	story where almost everyone
6890200	6892200	is on some level racist
6892200	6894200	or at least okay with an unequal
6894200	6896200	system because a lot of shit would need
6896200	6898200	to change if there's a group like the White Fang
6898200	6900200	running around and anyone sitting around
6900200	6902200	enjoying the status quo instead of doing anything
6902200	6904200	wouldn't be a heroic or positive
6904200	6906200	character in this setting. In other words,
6906200	6908200	you'd have a bit too much
6908200	6910200	social commentary making everyone
6910200	6912200	really uncomfortable about the parallels
6912200	6914200	to real world history and in some places
6914200	6916200	the real world present which would
6916200	6918200	be an interesting story. I'd like a story
6918200	6920200	like that really, but which would kind of suck
6920200	6922200	the fun out of your anime cartoon about
6922200	6924200	killing monsters with sci-fi rocket fists.
6924200	6926200	People aren't gonna buy your boop
6926200	6928200	t-shirts if they're sad about racism
6928200	6930200	so the writer's objective was to make
6930200	6932200	a show which explores racism
6932200	6934200	but without making anyone too
6934200	6936200	uncomfortable, without risking actually
6936200	6938200	saying anything about our society,
6938200	6940200	and without risking saying that the White Fang
6940200	6942200	might have a point so everyone can have
6942200	6944200	fun watching people beat them up because
6944200	6946200	they're the bad guys. We wouldn't want any
6946200	6948200	implications to think about. So,
6948200	6950200	firstly, the mistreatment that appears in the story
6950200	6952200	is always incredibly minor.
6952200	6954200	It's established that the Faunus have already
6954200	6956200	had a civil rights movement of sorts
6956200	6958200	and been granted equality but just aren't
6958200	6960200	really getting it yet in some places.
6960200	6962200	Despite being promised equality, the Faunus
6962200	6964200	were subjected to discrimination and hate.
6964200	6966200	Some specific people are still
6966200	6968200	kind of racist. Faunus get bullied
6968200	6970200	by some people in school. There's a
6970200	6972200	no Faunus sign on one bar.
6972200	6974200	There's nothing wrong with the system anymore.
6974200	6976200	Individual racists are the problem.
6976200	6978200	Since we aren't living in a racist
6978200	6980200	nightmare world, we can feel less bad
6980200	6982200	about the status quo of the setting and more
6982200	6984200	okay with the idea that the White Fang are bad.
6984200	6986200	But even then, they still have a roughly
6986200	6988200	sympathetic goal. If a shadowy
6988200	6990200	group were blowing up the businesses
6990200	6992200	of people who refuse to serve Faunus or
6992200	6994200	attacking people with unethical Faunus
6994200	6996200	labor practices, which I assume is what
6996200	6998200	a controversial labor force is,
6998200	7000200	half the people watching might not realize
7000200	7002200	these are supposed to be the bad guys.
7002200	7004200	You can't have a story where the liberation movement
7004200	7006200	has a point because then you're writing a story
7006200	7008200	that's slightly more complex than
7008200	7010200	the help we need to stop the bad guys.
7010200	7012200	And that's not fun.
7012200	7014200	If you're writing a story for tiny babies,
7014200	7016200	you want to be writing a generally okay world
7016200	7018200	that's being threatened by evil outsiders.
7018200	7020200	You know, like the monsters you could have
7020200	7022200	already had be the main villains. So to add
7022200	7024200	an extra level of moral simplification,
7024200	7026200	they have the White Fang be recently under
7026200	7028200	new leadership that are way more violent
7028200	7030200	and pro-terrorism than normal.
7030200	7032200	Five years ago, our leader stepped down
7032200	7034200	and a new one took his place.
7034200	7036200	A new leader with a new way of thinking.
7036200	7038200	Okay, now they might have a point,
7038200	7040200	but they're just going about it all wrong
7040200	7042200	with this terrorism stuff.
7042200	7044200	Now we can all get behind how they're the bad guys
7044200	7046200	even if racism is wrong
7046200	7048200	and they maybe have a point.
7048200	7050200	Oh, I think she might be the bad guy,
7050200	7052200	et cetera. You get the point.
7052200	7054200	The story amounts to a long series
7054200	7056200	of justifications for why the organization
7056200	7058200	whose stated goal is the liberation
7058200	7060200	of an oppressed people can be
7060200	7062200	thought of as the antagonists.
7062200	7064200	The White Fang used to be good guys,
7064200	7066200	like agitating for progress in a nice way,
7066200	7068200	politely asking for racism to end
7068200	7070200	like good second-class citizens,
7070200	7072200	but then a new leader stepped in
7072200	7074200	who was more violent and aggressive,
7074200	7076200	and now they're the bad guys and not respectable anymore.
7076200	7078200	The problem is you're now effectively
7078200	7080200	writing a story in which the most prominent
7080200	7082200	villains are an oppressed people
7082200	7084200	who are reacting wrong to being oppressed.
7084200	7086200	Yeah, sure, racism is bad,
7086200	7088200	but you're supposed to take it up with your congressman, guys.
7088200	7090200	There's no nuance here.
7090200	7092200	The White Fang are written to be as unequivocally
7092200	7094200	in the wrong as possible.
7094200	7096200	The main White Fang member we're shown is that guy
7096200	7098200	who didn't care about killing innocent civilians
7098200	7100200	with bombs and who later turns out
7100200	7102200	to want to kill all humans
7102200	7105200	because he sees his people as the superior race.
7105200	7107200	The Faunus are the dominant species
7107200	7109200	of this planet.
7109200	7111200	Oh, also he wants to kill his ex-girlfriend
7111200	7113200	for breaking up with him
7113200	7115200	over the fact he's evil.
7115200	7117200	♪♪
7117200	7119200	The need to write an obvious villain
7119200	7121200	into the story has burned away
7121200	7123200	any relevance to the issues
7123200	7125200	the show was supposedly trying to explore
7125200	7127200	with this aspect of the story.
7127200	7129200	I will make it my mission
7129200	7132200	to destroy everything you love.
7132200	7134200	What is the show trying to say?
7134200	7137200	Racism is bad but don't kill civilians
7137200	7139200	or your ex-girlfriend?
7139200	7140200	Okay.
7140200	7142200	If you want to talk about real world issues,
7142200	7144200	you should actually do it
7144200	7146200	and if you don't, you don't have to.
7146200	7149200	You don't have to have a take on racism
7149200	7151200	and you especially don't have one
7151200	7153200	when you set your story in a fantasy world
7153200	7155200	where racism is over and the real bad guy
7155200	7157200	is a protest group that turned evil.
7157200	7159200	I never wanted this.
7159200	7161200	I wanted equality.
7161200	7163200	So, hey, remember Velvet?
7163200	7165200	That one character who seems like
7165200	7167200	some members of the team intended to be
7167200	7169200	more of a part of the story
7169200	7171200	and then she just wasn't?
7171200	7173200	It makes it just a little bit more egregious
7173200	7175200	that the story is kind of about
7175200	7177200	the persecution of her fucking race.
7177200	7179200	Like, how do you fuck this up this badly?
7179200	7182200	And for the record, that is not how human male teenagers
7182200	7184200	would treat bunny girls if they were real.
7184200	7185200	They would wait on them on hand and foot
7185200	7187200	and beg them to step on me.
7187200	7189200	Absolutely no one was holding a gun
7189200	7191200	to Miles and Kerry's heads and saying
7191200	7193200	to make the show about how they think Malcolm X
7193200	7195200	could have toned it down a little.
7195200	7196200	They did this by choice.
7196200	7198200	They were given free reign to write a story
7198200	7200200	and connect the dots on Monty's fights
7200200	7202200	and this is what they made?
7202200	7204200	Guys, I don't think you have as much to say
7204200	7206200	on this topic as you initially thought.
7206200	7208200	Instead of saying, oh, you know, the humans have a side.
7208200	7210200	They should just respect us more.
7210200	7212200	He turned into, yeah, let's get rid of the humans
7212200	7214200	and then they'll respect us because they'll be dead.
7214200	7216200	Let me just read that back to you
7216200	7218200	just to make that more clear.
7218200	7220200	He turned into, yeah,
7220200	7222200	let's get rid of the humans
7222200	7224200	and then they'll respect us
7224200	7226200	because they'll be dead.
7226200	7228200	Kerry,
7228200	7230200	are you sure you want to go with this?
7230200	7232200	There's also the problem of representation.
7232200	7234200	I'm not gonna criticize the show's diversity
7234200	7236200	or lack of it that much because I don't think
7236200	7238200	that's really my criticism to make
7238200	7240200	and I don't want to risk making it poorly on behalf of people
7240200	7242200	who could say something better about it than me.
7242200	7244200	There are doubtless plenty of people a whole lot
7244200	7246200	less white than me who like the show
7246200	7248200	and don't think it has a representation problem
7248200	7250200	although that's not saying much.
7250200	7252200	Most brands of literal cracker are browner than me.
7252200	7254200	Oh, shit, my fucking laundry.
7254200	7256200	Besides, I'm sure some people will tell you
7256200	7258200	there's plenty of Black people in the first season.
7258200	7260200	However, I can't help but notice
7260200	7262200	that they have managed to write a show
7262200	7264200	that tries, fails, but tries
7264200	7266200	to deal with the impact of racism
7266200	7268200	on a group of people in society but in such a way
7268200	7270200	that they didn't have to have too many
7270200	7272200	non-white characters.
7272200	7274200	Instead, they invented a fictional race
7274200	7276200	which consists almost entirely in the story
7276200	7278200	of white women with cute animal ears
7278200	7280200	and a cool buff white guy
7280200	7282200	with a tail. This was a
7282200	7284200	really clever decision.
7284200	7286200	It turns out the way to get weebs to understand
7286200	7288200	racism is to make the target a cat girl.
7288200	7290200	The white fang are like the Black Panthers
7290200	7292200	but with the emphasis on the panther.
7292200	7294200	I mean, sure, regular racism
7294200	7296200	is over in Remnant but here in the
7296200	7298200	real world, if there were too many Black characters
7298200	7300200	some of your audience members might
7300200	7302200	start to smell politics.
7302200	7304200	Now who will buy our boop shirts?
7304200	7306200	Black lives matter, especially when they're
7306200	7308200	white people with vague animal characteristics
7308200	7310200	but, you know, we can't risk
7310200	7312200	having too many people of color
7312200	7314200	in our show about racism.
7314200	7316200	By the way, you know this animated bit
7316200	7318200	I showed you? That's Blake telling her backstory
7318200	7320200	to Sun. Yes, Sun,
7320200	7322200	another Faunus. She is telling the backstory
7322200	7324200	of a movement Faunus are intimately aware
7324200	7326200	of that Sun says he knows about
7326200	7328200	Are you familiar with the white fang?
7328200	7330200	Of course. I don't think there's a Faunus
7330200	7332200	on the planet who hasn't heard of them.
7332200	7334200	which describes the history of the treatment of Faunus
7334200	7336200	to one of the only other Faunus
7336200	7338200	in the story. Exposition, guys.
7338200	7340200	Have her be telling this to someone who might
7340200	7342200	not know it like any
7342200	7344200	other character in the show.
7344200	7346200	Have you told your friends any of this?
7346200	7348200	Even Sun's asking why she's telling him.
7348200	7350200	And what's up with all of these teens preparing
7350200	7352200	elaborate speeches about their lives
7352200	7354200	and the world? If you try and get away with a monologue
7354200	7356200	that long in my household, your parents
7356200	7358200	tell you you're a horrible son and they hate you.
7358200	7360200	When you remove all of the
7360200	7362200	moral and ethical dimensions from
7362200	7364200	a story, the story disappears
7364200	7366200	too. When it comes down to it,
7366200	7368200	the white fang are a bunch of angry bad guys
7368200	7370200	in masks and all this talk about how
7370200	7372200	they're just reacting to mistreatment.
7372200	7374200	But don't worry, guys. Things are fine.
7374200	7376200	What they're reacting is boring
7376200	7378200	window dressing on a story that's basically
7378200	7380200	about how we have to stop the bad men
7380200	7382200	from blowing up the city and stealing all
7382200	7384200	of the precious jewels. The gang
7384200	7386200	gleefully kill dozens of white fang
7386200	7388200	members, throwing them off a train at high
7388200	7390200	speed where their remains will be shattered
7390200	7392200	and smashed into a pulp, unburied
7392200	7394200	in a collapsing tunnel covered in
7394200	7396200	monsters and explosives, and then later
7396200	7398200	the only exit from this monster-infested
7398200	7400200	tunnel is sealed shut, trapping
7400200	7402200	any of the survivors inside to
7403200	7405200	And sure, maybe they experienced racism
7405200	7407200	and suffering, but they decided
7407200	7409200	to be evil so they got what was coming.
7409200	7411200	If you kill one of these guys, your conscience
7411200	7413200	is clean. Oh, look, that one was black.
7413200	7415200	Do you feel represented yet? I'm not saying
7415200	7417200	you should have sympathy for these characters and that
7417200	7419200	killing them is wrong. What I'm saying is
7419200	7421200	it should be at least slightly more
7421200	7423200	complicated than this, and the fact the story
7423200	7425200	is written so that these characters are
7425200	7427200	just evil is a massive flaw.
7427200	7429200	It's like in the Dark Knight Rises.
7429200	7431200	Bane basically has a
7431200	7433200	point. Gotham is corrupt, and the
7433200	7435200	people are oppressed by a system that seeks to profit
7435200	7437200	from them and find new ways to spy
7437200	7439200	on and criminalize them if they resist.
7439200	7441200	The Occupy Wall Street movement had a lot to
7441200	7443200	say, and a lot of it was true.
7443200	7445200	This is a stock exchange. There's no money you can steal.
7445200	7447200	Really?
7447200	7449200	Then why are you people here? But if you put
7449200	7451200	that in your film, that means something's deeply
7451200	7453200	wrong with your actual society,
7453200	7455200	so Bane also wants to
7455200	7457200	kill everyone with a nuke, so now
7457200	7459200	when Batman beats the shit out of him and everyone
7459200	7461200	who stands in his way, it's not because Batman
7461200	7463200	is a tool of a corrupt establishment.
7463200	7465200	It's because he's heroically stopping this definitely
7465200	7467200	bad bad guy from killing
7467200	7469200	everyone. The moral complexity of the story
7469200	7471200	exists purely to sound cool
7471200	7473200	and get thrown away before it gets anyone
7473200	7475200	to think about the actual problems with our
7475200	7477200	world. The Dark Knight Rises is
7477200	7479200	complete bollocks because a villain who
7479200	7481200	might have a point is consciously
7481200	7483200	rewritten into a bad man in a
7483200	7485200	mask with a big bomb who Batman
7485200	7487200	needs to punch to win. Yay.
7487200	7489200	Good guys hitting the bad guy.
7489200	7491200	Don't think about Wall Street. The writers of RWBY
7491200	7493200	want to look like they're talking about
7493200	7495200	serious real world problems because that
7495200	7497200	seems cool and clever and meaningful,
7497200	7499200	but they don't want to run the risk of spoiling
7499200	7501200	the cartoon fun, and they certainly don't want
7501200	7503200	to risk the people in their audience who think talking
7503200	7505200	about racism is for SJWs to stop
7505200	7507200	watching, so we're left with generic
7507200	7509200	masked bad guys who want to use a train
7509200	7511200	to blow up a city and try
7511200	7513200	to cut off one of our main character's
7513200	7515200	heads with a chainsaw,
7515200	7517200	but maybe some of them have sad backstories
7517200	7519200	behind them being evil murderers
7519200	7521200	who want to kill their ex-girlfriend?
7521200	7523200	Oh, wow, how clever. No thanks.
7523200	7525200	In the actual modern day right now,
7525200	7527200	in fact, literally right now,
7527200	7529200	there are people marching out there in the streets
7529200	7531200	against systemic injustices,
7531200	7533200	racism, and police brutality,
7533200	7535200	and a not insignificant amount of people
7535200	7537200	are dismissing all of this as opportunism,
7537200	7539200	as looting, rioting,
7539200	7541200	people trying to cause chaos and anarchy
7541200	7543200	for no reason. When you tell a story
7543200	7545200	with such a massive fixation on a group
7545200	7547200	like this, what you're doing is saying
7547200	7549200	that there are people in real life like this.
7549200	7551200	Ruby is a deeply stupid
7551200	7553200	person's idea of what
7553200	7555200	racial politics are like. Watching this show
7555200	7557200	through now, I can't help
7557200	7559200	but be struck with the kind of horrible
7559200	7561200	feeling that some people are gonna watch
7561200	7563200	this and go, yeah, that's
7563200	7565200	what they're like, and the idea
7565200	7567200	of this show playing into people's
7567200	7569200	worst instincts is frankly
7569200	7571200	disgusting, but even on a basic story
7571200	7573200	level, having such a simplistic faction
7573200	7575200	like this driving so much of the plot
7575200	7577200	means that all their parts of the plot
7577200	7579200	basically suck. The potential
7579200	7581200	of this entire aspect of the story
7581200	7583200	is seemingly purposefully declawed,
7583200	7585200	rendering the whole thing as pointless
7585200	7587200	as if it hadn't happened. The bad guys
7587200	7589200	could have just been some evil, corrupted monsters
7589200	7591200	who chose to be bad because they're
7591200	7593200	bad for no reason, and the story
7593200	7595200	would have been better because it would have been more honest
7595200	7597200	and a lot less uncomfortable.
7597200	7599200	The end point of this bottomless pit of
7599200	7601200	compromises is, well,
7601200	7603200	a compromised story. A story
7603200	7605200	about nothing telling you very
7605200	7607200	unconvincingly that it's about something
7607200	7609200	actually important in our world
7609200	7611200	right now. No wonder the introduction
7611200	7613200	didn't mention them. They might as well
7613200	7615200	not have been there.
7617200	7619200	We can't really recount the history
7619200	7621200	of RWBY without talking about the death of
7621200	7623200	its creator, can we? After the end of volume
7623200	7625200	two and while in early production
7625200	7627200	on volume three, Monty Oum passed away
7627200	7629200	very suddenly of an allergic
7629200	7631200	reaction during routine surgery.
7631200	7633200	Monty's death was a really tragic event
7633200	7635200	that affected a lot of people, both
7635200	7637200	at Rooster Teeth and in Monty's
7637200	7639200	audience. Monty was well known as a
7639200	7641200	relentlessly passionate worker, and a
7641200	7643200	phrase commonly attributed to him by many,
7643200	7645200	including his widow, was,
7645200	7647200	so to carry on his passion,
7647200	7649200	almost in tribute to his life,
7649200	7651200	they continued making the show.
7651200	7653200	I'm going to keep analyzing the show now,
7653200	7655200	but as a fan of Monty's work since
7655200	7657200	Haloid came out, I want to mention that
7657200	7659200	I don't feel like I've had room to really celebrate
7659200	7661200	his specific skill and talent in this
7661200	7663200	video, so I'm working on another one just
7663200	7665200	about that. I've been a fan of Monty's for
7665200	7667200	most of my adult life, and I've wanted
7667200	7669200	to gush about why his stuff is so great,
7669200	7671200	but to make sure this video has any kind of
7671200	7673200	decent pace, I've had to cut most of it out.
7673200	7675200	I'll try and have that video done soon.
7675200	7677200	So, volume three obviously
7677200	7679200	struggles with a lot of issues. It's still got
7679200	7681200	a lot of the things we've already discussed.
7681200	7683200	It has the additional problem of the team having
7683200	7685200	to make do without its original creator,
7685200	7687200	but if anything, the biggest problem
7687200	7689200	volume three has is that it gets good.
7689200	7691200	Volume three opens on a big
7691200	7693200	tournament between teams from all the
7693200	7695200	anime warrior schools of the world.
7695200	7697200	Every single anime out there eventually does
7697200	7699200	their tournament arc, and, you know,
7699200	7701200	we wanted RWBY to have its version of that.
7701200	7703200	Because how better to prove
7703200	7705200	that RWBY is just like an anime
7705200	7707200	than to give it a tournament arc?
7707200	7709200	I mean, a story would
7709200	7711200	have been nice, but mid-fight, the announcers
7711200	7713200	played by the professors from the first
7713200	7715200	two seasons explain the entire tournament
7715200	7717200	system. For those of you
7717200	7719200	just now joining us, the show
7719200	7721200	pauses to tell you how the entire
7721200	7723200	system works. Again, exposition,
7723200	7725200	guys. That's just not how you do it.
7725200	7727200	If this is your first time watching,
7727200	7729200	allow us to break down the rules.
7729200	7731200	They're explaining this in the middle
7731200	7733200	of the fight at the worst possible time
7733200	7735200	to be explaining it. In fact, look at how
7735200	7737200	even worse done this is when you realize
7737200	7739200	it's being done diegetically. Imagine
7739200	7741200	watching the tournament on TV when
7741200	7743200	during a fight that is currently
7743200	7745200	underway, the announcers interrupt
7745200	7747200	to tell you how the tournament works.
7747200	7749200	In case people who've never seen the tournament
7749200	7751200	before just tuned in,
7751200	7753200	there are infinite other ways of conveying
7753200	7755200	this information to the audience, and they chose
7755200	7757200	now in this incredibly clunky
7757200	7759200	way?
7761700	7763700	If you're just joining us, the objective of golf
7763700	7765700	is to get the ball in the hole
7765700	7767700	in as few strokes as possible.
7767700	7769700	Points are tabulated by the amount of strokes
7769700	7771700	under par, and remember, it's the lowest
7771700	7773700	score that wins. Oh, it appears
7773700	7775700	Jimmy has finished the course while I was
7775700	7777700	talking. So the exposition is about as well
7777700	7779700	done as it's always been. The fights also
7779700	7781700	feel written now. Much more
7781700	7783700	emphasis is placed on dialogue
7783700	7785700	and specific moves than
7785700	7787700	before, which slows things down
7787700	7789700	and really messes with the pace. If you're
7789700	7791700	just joining us, one of the big problems with the
7791700	7793700	first two volumes was the constant influx
7793700	7795700	of new characters who aren't on screen
7795700	7797700	enough for you to learn anything interesting about them
7797700	7799700	or care but manage to suck up enough
7799700	7801700	screen time that the actual characters
7801700	7803700	don't have room to breathe. Remember how
7803700	7805700	Neptune's entire relevance to the story of the
7805700	7807700	show was that Weiss wanted to go to the prom
7807700	7809700	with him and how after that I never
7809700	7811700	had to bring him up again? So all the
7811700	7813700	screen time that went into him was a waste, wasn't
7813700	7815700	it? The writers have noticed this problem
7815700	7817700	and decided the solution is to add a hundred
7817700	7819700	million more characters. Since it's the
7819700	7821700	tournament arc now, just like in real
7821700	7823700	animes, we get new teams to throw
7823700	7825700	into the story for our other characters we
7825700	7827700	kinda know to fight against, and
7827700	7829700	you know exactly which ones you won't
7829700	7831700	see in fights because they're just 2D
7831700	7833700	concept art. But that's not all!
7833700	7835700	We also have more characters who
7835700	7837700	are just here now.
7837700	7839700	Winter Schnee, Weiss' sister,
7839700	7841700	is here to not do much of anything
7841700	7843700	and just kinda turn up for a couple
7843700	7845700	episodes to give Weiss a pep talk
7845700	7847700	and explain for the benefit of the audience
7847700	7849700	how their semblance works. To Weiss,
7849700	7851700	the only other person who already
7851700	7853700	knows how it fucking works!
7853700	7855700	Oh, and also to have a pointless fight with Crow,
7855700	7857700	another character who has finally turned
7857700	7859700	up after getting name-dropped a bunch
7859700	7861700	in previous seasons. Here's a thing you probably
7861700	7863700	noticed by now, but every character is usually
7863700	7865700	named for a fairy tale character of some kind
7865700	7867700	like Ruby is Red Riding Hood, Nora
7867700	7869700	is Thor, Jean Arc is Joan
7869700	7871700	of Arc, Blake is fucking
7871700	7873700	bad, and Crow, Glinda,
7873700	7875700	Ozpin, the General, and some others
7875700	7877700	are based vaguely after characters from
7877700	7879700	the Wizard of Oz. Anyway, the gimmick is wearing
7879700	7881700	so thin now that they're really
7881700	7883700	struggling to come up with characters that fit
7883700	7885700	this scheme. In one of the fights, Yang and Weiss
7885700	7887700	fight against Neon Cat,
7887700	7889700	a Faunus character inspired by
7889700	7891700	Nyan Cat, and Flint Coal, the son
7891700	7893700	of a dust store owner who Weiss' family
7893700	7895700	wait, Flint Coal?
7895700	7897700	This is like the second black
7897700	7899700	character in the show and his name is
7899700	7901700	Flint Coal!
7901700	7903700	Oh, no! Okay, so
7903700	7905700	it's not as bad as it sounds. It's actually
7905700	7907700	a clever, clever reference
7907700	7909700	to Rooster Teeth's Minecraft
7909700	7910700	Let's Play.
7910700	7912700	Dude, I got Coal and Flint?
7912700	7914700	Oh, you're set. That'd be a cool name.
7914700	7916700	Flint Coal. Would it though? Yeah, you'd be like
7916700	7918700	a, like an international private investigator
7918700	7920700	mystery type. You'd have to be black though, right?
7920700	7921700	I dig it.
7921700	7923700	What's his weapon called anyway?
7923700	7925700	You see, all the characters' weapons have names.
7925700	7927700	They get mentioned in behind-the-scenes material
7927700	7929700	or named in the show. Crescent Rose.
7929700	7931700	One of the most... Mertonaster.
7931700	7933700	Gambol! Shrow?
7933700	7935700	But Flint Coal. Flint
7935700	7937700	Coal doesn't appear in
7937700	7939700	many other RWBY materials, so
7939700	7941700	we've not had an opportunity to learn his
7941700	7943700	weapon's name, so the RWBY wiki
7943700	7945700	has had no choice but
7945700	7947700	to list it as
7947700	7949700	Weapon Trumpet!
7949700	7951700	Ha ha ha ha!
7951700	7953700	Ha ha ha ha!
7953700	7955700	But the thing about season three is that it
7955700	7957700	gets good. Midway through this volume,
7957700	7959700	the plot of RWBY
7959700	7961700	starts. The main characters take
7961700	7963700	Pyrrha aside and say, hey, so what's actually
7963700	7965700	happening here is there are four maidens?
7965700	7967700	Women with incredible magical
7967700	7969700	powers. Not like semblances or dust.
7969700	7971700	They're not magic. This is real magic.
7971700	7973700	Each time a maiden dies, someone else inherits
7973700	7975700	the maiden's power. Oh, so it's just
7975700	7977700	Avatar again? Really? Okay.
7977700	7979700	Each of the maidens represents one of the
7979700	7981700	four seasons. It's the four seasons,
7981700	7983700	not the four elements, so it's not like Avatar.
7983700	7985700	Oh, hang on. There's four different elements
7985700	7987700	of dust, aren't there? Wow, it's Avatar all the
7987700	7989700	way down, isn't it? It's really boring,
7989700	7991700	and the rules of who gets to be a maiden and why
7991700	7993700	are really silly, and the exposition of it
7993700	7995700	is bad, but it's not that bad because
7995700	7997700	the show has now introduced Crow.
7997700	7999700	How does the power choose?
7999700	8001700	Through a series of stupid and
8001700	8003700	convoluted rules. The writers made
8003700	8005700	the genuinely clever decision to have
8005700	8007700	him annoyed and bored by
8007700	8009700	most of the characters and plot of RWBY.
8009700	8011700	Did you miss me? Did you miss me?
8011700	8013700	No.
8013700	8015700	Crow spends half the show ridiculing
8015700	8017700	all the characters that have been taking themselves
8017700	8019700	seriously for hours with no one questioning
8019700	8021700	them before. If you were one of my men,
8021700	8023700	I would have you shot. If I was one of
8023700	8025700	your men, I'd shoot myself.
8025700	8027700	So even if you aren't really enjoying
8027700	8029700	the story or the ridiculous amount of plot
8029700	8031700	being dumped in your lap regarding
8031700	8033700	the maidens and Cinder, the real
8033700	8035700	villain of the last two seasons who hasn't done
8035700	8037700	much, who it turns out actually has
8037700	8039700	stolen half of a maiden's power and
8039700	8041700	might inherit the other half if the maiden dies,
8041700	8043700	it's not so bad because another
8043700	8045700	character in the scene isn't enjoying
8045700	8047700	it either. It's ironic that everyone else
8047700	8049700	is birdbrained. So it turns out
8049700	8051700	that the story's really always been about
8051700	8053700	these four maidens, each representing
8053700	8055700	one of the four seasons and Cinder
8055700	8057700	wanting to cause enough commotion that
8057700	8059700	she can get to the fall maiden and kill
8059700	8061700	her to ensure she gets her power.
8061700	8063700	There's some pretty genuine drama now as Pyrrha
8063700	8065700	is offered the choice to take the maiden's soul
8065700	8067700	into her body, a process which will probably
8067700	8069700	kill her but prevent the power falling
8069700	8071700	into the wrong hands. A character has to choose
8071700	8073700	between having her own life and
8073700	8075700	doing what might be the right thing for
8075700	8077700	the world. Pyrrha is actually given
8077700	8079700	an identity and questions
8079700	8081700	and important choices to explore
8081700	8083700	outside of her relationship to Jaune
8083700	8085700	and it makes her the strongest character
8085700	8087700	in the show. It makes it easier to ignore
8087700	8089700	that the plot is basically yet another avatar
8089700	8091700	thing. There being people with magical
8091700	8093700	powers whose abilities go to someone else
8093700	8095700	when they die is very avatar
8095700	8097700	adjacent, but you don't even think about it
8097700	8099700	because the exposition gets made fun of by
8099700	8101700	one character and another character has to make
8101700	8103700	a real choice about it, so it actually
8103700	8105700	works. One of Cinder's goons,
8105700	8107700	Emerald, has the power to make people hallucinate
8107700	8109700	and makes Yang think her guy's attacking
8109700	8111700	her after a round has ended, and while
8111700	8113700	she thinks she's defending herself, the rest of the world
8113700	8115700	sees what's actually happening, which is Yang
8115700	8117700	breaking a guy's fucking leg
8117700	8119700	for no reason. Don't worry. He's a villain
8119700	8121700	and he's in on it and he has robot legs,
8121700	8123700	so it's fine, but no one knows he has robot legs
8123700	8125700	so this causes a lot of unrest among
8125700	8127700	the people watching and everyone seeing it on TV
8127700	8129700	and fear and anxiety attract
8129700	8131700	Grimm, so they all start ominously moving
8131700	8133700	toward the city and Yang's freaking
8133700	8135700	the fuck out because she thinks she's losing her
8135700	8137700	mind and everyone's mad at her. It's like
8137700	8139700	plot! There's plot happening, guys!
8139700	8141700	Everybody, wake up! The characters
8141700	8143700	finally have to do something!
8143700	8145700	Then, right after, while Pyrrha and Penny
8145700	8147700	are fighting in the tournament, Emerald makes Pyrrha
8147700	8149700	see way worse attacks coming, which
8149700	8151700	causes her to really push her power
8151700	8153700	and the tiny wires all Penny's weapons
8153700	8155700	are attached to wrap around Penny
8155700	8157700	and Penny, the character we've known
8157700	8159700	for a whole season plus, like, five seconds
8159700	8161700	at the end of volume one, is torn
8161700	8163700	to pieces. I mean,
8163700	8165700	holy shit! She's a robot
8165700	8167700	so it's not like a disembowelment
8167700	8169700	but this was a character and she's
8169700	8171700	dead. It's fucked up.
8171700	8173700	Everyone goes wild.
8173700	8175700	Cinder hacks the main frame
8175700	8177700	and gives a speech about humans
8177700	8179700	bad and a million billion Grimm
8179700	8181700	descend on the city and school
8181700	8183700	and the last hour of volume three starts
8183700	8185700	with a fucking bang. Everything
8185700	8187700	bad is happening to everyone
8187700	8189700	everywhere all the time. A main character
8189700	8191700	is fucking dead in pieces.
8191700	8193700	People are crying. This isn't your daddy's
8193700	8195700	generic and then bad guys attack the
8195700	8197700	city. This isn't volume two shit.
8197700	8199700	The city is being destroyed.
8199700	8201700	Caligula gets broken out of the prison
8201700	8203700	he was locked in at the end of season two and
8203700	8205700	starts hacking the army robots and blowing
8205700	8207700	ships out of the sky. Everything's
8207700	8209700	happening. Everyone's fucked.
8209700	8211700	Bring them to their knees.
8211700	8213700	The civil rights protesters still talk
8213700	8215700	like they're fucking evil but, I mean, generally
8215700	8217700	it's pretty good. Ruby's threatening a giant
8217700	8219700	bird with one of Penny's swords because she's
8219700	8221700	too distraught to think straight and
8221700	8223700	then it flies at her and everyone's
8223700	8225700	lockers ram into it and pin it to the ground
8225700	8227700	and everyone we've seen so far turns up
8227700	8229700	to fight. Look, even Weapon Trumpet
8229700	8231700	is here. This absolutely incredible
8231700	8233700	shot was done by Dylan Gu. It's
8233700	8235700	my favorite shot in the show. Just
8235700	8237700	narrowly edging out the Zwei attack
8237700	8239700	and there's great setup and payoff to it because
8239700	8241700	we've known since volume one that characters
8241700	8243700	can call their lockers to them to get their
8243700	8245700	weapon out whenever they want it. So having them be
8245700	8247700	used as weapons and just smash into this
8247700	8249700	thing all at once, it's just so great.
8249700	8251700	So everyone's fighting monsters. There's some
8251700	8253700	great action. Ruby fights, uh,
8253700	8255700	check Malcolm McDowell's IMDb
8255700	8257700	for another comical name.
8257700	8259700	The real world is
8259700	8261700	cold! And he's kicking her and giving
8261700	8263700	a speech about the world being a cruel, cold
8263700	8265700	place. As for me,
8265700	8267700	I'll do what I do best.
8267700	8269700	Survive!
8269700	8271700	And he's fucking dead.
8271700	8273700	They just killed him! He's dead! I mean, holy
8273700	8275700	shit, right? They're destroying the main
8275700	8277700	setting of the story so far and
8277700	8279700	killing off villains in the process.
8279700	8281700	It's great! For a few short
8281700	8283700	episodes, the show isn't like Avatar
8283700	8285700	or anything else on its homework list.
8285700	8287700	You're briefly glimpsing what it looks like
8287700	8289700	when it's trying to be itself
8289700	8291700	when it's being Ruby.
8291700	8293700	You know this is why the rest of the show
8293700	8295700	is so frustrating, right? Because every now and
8295700	8297700	then something like this happens and you
8297700	8299700	wanna see the show this stuff came from.
8299700	8301700	Ruby opens Neo's umbrella and the wind
8301700	8303700	fucking blows her off the ship
8303700	8305700	they're flying on hundreds of feet in the air.
8305700	8307700	She's dead! She's fucking
8307700	8309700	dead! Until people start to get bored
8309700	8311700	with the show and realize that most of
8311700	8313700	the new characters are really boring. Maybe you
8313700	8315700	weren't supposed to assume the fall was gonna
8315700	8317700	kill her, but she doesn't appear for like
8317700	8319700	three more seasons after this.
8319700	8321700	So either the writers had intended to kill
8321700	8323700	her and then changed her minds because they wanted the character
8323700	8325700	back or they just forgot she existed for
8325700	8327700	literally fucking years.
8327700	8329700	Blake gets attacked and stabbed
8329700	8331700	by Adam and he shares his incredibly good
8331700	8333700	motivation for his actions. Uh,
8333700	8335700	I'm bad and I'm going to kill you
8335700	8337700	and Yang tries to help but Adam cuts
8337700	8339700	her arm off. This moment is still so
8339700	8341700	dramatic and visually done so
8341700	8343700	well. They fake out for a second that
8343700	8345700	Blake's head gets cut off but actually
8345700	8347700	it was one of these illusions and she gets away
8347700	8349700	but what's amazing about this part of this show
8349700	8351700	is that for a second I believed
8351700	8353700	that they might, they just might
8353700	8355700	actually kill one of the four
8355700	8357700	main characters. Like, if that's not proof
8357700	8359700	that this show is onto something story-wise
8359700	8361700	for a hot minute, I don't know what is. Seeing
8361700	8363700	Pyrrha trying to do the right thing while
8363700	8365700	living with the fact she just accidentally
8365700	8367700	killed one of her friends and seeing that
8367700	8369700	affect her thinking is actually
8369700	8371700	incredible and from a character perspective
8371700	8373700	it's the best stuff you'll ever see in this show.
8373700	8375700	It would have been really helped if Pyrrha
8375700	8377700	and Penny had actually been friends
8377700	8379700	or like on screen together
8379700	8381700	basically at all before the fight
8381700	8382700	where Penny dies.
8382700	8384700	It's an honor to finally meet you.
8384700	8386700	Like, at this point it's actively offensive
8386700	8388700	like how poorly spent
8388700	8390700	the time leading up to this fight is
8390700	8392700	and just how much better it could have been.
8392700	8394700	If they'd, like, given these characters a relationship
8394700	8396700	before one of them killed the other
8396700	8398700	like wouldn't that have been meaningful?
8398700	8400700	Salutations, Pyrrha Nekos.
8400700	8403700	Do you remember when she said salutations?
8403700	8404700	Do you remember?
8404700	8406700	Pyrrha decides to let herself become
8406700	8408700	the vessel for the previous maiden but they're
8408700	8410700	too late and Cinder kills the maiden
8410700	8412700	and then Pyrrha shoves Miles into his locker
8412700	8413700	where he belonged.
8413700	8414700	I mean, Pyrrha sends Jaune away
8414700	8416700	against his will so he can survive
8416700	8418700	but not before fully confessing her feelings
8418700	8420700	and kissing him and tries to take Cinder on
8420700	8422700	but she fails and gets shot in the heart
8422700	8423700	by an arrow.
8423700	8425700	Ruby turns up just too late to save her
8425700	8427700	and watches as Cinder dissolves
8427700	8429700	Pyrrha's body into nothing.
8429700	8431700	Jesus fucking Christ!
8431700	8433700	They are not messing around pretending this is a show
8433700	8434700	for kids anymore, are they?
8434700	8435700	And then Ruby goes,
8435700	8436700	"[screams in pain"]
8436700	8438700	and turns out to have a magic power
8438700	8440700	because she has silver eyes and this means
8440700	8442700	she can instantly kill Grimm or something.
8442700	8443700	I don't know.
8443700	8445700	You learn about this power existing right now
8445700	8446700	seven hours into the show.
8446700	8447700	It's not great,
8447700	8449700	but we've already talked about how weird that is.
8449700	8451700	On the whole, the absolute chaos
8451700	8453700	and world-changing events and the treatment
8453700	8455700	of characters and emotionally interesting
8455700	8457700	story moves that take place in the last
8457700	8459700	four-and-a-bit episodes of volume three
8459700	8462700	make it briefly a great show, pure and simple,
8462700	8464700	and this is a weird place to end a video
8464700	8466700	about the problems with a show
8466700	8468700	by talking about how good it was for a while
8468700	8470700	and how promisingly it left its doors open,
8470700	8473700	but this is really why talking about Ruby
8473700	8475700	is so artistically interesting because it's always
8475700	8477700	on the cusp of being good like this,
8477700	8479700	and sometimes it really is,
8479700	8482700	but that's also why the show is such a disappointment.
8482700	8484700	That part of season three damns
8484700	8486700	the rest of the surrounding show even more
8486700	8488700	by telling you to have expectations
8488700	8490700	because for a second,
8490700	8492700	you can see how good it really could be.
8492700	8494700	The show hasn't got good exactly.
8494700	8496700	It's just had a really good time
8496700	8499700	making serious changes to the status quo of the story,
8499700	8502700	but you can't sustain a story on Red Weddings alone.
8502700	8505700	The new story beginning with volume four onwards
8505700	8508700	has to actually be good for this to all work out,
8508700	8511700	and ultimately, it doesn't.
8511700	8513700	To really explore the more specific problems
8513700	8516700	with volumes four onwards, we'd need a whole other video.
8516700	8518700	I wanted to talk in specific about the first three seasons
8518700	8521700	because they stand out as the time the show seemed
8521700	8523700	most likely to be going somewhere
8523700	8525700	and therefore feel particularly bad
8525700	8527700	when they only do it for such brief bursts
8527700	8530700	in Monty's fights, in the promising storylines
8530700	8532700	or character moments that get forgotten or dropped,
8532700	8534700	and in the way they really satisfyingly
8534700	8536700	did things with Pyrrha's character,
8536700	8538700	but now that character is gone,
8538700	8540700	so the show's back to having dozens of characters
8540700	8544700	with barely one interesting personality between them.
8544700	8547700	The good parts of the show really can be great,
8547700	8549700	and because of this, all the bad parts
8549700	8551700	are worse than bad.
8551700	8554700	They're also a shame.
8556700	8561700	♪
8561700	8564700	Creating art is like jumping off a cliff
8564700	8566700	and building your wings on the way down.
8566700	8568700	If you want to only start when you know
8568700	8570700	exactly how to get everything right,
8570700	8572700	you never actually will.
8572700	8574700	You never really know what you're doing
8574700	8576700	until after you've started doing it.
8576700	8579700	In the past couple of years of this weird life,
8579700	8581700	I've met quite a few people who knew Monty,
8581700	8584700	and several of them have told me the same story.
8584700	8586700	He'd say that he felt like the first season,
8586700	8588700	first season and a half, first two seasons,
8588700	8590700	based on who was telling it,
8590700	8592700	weren't turning out super great so far,
8592700	8594700	but it didn't matter if it was bad right now
8594700	8596700	because in his mind, the whole thing,
8596700	8598700	the act of creation itself even,
8598700	8600700	was a process of learning.
8600700	8603700	If you can really figure out how to make something,
8603700	8605700	really get the production and workflow down,
8605700	8607700	figure out what works in the writing,
8607700	8609700	and through this process find the core
8609700	8611700	of what this thing you're making is really supposed to be,
8611700	8613700	it won't matter how bad it started out
8613700	8615700	because where it went will be great.
8615700	8617700	There's a certain manic energy,
8617700	8620700	a compelling power in these early seasons of RWBY.
8620700	8622700	Even if you're having a bad time,
8622700	8624700	you feel pulled along, like you just wanna see
8624700	8625700	how it ends up.
8625700	8627700	This tone will change.
8627700	8629700	As the show continues to be written and paced
8629700	8631700	in frustrating ways and cheat off the answers
8631700	8634700	on its anime homework and its most interesting,
8634700	8637700	unique aspects are continuously downplayed or ignored,
8637700	8639700	it becomes more and more clear
8639700	8641700	that you'll never see the show become itself.
8641700	8643700	I didn't watch Monty Oum's RWBY
8643700	8645700	to see Miles Luna's avatar,
8645700	8647700	but that's what people are getting.
8647700	8649700	If the creators of RWBY had started learning
8649700	8651700	from their mistakes and taken to heart
8651700	8653700	the good faith criticisms the people
8653700	8656700	who wanted to love their show were making,
8656700	8658700	RWBY could have really been something,
8658700	8661700	but instead it'll be remembered by a majority of people
8661700	8663700	as a series of really good trailers
8663700	8665700	with some really strange dialogue,
8665700	8667700	some really cool fight scenes to watch
8667700	8669700	out of context on YouTube,
8669700	8671700	and inexplicably quite good episodes
8671700	8673700	at the end of the third season.
8673700	8676700	The real shame of RWBY is everyone whose work goes unsung
8676700	8678700	because it's in a show that sucks.
8678700	8680700	People like Shane Neuville who left the show
8680700	8682700	and released a massive open letter
8682700	8684700	detailing his feelings about the company's treatment
8684700	8686700	of the show after Monty's passing,
8686700	8688700	or Harley Dwartz who contributes a lot
8688700	8690700	to making some of the best parts of the show,
8690700	8692700	or the many other animators and artists
8692700	8694700	who are still to this day putting time
8694700	8696700	and effort and attention into things
8696700	8698700	that get ignored or thrown away
8698700	8700700	or just executed terribly
8700700	8702700	because the storytelling isn't there.
8702700	8704700	It's clear that a lot of really skilled artists
8704700	8707700	and animators work on RWBY to this day,
8707700	8709700	but the mishandling of the show's story
8709700	8711700	and production means that it fails
8711700	8713700	to reflect their talents, and that is probably
8713700	8715700	the worst thing a show can do.
8715700	8718700	It's important to talk about this show
8718700	8720700	and where it went wrong because while this is
8720700	8722700	the first attempt to make an animated web series
8722700	8724700	of basically anything like this scale,
8724700	8726700	it won't necessarily be the last,
8726700	8728700	and that means we have to learn all the lessons
8728700	8730700	we can from its production problems
8730700	8733700	and failures or we'll see them get repeated again.
8733700	8735700	I want there to be a show one day
8735700	8737700	that represents what RWBY could have been,
8737700	8739700	and that means recognizing the show's potential
8739700	8741700	and where it went wrong.
8741700	8743700	RWBY will probably never be the show
8743700	8745700	it promised to be, but with the gift
8745700	8747700	of learning the lessons it has to teach,
8747700	8750700	maybe something else can be.
8750700	8753700	Thank you very much for watching.

8783700	8785700	There's a video on his channel about the process of making it
8785700	8787700	which is super great and you should check that out as well.
8787700	8790700	Note to self, have the YouTube pop-up thing do that now.
8790700	8792700	I don't know what it's called.
8792700	8794700	I talked about some serious issues in this video
8794700	8796700	and it didn't feel right monetizing a video
8796700	8799700	while talking about real-world problems like that.
8799700	8801700	I was going to announce in the Faunus chapter
8801700	8803700	that I was gonna give the ad revenue
8803700	8805700	from this video to a bail fund,
8805700	8807700	but rooster teeth can be very strange
8807700	8809700	about copyright and monetization
8809700	8812700	and I don't want to make a promise I can't keep.
8812700	8815700	I'll post an update if we end up being able to do that.
8815700	8818700	Thanks a lot and, yeah, I love you.
