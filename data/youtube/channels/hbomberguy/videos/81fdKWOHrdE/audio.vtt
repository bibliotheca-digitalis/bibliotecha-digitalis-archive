00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
♪♪

00:04.800 --> 00:06.040
When it was first announced,

00:06.040 --> 00:08.340
RWBY seemed like it was gonna be great.

00:08.340 --> 00:11.760
It was produced by a darling of independent web content

00:11.760 --> 00:14.500
and created by a legendary animation genius

00:14.500 --> 00:16.420
and some of his most trusted colleagues

00:16.420 --> 00:18.000
and written by two...

00:18.000 --> 00:20.500
but even with all this stuff in place,

00:20.500 --> 00:22.120
RWBY's pretty bad.

00:22.120 --> 00:25.160
The basic concept, a 3-D anime about monster hunters,

00:25.160 --> 00:27.380
is great, and when it tries to flesh this out,

00:27.380 --> 00:29.420
there's some really interesting ideas at times,

00:29.420 --> 00:32.040
and in brief moments, it's got scenes or segments

00:32.040 --> 00:33.460
that suddenly really work,

00:33.460 --> 00:36.080
but overall, it's confusing and frustrating.

00:36.080 --> 00:37.300
It isn't fun to watch,

00:37.300 --> 00:39.580
and no matter how much attention you give it,

00:39.580 --> 00:41.180
your attention is only rewarded

00:41.180 --> 00:43.720
with more writing or animation problems.

00:43.720 --> 00:45.840
It's not, like, the worst show ever made,

00:45.840 --> 00:47.460
but RWBY's failures matter

00:47.460 --> 00:50.000
because it really could have been something,

00:50.000 --> 00:52.500
and that makes the parts that were good even sadder

00:52.500 --> 00:54.920
because you can always see what it could have been

00:54.920 --> 00:56.500
and maybe almost was.

00:56.500 --> 00:59.000
I wanna just call this garbage and move on with my life,

00:59.040 --> 01:00.380
but it's just not that simple,

01:00.380 --> 01:01.500
which is a shame for me.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.540
It means I can't use the most popular video title

01:03.540 --> 01:05.200
I use when I criticize media.

01:05.200 --> 01:08.080
Is this it? Is this gonna be on my fucking gravestone?

01:08.080 --> 01:10.460
Eight long years into production

01:10.460 --> 01:13.120
with a massive crew by web video standards

01:13.120 --> 01:15.120
and its eighth season on the way.

01:15.120 --> 01:17.200
Sorry, volume. They call them volume?

01:17.200 --> 01:19.500
The show has garnered a pretty large following

01:19.500 --> 01:21.420
and a super devout fan base,

01:21.420 --> 01:22.760
and it's easy to see why.

01:22.760 --> 01:26.340
The show frequently threatens to suddenly become good.

01:26.340 --> 01:28.340
People saw what it promised

01:28.380 --> 01:30.300
and believed it would deliver.

01:30.300 --> 01:31.960
The pieces are all still there,

01:31.960 --> 01:34.100
and sometimes, just often enough

01:34.100 --> 01:35.520
for people to keep watching,

01:35.520 --> 01:38.140
it looks like they're going to fall into place.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.140
♪♪

01:41.380 --> 01:43.020
But they never have,

01:43.020 --> 01:44.980
and it's starting to become clear

01:44.980 --> 01:46.640
that they probably never will,

01:46.640 --> 01:49.140
and that makes the show infinitely more disappointing

01:49.140 --> 01:51.140
than something you could easily say is worse,

01:51.140 --> 01:53.060
and the reasons why the show has failed

01:53.060 --> 01:54.480
to become what it could have been

01:54.480 --> 01:56.640
are multitudinous and interlinked.

01:56.660 --> 01:59.320
There's a million distractingly small problems

01:59.320 --> 02:01.120
that ultimately aren't that big a deal

02:01.120 --> 02:02.880
and weaken real criticism

02:02.880 --> 02:04.460
by being given too much attention,

02:04.460 --> 02:06.420
and every major problem ties into

02:06.420 --> 02:08.960
and is responsible for every other major problem

02:08.960 --> 02:11.460
in a way that makes it almost impossible to unpick.

02:11.460 --> 02:15.600
RWBY may be the first show ever to be holistically bad,

02:15.600 --> 02:17.600
but do not despair, fellow believers

02:17.600 --> 02:20.860
in objective analysis of cartoons.

02:20.860 --> 02:22.640
I'm here to defend you

02:22.640 --> 02:24.900
and eviscerate RWBY with a sword

02:24.900 --> 02:26.860
made of logic and reason.

02:26.860 --> 02:29.120
It's a metaphorical sword, really.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.580
Oh, also it can turn into a gun

02:30.580 --> 02:32.580
because that would be cool.

02:32.580 --> 02:35.340
Uh, this is how media criticism works, right?

02:35.340 --> 02:37.920
So this time on the increasingly infrequent

02:37.920 --> 02:41.140
cries for help my family refuses to believe is my job,

02:41.140 --> 02:42.920
I'll be exploring the problems that started

02:42.920 --> 02:44.920
in the early years of the show's development,

02:44.920 --> 02:46.300
how they set the tone for a show

02:46.300 --> 02:48.220
that never quite ended up where it could have been,

02:48.220 --> 02:50.180
why it matters that such a promising thing

02:50.180 --> 02:51.100
turned out this way,

02:51.100 --> 02:54.140
and exactly how and why so many decent ideas

02:54.140 --> 02:55.760
can often get misunderstood

02:55.760 --> 02:58.600
when writers simply borrow them from other shows they like.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.800
I'm focusing primarily on the first three seasons

03:00.800 --> 03:01.940
of the show in this video

03:01.940 --> 03:03.860
because RWBY can be pretty neatly divided

03:03.860 --> 03:05.320
into two separate eras

03:05.320 --> 03:07.180
with two different sets of problems

03:07.180 --> 03:08.600
that don't fully overlap,

03:08.600 --> 03:10.060
and for the purposes of criticism,

03:10.060 --> 03:11.940
I intend to treat them as distinct entities

03:11.940 --> 03:12.780
in most cases.

03:12.780 --> 03:13.820
If you're a fan of the show,

03:13.820 --> 03:15.520
you're probably dreading the worst here,

03:15.520 --> 03:17.480
although if you're a fan of the second half of the show,

03:17.480 --> 03:18.780
you probably already agree

03:18.780 --> 03:20.120
with most of what I'm going to say,

03:20.120 --> 03:21.820
but in any case, if you like RWBY

03:21.820 --> 03:23.320
and you still watch this video,

03:23.380 --> 03:25.800
I love you and thank you for joining me on this journey.

03:25.800 --> 03:28.840
My goal isn't to make anyone think less of a show,

03:28.840 --> 03:30.920
just to think more about it.

03:30.920 --> 03:33.560
It's important to be critical of media you enjoy,

03:33.560 --> 03:35.260
and there is a lot to enjoy about RWBY,

03:35.260 --> 03:37.180
so I hope to give credit where it's due,

03:37.180 --> 03:38.600
and in the places that aren't as good,

03:38.600 --> 03:40.100
well, that's way more interesting.

03:40.100 --> 03:41.680
It's often said that failure

03:41.680 --> 03:43.600
is one of the best learning experiences,

03:43.600 --> 03:44.720
and in that respect,

03:44.720 --> 03:47.400
RWBY has a lot of good things to teach.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.900
Oh, do we not have a cool animated intro for this video?

03:50.900 --> 03:53.900
It's about an anime. It would've been kind of cool.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.400
Are we just going with the standard?

03:55.400 --> 03:58.080
What? It's fine. I mean, it's a bit underwhelming, but...

03:58.080 --> 03:59.820
Hey, do you all remember Rooster Teeth?

03:59.820 --> 04:02.240
No, I don't mean AT&T's, Warner Media's,

04:02.240 --> 04:03.700
Otter Media's Rooster Teeth,

04:03.700 --> 04:05.200
the company with hundreds of employees

04:05.200 --> 04:08.340
that makes podcasts and shows and movies and games.

04:08.340 --> 04:11.540
Rooster Teeth is starting video game development.

04:11.540 --> 04:13.800
It's a company that's been around for a long time.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.800
It's a company that's been around for a long time.

04:16.780 --> 04:18.780
It's a company that's been around for a long time.

04:18.780 --> 04:19.780
It's a company that's been around for a long time.

04:19.780 --> 04:21.280
I mean, Rooster Teeth,

04:21.280 --> 04:22.880
the five or so people who made

04:22.880 --> 04:24.660
Red vs. Blue in their bedroom.

04:24.660 --> 04:26.840
Hey. Yeah?

04:26.840 --> 04:28.540
You ever wonder why we're here?

04:28.540 --> 04:29.960
It's one of life's great mysteries, isn't it?

04:29.960 --> 04:32.880
Popular on the web in the early years was machinima.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.880
People would pose and act characters in games,

04:35.880 --> 04:39.340
effectively using video games as a medium for making movies.

04:39.340 --> 04:41.800
Not in my diner, you don't know Lumberjacks.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.020
The new city design, it just say no Lumberjacks.

04:44.020 --> 04:45.180
Oh, yeah, I didn't see that sign.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.940
Red vs. Blue wasn't the first attempt

04:46.940 --> 04:48.200
to make something like this,

04:48.200 --> 04:50.200
but it was far and away the most popular one.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.700
All right, here's the plan.

04:52.700 --> 04:55.460
And it was shockingly successful.

04:55.460 --> 04:57.960
People who had no idea what machinima was

04:57.960 --> 04:59.500
knew about Red vs. Blue.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.880
How many people could make a show half as good as this

05:01.880 --> 05:03.680
using what amounts to a microphone

05:03.680 --> 05:04.840
and a copy of Halo?

05:04.840 --> 05:07.340
I certainly couldn't, and I know because I tried,

05:07.340 --> 05:09.140
and I'm so glad no one saw that.

05:09.140 --> 05:11.880
I was saved by not knowing how to upload videos

05:11.880 --> 05:12.980
when I was 12.

05:12.980 --> 05:16.360
YouTube would simply not accept my Windows Movie Maker file.

05:16.360 --> 05:18.200
As a business, 2000's Rooster Teeth

05:18.200 --> 05:20.740
were incredibly smart, a tiny team producing

05:20.740 --> 05:23.500
a fairly simple show made in a video game engine

05:23.500 --> 05:25.540
but managing to promote it and build it

05:25.540 --> 05:27.880
into a recognizable brand of its own.

05:27.880 --> 05:29.080
The show had merch.

05:29.080 --> 05:32.000
Not Halo merch, but Red vs. Blue merch.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.080
Rooster Teeth had done what was basically impossible

05:35.080 --> 05:38.540
and successfully built a business making machinima.

05:38.540 --> 05:40.760
Not even machinima did that.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.580
So yeah, well done to Bernie Burns

05:42.580 --> 05:43.620
and the rest of the team.

05:43.620 --> 05:45.000
Anyway, then it kept going for, like,

05:45.000 --> 05:46.920
a decade while I wasn't looking.

05:46.920 --> 05:49.140
No, really. They're still making Red vs. Blue

05:49.140 --> 05:50.380
over at Rooster Teeth.

05:50.380 --> 05:51.380
Did you know that?

05:51.380 --> 05:52.980
Can you conceive of the idea

05:52.980 --> 05:54.880
that a show you had fun with in your bedroom

05:54.880 --> 05:57.860
when you were in high school is 17 seasons deep?

05:57.860 --> 05:59.900
I found that out while I was working on this video

05:59.900 --> 06:02.360
and a friend told me that they're on season 17.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.240
It's still hitting me.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.020
Why haven't they stopped?

06:06.020 --> 06:08.660
Well, it's not because the creators of Red vs. Blue

06:08.680 --> 06:10.800
had 17 years of ideas in them.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.060
Rooster Teeth isn't a small company

06:13.060 --> 06:15.740
whose people can do what they want creatively anymore.

06:15.740 --> 06:16.940
They've been bought.

06:16.940 --> 06:18.900
They're part of a large conglomerate now

06:18.900 --> 06:22.660
and their work isn't just a show they like making for fun

06:22.660 --> 06:24.040
because they had a nice idea.

06:24.040 --> 06:27.460
It's an intellectual property with a capital I and P,

06:27.460 --> 06:29.320
and they're gonna keep making it for as long

06:29.320 --> 06:31.040
as it theoretically makes money

06:31.040 --> 06:33.740
no matter how little anyone wants to make it.

06:33.740 --> 06:35.660
As Bernie has always said,

06:35.660 --> 06:38.080
as long as people like it, we will keep making it.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.380
Yep, so shut the fuck up.

06:39.380 --> 06:40.760
And even once you hate it,

06:40.760 --> 06:42.720
even once you're totally fed up with it,

06:42.720 --> 06:44.640
you're like, just stop. We'll still be there.

06:44.640 --> 06:45.640
We're gonna milk the shit out of it.

06:45.640 --> 06:47.100
Every penny is worth it.

06:47.100 --> 06:49.340
Meanwhile, in another corner of the internet,

06:49.340 --> 06:52.440
another form of early web hashtag content

06:52.440 --> 06:53.720
was being produced.

06:53.720 --> 06:56.680
A guy named Monty Oum was putting 3D animations

06:56.680 --> 06:59.060
of some incredibly cool fights on the internet

06:59.060 --> 07:01.560
on places like early YouTube and DeviantArt

07:01.560 --> 07:02.600
and game trailers.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.360
God, remember game trailers?

07:04.360 --> 07:05.700
Oh, I feel so old now.

07:05.740 --> 07:08.700
His most long-running work was the Dead Fantasy series,

07:08.700 --> 07:10.620
short fights featuring the female characters

07:10.620 --> 07:12.280
from Dead or Alive and Final Fantasy.

07:12.280 --> 07:14.400
These animations are still really cool.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.860
They're basically just characters you know

07:15.860 --> 07:18.460
from stuff fighting, but that's all they have to be.

07:18.460 --> 07:21.000
The fights feel desperate, violent, impactful,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.200
cool, fast, and incredibly technical.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.300
There's nothing quite as good as these

07:25.300 --> 07:26.800
at the things these are doing,

07:26.800 --> 07:29.040
but perhaps the most well-known Monty animation

07:29.040 --> 07:30.920
was released in 2007.

07:30.920 --> 07:32.840
It was called Haloid.

07:32.840 --> 07:34.500
Haloid is utterly fantastic.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.400
Halo Man beats up hundreds of Halo aliens,

07:37.400 --> 07:40.060
but then Metroid Man turns up and they fight,

07:40.060 --> 07:42.820
but then it turns out Metroid Man is a girl

07:42.820 --> 07:44.280
and then they fight each other again

07:44.280 --> 07:47.200
and also more aliens in a big sequence so epic

07:47.200 --> 07:50.160
only music taken directly from the Matrix Reloaded's

07:50.160 --> 07:52.820
Burly Brawl scene could possibly do it justice,

07:52.820 --> 07:54.460
and they even pay homage to some scenes

07:54.460 --> 07:55.620
from that fight while they're at it.

07:55.620 --> 07:57.380
They blow all the aliens up and escape,

07:57.380 --> 07:58.700
reenacting another cool scene

07:58.700 --> 08:00.540
from the Matrix Reloaded in the process,

08:00.540 --> 08:04.840
but then it turns out that Halo Man was also a girl.

08:04.840 --> 08:05.840
Oh, my God!

08:05.840 --> 08:08.220
And then they watch the sun set.

08:08.220 --> 08:10.140
Ah, that's nice.

08:10.140 --> 08:11.800
Maybe I'm being overly sentimental

08:11.800 --> 08:13.260
about some animated fights,

08:13.260 --> 08:16.520
but the late, great Monty Oum was basically a genius

08:16.520 --> 08:17.520
at what he did.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.280
The guy passed away really tragically

08:19.280 --> 08:20.940
and suddenly in 2015,

08:20.940 --> 08:22.820
but the body of work he left behind

08:22.820 --> 08:25.560
is genuinely fantastic and inspirational.

08:25.560 --> 08:28.480
It's fascinating to me that stuff Monty made for fun,

08:28.480 --> 08:30.240
for free in a couple of weeks

08:30.240 --> 08:33.280
is infinitely more dynamic and fun and engaging

08:33.280 --> 08:36.020
than stuff real, big-budget animation productions

08:36.020 --> 08:37.020
have put together.

08:37.020 --> 08:38.900
I can barely think of a handful of things

08:38.900 --> 08:40.400
that even remotely compare.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.360
For a time, Rooster Teeth and Monty Oum

08:42.360 --> 08:44.780
were just their own things off in their own corners

08:44.780 --> 08:48.500
of the Internet, but then, 2010, PAX.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.120
Rooster Teeth premiere a new episode of Red vs. Blue.

08:51.120 --> 08:52.960
It's standard fare for the show, really.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.580
Familiar characters, familiar engine limitations,

08:55.580 --> 08:57.960
cute meta jokes about how nerfed the pistol was

08:57.960 --> 08:58.960
in the new Halo game.

08:58.980 --> 09:00.520
You know, these things aren't quite as effective

09:00.520 --> 09:01.520
as they used to be.

09:01.520 --> 09:02.980
We're robbing...now.

09:02.980 --> 09:03.980
But then...

09:03.980 --> 09:05.980
Do you want to hear a...

09:05.980 --> 09:09.980
♪♪

09:09.980 --> 09:10.980
More?

09:10.980 --> 09:12.700
♪♪

09:12.700 --> 09:14.700
How much longer does it take, asshole?

09:14.700 --> 09:18.040
-♪♪

09:18.040 --> 09:19.380
I wasn't there when this happened,

09:19.380 --> 09:21.960
but I remember going as wild as this crowd did

09:21.960 --> 09:23.460
when I saw this episode online.

09:24.420 --> 09:25.420
Oh, my God!

09:25.420 --> 09:29.100
-♪♪

09:29.100 --> 09:31.800
The limitations of the Halo games had been broken.

09:31.800 --> 09:32.800
Who could be behind it?

09:32.800 --> 09:34.520
Oh, who am I kidding? You know who's behind it.

09:34.520 --> 09:35.520
You've guessed this bit.

09:35.520 --> 09:38.440
We saw a short film called Haloid

09:38.440 --> 09:40.560
by a gentleman by the name of Monty Oum.

09:40.560 --> 09:43.480
-♪♪

09:43.480 --> 09:46.400
And we were extremely impressed by what we saw.

09:46.400 --> 09:47.560
This is, if you haven't seen it before,

09:47.560 --> 09:49.940
it's a piece where Master Chief fights Metroid.

09:49.940 --> 09:51.080
Wow, Bernie.

09:51.080 --> 09:53.120
Video game knowledge check fail.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.740
It's Sergeant Metroid.

09:54.740 --> 09:56.740
Have some respect for the troops.

09:56.740 --> 09:59.820
Monty had been hired in secret by Rooster Teeth

09:59.820 --> 10:02.580
to work on animation for the new season of Red vs. Blue.

10:02.580 --> 10:04.780
For almost 10 years now, I've been so in love

10:04.780 --> 10:06.080
with how they introduce him.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.880
He's literally in the audience and they say,

10:07.880 --> 10:10.000
hey, Monty's here now, and he just gets up

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
and joins in as the fourth panelist.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.340
It's excellent showmanship

10:13.340 --> 10:15.000
and also just really kind of beautiful.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.720
So now in Red vs. Blue,

10:16.720 --> 10:18.460
there were suddenly tons of interesting

10:18.460 --> 10:20.420
and creative animated sequences

10:20.420 --> 10:22.180
and when some kind of fight was going to happen

10:22.200 --> 10:23.940
instead of being in-engine characters

10:23.940 --> 10:25.740
standing and shooting at each other

10:25.740 --> 10:28.540
and being kind of boring, it'd be a Monty-Ohm fight.

10:28.540 --> 10:30.920
These sequences really added a lot to the series.

10:30.920 --> 10:32.760
All right, now you're just showing off.

10:32.760 --> 10:34.460
Well, that's a big thing. We like doing team-up stuff, right?

10:34.460 --> 10:36.000
And we found Monty on the Internet.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.800
Here's something he's doing that's really cool

10:37.800 --> 10:39.920
that we can't do so we're just gonna come together

10:39.920 --> 10:41.040
and make something cool.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.920
As they grew, they expanded their production

10:42.920 --> 10:46.100
of other shows and podcasts and became a media entity

10:46.100 --> 10:48.520
which would eventually be worthy of the ultimate prize,

10:48.520 --> 10:50.560
being bought and turned into a subsidiary

10:50.560 --> 10:52.020
of a larger media conglomerate.

10:52.020 --> 10:54.600
However, their biggest show and Monty's animations

10:54.600 --> 10:56.600
were still technically just fan works

10:56.600 --> 10:58.640
of someone else's intellectual property.

10:58.640 --> 11:01.020
Monty and the others clearly wanted to paint

11:01.020 --> 11:03.680
on a bigger canvas and have a fresh start.

11:03.680 --> 11:06.020
Monty wanted to create something as expressive

11:06.020 --> 11:08.900
and unique and stylish as the anime and video games

11:08.900 --> 11:10.020
that had inspired him.

11:10.020 --> 11:12.020
Like, Monty and I are working on right now

11:12.020 --> 11:14.140
a whole series that's just not machinima at all.

11:14.140 --> 11:15.400
It's just animation stuff.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.320
Right. And we're throwing around ideas for that.

11:17.320 --> 11:20.280
This show would turn out to be called RWBY

11:20.280 --> 11:22.160
and the first of four trailers for the series

11:22.160 --> 11:23.460
was released with the conclusion

11:23.460 --> 11:25.080
of Red vs. Blue season 10.

11:25.080 --> 11:27.460
But, uh, RWBY, which we finally showed a trailer for

11:27.460 --> 11:29.960
at the conclusion of Red vs. Blue season 10 last night.

11:29.960 --> 11:32.120
Fuck yeah. We're fucking excited.

11:32.120 --> 11:33.500
It's, it's awesome.

11:35.780 --> 11:38.580
Now, obviously, I'm kind of biased against this show.

11:38.580 --> 11:41.280
I'm making a whole video about why I didn't like it.

11:41.280 --> 11:43.040
Keep this in mind when I say that

11:43.040 --> 11:45.780
RWBY's Red trailer fucking owns.

11:45.780 --> 11:49.780
["RWBY's Red Trailer"]

11:49.780 --> 11:52.280
It's an extravaganza of violence,

11:52.280 --> 11:54.580
visual style, speed, timing,

11:54.580 --> 11:58.000
and this is one of the most fantastic things ever.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Everyone who saw this flipped the fuck out.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.540
Holy shit, it's a scythe that turns into a gun.

12:04.540 --> 12:08.460
Oh! The Red trailer has 15 million views on YouTube.

12:08.460 --> 12:10.960
That's more than any episode of RWBY.

12:10.960 --> 12:13.500
That's more than any episode of Red vs. Blue.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.700
The first episode has 14 million views

12:15.700 --> 12:19.580
and just for the record, uh, the second episode has 6.8.

12:19.580 --> 12:21.680
The only things on Rooster Teeth's channel

12:21.680 --> 12:23.880
with more views are the really cool Monty fight

12:23.880 --> 12:26.220
from Red vs. Blue season eight which I already showed

12:26.220 --> 12:28.640
which they uploaded on its own separately from the show

12:28.640 --> 12:30.100
because they knew it was amazing,

12:30.100 --> 12:32.140
a joke Angry Birds movie trailer

12:32.140 --> 12:34.520
that went viral twice, you know, once when it came out

12:34.520 --> 12:36.360
and then again when actual trailers

12:36.360 --> 12:39.060
for the actual real Angry Birds movie started coming out

12:39.060 --> 12:41.860
and, uh, Minecraft Let's Play because of course.

12:41.860 --> 12:43.020
The trailer is very simple.

12:43.020 --> 12:44.740
This Red character visits a grave

12:44.740 --> 12:46.360
then gets accosted by werewolves

12:46.360 --> 12:48.400
before fighting and killing dozens of them

12:48.400 --> 12:49.760
but it's so much more than that.

12:49.760 --> 12:52.900
It's so cool looking, so good feeling to watch

12:52.900 --> 12:54.780
and just so alive with motion

12:54.780 --> 12:56.700
that it sells the show right away.

12:56.700 --> 12:58.360
You immediately want to see more of it

12:58.360 --> 13:00.440
and know what's going on in this world.

13:00.440 --> 13:01.940
Welcome back, by the way.

13:01.940 --> 13:04.160
I'm saying that because half the people watching this video

13:04.160 --> 13:06.160
remembered the Red trailer while I was talking about it

13:06.160 --> 13:07.500
and paused to go watch it again.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.200
Another thing I want to bring up while we're here

13:09.200 --> 13:11.000
is that this is the best piece of music

13:11.000 --> 13:12.800
Jeff Williams has ever composed.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.540
Jeff had been doing music for Rooster Teeth

13:14.540 --> 13:16.460
since early in the Red vs. Blue days

13:16.460 --> 13:17.960
and while he was clearly talented,

13:17.980 --> 13:19.900
there wasn't much room in Red vs. Blue

13:19.900 --> 13:21.820
most of the time for his music to shine

13:21.820 --> 13:24.120
and this trailer really gives him the chance to do that

13:24.120 --> 13:26.960
and he clearly latched onto it like a limpet.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.360
The song in this trailer introduces

13:28.360 --> 13:29.660
a really powerful motif.

13:29.660 --> 13:30.660
It's this bit here.

13:30.660 --> 13:35.840
["Limpet"]

13:35.840 --> 13:37.840
It has a surprising amount of versatility.

13:37.840 --> 13:39.460
It gets used later in this fight

13:39.460 --> 13:41.300
in a much more intense variation.

13:41.300 --> 13:46.760
["Limpet"]

13:46.780 --> 13:49.240
This sound will basically be Ruby's,

13:49.240 --> 13:51.200
both the show and the characters,

13:51.200 --> 13:53.240
central theme for the rest of the series.

13:53.240 --> 13:55.080
They knew they had something great with this

13:55.080 --> 13:56.460
and they just went with it.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.740
The White trailer introduces us to a character

13:58.740 --> 14:01.000
called Weiss who appears to be a singer

14:01.000 --> 14:02.740
and intercuts her singing with a sequence

14:02.740 --> 14:04.760
where she fights a giant knight with a rapier

14:04.760 --> 14:06.080
with a revolver in the handle.

14:06.080 --> 14:08.800
She has more of a magic-oriented fight style

14:08.800 --> 14:09.840
and the fight's pretty good.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.840
I really like how expressive the visuals are

14:11.840 --> 14:13.000
in these first two trailers.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.100
The world is stark colors and the lighting is harsh.

14:16.100 --> 14:18.060
The backgrounds here are blacks and whites.

14:18.060 --> 14:20.340
It's hard to tell if the events of the trailer are literal

14:20.340 --> 14:22.220
or if this is a liminal space

14:22.220 --> 14:23.680
and the knight represents something.

14:23.680 --> 14:26.100
I like the red on the inside of her dress and boots too.

14:26.100 --> 14:29.060
It really pops out and makes the whole visual design work.

14:29.060 --> 14:31.680
They've really committed to making the character one color

14:31.680 --> 14:33.600
but giving them just enough of other stuff

14:33.600 --> 14:35.340
that it stands out even more.

14:35.340 --> 14:38.100
Weiss's singing is done by Casey Lee Williams,

14:38.100 --> 14:41.380
Jeff Williams's daughter, who was 15 at the time.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.720
Casey's clearly pretty talented so it works.

14:43.720 --> 14:45.680
Weiss wins and it fades back to her singing

14:45.680 --> 14:47.760
for the audience but the wound she got in the fight

14:47.760 --> 14:48.840
fades to a scar.

14:48.840 --> 14:51.800
Did she get it in this fight or from something else?

14:51.800 --> 14:52.920
Ooh, mysterious.

14:52.920 --> 14:55.600
The black trailer introduces us to...

14:55.600 --> 14:58.420
writing and voice acting.

14:58.420 --> 15:01.460
Blake, it's time.

15:01.460 --> 15:04.000
I'm sorry, what? I'll turn that up for you.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.040
Blake, it's time.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.340
Oh, God, I shouldn't have turned it up.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.680
They anime ninja run over to catch a train

15:10.680 --> 15:13.180
snaking through this beautifully designed red forest.

15:13.180 --> 15:16.220
Inside the train is a cool fight with evil robots.

15:16.220 --> 15:18.000
Yeah! The fight's pretty good.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.140
Blake's weapon is a sword whose holster

15:20.140 --> 15:21.840
is another bigger sword

15:21.840 --> 15:24.100
and they're connected by a string or something.

15:24.100 --> 15:25.720
Also, it can turn into a gun.

15:25.720 --> 15:27.600
Uh, it looks neat but I couldn't tell you

15:27.600 --> 15:29.420
exactly what it does.

15:29.420 --> 15:30.220
I like it though.

15:30.220 --> 15:31.920
The music in this trailer has lyrics too

15:31.920 --> 15:33.840
sung again by Casey Lee Williams.

15:33.840 --> 15:36.140
The singing is, well, this time she's being pushed

15:36.140 --> 15:38.600
to sing aggressive anime fight music.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.220
♪ A boy with a knife and a chain ♪

15:41.220 --> 15:43.840
♪ A boy with torture and a pain ♪

15:43.840 --> 15:46.340
♪ A boy with ridicule and hate ♪

15:46.340 --> 15:48.300
Oh! The fight is cool though.

15:48.300 --> 15:50.220
I don't think it's as cool as the red trailer

15:50.220 --> 15:52.300
because it's set in or on a train

15:52.300 --> 15:54.720
so the fight sequences are in a rectangular box

15:54.720 --> 15:56.260
or basically just a straight line.

15:56.260 --> 15:57.840
It's hard to have creative movements

15:57.840 --> 15:59.180
and camera work in that setup.

15:59.180 --> 16:00.340
It's a bit of a limitation.

16:00.340 --> 16:02.980
Halfway through, we get the first proper story beat

16:02.980 --> 16:04.420
of our whole show.

16:04.420 --> 16:05.380
Perfect.

16:05.380 --> 16:07.300
Ugh, I'll set the charges.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.960
What about the crew members?

16:08.960 --> 16:10.300
What about them?

16:10.300 --> 16:12.660
Oh, I think he might be a bad guy.

16:12.660 --> 16:14.420
This is the beginning of a writing problem

16:14.420 --> 16:17.200
which starts here and continues to plague the show

16:17.200 --> 16:19.960
until, uh, actually it hasn't stopped yet.

16:19.960 --> 16:21.340
When you have a character straight up say,

16:21.340 --> 16:23.300
I don't care about killing civilians,

16:23.300 --> 16:25.000
to someone's face, what you're doing

16:25.000 --> 16:26.700
is having a character openly admit

16:26.700 --> 16:28.700
they've been written to be the bad guy

16:28.700 --> 16:30.840
and that's incredibly weird because they've written

16:30.840 --> 16:33.840
monsters into the setting that are just generically evil

16:33.840 --> 16:37.080
and want to destroy humanity because that's in their nature

16:37.120 --> 16:40.080
so it's very weird that the actual characters

16:40.080 --> 16:42.320
that you wrote behave like that too.

16:42.320 --> 16:43.580
Anyway, they get attacked by a robot

16:43.580 --> 16:46.620
and the guy cuts it apart in a genuinely really cool shot

16:46.620 --> 16:48.080
but then he gets to the front of the car

16:48.080 --> 16:50.580
and Blake says goodbye and cuts the car free,

16:50.580 --> 16:52.740
leaving him behind, obviously having a problem

16:52.740 --> 16:55.200
with his being okay with killing innocent people

16:55.200 --> 16:56.360
and I guess this is the first time

16:56.360 --> 16:57.580
she's noticed this about him

16:57.580 --> 16:59.580
and as she disappears into the distance

16:59.580 --> 17:01.500
and the colors really beautifully fade away

17:01.500 --> 17:03.120
so she's alone in a void

17:03.120 --> 17:04.700
and we're given a meaningful impression

17:04.700 --> 17:06.120
of her emotional state,

17:06.120 --> 17:09.540
the audience is struck with one lingering thought.

17:09.540 --> 17:10.700
He can make that jump.

17:10.700 --> 17:12.820
In the yellow trailer, we're introduced to Yang,

17:12.820 --> 17:14.620
a character based on Goldilocks

17:14.620 --> 17:18.740
so we have Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Goldilocks

17:18.740 --> 17:21.580
and, uh, this one isn't really clear yet

17:21.580 --> 17:23.400
but trust me, we'll get to it.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.160
It's...we'll get to it.

17:25.160 --> 17:26.740
Yang goes to a bar whose soundtrack

17:26.740 --> 17:28.540
is a remix of the theme from the red trailer.

17:28.540 --> 17:31.900
["Red Riding Hood Theme"]

17:31.900 --> 17:33.660
It's neat. She beats up the manager

17:33.660 --> 17:35.780
over whether he's seen someone in a picture

17:35.780 --> 17:38.100
and she's written like two adult men

17:38.100 --> 17:40.520
who've never written anything professionally before

17:40.520 --> 17:43.860
except for Red vs. Blue trying to write a teenage girl.

17:43.860 --> 17:45.860
Weirdly specific impression there.

17:45.860 --> 17:48.020
Oh, Junior, I was just playing with you.

17:48.020 --> 17:49.480
Don't be so sensitive.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.640
Come on. Let's kiss and make up, okay?

17:51.640 --> 17:53.240
But after two minutes, she punches the guy

17:53.240 --> 17:55.320
and a fight starts and the trailer gets really good.

17:55.320 --> 17:58.560
Her weapons are gloves that unfold into fist guns.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.480
Yang's design and basic fighting style

18:00.480 --> 18:03.440
seem very evocative of Tifa from Final Fantasy VII,

18:03.440 --> 18:05.600
a character Monty previously liked to use a lot

18:05.600 --> 18:07.300
in Dead Fantasy. It kind of makes sense

18:07.300 --> 18:09.380
that some of the characters are designed around characters

18:09.380 --> 18:10.800
he previously liked animating,

18:10.800 --> 18:12.380
but now they're his own characters

18:12.380 --> 18:13.880
that he has total control over.

18:13.880 --> 18:16.460
Yang has three back-to-back cool fights

18:16.460 --> 18:18.960
against a gang of guys who all dress like Jim Sterling,

18:18.960 --> 18:21.300
two ladies who I guess are bodyguards or something,

18:21.300 --> 18:23.000
and then against the guy she punched earlier.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.640
She punches him with so much power

18:24.640 --> 18:26.880
that the screen gets a Photoshop filter over it

18:26.880 --> 18:28.380
and when she lands outside the bar,

18:28.380 --> 18:29.380
Ruby is there.

18:29.380 --> 18:31.760
Yang? Is that you?

18:31.760 --> 18:33.300
Oh, no. Is that how she talked?

18:33.300 --> 18:34.920
The writing and voice acting could do

18:34.920 --> 18:37.960
with some refining and some of Jeff's musical decisions

18:37.960 --> 18:39.920
could be dialed back just a little bit,

18:39.920 --> 18:42.700
but basically these trailers are some of the coolest

18:42.700 --> 18:45.240
possible trailers for a cartoon ever.

18:45.240 --> 18:48.380
Like, if you showed me every trailer for every cartoon

18:48.380 --> 18:51.160
and asked me which one I'd want to see at the end of that,

18:51.160 --> 18:53.280
of course I'd pick Lunatics Unleashed.

18:53.280 --> 18:56.000
I mean, seriously, this is fucking insane.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.820
Why would anyone make this? I have to know!

18:58.820 --> 19:01.160
But at a very close second, I'd pick this one.

19:01.160 --> 19:04.040
Literally millions of people have gone back

19:04.040 --> 19:05.580
to watch the red trailer again,

19:05.580 --> 19:07.240
and looking at view figures, they've done that

19:07.240 --> 19:09.740
instead of watching more of the actual show.

19:09.740 --> 19:12.040
They're not just amazing teasers for a show.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.240
They're just good.

19:13.240 --> 19:15.660
It's so hard not to be on board

19:15.660 --> 19:17.620
for the show these trailers are pointing to.

19:17.620 --> 19:20.360
They imply a show that's going to be utterly,

19:20.360 --> 19:22.320
fantastically tremendous.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.860
But then it came out and it was bad.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.860
["Lunatics Unleashed"]

19:27.860 --> 19:29.440
Oh, you're still here. Right.

19:29.440 --> 19:32.620
So Ruby isn't as simple as a bad show, is it?

19:32.620 --> 19:35.320
It's a bad show which could have been something,

19:35.320 --> 19:37.120
something truly amazing,

19:37.120 --> 19:39.620
and that makes its problems infinitely more interesting

19:39.620 --> 19:41.360
and important to explore,

19:41.360 --> 19:42.980
and it's especially worth doing

19:42.980 --> 19:44.980
because the show's creators do try

19:44.980 --> 19:47.100
to be receptive to criticism.

19:47.100 --> 19:50.640
Well, they try, but this manifests in a strange way

19:50.640 --> 19:52.220
I'd like to discuss real quick.

19:52.220 --> 19:54.140
The writers have talked on podcasts,

19:54.140 --> 19:56.300
commentary tracks, panels, and so on

19:56.300 --> 19:58.940
about the ways people have been shitty about the show

19:58.940 --> 20:00.860
and how important it is to not be an asshole

20:00.860 --> 20:02.280
when you're criticizing something.

20:02.320 --> 20:03.320
People will make a comment.

20:03.320 --> 20:04.680
Maybe it's, like, a criticism or something,

20:04.680 --> 20:07.600
and you go, oh, okay, yeah, that's a fair critique,

20:07.600 --> 20:08.440
but you don't want to listen to them

20:08.440 --> 20:09.520
because of the way they said it,

20:09.520 --> 20:12.120
which is something I think most people agree with.

20:12.120 --> 20:15.520
It's really tough when you get a criticism

20:15.520 --> 20:18.160
that you actually agree with

20:18.160 --> 20:19.820
but you think was expressed

20:19.820 --> 20:22.660
in an incredibly insensitive and rude way

20:22.660 --> 20:23.920
because you never want to know

20:23.920 --> 20:25.340
what the writer has to say about that.

20:25.340 --> 20:27.960
That's not the way you get things.

20:27.960 --> 20:28.800
It's just not.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.380
I really get what he's saying here,

20:30.380 --> 20:32.660
and, yeah, plenty of criticism of the show

20:32.660 --> 20:34.820
is worthless dog shit.

20:34.820 --> 20:37.220
For some reason, this show seems to attract people

20:37.220 --> 20:40.740
who need excuses to yell at cartoon women,

20:40.740 --> 20:42.100
but I'm having a hard time

20:42.100 --> 20:45.220
finding more than one or two decent examples

20:45.220 --> 20:47.460
of times they've really explored

20:47.460 --> 20:49.860
actual criticisms of the show,

20:49.860 --> 20:52.740
and the fact the show keeps making the same mistakes

20:52.740 --> 20:54.820
implies they kinda don't.

20:54.820 --> 20:56.460
I've seen the writers sometimes, quote,

20:56.460 --> 20:58.580
retweet someone being shitty about the show

20:58.580 --> 21:00.180
and responding to this behavior,

21:00.220 --> 21:03.100
and, again, often what they're saying is correct.

21:03.100 --> 21:05.660
If you have a point but you're an asshole about it,

21:05.660 --> 21:07.700
no one will want to listen to you.

21:07.700 --> 21:11.340
I basically agree completely with what Miles is saying here,

21:11.340 --> 21:14.420
but he appears to spend a significant amount less time

21:14.420 --> 21:16.220
responding to the kinds of criticism

21:16.220 --> 21:18.180
he says he wants to see,

21:18.180 --> 21:20.380
and there is good-faith criticism out there,

21:20.380 --> 21:23.700
so stepping over them to point at bad-faith criticisms

21:23.700 --> 21:26.100
and complain about how they're not helpful

21:26.100 --> 21:28.180
means that, functionally, all you're doing

21:28.180 --> 21:31.380
is rewarding shitty people with time and attention

21:31.380 --> 21:34.020
you then don't spend engaging with the people

21:34.020 --> 21:36.580
who make the decent criticisms of your work,

21:36.580 --> 21:40.220
and as a lifelong fan of Rooster Teeth and Monty Oum,

21:40.220 --> 21:43.140
I certainly hope it's clear that my criticism

21:43.140 --> 21:45.180
comes from a well-meaning place.

21:45.180 --> 21:47.380
I'm only here because I really thought

21:47.380 --> 21:48.900
the show could have been great,

21:48.900 --> 21:51.180
and I still think that maybe it could be.

21:51.180 --> 21:52.100
Hey, see?

21:52.100 --> 21:54.100
The chapel wasn't just here to be a reference

21:54.100 --> 21:55.500
to that scene from Kingsman.

21:55.500 --> 21:57.900
It was also a clever metaphor for my intent

21:57.900 --> 22:00.420
to make a good-faith criticism.

22:00.420 --> 22:03.220
Hey, come on. I thought it was clever.

22:03.220 --> 22:05.620
Wait. Is that...

22:05.620 --> 22:08.020
Is an intro playing now?

22:08.020 --> 22:10.820
Hasn't it been, like, 20 minutes?

RWBY is about a girl who goes to anime warrior school

after getting invited

22:53.940 --> 22:56.360
by the ominous and enigmatic headmaster,

22:56.360 --> 22:57.660
Sephiroth Dumbledore,

22:57.660 --> 23:00.160
and RWBY and her sister and new friends

23:00.160 --> 23:02.160
mess about doing plot lines

23:02.160 --> 23:04.280
that don't go anywhere for a few years

23:04.280 --> 23:07.620
while the show decides what its story actually is.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.120
Okay, wait, we're getting ahead of ourselves.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.120
I wanted to start this video by doing the thing

23:11.120 --> 23:13.740
all the smart video essayists are doing nowadays

23:13.740 --> 23:16.040
where they sum up the plot of the thing they're analyzing

23:16.040 --> 23:17.920
in a funny way that lays the groundwork

23:17.920 --> 23:19.880
for future critique, but trying to delve into

23:19.880 --> 23:21.920
and describe the deeper story problems

23:21.920 --> 23:23.420
misses the surface problem

23:23.440 --> 23:25.440
that there basically isn't one.

23:25.440 --> 23:26.820
There's a really telling scene

23:26.820 --> 23:28.120
at the end of the second season

23:28.120 --> 23:29.820
where the main characters sit around

23:29.820 --> 23:31.740
discussing the events of the show so far

23:31.740 --> 23:33.820
and conclude that they don't really know

23:33.820 --> 23:35.500
what's happening or why

23:35.500 --> 23:37.200
and haven't figured anything out yet.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.700
We didn't solve everything.

23:38.700 --> 23:39.880
A lot of people were hurt,

23:39.880 --> 23:42.720
and we still don't even know why they did this

23:42.720 --> 23:44.540
or who that mystery girl was.

23:44.540 --> 23:46.540
The show attempts to justify this, though.

23:46.540 --> 23:48.880
Not every story has an eaten tidy ending.

23:48.880 --> 23:52.520
Stories don't have to make sense or go anywhere.

23:52.540 --> 23:55.540
Now, to a certain extent, this is an okay point to make.

23:55.540 --> 23:57.740
Like, in real life, things don't have arcs

23:57.740 --> 23:59.660
or necessarily lead anywhere,

23:59.660 --> 24:02.420
but if 28 episodes into your story,

24:02.420 --> 24:03.960
you're ending a season on a character

24:03.960 --> 24:05.960
giving what amounts to a justification

24:05.960 --> 24:07.540
for the story not mattering,

24:07.540 --> 24:10.140
maybe the plot could have done with some more work.

24:10.140 --> 24:12.840
The dog mimicking Yang is really cute, though,

24:12.840 --> 24:14.180
so at least there's that.

24:14.180 --> 24:15.640
Uh, time for bed?

24:15.640 --> 24:17.380
Oh, please. Absolutely. Yes.

24:17.380 --> 24:19.520
This is the season two finale.

24:19.520 --> 24:22.100
We don't know what the story is.

24:22.180 --> 24:23.180
Nap time.

24:23.180 --> 24:25.140
Almost all of our main characters

24:25.140 --> 24:28.440
don't find out what the actual story that's going on

24:28.440 --> 24:32.280
actually is until about halfway through season four

24:32.280 --> 24:35.620
where someone tells them while sitting around a campfire.

24:35.620 --> 24:37.400
Ruby's story is one of those stories

24:37.400 --> 24:39.860
that I like to call theoretically interesting

24:39.860 --> 24:41.700
where, like, if you read it on Wikipedia,

24:41.700 --> 24:42.960
it would sound really cool,

24:42.960 --> 24:44.580
and in the show, there are plenty of times

24:44.580 --> 24:45.960
where the characters sit you down

24:45.960 --> 24:47.300
and tell you what the story was,

24:47.300 --> 24:50.000
and you go, oh, that's actually really interesting.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.500
I wish I'd seen some of that,

24:51.500 --> 24:54.080
but in the actual episodes of the show you get to see,

24:54.080 --> 24:55.580
not much happens at all,

24:55.580 --> 24:58.120
so to hone in on why the story ended up like this,

24:58.120 --> 25:00.380
we're gonna have to explore how the show was made.

25:00.380 --> 25:02.540
Monty Oum was the main creator of Ruby,

25:02.540 --> 25:05.500
but it seems like he didn't do much of the writing himself.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.500
In interviews, Monty and the rest of Rooster Teeth

25:07.500 --> 25:09.500
have been up front that Monty's not that interested

25:09.500 --> 25:11.300
in the writing part of making a show.

25:11.300 --> 25:13.220
And we do stuff like writing characters

25:13.220 --> 25:15.260
and storylines and stuff that he doesn't really,

25:15.260 --> 25:16.420
I don't know if he's just not interested in it,

25:16.420 --> 25:18.940
but he doesn't do it. He likes all the animation.

25:18.940 --> 25:21.140
Monty was more of a visual storyteller

25:21.160 --> 25:23.820
and seemed to prefer to have writers do the writing part,

25:23.820 --> 25:26.240
which means the show has some other important creators,

25:26.240 --> 25:28.080
Miles Luna and Kerry Shawcross.

25:28.080 --> 25:30.740
Ruby is being, it's directed by Monty Oum,

25:30.740 --> 25:33.880
uh, and then, uh, Monty, Kerry, and myself

25:33.880 --> 25:35.220
are the lead writers for the show.

25:35.220 --> 25:37.260
Kerry had done some editing and compositing work

25:37.260 --> 25:40.100
on Red vs. Blue and Miles had done machinimating,

25:40.100 --> 25:42.560
like the head bobbing to the recorded dialogue,

25:42.560 --> 25:43.600
on season nine.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.220
He then wrote 13 minutes worth of miniseries

25:46.220 --> 25:48.060
and helped co-write season ten.

25:48.060 --> 25:50.140
Fucking with Ruby was a lot of fun.

25:50.140 --> 25:51.640
It was a lot of fun to make.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.900
It was really scary because it was essentially

25:53.900 --> 25:57.160
the first time that either of us had ever written anything.

25:58.020 --> 26:01.120
Oh, I appear to have accidentally paused that clip.

26:01.120 --> 26:02.320
Written anything.

26:02.320 --> 26:03.820
On this scale. Yeah, on this scale.

26:03.820 --> 26:05.580
On this scale, for sure, yeah.

26:05.580 --> 26:07.820
There's a fourth really important team member

26:07.820 --> 26:10.200
who often goes unmentioned even though he's in the credits

26:10.200 --> 26:12.960
of Ruby from even the first trailer, Shane Neuville.

26:12.960 --> 26:14.340
He was a close friend of Monty's

26:14.340 --> 26:16.380
and the two collaborated quite a lot on stuff.

26:16.380 --> 26:18.040
He'd worked with him on the animated parts

26:18.040 --> 26:19.040
of Red vs. Blue.

26:19.080 --> 26:22.500
Monty or Shane will choreograph fights

26:22.500 --> 26:23.780
or whatever sequences.

26:23.780 --> 26:25.580
And he's made some great stuff on his own.

26:25.580 --> 26:29.120
Monty first came up with some of the basic concepts for Ruby

26:29.120 --> 26:31.120
while eating in an IHOP with Shane.

26:31.120 --> 26:33.040
He doesn't get credited very often for his role

26:33.040 --> 26:34.220
in the making of the series,

26:34.220 --> 26:36.720
but some of the best animated moments were made by him.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.880
So Monty came up with the basic ideas

26:38.880 --> 26:41.060
for Ruby's world and characters and story

26:41.060 --> 26:43.100
and then brought on Kerry and Miles as writers

26:43.100 --> 26:44.560
and Shane as another animator.

26:44.560 --> 26:46.300
The kind of thing we want to deliberate on

26:46.320 --> 26:49.240
and put more thought into is, like, the plot and character.

26:49.240 --> 26:50.620
And that's the stuff that Miles and Kerry's

26:50.620 --> 26:51.620
been helping me with.

26:51.620 --> 26:53.000
So, like, um...

26:53.000 --> 26:55.500
Monty, Kerry, and Miles appear to have worked together

26:55.500 --> 26:58.160
to come up with a basic outline of the plot and setting,

26:58.160 --> 26:59.460
but most importantly for Monty,

26:59.460 --> 27:01.380
the action sequences that were going to happen

27:01.380 --> 27:02.880
and when in the story they happened,

27:02.880 --> 27:05.140
and then Monty, Shane, and maybe a few others

27:05.140 --> 27:07.180
went off to start work on the action scenes,

27:07.180 --> 27:09.260
in doing so crafting some of the most cool

27:09.260 --> 27:11.440
and elaborate action sequences ever made.

27:11.440 --> 27:13.900
Meanwhile, the writers and the rest of the animation team

27:13.900 --> 27:15.600
put together the rest of the scenes.

27:15.620 --> 27:17.500
Eventually the three of us all decided on

27:17.500 --> 27:20.780
a few set rules and characters and, um,

27:20.780 --> 27:22.700
story ideas that we wanted to stick to.

27:22.700 --> 27:26.040
Monty's working on, like, action and, like,

27:26.040 --> 27:28.340
the design and the look of the show

27:28.340 --> 27:32.080
and he kind of had us go off and start writing,

27:32.080 --> 27:33.960
uh, the first episode.

27:33.960 --> 27:35.720
Yeah. This division of work does seem

27:35.720 --> 27:37.140
to make sense on the surface.

27:37.140 --> 27:39.020
However, something Miles is being nice

27:39.020 --> 27:41.140
and not mentioning is that sometimes Monty

27:41.140 --> 27:44.680
would just disappear and then come up with new characters,

27:44.680 --> 27:46.760
story elements, and action sequences

27:46.760 --> 27:49.520
which the writers would then suddenly have to make room for

27:49.520 --> 27:51.480
in their script. More on that later,

27:51.480 --> 27:53.060
but for now, generally speaking,

27:53.060 --> 27:54.820
Monty and Shane did the fights,

27:54.820 --> 27:56.360
Kerry and Miles wrote the words,

27:56.360 --> 27:58.240
and another team of animators put together

27:58.240 --> 27:59.360
the non-action scenes.

27:59.360 --> 28:00.900
The three of us would have a lot of meetings

28:00.900 --> 28:03.620
and collaborate on the show to the point where

28:03.620 --> 28:05.860
I just started coming up with the broad strokes eventually

28:05.860 --> 28:07.160
and they would work. They had pretty much written

28:07.160 --> 28:08.880
the book or the bulk of the show.

28:08.880 --> 28:10.340
So in Monty's own words,

28:10.340 --> 28:12.760
the bulk of the show is written by these writers.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.340
To a certain extent, it's a bit like

28:14.340 --> 28:16.800
if Dead Fantasy was a full animated series

28:16.800 --> 28:18.620
with writers hired to connect the dots

28:18.620 --> 28:20.800
and explain and justify the fights that were happening.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.500
So there's a lot of good places to start

28:22.500 --> 28:24.420
when analyzing the show's writing process,

28:24.420 --> 28:26.020
but the best place is probably

28:26.020 --> 28:27.520
the very beginning of the show.

28:27.520 --> 28:29.480
I know, right? I'm a genius.

28:29.480 --> 28:31.940
The opening of RWBY really doesn't set up

28:31.940 --> 28:34.180
the story too well, but it does set up

28:34.180 --> 28:36.140
the writing problems we'll go on to see

28:36.140 --> 28:38.060
throughout the story in a useful way.

28:38.060 --> 28:40.180
RWBY begins with a very simplistic-looking

28:40.180 --> 28:42.860
introductory animation explaining the basic setting

28:43.540 --> 28:45.920
with the slight problem that it doesn't actually

28:45.920 --> 28:46.960
do that at all.

28:46.960 --> 28:48.800
All it actually says is there's man

28:48.800 --> 28:51.220
and also dangerous monsters that want to eat them up

28:51.220 --> 28:53.520
called Grimm, as in Grimm's fairy tales,

28:53.520 --> 28:56.180
which is kind of cute, and then man discovered dust,

28:56.180 --> 28:58.440
a magical substance, well, magical-ish.

28:58.440 --> 29:00.180
We'll get to that later, which can be used

29:00.180 --> 29:02.680
to defeat them in some vague way.

29:02.680 --> 29:06.780
This power was appropriately named Dust.

29:06.780 --> 29:08.520
Why is that an appropriate name?

29:08.520 --> 29:09.620
Hang on.

29:09.620 --> 29:13.620
Man born from dust was strong, wise, and resourceful.

29:13.620 --> 29:16.260
Okay, so it's called Dust because we, like,

29:16.260 --> 29:20.640
came from dust, man, and that's the intro.

29:20.640 --> 29:22.520
You'd think they'd explain a little bit more

29:22.520 --> 29:24.940
about the world itself or what the setting is like,

29:24.940 --> 29:26.560
and as they zoom out on a world map,

29:26.560 --> 29:29.400
you briefly see four castles, so what's going on there?

29:29.400 --> 29:31.440
Are they countries? But before you can be told

29:31.440 --> 29:33.240
anything more important than dust,

29:33.240 --> 29:34.860
they evaporate and we transition

29:34.860 --> 29:36.520
to the first real scene of the story.

29:36.520 --> 29:38.020
The intro doesn't share information,

29:38.020 --> 29:40.260
which might have been really good to know going in

29:40.260 --> 29:43.100
so people aren't confused when it suddenly comes up later.

29:43.100 --> 29:44.900
For example, there's a third species

29:44.900 --> 29:47.680
separate from humans or Grimm called the Faunus

29:47.680 --> 29:49.600
whose existence and treatment by humans

29:49.600 --> 29:51.700
is supposedly one of the driving elements

29:51.700 --> 29:52.900
of the entire plot.

29:52.900 --> 29:54.280
The first time this plot element

29:54.280 --> 29:56.980
or even what a Faunus is comes up

29:56.980 --> 29:59.740
is about 11 episodes into the show.

29:59.740 --> 30:01.360
It must be hard to be a Faunus.

30:01.360 --> 30:03.700
Your first reaction to a core plot point is,

30:03.700 --> 30:05.580
to be a what? What's that?

30:05.580 --> 30:08.000
The Faunus are mentioned once at the end of episode one

30:08.060 --> 30:10.320
on TV when a piece of concept art

30:10.320 --> 30:12.980
briefly brings up something called the Faunus protests.

30:12.980 --> 30:16.320
This Saturday's Faunus civil rights protest turned dark.

30:16.320 --> 30:18.860
But before they can actually tell you what that is,

30:18.860 --> 30:20.540
it cuts out and then they don't come up again

30:20.540 --> 30:22.000
until near the end of the season,

30:22.000 --> 30:24.500
so it's almost like a surprise when they come back up.

30:24.500 --> 30:26.500
For another example, in RWBY's setting,

30:26.500 --> 30:29.160
every character has a power called Assemblance,

30:29.160 --> 30:31.380
an ability completely unique to them.

30:31.380 --> 30:34.340
What Assemblance is or the fact they exist at all

30:34.340 --> 30:37.300
or how this universe's version of magic even works

30:37.320 --> 30:39.520
isn't mentioned in the slightest in the opening

30:39.520 --> 30:40.900
where that might have been nice,

30:40.900 --> 30:44.020
and the name Semblance isn't even said in the show

30:44.020 --> 30:46.280
until episode four...teen.

30:46.280 --> 30:47.700
Fourteen. Sorry, I stuttered.

30:47.700 --> 30:49.400
The four kingdoms and their relationships

30:49.400 --> 30:51.320
with each other and their fragile peace

30:51.320 --> 30:53.820
barely comes up until that peace is fractured

30:53.820 --> 30:55.820
in season three where you suddenly learn

30:55.820 --> 30:57.740
as it's happening that this peace

30:57.740 --> 31:00.740
was incredibly easy to fracture and was hanging by a thread.

31:00.740 --> 31:02.880
Our kingdoms are at the brink of war.

31:02.880 --> 31:05.540
Wait, what? Are they? What's happening?

31:05.540 --> 31:07.960
These all would have been really useful to know

31:07.960 --> 31:10.460
going into the story or at least should be

31:10.460 --> 31:13.420
properly set up at some point and not just dumped on you

31:13.420 --> 31:15.080
the instant they become relevant,

31:15.080 --> 31:17.300
but instead basic aspects of the setting

31:17.300 --> 31:19.040
start to feel almost like twists

31:19.040 --> 31:21.540
when they suddenly come up multiple hours in

31:21.540 --> 31:23.920
with no groundwork laid for you whatsoever,

31:23.920 --> 31:26.420
and the main opportunity to set some of this stuff up

31:26.420 --> 31:28.980
and get the audience on the same narrative page,

31:28.980 --> 31:30.940
the intro, gets thrown away

31:30.940 --> 31:32.720
to give you a commercial for dust.

31:32.720 --> 31:35.180
Why? Well, the first scene in the show

31:35.200 --> 31:37.120
is the main villain of the first season

31:37.120 --> 31:39.740
robbing a dust store and Ruby fighting them.

31:39.740 --> 31:42.080
Now, in abstract, this opening scene itself

31:42.080 --> 31:43.420
is a fine idea.

31:43.420 --> 31:45.960
It's a very common and punchy way to start a story,

31:45.960 --> 31:48.540
have a crime happen and the main character stopping it.

31:48.540 --> 31:49.960
It's immediately engaging.

31:49.960 --> 31:52.220
It draws the viewer in with action and stakes,

31:52.220 --> 31:53.880
and it's a strong way of establishing

31:53.880 --> 31:55.920
the primary hero and villain of a story.

31:55.920 --> 31:58.940
Now, they could be robbing a bank or a convenience store

31:58.940 --> 32:01.520
or a gas station or a jewelry store

32:01.520 --> 32:03.020
or an analog for these things

32:03.020 --> 32:04.440
that's appropriate to the setting,

32:04.440 --> 32:07.360
but the decision was made to have it be a dust store,

32:07.360 --> 32:08.740
and this is a decent choice too.

32:08.740 --> 32:10.420
It's an important thing within the setting.

32:10.420 --> 32:13.040
However, this does pose a problem for your audience

32:13.040 --> 32:15.540
because now you're opening on the attempted theft

32:15.540 --> 32:17.620
of a fantasy resource which has no point

32:17.620 --> 32:20.040
of easy comparison to anything in real life.

32:20.040 --> 32:22.760
You know how everyone knows what the One Ring is

32:22.760 --> 32:25.640
because it's a ring that has evil magical properties

32:25.640 --> 32:26.760
so you kind of get it?

32:26.760 --> 32:28.380
Not quite as many people engaged

32:28.380 --> 32:31.340
with the Silmarils, did they?

32:31.340 --> 32:33.900
God, even admitting I know what that is embarrasses me.

32:33.900 --> 32:36.020
If you just opened on this robbery without the intro,

32:36.020 --> 32:37.900
people would get the gist of robbery

32:37.900 --> 32:39.020
and girl stopping them,

32:39.020 --> 32:41.520
but not what dust is or what it does

32:41.520 --> 32:42.980
or why it's so important,

32:42.980 --> 32:45.320
but you kind of have to start with the dust store

32:45.320 --> 32:47.320
because it's a unique place for the setting

32:47.320 --> 32:49.320
which could be interesting if it's pulled off well,

32:49.320 --> 32:51.780
and the plan of the main villain for this season

32:51.780 --> 32:54.040
is that he's stealing all the dust from everywhere,

32:54.040 --> 32:56.000
so it's economically good storytelling

32:56.000 --> 32:57.920
to open on one of those attempted thefts,

32:57.920 --> 33:00.220
so in order for everyone to know what dust is

33:00.220 --> 33:01.380
and why it's important,

33:01.380 --> 33:03.680
the intro animation for the entire series

33:03.700 --> 33:05.380
was either written or rewritten

33:05.380 --> 33:07.800
to primarily focus on explaining dust

33:07.800 --> 33:09.880
which is a tremendously poor idea

33:09.880 --> 33:11.880
because now nothing else is explained.

33:11.880 --> 33:12.880
When it comes down to it,

33:12.880 --> 33:14.560
there's stuff much more important

33:14.560 --> 33:15.840
to set up in the story

33:15.840 --> 33:18.060
than some guy robbing a store.

33:18.060 --> 33:19.760
Compounding this is that the plot

33:19.760 --> 33:22.680
of the entire first season is this bad guy,

33:22.680 --> 33:23.980
Clockwork Orange Man,

33:23.980 --> 33:25.900
is trying to steal dust.

33:25.900 --> 33:29.240
Why? Well, you'll find out in season never

33:29.240 --> 33:31.520
because they dropped that plot point.

33:31.520 --> 33:32.520
I'm not even kidding.

33:32.540 --> 33:34.160
They changed their mind about the plot,

33:34.160 --> 33:35.340
so none of this matters.

33:35.340 --> 33:37.920
So yeah, on top of the obviously quite large problem

33:37.920 --> 33:39.540
that the writers didn't know what their story

33:39.540 --> 33:41.460
was going to be until after they'd finished

33:41.460 --> 33:42.680
writing a season of it,

33:42.680 --> 33:45.760
the chance to set up and explain the wider setting

33:45.760 --> 33:48.140
so people know a little more is squandered

33:48.140 --> 33:50.600
in order to explain why the next scene in the show

33:50.600 --> 33:52.180
is supposed to be important

33:52.180 --> 33:54.600
and then it turns out not to be anyway.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.140
This is the opposite of economical storytelling.

33:57.140 --> 33:59.740
This is...expensive storytelling.

33:59.740 --> 34:01.480
This jumbled mess of ideas,

34:01.520 --> 34:03.520
plot decisions, intro priorities,

34:03.520 --> 34:05.620
and later changes makes the intro feel

34:05.620 --> 34:07.780
like a first draft that they couldn't change.

34:07.780 --> 34:09.320
In the commentary track, they talk a lot about

34:09.320 --> 34:11.120
how cool it was that they got the voice actress

34:11.120 --> 34:13.660
for Cortana from Halo to do the opening voiceover

34:13.660 --> 34:16.320
and it seems like she might have had a pretty busy schedule,

34:16.320 --> 34:19.080
so I have the sinking feeling that they wrote the intro

34:19.080 --> 34:21.200
and then recorded it and then realized

34:21.200 --> 34:22.920
that maybe it could have done with some more work

34:22.920 --> 34:23.920
and it was too late.

34:23.920 --> 34:26.080
That's, that's just my speculation there though,

34:26.080 --> 34:28.000
but this stuff needs to be the strongest

34:28.000 --> 34:29.300
because it's the best chance you have

34:29.320 --> 34:31.780
to sell an audience on your setting and story.

34:31.780 --> 34:33.840
The only thing really holding up its end here

34:33.840 --> 34:35.540
is Monty's fight with the robbers,

34:35.540 --> 34:37.460
which is really good, and also the transition

34:37.460 --> 34:39.260
to the fight from the scene in the store

34:39.260 --> 34:41.140
employs a really cool technique I love

34:41.140 --> 34:43.340
called shifting diegesis because you think

34:43.340 --> 34:44.840
that you're just hearing the music

34:44.840 --> 34:46.840
but it's actually playing on Ruby's headphones.

34:46.840 --> 34:49.220
["I'm the one who's gonna get it"]

34:49.220 --> 34:51.220
["I'm the one who's gonna get it"]

34:51.220 --> 34:53.180
That and the fight are really cool

34:53.180 --> 34:55.440
and because of the intro not being super great,

34:55.440 --> 34:57.440
I think it's the only thing that really hooks people in

34:57.440 --> 34:58.600
in the first few minutes.

34:58.620 --> 35:00.000
No one's watching the intro and going,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.280
oh, wow, dust sold.

35:02.280 --> 35:05.240
The show ends up having a lot of interesting ideas,

35:05.240 --> 35:08.260
but those ideas are executed on and explained to you

35:08.260 --> 35:11.640
extremely poorly in a way that really lets the show down.

35:11.640 --> 35:12.960
I'm gonna say this right now.

35:12.960 --> 35:15.420
Ruby's story gets interesting.

35:15.420 --> 35:18.960
Ruby is a really fun show to write a wiki about.

35:18.960 --> 35:21.060
There's some great stuff in there over the years,

35:21.060 --> 35:24.020
but the story telling only gets worse

35:24.020 --> 35:26.760
and the setting is one of the most poorly communicated

35:26.800 --> 35:29.520
the world had ever seen before Bright came out.

35:29.520 --> 35:31.560
Let's talk about world building and more importantly

35:31.560 --> 35:33.560
how you convey that world to the viewer.

35:33.560 --> 35:35.520
A thing lots of good fiction stories

35:35.520 --> 35:37.760
for young adults try to do is craft a story

35:37.760 --> 35:39.100
where you learn how things work

35:39.100 --> 35:40.980
without being explicitly told.

35:40.980 --> 35:42.760
The setting of, say, Avatar

35:42.760 --> 35:44.760
to pick a completely random example

35:44.760 --> 35:47.020
doesn't tell you exactly how everything works

35:47.020 --> 35:49.400
because this world is normal to the people living in it

35:49.400 --> 35:52.400
so no one would need to stop and ask what's going on.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.020
Sometimes you meet people who can throw fire at you

35:55.020 --> 35:56.440
and that's just not that surprising.

35:56.460 --> 35:58.460
There's a nation full of people who can do that

35:58.460 --> 35:59.880
and hey, you probably have a relative

35:59.880 --> 36:01.960
who can throw rocks without touching them.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.000
That's life, man.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.340
So for the sake of the audience,

36:04.340 --> 36:07.460
the story is written so the unique aspects of the world

36:07.460 --> 36:08.960
come up in ways where the audience

36:08.960 --> 36:10.220
learns how things work.

36:10.220 --> 36:11.880
It's waterbending and it's...

36:11.880 --> 36:14.600
Yeah, yeah, an ancient art unique to our culture,

36:14.600 --> 36:15.840
blah, blah, blah.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.520
This example from the first episode

36:17.520 --> 36:19.180
is a little clumsy and obvious

36:19.180 --> 36:20.520
compared to the rest of the show,

36:20.520 --> 36:22.400
but it's really solid exposition

36:22.400 --> 36:24.560
especially for a show that children might be watching.

36:24.560 --> 36:26.600
You now know what waterbending is

36:26.600 --> 36:28.600
and that it's unique to a culture

36:28.600 --> 36:31.240
and that this is all so normal in this world

36:31.240 --> 36:33.520
that even teenagers are casually dismissive

36:33.520 --> 36:35.560
about this information and you learn all of this

36:35.560 --> 36:37.660
without even feeling like you're being told.

36:37.660 --> 36:39.480
You think you're just watching two siblings

36:39.480 --> 36:41.160
arguing about how to catch a fish,

36:41.160 --> 36:43.280
you fucking idiot, but you're secretly having

36:43.280 --> 36:45.540
the main concepts of the world explained to you.

36:45.540 --> 36:47.580
It's clever. Katara's trying to catch a fish

36:47.580 --> 36:49.460
with waterbending, but in real life,

36:49.460 --> 36:51.840
the viewer is the fish out of water.

36:51.840 --> 36:53.760
Ha ha ha. Who let you in here?

36:54.200 --> 36:55.920
I once heard someone smarter than me

36:55.920 --> 36:58.120
calling this naturalistic storytelling.

36:58.120 --> 37:00.640
The story never condescends to its audience

37:00.640 --> 37:02.720
by pausing to tell you how the world works.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.640
Instead, it just tells the story

37:04.640 --> 37:07.440
in a way that makes it easier to understand how it works,

37:07.440 --> 37:08.980
but if you're a talentless hack,

37:08.980 --> 37:11.020
there are other ways of writing exposition.

37:11.020 --> 37:12.480
In, say, Harry Potter,

37:12.480 --> 37:14.200
Harry is a person from our world

37:14.200 --> 37:16.240
learning about a much more magical one

37:16.240 --> 37:17.440
hidden behind his own,

37:17.440 --> 37:19.240
so the viewer is told how some things work

37:19.240 --> 37:20.620
by way of Harry learning

37:20.620 --> 37:22.860
because Harry doesn't know and needs to be told,

37:22.880 --> 37:25.260
so we get scenes where people tell Harry

37:25.260 --> 37:26.260
how the world works.

37:26.260 --> 37:28.100
Now, I personally think it's better

37:28.100 --> 37:30.100
to discover things without having a character

37:30.100 --> 37:31.820
just be told, but a lot of Harry Potter

37:31.820 --> 37:33.320
takes place at a school,

37:33.320 --> 37:35.440
so almost all interesting storytelling

37:35.440 --> 37:36.520
is kept to a minimum.

37:36.520 --> 37:39.120
Harry Potter isn't as good as when you read it as a child.

37:39.120 --> 37:41.280
The hottest take of 2014.

37:41.280 --> 37:43.540
The exposition in RWBY is, well,

37:43.540 --> 37:45.660
there's a character in the story called Jaune.

37:45.660 --> 37:47.700
Jaune Ark. Do you get it?

37:47.700 --> 37:50.080
Who inexplicably doesn't know basic elements

37:50.080 --> 37:51.300
of the setting he lives in,

37:51.320 --> 37:53.060
and at several points early in the story,

37:53.060 --> 37:54.660
another character takes him aside

37:54.660 --> 37:56.240
to tell him how things work.

37:56.240 --> 37:58.360
Do you know what aura is?

37:58.360 --> 37:59.820
For example, in an early scene,

37:59.820 --> 38:02.740
this character, Pyrrha, explains aura to him.

38:02.740 --> 38:04.700
She gives a long speech about how aura

38:04.700 --> 38:07.540
is a manifestation of your spiritual energy,

38:07.540 --> 38:09.080
nay, your soul.

38:09.080 --> 38:11.460
Basically, you have a shield for a while in fights

38:11.460 --> 38:13.920
like in Halo. I guess old habits die hard.

38:13.920 --> 38:16.180
Aura is the manifestation of our soul.

38:16.180 --> 38:18.100
It bears our burdens and shields our heart.

38:18.100 --> 38:19.460
Have you ever felt like you were being watched?

38:19.460 --> 38:20.800
Our aura can be our shield.

38:20.800 --> 38:22.220
Everyone has it, even anima.

38:22.220 --> 38:23.800
The monsters we fight lack a soul.

38:23.800 --> 38:26.140
Creatures' manifestation, they are the darkness.

38:26.140 --> 38:27.440
It's not about understanding.

38:27.440 --> 38:28.900
So start by wearing light.

38:28.900 --> 38:30.320
Just manifest our aura.

38:30.320 --> 38:31.640
Get it with everyone.

38:31.640 --> 38:33.360
It's like a force field!

38:33.360 --> 38:35.060
Okay, Miles, Kerry,

38:35.060 --> 38:36.560
you just made your whole audience

38:36.560 --> 38:38.480
sit through that exposition.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.780
You can't then make a joke about how simple

38:40.780 --> 38:42.080
the explanation could have been.

38:42.080 --> 38:43.900
Also, when you're doing exposition,

38:43.900 --> 38:45.500
you still have to think about the character

38:45.500 --> 38:46.820
who's saying it and why.

38:46.820 --> 38:48.540
You know, Pyrrha's a teenager.

38:48.540 --> 38:50.540
Young adults don't tend to walk around

38:50.580 --> 38:52.780
with entire speeches about how their world works

38:52.780 --> 38:54.460
prepared in case someone asks.

38:54.460 --> 38:56.740
That's just really strange characterization.

38:56.740 --> 38:58.660
It's also really strange writing-wise

38:58.660 --> 39:00.300
for Jaune to not know this.

39:00.300 --> 39:02.500
Jaune is the latest in a long line

39:02.500 --> 39:05.600
of heroic monster hunters and is in anime warrior school

39:05.600 --> 39:07.600
because he wants to live up to this legacy.

39:07.600 --> 39:10.140
My father, my grandfather, and his father before him

39:10.140 --> 39:11.140
were all warriors.

39:11.140 --> 39:13.140
They were all heroes.

39:13.140 --> 39:14.260
I wanted to be one too.

39:14.260 --> 39:16.940
There's no way he didn't, at some point,

39:16.940 --> 39:19.780
pick up this concept growing up or in training

39:19.800 --> 39:21.900
or, you know, it is a core aspect

39:21.900 --> 39:24.220
of, like, life in this world.

39:24.220 --> 39:27.560
Jaune's character not knowing is such poor characterization

39:27.560 --> 39:29.740
that it literally doesn't make sense.

39:29.740 --> 39:32.660
You know, in Harry Potter, Harry was a literal child

39:32.660 --> 39:35.540
who was deliberately sheltered from magic all his life,

39:35.540 --> 39:38.360
so his not knowing stuff was explained by the story.

39:38.360 --> 39:41.540
That's kind of the only way this expository style works.

39:41.540 --> 39:43.040
You have to incorporate them not knowing

39:43.040 --> 39:44.920
into the character or it doesn't make sense.

39:44.920 --> 39:47.340
If you want to explain one of the world's mechanics,

39:47.360 --> 39:49.780
it's not great to do it by having a character

39:49.780 --> 39:52.980
whose whole life revolves around knowing this information,

39:52.980 --> 39:56.460
not know it, and for the first person he ever asks about it

39:56.460 --> 39:58.820
to happen to have a speech prepared.

39:58.820 --> 40:02.580
Jaune's idiocy is often used to try to make hilarious jokes

40:02.580 --> 40:04.840
about man not know thing.

40:04.840 --> 40:07.580
There's no way I put my gear in locker 636 yesterday.

40:07.580 --> 40:09.460
I would have remembered having to count that high.

40:09.460 --> 40:10.720
Ha ha ha ha ha.

40:10.720 --> 40:13.000
But more than for a joke, it's also a vehicle

40:13.000 --> 40:14.760
for someone to have an excuse to give

40:14.760 --> 40:17.520
really straightforward sounding exposition for the audience.

40:17.520 --> 40:19.640
In the scene where Jaune first meets Pyrrha,

40:19.640 --> 40:22.360
Weiss tells him who Pyrrha is.

40:22.360 --> 40:24.320
This is Pyrrha. Hello again.

40:24.320 --> 40:26.740
Pyrrha graduated top of her class at Sanctum.

40:26.740 --> 40:27.740
Never heard of it.

40:27.740 --> 40:29.040
Do you know who Pyrrha is?

40:29.040 --> 40:32.460
Let me tell you and also the viewer who she is

40:32.460 --> 40:34.420
and list some of her accomplishments.

40:34.420 --> 40:36.300
She's won the Mistral Regional Tournaments

40:36.300 --> 40:37.540
four years in a row.

40:37.540 --> 40:39.000
A new record. The what?

40:39.000 --> 40:41.720
It's not just that Jaune's characterization suffers

40:41.720 --> 40:44.720
from him being written to be literally born yesterday.

40:44.720 --> 40:47.400
It's that everyone else's characterization suffers too

40:47.400 --> 40:50.560
when they essentially have to pause being their own characters

40:50.560 --> 40:52.680
in order to explain the story to someone.

40:52.680 --> 40:55.280
Pyrrha, in my opinion, is one of the most interesting characters

40:55.280 --> 40:57.660
in the show, but so much of the time she could have spent,

40:57.660 --> 41:00.780
like, being interesting or doing something interesting

41:00.780 --> 41:03.660
is spent obsessed with teaching Jaune everything

41:03.660 --> 41:05.960
he needs to know and how to fight.

41:05.960 --> 41:08.780
I've seen people call this show progressive and feminist

41:08.780 --> 41:10.920
because it has a lot of female main characters,

41:10.920 --> 41:12.460
but looking at how they're written,

41:12.460 --> 41:14.120
I don't think I can agree there.

41:14.120 --> 41:18.580
This strong female character is basically immediately reduced

41:18.580 --> 41:21.200
to doing all of the emotional and physical labor

41:21.200 --> 41:23.880
for this guy. A huge portion of the early show's

41:23.880 --> 41:27.120
screen time is dedicated not to the main characters of Ruby,

41:27.120 --> 41:29.760
who the show is named for, but to Jaune,

41:29.760 --> 41:33.460
the real main character getting trained and explained to

41:33.460 --> 41:36.720
and flirted with by Pyrrha, the coolest girl in school.

41:36.720 --> 41:39.260
Incidentally, Jaune is voiced by Miles Luna,

41:39.260 --> 41:41.140
the lead writer of the show.

41:41.160 --> 41:42.160
Hey, Pyrrha.

41:42.160 --> 41:43.460
What's up, girl? How you doing?

41:43.460 --> 41:45.160
She's so pretty.

41:45.160 --> 41:47.380
She's so pretty.

41:47.380 --> 41:48.760
She's so pretty.

41:48.760 --> 41:51.000
So even while having a comic relief character

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
who doesn't know things he definitely would

41:53.000 --> 41:54.500
so people can explain it to him,

41:54.500 --> 41:57.020
the show is still struggling for good opportunities

41:57.020 --> 41:59.020
to explain the setting and plot.

41:59.020 --> 42:02.020
Luckily for exposition's sake, but not the viewers,

42:02.020 --> 42:04.600
they have, like Harry Potter, set a majority

42:04.600 --> 42:07.400
of the early show in a school so often the viewer

42:07.400 --> 42:10.480
is in a literal classroom being lectured to

42:10.500 --> 42:13.000
and no, it doesn't become fun when the characters

42:13.000 --> 42:14.460
in the scene are bored of it too.

42:14.460 --> 42:16.460
However, because they're trying to make

42:16.460 --> 42:19.160
the exposition naturalistic, you're also expected

42:19.160 --> 42:22.680
to immediately grasp multiple abstract concepts

42:22.680 --> 42:24.140
that aren't explained at all.

42:24.140 --> 42:26.100
Take, for example, semblances.

42:26.100 --> 42:27.100
What's a semblance?

42:27.100 --> 42:28.480
Okay, well, they're not magic.

42:28.480 --> 42:31.100
Something the show is very careful to explain

42:31.100 --> 42:33.780
is that they're not magic because people don't think

42:33.780 --> 42:35.320
magic is real in this setting.

42:35.320 --> 42:38.400
We have dust semblances, but I mean,

42:38.400 --> 42:40.320
there's no such thing as magic.

42:40.320 --> 42:42.360
To them, semblances are normal and magic

42:42.360 --> 42:45.280
would be really weird, but just for my own entertainment,

42:45.280 --> 42:47.500
three of the things I just showed you were semblances

42:47.500 --> 42:48.780
and one of them was magic.

42:48.780 --> 42:50.240
Good luck figuring out which is which

42:50.240 --> 42:52.620
without being explicitly told by the story.

42:52.620 --> 42:56.340
Every character in RWBY has one really unique special ability.

42:56.340 --> 42:58.800
Blake can leave shadow clones behind

42:58.800 --> 43:01.680
and use dust to augment their elemental abilities.

43:01.680 --> 43:03.460
Uh, Yang can go Super Saiyan

43:03.460 --> 43:05.560
and get more powerful when she's angry,

43:05.560 --> 43:08.560
but then later they re-explain that it's her getting stronger

43:08.600 --> 43:11.600
as she gets hurt more, like she channels the damage.

43:11.600 --> 43:13.340
With each hit, she gets stronger

43:13.340 --> 43:15.600
and she uses that energy to fight back.

43:15.600 --> 43:17.220
Then later they change it again

43:17.220 --> 43:18.640
to how it is her getting angry.

43:18.640 --> 43:20.980
Her father calls it basically a temper tantrum.

43:20.980 --> 43:22.680
Basically a temper tantrum.

43:22.680 --> 43:25.240
Oh, and then they change it back again in volume six.

43:25.240 --> 43:27.060
His semblance is like yours.

43:27.060 --> 43:28.740
He absorbs energy through his sword,

43:28.740 --> 43:31.360
stores it up, and then sends it back when he's ready.

43:31.360 --> 43:33.620
So if you're confused about how the main character's

43:33.620 --> 43:35.460
semblances actually work, it's okay.

43:35.460 --> 43:36.500
So were the writers.

43:36.500 --> 43:38.000
This isn't just me nitpicking.

43:38.020 --> 43:39.640
This lack of internal logic

43:39.640 --> 43:41.480
when it comes to something even as simple

43:41.480 --> 43:44.200
as one of our four main character's abilities

43:44.200 --> 43:46.480
makes the show very confusing to watch.

43:46.480 --> 43:47.820
When you're watching Yang fighting,

43:47.820 --> 43:50.040
you don't know whether to feel if she's actually in trouble

43:50.040 --> 43:52.160
or if she's waiting to unleash her power,

43:52.160 --> 43:55.000
and that means it's kind of hard to ever really know

43:55.000 --> 43:57.660
what level of danger one of your main characters is in,

43:57.660 --> 43:59.080
and that really sucks.

43:59.080 --> 44:01.300
Oh, also another expository problem

44:01.300 --> 44:02.420
is in this scene too.

44:02.420 --> 44:04.420
A guy who can move this quickly

44:04.420 --> 44:05.960
is currently fighting Yang.

44:05.960 --> 44:07.920
He's just off screen while this is happening.

44:07.920 --> 44:11.560
Did he stop so Blake can tell Yang his semblance?

44:11.560 --> 44:14.260
Is he just waiting for the exposition to finish?

44:14.260 --> 44:16.560
Listen, guys, I'm not trying to be mean,

44:16.560 --> 44:19.680
but, like, show one other person your script

44:19.680 --> 44:20.680
before you're done.

44:20.680 --> 44:22.520
Like, just show it to one person.

44:22.520 --> 44:24.520
Ruby's power is she can move really quickly

44:24.520 --> 44:26.660
and turns into a weird orb made of cloth

44:26.660 --> 44:28.320
and rose petals as she does it.

44:28.320 --> 44:31.040
Weiss can make symbols appear that either lock things

44:31.040 --> 44:33.080
in place or stick people to things,

44:33.080 --> 44:34.740
but also she can summon monsters?

44:34.740 --> 44:36.420
But this isn't magic. It's not magic.

44:36.420 --> 44:38.500
Glinda Goodwitch, yeah, really clever,

44:38.500 --> 44:41.040
can, well, she can basically do magic,

44:41.040 --> 44:43.800
like control things and shoot energy

44:43.800 --> 44:45.660
and put broken things back together

44:45.660 --> 44:48.000
and instantly kill monsters, but it's not magic,

44:48.000 --> 44:51.180
and Pyrrha is basically Magnet Man from the X-Men,

44:51.180 --> 44:52.800
so this is a totally cool thing

44:52.800 --> 44:54.180
to put in your fantasy setting.

44:54.180 --> 44:55.640
It's very shounen anime.

44:55.640 --> 44:57.520
It really fits. It's a fine idea.

44:57.520 --> 45:00.720
So how is this explained to you by the story?

45:00.720 --> 45:02.680
Well, uh, they don't.

45:02.680 --> 45:05.260
The intro doesn't mention it along with most things,

45:05.260 --> 45:07.220
and for the vast majority of the first season,

45:07.220 --> 45:08.520
it's not mentioned at all.

45:08.520 --> 45:11.020
You see some crazy magical-looking stuff

45:11.020 --> 45:13.600
happening, and you assume based on people's reactions

45:13.600 --> 45:15.940
that some people can do magic in this world,

45:15.940 --> 45:20.360
and that's fine, but then 14 episodes into the show,

45:20.360 --> 45:23.260
Pyrrha saves Jaune's life by manipulating his shield

45:23.260 --> 45:25.360
from afar with her Magnet Man powers,

45:25.360 --> 45:27.900
which we didn't know she had until this moment either,

45:27.900 --> 45:30.480
by the way, and all the other characters react to this

45:30.480 --> 45:32.400
as if it's a crazy unique thing.

45:32.400 --> 45:34.320
Uh, what?

45:34.340 --> 45:37.560
Despite tons of magical shit happening before that

45:37.560 --> 45:39.260
and one of the people in this scene

45:39.260 --> 45:43.060
surprised by Pyrrha's power can seemingly also do magic,

45:43.060 --> 45:45.100
and they have this conversation about it.

45:45.100 --> 45:46.480
How did you?

45:46.480 --> 45:49.320
Well, Ruby has her speed.

45:49.320 --> 45:51.440
You have your glyphs.

45:51.440 --> 45:54.060
My semblance is polarity.

45:54.060 --> 45:55.860
This is the first time in the show

45:55.860 --> 45:58.360
anyone has mentioned semblances.

45:58.360 --> 46:00.860
This just happens.

46:00.860 --> 46:05.060
Nobody watching the show knows what that word means yet.

46:05.060 --> 46:08.320
So then, bam, right as you're maybe getting to grips

46:08.320 --> 46:09.900
with everything else you've been told,

46:09.900 --> 46:13.200
brushed up on your in-show Ruby 101 classes,

46:13.200 --> 46:15.700
it turns out fundamental things you thought you knew

46:15.700 --> 46:17.560
about the setting, like that there's magic

46:17.560 --> 46:19.440
and that's fine, were lies,

46:19.440 --> 46:22.060
and actually every single character in the world

46:22.060 --> 46:25.940
has one unique thing they can do with its own special name

46:25.940 --> 46:28.820
that is explicitly not the same thing as magic,

46:28.820 --> 46:30.320
but just to fuck with you,

46:30.320 --> 46:33.700
magic does also exist in addition to all this.

46:33.700 --> 46:35.020
The idea's completely fine,

46:35.020 --> 46:37.400
but this is not how you convey it to an audience.

46:37.400 --> 46:38.660
This scene is supposed to be about

46:38.660 --> 46:41.020
Jaune's personal growth as a character,

46:41.020 --> 46:43.240
but instead, first-time viewers are gonna be going,

46:43.240 --> 46:44.740
hang on, what's a semblance?

46:44.740 --> 46:46.200
I thought people could just do magic.

46:46.200 --> 46:50.020
Imagine if the first time anyone said bending

46:50.020 --> 46:54.120
in Avatar the Last Airbender was 14 episodes in,

46:54.120 --> 46:56.480
but in addition, Pyrrha also specifically

46:56.480 --> 46:58.400
is keeping her semblance a secret.

46:58.400 --> 46:59.860
We gotta tell them what happened!

46:59.860 --> 47:01.940
We could...

47:01.940 --> 47:05.600
or perhaps we could just keep it our little secret.

47:05.600 --> 47:07.440
She doesn't broadcast her power,

47:07.440 --> 47:09.560
so it puts her opponents at a disadvantage.

47:09.560 --> 47:11.600
But then later when some other characters

47:11.600 --> 47:13.020
figure out what her power is,

47:13.020 --> 47:14.780
they call it by the same name.

47:14.780 --> 47:16.400
Her semblance is polarity.

47:16.400 --> 47:18.400
So it's a secret, but everyone knows

47:18.400 --> 47:20.600
the specific name of Pyrrha's ability

47:20.600 --> 47:23.100
without needing to be told it once they see her do it.

47:23.100 --> 47:25.520
What I'm trying to say is semblance is a kind

47:25.520 --> 47:28.760
of a semi-complicated concept to just drop on people.

47:28.760 --> 47:29.760
They don't have to be.

47:29.760 --> 47:31.480
There are tons of shows and anime

47:31.480 --> 47:34.100
where every character has a unique ability of some sort.

47:34.100 --> 47:36.520
There's this great narrative technique

47:36.520 --> 47:39.180
that a lot of anime utilizes nowadays

47:39.180 --> 47:42.940
where they explain what is happening in them.

47:42.940 --> 47:44.400
In JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,

47:44.400 --> 47:47.720
almost every main character has a power called a stand,

47:47.720 --> 47:50.020
but the way they introduce it is they have a character

47:50.020 --> 47:52.260
getting confused by these weird powers he has

47:52.260 --> 47:54.100
and then two other characters turn up

47:54.100 --> 47:57.300
to explain what a stand is to him so he gets it,

47:57.300 --> 48:01.180
thus helping to ensure that you also know how stands work

48:01.180 --> 48:04.980
so that the audience knows what's happening in the story.

48:04.980 --> 48:07.260
So, yeah, it's not like every character

48:07.260 --> 48:09.600
having a power is a bad story idea,

48:09.600 --> 48:12.300
but semblances are specifically made stranger

48:12.300 --> 48:14.220
by either the lack of exposition

48:14.220 --> 48:17.300
or the presence of incredibly confusing exposition.

48:17.300 --> 48:20.100
Like in volume five, they explain what semblances are

48:20.100 --> 48:22.680
to another character, presumably because they realized

48:22.680 --> 48:24.800
the audience had never been actually told

48:24.800 --> 48:28.920
what semblances were in the show for five seasons.

48:28.920 --> 48:30.600
Can you see the problem here?

48:30.600 --> 48:32.460
When these ideas and story components

48:32.460 --> 48:34.420
are being explained so strangely

48:34.420 --> 48:36.340
and it's taking seasons to correct,

48:36.340 --> 48:38.540
eventually the viewer either stops watching

48:38.540 --> 48:41.540
or stops caring about really understanding what's going on.

48:41.540 --> 48:44.920
They start to treat it like it's not really worth their time

48:44.920 --> 48:47.840
and tune it out while they wait for the next cool fight.

48:47.840 --> 48:51.180
Good exposition and proper conveyance of information

48:51.180 --> 48:54.500
are so important in stories, especially fantasy stories.

48:54.500 --> 48:57.420
If you do it in a boring way or do it badly

48:57.420 --> 49:00.680
or don't do it at all or explain only one thing

49:00.680 --> 49:02.420
in the introduction of your whole series

49:02.420 --> 49:04.640
and then it turns out not to be as big a plot point

49:04.640 --> 49:07.040
as you'd thought, the audience's experience

49:07.040 --> 49:09.840
of your potentially good story is damaged

49:09.840 --> 49:12.180
and it's really hard to get that goodwill back

49:12.180 --> 49:13.180
when you've lost it.

49:13.180 --> 49:14.840
I'm only realizing now,

49:14.840 --> 49:16.460
writing this video,

49:16.460 --> 49:20.040
exactly how cool Ruby's story could have been

49:20.080 --> 49:22.820
if it was written in a way that wasn't such a struggle

49:22.820 --> 49:23.940
to get to grips with.

49:23.940 --> 49:25.780
The show is having such a problem

49:25.780 --> 49:27.820
conveying its world that you have to watch

49:27.820 --> 49:30.740
another different show to learn basic shit.

49:30.740 --> 49:33.500
Despite spending tons of time sitting you down

49:33.500 --> 49:35.040
telling you how the world works,

49:35.040 --> 49:36.700
they still don't manage to tell you enough

49:36.700 --> 49:38.960
about the setting for you to be able to understand it,

49:38.960 --> 49:40.820
so they made a second companion show

49:40.820 --> 49:42.660
consisting entirely of lectures

49:42.660 --> 49:44.620
called, Ruby, World of Remnant.

49:44.620 --> 49:47.120
Everyone's favorite part of watching a cartoon.

49:47.120 --> 49:50.080
The homework, like what all the countries are

49:50.080 --> 49:51.360
and how they work,

49:51.360 --> 49:53.480
how Huntsman Academies work,

49:53.480 --> 49:55.520
and the basic history of the world

49:55.520 --> 49:57.360
along with the major mechanics of the show

49:57.360 --> 49:59.520
like what Grimm actually are,

49:59.520 --> 50:01.240
what Faunus are,

50:01.240 --> 50:02.940
how Aura works,

50:02.940 --> 50:04.520
what Assemblance is.

50:04.520 --> 50:05.980
Oh, and how could we forget

50:05.980 --> 50:08.740
the cross-continental transmit system?

50:08.740 --> 50:10.520
The creators seem to have realized

50:10.520 --> 50:12.320
that this isn't explained very well

50:12.320 --> 50:13.860
in the story that they wrote,

50:13.860 --> 50:17.220
so they essentially made a private personal Wikipedia

50:17.220 --> 50:18.900
to tell you what was happening.

50:18.900 --> 50:20.760
In the commentary track for volume two,

50:20.760 --> 50:23.400
they basically admit that World of Remnant exists

50:23.400 --> 50:25.020
to patch up all of these holes.

50:25.020 --> 50:26.180
We have the World of Remnant videos

50:26.180 --> 50:28.600
to kind of get, uh, some exposition across,

50:28.600 --> 50:30.260
um, as best we could.

50:30.260 --> 50:31.480
As best we could?

50:31.480 --> 50:34.640
Guys, no one was forcing you to write the story badly.

50:34.640 --> 50:37.520
They're even animated in the same style as the intro,

50:37.520 --> 50:40.260
effectively admitting the actual introduction

50:40.260 --> 50:41.560
didn't explain anything.

50:41.560 --> 50:43.400
If you watch through Ruby on Crunchyroll,

50:43.440 --> 50:44.680
which, uh, why?

50:44.680 --> 50:45.840
The World of Remnant episodes

50:45.840 --> 50:47.760
are scattered between the normal ones.

50:47.760 --> 50:49.800
They're genuinely telling you that the best way

50:49.800 --> 50:51.720
to experience Ruby is for the show

50:51.720 --> 50:53.060
to stop every now and then

50:53.060 --> 50:54.720
so that you can be told a few minutes

50:54.720 --> 50:56.440
of straight exposition.

50:56.440 --> 50:59.520
The World of Remnant is a dangerous place.

50:59.520 --> 51:02.180
It especially doesn't help that the explanations

51:02.180 --> 51:04.600
in World of Remnant aren't very good either.

51:04.600 --> 51:06.600
The World of Remnant episode about Grimm

51:06.600 --> 51:09.680
explains that we don't really know much about Grimm.

51:09.680 --> 51:11.980
Scientists perpetually find themselves

51:12.020 --> 51:14.480
with more questions than answers.

51:14.480 --> 51:16.940
Little else is known about the creatures of Grimm.

51:16.940 --> 51:19.020
Great. Thanks.

51:19.020 --> 51:21.060
The World of Remnant episode on Semblances

51:21.060 --> 51:23.180
tells us that every single Semblance

51:23.180 --> 51:24.800
is completely unique.

51:24.800 --> 51:28.940
The Wielder Semblance is completely unique.

51:28.940 --> 51:31.060
But then it turns out that Weiss's Semblance

51:31.060 --> 51:33.440
isn't unique and the Schnee family

51:33.440 --> 51:35.400
have the exact same Semblances

51:35.400 --> 51:37.060
like it's in their blood or something

51:37.060 --> 51:39.680
and her sister Winter can do the same things as her.

51:39.680 --> 51:41.920
Every Schnee has the ability to summon.

51:41.920 --> 51:43.260
We have for generations.

51:43.260 --> 51:45.640
So they're unique except when they're not.

51:45.640 --> 51:48.560
I'm glad there's a video explaining how this works,

51:48.560 --> 51:51.220
but it would also help if the explanation made sense

51:51.220 --> 51:54.260
and if it didn't just raise more questions also.

51:54.260 --> 51:55.840
We Schnees are unique.

51:55.840 --> 51:58.380
Unlike many, our Semblance is hereditary.

51:58.380 --> 52:01.880
Winter is telling this piece of information to her sister.

52:01.880 --> 52:03.760
She's one of the only other people

52:03.760 --> 52:05.800
who already knows this.

52:05.800 --> 52:07.420
This isn't how you write exposition!

52:07.460 --> 52:09.800
I don't want to be down on the concepts themselves here.

52:09.800 --> 52:12.160
The idea of Semblances and the idea of someone

52:12.160 --> 52:14.420
keeping their Semblance a secret to have an advantage

52:14.420 --> 52:16.580
or a Semblance that runs in the bloodline of a family

52:16.580 --> 52:18.840
and gives one of our leads a reputation to live up to

52:18.840 --> 52:20.960
are all decent things to put in a story

52:20.960 --> 52:23.500
and they could all potentially be really interesting,

52:23.500 --> 52:25.000
but for those things to be interesting,

52:25.000 --> 52:27.580
they have to be actually conveyed well

52:27.580 --> 52:30.200
and then used well in the story itself.

52:30.200 --> 52:32.120
A good idea isn't enough.

52:32.120 --> 52:34.840
The World of Remnant episode about the Schnee Dust Company

52:34.840 --> 52:36.700
largely covers the life and times

52:36.740 --> 52:38.740
of a really interesting-sounding character

52:38.740 --> 52:40.320
who we never see in the show

52:40.320 --> 52:43.660
and who never actually comes up by name ever.

52:43.660 --> 52:46.700
They just invented a cool guy and made up a story about him.

52:46.700 --> 52:50.440
You don't get story points because an idea sounded good.

52:50.440 --> 52:53.360
In fact, it just means you lose more points by wasting it.

52:53.360 --> 52:56.120
If you do watch all of RWBY and do enough research

52:56.120 --> 52:58.700
and ask around on the Reddit but only once you've consulted

52:58.700 --> 53:00.360
the wiki and watched World of Remnant,

53:00.360 --> 53:03.480
you might finally know what the story of RWBY

53:03.480 --> 53:05.820
was supposed to be and understand how cool

53:05.820 --> 53:08.640
so many aspects of the plot sound in the abstract,

53:08.640 --> 53:11.020
but you probably won't have had a good time.

53:11.020 --> 53:12.860
You can't just tell me how good the story

53:12.860 --> 53:15.640
or concepts might be in a side cartoon.

53:15.640 --> 53:17.860
You have to tell me a good story.

53:17.860 --> 53:20.060
If you try to get someone new into RWBY,

53:20.060 --> 53:22.780
pay attention to how much you have to explain things

53:22.780 --> 53:23.900
on the show's behalf.

53:23.900 --> 53:26.060
Even if you like the show and think it's good

53:26.060 --> 53:28.180
or at least gets good, thinking critically,

53:28.180 --> 53:30.060
we have to acknowledge that it certainly takes

53:30.060 --> 53:30.940
some getting there.

53:30.940 --> 53:33.320
It's especially disappointing when sometimes

53:33.320 --> 53:35.560
you can see the show setting things up quite well.

53:35.600 --> 53:38.220
When RWBY gets done beating up the Sterling squad,

53:38.220 --> 53:40.220
the bad guy manages to get away in a ship

53:40.220 --> 53:42.760
even though a new lady turns up to help RWBY stop him.

53:42.760 --> 53:45.100
I bring this up because, credit where it's due,

53:45.100 --> 53:47.520
there is some pretty good storytelling going on here.

53:47.520 --> 53:50.100
When this new character turns up and is wrecking shop,

53:50.100 --> 53:51.800
Malcolm McDowellboy says...

53:51.800 --> 53:54.140
["We got a huntress!"

53:54.140 --> 53:55.560
And this is a really good line

53:55.560 --> 53:56.940
because the audience is like,

53:56.940 --> 53:58.840
that sounds neat. What's that?

53:58.840 --> 54:01.300
I bet they're important, and then right after,

54:01.300 --> 54:03.880
RWBY reacts like meeting a huntress is really cool.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.700
["You're a huntress.

54:07.700 --> 54:09.700
Can I have your autograph?"

54:09.700 --> 54:11.740
This is a decently animated scene

54:11.740 --> 54:13.420
but also good exposition,

54:13.420 --> 54:15.420
especially compared to the rest of the show.

54:15.420 --> 54:17.000
We know that hunters are a big deal

54:17.000 --> 54:18.580
without having to be directly told

54:18.580 --> 54:20.160
who they are or what they do,

54:20.160 --> 54:22.040
based purely on seeing a guy react

54:22.040 --> 54:23.840
in a kind of panic to her appearance

54:23.840 --> 54:25.700
and how RWBY reacts herself.

54:25.700 --> 54:28.240
It's fun and cool and doesn't bog you down

54:28.240 --> 54:29.740
with explicit explanations,

54:29.740 --> 54:33.240
so the writing in this sequence specifically really works.

54:33.280 --> 54:35.400
That said, you fully learn what huntsmen

54:35.400 --> 54:37.900
and huntresses are by sitting in a classroom

54:37.900 --> 54:40.240
while they make a point about how this is boring

54:40.240 --> 54:42.240
and the other characters aren't paying attention.

54:42.240 --> 54:44.700
["Individuals who have sworn to protect

54:44.700 --> 54:47.060
those who cannot protect themselves."

54:47.060 --> 54:48.240
Oh, really? Wow, thanks.

54:48.240 --> 54:49.400
This scene was worth my time.

54:49.400 --> 54:51.160
Surely there's a more interesting way

54:51.160 --> 54:52.820
to explain things to your audience

54:52.820 --> 54:54.060
than with a lecture.

54:54.060 --> 54:55.700
Besides, that's what World of Remnants'

54:55.700 --> 54:56.980
huntsman episode is for.

54:56.980 --> 54:58.860
What this scene with Glinda implies to me

54:58.860 --> 55:00.600
is that someone on the writing team

55:00.600 --> 55:02.440
did know how to write exposition

55:02.440 --> 55:04.020
and his name was Monty Oum.

55:04.020 --> 55:06.800
The action scenes, the ones Monty had gone off to make

55:06.800 --> 55:08.380
while the writers wrote the other stuff,

55:08.380 --> 55:10.680
are consistently the most interesting examples

55:10.680 --> 55:13.100
of character writing and storytelling in the show.

55:13.100 --> 55:15.180
In volume two, our characters are so busy

55:15.180 --> 55:17.680
having drama or doing wacky skits

55:17.680 --> 55:20.100
to establish why these characters are actually friends.

55:20.100 --> 55:21.680
Did you steal my binder?

55:21.680 --> 55:22.980
I am not a crook.

55:22.980 --> 55:23.980
What are you talking about?

55:23.980 --> 55:25.340
You said a dog?

55:25.340 --> 55:27.020
And a male?

55:27.020 --> 55:29.180
But a few episodes in, we have this big fight

55:29.180 --> 55:31.340
where the team work together to beat a big mecha,

55:31.340 --> 55:34.200
and in this scene, Monty does all the characterization

55:34.200 --> 55:35.660
that could have happened in the show.

55:35.660 --> 55:36.960
The characters' team work,

55:36.960 --> 55:39.280
using each other's abilities in conjunction together,

55:39.280 --> 55:41.540
is choreographed and prepared in a way

55:41.540 --> 55:43.280
that shows the audience that these characters

55:43.280 --> 55:44.880
have learned to work together.

55:44.880 --> 55:49.200
Each move even gets called for by Ruby using a code word.

55:49.200 --> 55:50.200
Freezer burn!

55:50.200 --> 55:51.580
Checkmate!

55:51.580 --> 55:52.920
Ladybug!

55:52.920 --> 55:54.880
Blastoise!

55:54.880 --> 55:56.120
We have to slow it down!

55:56.120 --> 55:57.920
And how do you propose we do that?

55:57.920 --> 55:59.420
Ice flowers!

55:59.460 --> 56:01.200
Showing that she's grown and learned

56:01.200 --> 56:02.780
to direct the team she's leading.

56:02.780 --> 56:04.960
The audience can finally tell that these characters

56:04.960 --> 56:06.780
have a really intimate knowledge of each other

56:06.780 --> 56:07.620
and their skills.

56:07.620 --> 56:09.700
These names were actually chosen by Monty

56:09.700 --> 56:11.580
as a reference to the ship names

56:11.580 --> 56:13.500
the fandom had come up with for the characters.

56:13.500 --> 56:14.380
What's a ship?

56:14.380 --> 56:15.200
Uh.

56:15.200 --> 56:16.420
Sorry, that wasn't meant to signify

56:16.420 --> 56:17.500
my feelings on the subject.

56:17.500 --> 56:20.280
Well, a ship is a thing fan discussions of media

56:20.280 --> 56:23.580
end up doing when fans want or predict characters

56:23.580 --> 56:25.920
to end up in a relationship together.

56:25.920 --> 56:27.740
Sometimes creators make subtle nods

56:27.740 --> 56:29.160
to these communities in their work,

56:29.200 --> 56:30.360
like in Steven Universe.

56:30.360 --> 56:32.360
That one time they had a literal ship

56:32.360 --> 56:33.520
with two characters on it.

56:33.520 --> 56:36.280
Referencing the ship names is a little bit creepy.

56:36.280 --> 56:38.280
Ruby is, like, 15, you know?

56:38.280 --> 56:40.940
Ruby Rose is a 15-year-old girl.

56:40.940 --> 56:43.440
But at least let's take careful note

56:43.440 --> 56:45.600
of how Ruby and Yang are the only pair

56:45.600 --> 56:47.280
that don't do a team attack here

56:47.280 --> 56:48.660
because that would mean acknowledging

56:48.660 --> 56:50.940
the part of your fandom that came up with a ship name

56:50.940 --> 56:53.940
for two half-siblings, which is fucking disgusting.

56:53.940 --> 56:56.320
In addition to being a really cool Monty fight,

56:56.320 --> 56:58.740
we're seeing our main characters in action as a group

56:58.780 --> 57:00.520
and learning about how they've grown together

57:00.520 --> 57:01.520
between seasons.

57:01.520 --> 57:03.860
Would have been nice to see them grow

57:03.860 --> 57:06.320
in the actual show, but credit where it's due.

57:06.320 --> 57:08.140
It's well-conveyed exposition.

57:08.140 --> 57:09.860
You might not even notice you're learning

57:09.860 --> 57:11.680
about the characters because you're watching them

57:11.680 --> 57:12.940
beat up a giant robot.

57:12.940 --> 57:13.820
It's a good scene.

57:13.820 --> 57:15.520
Like, that's the thing about early Ruby.

57:15.520 --> 57:18.320
It'll just keep inexplicably having good scenes

57:18.320 --> 57:20.020
that are either super fun to watch

57:20.020 --> 57:22.980
or work way better story-wise than anything around them,

57:22.980 --> 57:24.900
and usually it's the action sequences

57:24.900 --> 57:27.560
which somehow manage to outright the writing

57:27.640 --> 57:29.640
of the scenes the writers came up with.

57:29.640 --> 57:30.640
Here's another example.

57:30.640 --> 57:32.060
As we've mentioned, the bad guys

57:32.060 --> 57:34.140
finding out Pyrrha's semblance is a big deal,

57:34.140 --> 57:36.640
but since this discovery is made during a fight,

57:36.640 --> 57:39.920
it's done really well using animation and artistry.

57:39.920 --> 57:41.840
Mercury has a sparring match with Pyrrha

57:41.840 --> 57:44.460
and the action is shot to focus specifically

57:44.460 --> 57:46.340
on the attention Mercury is paying

57:46.340 --> 57:47.760
to how she moves and fights,

57:47.760 --> 57:49.460
like he's trying to figure her out.

57:49.460 --> 57:52.040
Then when she tries to stealthily use her semblance

57:52.040 --> 57:55.000
to avoid one of his attacks, he notices what she's doing.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
It was actually animated by Shane Neuville

57:57.020 --> 57:58.780
whose grasp of using animation

57:58.780 --> 58:00.480
to tell a story is really good.

58:00.480 --> 58:02.480
In the director's commentary track for this scene,

58:02.480 --> 58:05.160
the whole team can't not gush about the work he does.

58:05.160 --> 58:06.360
Was this Shane? This is all Shane.

58:06.360 --> 58:07.940
Yeah. This is all Shane layering

58:07.940 --> 58:09.400
in that tiny little stuff where it's like

58:09.400 --> 58:10.660
he got the tone of the fight.

58:10.660 --> 58:12.400
He knew what this was about. Yeah, man.

58:12.400 --> 58:13.740
The way they were able to read each other

58:13.740 --> 58:15.200
and the movements. Barring the kicks

58:15.200 --> 58:16.660
and flips and everything, it's just there's so much

58:16.660 --> 58:18.040
going on, like, in the performance.

58:18.040 --> 58:19.400
It's like a silent dialogue scene.

58:19.400 --> 58:20.540
Oh, my god. I love this.

58:20.540 --> 58:21.740
We're looking at their faces

58:21.740 --> 58:23.740
and seeing them examine things.

58:23.740 --> 58:26.200
It's a really strongly characterized scene

58:27.200 --> 58:28.860
Also, I got that reference.

58:28.860 --> 58:30.600
Good one, Shane. Compare and contrast

58:30.600 --> 58:33.440
with when the bad guys actually discuss Pyrrha's power

58:33.440 --> 58:35.060
and they're just sitting around going,

58:35.060 --> 58:37.240
oh, she can control magnets.

58:37.240 --> 58:40.160
It's called polarity which I also know somehow.

58:40.160 --> 58:43.200
Like, it's so weird that really well-told scenes

58:43.200 --> 58:44.360
are right next to this.

58:44.360 --> 58:47.120
Scenes made by Monty and Shane feel like pieces

58:47.120 --> 58:50.280
of a much better or at least better told show

58:50.280 --> 58:53.700
trapped next to this stuff and outside of the fights,

58:53.700 --> 58:56.200
the animation is, well...

58:58.700 --> 58:59.700
Cut it out!

58:59.700 --> 59:00.700
I'm gonna get him!

59:00.700 --> 59:01.700
Oh!

59:01.700 --> 59:02.700
Come on!

59:05.200 --> 59:07.700
We have big plans for you, Roman.

59:07.700 --> 59:10.200
The fuck? Is that just fucking concept art?

59:10.200 --> 59:12.700
If you want to really unproductively hate Ruby

59:12.700 --> 59:14.700
all day forever, you know, if for some reason

59:14.700 --> 59:16.940
you've decided it's your job to be angry

59:16.940 --> 59:20.120
and sad all your life, there's tons of animation problems

59:20.120 --> 59:22.700
or ugly sequences or shots to poke fun at

59:22.700 --> 59:24.200
but talking about them in this video

59:24.200 --> 59:27.200
seems like a distraction because the show looking perfect

59:27.200 --> 59:30.200
wouldn't fix its core writing and storytelling problems

59:30.200 --> 59:32.500
and I've enjoyed much worse looking shows

59:32.500 --> 59:34.200
because they told a better story.

59:34.200 --> 59:36.700
The biggest problem with the show isn't the animation

59:36.700 --> 59:37.700
surrounding these fights.

59:37.700 --> 59:39.700
It's the story surrounding these fights.

59:39.700 --> 59:41.700
It's the way these fights are being connected

59:41.700 --> 59:44.040
or rather not connected by the writing.

59:44.040 --> 59:45.700
A useful thing to know is that while working

59:45.700 --> 59:48.200
on Red vs. Blue, the script would have gaps in it

59:48.200 --> 59:50.200
marked Monty action sequence here.

59:50.200 --> 59:53.200
I would then find places in that script,

59:53.200 --> 59:56.200
places within between the lines in that table read

59:56.200 --> 59:58.200
and start inserting my sequences in the parts

59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.200
where Bernie's script would say

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.700
Monty action sequence here.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:04.200
Red vs. Blue had a script but how exactly

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.700
the fights looked was entirely up to Monty

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:08.700
since he was the best at deciding that stuff.

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:10.200
While the rest of the show was being made

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.200
in the traditional machinima style

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.200
in the Halo games themselves, Monty was making

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.700
the best possible fight he could and these pieces

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.200
of the show joined together at the end of this process

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.200
pretty organically.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.200
Early RWBY was made using a fairly similar principle.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.700
The three main creators had agreed on the story

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:27.700
in the broad strokes and then Monty was doing

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:30.200
the fights in the same way but with the writers

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.200
actually writing out the plot they'd agreed upon

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:34.700
while Monty was making the action sequences.

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.700
To give an example, the first fight takes place

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:39.200
in a street environment so they wrote the dust store robbery

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:42.200
and then as quickly as possible moved the events outside

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:45.200
to connect with the street fight and then up to the rooftops

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.700
to connect to another Monty fight.

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:48.200
You can see this in the version of the show

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.200
on the DVD extras where they show episode one

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.200
with the storyboards.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:53.200
Everything the main crew were working on

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:54.700
had been written and had storyboards

01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.700
so the animators knew what visuals to go for

01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:58.700
and then when Monty's cool fights are happening,

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:01.200
the storyboard is just a black card that reads

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:03.700
Monty action and given what his fights were like,

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:06.200
three exclamation marks is appropriate.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.700
The we got a Huntress part I praised earlier

01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:11.700
was also a Monty action sequence on the storyboard

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:14.200
so it's likely Monty came up with the idea

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:16.200
to have Torchwick say words to this effect

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.700
and not the writers whose best idea

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:20.200
for conveying what a Huntress is

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:23.200
is to have a professor tell our Huntresses in training

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.700
in a classroom as if they've never been told before

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.700
even though they're going to a school for Huntresses

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:31.700
and then to write a side cartoon telling you again.

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.200
In another good example when the characters

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.700
are being tested in the woods,

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.700
the characters all get their individual plot lines

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:38.200
and then when it's time for the big Monty fight

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.200
designed to happen at this point in the story,

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:42.200
we get this insert shot of the characters running

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.200
to the specific location where Monty's fight was done.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.200
Now this is one of the standout action sequences

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.200
of Monty's career. It's really good.

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.200
It's one of my favorite animated sequences

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.200
in basically anything. It's just great

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:56.200
but really disappointingly due to some strange writing choices,

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.200
it doesn't actually connect to the story

01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:00.200
that was just happening because the gang's plan

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:02.200
at this point was to run away

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.200
from the big monsters attacking them.

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.200
There's no point in fighting these things.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.700
Run and live.

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.200
That is an idea I can get behind.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:12.200
But as soon as Monty fight mode begins,

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.700
it's like they were leading them here

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:15.200
to have a proper place to fight them.

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:17.200
I'm assuming Monty and the writers had decided

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.200
on this fight in a very broad way

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.700
like during the trial the gang fights some giant monsters

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:23.700
and it's really cool and Monty made this fight

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:26.200
thinking the writers would come up with an explanation

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.200
but the explanation ended up being,

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:29.700
let's run away.

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:31.200
There's no point in fighting these things.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:34.200
Ah, I don't know how to make this clear enough.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:37.700
That is the one thing that you do not write

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:41.200
immediately before cutting to a fight against them

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.200
and the worst part is this is probably

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.700
the most seamless connection between the story

01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:47.700
and action the show manages to do

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:49.700
because you can at least, like, assume

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:51.700
that their means of escape got cut off

01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:53.700
or they got too close and they had to fight

01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:56.200
but when they have several characters agree to run away

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:58.200
and they say they're going to run away,

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:01.200
having them just kind of stop, it's very strange.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.200
Another really strange thing you start to notice

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.200
when you try and keep track of how the fights

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.700
are being connected is that character arcs seem to start

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.700
and then suddenly stop on a whim.

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.700
When the characters get sorted into teams,

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.700
Ruby is made the leader of Team Ruby

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:16.200
and this annoys Weiss who thinks Ruby isn't very smart

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:19.200
or good and who she argued with a lot during the test

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:21.700
but then during the test, Weiss decided to be nicer?

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:24.700
I'll be...nicer.

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:27.200
But she's mad again now because she wanted to be the leader.

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:28.700
This seems like it's going to set up

01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:30.200
interesting character tensions,

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:31.700
maybe a developing friendship

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:33.700
with emotional speed bumps along the way

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:35.700
but it's resolved instantly when Weiss complains

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:37.200
to a professor and they say,

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.200
That's preposterous.

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.200
And Weiss decides to be nice.

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:45.200
I am going to be the best teammate you will ever have.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.200
I'll be...nicer.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.200
Problem solved.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.200
Writing!

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:52.200
Like, all Weiss needed was for a man in a position

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.200
of authority to give her a good telling off.

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:56.200
Your exceptional skill on the battlefield

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:58.200
is matched only by your poor attitude.

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.200
Just so you know, Weiss' main character arc

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.200
is about her relationship with her abusive

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:04.700
and controlling father so the idea this is what she needed

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:06.200
is actually kind of gross.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.200
Me, personally, I still don't see it as a big deal.

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.200
I'm just like, I don't see them as like,

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.200
these are four females that are awesome.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.200
I'm like, no, these are just four cool kids that are fun.

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.200
Can't really think of any moment really

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.200
where we sat down and we're like, okay,

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:20.200
this is happening or we want this to happen

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:21.200
because they are female.

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.200
Yeah, no, it's always just been like,

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.200
it's just like, they're four people.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:25.200
They're awkward teenagers.

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.200
Hey, hashtag RWBY fans.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.200
Have you heard?

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.700
Yang Xiaolong is going to fight Tifa Lockhart.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.200
My money's on the hot one.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.200
All right, so we've got Yang Xiaolong.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:37.200
She is the bubbly one on the bunch.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.200
She's just so happy.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.200
She's the party girl.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:42.200
She's, you know, pretty much everything

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:43.200
everybody wants in a girl.

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:46.200
So they brought back the interesting character conflict

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:49.200
of the test then re-resolved it right away.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:52.200
This is like watching a learner driver stall their car.

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:54.200
Like, come on, you almost got a story going.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:55.200
Just, just keep going at it.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.200
Immediately after having a character

01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:59.200
just give up on what their character arc should have been,

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:01.200
the plot suddenly switches gears

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.200
and focuses on someone else.

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.200
Wait, gears?

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.200
And then it was the stall the car thing.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.200
Was that a deliberate metaphor?

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.200
No, that was an accident. I'm sorry.

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:09.200
Thus begins the Xion arc.

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.200
A big portion of volume one,

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:14.200
four of the show's first 16 episodes,

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.200
is about how Xion actually forged

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:18.200
his anime college transcript to get into this school

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:21.200
which makes him the deepest character we've met so far.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:22.200
Wow, who'd have thought?

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:24.200
And then he gets bullied by a generic mean guy

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:26.200
who threatens to tell people his secret

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:27.200
and get him kicked out,

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.200
but then he stands up to him

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.200
and saves him from a big grim,

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:32.200
and now he respects him so he won't share his secret.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.200
That's the solution to bullying, kids.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.200
Save them from a monster

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:37.200
and maybe they'll leave you alone

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.200
out of respect.

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.200
Xion finally asks Pyrrha for the help

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.200
she was offering him

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.200
instead of pointlessly refusing it,

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.200
and it becomes kind of clear

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.200
Pyrrha's working really hard on this guy

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.200
because she's into him for some reason.

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.200
This multi-episode break

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:52.200
from covering any of the main characters of RWBY?

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:54.200
You know, it's in the name.

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.200
To focus on one of the lead writer's characters

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.200
certainly seems strange,

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.200
but what makes the pace even stranger

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:01.200
is that once those episodes are done,

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.200
there are two episodes left

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.200
and they have to now connect the story

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.200
to this final fight scene in a shipyard starring,

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.200
and I can't stress this enough,

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:12.200
two characters who have not yet appeared in the show.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.200
Oops!

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:16.200
So the next episode starts and, uh,

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.200
here's Sun. He's here now.

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.200
And then while chasing him,

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.200
the gang randomly runs into,

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:24.200
no, literally runs into Penny,

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:26.200
the other character who they forgot to put in earlier

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:28.200
because there was just nothing you could have cut

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.200
to establish these characters sooner.

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.200
This pure gold just has to stay in.

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.200
So now these characters are here just in time

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.200
for the climactic fight.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.200
Sun's stick that turns into nunchucks

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.200
that are also guns is so fun to watch.

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.200
It's just amazing.

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.200
However, because of the frankly bizarre pacing

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.200
caused by the show's production,

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:48.200
I have barely any idea who most

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:50.200
of the characters involved even are,

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.200
which affects my engagement somewhat.

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.200
It's a really cool scene,

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.200
but it feels very disconnected

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:56.200
from the rest of the story.

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:58.200
Now, exactly how this problem got here

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:01.200
isn't something it feels fair to speculate about too hard.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.200
I'm sure you could easily conclude that the three

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.200
agreed on a story and then the writers just messed up,

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.200
making the plot feel like a cohesive hole

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.200
with the action sequences, and writing-wise,

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.200
the show feels very idiosyncratic

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:13.200
and self-conscious, like it's looking for something

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:16.200
to spend its time doing before the next fight

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.200
and therefore misspending the time

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.200
that would have added context and character

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:21.200
to those fights until it's too late

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:23.200
to really do that stuff properly,

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.200
but at the same time, some behind-the-scenes material

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.200
and panels and stuff seem to imply that Monty went away

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.200
and then came back with new characters

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.200
and action sequences for them and dropped it

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.200
on Miles and Kerry with little to no notice.

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.200
However this disconnect got here,

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.200
it's not very good and relates

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:39.200
to some serious production problems.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.200
Like, if your main creative leads aren't on the same page

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:43.200
about what's happening in the story,

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:45.200
the story's probably not gonna wind up very good,

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:47.200
and also the way a huge swath of the show

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.200
isn't about Team RWBY

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.200
and their plot line evaporates

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.200
to make way for the adventures of some guy,

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.200
the writers don't seem to be handling

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.200
the story they did know they were supposed to do

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.200
that well either.

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.200
It certainly doesn't make it look any better

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:02.200
that the guy is voiced by one of them.

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.200
Oh, and then in volume two,

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:05.200
they correct for this problem

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.200
by adding a second author insert?

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:09.200
Uh...

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:11.200
So a guy called Neptune turns up.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.200
He's a really cool, attractive guy who wears goggles,

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:15.200
and they make a point of showing how wise

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.200
is into him, like, right away.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.200
Let's not assume that this is, like, author insert

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.200
wish fulfillment or whatever.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:23.200
Like, let's assume they just came up with this character

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.200
and then Kerry Shawcross decided to voice him.

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:27.200
Like, hey, if you're writing a whole show,

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.200
you should get to voice one of the characters.

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:29.200
That's fine.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.200
But come on.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:32.200
It was really weird that you picked Neptune, man.

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:34.200
This character gets into love triangle stuff

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:37.200
with a bunch of young female characters

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.200
who you write,

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:41.200
so it just feels weird,

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:44.200
and then this character hangs out a bunch with Yang.

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:45.200
You know.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.200
Pretty much everything everybody wants in a girl.

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:49.200
Oh, what a woman.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:50.200
Uh, she's 17, so...

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:53.200
And yeah, in volume two, the plot pauses itself

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.200
for a shockingly long amount of time

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.200
to have an arc where our characters prepare

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.200
for the school prom and figure out who's inviting who

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:01.200
because Weiss wants to go with Neptune

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:03.200
but Jaune wants to go with Weiss

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:04.200
but Pyrrha wants to go with Jaune

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:06.200
and she can't bring herself to ask it,

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.200
so whenever something in the show happens

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.200
that's really strangely explained

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:11.200
and you wish got, like, told to you better,

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:13.200
remember that they had time to do it

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:15.200
and spent it writing scenes

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:17.200
where the two characters voiced by them

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.200
hang out at a prom.

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.200
Hey, guys, you know when you were talking

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:22.200
about needing to get exposition across as best you could?

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.200
Put it here.

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.200
Put naturalistic exposition in the scenes

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.200
where this fucking prom would have gone.

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:29.200
The prom stuff isn't even necessarily bad either.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:31.200
It's nice seeing the sweet dance animations

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.200
Monty did for it.

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:35.200
He was a big fan of animating dancing along with fights

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.200
and it's cool seeing this stuff in RWBY too

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.200
and a lot of the character and relationship stuff

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:42.200
happening in the prom scenes is, like, fine.

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:44.200
The problem with the scene is even if it's perfect,

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:46.200
it's yet another thing that's happening

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.200
instead of a story.

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:49.200
It just becomes aggravating knowing

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.200
you're watching all of this and basically still waiting

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.200
for the plot to start again,

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:54.200
and you know how it starts again?

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:56.200
Well, right at the end of the episode

01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:58.200
before the final two of the season,

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:01.200
the ground suddenly opens up under Ruby's feet

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:04.200
and she falls into the plot.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.200
Watching this show knowing that it had a creative lead

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:09.200
and two writers and the plot consisted

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:12.200
of a bunch of people fucking about going to the prom

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:15.200
and not doing much else for most of the season?

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:18.200
Like, seriously, what were you doing?

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.200
It turns out there's an entire dead

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.200
underground civilization the bad guy

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:24.200
and his goons are doing an evil plan in

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:26.200
but the next fights that Monty was making

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:29.200
were a series of fights on and in a train

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:31.200
riffing on the ideas he'd had during the black trailer

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:34.200
and those scenes are supposed to happen now

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:36.200
so the dead, destroyed civilization

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.200
that Ruby just fell into

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.200
has a working rail network with a train in it.

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:42.200
This is another instance of there's no point

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:44.200
in fighting these things.

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:46.200
Like, instead of the plot leading organically

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.200
into the fights on the train,

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:49.200
the train is just there

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:51.200
when it needs to be in the story.

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:54.200
I feel like there might have been a slightly easier way

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.200
of getting the characters onto a train.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:58.200
That's all I'm saying, but once we get there,

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.200
the actual action sequences on the train

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:01.200
are really well done.

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:03.200
Monty and Shane and the rest of the team

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:05.200
do some really stellar work here.

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.200
Oh!

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.200
The Zwei scene from yesterday was Shane Neuville's idea.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.200
Blame him. Thank you, Shane.

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.200
That scene was amazing.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:19.200
Oh, and thank you, Harley Dwartz

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:21.200
who Shane says helped.

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.200
This is the second best shot in the entire show ever

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:25.200
of all time.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.200
Ha ha! Do you get it? Do you get it?

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:30.200
And I wish the writing and story had the kind of energy

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:32.200
the animators were capable of manifesting.

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:33.200
There is this one really cool fight

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:36.200
between Yang and Neo, a character fans love

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:38.200
because her deal is she doesn't talk

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:40.200
and therefore cannot be ruined by the writers.

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:41.200
She actually beats Yang,

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:43.200
and then a strange warrior woman

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.200
we don't know at all turns up to protect her,

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:48.200
and Neo is so fuck-off scared of whoever this lady is

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:50.200
that she's like, nope, peace out,

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:51.200
and then the lady leaves.

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:53.200
It's really cool and mysterious,

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:55.200
but there is one teeny issue with this scene,

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:59.200
and that's the really good music that plays during it.

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:07.200
♪

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.200
This is genuinely a pretty awesome track.

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:11.200
It really builds tension and mystery

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:13.200
for what's going on with this character

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:14.200
and what her deal is.

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.200
This track is also the best piece of music

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:18.200
that Jeff Williams didn't make.

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.200
Well, that's not fair to say. That's kind of mean,

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:22.200
but when I first heard this song,

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:23.200
I couldn't get it out of my head,

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:25.200
and I realized that I couldn't

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.200
because I'd heard it a bunch somewhere else before,

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.200
and then I remembered that I spent most of 2014

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.200
listening to the soundtrack to the Godzilla movie

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:33.200
that came out that year.

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:45.200
♪

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:47.200
They found the bones of the Godzilla soundtrack,

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:51.200
and they rebuilt him into Midi-Godzilla.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.200
Now, I'm not saying this is plagiarism or anything.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:55.200
These songs are just incredibly similar

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:57.200
because they're both very generic,

01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:59.200
but I do kind of secretly hope that they got the idea

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.200
from the Godzilla movie because I love finding

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:04.200
other secret Godzilla fans out there.

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.200
Oh, Shin Godzilla was so good, wasn't it?

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:07.200
The train crashes into the city,

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:09.200
so a bunch of grim attack people.

to beat up some monsters for a while.

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:16.200
Oh, look, a reference to Haloid,

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.200
which was itself a reference to the Matrix.

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:19.200
I love it.

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.200
It's a pretty good end to a volume, you know,

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:24.200
defending a city from a bunch of monsters.

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:25.200
Ah.

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:27.200
And then Team Coffee shows up.

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.200
Team Coffee, four characters

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:32.200
who've barely been on screen until this exact moment

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:35.200

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:38.200
appear and heroically single-handedly kill

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.200
almost all the grim in a matter of seconds.

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:43.200

It's like if the Sonic Adventure soundtracks

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:58.200
vomited into my mouth and I want it.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.200

Who the hell is this guy?

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.200
What are his weapons?

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.200
Why does he look like that?

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:20.200
What is the point of having a story

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:22.200
if this is how it ends every season?

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.200
If I wanted context-free fighting,

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.200
I'd watch Dead Fantasy again.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:29.200
The whole point of RWBY is that there were writers

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:31.200
helping make it something more than that,

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:34.200
connect the fights in an organic and meaningful way.

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:36.200
RWBY could have just been a collection

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:39.200
of fun fights uploaded on a YouTube channel,

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:42.200
and all it would have lost is several hours of baggage.

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:44.200
You just destroyed my favorite clothing store.

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:47.200
Oh, you can barely tell a man wrote this.

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.200
There's one particular strange moment in this scene

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:51.200
that really encapsulates the problems the writer...

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:53.200
the problems the writing is having.

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:55.200
Why do I write such long sentences?

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:56.200
This character, the bunny girl

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:58.200
who appeared very briefly in season one,

01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:59.200
her name is Velvet.

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:02.200
She has a weird case that's got her weapon hidden in it,

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:04.200
and when she goes to use it in the fight,

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.200
her leader, who's a name I had to Google

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.200
because I don't think we're told it until the next season,

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.200
no, I'm not gonna tell you what it is,

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:10.200
says...

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.200
Hey, come on.

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:14.200
You spent all semester building that up.

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.200
Don't waste it here.

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:17.200
...and proceeds to do all the killing herself

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:20.200
with her cool minigun bag thing.

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.200
It's great.

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:22.200
This line is meant to be, like,

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:25.200
a funny nod to the audience, right?

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.200
Like, we've been building that up for ages.

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:28.200
Let's not waste it now.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:29.200
It's meant to be a funny joke,

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:32.200
but the problem is that joke requires the setup

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:35.200
of us having seen that Velvet has a weapon

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:37.200
and wanting to find out what it is,

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.200
but because the story's writing has been so mismanaged,

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:43.200
Velvet has been on screen for literally seconds

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:44.200
in the show so far.

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.200
The clip of Velvet you're seeing right now,

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:49.200
this is her only appearance in volume two.

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:50.200
She just walked off screen, right?

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:51.200
She's gone. That's it.

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:52.200
See you in the climax.

01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:54.200
So all we get is this scene of the group

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:56.200
leaving for a mission and another character

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:58.200
mentioning they sure have been away

01:15:58.200 --> 01:15:59.200
on that mission for a while.

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:02.200
Team Coffee's away mission lasted longer than expected.

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:05.200
We don't know who this character is.

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:07.200
The joke about Velvet's weapon combined with her

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.200
and her team's sparse appearance in the show

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:11.200
despite saving the day at the end

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.200
is perhaps the clearest look

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.200
into the early show's production problems.

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:17.200
Was this scene planned in advance

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:19.200
and then the writers didn't have room

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:21.200
to give Team Coffee a place in the story

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:23.200
because there was already too many characters to handle

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.200
and all the prom stuff?

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:27.200
Did Monty and co. suddenly drop the climactic fight

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.200
on the rest of the creators at the last minute

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.200
and then they had to scramble

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.200
to give it any sort of last minute justification?

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:35.200
Did the creative leads all mutually agree

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:37.200
that the best way to end a season of the show

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:40.200
was for it to star a bunch of random new characters?

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:42.200
I don't know, and it doesn't feel right to speculate,

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:43.200
but I do know that the way things are

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.200
means the story sucks.

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:47.200
The plot scenes of the show feel so weightless

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:49.200
and contribute so little to the thing

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:51.200
that really works, the fights,

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:54.200
that the story ends up being basically an afterthought.

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.200
I do have to say, though, it does look like

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:58.200
at some point in the production process

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:00.200
Team Coffee, or at least Velvet,

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:02.200
were meant to play a larger role in the show

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:04.200
and there is evidence that suggests this.

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:06.200
The behind-the-scenes production diaries for volume two

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:09.200
spend a lot of time specifically covering

01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:11.200
the creation and development of Velvet.

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.200
So we thought we would introduce you

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.200
to the various parts of the production pipeline

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:16.200
by following the supporting character of Velvet

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.200
that we introduced in volume one

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:20.200
and follow her from concept to modeling

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.200
and how she comes to life in the recording booth

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:24.200
and in the animation and in the edit.

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:26.200
They sifted through hundreds of fan submissions.

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:28.200
Over 1,300 submissions.

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:31.200
We see the modelers and rigging and artists

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:32.200
working on her and her weapons.

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:34.200
We see the effort that goes into designing

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:35.200
the case for her cool weapon,

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:37.200
but we don't want to spoil what's in it.

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:39.200
So this is what her weapon's gonna be in.

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:40.200
We're not showing the weapon yet,

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:42.200
because you're not gonna see that yet.

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.200
But we need something for her to carry it in.

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.200
You know, as if to imply that at some point in the show,

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:49.200
we would see Velvet have a box with the weapon in it

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:51.200
and people go, ooh, what's in it?

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:52.200
And she'd be like, ah, you'll see.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.200
We meet the voice actress, all of this stuff.

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:57.200
Hours and hours of multiple artists

01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:00.200
putting time and attention into creating this character

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:02.200
and all of this work goes into the creation

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:06.200
of a character who, due to some kind of natural disaster,

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:10.200
is on screen for, like, 30 seconds maximum

01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:13.200
and does nothing just to give you a sense

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:16.200
of how miserably mismanaged the writing was.

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:19.200
Velvet is speaking for about 14 seconds

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:21.200
of volume two of RWBY.

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:23.200
I just showed you all of it.

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.200
The interview with the voice actress

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.200
in the behind-the-scenes material is longer than that.

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:30.200
I think volume two might have needed a second draft.

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:33.200
This fight is technically really cool looking

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:35.200
and I really enjoy the animation,

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:37.200
especially this bit where the Grimm's legs flip out,

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:39.200
but imagine how much better the scene would have felt

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:41.200
if you knew who these characters were

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:45.200
or if this fight felt at all like part of a story,

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:46.200
you know?

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:48.200
It turns out that even compared to Machinima,

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:51.200
making an animated series is, like, really hard.

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.200
A whole ton of people have to work together

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.200
as part of a huge process to get this thing made.

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:59.200
And RWBY is a higher level of production

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:01.200
than any other show we've ever produced.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:03.200
And if the process isn't being managed very well

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:05.200
or the big picture ideas aren't there,

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.200
then the resulting show suffers massively.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.200
There are tons of scenes in the show

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:11.200
that are fairly decent, especially the fights,

01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.200
but because of issues with putting the show together,

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:16.200
the result is a show that's less than the sum of its parts

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:20.200
and what feels like two full seasons of teething problems.

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.200
You know, there are lots of shows with, like,

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:24.200
fun fights to watch like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:25.200
which I brought up earlier,

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.200
but the thing about those shows is

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:29.200
even when I remember the really cool fights,

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:31.200
I go back and watch entire episodes

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.200
or arcs of the show again.

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:33.200
I don't just go like,

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:34.200
oh, remember that fight? That fight's good.

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:36.200
Let's just watch that out of context.

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:37.200
Like, no, the storytelling is part

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.200
of what accentuates those scenes.

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.200
Fights in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure feel meaningful

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.200
because they've been built up to by the plot.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:46.200
Monty's fights are still some of the coolest fights,

01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:48.200
but they're never gonna have the impact they could have done

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.200
because either due to a lack of planning

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:53.200
of what the story would be or very poor writing choices

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:55.200
being made in connecting his action sequences,

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:58.200
the story these fights should have been a part of

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.200
is practically non-existent,

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.200
and honestly, it just seems like such a waste, you know?

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:04.200
So far we've mostly talked about the production

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:06.200
and execution angle of RWBY,

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:08.200
the telling of the story, the conveyance of the world,

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:10.200
and how well the writers incorporated

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:11.200
the action sequences,

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:13.200
but now we need to dig one layer deeper

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:16.200
and discuss the story they're trying to tell.

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:18.200
Remember that first fight in the dust store

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:21.200
and how I talked about how it is kind of a good idea

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:22.200
for an introductory scene?

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.200
Because introducing your protagonist

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:26.200
by having them stop a robbery is a good idea

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.200
for an opening.

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.200
In fact, it's a good intro

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:30.200
in the movie they got this idea from.

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:32.200
Oh, plot twist!

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:34.200
["Planet of the Apes"]

01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:35.200
["Planet of the Apes"]

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:37.200
Cowboy Bebop is a great anime.

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:39.200
It's a 26-episode series,

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.200
and it also has a feature-length movie.

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:42.200
In the movie, they reintroduce

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:43.200
the main characters from the show

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:44.200
by having there be a convenience store

01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:46.200
getting held up at gunpoint,

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.200
and Spike, the main character,

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.200
comes in with headphones on and shops around

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:51.200
pretending he can't tell what's going on

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:52.200
before expertly taking them all out

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:54.200
with some backup from his friend.

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:56.200
This is a really good opening scene.

01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:58.200
The problem with RWBY is that its writers

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.200
didn't seem to know why it was a good opening.

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:02.200
This opening works well in the movie

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:03.200
because it takes the opportunity

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:05.200
to tell us about our characters

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:06.200
and how they think.

01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:08.200
Spike tells a guy holding an old woman hostage

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:10.200
that he doesn't care if he shoots her.

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:12.200
Sorry, lady, but we don't protect or serve.

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:14.200
This is strictly business.

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:15.200
What?

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.200
Guess you'll just have to chalk it up to bad luck.

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.200
Which makes you think, oh, wow,

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:20.200
maybe this guy has no real regard for human life,

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:22.200
but then it turns out he did that

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.200
to get the guy to turn his gun on him

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:25.200
in order to save the lady's life,

01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:27.200
so really he has no regard for his own life

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.200
and will gladly put himself in extra danger

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.200
if it means it might help someone else.

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:33.200
This scene is good because it's what we call

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:34.200
characterization.

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.200
We're learning about our main character

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:37.200
and how he thinks.

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:39.200
The action is well animated and nice looking,

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:41.200
but that's secondary to the experience

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:43.200
of learning about our characters.

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:45.200
We're learning how little Spike values his own life.

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.200
If you keep on pushing it like this,

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:50.200
you're really going to get cut down to size for good.

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:51.200
Sorry.

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:53.200
I'm not exactly the delicate, cautious type.

01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:55.200
In the show, we have a lot of time

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:57.200
to learn in detail that Spike has embraced

01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:59.200
a very specific philosophy toward his life.

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:02.200
Whatever happens, happens.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:05.200
And he doesn't even really see himself as alive,

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:07.200
and this enables him to more easily throw himself

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:09.200
at life or death situations.

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.200
How he got this way is part of the story.

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.200
The movie sets up this part of his character

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:15.200
incredibly quickly for people who didn't see the show

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:17.200
or refreshes people who need a reminder

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.200
by showing how he saves a woman's life

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:21.200
by making sure it's him being shot at instead.

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:23.200
We're seeing a dimension of his character

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:25.200
which the rest of the story is going to go on to explore.

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:28.200
What does a man who doesn't value his own life

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:30.200
do with his life other than constantly risk it

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:32.200
in ways he didn't have to?

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:34.200
Is this a heroic trait or is it a bit sad

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:36.200
to constantly live this way?

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:38.200
Welcome to the core themes of Cowboy Bebop.

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:40.200
I mean, the movie's literally called

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:41.200
Knocking on Heaven's Door.

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:43.200
Like, the film's about these ideas.

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:45.200
This robbery doesn't really have anything

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.200
to do with the plot at all.

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:49.200
It's an unrelated opening scene,

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:51.200
but Cowboy Bebop's scene is better storytelling

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:53.200
because it is telling you things

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:55.200
and you are learning something

01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:57.200
and your brain is thinking about it.

01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.200
I wanna know more about what Spike's deal is.

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:01.200
I wanna see what he does next.

01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:04.200
What does Ruby set up about Ruby in this first scene?

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:07.200
Well, she's reading weapon magazine

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:09.200
and actually distracted instead of pretending

01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:12.200
which I guess shows us that she likes weapons a lot

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:14.200
and she's still a child who doesn't pay much attention

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:15.200
to her surroundings.

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:17.200
We also see she's a really strong fighter.

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.200
For example, without taking her weapon out,

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.200
using her bare hands,

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:23.200
she beats the shit out of two guys

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:25.200
bigger than her and sends them flying.

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:27.200
Remember this part. I'm gonna do a thing.

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:29.200
This isn't really much characterization.

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:32.200
Events in stories, even in intensive action sequences,

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:35.200
are compelling largely because of how meaningful

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:37.200
they are to the audience and this is achieved

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:39.200
by developing a connection with the characters.

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:42.200
The gang in Bebop choose to get involved in this

01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:44.200
and choose how specifically to handle

01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:45.200
everything that happens,

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:47.200
and Spike even deliberately chooses

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.200
to put himself in way more danger

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:50.200
to try to help someone else.

01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:52.200
What these decisions are

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:54.200
and why they make them are interesting.

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:57.200
The story of this movie is what we call character-driven.

01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:58.200
In this opening scene,

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:01.200
Ruby never actually has to make a choice.

01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:02.200
She just happens to be there,

01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:05.200
just happens to be a badass anime warrior

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.200
who can beat these guys easily,

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:08.200
and then just happens to be seen doing it

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:10.200
by a professor at Anime Hogwarts

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:12.200
who refers her to the headmaster.

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:14.200
Ruby gets into this school and is therefore present

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:16.200
for the rest of the plot of the show

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:18.200
because she happened to be in a store

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:20.200
while it was being robbed.

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:22.200
This isn't character-driven story writing.

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:25.200
This is coincidence-driven story writing.

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:27.200
Also, about this scene where Ruby is, like,

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:30.200
being interrogated by Glinda and Gandalf Goku,

01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:33.200
they're, like, in this dimly lit chamber

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:35.200
like it's a prison or something,

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:37.200
but then it turns out that she was brought here

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:40.200
to be invited to a school.

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:42.200
Hello. Nice to meet you.

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:44.200
You want to come to my school?

01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:47.200
Why is it shot and lit like an interrogation?

01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:48.200
Where are they?

01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:52.200
Is this, like, a safe house that this guy has?

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:54.200
Okay, there actually is an explanation

01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:55.200
for why this scene is like this,

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.200
and we're gonna get into it.

01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:58.200
Don't you worry. It's a doozy.

01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:00.200
So the issue with the dust store robbery

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:03.200
is that Ruby doesn't actually choose to do anything.

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:06.200
A fight happens at her, and she wins.

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:08.200
To be honest, that's basically the entire plot of the show,

01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:10.200
except sometimes the fight happens

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:12.200
at someone else we barely know.

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:15.200
So the issue with this scene is lack of characterization,

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:17.200
and this isn't a failure of the writing

01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:19.200
of the specific scene but a more general problem

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:22.200
with the way the creative leads treat the characters.

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:25.200
Ruby hasn't been made a particularly interesting person.

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:28.200
She has a cool gun and is good at fighting

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:31.200
and wants to be a hero, and that's about it.

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:33.200
Your book. Does it have a name?

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:35.200
It's about a man with two souls.

01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:36.200
I love books.

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:38.200
I love books.

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:39.200
Our main character, ladies and gentlemen.

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.200
Coming up with compelling characters

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:42.200
who make interesting decisions

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:46.200
is basically the core job of stories.

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:48.200
Ruby is effectively a blank slate,

01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:50.200
so she's just not interesting

01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:52.200
except when she's physically doing something interesting

01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:55.200
with her cool gun, like bouncing in the air

01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:57.200
using its blowback to slow her descent.

01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:00.200
That's interesting for a couple of seconds.

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:02.200
Ruby's so poorly characterized

01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:04.200
that the writers are still making up their minds

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:06.200
multiple seasons in to the point

01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:08.200
that even what little we do know about her

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:11.200
gets rewritten to try to make her more interesting

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:12.200
than she first appeared.

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:14.200
For example, when Ruby falls into the plot,

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:16.200
she doesn't have a weapon with her,

01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:18.200
but luckily, as we've seen,

01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:20.200
she's an expert at hand-to-hand combat

01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:21.200
and can easily dispatch the...

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:22.200
Ow!

01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:24.200
Oh, wait.

01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:26.200
Between these two scenes, the writers decided

01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:28.200
it would be more interesting for Ruby

01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:30.200
to be useless without her weapon.

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:32.200
Wow, you are much more manageable

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:34.200
without that oversized gardening tool of yours.

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:36.200
So now we're in a situation

01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:38.200
where characters' basic abilities

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:39.200
are being rewritten on a whim

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.200
to try to make the story more interesting,

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.200
and maybe it is more interesting,

01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:46.200
and all you have to do to engage with this new story

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:49.200
is forget the events of the very first scene in the show.

01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:52.200
So what little characterization is happening

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:54.200
in this scene gets rewritten later.

01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:57.200
This means even in potentially cool scenes

01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:00.200
taken directly from one of the best anime ever,

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:02.200
the scene doesn't work because the character

01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:04.200
doesn't have an opportunity to act,

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:06.200
to make choices, so, yeah,

01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:08.200
I'm gonna say this scene doesn't work very well,

01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:10.200
because it doesn't have any decently

01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:12.200
thought-out characters in it

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:15.200
and therefore has nothing to tell or show us about them

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:17.200
except for the basic aesthetic design

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:18.200
of Ruby and her weapon

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.200
and the coolness of the fight animations.

01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:22.200
So the writers evidently had seen

01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:24.200
the opening of Cowboy Bebop the movie,

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:26.200
enjoyed it because it's great...

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:27.200
Nice.

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.200
And decided to start their show in a similar way

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:31.200
but didn't know why Cowboy Bebop's opening

01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:33.200
actually worked so well,

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:35.200
so they just borrowed the surface components.

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.200
Store robbery, acting distracted,

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:39.200
headphones, and cool fight

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:41.200
without using them in a way

01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:44.200
that does anything specific for the audience.

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:46.200
Now, you could say, well, how do you know

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:48.200
this is the scene that inspired them?

01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:50.200
What if the scenes just happen to be similar?

01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:53.200
Well, if that's the case, the scene still doesn't work

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:55.200
and the comparison still shows how much better

01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:57.200
the scene could have been if it was being used

01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:59.200
for actual characterization, but, yeah,

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:01.200
maybe the similarities are accidental.

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:04.200
To prove they aren't, I'd have to somehow demonstrate

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:06.200
the creators had seen Cowboy Bebop

01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:08.200
and there's just no easy way.

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:09.200
If I had to recommend a show to someone

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:10.200
looking to get into anime,

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:12.200
I'd go with my personal favorite, Cowboy Bebop,

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:13.200
because I think it's got enough, like,

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:14.200
Western stuff going on.

01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:15.200
I'll just say Spike.

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:16.200
I'm just gonna say Spike Spiegel

01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:18.200
from Cowboy Bebop because he's just like water

01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:20.200
and he's so cool.

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:21.200
My favorite is Cowboy Bebop.

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:23.200
My favorite anime is Cowboy Bebop.

01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:25.200
My favorite anime is Cowboy Bebop

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:27.200
and although it's not technically an anime,

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:29.200
I also love Avatar the Last Airbender.

01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:31.200
Avatar. Hmm.

01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:33.200
Okay, so I'm gonna go out on a limb here

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:36.200
and say maybe Miles was inspired by his favorite anime

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:38.200
while trying to write an anime.

01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:40.200
You know what? I keep falling back to Bebop,

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:42.200
but, uh, uh, uh,

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:44.200
you shouldn't just run away from your past.

01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:45.200
Sometimes you just gotta deal with the problems

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:47.200
that you started and if you don't,

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:48.200
they will catch up with you.

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:51.200
Keep in mind I'm not saying this is plagiarism.

01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:53.200
Creative theft is a different thing entirely.

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:55.200
I'm saying this is derivative

01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:57.200
and doesn't even replicate the thing it's trying to.

01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:00.200
It's certainly not wrong to draw inspiration

01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:01.200
from other works you like

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:04.200
or even pay deliberate homage to things you enjoy

01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:06.200
or which seem fitting to reference in a scene.

01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:08.200
I mean, Cowboy Bebop does this all the time

01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:09.200
and the convenience store scene

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:11.200
actually references Pulp Fiction

01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:12.200
when one of the robbers they don't know about

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:14.200
comes out of the bathroom and surprises them

01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:17.200
which happens literally three times in Pulp Fiction.

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:18.200
I'm gonna take a shit.

01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:19.200
Pretty sure this is a reference

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:20.200
and I should know.

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:22.200
I had a lot of very long arguments

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:24.200
on now-deleted fan forums about whether this counts

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.200
and let me just say to Mazin Kaiser X

01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:27.200
if you're still out there,

01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:29.200
I have a YouTube channel now

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:31.200
so fuck you, you little philistine.

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:32.200
I win.

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.200
What I'm getting at here is that firstly,

01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:35.200
I've always been cool

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:36.200
but also that there's nothing wrong

01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:38.200
with wearing your inspiration on your sleeve.

01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:41.200
What is wrong is doing it without understanding

01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:43.200
what made the original thing work

01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:45.200
because now it's not a cool introduction

01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:47.200
to a character, story, and setting

01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:49.200
inspired by another good thing.

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:52.200
It's a weird, clunky, and unnecessary scene

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:55.200
whose best feature is it reminds people of Cowboy Bebop

01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:58.200
but RWBY doesn't just remind me of Bebop.

01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:00.200
It reminds me of a lot of other anime

01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:02.200
and this is a result of the show's design.

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:04.200
And then the next day, he was like,

01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:06.200
hey, we should make an anime.

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:08.200
So as prep before writing the show,

01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:10.200
Monty gave the writers some homework.

01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:12.200
Anime homework.

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:14.200
Uh, I went to Carrie and I went, I, I,

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:16.200
I gave him anime homework.

01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:17.200
If you, if you want to be honest,

01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:18.200
you should do some anime homework

01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:20.200
so I just started giving him shows to watch

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:23.200
that we could, you know, work comparatively to

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:26.200
and then, um, Miles was the second person onto this

01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:28.200
where I would give him anime homework.

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:30.200
Watch this show if you wanna, if you wanna be part of it.

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:31.200
Now, I don't like admitting this.

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:32.200
I'm kind of secretive about it,

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:34.200
but I've seen a lot of anime in my time

01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:36.200
and I know a bit about it.

01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:38.200
I'd like to think no one's noticed this about me,

01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:41.200
but we've somehow finally reached a place

01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:43.200
where proper criticism of a piece of media

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:45.200
relies on using that knowledge,

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:46.200
a concept which terrifies me,

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:48.200
but with the benefit of your trust,

01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:50.200
we'll come out the other side having learned more

01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:52.200
and improved our analytical technique.

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:53.200
So in the name of science,

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:55.200
let's punch this plate of spaghetti

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:58.200
in order to reverse engineer it to its component ingredients

01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.200
and find out what's really going on.

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:02.200
It's a reference, but I'm also making

01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:05.200
a clever metaphor for analysis.

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:07.200
do-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:12.200
♪♪

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:15.200
RWBY is inspired by anime not just in terms of visuals

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:17.200
but more directly by the tropes and idioms

01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:20.200
and basic story elements of shows the creators liked

01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:22.200
or at least were told to watch.

01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:24.200
The problem is it draws far too much

01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:27.200
on ideas and concepts that feel like anime

01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:29.200
without really understanding what made

01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:31.200
the things it's borrowing actually work

01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:33.200
in the shows they were in.

01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:35.200
RWBY is a really strange bunch of shows,

01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:37.200
and if you're willing to check,

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:39.200
you can even find out which ones.

01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:41.200
In a Reddit thread, Miles Luna said what some of the shows

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:43.200
on his anime homework list were.

01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:45.200
Among them, Gurren Lagann, Soul Eater,

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:47.200
Naruto, Bleach, and Black Rock Shooter.

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.200
Some of these shows have direct parallels

01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:51.200
with RWBY's story.

01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:53.200
Naruto, Bleach, and Soul Eater especially

01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:54.200
have direct contrasts.

01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:56.200
All these shows have large casts of characters

01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:58.200
who all, for their specific story reasons,

01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:00.200
have their own unique powers.

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:02.200
This is really traditional for shounen shows.

01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:04.200
Everyone kind of has their own deal, and in Bleach,

01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:07.200
almost every main character has a unique magical sword

01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:09.200
which grants them a specific ability,

01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:12.200
and the main character in Soul Eater wields a cool scythe.

01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:15.200
It's not that hard to tell what ideas RWBY

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:17.200
is borrowing from these shows, is it?

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:19.200
But again, the core elements being borrowed

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:22.200
are the really basic Wikipedia-level synopsis ideas.

01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:24.200
The sort of stuff people who don't watch anime

01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:26.200
think anime is about,

01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:28.200
like the school for learning anime fighting,

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:31.200
the large cast of characters with cool abilities and powers,

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:33.200
the super simple stuff that isn't really

01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:35.200
why anyone watches something.

01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:37.200
These shows work because they're really about

01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:40.200
the characters and their choices and relationships,

01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:42.200
and they happen to be set against a fun,

01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:44.200
fantastical background with cool action.

01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:46.200
Boruto's dad and his army of frenemies

01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:49.200
live rich inner lives and form interesting connections

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:52.200
with each other and the audience as they grow and change.

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:55.200
In Soul Eater, the cool weapons are alive

01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:58.200
and lots of focus is put on how they relate to

01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:01.200
and work with their users, and this also happens in Bleach

01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:03.200
but, you know, in a way where it seems really awesome

01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:06.200
and you choose to watch it over all the other shounen

01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:08.200
at the time and then it crushes your hopes and dreams,

01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:11.200
and it seems like in the early RWBY Weiss relationship,

01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:13.200
this is what they were going for.

01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:15.200
The way they bicker in the early trial

01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:17.200
and Weiss is angry about not being the leader later,

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:19.200
this is honestly, genuinely the beginning

01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:21.200
of an interesting relationship,

01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:23.200
but instead of making this an aspect of the show,

01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:25.200
they fix it and make someone else's life

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:27.200
the focus of the show for half of it,

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:29.200
and then someone else turns up to do all the fighting,

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:31.200
so the thing that makes these shows work,

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:33.200
the characters, their relationships,

01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:35.200
your engagement with the characters as they do

01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:37.200
fun fights is absent.

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:40.200
It's a stew but without the most important ingredient,

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.200
the stew mix. That's the rule, by the way.

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:44.200
You're allowed to make food metaphors in criticism

01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:46.200
but only when they're actually a clever reference.

01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:48.200
At best, the main character,

01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:50.200
who theoretically should be the most interesting,

01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:54.200
is a lady in a nice outfit with a cool gun.

01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:57.200
That's a really low ceiling to put on a story.

01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:00.200
RWBY feels like fan fiction of a show that doesn't exist.

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:02.200
Except, no, that's not true.

01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:05.200
There is one specific show it feels a whole lot

01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:07.200
like fan fiction for.

01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:09.200
To quote Miles Luna again,

01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:11.200
if you want to get a feel of what the show will be like,

01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:13.200
watch Avatar The Last Airbender.

01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:15.200
Oh, this explains a lot of things.

01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:17.200
Once you go watch Avatar, you start to realize

01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:19.200
where a lot of the show came from.

01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:21.200
For example, Avatar is set in a world

01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:22.200
with four nations in it.

01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:26.200
Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.

01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:28.200
RWBY has four kingdoms,

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:29.200
so you see it's different.

01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:31.200
The four kingdoms.

01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:33.200
They're called kingdoms because, well,

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:34.200
they can't call them nations, can they?

01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:36.200
In Avatar, in times of stress,

01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:38.200
the Avatar enters a state where his eyes glow

01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:40.200
and he manifests amazing powers.

01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:43.200
You'll never guess that three seasons into the story

01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:45.200
with zero setup that this is a thing,

01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:47.200
RWBY's eyes suddenly glow,

01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:49.200
and she's revealed to have the amazing power

01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:52.200
to instantly turn even the most powerful Grimm to stone.

01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:55.200
You learn she has this power the instant it happens,

01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:57.200
and you only learn what this power is in retrospect

01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:59.200
because there was no room in the story

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:00.200
to set this up, was there?

01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:02.200
Another cool thing about Avatar is that the Avatar

01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:05.200
reincarnates into a new form whenever he dies.

01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:07.200
Completely coincidentally, there's a character in RWBY

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:09.200
whose spirit goes on to inhabit a new form

01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:11.200
whenever he dies. Amazing.

01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:12.200
You see, it's actually a clever twist

01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:14.200
because no one would have expected them

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:15.200
to be that obvious,

01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:18.200
so when they really did just do Avatar again,

01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:19.200
it's a genuine surprise.

01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:22.200
Oh, another massively important plot element.

01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:24.200
One of the antagonists is a revolutionary

01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:26.200
political movement reacting to oppression

01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:30.200
led by a man in a mask with horrendous scars underneath.

01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:31.200
Was I talking about RWBY there?

01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:33.200
No, I was talking about Avatar, Legend of Korra,

01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:35.200
but, yes, that also happens in RWBY.

01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:37.200
Oh, actually, you see, the scar is different

01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:39.200
because it's over one of his eyes.

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:41.200
That's slightly different from Avatar,

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:42.200
so it's not the same thing.

01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:44.200
You see, no, what's this picture of Zuko doing here?

01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:47.200
Then in later seasons, they decide to take the story

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:48.200
in a very different direction,

01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:49.200
you know, to make it a bit more unique,

01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:51.200
so now the characters have to travel the world

01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:53.200
and visit lots of different towns and villages

01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:55.200
and cultures on their way,

01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:56.200
which is completely unlike Avatar

01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:58.200
because when it happens in Avatar, it's good.

01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:00.200
Remember when I was positive about the potential

01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:02.200
of RWBY's story and setting?

01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:05.200
Well, it feels like I'm really just complimenting

01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:06.200
the material it borrowed.

01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:08.200
So many of RWBY's choices seem made

01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:10.200
specifically that way because it was that way

01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:13.200
in Avatar even though it's completely unnecessary

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:14.200
to borrow those parts.

01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:18.200
Why is it that every time you play with magic water,

01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:20.200
I get soaked?

01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:23.200
It's not magic. It's waterbending.

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:24.200
Oh, my God.

01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:25.200
Is that where the characters' powers

01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:27.200
not being magic came from?

01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:29.200
Why would you even think to do that?

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:31.200
I always thought each season of RWBY being called a volume

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:34.200
was a bit weird and unwieldy, and guess what?

01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:35.200
It turns out it sounds way better

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:37.200
when they're called books.

01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:39.200
Even the intro voiceover sometimes sounds

01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:41.200
like they right-click Thesaurus

01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:43.200
some aspects of Avatar's intro.

01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:45.200
My grandmother used to tell me stories

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:46.200
about the old days.

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:47.200
Legends.

01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:50.200
Stories scattered through time.

01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:51.200
It's like the show's playing a game

01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:53.200
of telephone with Avatar.

01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:55.200
Those words in that order sounded good,

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:58.200
so let's use some words that are a bit similar

01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:01.200
in a different order and also make it all about dust.

01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:04.200
The thing that made Avatar's introduction work

01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:06.200
is it set up a lot of stuff at once.

01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:09.200
For example, how this settings version of magic worked,

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:11.200
the thing you didn't mention at all,

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:13.200
or the fact there were four big nations.

01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:15.200
You know, the thing you didn't mention at all

01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:18.200
except for when four castle-looking things

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:20.200
turn up for three seconds before disappearing.

01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:22.200
Jaune is a pretty direct analog for Sokka

01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:24.200
to the point where the creators just say

01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:25.200
that's what he's based on.

01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:26.200
Oh, no, I was saying, like,

01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:28.200
when you first did Reeds and I was like,

01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:30.200
we need, like, a Sokka character.

01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:32.200
And this retroactively explains

01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:34.200
why Jaune's plot line was so weird.

01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:36.200
Jaune Arc had this subplot of Jaune

01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:38.200
not accepting Pyrrha's offer to help train him

01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:39.200
to be a better fighter,

01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:41.200
but his explanation for why was always really strange.

01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:43.200
He wants to get better without help,

01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:46.200
or he's not really a hero or something.

01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:48.200
If I can't do this on my own,

01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:49.200
then what good am I?

01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:52.200
But he never tries and never pays attention in class,

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:54.200
so that's bullshit,

01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:56.200
and at the end of his section of the story,

01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:57.200
he just accepts her help.

01:37:57.200 --> 01:37:59.200
Standing up to a bully taught him to...

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:02.200
This confusing arc happens because it happened to Sokka.

01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:04.200
In Avatar, a story with characters

01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:07.200
with depth and infinitely better world building,

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:09.200
in the beginning Sokka is not a great warrior,

01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:11.200
but he desperately wants to be one.

01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:13.200
He's from a culture that looks down on the idea

01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:14.200
of women being fighters,

01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:16.200
but then he gets wrecked by an order

01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:18.200
of female warriors who protect a village

01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:19.200
on their travels and has to confront

01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:20.200
his beliefs about women.

01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:22.200
He learns a lesson from this

01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:23.200
and begs them to train him.

01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:25.200
He gets better as a fighter,

01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:27.200
but this plot line is super engaging for an audience

01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:29.200
because we get to watch him grow as a person

01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:31.200
and change his beliefs.

01:38:31.200 --> 01:38:33.200
Sokka starts out, like, kind of as a shitty teen.

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:34.200
I thought I would really not like him

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:35.200
when I first watched Avatar,

01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:37.200
but he grows so much.

01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:40.200
He becomes such an interesting character super quickly.

01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:42.200
So now it's clear why Jaune's arc

01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:44.200
is seemingly missing pieces.

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:46.200
It's not just that Sokka was written better,

01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:47.200
but more specifically,

01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:49.200
it's clear the writers liked the idea

01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:51.200
of giving their Sokka character the same arc,

01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:53.200
but the problem with this arc is

01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:55.200
it means one of your core characters starts out

01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:58.200
as a bit of a chauvinist and needs time and work

01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:00.200
to grow into a better person,

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:02.200
but if you're trying to write a cool, progressive anime

01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:04.200
starring mostly girls,

01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:06.200
you don't want to have a character acting like that,

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:08.200
do you? That sounds kind of heavy,

01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:10.200
and are you really going to write your character

01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:12.200
who you voice to act like that?

01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:14.200
So Jaune is written to already start out

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:16.200
as basically a good person

01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:18.200
who respects women's abilities as fighters

01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:20.200
who simply needs to learn to accept help

01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:23.200
instead of refusing it for what is now no reason.

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:25.200
It actually turns out that a ton of weird things

01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:27.200
about RWBY happened that way

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:29.200
because they were like that in Avatar.

01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:31.200
The interrogation thing in the first episode of RWBY

01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:33.200
was always a silly choice.

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:35.200
Why take her to this weird dimly lit empty room

01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:37.200
to invite her to a school?

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:39.200
But it makes much more sense if you happen to have seen

01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:41.200
the first episode of Legend of Korra

01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:43.200
when Korra gets arrested and interrogated.

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:45.200
If a scene in RWBY seems out of place

01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:47.200
or like a scene from another show

01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:49.200
just happened for no reason in the middle of this one,

01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:51.200
it's probably because it did,

01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:53.200
so it's pretty clear to the point

01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:55.200
they literally admit it that a big problem

01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:57.200
with RWBY's writing is that the creators

01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:59.200
are grasping wildly at shows they like

01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:01.200
for things to recreate in their show

01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:03.200
in the hopes of crafting a story.

01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:05.200
It's only technically been written

01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:07.200
in one sense of the word.

01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:09.200
It's more of a reconstituted amalgam

01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:11.200
of things they thought were cool elsewhere.

01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:13.200
Grind up all that meat and stuff it

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:15.200
into a sausage casing or I guess

01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:17.200
in this case a body pillow.

01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:19.200
No, Miles, what are you doing? This is really embarrassing.

01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:22.200
Ruby Rose is a 15-year-old girl.

01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:24.200
If you like anything about RWBY

01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:26.200
and you haven't seen much anime before

01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:28.200
because it didn't seem like it was for you,

01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:30.200
I guarantee you right now there's a show

01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:32.200
in this list that the thing you liked

01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:34.200
about RWBY came from and you'd like

01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:36.200
that show a hell of a lot more

01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:38.200
and let's be honest, it's probably Avatar.

01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:40.200
A lot of people I've met who are really big fans

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:42.200
of RWBY tend to be not into anime.

01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:44.200
They don't think it's for them or they haven't watched it

01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:46.200
before yet, but if you take the plunge

01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:48.200
and then you see how good a show using these ideas

01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:50.200
could be, you'll very quickly be able

01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:52.200
to see why a lot of people with a bit more

01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:54.200
of a frame of reference are so disappointed

01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:56.200
with this show. Go pick a show from that list

01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:58.200
and have a better time. Seriously.

01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:00.200
Just make sure it's not Bleach. Don't make the same mistake

01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:02.200
I did. Please, you mustn't! You have to!

01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:04.200
There's a scene in volume two where it turns out

01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:06.200
Yang and Ruby have a family dog called Zwei.

01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:08.200
There's a dog in Cowboy Bebop

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:10.200
of the same breed called Ain.

01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:12.200
Get it? The creators are trying to make a cute

01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:14.200
reference to a show they like.

01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:16.200
They don't seem to have realized they've referenced

01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:18.200
all the shows they like quite enough already.

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:20.200
I was hoping they'd eventually

01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:22.200
try doing something else.

01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:24.200
The real impact of all this on Ruby's potential

01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:26.200
is that it means the things

01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:28.200
that are truly unique about it get ignored.

01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:30.200
Because the world building is vague

01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:32.200
and really just a loose approximation

01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:34.200
of nine other cartoons, all kinds

01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:36.200
of little tidbits crop up that would be

01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:38.200
so interesting if they went anywhere

01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:40.200
but never will. Remember Crescent Rose?

01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:42.200
You know, one of the most dangerous weapons

01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:44.200
ever designed? One of the most dangerous

01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:46.200
weapons ever designed? There is one

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:48.200
really interesting story element to it

01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:50.200
which is that Ruby designed it.

01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:52.200
Well, I'm kind of a dork

01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:54.200
when it comes to weapons. I guess I did go

01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:56.200
a little overboard in designing it.

01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:58.200
Ruby designed this weapon. One of the most

01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:00.200
dangerous weapons ever designed. Now,

01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:02.200
if you were looking at the script and you'd

01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:04.200
written these two things, what you should

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:06.200
do at that moment is kiss yourself

01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:08.200
and realize that you've just struck

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:10.200
fucking gold. The main character

01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:12.200
of your show is a child inventor

01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:14.200
who can craft incredible machines

01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:16.200
that kill. What a fantastic

01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:18.200
premise for a story and Ruby

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:20.200
loves to read weapon magazines

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:22.200
and nerds out about the weapons she sees

01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:24.200
when she first gets to anime warrior school.

01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:26.200
Like, they've almost written a

01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:28.200
character here and everything else about

01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:30.200
Ruby's character is the most milquetoast

01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:32.200
stuff possible like, oh, she wants to be a hero?

01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:34.200
Great. I love books.

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:36.200
I think this line annoys me so much because

01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:38.200
like, Ruby has a really interesting character

01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:40.200
trait you could be doing something with.

01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:42.200
And you're doing this?

01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:44.200
No! No, you can't! I forbid it!

01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:46.200
And when this comes up,

01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:48.200
Ruby's talking to Jaune whose deal is

01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:50.200
he just has a regular sword.

01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:52.200
Like, it's a punchline. And when I was

01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:54.200
first watching the show, I was really having my doubts

01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:56.200
about where things were going, but when this happened,

01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:58.200
I thought, oh, cool.

01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:00.200
Ruby's gonna help him design a unique

01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:02.200
weapon that really works for him and we're

01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:04.200
gonna see them coming up with it and building

01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:06.200
it and developing as friends and that's

01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:08.200
gonna be so cool. Jaune's gonna come

01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:10.200
into his own and learn things about himself

01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:12.200
as he does it and grow as a fighter

01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:14.200
and as a person and there's something really wholesome

01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:16.200
about learning a skill and building something

01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:18.200
in a story. That'll be a really cool

01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:20.200
thing to follow. And then,

01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:22.200
it didn't happen for a season because they were doing

01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:24.200
anime bullshit instead.

01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:26.200
Fighting monsters, dealing with bullies,

01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:28.200
falling asleep during pointless

01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:30.200
exposition. Oh, and in the show as well.

01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:32.200
And then for years, I kept thinking,

01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:34.200
when are they gonna do it? When are they gonna do it?

01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:36.200
When are they going to use

01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:38.200
Ruby's interesting character trait

01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:40.200
that they just seemingly forgot she has?

01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:42.200
And then, finally,

01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:44.200
in volume four,

01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:46.200
they go to a blacksmith and a character

01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:48.200
who we've never seen before and never will again

01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:50.200
upgrades Jaune's sword using

01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:52.200
pieces of his girlfriend's armor.

01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:54.200
And Ruby rarely, if ever, talks about

01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:56.200
the fact she made Crescent Rose and

01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:58.200
she stops nerding out about weapons except

01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:00.200
for, like, once per season if the

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:02.200
writers remember that was her one unique

01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:04.200
character trait. Ah, but I'm sure you're

01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:06.200
going somewhere with this Avatar remake.

01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:08.200
Don't let me distract you. No, I'm not even fucking

01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:10.200
kidding you. Even the forging of

01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:12.200
a sword out of some cool material he

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:14.200
has is a thing Sokka does in Avatar.

01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:16.200
It just doesn't stop.

01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:18.200
It never stops. This show has

01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:20.200
so many cool concepts that

01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:22.200
just crop up like that where if you're paying

01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:24.200
attention, there's tremendous potential being

01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:26.200
laid down here and then they ignore it to just

01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:28.200
loosely copy stuff from

01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:30.200
fucking Bleach. Look, that guy

01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:32.200
has the sword that's a bit like the

01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:34.200
one from Bleach. Do you remember

01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:36.200
Bleach? I remember

01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:38.200
Bleach. Someone

01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:40.200
please validate me remembering so much

01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:42.200
Bleach. There's a Roger Ebert quote I always

01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:44.200
really liked and used in a draft of

01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:46.200
this video I was working on like five

01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:48.200
years ago which Lindsay Ellis happened

01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:50.200
to use first in a video before

01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:52.200
me so now it feels like I'm ripping her off.

01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:54.200
Thanks, Lindsay. Where when reviewing

01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:56.200
Battlefield Earth, he makes the comment that the

01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:58.200
director has learned from better films

01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:00.200
that directors sometimes tilt their

01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:02.200
cameras but he has not learned why.

01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:04.200
I'm gonna take a shit. I believe Miles

01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:06.200
when he tells me Avatar is one of his

01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:08.200
favorite shows but I'm not convinced

01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:10.200
he knows why he liked it. Cowboy Bebop

01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:12.200
is cool because it's about a man who

01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:14.200
believes his life is already over

01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:16.200
throwing himself into life or death situations

01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:18.200
to feel alive again. Spike

01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:20.200
Spiegel carries a weight with

01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:22.200
him and you have to watch him do his best

01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:24.200
to pretend he isn't. Cowboy

01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:26.200
Bebop is not cool because

01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:28.200
he's good at spinny kicks and

01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:30.200
his friend has a robot arm and frankly

01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:32.200
the idea that that's what really

01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:34.200
mattered is personally offensive

01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:36.200
to me. If you really respect this

01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:38.200
material, you should borrow the things

01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:40.200
that gave it meaning, not all of this

01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:42.200
surface level stuff. This is kind of

01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:44.200
the important thing to drill in on here.

01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:46.200
These shows aren't about cool powers

01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:48.200
or great visuals or engaging

01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:50.200
fights. They have those but on a core

01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:52.200
level, what they're really about is

01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:54.200
characters, people who you feel

01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:56.200
things for, who you watch do things,

01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:58.200
who you can be invested in. If you

01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:00.200
don't have that base layer of engagement

01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:02.200
with the people in your story,

01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:04.200
you don't really have much of anything.

01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:06.200
If you have a cool fight but you haven't made

01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:08.200
people interested in or understand

01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:10.200
why they're fighting, then you

01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:12.200
don't even really have the fight, do you?

01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:14.200
Lots of things in the show are references to

01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:16.200
other Rooster Teeth properties. There's

01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:18.200
in-jokes everywhere, posters from other shows,

01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:20.200
quotes from their podcasts,

01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:22.200
this store's name is a pun on

01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:24.200
a simple walk into Mordor,

01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:26.200
that show they did about walking in New Zealand.

01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:28.200
Even tiny things like

01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:30.200
Jaune's locker number is a reference

01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:32.200
to the address of Rooster Teeth's old studio.

01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:34.200
Whatever unique story and

01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:36.200
potential there is in here, it's taking

01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:38.200
refuge behind an immense patchwork

01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:40.200
quilt of references to

01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:42.200
other things they like, other things

01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:44.200
their company made, and eventually

01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:46.200
references to the few things people

01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:48.200
seemed to like about the show itself.

01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:50.200
One of the standout moments that people

01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:52.200
really liked about early RWBY is the part

01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:54.200
where Nora pokes Ren's nose and says

01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:56.200
boop. Boop. People really

01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:58.200
liked that because it's a genuinely

01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:00.200
simple and cute moment that you don't

01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:02.200
need to know Rooster Teeth lore to enjoy

01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:04.200
and isn't trying and failing

01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:06.200
to emulate something else. It's just nice.

01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:08.200
You know? That's good. It's cute.

01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:10.200
People also really liked the way Penny introduced

01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:12.200
herself because it's genuinely a really

01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:14.200
nice moment. Like, Weiss accidentally

01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:16.200
knocks her over and she just goes

01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:18.200
salutations.

01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:20.200
That's funny. That's good writing. That's

01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:22.200
characterization. It's immediately clear

01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:24.200
that something is up with Penny. It's good.

01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:26.200
Please stop being sometimes

01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:28.200
good and getting my hopes up.

01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:30.200
So, of course, in addition to selling

01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:32.200
merchandise that quotes these moments,

01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:34.200
in the second season Nora starts wearing

01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:36.200
a boop shirt. They don't have room

01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:38.200
to make the prom stuff interesting

01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:40.200
or to connect Monty's fights properly

01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:42.200
and make them feel like part of a story

01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:44.200
but they had room to go, hey,

01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:46.200
remember when she said boop?

01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:48.200
Well, it's in stores now. The show is

01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:50.200
just a continuous list of references

01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:52.200
to other things that were good,

01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:54.200
and by the middle of season two, sorry,

01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:56.200
book two, sorry, volume two,

01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:58.200
it's referencing the few good parts

01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:00.200
of itself. Writing, like,

01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:02.200
the word writing is often

01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:04.200
used to mean a lot of

01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:06.200
different things but at its core

01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:08.200
writing means

01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:10.200
making decisions and

01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:12.200
risking making the wrong one.

01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:14.200
What's acutely frustrating about Ruby

01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:16.200
is that Miles and Kerry don't

01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:18.200
necessarily always make

01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:20.200
bad decisions. It's that they have

01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:22.200
done almost everything they can to

01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:24.200
make them, to abdicate the

01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:26.200
responsibility of having to write

01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:28.200
a story of their own. They don't understand

01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:30.200
exactly why the

01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:32.200
things they're borrowing actually were

01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:34.200
enjoyable, which makes it worse, but

01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:36.200
centrally they're in this mess because they're

01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:38.200
going out of their way not to be

01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:40.200
unique and thereby failing to do

01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:42.200
interesting things with or apparently

01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:44.200
even notice the potential

01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:46.200
that an original animated work made for

01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:48.200
the internet with no oversight can have.

01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:50.200
The show could have been

01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:52.200
anything, and it wants to be anything

01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:54.200
other than itself, and that wasted

01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:56.200
potential will never not be tremendously

01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:58.200
disappointing. When you take

01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:00.200
no risks and try to say

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:02.200
very little while looking like

01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:04.200
you're saying something important, you get

01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:06.200
a story element like the Faunus.

01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:10.200
By later in the first volume,

01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:12.200
we finally sat in a classroom and learned what

01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:14.200
the Faunus are and also seen the bully character

01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:16.200
mistreating one of them. The Faunus are

01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:18.200
a stand-in for the oppressed races

01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:20.200
of the world. Yes, that is correct.

01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:22.200
I did not misspeak. These guys

01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:24.200
have to talk about racism now

01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:26.200
and I am here for

01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:28.200
it. I've heard it mentioned that this aspect

01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:30.200
of the story was originally conceived by

01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:32.200
Monty, but unfortunately the story

01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:34.200
is being written by the men who brought you

01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:36.200
My Semblance is Polarity?

01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:38.200
The big twist in volume

01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:40.200
one is that Blake is a Faunus.

01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:42.200
She gets mad at Weiss for being a racist

01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:44.200
and runs away and dramatically

01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:46.200
takes off her bow to reveal

01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:48.200
her fat ears in addition

01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:50.200
to her normal ears. Have you guessed which

01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:52.200
fairy tale character Blake is based on yet?

01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:54.200
Well, I'll tell you.

01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:57.200
She's Beauty and the Beast.

01:49:57.200 --> 01:49:59.200
Ugh!

01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:01.200
Now, I don't know about you, but Ruby didn't

01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:03.200
initially strike me as a show that was

01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:05.200
trying to be about something this heavy.

01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:07.200
I mean, for the most part, it's been an adventure

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:09.200
story about kids beating up monsters

01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:11.200
and bad guys, so when this happened,

01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:13.200
I don't know, it seemed a little weird.

01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:15.200
Like, is this particular show with

01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:17.200
the tone you've set so far really ready

01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:19.200
for something as serious as this?

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:21.200
I'm queen of the castle.

01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:23.200
I'm queen of the castle.

01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:25.200
Like, we're in the middle of this fairly light-hearted

01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:27.200
show, so light-hearted characters have

01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:29.200
a magic shield in fights so they can't get

01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:31.200
hurt too badly, and then in a classroom

01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:33.200
the comedy fast-talking coffee-drinking

01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:35.200
professor guy, voiced by

01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:37.200
the guy who plays Caboose in Red vs.

01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:39.200
Blue, starts to discuss the

01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:41.200
horrific tragedy of the mistreatment

01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:43.200
of the Faunus. Prior to the Faunus

01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:45.200
Rights Revolution, more popularly known as

01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:47.200
the Faunus War, they begin to explore

01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:49.200
the topic of racism by using

01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:51.200
the comedy silly-talky man.

01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:53.200
Now, have

01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:55.200
any among you been subjugated or

01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:57.200
discriminated because of your Faunus heritage?

01:50:57.200 --> 01:50:59.200
The issue of racism is a big part

01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:01.200
of the rest of the story, or at least it tries

01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:03.200
to be. A central component

01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:05.200
of the plot is the White Fang, a group

01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:07.200
of Faunus who do crimes and terrorism

01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:09.200
in the name of Faunus liberation. The White Fang

01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:11.200
are presented as antagonists in the

01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:13.200
story. They work with the bad man from volume

01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:15.200
one and do a bunch of crimes, including

01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:17.200
the train thing. A lot of the goons getting

01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:19.200
fought in fights in volumes one,

01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:21.200
two, three,

01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:23.200
four, and five are

01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:25.200
White Fang members. When the main characters

01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:27.200
aren't fighting Grimm, they're beating

01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:29.200
the shit out of in-universe minorities,

01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:31.200
but it's okay. You know they're bad because

01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:33.200
they all talk in the evil voice.

01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:35.200
Finally,

01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:37.200
I get to kill a shnee.

01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:39.200
Oh, I think he might be a bad

01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:41.200
guy. Once again, we're seeing the writing problems

01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:43.200
that made Jaune's character so terrible

01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:45.200
creeping in here. This argument between

01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:47.200
Weiss and Blake comes to a head because,

01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:49.200
at least initially, Weiss was written to be

01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:50.200
kind of racist.

01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:52.200
Hmm. The White Fang.

01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:54.200
What an awful bunch of degenerates.

01:51:54.200 --> 01:51:56.200
I don't particularly trust

01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:58.200
the Faunus. Her family profited

01:51:58.200 --> 01:52:00.200
from exploitative Faunus labor and maybe

01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:02.200
slavery, but it's hard to tell exactly what

01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:04.200
because the show is written badly. Infamous

01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:06.200
for its controversial labor forces.

01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:08.200
And she seems to take the opportunity to be shitty

01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:10.200
about Faunus when it presents itself.

01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:12.200
Stop calling him a degenerate. He's a person.

01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:14.200
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:16.200
Would you like me to stop referring to the trash

01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:18.200
can as a trash can?

01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:20.200
But at some point down the line, the writers were smart

01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:22.200
enough to see a problem with writing a main character

01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:24.200
with this flaw. Weiss being racist

01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:26.200
might affect the audience's ability

01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:28.200
to relate to the character, wouldn't it?

01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:30.200
The creators want the audience to like this lady

01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:32.200
as they go on adventures with her and watch her

01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:34.200
dote on pup boy Bebop.

01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:36.200
How many members of your audience are really gonna

01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:38.200
want to cosplay as the Weiss

01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:40.200
supremacist? So her beliefs about

01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:42.200
the Faunus are quietly dropped off

01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:44.200
screen and we are to assume she's

01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:46.200
anti-racist in future volumes.

01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:48.200
She just says, hey, whatever, we're a team.

01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:50.200
Let's work together now, and then in the next volume

01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:52.200
this side of her character is quietly

01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:54.200
forgotten. Knowing this show, I

01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:56.200
presume a man told her off screen not to be

01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:58.200
a racist anymore and she went, okay.

01:52:58.200 --> 01:53:00.200
In volume two she says she wants

01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:02.200
to become a Huntress specifically to try

01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:04.200
to do better than her family name has

01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:06.200
been in the past and she doesn't like what her

01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:08.200
father is doing, implicitly saying

01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:10.200
she became a fighter who protects the world

01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:12.200
because she wants to not be like her

01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:14.200
racist family. This is done instead

01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:16.200
of having her grapple with her

01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:18.200
prejudice towards a group of people and

01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:20.200
growing and changing and learning.

01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:22.200
You know, akin to what a story would

01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:24.200
do. They made her racist and then rewrote

01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:26.200
her to never have been racist.

01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:28.200
The writers are far too precious

01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:30.200
about their characters to permit them to have,

01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:32.200
like, flaws or lives

01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:34.200
or even personalities beyond

01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:36.200
cookie cutter heroics.

01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:38.200
They don't need to learn anything

01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:40.200
or grow, which makes them fundamentally

01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:42.200
uninteresting, and in the same way

01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:44.200
the writers are far too precious

01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:46.200
about their world itself. They want

01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:48.200
their world to not be so fundamentally

01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:50.200
flawed that a group like the White Fang is necessary.

01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:52.200
You see, the issue here is the White Fang

01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:54.200
are basically in the right. The Faunus

01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:56.200
are an oppressed people whose

01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:58.200
struggle for liberation and equality

01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:00.200
is immediately, the instant you

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:02.200
actually think about it, the morally

01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:04.200
correct side of the argument. Spoilers

01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:06.200
for real life, but we recently discovered

01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:08.200
in lab tests on mice that racism

01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:10.200
is wrong, but, like, if you have a movement

01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:12.200
whose purpose is to liberate an oppressed

01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:14.200
group, that means your society

01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:16.200
has some incredibly deep-set problems,

01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:18.200
right? People who need liberating

01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:20.200
from something? You know the Black Panthers

01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:22.200
didn't pop into existence because things

01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:24.200
were fine in the 60s, right?

01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:26.200
Oh, I really hate Hbomb's political videos,

01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:28.200
but I love his media stuff. It's way better.

01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:30.200
Ha! I tricked you! But Miles and

01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:32.200
Kerry realized at some point that

01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:34.200
if you introduce a group like this,

01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:36.200
then the main society of your story

01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:38.200
is a systemically racist one,

01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:40.200
and a huge portion of your main characters

01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:42.200
would be tacitly implicated in this

01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:44.200
by living in that society and not

01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:46.200
doing anything about the way those people are treated.

01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:48.200
Basically, they'd be writing a pretty grim

01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:50.200
story where almost everyone

01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:52.200
is on some level racist

01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:54.200
or at least okay with an unequal

01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:56.200
system because a lot of shit would need

01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:58.200
to change if there's a group like the White Fang

01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:00.200
running around and anyone sitting around

01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:02.200
enjoying the status quo instead of doing anything

01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:04.200
wouldn't be a heroic or positive

01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:06.200
character in this setting. In other words,

01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:08.200
you'd have a bit too much

01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:10.200
social commentary making everyone

01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:12.200
really uncomfortable about the parallels

01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:14.200
to real world history and in some places

01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:16.200
the real world present which would

01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:18.200
be an interesting story. I'd like a story

01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:20.200
like that really, but which would kind of suck

01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:22.200
the fun out of your anime cartoon about

01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:24.200
killing monsters with sci-fi rocket fists.

01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:26.200
People aren't gonna buy your boop

01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:28.200
t-shirts if they're sad about racism

01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:30.200
so the writer's objective was to make

01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:32.200
a show which explores racism

01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:34.200
but without making anyone too

01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:36.200
uncomfortable, without risking actually

01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:38.200
saying anything about our society,

01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:40.200
and without risking saying that the White Fang

01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:42.200
might have a point so everyone can have

01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:44.200
fun watching people beat them up because

01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:46.200
they're the bad guys. We wouldn't want any

01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:48.200
implications to think about. So,

01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:50.200
firstly, the mistreatment that appears in the story

01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:52.200
is always incredibly minor.

01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:54.200
It's established that the Faunus have already

01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:56.200
had a civil rights movement of sorts

01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:58.200
and been granted equality but just aren't

01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:00.200
really getting it yet in some places.

01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:02.200
Despite being promised equality, the Faunus

01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:04.200
were subjected to discrimination and hate.

01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:06.200
Some specific people are still

01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:08.200
kind of racist. Faunus get bullied

01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:10.200
by some people in school. There's a

01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:12.200
no Faunus sign on one bar.

01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:14.200
There's nothing wrong with the system anymore.

01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:16.200
Individual racists are the problem.

01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:18.200
Since we aren't living in a racist

01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:20.200
nightmare world, we can feel less bad

01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:22.200
about the status quo of the setting and more

01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:24.200
okay with the idea that the White Fang are bad.

01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:26.200
But even then, they still have a roughly

01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:28.200
sympathetic goal. If a shadowy

01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:30.200
group were blowing up the businesses

01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:32.200
of people who refuse to serve Faunus or

01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:34.200
attacking people with unethical Faunus

01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:36.200
labor practices, which I assume is what

01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:38.200
a controversial labor force is,

01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:40.200
half the people watching might not realize

01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:42.200
these are supposed to be the bad guys.

01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:44.200
You can't have a story where the liberation movement

01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:46.200
has a point because then you're writing a story

01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:48.200
that's slightly more complex than

01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:50.200
the help we need to stop the bad guys.

01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:52.200
And that's not fun.

01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:54.200
If you're writing a story for tiny babies,

01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:56.200
you want to be writing a generally okay world

01:56:56.200 --> 01:56:58.200
that's being threatened by evil outsiders.

01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:00.200
You know, like the monsters you could have

01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:02.200
already had be the main villains. So to add

01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:04.200
an extra level of moral simplification,

01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:06.200
they have the White Fang be recently under

01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:08.200
new leadership that are way more violent

01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:10.200
and pro-terrorism than normal.

01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:12.200
Five years ago, our leader stepped down

01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:14.200
and a new one took his place.

01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:16.200
A new leader with a new way of thinking.

01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:18.200
Okay, now they might have a point,

01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:20.200
but they're just going about it all wrong

01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:22.200
with this terrorism stuff.

01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:24.200
Now we can all get behind how they're the bad guys

01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:26.200
even if racism is wrong

01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:28.200
and they maybe have a point.

01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:30.200
Oh, I think she might be the bad guy,

01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:32.200
et cetera. You get the point.

01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:34.200
The story amounts to a long series

01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:36.200
of justifications for why the organization

01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:38.200
whose stated goal is the liberation

01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:40.200
of an oppressed people can be

01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:42.200
thought of as the antagonists.

01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:44.200
The White Fang used to be good guys,

01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:46.200
like agitating for progress in a nice way,

01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:48.200
politely asking for racism to end

01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:50.200
like good second-class citizens,

01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:52.200
but then a new leader stepped in

01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:54.200
who was more violent and aggressive,

01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:56.200
and now they're the bad guys and not respectable anymore.

01:57:56.200 --> 01:57:58.200
The problem is you're now effectively

01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:00.200
writing a story in which the most prominent

01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:02.200
villains are an oppressed people

01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:04.200
who are reacting wrong to being oppressed.

01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:06.200
Yeah, sure, racism is bad,

01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:08.200
but you're supposed to take it up with your congressman, guys.

01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:10.200
There's no nuance here.

01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:12.200
The White Fang are written to be as unequivocally

01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:14.200
in the wrong as possible.

01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:16.200
The main White Fang member we're shown is that guy

01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:18.200
who didn't care about killing innocent civilians

01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:20.200
with bombs and who later turns out

01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:22.200
to want to kill all humans

01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:25.200
because he sees his people as the superior race.

01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:27.200
The Faunus are the dominant species

01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:29.200
of this planet.

01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:31.200
Oh, also he wants to kill his ex-girlfriend

01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:33.200
for breaking up with him

01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:35.200
over the fact he's evil.

01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:37.200
♪♪

01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:39.200
The need to write an obvious villain

01:58:39.200 --> 01:58:41.200
into the story has burned away

01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:43.200
any relevance to the issues

01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:45.200
the show was supposedly trying to explore

01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:47.200
with this aspect of the story.

01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:49.200
I will make it my mission

01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:52.200
to destroy everything you love.

01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:54.200
What is the show trying to say?

01:58:54.200 --> 01:58:57.200
Racism is bad but don't kill civilians

01:58:57.200 --> 01:58:59.200
or your ex-girlfriend?

01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:00.200
Okay.

01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:02.200
If you want to talk about real world issues,

01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:04.200
you should actually do it

01:59:04.200 --> 01:59:06.200
and if you don't, you don't have to.

01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:09.200
You don't have to have a take on racism

01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:11.200
and you especially don't have one

01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:13.200
when you set your story in a fantasy world

01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:15.200
where racism is over and the real bad guy

01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:17.200
is a protest group that turned evil.

01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:19.200
I never wanted this.

01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:21.200
I wanted equality.

01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:23.200
So, hey, remember Velvet?

01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:25.200
That one character who seems like

01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:27.200
some members of the team intended to be

01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:29.200
more of a part of the story

01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:31.200
and then she just wasn't?

01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:33.200
It makes it just a little bit more egregious

01:59:33.200 --> 01:59:35.200
that the story is kind of about

01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:37.200
the persecution of her fucking race.

01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:39.200
Like, how do you fuck this up this badly?

01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:42.200
And for the record, that is not how human male teenagers

01:59:42.200 --> 01:59:44.200
would treat bunny girls if they were real.

01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:45.200
They would wait on them on hand and foot

01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:47.200
and beg them to step on me.

01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:49.200
Absolutely no one was holding a gun

01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:51.200
to Miles and Kerry's heads and saying

01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:53.200
to make the show about how they think Malcolm X

01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:55.200
could have toned it down a little.

01:59:55.200 --> 01:59:56.200
They did this by choice.

01:59:56.200 --> 01:59:58.200
They were given free reign to write a story

01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:00.200
and connect the dots on Monty's fights

02:00:00.200 --> 02:00:02.200
and this is what they made?

02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:04.200
Guys, I don't think you have as much to say

02:00:04.200 --> 02:00:06.200
on this topic as you initially thought.

02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:08.200
Instead of saying, oh, you know, the humans have a side.

02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:10.200
They should just respect us more.

02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:12.200
He turned into, yeah, let's get rid of the humans

02:00:12.200 --> 02:00:14.200
and then they'll respect us because they'll be dead.

02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:16.200
Let me just read that back to you

02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:18.200
just to make that more clear.

02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:20.200
He turned into, yeah,

02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:22.200
let's get rid of the humans

02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:24.200
and then they'll respect us

02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:26.200
because they'll be dead.

02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:28.200
Kerry,

02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:30.200
are you sure you want to go with this?

02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:32.200
There's also the problem of representation.

02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:34.200
I'm not gonna criticize the show's diversity

02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:36.200
or lack of it that much because I don't think

02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:38.200
that's really my criticism to make

02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:40.200
and I don't want to risk making it poorly on behalf of people

02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:42.200
who could say something better about it than me.

02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:44.200
There are doubtless plenty of people a whole lot

02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:46.200
less white than me who like the show

02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:48.200
and don't think it has a representation problem

02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:50.200
although that's not saying much.

02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:52.200
Most brands of literal cracker are browner than me.

02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:54.200
Oh, shit, my fucking laundry.

02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:56.200
Besides, I'm sure some people will tell you

02:00:56.200 --> 02:00:58.200
there's plenty of Black people in the first season.

02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:00.200
However, I can't help but notice

02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:02.200
that they have managed to write a show

02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:04.200
that tries, fails, but tries

02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:06.200
to deal with the impact of racism

02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:08.200
on a group of people in society but in such a way

02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:10.200
that they didn't have to have too many

02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:12.200
non-white characters.

02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:14.200
Instead, they invented a fictional race

02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:16.200
which consists almost entirely in the story

02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:18.200
of white women with cute animal ears

02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:20.200
and a cool buff white guy

02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:22.200
with a tail. This was a

02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:24.200
really clever decision.

02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:26.200
It turns out the way to get weebs to understand

02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:28.200
racism is to make the target a cat girl.

02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:30.200
The white fang are like the Black Panthers

02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:32.200
but with the emphasis on the panther.

02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:34.200
I mean, sure, regular racism

02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:36.200
is over in Remnant but here in the

02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:38.200
real world, if there were too many Black characters

02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:40.200
some of your audience members might

02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:42.200
start to smell politics.

02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:44.200
Now who will buy our boop shirts?

02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:46.200
Black lives matter, especially when they're

02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:48.200
white people with vague animal characteristics

02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:50.200
but, you know, we can't risk

02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:52.200
having too many people of color

02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:54.200
in our show about racism.

02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:56.200
By the way, you know this animated bit

02:01:56.200 --> 02:01:58.200
I showed you? That's Blake telling her backstory

02:01:58.200 --> 02:02:00.200
to Sun. Yes, Sun,

02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:02.200
another Faunus. She is telling the backstory

02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:04.200
of a movement Faunus are intimately aware

02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:06.200
of that Sun says he knows about

02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:08.200
Are you familiar with the white fang?

02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:10.200
Of course. I don't think there's a Faunus

02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:12.200
on the planet who hasn't heard of them.

02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:14.200
which describes the history of the treatment of Faunus

02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:16.200
to one of the only other Faunus

02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:18.200
in the story. Exposition, guys.

02:02:18.200 --> 02:02:20.200
Have her be telling this to someone who might

02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:22.200
not know it like any

02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:24.200
other character in the show.

02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:26.200
Have you told your friends any of this?

02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:28.200
Even Sun's asking why she's telling him.

02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:30.200
And what's up with all of these teens preparing

02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:32.200
elaborate speeches about their lives

02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:34.200
and the world? If you try and get away with a monologue

02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:36.200
that long in my household, your parents

02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:38.200
tell you you're a horrible son and they hate you.

02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:40.200
When you remove all of the

02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:42.200
moral and ethical dimensions from

02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:44.200
a story, the story disappears

02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:46.200
too. When it comes down to it,

02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:48.200
the white fang are a bunch of angry bad guys

02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:50.200
in masks and all this talk about how

02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:52.200
they're just reacting to mistreatment.

02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:54.200
But don't worry, guys. Things are fine.

02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:56.200
What they're reacting is boring

02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:58.200
window dressing on a story that's basically

02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:00.200
about how we have to stop the bad men

02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:02.200
from blowing up the city and stealing all

02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:04.200
of the precious jewels. The gang

02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:06.200
gleefully kill dozens of white fang

02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:08.200
members, throwing them off a train at high

02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:10.200
speed where their remains will be shattered

02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:12.200
and smashed into a pulp, unburied

02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:14.200
in a collapsing tunnel covered in

02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:16.200
monsters and explosives, and then later

02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:18.200
the only exit from this monster-infested

02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:20.200
tunnel is sealed shut, trapping

02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:22.200
any of the survivors inside to

02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:25.200
And sure, maybe they experienced racism

02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:27.200
and suffering, but they decided

02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:29.200
to be evil so they got what was coming.

02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:31.200
If you kill one of these guys, your conscience

02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:33.200
is clean. Oh, look, that one was black.

02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:35.200
Do you feel represented yet? I'm not saying

02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:37.200
you should have sympathy for these characters and that

02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:39.200
killing them is wrong. What I'm saying is

02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:41.200
it should be at least slightly more

02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:43.200
complicated than this, and the fact the story

02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:45.200
is written so that these characters are

02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:47.200
just evil is a massive flaw.

02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:49.200
It's like in the Dark Knight Rises.

02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:51.200
Bane basically has a

02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:53.200
point. Gotham is corrupt, and the

02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:55.200
people are oppressed by a system that seeks to profit

02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:57.200
from them and find new ways to spy

02:03:57.200 --> 02:03:59.200
on and criminalize them if they resist.

02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:01.200
The Occupy Wall Street movement had a lot to

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:03.200
say, and a lot of it was true.

02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:05.200
This is a stock exchange. There's no money you can steal.

02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:07.200
Really?

02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:09.200
Then why are you people here? But if you put

02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:11.200
that in your film, that means something's deeply

02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:13.200
wrong with your actual society,

02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:15.200
so Bane also wants to

02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:17.200
kill everyone with a nuke, so now

02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:19.200
when Batman beats the shit out of him and everyone

02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:21.200
who stands in his way, it's not because Batman

02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:23.200
is a tool of a corrupt establishment.

02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:25.200
It's because he's heroically stopping this definitely

02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:27.200
bad bad guy from killing

02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:29.200
everyone. The moral complexity of the story

02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:31.200
exists purely to sound cool

02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:33.200
and get thrown away before it gets anyone

02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:35.200
to think about the actual problems with our

02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:37.200
world. The Dark Knight Rises is

02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:39.200
complete bollocks because a villain who

02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:41.200
might have a point is consciously

02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:43.200
rewritten into a bad man in a

02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:45.200
mask with a big bomb who Batman

02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:47.200
needs to punch to win. Yay.

02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:49.200
Good guys hitting the bad guy.

02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:51.200
Don't think about Wall Street. The writers of RWBY

02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:53.200
want to look like they're talking about

02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:55.200
serious real world problems because that

02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:57.200
seems cool and clever and meaningful,

02:04:57.200 --> 02:04:59.200
but they don't want to run the risk of spoiling

02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:01.200
the cartoon fun, and they certainly don't want

02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:03.200
to risk the people in their audience who think talking

02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:05.200
about racism is for SJWs to stop

02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:07.200
watching, so we're left with generic

02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:09.200
masked bad guys who want to use a train

02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:11.200
to blow up a city and try

02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:13.200
to cut off one of our main character's

02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:15.200
heads with a chainsaw,

02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:17.200
but maybe some of them have sad backstories

02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:19.200
behind them being evil murderers

02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:21.200
who want to kill their ex-girlfriend?

02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:23.200
Oh, wow, how clever. No thanks.

02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:25.200
In the actual modern day right now,

02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:27.200
in fact, literally right now,

02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:29.200
there are people marching out there in the streets

02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:31.200
against systemic injustices,

02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:33.200
racism, and police brutality,

02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:35.200
and a not insignificant amount of people

02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:37.200
are dismissing all of this as opportunism,

02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:39.200
as looting, rioting,

02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:41.200
people trying to cause chaos and anarchy

02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:43.200
for no reason. When you tell a story

02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:45.200
with such a massive fixation on a group

02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:47.200
like this, what you're doing is saying

02:05:47.200 --> 02:05:49.200
that there are people in real life like this.

02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:51.200
Ruby is a deeply stupid

02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:53.200
person's idea of what

02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:55.200
racial politics are like. Watching this show

02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:57.200
through now, I can't help

02:05:57.200 --> 02:05:59.200
but be struck with the kind of horrible

02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:01.200
feeling that some people are gonna watch

02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:03.200
this and go, yeah, that's

02:06:03.200 --> 02:06:05.200
what they're like, and the idea

02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:07.200
of this show playing into people's

02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:09.200
worst instincts is frankly

02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:11.200
disgusting, but even on a basic story

02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:13.200
level, having such a simplistic faction

02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:15.200
like this driving so much of the plot

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:17.200
means that all their parts of the plot

02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:19.200
basically suck. The potential

02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:21.200
of this entire aspect of the story

02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:23.200
is seemingly purposefully declawed,

02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:25.200
rendering the whole thing as pointless

02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:27.200
as if it hadn't happened. The bad guys

02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:29.200
could have just been some evil, corrupted monsters

02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:31.200
who chose to be bad because they're

02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:33.200
bad for no reason, and the story

02:06:33.200 --> 02:06:35.200
would have been better because it would have been more honest

02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:37.200
and a lot less uncomfortable.

02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:39.200
The end point of this bottomless pit of

02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:41.200
compromises is, well,

02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:43.200
a compromised story. A story

02:06:43.200 --> 02:06:45.200
about nothing telling you very

02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:47.200
unconvincingly that it's about something

02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:49.200
actually important in our world

02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:51.200
right now. No wonder the introduction

02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:53.200
didn't mention them. They might as well

02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:55.200
not have been there.

02:06:57.200 --> 02:06:59.200
We can't really recount the history

02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:01.200
of RWBY without talking about the death of

02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:03.200
its creator, can we? After the end of volume

02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:05.200
two and while in early production

02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:07.200
on volume three, Monty Oum passed away

02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:09.200
very suddenly of an allergic

02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:11.200
reaction during routine surgery.

02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:13.200
Monty's death was a really tragic event

02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:15.200
that affected a lot of people, both

02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:17.200
at Rooster Teeth and in Monty's

02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:19.200
audience. Monty was well known as a

02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:21.200
relentlessly passionate worker, and a

02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:23.200
phrase commonly attributed to him by many,

02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:25.200
including his widow, was,

02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:27.200
so to carry on his passion,

02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:29.200
almost in tribute to his life,

02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:31.200
they continued making the show.

02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:33.200
I'm going to keep analyzing the show now,

02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:35.200
but as a fan of Monty's work since

02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:37.200
Haloid came out, I want to mention that

02:07:37.200 --> 02:07:39.200
I don't feel like I've had room to really celebrate

02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:41.200
his specific skill and talent in this

02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:43.200
video, so I'm working on another one just

02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:45.200
about that. I've been a fan of Monty's for

02:07:45.200 --> 02:07:47.200
most of my adult life, and I've wanted

02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:49.200
to gush about why his stuff is so great,

02:07:49.200 --> 02:07:51.200
but to make sure this video has any kind of

02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:53.200
decent pace, I've had to cut most of it out.

02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:55.200
I'll try and have that video done soon.

02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:57.200
So, volume three obviously

02:07:57.200 --> 02:07:59.200
struggles with a lot of issues. It's still got

02:07:59.200 --> 02:08:01.200
a lot of the things we've already discussed.

02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:03.200
It has the additional problem of the team having

02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:05.200
to make do without its original creator,

02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:07.200
but if anything, the biggest problem

02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:09.200
volume three has is that it gets good.

02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:11.200
Volume three opens on a big

02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:13.200
tournament between teams from all the

02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:15.200
anime warrior schools of the world.

02:08:15.200 --> 02:08:17.200
Every single anime out there eventually does

02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:19.200
their tournament arc, and, you know,

02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:21.200
we wanted RWBY to have its version of that.

02:08:21.200 --> 02:08:23.200
Because how better to prove

02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:25.200
that RWBY is just like an anime

02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:27.200
than to give it a tournament arc?

02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:29.200
I mean, a story would

02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:31.200
have been nice, but mid-fight, the announcers

02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:33.200
played by the professors from the first

02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:35.200
two seasons explain the entire tournament

02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:37.200
system. For those of you

02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:39.200
just now joining us, the show

02:08:39.200 --> 02:08:41.200
pauses to tell you how the entire

02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:43.200
system works. Again, exposition,

02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:45.200
guys. That's just not how you do it.

02:08:45.200 --> 02:08:47.200
If this is your first time watching,

02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:49.200
allow us to break down the rules.

02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:51.200
They're explaining this in the middle

02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:53.200
of the fight at the worst possible time

02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:55.200
to be explaining it. In fact, look at how

02:08:55.200 --> 02:08:57.200
even worse done this is when you realize

02:08:57.200 --> 02:08:59.200
it's being done diegetically. Imagine

02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:01.200
watching the tournament on TV when

02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:03.200
during a fight that is currently

02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:05.200
underway, the announcers interrupt

02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:07.200
to tell you how the tournament works.

02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:09.200
In case people who've never seen the tournament

02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:11.200
before just tuned in,

02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:13.200
there are infinite other ways of conveying

02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:15.200
this information to the audience, and they chose

02:09:15.200 --> 02:09:17.200
now in this incredibly clunky

02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:19.200
way?

02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:23.700
If you're just joining us, the objective of golf

02:09:23.700 --> 02:09:25.700
is to get the ball in the hole

02:09:25.700 --> 02:09:27.700
in as few strokes as possible.

02:09:27.700 --> 02:09:29.700
Points are tabulated by the amount of strokes

02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:31.700
under par, and remember, it's the lowest

02:09:31.700 --> 02:09:33.700
score that wins. Oh, it appears

02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:35.700
Jimmy has finished the course while I was

02:09:35.700 --> 02:09:37.700
talking. So the exposition is about as well

02:09:37.700 --> 02:09:39.700
done as it's always been. The fights also

02:09:39.700 --> 02:09:41.700
feel written now. Much more

02:09:41.700 --> 02:09:43.700
emphasis is placed on dialogue

02:09:43.700 --> 02:09:45.700
and specific moves than

02:09:45.700 --> 02:09:47.700
before, which slows things down

02:09:47.700 --> 02:09:49.700
and really messes with the pace. If you're

02:09:49.700 --> 02:09:51.700
just joining us, one of the big problems with the

02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:53.700
first two volumes was the constant influx

02:09:53.700 --> 02:09:55.700
of new characters who aren't on screen

02:09:55.700 --> 02:09:57.700
enough for you to learn anything interesting about them

02:09:57.700 --> 02:09:59.700
or care but manage to suck up enough

02:09:59.700 --> 02:10:01.700
screen time that the actual characters

02:10:01.700 --> 02:10:03.700
don't have room to breathe. Remember how

02:10:03.700 --> 02:10:05.700
Neptune's entire relevance to the story of the

02:10:05.700 --> 02:10:07.700
show was that Weiss wanted to go to the prom

02:10:07.700 --> 02:10:09.700
with him and how after that I never

02:10:09.700 --> 02:10:11.700
had to bring him up again? So all the

02:10:11.700 --> 02:10:13.700
screen time that went into him was a waste, wasn't

02:10:13.700 --> 02:10:15.700
it? The writers have noticed this problem

02:10:15.700 --> 02:10:17.700
and decided the solution is to add a hundred

02:10:17.700 --> 02:10:19.700
million more characters. Since it's the

02:10:19.700 --> 02:10:21.700
tournament arc now, just like in real

02:10:21.700 --> 02:10:23.700
animes, we get new teams to throw

02:10:23.700 --> 02:10:25.700
into the story for our other characters we

02:10:25.700 --> 02:10:27.700
kinda know to fight against, and

02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:29.700
you know exactly which ones you won't

02:10:29.700 --> 02:10:31.700
see in fights because they're just 2D

02:10:31.700 --> 02:10:33.700
concept art. But that's not all!

02:10:33.700 --> 02:10:35.700
We also have more characters who

02:10:35.700 --> 02:10:37.700
are just here now.

02:10:37.700 --> 02:10:39.700
Winter Schnee, Weiss' sister,

02:10:39.700 --> 02:10:41.700
is here to not do much of anything

02:10:41.700 --> 02:10:43.700
and just kinda turn up for a couple

02:10:43.700 --> 02:10:45.700
episodes to give Weiss a pep talk

02:10:45.700 --> 02:10:47.700
and explain for the benefit of the audience

02:10:47.700 --> 02:10:49.700
how their semblance works. To Weiss,

02:10:49.700 --> 02:10:51.700
the only other person who already

02:10:51.700 --> 02:10:53.700
knows how it fucking works!

02:10:53.700 --> 02:10:55.700
Oh, and also to have a pointless fight with Crow,

02:10:55.700 --> 02:10:57.700
another character who has finally turned

02:10:57.700 --> 02:10:59.700
up after getting name-dropped a bunch

02:10:59.700 --> 02:11:01.700
in previous seasons. Here's a thing you probably

02:11:01.700 --> 02:11:03.700
noticed by now, but every character is usually

02:11:03.700 --> 02:11:05.700
named for a fairy tale character of some kind

02:11:05.700 --> 02:11:07.700
like Ruby is Red Riding Hood, Nora

02:11:07.700 --> 02:11:09.700
is Thor, Jean Arc is Joan

02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:11.700
of Arc, Blake is fucking

02:11:11.700 --> 02:11:13.700
bad, and Crow, Glinda,

02:11:13.700 --> 02:11:15.700
Ozpin, the General, and some others

02:11:15.700 --> 02:11:17.700
are based vaguely after characters from

02:11:17.700 --> 02:11:19.700
the Wizard of Oz. Anyway, the gimmick is wearing

02:11:19.700 --> 02:11:21.700
so thin now that they're really

02:11:21.700 --> 02:11:23.700
struggling to come up with characters that fit

02:11:23.700 --> 02:11:25.700
this scheme. In one of the fights, Yang and Weiss

02:11:25.700 --> 02:11:27.700
fight against Neon Cat,

02:11:27.700 --> 02:11:29.700
a Faunus character inspired by

02:11:29.700 --> 02:11:31.700
Nyan Cat, and Flint Coal, the son

02:11:31.700 --> 02:11:33.700
of a dust store owner who Weiss' family

02:11:33.700 --> 02:11:35.700
wait, Flint Coal?

02:11:35.700 --> 02:11:37.700
This is like the second black

02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:39.700
character in the show and his name is

02:11:39.700 --> 02:11:41.700
Flint Coal!

02:11:41.700 --> 02:11:43.700
Oh, no! Okay, so

02:11:43.700 --> 02:11:45.700
it's not as bad as it sounds. It's actually

02:11:45.700 --> 02:11:47.700
a clever, clever reference

02:11:47.700 --> 02:11:49.700
to Rooster Teeth's Minecraft

02:11:49.700 --> 02:11:50.700
Let's Play.

02:11:50.700 --> 02:11:52.700
Dude, I got Coal and Flint?

02:11:52.700 --> 02:11:54.700
Oh, you're set. That'd be a cool name.

02:11:54.700 --> 02:11:56.700
Flint Coal. Would it though? Yeah, you'd be like

02:11:56.700 --> 02:11:58.700
a, like an international private investigator

02:11:58.700 --> 02:12:00.700
mystery type. You'd have to be black though, right?

02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:01.700
I dig it.

02:12:01.700 --> 02:12:03.700
What's his weapon called anyway?

02:12:03.700 --> 02:12:05.700
You see, all the characters' weapons have names.

02:12:05.700 --> 02:12:07.700
They get mentioned in behind-the-scenes material

02:12:07.700 --> 02:12:09.700
or named in the show. Crescent Rose.

02:12:09.700 --> 02:12:11.700
One of the most... Mertonaster.

02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:13.700
Gambol! Shrow?

02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:15.700
But Flint Coal. Flint

02:12:15.700 --> 02:12:17.700
Coal doesn't appear in

02:12:17.700 --> 02:12:19.700
many other RWBY materials, so

02:12:19.700 --> 02:12:21.700
we've not had an opportunity to learn his

02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:23.700
weapon's name, so the RWBY wiki

02:12:23.700 --> 02:12:25.700
has had no choice but

02:12:25.700 --> 02:12:27.700
to list it as

02:12:27.700 --> 02:12:29.700
Weapon Trumpet!

02:12:29.700 --> 02:12:31.700
Ha ha ha ha!

02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:33.700
Ha ha ha ha!

02:12:33.700 --> 02:12:35.700
But the thing about season three is that it

02:12:35.700 --> 02:12:37.700
gets good. Midway through this volume,

02:12:37.700 --> 02:12:39.700
the plot of RWBY

02:12:39.700 --> 02:12:41.700
starts. The main characters take

02:12:41.700 --> 02:12:43.700
Pyrrha aside and say, hey, so what's actually

02:12:43.700 --> 02:12:45.700
happening here is there are four maidens?

02:12:45.700 --> 02:12:47.700
Women with incredible magical

02:12:47.700 --> 02:12:49.700
powers. Not like semblances or dust.

02:12:49.700 --> 02:12:51.700
They're not magic. This is real magic.

02:12:51.700 --> 02:12:53.700
Each time a maiden dies, someone else inherits

02:12:53.700 --> 02:12:55.700
the maiden's power. Oh, so it's just

02:12:55.700 --> 02:12:57.700
Avatar again? Really? Okay.

02:12:57.700 --> 02:12:59.700
Each of the maidens represents one of the

02:12:59.700 --> 02:13:01.700
four seasons. It's the four seasons,

02:13:01.700 --> 02:13:03.700
not the four elements, so it's not like Avatar.

02:13:03.700 --> 02:13:05.700
Oh, hang on. There's four different elements

02:13:05.700 --> 02:13:07.700
of dust, aren't there? Wow, it's Avatar all the

02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:09.700
way down, isn't it? It's really boring,

02:13:09.700 --> 02:13:11.700
and the rules of who gets to be a maiden and why

02:13:11.700 --> 02:13:13.700
are really silly, and the exposition of it

02:13:13.700 --> 02:13:15.700
is bad, but it's not that bad because

02:13:15.700 --> 02:13:17.700
the show has now introduced Crow.

02:13:17.700 --> 02:13:19.700
How does the power choose?

02:13:19.700 --> 02:13:21.700
Through a series of stupid and

02:13:21.700 --> 02:13:23.700
convoluted rules. The writers made

02:13:23.700 --> 02:13:25.700
the genuinely clever decision to have

02:13:25.700 --> 02:13:27.700
him annoyed and bored by

02:13:27.700 --> 02:13:29.700
most of the characters and plot of RWBY.

02:13:29.700 --> 02:13:31.700
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?

02:13:31.700 --> 02:13:33.700
No.

02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:35.700
Crow spends half the show ridiculing

02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:37.700
all the characters that have been taking themselves

02:13:37.700 --> 02:13:39.700
seriously for hours with no one questioning

02:13:39.700 --> 02:13:41.700
them before. If you were one of my men,

02:13:41.700 --> 02:13:43.700
I would have you shot. If I was one of

02:13:43.700 --> 02:13:45.700
your men, I'd shoot myself.

02:13:45.700 --> 02:13:47.700
So even if you aren't really enjoying

02:13:47.700 --> 02:13:49.700
the story or the ridiculous amount of plot

02:13:49.700 --> 02:13:51.700
being dumped in your lap regarding

02:13:51.700 --> 02:13:53.700
the maidens and Cinder, the real

02:13:53.700 --> 02:13:55.700
villain of the last two seasons who hasn't done

02:13:55.700 --> 02:13:57.700
much, who it turns out actually has

02:13:57.700 --> 02:13:59.700
stolen half of a maiden's power and

02:13:59.700 --> 02:14:01.700
might inherit the other half if the maiden dies,

02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:03.700
it's not so bad because another

02:14:03.700 --> 02:14:05.700
character in the scene isn't enjoying

02:14:05.700 --> 02:14:07.700
it either. It's ironic that everyone else

02:14:07.700 --> 02:14:09.700
is birdbrained. So it turns out

02:14:09.700 --> 02:14:11.700
that the story's really always been about

02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:13.700
these four maidens, each representing

02:14:13.700 --> 02:14:15.700
one of the four seasons and Cinder

02:14:15.700 --> 02:14:17.700
wanting to cause enough commotion that

02:14:17.700 --> 02:14:19.700
she can get to the fall maiden and kill

02:14:19.700 --> 02:14:21.700
her to ensure she gets her power.

02:14:21.700 --> 02:14:23.700
There's some pretty genuine drama now as Pyrrha

02:14:23.700 --> 02:14:25.700
is offered the choice to take the maiden's soul

02:14:25.700 --> 02:14:27.700
into her body, a process which will probably

02:14:27.700 --> 02:14:29.700
kill her but prevent the power falling

02:14:29.700 --> 02:14:31.700
into the wrong hands. A character has to choose

02:14:31.700 --> 02:14:33.700
between having her own life and

02:14:33.700 --> 02:14:35.700
doing what might be the right thing for

02:14:35.700 --> 02:14:37.700
the world. Pyrrha is actually given

02:14:37.700 --> 02:14:39.700
an identity and questions

02:14:39.700 --> 02:14:41.700
and important choices to explore

02:14:41.700 --> 02:14:43.700
outside of her relationship to Jaune

02:14:43.700 --> 02:14:45.700
and it makes her the strongest character

02:14:45.700 --> 02:14:47.700
in the show. It makes it easier to ignore

02:14:47.700 --> 02:14:49.700
that the plot is basically yet another avatar

02:14:49.700 --> 02:14:51.700
thing. There being people with magical

02:14:51.700 --> 02:14:53.700
powers whose abilities go to someone else

02:14:53.700 --> 02:14:55.700
when they die is very avatar

02:14:55.700 --> 02:14:57.700
adjacent, but you don't even think about it

02:14:57.700 --> 02:14:59.700
because the exposition gets made fun of by

02:14:59.700 --> 02:15:01.700
one character and another character has to make

02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:03.700
a real choice about it, so it actually

02:15:03.700 --> 02:15:05.700
works. One of Cinder's goons,

02:15:05.700 --> 02:15:07.700
Emerald, has the power to make people hallucinate

02:15:07.700 --> 02:15:09.700
and makes Yang think her guy's attacking

02:15:09.700 --> 02:15:11.700
her after a round has ended, and while

02:15:11.700 --> 02:15:13.700
she thinks she's defending herself, the rest of the world

02:15:13.700 --> 02:15:15.700
sees what's actually happening, which is Yang

02:15:15.700 --> 02:15:17.700
breaking a guy's fucking leg

02:15:17.700 --> 02:15:19.700
for no reason. Don't worry. He's a villain

02:15:19.700 --> 02:15:21.700
and he's in on it and he has robot legs,

02:15:21.700 --> 02:15:23.700
so it's fine, but no one knows he has robot legs

02:15:23.700 --> 02:15:25.700
so this causes a lot of unrest among

02:15:25.700 --> 02:15:27.700
the people watching and everyone seeing it on TV

02:15:27.700 --> 02:15:29.700
and fear and anxiety attract

02:15:29.700 --> 02:15:31.700
Grimm, so they all start ominously moving

02:15:31.700 --> 02:15:33.700
toward the city and Yang's freaking

02:15:33.700 --> 02:15:35.700
the fuck out because she thinks she's losing her

02:15:35.700 --> 02:15:37.700
mind and everyone's mad at her. It's like

02:15:37.700 --> 02:15:39.700
plot! There's plot happening, guys!

02:15:39.700 --> 02:15:41.700
Everybody, wake up! The characters

02:15:41.700 --> 02:15:43.700
finally have to do something!

02:15:43.700 --> 02:15:45.700
Then, right after, while Pyrrha and Penny

02:15:45.700 --> 02:15:47.700
are fighting in the tournament, Emerald makes Pyrrha

02:15:47.700 --> 02:15:49.700
see way worse attacks coming, which

02:15:49.700 --> 02:15:51.700
causes her to really push her power

02:15:51.700 --> 02:15:53.700
and the tiny wires all Penny's weapons

02:15:53.700 --> 02:15:55.700
are attached to wrap around Penny

02:15:55.700 --> 02:15:57.700
and Penny, the character we've known

02:15:57.700 --> 02:15:59.700
for a whole season plus, like, five seconds

02:15:59.700 --> 02:16:01.700
at the end of volume one, is torn

02:16:01.700 --> 02:16:03.700
to pieces. I mean,

02:16:03.700 --> 02:16:05.700
holy shit! She's a robot

02:16:05.700 --> 02:16:07.700
so it's not like a disembowelment

02:16:07.700 --> 02:16:09.700
but this was a character and she's

02:16:09.700 --> 02:16:11.700
dead. It's fucked up.

02:16:11.700 --> 02:16:13.700
Everyone goes wild.

02:16:13.700 --> 02:16:15.700
Cinder hacks the main frame

02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:17.700
and gives a speech about humans

02:16:17.700 --> 02:16:19.700
bad and a million billion Grimm

02:16:19.700 --> 02:16:21.700
descend on the city and school

02:16:21.700 --> 02:16:23.700
and the last hour of volume three starts

02:16:23.700 --> 02:16:25.700
with a fucking bang. Everything

02:16:25.700 --> 02:16:27.700
bad is happening to everyone

02:16:27.700 --> 02:16:29.700
everywhere all the time. A main character

02:16:29.700 --> 02:16:31.700
is fucking dead in pieces.

02:16:31.700 --> 02:16:33.700
People are crying. This isn't your daddy's

02:16:33.700 --> 02:16:35.700
generic and then bad guys attack the

02:16:35.700 --> 02:16:37.700
city. This isn't volume two shit.

02:16:37.700 --> 02:16:39.700
The city is being destroyed.

02:16:39.700 --> 02:16:41.700
Caligula gets broken out of the prison

02:16:41.700 --> 02:16:43.700
he was locked in at the end of season two and

02:16:43.700 --> 02:16:45.700
starts hacking the army robots and blowing

02:16:45.700 --> 02:16:47.700
ships out of the sky. Everything's

02:16:47.700 --> 02:16:49.700
happening. Everyone's fucked.

02:16:49.700 --> 02:16:51.700
Bring them to their knees.

02:16:51.700 --> 02:16:53.700
The civil rights protesters still talk

02:16:53.700 --> 02:16:55.700
like they're fucking evil but, I mean, generally

02:16:55.700 --> 02:16:57.700
it's pretty good. Ruby's threatening a giant

02:16:57.700 --> 02:16:59.700
bird with one of Penny's swords because she's

02:16:59.700 --> 02:17:01.700
too distraught to think straight and

02:17:01.700 --> 02:17:03.700
then it flies at her and everyone's

02:17:03.700 --> 02:17:05.700
lockers ram into it and pin it to the ground

02:17:05.700 --> 02:17:07.700
and everyone we've seen so far turns up

02:17:07.700 --> 02:17:09.700
to fight. Look, even Weapon Trumpet

02:17:09.700 --> 02:17:11.700
is here. This absolutely incredible

02:17:11.700 --> 02:17:13.700
shot was done by Dylan Gu. It's

02:17:13.700 --> 02:17:15.700
my favorite shot in the show. Just

02:17:15.700 --> 02:17:17.700
narrowly edging out the Zwei attack

02:17:17.700 --> 02:17:19.700
and there's great setup and payoff to it because

02:17:19.700 --> 02:17:21.700
we've known since volume one that characters

02:17:21.700 --> 02:17:23.700
can call their lockers to them to get their

02:17:23.700 --> 02:17:25.700
weapon out whenever they want it. So having them be

02:17:25.700 --> 02:17:27.700
used as weapons and just smash into this

02:17:27.700 --> 02:17:29.700
thing all at once, it's just so great.

02:17:29.700 --> 02:17:31.700
So everyone's fighting monsters. There's some

02:17:31.700 --> 02:17:33.700
great action. Ruby fights, uh,

02:17:33.700 --> 02:17:35.700
check Malcolm McDowell's IMDb

02:17:35.700 --> 02:17:37.700
for another comical name.

02:17:37.700 --> 02:17:39.700
The real world is

02:17:39.700 --> 02:17:41.700
cold! And he's kicking her and giving

02:17:41.700 --> 02:17:43.700
a speech about the world being a cruel, cold

02:17:43.700 --> 02:17:45.700
place. As for me,

02:17:45.700 --> 02:17:47.700
I'll do what I do best.

02:17:47.700 --> 02:17:49.700
Survive!

02:17:49.700 --> 02:17:51.700
And he's fucking dead.

02:17:51.700 --> 02:17:53.700
They just killed him! He's dead! I mean, holy

02:17:53.700 --> 02:17:55.700
shit, right? They're destroying the main

02:17:55.700 --> 02:17:57.700
setting of the story so far and

02:17:57.700 --> 02:17:59.700
killing off villains in the process.

02:17:59.700 --> 02:18:01.700
It's great! For a few short

02:18:01.700 --> 02:18:03.700
episodes, the show isn't like Avatar

02:18:03.700 --> 02:18:05.700
or anything else on its homework list.

02:18:05.700 --> 02:18:07.700
You're briefly glimpsing what it looks like

02:18:07.700 --> 02:18:09.700
when it's trying to be itself

02:18:09.700 --> 02:18:11.700
when it's being Ruby.

02:18:11.700 --> 02:18:13.700
You know this is why the rest of the show

02:18:13.700 --> 02:18:15.700
is so frustrating, right? Because every now and

02:18:15.700 --> 02:18:17.700
then something like this happens and you

02:18:17.700 --> 02:18:19.700
wanna see the show this stuff came from.

02:18:19.700 --> 02:18:21.700
Ruby opens Neo's umbrella and the wind

02:18:21.700 --> 02:18:23.700
fucking blows her off the ship

02:18:23.700 --> 02:18:25.700
they're flying on hundreds of feet in the air.

02:18:25.700 --> 02:18:27.700
She's dead! She's fucking

02:18:27.700 --> 02:18:29.700
dead! Until people start to get bored

02:18:29.700 --> 02:18:31.700
with the show and realize that most of

02:18:31.700 --> 02:18:33.700
the new characters are really boring. Maybe you

02:18:33.700 --> 02:18:35.700
weren't supposed to assume the fall was gonna

02:18:35.700 --> 02:18:37.700
kill her, but she doesn't appear for like

02:18:37.700 --> 02:18:39.700
three more seasons after this.

02:18:39.700 --> 02:18:41.700
So either the writers had intended to kill

02:18:41.700 --> 02:18:43.700
her and then changed her minds because they wanted the character

02:18:43.700 --> 02:18:45.700
back or they just forgot she existed for

02:18:45.700 --> 02:18:47.700
literally fucking years.

02:18:47.700 --> 02:18:49.700
Blake gets attacked and stabbed

02:18:49.700 --> 02:18:51.700
by Adam and he shares his incredibly good

02:18:51.700 --> 02:18:53.700
motivation for his actions. Uh,

02:18:53.700 --> 02:18:55.700
I'm bad and I'm going to kill you

02:18:55.700 --> 02:18:57.700
and Yang tries to help but Adam cuts

02:18:57.700 --> 02:18:59.700
her arm off. This moment is still so

02:18:59.700 --> 02:19:01.700
dramatic and visually done so

02:19:01.700 --> 02:19:03.700
well. They fake out for a second that

02:19:03.700 --> 02:19:05.700
Blake's head gets cut off but actually

02:19:05.700 --> 02:19:07.700
it was one of these illusions and she gets away

02:19:07.700 --> 02:19:09.700
but what's amazing about this part of this show

02:19:09.700 --> 02:19:11.700
is that for a second I believed

02:19:11.700 --> 02:19:13.700
that they might, they just might

02:19:13.700 --> 02:19:15.700
actually kill one of the four

02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:17.700
main characters. Like, if that's not proof

02:19:17.700 --> 02:19:19.700
that this show is onto something story-wise

02:19:19.700 --> 02:19:21.700
for a hot minute, I don't know what is. Seeing

02:19:21.700 --> 02:19:23.700
Pyrrha trying to do the right thing while

02:19:23.700 --> 02:19:25.700
living with the fact she just accidentally

02:19:25.700 --> 02:19:27.700
killed one of her friends and seeing that

02:19:27.700 --> 02:19:29.700
affect her thinking is actually

02:19:29.700 --> 02:19:31.700
incredible and from a character perspective

02:19:31.700 --> 02:19:33.700
it's the best stuff you'll ever see in this show.

02:19:33.700 --> 02:19:35.700
It would have been really helped if Pyrrha

02:19:35.700 --> 02:19:37.700
and Penny had actually been friends

02:19:37.700 --> 02:19:39.700
or like on screen together

02:19:39.700 --> 02:19:41.700
basically at all before the fight

02:19:41.700 --> 02:19:42.700
where Penny dies.

02:19:42.700 --> 02:19:44.700
It's an honor to finally meet you.

02:19:44.700 --> 02:19:46.700
Like, at this point it's actively offensive

02:19:46.700 --> 02:19:48.700
like how poorly spent

02:19:48.700 --> 02:19:50.700
the time leading up to this fight is

02:19:50.700 --> 02:19:52.700
and just how much better it could have been.

02:19:52.700 --> 02:19:54.700
If they'd, like, given these characters a relationship

02:19:54.700 --> 02:19:56.700
before one of them killed the other

02:19:56.700 --> 02:19:58.700
like wouldn't that have been meaningful?

02:19:58.700 --> 02:20:00.700
Salutations, Pyrrha Nekos.

02:20:00.700 --> 02:20:03.700
Do you remember when she said salutations?

02:20:03.700 --> 02:20:04.700
Do you remember?

02:20:04.700 --> 02:20:06.700
Pyrrha decides to let herself become

02:20:06.700 --> 02:20:08.700
the vessel for the previous maiden but they're

02:20:08.700 --> 02:20:10.700
too late and Cinder kills the maiden

02:20:10.700 --> 02:20:12.700
and then Pyrrha shoves Miles into his locker

02:20:12.700 --> 02:20:13.700
where he belonged.

02:20:13.700 --> 02:20:14.700
I mean, Pyrrha sends Jaune away

02:20:14.700 --> 02:20:16.700
against his will so he can survive

02:20:16.700 --> 02:20:18.700
but not before fully confessing her feelings

02:20:18.700 --> 02:20:20.700
and kissing him and tries to take Cinder on

02:20:20.700 --> 02:20:22.700
but she fails and gets shot in the heart

02:20:22.700 --> 02:20:23.700
by an arrow.

02:20:23.700 --> 02:20:25.700
Ruby turns up just too late to save her

02:20:25.700 --> 02:20:27.700
and watches as Cinder dissolves

02:20:27.700 --> 02:20:29.700
Pyrrha's body into nothing.

02:20:29.700 --> 02:20:31.700
Jesus fucking Christ!

02:20:31.700 --> 02:20:33.700
They are not messing around pretending this is a show

02:20:33.700 --> 02:20:34.700
for kids anymore, are they?

02:20:34.700 --> 02:20:35.700
And then Ruby goes,

02:20:35.700 --> 02:20:36.700
"[screams in pain"]

02:20:36.700 --> 02:20:38.700
and turns out to have a magic power

02:20:38.700 --> 02:20:40.700
because she has silver eyes and this means

02:20:40.700 --> 02:20:42.700
she can instantly kill Grimm or something.

02:20:42.700 --> 02:20:43.700
I don't know.

02:20:43.700 --> 02:20:45.700
You learn about this power existing right now

02:20:45.700 --> 02:20:46.700
seven hours into the show.

02:20:46.700 --> 02:20:47.700
It's not great,

02:20:47.700 --> 02:20:49.700
but we've already talked about how weird that is.

02:20:49.700 --> 02:20:51.700
On the whole, the absolute chaos

02:20:51.700 --> 02:20:53.700
and world-changing events and the treatment

02:20:53.700 --> 02:20:55.700
of characters and emotionally interesting

02:20:55.700 --> 02:20:57.700
story moves that take place in the last

02:20:57.700 --> 02:20:59.700
four-and-a-bit episodes of volume three

02:20:59.700 --> 02:21:02.700
make it briefly a great show, pure and simple,

02:21:02.700 --> 02:21:04.700
and this is a weird place to end a video

02:21:04.700 --> 02:21:06.700
about the problems with a show

02:21:06.700 --> 02:21:08.700
by talking about how good it was for a while

02:21:08.700 --> 02:21:10.700
and how promisingly it left its doors open,

02:21:10.700 --> 02:21:13.700
but this is really why talking about Ruby

02:21:13.700 --> 02:21:15.700
is so artistically interesting because it's always

02:21:15.700 --> 02:21:17.700
on the cusp of being good like this,

02:21:17.700 --> 02:21:19.700
and sometimes it really is,

02:21:19.700 --> 02:21:22.700
but that's also why the show is such a disappointment.

02:21:22.700 --> 02:21:24.700
That part of season three damns

02:21:24.700 --> 02:21:26.700
the rest of the surrounding show even more

02:21:26.700 --> 02:21:28.700
by telling you to have expectations

02:21:28.700 --> 02:21:30.700
because for a second,

02:21:30.700 --> 02:21:32.700
you can see how good it really could be.

02:21:32.700 --> 02:21:34.700
The show hasn't got good exactly.

02:21:34.700 --> 02:21:36.700
It's just had a really good time

02:21:36.700 --> 02:21:39.700
making serious changes to the status quo of the story,

02:21:39.700 --> 02:21:42.700
but you can't sustain a story on Red Weddings alone.

02:21:42.700 --> 02:21:45.700
The new story beginning with volume four onwards

02:21:45.700 --> 02:21:48.700
has to actually be good for this to all work out,

02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:51.700
and ultimately, it doesn't.

02:21:51.700 --> 02:21:53.700
To really explore the more specific problems

02:21:53.700 --> 02:21:56.700
with volumes four onwards, we'd need a whole other video.

02:21:56.700 --> 02:21:58.700
I wanted to talk in specific about the first three seasons

02:21:58.700 --> 02:22:01.700
because they stand out as the time the show seemed

02:22:01.700 --> 02:22:03.700
most likely to be going somewhere

02:22:03.700 --> 02:22:05.700
and therefore feel particularly bad

02:22:05.700 --> 02:22:07.700
when they only do it for such brief bursts

02:22:07.700 --> 02:22:10.700
in Monty's fights, in the promising storylines

02:22:10.700 --> 02:22:12.700
or character moments that get forgotten or dropped,

02:22:12.700 --> 02:22:14.700
and in the way they really satisfyingly

02:22:14.700 --> 02:22:16.700
did things with Pyrrha's character,

02:22:16.700 --> 02:22:18.700
but now that character is gone,

02:22:18.700 --> 02:22:20.700
so the show's back to having dozens of characters

02:22:20.700 --> 02:22:24.700
with barely one interesting personality between them.

02:22:24.700 --> 02:22:27.700
The good parts of the show really can be great,

02:22:27.700 --> 02:22:29.700
and because of this, all the bad parts

02:22:29.700 --> 02:22:31.700
are worse than bad.

02:22:31.700 --> 02:22:34.700
They're also a shame.

02:22:36.700 --> 02:22:41.700
♪

02:22:41.700 --> 02:22:44.700
Creating art is like jumping off a cliff

02:22:44.700 --> 02:22:46.700
and building your wings on the way down.

02:22:46.700 --> 02:22:48.700
If you want to only start when you know

02:22:48.700 --> 02:22:50.700
exactly how to get everything right,

02:22:50.700 --> 02:22:52.700
you never actually will.

02:22:52.700 --> 02:22:54.700
You never really know what you're doing

02:22:54.700 --> 02:22:56.700
until after you've started doing it.

02:22:56.700 --> 02:22:59.700
In the past couple of years of this weird life,

02:22:59.700 --> 02:23:01.700
I've met quite a few people who knew Monty,

02:23:01.700 --> 02:23:04.700
and several of them have told me the same story.

02:23:04.700 --> 02:23:06.700
He'd say that he felt like the first season,

02:23:06.700 --> 02:23:08.700
first season and a half, first two seasons,

02:23:08.700 --> 02:23:10.700
based on who was telling it,

02:23:10.700 --> 02:23:12.700
weren't turning out super great so far,

02:23:12.700 --> 02:23:14.700
but it didn't matter if it was bad right now

02:23:14.700 --> 02:23:16.700
because in his mind, the whole thing,

02:23:16.700 --> 02:23:18.700
the act of creation itself even,

02:23:18.700 --> 02:23:20.700
was a process of learning.

02:23:20.700 --> 02:23:23.700
If you can really figure out how to make something,

02:23:23.700 --> 02:23:25.700
really get the production and workflow down,

02:23:25.700 --> 02:23:27.700
figure out what works in the writing,

02:23:27.700 --> 02:23:29.700
and through this process find the core

02:23:29.700 --> 02:23:31.700
of what this thing you're making is really supposed to be,

02:23:31.700 --> 02:23:33.700
it won't matter how bad it started out

02:23:33.700 --> 02:23:35.700
because where it went will be great.

02:23:35.700 --> 02:23:37.700
There's a certain manic energy,

02:23:37.700 --> 02:23:40.700
a compelling power in these early seasons of RWBY.

02:23:40.700 --> 02:23:42.700
Even if you're having a bad time,

02:23:42.700 --> 02:23:44.700
you feel pulled along, like you just wanna see

02:23:44.700 --> 02:23:45.700
how it ends up.

02:23:45.700 --> 02:23:47.700
This tone will change.

02:23:47.700 --> 02:23:49.700
As the show continues to be written and paced

02:23:49.700 --> 02:23:51.700
in frustrating ways and cheat off the answers

02:23:51.700 --> 02:23:54.700
on its anime homework and its most interesting,

02:23:54.700 --> 02:23:57.700
unique aspects are continuously downplayed or ignored,

02:23:57.700 --> 02:23:59.700
it becomes more and more clear

02:23:59.700 --> 02:24:01.700
that you'll never see the show become itself.

02:24:01.700 --> 02:24:03.700
I didn't watch Monty Oum's RWBY

02:24:03.700 --> 02:24:05.700
to see Miles Luna's avatar,

02:24:05.700 --> 02:24:07.700
but that's what people are getting.

02:24:07.700 --> 02:24:09.700
If the creators of RWBY had started learning

02:24:09.700 --> 02:24:11.700
from their mistakes and taken to heart

02:24:11.700 --> 02:24:13.700
the good faith criticisms the people

02:24:13.700 --> 02:24:16.700
who wanted to love their show were making,

02:24:16.700 --> 02:24:18.700
RWBY could have really been something,

02:24:18.700 --> 02:24:21.700
but instead it'll be remembered by a majority of people

02:24:21.700 --> 02:24:23.700
as a series of really good trailers

02:24:23.700 --> 02:24:25.700
with some really strange dialogue,

02:24:25.700 --> 02:24:27.700
some really cool fight scenes to watch

02:24:27.700 --> 02:24:29.700
out of context on YouTube,

02:24:29.700 --> 02:24:31.700
and inexplicably quite good episodes

02:24:31.700 --> 02:24:33.700
at the end of the third season.

02:24:33.700 --> 02:24:36.700
The real shame of RWBY is everyone whose work goes unsung

02:24:36.700 --> 02:24:38.700
because it's in a show that sucks.

02:24:38.700 --> 02:24:40.700
People like Shane Neuville who left the show

02:24:40.700 --> 02:24:42.700
and released a massive open letter

02:24:42.700 --> 02:24:44.700
detailing his feelings about the company's treatment

02:24:44.700 --> 02:24:46.700
of the show after Monty's passing,

02:24:46.700 --> 02:24:48.700
or Harley Dwartz who contributes a lot

02:24:48.700 --> 02:24:50.700
to making some of the best parts of the show,

02:24:50.700 --> 02:24:52.700
or the many other animators and artists

02:24:52.700 --> 02:24:54.700
who are still to this day putting time

02:24:54.700 --> 02:24:56.700
and effort and attention into things

02:24:56.700 --> 02:24:58.700
that get ignored or thrown away

02:24:58.700 --> 02:25:00.700
or just executed terribly

02:25:00.700 --> 02:25:02.700
because the storytelling isn't there.

02:25:02.700 --> 02:25:04.700
It's clear that a lot of really skilled artists

02:25:04.700 --> 02:25:07.700
and animators work on RWBY to this day,

02:25:07.700 --> 02:25:09.700
but the mishandling of the show's story

02:25:09.700 --> 02:25:11.700
and production means that it fails

02:25:11.700 --> 02:25:13.700
to reflect their talents, and that is probably

02:25:13.700 --> 02:25:15.700
the worst thing a show can do.

02:25:15.700 --> 02:25:18.700
It's important to talk about this show

02:25:18.700 --> 02:25:20.700
and where it went wrong because while this is

02:25:20.700 --> 02:25:22.700
the first attempt to make an animated web series

02:25:22.700 --> 02:25:24.700
of basically anything like this scale,

02:25:24.700 --> 02:25:26.700
it won't necessarily be the last,

02:25:26.700 --> 02:25:28.700
and that means we have to learn all the lessons

02:25:28.700 --> 02:25:30.700
we can from its production problems

02:25:30.700 --> 02:25:33.700
and failures or we'll see them get repeated again.

02:25:33.700 --> 02:25:35.700
I want there to be a show one day

02:25:35.700 --> 02:25:37.700
that represents what RWBY could have been,

02:25:37.700 --> 02:25:39.700
and that means recognizing the show's potential

02:25:39.700 --> 02:25:41.700
and where it went wrong.

02:25:41.700 --> 02:25:43.700
RWBY will probably never be the show

02:25:43.700 --> 02:25:45.700
it promised to be, but with the gift

02:25:45.700 --> 02:25:47.700
of learning the lessons it has to teach,

02:25:47.700 --> 02:25:50.700
maybe something else can be.

02:25:50.700 --> 02:25:53.700
Thank you very much for watching.

There's a video on his channel about the process of making it

02:26:25.700 --> 02:26:27.700
which is super great and you should check that out as well.

02:26:27.700 --> 02:26:30.700
Note to self, have the YouTube pop-up thing do that now.

02:26:30.700 --> 02:26:32.700
I don't know what it's called.

02:26:32.700 --> 02:26:34.700
I talked about some serious issues in this video

02:26:34.700 --> 02:26:36.700
and it didn't feel right monetizing a video

02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:39.700
while talking about real-world problems like that.

02:26:39.700 --> 02:26:41.700
I was going to announce in the Faunus chapter

02:26:41.700 --> 02:26:43.700
that I was gonna give the ad revenue

02:26:43.700 --> 02:26:45.700
from this video to a bail fund,

02:26:45.700 --> 02:26:47.700
but rooster teeth can be very strange

02:26:47.700 --> 02:26:49.700
about copyright and monetization

02:26:49.700 --> 02:26:52.700
and I don't want to make a promise I can't keep.

02:26:52.700 --> 02:26:55.700
I'll post an update if we end up being able to do that.

02:26:55.700 --> 02:26:58.700
Thanks a lot and, yeah, I love you.
