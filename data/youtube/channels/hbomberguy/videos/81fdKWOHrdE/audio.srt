RWBY seemed like it was gonna be great.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,760
It was produced by a darling of independent web content

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,500
and created by a legendary animation genius

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,420
and some of his most trusted colleagues

but even with all this stuff in place,

9
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,120
RWBY's pretty bad.

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,160
The basic concept, a 3-D anime about monster hunters,

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,380
is great, and when it tries to flesh this out,

12
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,420
there's some really interesting ideas at times,

13
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,040
and in brief moments, it's got scenes or segments

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,460
that suddenly really work,

15
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,080

It isn't fun to watch,

17

18
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,180
your attention is only rewarded

19
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,720
with more writing or animation problems.

20
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,840
It's not, like, the worst show ever made,

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,460
but RWBY's failures matter

22
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,000
because it really could have been something,

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,500

So this time on the increasingly infrequent

73
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,140
cries for help my family refuses to believe is my job,

74
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,920
I'll be exploring the problems that started

75
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,920
in the early years of the show's development,

76
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,300
how they set the tone for a show

77
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,220
that never quite ended up where it could have been,

78
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,180
why it matters that such a promising thing

79
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,100
turned out this way,

80
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,140
and exactly how and why so many decent ideas

81
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,760
can often get misunderstood

82
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,600
when writers simply borrow them from other shows they like.

83
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,800
I'm focusing primarily on the first three seasons

84
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,940
of the show in this video

85
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,860
because RWBY can be pretty neatly divided

86
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,320
into two separate eras

87
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,180
with two different sets of problems

88
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,600
that don't fully overlap,

89
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,060
and for the purposes of criticism,

90
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,940
I intend to treat them as distinct entities

91
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,780
in most cases.

92
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,820
If you're a fan of the show,

93
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,520
you're probably dreading the worst here,

94
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,480
although if you're a fan of the second half of the show,

95
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,780
you probably already agree

96
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,120
with most of what I'm going to say,

97
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,820
but in any case, if you like RWBY

98
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,320
and you still watch this video,

99
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,800
I love you and thank you for joining me on this journey.

100
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,840
My goal isn't to make anyone think less of a show,

101
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,920
just to think more about it.

102
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,560
It's important to be critical of media you enjoy,

103
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,260
and there is a lot to enjoy about RWBY,

104
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,180
so I hope to give credit where it's due,

105
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,600
and in the places that aren't as good,

106
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,100
well, that's way more interesting.

107
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,680
It's often said that failure

108
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,600
is one of the best learning experiences,

109
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,720
and in that respect,

110
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,400
RWBY has a lot of good things to teach.

111
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,900
Oh, do we not have a cool animated intro for this video?

112
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,900
It's about an anime. It would've been kind of cool.

113
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,400
Are we just going with the standard?

114
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,080
What? It's fine. I mean, it's a bit underwhelming, but...

115
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,820
Hey, do you all remember Rooster Teeth?

116
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,240
No, I don't mean AT&T's, Warner Media's,

117
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,700
Otter Media's Rooster Teeth,

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,200
the company with hundreds of employees

119
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,340

Rooster Teeth is starting video game development.

121
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,800
It's a company that's been around for a long time.

It's a company that's been around for a long time.

124
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,780
It's a company that's been around for a long time.

125
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,280
I mean, Rooster Teeth,

126
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,880
the five or so people who made

127
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,660
Red vs. Blue in their bedroom.

128
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,840
Hey. Yeah?

129
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,540
You ever wonder why we're here?

130
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,960
It's one of life's great mysteries, isn't it?

131
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,880
Popular on the web in the early years was machinima.

132
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,880
People would pose and act characters in games,

133
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,340
effectively using video games as a medium for making movies.

134
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,800
Not in my diner, you don't know Lumberjacks.

135
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,020
The new city design, it just say no Lumberjacks.

136
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,180
Oh, yeah, I didn't see that sign.

137
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,940
Red vs. Blue wasn't the first attempt

138
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,200
to make something like this,

139
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200
but it was far and away the most popular one.

140
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,700
All right, here's the plan.

141
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,460
And it was shockingly successful.

142
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,960
People who had no idea what machinima was

143
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,500
knew about Red vs. Blue.

144
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,880
How many people could make a show half as good as this

145
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,680
using what amounts to a microphone

146
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,840
and a copy of Halo?

147
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,340
I certainly couldn't, and I know because I tried,

148
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,140
and I'm so glad no one saw that.

149
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,880
I was saved by not knowing how to upload videos

150
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,980
when I was 12.

151
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,360
YouTube would simply not accept my Windows Movie Maker file.

152
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,200
As a business, 2000's Rooster Teeth

153
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,740
were incredibly smart, a tiny team producing

154
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,500
a fairly simple show made in a video game engine

155
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,540
but managing to promote it and build it

156
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,880
into a recognizable brand of its own.

157
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,080
The show had merch.

158
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,000
Not Halo merch, but Red vs. Blue merch.

159
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,080
Rooster Teeth had done what was basically impossible

160
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,540
and successfully built a business making machinima.

161
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,760
Not even machinima did that.

162
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,580
So yeah, well done to Bernie Burns

163
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,620
and the rest of the team.

164
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,000
Anyway, then it kept going for, like,

165
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,920
a decade while I wasn't looking.

166
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,140
No, really. They're still making Red vs. Blue

167
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,380
over at Rooster Teeth.

168
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,380
Did you know that?

169
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,980
Can you conceive of the idea

170
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,880
that a show you had fun with in your bedroom

171
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,860
when you were in high school is 17 seasons deep?

172
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,900
I found that out while I was working on this video

173
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,360
and a friend told me that they're on season 17.

174
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,240
It's still hitting me.

175
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,020
Why haven't they stopped?

176
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,660
Well, it's not because the creators of Red vs. Blue

177
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,800
had 17 years of ideas in them.

178
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,060
Rooster Teeth isn't a small company

179
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,740
whose people can do what they want creatively anymore.

180
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,940
They've been bought.

181
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,900
They're part of a large conglomerate now

182
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,660
and their work isn't just a show they like making for fun

183
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,040
because they had a nice idea.

184
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,460
It's an intellectual property with a capital I and P,

185
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,320
and they're gonna keep making it for as long

186
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,040
as it theoretically makes money

187
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,740
no matter how little anyone wants to make it.

188
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,660
As Bernie has always said,

189
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,080
as long as people like it, we will keep making it.

190
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,380
Yep, so shut the fuck up.

191
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,760
And even once you hate it,

192
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,720
even once you're totally fed up with it,

193
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,640
you're like, just stop. We'll still be there.

194
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
We're gonna milk the shit out of it.

195
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,100
Every penny is worth it.

196
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,340
Meanwhile, in another corner of the internet,

197
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,440
another form of early web hashtag content

198
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,720
was being produced.

199
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,680
A guy named Monty Oum was putting 3D animations

200
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,060
of some incredibly cool fights on the internet

201
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,560
on places like early YouTube and DeviantArt

202
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,600
and game trailers.

203
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,360
God, remember game trailers?

204
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,700
Oh, I feel so old now.

205
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,700
His most long-running work was the Dead Fantasy series,

206
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,620
short fights featuring the female characters

207
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,280
from Dead or Alive and Final Fantasy.

208
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,400
These animations are still really cool.

209
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,860
They're basically just characters you know

210
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,460
from stuff fighting, but that's all they have to be.

211
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,000
The fights feel desperate, violent, impactful,

212
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,200
cool, fast, and incredibly technical.

213
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,300
There's nothing quite as good as these

214
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,800
at the things these are doing,

215
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,040
but perhaps the most well-known Monty animation

216
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,920
was released in 2007.

217
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,840
It was called Haloid.

218
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,500
Haloid is utterly fantastic.

219
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,400
Halo Man beats up hundreds of Halo aliens,

220
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,060
but then Metroid Man turns up and they fight,

221
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,820
but then it turns out Metroid Man is a girl

222
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,280
and then they fight each other again

223
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,200
and also more aliens in a big sequence so epic

224
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,160
only music taken directly from the Matrix Reloaded's

225
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,820
Burly Brawl scene could possibly do it justice,

226
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,460
and they even pay homage to some scenes

227
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,620
from that fight while they're at it.

228
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,380
They blow all the aliens up and escape,

229
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,700
reenacting another cool scene

230
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,540
from the Matrix Reloaded in the process,

231
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,840
but then it turns out that Halo Man was also a girl.

232
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,840
Oh, my God!

233
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,220
And then they watch the sun set.

234
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,140
Ah, that's nice.

235
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,800
Maybe I'm being overly sentimental

236
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,260
about some animated fights,

237
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,520
but the late, great Monty Oum was basically a genius

238
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,520
at what he did.

239
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,280
The guy passed away really tragically

240
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,940
and suddenly in 2015,

241
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,820
but the body of work he left behind

242
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,560
is genuinely fantastic and inspirational.

243
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,480
It's fascinating to me that stuff Monty made for fun,

244
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,240
for free in a couple of weeks

245
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,280
is infinitely more dynamic and fun and engaging

246
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,020
than stuff real, big-budget animation productions

247
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,020
have put together.

248
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,900
I can barely think of a handful of things

249
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,400
that even remotely compare.

250
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,360
For a time, Rooster Teeth and Monty Oum

251
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,780
were just their own things off in their own corners

252
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,500
of the Internet, but then, 2010, PAX.

253
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,120
Rooster Teeth premiere a new episode of Red vs. Blue.

254
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,960
It's standard fare for the show, really.

255
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,580
Familiar characters, familiar engine limitations,

256
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,960
cute meta jokes about how nerfed the pistol was

257
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
in the new Halo game.

258
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,520
You know, these things aren't quite as effective

259
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,520
as they used to be.

260
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,980
We're robbing...now.

261
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,980
But then...

262
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,980
Do you want to hear a...

268
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,380
I wasn't there when this happened,

269
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,960
but I remember going as wild as this crowd did

270
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,460
when I saw this episode online.

271
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,420
Oh, my God!

273
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,800
The limitations of the Halo games had been broken.

Who could be behind it?

275
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,520
Oh, who am I kidding? You know who's behind it.

276
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,520
You've guessed this bit.

277
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,440
We saw a short film called Haloid

278
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,560
by a gentleman by the name of Monty Oum.

279
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,480
-♪♪

280
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,400
And we were extremely impressed by what we saw.

281
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,560
This is, if you haven't seen it before,

282
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,940
it's a piece where Master Chief fights Metroid.

283
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,080
Wow, Bernie.

284
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,120
Video game knowledge check fail.

285
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,740
It's Sergeant Metroid.

286
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,740
Have some respect for the troops.

287
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,820
Monty had been hired in secret by Rooster Teeth

288
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,580
to work on animation for the new season of Red vs. Blue.

289
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,780
For almost 10 years now, I've been so in love

290
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,080
with how they introduce him.

291
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,880
He's literally in the audience and they say,

292
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,000
hey, Monty's here now, and he just gets up

293
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and joins in as the fourth panelist.

294
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,340
It's excellent showmanship

295
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,000
and also just really kind of beautiful.

296
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,720
So now in Red vs. Blue,

297
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,460
there were suddenly tons of interesting

298
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,420
and creative animated sequences

299
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,180
and when some kind of fight was going to happen

300
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,940
instead of being in-engine characters

301
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,740
standing and shooting at each other

302
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,540
and being kind of boring, it'd be a Monty-Ohm fight.

303
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,920
These sequences really added a lot to the series.

304
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,760
All right, now you're just showing off.

305
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,460
Well, that's a big thing. We like doing team-up stuff, right?

306
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,000
And we found Monty on the Internet.

307
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,800
Here's something he's doing that's really cool

308
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,920
that we can't do so we're just gonna come together

309
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,040
and make something cool.

310
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,920
As they grew, they expanded their production

311
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,100
of other shows and podcasts and became a media entity

312
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,520
which would eventually be worthy of the ultimate prize,

313
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,560
being bought and turned into a subsidiary

314
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,020
of a larger media conglomerate.

315
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,600
However, their biggest show and Monty's animations

316
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
were still technically just fan works

317
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,640
of someone else's intellectual property.

318
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,020
Monty and the others clearly wanted to paint

319
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,680
on a bigger canvas and have a fresh start.

320
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,020
Monty wanted to create something as expressive

321
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,900
and unique and stylish as the anime and video games

322
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,020
that had inspired him.

323
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,020
Like, Monty and I are working on right now

324
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,140
a whole series that's just not machinima at all.

325
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,400
It's just animation stuff.

326
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,320
Right. And we're throwing around ideas for that.

327
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,280
This show would turn out to be called RWBY

328
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,160
and the first of four trailers for the series

329
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,460
was released with the conclusion

330
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,080
of Red vs. Blue season 10.

331
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,460
But, uh, RWBY, which we finally showed a trailer for

332
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,960
at the conclusion of Red vs. Blue season 10 last night.

333
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,120
Fuck yeah. We're fucking excited.

334
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,500
It's, it's awesome.

335
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,580
Now, obviously, I'm kind of biased against this show.

336
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,280
I'm making a whole video about why I didn't like it.

337
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,040
Keep this in mind when I say that

338
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,780
RWBY's Red trailer fucking owns.

339
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,780
["RWBY's Red Trailer"]

340
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,280
It's an extravaganza of violence,

341
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,580
visual style, speed, timing,

342
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,000
and this is one of the most fantastic things ever.

343
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Everyone who saw this flipped the fuck out.

344
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,540
Holy shit, it's a scythe that turns into a gun.

345
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,460
Oh! The Red trailer has 15 million views on YouTube.

346
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,960
That's more than any episode of RWBY.

347
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,500
That's more than any episode of Red vs. Blue.

348
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,700
The first episode has 14 million views

349
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,580
and just for the record, uh, the second episode has 6.8.

350
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,680
The only things on Rooster Teeth's channel

351
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,880
with more views are the really cool Monty fight

352
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,220
from Red vs. Blue season eight which I already showed

353
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,640
which they uploaded on its own separately from the show

354
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,100
because they knew it was amazing,

355
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,140
a joke Angry Birds movie trailer

356
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,520
that went viral twice, you know, once when it came out

357
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,360
and then again when actual trailers

358
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,060
for the actual real Angry Birds movie started coming out

359
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,860
and, uh, Minecraft Let's Play because of course.

360
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,020
The trailer is very simple.

361
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,740
This Red character visits a grave

362
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,360
then gets accosted by werewolves

363
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,400
before fighting and killing dozens of them

364
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,760
but it's so much more than that.

365
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,900
It's so cool looking, so good feeling to watch

366
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,780
and just so alive with motion

367
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,700
that it sells the show right away.

368
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,360
You immediately want to see more of it

369
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,440
and know what's going on in this world.

370
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,940
Welcome back, by the way.

371
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,160
I'm saying that because half the people watching this video

372
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
remembered the Red trailer while I was talking about it

373
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,500
and paused to go watch it again.

374
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,200
Another thing I want to bring up while we're here

375
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,000
is that this is the best piece of music

376
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,800
Jeff Williams has ever composed.

377
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,540
Jeff had been doing music for Rooster Teeth

378
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,460
since early in the Red vs. Blue days

379
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,960
and while he was clearly talented,

380
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,900
there wasn't much room in Red vs. Blue

381
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,820
most of the time for his music to shine

382
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,120
and this trailer really gives him the chance to do that

383
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,960
and he clearly latched onto it like a limpet.

384
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,360
The song in this trailer introduces

385
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,660
a really powerful motif.

386
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,660
It's this bit here.

387
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:35,840
["Limpet"]

388
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,840
It has a surprising amount of versatility.

389
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,460
It gets used later in this fight

390
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,300
in a much more intense variation.

391
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,760
["Limpet"]

392
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,240
This sound will basically be Ruby's,

393
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,200
both the show and the characters,

394
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,240
central theme for the rest of the series.

395
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,080
They knew they had something great with this

396
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,460
and they just went with it.

397
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,740
The White trailer introduces us to a character

398
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,000
called Weiss who appears to be a singer

399
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,740
and intercuts her singing with a sequence

400
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,760
where she fights a giant knight with a rapier

401
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,080
with a revolver in the handle.

402
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,800
She has more of a magic-oriented fight style

403
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,840
and the fight's pretty good.

404
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,840
I really like how expressive the visuals are

405
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,000
in these first two trailers.

406
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,100
The world is stark colors and the lighting is harsh.

407
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,060
The backgrounds here are blacks and whites.

408
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,340
It's hard to tell if the events of the trailer are literal

409
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,220
or if this is a liminal space

410
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,680
and the knight represents something.

411
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,100
I like the red on the inside of her dress and boots too.

412
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,060
It really pops out and makes the whole visual design work.

413
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,680
They've really committed to making the character one color

414
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,600
but giving them just enough of other stuff

415
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,340
that it stands out even more.

416
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,100
Weiss's singing is done by Casey Lee Williams,

417
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,380
Jeff Williams's daughter, who was 15 at the time.

418
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,720
Casey's clearly pretty talented so it works.

419
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,680
Weiss wins and it fades back to her singing

420
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,760
for the audience but the wound she got in the fight

421
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,840
fades to a scar.

422
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,800
Did she get it in this fight or from something else?

423
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,920
Ooh, mysterious.

424
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,600
The black trailer introduces us to...

425
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,420
writing and voice acting.

426
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,460
Blake, it's time.

427
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm sorry, what? I'll turn that up for you.

428
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,040
Blake, it's time.

429
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,340
Oh, God, I shouldn't have turned it up.

430
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,680
They anime ninja run over to catch a train

431
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,180
snaking through this beautifully designed red forest.

432
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,220
Inside the train is a cool fight with evil robots.

433
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,000
Yeah! The fight's pretty good.

434
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,140
Blake's weapon is a sword whose holster

435
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,840
is another bigger sword

436
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,100
and they're connected by a string or something.

437
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,720
Also, it can turn into a gun.

438
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,600
Uh, it looks neat but I couldn't tell you

439
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,420
exactly what it does.

440
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,220
I like it though.

441
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,920
The music in this trailer has lyrics too

442
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,840
sung again by Casey Lee Williams.

443
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,140
The singing is, well, this time she's being pushed

444
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,600
to sing aggressive anime fight music.

445
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,220
♪ A boy with a knife and a chain ♪

446
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,840
♪ A boy with torture and a pain ♪

447
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,340
♪ A boy with ridicule and hate ♪

448
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,300
Oh! The fight is cool though.

449
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,220
I don't think it's as cool as the red trailer

450
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,300
because it's set in or on a train

451
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,720
so the fight sequences are in a rectangular box

452
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,260
or basically just a straight line.

453
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,840
It's hard to have creative movements

454
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,180
and camera work in that setup.

455
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,340
It's a bit of a limitation.

456
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,980
Halfway through, we get the first proper story beat

457
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,420
of our whole show.

458
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,380
Perfect.

459
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,300
Ugh, I'll set the charges.

460
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,960
What about the crew members?

461
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,300
What about them?

462
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,660
Oh, I think he might be a bad guy.

463
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,420
This is the beginning of a writing problem

464
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,200
which starts here and continues to plague the show

465
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,960
until, uh, actually it hasn't stopped yet.

466
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,340
When you have a character straight up say,

467
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,300
I don't care about killing civilians,

468
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,000
to someone's face, what you're doing

469
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,700
is having a character openly admit

470
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,700
they've been written to be the bad guy

471
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,840
and that's incredibly weird because they've written

472
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,840
monsters into the setting that are just generically evil

473
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,080
and want to destroy humanity because that's in their nature

474
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,080
so it's very weird that the actual characters

475
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,320
that you wrote behave like that too.

476
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,580
Anyway, they get attacked by a robot

477
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,620
and the guy cuts it apart in a genuinely really cool shot

478
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,080
but then he gets to the front of the car

479
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,580
and Blake says goodbye and cuts the car free,

480
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,740
leaving him behind, obviously having a problem

481
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,200
with his being okay with killing innocent people

482
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,360
and I guess this is the first time

483
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,580
she's noticed this about him

484
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,580
and as she disappears into the distance

485
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,500
and the colors really beautifully fade away

486
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,120
so she's alone in a void

487
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,700
and we're given a meaningful impression

488
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,120
of her emotional state,

489
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,540
the audience is struck with one lingering thought.

490
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,700
He can make that jump.

491
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,820
In the yellow trailer, we're introduced to Yang,

492
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,620
a character based on Goldilocks

493
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,740
so we have Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Goldilocks

494
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,580
and, uh, this one isn't really clear yet

495
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,400
but trust me, we'll get to it.

496
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,160
It's...we'll get to it.

497
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,740
Yang goes to a bar whose soundtrack

498
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,540
is a remix of the theme from the red trailer.

499
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,900
["Red Riding Hood Theme"]

500
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,660
It's neat. She beats up the manager

501
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,780
over whether he's seen someone in a picture

502
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,100
and she's written like two adult men

503
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,520
who've never written anything professionally before

504
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,860
except for Red vs. Blue trying to write a teenage girl.

505
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,860
Weirdly specific impression there.

506
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,020
Oh, Junior, I was just playing with you.

507
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,480
Don't be so sensitive.

508
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,640
Come on. Let's kiss and make up, okay?

509
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,240
But after two minutes, she punches the guy

510
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,320
and a fight starts and the trailer gets really good.

511
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,560
Her weapons are gloves that unfold into fist guns.

512
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,480
Yang's design and basic fighting style

513
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,440
seem very evocative of Tifa from Final Fantasy VII,

514
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,600
a character Monty previously liked to use a lot

515
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,300
in Dead Fantasy. It kind of makes sense

516
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,380
that some of the characters are designed around characters

517
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,800
he previously liked animating,

518
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,380
but now they're his own characters

519
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,880
that he has total control over.

520
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,460
Yang has three back-to-back cool fights

521
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,960
against a gang of guys who all dress like Jim Sterling,

522
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,300
two ladies who I guess are bodyguards or something,

523
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,000
and then against the guy she punched earlier.

524
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,640
She punches him with so much power

525
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,880
that the screen gets a Photoshop filter over it

526
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,380
and when she lands outside the bar,

527
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,380
Ruby is there.

528
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,760
Yang? Is that you?

529
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,300
Oh, no. Is that how she talked?

530
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,920
The writing and voice acting could do

531
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,960
with some refining and some of Jeff's musical decisions

532
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,920
could be dialed back just a little bit,

533
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,700
but basically these trailers are some of the coolest

534
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,240
possible trailers for a cartoon ever.

535
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,380
Like, if you showed me every trailer for every cartoon

536
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,160
and asked me which one I'd want to see at the end of that,

537
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,280
of course I'd pick Lunatics Unleashed.

538
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,000
I mean, seriously, this is fucking insane.

539
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,820
Why would anyone make this? I have to know!

540
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,160
But at a very close second, I'd pick this one.

541
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,040
Literally millions of people have gone back

542
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,580
to watch the red trailer again,

543
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,240
and looking at view figures, they've done that

544
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,740
instead of watching more of the actual show.

545
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,040
They're not just amazing teasers for a show.

546
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,240
They're just good.

547
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,660
It's so hard not to be on board

548
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,620
for the show these trailers are pointing to.

549
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,360
They imply a show that's going to be utterly,

550
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,320
fantastically tremendous.

551
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,860
But then it came out and it was bad.

552
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,860
["Lunatics Unleashed"]

553
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,440
Oh, you're still here. Right.

554
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,620
So Ruby isn't as simple as a bad show, is it?

555
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,320
It's a bad show which could have been something,

556
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,120
something truly amazing,

557
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,620
and that makes its problems infinitely more interesting

558
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,360
and important to explore,

559
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,980
and it's especially worth doing

560
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,980
because the show's creators do try

561
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,100
to be receptive to criticism.

562
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,640
Well, they try, but this manifests in a strange way

563
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,220
I'd like to discuss real quick.

564
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,140
The writers have talked on podcasts,

565
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,300
commentary tracks, panels, and so on

566
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,940
about the ways people have been shitty about the show

567
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,860
and how important it is to not be an asshole

568
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,280
when you're criticizing something.

569
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,320
People will make a comment.

570
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,680
Maybe it's, like, a criticism or something,

571
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,600
and you go, oh, okay, yeah, that's a fair critique,

572
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,440
but you don't want to listen to them

573
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,520
because of the way they said it,

574
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,120
which is something I think most people agree with.

575
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,520
It's really tough when you get a criticism

576
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,160
that you actually agree with

577
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,820
but you think was expressed

578
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,660
in an incredibly insensitive and rude way

579
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,920
because you never want to know

580
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,340
what the writer has to say about that.

581
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,960
That's not the way you get things.

582
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,800
It's just not.

583
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,380
I really get what he's saying here,

584
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,660
and, yeah, plenty of criticism of the show

585
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,820
is worthless dog shit.

586
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,220
For some reason, this show seems to attract people

587
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,740
who need excuses to yell at cartoon women,

588
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,100
but I'm having a hard time

589
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,220
finding more than one or two decent examples

590
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,460
of times they've really explored

591
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,860
actual criticisms of the show,

592
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,740
and the fact the show keeps making the same mistakes

593
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,820
implies they kinda don't.

594
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,460
I've seen the writers sometimes, quote,

595
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,580
retweet someone being shitty about the show

596
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,180
and responding to this behavior,

597
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,100
and, again, often what they're saying is correct.

598
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,660
If you have a point but you're an asshole about it,

599
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,700
no one will want to listen to you.

600
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,340
I basically agree completely with what Miles is saying here,

601
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,420
but he appears to spend a significant amount less time

602
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,220
responding to the kinds of criticism

603
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,180
he says he wants to see,

604
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,380
and there is good-faith criticism out there,

605
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,700
so stepping over them to point at bad-faith criticisms

606
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,100
and complain about how they're not helpful

607
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,180
means that, functionally, all you're doing

608
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,380
is rewarding shitty people with time and attention

609
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,020
you then don't spend engaging with the people

610
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,580
who make the decent criticisms of your work,

611
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:40,220
and as a lifelong fan of Rooster Teeth and Monty Oum,

612
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,140
I certainly hope it's clear that my criticism

613
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,180
comes from a well-meaning place.

614
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,380
I'm only here because I really thought

615
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,900
the show could have been great,

616
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,180
and I still think that maybe it could be.

617
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,100
Hey, see?

618
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,100
The chapel wasn't just here to be a reference

619
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,500
to that scene from Kingsman.

620
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,900
It was also a clever metaphor for my intent

621
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,420
to make a good-faith criticism.

622
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,220
Hey, come on. I thought it was clever.

623
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,620
Wait. Is that...

624
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,020
Is an intro playing now?

625
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,820
Hasn't it been, like, 20 minutes?

626
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,020

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,780
RWBY is about a girl who goes to anime warrior school

642
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,940
after getting invited

643
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,360
by the ominous and enigmatic headmaster,

644
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,660
Sephiroth Dumbledore,

645
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,160
and RWBY and her sister and new friends

646
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,160
mess about doing plot lines

647
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,280
that don't go anywhere for a few years

648
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,620
while the show decides what its story actually is.

649
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,120
Okay, wait, we're getting ahead of ourselves.

650
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,120
I wanted to start this video by doing the thing

651
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,740
all the smart video essayists are doing nowadays

652
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,040
where they sum up the plot of the thing they're analyzing

653
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,920
in a funny way that lays the groundwork

654
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,880
for future critique, but trying to delve into

655
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,920
and describe the deeper story problems

656
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,420
misses the surface problem

657
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,440
that there basically isn't one.

658
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,820
There's a really telling scene

659
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,120
at the end of the second season

660
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,820
where the main characters sit around

661
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,740
discussing the events of the show so far

662
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,820
and conclude that they don't really know

663
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,500
what's happening or why

664
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,200
and haven't figured anything out yet.

665
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,700
We didn't solve everything.

666
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,880
A lot of people were hurt,

667
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,720
and we still don't even know why they did this

668
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,540
or who that mystery girl was.

669
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,540
The show attempts to justify this, though.

670
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,880
Not every story has an eaten tidy ending.

671
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,520
Stories don't have to make sense or go anywhere.

672
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,540
Now, to a certain extent, this is an okay point to make.

673
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,740
Like, in real life, things don't have arcs

674
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,660
or necessarily lead anywhere,

675
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,420
but if 28 episodes into your story,

676
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,960
you're ending a season on a character

677
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,960
giving what amounts to a justification

678
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,540
for the story not mattering,

679
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,140
maybe the plot could have done with some more work.

680
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,840
The dog mimicking Yang is really cute, though,

681
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,180
so at least there's that.

682
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,640
Uh, time for bed?

683
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,380
Oh, please. Absolutely. Yes.

684
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,520
This is the season two finale.

685
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,100
We don't know what the story is.

686
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,180
Nap time.

687
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,140
Almost all of our main characters

688
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,440
don't find out what the actual story that's going on

689
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,280
actually is until about halfway through season four

690
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,620
where someone tells them while sitting around a campfire.

691
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,400
Ruby's story is one of those stories

692
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,860
that I like to call theoretically interesting

693
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,700
where, like, if you read it on Wikipedia,

694
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,960
it would sound really cool,

695
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,580
and in the show, there are plenty of times

696
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,960
where the characters sit you down

697
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,300
and tell you what the story was,

698
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,000
and you go, oh, that's actually really interesting.

699
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,500
I wish I'd seen some of that,

700
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,080
but in the actual episodes of the show you get to see,

701
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,580
not much happens at all,

702
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,120
so to hone in on why the story ended up like this,

703
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,380
we're gonna have to explore how the show was made.

704
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,540
Monty Oum was the main creator of Ruby,

705
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,500
but it seems like he didn't do much of the writing himself.

706
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,500
In interviews, Monty and the rest of Rooster Teeth

707
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,500
have been up front that Monty's not that interested

708
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,300
in the writing part of making a show.

709
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,220
And we do stuff like writing characters

710
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,260
and storylines and stuff that he doesn't really,

711
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,420
I don't know if he's just not interested in it,

712
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,940
but he doesn't do it. He likes all the animation.

713
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,140
Monty was more of a visual storyteller

714
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,820
and seemed to prefer to have writers do the writing part,

715
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,240
which means the show has some other important creators,

716
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,080
Miles Luna and Kerry Shawcross.

717
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,740
Ruby is being, it's directed by Monty Oum,

718
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,880
uh, and then, uh, Monty, Kerry, and myself

719
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,220
are the lead writers for the show.

720
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,260
Kerry had done some editing and compositing work

721
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,100
on Red vs. Blue and Miles had done machinimating,

722
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,560
like the head bobbing to the recorded dialogue,

723
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,600
on season nine.

724
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,220
He then wrote 13 minutes worth of miniseries

725
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,060
and helped co-write season ten.

726
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,140
Fucking with Ruby was a lot of fun.

727
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,640
It was a lot of fun to make.

728
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,900
It was really scary because it was essentially

729
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,160
the first time that either of us had ever written anything.

730
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,120
Oh, I appear to have accidentally paused that clip.

731
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,320
Written anything.

732
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,820
On this scale. Yeah, on this scale.

733
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,580
On this scale, for sure, yeah.

734
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,820
There's a fourth really important team member

735
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,200
who often goes unmentioned even though he's in the credits

736
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,960
of Ruby from even the first trailer, Shane Neuville.

737
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,340
He was a close friend of Monty's

738
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,380
and the two collaborated quite a lot on stuff.

739
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,040
He'd worked with him on the animated parts

740
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
of Red vs. Blue.

741
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,500
Monty or Shane will choreograph fights

742
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,780
or whatever sequences.

743
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,580
And he's made some great stuff on his own.

744
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,120
Monty first came up with some of the basic concepts for Ruby

745
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,120
while eating in an IHOP with Shane.

746
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,040
He doesn't get credited very often for his role

747
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,220
in the making of the series,

748
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,720
but some of the best animated moments were made by him.

749
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,880
So Monty came up with the basic ideas

750
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,060
for Ruby's world and characters and story

751
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,100
and then brought on Kerry and Miles as writers

752
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,560
and Shane as another animator.

753
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,300
The kind of thing we want to deliberate on

754
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,240
and put more thought into is, like, the plot and character.

755
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,620
And that's the stuff that Miles and Kerry's

756
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,620
been helping me with.

757
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,000
So, like, um...

758
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,500
Monty, Kerry, and Miles appear to have worked together

759
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,160
to come up with a basic outline of the plot and setting,

760
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,460
but most importantly for Monty,

761
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,380
the action sequences that were going to happen

762
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,880
and when in the story they happened,

763
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,140
and then Monty, Shane, and maybe a few others

764
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,180
went off to start work on the action scenes,

765
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,260
in doing so crafting some of the most cool

766
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,440
and elaborate action sequences ever made.

767
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,900
Meanwhile, the writers and the rest of the animation team

768
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,600
put together the rest of the scenes.

769
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,500
Eventually the three of us all decided on

770
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,780
a few set rules and characters and, um,

771
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,700
story ideas that we wanted to stick to.

772
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,040
Monty's working on, like, action and, like,

773
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,340
the design and the look of the show

774
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:32,080
and he kind of had us go off and start writing,

775
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,960
uh, the first episode.

776
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,720
Yeah. This division of work does seem

777
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,140
to make sense on the surface.

778
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,020
However, something Miles is being nice

779
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,140
and not mentioning is that sometimes Monty

780
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:44,680
would just disappear and then come up with new characters,

781
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,760
story elements, and action sequences

782
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,520
which the writers would then suddenly have to make room for

783
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,480
in their script. More on that later,

784
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,060
but for now, generally speaking,

785
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,820
Monty and Shane did the fights,

786
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,360
Kerry and Miles wrote the words,

787
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,240
and another team of animators put together

788
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,360
the non-action scenes.

789
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,900
The three of us would have a lot of meetings

790
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,620
and collaborate on the show to the point where

791
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,860
I just started coming up with the broad strokes eventually

792
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,160
and they would work. They had pretty much written

793
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,880
the book or the bulk of the show.

794
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,340
So in Monty's own words,

795
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,760
the bulk of the show is written by these writers.

796
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,340
To a certain extent, it's a bit like

797
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,800
if Dead Fantasy was a full animated series

798
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,620
with writers hired to connect the dots

799
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,800
and explain and justify the fights that were happening.

800
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,500
So there's a lot of good places to start

801
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,420
when analyzing the show's writing process,

802
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,020
but the best place is probably

803
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,520
the very beginning of the show.

804
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,480
I know, right? I'm a genius.

805
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,940
The opening of RWBY really doesn't set up

806
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,180
the story too well, but it does set up

807
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,140
the writing problems we'll go on to see

808
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,060
throughout the story in a useful way.

809
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,180
RWBY begins with a very simplistic-looking

810
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,860
introductory animation explaining the basic setting

811
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,920
with the slight problem that it doesn't actually

812
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,960
do that at all.

813
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,800
All it actually says is there's man

814
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,220
and also dangerous monsters that want to eat them up

815
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,520
called Grimm, as in Grimm's fairy tales,

816
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,180
which is kind of cute, and then man discovered dust,

817
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,440
a magical substance, well, magical-ish.

818
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,180
We'll get to that later, which can be used

819
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,680
to defeat them in some vague way.

820
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,780
This power was appropriately named Dust.

821
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,520
Why is that an appropriate name?

822
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,620
Hang on.

823
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:13,620
Man born from dust was strong, wise, and resourceful.

824
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,260
Okay, so it's called Dust because we, like,

825
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:20,640
came from dust, man, and that's the intro.

826
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,520
You'd think they'd explain a little bit more

827
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,940
about the world itself or what the setting is like,

828
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,560
and as they zoom out on a world map,

829
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,400
you briefly see four castles, so what's going on there?

830
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,440
Are they countries? But before you can be told

831
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,240
anything more important than dust,

832
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,860
they evaporate and we transition

833
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,520
to the first real scene of the story.

834
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,020
The intro doesn't share information,

835
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,260
which might have been really good to know going in

836
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,100
so people aren't confused when it suddenly comes up later.

837
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,900
For example, there's a third species

838
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,680
separate from humans or Grimm called the Faunus

839
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,600
whose existence and treatment by humans

840
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,700
is supposedly one of the driving elements

841
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,900
of the entire plot.

842
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,280
The first time this plot element

843
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,980
or even what a Faunus is comes up

844
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,740
is about 11 episodes into the show.

845
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,360
It must be hard to be a Faunus.

846
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,700
Your first reaction to a core plot point is,

847
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,580
to be a what? What's that?

848
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,000
The Faunus are mentioned once at the end of episode one

849
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,320
on TV when a piece of concept art

850
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,980
briefly brings up something called the Faunus protests.

851
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:16,320
This Saturday's Faunus civil rights protest turned dark.

852
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,860
But before they can actually tell you what that is,

853
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,540
it cuts out and then they don't come up again

854
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,000
until near the end of the season,

855
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,500
so it's almost like a surprise when they come back up.

856
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,500
For another example, in RWBY's setting,

857
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,160
every character has a power called Assemblance,

858
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,380
an ability completely unique to them.

859
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,340
What Assemblance is or the fact they exist at all

860
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:37,300
or how this universe's version of magic even works

861
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,520
isn't mentioned in the slightest in the opening

862
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,900
where that might have been nice,

863
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,020
and the name Semblance isn't even said in the show

864
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,280
until episode four...teen.

865
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,700
Fourteen. Sorry, I stuttered.

866
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,400
The four kingdoms and their relationships

867
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,320
with each other and their fragile peace

868
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,820
barely comes up until that peace is fractured

869
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,820
in season three where you suddenly learn

870
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,740
as it's happening that this peace

871
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,740
was incredibly easy to fracture and was hanging by a thread.

872
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,880
Our kingdoms are at the brink of war.

873
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,540
Wait, what? Are they? What's happening?

874
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,960
These all would have been really useful to know

875
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,460
going into the story or at least should be

876
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,420
properly set up at some point and not just dumped on you

877
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,080
the instant they become relevant,

878
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,300
but instead basic aspects of the setting

879
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,040
start to feel almost like twists

880
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,540
when they suddenly come up multiple hours in

881
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,920
with no groundwork laid for you whatsoever,

882
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,420
and the main opportunity to set some of this stuff up

883
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,980
and get the audience on the same narrative page,

884
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,940
the intro, gets thrown away

885
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,720
to give you a commercial for dust.

886
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,180
Why? Well, the first scene in the show

887
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,120
is the main villain of the first season

888
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,740
robbing a dust store and Ruby fighting them.

889
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,080
Now, in abstract, this opening scene itself

890
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,420
is a fine idea.

891
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,960
It's a very common and punchy way to start a story,

892
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,540
have a crime happen and the main character stopping it.

893
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,960
It's immediately engaging.

894
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,220
It draws the viewer in with action and stakes,

895
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,880
and it's a strong way of establishing

896
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,920
the primary hero and villain of a story.

897
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,940
Now, they could be robbing a bank or a convenience store

898
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,520
or a gas station or a jewelry store

899
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,020
or an analog for these things

900
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,440
that's appropriate to the setting,

901
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,360
but the decision was made to have it be a dust store,

902
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,740
and this is a decent choice too.

903
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,420
It's an important thing within the setting.

904
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,040
However, this does pose a problem for your audience

905
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,540
because now you're opening on the attempted theft

906
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,620
of a fantasy resource which has no point

907
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,040
of easy comparison to anything in real life.

908
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,760
You know how everyone knows what the One Ring is

909
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,640
because it's a ring that has evil magical properties

910
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,760
so you kind of get it?

911
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,380
Not quite as many people engaged

912
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,340
with the Silmarils, did they?

913
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,900
God, even admitting I know what that is embarrasses me.

914
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,020
If you just opened on this robbery without the intro,

915
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,900
people would get the gist of robbery

916
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,020
and girl stopping them,

917
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,520
but not what dust is or what it does

918
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,980
or why it's so important,

919
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,320
but you kind of have to start with the dust store

920
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,320
because it's a unique place for the setting

921
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,320
which could be interesting if it's pulled off well,

922
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,780
and the plan of the main villain for this season

923
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,040
is that he's stealing all the dust from everywhere,

924
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,000
so it's economically good storytelling

925
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,920
to open on one of those attempted thefts,

926
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,220
so in order for everyone to know what dust is

927
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,380
and why it's important,

928
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,680
the intro animation for the entire series

929
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,380
was either written or rewritten

930
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,800
to primarily focus on explaining dust

931
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,880
which is a tremendously poor idea

932
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,880
because now nothing else is explained.

933
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,880
When it comes down to it,

934
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,560
there's stuff much more important

935
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,840
to set up in the story

936
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,060
than some guy robbing a store.

937
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,760
Compounding this is that the plot

938
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,680
of the entire first season is this bad guy,

939
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,980
Clockwork Orange Man,

940
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,900
is trying to steal dust.

941
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,240
Why? Well, you'll find out in season never

942
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,520
because they dropped that plot point.

943
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,520
I'm not even kidding.

944
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,160
They changed their mind about the plot,

945
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,340
so none of this matters.

946
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,920
So yeah, on top of the obviously quite large problem

947
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,540
that the writers didn't know what their story

948
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,460
was going to be until after they'd finished

949
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,680
writing a season of it,

950
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,760
the chance to set up and explain the wider setting

951
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,140
so people know a little more is squandered

952
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,600
in order to explain why the next scene in the show

953
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,180
is supposed to be important

954
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,600
and then it turns out not to be anyway.

955
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,140
This is the opposite of economical storytelling.

956
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,740
This is...expensive storytelling.

957
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,480
This jumbled mess of ideas,

958
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,520
plot decisions, intro priorities,

959
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,620
and later changes makes the intro feel

960
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,780
like a first draft that they couldn't change.

961
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,320
In the commentary track, they talk a lot about

962
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,120
how cool it was that they got the voice actress

963
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,660
for Cortana from Halo to do the opening voiceover

964
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,320
and it seems like she might have had a pretty busy schedule,

965
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,080
so I have the sinking feeling that they wrote the intro

966
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,200
and then recorded it and then realized

967
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,920
that maybe it could have done with some more work

968
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,920
and it was too late.

969
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,080
That's, that's just my speculation there though,

970
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,000
but this stuff needs to be the strongest

971
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,300
because it's the best chance you have

972
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,780
to sell an audience on your setting and story.

973
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,840
The only thing really holding up its end here

974
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,540
is Monty's fight with the robbers,

975
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,460
which is really good, and also the transition

976
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,260
to the fight from the scene in the store

977
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,140
employs a really cool technique I love

978
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,340
called shifting diegesis because you think

979
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,840
that you're just hearing the music

980
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,840
but it's actually playing on Ruby's headphones.

981
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,220
["I'm the one who's gonna get it"]

982
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,220
["I'm the one who's gonna get it"]

983
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,180
That and the fight are really cool

984
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,440
and because of the intro not being super great,

985
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,440
I think it's the only thing that really hooks people in

986
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,600
in the first few minutes.

987
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,000
No one's watching the intro and going,

988
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,280
oh, wow, dust sold.

989
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,240
The show ends up having a lot of interesting ideas,

990
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,260
but those ideas are executed on and explained to you

991
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,640
extremely poorly in a way that really lets the show down.

992
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,960
I'm gonna say this right now.

993
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,420
Ruby's story gets interesting.

994
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,960
Ruby is a really fun show to write a wiki about.

995
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,060
There's some great stuff in there over the years,

996
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,020
but the story telling only gets worse

997
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,760
and the setting is one of the most poorly communicated

998
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,520
the world had ever seen before Bright came out.

999
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,560
Let's talk about world building and more importantly

1000
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,560
how you convey that world to the viewer.

1001
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,520
A thing lots of good fiction stories

1002
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,760
for young adults try to do is craft a story

1003
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,100
where you learn how things work

1004
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,980
without being explicitly told.

1005
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,760
The setting of, say, Avatar

1006
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,760
to pick a completely random example

1007
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,020
doesn't tell you exactly how everything works

1008
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,400
because this world is normal to the people living in it

1009
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,400
so no one would need to stop and ask what's going on.

1010
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,020
Sometimes you meet people who can throw fire at you

1011
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,440
and that's just not that surprising.

1012
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,460
There's a nation full of people who can do that

1013
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,880
and hey, you probably have a relative

1014
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,960
who can throw rocks without touching them.

1015
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,000
That's life, man.

1016
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,340
So for the sake of the audience,

1017
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,460
the story is written so the unique aspects of the world

1018
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,960
come up in ways where the audience

1019
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,220
learns how things work.

1020
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,880
It's waterbending and it's...

1021
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,600
Yeah, yeah, an ancient art unique to our culture,

1022
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,840
blah, blah, blah.

1023
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,520
This example from the first episode

1024
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,180
is a little clumsy and obvious

1025
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,520
compared to the rest of the show,

1026
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,400
but it's really solid exposition

1027
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,560
especially for a show that children might be watching.

1028
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,600
You now know what waterbending is

1029
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,600
and that it's unique to a culture

1030
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,240
and that this is all so normal in this world

1031
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,520
that even teenagers are casually dismissive

1032
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,560
about this information and you learn all of this

1033
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,660
without even feeling like you're being told.

1034
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,480
You think you're just watching two siblings

1035
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,160
arguing about how to catch a fish,

1036
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,280
you fucking idiot, but you're secretly having

1037
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,540
the main concepts of the world explained to you.

1038
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,580
It's clever. Katara's trying to catch a fish

1039
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,460
with waterbending, but in real life,

1040
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,840
the viewer is the fish out of water.

1041
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,760
Ha ha ha. Who let you in here?

1042
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,920
I once heard someone smarter than me

1043
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,120
calling this naturalistic storytelling.

1044
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,640
The story never condescends to its audience

1045
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,720
by pausing to tell you how the world works.

1046
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,640
Instead, it just tells the story

1047
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,440
in a way that makes it easier to understand how it works,

1048
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,980
but if you're a talentless hack,

1049
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,020
there are other ways of writing exposition.

1050
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,480
In, say, Harry Potter,

1051
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,200
Harry is a person from our world

1052
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,240
learning about a much more magical one

1053
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,440
hidden behind his own,

1054
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,240
so the viewer is told how some things work

1055
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,620
by way of Harry learning

1056
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,860
because Harry doesn't know and needs to be told,

1057
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,260
so we get scenes where people tell Harry

1058
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,260
how the world works.

1059
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,100
Now, I personally think it's better

1060
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,100
to discover things without having a character

1061
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,820
just be told, but a lot of Harry Potter

1062
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,320
takes place at a school,

1063
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,440
so almost all interesting storytelling

1064
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,520
is kept to a minimum.

1065
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,120
Harry Potter isn't as good as when you read it as a child.

1066
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,280
The hottest take of 2014.

1067
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,540
The exposition in RWBY is, well,

1068
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,660
there's a character in the story called Jaune.

1069
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,700
Jaune Ark. Do you get it?

1070
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,080
Who inexplicably doesn't know basic elements

1071
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,300
of the setting he lives in,

1072
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,060
and at several points early in the story,

1073
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,660
another character takes him aside

1074
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,240
to tell him how things work.

1075
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,360
Do you know what aura is?

1076
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,820
For example, in an early scene,

1077
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,740
this character, Pyrrha, explains aura to him.

1078
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,700
She gives a long speech about how aura

1079
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,540
is a manifestation of your spiritual energy,

1080
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,080
nay, your soul.

1081
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,460
Basically, you have a shield for a while in fights

1082
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,920
like in Halo. I guess old habits die hard.

1083
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,180
Aura is the manifestation of our soul.

1084
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,100
It bears our burdens and shields our heart.

1085
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,460
Have you ever felt like you were being watched?

1086
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,800
Our aura can be our shield.

1087
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,220
Everyone has it, even anima.

1088
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,800
The monsters we fight lack a soul.

1089
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,140
Creatures' manifestation, they are the darkness.

1090
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,440
It's not about understanding.

1091
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,900
So start by wearing light.

1092
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,320
Just manifest our aura.

1093
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,640
Get it with everyone.

1094
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,360
It's like a force field!

1095
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,060
Okay, Miles, Kerry,

1096
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,560
you just made your whole audience

1097
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,480
sit through that exposition.

1098
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,780
You can't then make a joke about how simple

1099
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,080
the explanation could have been.

1100
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,900
Also, when you're doing exposition,

1101
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,500
you still have to think about the character

1102
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,820
who's saying it and why.

1103
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,540
You know, Pyrrha's a teenager.

1104
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,540
Young adults don't tend to walk around

1105
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,780
with entire speeches about how their world works

1106
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,460
prepared in case someone asks.

1107
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,740
That's just really strange characterization.

1108
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,660
It's also really strange writing-wise

1109
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,300
for Jaune to not know this.

1110
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,500
Jaune is the latest in a long line

1111
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,600
of heroic monster hunters and is in anime warrior school

1112
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,600
because he wants to live up to this legacy.

1113
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,140
My father, my grandfather, and his father before him

1114
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,140
were all warriors.

1115
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,140
They were all heroes.

1116
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,260
I wanted to be one too.

1117
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,940
There's no way he didn't, at some point,

1118
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,780
pick up this concept growing up or in training

1119
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,900
or, you know, it is a core aspect

1120
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,220
of, like, life in this world.

1121
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,560
Jaune's character not knowing is such poor characterization

1122
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,740
that it literally doesn't make sense.

1123
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:32,660
You know, in Harry Potter, Harry was a literal child

1124
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,540
who was deliberately sheltered from magic all his life,

1125
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,360
so his not knowing stuff was explained by the story.

1126
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,540
That's kind of the only way this expository style works.

1127
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,040
You have to incorporate them not knowing

1128
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,920
into the character or it doesn't make sense.

1129
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,340
If you want to explain one of the world's mechanics,

1130
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,780
it's not great to do it by having a character

1131
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,980
whose whole life revolves around knowing this information,

1132
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,460
not know it, and for the first person he ever asks about it

1133
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,820
to happen to have a speech prepared.

1134
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:02,580
Jaune's idiocy is often used to try to make hilarious jokes

1135
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,840
about man not know thing.

1136
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,580
There's no way I put my gear in locker 636 yesterday.

1137
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,460
I would have remembered having to count that high.

1138
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,720
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1139
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,000
But more than for a joke, it's also a vehicle

1140
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,760
for someone to have an excuse to give

1141
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,520
really straightforward sounding exposition for the audience.

1142
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,640
In the scene where Jaune first meets Pyrrha,

1143
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,360
Weiss tells him who Pyrrha is.

1144
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,320
This is Pyrrha. Hello again.

1145
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,740
Pyrrha graduated top of her class at Sanctum.

1146
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,740
Never heard of it.

1147
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,040
Do you know who Pyrrha is?

1148
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,460
Let me tell you and also the viewer who she is

1149
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,420
and list some of her accomplishments.

1150
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,300
She's won the Mistral Regional Tournaments

1151
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,540
four years in a row.

1152
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,000
A new record. The what?

1153
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,720
It's not just that Jaune's characterization suffers

1154
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,720
from him being written to be literally born yesterday.

1155
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,400
It's that everyone else's characterization suffers too

1156
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,560
when they essentially have to pause being their own characters

1157
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,680
in order to explain the story to someone.

1158
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,280
Pyrrha, in my opinion, is one of the most interesting characters

1159
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,660
in the show, but so much of the time she could have spent,

1160
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,780
like, being interesting or doing something interesting

1161
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,660
is spent obsessed with teaching Jaune everything

1162
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,960
he needs to know and how to fight.

1163
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,780
I've seen people call this show progressive and feminist

1164
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,920
because it has a lot of female main characters,

1165
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,460
but looking at how they're written,

1166
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,120
I don't think I can agree there.

1167
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:18,580
This strong female character is basically immediately reduced

1168
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,200
to doing all of the emotional and physical labor

1169
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,880
for this guy. A huge portion of the early show's

1170
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,120
screen time is dedicated not to the main characters of Ruby,

1171
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,760
who the show is named for, but to Jaune,

1172
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,460
the real main character getting trained and explained to

1173
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,720
and flirted with by Pyrrha, the coolest girl in school.

1174
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,260
Incidentally, Jaune is voiced by Miles Luna,

1175
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,140
the lead writer of the show.

1176
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,160
Hey, Pyrrha.

1177
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,460
What's up, girl? How you doing?

1178
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,160
She's so pretty.

1179
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,380
She's so pretty.

1180
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,760
She's so pretty.

1181
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,000
So even while having a comic relief character

1182
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
who doesn't know things he definitely would

1183
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,500
so people can explain it to him,

1184
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,020
the show is still struggling for good opportunities

1185
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,020
to explain the setting and plot.

1186
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:02,020
Luckily for exposition's sake, but not the viewers,

1187
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,600
they have, like Harry Potter, set a majority

1188
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,400
of the early show in a school so often the viewer

1189
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,480
is in a literal classroom being lectured to

1190
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,000
and no, it doesn't become fun when the characters

1191
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,460
in the scene are bored of it too.

1192
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,460
However, because they're trying to make

1193
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,160
the exposition naturalistic, you're also expected

1194
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,680
to immediately grasp multiple abstract concepts

1195
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,140
that aren't explained at all.

1196
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,100
Take, for example, semblances.

1197
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,100
What's a semblance?

1198
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,480
Okay, well, they're not magic.

1199
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,100
Something the show is very careful to explain

1200
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,780
is that they're not magic because people don't think

1201
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,320
magic is real in this setting.

1202
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,400
We have dust semblances, but I mean,

1203
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,320
there's no such thing as magic.

1204
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,360
To them, semblances are normal and magic

1205
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,280
would be really weird, but just for my own entertainment,

1206
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,500
three of the things I just showed you were semblances

1207
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,780
and one of them was magic.

1208
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,240
Good luck figuring out which is which

1209
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,620
without being explicitly told by the story.

1210
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:56,340
Every character in RWBY has one really unique special ability.

1211
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,800
Blake can leave shadow clones behind

1212
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,680
and use dust to augment their elemental abilities.

1213
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,460
Uh, Yang can go Super Saiyan

1214
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,560
and get more powerful when she's angry,

1215
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,560
but then later they re-explain that it's her getting stronger

1216
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,600
as she gets hurt more, like she channels the damage.

1217
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,340
With each hit, she gets stronger

1218
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,600
and she uses that energy to fight back.

1219
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,220
Then later they change it again

1220
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,640
to how it is her getting angry.

1221
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,980
Her father calls it basically a temper tantrum.

1222
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,680
Basically a temper tantrum.

1223
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,240
Oh, and then they change it back again in volume six.

1224
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,060
His semblance is like yours.

1225
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,740
He absorbs energy through his sword,

1226
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,360
stores it up, and then sends it back when he's ready.

1227
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,620
So if you're confused about how the main character's

1228
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,460
semblances actually work, it's okay.

1229
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,500
So were the writers.

1230
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,000
This isn't just me nitpicking.

1231
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,640
This lack of internal logic

1232
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,480
when it comes to something even as simple

1233
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,200
as one of our four main character's abilities

1234
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,480
makes the show very confusing to watch.

1235
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,820
When you're watching Yang fighting,

1236
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,040
you don't know whether to feel if she's actually in trouble

1237
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,160
or if she's waiting to unleash her power,

1238
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,000
and that means it's kind of hard to ever really know

1239
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,660
what level of danger one of your main characters is in,

1240
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,080
and that really sucks.

1241
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,300
Oh, also another expository problem

1242
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,420
is in this scene too.

1243
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,420
A guy who can move this quickly

1244
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,960
is currently fighting Yang.

1245
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,920
He's just off screen while this is happening.

1246
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,560
Did he stop so Blake can tell Yang his semblance?

1247
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,260
Is he just waiting for the exposition to finish?

1248
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,560
Listen, guys, I'm not trying to be mean,

1249
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,680
but, like, show one other person your script

1250
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,680
before you're done.

1251
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,520
Like, just show it to one person.

1252
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,520
Ruby's power is she can move really quickly

1253
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,660
and turns into a weird orb made of cloth

1254
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,320
and rose petals as she does it.

1255
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,040
Weiss can make symbols appear that either lock things

1256
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,080
in place or stick people to things,

1257
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,740
but also she can summon monsters?

1258
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,420
But this isn't magic. It's not magic.

1259
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,500
Glinda Goodwitch, yeah, really clever,

1260
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,040
can, well, she can basically do magic,

1261
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,800
like control things and shoot energy

1262
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,660
and put broken things back together

1263
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,000
and instantly kill monsters, but it's not magic,

1264
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,180
and Pyrrha is basically Magnet Man from the X-Men,

1265
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,800
so this is a totally cool thing

1266
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,180
to put in your fantasy setting.

1267
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,640
It's very shounen anime.

1268
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,520
It really fits. It's a fine idea.

1269
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,720
So how is this explained to you by the story?

1270
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,680
Well, uh, they don't.

1271
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,260
The intro doesn't mention it along with most things,

1272
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,220
and for the vast majority of the first season,

1273
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:08,520
it's not mentioned at all.

1274
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,020
You see some crazy magical-looking stuff

1275
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,600
happening, and you assume based on people's reactions

1276
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,940
that some people can do magic in this world,

1277
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:20,360
and that's fine, but then 14 episodes into the show,

1278
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,260
Pyrrha saves Jaune's life by manipulating his shield

1279
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,360
from afar with her Magnet Man powers,

1280
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,900
which we didn't know she had until this moment either,

1281
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,480
by the way, and all the other characters react to this

1282
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,400
as if it's a crazy unique thing.

1283
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,320
Uh, what?

1284
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:37,560
Despite tons of magical shit happening before that

1285
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,260
and one of the people in this scene

1286
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:43,060
surprised by Pyrrha's power can seemingly also do magic,

1287
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:45,100
and they have this conversation about it.

1288
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,480
How did you?

1289
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,320
Well, Ruby has her speed.

1290
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,440
You have your glyphs.

1291
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,060
My semblance is polarity.

1292
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,860
This is the first time in the show

1293
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,360
anyone has mentioned semblances.

1294
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,860
This just happens.

1295
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:05,060
Nobody watching the show knows what that word means yet.

1296
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:08,320
So then, bam, right as you're maybe getting to grips

1297
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,900
with everything else you've been told,

1298
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,200
brushed up on your in-show Ruby 101 classes,

1299
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,700
it turns out fundamental things you thought you knew

1300
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,560
about the setting, like that there's magic

1301
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,440
and that's fine, were lies,

1302
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,060
and actually every single character in the world

1303
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:25,940
has one unique thing they can do with its own special name

1304
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:28,820
that is explicitly not the same thing as magic,

1305
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,320
but just to fuck with you,

1306
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,700
magic does also exist in addition to all this.

1307
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,020
The idea's completely fine,

1308
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:37,400
but this is not how you convey it to an audience.

1309
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,660
This scene is supposed to be about

1310
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:41,020
Jaune's personal growth as a character,

1311
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:43,240
but instead, first-time viewers are gonna be going,

1312
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,740
hang on, what's a semblance?

1313
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,200
I thought people could just do magic.

1314
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,020
Imagine if the first time anyone said bending

1315
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:54,120
in Avatar the Last Airbender was 14 episodes in,

1316
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,480
but in addition, Pyrrha also specifically

1317
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,400
is keeping her semblance a secret.

1318
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,860
We gotta tell them what happened!

1319
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,940
We could...

1320
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:05,600
or perhaps we could just keep it our little secret.

1321
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,440
She doesn't broadcast her power,

1322
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,560
so it puts her opponents at a disadvantage.

1323
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,600
But then later when some other characters

1324
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,020
figure out what her power is,

1325
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:14,780
they call it by the same name.

1326
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,400
Her semblance is polarity.

1327
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,400
So it's a secret, but everyone knows

1328
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,600
the specific name of Pyrrha's ability

1329
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,100
without needing to be told it once they see her do it.

1330
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,520
What I'm trying to say is semblance is a kind

1331
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,760
of a semi-complicated concept to just drop on people.

1332
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,760
They don't have to be.

1333
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,480
There are tons of shows and anime

1334
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,100
where every character has a unique ability of some sort.

1335
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,520
There's this great narrative technique

1336
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,180
that a lot of anime utilizes nowadays

1337
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,940
where they explain what is happening in them.

1338
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,400
In JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,

1339
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,720
almost every main character has a power called a stand,

1340
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,020
but the way they introduce it is they have a character

1341
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,260
getting confused by these weird powers he has

1342
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:54,100
and then two other characters turn up

1343
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,300
to explain what a stand is to him so he gets it,

1344
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:01,180
thus helping to ensure that you also know how stands work

1345
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:04,980
so that the audience knows what's happening in the story.

1346
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,260
So, yeah, it's not like every character

1347
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,600
having a power is a bad story idea,

1348
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,300
but semblances are specifically made stranger

1349
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,220
by either the lack of exposition

1350
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,300
or the presence of incredibly confusing exposition.

1351
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,100
Like in volume five, they explain what semblances are

1352
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,680
to another character, presumably because they realized

1353
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,800
the audience had never been actually told

1354
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,920
what semblances were in the show for five seasons.

1355
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,600
Can you see the problem here?

1356
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,460
When these ideas and story components

1357
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,420
are being explained so strangely

1358
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,340
and it's taking seasons to correct,

1359
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,540
eventually the viewer either stops watching

1360
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,540
or stops caring about really understanding what's going on.

1361
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:44,920
They start to treat it like it's not really worth their time

1362
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,840
and tune it out while they wait for the next cool fight.

1363
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,180
Good exposition and proper conveyance of information

1364
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:54,500
are so important in stories, especially fantasy stories.

1365
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,420
If you do it in a boring way or do it badly

1366
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,680
or don't do it at all or explain only one thing

1367
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,420
in the introduction of your whole series

1368
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,640
and then it turns out not to be as big a plot point

1369
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,040
as you'd thought, the audience's experience

1370
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,840
of your potentially good story is damaged

1371
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,180
and it's really hard to get that goodwill back

1372
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,180
when you've lost it.

1373
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,840
I'm only realizing now,

1374
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,460
writing this video,

1375
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:20,040
exactly how cool Ruby's story could have been

1376
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,820
if it was written in a way that wasn't such a struggle

1377
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:23,940
to get to grips with.

1378
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,780
The show is having such a problem

1379
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:27,820
conveying its world that you have to watch

1380
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,740
another different show to learn basic shit.

1381
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:33,500
Despite spending tons of time sitting you down

1382
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,040
telling you how the world works,

1383
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,700
they still don't manage to tell you enough

1384
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,960
about the setting for you to be able to understand it,

1385
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,820
so they made a second companion show

1386
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,660
consisting entirely of lectures

1387
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,620
called, Ruby, World of Remnant.

1388
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:47,120
Everyone's favorite part of watching a cartoon.

1389
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,080
The homework, like what all the countries are

1390
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,360
and how they work,

1391
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,480
how Huntsman Academies work,

1392
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,520
and the basic history of the world

1393
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,360
along with the major mechanics of the show

1394
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,520
like what Grimm actually are,

1395
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,240
what Faunus are,

1396
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,940
how Aura works,

1397
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,520
what Assemblance is.

1398
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,980
Oh, and how could we forget

1399
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:08,740
the cross-continental transmit system?

1400
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,520
The creators seem to have realized

1401
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,320
that this isn't explained very well

1402
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,860
in the story that they wrote,

1403
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:17,220
so they essentially made a private personal Wikipedia

1404
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,900
to tell you what was happening.

1405
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,760
In the commentary track for volume two,

1406
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,400
they basically admit that World of Remnant exists

1407
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,020
to patch up all of these holes.

1408
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,180
We have the World of Remnant videos

1409
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,600
to kind of get, uh, some exposition across,

1410
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,260
um, as best we could.

1411
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,480
As best we could?

1412
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,640
Guys, no one was forcing you to write the story badly.

1413
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,520
They're even animated in the same style as the intro,

1414
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,260
effectively admitting the actual introduction

1415
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,560
didn't explain anything.

1416
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,400
If you watch through Ruby on Crunchyroll,

1417
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,680
which, uh, why?

1418
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,840
The World of Remnant episodes

1419
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,760
are scattered between the normal ones.

1420
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,800
They're genuinely telling you that the best way

1421
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,720
to experience Ruby is for the show

1422
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,060
to stop every now and then

1423
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,720
so that you can be told a few minutes

1424
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,440
of straight exposition.

1425
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,520
The World of Remnant is a dangerous place.

1426
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,180
It especially doesn't help that the explanations

1427
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,600
in World of Remnant aren't very good either.

1428
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,600
The World of Remnant episode about Grimm

1429
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,680
explains that we don't really know much about Grimm.

1430
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,980
Scientists perpetually find themselves

1431
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,480
with more questions than answers.

1432
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,940
Little else is known about the creatures of Grimm.

1433
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,020
Great. Thanks.

1434
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,060
The World of Remnant episode on Semblances

1435
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:23,180
tells us that every single Semblance

1436
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,800
is completely unique.

1437
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,940
The Wielder Semblance is completely unique.

1438
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:31,060
But then it turns out that Weiss's Semblance

1439
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:33,440
isn't unique and the Schnee family

1440
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,400
have the exact same Semblances

1441
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,060
like it's in their blood or something

1442
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,680
and her sister Winter can do the same things as her.

1443
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,920
Every Schnee has the ability to summon.

1444
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,260
We have for generations.

1445
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:45,640
So they're unique except when they're not.

1446
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,560
I'm glad there's a video explaining how this works,

1447
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,220
but it would also help if the explanation made sense

1448
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:54,260
and if it didn't just raise more questions also.

1449
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,840
We Schnees are unique.

1450
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,380
Unlike many, our Semblance is hereditary.

1451
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:01,880
Winter is telling this piece of information to her sister.

1452
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,760
She's one of the only other people

1453
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,800
who already knows this.

1454
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,420
This isn't how you write exposition!

1455
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,800
I don't want to be down on the concepts themselves here.

1456
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,160
The idea of Semblances and the idea of someone

1457
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,420
keeping their Semblance a secret to have an advantage

1458
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,580
or a Semblance that runs in the bloodline of a family

1459
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:18,840
and gives one of our leads a reputation to live up to

1460
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,960
are all decent things to put in a story

1461
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,500
and they could all potentially be really interesting,

1462
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,000
but for those things to be interesting,

1463
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,580
they have to be actually conveyed well

1464
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:30,200
and then used well in the story itself.

1465
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,120
A good idea isn't enough.

1466
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,840
The World of Remnant episode about the Schnee Dust Company

1467
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,700
largely covers the life and times

1468
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,740
of a really interesting-sounding character

1469
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,320
who we never see in the show

1470
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,660
and who never actually comes up by name ever.

1471
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,700
They just invented a cool guy and made up a story about him.

1472
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,440
You don't get story points because an idea sounded good.

1473
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,360
In fact, it just means you lose more points by wasting it.

1474
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,120
If you do watch all of RWBY and do enough research

1475
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,700
and ask around on the Reddit but only once you've consulted

1476
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,360
the wiki and watched World of Remnant,

1477
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,480
you might finally know what the story of RWBY

1478
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,820
was supposed to be and understand how cool

1479
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:08,640
so many aspects of the plot sound in the abstract,

1480
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,020
but you probably won't have had a good time.

1481
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,860
You can't just tell me how good the story

1482
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,640
or concepts might be in a side cartoon.

1483
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,860
You have to tell me a good story.

1484
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,060
If you try to get someone new into RWBY,

1485
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,780
pay attention to how much you have to explain things

1486
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:23,900
on the show's behalf.

1487
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,060
Even if you like the show and think it's good

1488
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,180
or at least gets good, thinking critically,

1489
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,060
we have to acknowledge that it certainly takes

1490
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:30,940
some getting there.

1491
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:33,320
It's especially disappointing when sometimes

1492
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,560
you can see the show setting things up quite well.

1493
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,220
When RWBY gets done beating up the Sterling squad,

1494
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,220
the bad guy manages to get away in a ship

1495
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,760
even though a new lady turns up to help RWBY stop him.

1496
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,100
I bring this up because, credit where it's due,

1497
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,520
there is some pretty good storytelling going on here.

1498
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,100
When this new character turns up and is wrecking shop,

1499
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,800
Malcolm McDowellboy says...

1500
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,140
["We got a huntress!"

1501
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,560
And this is a really good line

1502
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,940
because the audience is like,

1503
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,840
that sounds neat. What's that?

1504
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,300
I bet they're important, and then right after,

1505
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,880
RWBY reacts like meeting a huntress is really cool.

1506
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,700
["You're a huntress.

1507
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,700
Can I have your autograph?"

1508
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,740
This is a decently animated scene

1509
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,420
but also good exposition,

1510
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,420
especially compared to the rest of the show.

1511
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,000
We know that hunters are a big deal

1512
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,580
without having to be directly told

1513
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:20,160
who they are or what they do,

1514
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,040
based purely on seeing a guy react

1515
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,840
in a kind of panic to her appearance

1516
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,700
and how RWBY reacts herself.

1517
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:28,240
It's fun and cool and doesn't bog you down

1518
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,740
with explicit explanations,

1519
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:33,240
so the writing in this sequence specifically really works.

1520
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,400
That said, you fully learn what huntsmen

1521
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,900
and huntresses are by sitting in a classroom

1522
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,240
while they make a point about how this is boring

1523
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,240
and the other characters aren't paying attention.

1524
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,700
["Individuals who have sworn to protect

1525
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,060
those who cannot protect themselves."

1526
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:48,240
Oh, really? Wow, thanks.

1527
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,400
This scene was worth my time.

1528
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,160
Surely there's a more interesting way

1529
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,820
to explain things to your audience

1530
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:54,060
than with a lecture.

1531
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:55,700
Besides, that's what World of Remnants'

1532
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,980
huntsman episode is for.

1533
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,860
What this scene with Glinda implies to me

1534
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,600
is that someone on the writing team

1535
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,440
did know how to write exposition

1536
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,020
and his name was Monty Oum.

1537
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,800
The action scenes, the ones Monty had gone off to make

1538
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,380
while the writers wrote the other stuff,

1539
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:10,680
are consistently the most interesting examples

1540
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,100
of character writing and storytelling in the show.

1541
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,180
In volume two, our characters are so busy

1542
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,680
having drama or doing wacky skits

1543
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,100
to establish why these characters are actually friends.

1544
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,680
Did you steal my binder?

1545
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,980
I am not a crook.

1546
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:23,980
What are you talking about?

1547
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:25,340
You said a dog?

1548
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,020
And a male?

1549
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:29,180
But a few episodes in, we have this big fight

1550
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,340
where the team work together to beat a big mecha,

1551
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:34,200
and in this scene, Monty does all the characterization

1552
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,660
that could have happened in the show.

1553
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:36,960
The characters' team work,

1554
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,280
using each other's abilities in conjunction together,

1555
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,540
is choreographed and prepared in a way

1556
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,280
that shows the audience that these characters

1557
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,880
have learned to work together.

1558
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:49,200
Each move even gets called for by Ruby using a code word.

1559
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,200
Freezer burn!

1560
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,580
Checkmate!

1561
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:52,920
Ladybug!

1562
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,880
Blastoise!

1563
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,120
We have to slow it down!

1564
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,920
And how do you propose we do that?

1565
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,420
Ice flowers!

1566
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,200
Showing that she's grown and learned

1567
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,780
to direct the team she's leading.

1568
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:04,960
The audience can finally tell that these characters

1569
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,780
have a really intimate knowledge of each other

1570
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,620
and their skills.

1571
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,700
These names were actually chosen by Monty

1572
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,580
as a reference to the ship names

1573
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,500
the fandom had come up with for the characters.

1574
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,380
What's a ship?

1575
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,200
Uh.

1576
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,420
Sorry, that wasn't meant to signify

1577
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:17,500
my feelings on the subject.

1578
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,280
Well, a ship is a thing fan discussions of media

1579
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:23,580
end up doing when fans want or predict characters

1580
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,920
to end up in a relationship together.

1581
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,740
Sometimes creators make subtle nods

1582
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:29,160
to these communities in their work,

1583
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,360
like in Steven Universe.

1584
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,360
That one time they had a literal ship

1585
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,520
with two characters on it.

1586
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,280
Referencing the ship names is a little bit creepy.

1587
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,280
Ruby is, like, 15, you know?

1588
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,940
Ruby Rose is a 15-year-old girl.

1589
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,440
But at least let's take careful note

1590
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,600
of how Ruby and Yang are the only pair

1591
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,280
that don't do a team attack here

1592
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,660
because that would mean acknowledging

1593
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,940
the part of your fandom that came up with a ship name

1594
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,940
for two half-siblings, which is fucking disgusting.

1595
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,320
In addition to being a really cool Monty fight,

1596
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,740
we're seeing our main characters in action as a group

1597
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:00,520
and learning about how they've grown together

1598
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,520
between seasons.

1599
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,860
Would have been nice to see them grow

1600
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:06,320
in the actual show, but credit where it's due.

1601
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,140
It's well-conveyed exposition.

1602
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,860
You might not even notice you're learning

1603
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,680
about the characters because you're watching them

1604
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,940
beat up a giant robot.

1605
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:13,820
It's a good scene.

1606
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:15,520
Like, that's the thing about early Ruby.

1607
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,320
It'll just keep inexplicably having good scenes

1608
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,020
that are either super fun to watch

1609
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,980
or work way better story-wise than anything around them,

1610
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,900
and usually it's the action sequences

1611
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,560
which somehow manage to outright the writing

1612
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,640
of the scenes the writers came up with.

1613
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,640
Here's another example.

1614
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,060
As we've mentioned, the bad guys

1615
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:34,140
finding out Pyrrha's semblance is a big deal,

1616
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:36,640
but since this discovery is made during a fight,

1617
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,920
it's done really well using animation and artistry.

1618
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,840
Mercury has a sparring match with Pyrrha

1619
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,460
and the action is shot to focus specifically

1620
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,340
on the attention Mercury is paying

1621
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:47,760
to how she moves and fights,

1622
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,460
like he's trying to figure her out.

1623
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:52,040
Then when she tries to stealthily use her semblance

1624
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:55,000
to avoid one of his attacks, he notices what she's doing.

1625
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
It was actually animated by Shane Neuville

1626
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:58,780
whose grasp of using animation

1627
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,480
to tell a story is really good.

1628
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,480
In the director's commentary track for this scene,

1629
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,160
the whole team can't not gush about the work he does.

1630
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,360
Was this Shane? This is all Shane.

1631
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,940
Yeah. This is all Shane layering

1632
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:09,400
in that tiny little stuff where it's like

1633
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,660
he got the tone of the fight.

1634
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,400
He knew what this was about. Yeah, man.

1635
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,740
The way they were able to read each other

1636
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,200
and the movements. Barring the kicks

1637
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,660
and flips and everything, it's just there's so much

1638
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,040
going on, like, in the performance.

1639
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,400
It's like a silent dialogue scene.

1640
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,540
Oh, my god. I love this.

1641
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:21,740
We're looking at their faces

1642
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:23,740
and seeing them examine things.

1643
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:26,200
It's a really strongly characterized scene

1644
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,860
Also, I got that reference.

1645
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:30,600
Good one, Shane. Compare and contrast

1646
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,440
with when the bad guys actually discuss Pyrrha's power

1647
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,060
and they're just sitting around going,

1648
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:37,240
oh, she can control magnets.

1649
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,160
It's called polarity which I also know somehow.

1650
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,200
Like, it's so weird that really well-told scenes

1651
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,360
are right next to this.

1652
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,120
Scenes made by Monty and Shane feel like pieces

1653
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,280
of a much better or at least better told show

1654
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:53,700
trapped next to this stuff and outside of the fights,

1655
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:56,200
the animation is, well...

1656
00:58:58,700 --> 00:58:59,700
Cut it out!

1657
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:00,700
I'm gonna get him!

1658
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:01,700
Oh!

1659
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:02,700
Come on!

1660
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,700
We have big plans for you, Roman.

1661
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:10,200
The fuck? Is that just fucking concept art?

1662
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,700
If you want to really unproductively hate Ruby

1663
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,700
all day forever, you know, if for some reason

1664
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,940
you've decided it's your job to be angry

1665
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:20,120
and sad all your life, there's tons of animation problems

1666
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,700
or ugly sequences or shots to poke fun at

1667
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,200
but talking about them in this video

1668
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:27,200
seems like a distraction because the show looking perfect

1669
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,200
wouldn't fix its core writing and storytelling problems

1670
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,500
and I've enjoyed much worse looking shows

1671
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,200
because they told a better story.

1672
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,700
The biggest problem with the show isn't the animation

1673
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:37,700
surrounding these fights.

1674
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,700
It's the story surrounding these fights.

1675
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,700
It's the way these fights are being connected

1676
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:44,040
or rather not connected by the writing.

1677
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,700
A useful thing to know is that while working

1678
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,200
on Red vs. Blue, the script would have gaps in it

1679
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,200
marked Monty action sequence here.

1680
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:53,200
I would then find places in that script,

1681
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,200
places within between the lines in that table read

1682
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,200
and start inserting my sequences in the parts

1683
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,200
where Bernie's script would say

1684
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,700
Monty action sequence here.

1685
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,200
Red vs. Blue had a script but how exactly

1686
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,700
the fights looked was entirely up to Monty

1687
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,700
since he was the best at deciding that stuff.

1688
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,200
While the rest of the show was being made

1689
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,200
in the traditional machinima style

1690
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,200
in the Halo games themselves, Monty was making

1691
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,700
the best possible fight he could and these pieces

1692
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:19,200
of the show joined together at the end of this process

1693
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,200
pretty organically.

1694
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,200
Early RWBY was made using a fairly similar principle.

1695
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,700
The three main creators had agreed on the story

1696
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,700
in the broad strokes and then Monty was doing

1697
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:30,200
the fights in the same way but with the writers

1698
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,200
actually writing out the plot they'd agreed upon

1699
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,700
while Monty was making the action sequences.

1700
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,700
To give an example, the first fight takes place

1701
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:39,200
in a street environment so they wrote the dust store robbery

1702
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,200
and then as quickly as possible moved the events outside

1703
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:45,200
to connect with the street fight and then up to the rooftops

1704
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,700
to connect to another Monty fight.

1705
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,200
You can see this in the version of the show

1706
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,200
on the DVD extras where they show episode one

1707
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,200
with the storyboards.

1708
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,200
Everything the main crew were working on

1709
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,700
had been written and had storyboards

1710
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,700
so the animators knew what visuals to go for

1711
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,700
and then when Monty's cool fights are happening,

1712
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,200
the storyboard is just a black card that reads

1713
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,700
Monty action and given what his fights were like,

1714
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:06,200
three exclamation marks is appropriate.

1715
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,700
The we got a Huntress part I praised earlier

1716
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:11,700
was also a Monty action sequence on the storyboard

1717
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:14,200
so it's likely Monty came up with the idea

1718
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,200
to have Torchwick say words to this effect

1719
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,700
and not the writers whose best idea

1720
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:20,200
for conveying what a Huntress is

1721
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,200
is to have a professor tell our Huntresses in training

1722
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,700
in a classroom as if they've never been told before

1723
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,700
even though they're going to a school for Huntresses

1724
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,700
and then to write a side cartoon telling you again.

1725
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,200
In another good example when the characters

1726
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,700
are being tested in the woods,

1727
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,700
the characters all get their individual plot lines

1728
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,200
and then when it's time for the big Monty fight

1729
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,200
designed to happen at this point in the story,

1730
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,200
we get this insert shot of the characters running

1731
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,200
to the specific location where Monty's fight was done.

1732
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,200
Now this is one of the standout action sequences

1733
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,200
of Monty's career. It's really good.

1734
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,200
It's one of my favorite animated sequences

1735
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,200
in basically anything. It's just great

1736
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:56,200
but really disappointingly due to some strange writing choices,

1737
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,200
it doesn't actually connect to the story

1738
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,200
that was just happening because the gang's plan

1739
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,200
at this point was to run away

1740
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,200
from the big monsters attacking them.

1741
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,200
There's no point in fighting these things.

1742
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,700
Run and live.

1743
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,200
That is an idea I can get behind.

1744
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,200
But as soon as Monty fight mode begins,

1745
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,700
it's like they were leading them here

1746
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,200
to have a proper place to fight them.

1747
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,200
I'm assuming Monty and the writers had decided

1748
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,200
on this fight in a very broad way

1749
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,700
like during the trial the gang fights some giant monsters

1750
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,700
and it's really cool and Monty made this fight

1751
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,200
thinking the writers would come up with an explanation

1752
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,200
but the explanation ended up being,

1753
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,700
let's run away.

1754
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,200
There's no point in fighting these things.

1755
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,200
Ah, I don't know how to make this clear enough.

1756
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:37,700
That is the one thing that you do not write

1757
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:41,200
immediately before cutting to a fight against them

1758
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,200
and the worst part is this is probably

1759
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,700
the most seamless connection between the story

1760
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,700
and action the show manages to do

1761
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:49,700
because you can at least, like, assume

1762
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:51,700
that their means of escape got cut off

1763
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,700
or they got too close and they had to fight

1764
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,200
but when they have several characters agree to run away

1765
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,200
and they say they're going to run away,

1766
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,200
having them just kind of stop, it's very strange.

1767
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,200
Another really strange thing you start to notice

1768
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,200
when you try and keep track of how the fights

1769
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,700
are being connected is that character arcs seem to start

1770
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,700
and then suddenly stop on a whim.

1771
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,700
When the characters get sorted into teams,

1772
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,700
Ruby is made the leader of Team Ruby

1773
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:16,200
and this annoys Weiss who thinks Ruby isn't very smart

1774
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,200
or good and who she argued with a lot during the test

1775
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,700
but then during the test, Weiss decided to be nicer?

1776
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:24,700
I'll be...nicer.

1777
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,200
But she's mad again now because she wanted to be the leader.

1778
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,700
This seems like it's going to set up

1779
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,200
interesting character tensions,

1780
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,700
maybe a developing friendship

1781
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,700
with emotional speed bumps along the way

1782
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,700
but it's resolved instantly when Weiss complains

1783
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:37,200
to a professor and they say,

1784
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,200
That's preposterous.

1785
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,200
And Weiss decides to be nice.

1786
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,200
I am going to be the best teammate you will ever have.

1787
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,200
I'll be...nicer.

1788
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,200
Problem solved.

1789
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,200
Writing!

1790
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,200
Like, all Weiss needed was for a man in a position

1791
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,200
of authority to give her a good telling off.

1792
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,200
Your exceptional skill on the battlefield

1793
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,200
is matched only by your poor attitude.

1794
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,200
Just so you know, Weiss' main character arc

1795
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,200
is about her relationship with her abusive

1796
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,700
and controlling father so the idea this is what she needed

1797
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:06,200
is actually kind of gross.

1798
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,200
Me, personally, I still don't see it as a big deal.

1799
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,200
I'm just like, I don't see them as like,

1800
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,200
these are four females that are awesome.

1801
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,200
I'm like, no, these are just four cool kids that are fun.

1802
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,200
Can't really think of any moment really

1803
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,200
where we sat down and we're like, okay,

1804
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,200
this is happening or we want this to happen

1805
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,200
because they are female.

1806
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,200
Yeah, no, it's always just been like,

1807
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,200
it's just like, they're four people.

1808
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,200
They're awkward teenagers.

1809
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,200
Hey, hashtag RWBY fans.

1810
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,200
Have you heard?

1811
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,700
Yang Xiaolong is going to fight Tifa Lockhart.

1812
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,200
My money's on the hot one.

1813
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,200
All right, so we've got Yang Xiaolong.

1814
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,200
She is the bubbly one on the bunch.

1815
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,200
She's just so happy.

1816
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,200
She's the party girl.

1817
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,200
She's, you know, pretty much everything

1818
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,200
everybody wants in a girl.

1819
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,200
So they brought back the interesting character conflict

1820
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:49,200
of the test then re-resolved it right away.

1821
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,200
This is like watching a learner driver stall their car.

1822
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,200
Like, come on, you almost got a story going.

1823
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,200
Just, just keep going at it.

1824
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,200
Immediately after having a character

1825
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,200
just give up on what their character arc should have been,

1826
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,200
the plot suddenly switches gears

1827
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,200
and focuses on someone else.

1828
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,200
Wait, gears?

1829
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,200
And then it was the stall the car thing.

1830
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,200
Was that a deliberate metaphor?

1831
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,200
No, that was an accident. I'm sorry.

1832
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,200
Thus begins the Xion arc.

1833
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,200
A big portion of volume one,

1834
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,200
four of the show's first 16 episodes,

1835
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,200
is about how Xion actually forged

1836
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,200
his anime college transcript to get into this school

1837
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:21,200
which makes him the deepest character we've met so far.

1838
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,200
Wow, who'd have thought?

1839
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,200
And then he gets bullied by a generic mean guy

1840
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,200
who threatens to tell people his secret

1841
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,200
and get him kicked out,

1842
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,200
but then he stands up to him

1843
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,200
and saves him from a big grim,

1844
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,200
and now he respects him so he won't share his secret.

1845
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,200
That's the solution to bullying, kids.

1846
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,200
Save them from a monster

1847
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,200
and maybe they'll leave you alone

1848
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,200
out of respect.

1849
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,200
Xion finally asks Pyrrha for the help

1850
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,200
she was offering him

1851
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,200
instead of pointlessly refusing it,

1852
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,200
and it becomes kind of clear

1853
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,200
Pyrrha's working really hard on this guy

1854
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,200
because she's into him for some reason.

1855
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,200
This multi-episode break

1856
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,200
from covering any of the main characters of RWBY?

1857
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,200
You know, it's in the name.

1858
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,200
To focus on one of the lead writer's characters

1859
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,200
certainly seems strange,

1860
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,200
but what makes the pace even stranger

1861
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,200
is that once those episodes are done,

1862
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,200
there are two episodes left

1863
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,200
and they have to now connect the story

1864
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,200
to this final fight scene in a shipyard starring,

1865
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,200
and I can't stress this enough,

1866
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:12,200
two characters who have not yet appeared in the show.

1867
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,200
Oops!

1868
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,200
So the next episode starts and, uh,

1869
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,200
here's Sun. He's here now.

1870
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,200
And then while chasing him,

1871
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,200
the gang randomly runs into,

1872
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,200
no, literally runs into Penny,

1873
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,200
the other character who they forgot to put in earlier

1874
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,200
because there was just nothing you could have cut

1875
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,200
to establish these characters sooner.

1876
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,200
This pure gold just has to stay in.

1877
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,200
So now these characters are here just in time

1878
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,200
for the climactic fight.

1879
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,200
Sun's stick that turns into nunchucks

1880
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,200
that are also guns is so fun to watch.

1881
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,200
It's just amazing.

1882
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,200
However, because of the frankly bizarre pacing

1883
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,200
caused by the show's production,

1884
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,200
I have barely any idea who most

1885
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,200
of the characters involved even are,

1886
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,200
which affects my engagement somewhat.

1887
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,200
It's a really cool scene,

1888
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,200
but it feels very disconnected

1889
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,200
from the rest of the story.

1890
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,200
Now, exactly how this problem got here

1891
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:01,200
isn't something it feels fair to speculate about too hard.

1892
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,200
I'm sure you could easily conclude that the three

1893
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,200
agreed on a story and then the writers just messed up,

1894
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,200
making the plot feel like a cohesive hole

1895
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,200
with the action sequences, and writing-wise,

1896
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,200
the show feels very idiosyncratic

1897
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,200
and self-conscious, like it's looking for something

1898
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,200
to spend its time doing before the next fight

1899
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,200
and therefore misspending the time

1900
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,200
that would have added context and character

1901
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,200
to those fights until it's too late

1902
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,200
to really do that stuff properly,

1903
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,200
but at the same time, some behind-the-scenes material

1904
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,200
and panels and stuff seem to imply that Monty went away

1905
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,200
and then came back with new characters

1906
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,200
and action sequences for them and dropped it

1907
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,200
on Miles and Kerry with little to no notice.

1908
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,200
However this disconnect got here,

1909
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,200
it's not very good and relates

1910
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,200
to some serious production problems.

1911
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,200
Like, if your main creative leads aren't on the same page

1912
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,200
about what's happening in the story,

1913
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,200
the story's probably not gonna wind up very good,

1914
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,200
and also the way a huge swath of the show

1915
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,200
isn't about Team RWBY

1916
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,200
and their plot line evaporates

1917
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,200
to make way for the adventures of some guy,

1918
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,200
the writers don't seem to be handling

1919
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,200
the story they did know they were supposed to do

1920
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,200
that well either.

1921
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,200
It certainly doesn't make it look any better

1922
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,200
that the guy is voiced by one of them.

1923
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,200
Oh, and then in volume two,

1924
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,200
they correct for this problem

1925
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,200
by adding a second author insert?

1926
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,200
Uh...

1927
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,200
So a guy called Neptune turns up.

1928
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,200
He's a really cool, attractive guy who wears goggles,

1929
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,200
and they make a point of showing how wise

1930
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,200
is into him, like, right away.

1931
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,200
Let's not assume that this is, like, author insert

1932
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,200
wish fulfillment or whatever.

1933
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,200
Like, let's assume they just came up with this character

1934
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,200
and then Kerry Shawcross decided to voice him.

1935
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,200
Like, hey, if you're writing a whole show,

1936
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,200
you should get to voice one of the characters.

1937
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,200
That's fine.

1938
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,200
But come on.

1939
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,200
It was really weird that you picked Neptune, man.

1940
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:34,200
This character gets into love triangle stuff

1941
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,200
with a bunch of young female characters

1942
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,200
who you write,

1943
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,200
so it just feels weird,

1944
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,200
and then this character hangs out a bunch with Yang.

1945
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,200
You know.

1946
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,200
Pretty much everything everybody wants in a girl.

1947
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,200
Oh, what a woman.

1948
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,200
Uh, she's 17, so...

1949
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:53,200
And yeah, in volume two, the plot pauses itself

1950
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,200
for a shockingly long amount of time

1951
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,200
to have an arc where our characters prepare

1952
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,200
for the school prom and figure out who's inviting who

1953
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,200
because Weiss wants to go with Neptune

1954
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,200
but Jaune wants to go with Weiss

1955
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,200
but Pyrrha wants to go with Jaune

1956
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,200
and she can't bring herself to ask it,

1957
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,200
so whenever something in the show happens

1958
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,200
that's really strangely explained

1959
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,200
and you wish got, like, told to you better,

1960
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,200
remember that they had time to do it

1961
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,200
and spent it writing scenes

1962
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,200
where the two characters voiced by them

1963
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,200
hang out at a prom.

1964
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,200
Hey, guys, you know when you were talking

1965
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,200
about needing to get exposition across as best you could?

1966
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,200
Put it here.

1967
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,200
Put naturalistic exposition in the scenes

1968
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,200
where this fucking prom would have gone.

1969
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,200
The prom stuff isn't even necessarily bad either.

1970
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,200
It's nice seeing the sweet dance animations

1971
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,200
Monty did for it.

1972
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,200
He was a big fan of animating dancing along with fights

1973
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,200
and it's cool seeing this stuff in RWBY too

1974
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,200
and a lot of the character and relationship stuff

1975
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:42,200
happening in the prom scenes is, like, fine.

1976
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,200
The problem with the scene is even if it's perfect,

1977
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,200
it's yet another thing that's happening

1978
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,200
instead of a story.

1979
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,200
It just becomes aggravating knowing

1980
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,200
you're watching all of this and basically still waiting

1981
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,200
for the plot to start again,

1982
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,200
and you know how it starts again?

1983
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,200
Well, right at the end of the episode

1984
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,200
before the final two of the season,

1985
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:01,200
the ground suddenly opens up under Ruby's feet

1986
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:04,200
and she falls into the plot.

1987
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,200
Watching this show knowing that it had a creative lead

1988
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:09,200
and two writers and the plot consisted

1989
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:12,200
of a bunch of people fucking about going to the prom

1990
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:15,200
and not doing much else for most of the season?

1991
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,200
Like, seriously, what were you doing?

1992
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,200
It turns out there's an entire dead

1993
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,200
underground civilization the bad guy

1994
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:24,200
and his goons are doing an evil plan in

1995
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:26,200
but the next fights that Monty was making

1996
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:29,200
were a series of fights on and in a train

1997
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,200
riffing on the ideas he'd had during the black trailer

1998
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:34,200
and those scenes are supposed to happen now

1999
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,200
so the dead, destroyed civilization

2000
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,200
that Ruby just fell into

2001
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,200
has a working rail network with a train in it.

2002
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,200
This is another instance of there's no point

2003
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,200
in fighting these things.

2004
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,200
Like, instead of the plot leading organically

2005
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,200
into the fights on the train,

2006
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,200
the train is just there

2007
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,200
when it needs to be in the story.

2008
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:54,200
I feel like there might have been a slightly easier way

2009
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,200
of getting the characters onto a train.

2010
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,200
That's all I'm saying, but once we get there,

2011
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,200
the actual action sequences on the train

2012
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:01,200
are really well done.

2013
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,200
Monty and Shane and the rest of the team

2014
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:05,200
do some really stellar work here.

2015
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,200
Oh!

2016
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,200
The Zwei scene from yesterday was Shane Neuville's idea.

2017
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,200
Blame him. Thank you, Shane.

2018
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,200
That scene was amazing.

2019
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:19,200
Oh, and thank you, Harley Dwartz

2020
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,200
who Shane says helped.

2021
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:24,200
This is the second best shot in the entire show ever

2022
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,200
of all time.

2023
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,200
Ha ha! Do you get it? Do you get it?

2024
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,200
And I wish the writing and story had the kind of energy

2025
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,200
the animators were capable of manifesting.

2026
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,200
There is this one really cool fight

2027
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:36,200
between Yang and Neo, a character fans love

2028
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,200
because her deal is she doesn't talk

2029
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:40,200
and therefore cannot be ruined by the writers.

2030
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,200
She actually beats Yang,

2031
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,200
and then a strange warrior woman

2032
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,200
we don't know at all turns up to protect her,

2033
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:48,200
and Neo is so fuck-off scared of whoever this lady is

2034
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,200
that she's like, nope, peace out,

2035
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,200
and then the lady leaves.

2036
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,200
It's really cool and mysterious,

2037
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,200
but there is one teeny issue with this scene,

2038
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:59,200
and that's the really good music that plays during it.

for what's going on with this character

2043

and what her deal is.

2044
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,200
This track is also the best piece of music

that Jeff Williams didn't make.

2046
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,200
Well, that's not fair to say. That's kind of mean,

2047
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,200
but when I first heard this song,

2048
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,200
I couldn't get it out of my head,

2049
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,200
and I realized that I couldn't

2050
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,200
because I'd heard it a bunch somewhere else before,

2051
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,200
and then I remembered that I spent most of 2014

2052
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,200
listening to the soundtrack to the Godzilla movie

2053
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,200

and they rebuilt him into Midi-Godzilla.

Now, I'm not saying this is plagiarism or anything.

2058

These songs are just incredibly similar

2059
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,200
because they're both very generic,

2060
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,200
but I do kind of secretly hope that they got the idea

2061
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,200
from the Godzilla movie because I love finding

2062

other secret Godzilla fans out there.

01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,200
This character, the bunny girl

2117
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,200
who appeared very briefly in season one,

2118
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:59,200
her name is Velvet.

2119
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,200
She has a weird case that's got her weapon hidden in it,

2120
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,200
and when she goes to use it in the fight,

2121
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,200
her leader, who's a name I had to Google

2122
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,200
because I don't think we're told it until the next season,

2123
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,200
no, I'm not gonna tell you what it is,

2124
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,200
says...

2125
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,200
Hey, come on.

2126
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:14,200
You spent all semester building that up.

2127
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,200
Don't waste it here.

2128
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,200
...and proceeds to do all the killing herself

2129
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:20,200
with her cool minigun bag thing.

2130
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,200
It's great.

2131
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,200
This line is meant to be, like,

2132
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:25,200
a funny nod to the audience, right?

2133
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,200
Like, we've been building that up for ages.

2134
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,200
Let's not waste it now.

2135
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,200
It's meant to be a funny joke,

2136
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,200
but the problem is that joke requires the setup

2137
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:35,200
of us having seen that Velvet has a weapon

2138
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,200
and wanting to find out what it is,

2139
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,200
but because the story's writing has been so mismanaged,

2140
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:43,200
Velvet has been on screen for literally seconds

2141
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,200
in the show so far.

2142
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,200
The clip of Velvet you're seeing right now,

2143
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:49,200
this is her only appearance in volume two.

2144
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,200
She just walked off screen, right?

2145
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,200
She's gone. That's it.

2146
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:52,200
See you in the climax.

2147
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,200
So all we get is this scene of the group

2148
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,200
leaving for a mission and another character

2149
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,200
mentioning they sure have been away

2150
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,200
on that mission for a while.

2151
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:02,200
Team Coffee's away mission lasted longer than expected.

2152
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:05,200
We don't know who this character is.

2153
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,200
The joke about Velvet's weapon combined with her

2154
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,200
and her team's sparse appearance in the show

2155
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,200
despite saving the day at the end

2156
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,200
is perhaps the clearest look

2157
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,200
into the early show's production problems.

2158
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,200
Was this scene planned in advance

2159
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:19,200
and then the writers didn't have room

2160
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,200
to give Team Coffee a place in the story

2161
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:23,200
because there was already too many characters to handle

2162
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,200
and all the prom stuff?

2163
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:27,200
Did Monty and co. suddenly drop the climactic fight

2164
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,200
on the rest of the creators at the last minute

2165
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,200
and then they had to scramble

2166
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,200
to give it any sort of last minute justification?

2167
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:35,200
Did the creative leads all mutually agree

2168
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,200
that the best way to end a season of the show

2169
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:40,200
was for it to star a bunch of random new characters?

2170
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,200
I don't know, and it doesn't feel right to speculate,

2171
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,200
but I do know that the way things are

2172
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,200
means the story sucks.

2173
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,200
The plot scenes of the show feel so weightless

2174
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:49,200
and contribute so little to the thing

2175
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,200
that really works, the fights,

2176
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,200
that the story ends up being basically an afterthought.

2177
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,200
I do have to say, though, it does look like

2178
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,200
at some point in the production process

2179
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,200
Team Coffee, or at least Velvet,

2180
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,200
were meant to play a larger role in the show

2181
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,200
and there is evidence that suggests this.

2182
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:06,200
The behind-the-scenes production diaries for volume two

2183
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:09,200
spend a lot of time specifically covering

2184
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,200
the creation and development of Velvet.

2185
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:12,200
So we thought we would introduce you

2186
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,200
to the various parts of the production pipeline

2187
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,200
by following the supporting character of Velvet

2188
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,200
that we introduced in volume one

2189
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,200
and follow her from concept to modeling

2190
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,200
and how she comes to life in the recording booth

2191
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,200
and in the animation and in the edit.

2192
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,200
They sifted through hundreds of fan submissions.

2193
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,200
Over 1,300 submissions.

2194
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:31,200
We see the modelers and rigging and artists

2195
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:32,200
working on her and her weapons.

2196
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,200
We see the effort that goes into designing

2197
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:35,200
the case for her cool weapon,

2198
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,200
but we don't want to spoil what's in it.

2199
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,200
So this is what her weapon's gonna be in.

2200
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,200
We're not showing the weapon yet,

2201
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,200
because you're not gonna see that yet.

2202
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,200
But we need something for her to carry it in.

2203
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,200
You know, as if to imply that at some point in the show,

2204
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:49,200
we would see Velvet have a box with the weapon in it

2205
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,200
and people go, ooh, what's in it?

2206
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,200
And she'd be like, ah, you'll see.

2207
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,200
We meet the voice actress, all of this stuff.

2208
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:57,200
Hours and hours of multiple artists

2209
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:00,200
putting time and attention into creating this character

2210
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:02,200
and all of this work goes into the creation

2211
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:06,200
of a character who, due to some kind of natural disaster,

2212
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:10,200
is on screen for, like, 30 seconds maximum

2213
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:13,200
and does nothing just to give you a sense

2214
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:16,200
of how miserably mismanaged the writing was.

2215
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:19,200
Velvet is speaking for about 14 seconds

2216
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,200
of volume two of RWBY.

2217
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,200
I just showed you all of it.

2218
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,200
The interview with the voice actress

2219
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,200
in the behind-the-scenes material is longer than that.

2220
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:30,200
I think volume two might have needed a second draft.

2221
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:33,200
This fight is technically really cool looking

2222
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,200
and I really enjoy the animation,

2223
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,200
especially this bit where the Grimm's legs flip out,

2224
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,200
but imagine how much better the scene would have felt

2225
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,200
if you knew who these characters were

2226
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:45,200
or if this fight felt at all like part of a story,

2227
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,200
you know?

2228
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,200
It turns out that even compared to Machinima,

2229
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:51,200
making an animated series is, like, really hard.

2230
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,200
A whole ton of people have to work together

2231
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:56,200
as part of a huge process to get this thing made.

2232
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:59,200
And RWBY is a higher level of production

2233
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,200
than any other show we've ever produced.

2234
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:03,200
And if the process isn't being managed very well

2235
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,200
or the big picture ideas aren't there,

2236
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,200
then the resulting show suffers massively.

2237
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,200
There are tons of scenes in the show

2238
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,200
that are fairly decent, especially the fights,

2239
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,200
but because of issues with putting the show together,

2240
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:16,200
the result is a show that's less than the sum of its parts

2241
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:20,200
and what feels like two full seasons of teething problems.

2242
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,200
You know, there are lots of shows with, like,

2243
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:24,200
fun fights to watch like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

2244
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,200
which I brought up earlier,

2245
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:27,200
but the thing about those shows is

2246
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,200
even when I remember the really cool fights,

2247
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,200
I go back and watch entire episodes

2248
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,200
or arcs of the show again.

2249
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,200
I don't just go like,

2250
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,200
oh, remember that fight? That fight's good.

2251
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,200
Let's just watch that out of context.

2252
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,200
Like, no, the storytelling is part

2253
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,200
of what accentuates those scenes.

2254
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,200
Fights in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure feel meaningful

2255
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,200
because they've been built up to by the plot.

2256
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:46,200
Monty's fights are still some of the coolest fights,

2257
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,200
but they're never gonna have the impact they could have done

2258
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,200
because either due to a lack of planning

2259
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:53,200
of what the story would be or very poor writing choices

2260
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,200
being made in connecting his action sequences,

2261
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:58,200
the story these fights should have been a part of

2262
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,200
is practically non-existent,

2263
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,200
and honestly, it just seems like such a waste, you know?

2264
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,200
So far we've mostly talked about the production

2265
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,200
and execution angle of RWBY,

2266
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,200
the telling of the story, the conveyance of the world,

2267
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,200
and how well the writers incorporated

2268
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:11,200
the action sequences,

2269
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,200
but now we need to dig one layer deeper

2270
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:16,200
and discuss the story they're trying to tell.

2271
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,200
Remember that first fight in the dust store

2272
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:21,200
and how I talked about how it is kind of a good idea

2273
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,200
for an introductory scene?

2274
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,200
Because introducing your protagonist

2275
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,200
by having them stop a robbery is a good idea

2276
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,200
for an opening.

2277
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,200
In fact, it's a good intro

2278
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,200
in the movie they got this idea from.

2279
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,200
Oh, plot twist!

2280
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,200
["Planet of the Apes"]

2281
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:35,200
["Planet of the Apes"]

2282
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,200
Cowboy Bebop is a great anime.

2283
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,200
It's a 26-episode series,

2284
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,200
and it also has a feature-length movie.

2285
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,200
In the movie, they reintroduce

2286
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,200
the main characters from the show

2287
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,200
by having there be a convenience store

2288
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,200
getting held up at gunpoint,

2289
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,200
and Spike, the main character,

2290
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,200
comes in with headphones on and shops around

2291
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,200
pretending he can't tell what's going on

2292
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,200
before expertly taking them all out

2293
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,200
with some backup from his friend.

2294
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,200
This is a really good opening scene.

2295
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,200
The problem with RWBY is that its writers

2296
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,200
didn't seem to know why it was a good opening.

2297
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,200
This opening works well in the movie

2298
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,200
because it takes the opportunity

2299
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,200
to tell us about our characters

2300
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,200
and how they think.

2301
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,200
Spike tells a guy holding an old woman hostage

2302
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,200
that he doesn't care if he shoots her.

2303
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,200
Sorry, lady, but we don't protect or serve.

2304
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,200
This is strictly business.

2305
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,200
What?

2306
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,200
Guess you'll just have to chalk it up to bad luck.

2307
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,200
Which makes you think, oh, wow,

2308
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,200
maybe this guy has no real regard for human life,

2309
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,200
but then it turns out he did that

2310
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,200
to get the guy to turn his gun on him

2311
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,200
in order to save the lady's life,

2312
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,200
so really he has no regard for his own life

2313
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,200
and will gladly put himself in extra danger

2314
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,200
if it means it might help someone else.

2315
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,200
This scene is good because it's what we call

2316
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,200
characterization.

2317
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,200
We're learning about our main character

2318
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,200
and how he thinks.

2319
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,200
The action is well animated and nice looking,

2320
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,200
but that's secondary to the experience

2321
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,200
of learning about our characters.

2322
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:45,200
We're learning how little Spike values his own life.

2323
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,200
If you keep on pushing it like this,

2324
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:50,200
you're really going to get cut down to size for good.

2325
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,200
Sorry.

2326
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,200
I'm not exactly the delicate, cautious type.

2327
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,200
In the show, we have a lot of time

2328
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,200
to learn in detail that Spike has embraced

2329
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:59,200
a very specific philosophy toward his life.

2330
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:02,200
Whatever happens, happens.

2331
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:05,200
And he doesn't even really see himself as alive,

2332
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,200
and this enables him to more easily throw himself

2333
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,200
at life or death situations.

2334
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,200
How he got this way is part of the story.

2335
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,200
The movie sets up this part of his character

2336
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,200
incredibly quickly for people who didn't see the show

2337
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,200
or refreshes people who need a reminder

2338
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,200
by showing how he saves a woman's life

2339
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,200
by making sure it's him being shot at instead.

2340
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,200
We're seeing a dimension of his character

2341
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,200
which the rest of the story is going to go on to explore.

2342
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,200
What does a man who doesn't value his own life

2343
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,200
do with his life other than constantly risk it

2344
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,200
in ways he didn't have to?

2345
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:34,200
Is this a heroic trait or is it a bit sad

2346
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,200
to constantly live this way?

2347
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,200
Welcome to the core themes of Cowboy Bebop.

2348
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:40,200
I mean, the movie's literally called

2349
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:41,200
Knocking on Heaven's Door.

2350
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,200
Like, the film's about these ideas.

2351
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,200
This robbery doesn't really have anything

2352
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:47,200
to do with the plot at all.

2353
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,200
It's an unrelated opening scene,

2354
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,200
but Cowboy Bebop's scene is better storytelling

2355
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:53,200
because it is telling you things

2356
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,200
and you are learning something

2357
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,200
and your brain is thinking about it.

2358
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,200
I wanna know more about what Spike's deal is.

2359
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,200
I wanna see what he does next.

2360
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:04,200
What does Ruby set up about Ruby in this first scene?

2361
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:07,200
Well, she's reading weapon magazine

2362
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,200
and actually distracted instead of pretending

2363
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:12,200
which I guess shows us that she likes weapons a lot

2364
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,200
and she's still a child who doesn't pay much attention

2365
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:15,200
to her surroundings.

2366
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:17,200
We also see she's a really strong fighter.

2367
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,200
For example, without taking her weapon out,

2368
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,200
using her bare hands,

2369
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,200
she beats the shit out of two guys

2370
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:25,200
bigger than her and sends them flying.

2371
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,200
Remember this part. I'm gonna do a thing.

2372
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,200
This isn't really much characterization.

2373
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:32,200
Events in stories, even in intensive action sequences,

2374
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:35,200
are compelling largely because of how meaningful

2375
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,200
they are to the audience and this is achieved

2376
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:39,200
by developing a connection with the characters.

2377
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:42,200
The gang in Bebop choose to get involved in this

2378
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,200
and choose how specifically to handle

2379
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:45,200
everything that happens,

2380
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,200
and Spike even deliberately chooses

2381
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,200
to put himself in way more danger

2382
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:50,200
to try to help someone else.

2383
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,200
What these decisions are

2384
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,200
and why they make them are interesting.

2385
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:57,200
The story of this movie is what we call character-driven.

2386
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,200
In this opening scene,

2387
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:01,200
Ruby never actually has to make a choice.

2388
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,200
She just happens to be there,

2389
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:05,200
just happens to be a badass anime warrior

2390
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:06,200
who can beat these guys easily,

2391
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,200
and then just happens to be seen doing it

2392
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:10,200
by a professor at Anime Hogwarts

2393
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,200
who refers her to the headmaster.

2394
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:14,200
Ruby gets into this school and is therefore present

2395
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,200
for the rest of the plot of the show

2396
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,200
because she happened to be in a store

2397
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,200
while it was being robbed.

2398
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:22,200
This isn't character-driven story writing.

2399
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:25,200
This is coincidence-driven story writing.

2400
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,200
Also, about this scene where Ruby is, like,

2401
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:30,200
being interrogated by Glinda and Gandalf Goku,

2402
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:33,200
they're, like, in this dimly lit chamber

2403
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,200
like it's a prison or something,

2404
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,200
but then it turns out that she was brought here

2405
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:40,200
to be invited to a school.

2406
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,200
Hello. Nice to meet you.

2407
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:44,200
You want to come to my school?

2408
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:47,200
Why is it shot and lit like an interrogation?

2409
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,200
Where are they?

2410
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:52,200
Is this, like, a safe house that this guy has?

2411
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:54,200
Okay, there actually is an explanation

2412
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,200
for why this scene is like this,

2413
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:56,200
and we're gonna get into it.

2414
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,200
Don't you worry. It's a doozy.

2415
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:00,200
So the issue with the dust store robbery

2416
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:03,200
is that Ruby doesn't actually choose to do anything.

2417
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:06,200
A fight happens at her, and she wins.

2418
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:08,200
To be honest, that's basically the entire plot of the show,

2419
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,200
except sometimes the fight happens

2420
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:12,200
at someone else we barely know.

2421
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:15,200
So the issue with this scene is lack of characterization,

2422
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:17,200
and this isn't a failure of the writing

2423
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,200
of the specific scene but a more general problem

2424
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:22,200
with the way the creative leads treat the characters.

2425
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:25,200
Ruby hasn't been made a particularly interesting person.

2426
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:28,200
She has a cool gun and is good at fighting

2427
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:31,200
and wants to be a hero, and that's about it.

2428
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,200
Your book. Does it have a name?

2429
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:35,200
It's about a man with two souls.

2430
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,200
I love books.

2431
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,200
I love books.

2432
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,200
Our main character, ladies and gentlemen.

2433
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,200
Coming up with compelling characters

2434
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:42,200
who make interesting decisions

2435
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:46,200
is basically the core job of stories.

2436
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,200
Ruby is effectively a blank slate,

2437
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,200
so she's just not interesting

2438
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:52,200
except when she's physically doing something interesting

2439
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:55,200
with her cool gun, like bouncing in the air

2440
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:57,200
using its blowback to slow her descent.

2441
01:25:57,200 --> 01:26:00,200
That's interesting for a couple of seconds.

2442
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,200
Ruby's so poorly characterized

2443
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,200
that the writers are still making up their minds

2444
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,200
multiple seasons in to the point

2445
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:08,200
that even what little we do know about her

2446
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:11,200
gets rewritten to try to make her more interesting

2447
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,200
than she first appeared.

2448
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:14,200
For example, when Ruby falls into the plot,

2449
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:16,200
she doesn't have a weapon with her,

2450
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,200
but luckily, as we've seen,

2451
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:20,200
she's an expert at hand-to-hand combat

2452
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:21,200
and can easily dispatch the...

2453
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,200
Ow!

2454
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,200
Oh, wait.

2455
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:26,200
Between these two scenes, the writers decided

2456
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:28,200
it would be more interesting for Ruby

2457
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,200
to be useless without her weapon.

2458
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,200
Wow, you are much more manageable

2459
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,200
without that oversized gardening tool of yours.

2460
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,200
So now we're in a situation

2461
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,200
where characters' basic abilities

2462
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,200
are being rewritten on a whim

2463
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,200
to try to make the story more interesting,

2464
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,200
and maybe it is more interesting,

2465
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:46,200
and all you have to do to engage with this new story

2466
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:49,200
is forget the events of the very first scene in the show.

2467
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:52,200
So what little characterization is happening

2468
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,200
in this scene gets rewritten later.

2469
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:57,200
This means even in potentially cool scenes

2470
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:00,200
taken directly from one of the best anime ever,

2471
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,200
the scene doesn't work because the character

2472
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:04,200
doesn't have an opportunity to act,

2473
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,200
to make choices, so, yeah,

2474
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:08,200
I'm gonna say this scene doesn't work very well,

2475
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,200
because it doesn't have any decently

2476
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,200
thought-out characters in it

2477
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:15,200
and therefore has nothing to tell or show us about them

2478
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,200
except for the basic aesthetic design

2479
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,200
of Ruby and her weapon

2480
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,200
and the coolness of the fight animations.

2481
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:22,200
So the writers evidently had seen

2482
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,200
the opening of Cowboy Bebop the movie,

2483
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:26,200
enjoyed it because it's great...

2484
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,200
Nice.

2485
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,200
And decided to start their show in a similar way

2486
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,200
but didn't know why Cowboy Bebop's opening

2487
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,200
actually worked so well,

2488
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,200
so they just borrowed the surface components.

2489
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,200
Store robbery, acting distracted,

2490
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:39,200
headphones, and cool fight

2491
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,200
without using them in a way

2492
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:44,200
that does anything specific for the audience.

2493
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,200
Now, you could say, well, how do you know

2494
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:48,200
this is the scene that inspired them?

2495
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:50,200
What if the scenes just happen to be similar?

2496
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:53,200
Well, if that's the case, the scene still doesn't work

2497
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,200
and the comparison still shows how much better

2498
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,200
the scene could have been if it was being used

2499
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,200
for actual characterization, but, yeah,

2500
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,200
maybe the similarities are accidental.

2501
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:04,200
To prove they aren't, I'd have to somehow demonstrate

2502
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,200
the creators had seen Cowboy Bebop

2503
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:08,200
and there's just no easy way.

2504
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,200
If I had to recommend a show to someone

2505
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:10,200
looking to get into anime,

2506
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,200
I'd go with my personal favorite, Cowboy Bebop,

2507
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,200
because I think it's got enough, like,

2508
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,200
Western stuff going on.

2509
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:15,200
I'll just say Spike.

2510
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,200
I'm just gonna say Spike Spiegel

2511
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:18,200
from Cowboy Bebop because he's just like water

2512
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,200
and he's so cool.

2513
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:21,200
My favorite is Cowboy Bebop.

2514
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,200
My favorite anime is Cowboy Bebop.

2515
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:25,200
My favorite anime is Cowboy Bebop

2516
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,200
and although it's not technically an anime,

2517
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,200
I also love Avatar the Last Airbender.

2518
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,200
Avatar. Hmm.

2519
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:33,200
Okay, so I'm gonna go out on a limb here

2520
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:36,200
and say maybe Miles was inspired by his favorite anime

2521
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:38,200
while trying to write an anime.

2522
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:40,200
You know what? I keep falling back to Bebop,

2523
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,200
but, uh, uh, uh,

2524
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:44,200
you shouldn't just run away from your past.

2525
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:45,200
Sometimes you just gotta deal with the problems

2526
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,200
that you started and if you don't,

2527
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:48,200
they will catch up with you.

2528
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:51,200
Keep in mind I'm not saying this is plagiarism.

2529
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,200
Creative theft is a different thing entirely.

2530
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:55,200
I'm saying this is derivative

2531
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,200
and doesn't even replicate the thing it's trying to.

2532
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:00,200
It's certainly not wrong to draw inspiration

2533
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,200
from other works you like

2534
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:04,200
or even pay deliberate homage to things you enjoy

2535
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,200
or which seem fitting to reference in a scene.

2536
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:08,200
I mean, Cowboy Bebop does this all the time

2537
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:09,200
and the convenience store scene

2538
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,200
actually references Pulp Fiction

2539
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:12,200
when one of the robbers they don't know about

2540
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:14,200
comes out of the bathroom and surprises them

2541
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:17,200
which happens literally three times in Pulp Fiction.

2542
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:18,200
I'm gonna take a shit.

2543
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:19,200
Pretty sure this is a reference

2544
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:20,200
and I should know.

2545
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,200
I had a lot of very long arguments

2546
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,200
on now-deleted fan forums about whether this counts

2547
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,200
and let me just say to Mazin Kaiser X

2548
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:27,200
if you're still out there,

2549
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,200
I have a YouTube channel now

2550
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,200
so fuck you, you little philistine.

2551
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,200
I win.

2552
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,200
What I'm getting at here is that firstly,

2553
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,200
I've always been cool

2554
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:36,200
but also that there's nothing wrong

2555
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:38,200
with wearing your inspiration on your sleeve.

2556
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:41,200
What is wrong is doing it without understanding

2557
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,200
what made the original thing work

2558
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:45,200
because now it's not a cool introduction

2559
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:47,200
to a character, story, and setting

2560
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,200
inspired by another good thing.

2561
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:52,200
It's a weird, clunky, and unnecessary scene

2562
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:55,200
whose best feature is it reminds people of Cowboy Bebop

2563
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:58,200
but RWBY doesn't just remind me of Bebop.

2564
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,200
It reminds me of a lot of other anime

2565
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:02,200
and this is a result of the show's design.

2566
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:04,200
And then the next day, he was like,

2567
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:06,200
hey, we should make an anime.

2568
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,200
So as prep before writing the show,

2569
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:10,200
Monty gave the writers some homework.

2570
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,200
Anime homework.

2571
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:14,200
Uh, I went to Carrie and I went, I, I,

2572
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,200
I gave him anime homework.

2573
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:17,200
If you, if you want to be honest,

2574
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:18,200
you should do some anime homework

2575
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:20,200
so I just started giving him shows to watch

2576
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:23,200
that we could, you know, work comparatively to

2577
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:26,200
and then, um, Miles was the second person onto this

2578
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,200
where I would give him anime homework.

2579
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:30,200
Watch this show if you wanna, if you wanna be part of it.

2580
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:31,200
Now, I don't like admitting this.

2581
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:32,200
I'm kind of secretive about it,

2582
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,200
but I've seen a lot of anime in my time

2583
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,200
and I know a bit about it.

2584
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:38,200
I'd like to think no one's noticed this about me,

2585
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:41,200
but we've somehow finally reached a place

2586
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:43,200
where proper criticism of a piece of media

2587
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:45,200
relies on using that knowledge,

2588
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:46,200
a concept which terrifies me,

2589
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:48,200
but with the benefit of your trust,

2590
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,200
we'll come out the other side having learned more

2591
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,200
and improved our analytical technique.

2592
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:53,200
So in the name of science,

2593
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,200
let's punch this plate of spaghetti

2594
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:58,200
in order to reverse engineer it to its component ingredients

2595
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,200
and find out what's really going on.

2596
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:02,200
It's a reference, but I'm also making

2597
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:05,200
a clever metaphor for analysis.

2598
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,200
do-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

2599
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:12,200
♪♪

2600
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:15,200
RWBY is inspired by anime not just in terms of visuals

2601
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,200
but more directly by the tropes and idioms

2602
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:20,200
and basic story elements of shows the creators liked

2603
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:22,200
or at least were told to watch.

2604
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:24,200
The problem is it draws far too much

2605
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:27,200
on ideas and concepts that feel like anime

2606
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:29,200
without really understanding what made

2607
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:31,200
the things it's borrowing actually work

2608
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,200
in the shows they were in.

2609
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:35,200
RWBY is a really strange bunch of shows,

2610
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:37,200
and if you're willing to check,

2611
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,200
you can even find out which ones.

2612
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,200
In a Reddit thread, Miles Luna said what some of the shows

2613
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:43,200
on his anime homework list were.

2614
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,200
Among them, Gurren Lagann, Soul Eater,

2615
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:47,200
Naruto, Bleach, and Black Rock Shooter.

2616
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,200
Some of these shows have direct parallels

2617
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:51,200
with RWBY's story.

2618
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:53,200
Naruto, Bleach, and Soul Eater especially

2619
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:54,200
have direct contrasts.

2620
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,200
All these shows have large casts of characters

2621
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,200
who all, for their specific story reasons,

2622
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:00,200
have their own unique powers.

2623
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,200
This is really traditional for shounen shows.

2624
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:04,200
Everyone kind of has their own deal, and in Bleach,

2625
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:07,200
almost every main character has a unique magical sword

2626
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:09,200
which grants them a specific ability,

2627
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:12,200
and the main character in Soul Eater wields a cool scythe.

2628
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:15,200
It's not that hard to tell what ideas RWBY

2629
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,200
is borrowing from these shows, is it?

2630
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:19,200
But again, the core elements being borrowed

2631
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:22,200
are the really basic Wikipedia-level synopsis ideas.

2632
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:24,200
The sort of stuff people who don't watch anime

2633
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:26,200
think anime is about,

2634
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,200
like the school for learning anime fighting,

2635
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:31,200
the large cast of characters with cool abilities and powers,

2636
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:33,200
the super simple stuff that isn't really

2637
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:35,200
why anyone watches something.

2638
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,200
These shows work because they're really about

2639
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:40,200
the characters and their choices and relationships,

2640
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:42,200
and they happen to be set against a fun,

2641
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:44,200
fantastical background with cool action.

2642
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:46,200
Boruto's dad and his army of frenemies

2643
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:49,200
live rich inner lives and form interesting connections

2644
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:52,200
with each other and the audience as they grow and change.

2645
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:55,200
In Soul Eater, the cool weapons are alive

2646
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:58,200
and lots of focus is put on how they relate to

2647
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:01,200
and work with their users, and this also happens in Bleach

2648
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:03,200
but, you know, in a way where it seems really awesome

2649
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:06,200
and you choose to watch it over all the other shounen

2650
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:08,200
at the time and then it crushes your hopes and dreams,

2651
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:11,200
and it seems like in the early RWBY Weiss relationship,

2652
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,200
this is what they were going for.

2653
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:15,200
The way they bicker in the early trial

2654
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:17,200
and Weiss is angry about not being the leader later,

2655
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:19,200
this is honestly, genuinely the beginning

2656
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:21,200
of an interesting relationship,

2657
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:23,200
but instead of making this an aspect of the show,

2658
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:25,200
they fix it and make someone else's life

2659
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:27,200
the focus of the show for half of it,

2660
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:29,200
and then someone else turns up to do all the fighting,

2661
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:31,200
so the thing that makes these shows work,

2662
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,200
the characters, their relationships,

2663
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:35,200
your engagement with the characters as they do

2664
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:37,200
fun fights is absent.

2665
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:40,200
It's a stew but without the most important ingredient,

2666
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:42,200
the stew mix. That's the rule, by the way.

2667
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,200
You're allowed to make food metaphors in criticism

2668
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,200
but only when they're actually a clever reference.

2669
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,200
At best, the main character,

2670
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:50,200
who theoretically should be the most interesting,

2671
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:54,200
is a lady in a nice outfit with a cool gun.

2672
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:57,200
That's a really low ceiling to put on a story.

2673
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:00,200
RWBY feels like fan fiction of a show that doesn't exist.

2674
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:02,200
Except, no, that's not true.

2675
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:05,200
There is one specific show it feels a whole lot

2676
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:07,200
like fan fiction for.

2677
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,200
To quote Miles Luna again,

2678
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:11,200
if you want to get a feel of what the show will be like,

2679
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,200
watch Avatar The Last Airbender.

2680
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:15,200
Oh, this explains a lot of things.

2681
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,200
Once you go watch Avatar, you start to realize

2682
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:19,200
where a lot of the show came from.

2683
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:21,200
For example, Avatar is set in a world

2684
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:22,200
with four nations in it.

2685
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:26,200
Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.

2686
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:28,200
RWBY has four kingdoms,

2687
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:29,200
so you see it's different.

2688
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:31,200
The four kingdoms.

2689
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:33,200
They're called kingdoms because, well,

2690
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:34,200
they can't call them nations, can they?

2691
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:36,200
In Avatar, in times of stress,

2692
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:38,200
the Avatar enters a state where his eyes glow

2693
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:40,200
and he manifests amazing powers.

2694
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:43,200
You'll never guess that three seasons into the story

2695
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,200
with zero setup that this is a thing,

2696
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:47,200
RWBY's eyes suddenly glow,

2697
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:49,200
and she's revealed to have the amazing power

2698
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:52,200
to instantly turn even the most powerful Grimm to stone.

2699
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:55,200
You learn she has this power the instant it happens,

2700
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:57,200
and you only learn what this power is in retrospect

2701
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:59,200
because there was no room in the story

2702
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:00,200
to set this up, was there?

2703
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:02,200
Another cool thing about Avatar is that the Avatar

2704
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:05,200
reincarnates into a new form whenever he dies.

2705
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,200
Completely coincidentally, there's a character in RWBY

2706
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,200
whose spirit goes on to inhabit a new form

2707
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:11,200
whenever he dies. Amazing.

2708
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:12,200
You see, it's actually a clever twist

2709
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:14,200
because no one would have expected them

2710
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:15,200
to be that obvious,

2711
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,200
so when they really did just do Avatar again,

2712
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:19,200
it's a genuine surprise.

2713
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:22,200
Oh, another massively important plot element.

2714
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:24,200
One of the antagonists is a revolutionary

2715
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:26,200
political movement reacting to oppression

2716
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:30,200
led by a man in a mask with horrendous scars underneath.

2717
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:31,200
Was I talking about RWBY there?

2718
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:33,200
No, I was talking about Avatar, Legend of Korra,

2719
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:35,200
but, yes, that also happens in RWBY.

2720
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:37,200
Oh, actually, you see, the scar is different

2721
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:39,200
because it's over one of his eyes.

2722
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,200
That's slightly different from Avatar,

2723
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:42,200
so it's not the same thing.

2724
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:44,200
You see, no, what's this picture of Zuko doing here?

2725
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:47,200
Then in later seasons, they decide to take the story

2726
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,200
in a very different direction,

2727
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:49,200
you know, to make it a bit more unique,

2728
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:51,200
so now the characters have to travel the world

2729
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:53,200
and visit lots of different towns and villages

2730
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:55,200
and cultures on their way,

2731
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:56,200
which is completely unlike Avatar

2732
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:58,200
because when it happens in Avatar, it's good.

2733
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:00,200
Remember when I was positive about the potential

2734
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:02,200
of RWBY's story and setting?

2735
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:05,200
Well, it feels like I'm really just complimenting

2736
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:06,200
the material it borrowed.

2737
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:08,200
So many of RWBY's choices seem made

2738
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:10,200
specifically that way because it was that way

2739
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:13,200
in Avatar even though it's completely unnecessary

2740
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:14,200
to borrow those parts.

2741
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:18,200
Why is it that every time you play with magic water,

2742
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:20,200
I get soaked?

2743
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:23,200
It's not magic. It's waterbending.

2744
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:24,200
Oh, my God.

2745
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:25,200
Is that where the characters' powers

2746
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:27,200
not being magic came from?

2747
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,200
Why would you even think to do that?

2748
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:31,200
I always thought each season of RWBY being called a volume

2749
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:34,200
was a bit weird and unwieldy, and guess what?

2750
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:35,200
It turns out it sounds way better

2751
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:37,200
when they're called books.

2752
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:39,200
Even the intro voiceover sometimes sounds

2753
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,200
like they right-click Thesaurus

2754
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:43,200
some aspects of Avatar's intro.

2755
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:45,200
My grandmother used to tell me stories

2756
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:46,200
about the old days.

2757
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:47,200
Legends.

2758
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:50,200
Stories scattered through time.

2759
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:51,200
It's like the show's playing a game

2760
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,200
of telephone with Avatar.

2761
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:55,200
Those words in that order sounded good,

2762
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:58,200
so let's use some words that are a bit similar

2763
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:01,200
in a different order and also make it all about dust.

2764
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:04,200
The thing that made Avatar's introduction work

2765
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:06,200
is it set up a lot of stuff at once.

2766
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:09,200
For example, how this settings version of magic worked,

2767
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:11,200
the thing you didn't mention at all,

2768
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:13,200
or the fact there were four big nations.

2769
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:15,200
You know, the thing you didn't mention at all

2770
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:18,200
except for when four castle-looking things

2771
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:20,200
turn up for three seconds before disappearing.

2772
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:22,200
Jaune is a pretty direct analog for Sokka

2773
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:24,200
to the point where the creators just say

2774
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:25,200
that's what he's based on.

2775
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:26,200
Oh, no, I was saying, like,

2776
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:28,200
when you first did Reeds and I was like,

2777
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:30,200
we need, like, a Sokka character.

2778
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:32,200
And this retroactively explains

2779
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:34,200
why Jaune's plot line was so weird.

2780
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:36,200
Jaune Arc had this subplot of Jaune

2781
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:38,200
not accepting Pyrrha's offer to help train him

2782
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:39,200
to be a better fighter,

2783
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:41,200
but his explanation for why was always really strange.

2784
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:43,200
He wants to get better without help,

2785
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:46,200
or he's not really a hero or something.

2786
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:48,200
If I can't do this on my own,

2787
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:49,200
then what good am I?

2788
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:52,200
But he never tries and never pays attention in class,

2789
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:54,200
so that's bullshit,

2790
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:56,200
and at the end of his section of the story,

2791
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:57,200
he just accepts her help.

2792
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:59,200
Standing up to a bully taught him to...

2793
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:02,200
This confusing arc happens because it happened to Sokka.

2794
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:04,200
In Avatar, a story with characters

2795
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:07,200
with depth and infinitely better world building,

2796
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:09,200
in the beginning Sokka is not a great warrior,

2797
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:11,200
but he desperately wants to be one.

2798
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:13,200
He's from a culture that looks down on the idea

2799
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:14,200
of women being fighters,

2800
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:16,200
but then he gets wrecked by an order

2801
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,200
of female warriors who protect a village

2802
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:19,200
on their travels and has to confront

2803
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:20,200
his beliefs about women.

2804
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:22,200
He learns a lesson from this

2805
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:23,200
and begs them to train him.

2806
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:25,200
He gets better as a fighter,

2807
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:27,200
but this plot line is super engaging for an audience

2808
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,200
because we get to watch him grow as a person

2809
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:31,200
and change his beliefs.

2810
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:33,200
Sokka starts out, like, kind of as a shitty teen.

2811
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:34,200
I thought I would really not like him

2812
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,200
when I first watched Avatar,

2813
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:37,200
but he grows so much.

2814
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:40,200
He becomes such an interesting character super quickly.

2815
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,200
So now it's clear why Jaune's arc

2816
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:44,200
is seemingly missing pieces.

2817
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:46,200
It's not just that Sokka was written better,

2818
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:47,200
but more specifically,

2819
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:49,200
it's clear the writers liked the idea

2820
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:51,200
of giving their Sokka character the same arc,

2821
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:53,200
but the problem with this arc is

2822
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:55,200
it means one of your core characters starts out

2823
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:58,200
as a bit of a chauvinist and needs time and work

2824
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,200
to grow into a better person,

2825
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,200
but if you're trying to write a cool, progressive anime

2826
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:04,200
starring mostly girls,

2827
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:06,200
you don't want to have a character acting like that,

2828
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:08,200
do you? That sounds kind of heavy,

2829
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:10,200
and are you really going to write your character

2830
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:12,200
who you voice to act like that?

2831
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:14,200
So Jaune is written to already start out

2832
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:16,200
as basically a good person

2833
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:18,200
who respects women's abilities as fighters

2834
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:20,200
who simply needs to learn to accept help

2835
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:23,200
instead of refusing it for what is now no reason.

2836
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:25,200
It actually turns out that a ton of weird things

2837
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,200
about RWBY happened that way

2838
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:29,200
because they were like that in Avatar.

2839
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:31,200
The interrogation thing in the first episode of RWBY

2840
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:33,200
was always a silly choice.

2841
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:35,200
Why take her to this weird dimly lit empty room

2842
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:37,200
to invite her to a school?

2843
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:39,200
But it makes much more sense if you happen to have seen

2844
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:41,200
the first episode of Legend of Korra

2845
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,200
when Korra gets arrested and interrogated.

2846
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:45,200
If a scene in RWBY seems out of place

2847
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:47,200
or like a scene from another show

2848
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:49,200
just happened for no reason in the middle of this one,

2849
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:51,200
it's probably because it did,

2850
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:53,200
so it's pretty clear to the point

2851
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:55,200
they literally admit it that a big problem

2852
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:57,200
with RWBY's writing is that the creators

2853
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:59,200
are grasping wildly at shows they like

2854
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:01,200
for things to recreate in their show

2855
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:03,200
in the hopes of crafting a story.

2856
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:05,200
It's only technically been written

2857
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:07,200
in one sense of the word.

2858
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:09,200
It's more of a reconstituted amalgam

2859
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:11,200
of things they thought were cool elsewhere.

2860
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:13,200
Grind up all that meat and stuff it

2861
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:15,200
into a sausage casing or I guess

2862
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:17,200
in this case a body pillow.

2863
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:19,200
No, Miles, what are you doing? This is really embarrassing.

2864
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:22,200
Ruby Rose is a 15-year-old girl.

2865
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:24,200
If you like anything about RWBY

2866
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:26,200
and you haven't seen much anime before

2867
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:28,200
because it didn't seem like it was for you,

2868
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:30,200
I guarantee you right now there's a show

2869
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:32,200
in this list that the thing you liked

2870
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:34,200
about RWBY came from and you'd like

2871
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:36,200
that show a hell of a lot more

2872
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:38,200
and let's be honest, it's probably Avatar.

2873
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:40,200
A lot of people I've met who are really big fans

2874
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:42,200
of RWBY tend to be not into anime.

2875
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:44,200
They don't think it's for them or they haven't watched it

2876
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:46,200
before yet, but if you take the plunge

2877
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:48,200
and then you see how good a show using these ideas

2878
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:50,200
could be, you'll very quickly be able

2879
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:52,200
to see why a lot of people with a bit more

2880
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:54,200
of a frame of reference are so disappointed

2881
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:56,200
with this show. Go pick a show from that list

2882
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,200
and have a better time. Seriously.

2883
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:00,200
Just make sure it's not Bleach. Don't make the same mistake

2884
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:02,200
I did. Please, you mustn't! You have to!

2885
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:04,200
There's a scene in volume two where it turns out

2886
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:06,200
Yang and Ruby have a family dog called Zwei.

2887
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:08,200
There's a dog in Cowboy Bebop

2888
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,200
of the same breed called Ain.

2889
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:12,200
Get it? The creators are trying to make a cute

2890
01:41:12,200 --> 01:41:14,200
reference to a show they like.

2891
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:16,200
They don't seem to have realized they've referenced

2892
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:18,200
all the shows they like quite enough already.

2893
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:20,200
I was hoping they'd eventually

2894
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:22,200
try doing something else.

2895
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:24,200
The real impact of all this on Ruby's potential

2896
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:26,200
is that it means the things

2897
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:28,200
that are truly unique about it get ignored.

2898
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:30,200
Because the world building is vague

2899
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:32,200
and really just a loose approximation

2900
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:34,200
of nine other cartoons, all kinds

2901
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:36,200
of little tidbits crop up that would be

2902
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:38,200
so interesting if they went anywhere

2903
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:40,200
but never will. Remember Crescent Rose?

2904
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:42,200
You know, one of the most dangerous weapons

2905
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:44,200
ever designed? One of the most dangerous

2906
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:46,200
weapons ever designed? There is one

2907
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:48,200
really interesting story element to it

2908
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:50,200
which is that Ruby designed it.

2909
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:52,200
Well, I'm kind of a dork

2910
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:54,200
when it comes to weapons. I guess I did go

2911
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:56,200
a little overboard in designing it.

2912
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:58,200
Ruby designed this weapon. One of the most

2913
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:00,200
dangerous weapons ever designed. Now,

2914
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:02,200
if you were looking at the script and you'd

2915
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:04,200
written these two things, what you should

2916
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:06,200
do at that moment is kiss yourself

2917
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,200
and realize that you've just struck

2918
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:10,200
fucking gold. The main character

2919
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:12,200
of your show is a child inventor

2920
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:14,200
who can craft incredible machines

2921
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:16,200
that kill. What a fantastic

2922
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:18,200
premise for a story and Ruby

2923
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:20,200
loves to read weapon magazines

2924
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:22,200
and nerds out about the weapons she sees

2925
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:24,200
when she first gets to anime warrior school.

2926
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:26,200
Like, they've almost written a

2927
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:28,200
character here and everything else about

2928
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:30,200
Ruby's character is the most milquetoast

2929
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:32,200
stuff possible like, oh, she wants to be a hero?

2930
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:34,200
Great. I love books.

2931
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:36,200
I think this line annoys me so much because

2932
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:38,200
like, Ruby has a really interesting character

2933
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:40,200
trait you could be doing something with.

2934
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:42,200
And you're doing this?

2935
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:44,200
No! No, you can't! I forbid it!

2936
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:46,200
And when this comes up,

2937
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:48,200
Ruby's talking to Jaune whose deal is

2938
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:50,200
he just has a regular sword.

2939
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:52,200
Like, it's a punchline. And when I was

2940
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:54,200
first watching the show, I was really having my doubts

2941
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:56,200
about where things were going, but when this happened,

2942
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:58,200
I thought, oh, cool.

2943
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:00,200
Ruby's gonna help him design a unique

2944
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:02,200
weapon that really works for him and we're

2945
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:04,200
gonna see them coming up with it and building

2946
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:06,200
it and developing as friends and that's

2947
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:08,200
gonna be so cool. Jaune's gonna come

2948
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:10,200
into his own and learn things about himself

2949
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:12,200
as he does it and grow as a fighter

2950
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:14,200
and as a person and there's something really wholesome

2951
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:16,200
about learning a skill and building something

2952
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:18,200
in a story. That'll be a really cool

2953
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:20,200
thing to follow. And then,

2954
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:22,200
it didn't happen for a season because they were doing

2955
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:24,200
anime bullshit instead.

2956
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:26,200
Fighting monsters, dealing with bullies,

2957
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:28,200
falling asleep during pointless

2958
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:30,200
exposition. Oh, and in the show as well.

2959
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:32,200
And then for years, I kept thinking,

2960
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:34,200
when are they gonna do it? When are they gonna do it?

2961
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:36,200
When are they going to use

2962
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:38,200
Ruby's interesting character trait

2963
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:40,200
that they just seemingly forgot she has?

2964
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:42,200
And then, finally,

2965
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:44,200
in volume four,

2966
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:46,200
they go to a blacksmith and a character

2967
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:48,200
who we've never seen before and never will again

2968
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:50,200
upgrades Jaune's sword using

2969
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:52,200
pieces of his girlfriend's armor.

2970
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:54,200
And Ruby rarely, if ever, talks about

2971
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:56,200
the fact she made Crescent Rose and

2972
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:58,200
she stops nerding out about weapons except

2973
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:00,200
for, like, once per season if the

2974
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:02,200
writers remember that was her one unique

2975
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:04,200
character trait. Ah, but I'm sure you're

2976
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:06,200
going somewhere with this Avatar remake.

2977
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:08,200
Don't let me distract you. No, I'm not even fucking

2978
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:10,200
kidding you. Even the forging of

2979
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:12,200
a sword out of some cool material he

2980
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:14,200
has is a thing Sokka does in Avatar.

2981
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:16,200
It just doesn't stop.

2982
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:18,200
It never stops. This show has

2983
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:20,200
so many cool concepts that

2984
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:22,200
just crop up like that where if you're paying

2985
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:24,200
attention, there's tremendous potential being

2986
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:26,200
laid down here and then they ignore it to just

2987
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:28,200
loosely copy stuff from

2988
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:30,200
fucking Bleach. Look, that guy

2989
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:32,200
has the sword that's a bit like the

2990
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:34,200
one from Bleach. Do you remember

2991
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:36,200
Bleach? I remember

2992
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:38,200
Bleach. Someone

2993
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:40,200
please validate me remembering so much

2994
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:42,200
Bleach. There's a Roger Ebert quote I always

2995
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:44,200
really liked and used in a draft of

2996
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:46,200
this video I was working on like five

2997
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:48,200
years ago which Lindsay Ellis happened

2998
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:50,200
to use first in a video before

2999
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:52,200
me so now it feels like I'm ripping her off.

3000
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:54,200
Thanks, Lindsay. Where when reviewing

3001
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:56,200
Battlefield Earth, he makes the comment that the

3002
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:58,200
director has learned from better films

3003
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:00,200
that directors sometimes tilt their

3004
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:02,200
cameras but he has not learned why.

3005
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:04,200
I'm gonna take a shit. I believe Miles

3006
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:06,200
when he tells me Avatar is one of his

3007
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:08,200
favorite shows but I'm not convinced

3008
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:10,200
he knows why he liked it. Cowboy Bebop

3009
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:12,200
is cool because it's about a man who

3010
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:14,200
believes his life is already over

3011
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:16,200
throwing himself into life or death situations

3012
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:18,200
to feel alive again. Spike

3013
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:20,200
Spiegel carries a weight with

3014
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:22,200
him and you have to watch him do his best

3015
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:24,200
to pretend he isn't. Cowboy

3016
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:26,200
Bebop is not cool because

3017
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:28,200
he's good at spinny kicks and

3018
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:30,200
his friend has a robot arm and frankly

3019
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:32,200
the idea that that's what really

3020
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,200
mattered is personally offensive

3021
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:36,200
to me. If you really respect this

3022
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:38,200
material, you should borrow the things

3023
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:40,200
that gave it meaning, not all of this

3024
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:42,200
surface level stuff. This is kind of

3025
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:44,200
the important thing to drill in on here.

3026
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:46,200
These shows aren't about cool powers

3027
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:48,200
or great visuals or engaging

3028
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:50,200
fights. They have those but on a core

3029
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:52,200
level, what they're really about is

3030
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:54,200
characters, people who you feel

3031
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:56,200
things for, who you watch do things,

3032
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:58,200
who you can be invested in. If you

3033
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:00,200
don't have that base layer of engagement

3034
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:02,200
with the people in your story,

3035
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:04,200
you don't really have much of anything.

3036
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:06,200
If you have a cool fight but you haven't made

3037
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:08,200
people interested in or understand

3038
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:10,200
why they're fighting, then you

3039
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:12,200
don't even really have the fight, do you?

3040
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:14,200
Lots of things in the show are references to

3041
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:16,200
other Rooster Teeth properties. There's

3042
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:18,200
in-jokes everywhere, posters from other shows,

3043
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:20,200
quotes from their podcasts,

3044
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:22,200
this store's name is a pun on

3045
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:24,200
a simple walk into Mordor,

3046
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:26,200
that show they did about walking in New Zealand.

3047
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:28,200
Even tiny things like

3048
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:30,200
Jaune's locker number is a reference

3049
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:32,200
to the address of Rooster Teeth's old studio.

3050
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:34,200
Whatever unique story and

3051
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:36,200
potential there is in here, it's taking

3052
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:38,200
refuge behind an immense patchwork

3053
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:40,200
quilt of references to

3054
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:42,200
other things they like, other things

3055
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:44,200
their company made, and eventually

3056
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:46,200
references to the few things people

3057
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:48,200
seemed to like about the show itself.

3058
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:50,200
One of the standout moments that people

3059
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:52,200
really liked about early RWBY is the part

3060
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:54,200
where Nora pokes Ren's nose and says

3061
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:56,200
boop. Boop. People really

3062
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:58,200
liked that because it's a genuinely

3063
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:00,200
simple and cute moment that you don't

3064
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:02,200
need to know Rooster Teeth lore to enjoy

3065
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:04,200
and isn't trying and failing

3066
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:06,200
to emulate something else. It's just nice.

3067
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:08,200
You know? That's good. It's cute.

3068
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:10,200
People also really liked the way Penny introduced

3069
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:12,200
herself because it's genuinely a really

3070
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:14,200
nice moment. Like, Weiss accidentally

3071
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:16,200
knocks her over and she just goes

3072
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:18,200
salutations.

3073
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:20,200
That's funny. That's good writing. That's

3074
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:22,200
characterization. It's immediately clear

3075
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:24,200
that something is up with Penny. It's good.

3076
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:26,200
Please stop being sometimes

3077
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:28,200
good and getting my hopes up.

3078
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:30,200
So, of course, in addition to selling

3079
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:32,200
merchandise that quotes these moments,

3080
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:34,200
in the second season Nora starts wearing

3081
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:36,200
a boop shirt. They don't have room

3082
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:38,200
to make the prom stuff interesting

3083
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:40,200
or to connect Monty's fights properly

3084
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:42,200
and make them feel like part of a story

3085
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:44,200
but they had room to go, hey,

3086
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:46,200
remember when she said boop?

3087
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:48,200
Well, it's in stores now. The show is

3088
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:50,200
just a continuous list of references

3089
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:52,200
to other things that were good,

3090
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:54,200
and by the middle of season two, sorry,

3091
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:56,200
book two, sorry, volume two,

3092
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:58,200
it's referencing the few good parts

3093
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:00,200
of itself. Writing, like,

3094
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:02,200
the word writing is often

3095
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:04,200
used to mean a lot of

3096
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:06,200
different things but at its core

3097
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:08,200
writing means

3098
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:10,200
making decisions and

3099
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:12,200
risking making the wrong one.

3100
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:14,200
What's acutely frustrating about Ruby

3101
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:16,200
is that Miles and Kerry don't

3102
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:18,200
necessarily always make

3103
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:20,200
bad decisions. It's that they have

3104
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:22,200
done almost everything they can to

3105
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:24,200
make them, to abdicate the

3106
01:48:24,200 --> 01:48:26,200
responsibility of having to write

3107
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:28,200
a story of their own. They don't understand

3108
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:30,200
exactly why the

3109
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:32,200
things they're borrowing actually were

3110
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:34,200
enjoyable, which makes it worse, but

3111
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:36,200
centrally they're in this mess because they're

3112
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:38,200
going out of their way not to be

3113
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:40,200
unique and thereby failing to do

3114
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:42,200
interesting things with or apparently

3115
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:44,200
even notice the potential

3116
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:46,200
that an original animated work made for

3117
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:48,200
the internet with no oversight can have.

3118
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:50,200
The show could have been

3119
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:52,200
anything, and it wants to be anything

3120
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:54,200
other than itself, and that wasted

3121
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:56,200
potential will never not be tremendously

3122
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:58,200
disappointing. When you take

3123
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:00,200
no risks and try to say

3124
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:02,200
very little while looking like

3125
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:04,200
you're saying something important, you get

3126
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:06,200
a story element like the Faunus.

3127
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:10,200
By later in the first volume,

3128
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:12,200
we finally sat in a classroom and learned what

3129
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:14,200
the Faunus are and also seen the bully character

3130
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:16,200
mistreating one of them. The Faunus are

3131
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:18,200
a stand-in for the oppressed races

3132
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:20,200
of the world. Yes, that is correct.

3133
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:22,200
I did not misspeak. These guys

3134
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:24,200
have to talk about racism now

3135
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:26,200
and I am here for

3136
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:28,200
it. I've heard it mentioned that this aspect

3137
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:30,200
of the story was originally conceived by

3138
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:32,200
Monty, but unfortunately the story

3139
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:34,200
is being written by the men who brought you

3140
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:36,200
My Semblance is Polarity?

3141
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:38,200
The big twist in volume

3142
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:40,200
one is that Blake is a Faunus.

3143
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:42,200
She gets mad at Weiss for being a racist

3144
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:44,200
and runs away and dramatically

3145
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:46,200
takes off her bow to reveal

3146
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:48,200
her fat ears in addition

3147
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:50,200
to her normal ears. Have you guessed which

3148
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:52,200
fairy tale character Blake is based on yet?

3149
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:54,200
Well, I'll tell you.

3150
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:57,200
She's Beauty and the Beast.

3151
01:49:57,200 --> 01:49:59,200
Ugh!

3152
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:01,200
Now, I don't know about you, but Ruby didn't

3153
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:03,200
initially strike me as a show that was

3154
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:05,200
trying to be about something this heavy.

3155
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:07,200
I mean, for the most part, it's been an adventure

3156
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:09,200
story about kids beating up monsters

3157
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:11,200
and bad guys, so when this happened,

3158
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:13,200
I don't know, it seemed a little weird.

3159
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:15,200
Like, is this particular show with

3160
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:17,200
the tone you've set so far really ready

3161
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:19,200
for something as serious as this?

3162
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:21,200
I'm queen of the castle.

3163
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:23,200
I'm queen of the castle.

3164
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:25,200
Like, we're in the middle of this fairly light-hearted

3165
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:27,200
show, so light-hearted characters have

3166
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:29,200
a magic shield in fights so they can't get

3167
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:31,200
hurt too badly, and then in a classroom

3168
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:33,200
the comedy fast-talking coffee-drinking

3169
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:35,200
professor guy, voiced by

3170
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:37,200
the guy who plays Caboose in Red vs.

3171
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:39,200
Blue, starts to discuss the

3172
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:41,200
horrific tragedy of the mistreatment

3173
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:43,200
of the Faunus. Prior to the Faunus

3174
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:45,200
Rights Revolution, more popularly known as

3175
01:50:45,200 --> 01:50:47,200
the Faunus War, they begin to explore

3176
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:49,200
the topic of racism by using

3177
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:51,200
the comedy silly-talky man.

3178
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:53,200
Now, have

3179
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:55,200
any among you been subjugated or

3180
01:50:55,200 --> 01:50:57,200
discriminated because of your Faunus heritage?

3181
01:50:57,200 --> 01:50:59,200
The issue of racism is a big part

3182
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:01,200
of the rest of the story, or at least it tries

3183
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:03,200
to be. A central component

3184
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:05,200
of the plot is the White Fang, a group

3185
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:07,200
of Faunus who do crimes and terrorism

3186
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:09,200
in the name of Faunus liberation. The White Fang

3187
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:11,200
are presented as antagonists in the

3188
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:13,200
story. They work with the bad man from volume

3189
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:15,200
one and do a bunch of crimes, including

3190
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:17,200
the train thing. A lot of the goons getting

3191
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:19,200
fought in fights in volumes one,

3192
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:21,200
two, three,

3193
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:23,200
four, and five are

3194
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:25,200
White Fang members. When the main characters

3195
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:27,200
aren't fighting Grimm, they're beating

3196
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:29,200
the shit out of in-universe minorities,

3197
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:31,200
but it's okay. You know they're bad because

3198
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:33,200
they all talk in the evil voice.

3199
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:35,200
Finally,

3200
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:37,200
I get to kill a shnee.

3201
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:39,200
Oh, I think he might be a bad

3202
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:41,200
guy. Once again, we're seeing the writing problems

3203
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:43,200
that made Jaune's character so terrible

3204
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:45,200
creeping in here. This argument between

3205
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:47,200
Weiss and Blake comes to a head because,

3206
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:49,200
at least initially, Weiss was written to be

3207
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:50,200
kind of racist.

3208
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:52,200
Hmm. The White Fang.

3209
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:54,200
What an awful bunch of degenerates.

3210
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:56,200
I don't particularly trust

3211
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:58,200
the Faunus. Her family profited

3212
01:51:58,200 --> 01:52:00,200
from exploitative Faunus labor and maybe

3213
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:02,200
slavery, but it's hard to tell exactly what

3214
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:04,200
because the show is written badly. Infamous

3215
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:06,200
for its controversial labor forces.

3216
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:08,200
And she seems to take the opportunity to be shitty

3217
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:10,200
about Faunus when it presents itself.

3218
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:12,200
Stop calling him a degenerate. He's a person.

3219
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:14,200
Oh, I'm sorry.

3220
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:16,200
Would you like me to stop referring to the trash

3221
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:18,200
can as a trash can?

3222
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:20,200
But at some point down the line, the writers were smart

3223
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:22,200
enough to see a problem with writing a main character

3224
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:24,200
with this flaw. Weiss being racist

3225
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:26,200
might affect the audience's ability

3226
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:28,200
to relate to the character, wouldn't it?

3227
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:30,200
The creators want the audience to like this lady

3228
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:32,200
as they go on adventures with her and watch her

3229
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:34,200
dote on pup boy Bebop.

3230
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:36,200
How many members of your audience are really gonna

3231
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:38,200
want to cosplay as the Weiss

3232
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:40,200
supremacist? So her beliefs about

3233
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:42,200
the Faunus are quietly dropped off

3234
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:44,200
screen and we are to assume she's

3235
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:46,200
anti-racist in future volumes.

3236
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:48,200
She just says, hey, whatever, we're a team.

3237
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:50,200
Let's work together now, and then in the next volume

3238
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:52,200
this side of her character is quietly

3239
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:54,200
forgotten. Knowing this show, I

3240
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:56,200
presume a man told her off screen not to be

3241
01:52:56,200 --> 01:52:58,200
a racist anymore and she went, okay.

3242
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:00,200
In volume two she says she wants

3243
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:02,200
to become a Huntress specifically to try

3244
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:04,200
to do better than her family name has

3245
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:06,200
been in the past and she doesn't like what her

3246
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:08,200
father is doing, implicitly saying

3247
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:10,200
she became a fighter who protects the world

3248
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:12,200
because she wants to not be like her

3249
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:14,200
racist family. This is done instead

3250
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:16,200
of having her grapple with her

3251
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:18,200
prejudice towards a group of people and

3252
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:20,200
growing and changing and learning.

3253
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:22,200
You know, akin to what a story would

3254
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:24,200
do. They made her racist and then rewrote

3255
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:26,200
her to never have been racist.

3256
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:28,200
The writers are far too precious

3257
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:30,200
about their characters to permit them to have,

3258
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:32,200
like, flaws or lives

3259
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:34,200
or even personalities beyond

3260
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:36,200
cookie cutter heroics.

3261
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:38,200
They don't need to learn anything

3262
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:40,200
or grow, which makes them fundamentally

3263
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:42,200
uninteresting, and in the same way

3264
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:44,200
the writers are far too precious

3265
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:46,200
about their world itself. They want

3266
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:48,200
their world to not be so fundamentally

3267
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:50,200
flawed that a group like the White Fang is necessary.

3268
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:52,200
You see, the issue here is the White Fang

3269
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:54,200
are basically in the right. The Faunus

3270
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:56,200
are an oppressed people whose

3271
01:53:56,200 --> 01:53:58,200
struggle for liberation and equality

3272
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:00,200
is immediately, the instant you

3273
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:02,200
actually think about it, the morally

3274
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:04,200
correct side of the argument. Spoilers

3275
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:06,200
for real life, but we recently discovered

3276
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:08,200
in lab tests on mice that racism

3277
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:10,200
is wrong, but, like, if you have a movement

3278
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:12,200
whose purpose is to liberate an oppressed

3279
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:14,200
group, that means your society

3280
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:16,200
has some incredibly deep-set problems,

3281
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:18,200
right? People who need liberating

3282
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:20,200
from something? You know the Black Panthers

3283
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:22,200
didn't pop into existence because things

3284
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:24,200
were fine in the 60s, right?

3285
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:26,200
Oh, I really hate Hbomb's political videos,

3286
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:28,200
but I love his media stuff. It's way better.

3287
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:30,200
Ha! I tricked you! But Miles and

3288
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:32,200
Kerry realized at some point that

3289
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:34,200
if you introduce a group like this,

3290
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:36,200
then the main society of your story

3291
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:38,200
is a systemically racist one,

3292
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:40,200
and a huge portion of your main characters

3293
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:42,200
would be tacitly implicated in this

3294
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:44,200
by living in that society and not

3295
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:46,200
doing anything about the way those people are treated.

3296
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:48,200
Basically, they'd be writing a pretty grim

3297
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:50,200
story where almost everyone

3298
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:52,200
is on some level racist

3299
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:54,200
or at least okay with an unequal

3300
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:56,200
system because a lot of shit would need

3301
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:58,200
to change if there's a group like the White Fang

3302
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:00,200
running around and anyone sitting around

3303
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:02,200
enjoying the status quo instead of doing anything

3304
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:04,200
wouldn't be a heroic or positive

3305
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:06,200
character in this setting. In other words,

3306
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:08,200
you'd have a bit too much

3307
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:10,200
social commentary making everyone

3308
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:12,200
really uncomfortable about the parallels

3309
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:14,200
to real world history and in some places

3310
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:16,200
the real world present which would

3311
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:18,200
be an interesting story. I'd like a story

3312
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:20,200
like that really, but which would kind of suck

3313
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:22,200
the fun out of your anime cartoon about

3314
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:24,200
killing monsters with sci-fi rocket fists.

3315
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:26,200
People aren't gonna buy your boop

3316
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:28,200
t-shirts if they're sad about racism

3317
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:30,200
so the writer's objective was to make

3318
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:32,200
a show which explores racism

3319
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:34,200
but without making anyone too

3320
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:36,200
uncomfortable, without risking actually

3321
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:38,200
saying anything about our society,

3322
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:40,200
and without risking saying that the White Fang

3323
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:42,200
might have a point so everyone can have

3324
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:44,200
fun watching people beat them up because

3325
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:46,200
they're the bad guys. We wouldn't want any

3326
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:48,200
implications to think about. So,

3327
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:50,200
firstly, the mistreatment that appears in the story

3328
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:52,200
is always incredibly minor.

3329
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:54,200
It's established that the Faunus have already

3330
01:55:54,200 --> 01:55:56,200
had a civil rights movement of sorts

3331
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:58,200
and been granted equality but just aren't

3332
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:00,200
really getting it yet in some places.

3333
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:02,200
Despite being promised equality, the Faunus

3334
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:04,200
were subjected to discrimination and hate.

3335
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:06,200
Some specific people are still

3336
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:08,200
kind of racist. Faunus get bullied

3337
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:10,200
by some people in school. There's a

3338
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:12,200
no Faunus sign on one bar.

3339
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:14,200
There's nothing wrong with the system anymore.

3340
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:16,200
Individual racists are the problem.

3341
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:18,200
Since we aren't living in a racist

3342
01:56:18,200 --> 01:56:20,200
nightmare world, we can feel less bad

3343
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:22,200
about the status quo of the setting and more

3344
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:24,200
okay with the idea that the White Fang are bad.

3345
01:56:24,200 --> 01:56:26,200
But even then, they still have a roughly

3346
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:28,200
sympathetic goal. If a shadowy

3347
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:30,200
group were blowing up the businesses

3348
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:32,200
of people who refuse to serve Faunus or

3349
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:34,200
attacking people with unethical Faunus

3350
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:36,200
labor practices, which I assume is what

3351
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:38,200
a controversial labor force is,

3352
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:40,200
half the people watching might not realize

3353
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:42,200
these are supposed to be the bad guys.

3354
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:44,200
You can't have a story where the liberation movement

3355
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:46,200
has a point because then you're writing a story

3356
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:48,200
that's slightly more complex than

3357
01:56:48,200 --> 01:56:50,200
the help we need to stop the bad guys.

3358
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:52,200
And that's not fun.

3359
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:54,200
If you're writing a story for tiny babies,

3360
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:56,200
you want to be writing a generally okay world

3361
01:56:56,200 --> 01:56:58,200
that's being threatened by evil outsiders.

3362
01:56:58,200 --> 01:57:00,200
You know, like the monsters you could have

3363
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:02,200
already had be the main villains. So to add

3364
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:04,200
an extra level of moral simplification,

3365
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:06,200
they have the White Fang be recently under

3366
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:08,200
new leadership that are way more violent

3367
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:10,200
and pro-terrorism than normal.

3368
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:12,200
Five years ago, our leader stepped down

3369
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:14,200
and a new one took his place.

3370
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:16,200
A new leader with a new way of thinking.

3371
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:18,200
Okay, now they might have a point,

3372
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:20,200
but they're just going about it all wrong

3373
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:22,200
with this terrorism stuff.

3374
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:24,200
Now we can all get behind how they're the bad guys

3375
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:26,200
even if racism is wrong

3376
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:28,200
and they maybe have a point.

3377
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:30,200
Oh, I think she might be the bad guy,

3378
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:32,200
et cetera. You get the point.

3379
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:34,200
The story amounts to a long series

3380
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:36,200
of justifications for why the organization

3381
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:38,200
whose stated goal is the liberation

3382
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:40,200
of an oppressed people can be

3383
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:42,200
thought of as the antagonists.

3384
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:44,200
The White Fang used to be good guys,

3385
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:46,200
like agitating for progress in a nice way,

3386
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:48,200
politely asking for racism to end

3387
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:50,200
like good second-class citizens,

3388
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:52,200
but then a new leader stepped in

3389
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:54,200
who was more violent and aggressive,

3390
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:56,200
and now they're the bad guys and not respectable anymore.

3391
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:58,200
The problem is you're now effectively

3392
01:57:58,200 --> 01:58:00,200
writing a story in which the most prominent

3393
01:58:00,200 --> 01:58:02,200
villains are an oppressed people

3394
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:04,200
who are reacting wrong to being oppressed.

3395
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:06,200
Yeah, sure, racism is bad,

3396
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:08,200
but you're supposed to take it up with your congressman, guys.

3397
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:10,200
There's no nuance here.

3398
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:12,200
The White Fang are written to be as unequivocally

3399
01:58:12,200 --> 01:58:14,200
in the wrong as possible.

3400
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:16,200
The main White Fang member we're shown is that guy

3401
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:18,200
who didn't care about killing innocent civilians

3402
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:20,200
with bombs and who later turns out

3403
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:22,200
to want to kill all humans

3404
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:25,200
because he sees his people as the superior race.

3405
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:27,200
The Faunus are the dominant species

3406
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:29,200
of this planet.

3407
01:58:29,200 --> 01:58:31,200
Oh, also he wants to kill his ex-girlfriend

3408
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:33,200
for breaking up with him

3409
01:58:33,200 --> 01:58:35,200
over the fact he's evil.

3410
01:58:35,200 --> 01:58:37,200
♪♪

3411
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:39,200
The need to write an obvious villain

3412
01:58:39,200 --> 01:58:41,200
into the story has burned away

3413
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:43,200
any relevance to the issues

3414
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:45,200
the show was supposedly trying to explore

3415
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:47,200
with this aspect of the story.

3416
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:49,200
I will make it my mission

3417
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:52,200
to destroy everything you love.

3418
01:58:52,200 --> 01:58:54,200
What is the show trying to say?

3419
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:57,200
Racism is bad but don't kill civilians

3420
01:58:57,200 --> 01:58:59,200
or your ex-girlfriend?

3421
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:00,200
Okay.

3422
01:59:00,200 --> 01:59:02,200
If you want to talk about real world issues,

3423
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:04,200
you should actually do it

3424
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:06,200
and if you don't, you don't have to.

3425
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:09,200
You don't have to have a take on racism

3426
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:11,200
and you especially don't have one

3427
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:13,200
when you set your story in a fantasy world

3428
01:59:13,200 --> 01:59:15,200
where racism is over and the real bad guy

3429
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:17,200
is a protest group that turned evil.

3430
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:19,200
I never wanted this.

3431
01:59:19,200 --> 01:59:21,200
I wanted equality.

3432
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:23,200
So, hey, remember Velvet?

3433
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:25,200
That one character who seems like

3434
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:27,200
some members of the team intended to be

3435
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:29,200
more of a part of the story

3436
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:31,200
and then she just wasn't?

3437
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:33,200
It makes it just a little bit more egregious

3438
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:35,200
that the story is kind of about

3439
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:37,200
the persecution of her fucking race.

3440
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:39,200
Like, how do you fuck this up this badly?

3441
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:42,200
And for the record, that is not how human male teenagers

3442
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:44,200
would treat bunny girls if they were real.

3443
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:45,200
They would wait on them on hand and foot

3444
01:59:45,200 --> 01:59:47,200
and beg them to step on me.

3445
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:49,200
Absolutely no one was holding a gun

3446
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:51,200
to Miles and Kerry's heads and saying

3447
01:59:51,200 --> 01:59:53,200
to make the show about how they think Malcolm X

3448
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:55,200
could have toned it down a little.

3449
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:56,200
They did this by choice.

3450
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:58,200
They were given free reign to write a story

3451
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:00,200
and connect the dots on Monty's fights

3452
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:02,200
and this is what they made?

3453
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:04,200
Guys, I don't think you have as much to say

3454
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:06,200
on this topic as you initially thought.

3455
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:08,200
Instead of saying, oh, you know, the humans have a side.

3456
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:10,200
They should just respect us more.

3457
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:12,200
He turned into, yeah, let's get rid of the humans

3458
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:14,200
and then they'll respect us because they'll be dead.

3459
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:16,200
Let me just read that back to you

3460
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:18,200
just to make that more clear.

3461
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:20,200
He turned into, yeah,

3462
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:22,200
let's get rid of the humans

3463
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:24,200
and then they'll respect us

3464
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:26,200
because they'll be dead.

3465
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:28,200
Kerry,

3466
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:30,200
are you sure you want to go with this?

3467
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:32,200
There's also the problem of representation.

3468
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:34,200
I'm not gonna criticize the show's diversity

3469
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:36,200
or lack of it that much because I don't think

3470
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:38,200
that's really my criticism to make

3471
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:40,200
and I don't want to risk making it poorly on behalf of people

3472
02:00:40,200 --> 02:00:42,200
who could say something better about it than me.

3473
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:44,200
There are doubtless plenty of people a whole lot

3474
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:46,200
less white than me who like the show

3475
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:48,200
and don't think it has a representation problem

3476
02:00:48,200 --> 02:00:50,200
although that's not saying much.

3477
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:52,200
Most brands of literal cracker are browner than me.

3478
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:54,200
Oh, shit, my fucking laundry.

3479
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:56,200
Besides, I'm sure some people will tell you

3480
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:58,200
there's plenty of Black people in the first season.

3481
02:00:58,200 --> 02:01:00,200
However, I can't help but notice

3482
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:02,200
that they have managed to write a show

3483
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:04,200
that tries, fails, but tries

3484
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:06,200
to deal with the impact of racism

3485
02:01:06,200 --> 02:01:08,200
on a group of people in society but in such a way

3486
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:10,200
that they didn't have to have too many

3487
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:12,200
non-white characters.

3488
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:14,200
Instead, they invented a fictional race

3489
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:16,200
which consists almost entirely in the story

3490
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:18,200
of white women with cute animal ears

3491
02:01:18,200 --> 02:01:20,200
and a cool buff white guy

3492
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:22,200
with a tail. This was a

3493
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:24,200
really clever decision.

3494
02:01:24,200 --> 02:01:26,200
It turns out the way to get weebs to understand

3495
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:28,200
racism is to make the target a cat girl.

3496
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:30,200
The white fang are like the Black Panthers

3497
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:32,200
but with the emphasis on the panther.

3498
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:34,200
I mean, sure, regular racism

3499
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:36,200
is over in Remnant but here in the

3500
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:38,200
real world, if there were too many Black characters

3501
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:40,200
some of your audience members might

3502
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:42,200
start to smell politics.

3503
02:01:42,200 --> 02:01:44,200
Now who will buy our boop shirts?

3504
02:01:44,200 --> 02:01:46,200
Black lives matter, especially when they're

3505
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:48,200
white people with vague animal characteristics

3506
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:50,200
but, you know, we can't risk

3507
02:01:50,200 --> 02:01:52,200
having too many people of color

3508
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:54,200
in our show about racism.

3509
02:01:54,200 --> 02:01:56,200
By the way, you know this animated bit

3510
02:01:56,200 --> 02:01:58,200
I showed you? That's Blake telling her backstory

3511
02:01:58,200 --> 02:02:00,200
to Sun. Yes, Sun,

3512
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:02,200
another Faunus. She is telling the backstory

3513
02:02:02,200 --> 02:02:04,200
of a movement Faunus are intimately aware

3514
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:06,200
of that Sun says he knows about

3515
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:08,200
Are you familiar with the white fang?

3516
02:02:08,200 --> 02:02:10,200
Of course. I don't think there's a Faunus

3517
02:02:10,200 --> 02:02:12,200
on the planet who hasn't heard of them.

3518
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:14,200
which describes the history of the treatment of Faunus

3519
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:16,200
to one of the only other Faunus

3520
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:18,200
in the story. Exposition, guys.

3521
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:20,200
Have her be telling this to someone who might

3522
02:02:20,200 --> 02:02:22,200
not know it like any

3523
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:24,200
other character in the show.

3524
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:26,200
Have you told your friends any of this?

3525
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:28,200
Even Sun's asking why she's telling him.

3526
02:02:28,200 --> 02:02:30,200
And what's up with all of these teens preparing

3527
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:32,200
elaborate speeches about their lives

3528
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:34,200
and the world? If you try and get away with a monologue

3529
02:02:34,200 --> 02:02:36,200
that long in my household, your parents

3530
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:38,200
tell you you're a horrible son and they hate you.

3531
02:02:38,200 --> 02:02:40,200
When you remove all of the

3532
02:02:40,200 --> 02:02:42,200
moral and ethical dimensions from

3533
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:44,200
a story, the story disappears

3534
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:46,200
too. When it comes down to it,

3535
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:48,200
the white fang are a bunch of angry bad guys

3536
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:50,200
in masks and all this talk about how

3537
02:02:50,200 --> 02:02:52,200
they're just reacting to mistreatment.

3538
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:54,200
But don't worry, guys. Things are fine.

3539
02:02:54,200 --> 02:02:56,200
What they're reacting is boring

3540
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:58,200
window dressing on a story that's basically

3541
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:00,200
about how we have to stop the bad men

3542
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:02,200
from blowing up the city and stealing all

3543
02:03:02,200 --> 02:03:04,200
of the precious jewels. The gang

3544
02:03:04,200 --> 02:03:06,200
gleefully kill dozens of white fang

3545
02:03:06,200 --> 02:03:08,200
members, throwing them off a train at high

3546
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:10,200
speed where their remains will be shattered

3547
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:12,200
and smashed into a pulp, unburied

3548
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:14,200
in a collapsing tunnel covered in

3549
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:16,200
monsters and explosives, and then later

3550
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:18,200
the only exit from this monster-infested

3551
02:03:18,200 --> 02:03:20,200
tunnel is sealed shut, trapping

3552
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:22,200
any of the survivors inside to

3553
02:03:23,200 --> 02:03:25,200
And sure, maybe they experienced racism

3554
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:27,200
and suffering, but they decided

3555
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:29,200
to be evil so they got what was coming.

3556
02:03:29,200 --> 02:03:31,200
If you kill one of these guys, your conscience

3557
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:33,200
is clean. Oh, look, that one was black.

3558
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:35,200
Do you feel represented yet? I'm not saying

3559
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:37,200
you should have sympathy for these characters and that

3560
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:39,200
killing them is wrong. What I'm saying is

3561
02:03:39,200 --> 02:03:41,200
it should be at least slightly more

3562
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:43,200
complicated than this, and the fact the story

3563
02:03:43,200 --> 02:03:45,200
is written so that these characters are

3564
02:03:45,200 --> 02:03:47,200
just evil is a massive flaw.

3565
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:49,200
It's like in the Dark Knight Rises.

3566
02:03:49,200 --> 02:03:51,200
Bane basically has a

3567
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:53,200
point. Gotham is corrupt, and the

3568
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:55,200
people are oppressed by a system that seeks to profit

3569
02:03:55,200 --> 02:03:57,200
from them and find new ways to spy

3570
02:03:57,200 --> 02:03:59,200
on and criminalize them if they resist.

3571
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:01,200
The Occupy Wall Street movement had a lot to

3572
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:03,200
say, and a lot of it was true.

3573
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:05,200
This is a stock exchange. There's no money you can steal.

3574
02:04:05,200 --> 02:04:07,200
Really?

3575
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:09,200
Then why are you people here? But if you put

3576
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:11,200
that in your film, that means something's deeply

3577
02:04:11,200 --> 02:04:13,200
wrong with your actual society,

3578
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:15,200
so Bane also wants to

3579
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:17,200
kill everyone with a nuke, so now

3580
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:19,200
when Batman beats the shit out of him and everyone

3581
02:04:19,200 --> 02:04:21,200
who stands in his way, it's not because Batman

3582
02:04:21,200 --> 02:04:23,200
is a tool of a corrupt establishment.

3583
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:25,200
It's because he's heroically stopping this definitely

3584
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:27,200
bad bad guy from killing

3585
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:29,200
everyone. The moral complexity of the story

3586
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:31,200
exists purely to sound cool

3587
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:33,200
and get thrown away before it gets anyone

3588
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:35,200
to think about the actual problems with our

3589
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:37,200
world. The Dark Knight Rises is

3590
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:39,200
complete bollocks because a villain who

3591
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:41,200
might have a point is consciously

3592
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:43,200
rewritten into a bad man in a

3593
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:45,200
mask with a big bomb who Batman

3594
02:04:45,200 --> 02:04:47,200
needs to punch to win. Yay.

3595
02:04:47,200 --> 02:04:49,200
Good guys hitting the bad guy.

3596
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:51,200
Don't think about Wall Street. The writers of RWBY

3597
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:53,200
want to look like they're talking about

3598
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:55,200
serious real world problems because that

3599
02:04:55,200 --> 02:04:57,200
seems cool and clever and meaningful,

3600
02:04:57,200 --> 02:04:59,200
but they don't want to run the risk of spoiling

3601
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:01,200
the cartoon fun, and they certainly don't want

3602
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:03,200
to risk the people in their audience who think talking

3603
02:05:03,200 --> 02:05:05,200
about racism is for SJWs to stop

3604
02:05:05,200 --> 02:05:07,200
watching, so we're left with generic

3605
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:09,200
masked bad guys who want to use a train

3606
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:11,200
to blow up a city and try

3607
02:05:11,200 --> 02:05:13,200
to cut off one of our main character's

3608
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:15,200
heads with a chainsaw,

3609
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:17,200
but maybe some of them have sad backstories

3610
02:05:17,200 --> 02:05:19,200
behind them being evil murderers

3611
02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:21,200
who want to kill their ex-girlfriend?

3612
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:23,200
Oh, wow, how clever. No thanks.

3613
02:05:23,200 --> 02:05:25,200
In the actual modern day right now,

3614
02:05:25,200 --> 02:05:27,200
in fact, literally right now,

3615
02:05:27,200 --> 02:05:29,200
there are people marching out there in the streets

3616
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:31,200
against systemic injustices,

3617
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:33,200
racism, and police brutality,

3618
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:35,200
and a not insignificant amount of people

3619
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:37,200
are dismissing all of this as opportunism,

3620
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:39,200
as looting, rioting,

3621
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:41,200
people trying to cause chaos and anarchy

3622
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:43,200
for no reason. When you tell a story

3623
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:45,200
with such a massive fixation on a group

3624
02:05:45,200 --> 02:05:47,200
like this, what you're doing is saying

3625
02:05:47,200 --> 02:05:49,200
that there are people in real life like this.

3626
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:51,200
Ruby is a deeply stupid

3627
02:05:51,200 --> 02:05:53,200
person's idea of what

3628
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:55,200
racial politics are like. Watching this show

3629
02:05:55,200 --> 02:05:57,200
through now, I can't help

3630
02:05:57,200 --> 02:05:59,200
but be struck with the kind of horrible

3631
02:05:59,200 --> 02:06:01,200
feeling that some people are gonna watch

3632
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:03,200
this and go, yeah, that's

3633
02:06:03,200 --> 02:06:05,200
what they're like, and the idea

3634
02:06:05,200 --> 02:06:07,200
of this show playing into people's

3635
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:09,200
worst instincts is frankly

3636
02:06:09,200 --> 02:06:11,200
disgusting, but even on a basic story

3637
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:13,200
level, having such a simplistic faction

3638
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:15,200
like this driving so much of the plot

3639
02:06:15,200 --> 02:06:17,200
means that all their parts of the plot

3640
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:19,200
basically suck. The potential

3641
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:21,200
of this entire aspect of the story

3642
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:23,200
is seemingly purposefully declawed,

3643
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:25,200
rendering the whole thing as pointless

3644
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:27,200
as if it hadn't happened. The bad guys

3645
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:29,200
could have just been some evil, corrupted monsters

3646
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:31,200
who chose to be bad because they're

3647
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:33,200
bad for no reason, and the story

3648
02:06:33,200 --> 02:06:35,200
would have been better because it would have been more honest

3649
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:37,200
and a lot less uncomfortable.

3650
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:39,200
The end point of this bottomless pit of

3651
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:41,200
compromises is, well,

3652
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:43,200
a compromised story. A story

3653
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:45,200
about nothing telling you very

3654
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:47,200
unconvincingly that it's about something

3655
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:49,200
actually important in our world

3656
02:06:49,200 --> 02:06:51,200
right now. No wonder the introduction

3657
02:06:51,200 --> 02:06:53,200
didn't mention them. They might as well

3658
02:06:53,200 --> 02:06:55,200
not have been there.

3659
02:06:57,200 --> 02:06:59,200
We can't really recount the history

3660
02:06:59,200 --> 02:07:01,200
of RWBY without talking about the death of

3661
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:03,200
its creator, can we? After the end of volume

3662
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:05,200
two and while in early production

3663
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:07,200
on volume three, Monty Oum passed away

3664
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:09,200
very suddenly of an allergic

3665
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:11,200
reaction during routine surgery.

3666
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:13,200
Monty's death was a really tragic event

3667
02:07:13,200 --> 02:07:15,200
that affected a lot of people, both

3668
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:17,200
at Rooster Teeth and in Monty's

3669
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:19,200
audience. Monty was well known as a

3670
02:07:19,200 --> 02:07:21,200
relentlessly passionate worker, and a

3671
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:23,200
phrase commonly attributed to him by many,

3672
02:07:23,200 --> 02:07:25,200
including his widow, was,

3673
02:07:25,200 --> 02:07:27,200
so to carry on his passion,

3674
02:07:27,200 --> 02:07:29,200
almost in tribute to his life,

3675
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:31,200
they continued making the show.

3676
02:07:31,200 --> 02:07:33,200
I'm going to keep analyzing the show now,

3677
02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:35,200
but as a fan of Monty's work since

3678
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:37,200
Haloid came out, I want to mention that

3679
02:07:37,200 --> 02:07:39,200
I don't feel like I've had room to really celebrate

3680
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:41,200
his specific skill and talent in this

3681
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:43,200
video, so I'm working on another one just

3682
02:07:43,200 --> 02:07:45,200
about that. I've been a fan of Monty's for

3683
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:47,200
most of my adult life, and I've wanted

3684
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:49,200
to gush about why his stuff is so great,

3685
02:07:49,200 --> 02:07:51,200
but to make sure this video has any kind of

3686
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:53,200
decent pace, I've had to cut most of it out.

3687
02:07:53,200 --> 02:07:55,200
I'll try and have that video done soon.

3688
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:57,200
So, volume three obviously

3689
02:07:57,200 --> 02:07:59,200
struggles with a lot of issues. It's still got

3690
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:01,200
a lot of the things we've already discussed.

3691
02:08:01,200 --> 02:08:03,200
It has the additional problem of the team having

3692
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:05,200
to make do without its original creator,

3693
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:07,200
but if anything, the biggest problem

3694
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:09,200
volume three has is that it gets good.

3695
02:08:09,200 --> 02:08:11,200
Volume three opens on a big

3696
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:13,200
tournament between teams from all the

3697
02:08:13,200 --> 02:08:15,200
anime warrior schools of the world.

3698
02:08:15,200 --> 02:08:17,200
Every single anime out there eventually does

3699
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:19,200
their tournament arc, and, you know,

3700
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:21,200
we wanted RWBY to have its version of that.

3701
02:08:21,200 --> 02:08:23,200
Because how better to prove

3702
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:25,200
that RWBY is just like an anime

3703
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:27,200
than to give it a tournament arc?

3704
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:29,200
I mean, a story would

3705
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:31,200
have been nice, but mid-fight, the announcers

3706
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:33,200
played by the professors from the first

3707
02:08:33,200 --> 02:08:35,200
two seasons explain the entire tournament

3708
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:37,200
system. For those of you

3709
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:39,200
just now joining us, the show

3710
02:08:39,200 --> 02:08:41,200
pauses to tell you how the entire

3711
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:43,200
system works. Again, exposition,

3712
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:45,200
guys. That's just not how you do it.

3713
02:08:45,200 --> 02:08:47,200
If this is your first time watching,

3714
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:49,200
allow us to break down the rules.

3715
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:51,200
They're explaining this in the middle

3716
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:53,200
of the fight at the worst possible time

3717
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:55,200
to be explaining it. In fact, look at how

3718
02:08:55,200 --> 02:08:57,200
even worse done this is when you realize

3719
02:08:57,200 --> 02:08:59,200
it's being done diegetically. Imagine

3720
02:08:59,200 --> 02:09:01,200
watching the tournament on TV when

3721
02:09:01,200 --> 02:09:03,200
during a fight that is currently

3722
02:09:03,200 --> 02:09:05,200
underway, the announcers interrupt

3723
02:09:05,200 --> 02:09:07,200
to tell you how the tournament works.

3724
02:09:07,200 --> 02:09:09,200
In case people who've never seen the tournament

3725
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:11,200
before just tuned in,

3726
02:09:11,200 --> 02:09:13,200
there are infinite other ways of conveying

3727
02:09:13,200 --> 02:09:15,200
this information to the audience, and they chose

3728
02:09:15,200 --> 02:09:17,200
now in this incredibly clunky

3729
02:09:17,200 --> 02:09:19,200
way?

3730
02:09:21,700 --> 02:09:23,700
If you're just joining us, the objective of golf

3731
02:09:23,700 --> 02:09:25,700
is to get the ball in the hole

3732
02:09:25,700 --> 02:09:27,700
in as few strokes as possible.

3733
02:09:27,700 --> 02:09:29,700
Points are tabulated by the amount of strokes

3734
02:09:29,700 --> 02:09:31,700
under par, and remember, it's the lowest

3735
02:09:31,700 --> 02:09:33,700
score that wins. Oh, it appears

3736
02:09:33,700 --> 02:09:35,700
Jimmy has finished the course while I was

3737
02:09:35,700 --> 02:09:37,700
talking. So the exposition is about as well

3738
02:09:37,700 --> 02:09:39,700
done as it's always been. The fights also

3739
02:09:39,700 --> 02:09:41,700
feel written now. Much more

3740
02:09:41,700 --> 02:09:43,700
emphasis is placed on dialogue

3741
02:09:43,700 --> 02:09:45,700
and specific moves than

3742
02:09:45,700 --> 02:09:47,700
before, which slows things down

3743
02:09:47,700 --> 02:09:49,700
and really messes with the pace. If you're

3744
02:09:49,700 --> 02:09:51,700
just joining us, one of the big problems with the

3745
02:09:51,700 --> 02:09:53,700
first two volumes was the constant influx

3746
02:09:53,700 --> 02:09:55,700
of new characters who aren't on screen

3747
02:09:55,700 --> 02:09:57,700
enough for you to learn anything interesting about them

3748
02:09:57,700 --> 02:09:59,700
or care but manage to suck up enough

3749
02:09:59,700 --> 02:10:01,700
screen time that the actual characters

3750
02:10:01,700 --> 02:10:03,700
don't have room to breathe. Remember how

3751
02:10:03,700 --> 02:10:05,700
Neptune's entire relevance to the story of the

3752
02:10:05,700 --> 02:10:07,700
show was that Weiss wanted to go to the prom

3753
02:10:07,700 --> 02:10:09,700
with him and how after that I never

3754
02:10:09,700 --> 02:10:11,700
had to bring him up again? So all the

3755
02:10:11,700 --> 02:10:13,700
screen time that went into him was a waste, wasn't

3756
02:10:13,700 --> 02:10:15,700
it? The writers have noticed this problem

3757
02:10:15,700 --> 02:10:17,700
and decided the solution is to add a hundred

3758
02:10:17,700 --> 02:10:19,700
million more characters. Since it's the

3759
02:10:19,700 --> 02:10:21,700
tournament arc now, just like in real

3760
02:10:21,700 --> 02:10:23,700
animes, we get new teams to throw

3761
02:10:23,700 --> 02:10:25,700
into the story for our other characters we

3762
02:10:25,700 --> 02:10:27,700
kinda know to fight against, and

3763
02:10:27,700 --> 02:10:29,700
you know exactly which ones you won't

3764
02:10:29,700 --> 02:10:31,700
see in fights because they're just 2D

3765
02:10:31,700 --> 02:10:33,700
concept art. But that's not all!

3766
02:10:33,700 --> 02:10:35,700
We also have more characters who

3767
02:10:35,700 --> 02:10:37,700
are just here now.

3768
02:10:37,700 --> 02:10:39,700
Winter Schnee, Weiss' sister,

3769
02:10:39,700 --> 02:10:41,700
is here to not do much of anything

3770
02:10:41,700 --> 02:10:43,700
and just kinda turn up for a couple

3771
02:10:43,700 --> 02:10:45,700
episodes to give Weiss a pep talk

3772
02:10:45,700 --> 02:10:47,700
and explain for the benefit of the audience

3773
02:10:47,700 --> 02:10:49,700
how their semblance works. To Weiss,

3774
02:10:49,700 --> 02:10:51,700
the only other person who already

3775
02:10:51,700 --> 02:10:53,700
knows how it fucking works!

3776
02:10:53,700 --> 02:10:55,700
Oh, and also to have a pointless fight with Crow,

3777
02:10:55,700 --> 02:10:57,700
another character who has finally turned

3778
02:10:57,700 --> 02:10:59,700
up after getting name-dropped a bunch

3779
02:10:59,700 --> 02:11:01,700
in previous seasons. Here's a thing you probably

3780
02:11:01,700 --> 02:11:03,700
noticed by now, but every character is usually

3781
02:11:03,700 --> 02:11:05,700
named for a fairy tale character of some kind

3782
02:11:05,700 --> 02:11:07,700
like Ruby is Red Riding Hood, Nora

3783
02:11:07,700 --> 02:11:09,700
is Thor, Jean Arc is Joan

3784
02:11:09,700 --> 02:11:11,700
of Arc, Blake is fucking

3785
02:11:11,700 --> 02:11:13,700
bad, and Crow, Glinda,

3786
02:11:13,700 --> 02:11:15,700
Ozpin, the General, and some others

3787
02:11:15,700 --> 02:11:17,700
are based vaguely after characters from

3788
02:11:17,700 --> 02:11:19,700
the Wizard of Oz. Anyway, the gimmick is wearing

3789
02:11:19,700 --> 02:11:21,700
so thin now that they're really

3790
02:11:21,700 --> 02:11:23,700
struggling to come up with characters that fit

3791
02:11:23,700 --> 02:11:25,700
this scheme. In one of the fights, Yang and Weiss

3792
02:11:25,700 --> 02:11:27,700
fight against Neon Cat,

3793
02:11:27,700 --> 02:11:29,700
a Faunus character inspired by

3794
02:11:29,700 --> 02:11:31,700
Nyan Cat, and Flint Coal, the son

3795
02:11:31,700 --> 02:11:33,700
of a dust store owner who Weiss' family

3796
02:11:33,700 --> 02:11:35,700
wait, Flint Coal?

3797
02:11:35,700 --> 02:11:37,700
This is like the second black

3798
02:11:37,700 --> 02:11:39,700
character in the show and his name is

3799
02:11:39,700 --> 02:11:41,700
Flint Coal!

3800
02:11:41,700 --> 02:11:43,700
Oh, no! Okay, so

3801
02:11:43,700 --> 02:11:45,700
it's not as bad as it sounds. It's actually

3802
02:11:45,700 --> 02:11:47,700
a clever, clever reference

3803
02:11:47,700 --> 02:11:49,700
to Rooster Teeth's Minecraft

3804
02:11:49,700 --> 02:11:50,700
Let's Play.

3805
02:11:50,700 --> 02:11:52,700
Dude, I got Coal and Flint?

3806
02:11:52,700 --> 02:11:54,700
Oh, you're set. That'd be a cool name.

3807
02:11:54,700 --> 02:11:56,700
Flint Coal. Would it though? Yeah, you'd be like

3808
02:11:56,700 --> 02:11:58,700
a, like an international private investigator

3809
02:11:58,700 --> 02:12:00,700
mystery type. You'd have to be black though, right?

3810
02:12:00,700 --> 02:12:01,700
I dig it.

3811
02:12:01,700 --> 02:12:03,700
What's his weapon called anyway?

3812
02:12:03,700 --> 02:12:05,700
You see, all the characters' weapons have names.

3813
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:07,700
They get mentioned in behind-the-scenes material

3814
02:12:07,700 --> 02:12:09,700
or named in the show. Crescent Rose.

3815
02:12:09,700 --> 02:12:11,700
One of the most... Mertonaster.

3816
02:12:11,700 --> 02:12:13,700
Gambol! Shrow?

3817
02:12:13,700 --> 02:12:15,700
But Flint Coal. Flint

3818
02:12:15,700 --> 02:12:17,700
Coal doesn't appear in

3819
02:12:17,700 --> 02:12:19,700
many other RWBY materials, so

3820
02:12:19,700 --> 02:12:21,700
we've not had an opportunity to learn his

3821
02:12:21,700 --> 02:12:23,700
weapon's name, so the RWBY wiki

3822
02:12:23,700 --> 02:12:25,700
has had no choice but

3823
02:12:25,700 --> 02:12:27,700
to list it as

3824
02:12:27,700 --> 02:12:29,700
Weapon Trumpet!

3825
02:12:29,700 --> 02:12:31,700
Ha ha ha ha!

3826
02:12:31,700 --> 02:12:33,700
Ha ha ha ha!

3827
02:12:33,700 --> 02:12:35,700
But the thing about season three is that it

3828
02:12:35,700 --> 02:12:37,700
gets good. Midway through this volume,

3829
02:12:37,700 --> 02:12:39,700
the plot of RWBY

3830
02:12:39,700 --> 02:12:41,700
starts. The main characters take

3831
02:12:41,700 --> 02:12:43,700
Pyrrha aside and say, hey, so what's actually

3832
02:12:43,700 --> 02:12:45,700
happening here is there are four maidens?

3833
02:12:45,700 --> 02:12:47,700
Women with incredible magical

3834
02:12:47,700 --> 02:12:49,700
powers. Not like semblances or dust.

3835
02:12:49,700 --> 02:12:51,700
They're not magic. This is real magic.

3836
02:12:51,700 --> 02:12:53,700
Each time a maiden dies, someone else inherits

3837
02:12:53,700 --> 02:12:55,700
the maiden's power. Oh, so it's just

3838
02:12:55,700 --> 02:12:57,700
Avatar again? Really? Okay.

3839
02:12:57,700 --> 02:12:59,700
Each of the maidens represents one of the

3840
02:12:59,700 --> 02:13:01,700
four seasons. It's the four seasons,

3841
02:13:01,700 --> 02:13:03,700
not the four elements, so it's not like Avatar.

3842
02:13:03,700 --> 02:13:05,700
Oh, hang on. There's four different elements

3843
02:13:05,700 --> 02:13:07,700
of dust, aren't there? Wow, it's Avatar all the

3844
02:13:07,700 --> 02:13:09,700
way down, isn't it? It's really boring,

3845
02:13:09,700 --> 02:13:11,700
and the rules of who gets to be a maiden and why

3846
02:13:11,700 --> 02:13:13,700
are really silly, and the exposition of it

3847
02:13:13,700 --> 02:13:15,700
is bad, but it's not that bad because

3848
02:13:15,700 --> 02:13:17,700
the show has now introduced Crow.

3849
02:13:17,700 --> 02:13:19,700
How does the power choose?

3850
02:13:19,700 --> 02:13:21,700
Through a series of stupid and

3851
02:13:21,700 --> 02:13:23,700
convoluted rules. The writers made

3852
02:13:23,700 --> 02:13:25,700
the genuinely clever decision to have

3853
02:13:25,700 --> 02:13:27,700
him annoyed and bored by

3854
02:13:27,700 --> 02:13:29,700
most of the characters and plot of RWBY.

3855
02:13:29,700 --> 02:13:31,700
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?

3856
02:13:31,700 --> 02:13:33,700
No.

3857
02:13:33,700 --> 02:13:35,700
Crow spends half the show ridiculing

3858
02:13:35,700 --> 02:13:37,700
all the characters that have been taking themselves

3859
02:13:37,700 --> 02:13:39,700
seriously for hours with no one questioning

3860
02:13:39,700 --> 02:13:41,700
them before. If you were one of my men,

3861
02:13:41,700 --> 02:13:43,700
I would have you shot. If I was one of

3862
02:13:43,700 --> 02:13:45,700
your men, I'd shoot myself.

3863
02:13:45,700 --> 02:13:47,700
So even if you aren't really enjoying

3864
02:13:47,700 --> 02:13:49,700
the story or the ridiculous amount of plot

3865
02:13:49,700 --> 02:13:51,700
being dumped in your lap regarding

3866
02:13:51,700 --> 02:13:53,700
the maidens and Cinder, the real

3867
02:13:53,700 --> 02:13:55,700
villain of the last two seasons who hasn't done

3868
02:13:55,700 --> 02:13:57,700
much, who it turns out actually has

3869
02:13:57,700 --> 02:13:59,700
stolen half of a maiden's power and

3870
02:13:59,700 --> 02:14:01,700
might inherit the other half if the maiden dies,

3871
02:14:01,700 --> 02:14:03,700
it's not so bad because another

3872
02:14:03,700 --> 02:14:05,700
character in the scene isn't enjoying

3873
02:14:05,700 --> 02:14:07,700
it either. It's ironic that everyone else

3874
02:14:07,700 --> 02:14:09,700
is birdbrained. So it turns out

3875
02:14:09,700 --> 02:14:11,700
that the story's really always been about

3876
02:14:11,700 --> 02:14:13,700
these four maidens, each representing

3877
02:14:13,700 --> 02:14:15,700
one of the four seasons and Cinder

3878
02:14:15,700 --> 02:14:17,700
wanting to cause enough commotion that

3879
02:14:17,700 --> 02:14:19,700
she can get to the fall maiden and kill

3880
02:14:19,700 --> 02:14:21,700
her to ensure she gets her power.

3881
02:14:21,700 --> 02:14:23,700
There's some pretty genuine drama now as Pyrrha

3882
02:14:23,700 --> 02:14:25,700
is offered the choice to take the maiden's soul

3883
02:14:25,700 --> 02:14:27,700
into her body, a process which will probably

3884
02:14:27,700 --> 02:14:29,700
kill her but prevent the power falling

3885
02:14:29,700 --> 02:14:31,700
into the wrong hands. A character has to choose

3886
02:14:31,700 --> 02:14:33,700
between having her own life and

3887
02:14:33,700 --> 02:14:35,700
doing what might be the right thing for

3888
02:14:35,700 --> 02:14:37,700
the world. Pyrrha is actually given

3889
02:14:37,700 --> 02:14:39,700
an identity and questions

3890
02:14:39,700 --> 02:14:41,700
and important choices to explore

3891
02:14:41,700 --> 02:14:43,700
outside of her relationship to Jaune

3892
02:14:43,700 --> 02:14:45,700
and it makes her the strongest character

3893
02:14:45,700 --> 02:14:47,700
in the show. It makes it easier to ignore

3894
02:14:47,700 --> 02:14:49,700
that the plot is basically yet another avatar

3895
02:14:49,700 --> 02:14:51,700
thing. There being people with magical

3896
02:14:51,700 --> 02:14:53,700
powers whose abilities go to someone else

3897
02:14:53,700 --> 02:14:55,700
when they die is very avatar

3898
02:14:55,700 --> 02:14:57,700
adjacent, but you don't even think about it

3899
02:14:57,700 --> 02:14:59,700
because the exposition gets made fun of by

3900
02:14:59,700 --> 02:15:01,700
one character and another character has to make

3901
02:15:01,700 --> 02:15:03,700
a real choice about it, so it actually

3902
02:15:03,700 --> 02:15:05,700
works. One of Cinder's goons,

3903
02:15:05,700 --> 02:15:07,700
Emerald, has the power to make people hallucinate

3904
02:15:07,700 --> 02:15:09,700
and makes Yang think her guy's attacking

3905
02:15:09,700 --> 02:15:11,700
her after a round has ended, and while

3906
02:15:11,700 --> 02:15:13,700
she thinks she's defending herself, the rest of the world

3907
02:15:13,700 --> 02:15:15,700
sees what's actually happening, which is Yang

3908
02:15:15,700 --> 02:15:17,700
breaking a guy's fucking leg

3909
02:15:17,700 --> 02:15:19,700
for no reason. Don't worry. He's a villain

3910
02:15:19,700 --> 02:15:21,700
and he's in on it and he has robot legs,

3911
02:15:21,700 --> 02:15:23,700
so it's fine, but no one knows he has robot legs

3912
02:15:23,700 --> 02:15:25,700
so this causes a lot of unrest among

3913
02:15:25,700 --> 02:15:27,700
the people watching and everyone seeing it on TV

3914
02:15:27,700 --> 02:15:29,700
and fear and anxiety attract

3915
02:15:29,700 --> 02:15:31,700
Grimm, so they all start ominously moving

3916
02:15:31,700 --> 02:15:33,700
toward the city and Yang's freaking

3917
02:15:33,700 --> 02:15:35,700
the fuck out because she thinks she's losing her

3918
02:15:35,700 --> 02:15:37,700
mind and everyone's mad at her. It's like

3919
02:15:37,700 --> 02:15:39,700
plot! There's plot happening, guys!

3920
02:15:39,700 --> 02:15:41,700
Everybody, wake up! The characters

3921
02:15:41,700 --> 02:15:43,700
finally have to do something!

3922
02:15:43,700 --> 02:15:45,700
Then, right after, while Pyrrha and Penny

3923
02:15:45,700 --> 02:15:47,700
are fighting in the tournament, Emerald makes Pyrrha

3924
02:15:47,700 --> 02:15:49,700
see way worse attacks coming, which

3925
02:15:49,700 --> 02:15:51,700
causes her to really push her power

3926
02:15:51,700 --> 02:15:53,700
and the tiny wires all Penny's weapons

3927
02:15:53,700 --> 02:15:55,700
are attached to wrap around Penny

3928
02:15:55,700 --> 02:15:57,700
and Penny, the character we've known

3929
02:15:57,700 --> 02:15:59,700
for a whole season plus, like, five seconds

3930
02:15:59,700 --> 02:16:01,700
at the end of volume one, is torn

3931
02:16:01,700 --> 02:16:03,700
to pieces. I mean,

3932
02:16:03,700 --> 02:16:05,700
holy shit! She's a robot

3933
02:16:05,700 --> 02:16:07,700
so it's not like a disembowelment

3934
02:16:07,700 --> 02:16:09,700
but this was a character and she's

3935
02:16:09,700 --> 02:16:11,700
dead. It's fucked up.

3936
02:16:11,700 --> 02:16:13,700
Everyone goes wild.

3937
02:16:13,700 --> 02:16:15,700
Cinder hacks the main frame

3938
02:16:15,700 --> 02:16:17,700
and gives a speech about humans

3939
02:16:17,700 --> 02:16:19,700
bad and a million billion Grimm

3940
02:16:19,700 --> 02:16:21,700
descend on the city and school

3941
02:16:21,700 --> 02:16:23,700
and the last hour of volume three starts

3942
02:16:23,700 --> 02:16:25,700
with a fucking bang. Everything

3943
02:16:25,700 --> 02:16:27,700
bad is happening to everyone

3944
02:16:27,700 --> 02:16:29,700
everywhere all the time. A main character

3945
02:16:29,700 --> 02:16:31,700
is fucking dead in pieces.

3946
02:16:31,700 --> 02:16:33,700
People are crying. This isn't your daddy's

3947
02:16:33,700 --> 02:16:35,700
generic and then bad guys attack the

3948
02:16:35,700 --> 02:16:37,700
city. This isn't volume two shit.

3949
02:16:37,700 --> 02:16:39,700
The city is being destroyed.

3950
02:16:39,700 --> 02:16:41,700
Caligula gets broken out of the prison

3951
02:16:41,700 --> 02:16:43,700
he was locked in at the end of season two and

3952
02:16:43,700 --> 02:16:45,700
starts hacking the army robots and blowing

3953
02:16:45,700 --> 02:16:47,700
ships out of the sky. Everything's

3954
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:49,700
happening. Everyone's fucked.

3955
02:16:49,700 --> 02:16:51,700
Bring them to their knees.

3956
02:16:51,700 --> 02:16:53,700
The civil rights protesters still talk

3957
02:16:53,700 --> 02:16:55,700
like they're fucking evil but, I mean, generally

3958
02:16:55,700 --> 02:16:57,700
it's pretty good. Ruby's threatening a giant

3959
02:16:57,700 --> 02:16:59,700
bird with one of Penny's swords because she's

3960
02:16:59,700 --> 02:17:01,700
too distraught to think straight and

3961
02:17:01,700 --> 02:17:03,700
then it flies at her and everyone's

3962
02:17:03,700 --> 02:17:05,700
lockers ram into it and pin it to the ground

3963
02:17:05,700 --> 02:17:07,700
and everyone we've seen so far turns up

3964
02:17:07,700 --> 02:17:09,700
to fight. Look, even Weapon Trumpet

3965
02:17:09,700 --> 02:17:11,700
is here. This absolutely incredible

3966
02:17:11,700 --> 02:17:13,700
shot was done by Dylan Gu. It's

3967
02:17:13,700 --> 02:17:15,700
my favorite shot in the show. Just

3968
02:17:15,700 --> 02:17:17,700
narrowly edging out the Zwei attack

3969
02:17:17,700 --> 02:17:19,700
and there's great setup and payoff to it because

3970
02:17:19,700 --> 02:17:21,700
we've known since volume one that characters

3971
02:17:21,700 --> 02:17:23,700
can call their lockers to them to get their

3972
02:17:23,700 --> 02:17:25,700
weapon out whenever they want it. So having them be

3973
02:17:25,700 --> 02:17:27,700
used as weapons and just smash into this

3974
02:17:27,700 --> 02:17:29,700
thing all at once, it's just so great.

3975
02:17:29,700 --> 02:17:31,700
So everyone's fighting monsters. There's some

3976
02:17:31,700 --> 02:17:33,700
great action. Ruby fights, uh,

3977
02:17:33,700 --> 02:17:35,700
check Malcolm McDowell's IMDb

3978
02:17:35,700 --> 02:17:37,700
for another comical name.

3979
02:17:37,700 --> 02:17:39,700
The real world is

3980
02:17:39,700 --> 02:17:41,700
cold! And he's kicking her and giving

3981
02:17:41,700 --> 02:17:43,700
a speech about the world being a cruel, cold

3982
02:17:43,700 --> 02:17:45,700
place. As for me,

3983
02:17:45,700 --> 02:17:47,700
I'll do what I do best.

3984
02:17:47,700 --> 02:17:49,700
Survive!

3985
02:17:49,700 --> 02:17:51,700
And he's fucking dead.

3986
02:17:51,700 --> 02:17:53,700
They just killed him! He's dead! I mean, holy

3987
02:17:53,700 --> 02:17:55,700
shit, right? They're destroying the main

3988
02:17:55,700 --> 02:17:57,700
setting of the story so far and

3989
02:17:57,700 --> 02:17:59,700
killing off villains in the process.

3990
02:17:59,700 --> 02:18:01,700
It's great! For a few short

3991
02:18:01,700 --> 02:18:03,700
episodes, the show isn't like Avatar

3992
02:18:03,700 --> 02:18:05,700
or anything else on its homework list.

3993
02:18:05,700 --> 02:18:07,700
You're briefly glimpsing what it looks like

3994
02:18:07,700 --> 02:18:09,700
when it's trying to be itself

3995
02:18:09,700 --> 02:18:11,700
when it's being Ruby.

3996
02:18:11,700 --> 02:18:13,700
You know this is why the rest of the show

3997
02:18:13,700 --> 02:18:15,700
is so frustrating, right? Because every now and

3998
02:18:15,700 --> 02:18:17,700
then something like this happens and you

3999
02:18:17,700 --> 02:18:19,700
wanna see the show this stuff came from.

4000
02:18:19,700 --> 02:18:21,700
Ruby opens Neo's umbrella and the wind

4001
02:18:21,700 --> 02:18:23,700
fucking blows her off the ship

4002
02:18:23,700 --> 02:18:25,700
they're flying on hundreds of feet in the air.

4003
02:18:25,700 --> 02:18:27,700
She's dead! She's fucking

4004
02:18:27,700 --> 02:18:29,700
dead! Until people start to get bored

4005
02:18:29,700 --> 02:18:31,700
with the show and realize that most of

4006
02:18:31,700 --> 02:18:33,700
the new characters are really boring. Maybe you

4007
02:18:33,700 --> 02:18:35,700
weren't supposed to assume the fall was gonna

4008
02:18:35,700 --> 02:18:37,700
kill her, but she doesn't appear for like

4009
02:18:37,700 --> 02:18:39,700
three more seasons after this.

4010
02:18:39,700 --> 02:18:41,700
So either the writers had intended to kill

4011
02:18:41,700 --> 02:18:43,700
her and then changed her minds because they wanted the character

4012
02:18:43,700 --> 02:18:45,700
back or they just forgot she existed for

4013
02:18:45,700 --> 02:18:47,700
literally fucking years.

4014
02:18:47,700 --> 02:18:49,700
Blake gets attacked and stabbed

4015
02:18:49,700 --> 02:18:51,700
by Adam and he shares his incredibly good

4016
02:18:51,700 --> 02:18:53,700
motivation for his actions. Uh,

4017
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:55,700
I'm bad and I'm going to kill you

4018
02:18:55,700 --> 02:18:57,700
and Yang tries to help but Adam cuts

4019
02:18:57,700 --> 02:18:59,700
her arm off. This moment is still so

4020
02:18:59,700 --> 02:19:01,700
dramatic and visually done so

4021
02:19:01,700 --> 02:19:03,700
well. They fake out for a second that

4022
02:19:03,700 --> 02:19:05,700
Blake's head gets cut off but actually

4023
02:19:05,700 --> 02:19:07,700
it was one of these illusions and she gets away

4024
02:19:07,700 --> 02:19:09,700
but what's amazing about this part of this show

4025
02:19:09,700 --> 02:19:11,700
is that for a second I believed

4026
02:19:11,700 --> 02:19:13,700
that they might, they just might

4027
02:19:13,700 --> 02:19:15,700
actually kill one of the four

4028
02:19:15,700 --> 02:19:17,700
main characters. Like, if that's not proof

4029
02:19:17,700 --> 02:19:19,700
that this show is onto something story-wise

4030
02:19:19,700 --> 02:19:21,700
for a hot minute, I don't know what is. Seeing

4031
02:19:21,700 --> 02:19:23,700
Pyrrha trying to do the right thing while

4032
02:19:23,700 --> 02:19:25,700
living with the fact she just accidentally

4033
02:19:25,700 --> 02:19:27,700
killed one of her friends and seeing that

4034
02:19:27,700 --> 02:19:29,700
affect her thinking is actually

4035
02:19:29,700 --> 02:19:31,700
incredible and from a character perspective

4036
02:19:31,700 --> 02:19:33,700
it's the best stuff you'll ever see in this show.

4037
02:19:33,700 --> 02:19:35,700
It would have been really helped if Pyrrha

4038
02:19:35,700 --> 02:19:37,700
and Penny had actually been friends

4039
02:19:37,700 --> 02:19:39,700
or like on screen together

4040
02:19:39,700 --> 02:19:41,700
basically at all before the fight

4041
02:19:41,700 --> 02:19:42,700
where Penny dies.

4042
02:19:42,700 --> 02:19:44,700
It's an honor to finally meet you.

4043
02:19:44,700 --> 02:19:46,700
Like, at this point it's actively offensive

4044
02:19:46,700 --> 02:19:48,700
like how poorly spent

4045
02:19:48,700 --> 02:19:50,700
the time leading up to this fight is

4046
02:19:50,700 --> 02:19:52,700
and just how much better it could have been.

4047
02:19:52,700 --> 02:19:54,700
If they'd, like, given these characters a relationship

4048
02:19:54,700 --> 02:19:56,700
before one of them killed the other

4049
02:19:56,700 --> 02:19:58,700
like wouldn't that have been meaningful?

4050
02:19:58,700 --> 02:20:00,700
Salutations, Pyrrha Nekos.

4051
02:20:00,700 --> 02:20:03,700
Do you remember when she said salutations?

4052
02:20:03,700 --> 02:20:04,700
Do you remember?

4053
02:20:04,700 --> 02:20:06,700
Pyrrha decides to let herself become

4054
02:20:06,700 --> 02:20:08,700
the vessel for the previous maiden but they're

4055
02:20:08,700 --> 02:20:10,700
too late and Cinder kills the maiden

4056
02:20:10,700 --> 02:20:12,700
and then Pyrrha shoves Miles into his locker

4057
02:20:12,700 --> 02:20:13,700
where he belonged.

4058
02:20:13,700 --> 02:20:14,700
I mean, Pyrrha sends Jaune away

4059
02:20:14,700 --> 02:20:16,700
against his will so he can survive

4060
02:20:16,700 --> 02:20:18,700
but not before fully confessing her feelings

4061
02:20:18,700 --> 02:20:20,700
and kissing him and tries to take Cinder on

4062
02:20:20,700 --> 02:20:22,700
but she fails and gets shot in the heart

4063
02:20:22,700 --> 02:20:23,700
by an arrow.

4064
02:20:23,700 --> 02:20:25,700
Ruby turns up just too late to save her

4065
02:20:25,700 --> 02:20:27,700
and watches as Cinder dissolves

4066
02:20:27,700 --> 02:20:29,700
Pyrrha's body into nothing.

4067
02:20:29,700 --> 02:20:31,700
Jesus fucking Christ!

4068
02:20:31,700 --> 02:20:33,700
They are not messing around pretending this is a show

4069
02:20:33,700 --> 02:20:34,700
for kids anymore, are they?

4070
02:20:34,700 --> 02:20:35,700
And then Ruby goes,

4071
02:20:35,700 --> 02:20:36,700
"[screams in pain"]

4072
02:20:36,700 --> 02:20:38,700
and turns out to have a magic power

4073
02:20:38,700 --> 02:20:40,700
because she has silver eyes and this means

4074
02:20:40,700 --> 02:20:42,700
she can instantly kill Grimm or something.

4075
02:20:42,700 --> 02:20:43,700
I don't know.

4076
02:20:43,700 --> 02:20:45,700
You learn about this power existing right now

4077
02:20:45,700 --> 02:20:46,700
seven hours into the show.

4078
02:20:46,700 --> 02:20:47,700
It's not great,

4079
02:20:47,700 --> 02:20:49,700
but we've already talked about how weird that is.

4080
02:20:49,700 --> 02:20:51,700
On the whole, the absolute chaos

4081
02:20:51,700 --> 02:20:53,700
and world-changing events and the treatment

4082
02:20:53,700 --> 02:20:55,700
of characters and emotionally interesting

4083
02:20:55,700 --> 02:20:57,700
story moves that take place in the last

4084
02:20:57,700 --> 02:20:59,700
four-and-a-bit episodes of volume three

4085
02:20:59,700 --> 02:21:02,700
make it briefly a great show, pure and simple,

4086
02:21:02,700 --> 02:21:04,700
and this is a weird place to end a video

4087
02:21:04,700 --> 02:21:06,700
about the problems with a show

4088
02:21:06,700 --> 02:21:08,700
by talking about how good it was for a while

4089
02:21:08,700 --> 02:21:10,700
and how promisingly it left its doors open,

4090
02:21:10,700 --> 02:21:13,700
but this is really why talking about Ruby

4091
02:21:13,700 --> 02:21:15,700
is so artistically interesting because it's always

4092
02:21:15,700 --> 02:21:17,700
on the cusp of being good like this,

4093
02:21:17,700 --> 02:21:19,700
and sometimes it really is,

4094
02:21:19,700 --> 02:21:22,700
but that's also why the show is such a disappointment.

4095
02:21:22,700 --> 02:21:24,700
That part of season three damns

4096
02:21:24,700 --> 02:21:26,700
the rest of the surrounding show even more

4097
02:21:26,700 --> 02:21:28,700
by telling you to have expectations

4098
02:21:28,700 --> 02:21:30,700
because for a second,

4099
02:21:30,700 --> 02:21:32,700
you can see how good it really could be.

4100
02:21:32,700 --> 02:21:34,700
The show hasn't got good exactly.

4101
02:21:34,700 --> 02:21:36,700
It's just had a really good time

4102
02:21:36,700 --> 02:21:39,700
making serious changes to the status quo of the story,

4103
02:21:39,700 --> 02:21:42,700
but you can't sustain a story on Red Weddings alone.

4104
02:21:42,700 --> 02:21:45,700
The new story beginning with volume four onwards

4105
02:21:45,700 --> 02:21:48,700
has to actually be good for this to all work out,

4106
02:21:48,700 --> 02:21:51,700
and ultimately, it doesn't.

4107
02:21:51,700 --> 02:21:53,700
To really explore the more specific problems

4108
02:21:53,700 --> 02:21:56,700
with volumes four onwards, we'd need a whole other video.

4109
02:21:56,700 --> 02:21:58,700
I wanted to talk in specific about the first three seasons

4110
02:21:58,700 --> 02:22:01,700
because they stand out as the time the show seemed

4111
02:22:01,700 --> 02:22:03,700
most likely to be going somewhere

4112
02:22:03,700 --> 02:22:05,700
and therefore feel particularly bad

4113
02:22:05,700 --> 02:22:07,700
when they only do it for such brief bursts

4114
02:22:07,700 --> 02:22:10,700
in Monty's fights, in the promising storylines

4115
02:22:10,700 --> 02:22:12,700
or character moments that get forgotten or dropped,

4116
02:22:12,700 --> 02:22:14,700
and in the way they really satisfyingly

4117
02:22:14,700 --> 02:22:16,700
did things with Pyrrha's character,

4118
02:22:16,700 --> 02:22:18,700
but now that character is gone,

4119
02:22:18,700 --> 02:22:20,700
so the show's back to having dozens of characters

4120
02:22:20,700 --> 02:22:24,700
with barely one interesting personality between them.

4121
02:22:24,700 --> 02:22:27,700
The good parts of the show really can be great,

4122
02:22:27,700 --> 02:22:29,700
and because of this, all the bad parts

4123
02:22:29,700 --> 02:22:31,700
are worse than bad.

4124
02:22:31,700 --> 02:22:34,700
They're also a shame.

4126

Creating art is like jumping off a cliff

4127
02:22:44,700 --> 02:22:46,700
and building your wings on the way down.

4128
02:22:46,700 --> 02:22:48,700
If you want to only start when you know

4129
02:22:48,700 --> 02:22:50,700
exactly how to get everything right,

4130
02:22:50,700 --> 02:22:52,700
you never actually will.

4131
02:22:52,700 --> 02:22:54,700
You never really know what you're doing

4132
02:22:54,700 --> 02:22:56,700
until after you've started doing it.

4133
02:22:56,700 --> 02:22:59,700
In the past couple of years of this weird life,

4134
02:22:59,700 --> 02:23:01,700
I've met quite a few people who knew Monty,

4135
02:23:01,700 --> 02:23:04,700
and several of them have told me the same story.

4136
02:23:04,700 --> 02:23:06,700
He'd say that he felt like the first season,

4137
02:23:06,700 --> 02:23:08,700
first season and a half, first two seasons,

4138
02:23:08,700 --> 02:23:10,700
based on who was telling it,

4139
02:23:10,700 --> 02:23:12,700
weren't turning out super great so far,

4140
02:23:12,700 --> 02:23:14,700
but it didn't matter if it was bad right now

4141
02:23:14,700 --> 02:23:16,700
because in his mind, the whole thing,

4142
02:23:16,700 --> 02:23:18,700
the act of creation itself even,

4143
02:23:18,700 --> 02:23:20,700
was a process of learning.

4144
02:23:20,700 --> 02:23:23,700
If you can really figure out how to make something,

4145
02:23:23,700 --> 02:23:25,700
really get the production and workflow down,

4146
02:23:25,700 --> 02:23:27,700
figure out what works in the writing,

4147
02:23:27,700 --> 02:23:29,700
and through this process find the core

4148
02:23:29,700 --> 02:23:31,700
of what this thing you're making is really supposed to be,

4149
02:23:31,700 --> 02:23:33,700
it won't matter how bad it started out

4150
02:23:33,700 --> 02:23:35,700
because where it went will be great.

4151
02:23:35,700 --> 02:23:37,700
There's a certain manic energy,

4152
02:23:37,700 --> 02:23:40,700
a compelling power in these early seasons of RWBY.

4153
02:23:40,700 --> 02:23:42,700
Even if you're having a bad time,

4154

how it ends up.

4156
02:23:45,700 --> 02:23:47,700
This tone will change.

4157
02:23:47,700 --> 02:23:49,700
As the show continues to be written and paced

4158
02:23:49,700 --> 02:23:51,700
in frustrating ways and cheat off the answers

4159
02:23:51,700 --> 02:23:54,700
on its anime homework and its most interesting,

4160
02:23:54,700 --> 02:23:57,700
unique aspects are continuously downplayed or ignored,

4161
02:23:57,700 --> 02:23:59,700
it becomes more and more clear

4162
02:23:59,700 --> 02:24:01,700
that you'll never see the show become itself.

4163
02:24:01,700 --> 02:24:03,700
I didn't watch Monty Oum's RWBY

4164
02:24:03,700 --> 02:24:05,700
to see Miles Luna's avatar,

4165
02:24:05,700 --> 02:24:07,700
but that's what people are getting.

4166
02:24:07,700 --> 02:24:09,700
If the creators of RWBY had started learning

4167
02:24:09,700 --> 02:24:11,700
from their mistakes and taken to heart

4168
02:24:11,700 --> 02:24:13,700
the good faith criticisms the people

4169
02:24:13,700 --> 02:24:16,700
who wanted to love their show were making,

4170
02:24:16,700 --> 02:24:18,700
RWBY could have really been something,

4171
02:24:18,700 --> 02:24:21,700
but instead it'll be remembered by a majority of people

4172
02:24:21,700 --> 02:24:23,700
as a series of really good trailers

4173
02:24:23,700 --> 02:24:25,700
with some really strange dialogue,

4174
02:24:25,700 --> 02:24:27,700
some really cool fight scenes to watch

4175
02:24:27,700 --> 02:24:29,700
out of context on YouTube,

4176
02:24:29,700 --> 02:24:31,700
and inexplicably quite good episodes

4177
02:24:31,700 --> 02:24:33,700
at the end of the third season.

4178
02:24:33,700 --> 02:24:36,700
The real shame of RWBY is everyone whose work goes unsung

4179
02:24:36,700 --> 02:24:38,700
because it's in a show that sucks.

4180
02:24:38,700 --> 02:24:40,700
People like Shane Neuville who left the show

4181
02:24:40,700 --> 02:24:42,700
and released a massive open letter

4182
02:24:42,700 --> 02:24:44,700
detailing his feelings about the company's treatment

4183
02:24:44,700 --> 02:24:46,700
of the show after Monty's passing,

4184
02:24:46,700 --> 02:24:48,700
or Harley Dwartz who contributes a lot

4185
02:24:48,700 --> 02:24:50,700
to making some of the best parts of the show,

4186
02:24:50,700 --> 02:24:52,700
or the many other animators and artists

4187
02:24:52,700 --> 02:24:54,700
who are still to this day putting time

4188
02:24:54,700 --> 02:24:56,700
and effort and attention into things

4189
02:24:56,700 --> 02:24:58,700
that get ignored or thrown away

4190
02:24:58,700 --> 02:25:00,700
or just executed terribly

4191
02:25:00,700 --> 02:25:02,700
because the storytelling isn't there.

4192
02:25:02,700 --> 02:25:04,700
It's clear that a lot of really skilled artists

4193
02:25:04,700 --> 02:25:07,700
and animators work on RWBY to this day,

4194
02:25:07,700 --> 02:25:09,700
but the mishandling of the show's story

4195
02:25:09,700 --> 02:25:11,700
and production means that it fails

4196
02:25:11,700 --> 02:25:13,700
to reflect their talents, and that is probably

4197
02:25:13,700 --> 02:25:15,700
the worst thing a show can do.

4198
02:25:15,700 --> 02:25:18,700
It's important to talk about this show

4199
02:25:18,700 --> 02:25:20,700
and where it went wrong because while this is

4200
02:25:20,700 --> 02:25:22,700
the first attempt to make an animated web series

4201
02:25:22,700 --> 02:25:24,700
of basically anything like this scale,

4202
02:25:24,700 --> 02:25:26,700
it won't necessarily be the last,

4203
02:25:26,700 --> 02:25:28,700
and that means we have to learn all the lessons

4204
02:25:28,700 --> 02:25:30,700
we can from its production problems

4205
02:25:30,700 --> 02:25:33,700
and failures or we'll see them get repeated again.

4206
02:25:33,700 --> 02:25:35,700
I want there to be a show one day

4207
02:25:35,700 --> 02:25:37,700
that represents what RWBY could have been,

4208
02:25:37,700 --> 02:25:39,700
and that means recognizing the show's potential

4209
02:25:39,700 --> 02:25:41,700
and where it went wrong.

4210
02:25:41,700 --> 02:25:43,700
RWBY will probably never be the show

4211
02:25:43,700 --> 02:25:45,700
it promised to be, but with the gift

4212
02:25:45,700 --> 02:25:47,700
