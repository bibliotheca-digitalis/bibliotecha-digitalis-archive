0	6800	So, in the Hercules video, I talked a lot about the three-act structure that is really common in Hollywood screenplays,
6800	11300	and someone in the comments linked to an article by Film Crit Hulk from 2013,
11300	15300	wherein Hulk argues against what he calls the myth of the three-act structure.
15300	18300	Now, Hulk has written some great film journalism over the years,
18300	22600	but on this, well, I pretty much disagree with most of his assertions,
22600	27600	and I think this stems from a disagreement on what an act even is and what purpose it serves in a narrative.
27600	32900	There is a misconception that an act in a screenplay pertains to where any given scene falls in the narrative.
32900	38100	Hulk even points this out, that most people, when asked, think it's an issue of placement rather than function.
38100	41600	Hulk contends that his fellow journalists, film students, writers, etc.,
41600	47200	can't actually define an act except for where it falls in the story, and that the idea of three acts is actually meaningless.
47200	51700	Now, applying a structure to a narrative is a form of theory, and people get confused by this all the time,
51700	54400	what we mean by theory, so in this context, it's this.
54500	60900	It's not a scientific theory, like theory of evolution, or like a colloquial theory, as in, like, a hypothesis,
60900	65700	but analytical theory is a form of academia that aims to frame a work, an artist, or a movement
65700	71200	in terms of history, meaning, interpretation, sociology, psychology, etc.
71200	77100	Film theory is distinct from, say, film criticism and film history, although there is some overlap.
77100	84100	For instance, applying feminist film theory or psychoanalytical film theory to, say, Hitchcock's North by Northwest,
84100	91600	vagina, will net you a different reading than if you were to apply auteur theory to the same, though not completely different.
91600	97000	Theory is taking a guideline of thought based on a comparable precedent to an already existing body of work.
97000	99800	So when we talk about theory as it applies to the three-act structure,
99800	103400	I do agree that it's not terribly useful for writers to start their own work,
103400	108600	be it a short story, a novel, a screenplay, or a web video, feeling the need to hit the points of a three-act structure.
108600	111700	When you're outlining something, it's best not to think about that sort of thing,
111700	116100	but when you come out the other side, you will probably find that you've unconsciously created a three-act structure
116100	120400	just by the nature of the way story structure has evolved throughout the history of Western civilization.
120400	124500	You have probably learned how to write a three-act structure simply by osmosis.
124500	130300	However, if you go online and look at forums where people try to find examples of movies that don't adhere to three-act structure,
130300	131900	most of their examples will.
131900	138100	I see movies like No Country for Old Men, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Pulp Fiction as counterexamples.
138100	144400	The three-act structure is there in all of these movies, but it's hidden in storytelling that is less conventional than, say, Independence Day,
144400	148700	which has its three acts so carefully outlined that they are divided by date.
148700	153800	I was originally going to use Transformers Revenge of the Fallen as a counterexample, but nope.
153800	156900	All of these act points are there, even the twist in the third act,
156900	162200	but these points are so buried in plot clutter that it feels a lot more muddied and random than it actually is.
162300	166100	Hulk's main contention is that dividing stories into three parts is arbitrary
166100	170600	because a movie can have any number of breaks and therefore acts that create propulsion.
170600	175800	He cites the Shakespearean five-act structure as superior and uses 2008's Iron Man as an example,
175800	179900	which I find particularly odd as Iron Man uses a very rigid three-act structure.
179900	185600	The conventional wisdom contends Hulk is that an act marks the point where a character can't go back,
185600	188700	and I don't think that's an accurate or helpful assessment.
188700	193500	But story structure is not a myth, it is theory and can be interpreted in a variety of different ways
193500	195800	depending on what framework you're using.
195800	199500	You can argue that any narrative has three acts or five or nine,
199500	205600	but it is useful to keep in mind that while most feature-length movies will adhere to a fairly easy-to-recognize three-act structure,
205600	206800	not all do.
206800	212300	Psycho is a good, more well-known example of a Hollywood movie that doesn't use the classic three-act structure.
212300	216000	Hulk cites Malcolm X as an example, and on that I would have to agree,
216000	221600	but the simple three-act structure tends to be most popular because it lends itself well to a 90-minute-to-two-hour screenplay,
221600	225500	given the length of sequences that tend to be satisfying to a mainstream audience.
225500	228000	So I've provided a link to the article in question below,
228000	233500	and also the de-Hulkifier bookmarklet if you have a hard time reading Film Crit Hulk's all-caps mode of writing.
233500	238100	And again, being broken up into three acts doesn't mean acts need to adhere to any particular length.
238100	242700	Movies like The Lion King, The Hunger Games, and Spider-Man all have really long first acts,
242700	245600	and their midpoints are generally 60% to 70% through the movie.
245600	248300	Act breaks aren't a question of length, but function.
248300	253400	For another source, Todd Vanderwerf of Vox.com wrote a more recent article about the decay of the second act
253400	259500	we've seen in more recent Hollywood fare, like Independence Day Resurgence and Fan-for-stick.
259500	261200	That article is also linked below.
261200	265500	I don't think it's a question of which structure is superior, five acts versus three,
265500	268700	but which structure is most effective for the story it's trying to tell.
268700	272800	Formula can be used to great end or to not-so-great end.
272800	275900	So, needless to say, not all narratives adhere to this structure,
275900	279300	but the vast majority of Hollywood films and even smaller indie films do.
279300	283000	And obviously, the examples I've chosen have all pretty clear three-act structures,
283000	285800	because this is a video about three-act structures.
285800	288100	And also, spoilers for the following films.
288100	291100	So in this context, the operative word here is tension.
291100	295100	Individual acts and sequences have tension, and the narrative as a whole has tension.
295100	298700	The beginning and end of acts marks the changes or shift in the tension.
298700	301500	A typical screenplay features eight sequences.
301500	305200	Two in Act 1, four in Act 2, two in Act 3.
305200	308900	Sequences are defined by a build and release of minor tensions,
308900	310900	all while contributing to the main tension.
310900	314600	There are main act tensions, and there are individual sequence tensions.
314600	317600	An example of a sequence tension would be,
317600	321100	will Tony be able to build a suit that works?
321100	323000	Two...
323000	324700	One.
324700	327800	That tension is relieved when he successfully tests it.
327800	329500	The following sequence tension is,
329500	333000	is Tony's new suit capable of doing what he wants it to do?
333000	335000	The tension is relieved at the end of the sequence,
335000	338600	but also builds to the main tension of the bigger bad wanting to take him down.
338600	342600	There must be more than this provincial life!
342600	345500	A backstory establishes the status quo for the protagonist,
345500	347300	and sets the rules of the universe.
347300	351100	This usually happens at the very beginning of Act 1, but can be weaved throughout.
351100	353000	Sequence 1 usually explains the universe,
353000	355600	and will also usually give us some sort of flaw or desire
355600	358100	that's leaving the protagonist feeling incomplete.
358100	359500	Die!
359500	360900	You do not die!
360900	362800	Luke wants to go to flight academy.
362800	366000	Eddie is an alcoholic racist who hasn't mourned the loss of his brother.
366000	369300	Shia LaBeouf is a sh**ty human being.
369300	371700	Your point of attack is the thing that gets the ball rolling.
371700	374000	This probably has nothing to do with the protagonist,
374000	376200	and instead focuses on the universe.
376200	378900	This creates a story element for your protagonist to react to,
378900	381100	and that reaction becomes the inciting incident.
381100	384500	And yes, I did get the point of attack and inciting incident reversed in the Hercules video.
384500	387400	That's my bad. It's been a long time since I've taken this class. Shut up.
387400	391600	Your point of attack will probably be outside of the protagonist's control or even knowledge,
391600	394900	and the inciting incident is where the conflict comes home to roost for our protagonist,
394900	397400	meaning our protagonist needs to do something.
397400	399900	It can also be something that will eventually lead the main character
399900	402000	to making an important decision at the end of Act 1.
402000	405800	That inciting incident marks the end of the first sequence of the first act.
405800	411100	That first sequence tension is resolved by however the protagonist reacts to that inciting incident.
411100	413700	Be it finding a bag of money in the desert,
413700	415600	or volunteering as tribute.
415600	417400	I volunteer as tribute!
417400	420100	Realizing the satellite signal is a countdown,
420100	423300	or finding out that Roger Rabbit allegedly killed a guy.
423300	425600	Marvin Acme.
425600	427600	The rabbit cacked him last night.
427600	430700	In a film with a more passive protagonist, like Mad Max Fury Road,
430700	434000	the inciting incident is where Furiosa decides to go off-roading.
434000	435700	And yes, we all know it's Furiosa's story,
435700	438600	but Max is the point-of-view character and his growth defines the structure of the story,
438600	440400	and therefore he is the protagonist.
440400	443100	The inciting incident will also set up the central conflict,
443100	445000	which is displayed through character motivation.
445000	448500	That central conflict can be the desire to win over the princess,
448500	450700	the desire to win over the princess,
450700	452700	or the desire to win over the...
452700	453800	robo...
453800	455000	princess...
455000	456800	See, this one's compelling and easy to resolve,
456800	459400	which is why romance is such a common narrative device.
459400	462700	In super utmost simplest terms, the want will drive the main tension,
462700	464900	which is resolved at the end of the second act.
464900	468100	I'm here to erase Clementine Krasinski.
468100	470600	Max wants to survive and be alone.
470600	473600	Tony wants to take control of the weapons he's sold.
473600	476800	Eddie Valiant wants to find out who's made a patsy out of him.
476800	479600	Somebody's made a patsy out of me, and I'm gonna find a wife!
479600	482900	And the protagonist's need, which defines the character growth,
482900	484700	will resolve the tension of the third act.
484700	486800	Again, these are rules that don't apply to all films,
486800	491200	and you're more likely to see them in really conventional, easy-to-digest narratives like Disney movies.
491200	494900	The want is the protagonist's internal motivation and pushes the narrative forward.
494900	496900	There's this girl.
496900	500200	Even in ensemble pieces, where everyone gets their own subplot and character arc,
500200	504600	the momentum of the plot is generally going to be pushed by one character's central conflict.
504600	507800	In X-Men 2, for instance, it's Wolverine's search for his past,
507800	510900	which culminates in him turning his back on the one guy with the key to it.
510900	516600	So, the incident being incited, the second sequence of the first act builds to the creation of the main tension,
516600	520300	culminating with a lock-in, or the hero deciding to go on their quest.
520300	521500	You have my word.
521500	523200	Done!
523200	528100	The quest can be small and interpersonal, like deciding to go to France to get your cheating fiance back,
528100	530900	or to erase all memory of your ex-girlfriend,
530900	534400	or more epic, like volunteering to take the ring to Mordor,
534400	537100	or deciding to go with Obi-Wan to learn the ways of the Jedi,
537100	540300	or deciding to help Furiosa and the wives escape Immortan Joe.
540300	545300	It can also mean that your basic human decency means you are now stuck in a deadly game of cat and mouse.
545300	548300	The end of Act 1 establishes what's called the main tension.
548300	550700	We're going to the green place of many mothers.
550700	552800	Will Luke and Obi-Wan find Princess Leia?
552800	554800	Will Luella now smart Chigurh?
554800	557700	Will Jango succeed in rescuing his wife from Kandi?
557700	560400	Sequence 3 marks the first sequence of Act 2.
560400	562700	Usually, this will show the quest making some ground,
562700	566500	and culminate with our heroes achieving some milestone, or learning something.
566500	568500	Hercules competes his training.
568500	570700	Simba decides Hakuna Matata.
570700	573300	Tony begins to develop a new Iron Man suit.
573300	575400	Sequence 4 sees the build-up to the midpoint,
575400	580700	which most commonly shows us the protagonist working towards the first serious attempt to achieve their goal.
580700	582300	I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!
582300	585500	Megamind trains his replacement rival for their first battle.
585500	587900	Hercules goes looking for a fight to prove himself.
587900	589900	Simba begins to revisit his past.
594100	596200	Sequence 4 culminates with the midpoint.
596200	598900	Usually, this will change the aim of the hero's quest.
598900	601300	The midpoint marks some sort of disruption.
601300	603900	The protagonist runs into his childhood lion best friend,
603900	607100	disrupting his idyllic life and making him question his decisions.
607100	609100	Maybe our protagonist's little friend died,
609100	611300	showing them that they're not only fighting for themselves,
611300	613500	and also gaining them sympathy in the eyes of the masses.
613500	616800	Or maybe getting dumped makes them revert to their old, evil ways.
616800	619900	Joel realizes he doesn't want to have his memory of Clementine erased,
619900	621800	and begins trying to stop the process.
621800	625900	Can you hear me? I don't want this anymore! I want to call it off!
625900	628200	The main tension of the second act hasn't been resolved,
628200	630100	but something about it has changed.
630100	632300	The midpoint ups the tension for the final match
632300	635700	by shifting the focus of the main tension while not yet resolving it.
635700	638600	The fifth sequence following the midpoint will build on this change.
638600	641700	The challenge here is generally to keep from second act sag.
641700	644100	When someone says that there are problems in the second act,
644100	645500	that's probably what they mean.
645500	649000	The shift in focus from the midpoint doesn't follow through in a satisfactory manner,
649000	652800	where there's filler in the middle that lengthens the runtime or adds action scenes,
652800	655400	but doesn't really add any momentum or tension.
655400	659800	The fifth sequence will also usually focus on some subplot or secondary character backstory,
659800	663700	so as not to make the story too monolithic, and also to ease some tension.
663700	666000	Meg realizes she's falling in love with Hercules.
666000	670200	The war boy, who was our hero's enemy, now joins the side of the righteous.
670200	673300	The receptionist, while outwardly dating Mark Ruffalo,
673300	675900	begins to show an unusual interest in her boss.
675900	677200	Subplots are important.
677200	679500	They keep the story from feeling too episodic,
679500	682600	like one guy just encountering a series of obstacles,
682600	686400	and other characters can help resolve loose threads and expand on more universal themes.
686400	689300	The sixth sequence is the last sequence of the second act.
689300	693300	The end of act two shows us the main culmination, or the resolution of the main tension.
693300	697400	The end of act two will generally have the protagonist encounter their biggest challenge yet,
697400	701400	which is why the end of act two typically is when we see our hero at their lowest point.
701400	705800	Our hero's a zero! Our hero's a zero!
705800	709400	And is generally the preamble to some momentous decision that defines character growth,
709400	711400	and creates the new tension in act three.
711400	715200	We have set out to find the Green Place, only to find out it no longer exists.
715200	718400	Joel's memories of Clementine have now been all erased.
718400	721500	Jafar just golfed me into the Himalayas or something,
721500	723400	and now everything seems hopeless.
723400	727100	If it's a whodunit, generally this is where you will find out whodunit.
727100	730900	That's the gun that killed R.K. Maroon, and Doom pulled the trigger.
730900	733600	And act three will be about bringing whodunit to justice.
733600	738100	Also, if there is a big betrayal, or the plot is built on some character deceiving another,
738100	739400	that generally goes here.
739400	743200	Being your little chickie-poo here was working for me all the time.
743200	746200	Llewellyn dies at the end of act two of No Country for Old Men,
746200	749300	and act three is a much more thematic build and release of tension,
749300	752000	rather than being action-driven as the first two acts had been,
752000	754600	with the conclusion of the film being much more existential.
754600	759300	It is still very much three acts, as demonstrated by the build and release of different tensions.
759300	761600	Sequence seven marks the beginning of act three,
761600	766000	and begins with the protagonist making some momentous decision that creates act three's tension.
766000	768300	I suggest we go back the same way we came.
768300	772600	Act three's tension will be related to the main tension, but is now different.
772600	777400	The tension is no longer escape with Jango's wife, it's destroy Candyland completely.
777400	781600	It is no longer will Katniss save herself, but will Katniss and Peeta save each other.
781600	786600	It is no longer escape to the Green Place, but overthrow the existing power structure completely.
786600	790300	It is important to note that the third act tension can't come completely out of nowhere.
790300	792700	It can't simply be an extension of the main tension,
792700	795900	but must also build on it in order to be satisfying to the audience.
796600	798500	Holy smoke, he's a dude!
798500	801600	The twist in the third act is important because it makes the tension more interesting
801600	804100	than just straight fighting for 45 minutes.
804100	808200	Although just straight fighting for 45 minutes has become increasingly popular.
808200	811700	The twist in the third act also generally brings the focus of the third act tension
811700	814000	from something more grand, like saving the world,
814000	818600	to something more intimate and character-oriented, like saving a beloved character's life.
818600	820200	Furiosa gets stabbed.
820200	823700	This shifts the focus from overthrowing the Citadel to saving her life.
823700	825000	Wally gets squished.
825000	828800	This shifts the focus from bringing the humans home to saving Wally's life.
828800	830400	Same for Meg getting squished.
830400	835400	Or the MacGuffin being given to the physically weaker, but more central protagonist to go do the thing.
835400	838600	The twist in the third act isn't also necessarily a twist,
838600	842900	as Merelda's fake death in Hunchback of Notre Dame brings the conflict to a more intimate place,
842900	846700	but it doesn't really change anything, because she was always Quasimodo's focus.
846700	850400	But it is something that narrows or shifts the focus of the third act's main tension.
850400	851700	Stop!
851700	854600	The climax shows us the resolution to the final tension.
854600	857000	Eve races to save Wally and succeeds.
857000	860200	The magic spell is broken, Beast turns human, and Belle's like,
860200	861800	eh, you'll do.
861800	864300	Max gives his blood to save Furiosa's life,
864300	866900	symbolized by him finally telling her his name.
866900	869400	Max.
869400	870700	My name is Max.
870700	874100	In a romance, the couple finally gets together, and love conquers all,
874100	876900	though this does not necessarily preclude someone dying.
876900	879800	The climax usually pertains to some form of character growth,
879800	883600	such as Luke learning to trust his feelings, allowing him to destroy the Death Star,
883600	887200	or Megamind's goodness being defined by finally learning from his mistakes,
887200	888500	which he never did as a villain.
888500	890700	There's a benefit to losing.
890700	892400	You get to learn from your mistakes.
892500	896300	And the character growth we see in the third act was probably addressed in the first sequence.
896300	897300	The tomb runs.
897300	901500	Eddie has come to terms with his brother's death and no longer blames all of Toondam for it.
901500	905400	Aladdin realizes that pretending to be something he's not won't win him love.
905400	910200	Joel accepts that our memories, even painful ones, make us who we are and must be lived with.
910200	912900	Shia LaBeouf, well, he's still a s**t,
912900	916600	but now he's a s**t that stuck a cube in Megatron's chest, I guess.
916600	919300	But this resolution doesn't always have to be so conventional.
919300	922800	For instance, with Nightcrawler, where the growth is that he doesn't grow,
922800	924600	and that's what makes the narrative unsettling.
924600	928400	Hopefully, you don't notice structure elements while you're watching a movie for the first time,
928400	930900	unless you're bored and that's all you can focus on.
930900	932100	And I've definitely done that.
932100	935600	But they are there for us to learn from and to help us learn how tension and conflict
935600	938700	is created and maintained throughout a two-hour-ish narrative.
938700	941900	We don't study the three-act structure to learn how to be more creative,
941900	945600	but to be more critical of writing and aware of what drives momentum of a story.
945600	950300	Hulk asserts that learning about act structure is not instructing you how to actually write.
950300	953900	It provides none of the good stuff that is critical to understanding narrative.
953900	955400	And I would agree with the first part,
955400	958700	but not the assessment that it provides no basis for understanding narrative.
958700	961200	I don't think the study of story helps with the creative process
961200	965300	so much as it helps us to understand why what we've already created works.
965300	968700	But structure and tension also does not exist independent from character.
968700	969600	Far from it.
969600	972500	You need character motivation in order for narrative to have tension,
972500	975300	and you need to have plot stuff in order to have character motivation.
975400	979100	As a writer, if you think only in terms of ticking boxes for the sake of structure,
979100	981900	yeah, it's probably not going to be a very great story.
981900	984500	That, I think, is one of the biggest problems with Hercules.
984500	989400	But it can help us to understand where and how tension and conflict exist and can be bettered.
989400	994200	I also don't think of the three-act structure as necessarily something to advocate or not advocate,
994200	997000	but simply the most common and commercial style of narrative,
997000	998700	and therefore a good place to start learning.
998700	1002400	I don't think it's mandatory for all film narratives to have a three-act structure,
1002400	1006900	but I do think it helps to understand how it works before one decides to expand upon that structure.
1006900	1010400	It is, after all, the most common and utilized for a reason.
1010400	1011400	Thank you for watching.
1011400	1017700	If you have any examples or discussions about movies that do or do not necessarily adhere to the three-act structure,
1017700	1019600	go ahead and leave them in the comments below.
1019600	1021900	Thanks for watching, and I will see you next time.
