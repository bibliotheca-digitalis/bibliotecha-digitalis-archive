00:00.000 --> 00:06.800
So, in the Hercules video, I talked a lot about the three-act structure that is really common in Hollywood screenplays,

00:06.800 --> 00:11.300
and someone in the comments linked to an article by Film Crit Hulk from 2013,

00:11.300 --> 00:15.300
wherein Hulk argues against what he calls the myth of the three-act structure.

00:15.300 --> 00:18.300
Now, Hulk has written some great film journalism over the years,

00:18.300 --> 00:22.600
but on this, well, I pretty much disagree with most of his assertions,

00:22.600 --> 00:27.600
and I think this stems from a disagreement on what an act even is and what purpose it serves in a narrative.

00:27.600 --> 00:32.900
There is a misconception that an act in a screenplay pertains to where any given scene falls in the narrative.

00:32.900 --> 00:38.100
Hulk even points this out, that most people, when asked, think it's an issue of placement rather than function.

00:38.100 --> 00:41.600
Hulk contends that his fellow journalists, film students, writers, etc.,

00:41.600 --> 00:47.200
can't actually define an act except for where it falls in the story, and that the idea of three acts is actually meaningless.

00:47.200 --> 00:51.700
Now, applying a structure to a narrative is a form of theory, and people get confused by this all the time,

00:51.700 --> 00:54.400
what we mean by theory, so in this context, it's this.

00:54.500 --> 01:00.900
It's not a scientific theory, like theory of evolution, or like a colloquial theory, as in, like, a hypothesis,

01:00.900 --> 01:05.700
but analytical theory is a form of academia that aims to frame a work, an artist, or a movement

01:05.700 --> 01:11.200
in terms of history, meaning, interpretation, sociology, psychology, etc.

01:11.200 --> 01:17.100
Film theory is distinct from, say, film criticism and film history, although there is some overlap.

01:17.100 --> 01:24.100
For instance, applying feminist film theory or psychoanalytical film theory to, say, Hitchcock's North by Northwest,

01:24.100 --> 01:31.600
vagina, will net you a different reading than if you were to apply auteur theory to the same, though not completely different.

01:31.600 --> 01:37.000
Theory is taking a guideline of thought based on a comparable precedent to an already existing body of work.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.800
So when we talk about theory as it applies to the three-act structure,

01:39.800 --> 01:43.400
I do agree that it's not terribly useful for writers to start their own work,

01:43.400 --> 01:48.600
be it a short story, a novel, a screenplay, or a web video, feeling the need to hit the points of a three-act structure.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.700
When you're outlining something, it's best not to think about that sort of thing,

01:51.700 --> 01:56.100
but when you come out the other side, you will probably find that you've unconsciously created a three-act structure

01:56.100 --> 02:00.400
just by the nature of the way story structure has evolved throughout the history of Western civilization.

02:00.400 --> 02:04.500
You have probably learned how to write a three-act structure simply by osmosis.

02:04.500 --> 02:10.300
However, if you go online and look at forums where people try to find examples of movies that don't adhere to three-act structure,

02:10.300 --> 02:11.900
most of their examples will.

02:11.900 --> 02:18.100
I see movies like No Country for Old Men, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Pulp Fiction as counterexamples.

02:18.100 --> 02:24.400
The three-act structure is there in all of these movies, but it's hidden in storytelling that is less conventional than, say, Independence Day,

02:24.400 --> 02:28.700
which has its three acts so carefully outlined that they are divided by date.

02:28.700 --> 02:33.800
I was originally going to use Transformers Revenge of the Fallen as a counterexample, but nope.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.900
All of these act points are there, even the twist in the third act,

02:36.900 --> 02:42.200
but these points are so buried in plot clutter that it feels a lot more muddied and random than it actually is.

02:42.300 --> 02:46.100
Hulk's main contention is that dividing stories into three parts is arbitrary

02:46.100 --> 02:50.600
because a movie can have any number of breaks and therefore acts that create propulsion.

02:50.600 --> 02:55.800
He cites the Shakespearean five-act structure as superior and uses 2008's Iron Man as an example,

02:55.800 --> 02:59.900
which I find particularly odd as Iron Man uses a very rigid three-act structure.

02:59.900 --> 03:05.600
The conventional wisdom contends Hulk is that an act marks the point where a character can't go back,

03:05.600 --> 03:08.700
and I don't think that's an accurate or helpful assessment.

03:08.700 --> 03:13.500
But story structure is not a myth, it is theory and can be interpreted in a variety of different ways

03:13.500 --> 03:15.800
depending on what framework you're using.

03:15.800 --> 03:19.500
You can argue that any narrative has three acts or five or nine,

03:19.500 --> 03:25.600
but it is useful to keep in mind that while most feature-length movies will adhere to a fairly easy-to-recognize three-act structure,

03:25.600 --> 03:26.800
not all do.

03:26.800 --> 03:32.300
Psycho is a good, more well-known example of a Hollywood movie that doesn't use the classic three-act structure.

03:32.300 --> 03:36.000
Hulk cites Malcolm X as an example, and on that I would have to agree,

03:36.000 --> 03:41.600
but the simple three-act structure tends to be most popular because it lends itself well to a 90-minute-to-two-hour screenplay,

03:41.600 --> 03:45.500
given the length of sequences that tend to be satisfying to a mainstream audience.

03:45.500 --> 03:48.000
So I've provided a link to the article in question below,

03:48.000 --> 03:53.500
and also the de-Hulkifier bookmarklet if you have a hard time reading Film Crit Hulk's all-caps mode of writing.

03:53.500 --> 03:58.100
And again, being broken up into three acts doesn't mean acts need to adhere to any particular length.

03:58.100 --> 04:02.700
Movies like The Lion King, The Hunger Games, and Spider-Man all have really long first acts,

04:02.700 --> 04:05.600
and their midpoints are generally 60% to 70% through the movie.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.300
Act breaks aren't a question of length, but function.

04:08.300 --> 04:13.400
For another source, Todd Vanderwerf of Vox.com wrote a more recent article about the decay of the second act

04:13.400 --> 04:19.500
we've seen in more recent Hollywood fare, like Independence Day Resurgence and Fan-for-stick.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.200
That article is also linked below.

04:21.200 --> 04:25.500
I don't think it's a question of which structure is superior, five acts versus three,

04:25.500 --> 04:28.700
but which structure is most effective for the story it's trying to tell.

04:28.700 --> 04:32.800
Formula can be used to great end or to not-so-great end.

04:32.800 --> 04:35.900
So, needless to say, not all narratives adhere to this structure,

04:35.900 --> 04:39.300
but the vast majority of Hollywood films and even smaller indie films do.

04:39.300 --> 04:43.000
And obviously, the examples I've chosen have all pretty clear three-act structures,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.800
because this is a video about three-act structures.

04:45.800 --> 04:48.100
And also, spoilers for the following films.

04:48.100 --> 04:51.100
So in this context, the operative word here is tension.

04:51.100 --> 04:55.100
Individual acts and sequences have tension, and the narrative as a whole has tension.

04:55.100 --> 04:58.700
The beginning and end of acts marks the changes or shift in the tension.

04:58.700 --> 05:01.500
A typical screenplay features eight sequences.

05:01.500 --> 05:05.200
Two in Act 1, four in Act 2, two in Act 3.

05:05.200 --> 05:08.900
Sequences are defined by a build and release of minor tensions,

05:08.900 --> 05:10.900
all while contributing to the main tension.

05:10.900 --> 05:14.600
There are main act tensions, and there are individual sequence tensions.

05:14.600 --> 05:17.600
An example of a sequence tension would be,

05:17.600 --> 05:21.100
will Tony be able to build a suit that works?

05:21.100 --> 05:23.000
Two...

05:23.000 --> 05:24.700
One.

05:24.700 --> 05:27.800
That tension is relieved when he successfully tests it.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.500
The following sequence tension is,

05:29.500 --> 05:33.000
is Tony's new suit capable of doing what he wants it to do?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
The tension is relieved at the end of the sequence,

05:35.000 --> 05:38.600
but also builds to the main tension of the bigger bad wanting to take him down.

05:38.600 --> 05:42.600
There must be more than this provincial life!

05:42.600 --> 05:45.500
A backstory establishes the status quo for the protagonist,

05:45.500 --> 05:47.300
and sets the rules of the universe.

05:47.300 --> 05:51.100
This usually happens at the very beginning of Act 1, but can be weaved throughout.

05:51.100 --> 05:53.000
Sequence 1 usually explains the universe,

05:53.000 --> 05:55.600
and will also usually give us some sort of flaw or desire

05:55.600 --> 05:58.100
that's leaving the protagonist feeling incomplete.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.500
Die!

05:59.500 --> 06:00.900
You do not die!

06:00.900 --> 06:02.800
Luke wants to go to flight academy.

06:02.800 --> 06:06.000
Eddie is an alcoholic racist who hasn't mourned the loss of his brother.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.300
Shia LaBeouf is a sh**ty human being.

06:09.300 --> 06:11.700
Your point of attack is the thing that gets the ball rolling.

06:11.700 --> 06:14.000
This probably has nothing to do with the protagonist,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.200
and instead focuses on the universe.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.900
This creates a story element for your protagonist to react to,

06:18.900 --> 06:21.100
and that reaction becomes the inciting incident.

06:21.100 --> 06:24.500
And yes, I did get the point of attack and inciting incident reversed in the Hercules video.

06:24.500 --> 06:27.400
That's my bad. It's been a long time since I've taken this class. Shut up.

06:27.400 --> 06:31.600
Your point of attack will probably be outside of the protagonist's control or even knowledge,

06:31.600 --> 06:34.900
and the inciting incident is where the conflict comes home to roost for our protagonist,

06:34.900 --> 06:37.400
meaning our protagonist needs to do something.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.900
It can also be something that will eventually lead the main character

06:39.900 --> 06:42.000
to making an important decision at the end of Act 1.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.800
That inciting incident marks the end of the first sequence of the first act.

06:45.800 --> 06:51.100
That first sequence tension is resolved by however the protagonist reacts to that inciting incident.

06:51.100 --> 06:53.700
Be it finding a bag of money in the desert,

06:53.700 --> 06:55.600
or volunteering as tribute.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.400
I volunteer as tribute!

06:57.400 --> 07:00.100
Realizing the satellite signal is a countdown,

07:00.100 --> 07:03.300
or finding out that Roger Rabbit allegedly killed a guy.

07:03.300 --> 07:05.600
Marvin Acme.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.600
The rabbit cacked him last night.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.700
In a film with a more passive protagonist, like Mad Max Fury Road,

07:10.700 --> 07:14.000
the inciting incident is where Furiosa decides to go off-roading.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.700
And yes, we all know it's Furiosa's story,

07:15.700 --> 07:18.600
but Max is the point-of-view character and his growth defines the structure of the story,

07:18.600 --> 07:20.400
and therefore he is the protagonist.

07:20.400 --> 07:23.100
The inciting incident will also set up the central conflict,

07:23.100 --> 07:25.000
which is displayed through character motivation.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.500
That central conflict can be the desire to win over the princess,

07:28.500 --> 07:30.700
the desire to win over the princess,

07:30.700 --> 07:32.700
or the desire to win over the...

07:32.700 --> 07:33.800
robo...

07:33.800 --> 07:35.000
princess...

07:35.000 --> 07:36.800
See, this one's compelling and easy to resolve,

07:36.800 --> 07:39.400
which is why romance is such a common narrative device.

07:39.400 --> 07:42.700
In super utmost simplest terms, the want will drive the main tension,

07:42.700 --> 07:44.900
which is resolved at the end of the second act.

07:44.900 --> 07:48.100
I'm here to erase Clementine Krasinski.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.600
Max wants to survive and be alone.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.600
Tony wants to take control of the weapons he's sold.

07:53.600 --> 07:56.800
Eddie Valiant wants to find out who's made a patsy out of him.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.600
Somebody's made a patsy out of me, and I'm gonna find a wife!

07:59.600 --> 08:02.900
And the protagonist's need, which defines the character growth,

08:02.900 --> 08:04.700
will resolve the tension of the third act.

08:04.700 --> 08:06.800
Again, these are rules that don't apply to all films,

08:06.800 --> 08:11.200
and you're more likely to see them in really conventional, easy-to-digest narratives like Disney movies.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.900
The want is the protagonist's internal motivation and pushes the narrative forward.

08:14.900 --> 08:16.900
There's this girl.

08:16.900 --> 08:20.200
Even in ensemble pieces, where everyone gets their own subplot and character arc,

08:20.200 --> 08:24.600
the momentum of the plot is generally going to be pushed by one character's central conflict.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.800
In X-Men 2, for instance, it's Wolverine's search for his past,

08:27.800 --> 08:30.900
which culminates in him turning his back on the one guy with the key to it.

08:30.900 --> 08:36.600
So, the incident being incited, the second sequence of the first act builds to the creation of the main tension,

08:36.600 --> 08:40.300
culminating with a lock-in, or the hero deciding to go on their quest.

08:40.300 --> 08:41.500
You have my word.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.200
Done!

08:43.200 --> 08:48.100
The quest can be small and interpersonal, like deciding to go to France to get your cheating fiance back,

08:48.100 --> 08:50.900
or to erase all memory of your ex-girlfriend,

08:50.900 --> 08:54.400
or more epic, like volunteering to take the ring to Mordor,

08:54.400 --> 08:57.100
or deciding to go with Obi-Wan to learn the ways of the Jedi,

08:57.100 --> 09:00.300
or deciding to help Furiosa and the wives escape Immortan Joe.

09:00.300 --> 09:05.300
It can also mean that your basic human decency means you are now stuck in a deadly game of cat and mouse.

09:05.300 --> 09:08.300
The end of Act 1 establishes what's called the main tension.

09:08.300 --> 09:10.700
We're going to the green place of many mothers.

09:10.700 --> 09:12.800
Will Luke and Obi-Wan find Princess Leia?

09:12.800 --> 09:14.800
Will Luella now smart Chigurh?

09:14.800 --> 09:17.700
Will Jango succeed in rescuing his wife from Kandi?

09:17.700 --> 09:20.400
Sequence 3 marks the first sequence of Act 2.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.700
Usually, this will show the quest making some ground,

09:22.700 --> 09:26.500
and culminate with our heroes achieving some milestone, or learning something.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.500
Hercules competes his training.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.700
Simba decides Hakuna Matata.

09:30.700 --> 09:33.300
Tony begins to develop a new Iron Man suit.

09:33.300 --> 09:35.400
Sequence 4 sees the build-up to the midpoint,

09:35.400 --> 09:40.700
which most commonly shows us the protagonist working towards the first serious attempt to achieve their goal.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.300
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!

09:42.300 --> 09:45.500
Megamind trains his replacement rival for their first battle.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.900
Hercules goes looking for a fight to prove himself.

09:47.900 --> 09:49.900
Simba begins to revisit his past.

09:54.100 --> 09:56.200
Sequence 4 culminates with the midpoint.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.900
Usually, this will change the aim of the hero's quest.

09:58.900 --> 10:01.300
The midpoint marks some sort of disruption.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.900
The protagonist runs into his childhood lion best friend,

10:03.900 --> 10:07.100
disrupting his idyllic life and making him question his decisions.

10:07.100 --> 10:09.100
Maybe our protagonist's little friend died,

10:09.100 --> 10:11.300
showing them that they're not only fighting for themselves,

10:11.300 --> 10:13.500
and also gaining them sympathy in the eyes of the masses.

10:13.500 --> 10:16.800
Or maybe getting dumped makes them revert to their old, evil ways.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.900
Joel realizes he doesn't want to have his memory of Clementine erased,

10:19.900 --> 10:21.800
and begins trying to stop the process.

10:21.800 --> 10:25.900
Can you hear me? I don't want this anymore! I want to call it off!

10:25.900 --> 10:28.200
The main tension of the second act hasn't been resolved,

10:28.200 --> 10:30.100
but something about it has changed.

10:30.100 --> 10:32.300
The midpoint ups the tension for the final match

10:32.300 --> 10:35.700
by shifting the focus of the main tension while not yet resolving it.

10:35.700 --> 10:38.600
The fifth sequence following the midpoint will build on this change.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.700
The challenge here is generally to keep from second act sag.

10:41.700 --> 10:44.100
When someone says that there are problems in the second act,

10:44.100 --> 10:45.500
that's probably what they mean.

10:45.500 --> 10:49.000
The shift in focus from the midpoint doesn't follow through in a satisfactory manner,

10:49.000 --> 10:52.800
where there's filler in the middle that lengthens the runtime or adds action scenes,

10:52.800 --> 10:55.400
but doesn't really add any momentum or tension.

10:55.400 --> 10:59.800
The fifth sequence will also usually focus on some subplot or secondary character backstory,

10:59.800 --> 11:03.700
so as not to make the story too monolithic, and also to ease some tension.

11:03.700 --> 11:06.000
Meg realizes she's falling in love with Hercules.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.200
The war boy, who was our hero's enemy, now joins the side of the righteous.

11:10.200 --> 11:13.300
The receptionist, while outwardly dating Mark Ruffalo,

11:13.300 --> 11:15.900
begins to show an unusual interest in her boss.

11:15.900 --> 11:17.200
Subplots are important.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.500
They keep the story from feeling too episodic,

11:19.500 --> 11:22.600
like one guy just encountering a series of obstacles,

11:22.600 --> 11:26.400
and other characters can help resolve loose threads and expand on more universal themes.

11:26.400 --> 11:29.300
The sixth sequence is the last sequence of the second act.

11:29.300 --> 11:33.300
The end of act two shows us the main culmination, or the resolution of the main tension.

11:33.300 --> 11:37.400
The end of act two will generally have the protagonist encounter their biggest challenge yet,

11:37.400 --> 11:41.400
which is why the end of act two typically is when we see our hero at their lowest point.

11:41.400 --> 11:45.800
Our hero's a zero! Our hero's a zero!

11:45.800 --> 11:49.400
And is generally the preamble to some momentous decision that defines character growth,

11:49.400 --> 11:51.400
and creates the new tension in act three.

11:51.400 --> 11:55.200
We have set out to find the Green Place, only to find out it no longer exists.

11:55.200 --> 11:58.400
Joel's memories of Clementine have now been all erased.

11:58.400 --> 12:01.500
Jafar just golfed me into the Himalayas or something,

12:01.500 --> 12:03.400
and now everything seems hopeless.

12:03.400 --> 12:07.100
If it's a whodunit, generally this is where you will find out whodunit.

12:07.100 --> 12:10.900
That's the gun that killed R.K. Maroon, and Doom pulled the trigger.

12:10.900 --> 12:13.600
And act three will be about bringing whodunit to justice.

12:13.600 --> 12:18.100
Also, if there is a big betrayal, or the plot is built on some character deceiving another,

12:18.100 --> 12:19.400
that generally goes here.

12:19.400 --> 12:23.200
Being your little chickie-poo here was working for me all the time.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.200
Llewellyn dies at the end of act two of No Country for Old Men,

12:26.200 --> 12:29.300
and act three is a much more thematic build and release of tension,

12:29.300 --> 12:32.000
rather than being action-driven as the first two acts had been,

12:32.000 --> 12:34.600
with the conclusion of the film being much more existential.

12:34.600 --> 12:39.300
It is still very much three acts, as demonstrated by the build and release of different tensions.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.600
Sequence seven marks the beginning of act three,

12:41.600 --> 12:46.000
and begins with the protagonist making some momentous decision that creates act three's tension.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.300
I suggest we go back the same way we came.

12:48.300 --> 12:52.600
Act three's tension will be related to the main tension, but is now different.

12:52.600 --> 12:57.400
The tension is no longer escape with Jango's wife, it's destroy Candyland completely.

12:57.400 --> 13:01.600
It is no longer will Katniss save herself, but will Katniss and Peeta save each other.

13:01.600 --> 13:06.600
It is no longer escape to the Green Place, but overthrow the existing power structure completely.

13:06.600 --> 13:10.300
It is important to note that the third act tension can't come completely out of nowhere.

13:10.300 --> 13:12.700
It can't simply be an extension of the main tension,

13:12.700 --> 13:15.900
but must also build on it in order to be satisfying to the audience.

13:16.600 --> 13:18.500
Holy smoke, he's a dude!

13:18.500 --> 13:21.600
The twist in the third act is important because it makes the tension more interesting

13:21.600 --> 13:24.100
than just straight fighting for 45 minutes.

13:24.100 --> 13:28.200
Although just straight fighting for 45 minutes has become increasingly popular.

13:28.200 --> 13:31.700
The twist in the third act also generally brings the focus of the third act tension

13:31.700 --> 13:34.000
from something more grand, like saving the world,

13:34.000 --> 13:38.600
to something more intimate and character-oriented, like saving a beloved character's life.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.200
Furiosa gets stabbed.

13:40.200 --> 13:43.700
This shifts the focus from overthrowing the Citadel to saving her life.

13:43.700 --> 13:45.000
Wally gets squished.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.800
This shifts the focus from bringing the humans home to saving Wally's life.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.400
Same for Meg getting squished.

13:50.400 --> 13:55.400
Or the MacGuffin being given to the physically weaker, but more central protagonist to go do the thing.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.600
The twist in the third act isn't also necessarily a twist,

13:58.600 --> 14:02.900
as Merelda's fake death in Hunchback of Notre Dame brings the conflict to a more intimate place,

14:02.900 --> 14:06.700
but it doesn't really change anything, because she was always Quasimodo's focus.

14:06.700 --> 14:10.400
But it is something that narrows or shifts the focus of the third act's main tension.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.700
Stop!

14:11.700 --> 14:14.600
The climax shows us the resolution to the final tension.

14:14.600 --> 14:17.000
Eve races to save Wally and succeeds.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.200
The magic spell is broken, Beast turns human, and Belle's like,

14:20.200 --> 14:21.800
eh, you'll do.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.300
Max gives his blood to save Furiosa's life,

14:24.300 --> 14:26.900
symbolized by him finally telling her his name.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.400
Max.

14:29.400 --> 14:30.700
My name is Max.

14:30.700 --> 14:34.100
In a romance, the couple finally gets together, and love conquers all,

14:34.100 --> 14:36.900
though this does not necessarily preclude someone dying.

14:36.900 --> 14:39.800
The climax usually pertains to some form of character growth,

14:39.800 --> 14:43.600
such as Luke learning to trust his feelings, allowing him to destroy the Death Star,

14:43.600 --> 14:47.200
or Megamind's goodness being defined by finally learning from his mistakes,

14:47.200 --> 14:48.500
which he never did as a villain.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.700
There's a benefit to losing.

14:50.700 --> 14:52.400
You get to learn from your mistakes.

14:52.500 --> 14:56.300
And the character growth we see in the third act was probably addressed in the first sequence.

14:56.300 --> 14:57.300
The tomb runs.

14:57.300 --> 15:01.500
Eddie has come to terms with his brother's death and no longer blames all of Toondam for it.

15:01.500 --> 15:05.400
Aladdin realizes that pretending to be something he's not won't win him love.

15:05.400 --> 15:10.200
Joel accepts that our memories, even painful ones, make us who we are and must be lived with.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.900
Shia LaBeouf, well, he's still a s**t,

15:12.900 --> 15:16.600
but now he's a s**t that stuck a cube in Megatron's chest, I guess.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.300
But this resolution doesn't always have to be so conventional.

15:19.300 --> 15:22.800
For instance, with Nightcrawler, where the growth is that he doesn't grow,

15:22.800 --> 15:24.600
and that's what makes the narrative unsettling.

15:24.600 --> 15:28.400
Hopefully, you don't notice structure elements while you're watching a movie for the first time,

15:28.400 --> 15:30.900
unless you're bored and that's all you can focus on.

15:30.900 --> 15:32.100
And I've definitely done that.

15:32.100 --> 15:35.600
But they are there for us to learn from and to help us learn how tension and conflict

15:35.600 --> 15:38.700
is created and maintained throughout a two-hour-ish narrative.

15:38.700 --> 15:41.900
We don't study the three-act structure to learn how to be more creative,

15:41.900 --> 15:45.600
but to be more critical of writing and aware of what drives momentum of a story.

15:45.600 --> 15:50.300
Hulk asserts that learning about act structure is not instructing you how to actually write.

15:50.300 --> 15:53.900
It provides none of the good stuff that is critical to understanding narrative.

15:53.900 --> 15:55.400
And I would agree with the first part,

15:55.400 --> 15:58.700
but not the assessment that it provides no basis for understanding narrative.

15:58.700 --> 16:01.200
I don't think the study of story helps with the creative process

16:01.200 --> 16:05.300
so much as it helps us to understand why what we've already created works.

16:05.300 --> 16:08.700
But structure and tension also does not exist independent from character.

16:08.700 --> 16:09.600
Far from it.

16:09.600 --> 16:12.500
You need character motivation in order for narrative to have tension,

16:12.500 --> 16:15.300
and you need to have plot stuff in order to have character motivation.

16:15.400 --> 16:19.100
As a writer, if you think only in terms of ticking boxes for the sake of structure,

16:19.100 --> 16:21.900
yeah, it's probably not going to be a very great story.

16:21.900 --> 16:24.500
That, I think, is one of the biggest problems with Hercules.

16:24.500 --> 16:29.400
But it can help us to understand where and how tension and conflict exist and can be bettered.

16:29.400 --> 16:34.200
I also don't think of the three-act structure as necessarily something to advocate or not advocate,

16:34.200 --> 16:37.000
but simply the most common and commercial style of narrative,

16:37.000 --> 16:38.700
and therefore a good place to start learning.

16:38.700 --> 16:42.400
I don't think it's mandatory for all film narratives to have a three-act structure,

16:42.400 --> 16:46.900
but I do think it helps to understand how it works before one decides to expand upon that structure.

16:46.900 --> 16:50.400
It is, after all, the most common and utilized for a reason.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.400
Thank you for watching.

16:51.400 --> 16:57.700
If you have any examples or discussions about movies that do or do not necessarily adhere to the three-act structure,

16:57.700 --> 16:59.600
go ahead and leave them in the comments below.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.900
Thanks for watching, and I will see you next time.
