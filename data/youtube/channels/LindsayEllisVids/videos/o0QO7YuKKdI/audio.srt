1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
So, in the Hercules video, I talked a lot about the three-act structure that is really common in Hollywood screenplays,

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,300
and someone in the comments linked to an article by Film Crit Hulk from 2013,

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,300
wherein Hulk argues against what he calls the myth of the three-act structure.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,300
Now, Hulk has written some great film journalism over the years,

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,600
but on this, well, I pretty much disagree with most of his assertions,

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,600
and I think this stems from a disagreement on what an act even is and what purpose it serves in a narrative.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,900
There is a misconception that an act in a screenplay pertains to where any given scene falls in the narrative.

8
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:38,100
Hulk even points this out, that most people, when asked, think it's an issue of placement rather than function.

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,600
Hulk contends that his fellow journalists, film students, writers, etc.,

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,200
can't actually define an act except for where it falls in the story, and that the idea of three acts is actually meaningless.

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,700
Now, applying a structure to a narrative is a form of theory, and people get confused by this all the time,

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,400
what we mean by theory, so in this context, it's this.

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,900
It's not a scientific theory, like theory of evolution, or like a colloquial theory, as in, like, a hypothesis,

14
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,700
but analytical theory is a form of academia that aims to frame a work, an artist, or a movement

15
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,200
in terms of history, meaning, interpretation, sociology, psychology, etc.

16
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,100
Film theory is distinct from, say, film criticism and film history, although there is some overlap.

17
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:24,100
For instance, applying feminist film theory or psychoanalytical film theory to, say, Hitchcock's North by Northwest,

18
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:31,600
vagina, will net you a different reading than if you were to apply auteur theory to the same, though not completely different.

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,000
Theory is taking a guideline of thought based on a comparable precedent to an already existing body of work.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,800
So when we talk about theory as it applies to the three-act structure,

21
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,400
I do agree that it's not terribly useful for writers to start their own work,

22
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,600
be it a short story, a novel, a screenplay, or a web video, feeling the need to hit the points of a three-act structure.

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,700
When you're outlining something, it's best not to think about that sort of thing,

24
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,100
but when you come out the other side, you will probably find that you've unconsciously created a three-act structure

25
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,400
just by the nature of the way story structure has evolved throughout the history of Western civilization.

26
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,500
You have probably learned how to write a three-act structure simply by osmosis.

27
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,300
However, if you go online and look at forums where people try to find examples of movies that don't adhere to three-act structure,

28
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,900
most of their examples will.

29
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:18,100
I see movies like No Country for Old Men, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Pulp Fiction as counterexamples.

30
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:24,400
The three-act structure is there in all of these movies, but it's hidden in storytelling that is less conventional than, say, Independence Day,

31
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,700
which has its three acts so carefully outlined that they are divided by date.

32
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,800
I was originally going to use Transformers Revenge of the Fallen as a counterexample, but nope.

33
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,900
All of these act points are there, even the twist in the third act,

34
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,200
but these points are so buried in plot clutter that it feels a lot more muddied and random than it actually is.

35
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,100
Hulk's main contention is that dividing stories into three parts is arbitrary

36
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,600
because a movie can have any number of breaks and therefore acts that create propulsion.

37
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,800
He cites the Shakespearean five-act structure as superior and uses 2008's Iron Man as an example,

38
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,900
which I find particularly odd as Iron Man uses a very rigid three-act structure.

39
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,600
The conventional wisdom contends Hulk is that an act marks the point where a character can't go back,

40
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,700
and I don't think that's an accurate or helpful assessment.

41
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,500
But story structure is not a myth, it is theory and can be interpreted in a variety of different ways

42
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,800
depending on what framework you're using.

43
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,500
You can argue that any narrative has three acts or five or nine,

44
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,600
but it is useful to keep in mind that while most feature-length movies will adhere to a fairly easy-to-recognize three-act structure,

45
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,800
not all do.

46
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,300
Psycho is a good, more well-known example of a Hollywood movie that doesn't use the classic three-act structure.

47
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,000
Hulk cites Malcolm X as an example, and on that I would have to agree,

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,600
but the simple three-act structure tends to be most popular because it lends itself well to a 90-minute-to-two-hour screenplay,

49
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,500
given the length of sequences that tend to be satisfying to a mainstream audience.

50
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,000
So I've provided a link to the article in question below,

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,500
and also the de-Hulkifier bookmarklet if you have a hard time reading Film Crit Hulk's all-caps mode of writing.

52
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,100
And again, being broken up into three acts doesn't mean acts need to adhere to any particular length.

53
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,700
Movies like The Lion King, The Hunger Games, and Spider-Man all have really long first acts,

54
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,600
and their midpoints are generally 60% to 70% through the movie.

55
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,300
Act breaks aren't a question of length, but function.

56
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:13,400
For another source, Todd Vanderwerf of Vox.com wrote a more recent article about the decay of the second act

57
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,500
we've seen in more recent Hollywood fare, like Independence Day Resurgence and Fan-for-stick.

58
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,200
That article is also linked below.

59
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,500
I don't think it's a question of which structure is superior, five acts versus three,

60
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,700
but which structure is most effective for the story it's trying to tell.

61
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,800
Formula can be used to great end or to not-so-great end.

62
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,900
So, needless to say, not all narratives adhere to this structure,

63
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,300
but the vast majority of Hollywood films and even smaller indie films do.

64
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,000
And obviously, the examples I've chosen have all pretty clear three-act structures,

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,800
because this is a video about three-act structures.

66
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,100
And also, spoilers for the following films.

67
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,100
So in this context, the operative word here is tension.

68
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,100
Individual acts and sequences have tension, and the narrative as a whole has tension.

69
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,700
The beginning and end of acts marks the changes or shift in the tension.

70
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,500
A typical screenplay features eight sequences.

71
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,200
Two in Act 1, four in Act 2, two in Act 3.

72
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,900
Sequences are defined by a build and release of minor tensions,

73
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,900
all while contributing to the main tension.

74
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,600
There are main act tensions, and there are individual sequence tensions.

75
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,600
An example of a sequence tension would be,

76
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,100
will Tony be able to build a suit that works?

77
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,000
Two...

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,700
One.

79
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,800
That tension is relieved when he successfully tests it.

80
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,500
The following sequence tension is,

81
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,000
is Tony's new suit capable of doing what he wants it to do?

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The tension is relieved at the end of the sequence,

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,600
but also builds to the main tension of the bigger bad wanting to take him down.

84
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,600
There must be more than this provincial life!

85
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,500
A backstory establishes the status quo for the protagonist,

86
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,300
and sets the rules of the universe.

87
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,100
This usually happens at the very beginning of Act 1, but can be weaved throughout.

88
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,000
Sequence 1 usually explains the universe,

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,600
and will also usually give us some sort of flaw or desire

90
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,100
that's leaving the protagonist feeling incomplete.

91
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,500
Die!

92
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,900
You do not die!

93
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,800
Luke wants to go to flight academy.

94
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,000
Eddie is an alcoholic racist who hasn't mourned the loss of his brother.

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,300
Shia LaBeouf is a sh**ty human being.

96
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,700
Your point of attack is the thing that gets the ball rolling.

97
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,000
This probably has nothing to do with the protagonist,

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,200
and instead focuses on the universe.

99
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,900
This creates a story element for your protagonist to react to,

100
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,100
and that reaction becomes the inciting incident.

101
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,500
And yes, I did get the point of attack and inciting incident reversed in the Hercules video.

102
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,400
That's my bad. It's been a long time since I've taken this class. Shut up.

103
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,600
Your point of attack will probably be outside of the protagonist's control or even knowledge,

104
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,900
and the inciting incident is where the conflict comes home to roost for our protagonist,

105
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,400
meaning our protagonist needs to do something.

106
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,900
It can also be something that will eventually lead the main character

107
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,000
to making an important decision at the end of Act 1.

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,800
That inciting incident marks the end of the first sequence of the first act.

109
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,100
That first sequence tension is resolved by however the protagonist reacts to that inciting incident.

110
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,700
Be it finding a bag of money in the desert,

111
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,600
or volunteering as tribute.

112
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,400
I volunteer as tribute!

113
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,100
Realizing the satellite signal is a countdown,

114
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,300
or finding out that Roger Rabbit allegedly killed a guy.

115
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,600
Marvin Acme.

116
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
The rabbit cacked him last night.

117
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,700
In a film with a more passive protagonist, like Mad Max Fury Road,

118
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,000
the inciting incident is where Furiosa decides to go off-roading.

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,700
And yes, we all know it's Furiosa's story,

120
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,600
but Max is the point-of-view character and his growth defines the structure of the story,

121
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,400
and therefore he is the protagonist.

122
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,100
The inciting incident will also set up the central conflict,

123
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,000
which is displayed through character motivation.

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,500
That central conflict can be the desire to win over the princess,

125
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,700
the desire to win over the princess,

126
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,700
or the desire to win over the...

127
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,800
robo...

128
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,000
princess...

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,800
See, this one's compelling and easy to resolve,

130
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,400
which is why romance is such a common narrative device.

131
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,700
In super utmost simplest terms, the want will drive the main tension,

132
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,900
which is resolved at the end of the second act.

133
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,100
I'm here to erase Clementine Krasinski.

134
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,600
Max wants to survive and be alone.

135
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,600
Tony wants to take control of the weapons he's sold.

136
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,800
Eddie Valiant wants to find out who's made a patsy out of him.

137
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,600
Somebody's made a patsy out of me, and I'm gonna find a wife!

138
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,900
And the protagonist's need, which defines the character growth,

139
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,700
will resolve the tension of the third act.

140
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,800
Again, these are rules that don't apply to all films,

141
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,200
and you're more likely to see them in really conventional, easy-to-digest narratives like Disney movies.

142
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,900
The want is the protagonist's internal motivation and pushes the narrative forward.

143
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,900
There's this girl.

144
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,200
Even in ensemble pieces, where everyone gets their own subplot and character arc,

145
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,600
the momentum of the plot is generally going to be pushed by one character's central conflict.

146
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,800
In X-Men 2, for instance, it's Wolverine's search for his past,

147
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,900
which culminates in him turning his back on the one guy with the key to it.

148
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:36,600
So, the incident being incited, the second sequence of the first act builds to the creation of the main tension,

149
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,300
culminating with a lock-in, or the hero deciding to go on their quest.

150
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,500
You have my word.

151
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,200
Done!

152
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,100
The quest can be small and interpersonal, like deciding to go to France to get your cheating fiance back,

153
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,900
or to erase all memory of your ex-girlfriend,

154
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,400
or more epic, like volunteering to take the ring to Mordor,

155
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,100
or deciding to go with Obi-Wan to learn the ways of the Jedi,

156
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,300
or deciding to help Furiosa and the wives escape Immortan Joe.

157
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,300
It can also mean that your basic human decency means you are now stuck in a deadly game of cat and mouse.

158
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,300
The end of Act 1 establishes what's called the main tension.

159
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,700
We're going to the green place of many mothers.

160
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,800
Will Luke and Obi-Wan find Princess Leia?

161
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Will Luella now smart Chigurh?

162
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,700
Will Jango succeed in rescuing his wife from Kandi?

163
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,400
Sequence 3 marks the first sequence of Act 2.

164
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,700
Usually, this will show the quest making some ground,

165
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,500
and culminate with our heroes achieving some milestone, or learning something.

166
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Hercules competes his training.

167
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,700
Simba decides Hakuna Matata.

168
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,300
Tony begins to develop a new Iron Man suit.

169
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,400
Sequence 4 sees the build-up to the midpoint,

170
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,700
which most commonly shows us the protagonist working towards the first serious attempt to achieve their goal.

171
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,300
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!

172
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,500
Megamind trains his replacement rival for their first battle.

173
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,900
Hercules goes looking for a fight to prove himself.

174
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,900
Simba begins to revisit his past.

175
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,200
Sequence 4 culminates with the midpoint.

176
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,900
Usually, this will change the aim of the hero's quest.

177
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,300
The midpoint marks some sort of disruption.

178
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,900
The protagonist runs into his childhood lion best friend,

179
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,100
disrupting his idyllic life and making him question his decisions.

180
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,100
Maybe our protagonist's little friend died,

181
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,300
showing them that they're not only fighting for themselves,

182
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,500
and also gaining them sympathy in the eyes of the masses.

183
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,800
Or maybe getting dumped makes them revert to their old, evil ways.

184
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,900
Joel realizes he doesn't want to have his memory of Clementine erased,

185
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,800
and begins trying to stop the process.

186
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,900
Can you hear me? I don't want this anymore! I want to call it off!

187
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,200
The main tension of the second act hasn't been resolved,

188
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,100
but something about it has changed.

189
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,300
The midpoint ups the tension for the final match

190
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,700
by shifting the focus of the main tension while not yet resolving it.

191
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,600
The fifth sequence following the midpoint will build on this change.

192
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,700
The challenge here is generally to keep from second act sag.

193
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,100
When someone says that there are problems in the second act,

194
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,500
that's probably what they mean.

195
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,000
The shift in focus from the midpoint doesn't follow through in a satisfactory manner,

196
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,800
where there's filler in the middle that lengthens the runtime or adds action scenes,

197
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,400
but doesn't really add any momentum or tension.

198
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,800
The fifth sequence will also usually focus on some subplot or secondary character backstory,

199
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,700
so as not to make the story too monolithic, and also to ease some tension.

200
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,000
Meg realizes she's falling in love with Hercules.

201
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,200
The war boy, who was our hero's enemy, now joins the side of the righteous.

202
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,300
The receptionist, while outwardly dating Mark Ruffalo,

203
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,900
begins to show an unusual interest in her boss.

204
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,200
Subplots are important.

205
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,500
They keep the story from feeling too episodic,

206
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,600
like one guy just encountering a series of obstacles,

207
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,400
and other characters can help resolve loose threads and expand on more universal themes.

208
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,300
The sixth sequence is the last sequence of the second act.

209
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,300
The end of act two shows us the main culmination, or the resolution of the main tension.

210
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,400
The end of act two will generally have the protagonist encounter their biggest challenge yet,

211
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,400
which is why the end of act two typically is when we see our hero at their lowest point.

212
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,800
Our hero's a zero! Our hero's a zero!

213
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,400
And is generally the preamble to some momentous decision that defines character growth,

214
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,400
and creates the new tension in act three.

215
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,200
We have set out to find the Green Place, only to find out it no longer exists.

216
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,400
Joel's memories of Clementine have now been all erased.

217
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,500
Jafar just golfed me into the Himalayas or something,

218
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,400
and now everything seems hopeless.

219
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,100
If it's a whodunit, generally this is where you will find out whodunit.

220
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,900
That's the gun that killed R.K. Maroon, and Doom pulled the trigger.

221
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,600
And act three will be about bringing whodunit to justice.

222
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,100
Also, if there is a big betrayal, or the plot is built on some character deceiving another,

223
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,400
that generally goes here.

224
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,200
Being your little chickie-poo here was working for me all the time.

225
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Llewellyn dies at the end of act two of No Country for Old Men,

226
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,300
and act three is a much more thematic build and release of tension,

227
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,000
rather than being action-driven as the first two acts had been,

228
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,600
with the conclusion of the film being much more existential.

229
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,300
It is still very much three acts, as demonstrated by the build and release of different tensions.

230
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,600
Sequence seven marks the beginning of act three,

231
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,000
and begins with the protagonist making some momentous decision that creates act three's tension.

232
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,300
I suggest we go back the same way we came.

233
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,600
Act three's tension will be related to the main tension, but is now different.

234
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,400
The tension is no longer escape with Jango's wife, it's destroy Candyland completely.

235
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,600
It is no longer will Katniss save herself, but will Katniss and Peeta save each other.

236
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,600
It is no longer escape to the Green Place, but overthrow the existing power structure completely.

237
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,300
It is important to note that the third act tension can't come completely out of nowhere.

238
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,700
It can't simply be an extension of the main tension,

239
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,900
but must also build on it in order to be satisfying to the audience.

240
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,500
Holy smoke, he's a dude!

241
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,600
The twist in the third act is important because it makes the tension more interesting

242
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,100
than just straight fighting for 45 minutes.

243
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,200
Although just straight fighting for 45 minutes has become increasingly popular.

244
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,700
The twist in the third act also generally brings the focus of the third act tension

245
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,000
from something more grand, like saving the world,

246
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,600
to something more intimate and character-oriented, like saving a beloved character's life.

247
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,200
Furiosa gets stabbed.

248
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,700
This shifts the focus from overthrowing the Citadel to saving her life.

249
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,000
Wally gets squished.

250
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,800
This shifts the focus from bringing the humans home to saving Wally's life.

251
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,400
Same for Meg getting squished.

252
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,400
Or the MacGuffin being given to the physically weaker, but more central protagonist to go do the thing.

253
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,600
The twist in the third act isn't also necessarily a twist,

254
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,900
as Merelda's fake death in Hunchback of Notre Dame brings the conflict to a more intimate place,

255
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,700
but it doesn't really change anything, because she was always Quasimodo's focus.

256
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,400
But it is something that narrows or shifts the focus of the third act's main tension.

257
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,700
Stop!

258
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,600
The climax shows us the resolution to the final tension.

259
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,000
Eve races to save Wally and succeeds.

260
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,200
The magic spell is broken, Beast turns human, and Belle's like,

261
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,800
eh, you'll do.

262
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,300
Max gives his blood to save Furiosa's life,

263
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,900
symbolized by him finally telling her his name.

264
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,400
Max.

265
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,700
My name is Max.

266
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,100
In a romance, the couple finally gets together, and love conquers all,

267
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,900
though this does not necessarily preclude someone dying.

268
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,800
The climax usually pertains to some form of character growth,

269
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,600
such as Luke learning to trust his feelings, allowing him to destroy the Death Star,

270
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,200
or Megamind's goodness being defined by finally learning from his mistakes,

271
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,500
which he never did as a villain.

272
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,700
There's a benefit to losing.

273
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,400
You get to learn from your mistakes.

274
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,300
And the character growth we see in the third act was probably addressed in the first sequence.

275
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,300
The tomb runs.

276
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,500
Eddie has come to terms with his brother's death and no longer blames all of Toondam for it.

277
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,400
Aladdin realizes that pretending to be something he's not won't win him love.

278
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:10,200
Joel accepts that our memories, even painful ones, make us who we are and must be lived with.

279
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,900
Shia LaBeouf, well, he's still a s**t,

280
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,600
but now he's a s**t that stuck a cube in Megatron's chest, I guess.

281
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,300
But this resolution doesn't always have to be so conventional.

282
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,800
For instance, with Nightcrawler, where the growth is that he doesn't grow,

283
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,600
and that's what makes the narrative unsettling.

284
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,400
Hopefully, you don't notice structure elements while you're watching a movie for the first time,

285
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,900
unless you're bored and that's all you can focus on.

286
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,100
And I've definitely done that.

287
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,600
But they are there for us to learn from and to help us learn how tension and conflict

288
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,700
is created and maintained throughout a two-hour-ish narrative.

289
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,900
We don't study the three-act structure to learn how to be more creative,

290
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,600
but to be more critical of writing and aware of what drives momentum of a story.

291
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,300
Hulk asserts that learning about act structure is not instructing you how to actually write.

292
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,900
It provides none of the good stuff that is critical to understanding narrative.

293
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,400
And I would agree with the first part,

294
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,700
but not the assessment that it provides no basis for understanding narrative.

295
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,200
I don't think the study of story helps with the creative process

296
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,300
so much as it helps us to understand why what we've already created works.

297
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,700
But structure and tension also does not exist independent from character.

298
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,600
Far from it.

299
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,500
You need character motivation in order for narrative to have tension,

300
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,300
and you need to have plot stuff in order to have character motivation.

301
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,100
As a writer, if you think only in terms of ticking boxes for the sake of structure,

302
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,900
yeah, it's probably not going to be a very great story.

303
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,500
That, I think, is one of the biggest problems with Hercules.

304
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:29,400
But it can help us to understand where and how tension and conflict exist and can be bettered.

305
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:34,200
I also don't think of the three-act structure as necessarily something to advocate or not advocate,

306
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,000
but simply the most common and commercial style of narrative,

307
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,700
and therefore a good place to start learning.

308
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,400
I don't think it's mandatory for all film narratives to have a three-act structure,

309
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,900
but I do think it helps to understand how it works before one decides to expand upon that structure.

310
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,400
It is, after all, the most common and utilized for a reason.

311
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,400
Thank you for watching.

312
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:57,700
If you have any examples or discussions about movies that do or do not necessarily adhere to the three-act structure,

313
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,600
go ahead and leave them in the comments below.

314
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,900
Thanks for watching, and I will see you next time.
