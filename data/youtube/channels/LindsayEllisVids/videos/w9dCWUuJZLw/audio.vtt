00:00.000 --> 00:07.840
["Dio e Zingaro"]

00:07.840 --> 00:11.340
["Dio e Zingaro"]

00:11.340 --> 00:15.680
["Dio e Zingaro"]

00:15.680 --> 00:19.480
Of all modern treatises on historical revisionism and popular culture,

00:19.480 --> 00:23.520
the greatest of the 20th century was the series has landed,

00:23.520 --> 00:26.960
Futurama, episode 2 of season 1.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.720
The second episode of Futurama,

00:28.760 --> 00:34.160
the series has landed, takes place just after Fry has been unfrozen after a thousand years of cryogenic sleep,

00:34.160 --> 00:39.080
and has not yet had time to acclimate to the shifted perspectives and priorities of the 31st century.

00:39.080 --> 00:44.120
Now a delivery boy for an interplanetary delivery service, his first delivery is a trip to the moon.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.520
"- So, where are we going anyway?

00:45.520 --> 00:47.120
"- Nowhere special. The moon.

00:47.120 --> 00:49.360
"- The moon? The moon? The moon moon?"

00:49.360 --> 00:54.640
An exotic adventure for Fry, but a mundane trip to, well, Disney World for the rest of them.

00:54.640 --> 00:57.360
"- Gah, it's the happiest place orbiting Earth."

00:57.360 --> 01:00.560
The only thing worth visiting on the moon, in fact, is a chintzy theme park,

01:00.560 --> 01:02.720
a very thinly veiled allegory for Disney,

01:02.720 --> 01:07.760
and this very thinly veiled allegory to the Disney theme parks also does what Disney World does best.

01:07.760 --> 01:12.000
"- No one knows where, when, or how man first landed on the moon,

01:12.000 --> 01:17.360
but our fungineers think it might have happened something like this.

01:17.360 --> 01:19.280
"- We're winners on the moon!"

01:19.280 --> 01:22.560
Revise history and change it to suit the park's own needs,

01:22.560 --> 01:26.480
which the park goers accept unquestioningly, but Fry knows to be inaccurate.

01:26.480 --> 01:30.880
One of the park's signature rides is a Pirates of the Caribbean parody called Wailers on the Moon.

01:34.880 --> 01:39.040
So pointing out that the line in The Honeymooners was Ralph actually threatening physical violence,

01:39.040 --> 01:42.240
or that there were no Wailers on the Moon is met with annoyance.

01:42.240 --> 01:43.680
"- Screw this phony stuff.

01:43.680 --> 01:46.800
"- But the phony stuff is what's fun. It's boring out there."

01:46.800 --> 01:49.360
People just want to take the park's attractions at face value

01:49.360 --> 01:52.960
without thinking about the implications of this revised history and then go home.

01:53.440 --> 01:59.280
"- One of these days, Alice. Bang! Zoom! Straight to the moon."

02:00.000 --> 02:02.640
That's not an astronaut, it's a TV comedian.

02:02.640 --> 02:06.080
And he was just using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife.

02:06.080 --> 02:10.160
For the purposes of this essay, however, it's a pretty spot-on encapsulation of how people tend

02:10.160 --> 02:14.000
to get kind of defensive whenever confronted with the idea that the past isn't as simple

02:14.000 --> 02:19.120
or as pleasant as they might like to remember, but it's also a pretty spot-on parody of Walt Disney

02:19.120 --> 02:23.440
World and its tendency to sprinkle pixie dust on, you know, everything.

02:25.440 --> 02:30.160
The Disney approach to life, love, and history is a touch dated.

02:30.160 --> 02:35.360
Magic wishes happily ever after, this has been at the core of the Disney brand for almost 90 years,

02:35.360 --> 02:39.360
to the point where after decades of being one of the dominating creative forces in pop culture,

02:39.360 --> 02:43.840
this ethos has inspired countless knockoffs, which is to say nothing of the countless parodies.

02:49.440 --> 02:54.000
"- Do you not know that sucking my d*** is a serious offense? Punishable by f*** you!"

02:54.000 --> 02:57.040
Think of how many movies, television shows, and media you've seen where

02:57.040 --> 02:59.680
a character will look out into the middle distance, about to pour

02:59.680 --> 03:03.040
open their hearts through song, and then someone grinds that moment to a halt.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.760
"- Stop that! Stop that! You're not going into a song while I'm here."

03:05.760 --> 03:07.040
Even Disney's in on it now.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.440
"- Don't see. It's okay, you know? Let's just walk."

03:11.440 --> 03:15.200
Part of the post Eisner rebranding we've seen is savvy to the fact that Disney's hopes,

03:15.200 --> 03:19.520
dreams, and happily ever after message needs to be repackaged carefully to appeal to modern

03:19.520 --> 03:24.480
audiences, even contextualized as necessary just to get by day to day on this miserable

03:24.480 --> 03:25.840
dirt ball we call Earth.

03:25.840 --> 03:29.920
Enchanted is explicitly about the balance between the naivete of the old Disney model

03:29.920 --> 03:31.520
and the demands of the real world.

03:31.520 --> 03:35.120
Frozen, Disney's most lucrative animated movie to date, has its whole

03:35.120 --> 03:39.280
girl you can't marry a guy you just met bait and switch hammered in over.

03:39.280 --> 03:43.440
"- You can't marry a man you just met. You can if it's true love."

03:43.520 --> 03:44.320
And over.

03:44.960 --> 03:47.680
"- You got engaged to someone you just met that day?"

03:47.680 --> 03:51.360
Moana not only deconstructs the chosen one narrative but even features a character that

03:51.360 --> 03:55.120
is basically every middle school edgelord trying to act like he still doesn't cry at Bambi.

03:55.120 --> 03:57.440
"- The ocean chose you for a reason.

03:58.720 --> 04:01.040
If you start singing, I'm gonna throw up."

04:01.040 --> 04:03.200
Sincerity is for girls.

04:03.200 --> 04:07.280
Even Tangled makes it clear that Rapunzel and Eugene wait a few years before they settle down.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.200
"- Did Rapunzel and I ever get married?

04:09.200 --> 04:13.520
And after years and years of asking and asking and asking,

04:15.920 --> 04:17.600
I finally said yes."

04:17.600 --> 04:20.160
No more of this three-day engagement nonsense.

04:20.160 --> 04:24.240
And the weird thing is this meta examination of the Disney brand works.

04:24.240 --> 04:25.520
People like it.

04:25.520 --> 04:29.120
People will pay for Disney getting meta about Disney.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.320
"- I'll be in my room.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.080
Get your own movie."

04:34.080 --> 04:36.960
So enter 2013's Saving Mr. Banks,

04:36.960 --> 04:41.760
the most meta of the recent Disney trends of metatextual analyses within the Disney company,

04:41.760 --> 04:45.680
as it is actually about the Disney ethos and how it Disney-fies everything it touches.

04:48.720 --> 04:52.960
The studio, one of its most famous films, and Walt Disney himself,

04:52.960 --> 04:57.520
as portrayed by America's favorite uncle, giver of good hugs, and David S. Pumpkins.

04:57.520 --> 05:00.640
"- David S. Pumpkins!

05:01.360 --> 05:02.560
Any questions?"

05:03.200 --> 05:04.240
Tom Hanks.

05:04.240 --> 05:08.880
On the surface, Saving Mr. Banks tells the true-ish story of P.L. Travers

05:08.880 --> 05:12.560
and the culmination of her 20-year resistance to selling Walt Disney the rights

05:12.560 --> 05:15.840
to adapt her beloved children's books, Mary Poppins.

05:15.840 --> 05:19.120
Adapting these books had been Walt's passion project for decades.

05:19.120 --> 05:23.680
"- But then she gave me one of your books and, oh, by gosh, my imagination caught on fire.

05:23.680 --> 05:24.880
Absolutely on fire.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.840
And those embers have burned ever since, as you know.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.280
I do, yes.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.320
20 years.

05:30.320 --> 05:31.440
So you keep saying."

05:31.440 --> 05:35.360
But Travers resists because she sees Disney movies as sentimental flim-flam.

05:35.360 --> 05:38.160
"- Mary Poppins does not sing."

05:39.120 --> 05:42.480
The making of Mary Poppins' narrative is interwoven throughout with flashbacks

05:42.480 --> 05:46.080
to Travers' childhood, her relationship with her father, a loving charming man

05:46.080 --> 05:49.520
who adored his daughter and also who happened to be a chronic alcoholic

05:49.520 --> 05:51.040
and who died when she was seven.

05:51.040 --> 05:54.000
The film is titled Saving Mr. Banks because much of the negotiations

05:54.000 --> 05:57.440
between Travers and the Disney studios features a great deal of hand-rigging

05:57.440 --> 05:59.680
over the Mary Poppins character of Mr. Banks.

05:59.920 --> 06:02.320
"- I told the illustrator I did not like the facial hair,

06:02.320 --> 06:03.440
but she chose to ignore me.

06:03.440 --> 06:06.800
Now, this time around, this is my film and I shall have my way.

06:06.800 --> 06:10.000
"- Mrs. Travers, this is a specific request from Walt."

06:10.560 --> 06:10.880
"- Why?"

06:10.880 --> 06:14.240
The film even goes so far as to imply that the reason Travers is so resistant

06:14.240 --> 06:18.240
to giving Disney the rights is because she lacks closure over the death of her own father,

06:18.240 --> 06:23.040
which is why it is so important for the emotional climax of Mary Poppins to be about Mr. Banks.

06:24.320 --> 06:25.040
Yeah.

06:25.040 --> 06:27.840
But this topic is fraught in a way that most biopics aren't

06:27.840 --> 06:30.240
and people are less forgiving of creative liberties taken here

06:30.240 --> 06:32.720
in the interest of creative a compelling narrative.

06:32.720 --> 06:36.240
But Saving Mr. Banks's portrayal of Walt Disney as a shrewd businessman

06:36.240 --> 06:40.080
but basically a nice guy, it's ruffled some feathers.

06:40.080 --> 06:43.280
"- You know, there are all kinds of showmen and all kinds of show business,

06:43.840 --> 06:47.680
but it's a fact that only one or two men are at the top in any given group."

06:47.680 --> 06:50.720
This movie has been described as a piece of pro-Disney propaganda,

06:50.720 --> 06:54.320
historical revisionism in and of itself, which, you know, well, it is.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.480
"- That mouse is family."

07:01.520 --> 07:03.760
And before you fill the comment section with diatribes

07:03.760 --> 07:06.240
on how old Uncle Walt was a racist or an anti-Semite,

07:06.240 --> 07:08.320
let's just say that is a discussion for another day.

07:08.880 --> 07:09.920
A long one.

07:09.920 --> 07:10.880
Check your sources.

07:10.880 --> 07:14.640
So this movie was fraught not just because one of the main characters is Walt Disney.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.560
"- Do you always get everything you want, Walter?

07:17.760 --> 07:18.640
"- Pretty much."

07:18.640 --> 07:21.600
Who is either the patron saint of all that is good and pure about humanity

07:21.600 --> 07:24.080
or their very face of evil depending on who you ask,

07:24.080 --> 07:28.320
but also because of the underlying theme of artistic integrity versus selling out.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.640
And hey, maybe selling out is best for everyone, Pam.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.640
That's right, you get in bed with the mouse, Pam.

07:32.640 --> 07:34.240
"- Get in bed with the mouse."

07:34.240 --> 07:37.840
But all that notwithstanding, I honestly feel like this movie is underrated.

07:37.840 --> 07:41.920
The quality of the film gets buried by these comments that Walt was a very bad man

07:41.920 --> 07:44.400
and the movie, of course, treats it as a given that he isn't.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.760
For one, Saving Mr. Banks is the extremely rare father-daughter movie

07:47.760 --> 07:50.880
that isn't tied into the daughter finding herself through marriage,

07:50.880 --> 07:53.120
but is instead a broader journey about self-identity

07:53.120 --> 07:55.120
that you see more often in father-son movies.

07:55.120 --> 07:58.480
Emma Thompson does an amazing job being absolutely charming and relatable

07:58.480 --> 08:00.800
despite being an abject, unequivocal jerk.

08:03.120 --> 08:04.240
"- Will the child be a nuisance?

08:04.800 --> 08:06.000
It's an 11-hour flight."

08:07.440 --> 08:10.400
The Disney brand is so overwhelming and easy to dislike

08:10.400 --> 08:12.880
and Disney himself is so shrewd and borderline phony

08:12.880 --> 08:15.680
that even if you're in The Life as a Disney Stan,

08:15.680 --> 08:17.760
you can still totally see where she's coming from.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.840
Tom Hanks is, well, it's Tom Hanks.

08:19.840 --> 08:22.080
"- I won't have her turned into one of your silly cartoons."

08:24.720 --> 08:27.520
But as for the need to see Walt portrayed warts and all,

08:27.520 --> 08:31.440
I can see the desire for that, but that was not this movie.

08:32.160 --> 08:36.000
Mary Poppins is an interesting movie to make a making of movie about in general.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.680
Not only was it a technological breakthrough

08:37.680 --> 08:39.680
with the combination of live action and animation,

08:39.680 --> 08:43.440
but it was also Disney's last great film passion project before he died.

08:43.440 --> 08:47.760
Now, say what you want about old Uncle Walt, but the man was a capitalist.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.720
So it's interesting that this was the project he was willing to go through

08:50.720 --> 08:52.560
such great lengths to get the rights to,

08:52.560 --> 08:57.360
as it is the only Disney-era movie that is at least socialism curious.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.360
"- Please, may we feed the birds?

08:59.360 --> 09:00.400
Whatever for?

09:00.400 --> 09:02.160
I have tuppence from my money box.

09:02.160 --> 09:03.760
Just this once, please.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.920
Waste your money on a lot of ragamuffin birds?

09:05.920 --> 09:06.640
Certainly not.

09:06.640 --> 09:09.680
But I want to redistribute the wealth, father."

09:09.680 --> 09:13.760
Mary Poppins is one of those antagonist-less kids movies,

09:13.760 --> 09:17.600
but if there is a villain in Mary Poppins, then it is the bank.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.280
"- No, not that stadium."

09:22.960 --> 09:26.320
And I'm not normally a fan of dad-you-work-too-hard lessons in movies,

09:26.320 --> 09:27.920
but I think it works in Mary Poppins

09:27.920 --> 09:30.880
because of the way it satirizes the fragility of the bank system

09:30.880 --> 09:33.600
and the way it ties in with Mr. Banks' skewed priorities.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.440
"- And just how much money do you have, young man?

09:36.080 --> 09:38.320
Tuppence, but I want it to feed the birds."

09:39.360 --> 09:42.640
A kid who wants to feed the birds causes a bank run.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.400
"- Give it back!

09:44.400 --> 09:45.360
Give me back the money!"

09:45.360 --> 09:48.000
The people shall cease the means of production!

09:48.000 --> 09:49.200
Feed the birds!"

09:49.200 --> 09:51.680
The biggest source of conflict in the Mary Poppins universe,

09:51.680 --> 09:52.880
the Disney version anyway,

09:52.880 --> 09:56.800
is how the obsession with money and prestige comes at the cost of being good parents.

09:56.800 --> 09:59.200
And the irony of all of this, the parent storyline,

09:59.200 --> 10:02.800
the socialism curiousness, the bank being evil,

10:03.360 --> 10:06.080
aside from mentions of Mr. Banks being unhappy,

10:06.080 --> 10:09.440
this whole storyline wasn't in the original book but added by Disney.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.920
Part of this was to give the story a more film-like shape,

10:11.920 --> 10:14.160
what with giving the characters more of an arc,

10:14.160 --> 10:17.200
and part was to make it more relatable to families of the 1960s

10:17.200 --> 10:18.640
who may not quite understand

10:18.640 --> 10:22.000
why a family with a stay-at-home mother would even need a nanny

10:22.000 --> 10:27.040
if she didn't have some, you know, hobby or activity to do all day,

10:27.040 --> 10:29.440
which is actually addressed in Mr. Banks.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.480
"- Why in the world have you made Mrs. Banks a silly suffragette?

10:32.480 --> 10:35.360
I wonder if Emmeline P would agree with that adjective."

10:35.360 --> 10:38.400
And the majority of the stuff that is changed from the source material,

10:38.400 --> 10:42.000
that of giving the family itself an arc to rediscover itself and each other,

10:42.000 --> 10:44.400
is really the biggest change from Travers' books

10:44.400 --> 10:47.760
and ends up itself compromising most of the plot of saving Mr. Banks.

10:48.480 --> 10:52.160
"- It does seem strange that Mrs. Banks allows her kids

10:52.160 --> 10:55.600
to spend all of their time with the nanny when she doesn't have a job to speak."

10:55.600 --> 10:58.000
The structural changes that Travers most resisted

10:58.000 --> 11:01.520
ended up being kind of necessary to make it watchable as a feature film.

11:01.520 --> 11:04.000
So that Mary Poppins exists at all is noteworthy

11:04.000 --> 11:06.240
and the story of how it came to pass is compelling,

11:06.240 --> 11:09.600
even if, shall we say, creative liberties were taken.

11:09.600 --> 11:13.120
Yes, the film does ultimately come down favoring Walt's perspective.

11:13.120 --> 11:17.120
One would struggle to say that it celebrates Travers' work more than it does Disney's.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.040
"- The rain brings life.

11:23.040 --> 11:24.240
So does the sun."

11:24.240 --> 11:26.320
But on the whole, with the exception of this scene

11:26.320 --> 11:28.720
where Disney and Travers have the daddy issues discussion...

11:28.720 --> 11:30.880
"- It's not the children she comes to save.

11:32.800 --> 11:33.680
It's their father.

11:37.760 --> 11:38.800
It's your father."

11:38.800 --> 11:44.880
The film does hue true-ish if you move some timeline elements and characters around.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.960
Disney did travel to London to meet with Travers,

11:46.960 --> 11:49.200
several times in fact, but it wasn't at the 11th hour

11:49.200 --> 11:52.480
and probably didn't involve any stories about flawed tragic fathers.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.560
"- You best be quick there, Walt.

11:54.560 --> 11:59.200
You better get those newspapers up on that porch and under that storm door,

11:59.200 --> 12:02.720
Poppins are gonna lose his temper again and show you the buckle end of his belt."

12:02.720 --> 12:05.280
Disney's story about forced child labor is true,

12:05.280 --> 12:09.920
but he never went on record to frame that as anything other than good, hard, honest American work.

12:09.920 --> 12:12.480
Ralph the car driver and his disabled daughter didn't exist,

12:12.480 --> 12:15.120
but he was a composite character of Disney Studios workers

12:15.120 --> 12:16.960
who did befriend Travers during her stay.

12:18.160 --> 12:21.440
There is no evidence that Travers danced and sang to Let's Go Fly a Kite,

12:21.440 --> 12:24.480
but she did sing along to Feed the Birds on those tapes.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.560
And yes, she did insist on those tapes.

12:26.560 --> 12:30.400
"- No, no. That we cannot have. That would be quite un-English."

12:30.400 --> 12:33.040
Disney did snub Travers an invitation to the film's premiere.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.600
"- An easy decision for me, but you know what she's like.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.400
We got press interviews, cameras."

12:38.400 --> 12:41.360
And she did make a big stink about it and showed up just to spite him.

12:41.360 --> 12:43.280
She did go to Disneyland and she hated it,

12:43.280 --> 12:45.600
but Walt wasn't there and no carousels were written.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.920
Walt wasn't even present during the two-week meeting.

12:47.920 --> 12:51.120
He peaced out after day one because he got so frustrated with Travers

12:51.120 --> 12:53.200
and then let the Sherman brothers deal with her.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.520
"- Does it matter?

12:59.280 --> 13:00.720
You can wait outside."

13:00.720 --> 13:03.760
But for adaptational criticisms, more people had a beef with the idea

13:03.760 --> 13:07.760
that P.L. Travers was ultimately happy with the film version of Mary Poppins.

13:07.760 --> 13:10.560
Travers did cry at the premiere, but not because she was touched

13:10.560 --> 13:13.120
or had gotten some sense of closure so much as from grief

13:13.120 --> 13:16.640
that her beloved creation was no longer hers and never would be again.

13:16.640 --> 13:19.920
But there is some truth to the idea that she eventually was okay with it,

13:19.920 --> 13:21.520
again, if you stretch the timeline a bit.

13:21.520 --> 13:24.080
In a 1977 interview, Travers remarked,

13:24.080 --> 13:26.640
''I've seen it once or twice and I've learned to live with it.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.960
It's glamorous and it's a good film on its own level,

13:28.960 --> 13:31.040
but I don't think it is very like my books.''

13:31.040 --> 13:33.200
Travers did not make peace with the film at the premiere,

13:33.200 --> 13:36.160
but she did after a few decades,

13:36.160 --> 13:38.080
admitting that there were parts of the movie she liked

13:38.080 --> 13:41.120
and even incorporating ideas conceived by the Disney story department

13:41.120 --> 13:43.680
into the final Mary Poppins novel in 1988.

13:43.680 --> 13:46.720
It is true, however, that she never made peace with the dancing penguins.

13:46.720 --> 13:49.280
"- Mrs. Travers, what has you so upset now?

13:50.320 --> 13:50.960
Penguins.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.560
Penguins have very much upset me, Mr. Disney."

13:54.560 --> 13:57.520
Others have called the film a character assassination on Travers herself,

13:57.520 --> 14:00.160
and the film kind of glosses over or wipes its hands

14:00.160 --> 14:02.800
of some of P.L. Travers' less flattering personal histories.

14:03.360 --> 14:04.400
"- You got kids?

14:04.400 --> 14:05.760
No, well, not precisely."

14:05.760 --> 14:09.120
We can touch on the ethics of portraying Travers as a frigid fuddy-duddy

14:09.120 --> 14:10.800
who just needs to loosen up and sell out.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.280
"- What is all this...

14:14.240 --> 14:15.440
...jewelification?

14:15.440 --> 14:18.560
If you so much as step one foot in here with that trolley, I shall scream.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.120
One cannot live on cake alone.

14:21.840 --> 14:23.520
I hope we crash."

14:23.520 --> 14:25.120
But in terms of this story,

14:25.120 --> 14:28.640
to put it diplomatically, Travers was not a good team player.

14:28.640 --> 14:31.920
If the film softens Walt Disney, it softens Travers too.

14:31.920 --> 14:34.000
But perhaps the most common complaint with the film

14:34.000 --> 14:36.800
wasn't about Travers but the way it softens Walt's edges,

14:36.800 --> 14:38.240
and that it definitely does.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.600
"- You see how it goes up on the word down?

14:39.600 --> 14:40.800
On the word down, it goes up.

14:40.800 --> 14:41.440
It's ironic.

14:41.440 --> 14:42.720
Well, forget ironic.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.240
That's iconic.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.080
I won't be able to stop singing that for weeks."

14:47.360 --> 14:50.800
Walt was notoriously stingy with compliments and basically never gave them,

14:50.800 --> 14:52.000
but here he is all,

14:52.000 --> 14:53.120
"- Call me Walt.

14:53.120 --> 14:53.680
Oh, Walt.

14:53.680 --> 14:54.720
You gotta call me Walt.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.720
Mr. Disney was an old man, isn't that right?

14:56.720 --> 14:57.600
Absolutely, Walt."

14:57.600 --> 15:00.400
and the loving and supportive patriarch to his staff.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.200
As per Disney Studios decree, you never see Walt smoking,

15:03.200 --> 15:04.320
but he does refer to it.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.680
You see him putting out cigarettes,

15:05.680 --> 15:08.960
and he is literally introduced with a sickly cough off-screen.

15:12.560 --> 15:13.600
Don't smoke, kids.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.320
"- But here's the thing.

15:15.040 --> 15:18.240
Walt's flaws weren't what this movie was about.

15:18.240 --> 15:21.920
I mean, did we really need a scene where he takes a break

15:21.920 --> 15:25.040
from the filming of Mary Poppins to discuss the evils of communism?"

15:26.720 --> 15:29.360
This movie is not about Walt Disney.

15:29.360 --> 15:32.240
It is about the heartbreak of giving up one's own creative vision

15:32.240 --> 15:34.160
and trusting a shameless capitalist with it.

15:34.160 --> 15:37.920
It is about the argument of whether or not doing such a thing is for the greater good

15:37.920 --> 15:39.920
and what that greater good even is.

15:39.920 --> 15:43.520
Is it bringing happiness into the lives of all or is it to educate children?

15:43.520 --> 15:46.800
"- Mary Poppins is the very enemy of whimsy and sentiment.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.000
She's truthful.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.360
She doesn't sugarcoat the darkness in the world that these children will

15:51.360 --> 15:53.520
eventually inevitably come to know.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.560
She prepares them for it.

15:54.560 --> 15:55.920
She deals in honesty."

15:55.920 --> 15:59.440
But most of all, it is about a woman's relationship to her long dead father

15:59.440 --> 16:02.480
and about how our histories and families influence who we become

16:02.480 --> 16:04.640
and how we frame our history and worldview.

16:04.640 --> 16:07.440
It's about the conflict between two creative visions.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.760
Do we view history through rose-tinted glasses

16:09.760 --> 16:12.640
or do we always need to be honest about the cruelties of the world?

16:12.640 --> 16:16.320
"- You've never been to Disneyland and that's the happiest place on Earth.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.920
Mr. Disney, I cannot begin to tell you how uninterested,

16:19.920 --> 16:24.960
no, positively sickened I am at the thought of visiting your dollar printing machine."

16:24.960 --> 16:28.480
But given Disney's approach to the framing of culture and history,

16:28.480 --> 16:31.200
you can see where Travers wouldn't be thrilled.

16:35.200 --> 16:38.880
Disney movies and theme park attractions traditionally are less set in a culture

16:38.880 --> 16:44.720
or place in history so much as a version of a culture or place in history.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.000
A very Disney version.

16:48.240 --> 16:52.240
Like Snow White is German inspired because the original fairy tale is German

16:52.240 --> 16:55.040
and I guess there is some Snow White stuff in Germany and Epcot

16:55.040 --> 17:00.080
but there's nothing really distinctively German about Disney's Snow White and Seven Dwarfs.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.320
Or Beauty and the Beast which is set in France.

17:08.080 --> 17:10.800
But not like anything resembling real France.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.560
Like you see Beauty and the Beast and you're not like,

17:12.560 --> 17:17.280
oh Beast and or his descendants are going to meet a grisly fate in a few years.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.320
In quote South America, end quote,

17:22.320 --> 17:26.080
we have the happy exploits of the three Caballeros and Saludos Amigos films.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.760
The list goes on and on.

17:27.760 --> 17:31.520
The Disney approach strips these tales and places down to broad cultural signifiers

17:31.520 --> 17:33.680
that a Western audience would happily consume.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.960
It gets rid of anything that could be considered too salacious for the Disney brand

17:36.960 --> 17:41.120
and changes the setting so that you no longer think this is a French fairy tale

17:41.120 --> 17:43.840
but instead this is a Disney fairy tale.

17:43.840 --> 17:46.080
Part of Walt Disney's evil genius was the efficacy

17:46.080 --> 17:50.160
with which he branded everything he produced as unmistakably Disney.

17:50.160 --> 17:53.760
That was the business model in 1961 so you can see where Travers would assume

17:53.760 --> 17:56.880
that this is what would happen to her beloved Mary Poppins.

17:56.880 --> 17:59.600
I won't have her turned into one of your silly cartoons.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.960
And she would be right.

18:00.960 --> 18:05.920
Cultural appropriation and historical revisionism are kind of integral to the Disney brand

18:05.920 --> 18:09.440
whether it's for narrative purposes or a meta comment

18:09.440 --> 18:12.880
on how the Disney corporation is viewing or changing itself.

18:12.880 --> 18:16.400
We could go down the rabbit hole of real world examples of historical revisionism

18:16.400 --> 18:19.840
but thing is I promised myself I'd keep this video under an hour.

18:19.840 --> 18:21.840
So let's look at Disney World attractions.

18:25.760 --> 18:30.320
There isn't anything in Disney World that isn't portrayed through that very distinct Disney filter.

18:30.320 --> 18:34.000
Main Street USA was designed to be a tribute to the hometown of Walt's childhood

18:34.000 --> 18:36.640
but no one is going to deny that it's a highly whitewashed,

18:36.640 --> 18:39.520
highly idealized version of the American small town.

18:39.520 --> 18:42.960
But if you want some real honest to god Disney style historical revisionism

18:42.960 --> 18:44.960
head on down to the hall of presidents.

18:44.960 --> 18:51.920
I'd have gone inside but unfortunately the ride is shut down because the president is bad.

18:51.920 --> 18:55.840
Sometimes Disney decides to update their attractions to changing sensitivities.

18:55.840 --> 18:59.760
Pirates of the Caribbean has this segment which is presently called the Bride Auction

18:59.760 --> 19:03.120
and will be replaced when the ride closes for maintenance in 2018.

19:03.120 --> 19:06.800
It features wenches being sold as chattel.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.200
All are tied up and some are crying.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.440
Strike your colors you brazen wench.

19:11.440 --> 19:14.240
No need to expose your superstructure.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.760
Fun for the whole family.

19:15.760 --> 19:20.240
But when the Disney company tries to respect that yeah maybe they should change some stuff

19:20.240 --> 19:23.120
this is met with resistance.

19:23.120 --> 19:27.440
And that is perhaps the problem with rooting so much of your brand in nostalgia.

19:27.440 --> 19:32.640
Whenever you point out that maybe some parts of the thing you're consuming might be unethical

19:32.720 --> 19:35.200
people take it as an assault on their childhood.

19:35.200 --> 19:38.320
No what do you mean there were no whalers on the moon?

19:38.320 --> 19:42.640
People who consume the Disneyfied version of history and culture on some level they know it's

19:42.640 --> 19:45.840
false but there's something almost traumatic in pointing out that there might be something

19:45.840 --> 19:48.400
immoral about this sort of historical revisionism.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.800
Something that doesn't jive with our modern sensibilities or even

19:50.800 --> 19:54.800
with the fun nature of what is otherwise a whimsical ride with no slavery.

19:54.800 --> 19:58.880
So it's not always just the framing is the problem it's the audience.

19:58.880 --> 20:03.200
Once you frame a history a culture or even a story in a certain way

20:03.200 --> 20:05.520
it can be really hard to unframe it.

20:07.760 --> 20:11.520
And the truth is Mary Poppins has become a Disney movie in the popular consciousness

20:11.520 --> 20:14.400
much more than it is seen as a beloved series of children's books.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.240
Lord of the Rings are still books first.

20:16.240 --> 20:18.640
The Chronicles of Narnia are still books first.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.800
But Mary Poppins is a Disney movie.

20:20.800 --> 20:25.200
The main conflict of the film ultimately comes down between both people using a fictional

20:25.200 --> 20:29.440
property as a means of reconciling their difficult memories of their fathers.

20:29.440 --> 20:31.920
She wants to know why Mr. Banks has been given a mustache.

20:31.920 --> 20:32.800
Oh I asked for that.

20:33.360 --> 20:36.160
Yes they told her that but she wants to know why.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.400
Because I asked for it.

20:38.400 --> 20:41.920
Both Travers and Walt's narratives within the movie are shown as wrapped in an obsession

20:41.920 --> 20:44.720
with preserving and mythologizing the memories of their fathers.

20:44.720 --> 20:48.160
It ends up being the crucial similarity that they share with each other.

20:48.160 --> 20:51.280
I have my own Mr. Banks.

20:52.160 --> 20:55.440
And even if this scene didn't really happen, which it didn't,

20:55.440 --> 20:58.560
there is a deep truth to the idea of the scene.

20:58.560 --> 21:06.160
Rare is the day when I don't think about that eight-year-old boy delivering newspapers in

21:06.160 --> 21:10.880
the snow and all the last Disney with that strap in his fist.

21:11.760 --> 21:15.440
I'm tired of remembering it that way.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.960
The fictional Walt of the scene knows and understands that his father was flawed and

21:18.960 --> 21:20.000
even cruel.

21:20.800 --> 21:24.720
He hasn't forgotten what's happened but it's better for him to focus on the positive

21:24.720 --> 21:29.840
memories rather than the negative ones and this informs his worldview and his business.

21:29.840 --> 21:34.720
We all have our sad tales but don't you want to finish the story?

21:35.760 --> 21:39.120
Let it all go and have a life that isn't dictated by the past?

21:39.920 --> 21:43.440
So while the scene might be totally bogus in terms of things that actually happened

21:43.440 --> 21:48.240
in the real world, it does tap into why people love Disney's rose-colored filter.

21:48.240 --> 21:52.320
Part of Disney's genius was commodifying the way people mythologized culture,

21:52.320 --> 21:54.080
especially American culture.

21:54.080 --> 21:58.560
He found a way to brand and sell it because here's the thing, historical contextualizing

21:58.560 --> 22:03.200
and yes, revisionism, it's always kind of inevitable, especially in times of national

22:03.200 --> 22:03.840
stress.

22:03.840 --> 22:08.160
Sometimes this kind of identity-branded mythologizing can be about reclaiming former glory

22:08.160 --> 22:12.080
and scapegoating the other, but Disney's brand of mythologizing was all about feeling

22:12.080 --> 22:16.640
good about what you already had and ignoring the bad parts, whether that's the totality

22:16.640 --> 22:18.000
of the story or not.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.520
This film ultimately explores the very human desire to protect the memories of the people

22:21.520 --> 22:24.080
we love, people and fictional characters.

22:24.880 --> 22:27.280
Why did you have to make him so cruel?

22:27.280 --> 22:28.880
He was not a monster.

22:28.880 --> 22:31.120
Even if they aren't always happy memories.

22:31.120 --> 22:32.640
Take this line right here.

22:32.640 --> 22:39.120
Maybe not in life but in imagination because that's what we storytellers do.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.320
We restore order with imagination.

22:42.880 --> 22:46.720
We instill hope again and again and again.

22:46.720 --> 22:50.400
This line seems almost a response to one of the longest running criticisms of Disney

22:50.400 --> 22:55.440
storytelling, that it's soppy, that it whitewashes history and culture, but I like how the movie

22:55.440 --> 22:58.080
pits it against what people actually do in real life.

22:58.080 --> 23:01.520
It's not like Walt Disney invented this by any stretch of the imagination.

23:01.520 --> 23:05.200
He just figured out really, really effectively how to sell it.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.840
As Walt himself put it in one outburst,

23:07.840 --> 23:11.520
I've worked my whole life to create the image of what Walt Disney is.

23:11.520 --> 23:12.800
It's not me.

23:12.800 --> 23:16.640
I smoke and I drink and all the things we don't want the public to know about.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.800
And here's the problem with whalers on the moon.

23:18.800 --> 23:23.600
If history, culture, and stories have been revised to fit a sanitized or outright false

23:23.600 --> 23:27.280
narrative, the onus is on the consumer to, well...

23:27.280 --> 23:28.720
Educate yourself!

23:28.720 --> 23:30.560
And the truth is, most people won't.

23:30.560 --> 23:34.000
It is kind of poetic that the linchpin of this movie, its emotional thesis,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.480
is the least historically accurate thing in the movie.

23:36.480 --> 23:39.920
And also a big reason why people feel kind of iffy about this movie because it reads

23:39.920 --> 23:43.920
as propagandistic corporate apologia for giving up one's intellectual property for the greater

23:43.920 --> 23:47.600
good of commodification and mass consumption, which, you know, it is.

23:47.600 --> 23:51.040
And I feel like there is this sort of expectation where even if you so much as admit that,

23:51.040 --> 23:53.680
you are therefore required to wholeheartedly condemn it.

23:54.240 --> 23:56.000
And, well, I can't.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.760
Because I think you can have that discussion over who owns ideas once they are out in the

23:59.760 --> 24:03.520
public consciousness while still admitting that Mary Poppins, the movie,

24:03.520 --> 24:06.400
even if it doesn't adhere to the books as much as Travers wanted...

24:06.400 --> 24:08.400
That will be quite enough of that, thank you.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.480
It's a net positive for the world.

24:10.480 --> 24:11.920
And I'm glad it exists.

24:11.920 --> 24:13.040
It's a great movie.

24:13.040 --> 24:14.080
It holds up.

24:14.080 --> 24:17.680
And even if corporate-approved Tom Hanks' movie Walt says that Mary Poppins is going

24:17.680 --> 24:21.680
to make people happy while dollar signs literally spin out of his eyes,

24:21.680 --> 24:26.560
just look at this three-year-old child on her Make-A-Wish trip to Disney World meeting Mary Poppins.

24:26.560 --> 24:30.000
She watched her over and over again when she was in the hospital last year.

24:31.440 --> 24:32.720
Just kept her going.

24:32.720 --> 24:34.720
Sorry, there's something in my eye.

24:34.720 --> 24:37.840
Life doesn't have a neat theme you can package into a two-hour movie,

24:37.840 --> 24:42.320
but as humans, we crave narrative satisfaction with the stories that we tell.

24:42.320 --> 24:46.400
So this movie can be both a borderline unethical treatise on how,

24:46.400 --> 24:49.520
after being relentlessly ground down by a major studio,

24:49.520 --> 24:52.800
selling your intellectual property to a large corporation can in some ways

24:52.800 --> 24:57.280
work toward the greater good despite robbing you of autonomy over your own creation,

24:57.280 --> 25:01.200
and it can be a thoughtful piece on the way we attach so much of our personal identity

25:01.200 --> 25:05.440
to the fictions and histories we fabricate, and how difficult it can be to let that go.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.000
It can be both.

25:12.320 --> 25:39.680
It can be both.
