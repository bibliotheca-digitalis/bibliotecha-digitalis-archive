1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
["Dio e Zingaro"]

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,340
["Dio e Zingaro"]

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,680
["Dio e Zingaro"]

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,480
Of all modern treatises on historical revisionism and popular culture,

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,520
the greatest of the 20th century was the series has landed,

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,960
Futurama, episode 2 of season 1.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,720
The second episode of Futurama,

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,160
the series has landed, takes place just after Fry has been unfrozen after a thousand years of cryogenic sleep,

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,080
and has not yet had time to acclimate to the shifted perspectives and priorities of the 31st century.

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,120
Now a delivery boy for an interplanetary delivery service, his first delivery is a trip to the moon.

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,520
"- So, where are we going anyway?

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,120
"- Nowhere special. The moon.

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,360
"- The moon? The moon? The moon moon?"

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,640
An exotic adventure for Fry, but a mundane trip to, well, Disney World for the rest of them.

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,360
"- Gah, it's the happiest place orbiting Earth."

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,560
The only thing worth visiting on the moon, in fact, is a chintzy theme park,

17
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,720
a very thinly veiled allegory for Disney,

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,760
and this very thinly veiled allegory to the Disney theme parks also does what Disney World does best.

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,000
"- No one knows where, when, or how man first landed on the moon,

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,360
but our fungineers think it might have happened something like this.

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,280
"- We're winners on the moon!"

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,560
Revise history and change it to suit the park's own needs,

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,480
which the park goers accept unquestioningly, but Fry knows to be inaccurate.

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,880
One of the park's signature rides is a Pirates of the Caribbean parody called Wailers on the Moon.

25
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,040
So pointing out that the line in The Honeymooners was Ralph actually threatening physical violence,

26
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,240
or that there were no Wailers on the Moon is met with annoyance.

27
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,680
"- Screw this phony stuff.

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,800
"- But the phony stuff is what's fun. It's boring out there."

29
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,360
People just want to take the park's attractions at face value

30
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,960
without thinking about the implications of this revised history and then go home.

31
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:59,280
"- One of these days, Alice. Bang! Zoom! Straight to the moon."

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,640
That's not an astronaut, it's a TV comedian.

33
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,080
And he was just using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife.

34
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,160
For the purposes of this essay, however, it's a pretty spot-on encapsulation of how people tend

35
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,000
to get kind of defensive whenever confronted with the idea that the past isn't as simple

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,120
or as pleasant as they might like to remember, but it's also a pretty spot-on parody of Walt Disney

37
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,440
World and its tendency to sprinkle pixie dust on, you know, everything.

38
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,160
The Disney approach to life, love, and history is a touch dated.

39
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,360
Magic wishes happily ever after, this has been at the core of the Disney brand for almost 90 years,

40
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,360
to the point where after decades of being one of the dominating creative forces in pop culture,

41
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,840
this ethos has inspired countless knockoffs, which is to say nothing of the countless parodies.

42
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,000
"- Do you not know that sucking my d*** is a serious offense? Punishable by f*** you!"

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,040
Think of how many movies, television shows, and media you've seen where

44
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,680
a character will look out into the middle distance, about to pour

45
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,040
open their hearts through song, and then someone grinds that moment to a halt.

46
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,760
"- Stop that! Stop that! You're not going into a song while I'm here."

47
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,040
Even Disney's in on it now.

48
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,440
"- Don't see. It's okay, you know? Let's just walk."

49
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,200
Part of the post Eisner rebranding we've seen is savvy to the fact that Disney's hopes,

50
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,520
dreams, and happily ever after message needs to be repackaged carefully to appeal to modern

51
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,480
audiences, even contextualized as necessary just to get by day to day on this miserable

52
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,840
dirt ball we call Earth.

53
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,920
Enchanted is explicitly about the balance between the naivete of the old Disney model

54
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,520
and the demands of the real world.

55
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,120
Frozen, Disney's most lucrative animated movie to date, has its whole

56
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,280
girl you can't marry a guy you just met bait and switch hammered in over.

57
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,440
"- You can't marry a man you just met. You can if it's true love."

58
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,320
And over.

59
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,680
"- You got engaged to someone you just met that day?"

60
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,360
Moana not only deconstructs the chosen one narrative but even features a character that

61
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,120
is basically every middle school edgelord trying to act like he still doesn't cry at Bambi.

62
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,440
"- The ocean chose you for a reason.

63
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,040
If you start singing, I'm gonna throw up."

64
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,200
Sincerity is for girls.

65
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,280
Even Tangled makes it clear that Rapunzel and Eugene wait a few years before they settle down.

66
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,200
"- Did Rapunzel and I ever get married?

67
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,520
And after years and years of asking and asking and asking,

68
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,600
I finally said yes."

69
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,160
No more of this three-day engagement nonsense.

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,240
And the weird thing is this meta examination of the Disney brand works.

71
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,520
People like it.

72
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,120
People will pay for Disney getting meta about Disney.

73
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,320
"- I'll be in my room.

74
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,080
Get your own movie."

75
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,960
So enter 2013's Saving Mr. Banks,

76
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,760
the most meta of the recent Disney trends of metatextual analyses within the Disney company,

77
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,680
as it is actually about the Disney ethos and how it Disney-fies everything it touches.

78
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,960
The studio, one of its most famous films, and Walt Disney himself,

79
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,520
as portrayed by America's favorite uncle, giver of good hugs, and David S. Pumpkins.

80
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,640
"- David S. Pumpkins!

81
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,560
Any questions?"

82
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,240
Tom Hanks.

83
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,880
On the surface, Saving Mr. Banks tells the true-ish story of P.L. Travers

84
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,560
and the culmination of her 20-year resistance to selling Walt Disney the rights

85
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,840
to adapt her beloved children's books, Mary Poppins.

86
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,120
Adapting these books had been Walt's passion project for decades.

87
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,680
"- But then she gave me one of your books and, oh, by gosh, my imagination caught on fire.

88
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,880
Absolutely on fire.

89
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,840
And those embers have burned ever since, as you know.

90
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,280
I do, yes.

91
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,320
20 years.

92
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,440
So you keep saying."

93
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,360
But Travers resists because she sees Disney movies as sentimental flim-flam.

94
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,160
"- Mary Poppins does not sing."

95
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,480
The making of Mary Poppins' narrative is interwoven throughout with flashbacks

96
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,080
to Travers' childhood, her relationship with her father, a loving charming man

97
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,520
who adored his daughter and also who happened to be a chronic alcoholic

98
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,040
and who died when she was seven.

99
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,000
The film is titled Saving Mr. Banks because much of the negotiations

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,440
between Travers and the Disney studios features a great deal of hand-rigging

101
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,680
over the Mary Poppins character of Mr. Banks.

102
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,320
"- I told the illustrator I did not like the facial hair,

103
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,440
but she chose to ignore me.

104
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,800
Now, this time around, this is my film and I shall have my way.

105
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,000
"- Mrs. Travers, this is a specific request from Walt."

106
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:10,880
"- Why?"

107
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,240
The film even goes so far as to imply that the reason Travers is so resistant

108
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,240
to giving Disney the rights is because she lacks closure over the death of her own father,

109
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,040
which is why it is so important for the emotional climax of Mary Poppins to be about Mr. Banks.

110
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,040
Yeah.

111
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,840
But this topic is fraught in a way that most biopics aren't

112
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,240
and people are less forgiving of creative liberties taken here

113
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,720
in the interest of creative a compelling narrative.

114
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,240
But Saving Mr. Banks's portrayal of Walt Disney as a shrewd businessman

115
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,080
but basically a nice guy, it's ruffled some feathers.

116
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,280
"- You know, there are all kinds of showmen and all kinds of show business,

117
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,680
but it's a fact that only one or two men are at the top in any given group."

118
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,720
This movie has been described as a piece of pro-Disney propaganda,

119
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,320
historical revisionism in and of itself, which, you know, well, it is.

120
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,480
"- That mouse is family."

121
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,760
And before you fill the comment section with diatribes

122
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,240
on how old Uncle Walt was a racist or an anti-Semite,

123
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,320
let's just say that is a discussion for another day.

124
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,920
A long one.

125
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,880
Check your sources.

126
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,640
So this movie was fraught not just because one of the main characters is Walt Disney.

127
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,560
"- Do you always get everything you want, Walter?

128
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,640
"- Pretty much."

129
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,600
Who is either the patron saint of all that is good and pure about humanity

130
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,080
or their very face of evil depending on who you ask,

131
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,320
but also because of the underlying theme of artistic integrity versus selling out.

132
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,640
And hey, maybe selling out is best for everyone, Pam.

133
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,640
That's right, you get in bed with the mouse, Pam.

134
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,240
"- Get in bed with the mouse."

135
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,840
But all that notwithstanding, I honestly feel like this movie is underrated.

136
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,920
The quality of the film gets buried by these comments that Walt was a very bad man

137
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,400
and the movie, of course, treats it as a given that he isn't.

138
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,760
For one, Saving Mr. Banks is the extremely rare father-daughter movie

139
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,880
that isn't tied into the daughter finding herself through marriage,

140
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,120
but is instead a broader journey about self-identity

141
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,120
that you see more often in father-son movies.

142
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,480
Emma Thompson does an amazing job being absolutely charming and relatable

143
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,800
despite being an abject, unequivocal jerk.

144
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,240
"- Will the child be a nuisance?

145
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,000
It's an 11-hour flight."

146
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,400
The Disney brand is so overwhelming and easy to dislike

147
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,880
and Disney himself is so shrewd and borderline phony

148
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,680
that even if you're in The Life as a Disney Stan,

149
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,760
you can still totally see where she's coming from.

150
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,840
Tom Hanks is, well, it's Tom Hanks.

151
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,080
"- I won't have her turned into one of your silly cartoons."

152
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,520
But as for the need to see Walt portrayed warts and all,

153
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,440
I can see the desire for that, but that was not this movie.

154
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,000
Mary Poppins is an interesting movie to make a making of movie about in general.

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,680
Not only was it a technological breakthrough

156
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,680
with the combination of live action and animation,

157
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,440
but it was also Disney's last great film passion project before he died.

158
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,760
Now, say what you want about old Uncle Walt, but the man was a capitalist.

159
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,720
So it's interesting that this was the project he was willing to go through

160
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,560
such great lengths to get the rights to,

161
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,360
as it is the only Disney-era movie that is at least socialism curious.

162
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,360
"- Please, may we feed the birds?

163
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,400
Whatever for?

164
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,160
I have tuppence from my money box.

165
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,760
Just this once, please.

166
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,920
Waste your money on a lot of ragamuffin birds?

167
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,640
Certainly not.

168
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,680
But I want to redistribute the wealth, father."

169
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,760
Mary Poppins is one of those antagonist-less kids movies,

170
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,600
but if there is a villain in Mary Poppins, then it is the bank.

171
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,280
"- No, not that stadium."

172
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,320
And I'm not normally a fan of dad-you-work-too-hard lessons in movies,

173
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,920
but I think it works in Mary Poppins

174
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,880
because of the way it satirizes the fragility of the bank system

175
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,600
and the way it ties in with Mr. Banks' skewed priorities.

176
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,440
"- And just how much money do you have, young man?

177
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,320
Tuppence, but I want it to feed the birds."

178
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,640
A kid who wants to feed the birds causes a bank run.

179
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,400
"- Give it back!

180
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,360
Give me back the money!"

181
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,000
The people shall cease the means of production!

182
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,200
Feed the birds!"

183
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,680
The biggest source of conflict in the Mary Poppins universe,

184
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,880
the Disney version anyway,

185
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,800
is how the obsession with money and prestige comes at the cost of being good parents.

186
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,200
And the irony of all of this, the parent storyline,

187
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,800
the socialism curiousness, the bank being evil,

188
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,080
aside from mentions of Mr. Banks being unhappy,

189
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,440
this whole storyline wasn't in the original book but added by Disney.

190
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,920
Part of this was to give the story a more film-like shape,

191
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,160
what with giving the characters more of an arc,

192
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,200
and part was to make it more relatable to families of the 1960s

193
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,640
who may not quite understand

194
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,000
why a family with a stay-at-home mother would even need a nanny

195
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,040
if she didn't have some, you know, hobby or activity to do all day,

196
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,440
which is actually addressed in Mr. Banks.

197
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,480
"- Why in the world have you made Mrs. Banks a silly suffragette?

198
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,360
I wonder if Emmeline P would agree with that adjective."

199
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,400
And the majority of the stuff that is changed from the source material,

200
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,000
that of giving the family itself an arc to rediscover itself and each other,

201
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,400
is really the biggest change from Travers' books

202
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,760
and ends up itself compromising most of the plot of saving Mr. Banks.

203
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,160
"- It does seem strange that Mrs. Banks allows her kids

204
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,600
to spend all of their time with the nanny when she doesn't have a job to speak."

205
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,000
The structural changes that Travers most resisted

206
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,520
ended up being kind of necessary to make it watchable as a feature film.

207
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,000
So that Mary Poppins exists at all is noteworthy

208
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,240
and the story of how it came to pass is compelling,

209
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,600
even if, shall we say, creative liberties were taken.

210
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,120
Yes, the film does ultimately come down favoring Walt's perspective.

211
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,120
One would struggle to say that it celebrates Travers' work more than it does Disney's.

212
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,040
"- The rain brings life.

213
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,240
So does the sun."

214
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,320
But on the whole, with the exception of this scene

215
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,720
where Disney and Travers have the daddy issues discussion...

216
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,880
"- It's not the children she comes to save.

217
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,680
It's their father.

218
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,800
It's your father."

219
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,880
The film does hue true-ish if you move some timeline elements and characters around.

220
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,960
Disney did travel to London to meet with Travers,

221
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,200
several times in fact, but it wasn't at the 11th hour

222
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,480
and probably didn't involve any stories about flawed tragic fathers.

223
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,560
"- You best be quick there, Walt.

224
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,200
You better get those newspapers up on that porch and under that storm door,

225
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,720
Poppins are gonna lose his temper again and show you the buckle end of his belt."

226
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,280
Disney's story about forced child labor is true,

227
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,920
but he never went on record to frame that as anything other than good, hard, honest American work.

228
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,480
Ralph the car driver and his disabled daughter didn't exist,

229
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,120
but he was a composite character of Disney Studios workers

230
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,960
who did befriend Travers during her stay.

231
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,440
There is no evidence that Travers danced and sang to Let's Go Fly a Kite,

232
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,480
but she did sing along to Feed the Birds on those tapes.

233
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,560
And yes, she did insist on those tapes.

234
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,400
"- No, no. That we cannot have. That would be quite un-English."

235
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,040
Disney did snub Travers an invitation to the film's premiere.

236
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,600
"- An easy decision for me, but you know what she's like.

237
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,400
We got press interviews, cameras."

238
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,360
And she did make a big stink about it and showed up just to spite him.

239
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,280
She did go to Disneyland and she hated it,

240
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,600
but Walt wasn't there and no carousels were written.

241
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,920
Walt wasn't even present during the two-week meeting.

242
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,120
He peaced out after day one because he got so frustrated with Travers

243
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,200
and then let the Sherman brothers deal with her.

244
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,520
"- Does it matter?

245
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,720
You can wait outside."

246
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,760
But for adaptational criticisms, more people had a beef with the idea

247
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,760
that P.L. Travers was ultimately happy with the film version of Mary Poppins.

248
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,560
Travers did cry at the premiere, but not because she was touched

249
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,120
or had gotten some sense of closure so much as from grief

250
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,640
that her beloved creation was no longer hers and never would be again.

251
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,920
But there is some truth to the idea that she eventually was okay with it,

252
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,520
again, if you stretch the timeline a bit.

253
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,080
In a 1977 interview, Travers remarked,

254
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,640
''I've seen it once or twice and I've learned to live with it.

255
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,960
It's glamorous and it's a good film on its own level,

256
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,040
but I don't think it is very like my books.''

257
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,200
Travers did not make peace with the film at the premiere,

258
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,160
but she did after a few decades,

259
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,080
admitting that there were parts of the movie she liked

260
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,120
and even incorporating ideas conceived by the Disney story department

261
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,680
into the final Mary Poppins novel in 1988.

262
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,720
It is true, however, that she never made peace with the dancing penguins.

263
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,280
"- Mrs. Travers, what has you so upset now?

264
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,960
Penguins.

265
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,560
Penguins have very much upset me, Mr. Disney."

266
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,520
Others have called the film a character assassination on Travers herself,

267
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,160
and the film kind of glosses over or wipes its hands

268
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,800
of some of P.L. Travers' less flattering personal histories.

269
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,400
"- You got kids?

270
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,760
No, well, not precisely."

271
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,120
We can touch on the ethics of portraying Travers as a frigid fuddy-duddy

272
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,800
who just needs to loosen up and sell out.

273
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,280
"- What is all this...

274
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,440
...jewelification?

275
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,560
If you so much as step one foot in here with that trolley, I shall scream.

276
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,120
One cannot live on cake alone.

277
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,520
I hope we crash."

278
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,120
But in terms of this story,

279
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,640
to put it diplomatically, Travers was not a good team player.

280
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,920
If the film softens Walt Disney, it softens Travers too.

281
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,000
But perhaps the most common complaint with the film

282
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,800
wasn't about Travers but the way it softens Walt's edges,

283
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,240
and that it definitely does.

284
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,600
"- You see how it goes up on the word down?

285
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,800
On the word down, it goes up.

286
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,440
It's ironic.

287
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,720
Well, forget ironic.

288
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,240
That's iconic.

289
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,080
I won't be able to stop singing that for weeks."

290
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,800
Walt was notoriously stingy with compliments and basically never gave them,

291
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,000
but here he is all,

292
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,120
"- Call me Walt.

293
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,680
Oh, Walt.

294
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,720
You gotta call me Walt.

295
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
Mr. Disney was an old man, isn't that right?

296
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,600
Absolutely, Walt."

297
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,400
and the loving and supportive patriarch to his staff.

298
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,200
As per Disney Studios decree, you never see Walt smoking,

299
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,320
but he does refer to it.

300
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,680
You see him putting out cigarettes,

301
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,960
and he is literally introduced with a sickly cough off-screen.

302
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,600
Don't smoke, kids.

303
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,320
"- But here's the thing.

304
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,240
Walt's flaws weren't what this movie was about.

305
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,920
I mean, did we really need a scene where he takes a break

306
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,040
from the filming of Mary Poppins to discuss the evils of communism?"

307
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,360
This movie is not about Walt Disney.

308
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,240
It is about the heartbreak of giving up one's own creative vision

309
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,160
and trusting a shameless capitalist with it.

310
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,920
It is about the argument of whether or not doing such a thing is for the greater good

311
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,920
and what that greater good even is.

312
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,520
Is it bringing happiness into the lives of all or is it to educate children?

313
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,800
"- Mary Poppins is the very enemy of whimsy and sentiment.

314
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,000
She's truthful.

315
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,360
She doesn't sugarcoat the darkness in the world that these children will

316
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,520
eventually inevitably come to know.

317
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,560
She prepares them for it.

318
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,920
She deals in honesty."

319
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,440
But most of all, it is about a woman's relationship to her long dead father

320
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,480
and about how our histories and families influence who we become

321
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,640
and how we frame our history and worldview.

322
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,440
It's about the conflict between two creative visions.

323
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,760
Do we view history through rose-tinted glasses

324
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,640
or do we always need to be honest about the cruelties of the world?

325
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,320
"- You've never been to Disneyland and that's the happiest place on Earth.

326
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,920
Mr. Disney, I cannot begin to tell you how uninterested,

327
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,960
no, positively sickened I am at the thought of visiting your dollar printing machine."

328
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,480
But given Disney's approach to the framing of culture and history,

329
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,200
you can see where Travers wouldn't be thrilled.

330
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,880
Disney movies and theme park attractions traditionally are less set in a culture

331
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,720
or place in history so much as a version of a culture or place in history.

332
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,000
A very Disney version.

333
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,240
Like Snow White is German inspired because the original fairy tale is German

334
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,040
and I guess there is some Snow White stuff in Germany and Epcot

335
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,080
but there's nothing really distinctively German about Disney's Snow White and Seven Dwarfs.

336
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,320
Or Beauty and the Beast which is set in France.

337
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,800
But not like anything resembling real France.

338
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,560
Like you see Beauty and the Beast and you're not like,

339
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,280
oh Beast and or his descendants are going to meet a grisly fate in a few years.

340
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,320
In quote South America, end quote,

341
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,080
we have the happy exploits of the three Caballeros and Saludos Amigos films.

342
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,760
The list goes on and on.

343
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,520
The Disney approach strips these tales and places down to broad cultural signifiers

344
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,680
that a Western audience would happily consume.

345
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,960
It gets rid of anything that could be considered too salacious for the Disney brand

346
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,120
and changes the setting so that you no longer think this is a French fairy tale

347
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,840
but instead this is a Disney fairy tale.

348
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,080
Part of Walt Disney's evil genius was the efficacy

349
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,160
with which he branded everything he produced as unmistakably Disney.

350
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,760
That was the business model in 1961 so you can see where Travers would assume

351
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,880
that this is what would happen to her beloved Mary Poppins.

352
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,600
I won't have her turned into one of your silly cartoons.

353
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,960
And she would be right.

354
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,920
Cultural appropriation and historical revisionism are kind of integral to the Disney brand

355
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,440
whether it's for narrative purposes or a meta comment

356
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,880
on how the Disney corporation is viewing or changing itself.

357
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,400
We could go down the rabbit hole of real world examples of historical revisionism

358
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,840
but thing is I promised myself I'd keep this video under an hour.

359
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
So let's look at Disney World attractions.

360
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,320
There isn't anything in Disney World that isn't portrayed through that very distinct Disney filter.

361
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,000
Main Street USA was designed to be a tribute to the hometown of Walt's childhood

362
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,640
but no one is going to deny that it's a highly whitewashed,

363
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,520
highly idealized version of the American small town.

364
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,960
But if you want some real honest to god Disney style historical revisionism

365
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,960
head on down to the hall of presidents.

366
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,920
I'd have gone inside but unfortunately the ride is shut down because the president is bad.

367
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,840
Sometimes Disney decides to update their attractions to changing sensitivities.

368
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,760
Pirates of the Caribbean has this segment which is presently called the Bride Auction

369
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,120
and will be replaced when the ride closes for maintenance in 2018.

370
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,800
It features wenches being sold as chattel.

371
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,200
All are tied up and some are crying.

372
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,440
Strike your colors you brazen wench.

373
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,240
No need to expose your superstructure.

374
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,760
Fun for the whole family.

375
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,240
But when the Disney company tries to respect that yeah maybe they should change some stuff

376
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,120
this is met with resistance.

377
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,440
And that is perhaps the problem with rooting so much of your brand in nostalgia.

378
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,640
Whenever you point out that maybe some parts of the thing you're consuming might be unethical

379
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,200
people take it as an assault on their childhood.

380
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,320
No what do you mean there were no whalers on the moon?

381
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,640
People who consume the Disneyfied version of history and culture on some level they know it's

382
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,840
false but there's something almost traumatic in pointing out that there might be something

383
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,400
immoral about this sort of historical revisionism.

384
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,800
Something that doesn't jive with our modern sensibilities or even

385
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,800
with the fun nature of what is otherwise a whimsical ride with no slavery.

386
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,880
So it's not always just the framing is the problem it's the audience.

387
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,200
Once you frame a history a culture or even a story in a certain way

388
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,520
it can be really hard to unframe it.

389
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,520
And the truth is Mary Poppins has become a Disney movie in the popular consciousness

390
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,400
much more than it is seen as a beloved series of children's books.

391
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,240
Lord of the Rings are still books first.

392
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,640
The Chronicles of Narnia are still books first.

393
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,800
But Mary Poppins is a Disney movie.

394
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,200
The main conflict of the film ultimately comes down between both people using a fictional

395
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,440
property as a means of reconciling their difficult memories of their fathers.

396
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,920
She wants to know why Mr. Banks has been given a mustache.

397
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,800
Oh I asked for that.

398
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,160
Yes they told her that but she wants to know why.

399
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,400
Because I asked for it.

400
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,920
Both Travers and Walt's narratives within the movie are shown as wrapped in an obsession

401
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,720
with preserving and mythologizing the memories of their fathers.

402
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,160
It ends up being the crucial similarity that they share with each other.

403
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,280
I have my own Mr. Banks.

404
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,440
And even if this scene didn't really happen, which it didn't,

405
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,560
there is a deep truth to the idea of the scene.

406
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:06,160
Rare is the day when I don't think about that eight-year-old boy delivering newspapers in

407
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,880
the snow and all the last Disney with that strap in his fist.

408
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,440
I'm tired of remembering it that way.

409
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,960
The fictional Walt of the scene knows and understands that his father was flawed and

410
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,000
even cruel.

411
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,720
He hasn't forgotten what's happened but it's better for him to focus on the positive

412
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,840
memories rather than the negative ones and this informs his worldview and his business.

413
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,720
We all have our sad tales but don't you want to finish the story?

414
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,120
Let it all go and have a life that isn't dictated by the past?

415
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,440
So while the scene might be totally bogus in terms of things that actually happened

416
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,240
in the real world, it does tap into why people love Disney's rose-colored filter.

417
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,320
Part of Disney's genius was commodifying the way people mythologized culture,

418
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,080
especially American culture.

419
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,560
He found a way to brand and sell it because here's the thing, historical contextualizing

420
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:03,200
and yes, revisionism, it's always kind of inevitable, especially in times of national

421
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,840
stress.

422
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,160
Sometimes this kind of identity-branded mythologizing can be about reclaiming former glory

423
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,080
and scapegoating the other, but Disney's brand of mythologizing was all about feeling

424
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,640
good about what you already had and ignoring the bad parts, whether that's the totality

425
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,000
of the story or not.

426
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,520
This film ultimately explores the very human desire to protect the memories of the people

427
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,080
we love, people and fictional characters.

428
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,280
Why did you have to make him so cruel?

429
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,880
He was not a monster.

430
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,120
Even if they aren't always happy memories.

431
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,640
Take this line right here.

432
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:39,120
Maybe not in life but in imagination because that's what we storytellers do.

433
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,320
We restore order with imagination.

434
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,720
We instill hope again and again and again.

435
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,400
This line seems almost a response to one of the longest running criticisms of Disney

436
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,440
storytelling, that it's soppy, that it whitewashes history and culture, but I like how the movie

437
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,080
pits it against what people actually do in real life.

438
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,520
It's not like Walt Disney invented this by any stretch of the imagination.

439
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,200
He just figured out really, really effectively how to sell it.

440
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,840
As Walt himself put it in one outburst,

441
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,520
I've worked my whole life to create the image of what Walt Disney is.

442
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,800
It's not me.

443
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,640
I smoke and I drink and all the things we don't want the public to know about.

444
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
And here's the problem with whalers on the moon.

445
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,600
If history, culture, and stories have been revised to fit a sanitized or outright false

446
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,280
narrative, the onus is on the consumer to, well...

447
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,720
Educate yourself!

448
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,560
And the truth is, most people won't.

449
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,000
It is kind of poetic that the linchpin of this movie, its emotional thesis,

450
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,480
is the least historically accurate thing in the movie.

451
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,920
And also a big reason why people feel kind of iffy about this movie because it reads

452
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,920
as propagandistic corporate apologia for giving up one's intellectual property for the greater

453
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,600
good of commodification and mass consumption, which, you know, it is.

454
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,040
And I feel like there is this sort of expectation where even if you so much as admit that,

455
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,680
you are therefore required to wholeheartedly condemn it.

456
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,000
And, well, I can't.

457
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,760
Because I think you can have that discussion over who owns ideas once they are out in the

458
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,520
public consciousness while still admitting that Mary Poppins, the movie,

459
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,400
even if it doesn't adhere to the books as much as Travers wanted...

460
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
That will be quite enough of that, thank you.

461
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,480
It's a net positive for the world.

462
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,920
And I'm glad it exists.

463
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,040
It's a great movie.

464
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,080
It holds up.

465
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,680
And even if corporate-approved Tom Hanks' movie Walt says that Mary Poppins is going

466
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,680
to make people happy while dollar signs literally spin out of his eyes,

467
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:26,560
just look at this three-year-old child on her Make-A-Wish trip to Disney World meeting Mary Poppins.

468
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,000
She watched her over and over again when she was in the hospital last year.

469
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,720
Just kept her going.

470
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,720
Sorry, there's something in my eye.

471
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,840
Life doesn't have a neat theme you can package into a two-hour movie,

472
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,320
but as humans, we crave narrative satisfaction with the stories that we tell.

473
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,400
So this movie can be both a borderline unethical treatise on how,

474
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,520
after being relentlessly ground down by a major studio,

475
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,800
selling your intellectual property to a large corporation can in some ways

476
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,280
work toward the greater good despite robbing you of autonomy over your own creation,

477
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,200
and it can be a thoughtful piece on the way we attach so much of our personal identity

478
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,440
to the fictions and histories we fabricate, and how difficult it can be to let that go.

479
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,000
It can be both.

480
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:39,680
It can be both.
