15680	19480	Of all modern treatises on historical revisionism and popular culture,
19480	23520	the greatest of the 20th century was the series has landed,
23520	26960	Futurama, episode 2 of season 1.
26960	28720	The second episode of Futurama,
28760	34160	the series has landed, takes place just after Fry has been unfrozen after a thousand years of cryogenic sleep,
34160	39080	and has not yet had time to acclimate to the shifted perspectives and priorities of the 31st century.
39080	44120	Now a delivery boy for an interplanetary delivery service, his first delivery is a trip to the moon.
44120	45520	"- So, where are we going anyway?
45520	47120	"- Nowhere special. The moon.
47120	49360	"- The moon? The moon? The moon moon?"
49360	54640	An exotic adventure for Fry, but a mundane trip to, well, Disney World for the rest of them.
54640	57360	"- Gah, it's the happiest place orbiting Earth."
57360	60560	The only thing worth visiting on the moon, in fact, is a chintzy theme park,
60560	62720	a very thinly veiled allegory for Disney,
62720	67760	and this very thinly veiled allegory to the Disney theme parks also does what Disney World does best.
67760	72000	"- No one knows where, when, or how man first landed on the moon,
72000	77360	but our fungineers think it might have happened something like this.
77360	79280	"- We're winners on the moon!"
79280	82560	Revise history and change it to suit the park's own needs,
82560	86480	which the park goers accept unquestioningly, but Fry knows to be inaccurate.
86480	90880	One of the park's signature rides is a Pirates of the Caribbean parody called Wailers on the Moon.
94880	99040	So pointing out that the line in The Honeymooners was Ralph actually threatening physical violence,
99040	102240	or that there were no Wailers on the Moon is met with annoyance.
102240	103680	"- Screw this phony stuff.
103680	106800	"- But the phony stuff is what's fun. It's boring out there."
106800	109360	People just want to take the park's attractions at face value
109360	112960	without thinking about the implications of this revised history and then go home.
113440	119280	"- One of these days, Alice. Bang! Zoom! Straight to the moon."
120000	122640	That's not an astronaut, it's a TV comedian.
122640	126080	And he was just using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife.
126080	130160	For the purposes of this essay, however, it's a pretty spot-on encapsulation of how people tend
130160	134000	to get kind of defensive whenever confronted with the idea that the past isn't as simple
134000	139120	or as pleasant as they might like to remember, but it's also a pretty spot-on parody of Walt Disney
139120	143440	World and its tendency to sprinkle pixie dust on, you know, everything.
145440	150160	The Disney approach to life, love, and history is a touch dated.
150160	155360	Magic wishes happily ever after, this has been at the core of the Disney brand for almost 90 years,
155360	159360	to the point where after decades of being one of the dominating creative forces in pop culture,
159360	163840	this ethos has inspired countless knockoffs, which is to say nothing of the countless parodies.
169440	174000	"- Do you not know that sucking my d*** is a serious offense? Punishable by f*** you!"
174000	177040	Think of how many movies, television shows, and media you've seen where
177040	179680	a character will look out into the middle distance, about to pour
179680	183040	open their hearts through song, and then someone grinds that moment to a halt.
183040	185760	"- Stop that! Stop that! You're not going into a song while I'm here."
185760	187040	Even Disney's in on it now.
189440	191440	"- Don't see. It's okay, you know? Let's just walk."
191440	195200	Part of the post Eisner rebranding we've seen is savvy to the fact that Disney's hopes,
195200	199520	dreams, and happily ever after message needs to be repackaged carefully to appeal to modern
199520	204480	audiences, even contextualized as necessary just to get by day to day on this miserable
204480	205840	dirt ball we call Earth.
205840	209920	Enchanted is explicitly about the balance between the naivete of the old Disney model
209920	211520	and the demands of the real world.
211520	215120	Frozen, Disney's most lucrative animated movie to date, has its whole
215120	219280	girl you can't marry a guy you just met bait and switch hammered in over.
219280	223440	"- You can't marry a man you just met. You can if it's true love."
223520	224320	And over.
224960	227680	"- You got engaged to someone you just met that day?"
227680	231360	Moana not only deconstructs the chosen one narrative but even features a character that
231360	235120	is basically every middle school edgelord trying to act like he still doesn't cry at Bambi.
235120	237440	"- The ocean chose you for a reason.
238720	241040	If you start singing, I'm gonna throw up."
241040	243200	Sincerity is for girls.
243200	247280	Even Tangled makes it clear that Rapunzel and Eugene wait a few years before they settle down.
247280	249200	"- Did Rapunzel and I ever get married?
249200	253520	And after years and years of asking and asking and asking,
255920	257600	I finally said yes."
257600	260160	No more of this three-day engagement nonsense.
260160	264240	And the weird thing is this meta examination of the Disney brand works.
264240	265520	People like it.
265520	269120	People will pay for Disney getting meta about Disney.
269120	270320	"- I'll be in my room.
272560	274080	Get your own movie."
274080	276960	So enter 2013's Saving Mr. Banks,
276960	281760	the most meta of the recent Disney trends of metatextual analyses within the Disney company,
281760	285680	as it is actually about the Disney ethos and how it Disney-fies everything it touches.
288720	292960	The studio, one of its most famous films, and Walt Disney himself,
292960	297520	as portrayed by America's favorite uncle, giver of good hugs, and David S. Pumpkins.
297520	300640	"- David S. Pumpkins!
301360	302560	Any questions?"
303200	304240	Tom Hanks.
304240	308880	On the surface, Saving Mr. Banks tells the true-ish story of P.L. Travers
308880	312560	and the culmination of her 20-year resistance to selling Walt Disney the rights
312560	315840	to adapt her beloved children's books, Mary Poppins.
315840	319120	Adapting these books had been Walt's passion project for decades.
319120	323680	"- But then she gave me one of your books and, oh, by gosh, my imagination caught on fire.
323680	324880	Absolutely on fire.
325440	327840	And those embers have burned ever since, as you know.
327840	329280	I do, yes.
329280	330320	20 years.
330320	331440	So you keep saying."
331440	335360	But Travers resists because she sees Disney movies as sentimental flim-flam.
335360	338160	"- Mary Poppins does not sing."
339120	342480	The making of Mary Poppins' narrative is interwoven throughout with flashbacks
342480	346080	to Travers' childhood, her relationship with her father, a loving charming man
346080	349520	who adored his daughter and also who happened to be a chronic alcoholic
349520	351040	and who died when she was seven.
351040	354000	The film is titled Saving Mr. Banks because much of the negotiations
354000	357440	between Travers and the Disney studios features a great deal of hand-rigging
357440	359680	over the Mary Poppins character of Mr. Banks.
359920	362320	"- I told the illustrator I did not like the facial hair,
362320	363440	but she chose to ignore me.
363440	366800	Now, this time around, this is my film and I shall have my way.
366800	370000	"- Mrs. Travers, this is a specific request from Walt."
370560	370880	"- Why?"
370880	374240	The film even goes so far as to imply that the reason Travers is so resistant
374240	378240	to giving Disney the rights is because she lacks closure over the death of her own father,
378240	383040	which is why it is so important for the emotional climax of Mary Poppins to be about Mr. Banks.
384320	385040	Yeah.
385040	387840	But this topic is fraught in a way that most biopics aren't
387840	390240	and people are less forgiving of creative liberties taken here
390240	392720	in the interest of creative a compelling narrative.
392720	396240	But Saving Mr. Banks's portrayal of Walt Disney as a shrewd businessman
396240	400080	but basically a nice guy, it's ruffled some feathers.
400080	403280	"- You know, there are all kinds of showmen and all kinds of show business,
403840	407680	but it's a fact that only one or two men are at the top in any given group."
407680	410720	This movie has been described as a piece of pro-Disney propaganda,
410720	414320	historical revisionism in and of itself, which, you know, well, it is.
414320	416480	"- That mouse is family."
421520	423760	And before you fill the comment section with diatribes
423760	426240	on how old Uncle Walt was a racist or an anti-Semite,
426240	428320	let's just say that is a discussion for another day.
428880	429920	A long one.
429920	430880	Check your sources.
430880	434640	So this movie was fraught not just because one of the main characters is Walt Disney.
434640	436560	"- Do you always get everything you want, Walter?
437760	438640	"- Pretty much."
438640	441600	Who is either the patron saint of all that is good and pure about humanity
441600	444080	or their very face of evil depending on who you ask,
444080	448320	but also because of the underlying theme of artistic integrity versus selling out.
448320	450640	And hey, maybe selling out is best for everyone, Pam.
450640	452640	That's right, you get in bed with the mouse, Pam.
452640	454240	"- Get in bed with the mouse."
454240	457840	But all that notwithstanding, I honestly feel like this movie is underrated.
457840	461920	The quality of the film gets buried by these comments that Walt was a very bad man
461920	464400	and the movie, of course, treats it as a given that he isn't.
464400	467760	For one, Saving Mr. Banks is the extremely rare father-daughter movie
467760	470880	that isn't tied into the daughter finding herself through marriage,
470880	473120	but is instead a broader journey about self-identity
473120	475120	that you see more often in father-son movies.
475120	478480	Emma Thompson does an amazing job being absolutely charming and relatable
478480	480800	despite being an abject, unequivocal jerk.
483120	484240	"- Will the child be a nuisance?
484800	486000	It's an 11-hour flight."
487440	490400	The Disney brand is so overwhelming and easy to dislike
490400	492880	and Disney himself is so shrewd and borderline phony
492880	495680	that even if you're in The Life as a Disney Stan,
495680	497760	you can still totally see where she's coming from.
497760	499840	Tom Hanks is, well, it's Tom Hanks.
499840	502080	"- I won't have her turned into one of your silly cartoons."
504720	507520	But as for the need to see Walt portrayed warts and all,
507520	511440	I can see the desire for that, but that was not this movie.
512160	516000	Mary Poppins is an interesting movie to make a making of movie about in general.
516000	517680	Not only was it a technological breakthrough
517680	519680	with the combination of live action and animation,
519680	523440	but it was also Disney's last great film passion project before he died.
523440	527760	Now, say what you want about old Uncle Walt, but the man was a capitalist.
527760	530720	So it's interesting that this was the project he was willing to go through
530720	532560	such great lengths to get the rights to,
532560	537360	as it is the only Disney-era movie that is at least socialism curious.
537360	539360	"- Please, may we feed the birds?
539360	540400	Whatever for?
540400	542160	I have tuppence from my money box.
542160	543760	Just this once, please.
543760	545920	Waste your money on a lot of ragamuffin birds?
545920	546640	Certainly not.
546640	549680	But I want to redistribute the wealth, father."
549680	553760	Mary Poppins is one of those antagonist-less kids movies,
553760	557600	but if there is a villain in Mary Poppins, then it is the bank.
557600	559280	"- No, not that stadium."
562960	566320	And I'm not normally a fan of dad-you-work-too-hard lessons in movies,
566320	567920	but I think it works in Mary Poppins
567920	570880	because of the way it satirizes the fragility of the bank system
570880	573600	and the way it ties in with Mr. Banks' skewed priorities.
573600	575440	"- And just how much money do you have, young man?
576080	578320	Tuppence, but I want it to feed the birds."
579360	582640	A kid who wants to feed the birds causes a bank run.
583280	584400	"- Give it back!
584400	585360	Give me back the money!"
585360	588000	The people shall cease the means of production!
588000	589200	Feed the birds!"
589200	591680	The biggest source of conflict in the Mary Poppins universe,
591680	592880	the Disney version anyway,
592880	596800	is how the obsession with money and prestige comes at the cost of being good parents.
596800	599200	And the irony of all of this, the parent storyline,
599200	602800	the socialism curiousness, the bank being evil,
603360	606080	aside from mentions of Mr. Banks being unhappy,
606080	609440	this whole storyline wasn't in the original book but added by Disney.
609440	611920	Part of this was to give the story a more film-like shape,
611920	614160	what with giving the characters more of an arc,
614160	617200	and part was to make it more relatable to families of the 1960s
617200	618640	who may not quite understand
618640	622000	why a family with a stay-at-home mother would even need a nanny
622000	627040	if she didn't have some, you know, hobby or activity to do all day,
627040	629440	which is actually addressed in Mr. Banks.
629440	632480	"- Why in the world have you made Mrs. Banks a silly suffragette?
632480	635360	I wonder if Emmeline P would agree with that adjective."
635360	638400	And the majority of the stuff that is changed from the source material,
638400	642000	that of giving the family itself an arc to rediscover itself and each other,
642000	644400	is really the biggest change from Travers' books
644400	647760	and ends up itself compromising most of the plot of saving Mr. Banks.
648480	652160	"- It does seem strange that Mrs. Banks allows her kids
652160	655600	to spend all of their time with the nanny when she doesn't have a job to speak."
655600	658000	The structural changes that Travers most resisted
658000	661520	ended up being kind of necessary to make it watchable as a feature film.
661520	664000	So that Mary Poppins exists at all is noteworthy
664000	666240	and the story of how it came to pass is compelling,
666240	669600	even if, shall we say, creative liberties were taken.
669600	673120	Yes, the film does ultimately come down favoring Walt's perspective.
673120	677120	One would struggle to say that it celebrates Travers' work more than it does Disney's.
677840	679040	"- The rain brings life.
683040	684240	So does the sun."
684240	686320	But on the whole, with the exception of this scene
686320	688720	where Disney and Travers have the daddy issues discussion...
688720	690880	"- It's not the children she comes to save.
692800	693680	It's their father.
697760	698800	It's your father."
698800	704880	The film does hue true-ish if you move some timeline elements and characters around.
704880	706960	Disney did travel to London to meet with Travers,
706960	709200	several times in fact, but it wasn't at the 11th hour
709200	712480	and probably didn't involve any stories about flawed tragic fathers.
713040	714560	"- You best be quick there, Walt.
714560	719200	You better get those newspapers up on that porch and under that storm door,
719200	722720	Poppins are gonna lose his temper again and show you the buckle end of his belt."
722720	725280	Disney's story about forced child labor is true,
725280	729920	but he never went on record to frame that as anything other than good, hard, honest American work.
729920	732480	Ralph the car driver and his disabled daughter didn't exist,
732480	735120	but he was a composite character of Disney Studios workers
735120	736960	who did befriend Travers during her stay.
738160	741440	There is no evidence that Travers danced and sang to Let's Go Fly a Kite,
741440	744480	but she did sing along to Feed the Birds on those tapes.
744480	746560	And yes, she did insist on those tapes.
746560	750400	"- No, no. That we cannot have. That would be quite un-English."
750400	753040	Disney did snub Travers an invitation to the film's premiere.
753280	755600	"- An easy decision for me, but you know what she's like.
756320	758400	We got press interviews, cameras."
758400	761360	And she did make a big stink about it and showed up just to spite him.
761360	763280	She did go to Disneyland and she hated it,
763280	765600	but Walt wasn't there and no carousels were written.
765600	767920	Walt wasn't even present during the two-week meeting.
767920	771120	He peaced out after day one because he got so frustrated with Travers
771120	773200	and then let the Sherman brothers deal with her.
773200	775520	"- Does it matter?
779280	780720	You can wait outside."
780720	783760	But for adaptational criticisms, more people had a beef with the idea
783760	787760	that P.L. Travers was ultimately happy with the film version of Mary Poppins.
787760	790560	Travers did cry at the premiere, but not because she was touched
790560	793120	or had gotten some sense of closure so much as from grief
793120	796640	that her beloved creation was no longer hers and never would be again.
796640	799920	But there is some truth to the idea that she eventually was okay with it,
799920	801520	again, if you stretch the timeline a bit.
801520	804080	In a 1977 interview, Travers remarked,
804080	806640	''I've seen it once or twice and I've learned to live with it.
806640	808960	It's glamorous and it's a good film on its own level,
808960	811040	but I don't think it is very like my books.''
811040	813200	Travers did not make peace with the film at the premiere,
813200	816160	but she did after a few decades,
816160	818080	admitting that there were parts of the movie she liked
818080	821120	and even incorporating ideas conceived by the Disney story department
821120	823680	into the final Mary Poppins novel in 1988.
823680	826720	It is true, however, that she never made peace with the dancing penguins.
826720	829280	"- Mrs. Travers, what has you so upset now?
830320	830960	Penguins.
832000	834560	Penguins have very much upset me, Mr. Disney."
834560	837520	Others have called the film a character assassination on Travers herself,
837520	840160	and the film kind of glosses over or wipes its hands
840160	842800	of some of P.L. Travers' less flattering personal histories.
843360	844400	"- You got kids?
844400	845760	No, well, not precisely."
845760	849120	We can touch on the ethics of portraying Travers as a frigid fuddy-duddy
849120	850800	who just needs to loosen up and sell out.
852000	853280	"- What is all this...
854240	855440	...jewelification?
855440	858560	If you so much as step one foot in here with that trolley, I shall scream.
859600	861120	One cannot live on cake alone.
861840	863520	I hope we crash."
863520	865120	But in terms of this story,
865120	868640	to put it diplomatically, Travers was not a good team player.
868640	871920	If the film softens Walt Disney, it softens Travers too.
871920	874000	But perhaps the most common complaint with the film
874000	876800	wasn't about Travers but the way it softens Walt's edges,
876800	878240	and that it definitely does.
878240	879600	"- You see how it goes up on the word down?
879600	880800	On the word down, it goes up.
880800	881440	It's ironic.
881440	882720	Well, forget ironic.
882720	884240	That's iconic.
884240	886080	I won't be able to stop singing that for weeks."
887360	890800	Walt was notoriously stingy with compliments and basically never gave them,
890800	892000	but here he is all,
892000	893120	"- Call me Walt.
893120	893680	Oh, Walt.
893680	894720	You gotta call me Walt.
894720	896720	Mr. Disney was an old man, isn't that right?
896720	897600	Absolutely, Walt."
897600	900400	and the loving and supportive patriarch to his staff.
900400	903200	As per Disney Studios decree, you never see Walt smoking,
903200	904320	but he does refer to it.
904320	905680	You see him putting out cigarettes,
905680	908960	and he is literally introduced with a sickly cough off-screen.
912560	913600	Don't smoke, kids.
913600	914320	"- But here's the thing.
915040	918240	Walt's flaws weren't what this movie was about.
918240	921920	I mean, did we really need a scene where he takes a break
921920	925040	from the filming of Mary Poppins to discuss the evils of communism?"
926720	929360	This movie is not about Walt Disney.
929360	932240	It is about the heartbreak of giving up one's own creative vision
932240	934160	and trusting a shameless capitalist with it.
934160	937920	It is about the argument of whether or not doing such a thing is for the greater good
937920	939920	and what that greater good even is.
939920	943520	Is it bringing happiness into the lives of all or is it to educate children?
943520	946800	"- Mary Poppins is the very enemy of whimsy and sentiment.
946800	948000	She's truthful.
948000	951360	She doesn't sugarcoat the darkness in the world that these children will
951360	953520	eventually inevitably come to know.
953520	954560	She prepares them for it.
954560	955920	She deals in honesty."
955920	959440	But most of all, it is about a woman's relationship to her long dead father
959440	962480	and about how our histories and families influence who we become
962480	964640	and how we frame our history and worldview.
964640	967440	It's about the conflict between two creative visions.
967440	969760	Do we view history through rose-tinted glasses
969760	972640	or do we always need to be honest about the cruelties of the world?
972640	976320	"- You've never been to Disneyland and that's the happiest place on Earth.
976320	979920	Mr. Disney, I cannot begin to tell you how uninterested,
979920	984960	no, positively sickened I am at the thought of visiting your dollar printing machine."
984960	988480	But given Disney's approach to the framing of culture and history,
988480	991200	you can see where Travers wouldn't be thrilled.
995200	998880	Disney movies and theme park attractions traditionally are less set in a culture
998880	1004720	or place in history so much as a version of a culture or place in history.
1004720	1006000	A very Disney version.
1008240	1012240	Like Snow White is German inspired because the original fairy tale is German
1012240	1015040	and I guess there is some Snow White stuff in Germany and Epcot
1015040	1020080	but there's nothing really distinctively German about Disney's Snow White and Seven Dwarfs.
1020080	1022320	Or Beauty and the Beast which is set in France.
1028080	1030800	But not like anything resembling real France.
1030800	1032560	Like you see Beauty and the Beast and you're not like,
1032560	1037280	oh Beast and or his descendants are going to meet a grisly fate in a few years.
1040640	1042320	In quote South America, end quote,
1042320	1046080	we have the happy exploits of the three Caballeros and Saludos Amigos films.
1046080	1047760	The list goes on and on.
1047760	1051520	The Disney approach strips these tales and places down to broad cultural signifiers
1051520	1053680	that a Western audience would happily consume.
1053680	1056960	It gets rid of anything that could be considered too salacious for the Disney brand
1056960	1061120	and changes the setting so that you no longer think this is a French fairy tale
1061120	1063840	but instead this is a Disney fairy tale.
1063840	1066080	Part of Walt Disney's evil genius was the efficacy
1066080	1070160	with which he branded everything he produced as unmistakably Disney.
1070160	1073760	That was the business model in 1961 so you can see where Travers would assume
1073760	1076880	that this is what would happen to her beloved Mary Poppins.
1076880	1079600	I won't have her turned into one of your silly cartoons.
1079600	1080960	And she would be right.
1080960	1085920	Cultural appropriation and historical revisionism are kind of integral to the Disney brand
1085920	1089440	whether it's for narrative purposes or a meta comment
1089440	1092880	on how the Disney corporation is viewing or changing itself.
1092880	1096400	We could go down the rabbit hole of real world examples of historical revisionism
1096400	1099840	but thing is I promised myself I'd keep this video under an hour.
1099840	1101840	So let's look at Disney World attractions.
1105760	1110320	There isn't anything in Disney World that isn't portrayed through that very distinct Disney filter.
1110320	1114000	Main Street USA was designed to be a tribute to the hometown of Walt's childhood
1114000	1116640	but no one is going to deny that it's a highly whitewashed,
1116640	1119520	highly idealized version of the American small town.
1119520	1122960	But if you want some real honest to god Disney style historical revisionism
1122960	1124960	head on down to the hall of presidents.
1124960	1131920	I'd have gone inside but unfortunately the ride is shut down because the president is bad.
1131920	1135840	Sometimes Disney decides to update their attractions to changing sensitivities.
1135840	1139760	Pirates of the Caribbean has this segment which is presently called the Bride Auction
1139760	1143120	and will be replaced when the ride closes for maintenance in 2018.
1143120	1146800	It features wenches being sold as chattel.
1146800	1149200	All are tied up and some are crying.
1149200	1151440	Strike your colors you brazen wench.
1151440	1154240	No need to expose your superstructure.
1154240	1155760	Fun for the whole family.
1155760	1160240	But when the Disney company tries to respect that yeah maybe they should change some stuff
1160240	1163120	this is met with resistance.
1163120	1167440	And that is perhaps the problem with rooting so much of your brand in nostalgia.
1167440	1172640	Whenever you point out that maybe some parts of the thing you're consuming might be unethical
1172720	1175200	people take it as an assault on their childhood.
1175200	1178320	No what do you mean there were no whalers on the moon?
1178320	1182640	People who consume the Disneyfied version of history and culture on some level they know it's
1182640	1185840	false but there's something almost traumatic in pointing out that there might be something
1185840	1188400	immoral about this sort of historical revisionism.
1188400	1190800	Something that doesn't jive with our modern sensibilities or even
1190800	1194800	with the fun nature of what is otherwise a whimsical ride with no slavery.
1194800	1198880	So it's not always just the framing is the problem it's the audience.
1198880	1203200	Once you frame a history a culture or even a story in a certain way
1203200	1205520	it can be really hard to unframe it.
1207760	1211520	And the truth is Mary Poppins has become a Disney movie in the popular consciousness
1211520	1214400	much more than it is seen as a beloved series of children's books.
1214400	1216240	Lord of the Rings are still books first.
1216240	1218640	The Chronicles of Narnia are still books first.
1218640	1220800	But Mary Poppins is a Disney movie.
1220800	1225200	The main conflict of the film ultimately comes down between both people using a fictional
1225200	1229440	property as a means of reconciling their difficult memories of their fathers.
1229440	1231920	She wants to know why Mr. Banks has been given a mustache.
1231920	1232800	Oh I asked for that.
1233360	1236160	Yes they told her that but she wants to know why.
1236720	1238400	Because I asked for it.
1238400	1241920	Both Travers and Walt's narratives within the movie are shown as wrapped in an obsession
1241920	1244720	with preserving and mythologizing the memories of their fathers.
1244720	1248160	It ends up being the crucial similarity that they share with each other.
1248160	1251280	I have my own Mr. Banks.
1252160	1255440	And even if this scene didn't really happen, which it didn't,
1255440	1258560	there is a deep truth to the idea of the scene.
1258560	1266160	Rare is the day when I don't think about that eight-year-old boy delivering newspapers in
1266160	1270880	the snow and all the last Disney with that strap in his fist.
1271760	1275440	I'm tired of remembering it that way.
1275440	1278960	The fictional Walt of the scene knows and understands that his father was flawed and
1278960	1280000	even cruel.
1280800	1284720	He hasn't forgotten what's happened but it's better for him to focus on the positive
1284720	1289840	memories rather than the negative ones and this informs his worldview and his business.
1289840	1294720	We all have our sad tales but don't you want to finish the story?
1295760	1299120	Let it all go and have a life that isn't dictated by the past?
1299920	1303440	So while the scene might be totally bogus in terms of things that actually happened
1303440	1308240	in the real world, it does tap into why people love Disney's rose-colored filter.
1308240	1312320	Part of Disney's genius was commodifying the way people mythologized culture,
1312320	1314080	especially American culture.
1314080	1318560	He found a way to brand and sell it because here's the thing, historical contextualizing
1318560	1323200	and yes, revisionism, it's always kind of inevitable, especially in times of national
1323200	1323840	stress.
1323840	1328160	Sometimes this kind of identity-branded mythologizing can be about reclaiming former glory
1328160	1332080	and scapegoating the other, but Disney's brand of mythologizing was all about feeling
1332080	1336640	good about what you already had and ignoring the bad parts, whether that's the totality
1336640	1338000	of the story or not.
1338000	1341520	This film ultimately explores the very human desire to protect the memories of the people
1341520	1344080	we love, people and fictional characters.
1344880	1347280	Why did you have to make him so cruel?
1347280	1348880	He was not a monster.
1348880	1351120	Even if they aren't always happy memories.
1351120	1352640	Take this line right here.
1352640	1359120	Maybe not in life but in imagination because that's what we storytellers do.
1360560	1362320	We restore order with imagination.
1362880	1366720	We instill hope again and again and again.
1366720	1370400	This line seems almost a response to one of the longest running criticisms of Disney
1370400	1375440	storytelling, that it's soppy, that it whitewashes history and culture, but I like how the movie
1375440	1378080	pits it against what people actually do in real life.
1378080	1381520	It's not like Walt Disney invented this by any stretch of the imagination.
1381520	1385200	He just figured out really, really effectively how to sell it.
1385760	1387840	As Walt himself put it in one outburst,
1387840	1391520	I've worked my whole life to create the image of what Walt Disney is.
1391520	1392800	It's not me.
1392800	1396640	I smoke and I drink and all the things we don't want the public to know about.
1396800	1398800	And here's the problem with whalers on the moon.
1398800	1403600	If history, culture, and stories have been revised to fit a sanitized or outright false
1403600	1407280	narrative, the onus is on the consumer to, well...
1407280	1408720	Educate yourself!
1408720	1410560	And the truth is, most people won't.
1410560	1414000	It is kind of poetic that the linchpin of this movie, its emotional thesis,
1414000	1416480	is the least historically accurate thing in the movie.
1416480	1419920	And also a big reason why people feel kind of iffy about this movie because it reads
1419920	1423920	as propagandistic corporate apologia for giving up one's intellectual property for the greater
1423920	1427600	good of commodification and mass consumption, which, you know, it is.
1427600	1431040	And I feel like there is this sort of expectation where even if you so much as admit that,
1431040	1433680	you are therefore required to wholeheartedly condemn it.
1434240	1436000	And, well, I can't.
1436000	1439760	Because I think you can have that discussion over who owns ideas once they are out in the
1439760	1443520	public consciousness while still admitting that Mary Poppins, the movie,
1443520	1446400	even if it doesn't adhere to the books as much as Travers wanted...
1446400	1448400	That will be quite enough of that, thank you.
1448400	1450480	It's a net positive for the world.
1450480	1451920	And I'm glad it exists.
1451920	1453040	It's a great movie.
1453040	1454080	It holds up.
1454080	1457680	And even if corporate-approved Tom Hanks' movie Walt says that Mary Poppins is going
1457680	1461680	to make people happy while dollar signs literally spin out of his eyes,
1461680	1466560	just look at this three-year-old child on her Make-A-Wish trip to Disney World meeting Mary Poppins.
1466560	1470000	She watched her over and over again when she was in the hospital last year.
1471440	1472720	Just kept her going.
1472720	1474720	Sorry, there's something in my eye.
1474720	1477840	Life doesn't have a neat theme you can package into a two-hour movie,
1477840	1482320	but as humans, we crave narrative satisfaction with the stories that we tell.
1482320	1486400	So this movie can be both a borderline unethical treatise on how,
1486400	1489520	after being relentlessly ground down by a major studio,
1489520	1492800	selling your intellectual property to a large corporation can in some ways
1492800	1497280	work toward the greater good despite robbing you of autonomy over your own creation,
1497280	1501200	and it can be a thoughtful piece on the way we attach so much of our personal identity
1501200	1505440	to the fictions and histories we fabricate, and how difficult it can be to let that go.
1509200	1510000	It can be both.
1512320	1539680	It can be both.
