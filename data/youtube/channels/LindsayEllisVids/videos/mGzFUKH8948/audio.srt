1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
The dog days of summer are upon us.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:14,760
So that means it's time for Corona Extra with lime, because that's how we roll.

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:22,800
Before you get all snobby on us, bear in mind, this is like the summer drink, if you don't

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
get it in your eye.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,520
Yeah, don't get the lime in your eye.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,880
So what's this I got in my hand, internet?

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,880
I don't know.

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,360
Could that be our letter of acceptance to some big publisher?

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,360
I don't know.

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:42,320
Let's drink before we find out.

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,640
I certainly haven't read this yet.

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,560
All right, so this is from Sterling Lord Literistic.

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,560
Wow.

14
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:56,760
This is one of the most prestigious and oldest literary agencies in New York City.

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,760
Well, go team.

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:07,400
And it says, Dear Sarah Ellinson of 1124 Generic Strassa Street.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,400
Strassa just Street.

18
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Generic Street.

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,000
I was just in Germany.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,280
She lives in Trotwood, Ohio.

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,280
I think that was Lisa's contribution.

22
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:22,560
It says, Dear Miss Ellinson, thank you for your query and interest in our representation.

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,840
I've had a chance to review Awoken, and though what you're attempting is very ambitious,

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm not certain that it works.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,520
Certainly the Elder Gods aspect is an interesting new angle for a paranormal romance, but I

26
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,760
feel that the characters are still lacking unique and dynamic voices.

27
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,560
At present, they appear to be rather one dimensional.

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,000
As a result, I fear this manuscript does not altogether work for me.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,360
Please remember that reactions to fiction are entirely subjective, so we recommend that

30
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,200
you try some other agents.

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,680
That was really nice of her.

32
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,680
That was very nice of her.

33
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,080
It's almost like she was in on the joke.

34
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:01,480
This is a really good example of the nicest, most helpful rejection letter you could possibly,

35
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,480
possibly hope for.

36
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:09,680
So yeah, this can go up on our wall of proud.

37
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:18,880
We got another rejection that was unfortunately not on a lovely printout with a company letterhead.

38
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,640
First off, it was the agent's assistant, and it was just like, sorry, this isn't for me.

39
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,000
Better luck next time.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,880
Which seems to be the more common form of rejection.

41
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
So short.

42
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,880
Short.

43
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
Yeah.

44
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,360
And I gotta be honest, I'm finding that even though it is like, the query is ridiculous,

45
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,400
and we will read it, not this episode, but another one, it's still kind of nerve-wracking

46
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,400
and it just kind of hurts your feelings, you know?

47
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,120
What do you mean you're injecting our magnum opus of Cthulian love?

48
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Do you know how many people it took to make this?

49
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,240
I feel like it's in the thousands by now.

50
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:07,840
But with these two rejections from literary agencies, I should also bring up the fact

51
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:15,160
that we did get some interest from an actual publisher, and this was kind of completely

52
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,160
out of the blue.

53
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,600
This was not something I reached out for.

54
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Someone messaged me.

55
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,240
I'm not going to mention the publisher by name, but it's a small, independent publisher

56
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:29,280
that specializes in science fiction, and one of their associate editors contacted me and

57
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,200
said, hey, I've been watching the show, maybe you want to send us your manuscript and see

58
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,960
if we might like to do something with it.

59
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:44,000
And so that brought up an interesting sort of dilemma, since we were sort of going on

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,480
the assumption that we were going to get rejected from everything because it's ridiculous.

61
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,520
And then we were going to self-publish it and continue this ruse of this fake author

62
00:03:53,520 --> 00:04:00,080
who lives in Truttwood, Ohio with her five children, Matt A., Matt B., Allison, Josh,

63
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,640
and Mary Ann.

64
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:10,840
And now it's like, well, this brings up an interesting little dilemma.

65
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,280
And that I think a lot of authors are struggling with right now, which is the question of traditional

66
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,920
publishing through an actual publisher versus self-publishing, which is easier now than

67
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:30,480
it has ever been in all of the history of the publishing.

68
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:37,280
So traditional publishing through a publisher, publishing house, agents probably involved.

69
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:44,040
Well, with those, there's often, what, the cash advance, there's people to actually help

70
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,640
you edit your novel, make it the best it can be in theory.

71
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,200
And also some marketing that I would think would go in it as well.

72
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,040
It kind of exists on a spectrum.

73
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,240
There are, I think the most common one is you publish with a traditional publisher and

74
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,360
they give you a cash advance and then after a certain amount of successful sales you start

75
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,640
to get residuals.

76
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,360
There are some, especially newer digital imprints that have no cash advance.

77
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,800
There are some that are residual only.

78
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,000
It's like a wide spectrum that kind of varies from the traditional Stephanie Meyer gets

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,680
an agent, agent finds a publisher, they publish it, she gets a seven-figure advance, I'm not

80
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
kidding.

81
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
Six-figure.

82
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,680
She was six-figure, not seven-figure, sorry.

83
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,640
But she apparently did get a six-figure advance for the Twilight series.

84
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,520
This does not happen anymore.

85
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,640
And then, of course, there's self-publishing.

86
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:56,960
Which is completely changing the paradigm, especially in light of our good friend E.L.

87
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,960
James here.

88
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:05,240
There are a lot of authors that did kind of start in this genre that we are exploring

89
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,320
slash parodying.

90
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,800
Amanda Hawking is one.

91
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm not familiar, I haven't read any of her stuff but I know she was very popular in Amazon.

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Colleen Hawke?

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,760
Hooke?

94
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,760
So it is changing the paradigm a little bit but I think in terms of the actual publishing

95
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,200
industry these people are extreme outliers.

96
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:36,000
The vast, vast, vast, vast, vast majority of people who self-publish will sell like

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,920
three and a half copies.

98
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:44,920
So the question is, what would be better for our Sarah Ellinson traditional publishing,

99
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:52,200
and we're not assuming that this publisher will like her masterpiece, which we did design

100
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,880
to be a very subtle parody.

101
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,360
It's not like a Harvard blampoon, you know?

102
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,280
Of course, there is a question of turnaround.

103
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
Yeah, exactly.

104
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,600
If we did go with a traditional publisher and if they did like it and they made us an

105
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,040
offer it would take at least a year for the public to see the light of day because we

106
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,760
have to do copy editing and then we have to do the early reviewers and the bookboggers

107
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:22,480
and then it's because publishing is like, the film industry is like a greyhound, publishing

108
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,320
is like a sloth on Xanax or something.

109
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,920
Now I mean you made the mention before of E.L.

110
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:35,600
James went very quickly from self-published to a smaller publishing company to Random

111
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
House.

112
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,680
Very fast turnaround and oh brother does it show.

113
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,040
The phrase, floor the pedal to the metal is in the final manuscript.

114
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,560
Floor the pedal to the metal, okay.

115
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,680
It's like someone gave it one more run through and was like, done.

116
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,240
Yeah, it's going to make us money, I don't care.

117
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,240
And it worked.

118
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,240
And it worked?

119
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Yeah, it worked.

120
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,680
There is that but there's also, if we did go with a traditional publisher we'd kind

121
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,600
of have to give up our ruse.

122
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,760
It would be harder, yeah, he would have to drop the Sarah Ellison.

123
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:13,320
Yeah, we would still use the pseudonym but there wouldn't be the ruse, we wouldn't have

124
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,320
our fake author getting in Facebook fights with reviewers that gave her a bad review,

125
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,520
which she totally would by the way.

126
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
She's that person.

127
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,640
We'd have to delete all the kid tweets.

128
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
Yeah, all the kids.

129
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,880
All the kids with their Twitter set up.

130
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,080
Which is the one with the Transformers jacket.

131
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,680
That's Josh.

132
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,240
And also we kind of have a leg up that other potential self-publishing authors might not

133
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,360
in that we have an audience.

134
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
You!

135
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,720
Viewers like you.

136
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,080
We have an audience that has been following this for months so obviously they're like

137
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,080
yeah we want it, we want it now, we want to see the horror.

138
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
Or hope that you don't.

139
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,400
Well, I mean, it is kind of a push-pull.

140
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:59,900
There is a lot of benefit to traditional publishing still, but you have complete creative control

141
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:04,360
over your own product and how you market it when you self-publish.

142
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,080
And also you get more money.

143
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,720
That is true.

144
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,320
Per unit sold.

145
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,280
Because honestly our plan had been if we do go the self-publishing route, like once we

146
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,680
get our stack of rejections, we would do that probably by the end of the summer.

147
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:24,480
But if, you know, it might be longer if the traditional publishing thing does happen.

148
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,640
We would have to sadly drop our ruse, but might end up with a better product, more interesting

149
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
product.

150
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,480
It is tempting, but it's so tempting.

151
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,120
Like if they show, like after they read it and they show that actual interest to be able

152
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,920
to say no, I'm a published author through an actual publisher.

153
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Yeah.

154
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,920
I mean, because there is still...

155
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
Me and seven other people.

156
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
There is still, absolutely.

157
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
Well, I mean, that's the thing.

158
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,800
There is still this idea that if you self-publish you are not really a writer.

159
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
You know, that you're...

160
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,560
And I think that will change because like blogging, like if you write for Jezebel, you

161
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,960
are a journalist now.

162
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,200
That wasn't the case five, ten years ago.

163
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
The paradigm is shifting.

164
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,240
It's just a question of how much and how fast.

165
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,320
And I think, but the other thing is like if they did make us an offer and we took it,

166
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,360
that would take some creative control away because, you know, obviously they'd want to

167
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
make changes.

168
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,360
They might want to push it.

169
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
I mean, what if they don't want to?

170
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,360
More in the parody direction.

171
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,880
There is a definite allure to both sides.

172
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:30,320
I look forward to seeing how it develops, a new, a challenger has arisen.

173
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,320
Yeah.

174
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
So that's where we stand.

175
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Thank you for sticking around this long.

176
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,800
As we have shopped it around.

177
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,440
We could maybe, after a couple weeks, release at least a part of it just so people will

178
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,160
know what it ended up being like.

179
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,680
Well, maybe like the first that we send for.

180
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,680
Of course.

181
00:10:50,680 --> 00:11:00,080
Once again, the Twitter, our author's Twitter, who might not end up being the thing.

182
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,960
I was really looking forward to her getting in fights with people who left bad reviews

183
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,960
on Goodreads.

184
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,160
Because I love it when people do that.

185
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,160
I'm watching you lesser known authors that get in fights with people who leave you bad

186
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
reviews on Goodreads.

187
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,440
Oh yeah, you are an inspiration to our non-existent authorists.
