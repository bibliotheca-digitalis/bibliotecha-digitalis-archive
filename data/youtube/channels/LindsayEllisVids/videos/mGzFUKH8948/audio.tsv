0	7040	The dog days of summer are upon us.
7040	14760	So that means it's time for Corona Extra with lime, because that's how we roll.
14760	22800	Before you get all snobby on us, bear in mind, this is like the summer drink, if you don't
22800	23800	get it in your eye.
23800	25520	Yeah, don't get the lime in your eye.
25520	29880	So what's this I got in my hand, internet?
29880	30880	I don't know.
30880	33360	Could that be our letter of acceptance to some big publisher?
33360	35360	I don't know.
35360	42320	Let's drink before we find out.
42320	44640	I certainly haven't read this yet.
44640	49560	All right, so this is from Sterling Lord Literistic.
49560	50560	Wow.
50560	56760	This is one of the most prestigious and oldest literary agencies in New York City.
56760	57760	Well, go team.
57760	67400	And it says, Dear Sarah Ellinson of 1124 Generic Strassa Street.
67400	69400	Strassa just Street.
69400	70400	Generic Street.
70400	73000	I was just in Germany.
73000	74280	She lives in Trotwood, Ohio.
74280	76280	I think that was Lisa's contribution.
76280	82560	It says, Dear Miss Ellinson, thank you for your query and interest in our representation.
82560	86840	I've had a chance to review Awoken, and though what you're attempting is very ambitious,
86920	89000	I'm not certain that it works.
89000	92520	Certainly the Elder Gods aspect is an interesting new angle for a paranormal romance, but I
92520	95760	feel that the characters are still lacking unique and dynamic voices.
95760	98560	At present, they appear to be rather one dimensional.
98560	102000	As a result, I fear this manuscript does not altogether work for me.
102000	105360	Please remember that reactions to fiction are entirely subjective, so we recommend that
105360	108200	you try some other agents.
108200	109680	That was really nice of her.
109680	110680	That was very nice of her.
110680	114080	It's almost like she was in on the joke.
114080	121480	This is a really good example of the nicest, most helpful rejection letter you could possibly,
121480	122480	possibly hope for.
122480	129680	So yeah, this can go up on our wall of proud.
129680	138880	We got another rejection that was unfortunately not on a lovely printout with a company letterhead.
138880	142640	First off, it was the agent's assistant, and it was just like, sorry, this isn't for me.
142640	144000	Better luck next time.
144000	148880	Which seems to be the more common form of rejection.
148880	149880	So short.
149880	150880	Short.
150880	151880	Yeah.
151880	157360	And I gotta be honest, I'm finding that even though it is like, the query is ridiculous,
157360	163400	and we will read it, not this episode, but another one, it's still kind of nerve-wracking
163400	166400	and it just kind of hurts your feelings, you know?
166400	171120	What do you mean you're injecting our magnum opus of Cthulian love?
171600	173600	Do you know how many people it took to make this?
173600	179240	I feel like it's in the thousands by now.
179240	187840	But with these two rejections from literary agencies, I should also bring up the fact
187840	195160	that we did get some interest from an actual publisher, and this was kind of completely
195160	196160	out of the blue.
196160	197600	This was not something I reached out for.
197600	198600	Someone messaged me.
198600	203240	I'm not going to mention the publisher by name, but it's a small, independent publisher
203240	209280	that specializes in science fiction, and one of their associate editors contacted me and
209280	213200	said, hey, I've been watching the show, maybe you want to send us your manuscript and see
213200	216960	if we might like to do something with it.
216960	224000	And so that brought up an interesting sort of dilemma, since we were sort of going on
224000	228480	the assumption that we were going to get rejected from everything because it's ridiculous.
228480	233520	And then we were going to self-publish it and continue this ruse of this fake author
233520	240080	who lives in Truttwood, Ohio with her five children, Matt A., Matt B., Allison, Josh,
240080	242640	and Mary Ann.
242640	250840	And now it's like, well, this brings up an interesting little dilemma.
250840	257280	And that I think a lot of authors are struggling with right now, which is the question of traditional
257280	262920	publishing through an actual publisher versus self-publishing, which is easier now than
262920	270480	it has ever been in all of the history of the publishing.
270480	277280	So traditional publishing through a publisher, publishing house, agents probably involved.
277280	284040	Well, with those, there's often, what, the cash advance, there's people to actually help
284040	289640	you edit your novel, make it the best it can be in theory.
289640	295200	And also some marketing that I would think would go in it as well.
295200	299040	It kind of exists on a spectrum.
299040	303240	There are, I think the most common one is you publish with a traditional publisher and
303240	308360	they give you a cash advance and then after a certain amount of successful sales you start
308360	310640	to get residuals.
310640	315360	There are some, especially newer digital imprints that have no cash advance.
315360	320800	There are some that are residual only.
320800	327000	It's like a wide spectrum that kind of varies from the traditional Stephanie Meyer gets
327000	331680	an agent, agent finds a publisher, they publish it, she gets a seven-figure advance, I'm not
331680	332680	kidding.
332680	333680	Six-figure.
333680	336680	She was six-figure, not seven-figure, sorry.
337240	340640	But she apparently did get a six-figure advance for the Twilight series.
340640	343520	This does not happen anymore.
343520	347640	And then, of course, there's self-publishing.
347640	356960	Which is completely changing the paradigm, especially in light of our good friend E.L.
356960	357960	James here.
357960	365240	There are a lot of authors that did kind of start in this genre that we are exploring
365320	367320	slash parodying.
367320	368800	Amanda Hawking is one.
368800	375000	I'm not familiar, I haven't read any of her stuff but I know she was very popular in Amazon.
375000	378000	Colleen Hawke?
378000	379760	Hooke?
379760	383760	So it is changing the paradigm a little bit but I think in terms of the actual publishing
383760	389200	industry these people are extreme outliers.
389200	396000	The vast, vast, vast, vast, vast majority of people who self-publish will sell like
396000	398920	three and a half copies.
398920	404920	So the question is, what would be better for our Sarah Ellinson traditional publishing,
404920	412200	and we're not assuming that this publisher will like her masterpiece, which we did design
412200	415880	to be a very subtle parody.
415880	418360	It's not like a Harvard blampoon, you know?
418360	421280	Of course, there is a question of turnaround.
421280	422280	Yeah, exactly.
422280	425600	If we did go with a traditional publisher and if they did like it and they made us an
425600	431040	offer it would take at least a year for the public to see the light of day because we
431040	436760	have to do copy editing and then we have to do the early reviewers and the bookboggers
436760	442480	and then it's because publishing is like, the film industry is like a greyhound, publishing
442480	446320	is like a sloth on Xanax or something.
446320	448920	Now I mean you made the mention before of E.L.
448920	455600	James went very quickly from self-published to a smaller publishing company to Random
455600	456600	House.
456600	461680	Very fast turnaround and oh brother does it show.
461680	468040	The phrase, floor the pedal to the metal is in the final manuscript.
468040	469560	Floor the pedal to the metal, okay.
470000	473680	It's like someone gave it one more run through and was like, done.
473680	475240	Yeah, it's going to make us money, I don't care.
475240	476240	And it worked.
476240	477240	And it worked?
477240	478240	Yeah, it worked.
478240	481680	There is that but there's also, if we did go with a traditional publisher we'd kind
481680	483600	of have to give up our ruse.
483600	486760	It would be harder, yeah, he would have to drop the Sarah Ellison.
486760	493320	Yeah, we would still use the pseudonym but there wouldn't be the ruse, we wouldn't have
493320	497320	our fake author getting in Facebook fights with reviewers that gave her a bad review,
497320	499520	which she totally would by the way.
499520	500520	She's that person.
500520	502640	We'd have to delete all the kid tweets.
502640	503640	Yeah, all the kids.
503640	505880	All the kids with their Twitter set up.
505880	509080	Which is the one with the Transformers jacket.
509080	510680	That's Josh.
510680	516240	And also we kind of have a leg up that other potential self-publishing authors might not
516240	518360	in that we have an audience.
518360	519360	You!
519360	521720	Viewers like you.
521720	525080	We have an audience that has been following this for months so obviously they're like
525080	527080	yeah we want it, we want it now, we want to see the horror.
527080	528080	Or hope that you don't.
528240	531400	Well, I mean, it is kind of a push-pull.
531400	539900	There is a lot of benefit to traditional publishing still, but you have complete creative control
539900	544360	over your own product and how you market it when you self-publish.
544360	546080	And also you get more money.
546080	547720	That is true.
547720	549320	Per unit sold.
549320	554280	Because honestly our plan had been if we do go the self-publishing route, like once we
554280	558680	get our stack of rejections, we would do that probably by the end of the summer.
558680	564480	But if, you know, it might be longer if the traditional publishing thing does happen.
564480	570640	We would have to sadly drop our ruse, but might end up with a better product, more interesting
570640	571640	product.
571640	573480	It is tempting, but it's so tempting.
573480	577120	Like if they show, like after they read it and they show that actual interest to be able
577120	580920	to say no, I'm a published author through an actual publisher.
580920	581920	Yeah.
581920	582920	I mean, because there is still...
582920	583920	Me and seven other people.
583920	584920	There is still, absolutely.
584920	585920	Well, I mean, that's the thing.
585920	591800	There is still this idea that if you self-publish you are not really a writer.
591800	592800	You know, that you're...
592800	597560	And I think that will change because like blogging, like if you write for Jezebel, you
597560	598960	are a journalist now.
598960	602200	That wasn't the case five, ten years ago.
602200	603200	The paradigm is shifting.
603200	607240	It's just a question of how much and how fast.
607240	612320	And I think, but the other thing is like if they did make us an offer and we took it,
612320	615360	that would take some creative control away because, you know, obviously they'd want to
615360	616360	make changes.
616360	617360	They might want to push it.
617360	618360	I mean, what if they don't want to?
618360	619360	More in the parody direction.
619360	622880	There is a definite allure to both sides.
622880	630320	I look forward to seeing how it develops, a new, a challenger has arisen.
630320	631320	Yeah.
631320	632320	So that's where we stand.
632400	634400	Thank you for sticking around this long.
634400	638800	As we have shopped it around.
638800	644440	We could maybe, after a couple weeks, release at least a part of it just so people will
644440	647160	know what it ended up being like.
647160	649680	Well, maybe like the first that we send for.
649680	650680	Of course.
650680	660080	Once again, the Twitter, our author's Twitter, who might not end up being the thing.
660120	663960	I was really looking forward to her getting in fights with people who left bad reviews
663960	664960	on Goodreads.
664960	667160	Because I love it when people do that.
667160	672160	I'm watching you lesser known authors that get in fights with people who leave you bad
672160	673160	reviews on Goodreads.
673160	676440	Oh yeah, you are an inspiration to our non-existent authorists.
