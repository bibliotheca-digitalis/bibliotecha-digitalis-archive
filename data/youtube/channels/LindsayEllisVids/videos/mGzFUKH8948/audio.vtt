00:00.000 --> 00:07.040
The dog days of summer are upon us.

00:07.040 --> 00:14.760
So that means it's time for Corona Extra with lime, because that's how we roll.

00:14.760 --> 00:22.800
Before you get all snobby on us, bear in mind, this is like the summer drink, if you don't

00:22.800 --> 00:23.800
get it in your eye.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.520
Yeah, don't get the lime in your eye.

00:25.520 --> 00:29.880
So what's this I got in my hand, internet?

00:29.880 --> 00:30.880
I don't know.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.360
Could that be our letter of acceptance to some big publisher?

00:33.360 --> 00:35.360
I don't know.

00:35.360 --> 00:42.320
Let's drink before we find out.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.640
I certainly haven't read this yet.

00:44.640 --> 00:49.560
All right, so this is from Sterling Lord Literistic.

00:49.560 --> 00:50.560
Wow.

00:50.560 --> 00:56.760
This is one of the most prestigious and oldest literary agencies in New York City.

00:56.760 --> 00:57.760
Well, go team.

00:57.760 --> 01:07.400
And it says, Dear Sarah Ellinson of 1124 Generic Strassa Street.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.400
Strassa just Street.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.400
Generic Street.

01:10.400 --> 01:13.000
I was just in Germany.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.280
She lives in Trotwood, Ohio.

01:14.280 --> 01:16.280
I think that was Lisa's contribution.

01:16.280 --> 01:22.560
It says, Dear Miss Ellinson, thank you for your query and interest in our representation.

01:22.560 --> 01:26.840
I've had a chance to review Awoken, and though what you're attempting is very ambitious,

01:26.920 --> 01:29.000
I'm not certain that it works.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.520
Certainly the Elder Gods aspect is an interesting new angle for a paranormal romance, but I

01:32.520 --> 01:35.760
feel that the characters are still lacking unique and dynamic voices.

01:35.760 --> 01:38.560
At present, they appear to be rather one dimensional.

01:38.560 --> 01:42.000
As a result, I fear this manuscript does not altogether work for me.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.360
Please remember that reactions to fiction are entirely subjective, so we recommend that

01:45.360 --> 01:48.200
you try some other agents.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.680
That was really nice of her.

01:49.680 --> 01:50.680
That was very nice of her.

01:50.680 --> 01:54.080
It's almost like she was in on the joke.

01:54.080 --> 02:01.480
This is a really good example of the nicest, most helpful rejection letter you could possibly,

02:01.480 --> 02:02.480
possibly hope for.

02:02.480 --> 02:09.680
So yeah, this can go up on our wall of proud.

02:09.680 --> 02:18.880
We got another rejection that was unfortunately not on a lovely printout with a company letterhead.

02:18.880 --> 02:22.640
First off, it was the agent's assistant, and it was just like, sorry, this isn't for me.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.000
Better luck next time.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.880
Which seems to be the more common form of rejection.

02:28.880 --> 02:29.880
So short.

02:29.880 --> 02:30.880
Short.

02:30.880 --> 02:31.880
Yeah.

02:31.880 --> 02:37.360
And I gotta be honest, I'm finding that even though it is like, the query is ridiculous,

02:37.360 --> 02:43.400
and we will read it, not this episode, but another one, it's still kind of nerve-wracking

02:43.400 --> 02:46.400
and it just kind of hurts your feelings, you know?

02:46.400 --> 02:51.120
What do you mean you're injecting our magnum opus of Cthulian love?

02:51.600 --> 02:53.600
Do you know how many people it took to make this?

02:53.600 --> 02:59.240
I feel like it's in the thousands by now.

02:59.240 --> 03:07.840
But with these two rejections from literary agencies, I should also bring up the fact

03:07.840 --> 03:15.160
that we did get some interest from an actual publisher, and this was kind of completely

03:15.160 --> 03:16.160
out of the blue.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.600
This was not something I reached out for.

03:17.600 --> 03:18.600
Someone messaged me.

03:18.600 --> 03:23.240
I'm not going to mention the publisher by name, but it's a small, independent publisher

03:23.240 --> 03:29.280
that specializes in science fiction, and one of their associate editors contacted me and

03:29.280 --> 03:33.200
said, hey, I've been watching the show, maybe you want to send us your manuscript and see

03:33.200 --> 03:36.960
if we might like to do something with it.

03:36.960 --> 03:44.000
And so that brought up an interesting sort of dilemma, since we were sort of going on

03:44.000 --> 03:48.480
the assumption that we were going to get rejected from everything because it's ridiculous.

03:48.480 --> 03:53.520
And then we were going to self-publish it and continue this ruse of this fake author

03:53.520 --> 04:00.080
who lives in Truttwood, Ohio with her five children, Matt A., Matt B., Allison, Josh,

04:00.080 --> 04:02.640
and Mary Ann.

04:02.640 --> 04:10.840
And now it's like, well, this brings up an interesting little dilemma.

04:10.840 --> 04:17.280
And that I think a lot of authors are struggling with right now, which is the question of traditional

04:17.280 --> 04:22.920
publishing through an actual publisher versus self-publishing, which is easier now than

04:22.920 --> 04:30.480
it has ever been in all of the history of the publishing.

04:30.480 --> 04:37.280
So traditional publishing through a publisher, publishing house, agents probably involved.

04:37.280 --> 04:44.040
Well, with those, there's often, what, the cash advance, there's people to actually help

04:44.040 --> 04:49.640
you edit your novel, make it the best it can be in theory.

04:49.640 --> 04:55.200
And also some marketing that I would think would go in it as well.

04:55.200 --> 04:59.040
It kind of exists on a spectrum.

04:59.040 --> 05:03.240
There are, I think the most common one is you publish with a traditional publisher and

05:03.240 --> 05:08.360
they give you a cash advance and then after a certain amount of successful sales you start

05:08.360 --> 05:10.640
to get residuals.

05:10.640 --> 05:15.360
There are some, especially newer digital imprints that have no cash advance.

05:15.360 --> 05:20.800
There are some that are residual only.

05:20.800 --> 05:27.000
It's like a wide spectrum that kind of varies from the traditional Stephanie Meyer gets

05:27.000 --> 05:31.680
an agent, agent finds a publisher, they publish it, she gets a seven-figure advance, I'm not

05:31.680 --> 05:32.680
kidding.

05:32.680 --> 05:33.680
Six-figure.

05:33.680 --> 05:36.680
She was six-figure, not seven-figure, sorry.

05:37.240 --> 05:40.640
But she apparently did get a six-figure advance for the Twilight series.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.520
This does not happen anymore.

05:43.520 --> 05:47.640
And then, of course, there's self-publishing.

05:47.640 --> 05:56.960
Which is completely changing the paradigm, especially in light of our good friend E.L.

05:56.960 --> 05:57.960
James here.

05:57.960 --> 06:05.240
There are a lot of authors that did kind of start in this genre that we are exploring

06:05.320 --> 06:07.320
slash parodying.

06:07.320 --> 06:08.800
Amanda Hawking is one.

06:08.800 --> 06:15.000
I'm not familiar, I haven't read any of her stuff but I know she was very popular in Amazon.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Colleen Hawke?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.760
Hooke?

06:19.760 --> 06:23.760
So it is changing the paradigm a little bit but I think in terms of the actual publishing

06:23.760 --> 06:29.200
industry these people are extreme outliers.

06:29.200 --> 06:36.000
The vast, vast, vast, vast, vast majority of people who self-publish will sell like

06:36.000 --> 06:38.920
three and a half copies.

06:38.920 --> 06:44.920
So the question is, what would be better for our Sarah Ellinson traditional publishing,

06:44.920 --> 06:52.200
and we're not assuming that this publisher will like her masterpiece, which we did design

06:52.200 --> 06:55.880
to be a very subtle parody.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.360
It's not like a Harvard blampoon, you know?

06:58.360 --> 07:01.280
Of course, there is a question of turnaround.

07:01.280 --> 07:02.280
Yeah, exactly.

07:02.280 --> 07:05.600
If we did go with a traditional publisher and if they did like it and they made us an

07:05.600 --> 07:11.040
offer it would take at least a year for the public to see the light of day because we

07:11.040 --> 07:16.760
have to do copy editing and then we have to do the early reviewers and the bookboggers

07:16.760 --> 07:22.480
and then it's because publishing is like, the film industry is like a greyhound, publishing

07:22.480 --> 07:26.320
is like a sloth on Xanax or something.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.920
Now I mean you made the mention before of E.L.

07:28.920 --> 07:35.600
James went very quickly from self-published to a smaller publishing company to Random

07:35.600 --> 07:36.600
House.

07:36.600 --> 07:41.680
Very fast turnaround and oh brother does it show.

07:41.680 --> 07:48.040
The phrase, floor the pedal to the metal is in the final manuscript.

07:48.040 --> 07:49.560
Floor the pedal to the metal, okay.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.680
It's like someone gave it one more run through and was like, done.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.240
Yeah, it's going to make us money, I don't care.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.240
And it worked.

07:56.240 --> 07:57.240
And it worked?

07:57.240 --> 07:58.240
Yeah, it worked.

07:58.240 --> 08:01.680
There is that but there's also, if we did go with a traditional publisher we'd kind

08:01.680 --> 08:03.600
of have to give up our ruse.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.760
It would be harder, yeah, he would have to drop the Sarah Ellison.

08:06.760 --> 08:13.320
Yeah, we would still use the pseudonym but there wouldn't be the ruse, we wouldn't have

08:13.320 --> 08:17.320
our fake author getting in Facebook fights with reviewers that gave her a bad review,

08:17.320 --> 08:19.520
which she totally would by the way.

08:19.520 --> 08:20.520
She's that person.

08:20.520 --> 08:22.640
We'd have to delete all the kid tweets.

08:22.640 --> 08:23.640
Yeah, all the kids.

08:23.640 --> 08:25.880
All the kids with their Twitter set up.

08:25.880 --> 08:29.080
Which is the one with the Transformers jacket.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.680
That's Josh.

08:30.680 --> 08:36.240
And also we kind of have a leg up that other potential self-publishing authors might not

08:36.240 --> 08:38.360
in that we have an audience.

08:38.360 --> 08:39.360
You!

08:39.360 --> 08:41.720
Viewers like you.

08:41.720 --> 08:45.080
We have an audience that has been following this for months so obviously they're like

08:45.080 --> 08:47.080
yeah we want it, we want it now, we want to see the horror.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.080
Or hope that you don't.

08:48.240 --> 08:51.400
Well, I mean, it is kind of a push-pull.

08:51.400 --> 08:59.900
There is a lot of benefit to traditional publishing still, but you have complete creative control

08:59.900 --> 09:04.360
over your own product and how you market it when you self-publish.

09:04.360 --> 09:06.080
And also you get more money.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.720
That is true.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.320
Per unit sold.

09:09.320 --> 09:14.280
Because honestly our plan had been if we do go the self-publishing route, like once we

09:14.280 --> 09:18.680
get our stack of rejections, we would do that probably by the end of the summer.

09:18.680 --> 09:24.480
But if, you know, it might be longer if the traditional publishing thing does happen.

09:24.480 --> 09:30.640
We would have to sadly drop our ruse, but might end up with a better product, more interesting

09:30.640 --> 09:31.640
product.

09:31.640 --> 09:33.480
It is tempting, but it's so tempting.

09:33.480 --> 09:37.120
Like if they show, like after they read it and they show that actual interest to be able

09:37.120 --> 09:40.920
to say no, I'm a published author through an actual publisher.

09:40.920 --> 09:41.920
Yeah.

09:41.920 --> 09:42.920
I mean, because there is still...

09:42.920 --> 09:43.920
Me and seven other people.

09:43.920 --> 09:44.920
There is still, absolutely.

09:44.920 --> 09:45.920
Well, I mean, that's the thing.

09:45.920 --> 09:51.800
There is still this idea that if you self-publish you are not really a writer.

09:51.800 --> 09:52.800
You know, that you're...

09:52.800 --> 09:57.560
And I think that will change because like blogging, like if you write for Jezebel, you

09:57.560 --> 09:58.960
are a journalist now.

09:58.960 --> 10:02.200
That wasn't the case five, ten years ago.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.200
The paradigm is shifting.

10:03.200 --> 10:07.240
It's just a question of how much and how fast.

10:07.240 --> 10:12.320
And I think, but the other thing is like if they did make us an offer and we took it,

10:12.320 --> 10:15.360
that would take some creative control away because, you know, obviously they'd want to

10:15.360 --> 10:16.360
make changes.

10:16.360 --> 10:17.360
They might want to push it.

10:17.360 --> 10:18.360
I mean, what if they don't want to?

10:18.360 --> 10:19.360
More in the parody direction.

10:19.360 --> 10:22.880
There is a definite allure to both sides.

10:22.880 --> 10:30.320
I look forward to seeing how it develops, a new, a challenger has arisen.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.320
Yeah.

10:31.320 --> 10:32.320
So that's where we stand.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.400
Thank you for sticking around this long.

10:34.400 --> 10:38.800
As we have shopped it around.

10:38.800 --> 10:44.440
We could maybe, after a couple weeks, release at least a part of it just so people will

10:44.440 --> 10:47.160
know what it ended up being like.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.680
Well, maybe like the first that we send for.

10:49.680 --> 10:50.680
Of course.

10:50.680 --> 11:00.080
Once again, the Twitter, our author's Twitter, who might not end up being the thing.

11:00.120 --> 11:03.960
I was really looking forward to her getting in fights with people who left bad reviews

11:03.960 --> 11:04.960
on Goodreads.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.160
Because I love it when people do that.

11:07.160 --> 11:12.160
I'm watching you lesser known authors that get in fights with people who leave you bad

11:12.160 --> 11:13.160
reviews on Goodreads.

11:13.160 --> 11:16.440
Oh yeah, you are an inspiration to our non-existent authorists.
