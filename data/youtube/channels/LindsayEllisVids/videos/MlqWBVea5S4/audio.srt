1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Like, a little refinement of the nose.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,320
What's wrong with my nose? Do I look like a Jew?

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,320
No, ma'am. Not at all.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,320
Phew!

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,320
Borat's subsequent movie film,

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,600
delivery of prodigious bribe to American regime for make-benefit once-glorious nation of Kazakhstan,

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,840
is a superior film to its predecessor by basically every metric.

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,560
Every scene in the film drives the plot forward or builds character,

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,000
and it also actually has an emotional core with stakes.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,640
The same can't really be said about the first film, where Borat's mission is just to, you know,

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,680
hang out and eventually he decides to kidnap Pamela Anderson.

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,000
For the first time in my life, I was in love.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,240
The second film not only centers on the relationship between Borat and his daughter,

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,560
it also actually has stakes. If he fails in his mission, he will be execute.

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:57,280
If you do not deliver a bribe to get me into strongman club, you will be execute.

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,840
It's no secret that Borat 1 was cobbled together in the edit, and the same holds true of the sequel.

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,960
Walla Walla!

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,280
But the filmmakers actually set out with an emotional core to the film and worked around that.

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,960
But the remarkable thing to me isn't that the film has a much more cohesive structure,

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,960
but rather that the joke itself hasn't aged poorly in the way that so much mid-2000s comedy has.

21
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,480
And now, girls jumping on trampolines!

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,960
Now, as to whether or not Borat's 1 or 2 can be considered problematic...

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,440
I could not concentrate on what this old man was saying.

24
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,040
...is up for some debate. I think it's a fair question to ask how much Borat,

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,640
the lovable anti-Semite, helped to normalize ironic anti-Semitism in the way that South Park did.

26
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,080
Oh yeah? Well, you're a stupid Jew!

27
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,880
You're a Jew!

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,400
Such a goddamn Jew, Matt!

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,600
And ironic anti-Semitism has been the biggest gateway for actual anti-Semitism in this last

30
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,960
decade, giving us a renaissance which we are presently living through.

31
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:02,160
Kazakhstan, glorious country. It have a problem, too. Economic, social, and Jew.

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,120
And I'm not really in a position to say that he's, you know,

33
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,120
Jew-ing wrong. Like Mel Brooks, he is a polarizing figure within the Jewish community.

34
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:15,440
At times, some critics have said my comedy risks reinforcing old stereotypes.

35
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,760
But anyway, my thought when I first saw ads for the second Borat movie was to compare it to

36
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,840
similar mid-2000s humor that I think on the whole has aged very poorly.

37
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,960
So the method of coping with the state of the world back in 2006

38
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,800
was to kind of act above it all, even when dealing with injustices.

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,800
This guy does the best Ali G impersonation. I? I can't do it. Go on.

40
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,200
I don't.

41
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,400
Matt Stone and Trey Parker spent the whole 2000s explaining that things were fine, actually.

42
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,440
Both sides bad.

43
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,480
Welcome to the cable access televised debate between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.

44
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,680
Avenue Q reassures us that things are only for now.

45
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,800
And then there's Borat.

46
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:01,360
This why Ministry of Information have decide to send me to U.S. and A,

47
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,040
greatest country in the world.

48
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,320
Borat's subsequent movie film is less comparable to Borat than it is to Fahrenheit 9-11.

49
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,280
Borat's subsequent movie film is much more shrewd in its target,

50
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,360
more overt with its politics.

51
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,680
And the first one was still pretty overt.

52
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,240
And it even ends with a call to action to vote,

53
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,360
leaving people who were apparently oblivious to the political undertones

54
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,720
that were always present in Borat confused and upset.

55
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,480
It seems obvious to state out loud, but Borat was always political.

56
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,760
The film spends a lot of time exposing American jingoism,

57
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,920
tricking people into exposing their bigotries or their indifference to bigotry.

58
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,680
Come on and make my day, Jew.

59
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,720
But Borat isn't meant to be political in the way that

60
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,320
Sacha Baron Cohen's later project, Who Is America, is.

61
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,960
If you want to win, you show some skin.

62
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,480
Okay.

63
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,440
Okay, show it to me.

64
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,280
Cohen's earlier characters were more cringe comedy that sometimes excel at being political.

65
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,560
In terms of early Borat, what most people tend to think of is the scene from The Ali G Show

66
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,440
in which he sings a song called In My Country There Is Problem, which features the lyrics.

67
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,400
And from Borat the movie, you have memorable scenes like these frat guys.

68
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,880
But that sort of thing actually doesn't take up that much runtime of the first film.

69
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,160
Mostly it's this sort of thing.

70
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,240
So Cohen uses this lovable anti-semitic buffoon.

71
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,440
The people he's talking to think he's at best a malleable knife and at worst barely human.

72
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,240
They let their guards down enough to say some truly heinous things.

73
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,000
Borat gets people to say the quiet part loud.

74
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,040
Shave that dead gum mustache off so you're not so conspicuous.

75
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,200
So you look like maybe an Italian.

76
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,880
So the thing that struck me about Borat's subsequent movie film was that the movie

77
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,040
uses almost the exact same shtick as the now 14-year-old first movie.

78
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,760
But that shtick rang very different then than it does today.

79
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,280
And I think what kind of really struck me in a horrible way was that

80
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,840
it's not even that the bit didn't age poorly,

81
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,040
it's that it actually works better in 2020 than it did in 2006.

82
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,720
And I think that's because Borat finally figured out his sense of purpose.

83
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,320
We are part of the global community influencing elections around the world.

84
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,520
Borat falls within this sort of prank reality tv genre

85
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,080
that was really huge in the late 90s and 2000s.

86
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,840
I'm following you.

87
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,680
I just went in a drugstore and bought some condoms.

88
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,440
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

89
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,480
You have shows like the Tom Green show, Boiling Point,

90
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,120
Crank Yankers, Trigger Happy TV,

91
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,240
and Ashton Kutcher's Punch ran for 11 seasons.

92
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,800
And most of these shows are primarily run on the premise of

93
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,520
annoying slash scaring people to get a response.

94
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,520
Whether it's shows like Sci-Fi Scare Tactics,

95
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,600
wherein people are unknowingly placed in premises

96
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,840
that mimic scenarios from horror films,

97
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,880
or stupid shtick like this from Crank Yankers.

98
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,880
I got mail, I got mail, I got mail, I got mail.

99
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,040
And of course there was Tom Green.

100
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,000
So to show my parents how much I love them,

101
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,320
I've turned my parents' vehicle into more than just a vehicle.

102
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,760
Dad can't take the bus to work,

103
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,920
I'm gonna take the slut mobile to the bus stop.

104
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,440
Wow, there's a lot of people at the bus stop.

105
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,080
I hope my dad's not embarrassed by his slut mobile.

106
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,680
But the difference between this stuff

107
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,360
and what Sacha Baron Cohen was doing

108
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,360
was Cohen's material had a more political edge.

109
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,520
So which is the party of the homosexuals?

110
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,360
They tend to go to the Democratic Party.

111
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
So let's look at a quick history of Borat.

112
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,600
Earlier iterations manifested in characters

113
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,920
like Alexei Krikler from Moldova,

114
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,360
and for a while Cohen had a character named Christo in the 90s.

115
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,040
She wears too many clothes.

116
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,160
But after 9-11, he evolved into Borat,

117
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,640
and this Eastern European goon got folded

118
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,880
into the Muslim world with Kazakhstan,

119
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,560
having elements of Eastern Europe,

120
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,320
that former Soviet aesthetic,

121
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,000
and being a Muslim-majority country.

122
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,200
Yaksimash.

123
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,680
In USA, they treat their horses

124
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,000
like we in Kazakhstan treat our women.

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,840
Borat himself is not Muslim.

126
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,520
He follows the way of the hawk.

127
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,800
I am Kazakh. I follow the hawk.

128
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,840
But he sometimes bears the brunt of Islamophobia.

129
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,200
I see a lot of people, and I think,

130
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,480
there's a dadgum Muslim.

131
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,520
I wonder what kind of bomb he's got strapped to him.

132
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,680
But while early Borat is occasionally

133
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,120
revealing people's bigotry,

134
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,200
it's more often it's just seeing

135
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,640
how much people will put up with

136
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,040
because they think it's this backwards yokel.

137
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,480
In this episode about horses,

138
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,440
he just talks at this woman for five minutes.

139
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,560
We say in Kazakhstan that a horse is like man.

140
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:14,720
We say if a horse walk, it's like when a man walk.

141
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:23,440
If a horse is old, it's like if a man is old.

142
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,560
And that's the joke.

143
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,360
And that's most of L.A.G. era Borat.

144
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,200
But there was more obvious political stuff

145
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,280
in one episode called Democracy,

146
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,200
there are plenty of choice moments.

147
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,640
If people choose the Jews,

148
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,720
will they go heaven or hell?

149
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,800
I would have to say that they would go to hell.

150
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,200
So the joke with Borat being so obviously

151
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,280
unrepresentative of Kazakhstan

152
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,360
is that people, Americans in particular,

153
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,440
are so ignorant about foreign cultures

154
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,080
that they just accept that this weird stereotype

155
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,240
of a foreigner is legit.

156
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,040
I think that the cultural differences are vast.

157
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,080
And I think he's a delightful man.

158
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,320
So 2006's Borat,

159
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,720
Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit

160
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,560
Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,

161
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,240
aka simply Borat,

162
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,120
grossed $262 million worldwide.

163
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,520
It is the top grossing mockumentary in history

164
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,720
and arguably the top grossing documentary in history,

165
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,120
depending on how you define documentary,

166
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,760
having earned twice as much as its nearest competitor,

167
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,440
Fahrenheit 9-11.

168
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

169
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,720
The movie ended at least one marriage of a person involved.

170
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,640
And I texted Pamela Anderson.

171
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,520
I said, how did it go?

172
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,240
What do you think?

173
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,720
And she texted back, he's getting divorced.

174
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,240
I was like, why?

175
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,920
She goes, the movie.

176
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,200
And I thought it was a joke.

177
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,440
But then a few weeks later, they got divorced

178
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,080
and they put as reason for divorce, Borat.

179
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,800
And several lawsuits from people in the film.

180
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,720
Are women your slaves in Russia?

181
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,160
No.

182
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,840
Do you have slaves here?

183
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,080
We wish.

184
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,880
No slaves.

185
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,440
We wish.

186
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,920
But let's examine Throw the Jew Down the Well.

187
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
What do we gather from this scene?

188
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,160
Are these people revealing their raging antisemitism?

189
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,360
Well, I don't think so.

190
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,160
I don't think that's the insidious thing about this scene.

191
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,960
Rather, it reveals something much more casual.

192
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,560
And there's something revelatory in that people are just willing to go with it.

193
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,640
Borat was able to get an entire bar in Arizona to sing,

194
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,400
Throw the Jew down the well.

195
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,000
It did reveal people's indifference to antisemitism.

196
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,840
But at the same time, I feel like the 2006 film reveals that Cohen,

197
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,240
while joking about these things, he didn't take them that seriously.

198
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,440
Up until recently, he rarely did interviews as himself.

199
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,200
But in an interview in 2012,

200
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,640
he doesn't seem too worried about antisemitism as a big problem.

201
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,880
Do you worry about antisemitism now?

202
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,000
No.

203
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,120
I mean, you know, I don't think there's much antisemitism in England.

204
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,400
I think relatively compared to certain other European countries, it's quite minor.

205
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,800
He doesn't really take authoritarianism seriously.

206
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,600
I had always found Colonel Gaddafi hilarious.

207
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,120
But to me, the most remarkable scene is the one with these frat boys

208
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,120
who pick up Borat while hitchhiking.

209
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,840
Borat usually needs to get people to let their guards down.

210
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,320
But in this scene, he doesn't need to goad them at all.

211
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,200
He sits down and they just start going off.

212
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,000
Our country, the minorities actually have more power.

213
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,480
It would be better country if...

214
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,920
Yes, it would be a better country.

215
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,960
We should have slaves.

216
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,360
And I think the read at the time was more like,

217
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,880
isn't it surprising that some people are still like this?

218
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,840
Like this is a residual phenomenon.

219
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,960
We have the Jews.

220
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,920
We have anybody that's against the mainstream.

221
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,120
So at the time, most people kind of read the things in the film as

222
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,480
revealing an ugly underbelly, but one that's on the outs.

223
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,760
When in reality, this was more of a canary in the coal mine.

224
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,960
So it's pretty obvious that the presidential election of 2016

225
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,640
had a pretty big effect on Cohen, by his own admission.

226
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,120
The show that I just did, Who's America,

227
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,840
Donald Trump got elected and I was upset by it.

228
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,960
I was so angry.

229
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:31,440
I felt I actually have to channel that into some characters aimed at

230
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,320
who could sit with some of those people.

231
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,160
And Who's America is kind of a lot of the same shtick as the Ali G show,

232
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,640
only this time it is pointedly very political.

233
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,600
It's not a movie, it's a fucking terrorist mosque.

234
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,920
Okay, let me address terrorism.

235
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,360
Rest assured I share your concerns and we will do everything we can

236
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,120
to protect these Muslims from it.

237
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,560
And most of it was him getting conservatives to do ridiculous things

238
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,560
that were sort of in line with their beliefs.

239
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,120
But there were other notable influences on 2020 Borat

240
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,200
outside of Cohen's own body of work.

241
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,280
But I recently discovered that by wearing one of my signature articles of clothing,

242
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,000
I may have unintentionally committed a hate crime against the Jewish people.

243
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,080
And that's not good.

244
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:21,200
A Comedy Central show called Nathan For You, which ran from 2013 to 2016.

245
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,320
Where Cohen's Who is America genuinely does at times feel like entrapment.

246
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,800
Is how to go undercover as a 15 year old quinceanera girl

247
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,600
and to disarm the illegal Mexican.

248
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,000
Nathan For You takes a much more nuanced approach

249
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,960
than the mean-spirited punk style humors of the 2000s.

250
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,480
The premise for the show is that host and creator Nathan Fielder,

251
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,760
who in his own words,

252
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,760
graduated from one of Canada's top business schools with really good grades.

253
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,320
Presents himself as a sort of business consultant to real people across Los Angeles

254
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,080
to help pick up their dying business.

255
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,480
And the proposals he gives to his unknowing subjects

256
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,960
are almost always so ludicrous that you expect people to immediately call his bluff.

257
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,880
Have her specialize in a currently unrepresented group of homebuyer.

258
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,600
The 50% of people who believe in ghosts.

259
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,280
The plan, increase business by selling alcohol to minors.

260
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,200
The plan, turn the Helio Cafe into the world's first parody Starbucks.

261
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,480
But they rarely do.

262
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,120
In fact, his targets usually embrace them,

263
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,840
often with hilarious and rarely successful results.

264
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,240
But the thing is, once they let their guard down around Nathan,

265
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,320
they reveal themselves very easily.

266
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,760
Overly intimate details.

267
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,360
Your grandma said...

268
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,560
Long time ago, yeah.

269
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,200
You drink your grandson's pee if you get scared.

270
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,120
Not grandson, any little kid.

271
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,000
There have been times in my life when I was able to ejaculate in another position.

272
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,280
But especially as I'm getting older and fatter,

273
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,120
it's pretty much the only position that works for me.

274
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,040
That makes sense.

275
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,520
Nathan For You is the rare prank show that is not rooted in pissing people off for a reaction

276
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,400
or annoying them, but instead trying to help them out.

277
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:03,360
Usually the M.O. is intentionally trying to get a rise out of people by attacking basic impulses,

278
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,480
or often taking advantage of social norms that

279
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,640
people will keep going about their business when presented with something absurd.

280
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,760
This suit is black.

281
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,900
Okay.

282
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,240
Um, I don't, I don't, I'm not...

283
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,800
Not!

284
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,480
But when the pranker presents themselves as a friend or neutral ear,

285
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,360
like Nathan with his monotone normcore Canadian-ness...

286
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,640
You know what I feel like?

287
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,280
Oh yeah?

288
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,400
A mother effin' beer.

289
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,880
People reveal themselves more easily.

290
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,360
See, for instance, the frat guy scene from the first film.

291
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,200
Why the bitches in the old Russia?

292
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,720
What's a bit of bitch to women?

293
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,240
It's the fuckin' hoes, baby!

294
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,800
I'm a hot woman.

295
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,080
The fuckin' girls!

296
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,360
Borat dropping into a CPAC event he wasn't invited to,

297
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,000
and bursting into a crowded room of Republicans.

298
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,960
I mean, it's funny, but it still falls a little flat compared to the real strengths of the film.

299
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,720
Scenes like the dinner party in the first film or the QAnon guys in the second one,

300
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,040
where Borat is being treated more like a simple foreigner or just a neutral entity,

301
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,560
tend to be the most illuminating.

302
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,040
What is more dangerous, this virus or the Democrat?

303
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,560
Democrats.

304
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,520
Democrats.

305
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,000
And also like Borat, Nathan For You finds ways to incorporate deeply heavy subjects,

306
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,640
for instance, Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism,

307
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,160
in ways that are both revelatory and funny, like they work.

308
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,680
This is a retail store and you don't learn about the darkest moments of history in a retail store.

309
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,400
I beg to differ. The Gap had a whole campaign to make people aware of breast cancer.

310
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,760
So I don't think there's a problem.

311
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,960
It was actually AIDS.

312
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,680
AIDS, sorry.

313
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,000
So in order to work in today's mediascape, the intent of Borat has to change,

314
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,720
not just because the character is super recognizable.

315
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,560
Stupid foreign reporter.

316
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,840
Yeah, kinda looks like you. You got the dark hair and the mustache.

317
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,560
But because the first one came out when the internet was less

318
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,920
widely used and everybody's racist aunt was on Facebook,

319
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,800
the first one came out at a time when the bedrock of American horribleness

320
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,920
was easier to ignore by most people.

321
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,040
You are bigger than a woman. You are better than a woman.

322
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,480
Do not let a woman ever, ever make you who you are.

323
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,400
Also, unlike earlier Borat, this new one is really heavy on issues of gender,

324
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,360
which is arguably the theme at the most forefront of the film.

325
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,560
Most of the scenes revolve around Borat treating his daughter horribly.

326
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,200
All I had left was my livestock.

327
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,800
Two pigs, one cow, and a daughter.

328
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,440
And people just kind of going along with it because, well, he's her dad, so that's fine.

329
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,840
Or he'll say something deeply inappropriate.

330
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,160
How much you think my daughter is worth?

331
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,440
$500.

332
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,480
Ooh, thank you.

333
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,920
That's all I have.

334
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,360
Fucking morons.

335
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,160
And people just laugh along because it doesn't really bother them.

336
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,200
Where is the no means yes section?

337
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,000
The scenes with Borat getting services for Tutar,

338
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,920
going into the crisis pregnancy center.

339
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,800
I have a baby inside me and I want to take it out of me.

340
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,640
Now that you know that I am her father, can we take it out now, please?

341
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,720
God is the one who creates life.

342
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,400
The plastic surgeon.

343
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,840
I want a man who wants to make a sex attack on me.

344
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,400
I think that would be Muslim.

345
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,680
The makeover.

346
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,760
What color is best for a racist family?

347
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,000
I would stay right here.

348
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,760
I wouldn't go any darker than a six or seven.

349
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,400
Are some of the strongest stuff he's ever done,

350
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,080
not just because of what they get on film,

351
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,880
but because these scenes further the plot so much more than anything in the first Borat movie.

352
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,640
Also, while we're here, Maria Bakalova's improv skills are amazing,

353
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,520
especially considering English is like her third language.

354
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,440
And the whole film, she's speaking Bulgarian and Cohen is speaking Hebrew.

355
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:51,120
So in a lot of ways, not just with gender,

356
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,640
subsequent movie film just has a much worse situation to work with.

357
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,320
A culture feeling emboldened to say some really horrifying things,

358
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,160
knowing that this is normalized now.

359
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,800
It isn't just Borat being a straw man for comedic purposes,

360
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,880
as much as it is revealing what people are willing to go along with.

361
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,720
It's worth remarking that Janice,

362
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,080
a babysitter who is tasked with looking after Tutor in the middle of the film,

363
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,240
is one of the only people who shows genuine concern for Tutor's well-being.

364
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,320
I will have the biggest titties in the whole world.

365
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,160
Okay, so you're getting plastic surgery at 15.

366
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,880
Do you want that?

367
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,880
Although the ethics of this whole thing are a little iffy,

368
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,760
apparently they told this poor woman that they were filming like a documentary on child brides.

369
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,840
So for months she thinks that there's this poor girl out there

370
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,000
being married off to this old man and then turns out it's for Borat.

371
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,720
You're giving a little girl to a old man.

372
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,440
I mean yeah, Cohen did give her church a bunch of money and

373
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,040
fans did raise money for her after she lost her job due to COVID.

374
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,240
But you know, yeah.

375
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,320
Your virgin cannot bite and cannot suck your arms to a ball.

376
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,240
But Janice, despite being positioned as sort of the emotional heart of the film,

377
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,600
stands in stark contrast to basically everyone else.

378
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,960
Subsequent movie film levels up from indifference to anti-Semitism to active participation.

379
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,440
In the first movie, you get some light jokes.

380
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,720
And of course, from the Ali G era, we got throw the Jew down the well.

381
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,040
But by the time of subsequent movie film,

382
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,400
they got a guy doing a Heil Hitler salute on camera.

383
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,320
They got a plastic surgeon to say this.

384
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,320
Do I look like a Jew?

385
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,600
No. Jew would be like this.

386
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,520
And a baker to do this.

387
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,400
Jews will not replace us.

388
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,160
They got a random store owner to high five Mexicans in cages.

389
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,360
McDonald Trump, he cage Mexicans.

390
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,520
In Borat, he says some wild things about his weird beliefs.

391
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,800
And the joke is that people just kind of roll with it uncomfortably.

392
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,560
I use white wine.

393
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,840
No, I don't. You do.

394
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,920
This is a very private thing.

395
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,440
The host cleans the anus.

396
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,160
But in subsequent movie film, in one scene, you have Borat worried about Jew venom.

397
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,560
Use your venom on me and finish me. I am very depressed.

398
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,360
And in the very next scene, you have QAnon guys talking about Democrats torturing children

399
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,560
in order to drink their blood to extract their adrenochrome because of their Satan worship.

400
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,200
Then they take that out of their adrenal glands.

401
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,800
And then they drink their blood or that.

402
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,400
The things real Americans believe now are wilder than anything Borat has ever

403
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,440
fictionally believed.

404
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,400
But at the same time, the film also kind of reveals their humanity.

405
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,000
These guys believe such toxic things, but at the same time,

406
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,720
they allow this guy who they think is just a wacky foreigner to live with them for five days.

407
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,400
So I lived with them undercover for five days.

408
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,960
Yeah, they thought that I was a foreign guy who didn't really understand much about coronavirus.

409
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,800
And also they're patient with him.

410
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,200
They're supportive of his relationship with his daughter.

411
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,280
They correct him when they think he's wrong.

412
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,840
We're looking at this and thinking, what?

413
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,960
Yeah, it's a lie.

414
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,720
That's it. It's a conspiracy theory.

415
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,320
All this is true while they still believe the things that they do.

416
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,560
They state with zero irony that Democrats should have fewer rights.

417
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,120
They should have a bit less rights than you.

418
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,680
I think they should.

419
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,240
So I don't think the film offers up really any solutions as to what to do about this.

420
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,720
But unlike the first Borat where we're just kind of

421
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,600
laughing at the dark underbelly of American culture.

422
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,560
What is the best gun to defend from a Jew?

423
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,080
I would recommend either a nine millimeter or a 45.

424
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,480
Subsequent movie films shows that this dark underbelly can no longer be ignored.

425
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,680
Wah, wah, wah, wah.

426
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:01,280
CNN projects Joseph R. Biden Jr. is elected the 46th president of the United States.

427
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,920
Joe Biden has won the American presidential election.

428
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,800
The third time is the charm for former Vice President Joe Biden.

429
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,840
So we started working on this before the election, but

430
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,800
after that lost week of doom scrolling.

431
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,840
Doom scrolling. It means scrolling through doom.

432
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,240
We decided to wait until after the election to finish it.

433
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,920
I don't think anyone expected that this ugliness would go away when Trump did.

434
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,400
But even braced for the worst case scenario,

435
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,920
it really is genuinely shocking to see the abject denial of reality play out.

436
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,720
I can announce to you right now in high confidence

437
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,960
that Donald J. Trump has been reelected to the United States.

438
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,360
So how do you laugh at exposing reality

439
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:49,840
when half of the country doesn't even agree on what the other half considers reality to be?

440
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,640
Cohen has said that he doesn't blame the QAnon guys.

441
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,760
They are looking for a sense of security in an insecure world,

442
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,000
and they've been fed this stream of lies by grifters like Alex Jones

443
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,040
and a social mediascape that profits off of outrage.

444
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,000
And he says he can't even dislike them. He just pities them.

445
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,040
But again, looking at Borat's relationship to the QAnon guys,

446
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,920
I don't think it's the worst thing in the world that the movie humanizes them.

447
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,120
But they're clearly not evil people.

448
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,920
After all, they help a stranger who they think is in need.

449
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,840
But at the same time, they're kind of fine with this abstract idea

450
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,840
of harming their political enemies.

451
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,560
We can't do to them what we would like to do,

452
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,560
because they, unfortunately, they have the same rights we do.

453
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,880
And while, yes, you do have some fringe assholes calling for, you know, like, genocide,

454
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,240
I think that most people like these don't want actual bloodshed.

455
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:46,080
But they are kind of fine if someone else comes along and suggests it.

456
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,160
What should we do with scientists?

457
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,400
Let's hear it for gas them up like the Germans.

458
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,800
And that's the danger.

459
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,440
That's where it's really easy for people to gaslight you.

460
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,400
These people were only joking or trying to get a rise out of people.

461
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,600
They said, oh, he said something.

462
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,880
When they show me, I'm laughing, they're laughing, everybody's laughing.

463
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,160
Now when you said you wished Americans would sit up out of tension when you...

464
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,400
I'm kidding, you don't understand sarcasm.

465
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,760
Sounds interesting to me.

466
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,040
I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you

467
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,640
just to see what would happen.

468
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,560
It's not shown in the film, but this rally actually ended really badly

469
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,280
when the people in the audience figured out what was going on.

470
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,200
Eventually, they booed Cohen off the stage.

471
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,600
The doors are locked?

472
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,080
And the organizers got up on stage and said that he said these racist things,

473
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,200
and we don't condone that,

474
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,200
and now they're going to try to trick everybody into thinking that we're the bad guys.

475
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,840
We don't support anything that was up there and being said.

476
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,520
I just want to let you all know that this is a conservative event.

477
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,360
We believe in the Second Amendment, and we believe in equal rights for all.

478
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,680
We do not discriminate for any reason, and that man is not welcome with us.

479
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:00,960
They say this, and yet the film crew got so many of these people singing along

480
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,760
and cheering on and going along with it until they realized what was going on.

481
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,040
So with subsequent movie film, the Giuliani thing is funny,

482
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,640
but it doesn't really tell us anything we didn't already know.

483
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,640
She's 15. She's too old for you.

484
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,000
The really poignant and honestly scary thing

485
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,600
is instead of trying to provoke a certain reaction as Borat did in earlier days,

486
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,600
it's more revealing people who might be, you know, nice and regular people

487
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,680
being okay with horrible things as long as they exist in the abstract

488
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,360
and someone else is doing them.

489
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,400
They should have a bit less rights than you.

490
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,400
I'm not.

491
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,040
They should.

492
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,280
There's an episode of Who is America where Cohen disguises himself as an Israeli operative

493
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,560
and convinces this random Trump supporter that he's going to help him infiltrate an Antifa rally.

494
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,320
So he gets this guy to go along with it,

495
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,240
and once at the rally, they place little chips on some random protesters.

496
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,360
Then Cohen tells this guy that if he pushes the button,

497
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,320
it will take out these random Antifa terrorists.

498
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,640
There is a small explosive device.

499
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,440
Okay.

500
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,680
Small enough to create a fatal heart attack.

501
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,800
And he does it,

502
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,560
believing that he has actually taken the life of three people.

503
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,560
I've never participated in someone's death.

504
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,960
And he's fine with it because it happened off screen and someone else arranged it.

505
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,160
I wanted to see, would he actually do it?

506
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,320
The answer was yes.

507
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,960
He pushed the button and thought he had actually killed three human beings.

508
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,080
You know...

509
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,080
It's been a wonderful experience for me.

510
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,280
Look at the people here.

511
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,040
They are the lowest of the low.

512
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,680
I agree.

513
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,440
I've never seen so much sickness.

514
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,720
So I kind of had this half-serious thought after I saw the new film

515
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,440
that Borat is going to come back in another 15 years to an even worse America,

516
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,400
and he's going to have an even easier time getting normal people to say and do horrible things.

517
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,280
Let's say I wanted to finish lives of 20 gypsy.

518
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,640
Would this be enough?

519
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,600
Maybe the bigger one.

520
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,040
And the way things are headed, I don't know.

521
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,720
Nobody can tell the future.

522
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,560
And honestly, I'm not going to try to.

523
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:12,880
But all I can really take from this is Borat is good because the world is bad.

524
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,920
So maybe he's the hero we need right now, but he is certainly not the hero we should want.

525
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,720
Voltaire was right when he said those who can make you believe absurdities

526
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,880
can make you commit atrocities.

527
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,920
Ad read time.

528
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,840
This episode was sponsored by Audible.

529

531
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,000
Yes, really.

532
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,400
The copy says I'm supposed to tie this in with the content of the video.

533
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:12,080
It's like Borat in 2000s nostalgia.

534
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,840
Borat was 2006.

535
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,920
The book takes place in 2007.

536
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,720
Relevant.

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,760

No, I did not read it.

549
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,240
I'm not the reader.

550
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,680
People are like, where did you get that voice?

551
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,200
And I'm like, do you not recognize my voice?

552
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,160
That's not my voice.

553
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,960
It is Oliver Thorne's voice, though, from Philosophy 2.

554
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,400
It's got two readers.
