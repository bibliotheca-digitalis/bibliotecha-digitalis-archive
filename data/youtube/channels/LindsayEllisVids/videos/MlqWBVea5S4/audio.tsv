0	2960	Like, a little refinement of the nose.
2960	6320	What's wrong with my nose? Do I look like a Jew?
6320	8320	No, ma'am. Not at all.
8320	10320	Phew!
10320	12320	Borat's subsequent movie film,
12320	17600	delivery of prodigious bribe to American regime for make-benefit once-glorious nation of Kazakhstan,
17600	21840	is a superior film to its predecessor by basically every metric.
21840	24560	Every scene in the film drives the plot forward or builds character,
24560	28000	and it also actually has an emotional core with stakes.
28000	32640	The same can't really be said about the first film, where Borat's mission is just to, you know,
32640	35680	hang out and eventually he decides to kidnap Pamela Anderson.
35680	40000	For the first time in my life, I was in love.
40000	44240	The second film not only centers on the relationship between Borat and his daughter,
44240	48560	it also actually has stakes. If he fails in his mission, he will be execute.
48560	57280	If you do not deliver a bribe to get me into strongman club, you will be execute.
57280	61840	It's no secret that Borat 1 was cobbled together in the edit, and the same holds true of the sequel.
61840	62960	Walla Walla!
62960	67280	But the filmmakers actually set out with an emotional core to the film and worked around that.
67280	70960	But the remarkable thing to me isn't that the film has a much more cohesive structure,
70960	76960	but rather that the joke itself hasn't aged poorly in the way that so much mid-2000s comedy has.
76960	84480	And now, girls jumping on trampolines!
84480	88960	Now, as to whether or not Borat's 1 or 2 can be considered problematic...
89920	93440	I could not concentrate on what this old man was saying.
93440	97040	...is up for some debate. I think it's a fair question to ask how much Borat,
97040	102640	the lovable anti-Semite, helped to normalize ironic anti-Semitism in the way that South Park did.
102640	104080	Oh yeah? Well, you're a stupid Jew!
104080	104880	You're a Jew!
104880	106400	Such a goddamn Jew, Matt!
106400	111600	And ironic anti-Semitism has been the biggest gateway for actual anti-Semitism in this last
111600	114960	decade, giving us a renaissance which we are presently living through.
114960	122160	Kazakhstan, glorious country. It have a problem, too. Economic, social, and Jew.
122160	125120	And I'm not really in a position to say that he's, you know,
125120	129120	Jew-ing wrong. Like Mel Brooks, he is a polarizing figure within the Jewish community.
129120	135440	At times, some critics have said my comedy risks reinforcing old stereotypes.
135440	139760	But anyway, my thought when I first saw ads for the second Borat movie was to compare it to
139760	143840	similar mid-2000s humor that I think on the whole has aged very poorly.
145760	148960	So the method of coping with the state of the world back in 2006
148960	152800	was to kind of act above it all, even when dealing with injustices.
152800	158800	This guy does the best Ali G impersonation. I? I can't do it. Go on.
158800	159200	I don't.
160400	164400	Matt Stone and Trey Parker spent the whole 2000s explaining that things were fine, actually.
164400	165440	Both sides bad.
165520	170480	Welcome to the cable access televised debate between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
170480	173680	Avenue Q reassures us that things are only for now.
173680	174800	And then there's Borat.
175520	181360	This why Ministry of Information have decide to send me to U.S. and A,
181360	183040	greatest country in the world.
183760	188320	Borat's subsequent movie film is less comparable to Borat than it is to Fahrenheit 9-11.
188320	191280	Borat's subsequent movie film is much more shrewd in its target,
191360	193360	more overt with its politics.
193360	195680	And the first one was still pretty overt.
199920	202240	And it even ends with a call to action to vote,
202240	205360	leaving people who were apparently oblivious to the political undertones
205360	208720	that were always present in Borat confused and upset.
208720	212480	It seems obvious to state out loud, but Borat was always political.
212480	215760	The film spends a lot of time exposing American jingoism,
215760	219920	tricking people into exposing their bigotries or their indifference to bigotry.
219920	221680	Come on and make my day, Jew.
223920	226720	But Borat isn't meant to be political in the way that
226720	230320	Sacha Baron Cohen's later project, Who Is America, is.
230320	232960	If you want to win, you show some skin.
233840	234480	Okay.
234480	235440	Okay, show it to me.
237600	243280	Cohen's earlier characters were more cringe comedy that sometimes excel at being political.
243280	248560	In terms of early Borat, what most people tend to think of is the scene from The Ali G Show
248560	253440	in which he sings a song called In My Country There Is Problem, which features the lyrics.
260720	264400	And from Borat the movie, you have memorable scenes like these frat guys.
269360	272880	But that sort of thing actually doesn't take up that much runtime of the first film.
272880	274160	Mostly it's this sort of thing.
278960	282240	So Cohen uses this lovable anti-semitic buffoon.
282240	287440	The people he's talking to think he's at best a malleable knife and at worst barely human.
291440	294240	They let their guards down enough to say some truly heinous things.
301200	304000	Borat gets people to say the quiet part loud.
308800	313040	Shave that dead gum mustache off so you're not so conspicuous.
313040	315200	So you look like maybe an Italian.
315200	318880	So the thing that struck me about Borat's subsequent movie film was that the movie
318880	323040	uses almost the exact same shtick as the now 14-year-old first movie.
323040	325760	But that shtick rang very different then than it does today.
325760	329280	And I think what kind of really struck me in a horrible way was that
329280	331840	it's not even that the bit didn't age poorly,
331840	337040	it's that it actually works better in 2020 than it did in 2006.
337040	340720	And I think that's because Borat finally figured out his sense of purpose.
340720	346320	We are part of the global community influencing elections around the world.
347840	351520	Borat falls within this sort of prank reality tv genre
351520	354080	that was really huge in the late 90s and 2000s.
354080	355840	I'm following you.
356960	359680	I just went in a drugstore and bought some condoms.
359680	361440	I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.
361440	364480	You have shows like the Tom Green show, Boiling Point,
364480	367120	Crank Yankers, Trigger Happy TV,
367120	370240	and Ashton Kutcher's Punch ran for 11 seasons.
370240	372800	And most of these shows are primarily run on the premise of
372800	375520	annoying slash scaring people to get a response.
375520	377520	Whether it's shows like Sci-Fi Scare Tactics,
377520	379600	wherein people are unknowingly placed in premises
379600	381840	that mimic scenarios from horror films,
381840	384880	or stupid shtick like this from Crank Yankers.
384880	388880	I got mail, I got mail, I got mail, I got mail.
388880	391040	And of course there was Tom Green.
391680	394000	So to show my parents how much I love them,
394080	398320	I've turned my parents' vehicle into more than just a vehicle.
398320	399760	Dad can't take the bus to work,
399760	401920	I'm gonna take the slut mobile to the bus stop.
401920	403440	Wow, there's a lot of people at the bus stop.
403440	406080	I hope my dad's not embarrassed by his slut mobile.
406080	407680	But the difference between this stuff
407680	409360	and what Sacha Baron Cohen was doing
409360	413360	was Cohen's material had a more political edge.
413360	417520	So which is the party of the homosexuals?
418640	421360	They tend to go to the Democratic Party.
421360	423360	So let's look at a quick history of Borat.
423360	425600	Earlier iterations manifested in characters
425600	427920	like Alexei Krikler from Moldova,
427920	431360	and for a while Cohen had a character named Christo in the 90s.
431360	433040	She wears too many clothes.
433040	436160	But after 9-11, he evolved into Borat,
436160	438640	and this Eastern European goon got folded
438640	440880	into the Muslim world with Kazakhstan,
440880	442560	having elements of Eastern Europe,
442560	444320	that former Soviet aesthetic,
444320	446000	and being a Muslim-majority country.
446000	447200	Yaksimash.
447200	449680	In USA, they treat their horses
449680	452000	like we in Kazakhstan treat our women.
452000	453840	Borat himself is not Muslim.
453840	455520	He follows the way of the hawk.
455520	458800	I am Kazakh. I follow the hawk.
458800	461840	But he sometimes bears the brunt of Islamophobia.
461840	463200	I see a lot of people, and I think,
463200	464480	there's a dadgum Muslim.
464480	467520	I wonder what kind of bomb he's got strapped to him.
467520	469680	But while early Borat is occasionally
469680	471120	revealing people's bigotry,
471120	473200	it's more often it's just seeing
473200	474640	how much people will put up with
474640	477040	because they think it's this backwards yokel.
477040	478480	In this episode about horses,
478480	481440	he just talks at this woman for five minutes.
481440	486560	We say in Kazakhstan that a horse is like man.
486560	494720	We say if a horse walk, it's like when a man walk.
494720	503440	If a horse is old, it's like if a man is old.
503440	504560	And that's the joke.
504560	507360	And that's most of L.A.G. era Borat.
507360	509200	But there was more obvious political stuff
509200	511280	in one episode called Democracy,
511280	513200	there are plenty of choice moments.
513200	516640	If people choose the Jews,
516640	518720	will they go heaven or hell?
520320	522800	I would have to say that they would go to hell.
522800	525200	So the joke with Borat being so obviously
525200	527280	unrepresentative of Kazakhstan
527280	529360	is that people, Americans in particular,
529360	531440	are so ignorant about foreign cultures
531440	534080	that they just accept that this weird stereotype
534080	536240	of a foreigner is legit.
536240	541040	I think that the cultural differences are vast.
541520	544080	And I think he's a delightful man.
544080	546320	So 2006's Borat,
546320	548720	Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit
548720	550560	Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,
550560	552240	aka simply Borat,
552240	555120	grossed $262 million worldwide.
555120	557520	It is the top grossing mockumentary in history
557520	560720	and arguably the top grossing documentary in history,
560720	563120	depending on how you define documentary,
563120	565760	having earned twice as much as its nearest competitor,
566400	567440	Fahrenheit 9-11.
567440	569760	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
569760	572720	The movie ended at least one marriage of a person involved.
572720	574640	And I texted Pamela Anderson.
574640	575520	I said, how did it go?
575520	576240	What do you think?
576240	578720	And she texted back, he's getting divorced.
579360	580240	I was like, why?
580240	581920	She goes, the movie.
581920	583200	And I thought it was a joke.
583200	585440	But then a few weeks later, they got divorced
585440	588080	and they put as reason for divorce, Borat.
588080	590800	And several lawsuits from people in the film.
590800	592720	Are women your slaves in Russia?
593680	594160	No.
594160	595840	Do you have slaves here?
595840	596080	We wish.
596080	596880	No slaves.
596880	597440	We wish.
597440	599920	But let's examine Throw the Jew Down the Well.
606640	608640	What do we gather from this scene?
608640	612160	Are these people revealing their raging antisemitism?
620320	621360	Well, I don't think so.
621360	624160	I don't think that's the insidious thing about this scene.
624160	626960	Rather, it reveals something much more casual.
627520	630560	And there's something revelatory in that people are just willing to go with it.
634960	638640	Borat was able to get an entire bar in Arizona to sing,
638640	640400	Throw the Jew down the well.
641600	646000	It did reveal people's indifference to antisemitism.
646000	649840	But at the same time, I feel like the 2006 film reveals that Cohen,
649840	654240	while joking about these things, he didn't take them that seriously.
654240	657440	Up until recently, he rarely did interviews as himself.
657440	659200	But in an interview in 2012,
659200	662640	he doesn't seem too worried about antisemitism as a big problem.
662640	664880	Do you worry about antisemitism now?
665680	666000	No.
666000	669120	I mean, you know, I don't think there's much antisemitism in England.
669120	674400	I think relatively compared to certain other European countries, it's quite minor.
674400	676800	He doesn't really take authoritarianism seriously.
676800	679600	I had always found Colonel Gaddafi hilarious.
680160	683120	But to me, the most remarkable scene is the one with these frat boys
683200	685120	who pick up Borat while hitchhiking.
685120	687840	Borat usually needs to get people to let their guards down.
687840	690320	But in this scene, he doesn't need to goad them at all.
690320	693200	He sits down and they just start going off.
693200	696000	Our country, the minorities actually have more power.
696560	698480	It would be better country if...
698480	699920	Yes, it would be a better country.
699920	700960	We should have slaves.
700960	703360	And I think the read at the time was more like,
703360	706880	isn't it surprising that some people are still like this?
706880	709840	Like this is a residual phenomenon.
709840	710960	We have the Jews.
710960	713920	We have anybody that's against the mainstream.
713920	717120	So at the time, most people kind of read the things in the film as
717120	722480	revealing an ugly underbelly, but one that's on the outs.
722480	725760	When in reality, this was more of a canary in the coal mine.
729760	732960	So it's pretty obvious that the presidential election of 2016
732960	736640	had a pretty big effect on Cohen, by his own admission.
737200	739120	The show that I just did, Who's America,
739920	743840	Donald Trump got elected and I was upset by it.
743840	744960	I was so angry.
744960	751440	I felt I actually have to channel that into some characters aimed at
752400	754320	who could sit with some of those people.
754320	758160	And Who's America is kind of a lot of the same shtick as the Ali G show,
758160	760640	only this time it is pointedly very political.
760640	763600	It's not a movie, it's a fucking terrorist mosque.
763600	765920	Okay, let me address terrorism.
766000	769360	Rest assured I share your concerns and we will do everything we can
769360	771120	to protect these Muslims from it.
771120	774560	And most of it was him getting conservatives to do ridiculous things
774560	776560	that were sort of in line with their beliefs.
780160	783120	But there were other notable influences on 2020 Borat
783120	785200	outside of Cohen's own body of work.
785200	789280	But I recently discovered that by wearing one of my signature articles of clothing,
789840	794000	I may have unintentionally committed a hate crime against the Jewish people.
794800	796080	And that's not good.
796080	801200	A Comedy Central show called Nathan For You, which ran from 2013 to 2016.
801200	806320	Where Cohen's Who is America genuinely does at times feel like entrapment.
806320	810800	Is how to go undercover as a 15 year old quinceanera girl
810800	813600	and to disarm the illegal Mexican.
813600	816000	Nathan For You takes a much more nuanced approach
816000	818960	than the mean-spirited punk style humors of the 2000s.
818960	822480	The premise for the show is that host and creator Nathan Fielder,
822480	823760	who in his own words,
823920	827760	graduated from one of Canada's top business schools with really good grades.
828320	832320	Presents himself as a sort of business consultant to real people across Los Angeles
832320	834080	to help pick up their dying business.
834080	836480	And the proposals he gives to his unknowing subjects
836480	840960	are almost always so ludicrous that you expect people to immediately call his bluff.
840960	844880	Have her specialize in a currently unrepresented group of homebuyer.
844880	847600	The 50% of people who believe in ghosts.
847600	851280	The plan, increase business by selling alcohol to minors.
852000	857200	The plan, turn the Helio Cafe into the world's first parody Starbucks.
857200	858480	But they rarely do.
858480	861120	In fact, his targets usually embrace them,
861120	863840	often with hilarious and rarely successful results.
863840	866240	But the thing is, once they let their guard down around Nathan,
866240	868320	they reveal themselves very easily.
868320	869760	Overly intimate details.
870480	871360	Your grandma said...
871360	872560	Long time ago, yeah.
872560	875200	You drink your grandson's pee if you get scared.
875200	877120	Not grandson, any little kid.
878080	882000	There have been times in my life when I was able to ejaculate in another position.
882880	885280	But especially as I'm getting older and fatter,
885280	887120	it's pretty much the only position that works for me.
888240	889040	That makes sense.
890640	895520	Nathan For You is the rare prank show that is not rooted in pissing people off for a reaction
895520	898400	or annoying them, but instead trying to help them out.
898400	903360	Usually the M.O. is intentionally trying to get a rise out of people by attacking basic impulses,
903680	906480	or often taking advantage of social norms that
906480	910640	people will keep going about their business when presented with something absurd.
910640	911760	This suit is black.
914400	914900	Okay.
916080	918240	Um, I don't, I don't, I'm not...
918240	918800	Not!
918800	922480	But when the pranker presents themselves as a friend or neutral ear,
922480	927360	like Nathan with his monotone normcore Canadian-ness...
927360	928640	You know what I feel like?
928640	929280	Oh yeah?
929280	930400	A mother effin' beer.
930960	932880	People reveal themselves more easily.
932880	935360	See, for instance, the frat guy scene from the first film.
935360	937200	Why the bitches in the old Russia?
937200	938720	What's a bit of bitch to women?
938720	940240	It's the fuckin' hoes, baby!
940240	940800	I'm a hot woman.
940800	942080	The fuckin' girls!
942080	945360	Borat dropping into a CPAC event he wasn't invited to,
945360	948000	and bursting into a crowded room of Republicans.
948000	952960	I mean, it's funny, but it still falls a little flat compared to the real strengths of the film.
952960	956720	Scenes like the dinner party in the first film or the QAnon guys in the second one,
957440	961040	where Borat is being treated more like a simple foreigner or just a neutral entity,
961040	962560	tend to be the most illuminating.
962560	967040	What is more dangerous, this virus or the Democrat?
967840	968560	Democrats.
968560	969520	Democrats.
969520	974000	And also like Borat, Nathan For You finds ways to incorporate deeply heavy subjects,
974000	976640	for instance, Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism,
976640	980160	in ways that are both revelatory and funny, like they work.
980160	985680	This is a retail store and you don't learn about the darkest moments of history in a retail store.
985680	990400	I beg to differ. The Gap had a whole campaign to make people aware of breast cancer.
990400	991760	So I don't think there's a problem.
991760	992960	It was actually AIDS.
992960	993680	AIDS, sorry.
993680	998000	So in order to work in today's mediascape, the intent of Borat has to change,
998000	1000720	not just because the character is super recognizable.
1000720	1002560	Stupid foreign reporter.
1002560	1005840	Yeah, kinda looks like you. You got the dark hair and the mustache.
1005840	1008560	But because the first one came out when the internet was less
1008560	1011920	widely used and everybody's racist aunt was on Facebook,
1011920	1016800	the first one came out at a time when the bedrock of American horribleness
1016800	1019920	was easier to ignore by most people.
1019920	1023040	You are bigger than a woman. You are better than a woman.
1023040	1028480	Do not let a woman ever, ever make you who you are.
1028480	1032400	Also, unlike earlier Borat, this new one is really heavy on issues of gender,
1032400	1035360	which is arguably the theme at the most forefront of the film.
1035360	1038560	Most of the scenes revolve around Borat treating his daughter horribly.
1038560	1041200	All I had left was my livestock.
1041280	1044800	Two pigs, one cow, and a daughter.
1044800	1049440	And people just kind of going along with it because, well, he's her dad, so that's fine.
1049440	1051840	Or he'll say something deeply inappropriate.
1051840	1054160	How much you think my daughter is worth?
1056560	1057440	$500.
1057440	1058480	Ooh, thank you.
1060880	1061920	That's all I have.
1061920	1063360	Fucking morons.
1063360	1066160	And people just laugh along because it doesn't really bother them.
1066160	1069200	Where is the no means yes section?
1071600	1074000	The scenes with Borat getting services for Tutar,
1074000	1075920	going into the crisis pregnancy center.
1077760	1082800	I have a baby inside me and I want to take it out of me.
1082800	1086640	Now that you know that I am her father, can we take it out now, please?
1086640	1088720	God is the one who creates life.
1088720	1090400	The plastic surgeon.
1090400	1093840	I want a man who wants to make a sex attack on me.
1094800	1096400	I think that would be Muslim.
1096400	1097680	The makeover.
1097680	1099760	What color is best for a racist family?
1101200	1102000	I would stay right here.
1102000	1103760	I wouldn't go any darker than a six or seven.
1104320	1106400	Are some of the strongest stuff he's ever done,
1106400	1108080	not just because of what they get on film,
1108080	1112880	but because these scenes further the plot so much more than anything in the first Borat movie.
1112880	1116640	Also, while we're here, Maria Bakalova's improv skills are amazing,
1116640	1119520	especially considering English is like her third language.
1119520	1123440	And the whole film, she's speaking Bulgarian and Cohen is speaking Hebrew.
1124400	1131120	So in a lot of ways, not just with gender,
1131120	1134640	subsequent movie film just has a much worse situation to work with.
1134640	1138320	A culture feeling emboldened to say some really horrifying things,
1138320	1140160	knowing that this is normalized now.
1145920	1148800	It isn't just Borat being a straw man for comedic purposes,
1148800	1152880	as much as it is revealing what people are willing to go along with.
1152880	1154720	It's worth remarking that Janice,
1154720	1158080	a babysitter who is tasked with looking after Tutor in the middle of the film,
1158080	1162240	is one of the only people who shows genuine concern for Tutor's well-being.
1162240	1166320	I will have the biggest titties in the whole world.
1166880	1170160	Okay, so you're getting plastic surgery at 15.
1170160	1170880	Do you want that?
1172640	1174880	Although the ethics of this whole thing are a little iffy,
1174880	1179760	apparently they told this poor woman that they were filming like a documentary on child brides.
1179760	1183840	So for months she thinks that there's this poor girl out there
1183840	1188000	being married off to this old man and then turns out it's for Borat.
1188000	1192720	You're giving a little girl to a old man.
1192720	1195440	I mean yeah, Cohen did give her church a bunch of money and
1195440	1199040	fans did raise money for her after she lost her job due to COVID.
1199040	1200240	But you know, yeah.
1200240	1206320	Your virgin cannot bite and cannot suck your arms to a ball.
1206400	1210240	But Janice, despite being positioned as sort of the emotional heart of the film,
1210240	1213600	stands in stark contrast to basically everyone else.
1213600	1218960	Subsequent movie film levels up from indifference to anti-Semitism to active participation.
1218960	1221440	In the first movie, you get some light jokes.
1221440	1224720	And of course, from the Ali G era, we got throw the Jew down the well.
1227360	1229040	But by the time of subsequent movie film,
1229040	1232400	they got a guy doing a Heil Hitler salute on camera.
1232400	1234320	They got a plastic surgeon to say this.
1234960	1236320	Do I look like a Jew?
1237040	1239600	No. Jew would be like this.
1239600	1241520	And a baker to do this.
1241520	1246400	Jews will not replace us.
1246400	1250160	They got a random store owner to high five Mexicans in cages.
1250160	1253360	McDonald Trump, he cage Mexicans.
1255760	1259520	In Borat, he says some wild things about his weird beliefs.
1259520	1262800	And the joke is that people just kind of roll with it uncomfortably.
1263440	1264560	I use white wine.
1264560	1265840	No, I don't. You do.
1265840	1267920	This is a very private thing.
1267920	1269440	The host cleans the anus.
1269440	1274160	But in subsequent movie film, in one scene, you have Borat worried about Jew venom.
1274160	1278560	Use your venom on me and finish me. I am very depressed.
1278560	1283360	And in the very next scene, you have QAnon guys talking about Democrats torturing children
1283360	1288560	in order to drink their blood to extract their adrenochrome because of their Satan worship.
1289280	1293200	Then they take that out of their adrenal glands.
1293200	1294800	And then they drink their blood or that.
1295760	1300400	The things real Americans believe now are wilder than anything Borat has ever
1300400	1301440	fictionally believed.
1301440	1304400	But at the same time, the film also kind of reveals their humanity.
1304400	1308000	These guys believe such toxic things, but at the same time,
1308000	1312720	they allow this guy who they think is just a wacky foreigner to live with them for five days.
1312720	1316400	So I lived with them undercover for five days.
1316400	1320960	Yeah, they thought that I was a foreign guy who didn't really understand much about coronavirus.
1320960	1322800	And also they're patient with him.
1322800	1325200	They're supportive of his relationship with his daughter.
1325200	1327280	They correct him when they think he's wrong.
1327280	1329840	We're looking at this and thinking, what?
1329840	1330960	Yeah, it's a lie.
1331920	1334720	That's it. It's a conspiracy theory.
1334720	1338320	All this is true while they still believe the things that they do.
1338320	1342560	They state with zero irony that Democrats should have fewer rights.
1342560	1345120	They should have a bit less rights than you.
1346080	1347680	I think they should.
1347680	1352240	So I don't think the film offers up really any solutions as to what to do about this.
1352240	1354720	But unlike the first Borat where we're just kind of
1354720	1357600	laughing at the dark underbelly of American culture.
1357600	1360560	What is the best gun to defend from a Jew?
1363840	1368080	I would recommend either a nine millimeter or a 45.
1368080	1372480	Subsequent movie films shows that this dark underbelly can no longer be ignored.
1372640	1373680	Wah, wah, wah, wah.
1374720	1381280	CNN projects Joseph R. Biden Jr. is elected the 46th president of the United States.
1381280	1385920	Joe Biden has won the American presidential election.
1385920	1390800	The third time is the charm for former Vice President Joe Biden.
1390800	1393840	So we started working on this before the election, but
1393840	1396800	after that lost week of doom scrolling.
1396800	1399840	Doom scrolling. It means scrolling through doom.
1399840	1402240	We decided to wait until after the election to finish it.
1402240	1405920	I don't think anyone expected that this ugliness would go away when Trump did.
1405920	1408400	But even braced for the worst case scenario,
1408400	1413920	it really is genuinely shocking to see the abject denial of reality play out.
1413920	1416720	I can announce to you right now in high confidence
1416720	1420960	that Donald J. Trump has been reelected to the United States.
1420960	1423360	So how do you laugh at exposing reality
1423920	1429840	when half of the country doesn't even agree on what the other half considers reality to be?
1429840	1432640	Cohen has said that he doesn't blame the QAnon guys.
1432640	1435760	They are looking for a sense of security in an insecure world,
1435760	1440000	and they've been fed this stream of lies by grifters like Alex Jones
1440000	1443040	and a social mediascape that profits off of outrage.
1443040	1446000	And he says he can't even dislike them. He just pities them.
1446000	1449040	But again, looking at Borat's relationship to the QAnon guys,
1449040	1451920	I don't think it's the worst thing in the world that the movie humanizes them.
1454640	1457120	But they're clearly not evil people.
1457120	1459920	After all, they help a stranger who they think is in need.
1459920	1463840	But at the same time, they're kind of fine with this abstract idea
1463840	1465840	of harming their political enemies.
1465840	1468560	We can't do to them what we would like to do,
1468560	1472560	because they, unfortunately, they have the same rights we do.
1472560	1476880	And while, yes, you do have some fringe assholes calling for, you know, like, genocide,
1476880	1480240	I think that most people like these don't want actual bloodshed.
1480800	1486080	But they are kind of fine if someone else comes along and suggests it.
1486080	1488160	What should we do with scientists?
1488160	1490400	Let's hear it for gas them up like the Germans.
1493600	1494800	And that's the danger.
1494800	1497440	That's where it's really easy for people to gaslight you.
1497440	1500400	These people were only joking or trying to get a rise out of people.
1500400	1501600	They said, oh, he said something.
1502160	1504880	When they show me, I'm laughing, they're laughing, everybody's laughing.
1504880	1508160	Now when you said you wished Americans would sit up out of tension when you...
1508160	1510400	I'm kidding, you don't understand sarcasm.
1510400	1511760	Sounds interesting to me.
1511760	1515040	I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you
1515040	1516640	just to see what would happen.
1516640	1520560	It's not shown in the film, but this rally actually ended really badly
1520560	1523280	when the people in the audience figured out what was going on.
1523280	1525200	Eventually, they booed Cohen off the stage.
1528800	1529600	The doors are locked?
1530880	1534080	And the organizers got up on stage and said that he said these racist things,
1534080	1535200	and we don't condone that,
1535200	1539200	and now they're going to try to trick everybody into thinking that we're the bad guys.
1540560	1543840	We don't support anything that was up there and being said.
1543920	1547520	I just want to let you all know that this is a conservative event.
1547520	1551360	We believe in the Second Amendment, and we believe in equal rights for all.
1551360	1555680	We do not discriminate for any reason, and that man is not welcome with us.
1555680	1560960	They say this, and yet the film crew got so many of these people singing along
1560960	1565760	and cheering on and going along with it until they realized what was going on.
1565760	1569040	So with subsequent movie film, the Giuliani thing is funny,
1569040	1572640	but it doesn't really tell us anything we didn't already know.
1574800	1576640	She's 15. She's too old for you.
1577200	1580000	The really poignant and honestly scary thing
1580000	1583600	is instead of trying to provoke a certain reaction as Borat did in earlier days,
1583600	1587600	it's more revealing people who might be, you know, nice and regular people
1587600	1591680	being okay with horrible things as long as they exist in the abstract
1591680	1593360	and someone else is doing them.
1593920	1596400	They should have a bit less rights than you.
1597440	1598400	I'm not.
1598400	1599040	They should.
1599040	1603280	There's an episode of Who is America where Cohen disguises himself as an Israeli operative
1603280	1608560	and convinces this random Trump supporter that he's going to help him infiltrate an Antifa rally.
1608560	1610320	So he gets this guy to go along with it,
1610320	1614240	and once at the rally, they place little chips on some random protesters.
1614240	1617360	Then Cohen tells this guy that if he pushes the button,
1617360	1620320	it will take out these random Antifa terrorists.
1620320	1622640	There is a small explosive device.
1622640	1623440	Okay.
1623440	1627680	Small enough to create a fatal heart attack.
1628560	1630800	And he does it,
1630800	1634560	believing that he has actually taken the life of three people.
1635520	1638560	I've never participated in someone's death.
1638560	1642960	And he's fine with it because it happened off screen and someone else arranged it.
1643520	1646160	I wanted to see, would he actually do it?
1646800	1648320	The answer was yes.
1649040	1652960	He pushed the button and thought he had actually killed three human beings.
1653840	1654080	You know...
1654080	1656080	It's been a wonderful experience for me.
1656080	1657280	Look at the people here.
1657280	1659040	They are the lowest of the low.
1659040	1659680	I agree.
1659680	1661440	I've never seen so much sickness.
1661440	1664720	So I kind of had this half-serious thought after I saw the new film
1664720	1669440	that Borat is going to come back in another 15 years to an even worse America,
1669440	1674400	and he's going to have an even easier time getting normal people to say and do horrible things.
1674400	1679280	Let's say I wanted to finish lives of 20 gypsy.
1679280	1680640	Would this be enough?
1680640	1681600	Maybe the bigger one.
1681600	1683040	And the way things are headed, I don't know.
1683040	1684720	Nobody can tell the future.
1684720	1686560	And honestly, I'm not going to try to.
1686560	1692880	But all I can really take from this is Borat is good because the world is bad.
1692880	1697920	So maybe he's the hero we need right now, but he is certainly not the hero we should want.
1706000	1712720	Voltaire was right when he said those who can make you believe absurdities
1712800	1714880	can make you commit atrocities.
1724960	1725920	Ad read time.
