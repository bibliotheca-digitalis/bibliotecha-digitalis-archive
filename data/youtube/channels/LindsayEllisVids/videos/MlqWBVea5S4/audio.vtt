WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
Like, a little refinement of the nose.

00:02.960 --> 00:06.320
What's wrong with my nose? Do I look like a Jew?

00:06.320 --> 00:08.320
No, ma'am. Not at all.

00:08.320 --> 00:10.320
Phew!

00:10.320 --> 00:12.320
Borat's subsequent movie film,

00:12.320 --> 00:17.600
delivery of prodigious bribe to American regime for make-benefit once-glorious nation of Kazakhstan,

00:17.600 --> 00:21.840
is a superior film to its predecessor by basically every metric.

00:21.840 --> 00:24.560
Every scene in the film drives the plot forward or builds character,

00:24.560 --> 00:28.000
and it also actually has an emotional core with stakes.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.640
The same can't really be said about the first film, where Borat's mission is just to, you know,

00:32.640 --> 00:35.680
hang out and eventually he decides to kidnap Pamela Anderson.

00:35.680 --> 00:40.000
For the first time in my life, I was in love.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.240
The second film not only centers on the relationship between Borat and his daughter,

00:44.240 --> 00:48.560
it also actually has stakes. If he fails in his mission, he will be execute.

00:48.560 --> 00:57.280
If you do not deliver a bribe to get me into strongman club, you will be execute.

00:57.280 --> 01:01.840
It's no secret that Borat 1 was cobbled together in the edit, and the same holds true of the sequel.

01:01.840 --> 01:02.960
Walla Walla!

01:02.960 --> 01:07.280
But the filmmakers actually set out with an emotional core to the film and worked around that.

01:07.280 --> 01:10.960
But the remarkable thing to me isn't that the film has a much more cohesive structure,

01:10.960 --> 01:16.960
but rather that the joke itself hasn't aged poorly in the way that so much mid-2000s comedy has.

01:16.960 --> 01:24.480
And now, girls jumping on trampolines!

01:24.480 --> 01:28.960
Now, as to whether or not Borat's 1 or 2 can be considered problematic...

01:29.920 --> 01:33.440
I could not concentrate on what this old man was saying.

01:33.440 --> 01:37.040
...is up for some debate. I think it's a fair question to ask how much Borat,

01:37.040 --> 01:42.640
the lovable anti-Semite, helped to normalize ironic anti-Semitism in the way that South Park did.

01:42.640 --> 01:44.080
Oh yeah? Well, you're a stupid Jew!

01:44.080 --> 01:44.880
You're a Jew!

01:44.880 --> 01:46.400
Such a goddamn Jew, Matt!

01:46.400 --> 01:51.600
And ironic anti-Semitism has been the biggest gateway for actual anti-Semitism in this last

01:51.600 --> 01:54.960
decade, giving us a renaissance which we are presently living through.

01:54.960 --> 02:02.160
Kazakhstan, glorious country. It have a problem, too. Economic, social, and Jew.

02:02.160 --> 02:05.120
And I'm not really in a position to say that he's, you know,

02:05.120 --> 02:09.120
Jew-ing wrong. Like Mel Brooks, he is a polarizing figure within the Jewish community.

02:09.120 --> 02:15.440
At times, some critics have said my comedy risks reinforcing old stereotypes.

02:15.440 --> 02:19.760
But anyway, my thought when I first saw ads for the second Borat movie was to compare it to

02:19.760 --> 02:23.840
similar mid-2000s humor that I think on the whole has aged very poorly.

02:25.760 --> 02:28.960
So the method of coping with the state of the world back in 2006

02:28.960 --> 02:32.800
was to kind of act above it all, even when dealing with injustices.

02:32.800 --> 02:38.800
This guy does the best Ali G impersonation. I? I can't do it. Go on.

02:38.800 --> 02:39.200
I don't.

02:40.400 --> 02:44.400
Matt Stone and Trey Parker spent the whole 2000s explaining that things were fine, actually.

02:44.400 --> 02:45.440
Both sides bad.

02:45.520 --> 02:50.480
Welcome to the cable access televised debate between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.

02:50.480 --> 02:53.680
Avenue Q reassures us that things are only for now.

02:53.680 --> 02:54.800
And then there's Borat.

02:55.520 --> 03:01.360
This why Ministry of Information have decide to send me to U.S. and A,

03:01.360 --> 03:03.040
greatest country in the world.

03:03.760 --> 03:08.320
Borat's subsequent movie film is less comparable to Borat than it is to Fahrenheit 9-11.

03:08.320 --> 03:11.280
Borat's subsequent movie film is much more shrewd in its target,

03:11.360 --> 03:13.360
more overt with its politics.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.680
And the first one was still pretty overt.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.240
And it even ends with a call to action to vote,

03:22.240 --> 03:25.360
leaving people who were apparently oblivious to the political undertones

03:25.360 --> 03:28.720
that were always present in Borat confused and upset.

03:28.720 --> 03:32.480
It seems obvious to state out loud, but Borat was always political.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.760
The film spends a lot of time exposing American jingoism,

03:35.760 --> 03:39.920
tricking people into exposing their bigotries or their indifference to bigotry.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.680
Come on and make my day, Jew.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.720
But Borat isn't meant to be political in the way that

03:46.720 --> 03:50.320
Sacha Baron Cohen's later project, Who Is America, is.

03:50.320 --> 03:52.960
If you want to win, you show some skin.

03:53.840 --> 03:54.480
Okay.

03:54.480 --> 03:55.440
Okay, show it to me.

03:57.600 --> 04:03.280
Cohen's earlier characters were more cringe comedy that sometimes excel at being political.

04:03.280 --> 04:08.560
In terms of early Borat, what most people tend to think of is the scene from The Ali G Show

04:08.560 --> 04:13.440
in which he sings a song called In My Country There Is Problem, which features the lyrics.

04:20.720 --> 04:24.400
And from Borat the movie, you have memorable scenes like these frat guys.

04:29.360 --> 04:32.880
But that sort of thing actually doesn't take up that much runtime of the first film.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.160
Mostly it's this sort of thing.

04:38.960 --> 04:42.240
So Cohen uses this lovable anti-semitic buffoon.

04:42.240 --> 04:47.440
The people he's talking to think he's at best a malleable knife and at worst barely human.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.240
They let their guards down enough to say some truly heinous things.

05:01.200 --> 05:04.000
Borat gets people to say the quiet part loud.

05:08.800 --> 05:13.040
Shave that dead gum mustache off so you're not so conspicuous.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.200
So you look like maybe an Italian.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.880
So the thing that struck me about Borat's subsequent movie film was that the movie

05:18.880 --> 05:23.040
uses almost the exact same shtick as the now 14-year-old first movie.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.760
But that shtick rang very different then than it does today.

05:25.760 --> 05:29.280
And I think what kind of really struck me in a horrible way was that

05:29.280 --> 05:31.840
it's not even that the bit didn't age poorly,

05:31.840 --> 05:37.040
it's that it actually works better in 2020 than it did in 2006.

05:37.040 --> 05:40.720
And I think that's because Borat finally figured out his sense of purpose.

05:40.720 --> 05:46.320
We are part of the global community influencing elections around the world.

05:47.840 --> 05:51.520
Borat falls within this sort of prank reality tv genre

05:51.520 --> 05:54.080
that was really huge in the late 90s and 2000s.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.840
I'm following you.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.680
I just went in a drugstore and bought some condoms.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.440
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

06:01.440 --> 06:04.480
You have shows like the Tom Green show, Boiling Point,

06:04.480 --> 06:07.120
Crank Yankers, Trigger Happy TV,

06:07.120 --> 06:10.240
and Ashton Kutcher's Punch ran for 11 seasons.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.800
And most of these shows are primarily run on the premise of

06:12.800 --> 06:15.520
annoying slash scaring people to get a response.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.520
Whether it's shows like Sci-Fi Scare Tactics,

06:17.520 --> 06:19.600
wherein people are unknowingly placed in premises

06:19.600 --> 06:21.840
that mimic scenarios from horror films,

06:21.840 --> 06:24.880
or stupid shtick like this from Crank Yankers.

06:24.880 --> 06:28.880
I got mail, I got mail, I got mail, I got mail.

06:28.880 --> 06:31.040
And of course there was Tom Green.

06:31.680 --> 06:34.000
So to show my parents how much I love them,

06:34.080 --> 06:38.320
I've turned my parents' vehicle into more than just a vehicle.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.760
Dad can't take the bus to work,

06:39.760 --> 06:41.920
I'm gonna take the slut mobile to the bus stop.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.440
Wow, there's a lot of people at the bus stop.

06:43.440 --> 06:46.080
I hope my dad's not embarrassed by his slut mobile.

06:46.080 --> 06:47.680
But the difference between this stuff

06:47.680 --> 06:49.360
and what Sacha Baron Cohen was doing

06:49.360 --> 06:53.360
was Cohen's material had a more political edge.

06:53.360 --> 06:57.520
So which is the party of the homosexuals?

06:58.640 --> 07:01.360
They tend to go to the Democratic Party.

07:01.360 --> 07:03.360
So let's look at a quick history of Borat.

07:03.360 --> 07:05.600
Earlier iterations manifested in characters

07:05.600 --> 07:07.920
like Alexei Krikler from Moldova,

07:07.920 --> 07:11.360
and for a while Cohen had a character named Christo in the 90s.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.040
She wears too many clothes.

07:13.040 --> 07:16.160
But after 9-11, he evolved into Borat,

07:16.160 --> 07:18.640
and this Eastern European goon got folded

07:18.640 --> 07:20.880
into the Muslim world with Kazakhstan,

07:20.880 --> 07:22.560
having elements of Eastern Europe,

07:22.560 --> 07:24.320
that former Soviet aesthetic,

07:24.320 --> 07:26.000
and being a Muslim-majority country.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.200
Yaksimash.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.680
In USA, they treat their horses

07:29.680 --> 07:32.000
like we in Kazakhstan treat our women.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.840
Borat himself is not Muslim.

07:33.840 --> 07:35.520
He follows the way of the hawk.

07:35.520 --> 07:38.800
I am Kazakh. I follow the hawk.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.840
But he sometimes bears the brunt of Islamophobia.

07:41.840 --> 07:43.200
I see a lot of people, and I think,

07:43.200 --> 07:44.480
there's a dadgum Muslim.

07:44.480 --> 07:47.520
I wonder what kind of bomb he's got strapped to him.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.680
But while early Borat is occasionally

07:49.680 --> 07:51.120
revealing people's bigotry,

07:51.120 --> 07:53.200
it's more often it's just seeing

07:53.200 --> 07:54.640
how much people will put up with

07:54.640 --> 07:57.040
because they think it's this backwards yokel.

07:57.040 --> 07:58.480
In this episode about horses,

07:58.480 --> 08:01.440
he just talks at this woman for five minutes.

08:01.440 --> 08:06.560
We say in Kazakhstan that a horse is like man.

08:06.560 --> 08:14.720
We say if a horse walk, it's like when a man walk.

08:14.720 --> 08:23.440
If a horse is old, it's like if a man is old.

08:23.440 --> 08:24.560
And that's the joke.

08:24.560 --> 08:27.360
And that's most of L.A.G. era Borat.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.200
But there was more obvious political stuff

08:29.200 --> 08:31.280
in one episode called Democracy,

08:31.280 --> 08:33.200
there are plenty of choice moments.

08:33.200 --> 08:36.640
If people choose the Jews,

08:36.640 --> 08:38.720
will they go heaven or hell?

08:40.320 --> 08:42.800
I would have to say that they would go to hell.

08:42.800 --> 08:45.200
So the joke with Borat being so obviously

08:45.200 --> 08:47.280
unrepresentative of Kazakhstan

08:47.280 --> 08:49.360
is that people, Americans in particular,

08:49.360 --> 08:51.440
are so ignorant about foreign cultures

08:51.440 --> 08:54.080
that they just accept that this weird stereotype

08:54.080 --> 08:56.240
of a foreigner is legit.

08:56.240 --> 09:01.040
I think that the cultural differences are vast.

09:01.520 --> 09:04.080
And I think he's a delightful man.

09:04.080 --> 09:06.320
So 2006's Borat,

09:06.320 --> 09:08.720
Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit

09:08.720 --> 09:10.560
Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,

09:10.560 --> 09:12.240
aka simply Borat,

09:12.240 --> 09:15.120
grossed $262 million worldwide.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.520
It is the top grossing mockumentary in history

09:17.520 --> 09:20.720
and arguably the top grossing documentary in history,

09:20.720 --> 09:23.120
depending on how you define documentary,

09:23.120 --> 09:25.760
having earned twice as much as its nearest competitor,

09:26.400 --> 09:27.440
Fahrenheit 9-11.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.760
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:29.760 --> 09:32.720
The movie ended at least one marriage of a person involved.

09:32.720 --> 09:34.640
And I texted Pamela Anderson.

09:34.640 --> 09:35.520
I said, how did it go?

09:35.520 --> 09:36.240
What do you think?

09:36.240 --> 09:38.720
And she texted back, he's getting divorced.

09:39.360 --> 09:40.240
I was like, why?

09:40.240 --> 09:41.920
She goes, the movie.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.200
And I thought it was a joke.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.440
But then a few weeks later, they got divorced

09:45.440 --> 09:48.080
and they put as reason for divorce, Borat.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.800
And several lawsuits from people in the film.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.720
Are women your slaves in Russia?

09:53.680 --> 09:54.160
No.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.840
Do you have slaves here?

09:55.840 --> 09:56.080
We wish.

09:56.080 --> 09:56.880
No slaves.

09:56.880 --> 09:57.440
We wish.

09:57.440 --> 09:59.920
But let's examine Throw the Jew Down the Well.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.640
What do we gather from this scene?

10:08.640 --> 10:12.160
Are these people revealing their raging antisemitism?

10:20.320 --> 10:21.360
Well, I don't think so.

10:21.360 --> 10:24.160
I don't think that's the insidious thing about this scene.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.960
Rather, it reveals something much more casual.

10:27.520 --> 10:30.560
And there's something revelatory in that people are just willing to go with it.

10:34.960 --> 10:38.640
Borat was able to get an entire bar in Arizona to sing,

10:38.640 --> 10:40.400
Throw the Jew down the well.

10:41.600 --> 10:46.000
It did reveal people's indifference to antisemitism.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.840
But at the same time, I feel like the 2006 film reveals that Cohen,

10:49.840 --> 10:54.240
while joking about these things, he didn't take them that seriously.

10:54.240 --> 10:57.440
Up until recently, he rarely did interviews as himself.

10:57.440 --> 10:59.200
But in an interview in 2012,

10:59.200 --> 11:02.640
he doesn't seem too worried about antisemitism as a big problem.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.880
Do you worry about antisemitism now?

11:05.680 --> 11:06.000
No.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.120
I mean, you know, I don't think there's much antisemitism in England.

11:09.120 --> 11:14.400
I think relatively compared to certain other European countries, it's quite minor.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.800
He doesn't really take authoritarianism seriously.

11:16.800 --> 11:19.600
I had always found Colonel Gaddafi hilarious.

11:20.160 --> 11:23.120
But to me, the most remarkable scene is the one with these frat boys

11:23.200 --> 11:25.120
who pick up Borat while hitchhiking.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.840
Borat usually needs to get people to let their guards down.

11:27.840 --> 11:30.320
But in this scene, he doesn't need to goad them at all.

11:30.320 --> 11:33.200
He sits down and they just start going off.

11:33.200 --> 11:36.000
Our country, the minorities actually have more power.

11:36.560 --> 11:38.480
It would be better country if...

11:38.480 --> 11:39.920
Yes, it would be a better country.

11:39.920 --> 11:40.960
We should have slaves.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.360
And I think the read at the time was more like,

11:43.360 --> 11:46.880
isn't it surprising that some people are still like this?

11:46.880 --> 11:49.840
Like this is a residual phenomenon.

11:49.840 --> 11:50.960
We have the Jews.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.920
We have anybody that's against the mainstream.

11:53.920 --> 11:57.120
So at the time, most people kind of read the things in the film as

11:57.120 --> 12:02.480
revealing an ugly underbelly, but one that's on the outs.

12:02.480 --> 12:05.760
When in reality, this was more of a canary in the coal mine.

12:09.760 --> 12:12.960
So it's pretty obvious that the presidential election of 2016

12:12.960 --> 12:16.640
had a pretty big effect on Cohen, by his own admission.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.120
The show that I just did, Who's America,

12:19.920 --> 12:23.840
Donald Trump got elected and I was upset by it.

12:23.840 --> 12:24.960
I was so angry.

12:24.960 --> 12:31.440
I felt I actually have to channel that into some characters aimed at

12:32.400 --> 12:34.320
who could sit with some of those people.

12:34.320 --> 12:38.160
And Who's America is kind of a lot of the same shtick as the Ali G show,

12:38.160 --> 12:40.640
only this time it is pointedly very political.

12:40.640 --> 12:43.600
It's not a movie, it's a fucking terrorist mosque.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.920
Okay, let me address terrorism.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.360
Rest assured I share your concerns and we will do everything we can

12:49.360 --> 12:51.120
to protect these Muslims from it.

12:51.120 --> 12:54.560
And most of it was him getting conservatives to do ridiculous things

12:54.560 --> 12:56.560
that were sort of in line with their beliefs.

13:00.160 --> 13:03.120
But there were other notable influences on 2020 Borat

13:03.120 --> 13:05.200
outside of Cohen's own body of work.

13:05.200 --> 13:09.280
But I recently discovered that by wearing one of my signature articles of clothing,

13:09.840 --> 13:14.000
I may have unintentionally committed a hate crime against the Jewish people.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.080
And that's not good.

13:16.080 --> 13:21.200
A Comedy Central show called Nathan For You, which ran from 2013 to 2016.

13:21.200 --> 13:26.320
Where Cohen's Who is America genuinely does at times feel like entrapment.

13:26.320 --> 13:30.800
Is how to go undercover as a 15 year old quinceanera girl

13:30.800 --> 13:33.600
and to disarm the illegal Mexican.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.000
Nathan For You takes a much more nuanced approach

13:36.000 --> 13:38.960
than the mean-spirited punk style humors of the 2000s.

13:38.960 --> 13:42.480
The premise for the show is that host and creator Nathan Fielder,

13:42.480 --> 13:43.760
who in his own words,

13:43.920 --> 13:47.760
graduated from one of Canada's top business schools with really good grades.

13:48.320 --> 13:52.320
Presents himself as a sort of business consultant to real people across Los Angeles

13:52.320 --> 13:54.080
to help pick up their dying business.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.480
And the proposals he gives to his unknowing subjects

13:56.480 --> 14:00.960
are almost always so ludicrous that you expect people to immediately call his bluff.

14:00.960 --> 14:04.880
Have her specialize in a currently unrepresented group of homebuyer.

14:04.880 --> 14:07.600
The 50% of people who believe in ghosts.

14:07.600 --> 14:11.280
The plan, increase business by selling alcohol to minors.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.200
The plan, turn the Helio Cafe into the world's first parody Starbucks.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.480
But they rarely do.

14:18.480 --> 14:21.120
In fact, his targets usually embrace them,

14:21.120 --> 14:23.840
often with hilarious and rarely successful results.

14:23.840 --> 14:26.240
But the thing is, once they let their guard down around Nathan,

14:26.240 --> 14:28.320
they reveal themselves very easily.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.760
Overly intimate details.

14:30.480 --> 14:31.360
Your grandma said...

14:31.360 --> 14:32.560
Long time ago, yeah.

14:32.560 --> 14:35.200
You drink your grandson's pee if you get scared.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.120
Not grandson, any little kid.

14:38.080 --> 14:42.000
There have been times in my life when I was able to ejaculate in another position.

14:42.880 --> 14:45.280
But especially as I'm getting older and fatter,

14:45.280 --> 14:47.120
it's pretty much the only position that works for me.

14:48.240 --> 14:49.040
That makes sense.

14:50.640 --> 14:55.520
Nathan For You is the rare prank show that is not rooted in pissing people off for a reaction

14:55.520 --> 14:58.400
or annoying them, but instead trying to help them out.

14:58.400 --> 15:03.360
Usually the M.O. is intentionally trying to get a rise out of people by attacking basic impulses,

15:03.680 --> 15:06.480
or often taking advantage of social norms that

15:06.480 --> 15:10.640
people will keep going about their business when presented with something absurd.

15:10.640 --> 15:11.760
This suit is black.

15:14.400 --> 15:14.900
Okay.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.240
Um, I don't, I don't, I'm not...

15:18.240 --> 15:18.800
Not!

15:18.800 --> 15:22.480
But when the pranker presents themselves as a friend or neutral ear,

15:22.480 --> 15:27.360
like Nathan with his monotone normcore Canadian-ness...

15:27.360 --> 15:28.640
You know what I feel like?

15:28.640 --> 15:29.280
Oh yeah?

15:29.280 --> 15:30.400
A mother effin' beer.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.880
People reveal themselves more easily.

15:32.880 --> 15:35.360
See, for instance, the frat guy scene from the first film.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.200
Why the bitches in the old Russia?

15:37.200 --> 15:38.720
What's a bit of bitch to women?

15:38.720 --> 15:40.240
It's the fuckin' hoes, baby!

15:40.240 --> 15:40.800
I'm a hot woman.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.080
The fuckin' girls!

15:42.080 --> 15:45.360
Borat dropping into a CPAC event he wasn't invited to,

15:45.360 --> 15:48.000
and bursting into a crowded room of Republicans.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.960
I mean, it's funny, but it still falls a little flat compared to the real strengths of the film.

15:52.960 --> 15:56.720
Scenes like the dinner party in the first film or the QAnon guys in the second one,

15:57.440 --> 16:01.040
where Borat is being treated more like a simple foreigner or just a neutral entity,

16:01.040 --> 16:02.560
tend to be the most illuminating.

16:02.560 --> 16:07.040
What is more dangerous, this virus or the Democrat?

16:07.840 --> 16:08.560
Democrats.

16:08.560 --> 16:09.520
Democrats.

16:09.520 --> 16:14.000
And also like Borat, Nathan For You finds ways to incorporate deeply heavy subjects,

16:14.000 --> 16:16.640
for instance, Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism,

16:16.640 --> 16:20.160
in ways that are both revelatory and funny, like they work.

16:20.160 --> 16:25.680
This is a retail store and you don't learn about the darkest moments of history in a retail store.

16:25.680 --> 16:30.400
I beg to differ. The Gap had a whole campaign to make people aware of breast cancer.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.760
So I don't think there's a problem.

16:31.760 --> 16:32.960
It was actually AIDS.

16:32.960 --> 16:33.680
AIDS, sorry.

16:33.680 --> 16:38.000
So in order to work in today's mediascape, the intent of Borat has to change,

16:38.000 --> 16:40.720
not just because the character is super recognizable.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.560
Stupid foreign reporter.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.840
Yeah, kinda looks like you. You got the dark hair and the mustache.

16:45.840 --> 16:48.560
But because the first one came out when the internet was less

16:48.560 --> 16:51.920
widely used and everybody's racist aunt was on Facebook,

16:51.920 --> 16:56.800
the first one came out at a time when the bedrock of American horribleness

16:56.800 --> 16:59.920
was easier to ignore by most people.

16:59.920 --> 17:03.040
You are bigger than a woman. You are better than a woman.

17:03.040 --> 17:08.480
Do not let a woman ever, ever make you who you are.

17:08.480 --> 17:12.400
Also, unlike earlier Borat, this new one is really heavy on issues of gender,

17:12.400 --> 17:15.360
which is arguably the theme at the most forefront of the film.

17:15.360 --> 17:18.560
Most of the scenes revolve around Borat treating his daughter horribly.

17:18.560 --> 17:21.200
All I had left was my livestock.

17:21.280 --> 17:24.800
Two pigs, one cow, and a daughter.

17:24.800 --> 17:29.440
And people just kind of going along with it because, well, he's her dad, so that's fine.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.840
Or he'll say something deeply inappropriate.

17:31.840 --> 17:34.160
How much you think my daughter is worth?

17:36.560 --> 17:37.440
$500.

17:37.440 --> 17:38.480
Ooh, thank you.

17:40.880 --> 17:41.920
That's all I have.

17:41.920 --> 17:43.360
Fucking morons.

17:43.360 --> 17:46.160
And people just laugh along because it doesn't really bother them.

17:46.160 --> 17:49.200
Where is the no means yes section?

17:51.600 --> 17:54.000
The scenes with Borat getting services for Tutar,

17:54.000 --> 17:55.920
going into the crisis pregnancy center.

17:57.760 --> 18:02.800
I have a baby inside me and I want to take it out of me.

18:02.800 --> 18:06.640
Now that you know that I am her father, can we take it out now, please?

18:06.640 --> 18:08.720
God is the one who creates life.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.400
The plastic surgeon.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.840
I want a man who wants to make a sex attack on me.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.400
I think that would be Muslim.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.680
The makeover.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.760
What color is best for a racist family?

18:21.200 --> 18:22.000
I would stay right here.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.760
I wouldn't go any darker than a six or seven.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.400
Are some of the strongest stuff he's ever done,

18:26.400 --> 18:28.080
not just because of what they get on film,

18:28.080 --> 18:32.880
but because these scenes further the plot so much more than anything in the first Borat movie.

18:32.880 --> 18:36.640
Also, while we're here, Maria Bakalova's improv skills are amazing,

18:36.640 --> 18:39.520
especially considering English is like her third language.

18:39.520 --> 18:43.440
And the whole film, she's speaking Bulgarian and Cohen is speaking Hebrew.

18:44.400 --> 18:51.120
So in a lot of ways, not just with gender,

18:51.120 --> 18:54.640
subsequent movie film just has a much worse situation to work with.

18:54.640 --> 18:58.320
A culture feeling emboldened to say some really horrifying things,

18:58.320 --> 19:00.160
knowing that this is normalized now.

19:05.920 --> 19:08.800
It isn't just Borat being a straw man for comedic purposes,

19:08.800 --> 19:12.880
as much as it is revealing what people are willing to go along with.

19:12.880 --> 19:14.720
It's worth remarking that Janice,

19:14.720 --> 19:18.080
a babysitter who is tasked with looking after Tutor in the middle of the film,

19:18.080 --> 19:22.240
is one of the only people who shows genuine concern for Tutor's well-being.

19:22.240 --> 19:26.320
I will have the biggest titties in the whole world.

19:26.880 --> 19:30.160
Okay, so you're getting plastic surgery at 15.

19:30.160 --> 19:30.880
Do you want that?

19:32.640 --> 19:34.880
Although the ethics of this whole thing are a little iffy,

19:34.880 --> 19:39.760
apparently they told this poor woman that they were filming like a documentary on child brides.

19:39.760 --> 19:43.840
So for months she thinks that there's this poor girl out there

19:43.840 --> 19:48.000
being married off to this old man and then turns out it's for Borat.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.720
You're giving a little girl to a old man.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.440
I mean yeah, Cohen did give her church a bunch of money and

19:55.440 --> 19:59.040
fans did raise money for her after she lost her job due to COVID.

19:59.040 --> 20:00.240
But you know, yeah.

20:00.240 --> 20:06.320
Your virgin cannot bite and cannot suck your arms to a ball.

20:06.400 --> 20:10.240
But Janice, despite being positioned as sort of the emotional heart of the film,

20:10.240 --> 20:13.600
stands in stark contrast to basically everyone else.

20:13.600 --> 20:18.960
Subsequent movie film levels up from indifference to anti-Semitism to active participation.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.440
In the first movie, you get some light jokes.

20:21.440 --> 20:24.720
And of course, from the Ali G era, we got throw the Jew down the well.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.040
But by the time of subsequent movie film,

20:29.040 --> 20:32.400
they got a guy doing a Heil Hitler salute on camera.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.320
They got a plastic surgeon to say this.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.320
Do I look like a Jew?

20:37.040 --> 20:39.600
No. Jew would be like this.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.520
And a baker to do this.

20:41.520 --> 20:46.400
Jews will not replace us.

20:46.400 --> 20:50.160
They got a random store owner to high five Mexicans in cages.

20:50.160 --> 20:53.360
McDonald Trump, he cage Mexicans.

20:55.760 --> 20:59.520
In Borat, he says some wild things about his weird beliefs.

20:59.520 --> 21:02.800
And the joke is that people just kind of roll with it uncomfortably.

21:03.440 --> 21:04.560
I use white wine.

21:04.560 --> 21:05.840
No, I don't. You do.

21:05.840 --> 21:07.920
This is a very private thing.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.440
The host cleans the anus.

21:09.440 --> 21:14.160
But in subsequent movie film, in one scene, you have Borat worried about Jew venom.

21:14.160 --> 21:18.560
Use your venom on me and finish me. I am very depressed.

21:18.560 --> 21:23.360
And in the very next scene, you have QAnon guys talking about Democrats torturing children

21:23.360 --> 21:28.560
in order to drink their blood to extract their adrenochrome because of their Satan worship.

21:29.280 --> 21:33.200
Then they take that out of their adrenal glands.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.800
And then they drink their blood or that.

21:35.760 --> 21:40.400
The things real Americans believe now are wilder than anything Borat has ever

21:40.400 --> 21:41.440
fictionally believed.

21:41.440 --> 21:44.400
But at the same time, the film also kind of reveals their humanity.

21:44.400 --> 21:48.000
These guys believe such toxic things, but at the same time,

21:48.000 --> 21:52.720
they allow this guy who they think is just a wacky foreigner to live with them for five days.

21:52.720 --> 21:56.400
So I lived with them undercover for five days.

21:56.400 --> 22:00.960
Yeah, they thought that I was a foreign guy who didn't really understand much about coronavirus.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.800
And also they're patient with him.

22:02.800 --> 22:05.200
They're supportive of his relationship with his daughter.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.280
They correct him when they think he's wrong.

22:07.280 --> 22:09.840
We're looking at this and thinking, what?

22:09.840 --> 22:10.960
Yeah, it's a lie.

22:11.920 --> 22:14.720
That's it. It's a conspiracy theory.

22:14.720 --> 22:18.320
All this is true while they still believe the things that they do.

22:18.320 --> 22:22.560
They state with zero irony that Democrats should have fewer rights.

22:22.560 --> 22:25.120
They should have a bit less rights than you.

22:26.080 --> 22:27.680
I think they should.

22:27.680 --> 22:32.240
So I don't think the film offers up really any solutions as to what to do about this.

22:32.240 --> 22:34.720
But unlike the first Borat where we're just kind of

22:34.720 --> 22:37.600
laughing at the dark underbelly of American culture.

22:37.600 --> 22:40.560
What is the best gun to defend from a Jew?

22:43.840 --> 22:48.080
I would recommend either a nine millimeter or a 45.

22:48.080 --> 22:52.480
Subsequent movie films shows that this dark underbelly can no longer be ignored.

22:52.640 --> 22:53.680
Wah, wah, wah, wah.

22:54.720 --> 23:01.280
CNN projects Joseph R. Biden Jr. is elected the 46th president of the United States.

23:01.280 --> 23:05.920
Joe Biden has won the American presidential election.

23:05.920 --> 23:10.800
The third time is the charm for former Vice President Joe Biden.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.840
So we started working on this before the election, but

23:13.840 --> 23:16.800
after that lost week of doom scrolling.

23:16.800 --> 23:19.840
Doom scrolling. It means scrolling through doom.

23:19.840 --> 23:22.240
We decided to wait until after the election to finish it.

23:22.240 --> 23:25.920
I don't think anyone expected that this ugliness would go away when Trump did.

23:25.920 --> 23:28.400
But even braced for the worst case scenario,

23:28.400 --> 23:33.920
it really is genuinely shocking to see the abject denial of reality play out.

23:33.920 --> 23:36.720
I can announce to you right now in high confidence

23:36.720 --> 23:40.960
that Donald J. Trump has been reelected to the United States.

23:40.960 --> 23:43.360
So how do you laugh at exposing reality

23:43.920 --> 23:49.840
when half of the country doesn't even agree on what the other half considers reality to be?

23:49.840 --> 23:52.640
Cohen has said that he doesn't blame the QAnon guys.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.760
They are looking for a sense of security in an insecure world,

23:55.760 --> 24:00.000
and they've been fed this stream of lies by grifters like Alex Jones

24:00.000 --> 24:03.040
and a social mediascape that profits off of outrage.

24:03.040 --> 24:06.000
And he says he can't even dislike them. He just pities them.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.040
But again, looking at Borat's relationship to the QAnon guys,

24:09.040 --> 24:11.920
I don't think it's the worst thing in the world that the movie humanizes them.

24:14.640 --> 24:17.120
But they're clearly not evil people.

24:17.120 --> 24:19.920
After all, they help a stranger who they think is in need.

24:19.920 --> 24:23.840
But at the same time, they're kind of fine with this abstract idea

24:23.840 --> 24:25.840
of harming their political enemies.

24:25.840 --> 24:28.560
We can't do to them what we would like to do,

24:28.560 --> 24:32.560
because they, unfortunately, they have the same rights we do.

24:32.560 --> 24:36.880
And while, yes, you do have some fringe assholes calling for, you know, like, genocide,

24:36.880 --> 24:40.240
I think that most people like these don't want actual bloodshed.

24:40.800 --> 24:46.080
But they are kind of fine if someone else comes along and suggests it.

24:46.080 --> 24:48.160
What should we do with scientists?

24:48.160 --> 24:50.400
Let's hear it for gas them up like the Germans.

24:53.600 --> 24:54.800
And that's the danger.

24:54.800 --> 24:57.440
That's where it's really easy for people to gaslight you.

24:57.440 --> 25:00.400
These people were only joking or trying to get a rise out of people.

25:00.400 --> 25:01.600
They said, oh, he said something.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.880
When they show me, I'm laughing, they're laughing, everybody's laughing.

25:04.880 --> 25:08.160
Now when you said you wished Americans would sit up out of tension when you...

25:08.160 --> 25:10.400
I'm kidding, you don't understand sarcasm.

25:10.400 --> 25:11.760
Sounds interesting to me.

25:11.760 --> 25:15.040
I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you

25:15.040 --> 25:16.640
just to see what would happen.

25:16.640 --> 25:20.560
It's not shown in the film, but this rally actually ended really badly

25:20.560 --> 25:23.280
when the people in the audience figured out what was going on.

25:23.280 --> 25:25.200
Eventually, they booed Cohen off the stage.

25:28.800 --> 25:29.600
The doors are locked?

25:30.880 --> 25:34.080
And the organizers got up on stage and said that he said these racist things,

25:34.080 --> 25:35.200
and we don't condone that,

25:35.200 --> 25:39.200
and now they're going to try to trick everybody into thinking that we're the bad guys.

25:40.560 --> 25:43.840
We don't support anything that was up there and being said.

25:43.920 --> 25:47.520
I just want to let you all know that this is a conservative event.

25:47.520 --> 25:51.360
We believe in the Second Amendment, and we believe in equal rights for all.

25:51.360 --> 25:55.680
We do not discriminate for any reason, and that man is not welcome with us.

25:55.680 --> 26:00.960
They say this, and yet the film crew got so many of these people singing along

26:00.960 --> 26:05.760
and cheering on and going along with it until they realized what was going on.

26:05.760 --> 26:09.040
So with subsequent movie film, the Giuliani thing is funny,

26:09.040 --> 26:12.640
but it doesn't really tell us anything we didn't already know.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.640
She's 15. She's too old for you.

26:17.200 --> 26:20.000
The really poignant and honestly scary thing

26:20.000 --> 26:23.600
is instead of trying to provoke a certain reaction as Borat did in earlier days,

26:23.600 --> 26:27.600
it's more revealing people who might be, you know, nice and regular people

26:27.600 --> 26:31.680
being okay with horrible things as long as they exist in the abstract

26:31.680 --> 26:33.360
and someone else is doing them.

26:33.920 --> 26:36.400
They should have a bit less rights than you.

26:37.440 --> 26:38.400
I'm not.

26:38.400 --> 26:39.040
They should.

26:39.040 --> 26:43.280
There's an episode of Who is America where Cohen disguises himself as an Israeli operative

26:43.280 --> 26:48.560
and convinces this random Trump supporter that he's going to help him infiltrate an Antifa rally.

26:48.560 --> 26:50.320
So he gets this guy to go along with it,

26:50.320 --> 26:54.240
and once at the rally, they place little chips on some random protesters.

26:54.240 --> 26:57.360
Then Cohen tells this guy that if he pushes the button,

26:57.360 --> 27:00.320
it will take out these random Antifa terrorists.

27:00.320 --> 27:02.640
There is a small explosive device.

27:02.640 --> 27:03.440
Okay.

27:03.440 --> 27:07.680
Small enough to create a fatal heart attack.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.800
And he does it,

27:10.800 --> 27:14.560
believing that he has actually taken the life of three people.

27:15.520 --> 27:18.560
I've never participated in someone's death.

27:18.560 --> 27:22.960
And he's fine with it because it happened off screen and someone else arranged it.

27:23.520 --> 27:26.160
I wanted to see, would he actually do it?

27:26.800 --> 27:28.320
The answer was yes.

27:29.040 --> 27:32.960
He pushed the button and thought he had actually killed three human beings.

27:33.840 --> 27:34.080
You know...

27:34.080 --> 27:36.080
It's been a wonderful experience for me.

27:36.080 --> 27:37.280
Look at the people here.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.040
They are the lowest of the low.

27:39.040 --> 27:39.680
I agree.

27:39.680 --> 27:41.440
I've never seen so much sickness.

27:41.440 --> 27:44.720
So I kind of had this half-serious thought after I saw the new film

27:44.720 --> 27:49.440
that Borat is going to come back in another 15 years to an even worse America,

27:49.440 --> 27:54.400
and he's going to have an even easier time getting normal people to say and do horrible things.

27:54.400 --> 27:59.280
Let's say I wanted to finish lives of 20 gypsy.

27:59.280 --> 28:00.640
Would this be enough?

28:00.640 --> 28:01.600
Maybe the bigger one.

28:01.600 --> 28:03.040
And the way things are headed, I don't know.

28:03.040 --> 28:04.720
Nobody can tell the future.

28:04.720 --> 28:06.560
And honestly, I'm not going to try to.

28:06.560 --> 28:12.880
But all I can really take from this is Borat is good because the world is bad.

28:12.880 --> 28:17.920
So maybe he's the hero we need right now, but he is certainly not the hero we should want.

28:26.000 --> 28:32.720
Voltaire was right when he said those who can make you believe absurdities

28:32.800 --> 28:34.880
can make you commit atrocities.

28:44.960 --> 28:45.920
Ad read time.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.840

The copy says I'm supposed to tie this in with the content of the video.

29:03.680 --> 29:12.080
It's like Borat in 2000s nostalgia.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.840
Borat was 2006.

29:13.840 --> 29:15.920
The book takes place in 2007.

29:15.920 --> 29:16.720

29:55.680 --> 29:57.200
