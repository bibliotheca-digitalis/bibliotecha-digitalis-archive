0	6800	Wake up in the morning feeling like P.D.
6800	10800	The producers of The Hobbit are looking at shifting the film outside of New Zealand.
10800	15700	New Zealand's latest Hobbit movie is being threatened by an Australian union fight.
15700	19600	Members of Actors' Equity meet and agree not to accept work on The Hobbit.
19600	24600	All we are asking is for fair and equitable terms and conditions, minimum terms and conditions,
24600	26200	that our colleagues overseas enjoy.
26200	29800	Why do most of us live hand to mouth and have to work in other jobs to make ends meet?
29800	31800	It's not like that in other countries.
31800	32800	Are you anti-union?
32800	33800	Absolutely not.
33800	34800	Do you hate actors?
34800	35800	Absolutely not.
35800	37800	Meanwhile, everyone goes apeshit.
44800	49800	The dispute has forced US film giant Warner Bros. to look at moving the production away from New Zealand.
49800	53800	And if the boycott goes nuclear, production of The Hobbit will move to Eastern Europe.
53800	56800	Warner Bros.' key concern was industrial unrest.
56800	61800	No one had even thought in a million years that this movie was going to leave the country.
61800	68800	It is your moment to let your voice be heard and I know your message to the studio will not go unnoticed.
68800	73800	To you, Warner Bros., that you are going to make a fortune out of this film if you film it in New Zealand.
73800	76800	So what we've got is the actors now in full retreat.
76800	81800	New Zealand's Prime Minister has held a crisis meeting with Warner Bros. studio executives.
81800	84800	Executives from Warner's fly in to nut out a deal with the government.
84800	89800	So it now seems increasingly likely that the government will actually change labour laws.
89800	95800	An agreement has been reached between New Zealand, the New Zealand government and Warner Bros.
95800	97800	New Zealand has saved its Hobbits.
97800	104800	To give film producers like Warner Bros. the confidence they need to produce their movies in New Zealand.
111800	125800	What happened in 2010 to your memory? How is this framed to you?
135800	139800	You know, The Hobbit kind of in some ways finished telling the story.
139800	144800	It finished telling the narrative story but it sort of finished telling the business story in a way.
144800	150800	Alright, this is a very political process.
150800	160800	A law was passed essentially to help tie studios over and bring them here that in effect lessened the rights of performers.
160800	165800	It was a law which controlled union activity.
166800	171800	It has essentially allowed people who want to exploit others to go ahead and exploit them.
171800	177800	For actors especially but also for crew that began to take place pretty much after The Hobbit law happened.
177800	189800	I saw the Employment Contracts Act as being one that favoured employers to the point where employees were having fewer and fewer rights.
189800	194800	Okay, so the more I learned about this whole Hobbit thing the more complicated I realised it was.
194800	202800	So we've got a visual aid to help us understand what actually happened in 2010 and onwards.
202800	212800	And yeah, so this is basically the story of how an American Fortune 500 company swooped in to exploit a labour dispute to the benefit of millions and also change the laws of a sovereign nation.
212800	219800	They don't want extra subsidies, all this conspiracy theory nonsense about them wanting more money and more subsidies, no.
219800	227800	Aha, well first we need to understand why there was even a labour dispute for Warner Brothers to exploit in the first place.
229800	234800	The Lord of the Rings trilogy was unique in film history.
234800	242800	I was eight when Lord of the Rings came out, the first Lord of the Rings, and it completely changed my life to be honest.
242800	247800	I still love them dearly, the trilogy, they still really mean a lot to me coming back to them.
247800	257800	With the added element of being something set in New Zealand, filmed in New Zealand and whose New Zealand-ness is kind of intrinsic to what makes it great.
257800	264800	To a degree those first Lord of the Rings films, especially I would argue Fellowship of the Ring, couldn't have been made anywhere else or by anyone else.
264800	271800	I mean Peter Jackson was very inspiring of someone in fact who could make films, keep making films in New Zealand, so that was certainly a goal for me.
271800	274800	Hi, I'm Jonathan King, I'm a New Zealand filmmaker.
274800	278800	I've been working in film for about 20 years I guess.
278800	280800	I wrote and directed a film called Black Sheep.
281800	283800	No, I've only worked in New Zealand.
283800	289800	New Zealanders are very proud of Lord of the Rings and the Middle Earth thing, but also a little bit sheepish about it too.
289800	292800	It's like, it's not all we do you know.
292800	298800	And it's funny how like Flight of the Conchords even, if you think about the posters on the office wall, are kind of poking fun at that straight away.
298800	302800	So even New Zealanders are a little bit embarrassed about that, it's like hey, we're not just scenery.
302800	304800	What about another exclamation mark?
306800	307800	I don't think that's necessary.
307800	311800	The Lord of the Rings helped put the New Zealand film industry on the map in a big way.
311800	319800	And part of the reason why New Zealand was an attractive location for filming was the unions were far weaker than the ones in, say, the United States.
319800	328800	So sooner or later the actors of New Zealand, having helped create the magic of Lord of the Rings, were bound to start wanting at least equal treatment to their counterparts in England and the US.
328800	335800	All we are asking is for fair and equitable terms and conditions, minimum terms and conditions, that our colleagues overseas enjoy.
338800	339800	Yeah, good luck with that.
344800	355800	When we have overseas companies, overseas production companies, overseas studios, come to New Zealand and I believe to Australia, they're doing it to save money.
355800	360800	So this was sort of the world in which this whole fiasco exploded.
360800	369800	I'm Rajnil Singh, I'm a filmmaker and I've been working in the New Zealand film and television industry for the last 12 years, I believe.
369800	376800	By international terms, we are not really a film industry here in New Zealand.
376800	379800	We are a film service.
379800	383800	We do require these international productions to survive.
384800	396800	If we don't, the perception amongst the New Zealand film workers is that 90% of the people will just lose their jobs instantly and will not be able to continue working.
397800	415800	Going back a few years before The Hobbit, we essentially had a number of problematic incidents in our local film and television industry regarding how actors, specifically actors, but it applies to crew as well, have been treated by local productions.
415800	430800	It was one of the elements that essentially had necessitated the formation of actors' equity and had started getting actors really thinking about organising themselves and looking after themselves and fighting their own battles which nobody else was fighting.
430800	440800	Nobody in The Lord of the Rings who was an actor working and living here in New Zealand got any residuals from that.
441800	452800	When The Hobbit came along, my understanding is that Peter Jackson was responsible for ensuring that we did and that was the first major concession we had.
452800	473800	That, I think, was a show of good faith by Peter Jackson, but clearly it didn't match the Screen Actors Guild conditions of return because we were the troublesome group down at the bottom of the world who really should just know our place.
474800	485800	So the local Actors Guild, backed, some might say pushed, by the Australian Actors Union decide that The Hobbit might be a good high-profile test case for us to bargain for better labour conditions. So let's do that!
485800	505800	The first I ever heard about the industrial action which was sold to us as an industrial action that was international with English actors' equity, SAG involved, the MEAA in Australia and locally.
505800	515800	It was announced in the media during the press release at which point all hell broke loose.
515800	522800	Let go home! Let go home! Let go home! Let go home! Let go home!
522800	524800	Why did you call for a boycott?
524800	530800	Actors' Equity then releases a stop work order for actors who've been cast in The Hobbit until fairer pay conditions can be agreed upon.
530800	544800	Tonight's meeting, New Zealand Actors' Equity members have overwhelmingly resolved that its delegation meet with the producers of The Hobbit to hold negotiations in good faith on the terms and conditions for performers working on the production.
544800	546800	It isn't a boycott. It's not a boycott.
546800	549800	Let go home! Let go home!
549800	553800	These are the lives of everybody in the New Zealand film industry. Why are you targeting The Hobbit?
553800	557800	We have never said there's a boycott. It is not in any of our information.
557800	560800	Warner Brothers really does not like this.
560800	567800	It's a question of confidence in our industrial relations and the damage was done within a week of the blacklist going on.
567800	576800	None of the other guilds that run the industry, crew, producers, directors, editors, were informed about this.
576800	585800	So there was somebody in my extended family who came to me and said, you do realise, John, that by not signing you're putting my work at risk as well.
585800	604800	If you are working as a set builder and you've got somebody over here from America who is doing the same work and they are earning twice what you're earning for doing work that you are very good at doing, at least if not a better standard than this other person, is that alright with you?
604800	616800	The opposition to the industrial action across the board did not come from people thinking that actors' equity was asking too much.
616800	623800	It was nothing to do with that. It was a genuine, genuine fear of what Warner was going to do to retaliate.
623800	633800	The industrial action has the support of actors' unions around the world and big names like Karl Urban come out in support of it.
633800	639800	But local crews in Peter Jackson are terrified that this will scare Warner Brothers away from New Zealand altogether.
639800	645800	And they are frankly worried because the actors bought a completely frivolous action.
645800	660800	Now if they've done that once, what happens in a year's time when Warner Brothers have spent $250 million, they're halfway through the film and the actors decide to have some fun again. It's like it could happen all over again. They have no confidence.
660800	666800	They then came back with the argument, well we'll just go somewhere else, we'll go and do it in Hungary or Poland or somewhere like that.
666800	668800	Social media exploded with fighting.
668800	673800	And there were protests in the streets about what actors' equity was doing.
674800	682800	Seeing Weta Workshop staff and Richard Taylor and everyone else marching down the streets in Wellington.
682800	687800	The idea became, hey the Hobbit's going to happen, but it could happen in Ireland or it could happen in the Czech Republic or whatever.
687800	697800	And I think the New Zealand public kind of poo-pooed that and didn't believe, I think we felt such ownership of it that no one believed for a second that it would go anywhere else.
697800	706800	And I think anyone who knows much about international filmmaking is that it could quite easily have gone anywhere else.
706800	712800	There were these really nasty divisive forces at work.
712800	727800	That's what was probably most unfortunate about the way it played out, is it went from one group pushing for better workers' rights, suddenly became the film's about to go away, don't worry if we just change these labour laws, now we can save the film.
727800	730800	I think by that stage equity had lost.
730800	732800	And then politicians were like, hey.
736800	740800	In New Zealand there are two major parties, left and right.
740800	743800	Labour had been replaced by a national, a right-wing government.
743800	756800	To encourage that business to come to New Zealand, the government of Prime Minister John Key had in place a tax trade-off.
756800	765800	The impact of this will mean an additional rebate for the Hobbit movies of up to US $7.5 million per picture.
765800	769800	John Key also happens to be a former Merrill Lynch executive.
769800	774800	They did everything but literally roll out the red carpet for Warners.
774800	777800	Warner Brothers flew in on jets and met overnight with the Prime Minister.
777800	783800	There were lobbyists that were flown down here, there were meetings, there were dinners.
783800	791800	Suddenly the message became, we've saved the Hobbit in New Zealand, and the Prime Minister was able to say, I have saved, by just rewriting a few labour laws, I've been able to save the Hobbit in New Zealand.
792800	794800	You couldn't tell who was more excited to meet who.
794800	799800	Whether Warners were excited to have a state dinner with the leader of a sovereign nation,
799800	804800	or whether the leader of a sovereign nation was excited about meeting some studio execs.
804800	807800	It was quite farcical, it wasn't so serious at the time.
807800	812800	The government is determined to use the opportunity that the Hobbit movies present
812800	817800	to highlight New Zealand as a great place to visit, as well as a great place to do business.
817800	822800	So John Key rushes legislation through Parliament clarifying that film workers are independent contractors,
822800	829800	removing their collective bargaining rights, and also giving Warner Brothers tens of millions in tax subsidies and offset marketing costs.
829800	836800	It's good to have the uncertainty over, and to have everyone now full steam ahead on producing these two movies.
836800	846800	This meant that they were making even more money out of it, because they were paying us less, and they had this deal going on.
846800	854800	So I think it was certainly cynical on the Prime Minister of the day's heart.
854800	861800	It has to do with people with money making more money for themselves, and blow you people down there.
861800	864800	If you don't want to do the job, clear off, I'll get somebody else who does.
864800	874800	Now I have nothing against people making money, but what I object to is that they make money off the poverty of other people.
874800	877800	They create poverty.
877800	880800	People who work in the film industry are freelance contractors.
880800	884800	Freelance contractors cannot bargain collectively.
884800	890800	And inequity basically means grossly unfair and immoral.
890800	895800	And such contracts, to my way of thinking, are exactly that.
895800	907800	I think the Hobbit law was one of the most dangerously iniquitous pieces of legislation to pass through our Parliament.
915800	920800	This ties into a much bigger discussion about the way we consume media.
920800	932800	When you discover that something like, say, The Hobbit was dogged by a massive fallout between one American studio, a sovereign government, and its people
932800	938800	because an underhanded change in its labor laws was written to benefit one production to the tune of tens of millions,
938800	944800	whether you like it or not, it becomes exceedingly difficult to separate the merry adventures of Bilbo and his dwarvish cabal
944800	949800	from the fact that the films are a benchmark case in how to upend an entire film industry.
952800	955800	The consequences from the Hobbit law have been mixed.
955800	958800	In effect, it kind of mirrors what we're seeing in movies as a whole.
958800	962800	There are plenty of resources, but they are going to fewer and bigger productions,
962800	965800	almost all of them international, by which I mean American.
965800	971800	Production decreased, some even say withered, in the years that followed, in part because of bad publicity surrounding the law.
971800	978800	But the New Zealand film industry did double their revenue in 2016, thanks to James Cameron's 27 Avatar sequels being filmed there.
978800	986800	Absolute winners of this law is international film productions coming to New Zealand.
986800	991800	So that's great in that it incentivizes huge productions to be here,
991800	996800	but I don't think those incentives in themselves grow our industry.
996800	1003800	And I think the New Zealand public was sold the fact that these incentives will also grow the industry at the same time,
1003800	1005800	and I don't necessarily think that's true.
1005800	1008800	You only have to go to the IMDB and search for American films shot in New Zealand,
1008800	1014800	and the list will shock you, because I think people don't actually understand the sheer number of blockbusters that are shot here.
1014800	1018800	So personally, as a New Zealand filmmaker, an independent filmmaker,
1018800	1024800	I would love to have seen our own government finding ways to stimulate our own industry.
1024800	1029800	These enormous productions in New Zealand, and the subsidies that have brought these enormous productions here,
1029800	1033800	offer employment to an awful lot of people who are excited about working on those things.
1033800	1037800	But we still have a situation where those enormous productions are few and far between.
1037800	1041800	Essentially, international film companies and studios are coming down here,
1041800	1050800	making films cheaper and being able to worry less about blowback for exploitation of workers than they are in L.A.
1058800	1062800	There are a lot of artistic choices in The Hobbit that exist completely outside of the studios
1062800	1066800	and the paratext of the law that also kind of cheapens Lord of the Rings in hindsight.
1066800	1070800	Little details like Thorin charging to the ringwraith theme,
1074800	1077800	Tauriel and Kili's poorly written rushed relationship,
1077800	1080800	Legolas and Gimli becoming friends is no longer kind of a first,
1080800	1084800	or the orcs what move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed.
1084800	1088800	An army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed.
1088800	1091800	Wow, Fellowship Gandalf, that kind of seems like not a big deal,
1091800	1094800	considering you did not seem bothered by that very thing in The Hobbit.
1094800	1098800	And the genuine disinterest the films have in characters that are actually in the books.
1098800	1101800	Tying these movies in, both internally and in its marketing,
1101800	1105800	so closely with Lord of the Rings just cheapens both trilogies.
1105800	1113800	It tries to replicate things from the trilogy without any of the soul or the verve or the ambition of those ones.
1113800	1117800	It becomes like a machine. It feels like a machine when you're watching it.
1117800	1122800	It started to dampen what was so special about Lord of the Rings.
1122800	1126800	There's still these films that hold this extremely dear place in my heart.
1126800	1131800	I can still quote it and come back to it and cry my eyes out.
1131800	1137800	You feel differently taking them in now. It's not that wonder, it's nostalgia now.
1137800	1140800	I think it's natural that films with huge impact and influence,
1140800	1143800	people critically re-evaluate them later. That's natural.
1143800	1146800	Any film that at the time is regarded as great,
1146800	1150800	eventually undergoes some sort of cycle of re-evaluation.
1151800	1158800	It's a case with The Hobbit where these are films that feed off of Lord of the Rings so intensely
1158800	1162800	that you can't help but go back to the source material and think, hey, what went wrong here?
1162800	1165800	In the light of The Hobbit films, people view Lord of the Rings,
1165800	1168800	perhaps not negatively but definitely in a far more critical lens.
1168800	1175800	People see what has become overly saccharine or overly homogenised in The Hobbit
1175800	1179800	and it bleeds into Lord of the Rings because that's where it was established.
1179800	1182800	That's where the seed was planted and grew.
1182800	1188800	And it's a shame really. It's a case of too much, like too many cooks spoiling the broth.
1188800	1193800	There's too much Lord of the Rings in the world now.
1193800	1196800	It's not to say that Middle Earth fatigue wasn't inevitable.
1196800	1199800	Dildo baggins!
1199800	1202800	Most properties and genres go through cycles of boom and fatigue,
1202800	1206800	but the genuinely soul-sucking and cynical way these movies got made didn't help.
1206800	1208800	The Hobbit movies weren't an end point either.
1208800	1212800	They were an opening act for all the ways we can run the world of Tolkien into the ground.
1212800	1217800	And the only reason it hasn't happened yet is because the Tolkien estate clung to those rights with an iron fist.
1217800	1223800	But everyone has their price, and now Amazon is producing the most expensive television show in history
1223800	1226800	based on the world of Tolkien, specifically the Lord of the Rings.
1226800	1229800	Amazon has already committed a billion dollars to five seasons,
1229800	1234800	all this less than two decades after an Oscar-winning trilogy based on these books.
1234800	1239800	And the ironic thing? The island nation of New Zealand will likely have nothing to do with it.
1243800	1246800	Our life experiences affect how we view and consume media,
1246800	1249800	and it goes without saying that most of us change between childhood and adulthood.
1249800	1252800	But the media we consume as children is made by adults who,
1252800	1255800	intentionally or not, imbue media with their own worldviews.
1255800	1258800	A child watching The Simpsons will watch this scene,
1258800	1261800	Some things will be dealt with at a later date.
1261800	1262800	If at all.
1262800	1264800	And it will go completely over their heads.
1264800	1267800	But an adult watching the scene knows the context, gets the reference.
1267800	1272800	How many of you had to deal with being called a poo or that being referenced?
1272800	1275800	As an opinion on the controversy the scene is referencing,
1275800	1277800	expects others to have an opinion about it.
1277800	1281800	But knowing the full context of an opinion being expressed is one thing.
1281800	1286800	It's another thing altogether to learn that people who made your favorite media weren't being treated fairly.
1286800	1292800	Once the films had been made and were being released,
1292800	1297800	we were all invited to the opening in Wellington.
1297800	1301800	The third one was going to be premiered in Los Angeles.
1301800	1309800	At this premiere there was no invitation sent to any of the New Zealand actors.
1309800	1317800	And it could be that we had been somewhat overly vocal about the so-called Hobbit law.
1317800	1322800	So a lot of people on Facebook were asking me,
1322800	1324800	Oh, will we see you at the premiere, John?
1324800	1327800	Will you be on the red carpet in Los Angeles?
1327800	1331800	I then put on Facebook a little post saying,
1331800	1334800	Oh, by the way, for everybody who's been asking,
1334800	1339800	the Kiwis haven't been invited for budgetary reasons.
1339800	1341800	So no, I won't be there.
1341800	1347800	Suddenly I had people from the production company getting in touch saying,
1347800	1351800	We understand you're really, really angry,
1351800	1356800	but you shouldn't be expressing your anger on public media.
1356800	1359800	And I said, Well, hang on a minute.
1359800	1363800	There was nothing in what I said that indicated anger.
1363800	1365800	Whatsoever.
1365800	1371800	I just said what I had been quoted from my agent from the studio.
1371800	1374800	And they said, This isn't good for business.
1374800	1375800	All that kind of thing.
1375800	1377800	We're not happy with it at all.
1377800	1384800	Next thing I hear is that we are going to the premiere in Los Angeles.
1384800	1388800	Nobody from Warners met us.
1388800	1390800	Nobody from Warners greeted us.
1390800	1394800	Nobody from Warners said anything to us.
1394800	1401800	There was absolutely no contact with anybody from the studio whatsoever.
1403800	1405800	Absolutely extraordinary.
1405800	1409800	And we thought, Boy, we must really have pissed them off.
1409800	1413800	If that is not the case, then I would be delighted to hear that.
1413800	1415800	People like Peter Jackson were fine.
1415800	1421800	The other actors, the English actors, the big names, they were all fine.
1421800	1423800	There was no problem there.
1423800	1429800	But nobody from the studio said tickety-boo to any of us from New Zealand.
1433800	1435800	I've always been a big fan of Kesha.
1439800	1443800	The music of her early years was a gateway for me letting myself like Top 40.
1443800	1446800	I was a huge fan of her aesthetic, of this flagrant, shameless image.
1446800	1447800	It was fun.
1447800	1451800	It let you feel like being broke and young and partying all the time was aspirational.
1451800	1455800	It felt like a pass not to care about the world, at least as long as her music was on.
1455800	1464800	But then years pass, and it comes out that all of those Party Girl songs were made during years of emotional and physical abuse by her producer.
1464800	1470800	That the Party Girl image was a construct that she didn't really have control over and maybe didn't even really like.
1471800	1478800	And knowing that, in a world where otherwise I probably still would have played the hell out of those early Kesha years music, it just doesn't feel the same anymore.
1478800	1481800	I want to go back to the way her music made me feel back in 2010.
1481800	1484800	Just unapologetic and dumb and glittery.
1484800	1487800	But even though I want to, I can't.
1491800	1494800	Because now I know the circumstances under which that music was made.
1494800	1501800	And if you watch a piece of media, had an emotional reaction, whatever it was, and then learned that the context involved a certain level of exploitation,
1501800	1505800	it changes the way you view the media, whether you want it to or not.
1505800	1513800	Maybe Harper Lee's old age and deteriorating mental state were exploited by her publisher in order to knock out a quick sequel to an American classic before the door closed.
1513800	1520800	Maybe Kesha's Party Girl image was carefully crafted by a sexually abusive, iron-fisted producer who had 100% control of her public image.
1521800	1530800	Maybe a lot of the art you consume, or even that you love, only exists because a person, or people, or an entire island nation were exploited by more powerful business interests.
1533800	1535800	But, that's capitalism.
1535800	1550800	As actors, we understand that there are many ways of going about business.
1550800	1561800	Whether we're talking about the practical, financial aspects of our industry, or whether we're talking about the business of what we as actors do within that industry.
1562800	1570800	Where rights for women, rights for workers, start and end.
1570800	1574800	And I think human dignity is really, really important.
1574800	1582800	And I think that there are employers around the world who exploit people.
1582800	1592800	That is why the Screen Actors Guild, and Actors Equity in England, Australia and New Zealand, and we here are directly tied to the Australians.
1592800	1595800	Why we exist.
1595800	1602800	To look after the interests of people so that we don't fall under the thumb of the bully boys.
1602800	1608800	So that we are respected as people and as artists.
1608800	1616800	And that our views are no less worthy because we haven't got fat wallets.
1616800	1619800	Profit-driven exploitation doesn't always have the last word.
1619800	1625800	Kesha's still locked into a contract with the label that enabled her abuser, but at least he's not there anymore.
1625800	1629800	And there are elements of the Hobbit law that are up for repeal now that Labour is back in power.
1629800	1634800	Particularly the bit about outlawing collective bargaining, which to me is the most heinous part.
1634800	1639800	But these are only half measures, particularly the Hobbit law repeal, which itself is no guarantee.
1639800	1647800	I reached out to several people affiliated with the various New Zealand film guilds, but none are making comment to the media about the law until the law gets repealed.
1647800	1649800	If it does get repealed.
1649800	1669800	How do you go on when in your heart you begin to understand there is no going back?
1669800	1681800	If you discover that a brand or a company, like a bank or something, did something bad or unethical, it isn't surprising.
1681800	1685800	People just kind of shrug and go, yep, that's how banks roll.
1685800	1689800	And maybe you'll close your account and go to a different bank.
1689800	1699800	But the reality is that you probably don't care enough to even do that much, because unethical multinational corporations doing terrible things to people in the name of profit is just kind of the world.
1699800	1702800	You don't have the brain space to care about all of them.
1702800	1705800	We pay monopolistic cable companies for internet access.
1705800	1709800	We have 401ks run by morally bankrupt hedge fund managers that we'll never know.
1709800	1718800	We still buy iPhones, we still buy cheap clothes while paying vague glib lip service to the knowledge that people are being exploited somewhere so we in America can boss Siri around.
1718800	1726800	In some ways we engage with a multitude of brands and corporations every day that someone somewhere is getting exploited by, often cruelly so.
1726800	1729800	But media is different. Media is personal.
1729800	1733800	Media is designed to provide an escape, to stir emotions, to inspire.
1733800	1737800	The film industry is by no means the industry with the highest incidence of sexual harassment.
1737800	1744800	But people care more about it when it gets exposed in the film industry, because the film industry creates media that hits emotional nerves.
1744800	1749800	Even when we find out that something we loved was made by someone who said or did bad things, it's like betrayal.
1749800	1756800	When people ask whether it's moral to separate art from the artist, or in this case, product from the multinational conglomerate,
1756800	1761800	what they're really asking is, how can I go back to consuming media like I did when I was a kid,
1761800	1766800	when the most context I had or cared about was who the author of my favorite book was,
1766800	1772800	or why I like this actor, or what Kesha's real name and birthday is.
1772800	1775800	But as an adult, you're expected to be an ethical consumer of media.
1775800	1781800	And it's somewhat inevitable that some people resent that, because consuming media the way children do is comforting.
1781800	1784800	Consuming media like The Hobbit as an adult is complicated.
1784800	1787800	And in this day and age, it's hard to do so innocently.
1787800	1790800	And I totally understand wanting to return to that innocence.
1790800	1794800	And I don't really have an argument against that worldview other than...
1794800	1796800	that's adulthood.
1797800	1800800	Well, I'm back.
1802800	1805800	Thank you.
1832800	1835800	Thank you.
