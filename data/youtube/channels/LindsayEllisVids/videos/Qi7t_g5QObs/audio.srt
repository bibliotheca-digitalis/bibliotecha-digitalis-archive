1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
Wake up in the morning feeling like P.D.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,800
The producers of The Hobbit are looking at shifting the film outside of New Zealand.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,700
New Zealand's latest Hobbit movie is being threatened by an Australian union fight.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,600
Members of Actors' Equity meet and agree not to accept work on The Hobbit.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,600
All we are asking is for fair and equitable terms and conditions, minimum terms and conditions,

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,200
that our colleagues overseas enjoy.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,800
Why do most of us live hand to mouth and have to work in other jobs to make ends meet?

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,800
It's not like that in other countries.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,800
Are you anti-union?

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800
Absolutely not.

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,800
Do you hate actors?

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
Absolutely not.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,800
Meanwhile, everyone goes apeshit.

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,800
The dispute has forced US film giant Warner Bros. to look at moving the production away from New Zealand.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,800
And if the boycott goes nuclear, production of The Hobbit will move to Eastern Europe.

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,800
Warner Bros.' key concern was industrial unrest.

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,800
No one had even thought in a million years that this movie was going to leave the country.

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,800
It is your moment to let your voice be heard and I know your message to the studio will not go unnoticed.

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,800
To you, Warner Bros., that you are going to make a fortune out of this film if you film it in New Zealand.

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,800
So what we've got is the actors now in full retreat.

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,800
New Zealand's Prime Minister has held a crisis meeting with Warner Bros. studio executives.

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,800
Executives from Warner's fly in to nut out a deal with the government.

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,800
So it now seems increasingly likely that the government will actually change labour laws.

24
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:35,800
An agreement has been reached between New Zealand, the New Zealand government and Warner Bros.

25
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,800
New Zealand has saved its Hobbits.

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:44,800
To give film producers like Warner Bros. the confidence they need to produce their movies in New Zealand.

27
00:01:51,800 --> 00:02:05,800
What happened in 2010 to your memory? How is this framed to you?

28
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,800
You know, The Hobbit kind of in some ways finished telling the story.

29
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,800
It finished telling the narrative story but it sort of finished telling the business story in a way.

30
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Alright, this is a very political process.

31
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:40,800
A law was passed essentially to help tie studios over and bring them here that in effect lessened the rights of performers.

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,800
It was a law which controlled union activity.

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,800
It has essentially allowed people who want to exploit others to go ahead and exploit them.

34
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,800
For actors especially but also for crew that began to take place pretty much after The Hobbit law happened.

35
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:09,800
I saw the Employment Contracts Act as being one that favoured employers to the point where employees were having fewer and fewer rights.

36
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Okay, so the more I learned about this whole Hobbit thing the more complicated I realised it was.

37
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:22,800
So we've got a visual aid to help us understand what actually happened in 2010 and onwards.

38
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:32,800
And yeah, so this is basically the story of how an American Fortune 500 company swooped in to exploit a labour dispute to the benefit of millions and also change the laws of a sovereign nation.

39
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:39,800
They don't want extra subsidies, all this conspiracy theory nonsense about them wanting more money and more subsidies, no.

40
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Aha, well first we need to understand why there was even a labour dispute for Warner Brothers to exploit in the first place.

41
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,800
The Lord of the Rings trilogy was unique in film history.

42
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:02,800
I was eight when Lord of the Rings came out, the first Lord of the Rings, and it completely changed my life to be honest.

43
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,800
I still love them dearly, the trilogy, they still really mean a lot to me coming back to them.

44
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:17,800
With the added element of being something set in New Zealand, filmed in New Zealand and whose New Zealand-ness is kind of intrinsic to what makes it great.

45
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:24,800
To a degree those first Lord of the Rings films, especially I would argue Fellowship of the Ring, couldn't have been made anywhere else or by anyone else.

46
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,800
I mean Peter Jackson was very inspiring of someone in fact who could make films, keep making films in New Zealand, so that was certainly a goal for me.

47
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Hi, I'm Jonathan King, I'm a New Zealand filmmaker.

48
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,800
I've been working in film for about 20 years I guess.

49
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
I wrote and directed a film called Black Sheep.

50
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
No, I've only worked in New Zealand.

51
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,800
New Zealanders are very proud of Lord of the Rings and the Middle Earth thing, but also a little bit sheepish about it too.

52
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,800
It's like, it's not all we do you know.

53
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,800
And it's funny how like Flight of the Conchords even, if you think about the posters on the office wall, are kind of poking fun at that straight away.

54
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,800
So even New Zealanders are a little bit embarrassed about that, it's like hey, we're not just scenery.

55
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
What about another exclamation mark?

56
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
I don't think that's necessary.

57
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,800
The Lord of the Rings helped put the New Zealand film industry on the map in a big way.

58
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:19,800
And part of the reason why New Zealand was an attractive location for filming was the unions were far weaker than the ones in, say, the United States.

59
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:28,800
So sooner or later the actors of New Zealand, having helped create the magic of Lord of the Rings, were bound to start wanting at least equal treatment to their counterparts in England and the US.

60
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,800
All we are asking is for fair and equitable terms and conditions, minimum terms and conditions, that our colleagues overseas enjoy.

61
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
Yeah, good luck with that.

62
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:55,800
When we have overseas companies, overseas production companies, overseas studios, come to New Zealand and I believe to Australia, they're doing it to save money.

63
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,800
So this was sort of the world in which this whole fiasco exploded.

64
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:09,800
I'm Rajnil Singh, I'm a filmmaker and I've been working in the New Zealand film and television industry for the last 12 years, I believe.

65
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:16,800
By international terms, we are not really a film industry here in New Zealand.

66
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,800
We are a film service.

67
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,800
We do require these international productions to survive.

68
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:36,800
If we don't, the perception amongst the New Zealand film workers is that 90% of the people will just lose their jobs instantly and will not be able to continue working.

69
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Going back a few years before The Hobbit, we essentially had a number of problematic incidents in our local film and television industry regarding how actors, specifically actors, but it applies to crew as well, have been treated by local productions.

70
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:10,800
It was one of the elements that essentially had necessitated the formation of actors' equity and had started getting actors really thinking about organising themselves and looking after themselves and fighting their own battles which nobody else was fighting.

71
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:20,800
Nobody in The Lord of the Rings who was an actor working and living here in New Zealand got any residuals from that.

72
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:32,800
When The Hobbit came along, my understanding is that Peter Jackson was responsible for ensuring that we did and that was the first major concession we had.

73
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:53,800
That, I think, was a show of good faith by Peter Jackson, but clearly it didn't match the Screen Actors Guild conditions of return because we were the troublesome group down at the bottom of the world who really should just know our place.

74
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:05,800
So the local Actors Guild, backed, some might say pushed, by the Australian Actors Union decide that The Hobbit might be a good high-profile test case for us to bargain for better labour conditions. So let's do that!

75
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:25,800
The first I ever heard about the industrial action which was sold to us as an industrial action that was international with English actors' equity, SAG involved, the MEAA in Australia and locally.

76
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:35,800
It was announced in the media during the press release at which point all hell broke loose.

77
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Let go home! Let go home! Let go home! Let go home! Let go home!

78
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
Why did you call for a boycott?

79
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Actors' Equity then releases a stop work order for actors who've been cast in The Hobbit until fairer pay conditions can be agreed upon.

80
00:08:50,800 --> 00:09:04,800
Tonight's meeting, New Zealand Actors' Equity members have overwhelmingly resolved that its delegation meet with the producers of The Hobbit to hold negotiations in good faith on the terms and conditions for performers working on the production.

81
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
It isn't a boycott. It's not a boycott.

82
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,800
Let go home! Let go home!

83
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,800
These are the lives of everybody in the New Zealand film industry. Why are you targeting The Hobbit?

84
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,800
We have never said there's a boycott. It is not in any of our information.

85
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,800
Warner Brothers really does not like this.

86
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,800
It's a question of confidence in our industrial relations and the damage was done within a week of the blacklist going on.

87
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:36,800
None of the other guilds that run the industry, crew, producers, directors, editors, were informed about this.

88
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:45,800
So there was somebody in my extended family who came to me and said, you do realise, John, that by not signing you're putting my work at risk as well.

89
00:09:45,800 --> 00:10:04,800
If you are working as a set builder and you've got somebody over here from America who is doing the same work and they are earning twice what you're earning for doing work that you are very good at doing, at least if not a better standard than this other person, is that alright with you?

90
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:16,800
The opposition to the industrial action across the board did not come from people thinking that actors' equity was asking too much.

91
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,800
It was nothing to do with that. It was a genuine, genuine fear of what Warner was going to do to retaliate.

92
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:33,800
The industrial action has the support of actors' unions around the world and big names like Karl Urban come out in support of it.

93
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,800
But local crews in Peter Jackson are terrified that this will scare Warner Brothers away from New Zealand altogether.

94
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:45,800
And they are frankly worried because the actors bought a completely frivolous action.

95
00:10:45,800 --> 00:11:00,800
Now if they've done that once, what happens in a year's time when Warner Brothers have spent $250 million, they're halfway through the film and the actors decide to have some fun again. It's like it could happen all over again. They have no confidence.

96
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,800
They then came back with the argument, well we'll just go somewhere else, we'll go and do it in Hungary or Poland or somewhere like that.

97
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
Social media exploded with fighting.

98
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,800
And there were protests in the streets about what actors' equity was doing.

99
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:22,800
Seeing Weta Workshop staff and Richard Taylor and everyone else marching down the streets in Wellington.

100
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,800
The idea became, hey the Hobbit's going to happen, but it could happen in Ireland or it could happen in the Czech Republic or whatever.

101
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:37,800
And I think the New Zealand public kind of poo-pooed that and didn't believe, I think we felt such ownership of it that no one believed for a second that it would go anywhere else.

102
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:46,800
And I think anyone who knows much about international filmmaking is that it could quite easily have gone anywhere else.

103
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,800
There were these really nasty divisive forces at work.

104
00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:07,800
That's what was probably most unfortunate about the way it played out, is it went from one group pushing for better workers' rights, suddenly became the film's about to go away, don't worry if we just change these labour laws, now we can save the film.

105
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,800
I think by that stage equity had lost.

106
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
And then politicians were like, hey.

107
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,800
In New Zealand there are two major parties, left and right.

108
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,800
Labour had been replaced by a national, a right-wing government.

109
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:36,800
To encourage that business to come to New Zealand, the government of Prime Minister John Key had in place a tax trade-off.

110
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:45,800
The impact of this will mean an additional rebate for the Hobbit movies of up to US $7.5 million per picture.

111
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,800
John Key also happens to be a former Merrill Lynch executive.

112
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,800
They did everything but literally roll out the red carpet for Warners.

113
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Warner Brothers flew in on jets and met overnight with the Prime Minister.

114
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,800
There were lobbyists that were flown down here, there were meetings, there were dinners.

115
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Suddenly the message became, we've saved the Hobbit in New Zealand, and the Prime Minister was able to say, I have saved, by just rewriting a few labour laws, I've been able to save the Hobbit in New Zealand.

116
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
You couldn't tell who was more excited to meet who.

117
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,800
Whether Warners were excited to have a state dinner with the leader of a sovereign nation,

118
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,800
or whether the leader of a sovereign nation was excited about meeting some studio execs.

119
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,800
It was quite farcical, it wasn't so serious at the time.

120
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,800
The government is determined to use the opportunity that the Hobbit movies present

121
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,800
to highlight New Zealand as a great place to visit, as well as a great place to do business.

122
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,800
So John Key rushes legislation through Parliament clarifying that film workers are independent contractors,

123
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,800
removing their collective bargaining rights, and also giving Warner Brothers tens of millions in tax subsidies and offset marketing costs.

124
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:56,800
It's good to have the uncertainty over, and to have everyone now full steam ahead on producing these two movies.

125
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:06,800
This meant that they were making even more money out of it, because they were paying us less, and they had this deal going on.

126
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:14,800
So I think it was certainly cynical on the Prime Minister of the day's heart.

127
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:21,800
It has to do with people with money making more money for themselves, and blow you people down there.

128
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,800
If you don't want to do the job, clear off, I'll get somebody else who does.

129
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Now I have nothing against people making money, but what I object to is that they make money off the poverty of other people.

130
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,800
They create poverty.

131
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,800
People who work in the film industry are freelance contractors.

132
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,800
Freelance contractors cannot bargain collectively.

133
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,800
And inequity basically means grossly unfair and immoral.

134
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,800
And such contracts, to my way of thinking, are exactly that.

135
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:07,800
I think the Hobbit law was one of the most dangerously iniquitous pieces of legislation to pass through our Parliament.

136
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,800
This ties into a much bigger discussion about the way we consume media.

137
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:32,800
When you discover that something like, say, The Hobbit was dogged by a massive fallout between one American studio, a sovereign government, and its people

138
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,800
because an underhanded change in its labor laws was written to benefit one production to the tune of tens of millions,

139
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,800
whether you like it or not, it becomes exceedingly difficult to separate the merry adventures of Bilbo and his dwarvish cabal

140
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,800
from the fact that the films are a benchmark case in how to upend an entire film industry.

141
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,800
The consequences from the Hobbit law have been mixed.

142
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,800
In effect, it kind of mirrors what we're seeing in movies as a whole.

143
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,800
There are plenty of resources, but they are going to fewer and bigger productions,

144
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,800
almost all of them international, by which I mean American.

145
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:11,800
Production decreased, some even say withered, in the years that followed, in part because of bad publicity surrounding the law.

146
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:18,800
But the New Zealand film industry did double their revenue in 2016, thanks to James Cameron's 27 Avatar sequels being filmed there.

147
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Absolute winners of this law is international film productions coming to New Zealand.

148
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,800
So that's great in that it incentivizes huge productions to be here,

149
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,800
but I don't think those incentives in themselves grow our industry.

150
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:43,800
And I think the New Zealand public was sold the fact that these incentives will also grow the industry at the same time,

151
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
and I don't necessarily think that's true.

152
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,800
You only have to go to the IMDB and search for American films shot in New Zealand,

153
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,800
and the list will shock you, because I think people don't actually understand the sheer number of blockbusters that are shot here.

154
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,800
So personally, as a New Zealand filmmaker, an independent filmmaker,

155
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,800
I would love to have seen our own government finding ways to stimulate our own industry.

156
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,800
These enormous productions in New Zealand, and the subsidies that have brought these enormous productions here,

157
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,800
offer employment to an awful lot of people who are excited about working on those things.

158
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,800
But we still have a situation where those enormous productions are few and far between.

159
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,800
Essentially, international film companies and studios are coming down here,

160
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:30,800
making films cheaper and being able to worry less about blowback for exploitation of workers than they are in L.A.

161
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,800
There are a lot of artistic choices in The Hobbit that exist completely outside of the studios

162
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,800
and the paratext of the law that also kind of cheapens Lord of the Rings in hindsight.

163
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,800
Little details like Thorin charging to the ringwraith theme,

164
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,800
Tauriel and Kili's poorly written rushed relationship,

165
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,800
Legolas and Gimli becoming friends is no longer kind of a first,

166
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,800
or the orcs what move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed.

167
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,800
An army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed.

168
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,800
Wow, Fellowship Gandalf, that kind of seems like not a big deal,

169
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,800
considering you did not seem bothered by that very thing in The Hobbit.

170
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,800
And the genuine disinterest the films have in characters that are actually in the books.

171
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,800
Tying these movies in, both internally and in its marketing,

172
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,800
so closely with Lord of the Rings just cheapens both trilogies.

173
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:33,800
It tries to replicate things from the trilogy without any of the soul or the verve or the ambition of those ones.

174
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,800
It becomes like a machine. It feels like a machine when you're watching it.

175
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,800
It started to dampen what was so special about Lord of the Rings.

176
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,800
There's still these films that hold this extremely dear place in my heart.

177
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,800
I can still quote it and come back to it and cry my eyes out.

178
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:57,800
You feel differently taking them in now. It's not that wonder, it's nostalgia now.

179
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,800
I think it's natural that films with huge impact and influence,

180
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,800
people critically re-evaluate them later. That's natural.

181
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Any film that at the time is regarded as great,

182
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,800
eventually undergoes some sort of cycle of re-evaluation.

183
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:18,800
It's a case with The Hobbit where these are films that feed off of Lord of the Rings so intensely

184
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,800
that you can't help but go back to the source material and think, hey, what went wrong here?

185
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,800
In the light of The Hobbit films, people view Lord of the Rings,

186
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,800
perhaps not negatively but definitely in a far more critical lens.

187
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:35,800
People see what has become overly saccharine or overly homogenised in The Hobbit

188
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,800
and it bleeds into Lord of the Rings because that's where it was established.

189
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,800
That's where the seed was planted and grew.

190
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:48,800
And it's a shame really. It's a case of too much, like too many cooks spoiling the broth.

191
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,800
There's too much Lord of the Rings in the world now.

192
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,800
It's not to say that Middle Earth fatigue wasn't inevitable.

193
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,800
Dildo baggins!

194
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Most properties and genres go through cycles of boom and fatigue,

195
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,800
but the genuinely soul-sucking and cynical way these movies got made didn't help.

196
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
The Hobbit movies weren't an end point either.

197
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,800
They were an opening act for all the ways we can run the world of Tolkien into the ground.

198
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,800
And the only reason it hasn't happened yet is because the Tolkien estate clung to those rights with an iron fist.

199
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:23,800
But everyone has their price, and now Amazon is producing the most expensive television show in history

200
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,800
based on the world of Tolkien, specifically the Lord of the Rings.

201
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Amazon has already committed a billion dollars to five seasons,

202
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,800
all this less than two decades after an Oscar-winning trilogy based on these books.

203
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,800
And the ironic thing? The island nation of New Zealand will likely have nothing to do with it.

204
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,800
Our life experiences affect how we view and consume media,

205
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,800
and it goes without saying that most of us change between childhood and adulthood.

206
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,800
But the media we consume as children is made by adults who,

207
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,800
intentionally or not, imbue media with their own worldviews.

208
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,800
A child watching The Simpsons will watch this scene,

209
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,800
Some things will be dealt with at a later date.

210
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
If at all.

211
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
And it will go completely over their heads.

212
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,800
But an adult watching the scene knows the context, gets the reference.

213
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,800
How many of you had to deal with being called a poo or that being referenced?

214
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,800
As an opinion on the controversy the scene is referencing,

215
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,800
expects others to have an opinion about it.

216
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,800
But knowing the full context of an opinion being expressed is one thing.

217
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,800
It's another thing altogether to learn that people who made your favorite media weren't being treated fairly.

218
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:32,800
Once the films had been made and were being released,

219
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,800
we were all invited to the opening in Wellington.

220
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,800
The third one was going to be premiered in Los Angeles.

221
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:49,800
At this premiere there was no invitation sent to any of the New Zealand actors.

222
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:57,800
And it could be that we had been somewhat overly vocal about the so-called Hobbit law.

223
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:02,800
So a lot of people on Facebook were asking me,

224
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Oh, will we see you at the premiere, John?

225
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,800
Will you be on the red carpet in Los Angeles?

226
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,800
I then put on Facebook a little post saying,

227
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,800
Oh, by the way, for everybody who's been asking,

228
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,800
the Kiwis haven't been invited for budgetary reasons.

229
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,800
So no, I won't be there.

230
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Suddenly I had people from the production company getting in touch saying,

231
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,800
We understand you're really, really angry,

232
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,800
but you shouldn't be expressing your anger on public media.

233
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,800
And I said, Well, hang on a minute.

234
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,800
There was nothing in what I said that indicated anger.

235
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,800
Whatsoever.

236
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:51,800
I just said what I had been quoted from my agent from the studio.

237
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,800
And they said, This isn't good for business.

238
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,800
All that kind of thing.

239
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
We're not happy with it at all.

240
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:04,800
Next thing I hear is that we are going to the premiere in Los Angeles.

241
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Nobody from Warners met us.

242
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Nobody from Warners greeted us.

243
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Nobody from Warners said anything to us.

244
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:21,800
There was absolutely no contact with anybody from the studio whatsoever.

245
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Absolutely extraordinary.

246
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,800
And we thought, Boy, we must really have pissed them off.

247
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,800
If that is not the case, then I would be delighted to hear that.

248
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
People like Peter Jackson were fine.

249
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:41,800
The other actors, the English actors, the big names, they were all fine.

250
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
There was no problem there.

251
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:49,800
But nobody from the studio said tickety-boo to any of us from New Zealand.

252
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
I've always been a big fan of Kesha.

253
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,800
The music of her early years was a gateway for me letting myself like Top 40.

254
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,800
I was a huge fan of her aesthetic, of this flagrant, shameless image.

255
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,800
It was fun.

256
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,800
It let you feel like being broke and young and partying all the time was aspirational.

257
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,800
It felt like a pass not to care about the world, at least as long as her music was on.

258
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:24,800
But then years pass, and it comes out that all of those Party Girl songs were made during years of emotional and physical abuse by her producer.

259
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:30,800
That the Party Girl image was a construct that she didn't really have control over and maybe didn't even really like.

260
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:38,800
And knowing that, in a world where otherwise I probably still would have played the hell out of those early Kesha years music, it just doesn't feel the same anymore.

261
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,800
I want to go back to the way her music made me feel back in 2010.

262
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Just unapologetic and dumb and glittery.

263
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,800
But even though I want to, I can't.

264
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Because now I know the circumstances under which that music was made.

265
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:01,800
And if you watch a piece of media, had an emotional reaction, whatever it was, and then learned that the context involved a certain level of exploitation,

266
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,800
it changes the way you view the media, whether you want it to or not.

267
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:13,800
Maybe Harper Lee's old age and deteriorating mental state were exploited by her publisher in order to knock out a quick sequel to an American classic before the door closed.

268
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:20,800
Maybe Kesha's Party Girl image was carefully crafted by a sexually abusive, iron-fisted producer who had 100% control of her public image.

269
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:30,800
Maybe a lot of the art you consume, or even that you love, only exists because a person, or people, or an entire island nation were exploited by more powerful business interests.

270
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
But, that's capitalism.

271
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:50,800
As actors, we understand that there are many ways of going about business.

272
00:25:50,800 --> 00:26:01,800
Whether we're talking about the practical, financial aspects of our industry, or whether we're talking about the business of what we as actors do within that industry.

273
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Where rights for women, rights for workers, start and end.

274
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,800
And I think human dignity is really, really important.

275
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:22,800
And I think that there are employers around the world who exploit people.

276
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:32,800
That is why the Screen Actors Guild, and Actors Equity in England, Australia and New Zealand, and we here are directly tied to the Australians.

277
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Why we exist.

278
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:42,800
To look after the interests of people so that we don't fall under the thumb of the bully boys.

279
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:48,800
So that we are respected as people and as artists.

280
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:56,800
And that our views are no less worthy because we haven't got fat wallets.

281
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,800
Profit-driven exploitation doesn't always have the last word.

282
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:05,800
Kesha's still locked into a contract with the label that enabled her abuser, but at least he's not there anymore.

283
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,800
And there are elements of the Hobbit law that are up for repeal now that Labour is back in power.

284
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,800
Particularly the bit about outlawing collective bargaining, which to me is the most heinous part.

285
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,800
But these are only half measures, particularly the Hobbit law repeal, which itself is no guarantee.

286
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:27,800
I reached out to several people affiliated with the various New Zealand film guilds, but none are making comment to the media about the law until the law gets repealed.

287
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
If it does get repealed.

288
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:49,800
How do you go on when in your heart you begin to understand there is no going back?

289
00:27:49,800 --> 00:28:01,800
If you discover that a brand or a company, like a bank or something, did something bad or unethical, it isn't surprising.

290
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,800
People just kind of shrug and go, yep, that's how banks roll.

291
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,800
And maybe you'll close your account and go to a different bank.

292
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:19,800
But the reality is that you probably don't care enough to even do that much, because unethical multinational corporations doing terrible things to people in the name of profit is just kind of the world.

293
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,800
You don't have the brain space to care about all of them.

294
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,800
We pay monopolistic cable companies for internet access.

295
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,800
We have 401ks run by morally bankrupt hedge fund managers that we'll never know.

296
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:38,800
We still buy iPhones, we still buy cheap clothes while paying vague glib lip service to the knowledge that people are being exploited somewhere so we in America can boss Siri around.

297
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:46,800
In some ways we engage with a multitude of brands and corporations every day that someone somewhere is getting exploited by, often cruelly so.

298
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,800
But media is different. Media is personal.

299
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,800
Media is designed to provide an escape, to stir emotions, to inspire.

300
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,800
The film industry is by no means the industry with the highest incidence of sexual harassment.

301
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:04,800
But people care more about it when it gets exposed in the film industry, because the film industry creates media that hits emotional nerves.

302
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,800
Even when we find out that something we loved was made by someone who said or did bad things, it's like betrayal.

303
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:16,800
When people ask whether it's moral to separate art from the artist, or in this case, product from the multinational conglomerate,

304
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,800
what they're really asking is, how can I go back to consuming media like I did when I was a kid,

305
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,800
when the most context I had or cared about was who the author of my favorite book was,

306
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:32,800
or why I like this actor, or what Kesha's real name and birthday is.

307
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,800
But as an adult, you're expected to be an ethical consumer of media.

308
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:41,800
And it's somewhat inevitable that some people resent that, because consuming media the way children do is comforting.

309
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,800
Consuming media like The Hobbit as an adult is complicated.

310
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,800
And in this day and age, it's hard to do so innocently.

311
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,800
And I totally understand wanting to return to that innocence.

312
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,800
And I don't really have an argument against that worldview other than...

313
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,800
that's adulthood.

314
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,800
Well, I'm back.

315
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,800
Thank you.

316
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,800
Thank you.
