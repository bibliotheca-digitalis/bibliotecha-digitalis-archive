1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,240
Here's a question.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,160
Captain America is not the first character that was created as war propaganda, but he

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,760
is certainly the most enduring and widely known.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,560
Blindly patriotic Hitler puncher?

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,960
He's been that.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,960
Anti-government dissident?

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,760
He's been that too.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,360
Jingoistic France hater?

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,640
Yes.

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,680
Most often, he has been the defender of the defenseless, regardless of what country they

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,040
hail from.

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,280
Because that's what America does, right?

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,120
Riiiiiiiight?

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,600
Hugely popular during the war, Cap was revived in 1964 and has remained one of Marvel's

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,760
most popular characters ever since.

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,040
But he's not just any super person, he's Captain America.

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:55,320
So how has his American-ness and the changing landscape of American culture influenced his

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,240
many iterations over the years?

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:04,320
Well, prepare to be unfrozen many times over, this is Loose Cannon, Captain America.

20
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:28,480
The superhero genre was only about three years old when Cap punched his way onto the

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,480
scene.

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:35,080
In 1941, Timely Comics released Captain America Comics No. 1, a full nine months before the

23
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,400
US even declared war, and it became very popular very quickly.

24
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,240
Once the US did go to war, Captain America comics were sent in huge numbers to American

25
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,720
troops overseas.

26
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:51,840
And in contrast to the jaded troops we see in the 2011 film, Captain America comics were

27
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,840
actually super popular.

28
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,600
They were cheap, easy-to-ship entertainment that also boosted morale.

29
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,840
Troops saw themselves in the stalwart manly Cap, and the kids back home saw themselves

30
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,240
in Bucky Barnes, Captain America's young… ward sidekick.

31
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,920
Captain America's enemies were usually fictionalized Nazi types, the Red Skull being the most popular

32
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,920
and enduring.

33
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,880
Steve Rogers, in contrast, is strong, pure, and masculine.

34
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,520
He has no interest in the underlying cause of the conflicts.

35
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,760
Like all comic heroes of the day, he just knows that punching faces will solve the problem

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,920
forever.

37
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,400
The German-Jewish defector scientist, originally Dr. Reinstein, a very thinly veiled allusion

38
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,680
to the real story of Albert Einstein, leaves Germany and helps the US invent a super serum

39
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,200
to create an army of super soldiers, but then he's killed by a Nazi assassin and Steve

40
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,400
ends up the only one.

41
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,440
But it's okay, because now we have Captain America.

42
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,000
So in a way, Steve Rogers is like… the atomic bomb.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,320
You know, if we had made only one.

44
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,920
And he became a popular franchise character.

45
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,240
Normally this sort of Frankenstein story is a cautionary, don't play God kind of thing,

46
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,960
but hey, it's war.

47
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,440
Works out fine for Steve.

48
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,320
Yeah, we got our own uber mention.

49
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,440
He doesn't like you, Hitler.

50
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,640
Cap didn't work out too well in the post-war context.

51
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,400
Unlike Superman, who didn't have the very specific defeat-Hitler reason for being, Captain

52
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,840
America became a little… lost.

53
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,160
In the 1950s, the comics industry created the CCA as a monitoring agent at the height

54
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,640
of the McCarthy era.

55
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,120
This resulted in Cap being rebranded as a commie smasher.

56
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,180
Because of course, this version did not do too well and the comic folded in 1954.

57
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,080
So that was that.

58
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,080
Not quite.

59
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,080
When Captain America throws his mighty shield.

60
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:55,400
The company by 1964, known as Marvel Comics, decided, hey, let's bring Captain America

61
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,600
back and make him part of the nascent Avengers.

62
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,320
Captain Commie Smasher got retconned.

63
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,000
See, the real Steve Rogers disappeared with Bucky Barnes in 1944.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,440
Neither of their bodies were found, both were presumed dead, until the Avengers find him

65
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,320
frozen in the North Atlantic.

66
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,480
Cap also has one of the more homogenous origin stories, so strap in, we're about to see

67
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,400
a lot of white dudes get thawed.

68
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,840
It is here that Captain America finally has a defining character trait, besides punching.

69
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,400
Being the man out of time, and reconciling his identity as an American icon with the

70
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,360
constantly changing times.

71
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,720
Since the 60s, Cap has been a mainstay of the Avengers, as well as a star of his own

72
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
title.

73
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,680
In 1969, he partnered with Marvel's first African-American superhero, African-American.

74
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,000
Black Panther is African.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,080
Sam Wilson, aka the Falcon.

76
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,760
In fact, for most of the 70s, the book was rebranded as Captain America and the Falcon.

77
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,760
And given that Vietnam just happened, and we're not too, like, patriotic in the 70s,

78
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,480
how did Cap spend his days back then?

79
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:05,720
Why, helping the Falcon patrol Harlem, and keeping the kids off the street, of course.

80
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:13,640
Captain America and the Falcon dealt heavily with issues of race, and class, and race,

81
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,400
and race.

82
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,360
It is fabulous.

83
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,880
But being Captain America, his relationship with his country and his in-universe place

84
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,120
as an American icon is a recurring theme.

85
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,240
He sits Vietnam out altogether.

86
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,760
After Watergate, Steve resigns as Captain America, and becomes Nomad, the man without

87
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,960
a country.

88
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,840
That's actually a lot less emo than it sounds, and it didn't last terribly long.

89
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,080
He resigned again during the Reagan administration, because he won't go along with the government's

90
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,400
idea of what he should be, since the government owns the rights to Captain America or something.

91
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,000
His replacement embodied a very different American ideal.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,680
John Walker had a jingoistic attitude that reflected a large segment of American culture

93
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,680
during the Reagan years.

94
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,400
He's more of a Rambo than a Chris Evans.

95
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,760
So when Steve does eventually reassume his alter ego, he decides that the Captain America

96
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:07,080
identity is a symbol of America's ideals, rather than its government.

97
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,720
Who decides these ideals?

98
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Steve.

99
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,800
And, you know, whoever is writing him.

100
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,640
I'm just going to skip talking about the 90s, except you should know that Cap was a werewolf

101
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,240
at one point.

102
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,560
He was a werewolf.

103
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,560
Now let's talk about the adaptations.

104
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:35,000
He shook so many of them out of the trees that they coined a nickname for him.

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,880
Captain America.

106
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,880
Captain America?

107
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,560
After the success of The Incredible Hulk and Wonder Woman, CBS thought, hey, who else can

108
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,880
we make a superhero show out of?

109
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,600
And what more obvious a choice to capture the late 70s disillusionment with the US and

110
00:06:50,600 --> 00:07:03,160
the economic ennui than Captain America?

111
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,120
CBS ended up commissioning two TV movies, and while the first one is considerably worse

112
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,840
than the second, due mostly to the presence of slumming Christopher Lee in the sequel,

113
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,880
they are both pretty bad.

114
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,800
Steve Rogers is played by former USC football player and future Big McLarge Huge, Reb Brown.

115
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,960
He is not a soldier, nor does he aspire to be.

116
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:36,200
In fact, I'm not sure what he is really other than, like, you know, an easy rider.

117
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,680
Some science types want him to do the serum for some reason.

118
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,560
He doesn't want to.

119
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
Because.

120
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,560
I just want to kick back and find out who I am.

121
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,240
Hey, I don't need this.

122
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,280
Steve drives off a cliff early on, damaging only his shirt because the bad guys or something.

123
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,640
The second time he drives off a cliff, turns out maybe it's going to be a problem, and

124
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,480
the scientists super serum him in order to save his life.

125
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:11,320
So this version goes down as the only one where his injection is non-consensual.

126
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,040
He eventually adopts the moniker Captain America because his father embodied the American

127
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,040
Ideal.

128
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,840
You'll sense that he believed in the American Ideal and he tried to live it.

129
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,680
Really a lot, somehow, and people called him Captain America as a joke.

130
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,440
If I'm going to be Captain America, I want to be the same Captain America my father was

131
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,440
in every way.

132
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:36,680
I don't just want to do the things he did, I want to look the way he did as well.

133
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,480
Because.

134
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:44,120
For reasons that I'm sure made sense at the time, CBS mandated that the film not be

135
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,840
too close to the comics.

136
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,820
And the result only resembles Captain America in that he's the product of a drug experiment

137
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,500
and that's pretty much it.

138
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,560
And they are trying to make the Captain America thing work and it just lands with an unimaginable

139
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
thud.

140
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,960
It's perfect.

141
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,000
Be Captain America, Steve.

142
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,660
Jam Captain America down their throats.

143
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,180
The late 70s, being a time of disillusionment in the American dream and a crumbling economy,

144
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,260
was not a great atmosphere for a Captain America TV show.

145
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:21,660
But even that doesn't excuse the bewildering choices made for this sucker.

146
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:33,660
Onward.

147
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:42,300
From the director of Cyborg, Nemesis, and Cyborg Nemesis, and starring Matt Salinger

148
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:49,120
of J.D. Salinger's son fame, this starts not with the Captain's childhood backstory

149
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,780
but Red Skull's.

150
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,060
This version didn't have a theatrical release because when the studio took a look at the

151
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,820
finished product it went nope, we are not releasing that.

152
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,260
Direct to video it is.

153
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,540
But the first third does take place in the 40s, which looks an awful lot like the 80s.

154
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:11,780
So after the super serum he goes on his first mission and fails utterly and immediately.

155
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:16,700
50 years later he gets unfrozen and the president sends his chunk friend, played by Ned Beatty

156
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:24,740
instead of Secret Service, military, sled dogs, anyone, to Alaska to get Steve after

157
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,020
he has been an unfrozen caveman lawyer.

158
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:38,220
Seeing this guy's German and Japanese devices, he steals the guy's car.

159
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,780
Captain America!

160
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:47,060
This is not the only time in the film he steals a car, by the way.

161
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:52,160
Like the Red, Brown, and Hell, even the 1944 serial version, the fact that he's Captain

162
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,500
America is completely incidental.

163
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,980
This guy is Captain America in that he is a xenophobic asshole who steals cars.

164
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,980
Don't leave me out here!

165
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,980
Next!

166
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:14,740
The Ultimates was intended to be a more realistic and gritty reboot of the Marvel Universe.

167
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,460
But this book was running alongside the likes of Grant Morrison's New X-Men, which was already

168
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,740
plenty that.

169
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:28,780
So in order to differentiate itself, the Ultimate Universe had to go really grimdark.

170
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:33,220
Enter Mark Miller, patron saint of angry 13-year-old boys.

171
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:39,100
Ultimate Captain America is less an EXTREME version and more a logical alternative.

172
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:45,500
I say logical in that some people have argued, hey, wouldn't a guy from the 40s be kind of

173
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,620
a jingoistic belligerent prick?

174
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,060
This version of Steve hangs out at the old folks' home because he can't relate to the

175
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,060
modern folk.

176
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,060
You know what?

177
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,060
Sure.

178
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,060
Why not?

179
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,780
He also hits people while they're defenseless and starts fights when he's angry.

180
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:05,220
He later murders his enemies after they are beaten and defenseless.

181
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,980
Propping up the ugly post-911 attitude on countries that weren't wild about American

182
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,940
foreign policy at the time, Ultimates also gives us probably the most infamous frame

183
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:19,500
of all of the Captain America comics, and it gets a full page, too.

184
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,900
And then an entire panel in the following issue congratulating itself on what a funny

185
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,620
joke that was.

186
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,140
Personally, I don't think someone for whom fighting alongside the French Resistance was

187
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:36,980
only a few months ago to him would be towing the party line of Freedom Fries, but hey.

188
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,500
It's not a completely unfair interpretation, and there is something interesting about the

189
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,220
idea that Steve is genuinely unable to relate to anyone under the age of 80.

190
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:51,060
Even so, it figures that this would be the only version who eventually becomes president.

191
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,940
Next!

192
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,580
Marvel's 1602 was a one-off miniseries written by Neil Gaiman, the basic thrust being that

193
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:04,220
the events of the Marvel Universe took place 400 years earlier, and they centered around

194
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,300
the Roanoke Colony in Virginia.

195
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:12,260
Blond-haired, blue-eyed Steve Rogers is the Native American bodyguard to Virginia Dare,

196
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,260
Raj Haas.

197
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,180
See, it only made sense to me once I said it out loud.

198
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,300
The Native American part is sort of hand-waved away with like, oh, some Welshman must have

199
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,020
gotten fresh with one of the natives like 20, 30 years ago.

200
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:28,780
But where all of the other characters are actually of their time, albeit like mutants,

201
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:35,020
it turns out that Raj Haas is the actual Captain America who was sent back in time from a future

202
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,740
fascist America.

203
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,820
And it's Steve's presence in the past that makes it so the heroes of his time appear

204
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,820
400 years earlier instead of as we know it.

205
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,340
So he's gotta go back to the future or the universe will explode.

206
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,060
Only, he doesn't want to go back, you guys.

207
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,820
See, now that he's in the past, he can make it so all the American bad never happens,

208
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,820
you know?

209
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:01,020
We can circumvent the genocide of the natives, we can make it so slavery is never a thing,

210
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:07,380
no McCarthyism, no Scientology, no Space Jam, but Nick Fury tricks him into going back,

211
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,460
so no better future America for you, Cap.

212
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,220
Nice try, though.

213
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,220
Moving on.

214
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,140
There are roughly one shit million Marvel cartoons from the last 15 years, and about

215
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:24,060
half of them are Avengers-type things, and Captain America at least cameos in all of

216
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,060
them.

217
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,100
There are… some.

218
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,940
Ultimate Avengers, as implied by the title, is loosely based on the first Ultimate's

219
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,940
limited run.

220
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,460
It is boring and unremarkable.

221
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,460
Hitler's dead!

222
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,460
Except for that.

223
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,460
Red Skull!

224
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:47,740
I can't believe somebody found you and thawed you out!

225
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:54,020
The Superhero Squad show is the rare Marvel-based comedy, so the unfrozen caveman lawyer aspect

226
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:58,900
is not only played up, it seems to be Captain America's main defining attribute.

227
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,900
Karaoke!

228
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,900
It's Japanese!

229
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,620
Yes, the Japanese are on our side now, and I bid them welcome.

230
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,860
He's so happy we're friends.

231
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,860
You're safe!

232
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,060
You're with friends!

233
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,100
What are you?

234
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,100
Some kind of hydro-automaton?

235
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,100
Listen!

236
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,620
Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes marks the first attempted tie-in with the Marvel

237
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,980
Cinematic Universe.

238
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,940
It is also unremarkable.

239
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:28,180
But I do like how this show manages to cut Hitler out of World War II entirely.

240
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:33,100
Apparently HYDRA originated in a more, like, Russia-ly direction.

241
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,500
How does this contraption turn water into coffee?

242
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,300
Is it coal power, or is it a miracle?

243
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,820
Avengers Assemble, while not officially in the Marvel Cinematic Universe canon, like,

244
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,500
say, Agent Carter, is based off the movie universe.

245
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,660
So, with the exception of the Hulk, who is inexplicably articulate, and Falcon, who does

246
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,540
not share his movie counterpart's backstory, these are basically kiddified versions of

247
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,820
the movie characters.

248
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,740
Anyway, moving on.

249
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,700
Civil War may be the most well-known arc in the comics in which Captain America is a main

250
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,700
player.

251
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,700
Sadly.

252
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,980
The basic premise is that the American government passes a superhuman registration act, Iron

253
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,860
Man supports it, Captain America opposes it, everyone is completely out of character to

254
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,580
make the whole Civil War premise work, and it's terrible.

255
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:26,700
So it's no real surprise that this, too, was written by odious f**kboy Mark Miller.

256
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,060
Cap is portrayed as a short-sighted reactionary hothead.

257
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:34,780
Meanwhile, Tony Stark and Reed Richards create some sort of, like, interdimensional space

258
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:41,020
gulag where they keep unregistered super people in order to make Steve's extremes seem justified.

259
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:45,620
Civil War ends when he just kind of gives up in issue 7 because fighting is bad and

260
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,260
property damage, you guys.

261
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:52,140
You know, because he couldn't deduce that superhero fights might cause collateral damage

262
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,620
and cost innocent lives.

263
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,620
Steve is a hot mess, but honestly, the award for character assassination goes to poor Tony.

264
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:06,220
Although the award for literal character assassination goes to Steve, as he gets assassinated at

265
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,220
the end.

266
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,220
Oh, he comes back.

267
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,220
I don't want to discuss Civil War without mentioning, also, Ed Brubaker's excellent

268
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,780
run on Captain America, which ran before, during, and after Civil War.

269
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:23,940
Brubaker's run is where the Winter Soldier arc originated, post-assassination, who but

270
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,660
Bucky takes over the role of Captain America.

271
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,180
And the series ties in a lot with Steve's past in World War II.

272
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,620
There's even one scene where Cap praises the French and says,

273
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,020
It really galls me to hear my own people dismissing the French as cowards.

274
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:43,020
Hmmm.

275
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,020
Next.

276
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:58,020
So, speaking of military propaganda...

277
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:04,900
But while this film didn't go down that road, it also doesn't shy away from Captain America's

278
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,660
roots as propaganda either.

279
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,860
This movie opts not to demonize Nazis.

280
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:18,860
Instead, they are also almost completely omitted in favor of Hydra.

281
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,780
Back to the American ideal, which is a very specific reason of why Steve wants to go to

282
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:33,780
war in the first place.

283
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,840
Tommy Lee Jones' character has more traditional ideas on power and masculinity and what makes

284
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,100
a good soldier.

285
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:48,100
In a way, he is describing OG Captain America from the 40s.

286
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:55,740
But in the end, the super soldier isn't an ultra-masculine jaw puncher, but a chaste,

287
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,420
sensitive artist.

288
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:04,420
First Steve is intuitive, and then he is self-sacrificing.

289
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,160
His lack of pomposity is what makes the movie work.

290
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:17,160
That, and Chris Evans, whose face has been kissed by the angels, really perfect casting.

291
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:25,160
I beg to differ.

292
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,740
Where Captain America, the first Avenger, ends with Steve as unfrozen caveman lawyer,

293
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:41,720
the Avengers, Avengers assemble in the UK for trademark reasons, serves as Steve's

294
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:48,720
acclamation to the modern world.

295
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,000
And while we're here, I'm going to quickly touch on this thing that comes up sometimes.

296
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,000
If Steve left the world in 1944, how is he not a huge fucking racist?

297
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,920
Some people really hate the idea of Steve even mucking up by saying something that would

298
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,360
have been totally acceptable in the 40s, but isn't anymore, you know, because Steve

299
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,560
is just that intuitive.

300
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:19,400
But even if he was the most egalitarian thing that ever lived, he'd probably say something

301
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,400
well-meaning and inappropriate.

302
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,360
But since the MCU is not our universe, and we've got some revisionist history going

303
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:35,280
down therein because the army in this WWII appears to be totally integrated, I'm going

304
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:40,320
with different universe, different rules. Yes.

305
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,320
Steve Rogers, perfect human.

306
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,920
Steve's paradigm shift in this one is more in the subtext, which for a movie as full

307
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:58,920
as this is a good thing. He's a fish out of water, but not obnoxiously so.

308
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,760
I understood that reference.

309
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,760
He still talks like he's performing when his guard is up, and he calls Natasha ma'am all the time.

310
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,560
Captain Rogers. Ma'am.

311
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,840
The closest we ever get to Steve Rogers not perfect human is when he repeatedly tries

312
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,360
to goad Tony into putting on his Iron Man suit so they can punch it out like men.

313
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,280
Put on the suit. Let's go a few rounds.

314
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,280
Put on the suit, let's find out.

315
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,640
I'm not afraid to hit an old man. Put on the suit.

316
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,280
This is very unlike movie Steve, but then there's like an evil Loki thing in the room,

317
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,640
so, you know, okay. His arc is basically can he deal with f***ing Tony Stark.

318
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,640
Wait, wait, hold on. How is this now about me?

319
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,640
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

320
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:41,240
The modern Captain America stands in some contrast to movies like Man of Steel and Transformers,

321
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,000
which got heavy subsidies from the American military and did require script approval from

322
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,640
the government before they were allowed to receive these subsidies.

323
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,920
Yes, this is still a thing.

324
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:58,160
The Avengers rather famously sought and was denied the aforementioned DoD subsidy, and

325
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,240
all of this stuff is off the books, so we may never know exactly what went down between

326
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,120
Marvel and, you know, the government.

327
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,360
But apparently the long and short of said denial was that the script wasn't propagandistic

328
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,360
enough.

329
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,200
I recognize the council has made a decision, but given that it's a stupid ass decision,

330
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,400
I've elected to ignore it.

331
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,400
How funny that.

332
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,840
Where Captain America The First Avenger is a coming of age war story, The Winter Soldier

333
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,000
is more of a conspiracy thriller.

334
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,760
At the start of the movie, Steve seems more comfortable with the unfrozen caveman lawyer

335
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,760
thing.

336
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,880
There are subtle changes in his language.

337
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,480
For instance, he isn't calling Natasha ma'am all the time.

338
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,840
Where did Captain America learn how to steal a car?

339
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,040
I see what you did there, movie.

340
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,400
Don't leave me out here!

341
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,400
When he first meets Sam Wilson, he immediately rejects the idea of the good old days as being

342
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
a better time.

343
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,240
You must miss the good old days, huh?

344
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,400
Things aren't so bad.

345
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,520
Food's a lot better.

346
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,080
We used to boil everything.

347
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,360
No polio's good.

348
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,720
Internet, so helpful.

349
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,120
He doesn't deify the whole greatest generation thing.

350
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,960
Winter Soldier is also much more topical.

351
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,640
It deals with themes of terrorism and government transparency.

352
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,120
It is considerably less comic book-y in tone than either the first movie or The Avengers,

353
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,740
and Steve's main internal conflict is that of serving the country he knows versus the

354
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,200
changing nature of the country today.

355
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:37,600
And I thought I could throw myself back in, follow orders, serve.

356
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,360
It's just not the same.

357
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,240
So the Captain America aspect is very front and center in the form of Steve's conflict.

358
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,640
So the mid-movie reveal that almost all of the bad things that have happened to the world

359
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,360
since World War II is because Hydra had infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D.

360
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:01,040
For 70 years, Hydra has been secretly feeding crisis.

361
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,600
It's lame.

362
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
It's extremely lame.

363
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,600
The word is lame.

364
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:12,680
Hydra created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom.

365
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,440
Like, the movie stops just short of implying that Hydra planned 9-11.

366
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,960
And when history did not cooperate, history was changed.

367
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,120
It's kinda nice to be able to stop blaming all of our problems on misfortune, bad people,

368
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,440
and short-sighted international policy made in America's own self-interest and just say

369
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
it's all Hydra's fault.

370
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,160
Hank Glider.

371
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,800
Given that the film deals heavily with government surveillance and with releasing information,

372
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,200
we've come to an interesting full circle.

373
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,800
In the beginning, Cap was a blind patriot, punching for his country without question.

374
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,320
Now he defends American ideals a la Edward Snowden.

375
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,480
Captain America defends freedom by giving the world transparency.

376
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:01,760
And by letting Bucky punch his face.

377
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,760
Steve Rogers.

378
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,760
Perfect human.

379
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,600
There's been some kerfuffle recently over the current run of all new Captain America

380
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,600
and the fact that Captain America is now black.

381
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,880
Like, it's just some random black dude.

382
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,760
Like, world, it's Sam Wilson.

383
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,760
It's the Falcon.

384
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,320
He's been Steve's partner for decades.

385
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:25,120
He was in the movie and everything.

386
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,960
While character must have logical reason to be anything other than the default is a really

387
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,160
lame cry for pushing back against more diverse characters, it is especially lame in this

388
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
case.

389
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,200
Steve is still there as a character, only now his super serum has worn off and he is

390
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,360
aged.

391
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,320
And Sam Wilson is in the early stages of figuring out what it means for him to be Captain America.

392
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,560
And that is important, because one thing that hasn't changed is American people's desire

393
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,240
to see themselves in Cap.

394
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,680
Even 70 years later, people still expect Cap to uphold what they see as American ideals.

395
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,040
But that is part of why he is Steve Rogers' perfect human.

396
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:05,120
People from all political walks of life can aspire to be compassionate, intuitive, trustworthy,

397
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,520
adaptable, and just.

398
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,000
And that is just the character that Captain America has evolved into.

399
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,720
As long as Mark Miller isn't writing him.

400
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:25,440
If it doesn't stand for France, what does A stand for?

401
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,880
Perhaps it stands for Abstract Personifications of Unfathomable Beings, this being the theme

402
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,320
chosen by my patrons on Patreon for the next episode.

403
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,680
So here are your three options.

404
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,960
If it's not clear, the options are God, Satan, and Death.

405
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,800
So those are the choices.

406
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,400
Here's the link for you to vote.

407
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,720
The link is also below the video.

408
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,320
If you like this show, please consider supporting it on Patreon, and I will announce the winner

409
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,720
of this thing a couple of days on my Twitter, which is here.

410
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:01,360
Every fifth video will be my choice, so the video after next is not going up for a vote.

411
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,640
It will be my choice.

412
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,640
Live in fear, people.

413
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,920
Thank you for watching, and thank you for playing.

414
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,320
Bye.

415
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:22,320
