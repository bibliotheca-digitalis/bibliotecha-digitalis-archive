00:00.000 --> 00:09.240
Here's a question.

00:09.240 --> 00:13.160
Captain America is not the first character that was created as war propaganda, but he

00:13.160 --> 00:16.760
is certainly the most enduring and widely known.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.560
Blindly patriotic Hitler puncher?

00:18.560 --> 00:19.960
He's been that.

00:19.960 --> 00:20.960
Anti-government dissident?

00:20.960 --> 00:22.760
He's been that too.

00:22.760 --> 00:25.360
Jingoistic France hater?

00:25.360 --> 00:26.640
Yes.

00:27.080 --> 00:30.680
Most often, he has been the defender of the defenseless, regardless of what country they

00:30.680 --> 00:32.040
hail from.

00:32.040 --> 00:35.280
Because that's what America does, right?

00:35.280 --> 00:38.120
Riiiiiiiight?

00:38.120 --> 00:42.600
Hugely popular during the war, Cap was revived in 1964 and has remained one of Marvel's

00:42.600 --> 00:44.760
most popular characters ever since.

00:44.760 --> 00:49.040
But he's not just any super person, he's Captain America.

00:49.040 --> 00:55.320
So how has his American-ness and the changing landscape of American culture influenced his

00:55.520 --> 00:57.240
many iterations over the years?

00:57.240 --> 01:04.320
Well, prepare to be unfrozen many times over, this is Loose Cannon, Captain America.

01:04.320 --> 01:28.480
The superhero genre was only about three years old when Cap punched his way onto the

01:28.480 --> 01:29.480
scene.

01:29.480 --> 01:35.080
In 1941, Timely Comics released Captain America Comics No. 1, a full nine months before the

01:35.080 --> 01:39.400
US even declared war, and it became very popular very quickly.

01:39.400 --> 01:43.240
Once the US did go to war, Captain America comics were sent in huge numbers to American

01:43.240 --> 01:44.720
troops overseas.

01:44.720 --> 01:51.840
And in contrast to the jaded troops we see in the 2011 film, Captain America comics were

01:51.840 --> 01:53.840
actually super popular.

01:53.840 --> 01:59.600
They were cheap, easy-to-ship entertainment that also boosted morale.

01:59.600 --> 02:03.840
Troops saw themselves in the stalwart manly Cap, and the kids back home saw themselves

02:03.840 --> 02:10.240
in Bucky Barnes, Captain America's young… ward sidekick.

02:10.240 --> 02:14.920
Captain America's enemies were usually fictionalized Nazi types, the Red Skull being the most popular

02:14.920 --> 02:15.920
and enduring.

02:15.920 --> 02:19.880
Steve Rogers, in contrast, is strong, pure, and masculine.

02:19.880 --> 02:22.520
He has no interest in the underlying cause of the conflicts.

02:22.520 --> 02:26.760
Like all comic heroes of the day, he just knows that punching faces will solve the problem

02:26.760 --> 02:27.920
forever.

02:27.920 --> 02:34.400
The German-Jewish defector scientist, originally Dr. Reinstein, a very thinly veiled allusion

02:34.400 --> 02:39.680
to the real story of Albert Einstein, leaves Germany and helps the US invent a super serum

02:39.680 --> 02:44.200
to create an army of super soldiers, but then he's killed by a Nazi assassin and Steve

02:44.200 --> 02:45.400
ends up the only one.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.440
But it's okay, because now we have Captain America.

02:48.440 --> 02:54.000
So in a way, Steve Rogers is like… the atomic bomb.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.320
You know, if we had made only one.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.920
And he became a popular franchise character.

02:59.920 --> 03:05.240
Normally this sort of Frankenstein story is a cautionary, don't play God kind of thing,

03:05.240 --> 03:06.960
but hey, it's war.

03:06.960 --> 03:08.440
Works out fine for Steve.

03:08.440 --> 03:10.320
Yeah, we got our own uber mention.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.440
He doesn't like you, Hitler.

03:12.440 --> 03:15.640
Cap didn't work out too well in the post-war context.

03:15.640 --> 03:21.400
Unlike Superman, who didn't have the very specific defeat-Hitler reason for being, Captain

03:21.400 --> 03:24.840
America became a little… lost.

03:24.840 --> 03:29.160
In the 1950s, the comics industry created the CCA as a monitoring agent at the height

03:29.160 --> 03:30.640
of the McCarthy era.

03:30.640 --> 03:36.120
This resulted in Cap being rebranded as a commie smasher.

03:36.120 --> 03:42.180
Because of course, this version did not do too well and the comic folded in 1954.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.080
So that was that.

03:44.080 --> 03:45.080
Not quite.

03:45.080 --> 03:49.080
When Captain America throws his mighty shield.

03:49.080 --> 03:55.400
The company by 1964, known as Marvel Comics, decided, hey, let's bring Captain America

03:55.400 --> 03:58.600
back and make him part of the nascent Avengers.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.320
Captain Commie Smasher got retconned.

04:00.320 --> 04:05.000
See, the real Steve Rogers disappeared with Bucky Barnes in 1944.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.440
Neither of their bodies were found, both were presumed dead, until the Avengers find him

04:09.440 --> 04:11.320
frozen in the North Atlantic.

04:11.320 --> 04:16.480
Cap also has one of the more homogenous origin stories, so strap in, we're about to see

04:16.480 --> 04:18.400
a lot of white dudes get thawed.

04:18.400 --> 04:23.840
It is here that Captain America finally has a defining character trait, besides punching.

04:23.840 --> 04:28.400
Being the man out of time, and reconciling his identity as an American icon with the

04:28.400 --> 04:30.360
constantly changing times.

04:30.360 --> 04:33.720
Since the 60s, Cap has been a mainstay of the Avengers, as well as a star of his own

04:33.720 --> 04:34.720
title.

04:34.720 --> 04:40.680
In 1969, he partnered with Marvel's first African-American superhero, African-American.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.000
Black Panther is African.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.080
Sam Wilson, aka the Falcon.

04:45.080 --> 04:50.760
In fact, for most of the 70s, the book was rebranded as Captain America and the Falcon.

04:50.760 --> 04:56.760
And given that Vietnam just happened, and we're not too, like, patriotic in the 70s,

04:56.760 --> 04:59.480
how did Cap spend his days back then?

04:59.480 --> 05:05.720
Why, helping the Falcon patrol Harlem, and keeping the kids off the street, of course.

05:05.720 --> 05:13.640
Captain America and the Falcon dealt heavily with issues of race, and class, and race,

05:13.640 --> 05:15.400
and race.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.360
It is fabulous.

05:17.360 --> 05:21.880
But being Captain America, his relationship with his country and his in-universe place

05:21.880 --> 05:25.120
as an American icon is a recurring theme.

05:25.120 --> 05:27.240
He sits Vietnam out altogether.

05:27.240 --> 05:31.760
After Watergate, Steve resigns as Captain America, and becomes Nomad, the man without

05:31.760 --> 05:33.960
a country.

05:33.960 --> 05:37.840
That's actually a lot less emo than it sounds, and it didn't last terribly long.

05:37.840 --> 05:42.080
He resigned again during the Reagan administration, because he won't go along with the government's

05:42.080 --> 05:46.400
idea of what he should be, since the government owns the rights to Captain America or something.

05:46.400 --> 05:49.000
His replacement embodied a very different American ideal.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.680
John Walker had a jingoistic attitude that reflected a large segment of American culture

05:52.680 --> 05:53.680
during the Reagan years.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.400
He's more of a Rambo than a Chris Evans.

05:56.400 --> 06:00.760
So when Steve does eventually reassume his alter ego, he decides that the Captain America

06:00.760 --> 06:07.080
identity is a symbol of America's ideals, rather than its government.

06:07.080 --> 06:08.720
Who decides these ideals?

06:08.720 --> 06:09.720
Steve.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.800
And, you know, whoever is writing him.

06:11.800 --> 06:17.640
I'm just going to skip talking about the 90s, except you should know that Cap was a werewolf

06:17.640 --> 06:20.240
at one point.

06:20.240 --> 06:22.560
He was a werewolf.

06:22.560 --> 06:24.560
Now let's talk about the adaptations.

06:24.560 --> 06:35.000
He shook so many of them out of the trees that they coined a nickname for him.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.880
Captain America.

06:37.880 --> 06:38.880
Captain America?

06:38.880 --> 06:43.560
After the success of The Incredible Hulk and Wonder Woman, CBS thought, hey, who else can

06:43.560 --> 06:45.880
we make a superhero show out of?

06:45.880 --> 06:50.600
And what more obvious a choice to capture the late 70s disillusionment with the US and

06:50.600 --> 07:03.160
the economic ennui than Captain America?

07:03.160 --> 07:08.120
CBS ended up commissioning two TV movies, and while the first one is considerably worse

07:08.120 --> 07:12.840
than the second, due mostly to the presence of slumming Christopher Lee in the sequel,

07:12.840 --> 07:17.880
they are both pretty bad.

07:17.880 --> 07:23.800
Steve Rogers is played by former USC football player and future Big McLarge Huge, Reb Brown.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.960
He is not a soldier, nor does he aspire to be.

07:26.960 --> 07:36.200
In fact, I'm not sure what he is really other than, like, you know, an easy rider.

07:36.200 --> 07:40.680
Some science types want him to do the serum for some reason.

07:40.680 --> 07:42.560
He doesn't want to.

07:42.560 --> 07:43.560
Because.

07:44.560 --> 07:48.560
I just want to kick back and find out who I am.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.240
Hey, I don't need this.

07:50.240 --> 07:55.280
Steve drives off a cliff early on, damaging only his shirt because the bad guys or something.

07:55.280 --> 07:59.640
The second time he drives off a cliff, turns out maybe it's going to be a problem, and

07:59.640 --> 08:03.480
the scientists super serum him in order to save his life.

08:03.480 --> 08:11.320
So this version goes down as the only one where his injection is non-consensual.

08:11.320 --> 08:16.040
He eventually adopts the moniker Captain America because his father embodied the American

08:16.040 --> 08:17.040
Ideal.

08:17.040 --> 08:20.840
You'll sense that he believed in the American Ideal and he tried to live it.

08:20.840 --> 08:24.680
Really a lot, somehow, and people called him Captain America as a joke.

08:24.680 --> 08:29.440
If I'm going to be Captain America, I want to be the same Captain America my father was

08:29.440 --> 08:30.440
in every way.

08:30.440 --> 08:36.680
I don't just want to do the things he did, I want to look the way he did as well.

08:36.680 --> 08:39.480
Because.

08:39.480 --> 08:44.120
For reasons that I'm sure made sense at the time, CBS mandated that the film not be

08:44.120 --> 08:45.840
too close to the comics.

08:45.840 --> 08:50.820
And the result only resembles Captain America in that he's the product of a drug experiment

08:50.820 --> 08:53.500
and that's pretty much it.

08:53.500 --> 08:58.560
And they are trying to make the Captain America thing work and it just lands with an unimaginable

08:58.560 --> 08:59.560
thud.

08:59.560 --> 09:00.960
It's perfect.

09:00.960 --> 09:03.000
Be Captain America, Steve.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.660
Jam Captain America down their throats.

09:05.660 --> 09:10.180
The late 70s, being a time of disillusionment in the American dream and a crumbling economy,

09:10.180 --> 09:15.260
was not a great atmosphere for a Captain America TV show.

09:15.260 --> 09:21.660
But even that doesn't excuse the bewildering choices made for this sucker.

09:21.660 --> 09:33.660
Onward.

09:33.660 --> 09:42.300
From the director of Cyborg, Nemesis, and Cyborg Nemesis, and starring Matt Salinger

09:42.300 --> 09:49.120
of J.D. Salinger's son fame, this starts not with the Captain's childhood backstory

09:49.120 --> 09:52.780
but Red Skull's.

09:52.780 --> 09:56.060
This version didn't have a theatrical release because when the studio took a look at the

09:56.060 --> 09:59.820
finished product it went nope, we are not releasing that.

09:59.820 --> 10:01.260
Direct to video it is.

10:01.260 --> 10:06.540
But the first third does take place in the 40s, which looks an awful lot like the 80s.

10:06.540 --> 10:11.780
So after the super serum he goes on his first mission and fails utterly and immediately.

10:11.780 --> 10:16.700
50 years later he gets unfrozen and the president sends his chunk friend, played by Ned Beatty

10:16.700 --> 10:24.740
instead of Secret Service, military, sled dogs, anyone, to Alaska to get Steve after

10:24.740 --> 10:27.020
he has been an unfrozen caveman lawyer.

10:27.140 --> 10:38.220
Seeing this guy's German and Japanese devices, he steals the guy's car.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.780
Captain America!

10:39.780 --> 10:47.060
This is not the only time in the film he steals a car, by the way.

10:47.060 --> 10:52.160
Like the Red, Brown, and Hell, even the 1944 serial version, the fact that he's Captain

10:52.160 --> 10:54.500
America is completely incidental.

10:54.500 --> 10:59.980
This guy is Captain America in that he is a xenophobic asshole who steals cars.

10:59.980 --> 11:02.980
Don't leave me out here!

11:02.980 --> 11:03.980
Next!

11:07.740 --> 11:14.740
The Ultimates was intended to be a more realistic and gritty reboot of the Marvel Universe.

11:14.740 --> 11:19.460
But this book was running alongside the likes of Grant Morrison's New X-Men, which was already

11:19.460 --> 11:21.740
plenty that.

11:21.740 --> 11:28.780
So in order to differentiate itself, the Ultimate Universe had to go really grimdark.

11:28.780 --> 11:33.220
Enter Mark Miller, patron saint of angry 13-year-old boys.

11:33.220 --> 11:39.100
Ultimate Captain America is less an EXTREME version and more a logical alternative.

11:39.100 --> 11:45.500
I say logical in that some people have argued, hey, wouldn't a guy from the 40s be kind of

11:45.500 --> 11:49.620
a jingoistic belligerent prick?

11:49.620 --> 11:53.060
This version of Steve hangs out at the old folks' home because he can't relate to the

11:53.060 --> 11:54.060
modern folk.

11:54.060 --> 11:55.060
You know what?

11:55.060 --> 11:56.060
Sure.

11:56.060 --> 11:57.060
Why not?

11:57.060 --> 12:00.780
He also hits people while they're defenseless and starts fights when he's angry.

12:00.780 --> 12:05.220
He later murders his enemies after they are beaten and defenseless.

12:05.220 --> 12:08.980
Propping up the ugly post-911 attitude on countries that weren't wild about American

12:08.980 --> 12:13.940
foreign policy at the time, Ultimates also gives us probably the most infamous frame

12:13.940 --> 12:19.500
of all of the Captain America comics, and it gets a full page, too.

12:19.500 --> 12:23.900
And then an entire panel in the following issue congratulating itself on what a funny

12:23.900 --> 12:25.620
joke that was.

12:25.620 --> 12:30.140
Personally, I don't think someone for whom fighting alongside the French Resistance was

12:30.140 --> 12:36.980
only a few months ago to him would be towing the party line of Freedom Fries, but hey.

12:36.980 --> 12:40.500
It's not a completely unfair interpretation, and there is something interesting about the

12:40.500 --> 12:45.220
idea that Steve is genuinely unable to relate to anyone under the age of 80.

12:45.220 --> 12:51.060
Even so, it figures that this would be the only version who eventually becomes president.

12:51.060 --> 12:54.940
Next!

12:54.940 --> 12:59.580
Marvel's 1602 was a one-off miniseries written by Neil Gaiman, the basic thrust being that

12:59.580 --> 13:04.220
the events of the Marvel Universe took place 400 years earlier, and they centered around

13:04.220 --> 13:06.300
the Roanoke Colony in Virginia.

13:06.300 --> 13:12.260
Blond-haired, blue-eyed Steve Rogers is the Native American bodyguard to Virginia Dare,

13:12.260 --> 13:13.260
Raj Haas.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.180
See, it only made sense to me once I said it out loud.

13:16.180 --> 13:20.300
The Native American part is sort of hand-waved away with like, oh, some Welshman must have

13:20.300 --> 13:24.020
gotten fresh with one of the natives like 20, 30 years ago.

13:24.020 --> 13:28.780
But where all of the other characters are actually of their time, albeit like mutants,

13:28.780 --> 13:35.020
it turns out that Raj Haas is the actual Captain America who was sent back in time from a future

13:35.060 --> 13:36.740
fascist America.

13:36.740 --> 13:40.820
And it's Steve's presence in the past that makes it so the heroes of his time appear

13:40.820 --> 13:43.820
400 years earlier instead of as we know it.

13:43.820 --> 13:47.340
So he's gotta go back to the future or the universe will explode.

13:47.340 --> 13:50.060
Only, he doesn't want to go back, you guys.

13:50.060 --> 13:54.820
See, now that he's in the past, he can make it so all the American bad never happens,

13:54.820 --> 13:55.820
you know?

13:55.820 --> 14:01.020
We can circumvent the genocide of the natives, we can make it so slavery is never a thing,

14:01.020 --> 14:07.380
no McCarthyism, no Scientology, no Space Jam, but Nick Fury tricks him into going back,

14:07.380 --> 14:11.460
so no better future America for you, Cap.

14:11.460 --> 14:13.220
Nice try, though.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.220
Moving on.

14:14.220 --> 14:19.140
There are roughly one shit million Marvel cartoons from the last 15 years, and about

14:19.140 --> 14:24.060
half of them are Avengers-type things, and Captain America at least cameos in all of

14:24.060 --> 14:25.060
them.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.100
There are… some.

14:33.140 --> 14:36.940
Ultimate Avengers, as implied by the title, is loosely based on the first Ultimate's

14:36.940 --> 14:37.940
limited run.

14:37.940 --> 14:39.460
It is boring and unremarkable.

14:39.460 --> 14:40.460
Hitler's dead!

14:40.460 --> 14:41.460
Except for that.

14:41.460 --> 14:42.460
Red Skull!

14:42.460 --> 14:47.740
I can't believe somebody found you and thawed you out!

14:47.740 --> 14:54.020
The Superhero Squad show is the rare Marvel-based comedy, so the unfrozen caveman lawyer aspect

14:54.020 --> 14:58.900
is not only played up, it seems to be Captain America's main defining attribute.

14:58.900 --> 14:59.900
Karaoke!

14:59.900 --> 15:00.900
It's Japanese!

15:00.900 --> 15:05.620
Yes, the Japanese are on our side now, and I bid them welcome.

15:05.620 --> 15:07.860
He's so happy we're friends.

15:07.860 --> 15:08.860
You're safe!

15:08.860 --> 15:11.060
You're with friends!

15:11.060 --> 15:12.100
What are you?

15:12.100 --> 15:13.100
Some kind of hydro-automaton?

15:13.100 --> 15:14.100
Listen!

15:14.100 --> 15:18.620
Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes marks the first attempted tie-in with the Marvel

15:18.620 --> 15:19.980
Cinematic Universe.

15:19.980 --> 15:21.940
It is also unremarkable.

15:21.940 --> 15:28.180
But I do like how this show manages to cut Hitler out of World War II entirely.

15:28.180 --> 15:33.100
Apparently HYDRA originated in a more, like, Russia-ly direction.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.500
How does this contraption turn water into coffee?

15:35.500 --> 15:39.300
Is it coal power, or is it a miracle?

15:39.300 --> 15:43.820
Avengers Assemble, while not officially in the Marvel Cinematic Universe canon, like,

15:43.820 --> 15:47.500
say, Agent Carter, is based off the movie universe.

15:47.500 --> 15:51.660
So, with the exception of the Hulk, who is inexplicably articulate, and Falcon, who does

15:51.660 --> 15:56.540
not share his movie counterpart's backstory, these are basically kiddified versions of

15:56.540 --> 15:57.820
the movie characters.

15:57.820 --> 16:01.740
Anyway, moving on.

16:01.740 --> 16:05.700
Civil War may be the most well-known arc in the comics in which Captain America is a main

16:05.700 --> 16:06.700
player.

16:06.700 --> 16:07.700
Sadly.

16:07.700 --> 16:12.980
The basic premise is that the American government passes a superhuman registration act, Iron

16:12.980 --> 16:16.860
Man supports it, Captain America opposes it, everyone is completely out of character to

16:16.860 --> 16:20.580
make the whole Civil War premise work, and it's terrible.

16:20.580 --> 16:26.700
So it's no real surprise that this, too, was written by odious f**kboy Mark Miller.

16:26.700 --> 16:30.060
Cap is portrayed as a short-sighted reactionary hothead.

16:30.060 --> 16:34.780
Meanwhile, Tony Stark and Reed Richards create some sort of, like, interdimensional space

16:34.780 --> 16:41.020
gulag where they keep unregistered super people in order to make Steve's extremes seem justified.

16:41.020 --> 16:45.620
Civil War ends when he just kind of gives up in issue 7 because fighting is bad and

16:45.620 --> 16:47.260
property damage, you guys.

16:47.260 --> 16:52.140
You know, because he couldn't deduce that superhero fights might cause collateral damage

16:52.140 --> 16:55.620
and cost innocent lives.

16:55.620 --> 17:00.620
Steve is a hot mess, but honestly, the award for character assassination goes to poor Tony.

17:00.620 --> 17:06.220
Although the award for literal character assassination goes to Steve, as he gets assassinated at

17:06.220 --> 17:07.220
the end.

17:07.220 --> 17:11.220
Oh, he comes back.

17:11.220 --> 17:15.220
I don't want to discuss Civil War without mentioning, also, Ed Brubaker's excellent

17:15.220 --> 17:19.780
run on Captain America, which ran before, during, and after Civil War.

17:19.780 --> 17:23.940
Brubaker's run is where the Winter Soldier arc originated, post-assassination, who but

17:23.940 --> 17:26.660
Bucky takes over the role of Captain America.

17:26.660 --> 17:30.180
And the series ties in a lot with Steve's past in World War II.

17:30.180 --> 17:33.620
There's even one scene where Cap praises the French and says,

17:33.620 --> 17:38.020
It really galls me to hear my own people dismissing the French as cowards.

17:38.020 --> 17:43.020
Hmmm.

17:43.020 --> 17:48.020
Next.

17:48.020 --> 17:58.020
So, speaking of military propaganda...

17:58.420 --> 18:04.900
But while this film didn't go down that road, it also doesn't shy away from Captain America's

18:04.900 --> 18:08.660
roots as propaganda either.

18:08.660 --> 18:11.860
This movie opts not to demonize Nazis.

18:11.860 --> 18:18.860
Instead, they are also almost completely omitted in favor of Hydra.

18:21.700 --> 18:26.780
Back to the American ideal, which is a very specific reason of why Steve wants to go to

18:26.780 --> 18:33.780
war in the first place.

18:35.020 --> 18:39.840
Tommy Lee Jones' character has more traditional ideas on power and masculinity and what makes

18:39.840 --> 18:41.100
a good soldier.

18:41.100 --> 18:48.100
In a way, he is describing OG Captain America from the 40s.

18:51.180 --> 18:55.740
But in the end, the super soldier isn't an ultra-masculine jaw puncher, but a chaste,

18:55.740 --> 18:57.420
sensitive artist.

18:57.420 --> 19:04.420
First Steve is intuitive, and then he is self-sacrificing.

19:05.160 --> 19:10.160
His lack of pomposity is what makes the movie work.

19:10.160 --> 19:17.160
That, and Chris Evans, whose face has been kissed by the angels, really perfect casting.

19:18.160 --> 19:25.160
I beg to differ.

19:32.360 --> 19:36.740
Where Captain America, the first Avenger, ends with Steve as unfrozen caveman lawyer,

19:36.740 --> 19:41.720
the Avengers, Avengers assemble in the UK for trademark reasons, serves as Steve's

19:41.720 --> 19:48.720
acclamation to the modern world.

19:50.720 --> 19:54.000
And while we're here, I'm going to quickly touch on this thing that comes up sometimes.

19:54.000 --> 20:01.000
If Steve left the world in 1944, how is he not a huge fucking racist?

20:01.960 --> 20:06.920
Some people really hate the idea of Steve even mucking up by saying something that would

20:06.920 --> 20:11.360
have been totally acceptable in the 40s, but isn't anymore, you know, because Steve

20:11.360 --> 20:13.560
is just that intuitive.

20:13.560 --> 20:19.400
But even if he was the most egalitarian thing that ever lived, he'd probably say something

20:19.400 --> 20:24.400
well-meaning and inappropriate.

20:24.400 --> 20:29.360
But since the MCU is not our universe, and we've got some revisionist history going

20:29.360 --> 20:35.280
down therein because the army in this WWII appears to be totally integrated, I'm going

20:35.320 --> 20:40.320
with different universe, different rules. Yes.

20:46.320 --> 20:48.320
Steve Rogers, perfect human.

20:48.320 --> 20:51.920
Steve's paradigm shift in this one is more in the subtext, which for a movie as full

20:51.920 --> 20:58.920
as this is a good thing. He's a fish out of water, but not obnoxiously so.

20:59.560 --> 21:00.760
I understood that reference.

21:00.760 --> 21:05.760
He still talks like he's performing when his guard is up, and he calls Natasha ma'am all the time.

21:05.760 --> 21:08.560
Captain Rogers. Ma'am.

21:08.560 --> 21:12.840
The closest we ever get to Steve Rogers not perfect human is when he repeatedly tries

21:12.840 --> 21:17.360
to goad Tony into putting on his Iron Man suit so they can punch it out like men.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.280
Put on the suit. Let's go a few rounds.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.280
Put on the suit, let's find out.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.640
I'm not afraid to hit an old man. Put on the suit.

21:23.640 --> 21:28.280
This is very unlike movie Steve, but then there's like an evil Loki thing in the room,

21:28.640 --> 21:32.640
so, you know, okay. His arc is basically can he deal with f***ing Tony Stark.

21:32.640 --> 21:34.640
Wait, wait, hold on. How is this now about me?

21:34.640 --> 21:35.640
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

21:35.640 --> 21:41.240
The modern Captain America stands in some contrast to movies like Man of Steel and Transformers,

21:41.240 --> 21:46.000
which got heavy subsidies from the American military and did require script approval from

21:46.000 --> 21:49.640
the government before they were allowed to receive these subsidies.

21:49.640 --> 21:52.920
Yes, this is still a thing.

21:52.920 --> 21:58.160
The Avengers rather famously sought and was denied the aforementioned DoD subsidy, and

21:58.160 --> 22:02.240
all of this stuff is off the books, so we may never know exactly what went down between

22:02.240 --> 22:04.120
Marvel and, you know, the government.

22:04.120 --> 22:08.360
But apparently the long and short of said denial was that the script wasn't propagandistic

22:08.360 --> 22:09.360
enough.

22:09.360 --> 22:14.200
I recognize the council has made a decision, but given that it's a stupid ass decision,

22:14.200 --> 22:17.400
I've elected to ignore it.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.400
How funny that.

22:31.480 --> 22:35.840
Where Captain America The First Avenger is a coming of age war story, The Winter Soldier

22:35.840 --> 22:38.000
is more of a conspiracy thriller.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.760
At the start of the movie, Steve seems more comfortable with the unfrozen caveman lawyer

22:41.760 --> 22:42.760
thing.

22:42.760 --> 22:44.880
There are subtle changes in his language.

22:44.880 --> 22:47.480
For instance, he isn't calling Natasha ma'am all the time.

22:47.480 --> 22:51.840
Where did Captain America learn how to steal a car?

22:51.840 --> 22:54.040
I see what you did there, movie.

22:54.040 --> 22:57.400
Don't leave me out here!

22:57.400 --> 23:01.400
When he first meets Sam Wilson, he immediately rejects the idea of the good old days as being

23:01.400 --> 23:02.400
a better time.

23:02.400 --> 23:04.240
You must miss the good old days, huh?

23:04.240 --> 23:05.400
Things aren't so bad.

23:05.400 --> 23:06.520
Food's a lot better.

23:06.520 --> 23:08.080
We used to boil everything.

23:08.080 --> 23:09.360
No polio's good.

23:09.360 --> 23:10.720
Internet, so helpful.

23:10.720 --> 23:14.120
He doesn't deify the whole greatest generation thing.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.960
Winter Soldier is also much more topical.

23:15.960 --> 23:19.640
It deals with themes of terrorism and government transparency.

23:19.640 --> 23:24.120
It is considerably less comic book-y in tone than either the first movie or The Avengers,

23:24.120 --> 23:28.740
and Steve's main internal conflict is that of serving the country he knows versus the

23:28.740 --> 23:31.200
changing nature of the country today.

23:31.200 --> 23:37.600
And I thought I could throw myself back in, follow orders, serve.

23:37.600 --> 23:41.360
It's just not the same.

23:41.360 --> 23:46.240
So the Captain America aspect is very front and center in the form of Steve's conflict.

23:46.240 --> 23:50.640
So the mid-movie reveal that almost all of the bad things that have happened to the world

23:50.640 --> 23:55.360
since World War II is because Hydra had infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D.

23:55.360 --> 24:01.040
For 70 years, Hydra has been secretly feeding crisis.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.600
It's lame.

24:03.600 --> 24:04.600
It's extremely lame.

24:04.600 --> 24:05.600
The word is lame.

24:05.600 --> 24:12.680
Hydra created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom.

24:12.680 --> 24:17.440
Like, the movie stops just short of implying that Hydra planned 9-11.

24:17.440 --> 24:21.960
And when history did not cooperate, history was changed.

24:21.960 --> 24:27.120
It's kinda nice to be able to stop blaming all of our problems on misfortune, bad people,

24:27.120 --> 24:31.440
and short-sighted international policy made in America's own self-interest and just say

24:31.440 --> 24:33.440
it's all Hydra's fault.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.160
Hank Glider.

24:35.160 --> 24:39.800
Given that the film deals heavily with government surveillance and with releasing information,

24:39.800 --> 24:42.200
we've come to an interesting full circle.

24:42.200 --> 24:46.800
In the beginning, Cap was a blind patriot, punching for his country without question.

24:46.800 --> 24:51.320
Now he defends American ideals a la Edward Snowden.

24:51.320 --> 24:55.480
Captain America defends freedom by giving the world transparency.

24:55.480 --> 25:01.760
And by letting Bucky punch his face.

25:01.760 --> 25:02.760
Steve Rogers.

25:02.760 --> 25:03.760
Perfect human.

25:03.760 --> 25:07.600
There's been some kerfuffle recently over the current run of all new Captain America

25:07.600 --> 25:10.600
and the fact that Captain America is now black.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.880
Like, it's just some random black dude.

25:12.880 --> 25:14.760
Like, world, it's Sam Wilson.

25:14.760 --> 25:15.760
It's the Falcon.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.320
He's been Steve's partner for decades.

25:17.320 --> 25:25.120
He was in the movie and everything.

25:25.120 --> 25:28.960
While character must have logical reason to be anything other than the default is a really

25:28.960 --> 25:33.160
lame cry for pushing back against more diverse characters, it is especially lame in this

25:33.160 --> 25:34.160
case.

25:34.160 --> 25:38.200
Steve is still there as a character, only now his super serum has worn off and he is

25:38.200 --> 25:39.360
aged.

25:39.360 --> 25:44.320
And Sam Wilson is in the early stages of figuring out what it means for him to be Captain America.

25:44.320 --> 25:48.560
And that is important, because one thing that hasn't changed is American people's desire

25:48.560 --> 25:51.240
to see themselves in Cap.

25:51.240 --> 25:56.680
Even 70 years later, people still expect Cap to uphold what they see as American ideals.

25:56.680 --> 26:00.040
But that is part of why he is Steve Rogers' perfect human.

26:00.040 --> 26:05.120
People from all political walks of life can aspire to be compassionate, intuitive, trustworthy,

26:05.120 --> 26:07.520
adaptable, and just.

26:07.520 --> 26:13.000
And that is just the character that Captain America has evolved into.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.720
As long as Mark Miller isn't writing him.

26:15.720 --> 26:25.440
If it doesn't stand for France, what does A stand for?

26:25.440 --> 26:30.880
Perhaps it stands for Abstract Personifications of Unfathomable Beings, this being the theme

26:30.880 --> 26:34.320
chosen by my patrons on Patreon for the next episode.

26:34.320 --> 26:36.680
So here are your three options.

26:36.680 --> 26:39.960
If it's not clear, the options are God, Satan, and Death.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.800
So those are the choices.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.400
Here's the link for you to vote.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.720
The link is also below the video.

26:45.720 --> 26:50.320
If you like this show, please consider supporting it on Patreon, and I will announce the winner

26:50.320 --> 26:55.720
of this thing a couple of days on my Twitter, which is here.

26:55.720 --> 27:01.360
Every fifth video will be my choice, so the video after next is not going up for a vote.

27:01.360 --> 27:02.640
It will be my choice.

27:02.640 --> 27:03.640
Live in fear, people.

27:03.640 --> 27:05.920
Thank you for watching, and thank you for playing.

27:21.320 --> 27:22.320
Bye.

27:22.320 --> 27:22.320
