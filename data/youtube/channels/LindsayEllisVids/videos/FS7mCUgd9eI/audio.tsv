0	9240	Here's a question.
9240	13160	Captain America is not the first character that was created as war propaganda, but he
13160	16760	is certainly the most enduring and widely known.
16760	18560	Blindly patriotic Hitler puncher?
18560	19960	He's been that.
19960	20960	Anti-government dissident?
20960	22760	He's been that too.
22760	25360	Jingoistic France hater?
25360	26640	Yes.
27080	30680	Most often, he has been the defender of the defenseless, regardless of what country they
30680	32040	hail from.
32040	35280	Because that's what America does, right?
35280	38120	Riiiiiiiight?
38120	42600	Hugely popular during the war, Cap was revived in 1964 and has remained one of Marvel's
42600	44760	most popular characters ever since.
44760	49040	But he's not just any super person, he's Captain America.
49040	55320	So how has his American-ness and the changing landscape of American culture influenced his
55520	57240	many iterations over the years?
57240	64320	Well, prepare to be unfrozen many times over, this is Loose Cannon, Captain America.
64320	88480	The superhero genre was only about three years old when Cap punched his way onto the
88480	89480	scene.
89480	95080	In 1941, Timely Comics released Captain America Comics No. 1, a full nine months before the
95080	99400	US even declared war, and it became very popular very quickly.
99400	103240	Once the US did go to war, Captain America comics were sent in huge numbers to American
103240	104720	troops overseas.
104720	111840	And in contrast to the jaded troops we see in the 2011 film, Captain America comics were
111840	113840	actually super popular.
113840	119600	They were cheap, easy-to-ship entertainment that also boosted morale.
119600	123840	Troops saw themselves in the stalwart manly Cap, and the kids back home saw themselves
123840	130240	in Bucky Barnes, Captain America's young… ward sidekick.
130240	134920	Captain America's enemies were usually fictionalized Nazi types, the Red Skull being the most popular
134920	135920	and enduring.
135920	139880	Steve Rogers, in contrast, is strong, pure, and masculine.
139880	142520	He has no interest in the underlying cause of the conflicts.
142520	146760	Like all comic heroes of the day, he just knows that punching faces will solve the problem
146760	147920	forever.
147920	154400	The German-Jewish defector scientist, originally Dr. Reinstein, a very thinly veiled allusion
154400	159680	to the real story of Albert Einstein, leaves Germany and helps the US invent a super serum
159680	164200	to create an army of super soldiers, but then he's killed by a Nazi assassin and Steve
164200	165400	ends up the only one.
165400	168440	But it's okay, because now we have Captain America.
168440	174000	So in a way, Steve Rogers is like… the atomic bomb.
174000	177320	You know, if we had made only one.
177320	179920	And he became a popular franchise character.
179920	185240	Normally this sort of Frankenstein story is a cautionary, don't play God kind of thing,
185240	186960	but hey, it's war.
186960	188440	Works out fine for Steve.
188440	190320	Yeah, we got our own uber mention.
190320	192440	He doesn't like you, Hitler.
192440	195640	Cap didn't work out too well in the post-war context.
195640	201400	Unlike Superman, who didn't have the very specific defeat-Hitler reason for being, Captain
201400	204840	America became a little… lost.
204840	209160	In the 1950s, the comics industry created the CCA as a monitoring agent at the height
209160	210640	of the McCarthy era.
210640	216120	This resulted in Cap being rebranded as a commie smasher.
216120	222180	Because of course, this version did not do too well and the comic folded in 1954.
222180	224080	So that was that.
224080	225080	Not quite.
225080	229080	When Captain America throws his mighty shield.
229080	235400	The company by 1964, known as Marvel Comics, decided, hey, let's bring Captain America
235400	238600	back and make him part of the nascent Avengers.
238600	240320	Captain Commie Smasher got retconned.
240320	245000	See, the real Steve Rogers disappeared with Bucky Barnes in 1944.
245000	249440	Neither of their bodies were found, both were presumed dead, until the Avengers find him
249440	251320	frozen in the North Atlantic.
251320	256480	Cap also has one of the more homogenous origin stories, so strap in, we're about to see
256480	258400	a lot of white dudes get thawed.
258400	263840	It is here that Captain America finally has a defining character trait, besides punching.
263840	268400	Being the man out of time, and reconciling his identity as an American icon with the
268400	270360	constantly changing times.
270360	273720	Since the 60s, Cap has been a mainstay of the Avengers, as well as a star of his own
273720	274720	title.
274720	280680	In 1969, he partnered with Marvel's first African-American superhero, African-American.
280800	283000	Black Panther is African.
283000	285080	Sam Wilson, aka the Falcon.
285080	290760	In fact, for most of the 70s, the book was rebranded as Captain America and the Falcon.
290760	296760	And given that Vietnam just happened, and we're not too, like, patriotic in the 70s,
296760	299480	how did Cap spend his days back then?
299480	305720	Why, helping the Falcon patrol Harlem, and keeping the kids off the street, of course.
305720	313640	Captain America and the Falcon dealt heavily with issues of race, and class, and race,
313640	315400	and race.
315400	317360	It is fabulous.
317360	321880	But being Captain America, his relationship with his country and his in-universe place
321880	325120	as an American icon is a recurring theme.
325120	327240	He sits Vietnam out altogether.
327240	331760	After Watergate, Steve resigns as Captain America, and becomes Nomad, the man without
331760	333960	a country.
333960	337840	That's actually a lot less emo than it sounds, and it didn't last terribly long.
337840	342080	He resigned again during the Reagan administration, because he won't go along with the government's
342080	346400	idea of what he should be, since the government owns the rights to Captain America or something.
346400	349000	His replacement embodied a very different American ideal.
349000	352680	John Walker had a jingoistic attitude that reflected a large segment of American culture
352680	353680	during the Reagan years.
353680	356400	He's more of a Rambo than a Chris Evans.
356400	360760	So when Steve does eventually reassume his alter ego, he decides that the Captain America
360760	367080	identity is a symbol of America's ideals, rather than its government.
367080	368720	Who decides these ideals?
368720	369720	Steve.
369720	371800	And, you know, whoever is writing him.
371800	377640	I'm just going to skip talking about the 90s, except you should know that Cap was a werewolf
377640	380240	at one point.
380240	382560	He was a werewolf.
382560	384560	Now let's talk about the adaptations.
384560	395000	He shook so many of them out of the trees that they coined a nickname for him.
395000	397880	Captain America.
397880	398880	Captain America?
398880	403560	After the success of The Incredible Hulk and Wonder Woman, CBS thought, hey, who else can
403560	405880	we make a superhero show out of?
405880	410600	And what more obvious a choice to capture the late 70s disillusionment with the US and
410600	423160	the economic ennui than Captain America?
423160	428120	CBS ended up commissioning two TV movies, and while the first one is considerably worse
428120	432840	than the second, due mostly to the presence of slumming Christopher Lee in the sequel,
432840	437880	they are both pretty bad.
437880	443800	Steve Rogers is played by former USC football player and future Big McLarge Huge, Reb Brown.
443800	446960	He is not a soldier, nor does he aspire to be.
446960	456200	In fact, I'm not sure what he is really other than, like, you know, an easy rider.
456200	460680	Some science types want him to do the serum for some reason.
460680	462560	He doesn't want to.
462560	463560	Because.
464560	468560	I just want to kick back and find out who I am.
468560	470240	Hey, I don't need this.
470240	475280	Steve drives off a cliff early on, damaging only his shirt because the bad guys or something.
475280	479640	The second time he drives off a cliff, turns out maybe it's going to be a problem, and
479640	483480	the scientists super serum him in order to save his life.
483480	491320	So this version goes down as the only one where his injection is non-consensual.
491320	496040	He eventually adopts the moniker Captain America because his father embodied the American
496040	497040	Ideal.
497040	500840	You'll sense that he believed in the American Ideal and he tried to live it.
500840	504680	Really a lot, somehow, and people called him Captain America as a joke.
504680	509440	If I'm going to be Captain America, I want to be the same Captain America my father was
509440	510440	in every way.
510440	516680	I don't just want to do the things he did, I want to look the way he did as well.
516680	519480	Because.
519480	524120	For reasons that I'm sure made sense at the time, CBS mandated that the film not be
524120	525840	too close to the comics.
525840	530820	And the result only resembles Captain America in that he's the product of a drug experiment
530820	533500	and that's pretty much it.
533500	538560	And they are trying to make the Captain America thing work and it just lands with an unimaginable
538560	539560	thud.
539560	540960	It's perfect.
540960	543000	Be Captain America, Steve.
543000	545660	Jam Captain America down their throats.
545660	550180	The late 70s, being a time of disillusionment in the American dream and a crumbling economy,
550180	555260	was not a great atmosphere for a Captain America TV show.
555260	561660	But even that doesn't excuse the bewildering choices made for this sucker.
561660	573660	Onward.
573660	582300	From the director of Cyborg, Nemesis, and Cyborg Nemesis, and starring Matt Salinger
582300	589120	of J.D. Salinger's son fame, this starts not with the Captain's childhood backstory
589120	592780	but Red Skull's.
592780	596060	This version didn't have a theatrical release because when the studio took a look at the
596060	599820	finished product it went nope, we are not releasing that.
599820	601260	Direct to video it is.
601260	606540	But the first third does take place in the 40s, which looks an awful lot like the 80s.
606540	611780	So after the super serum he goes on his first mission and fails utterly and immediately.
611780	616700	50 years later he gets unfrozen and the president sends his chunk friend, played by Ned Beatty
616700	624740	instead of Secret Service, military, sled dogs, anyone, to Alaska to get Steve after
624740	627020	he has been an unfrozen caveman lawyer.
627140	638220	Seeing this guy's German and Japanese devices, he steals the guy's car.
638220	639780	Captain America!
639780	647060	This is not the only time in the film he steals a car, by the way.
647060	652160	Like the Red, Brown, and Hell, even the 1944 serial version, the fact that he's Captain
652160	654500	America is completely incidental.
654500	659980	This guy is Captain America in that he is a xenophobic asshole who steals cars.
659980	662980	Don't leave me out here!
662980	663980	Next!
667740	674740	The Ultimates was intended to be a more realistic and gritty reboot of the Marvel Universe.
674740	679460	But this book was running alongside the likes of Grant Morrison's New X-Men, which was already
679460	681740	plenty that.
681740	688780	So in order to differentiate itself, the Ultimate Universe had to go really grimdark.
688780	693220	Enter Mark Miller, patron saint of angry 13-year-old boys.
693220	699100	Ultimate Captain America is less an EXTREME version and more a logical alternative.
699100	705500	I say logical in that some people have argued, hey, wouldn't a guy from the 40s be kind of
705500	709620	a jingoistic belligerent prick?
709620	713060	This version of Steve hangs out at the old folks' home because he can't relate to the
713060	714060	modern folk.
714060	715060	You know what?
715060	716060	Sure.
716060	717060	Why not?
717060	720780	He also hits people while they're defenseless and starts fights when he's angry.
720780	725220	He later murders his enemies after they are beaten and defenseless.
725220	728980	Propping up the ugly post-911 attitude on countries that weren't wild about American
728980	733940	foreign policy at the time, Ultimates also gives us probably the most infamous frame
733940	739500	of all of the Captain America comics, and it gets a full page, too.
739500	743900	And then an entire panel in the following issue congratulating itself on what a funny
743900	745620	joke that was.
745620	750140	Personally, I don't think someone for whom fighting alongside the French Resistance was
750140	756980	only a few months ago to him would be towing the party line of Freedom Fries, but hey.
756980	760500	It's not a completely unfair interpretation, and there is something interesting about the
760500	765220	idea that Steve is genuinely unable to relate to anyone under the age of 80.
765220	771060	Even so, it figures that this would be the only version who eventually becomes president.
771060	774940	Next!
774940	779580	Marvel's 1602 was a one-off miniseries written by Neil Gaiman, the basic thrust being that
779580	784220	the events of the Marvel Universe took place 400 years earlier, and they centered around
784220	786300	the Roanoke Colony in Virginia.
786300	792260	Blond-haired, blue-eyed Steve Rogers is the Native American bodyguard to Virginia Dare,
792260	793260	Raj Haas.
793260	796180	See, it only made sense to me once I said it out loud.
796180	800300	The Native American part is sort of hand-waved away with like, oh, some Welshman must have
800300	804020	gotten fresh with one of the natives like 20, 30 years ago.
804020	808780	But where all of the other characters are actually of their time, albeit like mutants,
808780	815020	it turns out that Raj Haas is the actual Captain America who was sent back in time from a future
815060	816740	fascist America.
816740	820820	And it's Steve's presence in the past that makes it so the heroes of his time appear
820820	823820	400 years earlier instead of as we know it.
823820	827340	So he's gotta go back to the future or the universe will explode.
827340	830060	Only, he doesn't want to go back, you guys.
830060	834820	See, now that he's in the past, he can make it so all the American bad never happens,
834820	835820	you know?
835820	841020	We can circumvent the genocide of the natives, we can make it so slavery is never a thing,
841020	847380	no McCarthyism, no Scientology, no Space Jam, but Nick Fury tricks him into going back,
847380	851460	so no better future America for you, Cap.
851460	853220	Nice try, though.
853220	854220	Moving on.
854220	859140	There are roughly one shit million Marvel cartoons from the last 15 years, and about
859140	864060	half of them are Avengers-type things, and Captain America at least cameos in all of
864060	865060	them.
865100	867100	There are… some.
873140	876940	Ultimate Avengers, as implied by the title, is loosely based on the first Ultimate's
876940	877940	limited run.
877940	879460	It is boring and unremarkable.
879460	880460	Hitler's dead!
880460	881460	Except for that.
881460	882460	Red Skull!
882460	887740	I can't believe somebody found you and thawed you out!
887740	894020	The Superhero Squad show is the rare Marvel-based comedy, so the unfrozen caveman lawyer aspect
894020	898900	is not only played up, it seems to be Captain America's main defining attribute.
898900	899900	Karaoke!
899900	900900	It's Japanese!
900900	905620	Yes, the Japanese are on our side now, and I bid them welcome.
905620	907860	He's so happy we're friends.
907860	908860	You're safe!
908860	911060	You're with friends!
911060	912100	What are you?
912100	913100	Some kind of hydro-automaton?
913100	914100	Listen!
914100	918620	Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes marks the first attempted tie-in with the Marvel
918620	919980	Cinematic Universe.
919980	921940	It is also unremarkable.
921940	928180	But I do like how this show manages to cut Hitler out of World War II entirely.
928180	933100	Apparently HYDRA originated in a more, like, Russia-ly direction.
933100	935500	How does this contraption turn water into coffee?
935500	939300	Is it coal power, or is it a miracle?
939300	943820	Avengers Assemble, while not officially in the Marvel Cinematic Universe canon, like,
943820	947500	say, Agent Carter, is based off the movie universe.
947500	951660	So, with the exception of the Hulk, who is inexplicably articulate, and Falcon, who does
951660	956540	not share his movie counterpart's backstory, these are basically kiddified versions of
956540	957820	the movie characters.
957820	961740	Anyway, moving on.
961740	965700	Civil War may be the most well-known arc in the comics in which Captain America is a main
965700	966700	player.
966700	967700	Sadly.
967700	972980	The basic premise is that the American government passes a superhuman registration act, Iron
972980	976860	Man supports it, Captain America opposes it, everyone is completely out of character to
976860	980580	make the whole Civil War premise work, and it's terrible.
980580	986700	So it's no real surprise that this, too, was written by odious f**kboy Mark Miller.
986700	990060	Cap is portrayed as a short-sighted reactionary hothead.
990060	994780	Meanwhile, Tony Stark and Reed Richards create some sort of, like, interdimensional space
994780	1001020	gulag where they keep unregistered super people in order to make Steve's extremes seem justified.
1001020	1005620	Civil War ends when he just kind of gives up in issue 7 because fighting is bad and
1005620	1007260	property damage, you guys.
1007260	1012140	You know, because he couldn't deduce that superhero fights might cause collateral damage
1012140	1015620	and cost innocent lives.
1015620	1020620	Steve is a hot mess, but honestly, the award for character assassination goes to poor Tony.
1020620	1026220	Although the award for literal character assassination goes to Steve, as he gets assassinated at
1026220	1027220	the end.
1027220	1031220	Oh, he comes back.
1031220	1035220	I don't want to discuss Civil War without mentioning, also, Ed Brubaker's excellent
1035220	1039780	run on Captain America, which ran before, during, and after Civil War.
1039780	1043940	Brubaker's run is where the Winter Soldier arc originated, post-assassination, who but
1043940	1046660	Bucky takes over the role of Captain America.
1046660	1050180	And the series ties in a lot with Steve's past in World War II.
1050180	1053620	There's even one scene where Cap praises the French and says,
1053620	1058020	It really galls me to hear my own people dismissing the French as cowards.
1058020	1063020	Hmmm.
1063020	1068020	Next.
1068020	1078020	So, speaking of military propaganda...
1078420	1084900	But while this film didn't go down that road, it also doesn't shy away from Captain America's
1084900	1088660	roots as propaganda either.
1088660	1091860	This movie opts not to demonize Nazis.
1091860	1098860	Instead, they are also almost completely omitted in favor of Hydra.
1101700	1106780	Back to the American ideal, which is a very specific reason of why Steve wants to go to
1106780	1113780	war in the first place.
1115020	1119840	Tommy Lee Jones' character has more traditional ideas on power and masculinity and what makes
1119840	1121100	a good soldier.
1121100	1128100	In a way, he is describing OG Captain America from the 40s.
1131180	1135740	But in the end, the super soldier isn't an ultra-masculine jaw puncher, but a chaste,
1135740	1137420	sensitive artist.
1137420	1144420	First Steve is intuitive, and then he is self-sacrificing.
1145160	1150160	His lack of pomposity is what makes the movie work.
1150160	1157160	That, and Chris Evans, whose face has been kissed by the angels, really perfect casting.
1158160	1165160	I beg to differ.
1172360	1176740	Where Captain America, the first Avenger, ends with Steve as unfrozen caveman lawyer,
1176740	1181720	the Avengers, Avengers assemble in the UK for trademark reasons, serves as Steve's
1181720	1188720	acclamation to the modern world.
1190720	1194000	And while we're here, I'm going to quickly touch on this thing that comes up sometimes.
1194000	1201000	If Steve left the world in 1944, how is he not a huge fucking racist?
1201960	1206920	Some people really hate the idea of Steve even mucking up by saying something that would
1206920	1211360	have been totally acceptable in the 40s, but isn't anymore, you know, because Steve
1211360	1213560	is just that intuitive.
1213560	1219400	But even if he was the most egalitarian thing that ever lived, he'd probably say something
1219400	1224400	well-meaning and inappropriate.
1224400	1229360	But since the MCU is not our universe, and we've got some revisionist history going
1229360	1235280	down therein because the army in this WWII appears to be totally integrated, I'm going
1235320	1240320	with different universe, different rules. Yes.
1246320	1248320	Steve Rogers, perfect human.
1248320	1251920	Steve's paradigm shift in this one is more in the subtext, which for a movie as full
1251920	1258920	as this is a good thing. He's a fish out of water, but not obnoxiously so.
1259560	1260760	I understood that reference.
1260760	1265760	He still talks like he's performing when his guard is up, and he calls Natasha ma'am all the time.
1265760	1268560	Captain Rogers. Ma'am.
1268560	1272840	The closest we ever get to Steve Rogers not perfect human is when he repeatedly tries
1272840	1277360	to goad Tony into putting on his Iron Man suit so they can punch it out like men.
1277360	1280280	Put on the suit. Let's go a few rounds.
1280280	1281280	Put on the suit, let's find out.
1281280	1283640	I'm not afraid to hit an old man. Put on the suit.
1283640	1288280	This is very unlike movie Steve, but then there's like an evil Loki thing in the room,
1288640	1292640	so, you know, okay. His arc is basically can he deal with f***ing Tony Stark.
1292640	1294640	Wait, wait, hold on. How is this now about me?
1294640	1295640	I'm sorry, isn't everything?
1295640	1301240	The modern Captain America stands in some contrast to movies like Man of Steel and Transformers,
1301240	1306000	which got heavy subsidies from the American military and did require script approval from
1306000	1309640	the government before they were allowed to receive these subsidies.
1309640	1312920	Yes, this is still a thing.
1312920	1318160	The Avengers rather famously sought and was denied the aforementioned DoD subsidy, and
1318160	1322240	all of this stuff is off the books, so we may never know exactly what went down between
1322240	1324120	Marvel and, you know, the government.
1324120	1328360	But apparently the long and short of said denial was that the script wasn't propagandistic
1328360	1329360	enough.
1329360	1334200	I recognize the council has made a decision, but given that it's a stupid ass decision,
1334200	1337400	I've elected to ignore it.
1337400	1339400	How funny that.
1351480	1355840	Where Captain America The First Avenger is a coming of age war story, The Winter Soldier
1355840	1358000	is more of a conspiracy thriller.
1358000	1361760	At the start of the movie, Steve seems more comfortable with the unfrozen caveman lawyer
1361760	1362760	thing.
1362760	1364880	There are subtle changes in his language.
1364880	1367480	For instance, he isn't calling Natasha ma'am all the time.
1367480	1371840	Where did Captain America learn how to steal a car?
1371840	1374040	I see what you did there, movie.
1374040	1377400	Don't leave me out here!
1377400	1381400	When he first meets Sam Wilson, he immediately rejects the idea of the good old days as being
1381400	1382400	a better time.
1382400	1384240	You must miss the good old days, huh?
1384240	1385400	Things aren't so bad.
1385400	1386520	Food's a lot better.
1386520	1388080	We used to boil everything.
1388080	1389360	No polio's good.
1389360	1390720	Internet, so helpful.
1390720	1394120	He doesn't deify the whole greatest generation thing.
1394160	1395960	Winter Soldier is also much more topical.
1395960	1399640	It deals with themes of terrorism and government transparency.
1399640	1404120	It is considerably less comic book-y in tone than either the first movie or The Avengers,
1404120	1408740	and Steve's main internal conflict is that of serving the country he knows versus the
1408740	1411200	changing nature of the country today.
1411200	1417600	And I thought I could throw myself back in, follow orders, serve.
1417600	1421360	It's just not the same.
1421360	1426240	So the Captain America aspect is very front and center in the form of Steve's conflict.
1426240	1430640	So the mid-movie reveal that almost all of the bad things that have happened to the world
1430640	1435360	since World War II is because Hydra had infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D.
1435360	1441040	For 70 years, Hydra has been secretly feeding crisis.
1441040	1443600	It's lame.
1443600	1444600	It's extremely lame.
1444600	1445600	The word is lame.
1445600	1452680	Hydra created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom.
1452680	1457440	Like, the movie stops just short of implying that Hydra planned 9-11.
1457440	1461960	And when history did not cooperate, history was changed.
1461960	1467120	It's kinda nice to be able to stop blaming all of our problems on misfortune, bad people,
1467120	1471440	and short-sighted international policy made in America's own self-interest and just say
1471440	1473440	it's all Hydra's fault.
1474000	1475160	Hank Glider.
1475160	1479800	Given that the film deals heavily with government surveillance and with releasing information,
1479800	1482200	we've come to an interesting full circle.
1482200	1486800	In the beginning, Cap was a blind patriot, punching for his country without question.
1486800	1491320	Now he defends American ideals a la Edward Snowden.
1491320	1495480	Captain America defends freedom by giving the world transparency.
1495480	1501760	And by letting Bucky punch his face.
1501760	1502760	Steve Rogers.
1502760	1503760	Perfect human.
1503760	1507600	There's been some kerfuffle recently over the current run of all new Captain America
1507600	1510600	and the fact that Captain America is now black.
1510600	1512880	Like, it's just some random black dude.
1512880	1514760	Like, world, it's Sam Wilson.
1514760	1515760	It's the Falcon.
1515760	1517320	He's been Steve's partner for decades.
1517320	1525120	He was in the movie and everything.
1525120	1528960	While character must have logical reason to be anything other than the default is a really
1528960	1533160	lame cry for pushing back against more diverse characters, it is especially lame in this
1533160	1534160	case.
1534160	1538200	Steve is still there as a character, only now his super serum has worn off and he is
1538200	1539360	aged.
1539360	1544320	And Sam Wilson is in the early stages of figuring out what it means for him to be Captain America.
1544320	1548560	And that is important, because one thing that hasn't changed is American people's desire
1548560	1551240	to see themselves in Cap.
1551240	1556680	Even 70 years later, people still expect Cap to uphold what they see as American ideals.
1556680	1560040	But that is part of why he is Steve Rogers' perfect human.
1560040	1565120	People from all political walks of life can aspire to be compassionate, intuitive, trustworthy,
1565120	1567520	adaptable, and just.
1567520	1573000	And that is just the character that Captain America has evolved into.
1573000	1575720	As long as Mark Miller isn't writing him.
1575720	1585440	If it doesn't stand for France, what does A stand for?
1585440	1590880	Perhaps it stands for Abstract Personifications of Unfathomable Beings, this being the theme
1590880	1594320	chosen by my patrons on Patreon for the next episode.
