0	4840	Obligatory Christmas episode, time to take a look at the nice fat man who breaks into your house once a year.
4840	12740	ðŸŽµ
13420	17060	So Santa Claus is probably the most obvious candidate for a loose cannon...
17680	22580	...ever, but before we get into the shit million versions of Santa Claus out there,
22580	26080	or at least a small sampling of them, let's go through some history.
27080	32580	Santa and his periphery spring from a marriage of Christian and pagan traditions from throughout Northern Europe,
32580	36380	coming together in the United States and forming a sort of folklore melange
36380	40380	who's a lot more nice, non-threatening, and marketable than his European forebears.
40380	44880	Saint Nicholas hails from the Netherlands, and his legend descends from the historical Saint Nicholas,
44880	50580	eventually morphing into the stern but just horse-riding fellow who gives presents to children in early December every year
50580	55880	and who maintains in his, um, employ six to eight black men.
55880	62680	The Germans had a gift-bringer character promulgated by Martin Luther after the Reformation called Christ Child, or Christkindl.
62680	65980	This was originally intended by Luther to be the literal Christ Child,
65980	69780	but eventually it turned into more of like a generic angel child figure.
69780	72880	Once in the Americas, this was anglicized to Kris Kringle.
72880	75580	Santa also descends from the English figure of Father Christmas,
75580	79780	who has descended more from pagan traditions than Christian ones and then eventually merged with them.
79780	83380	He makes an uncredited cameo in a Christmas carol as the ghost of Christmas present
83480	87780	and carries a more Bacchanalian sort of jollity compared to the more austere Saint Nicholas.
87780	90080	In Dutch, Saint Nicholas is called Sinterklaas,
90080	93780	and since New York was a Dutch colony that eventually got colonized by the English,
93780	98280	Sinterklaas was anglicized to Santa Claus, forming a new character altogether,
98280	102080	one who also goes by Saint Nick, Father Christmas, and Kris Kringle.
102080	105680	The modern image of Santa really solidified in the Americas in the 1800s
105680	108480	with the publishing of the poem The Night Before Christmas,
108480	111180	which also integrated the whole chimney and reindeer thing.
111180	114880	By the early 20th century, the idea of Santa that we have today was pretty much set.
114880	119380	In fact, one of the first narrative films ever, released in 1898 and called Santa Claus,
119380	121880	also features some of the first-ever visual effects.
121880	127180	But also codified in by the turn of the century was his connection to the idea of childhood, innocence, and purity.
127180	129380	While no longer explicitly a religious figure,
129380	133280	he still maintained a sort of sanctity to him, and does to this day.
133280	137880	In households that celebrate Christmas and still maintain the Santa tradition with the children,
137880	141580	which in the United States counts for most of them,
141580	145380	realizing that Santa isn't real is almost kind of a rite of passage.
145380	148980	So when it comes to pop-cultural depictions of Santa Claus in film and television,
148980	151180	especially of the more recent varietal,
151180	154380	the operative word for most depictions of Santa is transgression.
158580	163680	By the time you're old enough to have a grasp on concepts like narrative and character,
163680	167180	you've probably also figured out that Santa is not real.
167280	171080	And for those of you who haven't, sorry, spoilers.
171080	173380	You see the same thing with characters like Mickey Mouse.
173380	177180	These things that were pure and simple in childhood no longer apply to adulthood.
177180	182780	So there's this weird thrill with making Santa flawed, or surrounding Santa by flawed things.
182780	186980	This is why the concept of transgression as it applies to Santa is so appealing in modern media.
186980	190680	And notable non-Santas, like Billy Bob Thornton's Bad Santa,
190680	192680	are popular enough to at least warrant a sequel.
192680	196980	Because it's literally challenging the innocence of childhood, and that never gets old.
197580	201780	Transgressive elements against Santa Claus are a popular element in television comedy in particular.
201780	203580	I never thought it would end this way.
203580	205480	Gunned down by Santa Claus.
205480	210080	In Futurama, Santa is a murderous robot who comes to terrorize humanity every Christmas Eve,
210080	213980	owing to a glitch that makes his criteria for who is naughty way too high.
213980	216080	You've been very naughty, Brian Lela.
216080	217580	I checked my list.
217580	218780	Well, check it twice.
218780	221380	I perform over 50 mega-checks per second.
221380	222880	And yes, that is John Goodman.
222880	228480	An episode of The Simpsons had Grandpa Simpson being abandoned on an island with Mr. Burns during World War II by Santa.
228480	232280	Grandpa vows revenge for this, but turns out that Santa's only human.
232280	234880	Why didn't you ever come back to pick me up?
234880	239480	I kept putting it off, and then I was just too embarrassed.
239480	242380	American Dad incorporates a revenge element.
242380	245080	There's an episode where Stan and Steve accidentally kill Santa Claus,
245080	250180	only to have him resurrected and have his entire army out for revenge against the entire Smith family.
250180	253580	Meanwhile, in Family Guy, Santa is more of an overburdened union leader
253580	257480	who is ready to throw in the towel on this whole hyper-consumerist Christmas thing.
257480	262780	But now instead, all we're feeling is dread, because Christmas time is killing us!
262780	265680	Now, of course, not all modern Santas take the transgressive approach
265680	268480	that challenges the innocence and purity of a character like Santa.
268480	272980	Some are pretty straightforward, but the concept of transgression as it applies to Santa is a popular one,
272980	277380	especially as it tends to end up back in pretty conventional place of maintaining the status quo.
277380	279780	Guy learns the value of family and Christmas,
279780	282280	cynical child learns to believe in Santa,
282280	285480	kidnapped Santa gets un-kidnapped, and so on.
285480	287780	Even the Futurama episode does this.
287780	291280	Although, granted, the status quo that they return to is the horrible dystopian one.
291280	295880	Don't you see? Fear has brought us together! That's the magic of X-mas!
295880	299180	The most straightforward adaptations in regular circulation in the United States
299180	302280	are the Rankin and Bass stop-motion classics from the 60s and 70s,
302280	304580	which still air on network television every year,
304580	308780	and I think once a year is just long enough for people to forget how boring these are.
309780	311580	I'm sorry, they are!
311580	317280	Now, there were a ton of these, varying in quality, but ultimately pretty samey in terms of portrayal,
317280	318880	so I'm not gonna go through all of them.
318880	322480	Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is easily the best and most memorable of this group,
322480	325980	plus it has far and away the best music, as well as some of the most iconic characters.
325980	329480	This is the one that gave us Yukon, Cornelius, and the Bumble,
329480	331780	which I'm sure you've seen in your local Spencer's Gifts.
331780	335980	Being about Rudolph, Santa is barely in this one, aside from doing what the song said he would.
336480	342880	Rudolph, with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
342880	345880	Miracle on 34th Street is comfortably regarded as a classic.
345880	346880	I'm Santa Claus.
348380	351280	Oh, you don't believe that, do you?
351280	351880	Mm-mm.
351880	354980	A guy claiming to be Santa gets hired at the Macy's in Herald Square
354980	357080	because he's just so good at being Santa.
357080	359480	And he's kind of method, and everyone's like,
359580	361380	Well, it's fine. He's harmless.
361380	362480	Until this happens.
363680	364180	Ow!
364880	365780	Damn.
365780	367680	Father-aggravated assault-ness.
367680	369180	Then it turns into a courtroom drama,
369180	372780	wherein ultimately the defense has to prove that the guy who lives in a nursing home
372780	376580	and calls himself Kris Kringle is, in fact, the real Santa Claus.
376580	378480	Also, Maureen O'Hara needs to learn to love again,
378480	382880	and Cynical Child needs to de-cynical and learn the magic of childhood.
382880	385680	The way they eventually get around this is that the U.S. Postal Service
385680	387980	delivers letters addressed to Santa to this guy,
387980	391480	meaning that the U.S. Postal Service, and by extension, the U.S. federal government,
391480	393580	recognize him as Santa, so there you go.
393580	394980	Case literally dismissed.
394980	399180	Since the United States government declares this man to be Santa Claus,
399180	401180	this court will not dispute it.
401180	401980	Case dismissed.
401980	404680	Miracle on 34th Street was remade four times
404680	407180	and was also adapted into a Broadway musical.
407180	409380	Thomas Mitchell played him in 1955,
409380	411180	Ed Wynn played him in 1959,
411180	413480	Sebastian Cabot played him in 1973,
413480	416180	and Sir Richard Attenborough played him in 1994.
417180	419680	The 1994 remake, starring Richard Attenborough,
419680	422480	takes a more Russell's teapot existential approach,
422480	426880	with the judge ultimately ruling that he can't prove Chris isn't Santa
426880	428880	because he can't prove a negative,
428880	431780	and the U.S. government currency supports the existence of God,
431780	433280	which also cannot be proven,
433280	435780	and it seems like a touch of the old false equivalency.
435780	439080	If the government of the United States can issue its currency
439080	441680	bearing a declaration of trust in God
441680	445780	without demanding physical evidence of the existence
445780	449080	or the non-existence of a greater being...
449080	453280	I mean, children don't pledge allegiance to one nation under Santa,
453280	454280	but okay.
454280	457280	Here the incident that gets Chris in trouble is a lot more pronounced
457280	459480	and arguably justified.
459480	462780	Rather than whapping a guy on the head during an argument about psychiatry,
462780	466880	this guy who is a plant kind of insinuates that Chris might be a pedophile?
467680	469880	You got a thing for the little ones, huh?
469880	470480	Huh?
470480	471580	Huh?
472580	474580	Cause he ain't much good for nothing else, huh?
474580	476980	Dang, I might give him an umbrella to the head, too.
476980	480380	Anyway, the 47 version is a classic and better by most metrics
480380	482780	and actually uses the word Macy's.
482780	484780	Macy's, sending people to tell the story.
484780	488180	But for my money, I prefer Attenborough's warmth and vulnerability.
488180	490380	Plus the fact that he doesn't pull shit like this.
490380	491380	Ow!
493380	496180	Oh, my outfit!
496180	498180	What is it, Mr. Bruce?
498380	502380	The 1960s saw a surprising number of terrible movies starring Santa.
502380	505980	The transgressive element here isn't so much Santa adopting new character traits
505980	509180	â€”he's still a pretty nice guy with a pretty consistent personalityâ€”
509180	512980	but rather, taking on decidedly non-Santa-like roles.
512980	515980	Oh! Oh, Mr. Santa!
515980	522180	I was reuniting everybody to form an army and fight the ogre!
522180	523980	So many questions.
523980	526380	The most well-known of these terrible 60s Santa movies
526380	528780	is probably Santa Claus Conquers the Martian,
528780	532180	by virtue of having been popularized by a Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode
532180	533580	some 30 years later.
533580	536380	Nixon and Vixen and Nixon!
536380	538380	Uh, yes, and what's in the pipes, huh?
538380	542180	Santa doesn't so much conquer the Martians as get kidnapped by them
542180	546780	and eventually negotiate for his and his fellow kidnappees' release.
546780	549780	He always has a pretty good sense of humor about the whole thing, though.
549780	555180	I wish you and yours the very best of everything.
555180	557980	On Mars, children aren't allowed to be children, see?
557980	559980	And this also has the whole
559980	563780	bring-back-the-innocence-of-childhood-and-let-children-be-children thing.
563780	567980	Basically, there was this entire subgenre of Santa movies that were genre mashups,
567980	572780	basically extremely low-rent versions of what we'd see later with Rise of the Guardians.
572780	575980	Very nice. Keep up good work.
575980	580780	Russian Alec Baldwin Santa must have spent some time as a roadie going on those tattoos.
580780	583180	In this movie, Santa is basically a de facto leader
583180	586580	of what appears to be a superhero group of childhood characters.
586580	589980	Because now you are Guardian!
589980	591980	Santa is the muscle and the expositor.
591980	594380	The real protagonist here is sexy Jack Frost.
594380	596780	I've heard a lot about you. And your teeth!
596780	600580	Also, why is the Tooth Fairy a hummingbird? Hummingbirds don't have teeth.
600580	604180	Trick or treat!
604180	605980	As with Santa Claus Conquers the Martians,
605980	609180	we see Santa getting kidnapped again in The Nightmare Before Christmas.
609180	611980	Santa Claus, or as he is known here, Sandy Claus,
611980	615180	gets kidnapped by a well-meaning idiot who uses his position of authority
615180	619580	to impose his midlife crisis, willing or no, onto the denizens of both his polity
619580	621780	and of a sovereign foreign nation.
621780	624780	Surprised, aren't you? I knew you would be.
624780	627580	Jack Skellington, cultural f**king imperialist.
627580	629380	It fails miserably, of course.
629380	632980	My favorite part of the movie is where he tries to rationalize his profound f**k-up
632980	636780	and the ruination of other people's lives is like a personal growth moment.
636780	641380	And at least I left some stories they can tell. I did!
641380	644780	Actually, if you think about it, the real winner is me!
644780	646580	Yeah, at least Santa doesn't put up with his shit.
646580	649380	Bumpy sleigh ride, Jack?
649380	651780	Yeah, you suck, Jack. You're too good for him, Sally.
651780	655180	Go get your associate's degree or something. Move out of this town. You can do better.
655180	656580	Santa believes in you.
656580	660380	She's the only one who makes any sense around this insane asylum.
660380	663980	In Ernest Saves Christmas, Santa is more like a title than a guy
663980	666180	and the torch gets handed down every so often.
666180	671780	I took over the position of Santa Claus in 1889 from a German chap.
671780	675580	And this year he needs a replacement from the greater Orlando metropolitan area.
675580	678180	No, Santa's replacement isn't Ernest, but this guy,
678180	681380	who likes kids and does local public television for the love of the game.
681380	685380	It does the super 80s thing of look at how businessy and phony and corporate we are,
685380	688180	contrasted with the goodness and purity of Santa Claus.
688180	691980	The sanctity of Christmas is being befouled by corporate Hollywood phonies.
691980	695780	In particular, a horror movie called Santa's Sleigh.
695780	702980	Sleigh. Sleigh? It's not Sleigh. Sleigh. S-L-A-Y.
702980	704980	So, funny you should mention that.
705980	706980	Santa?
707980	710980	Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.
710980	715780	A horror comedy from 2005 and also one of the worst things to ever happen in human history.
715780	718180	Bitch! Get out of the way!
718580	720980	Santa absorbs some of the Krampus mythology in this one
721180	725180	and features as a demon punishing bad, fake, phony people
725180	727780	instead of being a patriot saint to children.
727780	731780	He slaughters the morally bankrupt and we're supposed to laugh, I guess,
731780	734580	because strippers dying in mass is hilaire.
739180	742980	He even slaughters a Jew with his own menorah because he's equal opportunity horrible.
742980	748980	What bottom feeder would think stretching this tired, unclever idea of evil Santa into feature length was a...
748980	752780	Oh. Oh. Okay, that explains a lot. Thank you.
752780	755980	Well, uh, something-something transgression.
755980	760980	I now have a new worst thing ever I've had to watch for loose canon.
760980	761980	You're welcome.
769980	771980	I'm in big trouble. Mm-hmm.
771980	775180	We see the Santa as a job motif again in the Santa Claus movies,
775180	779980	which are probably on the higher end of quality as far as 90s Christmas entertainment is concerned,
779980	782180	and also on the higher end of product placement.
782180	784580	Denny's. It's always open.
784580	786580	Once again, Santa's kind of like being the Pope,
786580	790780	but instead of being inherited or voted upon, it's kind of like the Chronicles of Riddick.
790780	794180	In our faith, you keep what you kill.
794180	798180	Well, Tim Allen inherits the position of Santa via involuntary manslaughter
798180	801380	and also fine print because lol 90s.
801580	804580	Slay the werewaves any and all rights to any previous identity,
804580	809180	real or implied, and fully accepts the duties and responsibilities of Santa Claus.
809180	812980	Also something-something broken home and reconnecting with my son because 90s.
812980	814380	This movie had two sequels.
814380	817780	Matrimony? I gotta get married!
817780	821180	One where even more fine print forces Tim Claus into an arranged marriage,
821180	823780	and another where Martin Short is the lovable antagonist.
823780	828580	The former is pretty forgivable, the latter is pretty agonizing, but at least it's short.
828580	831780	Santa is one of three father figures in 2003's Elf,
831780	834980	the other two being Will Ferrell's adoptive elf father, Bob Newhart,
834980	837380	and the other his biological father, James Caan.
837380	840180	Santa is played by Ed Asner, which is pretty perfect,
840180	844980	but my big takeaway from Santa in this movie is which of the shit million raised pizza in New York City
844980	846380	is in fact the original.
846380	849580	There are like 30 raised pizzas.
849580	853180	They all claim to be the original, but the real one's on 11th.
853180	857780	I actually cross-referenced this a long time ago and...
857780	862580	I can't tell the difference between the original raised and the other ones, sorry.
862580	864780	New York pizza's actually really overrated.
864780	868980	In Fred Claus, instead of the Santa character being the transgressive element,
868980	873580	it comes in the form of his underachieving brother, Fred, played by Vince Vaughn.
873580	878580	Santa, played by Paul Giamatti, is genuinely kind and Fred is overcompensating and resentful.
878580	882980	And I have to say, I am honestly kind of shocked at how well Paul Giamatti as Santa works.
882980	886980	Really nice, if for once, things were nice and calm.
886980	888180	Did not see that one coming.
888180	890580	Well, Fred resents the shit out of his younger brother, Nicholas,
890580	892580	who eventually grew up to become Santa.
892580	896380	Now, it's a little-known rule of sainthood, but when you become a saint,
896380	899780	you freeze in time, eternally ageless.
899780	904380	The rule applies to the family of the saint and spouses as well.
904380	907980	Huh. Well, that is an interesting way to hand-wave that away.
907980	911180	Well, in an effort to reconnect, Fred brings the party to the North Pole.
911180	914180	Son, baby, that's my philosophy.
914180	916180	You sound angry.
916180	918980	Hot music. Oh, Fred, you so crazy.
921580	925580	In Robert Zemeckis' weird, uncanny-valley-ish CGI monstrosity
925580	928380	based on the classic picture book of the same name,
928380	932180	the Polar Express is all about the magic of belief and the innocence of childhood.
932180	933980	Oh, God, oh, God, no, why?
936980	940780	So, the whole thing is about a magical trip to the North Pole on a magical train.
940780	944380	So, we don't see Santa, voiced by Tom Hanks, until the very end when they get there.
944380	948980	Found this on the seat of my sleigh. Better fix that hole in your pocket.
948980	953380	Tom Hanks' Santa Claus kind of sounds like Eddie Murphy doing an impression of a white guy.
953380	955380	What a silly negro.
956780	960980	Being able to hear this bell is like a metaphor for the innocence of childhood
960980	963580	and, by extension, belief in Santa himself.
963580	966980	Like the original book, it has this sort of bittersweet ending
966980	969780	where the guy grows up and his friends can't hear the bell anymore,
969780	974380	and it's kind of a bit of a bummer, but he can still hear it because he is a true believer,
974380	978580	which lends a sort of religiosity to it that you don't see in most Santa-related things.
978580	986780	Though I've grown old, the bell still rings for me, as it does for all who truly believe.
986780	990380	Believe in the Lord, Santa, and you will be saved.
990380	994980	Whether or not this sort of thing appeals to you is probably rooted in how much reverence you have
994980	1002780	for the idea of the innocence of childhood, which, for me, is not at all terribly.
1002780	1005380	But that is a big thing in American culture especially,
1005380	1008980	the sanctity of the innocence of childhood and how sad it is when we all have to lose it,
1008980	1012380	and that innocence of childhood is better than the cynicism of adulthood,
1012380	1015380	which is why so many of these have to do with shedding adulty trappings
1015380	1018580	and returning to the childy goodness of nature and purity.
1018580	1023980	But the best way to enjoy Santa Claus is to probably take a page from the way children do,
1023980	1026980	just don't think about it too much.
