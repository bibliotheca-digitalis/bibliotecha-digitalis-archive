00:00.000 --> 00:04.840
Obligatory Christmas episode, time to take a look at the nice fat man who breaks into your house once a year.

00:04.840 --> 00:12.740
🎵

00:13.420 --> 00:17.060
So Santa Claus is probably the most obvious candidate for a loose cannon...

00:17.680 --> 00:22.580
...ever, but before we get into the shit million versions of Santa Claus out there,

00:22.580 --> 00:26.080
or at least a small sampling of them, let's go through some history.

00:27.080 --> 00:32.580
Santa and his periphery spring from a marriage of Christian and pagan traditions from throughout Northern Europe,

00:32.580 --> 00:36.380
coming together in the United States and forming a sort of folklore melange

00:36.380 --> 00:40.380
who's a lot more nice, non-threatening, and marketable than his European forebears.

00:40.380 --> 00:44.880
Saint Nicholas hails from the Netherlands, and his legend descends from the historical Saint Nicholas,

00:44.880 --> 00:50.580
eventually morphing into the stern but just horse-riding fellow who gives presents to children in early December every year

00:50.580 --> 00:55.880
and who maintains in his, um, employ six to eight black men.

00:55.880 --> 01:02.680
The Germans had a gift-bringer character promulgated by Martin Luther after the Reformation called Christ Child, or Christkindl.

01:02.680 --> 01:05.980
This was originally intended by Luther to be the literal Christ Child,

01:05.980 --> 01:09.780
but eventually it turned into more of like a generic angel child figure.

01:09.780 --> 01:12.880
Once in the Americas, this was anglicized to Kris Kringle.

01:12.880 --> 01:15.580
Santa also descends from the English figure of Father Christmas,

01:15.580 --> 01:19.780
who has descended more from pagan traditions than Christian ones and then eventually merged with them.

01:19.780 --> 01:23.380
He makes an uncredited cameo in a Christmas carol as the ghost of Christmas present

01:23.480 --> 01:27.780
and carries a more Bacchanalian sort of jollity compared to the more austere Saint Nicholas.

01:27.780 --> 01:30.080
In Dutch, Saint Nicholas is called Sinterklaas,

01:30.080 --> 01:33.780
and since New York was a Dutch colony that eventually got colonized by the English,

01:33.780 --> 01:38.280
Sinterklaas was anglicized to Santa Claus, forming a new character altogether,

01:38.280 --> 01:42.080
one who also goes by Saint Nick, Father Christmas, and Kris Kringle.

01:42.080 --> 01:45.680
The modern image of Santa really solidified in the Americas in the 1800s

01:45.680 --> 01:48.480
with the publishing of the poem The Night Before Christmas,

01:48.480 --> 01:51.180
which also integrated the whole chimney and reindeer thing.

01:51.180 --> 01:54.880
By the early 20th century, the idea of Santa that we have today was pretty much set.

01:54.880 --> 01:59.380
In fact, one of the first narrative films ever, released in 1898 and called Santa Claus,

01:59.380 --> 02:01.880
also features some of the first-ever visual effects.

02:01.880 --> 02:07.180
But also codified in by the turn of the century was his connection to the idea of childhood, innocence, and purity.

02:07.180 --> 02:09.380
While no longer explicitly a religious figure,

02:09.380 --> 02:13.280
he still maintained a sort of sanctity to him, and does to this day.

02:13.280 --> 02:17.880
In households that celebrate Christmas and still maintain the Santa tradition with the children,

02:17.880 --> 02:21.580
which in the United States counts for most of them,

02:21.580 --> 02:25.380
realizing that Santa isn't real is almost kind of a rite of passage.

02:25.380 --> 02:28.980
So when it comes to pop-cultural depictions of Santa Claus in film and television,

02:28.980 --> 02:31.180
especially of the more recent varietal,

02:31.180 --> 02:34.380
the operative word for most depictions of Santa is transgression.

02:38.580 --> 02:43.680
By the time you're old enough to have a grasp on concepts like narrative and character,

02:43.680 --> 02:47.180
you've probably also figured out that Santa is not real.

02:47.280 --> 02:51.080
And for those of you who haven't, sorry, spoilers.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.380
You see the same thing with characters like Mickey Mouse.

02:53.380 --> 02:57.180
These things that were pure and simple in childhood no longer apply to adulthood.

02:57.180 --> 03:02.780
So there's this weird thrill with making Santa flawed, or surrounding Santa by flawed things.

03:02.780 --> 03:06.980
This is why the concept of transgression as it applies to Santa is so appealing in modern media.

03:06.980 --> 03:10.680
And notable non-Santas, like Billy Bob Thornton's Bad Santa,

03:10.680 --> 03:12.680
are popular enough to at least warrant a sequel.

03:12.680 --> 03:16.980
Because it's literally challenging the innocence of childhood, and that never gets old.

03:17.580 --> 03:21.780
Transgressive elements against Santa Claus are a popular element in television comedy in particular.

03:21.780 --> 03:23.580
I never thought it would end this way.

03:23.580 --> 03:25.480
Gunned down by Santa Claus.

03:25.480 --> 03:30.080
In Futurama, Santa is a murderous robot who comes to terrorize humanity every Christmas Eve,

03:30.080 --> 03:33.980
owing to a glitch that makes his criteria for who is naughty way too high.

03:33.980 --> 03:36.080
You've been very naughty, Brian Lela.

03:36.080 --> 03:37.580
I checked my list.

03:37.580 --> 03:38.780
Well, check it twice.

03:38.780 --> 03:41.380
I perform over 50 mega-checks per second.

03:41.380 --> 03:42.880
And yes, that is John Goodman.

03:42.880 --> 03:48.480
An episode of The Simpsons had Grandpa Simpson being abandoned on an island with Mr. Burns during World War II by Santa.

03:48.480 --> 03:52.280
Grandpa vows revenge for this, but turns out that Santa's only human.

03:52.280 --> 03:54.880
Why didn't you ever come back to pick me up?

03:54.880 --> 03:59.480
I kept putting it off, and then I was just too embarrassed.

03:59.480 --> 04:02.380
American Dad incorporates a revenge element.

04:02.380 --> 04:05.080
There's an episode where Stan and Steve accidentally kill Santa Claus,

04:05.080 --> 04:10.180
only to have him resurrected and have his entire army out for revenge against the entire Smith family.

04:10.180 --> 04:13.580
Meanwhile, in Family Guy, Santa is more of an overburdened union leader

04:13.580 --> 04:17.480
who is ready to throw in the towel on this whole hyper-consumerist Christmas thing.

04:17.480 --> 04:22.780
But now instead, all we're feeling is dread, because Christmas time is killing us!

04:22.780 --> 04:25.680
Now, of course, not all modern Santas take the transgressive approach

04:25.680 --> 04:28.480
that challenges the innocence and purity of a character like Santa.

04:28.480 --> 04:32.980
Some are pretty straightforward, but the concept of transgression as it applies to Santa is a popular one,

04:32.980 --> 04:37.380
especially as it tends to end up back in pretty conventional place of maintaining the status quo.

04:37.380 --> 04:39.780
Guy learns the value of family and Christmas,

04:39.780 --> 04:42.280
cynical child learns to believe in Santa,

04:42.280 --> 04:45.480
kidnapped Santa gets un-kidnapped, and so on.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.780
Even the Futurama episode does this.

04:47.780 --> 04:51.280
Although, granted, the status quo that they return to is the horrible dystopian one.

04:51.280 --> 04:55.880
Don't you see? Fear has brought us together! That's the magic of X-mas!

04:55.880 --> 04:59.180
The most straightforward adaptations in regular circulation in the United States

04:59.180 --> 05:02.280
are the Rankin and Bass stop-motion classics from the 60s and 70s,

05:02.280 --> 05:04.580
which still air on network television every year,

05:04.580 --> 05:08.780
and I think once a year is just long enough for people to forget how boring these are.

05:09.780 --> 05:11.580
I'm sorry, they are!

05:11.580 --> 05:17.280
Now, there were a ton of these, varying in quality, but ultimately pretty samey in terms of portrayal,

05:17.280 --> 05:18.880
so I'm not gonna go through all of them.

05:18.880 --> 05:22.480
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is easily the best and most memorable of this group,

05:22.480 --> 05:25.980
plus it has far and away the best music, as well as some of the most iconic characters.

05:25.980 --> 05:29.480
This is the one that gave us Yukon, Cornelius, and the Bumble,

05:29.480 --> 05:31.780
which I'm sure you've seen in your local Spencer's Gifts.

05:31.780 --> 05:35.980
Being about Rudolph, Santa is barely in this one, aside from doing what the song said he would.

05:36.480 --> 05:42.880
Rudolph, with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

05:42.880 --> 05:45.880
Miracle on 34th Street is comfortably regarded as a classic.

05:45.880 --> 05:46.880
I'm Santa Claus.

05:48.380 --> 05:51.280
Oh, you don't believe that, do you?

05:51.280 --> 05:51.880
Mm-mm.

05:51.880 --> 05:54.980
A guy claiming to be Santa gets hired at the Macy's in Herald Square

05:54.980 --> 05:57.080
because he's just so good at being Santa.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.480
And he's kind of method, and everyone's like,

05:59.580 --> 06:01.380
Well, it's fine. He's harmless.

06:01.380 --> 06:02.480
Until this happens.

06:03.680 --> 06:04.180
Ow!

06:04.880 --> 06:05.780
Damn.

06:05.780 --> 06:07.680
Father-aggravated assault-ness.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.180
Then it turns into a courtroom drama,

06:09.180 --> 06:12.780
wherein ultimately the defense has to prove that the guy who lives in a nursing home

06:12.780 --> 06:16.580
and calls himself Kris Kringle is, in fact, the real Santa Claus.

06:16.580 --> 06:18.480
Also, Maureen O'Hara needs to learn to love again,

06:18.480 --> 06:22.880
and Cynical Child needs to de-cynical and learn the magic of childhood.

06:22.880 --> 06:25.680
The way they eventually get around this is that the U.S. Postal Service

06:25.680 --> 06:27.980
delivers letters addressed to Santa to this guy,

06:27.980 --> 06:31.480
meaning that the U.S. Postal Service, and by extension, the U.S. federal government,

06:31.480 --> 06:33.580
recognize him as Santa, so there you go.

06:33.580 --> 06:34.980
Case literally dismissed.

06:34.980 --> 06:39.180
Since the United States government declares this man to be Santa Claus,

06:39.180 --> 06:41.180
this court will not dispute it.

06:41.180 --> 06:41.980
Case dismissed.

06:41.980 --> 06:44.680
Miracle on 34th Street was remade four times

06:44.680 --> 06:47.180
and was also adapted into a Broadway musical.

06:47.180 --> 06:49.380
Thomas Mitchell played him in 1955,

06:49.380 --> 06:51.180
Ed Wynn played him in 1959,

06:51.180 --> 06:53.480
Sebastian Cabot played him in 1973,

06:53.480 --> 06:56.180
and Sir Richard Attenborough played him in 1994.

06:57.180 --> 06:59.680
The 1994 remake, starring Richard Attenborough,

06:59.680 --> 07:02.480
takes a more Russell's teapot existential approach,

07:02.480 --> 07:06.880
with the judge ultimately ruling that he can't prove Chris isn't Santa

07:06.880 --> 07:08.880
because he can't prove a negative,

07:08.880 --> 07:11.780
and the U.S. government currency supports the existence of God,

07:11.780 --> 07:13.280
which also cannot be proven,

07:13.280 --> 07:15.780
and it seems like a touch of the old false equivalency.

07:15.780 --> 07:19.080
If the government of the United States can issue its currency

07:19.080 --> 07:21.680
bearing a declaration of trust in God

07:21.680 --> 07:25.780
without demanding physical evidence of the existence

07:25.780 --> 07:29.080
or the non-existence of a greater being...

07:29.080 --> 07:33.280
I mean, children don't pledge allegiance to one nation under Santa,

07:33.280 --> 07:34.280
but okay.

07:34.280 --> 07:37.280
Here the incident that gets Chris in trouble is a lot more pronounced

07:37.280 --> 07:39.480
and arguably justified.

07:39.480 --> 07:42.780
Rather than whapping a guy on the head during an argument about psychiatry,

07:42.780 --> 07:46.880
this guy who is a plant kind of insinuates that Chris might be a pedophile?

07:47.680 --> 07:49.880
You got a thing for the little ones, huh?

07:49.880 --> 07:50.480
Huh?

07:50.480 --> 07:51.580
Huh?

07:52.580 --> 07:54.580
Cause he ain't much good for nothing else, huh?

07:54.580 --> 07:56.980
Dang, I might give him an umbrella to the head, too.

07:56.980 --> 08:00.380
Anyway, the 47 version is a classic and better by most metrics

08:00.380 --> 08:02.780
and actually uses the word Macy's.

08:02.780 --> 08:04.780
Macy's, sending people to tell the story.

08:04.780 --> 08:08.180
But for my money, I prefer Attenborough's warmth and vulnerability.

08:08.180 --> 08:10.380
Plus the fact that he doesn't pull shit like this.

08:10.380 --> 08:11.380
Ow!

08:13.380 --> 08:16.180
Oh, my outfit!

08:16.180 --> 08:18.180
What is it, Mr. Bruce?

08:18.380 --> 08:22.380
The 1960s saw a surprising number of terrible movies starring Santa.

08:22.380 --> 08:25.980
The transgressive element here isn't so much Santa adopting new character traits

08:25.980 --> 08:29.180
—he's still a pretty nice guy with a pretty consistent personality—

08:29.180 --> 08:32.980
but rather, taking on decidedly non-Santa-like roles.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.980
Oh! Oh, Mr. Santa!

08:35.980 --> 08:42.180
I was reuniting everybody to form an army and fight the ogre!

08:42.180 --> 08:43.980
So many questions.

08:43.980 --> 08:46.380
The most well-known of these terrible 60s Santa movies

08:46.380 --> 08:48.780
is probably Santa Claus Conquers the Martian,

08:48.780 --> 08:52.180
by virtue of having been popularized by a Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode

08:52.180 --> 08:53.580
some 30 years later.

08:53.580 --> 08:56.380
Nixon and Vixen and Nixon!

08:56.380 --> 08:58.380
Uh, yes, and what's in the pipes, huh?

08:58.380 --> 09:02.180
Santa doesn't so much conquer the Martians as get kidnapped by them

09:02.180 --> 09:06.780
and eventually negotiate for his and his fellow kidnappees' release.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.780
He always has a pretty good sense of humor about the whole thing, though.

09:09.780 --> 09:15.180
I wish you and yours the very best of everything.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.980
On Mars, children aren't allowed to be children, see?

09:17.980 --> 09:19.980
And this also has the whole

09:19.980 --> 09:23.780
bring-back-the-innocence-of-childhood-and-let-children-be-children thing.

09:23.780 --> 09:27.980
Basically, there was this entire subgenre of Santa movies that were genre mashups,

09:27.980 --> 09:32.780
basically extremely low-rent versions of what we'd see later with Rise of the Guardians.

09:32.780 --> 09:35.980
Very nice. Keep up good work.

09:35.980 --> 09:40.780
Russian Alec Baldwin Santa must have spent some time as a roadie going on those tattoos.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.180
In this movie, Santa is basically a de facto leader

09:43.180 --> 09:46.580
of what appears to be a superhero group of childhood characters.

09:46.580 --> 09:49.980
Because now you are Guardian!

09:49.980 --> 09:51.980
Santa is the muscle and the expositor.

09:51.980 --> 09:54.380
The real protagonist here is sexy Jack Frost.

09:54.380 --> 09:56.780
I've heard a lot about you. And your teeth!

09:56.780 --> 10:00.580
Also, why is the Tooth Fairy a hummingbird? Hummingbirds don't have teeth.

10:00.580 --> 10:04.180
Trick or treat!

10:04.180 --> 10:05.980
As with Santa Claus Conquers the Martians,

10:05.980 --> 10:09.180
we see Santa getting kidnapped again in The Nightmare Before Christmas.

10:09.180 --> 10:11.980
Santa Claus, or as he is known here, Sandy Claus,

10:11.980 --> 10:15.180
gets kidnapped by a well-meaning idiot who uses his position of authority

10:15.180 --> 10:19.580
to impose his midlife crisis, willing or no, onto the denizens of both his polity

10:19.580 --> 10:21.780
and of a sovereign foreign nation.

10:21.780 --> 10:24.780
Surprised, aren't you? I knew you would be.

10:24.780 --> 10:27.580
Jack Skellington, cultural f**king imperialist.

10:27.580 --> 10:29.380
It fails miserably, of course.

10:29.380 --> 10:32.980
My favorite part of the movie is where he tries to rationalize his profound f**k-up

10:32.980 --> 10:36.780
and the ruination of other people's lives is like a personal growth moment.

10:36.780 --> 10:41.380
And at least I left some stories they can tell. I did!

10:41.380 --> 10:44.780
Actually, if you think about it, the real winner is me!

10:44.780 --> 10:46.580
Yeah, at least Santa doesn't put up with his shit.

10:46.580 --> 10:49.380
Bumpy sleigh ride, Jack?

10:49.380 --> 10:51.780
Yeah, you suck, Jack. You're too good for him, Sally.

10:51.780 --> 10:55.180
Go get your associate's degree or something. Move out of this town. You can do better.

10:55.180 --> 10:56.580
Santa believes in you.

10:56.580 --> 11:00.380
She's the only one who makes any sense around this insane asylum.

11:00.380 --> 11:03.980
In Ernest Saves Christmas, Santa is more like a title than a guy

11:03.980 --> 11:06.180
and the torch gets handed down every so often.

11:06.180 --> 11:11.780
I took over the position of Santa Claus in 1889 from a German chap.

11:11.780 --> 11:15.580
And this year he needs a replacement from the greater Orlando metropolitan area.

11:15.580 --> 11:18.180
No, Santa's replacement isn't Ernest, but this guy,

11:18.180 --> 11:21.380
who likes kids and does local public television for the love of the game.

11:21.380 --> 11:25.380
It does the super 80s thing of look at how businessy and phony and corporate we are,

11:25.380 --> 11:28.180
contrasted with the goodness and purity of Santa Claus.

11:28.180 --> 11:31.980
The sanctity of Christmas is being befouled by corporate Hollywood phonies.

11:31.980 --> 11:35.780
In particular, a horror movie called Santa's Sleigh.

11:35.780 --> 11:42.980
Sleigh. Sleigh? It's not Sleigh. Sleigh. S-L-A-Y.

11:42.980 --> 11:44.980
So, funny you should mention that.

11:45.980 --> 11:46.980
Santa?

11:47.980 --> 11:50.980
Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.

11:50.980 --> 11:55.780
A horror comedy from 2005 and also one of the worst things to ever happen in human history.

11:55.780 --> 11:58.180
Bitch! Get out of the way!

11:58.580 --> 12:00.980
Santa absorbs some of the Krampus mythology in this one

12:01.180 --> 12:05.180
and features as a demon punishing bad, fake, phony people

12:05.180 --> 12:07.780
instead of being a patriot saint to children.

12:07.780 --> 12:11.780
He slaughters the morally bankrupt and we're supposed to laugh, I guess,

12:11.780 --> 12:14.580
because strippers dying in mass is hilaire.

12:19.180 --> 12:22.980
He even slaughters a Jew with his own menorah because he's equal opportunity horrible.

12:22.980 --> 12:28.980
What bottom feeder would think stretching this tired, unclever idea of evil Santa into feature length was a...

12:28.980 --> 12:32.780
Oh. Oh. Okay, that explains a lot. Thank you.

12:32.780 --> 12:35.980
Well, uh, something-something transgression.

12:35.980 --> 12:40.980
I now have a new worst thing ever I've had to watch for loose canon.

12:40.980 --> 12:41.980
You're welcome.

12:49.980 --> 12:51.980
I'm in big trouble. Mm-hmm.

12:51.980 --> 12:55.180
We see the Santa as a job motif again in the Santa Claus movies,

12:55.180 --> 12:59.980
which are probably on the higher end of quality as far as 90s Christmas entertainment is concerned,

12:59.980 --> 13:02.180
and also on the higher end of product placement.

13:02.180 --> 13:04.580
Denny's. It's always open.

13:04.580 --> 13:06.580
Once again, Santa's kind of like being the Pope,

13:06.580 --> 13:10.780
but instead of being inherited or voted upon, it's kind of like the Chronicles of Riddick.

13:10.780 --> 13:14.180
In our faith, you keep what you kill.

13:14.180 --> 13:18.180
Well, Tim Allen inherits the position of Santa via involuntary manslaughter

13:18.180 --> 13:21.380
and also fine print because lol 90s.

13:21.580 --> 13:24.580
Slay the werewaves any and all rights to any previous identity,

13:24.580 --> 13:29.180
real or implied, and fully accepts the duties and responsibilities of Santa Claus.

13:29.180 --> 13:32.980
Also something-something broken home and reconnecting with my son because 90s.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.380
This movie had two sequels.

13:34.380 --> 13:37.780
Matrimony? I gotta get married!

13:37.780 --> 13:41.180
One where even more fine print forces Tim Claus into an arranged marriage,

13:41.180 --> 13:43.780
and another where Martin Short is the lovable antagonist.

13:43.780 --> 13:48.580
The former is pretty forgivable, the latter is pretty agonizing, but at least it's short.

13:48.580 --> 13:51.780
Santa is one of three father figures in 2003's Elf,

13:51.780 --> 13:54.980
the other two being Will Ferrell's adoptive elf father, Bob Newhart,

13:54.980 --> 13:57.380
and the other his biological father, James Caan.

13:57.380 --> 14:00.180
Santa is played by Ed Asner, which is pretty perfect,

14:00.180 --> 14:04.980
but my big takeaway from Santa in this movie is which of the shit million raised pizza in New York City

14:04.980 --> 14:06.380
is in fact the original.

14:06.380 --> 14:09.580
There are like 30 raised pizzas.

14:09.580 --> 14:13.180
They all claim to be the original, but the real one's on 11th.

14:13.180 --> 14:17.780
I actually cross-referenced this a long time ago and...

14:17.780 --> 14:22.580
I can't tell the difference between the original raised and the other ones, sorry.

14:22.580 --> 14:24.780
New York pizza's actually really overrated.

14:24.780 --> 14:28.980
In Fred Claus, instead of the Santa character being the transgressive element,

14:28.980 --> 14:33.580
it comes in the form of his underachieving brother, Fred, played by Vince Vaughn.

14:33.580 --> 14:38.580
Santa, played by Paul Giamatti, is genuinely kind and Fred is overcompensating and resentful.

14:38.580 --> 14:42.980
And I have to say, I am honestly kind of shocked at how well Paul Giamatti as Santa works.

14:42.980 --> 14:46.980
Really nice, if for once, things were nice and calm.

14:46.980 --> 14:48.180
Did not see that one coming.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.580
Well, Fred resents the shit out of his younger brother, Nicholas,

14:50.580 --> 14:52.580
who eventually grew up to become Santa.

14:52.580 --> 14:56.380
Now, it's a little-known rule of sainthood, but when you become a saint,

14:56.380 --> 14:59.780
you freeze in time, eternally ageless.

14:59.780 --> 15:04.380
The rule applies to the family of the saint and spouses as well.

15:04.380 --> 15:07.980
Huh. Well, that is an interesting way to hand-wave that away.

15:07.980 --> 15:11.180
Well, in an effort to reconnect, Fred brings the party to the North Pole.

15:11.180 --> 15:14.180
Son, baby, that's my philosophy.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.180
You sound angry.

15:16.180 --> 15:18.980
Hot music. Oh, Fred, you so crazy.

15:21.580 --> 15:25.580
In Robert Zemeckis' weird, uncanny-valley-ish CGI monstrosity

15:25.580 --> 15:28.380
based on the classic picture book of the same name,

15:28.380 --> 15:32.180
the Polar Express is all about the magic of belief and the innocence of childhood.

15:32.180 --> 15:33.980
Oh, God, oh, God, no, why?

15:36.980 --> 15:40.780
So, the whole thing is about a magical trip to the North Pole on a magical train.

15:40.780 --> 15:44.380
So, we don't see Santa, voiced by Tom Hanks, until the very end when they get there.

15:44.380 --> 15:48.980
Found this on the seat of my sleigh. Better fix that hole in your pocket.

15:48.980 --> 15:53.380
Tom Hanks' Santa Claus kind of sounds like Eddie Murphy doing an impression of a white guy.

15:53.380 --> 15:55.380
What a silly negro.

15:56.780 --> 16:00.980
Being able to hear this bell is like a metaphor for the innocence of childhood

16:00.980 --> 16:03.580
and, by extension, belief in Santa himself.

16:03.580 --> 16:06.980
Like the original book, it has this sort of bittersweet ending

16:06.980 --> 16:09.780
where the guy grows up and his friends can't hear the bell anymore,

16:09.780 --> 16:14.380
and it's kind of a bit of a bummer, but he can still hear it because he is a true believer,

16:14.380 --> 16:18.580
which lends a sort of religiosity to it that you don't see in most Santa-related things.

16:18.580 --> 16:26.780
Though I've grown old, the bell still rings for me, as it does for all who truly believe.

16:26.780 --> 16:30.380
Believe in the Lord, Santa, and you will be saved.

16:30.380 --> 16:34.980
Whether or not this sort of thing appeals to you is probably rooted in how much reverence you have

16:34.980 --> 16:42.780
for the idea of the innocence of childhood, which, for me, is not at all terribly.

16:42.780 --> 16:45.380
But that is a big thing in American culture especially,

16:45.380 --> 16:48.980
the sanctity of the innocence of childhood and how sad it is when we all have to lose it,

16:48.980 --> 16:52.380
and that innocence of childhood is better than the cynicism of adulthood,

16:52.380 --> 16:55.380
which is why so many of these have to do with shedding adulty trappings

16:55.380 --> 16:58.580
and returning to the childy goodness of nature and purity.

16:58.580 --> 17:03.980
But the best way to enjoy Santa Claus is to probably take a page from the way children do,

17:03.980 --> 17:06.980
just don't think about it too much.
