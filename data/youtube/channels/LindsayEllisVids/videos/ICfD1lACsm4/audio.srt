1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
Obligatory Christmas episode, time to take a look at the nice fat man who breaks into your house once a year.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:12,740
🎵

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,060
So Santa Claus is probably the most obvious candidate for a loose cannon...

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,580
...ever, but before we get into the shit million versions of Santa Claus out there,

5
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,080
or at least a small sampling of them, let's go through some history.

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,580
Santa and his periphery spring from a marriage of Christian and pagan traditions from throughout Northern Europe,

7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,380
coming together in the United States and forming a sort of folklore melange

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,380
who's a lot more nice, non-threatening, and marketable than his European forebears.

9
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,880
Saint Nicholas hails from the Netherlands, and his legend descends from the historical Saint Nicholas,

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,580
eventually morphing into the stern but just horse-riding fellow who gives presents to children in early December every year

11
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,880
and who maintains in his, um, employ six to eight black men.

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:02,680
The Germans had a gift-bringer character promulgated by Martin Luther after the Reformation called Christ Child, or Christkindl.

13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,980
This was originally intended by Luther to be the literal Christ Child,

14
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,780
but eventually it turned into more of like a generic angel child figure.

15
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,880
Once in the Americas, this was anglicized to Kris Kringle.

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,580
Santa also descends from the English figure of Father Christmas,

17
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,780
who has descended more from pagan traditions than Christian ones and then eventually merged with them.

18
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,380
He makes an uncredited cameo in a Christmas carol as the ghost of Christmas present

19
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,780
and carries a more Bacchanalian sort of jollity compared to the more austere Saint Nicholas.

20
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,080
In Dutch, Saint Nicholas is called Sinterklaas,

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,780
and since New York was a Dutch colony that eventually got colonized by the English,

22
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,280
Sinterklaas was anglicized to Santa Claus, forming a new character altogether,

23
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,080
one who also goes by Saint Nick, Father Christmas, and Kris Kringle.

24
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,680
The modern image of Santa really solidified in the Americas in the 1800s

25
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,480
with the publishing of the poem The Night Before Christmas,

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,180
which also integrated the whole chimney and reindeer thing.

27
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,880
By the early 20th century, the idea of Santa that we have today was pretty much set.

28
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,380
In fact, one of the first narrative films ever, released in 1898 and called Santa Claus,

29
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,880
also features some of the first-ever visual effects.

30
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,180
But also codified in by the turn of the century was his connection to the idea of childhood, innocence, and purity.

31
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,380
While no longer explicitly a religious figure,

32
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,280
he still maintained a sort of sanctity to him, and does to this day.

33
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,880
In households that celebrate Christmas and still maintain the Santa tradition with the children,

34
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,580
which in the United States counts for most of them,

35
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,380
realizing that Santa isn't real is almost kind of a rite of passage.

36
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,980
So when it comes to pop-cultural depictions of Santa Claus in film and television,

37
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,180
especially of the more recent varietal,

38
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,380
the operative word for most depictions of Santa is transgression.

39
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,680
By the time you're old enough to have a grasp on concepts like narrative and character,

40
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,180
you've probably also figured out that Santa is not real.

41
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,080
And for those of you who haven't, sorry, spoilers.

42
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,380
You see the same thing with characters like Mickey Mouse.

43
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,180
These things that were pure and simple in childhood no longer apply to adulthood.

44
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,780
So there's this weird thrill with making Santa flawed, or surrounding Santa by flawed things.

45
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,980
This is why the concept of transgression as it applies to Santa is so appealing in modern media.

46
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,680
And notable non-Santas, like Billy Bob Thornton's Bad Santa,

47
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,680
are popular enough to at least warrant a sequel.

48
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,980
Because it's literally challenging the innocence of childhood, and that never gets old.

49
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,780
Transgressive elements against Santa Claus are a popular element in television comedy in particular.

50
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,580
I never thought it would end this way.

51
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,480
Gunned down by Santa Claus.

52
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,080
In Futurama, Santa is a murderous robot who comes to terrorize humanity every Christmas Eve,

53
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,980
owing to a glitch that makes his criteria for who is naughty way too high.

54
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,080
You've been very naughty, Brian Lela.

55
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,580
I checked my list.

56
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,780
Well, check it twice.

57
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,380
I perform over 50 mega-checks per second.

58
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,880
And yes, that is John Goodman.

59
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,480
An episode of The Simpsons had Grandpa Simpson being abandoned on an island with Mr. Burns during World War II by Santa.

60
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,280
Grandpa vows revenge for this, but turns out that Santa's only human.

61
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,880
Why didn't you ever come back to pick me up?

62
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,480
I kept putting it off, and then I was just too embarrassed.

63
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,380
American Dad incorporates a revenge element.

64
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,080
There's an episode where Stan and Steve accidentally kill Santa Claus,

65
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,180
only to have him resurrected and have his entire army out for revenge against the entire Smith family.

66
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,580
Meanwhile, in Family Guy, Santa is more of an overburdened union leader

67
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,480
who is ready to throw in the towel on this whole hyper-consumerist Christmas thing.

68
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,780
But now instead, all we're feeling is dread, because Christmas time is killing us!

69
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,680
Now, of course, not all modern Santas take the transgressive approach

70
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,480
that challenges the innocence and purity of a character like Santa.

71
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,980
Some are pretty straightforward, but the concept of transgression as it applies to Santa is a popular one,

72
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,380
especially as it tends to end up back in pretty conventional place of maintaining the status quo.

73
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,780
Guy learns the value of family and Christmas,

74
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,280
cynical child learns to believe in Santa,

75
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,480
kidnapped Santa gets un-kidnapped, and so on.

76
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,780
Even the Futurama episode does this.

77
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,280
Although, granted, the status quo that they return to is the horrible dystopian one.

78
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,880
Don't you see? Fear has brought us together! That's the magic of X-mas!

79
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,180
The most straightforward adaptations in regular circulation in the United States

80
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,280
are the Rankin and Bass stop-motion classics from the 60s and 70s,

81
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,580
which still air on network television every year,

82
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,780
and I think once a year is just long enough for people to forget how boring these are.

83
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,580
I'm sorry, they are!

84
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:17,280
Now, there were a ton of these, varying in quality, but ultimately pretty samey in terms of portrayal,

85
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,880
so I'm not gonna go through all of them.

86
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,480
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is easily the best and most memorable of this group,

87
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,980
plus it has far and away the best music, as well as some of the most iconic characters.

88
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,480
This is the one that gave us Yukon, Cornelius, and the Bumble,

89
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,780
which I'm sure you've seen in your local Spencer's Gifts.

90
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,980
Being about Rudolph, Santa is barely in this one, aside from doing what the song said he would.

91
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:42,880
Rudolph, with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

92
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,880
Miracle on 34th Street is comfortably regarded as a classic.

93
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
I'm Santa Claus.

94
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,280
Oh, you don't believe that, do you?

95
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,880
Mm-mm.

96
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,980
A guy claiming to be Santa gets hired at the Macy's in Herald Square

97
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,080
because he's just so good at being Santa.

98
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,480
And he's kind of method, and everyone's like,

99
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,380
Well, it's fine. He's harmless.

100
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,480
Until this happens.

101
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,180
Ow!

102
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,780
Damn.

103
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,680
Father-aggravated assault-ness.

104
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,180
Then it turns into a courtroom drama,

105
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,780
wherein ultimately the defense has to prove that the guy who lives in a nursing home

106
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,580
and calls himself Kris Kringle is, in fact, the real Santa Claus.

107
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,480
Also, Maureen O'Hara needs to learn to love again,

108
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,880
and Cynical Child needs to de-cynical and learn the magic of childhood.

109
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,680
The way they eventually get around this is that the U.S. Postal Service

110
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,980
delivers letters addressed to Santa to this guy,

111
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,480
meaning that the U.S. Postal Service, and by extension, the U.S. federal government,

112
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,580
recognize him as Santa, so there you go.

113
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,980
Case literally dismissed.

114
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:39,180
Since the United States government declares this man to be Santa Claus,

115
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,180
this court will not dispute it.

116
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:41,980
Case dismissed.

117
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,680
Miracle on 34th Street was remade four times

118
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,180
and was also adapted into a Broadway musical.

119
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,380
Thomas Mitchell played him in 1955,

120
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,180
Ed Wynn played him in 1959,

121
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,480
Sebastian Cabot played him in 1973,

122
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,180
and Sir Richard Attenborough played him in 1994.

123
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,680
The 1994 remake, starring Richard Attenborough,

124
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,480
takes a more Russell's teapot existential approach,

125
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,880
with the judge ultimately ruling that he can't prove Chris isn't Santa

126
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,880
because he can't prove a negative,

127
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,780
and the U.S. government currency supports the existence of God,

128
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,280
which also cannot be proven,

129
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,780
and it seems like a touch of the old false equivalency.

130
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,080
If the government of the United States can issue its currency

131
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,680
bearing a declaration of trust in God

132
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,780
without demanding physical evidence of the existence

133
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,080
or the non-existence of a greater being...

134
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,280
I mean, children don't pledge allegiance to one nation under Santa,

135
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,280
but okay.

136
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,280
Here the incident that gets Chris in trouble is a lot more pronounced

137
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,480
and arguably justified.

138
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,780
Rather than whapping a guy on the head during an argument about psychiatry,

139
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,880
this guy who is a plant kind of insinuates that Chris might be a pedophile?

140
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,880
You got a thing for the little ones, huh?

141
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,480
Huh?

142
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,580
Huh?

143
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,580
Cause he ain't much good for nothing else, huh?

144
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,980
Dang, I might give him an umbrella to the head, too.

145
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,380
Anyway, the 47 version is a classic and better by most metrics

146
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,780
and actually uses the word Macy's.

147
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,780
Macy's, sending people to tell the story.

148
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,180
But for my money, I prefer Attenborough's warmth and vulnerability.

149
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,380
Plus the fact that he doesn't pull shit like this.

150
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,380
Ow!

151
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,180
Oh, my outfit!

152
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,180
What is it, Mr. Bruce?

153
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,380
The 1960s saw a surprising number of terrible movies starring Santa.

154
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,980
The transgressive element here isn't so much Santa adopting new character traits

155
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,180
—he's still a pretty nice guy with a pretty consistent personality—

156
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,980
but rather, taking on decidedly non-Santa-like roles.

157
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,980
Oh! Oh, Mr. Santa!

158
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:42,180
I was reuniting everybody to form an army and fight the ogre!

159
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,980
So many questions.

160
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,380
The most well-known of these terrible 60s Santa movies

161
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,780
is probably Santa Claus Conquers the Martian,

162
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,180
by virtue of having been popularized by a Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode

163
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,580
some 30 years later.

164
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,380
Nixon and Vixen and Nixon!

165
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,380
Uh, yes, and what's in the pipes, huh?

166
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,180
Santa doesn't so much conquer the Martians as get kidnapped by them

167
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,780
and eventually negotiate for his and his fellow kidnappees' release.

168
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,780
He always has a pretty good sense of humor about the whole thing, though.

169
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:15,180
I wish you and yours the very best of everything.

170
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,980
On Mars, children aren't allowed to be children, see?

171
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,980
And this also has the whole

172
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,780
bring-back-the-innocence-of-childhood-and-let-children-be-children thing.

173
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,980
Basically, there was this entire subgenre of Santa movies that were genre mashups,

174
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,780
basically extremely low-rent versions of what we'd see later with Rise of the Guardians.

175
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,980
Very nice. Keep up good work.

176
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,780
Russian Alec Baldwin Santa must have spent some time as a roadie going on those tattoos.

177
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,180
In this movie, Santa is basically a de facto leader

178
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,580
of what appears to be a superhero group of childhood characters.

179
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,980
Because now you are Guardian!

180
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,980
Santa is the muscle and the expositor.

181
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,380
The real protagonist here is sexy Jack Frost.

182
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,780
I've heard a lot about you. And your teeth!

183
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,580
Also, why is the Tooth Fairy a hummingbird? Hummingbirds don't have teeth.

184
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,180
Trick or treat!

185
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,980
As with Santa Claus Conquers the Martians,

186
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,180
we see Santa getting kidnapped again in The Nightmare Before Christmas.

187
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,980
Santa Claus, or as he is known here, Sandy Claus,

188
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,180
gets kidnapped by a well-meaning idiot who uses his position of authority

189
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,580
to impose his midlife crisis, willing or no, onto the denizens of both his polity

190
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,780
and of a sovereign foreign nation.

191
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,780
Surprised, aren't you? I knew you would be.

192
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,580
Jack Skellington, cultural f**king imperialist.

193
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,380
It fails miserably, of course.

194
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,980
My favorite part of the movie is where he tries to rationalize his profound f**k-up

195
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,780
and the ruination of other people's lives is like a personal growth moment.

196
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,380
And at least I left some stories they can tell. I did!

197
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,780
Actually, if you think about it, the real winner is me!

198
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,580
Yeah, at least Santa doesn't put up with his shit.

199
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,380
Bumpy sleigh ride, Jack?

200
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,780
Yeah, you suck, Jack. You're too good for him, Sally.

201
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,180
Go get your associate's degree or something. Move out of this town. You can do better.

202
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,580
Santa believes in you.

203
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,380
She's the only one who makes any sense around this insane asylum.

204
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,980
In Ernest Saves Christmas, Santa is more like a title than a guy

205
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,180
and the torch gets handed down every so often.

206
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:11,780
I took over the position of Santa Claus in 1889 from a German chap.

207
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,580
And this year he needs a replacement from the greater Orlando metropolitan area.

208
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,180
No, Santa's replacement isn't Ernest, but this guy,

209
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,380
who likes kids and does local public television for the love of the game.

210
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,380
It does the super 80s thing of look at how businessy and phony and corporate we are,

211
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,180
contrasted with the goodness and purity of Santa Claus.

212
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,980
The sanctity of Christmas is being befouled by corporate Hollywood phonies.

213
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,780
In particular, a horror movie called Santa's Sleigh.

214
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:42,980
Sleigh. Sleigh? It's not Sleigh. Sleigh. S-L-A-Y.

215
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,980
So, funny you should mention that.

216
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,980
Santa?

217
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,980
Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.

218
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,780
A horror comedy from 2005 and also one of the worst things to ever happen in human history.

219
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,180
Bitch! Get out of the way!

220
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,980
Santa absorbs some of the Krampus mythology in this one

221
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,180
and features as a demon punishing bad, fake, phony people

222
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,780
instead of being a patriot saint to children.

223
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,780
He slaughters the morally bankrupt and we're supposed to laugh, I guess,

224
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,580
because strippers dying in mass is hilaire.

225
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,980
He even slaughters a Jew with his own menorah because he's equal opportunity horrible.

226
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:28,980
What bottom feeder would think stretching this tired, unclever idea of evil Santa into feature length was a...

227
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,780
Oh. Oh. Okay, that explains a lot. Thank you.

228
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,980
Well, uh, something-something transgression.

229
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,980
I now have a new worst thing ever I've had to watch for loose canon.

230
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,980
You're welcome.

231
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,980
I'm in big trouble. Mm-hmm.

232
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,180
We see the Santa as a job motif again in the Santa Claus movies,

233
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,980
which are probably on the higher end of quality as far as 90s Christmas entertainment is concerned,

234
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,180
and also on the higher end of product placement.

235
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,580
Denny's. It's always open.

236
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,580
Once again, Santa's kind of like being the Pope,

237
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,780
but instead of being inherited or voted upon, it's kind of like the Chronicles of Riddick.

238
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:14,180
In our faith, you keep what you kill.

239
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,180
Well, Tim Allen inherits the position of Santa via involuntary manslaughter

240
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,380
and also fine print because lol 90s.

241
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,580
Slay the werewaves any and all rights to any previous identity,

242
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:29,180
real or implied, and fully accepts the duties and responsibilities of Santa Claus.

243
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,980
Also something-something broken home and reconnecting with my son because 90s.

244
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,380
This movie had two sequels.

245
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,780
Matrimony? I gotta get married!

246
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,180
One where even more fine print forces Tim Claus into an arranged marriage,

247
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,780
and another where Martin Short is the lovable antagonist.

248
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:48,580
The former is pretty forgivable, the latter is pretty agonizing, but at least it's short.

249
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,780
Santa is one of three father figures in 2003's Elf,

250
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,980
the other two being Will Ferrell's adoptive elf father, Bob Newhart,

251
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,380
and the other his biological father, James Caan.

252
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,180
Santa is played by Ed Asner, which is pretty perfect,

253
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,980
but my big takeaway from Santa in this movie is which of the shit million raised pizza in New York City

254
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,380
is in fact the original.

255
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,580
There are like 30 raised pizzas.

256
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,180
They all claim to be the original, but the real one's on 11th.

257
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,780
I actually cross-referenced this a long time ago and...

258
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:22,580
I can't tell the difference between the original raised and the other ones, sorry.

259
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,780
New York pizza's actually really overrated.

260
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,980
In Fred Claus, instead of the Santa character being the transgressive element,

261
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,580
it comes in the form of his underachieving brother, Fred, played by Vince Vaughn.

262
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:38,580
Santa, played by Paul Giamatti, is genuinely kind and Fred is overcompensating and resentful.

263
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,980
And I have to say, I am honestly kind of shocked at how well Paul Giamatti as Santa works.

264
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,980
Really nice, if for once, things were nice and calm.

265
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,180
Did not see that one coming.

266
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,580
Well, Fred resents the shit out of his younger brother, Nicholas,

267
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,580
who eventually grew up to become Santa.

268
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,380
Now, it's a little-known rule of sainthood, but when you become a saint,

269
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,780
you freeze in time, eternally ageless.

270
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:04,380
The rule applies to the family of the saint and spouses as well.

271
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,980
Huh. Well, that is an interesting way to hand-wave that away.

272
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,180
Well, in an effort to reconnect, Fred brings the party to the North Pole.

273
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,180
Son, baby, that's my philosophy.

274
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,180
You sound angry.

275
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,980
Hot music. Oh, Fred, you so crazy.

276
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,580
In Robert Zemeckis' weird, uncanny-valley-ish CGI monstrosity

277
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,380
based on the classic picture book of the same name,

278
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,180
the Polar Express is all about the magic of belief and the innocence of childhood.

279
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,980
Oh, God, oh, God, no, why?

280
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,780
So, the whole thing is about a magical trip to the North Pole on a magical train.

281
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,380
So, we don't see Santa, voiced by Tom Hanks, until the very end when they get there.

282
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:48,980
Found this on the seat of my sleigh. Better fix that hole in your pocket.

283
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,380
Tom Hanks' Santa Claus kind of sounds like Eddie Murphy doing an impression of a white guy.

284
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,380
What a silly negro.

285
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,980
Being able to hear this bell is like a metaphor for the innocence of childhood

286
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,580
and, by extension, belief in Santa himself.

287
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,980
Like the original book, it has this sort of bittersweet ending

288
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,780
where the guy grows up and his friends can't hear the bell anymore,

289
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:14,380
and it's kind of a bit of a bummer, but he can still hear it because he is a true believer,

290
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,580
which lends a sort of religiosity to it that you don't see in most Santa-related things.

291
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:26,780
Though I've grown old, the bell still rings for me, as it does for all who truly believe.

292
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,380
Believe in the Lord, Santa, and you will be saved.

293
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,980
Whether or not this sort of thing appeals to you is probably rooted in how much reverence you have

294
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:42,780
for the idea of the innocence of childhood, which, for me, is not at all terribly.

295
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,380
But that is a big thing in American culture especially,

296
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,980
the sanctity of the innocence of childhood and how sad it is when we all have to lose it,

297
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,380
and that innocence of childhood is better than the cynicism of adulthood,

298
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,380
which is why so many of these have to do with shedding adulty trappings

299
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,580
and returning to the childy goodness of nature and purity.

300
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,980
But the best way to enjoy Santa Claus is to probably take a page from the way children do,

301
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,980
just don't think about it too much.
