0	9000	So, um, turns out that doing loose canons on real people and events is, uh, kind of a bummer.
9000	12000	You know, because the world is sad.
12000	15000	Speaking of which, let's talk about Marilyn Monroe.
15000	21000	A kiss on the hand may be quite condimental...
21000	26000	Glamour icon, tragic cautionary tale, attributed quoter of shitty Facebook memes
26000	31000	that there is absolutely no evidence that Marilyn ever said that people stop spreading this.
31000	33000	Goddammit, no.
36000	41000	No, stop it. This is a made-up quote. Stop attributing it to Marilyn Monroe.
41000	43000	But it is pretty telling.
43000	51000	People are more interested in the idea of Marilyn Monroe than in the person that she actually was.
52000	56000	A construct, if you will, that people make up to be more relatable.
56000	62000	That's why when I think of Marilyn Monroe, one of the first things that comes to my mind is Andy Warhol's painting,
62000	64000	which is called Marilyn Diptych.
64000	66000	Because really, there are two Marilyns.
66000	68000	The actual human being who lived and died tragically,
68000	74000	and Marilyn Monroe, the glamorous symbol of Hollywood glitz and glamour who is just that.
74000	76000	A symbol. A construct.
76000	82000	The reason Warhol's work comes to mind for me is because Marilyn's face was the image that he set on
82000	85000	as the idea of pop culture ubiquity.
85000	91000	And some people interpret this to mean that repetition and ubiquity render an image meaningless.
91000	95000	He also famously did the same thing with Campbell's soup cans, Coke bottles, Elvis.
95000	100000	This therefore being his critique slash tribute to pop culture through pop art.
100000	104000	So in a perverse way, that's what made Warhol's interpretation become such a perfect statement
104000	106000	of what pop culture even was.
106000	111000	This human person's face has become so ubiquitous that it's just an image.
111000	114000	It has f**k all to do with the actual human being who owned it.
114000	117000	In terms of symbology, aside from the image Warhol made famous,
117000	121000	her two most famous images come from the Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend scene,
121000	124000	from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, famously re-appropriated by Madonna,
124000	128000	and the sewer grate scene from The Seven Year Itch, parodied by everyone.
129000	131000	Oops.
131000	132000	Cut!
132000	135000	Repetition, ad nauseum, yes, but to what end?
135000	138000	She means something to people, but what?
138000	141000	Marilyn gets name dropped in pop songs a lot.
145000	149000	But the most famous pop tribute to her is Candle in the Wind.
150000	155000	And this one kind of sets that tone of trying to separate the symbol that was Marilyn Monroe
155000	159000	from the person who was Norma Jean Mortensen or Baker or...
159000	166000	So I find that pop culture depictions of Marilyn Monroe tend to want to reconcile this dichotomy,
166000	170000	this split between the icon of Hollywood glitz and glamour
170000	173000	and a troubled young woman who never really learned to love herself.
173000	177000	The song lyric was adapted into a low-budget movie called Goodbye Norma Jean.
177000	180000	Prove it! Prove what he said!
180000	182000	You owe me that!
182000	188000	It holds a yikes rating on IMDb, and there are a surprising number of low-budget Marilyn biopics.
188000	191000	There's also a few about her relationship with the Kennedys,
191000	195000	and the fact that she's the only woman in the world who's ever been in a relationship with a man,
195000	199000	and the fact that she's the only woman in the world who's ever been in a relationship with a man.
200000	203000	There's also a few about her relationship with the Kennedys,
203000	207000	and how her death was like a false flag or something,
207000	211000	and there's all sorts of truth or nonsense.
211000	214000	Yes, there are Marilyn truth or shock, I know, but we're not going to get into that.
214000	219000	So before the 90s it was mostly biopic stuff, but then VHS became big,
219000	222000	and with it, direct-to-video schlock.
222000	226000	My favorite of this group is a film called Marilyn Alive and Behind Bars,
226000	228000	which is exactly what it sounds like.
228000	229000	I'm Marilyn Monroe.
229000	231000	I thought she died.
231000	233000	That's a lie.
233000	237000	It took place in the present day of 1992, when Marilyn was in her 60s or so,
237000	240000	but still looking good.
240000	245000	Basically, her death was faked by the studio to commit insurance fraud,
245000	247000	but they kept her alive for some reason?
247000	250000	And also there are mind-control scientists?
250000	254000	They insured my life for millions of dollars,
254000	257000	and then they murdered a look-alike, Marilyn Monroe,
257000	259000	and left her in my bedroom.
259000	263000	Did you ever think that maybe there's more to life than being really, really,
263000	266000	really ridiculously good-looking?
266000	271000	She also looks the same as she does in her publicity stills of old,
271000	274000	because I guess Marilyn went to all this effort for 30 years every day
274000	276000	without changing a thing.
276000	278000	You know, getting a haircut,
278000	282000	and the mad mind-control scientists even gave her hair bleach. Nice.
282000	284000	There was another one of these called Netherworld,
284000	286000	and that featured a zombie Marilyn.
286000	289000	First I was alive,
289000	291000	and then I was dead,
291000	293000	and now I'm alive again.
293000	294000	Classy.
294000	296000	There was one woman in the 90s named Susan Griffiths
296000	300000	who seems to have built an entire career out of being a professional Marilyn Monroe impersonator,
300000	302000	and she pops up a lot.
302000	306000	She first appears in a 1991 made-for-TV movie called Marilyn and Me,
306000	309000	which is basically a precursor to My Week with Marilyn.
309000	311000	She pops up again in an episode of Quantum Leap,
311000	316000	where Sam quantum leaps into Marilyn Monroe's chauffeur right before she dies.
316000	320000	The premise of this show is protagonist Sam quantum leaps into different people's lives
320000	322000	slash bodies to do destiny things,
322000	324000	and he's a nice guy who wants to help,
324000	327000	so it's sad that she's destined to die young and tragic,
327000	330000	but hey, at least he puts it off by a couple months.
330000	334000	Are you telling me that I saved her life so she could be in one last picture?
334000	336000	But what a picture.
336000	337000	You know what? No comment.
337000	340000	Griffiths is again as a Marilyn impersonator in Pulp Fiction,
340000	344000	and yet again in the short-lived TV series Time Cop.
344000	346000	Actually, I was hoping to get a little advice from you.
346000	348000	Which I didn't know existed either.
348000	351000	Harmony Korine made a 2007 film called Mr. Lonely
351000	354000	that takes place in a commune of celebrity impersonators.
354000	357000	These guys have no real identity outside of who they're impersonating,
357000	360000	so in this film she's just Marilyn,
360000	365000	and Marilyn has a bit of a love triangle with Charlie Chaplin and Michael Jackson,
365000	367000	who eventually hangs herself.
367000	369000	Harmony Korine.
369000	372000	Yeah, I have zero thoughtful insight into this filmmaker.
372000	375000	If you want that, you should go watch the Brows Held High episode.
375000	377000	I'll be playing Grushanka.
377000	378000	Can you spell that?
378000	380000	Sure. Can you?
381000	384000	My Week with Marilyn is the highest profile of the recent adaptations,
384000	386000	and it's a'ight.
386000	388000	Michelle Williams is great,
388000	390000	despite Eddie Redmayne's performance that, frankly,
390000	393000	made me think we'd never see this guy again.
393000	396000	This one documents the tense production of The Prince and the Showgirl,
396000	398000	which was a real movie directed by Laurence Olivier
398000	401000	during her time while she was married to playwright Arthur Miller,
401000	403000	who wrote The Crucible.
403000	404000	God, she had a weird life.
404000	407000	Anyway, it was based on two books by Colin Clark,
407000	409000	who was played by Redmayne in this film,
409000	412000	and which may or may not be accurate, we'll never know.
412000	416000	When you sing happy birthday to someone you love
416000	419000	Or see diamonds you wish were all free
419000	422000	The same year there was a short-lived NBC drama called Smash,
422000	426000	in which a Broadway musical based on the life of Marilyn Monroe is produced,
426000	430000	riding that glee wave for adults, I guess.
430000	436000	This show was more about intercast drama than about Marilyn,
436000	438000	but Angelica Houston was in it.
438000	441000	There's a 2012 feature in the vein of Movie 42
441000	444000	called Inappropriate Comedy,
444000	447000	and here she's played by Lindsay Lohan.
447000	450000	Lindsay Lohan plays a Marilyn-alike in an app
450000	453000	where the viewer gets to look up her skirt.
453000	455000	And that's the app.
455000	457000	That is Inappropriate.
457000	460000	See, it's called Inappropriate Comedy
460000	465000	because it's an app and it's inappropriate.
467000	468000	Burn everything.
468000	471000	Lana Del Rey did a Kanye-style short film
471000	474000	out of her album Born to Die called Tropico
474000	478000	that features her and that albino model dude I see on Tumblr sometimes
478000	479000	as Adam and Eve,
479000	481000	John Wayne as God,
481000	484000	and Marilyn Monroe and Elvis as...
484000	486000	Marilyn's my mother,
486000	490000	Jesus is my bestest friend.
490000	493000	Kind of ties back to that Marilyn the Spirit Guide thing.
493000	496000	Lana Del Rey loves to romanticize and appropriate
496000	499000	that drugged-out starlet persona, so...
499000	500000	okay.
500000	503000	And I find this interesting because when you look at the likes of Lana Del Rey
503000	507000	and Megan Fox and how they kind of want to emulate her,
508000	510000	I mean, it makes sense.
510000	512000	And I know Lana Del Rey is pretty out there,
512000	514000	but I think she does kind of hit on something
514000	519000	with the way that we deify our pop culture icons.
519000	523000	Monroe's image was recently acquired and is now managed by Authentic Brands Group,
523000	528000	a business which specializes in owning and managing dead celebrities.
528000	531000	So now this image of Marilyn Monroe that has become almost folkloric
531000	535000	is now a company's intellectual property.
537000	540000	And that's how she's come to be codified in post-Marilyn interpretations.
540000	542000	Marilyn is the symbol.
542000	544000	A symbol of dying young,
544000	546000	a symbol of Hollywood glamour,
546000	548000	a cautionary tale, whatever.
548000	550000	And Norma Jean is the person.
550000	552000	And there's almost this sense of nascent guilt,
552000	555000	the way she was objectified and dehumanized in life,
555000	557000	ultimately leading to her death.
557000	562000	Not that that necessarily redefined the way we relate to celebrities.
562000	565000	The idea of her is relatable, but it's still kind of a brand,
565000	567000	hence her being misquoted so much.
567000	571000	Which is kind of funny because I think the real Marilyn would take umbrage with that.
571000	573000	Here is a real quote.
573000	574000	If I'm going to have that kind of influence,
574000	578000	I want to be sure it's because of something I've actually said or written.
578000	583000	So Marilyn has all this influence now as like an image macro and a soundbite,
583000	586000	but most of it isn't really hers.
586000	588000	Sadly poetic.
588000	592000	Speaking of sad, I promise I will have the next episode out soon.
592000	596000	Thank you all to the patrons who make this show possible,
596000	599000	and also to my researcher slash AE, Elisa Hansen.
599000	601000	You can vote for the next episode in the link below,
601000	603000	and I will see you next time.
603000	604000	Soon, I promise.
608000	611000	What's 5,000 times better than a candle in the wind?
611000	616000	This song is called 5,000 Candles in the Wind.
