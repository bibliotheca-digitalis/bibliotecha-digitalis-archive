1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So, um, turns out that doing loose canons on real people and events is, uh, kind of a bummer.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You know, because the world is sad.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Speaking of which, let's talk about Marilyn Monroe.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
A kiss on the hand may be quite condimental...

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Glamour icon, tragic cautionary tale, attributed quoter of shitty Facebook memes

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
that there is absolutely no evidence that Marilyn ever said that people stop spreading this.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Goddammit, no.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
No, stop it. This is a made-up quote. Stop attributing it to Marilyn Monroe.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But it is pretty telling.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
People are more interested in the idea of Marilyn Monroe than in the person that she actually was.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
A construct, if you will, that people make up to be more relatable.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That's why when I think of Marilyn Monroe, one of the first things that comes to my mind is Andy Warhol's painting,

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
which is called Marilyn Diptych.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Because really, there are two Marilyns.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The actual human being who lived and died tragically,

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and Marilyn Monroe, the glamorous symbol of Hollywood glitz and glamour who is just that.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
A symbol. A construct.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The reason Warhol's work comes to mind for me is because Marilyn's face was the image that he set on

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
as the idea of pop culture ubiquity.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And some people interpret this to mean that repetition and ubiquity render an image meaningless.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
He also famously did the same thing with Campbell's soup cans, Coke bottles, Elvis.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This therefore being his critique slash tribute to pop culture through pop art.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So in a perverse way, that's what made Warhol's interpretation become such a perfect statement

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
of what pop culture even was.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This human person's face has become so ubiquitous that it's just an image.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It has f**k all to do with the actual human being who owned it.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
In terms of symbology, aside from the image Warhol made famous,

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
her two most famous images come from the Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend scene,

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, famously re-appropriated by Madonna,

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and the sewer grate scene from The Seven Year Itch, parodied by everyone.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Oops.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Cut!

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Repetition, ad nauseum, yes, but to what end?

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
She means something to people, but what?

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Marilyn gets name dropped in pop songs a lot.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But the most famous pop tribute to her is Candle in the Wind.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And this one kind of sets that tone of trying to separate the symbol that was Marilyn Monroe

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
from the person who was Norma Jean Mortensen or Baker or...

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So I find that pop culture depictions of Marilyn Monroe tend to want to reconcile this dichotomy,

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
this split between the icon of Hollywood glitz and glamour

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and a troubled young woman who never really learned to love herself.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The song lyric was adapted into a low-budget movie called Goodbye Norma Jean.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Prove it! Prove what he said!

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You owe me that!

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It holds a yikes rating on IMDb, and there are a surprising number of low-budget Marilyn biopics.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
There's also a few about her relationship with the Kennedys,

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and the fact that she's the only woman in the world who's ever been in a relationship with a man,

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
and the fact that she's the only woman in the world who's ever been in a relationship with a man.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
There's also a few about her relationship with the Kennedys,

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and how her death was like a false flag or something,

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and there's all sorts of truth or nonsense.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yes, there are Marilyn truth or shock, I know, but we're not going to get into that.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So before the 90s it was mostly biopic stuff, but then VHS became big,

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and with it, direct-to-video schlock.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
My favorite of this group is a film called Marilyn Alive and Behind Bars,

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
which is exactly what it sounds like.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm Marilyn Monroe.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I thought she died.

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's a lie.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It took place in the present day of 1992, when Marilyn was in her 60s or so,

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
but still looking good.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Basically, her death was faked by the studio to commit insurance fraud,

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
but they kept her alive for some reason?

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And also there are mind-control scientists?

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
They insured my life for millions of dollars,

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and then they murdered a look-alike, Marilyn Monroe,

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and left her in my bedroom.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Did you ever think that maybe there's more to life than being really, really,

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
really ridiculously good-looking?

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
She also looks the same as she does in her publicity stills of old,

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
because I guess Marilyn went to all this effort for 30 years every day

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
without changing a thing.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You know, getting a haircut,

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and the mad mind-control scientists even gave her hair bleach. Nice.

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
There was another one of these called Netherworld,

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and that featured a zombie Marilyn.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
First I was alive,

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and then I was dead,

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and now I'm alive again.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Classy.

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
There was one woman in the 90s named Susan Griffiths

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
who seems to have built an entire career out of being a professional Marilyn Monroe impersonator,

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and she pops up a lot.

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
She first appears in a 1991 made-for-TV movie called Marilyn and Me,

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
which is basically a precursor to My Week with Marilyn.

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
She pops up again in an episode of Quantum Leap,

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
where Sam quantum leaps into Marilyn Monroe's chauffeur right before she dies.

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The premise of this show is protagonist Sam quantum leaps into different people's lives

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
slash bodies to do destiny things,

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and he's a nice guy who wants to help,

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
so it's sad that she's destined to die young and tragic,

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
but hey, at least he puts it off by a couple months.

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Are you telling me that I saved her life so she could be in one last picture?

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But what a picture.

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You know what? No comment.

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Griffiths is again as a Marilyn impersonator in Pulp Fiction,

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and yet again in the short-lived TV series Time Cop.

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Actually, I was hoping to get a little advice from you.

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Which I didn't know existed either.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Harmony Korine made a 2007 film called Mr. Lonely

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
that takes place in a commune of celebrity impersonators.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
These guys have no real identity outside of who they're impersonating,

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
so in this film she's just Marilyn,

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and Marilyn has a bit of a love triangle with Charlie Chaplin and Michael Jackson,

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
who eventually hangs herself.

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Harmony Korine.

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah, I have zero thoughtful insight into this filmmaker.

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
If you want that, you should go watch the Brows Held High episode.

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'll be playing Grushanka.

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Can you spell that?

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Sure. Can you?

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
My Week with Marilyn is the highest profile of the recent adaptations,

113
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and it's a'ight.

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Michelle Williams is great,

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
despite Eddie Redmayne's performance that, frankly,

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
made me think we'd never see this guy again.

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
This one documents the tense production of The Prince and the Showgirl,

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
which was a real movie directed by Laurence Olivier

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
during her time while she was married to playwright Arthur Miller,

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
who wrote The Crucible.

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
God, she had a weird life.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Anyway, it was based on two books by Colin Clark,

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
who was played by Redmayne in this film,

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and which may or may not be accurate, we'll never know.

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
When you sing happy birthday to someone you love

126
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Or see diamonds you wish were all free

127
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The same year there was a short-lived NBC drama called Smash,

128
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
in which a Broadway musical based on the life of Marilyn Monroe is produced,

129
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
riding that glee wave for adults, I guess.

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This show was more about intercast drama than about Marilyn,

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
but Angelica Houston was in it.

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
There's a 2012 feature in the vein of Movie 42

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
called Inappropriate Comedy,

134
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and here she's played by Lindsay Lohan.

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Lindsay Lohan plays a Marilyn-alike in an app

136
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
where the viewer gets to look up her skirt.

137
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And that's the app.

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That is Inappropriate.

139
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
See, it's called Inappropriate Comedy

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
because it's an app and it's inappropriate.

141
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Burn everything.

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Lana Del Rey did a Kanye-style short film

143
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
out of her album Born to Die called Tropico

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
that features her and that albino model dude I see on Tumblr sometimes

145
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
as Adam and Eve,

146
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
John Wayne as God,

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and Marilyn Monroe and Elvis as...

148
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Marilyn's my mother,

149
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Jesus is my bestest friend.

150
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Kind of ties back to that Marilyn the Spirit Guide thing.

151
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Lana Del Rey loves to romanticize and appropriate

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
that drugged-out starlet persona, so...

153
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
okay.

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And I find this interesting because when you look at the likes of Lana Del Rey

155
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and Megan Fox and how they kind of want to emulate her,

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I mean, it makes sense.

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And I know Lana Del Rey is pretty out there,

158
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
but I think she does kind of hit on something

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
with the way that we deify our pop culture icons.

160
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Monroe's image was recently acquired and is now managed by Authentic Brands Group,

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
a business which specializes in owning and managing dead celebrities.

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So now this image of Marilyn Monroe that has become almost folkloric

163
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
is now a company's intellectual property.

164
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And that's how she's come to be codified in post-Marilyn interpretations.

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Marilyn is the symbol.

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
A symbol of dying young,

167
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
a symbol of Hollywood glamour,

168
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
a cautionary tale, whatever.

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And Norma Jean is the person.

170
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And there's almost this sense of nascent guilt,

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
the way she was objectified and dehumanized in life,

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
ultimately leading to her death.

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Not that that necessarily redefined the way we relate to celebrities.

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The idea of her is relatable, but it's still kind of a brand,

175
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
hence her being misquoted so much.

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Which is kind of funny because I think the real Marilyn would take umbrage with that.

177
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Here is a real quote.

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
If I'm going to have that kind of influence,

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I want to be sure it's because of something I've actually said or written.

180
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So Marilyn has all this influence now as like an image macro and a soundbite,

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
but most of it isn't really hers.

182
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Sadly poetic.

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Speaking of sad, I promise I will have the next episode out soon.

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Thank you all to the patrons who make this show possible,

185
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and also to my researcher slash AE, Elisa Hansen.

186
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You can vote for the next episode in the link below,

and I will see you next time.

188
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Soon, I promise.

189
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What's 5,000 times better than a candle in the wind?

190
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
This song is called 5,000 Candles in the Wind.
