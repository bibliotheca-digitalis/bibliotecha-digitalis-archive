00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
So, um, turns out that doing loose canons on real people and events is, uh, kind of a bummer.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
You know, because the world is sad.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Speaking of which, let's talk about Marilyn Monroe.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
A kiss on the hand may be quite condimental...

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
Glamour icon, tragic cautionary tale, attributed quoter of shitty Facebook memes

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
that there is absolutely no evidence that Marilyn ever said that people stop spreading this.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Goddammit, no.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
No, stop it. This is a made-up quote. Stop attributing it to Marilyn Monroe.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
But it is pretty telling.

00:43.000 --> 00:51.000
People are more interested in the idea of Marilyn Monroe than in the person that she actually was.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
A construct, if you will, that people make up to be more relatable.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
That's why when I think of Marilyn Monroe, one of the first things that comes to my mind is Andy Warhol's painting,

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
which is called Marilyn Diptych.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Because really, there are two Marilyns.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
The actual human being who lived and died tragically,

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
and Marilyn Monroe, the glamorous symbol of Hollywood glitz and glamour who is just that.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
A symbol. A construct.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
The reason Warhol's work comes to mind for me is because Marilyn's face was the image that he set on

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
as the idea of pop culture ubiquity.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
And some people interpret this to mean that repetition and ubiquity render an image meaningless.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
He also famously did the same thing with Campbell's soup cans, Coke bottles, Elvis.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
This therefore being his critique slash tribute to pop culture through pop art.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
So in a perverse way, that's what made Warhol's interpretation become such a perfect statement

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
of what pop culture even was.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
This human person's face has become so ubiquitous that it's just an image.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
It has f**k all to do with the actual human being who owned it.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
In terms of symbology, aside from the image Warhol made famous,

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
her two most famous images come from the Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend scene,

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, famously re-appropriated by Madonna,

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
and the sewer grate scene from The Seven Year Itch, parodied by everyone.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Oops.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Cut!

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Repetition, ad nauseum, yes, but to what end?

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
She means something to people, but what?

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Marilyn gets name dropped in pop songs a lot.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
But the most famous pop tribute to her is Candle in the Wind.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
And this one kind of sets that tone of trying to separate the symbol that was Marilyn Monroe

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
from the person who was Norma Jean Mortensen or Baker or...

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
So I find that pop culture depictions of Marilyn Monroe tend to want to reconcile this dichotomy,

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
this split between the icon of Hollywood glitz and glamour

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
and a troubled young woman who never really learned to love herself.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
The song lyric was adapted into a low-budget movie called Goodbye Norma Jean.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Prove it! Prove what he said!

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
You owe me that!

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
It holds a yikes rating on IMDb, and there are a surprising number of low-budget Marilyn biopics.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
There's also a few about her relationship with the Kennedys,

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
and the fact that she's the only woman in the world who's ever been in a relationship with a man,

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
and the fact that she's the only woman in the world who's ever been in a relationship with a man.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
There's also a few about her relationship with the Kennedys,

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
and how her death was like a false flag or something,

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
and there's all sorts of truth or nonsense.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Yes, there are Marilyn truth or shock, I know, but we're not going to get into that.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
So before the 90s it was mostly biopic stuff, but then VHS became big,

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
and with it, direct-to-video schlock.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
My favorite of this group is a film called Marilyn Alive and Behind Bars,

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
which is exactly what it sounds like.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
I'm Marilyn Monroe.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
I thought she died.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
That's a lie.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
It took place in the present day of 1992, when Marilyn was in her 60s or so,

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
but still looking good.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
Basically, her death was faked by the studio to commit insurance fraud,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
but they kept her alive for some reason?

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
And also there are mind-control scientists?

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
They insured my life for millions of dollars,

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
and then they murdered a look-alike, Marilyn Monroe,

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
and left her in my bedroom.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
Did you ever think that maybe there's more to life than being really, really,

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
really ridiculously good-looking?

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000
She also looks the same as she does in her publicity stills of old,

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
because I guess Marilyn went to all this effort for 30 years every day

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
without changing a thing.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
You know, getting a haircut,

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
and the mad mind-control scientists even gave her hair bleach. Nice.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
There was another one of these called Netherworld,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
and that featured a zombie Marilyn.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
First I was alive,

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
and then I was dead,

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
and now I'm alive again.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Classy.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
There was one woman in the 90s named Susan Griffiths

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
who seems to have built an entire career out of being a professional Marilyn Monroe impersonator,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
and she pops up a lot.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
She first appears in a 1991 made-for-TV movie called Marilyn and Me,

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
which is basically a precursor to My Week with Marilyn.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
She pops up again in an episode of Quantum Leap,

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
where Sam quantum leaps into Marilyn Monroe's chauffeur right before she dies.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
The premise of this show is protagonist Sam quantum leaps into different people's lives

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
slash bodies to do destiny things,

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
and he's a nice guy who wants to help,

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
so it's sad that she's destined to die young and tragic,

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
but hey, at least he puts it off by a couple months.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
Are you telling me that I saved her life so she could be in one last picture?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
But what a picture.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
You know what? No comment.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Griffiths is again as a Marilyn impersonator in Pulp Fiction,

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
and yet again in the short-lived TV series Time Cop.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Actually, I was hoping to get a little advice from you.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Which I didn't know existed either.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
Harmony Korine made a 2007 film called Mr. Lonely

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
that takes place in a commune of celebrity impersonators.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
These guys have no real identity outside of who they're impersonating,

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
so in this film she's just Marilyn,

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
and Marilyn has a bit of a love triangle with Charlie Chaplin and Michael Jackson,

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
who eventually hangs herself.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Harmony Korine.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
Yeah, I have zero thoughtful insight into this filmmaker.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
If you want that, you should go watch the Brows Held High episode.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
I'll be playing Grushanka.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Can you spell that?

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Sure. Can you?

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
My Week with Marilyn is the highest profile of the recent adaptations,

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
and it's a'ight.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Michelle Williams is great,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
despite Eddie Redmayne's performance that, frankly,

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
made me think we'd never see this guy again.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
This one documents the tense production of The Prince and the Showgirl,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
which was a real movie directed by Laurence Olivier

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
during her time while she was married to playwright Arthur Miller,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
who wrote The Crucible.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
God, she had a weird life.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Anyway, it was based on two books by Colin Clark,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
who was played by Redmayne in this film,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
and which may or may not be accurate, we'll never know.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
When you sing happy birthday to someone you love

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
Or see diamonds you wish were all free

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
The same year there was a short-lived NBC drama called Smash,

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
in which a Broadway musical based on the life of Marilyn Monroe is produced,

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
riding that glee wave for adults, I guess.

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
This show was more about intercast drama than about Marilyn,

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
but Angelica Houston was in it.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
There's a 2012 feature in the vein of Movie 42

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
called Inappropriate Comedy,

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
and here she's played by Lindsay Lohan.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
Lindsay Lohan plays a Marilyn-alike in an app

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
where the viewer gets to look up her skirt.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
And that's the app.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
That is Inappropriate.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
See, it's called Inappropriate Comedy

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
because it's an app and it's inappropriate.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Burn everything.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
Lana Del Rey did a Kanye-style short film

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
out of her album Born to Die called Tropico

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
that features her and that albino model dude I see on Tumblr sometimes

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
as Adam and Eve,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
John Wayne as God,

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
and Marilyn Monroe and Elvis as...

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Marilyn's my mother,

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
Jesus is my bestest friend.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Kind of ties back to that Marilyn the Spirit Guide thing.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Lana Del Rey loves to romanticize and appropriate

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
that drugged-out starlet persona, so...

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
okay.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
And I find this interesting because when you look at the likes of Lana Del Rey

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
and Megan Fox and how they kind of want to emulate her,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
I mean, it makes sense.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
And I know Lana Del Rey is pretty out there,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
but I think she does kind of hit on something

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
with the way that we deify our pop culture icons.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
Monroe's image was recently acquired and is now managed by Authentic Brands Group,

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
a business which specializes in owning and managing dead celebrities.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
So now this image of Marilyn Monroe that has become almost folkloric

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
is now a company's intellectual property.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
And that's how she's come to be codified in post-Marilyn interpretations.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Marilyn is the symbol.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
A symbol of dying young,

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
a symbol of Hollywood glamour,

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
a cautionary tale, whatever.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
And Norma Jean is the person.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
And there's almost this sense of nascent guilt,

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
the way she was objectified and dehumanized in life,

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
ultimately leading to her death.

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
Not that that necessarily redefined the way we relate to celebrities.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
The idea of her is relatable, but it's still kind of a brand,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
hence her being misquoted so much.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
Which is kind of funny because I think the real Marilyn would take umbrage with that.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Here is a real quote.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
If I'm going to have that kind of influence,

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
I want to be sure it's because of something I've actually said or written.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
So Marilyn has all this influence now as like an image macro and a soundbite,

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
but most of it isn't really hers.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Sadly poetic.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
Speaking of sad, I promise I will have the next episode out soon.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
Thank you all to the patrons who make this show possible,

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
and also to my researcher slash AE, Elisa Hansen.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
You can vote for the next episode in the link below,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
and I will see you next time.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Soon, I promise.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
What's 5,000 times better than a candle in the wind?

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
This song is called 5,000 Candles in the Wind.
