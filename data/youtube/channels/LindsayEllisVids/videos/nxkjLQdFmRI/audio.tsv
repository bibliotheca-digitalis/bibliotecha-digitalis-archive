0	5280	The Oscars are one of those things that we care about because we are told to care about them,
5280	8200	despite the fact that we say we don't care about them,
8200	12960	and then every year we vow not to care about them because they clearly don't reflect our taste,
12960	16920	and then we write big, long think pieces about how irrelevant the Oscars are
16920	19080	and how much we don't care about the Oscars.
19080	22880	So, um, why don't we care about the Oscars?
22880	28160	The general consensus is that it's because the Oscars are less concerned with actual quality
28160	31920	or important movies that further the form of cinema as an art
31920	36520	so much as hitting repetitive and predictable Oscar movie attributes.
36520	40320	Is it character-driven? Does it take place in Hollywood?
40320	44160	Is Meryl Streep in it? Does it involve the Holocaust?
44160	47880	Are the black characters either slaves or beleaguered servants of some sort?
47880	49840	Are the Weinsteins involved?
49840	55280	Is Leonardo DiCaprio performing some form of desperate self-flagellation?
55320	57360	But, here is the thing.
57360	59200	It wasn't always like this.
59200	64280	There didn't used to be a little sub-industry catering to Oscar glory.
64280	67520	When did we start using terms like Oscar bait?
67520	74480	When did best picture go from generally being agreed upon as the most important picture of the year to...
74480	75480	...not?
75480	78160	So, rather than doing a history of the Oscars,
78160	82880	I wanted to look at a history of what type of movie is favored by the Oscars.
82880	86480	Because it wasn't always so predictable.
86480	88800	And the Oscar goes to...
88800	93760	Okay, so first, who is the Academy and how do you get into it anyway?
93760	97200	Well, you win an award or you beg your way in.
97200	100080	And also someone has to sponsor you if you didn't win an award.
100080	101840	It's kind of like being an AA.
101840	105160	For instance, George Lucas, he is not a member of the Academy.
105160	110800	He actually declined membership, but Meatloaf is.
110800	114680	And actually, Meatloaf considers himself a sign of diversity within the Academy.
114680	120960	You know, because War Horse made him cry instead of, like, the artist.
120960	124640	The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science was created in 1926
124640	128760	when MGM co-founder Louis B. Mayer and some other studio heads
128760	132200	agreed that they needed a film organization that sounded prestigy
132200	134720	and also preempted the need for unions.
134720	137920	Also, for legitimacy, maybe it should give out awards or something.
137920	142120	As opposed to almost all other film award ceremonies, like the Golden Globes,
142120	144360	which are awarded by the press or critics,
144360	148200	the Academy Awards are voted on by prestige industry people.
148200	151400	And that's why they matter more than other awards.
151400	154240	And also, the Academy is disproportionately made up of actors.
154240	157720	So, if you ever wonder why movies that tend to be contemplative,
157720	162040	dialogue-driven character pieces that take place in Hollywood
162040	166920	are more likely to be nominated slash win than perhaps they deserve,
166920	168240	there you go.
168240	170440	But it wasn't always this way.
170440	174560	As a random for instance, let's look at the 1971 Oscars.
174560	176360	Of the five Best Picture nominees,
176360	180120	four of them had been in the top ten highest-grossing films of that year.
180120	183440	In 1975, three of the five Best Picture nominees
183440	185880	were in the top ten highest-grossing films.
185880	188600	By 1980, that number had dropped to two,
188600	191960	and it kind of stayed at this level until the 2000s.
191960	195000	By 2005, none of the five Best Picture nominees
195040	197920	even cracked the top 20 for domestic gross.
197920	201040	Same for 2006, the year that Crash won Best Picture.
201040	205240	Not one of the Best Picture nominees even cracked the top 20.
205240	208720	Both Star Wars and Jaws were nominated for Best Picture.
208720	212880	But after that, we started to see a slow divergence develop.
212880	217320	The films that most people saw got less and less awards recognition,
217320	220880	and awards recognition was used to boost attendance for smaller films
220880	223200	that people might not have seen otherwise.
223200	225480	There were exceptions.
226640	228720	But in terms of broader nominee trends,
228720	230920	most films started to follow a pattern.
230920	234520	Since the early 2000s, a somewhat predictable algorithm has emerged
234520	237040	for what type of film will get nominated.
237040	240520	Hell, two years before Kate Winslet won her Oscar for Best Actress,
240520	243880	she parodized how she planned on doing it in an episode of Extras.
243880	247080	No, I'm doing it because I've noticed that if you do a film about the Holocaust,
247080	248400	guaranteed an Oscar.
248400	251000	And then two years later, what do you know?
251000	254200	In terms of nominees, there's also a lot of money involved.
254200	258120	Promoting films for awards consideration costs money.
258120	261000	So, could one say that a trend of films being produced
261000	264480	intentionally featuring Oscar movie attributes has emerged?
264480	267920	That producers and studios are essentially gaming the system,
267920	270480	making movies with less attention to quality
270480	275400	than to features that Academy Award voters have shown preference for?
275400	278760	Yes, absolutely. Yes, absolutely.
278760	281560	People harp on Crash, and deservedly so,
281560	285080	but perhaps the most overt recent example of this phenomenon
285080	288280	is 2011's Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,
288280	291120	a movie that nobody saw and nobody liked.
291120	293880	It had its elite property acquisition,
293880	297600	topical subject matter, mentally challenged child,
297600	300880	elite principals, including Academy favorite Tom Hanks,
300880	304200	but this movie got no other major film award nominations
304200	307720	from any other major group except for the Academy.
307720	310680	And it also has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 45%,
310680	313880	the worst score received by any Best Picture nominee
313880	315680	in Rotten Tomatoes history.
315680	319120	Producer Scott Rudin used methods that had worked for him previously
319120	321960	with No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood,
321960	324200	pushed a big four-year consideration campaign
324200	326520	that, yes, cost a lot of money and, what do you know,
326520	329800	Best Picture nomination, you know, for all the good it did.
329800	332200	So when did the studios begin to use the Oscars
332200	335080	as a means of marketing a newly released film
335080	337280	instead of the other way around?
337320	338800	Raaargh!
341640	345160	The Deer Hunter is, well, A, it's really long,
345160	347080	and B, it's really hard to watch.
347080	348400	When the movie was about ready to go,
348400	350560	the filmmakers had dropped a film on the studio
350560	354160	that was a critical darling but near impossible to market.
354160	357360	Hey, everyone, I know the Vietnam War just ended in disgrace
357360	361240	barely three years ago, but wanna watch Robert De Niro
361240	364320	and Christopher Walken suffer horribly for three hours?
365320	367760	So the producers had this great idea of,
367760	371320	hey, let's get in the absolute barest minimum requirement
371320	373320	for Oscar nominations for the following year,
373320	375840	namely a limited release in New York and LA
375840	378000	and also some other minor stuff,
378000	379960	and then go into wide release
379960	382480	after the nominations come out in January.
382480	385520	The winner is Christopher Walken in The Deer Hunter.
385520	387000	And lo and behold, success.
387000	388880	The film won five Academy Awards,
388880	392720	including Best Picture, Director and Supporting Actor for Walken.
392960	396080	And obviously, this did not change the industry overnight,
396080	397640	but over the next 30 years,
397640	400080	strategies like that used with The Deer Hunter
400080	402800	went from outliers to pretty much
402800	405200	all of the Oscar contenders reusing it,
405200	407360	especially in the actor categories.
407360	408520	In the following decades,
408520	410320	the more popular films that made lots of money
410320	412640	became less and less concerned with prestige
412640	414120	and more and more concerned with appealing
414120	416240	to as wide a demographic as possible.
416240	417080	As it turns out,
417080	420160	the masses don't really care about awards all that much.
420160	423560	Why wasn't The Dark Knight nominated for Best Picture?
423560	425080	The normies wondered.
425080	427520	Why was Wali relegated to the ghetto
427520	428920	that his best animated feature
428920	431880	instead of Best Picture like Beauty and the Beast was?
431880	434760	And yeah, this would kind of end up eventually backfiring
434760	436440	because the movies that got nominated
436440	438360	were seen by so few people
438360	440800	in the weeks and months leading up to the Oscars.
440800	443760	And viewership has been on a pretty even keel downward
443760	444760	since the 90s,
444760	447760	bottoming out in 2008 with its lowest ratings ever,
447760	449280	at which point the Academy was like,
449280	452800	yeah, we should probably include some more mainstream fare
452800	454040	in the Best Picture category
454040	457680	because no one is watching our show anymore
457680	459920	and we want to stay relevant.
459920	462120	The last time 10 films were nominated
462120	464680	for Best Picture was 1943.
464680	467720	In 2010, when they upped the Best Picture category
467720	470160	back to 10 as it was in the early days,
470160	473880	we got nominees like District 9 and Avatar,
473880	475800	a flaccid attempt to push back against
475800	477600	the Academy's own internal biases
477640	480920	concerning what is indeed awards-worthy.
480920	483480	That said, it's still mostly been the awards
483480	485520	as marketing movies that get nominated,
485520	487080	especially in the acting categories
487080	488960	with a few mass appeal ones sprinkled in there
488960	491360	for technical awards and Best Picture.
491360	493000	Though the fact that Mad Max Fury Road
493000	496120	was nominated this year for as many awards as it was,
496120	497560	granted mostly technical,
497560	500120	is a minor miracle unto itself.
500120	501560	And I'm honestly kind of surprised
501560	503480	that it was nominated for Best Picture.
503480	505320	So progress, eh.
505320	507760	So moving forward, there has been a lot of talk
507760	510240	about this Oscar bait strategy in recent weeks
510240	513160	and how it ties in with pushes for greater diversity,
513160	515880	especially, again, within the acting categories.
515880	518760	I mean, yeah, it would be great if it was a meritocracy
518760	521400	and yes, these 20 people just happened
521400	523520	to be the best choices that came out this year,
523520	526200	but come on, it's political
526200	528600	and the members of the Academy,
528600	532840	in terms of demographic, are a touch homogenous.
532840	534360	Academy membership is kind of like
534360	536040	being a Supreme Court justice.
536040	538360	It is lifelong and historically it has comprised
538360	540200	mostly of crusty old white guys,
540200	543040	even greater in proportion to the overwhelmingly male,
543040	545680	overwhelmingly white film industry as a whole.
545680	548840	So in a panicked move to outrun total irrelevance,
548840	550800	the Academy has announced that voting rights
550800	553320	will be limited to 10-year cycles.
553320	555280	If a member has not been active in the industry
555280	556640	within the last 10 years,
556640	558400	they will be moved to emeritus status,
558400	561240	meaning they can enjoy all the privileges of membership
561240	563560	except voting on the Oscars,
563560	564720	unless you won an Oscar.
564720	568240	That guarantees you lifetime voting privileges.
568240	571880	Needless to say, some of the olds in the Academy
571880	572960	are not happy about this.
572960	575280	Anyway, they've also pledged to double their minority
575280	577760	slash female membership by 2020,
577760	580000	which may sound like a lot until you remember,
580000	581600	again, this should not be difficult
581600	584120	even if you are trying to match proportion
584120	588120	to the industry's demographics, which are not great.
588120	590160	So you hear that meatloaf?
590160	592640	You better do another movie about truckers
592640	594560	if you want to keep voting.
594560	596440	It is my understanding that you'll do anything
596440	597600	for love, meatloaf.
598800	599800	Will you do that?
