00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
The Oscars are one of those things that we care about because we are told to care about them,

00:05.280 --> 00:08.200
despite the fact that we say we don't care about them,

00:08.200 --> 00:12.960
and then every year we vow not to care about them because they clearly don't reflect our taste,

00:12.960 --> 00:16.920
and then we write big, long think pieces about how irrelevant the Oscars are

00:16.920 --> 00:19.080
and how much we don't care about the Oscars.

00:19.080 --> 00:22.880
So, um, why don't we care about the Oscars?

00:22.880 --> 00:28.160
The general consensus is that it's because the Oscars are less concerned with actual quality

00:28.160 --> 00:31.920
or important movies that further the form of cinema as an art

00:31.920 --> 00:36.520
so much as hitting repetitive and predictable Oscar movie attributes.

00:36.520 --> 00:40.320
Is it character-driven? Does it take place in Hollywood?

00:40.320 --> 00:44.160
Is Meryl Streep in it? Does it involve the Holocaust?

00:44.160 --> 00:47.880
Are the black characters either slaves or beleaguered servants of some sort?

00:47.880 --> 00:49.840
Are the Weinsteins involved?

00:49.840 --> 00:55.280
Is Leonardo DiCaprio performing some form of desperate self-flagellation?

00:55.320 --> 00:57.360
But, here is the thing.

00:57.360 --> 00:59.200
It wasn't always like this.

00:59.200 --> 01:04.280
There didn't used to be a little sub-industry catering to Oscar glory.

01:04.280 --> 01:07.520
When did we start using terms like Oscar bait?

01:07.520 --> 01:14.480
When did best picture go from generally being agreed upon as the most important picture of the year to...

01:14.480 --> 01:15.480
...not?

01:15.480 --> 01:18.160
So, rather than doing a history of the Oscars,

01:18.160 --> 01:22.880
I wanted to look at a history of what type of movie is favored by the Oscars.

01:22.880 --> 01:26.480
Because it wasn't always so predictable.

01:26.480 --> 01:28.800
And the Oscar goes to...

01:28.800 --> 01:33.760
Okay, so first, who is the Academy and how do you get into it anyway?

01:33.760 --> 01:37.200
Well, you win an award or you beg your way in.

01:37.200 --> 01:40.080
And also someone has to sponsor you if you didn't win an award.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.840
It's kind of like being an AA.

01:41.840 --> 01:45.160
For instance, George Lucas, he is not a member of the Academy.

01:45.160 --> 01:50.800
He actually declined membership, but Meatloaf is.

01:50.800 --> 01:54.680
And actually, Meatloaf considers himself a sign of diversity within the Academy.

01:54.680 --> 02:00.960
You know, because War Horse made him cry instead of, like, the artist.

02:00.960 --> 02:04.640
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science was created in 1926

02:04.640 --> 02:08.760
when MGM co-founder Louis B. Mayer and some other studio heads

02:08.760 --> 02:12.200
agreed that they needed a film organization that sounded prestigy

02:12.200 --> 02:14.720
and also preempted the need for unions.

02:14.720 --> 02:17.920
Also, for legitimacy, maybe it should give out awards or something.

02:17.920 --> 02:22.120
As opposed to almost all other film award ceremonies, like the Golden Globes,

02:22.120 --> 02:24.360
which are awarded by the press or critics,

02:24.360 --> 02:28.200
the Academy Awards are voted on by prestige industry people.

02:28.200 --> 02:31.400
And that's why they matter more than other awards.

02:31.400 --> 02:34.240
And also, the Academy is disproportionately made up of actors.

02:34.240 --> 02:37.720
So, if you ever wonder why movies that tend to be contemplative,

02:37.720 --> 02:42.040
dialogue-driven character pieces that take place in Hollywood

02:42.040 --> 02:46.920
are more likely to be nominated slash win than perhaps they deserve,

02:46.920 --> 02:48.240
there you go.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.440
But it wasn't always this way.

02:50.440 --> 02:54.560
As a random for instance, let's look at the 1971 Oscars.

02:54.560 --> 02:56.360
Of the five Best Picture nominees,

02:56.360 --> 03:00.120
four of them had been in the top ten highest-grossing films of that year.

03:00.120 --> 03:03.440
In 1975, three of the five Best Picture nominees

03:03.440 --> 03:05.880
were in the top ten highest-grossing films.

03:05.880 --> 03:08.600
By 1980, that number had dropped to two,

03:08.600 --> 03:11.960
and it kind of stayed at this level until the 2000s.

03:11.960 --> 03:15.000
By 2005, none of the five Best Picture nominees

03:15.040 --> 03:17.920
even cracked the top 20 for domestic gross.

03:17.920 --> 03:21.040
Same for 2006, the year that Crash won Best Picture.

03:21.040 --> 03:25.240
Not one of the Best Picture nominees even cracked the top 20.

03:25.240 --> 03:28.720
Both Star Wars and Jaws were nominated for Best Picture.

03:28.720 --> 03:32.880
But after that, we started to see a slow divergence develop.

03:32.880 --> 03:37.320
The films that most people saw got less and less awards recognition,

03:37.320 --> 03:40.880
and awards recognition was used to boost attendance for smaller films

03:40.880 --> 03:43.200
that people might not have seen otherwise.

03:43.200 --> 03:45.480
There were exceptions.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.720
But in terms of broader nominee trends,

03:48.720 --> 03:50.920
most films started to follow a pattern.

03:50.920 --> 03:54.520
Since the early 2000s, a somewhat predictable algorithm has emerged

03:54.520 --> 03:57.040
for what type of film will get nominated.

03:57.040 --> 04:00.520
Hell, two years before Kate Winslet won her Oscar for Best Actress,

04:00.520 --> 04:03.880
she parodized how she planned on doing it in an episode of Extras.

04:03.880 --> 04:07.080
No, I'm doing it because I've noticed that if you do a film about the Holocaust,

04:07.080 --> 04:08.400
guaranteed an Oscar.

04:08.400 --> 04:11.000
And then two years later, what do you know?

04:11.000 --> 04:14.200
In terms of nominees, there's also a lot of money involved.

04:14.200 --> 04:18.120
Promoting films for awards consideration costs money.

04:18.120 --> 04:21.000
So, could one say that a trend of films being produced

04:21.000 --> 04:24.480
intentionally featuring Oscar movie attributes has emerged?

04:24.480 --> 04:27.920
That producers and studios are essentially gaming the system,

04:27.920 --> 04:30.480
making movies with less attention to quality

04:30.480 --> 04:35.400
than to features that Academy Award voters have shown preference for?

04:35.400 --> 04:38.760
Yes, absolutely. Yes, absolutely.

04:38.760 --> 04:41.560
People harp on Crash, and deservedly so,

04:41.560 --> 04:45.080
but perhaps the most overt recent example of this phenomenon

04:45.080 --> 04:48.280
is 2011's Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,

04:48.280 --> 04:51.120
a movie that nobody saw and nobody liked.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.880
It had its elite property acquisition,

04:53.880 --> 04:57.600
topical subject matter, mentally challenged child,

04:57.600 --> 05:00.880
elite principals, including Academy favorite Tom Hanks,

05:00.880 --> 05:04.200
but this movie got no other major film award nominations

05:04.200 --> 05:07.720
from any other major group except for the Academy.

05:07.720 --> 05:10.680
And it also has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 45%,

05:10.680 --> 05:13.880
the worst score received by any Best Picture nominee

05:13.880 --> 05:15.680
in Rotten Tomatoes history.

05:15.680 --> 05:19.120
Producer Scott Rudin used methods that had worked for him previously

05:19.120 --> 05:21.960
with No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood,

05:21.960 --> 05:24.200
pushed a big four-year consideration campaign

05:24.200 --> 05:26.520
that, yes, cost a lot of money and, what do you know,

05:26.520 --> 05:29.800
Best Picture nomination, you know, for all the good it did.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.200
So when did the studios begin to use the Oscars

05:32.200 --> 05:35.080
as a means of marketing a newly released film

05:35.080 --> 05:37.280
instead of the other way around?

05:37.320 --> 05:38.800
Raaargh!

05:41.640 --> 05:45.160
The Deer Hunter is, well, A, it's really long,

05:45.160 --> 05:47.080
and B, it's really hard to watch.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.400
When the movie was about ready to go,

05:48.400 --> 05:50.560
the filmmakers had dropped a film on the studio

05:50.560 --> 05:54.160
that was a critical darling but near impossible to market.

05:54.160 --> 05:57.360
Hey, everyone, I know the Vietnam War just ended in disgrace

05:57.360 --> 06:01.240
barely three years ago, but wanna watch Robert De Niro

06:01.240 --> 06:04.320
and Christopher Walken suffer horribly for three hours?

06:05.320 --> 06:07.760
So the producers had this great idea of,

06:07.760 --> 06:11.320
hey, let's get in the absolute barest minimum requirement

06:11.320 --> 06:13.320
for Oscar nominations for the following year,

06:13.320 --> 06:15.840
namely a limited release in New York and LA

06:15.840 --> 06:18.000
and also some other minor stuff,

06:18.000 --> 06:19.960
and then go into wide release

06:19.960 --> 06:22.480
after the nominations come out in January.

06:22.480 --> 06:25.520
The winner is Christopher Walken in The Deer Hunter.

06:25.520 --> 06:27.000
And lo and behold, success.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.880
The film won five Academy Awards,

06:28.880 --> 06:32.720
including Best Picture, Director and Supporting Actor for Walken.

06:32.960 --> 06:36.080
And obviously, this did not change the industry overnight,

06:36.080 --> 06:37.640
but over the next 30 years,

06:37.640 --> 06:40.080
strategies like that used with The Deer Hunter

06:40.080 --> 06:42.800
went from outliers to pretty much

06:42.800 --> 06:45.200
all of the Oscar contenders reusing it,

06:45.200 --> 06:47.360
especially in the actor categories.

06:47.360 --> 06:48.520
In the following decades,

06:48.520 --> 06:50.320
the more popular films that made lots of money

06:50.320 --> 06:52.640
became less and less concerned with prestige

06:52.640 --> 06:54.120
and more and more concerned with appealing

06:54.120 --> 06:56.240
to as wide a demographic as possible.

06:56.240 --> 06:57.080
As it turns out,

06:57.080 --> 07:00.160
the masses don't really care about awards all that much.

07:00.160 --> 07:03.560
Why wasn't The Dark Knight nominated for Best Picture?

07:03.560 --> 07:05.080
The normies wondered.

07:05.080 --> 07:07.520
Why was Wali relegated to the ghetto

07:07.520 --> 07:08.920
that his best animated feature

07:08.920 --> 07:11.880
instead of Best Picture like Beauty and the Beast was?

07:11.880 --> 07:14.760
And yeah, this would kind of end up eventually backfiring

07:14.760 --> 07:16.440
because the movies that got nominated

07:16.440 --> 07:18.360
were seen by so few people

07:18.360 --> 07:20.800
in the weeks and months leading up to the Oscars.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.760
And viewership has been on a pretty even keel downward

07:23.760 --> 07:24.760
since the 90s,

07:24.760 --> 07:27.760
bottoming out in 2008 with its lowest ratings ever,

07:27.760 --> 07:29.280
at which point the Academy was like,

07:29.280 --> 07:32.800
yeah, we should probably include some more mainstream fare

07:32.800 --> 07:34.040
in the Best Picture category

07:34.040 --> 07:37.680
because no one is watching our show anymore

07:37.680 --> 07:39.920
and we want to stay relevant.

07:39.920 --> 07:42.120
The last time 10 films were nominated

07:42.120 --> 07:44.680
for Best Picture was 1943.

07:44.680 --> 07:47.720
In 2010, when they upped the Best Picture category

07:47.720 --> 07:50.160
back to 10 as it was in the early days,

07:50.160 --> 07:53.880
we got nominees like District 9 and Avatar,

07:53.880 --> 07:55.800
a flaccid attempt to push back against

07:55.800 --> 07:57.600
the Academy's own internal biases

07:57.640 --> 08:00.920
concerning what is indeed awards-worthy.

08:00.920 --> 08:03.480
That said, it's still mostly been the awards

08:03.480 --> 08:05.520
as marketing movies that get nominated,

08:05.520 --> 08:07.080
especially in the acting categories

08:07.080 --> 08:08.960
with a few mass appeal ones sprinkled in there

08:08.960 --> 08:11.360
for technical awards and Best Picture.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.000
Though the fact that Mad Max Fury Road

08:13.000 --> 08:16.120
was nominated this year for as many awards as it was,

08:16.120 --> 08:17.560
granted mostly technical,

08:17.560 --> 08:20.120
is a minor miracle unto itself.

08:20.120 --> 08:21.560
And I'm honestly kind of surprised

08:21.560 --> 08:23.480
that it was nominated for Best Picture.

08:23.480 --> 08:25.320
So progress, eh.

08:25.320 --> 08:27.760
So moving forward, there has been a lot of talk

08:27.760 --> 08:30.240
about this Oscar bait strategy in recent weeks

08:30.240 --> 08:33.160
and how it ties in with pushes for greater diversity,

08:33.160 --> 08:35.880
especially, again, within the acting categories.

08:35.880 --> 08:38.760
I mean, yeah, it would be great if it was a meritocracy

08:38.760 --> 08:41.400
and yes, these 20 people just happened

08:41.400 --> 08:43.520
to be the best choices that came out this year,

08:43.520 --> 08:46.200
but come on, it's political

08:46.200 --> 08:48.600
and the members of the Academy,

08:48.600 --> 08:52.840
in terms of demographic, are a touch homogenous.

08:52.840 --> 08:54.360
Academy membership is kind of like

08:54.360 --> 08:56.040
being a Supreme Court justice.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.360
It is lifelong and historically it has comprised

08:58.360 --> 09:00.200
mostly of crusty old white guys,

09:00.200 --> 09:03.040
even greater in proportion to the overwhelmingly male,

09:03.040 --> 09:05.680
overwhelmingly white film industry as a whole.

09:05.680 --> 09:08.840
So in a panicked move to outrun total irrelevance,

09:08.840 --> 09:10.800
the Academy has announced that voting rights

09:10.800 --> 09:13.320
will be limited to 10-year cycles.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.280
If a member has not been active in the industry

09:15.280 --> 09:16.640
within the last 10 years,

09:16.640 --> 09:18.400
they will be moved to emeritus status,

09:18.400 --> 09:21.240
meaning they can enjoy all the privileges of membership

09:21.240 --> 09:23.560
except voting on the Oscars,

09:23.560 --> 09:24.720
unless you won an Oscar.

09:24.720 --> 09:28.240
That guarantees you lifetime voting privileges.

09:28.240 --> 09:31.880
Needless to say, some of the olds in the Academy

09:31.880 --> 09:32.960
are not happy about this.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.280
Anyway, they've also pledged to double their minority

09:35.280 --> 09:37.760
slash female membership by 2020,

09:37.760 --> 09:40.000
which may sound like a lot until you remember,

09:40.000 --> 09:41.600
again, this should not be difficult

09:41.600 --> 09:44.120
even if you are trying to match proportion

09:44.120 --> 09:48.120
to the industry's demographics, which are not great.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.160
So you hear that meatloaf?

09:50.160 --> 09:52.640
You better do another movie about truckers

09:52.640 --> 09:54.560
if you want to keep voting.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.440
It is my understanding that you'll do anything

09:56.440 --> 09:57.600
for love, meatloaf.

09:58.800 --> 09:59.800
Will you do that?
