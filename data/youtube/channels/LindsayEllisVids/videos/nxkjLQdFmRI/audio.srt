1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
The Oscars are one of those things that we care about because we are told to care about them,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,200
despite the fact that we say we don't care about them,

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,960
and then every year we vow not to care about them because they clearly don't reflect our taste,

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,920
and then we write big, long think pieces about how irrelevant the Oscars are

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,080
and how much we don't care about the Oscars.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,880
So, um, why don't we care about the Oscars?

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,160
The general consensus is that it's because the Oscars are less concerned with actual quality

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,920
or important movies that further the form of cinema as an art

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,520
so much as hitting repetitive and predictable Oscar movie attributes.

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,320
Is it character-driven? Does it take place in Hollywood?

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,160
Is Meryl Streep in it? Does it involve the Holocaust?

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,880
Are the black characters either slaves or beleaguered servants of some sort?

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,840
Are the Weinsteins involved?

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,280
Is Leonardo DiCaprio performing some form of desperate self-flagellation?

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,360
But, here is the thing.

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,200
It wasn't always like this.

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,280
There didn't used to be a little sub-industry catering to Oscar glory.

18
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,520
When did we start using terms like Oscar bait?

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,480
When did best picture go from generally being agreed upon as the most important picture of the year to...

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,480
...not?

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,160
So, rather than doing a history of the Oscars,

22
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,880
I wanted to look at a history of what type of movie is favored by the Oscars.

23
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,480
Because it wasn't always so predictable.

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,800
And the Oscar goes to...

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,760
Okay, so first, who is the Academy and how do you get into it anyway?

26
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,200
Well, you win an award or you beg your way in.

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,080
And also someone has to sponsor you if you didn't win an award.

28
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,840
It's kind of like being an AA.

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,160
For instance, George Lucas, he is not a member of the Academy.

30
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:50,800
He actually declined membership, but Meatloaf is.

31
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,680
And actually, Meatloaf considers himself a sign of diversity within the Academy.

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,960
You know, because War Horse made him cry instead of, like, the artist.

33
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,640
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science was created in 1926

34
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,760
when MGM co-founder Louis B. Mayer and some other studio heads

35
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,200
agreed that they needed a film organization that sounded prestigy

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,720
and also preempted the need for unions.

37
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,920
Also, for legitimacy, maybe it should give out awards or something.

38
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,120
As opposed to almost all other film award ceremonies, like the Golden Globes,

39
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,360
which are awarded by the press or critics,

40
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,200
the Academy Awards are voted on by prestige industry people.

41
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,400
And that's why they matter more than other awards.

42
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,240
And also, the Academy is disproportionately made up of actors.

43
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,720
So, if you ever wonder why movies that tend to be contemplative,

44
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,040
dialogue-driven character pieces that take place in Hollywood

45
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,920
are more likely to be nominated slash win than perhaps they deserve,

46
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,240
there you go.

47
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,440
But it wasn't always this way.

48
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,560
As a random for instance, let's look at the 1971 Oscars.

49
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,360
Of the five Best Picture nominees,

50
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,120
four of them had been in the top ten highest-grossing films of that year.

51
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,440
In 1975, three of the five Best Picture nominees

52
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,880
were in the top ten highest-grossing films.

53
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,600
By 1980, that number had dropped to two,

54
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,960
and it kind of stayed at this level until the 2000s.

55
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,000
By 2005, none of the five Best Picture nominees

56
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,920
even cracked the top 20 for domestic gross.

57
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,040
Same for 2006, the year that Crash won Best Picture.

58
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,240
Not one of the Best Picture nominees even cracked the top 20.

59
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,720
Both Star Wars and Jaws were nominated for Best Picture.

60
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,880
But after that, we started to see a slow divergence develop.

61
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,320
The films that most people saw got less and less awards recognition,

62
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,880
and awards recognition was used to boost attendance for smaller films

63
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,200
that people might not have seen otherwise.

64
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,480
There were exceptions.

65
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,720
But in terms of broader nominee trends,

66
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,920
most films started to follow a pattern.

67
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,520
Since the early 2000s, a somewhat predictable algorithm has emerged

68
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,040
for what type of film will get nominated.

69
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,520
Hell, two years before Kate Winslet won her Oscar for Best Actress,

70
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,880
she parodized how she planned on doing it in an episode of Extras.

71
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,080
No, I'm doing it because I've noticed that if you do a film about the Holocaust,

72
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,400
guaranteed an Oscar.

73
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,000
And then two years later, what do you know?

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,200
In terms of nominees, there's also a lot of money involved.

75
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,120
Promoting films for awards consideration costs money.

76
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,000
So, could one say that a trend of films being produced

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,480
intentionally featuring Oscar movie attributes has emerged?

78
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,920
That producers and studios are essentially gaming the system,

79
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,480
making movies with less attention to quality

80
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,400
than to features that Academy Award voters have shown preference for?

81
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,760
Yes, absolutely. Yes, absolutely.

82
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,560
People harp on Crash, and deservedly so,

83
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,080
but perhaps the most overt recent example of this phenomenon

84
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,280
is 2011's Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,

85
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,120
a movie that nobody saw and nobody liked.

86
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,880
It had its elite property acquisition,

87
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,600
topical subject matter, mentally challenged child,

88
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,880
elite principals, including Academy favorite Tom Hanks,

89
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,200
but this movie got no other major film award nominations

90
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,720
from any other major group except for the Academy.

91
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,680
And it also has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 45%,

92
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,880
the worst score received by any Best Picture nominee

93
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,680
in Rotten Tomatoes history.

94
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,120
Producer Scott Rudin used methods that had worked for him previously

95
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,960
with No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood,

96
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,200
pushed a big four-year consideration campaign

97
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,520
that, yes, cost a lot of money and, what do you know,

98
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,800
Best Picture nomination, you know, for all the good it did.

99
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,200
So when did the studios begin to use the Oscars

100
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,080
as a means of marketing a newly released film

101
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,280
instead of the other way around?

102
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,800
Raaargh!

103
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,160
The Deer Hunter is, well, A, it's really long,

104
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,080
and B, it's really hard to watch.

105
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,400
When the movie was about ready to go,

106
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,560
the filmmakers had dropped a film on the studio

107
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,160
that was a critical darling but near impossible to market.

108
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,360
Hey, everyone, I know the Vietnam War just ended in disgrace

109
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,240
barely three years ago, but wanna watch Robert De Niro

110
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,320
and Christopher Walken suffer horribly for three hours?

111
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,760
So the producers had this great idea of,

112
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,320
hey, let's get in the absolute barest minimum requirement

113
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,320
for Oscar nominations for the following year,

114
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,840
namely a limited release in New York and LA

115
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,000
and also some other minor stuff,

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,960
and then go into wide release

117
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,480
after the nominations come out in January.

118
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,520
The winner is Christopher Walken in The Deer Hunter.

119
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,000
And lo and behold, success.

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,880
The film won five Academy Awards,

121
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,720
including Best Picture, Director and Supporting Actor for Walken.

122
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,080
And obviously, this did not change the industry overnight,

123
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,640
but over the next 30 years,

124
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,080
strategies like that used with The Deer Hunter

125
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,800
went from outliers to pretty much

126
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,200
all of the Oscar contenders reusing it,

127
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,360
especially in the actor categories.

128
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,520
In the following decades,

129
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,320
the more popular films that made lots of money

130
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,640
became less and less concerned with prestige

131
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,120
and more and more concerned with appealing

132
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,240
to as wide a demographic as possible.

133
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,080
As it turns out,

134
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,160
the masses don't really care about awards all that much.

135
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,560
Why wasn't The Dark Knight nominated for Best Picture?

136
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,080
The normies wondered.

137
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,520
Why was Wali relegated to the ghetto

138
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,920
that his best animated feature

139
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,880
instead of Best Picture like Beauty and the Beast was?

140
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,760
And yeah, this would kind of end up eventually backfiring

141
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,440
because the movies that got nominated

142
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,360
were seen by so few people

143
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,800
in the weeks and months leading up to the Oscars.

144
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,760
And viewership has been on a pretty even keel downward

145
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
since the 90s,

146
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,760
bottoming out in 2008 with its lowest ratings ever,

147
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,280
at which point the Academy was like,

148
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,800
yeah, we should probably include some more mainstream fare

149
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,040
in the Best Picture category

150
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,680
because no one is watching our show anymore

151
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,920
and we want to stay relevant.

152
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,120
The last time 10 films were nominated

153
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,680
for Best Picture was 1943.

154
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,720
In 2010, when they upped the Best Picture category

155
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,160
back to 10 as it was in the early days,

156
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,880
we got nominees like District 9 and Avatar,

157
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,800
a flaccid attempt to push back against

158
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,600
the Academy's own internal biases

159
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,920
concerning what is indeed awards-worthy.

160
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,480
That said, it's still mostly been the awards

161
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,520
as marketing movies that get nominated,

162
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,080
especially in the acting categories

163
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,960
with a few mass appeal ones sprinkled in there

164
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,360
for technical awards and Best Picture.

165
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,000
Though the fact that Mad Max Fury Road

166
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,120
was nominated this year for as many awards as it was,

167
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,560
granted mostly technical,

168
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,120
is a minor miracle unto itself.

169
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,560
And I'm honestly kind of surprised

170
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,480
that it was nominated for Best Picture.

171
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,320
So progress, eh.

172
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,760
So moving forward, there has been a lot of talk

173
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,240
about this Oscar bait strategy in recent weeks

174
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,160
and how it ties in with pushes for greater diversity,

175
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,880
especially, again, within the acting categories.

176
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,760
I mean, yeah, it would be great if it was a meritocracy

177
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,400
and yes, these 20 people just happened

178
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,520
to be the best choices that came out this year,

179
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,200
but come on, it's political

180
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,600
and the members of the Academy,

181
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,840
in terms of demographic, are a touch homogenous.

182
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,360
Academy membership is kind of like

183
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,040
being a Supreme Court justice.

184
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,360
It is lifelong and historically it has comprised

185
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,200
mostly of crusty old white guys,

186
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,040
even greater in proportion to the overwhelmingly male,

187
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,680
overwhelmingly white film industry as a whole.

188
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,840
So in a panicked move to outrun total irrelevance,

189
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,800
the Academy has announced that voting rights

190
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,320
will be limited to 10-year cycles.

191
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,280
If a member has not been active in the industry

192
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,640
within the last 10 years,

193
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,400
they will be moved to emeritus status,

194
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,240
meaning they can enjoy all the privileges of membership

195
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,560
except voting on the Oscars,

196
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,720
unless you won an Oscar.

197
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,240
That guarantees you lifetime voting privileges.

198
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,880
Needless to say, some of the olds in the Academy

199
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,960
are not happy about this.

200
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,280
Anyway, they've also pledged to double their minority

201
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,760
slash female membership by 2020,

202
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,000
which may sound like a lot until you remember,

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,600
again, this should not be difficult

204
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,120
even if you are trying to match proportion

205
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,120
to the industry's demographics, which are not great.

206
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,160
So you hear that meatloaf?

207
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,640
You better do another movie about truckers

208
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,560
if you want to keep voting.

209
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,440
It is my understanding that you'll do anything

210
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,600
for love, meatloaf.

211
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
Will you do that?
