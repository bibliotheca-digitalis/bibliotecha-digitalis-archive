1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Well, before we make our bad life decisions, uh, I think you need to top me off.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,500
Oh, yeah.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What's, uh, what's up with the dirndl today?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,500
Oh, I was feeling, uh, like Bavarian today.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,500
Uh, you should save that for the cultural appropriation episode.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,500
Yeah, I thought of that.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But Germans don't count.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I think almost the frustrating thing about, like, all these comments is, like,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
since we pick a theme for each episode, uh, we can't, like, you know,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
we're trying to save, like, oh, we'll do this comment next week, or, like,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
when people write out scenes, we'll do stuff with the scenes later, I promise.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Oh, God, yeah, we're saving each and every scene.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yeah, we're saving the scenes, but right now we're gonna try and focus,

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
because this week we're gonna try and hammer down what the plot is,

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,500
so we can move on and actually start cobbling together our project, like, for realsies.

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,500
And who are the characters that act in this plot? Very important.

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,500
Piscasaurus clarified, first off, that the Cthulhu mythos as a concept,

19
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,500
not any of the gaming or anything, but the Cthulhu mythos as an intellectual property

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,500
is public domain, so we're good.

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,500
Holla!

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Second, the misconception about the mythos.

23
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,500
The overarching theme is not that the universe is malevolent,

24
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,500
just that it is apathetic to us because we do not matter that much.

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500
All the more for us to shit on.

26
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Yeah.

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Woohoo!

28
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,500
Um, shall we start with the villain?

29
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,500
So, what we were getting a lot of was that it should be a cult.

30
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,500
It should be a cult of man, you know, Cthulhu worshipping a cultist.

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Well, we got a lot of this.

32
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,500
Like, we had, I think, the thing we had the most re-villain was cultists.

33
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,500
And so, there was that.

34
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,500
But I think also, like, the idea that they're not Cthulhu cultists, but Azathoth cultists.

35
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Yes.

36
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Who's, like, a bigger man.

37
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,500
Sarah Desnes points out that the main antagonist should be female.

38
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,500
That you can use as contrast to the female protagonist.

39
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Then you can use these comparisons to make antagonists look even worse

40
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,500
and female protagonists to look even better.

41
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,500
For instance, the antagonist could dislike children,

42
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,500
while the protagonist wants to be a mother.

43
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,500
So, you know, the antagonist is mean and heartless.

44
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,500
She hates love.

45
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Maybe an inability to find or keep love could be what motivates her.

46
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,500
Yeah.

47
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,500
And also, the best part about having a female antagonist

48
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,500
is that it makes it easier for the female reader to hate her.

49
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,500
Yeah, and we can hate her too.

50
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,500
Because women hate women.

51
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,500
Am I right?

52
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,500
Am I right?

53
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,500
You bitch.

54
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
You whore.

55
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
While on the subject of the antagonist,

56
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Christopher Emmett suggests that the Indian third wheel

57
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,500
actually becomes sort of an antagonist

58
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
by falling in with these evil cultists

59
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,500
and using the Nectric Namakon to banish the Eldritch Abomination.

60
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
My idea after that was that he gets brainwashed,

61
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
so there's no accountability.

62
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,500
So he's still like the good ethnic third wheel,

63
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
but he's been brainwashed by the evil cultists

64
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
and that becomes part of the plot.

65
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,500
She wants to save him.

66
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,500
Because they're friends.

67
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Because they're friends.

68
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,500
He's like her best friend.

69
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,500
They're besties.

70
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
She would never be able to live without him.

71
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,500
They've known each other since the beginning of junior year.

72
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Yeah.

73
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Moving on to family.

74
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,500
I've been liking some things that have been thrown out

75
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,500
that the parents should be scientists.

76
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,500
I was seeing suggestions for should be an archaeologist.

77
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Thomas de Grote mentioned that one of the parents

78
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,500
should be a marine biologist.

79
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
So it's kind of both.

80
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
I'm thinking that the father should be the marine biologist

81
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
and the mother the archaeologist.

82
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
The mother goes off on a dig.

83
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
Everyone thinks she's a little crazy, though.

84
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Yeah.

85
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
Well, Elizabeth Smith suggests that

86
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
rather than just doing search and replace versions

87
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
of the parents of Twilight,

88
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,500
they're not divorced.

89
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Rather, flighty mother is flighty

90
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,500
because she keeps running off for archaeology things.

91
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
So that's a good starting place with the parents.

92
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,500
Regarding the purity of our Lego brick.

93
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
This one is difficult

94
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,500
because it's really hard to define a character

95
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
without giving them any real definition

96
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,500
so that literally anyone, any white woman,

97
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
can pretend to be them.

98
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,500
Pavel Marek gave us one that I really liked.

99
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
And this came in the form of a scene

100
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,500
where our bitchy best friend, or a bitchy friend,

101
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,500
says or does something nasty to Bella.

102
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,500
And Cthulhu puts her in the hospital

103
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
in some way, shape, or form.

104
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,500
I did it. He started.

105
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
For you.

106
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Then the problem will not be spoken of again.

107
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,500
The bitchy girl may or may not be

108
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,500
mentally debilitated forever and ever.

109
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Bella will never question

110
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
that maybe she shouldn't be with this person

111
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
because of their Austen power.

112
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
No.

113
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,500
His devotion.

114
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,500
He loves her so much.

115
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,500
He can't help himself.

116
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
I enjoyed Catherine Rose's suggestion

117
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
that maybe Bella should have suffered

118
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
from night terrors from the time she was little

119
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
because of her being the only one

120
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
to perceive the real universe in her dreams.

121
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
I like this a lot.

122
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
She has a secret, unknown pain

123
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,500
and her parents were like,

124
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
well I haven't grown out of it yet,

125
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,500
so she keeps it to herself

126
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
because she's a teenager now.

127
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
She shouldn't be waking up for her nightmares anymore.

128
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
She just pretends it's not a thing.

129
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,500
And that's the second book of Twilight,

130
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
in that four months where she's waking up

131
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
with nightmares every single night

132
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
and Charlie just gives up on getting the shit.

133
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
As parents do.

134
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
As parents do, because it's like,

135
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
you're not dying.

136
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
They'll get over it, right?

137
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
Ghost Riddle Word reminds us that

138
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Edward has to save Bella,

139
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,500
so Lego brick needs to be saved

140
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
from rape.

141
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
No less than two, maybe three times.

142
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
Three times.

143
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Bless you, you signed into Yahoo

144
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,500
just as me.

145
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
You mentioned that,

146
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
me mentioned that

147
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
I like the idea of her being an artist

148
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,500
who works to get inspired by Cthulhu.

149
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
Now that gives her a little too much agency.

150
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
However, what we came up with

151
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
is that she does create

152
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
these artistic works

153
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
in a dream state.

154
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
Sort of like Shia in Transformers 2.

155
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
Just all of a sudden one day,

156
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
all these amazing abilities,

157
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
through no effort or agency of her own.

158
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
She never has to work for it,

159
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
it just happens to her one day.

160
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
So she's not actually an artist,

161
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,500
she's just a conduit for all these images

162
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,500
that control her.

163
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
And when she wakes up it's like,

164
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
but I can't even draw stick figures.

165
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Anastasia Beaverhausen also suggests

166
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
that she needs a flaw that isn't really a flaw.

167
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Like, she's too kind.

168
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
She's too nice,

169
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
and this only manifests

170
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
in the first person prose.

171
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
And Max Phillips also suggests

172
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
that Unbella throws around

173
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,500
the phrase beautiful insanity

174
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
every 15 pages or so.

175
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
I like that, it's so artistic.

176
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
Alexandria Lundelius points out

177
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
she was suggesting that the protagonist

178
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
should be an arts crafter,

179
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
like arts and crafts.

180
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
I think that should be her best friend,

181
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
like the fat one.

182
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
The fat best friend comes from

183
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
a Twilight knockoff called Hush Hush,

184
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
which is Twilight with fallen angels.

185
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,500
And the fat best friend is

186
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
real big in that one,

187
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
because, well, it's real big.

188
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,500
She eats.

189
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Ideal women don't eat.

190
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
We don't need to.

191
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
We just drink.

192
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Yeah.

193
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Calories.

194
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
My life is hard.

195
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
And the thing about our Bella or Anna

196
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
is that

197
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
it's this that bitch lover.

198
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
I hate her guts,

199
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
but she's the greatest.

200
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
Gee, I wonder what she's doing,

201
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
that whore.

202
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
There has to be that judge love

203
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
that goes on in a teenage girl's mind

204
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
that is awful, totally awful,

205
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
and absolutely happens in real life.

206
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
But when you actually read it in a book,

207
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
it's the most heinous thing in the world.

208
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
Joe Drake's suggestion that we could have

209
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
just metaphors, like,

210
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,500
he was my totem, the altar, I wanted to worship that.

211
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
The cross I needed to kneel before

212
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,500
more than I had ever needed anything before.

213
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
At night in the mornings, on the walk home

214
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
from school, I would find myself whispering

215
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
little prayers to him.

216
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
To go into our, in using

217
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
great works of art,

218
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
to sort of

219
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
lead our stories without actually

220
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,500
influencing them. Genesis,

221
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
I'm looking at you. He suggests

222
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
we just go T.S. Eliot

223
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
The Hollow Men.

224
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
This is the way the world ends.

225
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
This is the way the world ends.

226
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Not with a bang,

227
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
but a whimper.

228
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
So deep.

229
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,500
So deep. That's the beginning of our book

230
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
that we will never actually reference again.

231
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Debra Elaine suggests that for

232
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
like a Briggs family, how about a father who's

233
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,500
spoken of as controlling, but never actually

234
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,500
does anything controlling.

235
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
She hates him for a stupid, possibly unexplained

236
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
reason. Do you want to explain

237
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
informed attributes

238
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
to those playing the home game?

239
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,500
So the idea of the informed attribute,

240
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
as many of our various

241
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Duke commenters commented,

242
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
is that you bring something up,

243
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
you define a character

244
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
in the tell, don't

245
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
show sort of way,

246
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
and then never follow up on

247
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
it in any meaningful way, especially

248
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
in any meaningful way to the plot.

249
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
The important thing is the perception

250
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
of the reader.

251
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
My best friend is a bitch.

252
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Best friend never does anything

253
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
bitchy. My father is

254
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
controlling. Father never does

255
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
anything controlling.

256
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Cthulhu sets my spirit

257
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
free. Cthulhu controls

258
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
the shit out of her.

259
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
So on and so forth.

260
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
So what have we decided about our plot?

261
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Well, I think the plot begins

262
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
with... In some way, shape,

263
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
or form, ethnic third wheels

264
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
family has the Necronomicon, right?

265
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Yes. Somehow or other,

266
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
ethnic third wheel and

267
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Lego brick read from

268
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
the Necronomicon, thereby

269
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
summoning the great old one.

270
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Third wheel's

271
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
character development is he has

272
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
the Necronomicon, he's in love with her,

273
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
she meets the bad guy,

274
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
or the bad boy.

275
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
Third wheel gets shoved

276
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
aside, but he knows

277
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
that bad boy is the bad boy.

278
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
Okay. Proceed with like

279
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,500
20 scenes of them staring into each other's eyes

280
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
meaningfully. And also like the

281
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
what are you? I can't tell you.

282
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
No tell me. I can't tell you.

283
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,500
No one would believe you. I can't tell you.

284
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Meanwhile, ethnic third wheel

285
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
knows what's going on.

286
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,500
So when eventually he becomes fed up,

287
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
he goes to the cultists,

288
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
gets brainwashed,

289
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
and we go to our third act,

290
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
which is effectively love saves the world.

291
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
That's our book.

292
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
So that's our basic

293
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
outline. Next week, with your

294
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
comments and help, we will

295
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
come up with a more concrete

296
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
outline.

297
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,500
But,

298
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
the big things that we need to start

299
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
thinking out are, what are

300
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
the names of all of these characters?

301
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
What is Lego Brick's name?

302
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
I really want to call her Blanche

303
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Slate, but obviously that's a little too obvious.

304
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
No, my idea was that

305
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
her name is Tabitha

306
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,500
Louise Rasa. So we need

307
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
to find the names for

308
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Ethnic Third Wheel, for Cthulhu

309
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
as boy,

310
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
and

311
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
for, of course

312
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
Lego Brick. Like I say, the Carlisle

313
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
is Uncle Neil, and he is

314
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Neil. You're also a tip. Exactly.

315
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Needs to happen.

316
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
I will hold on to this until my dying day.

317
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Moreover,

318
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
we need to figure out

319
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
what our

320
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
pen name is.

321
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Start throwing us ideas of

322
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
not only what our pen name could be,

323
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
but what the project name could be.

324
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Alright! And our title for the book!

325
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
And our title for the book!

326
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,500
Start throwing us names for things for our Carlisles,

327
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,500
our supporting characters, our bitchy best friend,

328
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
our Lego Brick,

329
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
the mother, the father, the title

330
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
of the book, and of course our pen name.

331
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
Do all this

332
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
tweet at us, at Chez Apocalypse.

333
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,500
So after I finish this drink,

334
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
all my bad life choices come to fruition, right?

335
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
No!

336
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
Because we framed them as good.
