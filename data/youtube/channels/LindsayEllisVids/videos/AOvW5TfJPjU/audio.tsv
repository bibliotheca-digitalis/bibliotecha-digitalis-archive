0	4500	Well, before we make our bad life decisions, uh, I think you need to top me off.
4500	5500	Oh, yeah.
6000	8000	What's, uh, what's up with the dirndl today?
8000	11500	Oh, I was feeling, uh, like Bavarian today.
11500	12000	Oh.
12000	15500	Uh, you should save that for the cultural appropriation episode.
15500	17500	Yeah, I thought of that.
18000	20000	But Germans don't count.
24000	28000	I think almost the frustrating thing about, like, all these comments is, like,
28000	33000	since we pick a theme for each episode, uh, we can't, like, you know,
33000	36000	we're trying to save, like, oh, we'll do this comment next week, or, like,
36000	40000	when people write out scenes, we'll do stuff with the scenes later, I promise.
40000	42000	Oh, God, yeah, we're saving each and every scene.
42000	45000	Yeah, we're saving the scenes, but right now we're gonna try and focus,
45000	51000	because this week we're gonna try and hammer down what the plot is,
51000	56500	so we can move on and actually start cobbling together our project, like, for realsies.
56500	59500	And who are the characters that act in this plot? Very important.
59500	63500	Piscasaurus clarified, first off, that the Cthulhu mythos as a concept,
63500	68500	not any of the gaming or anything, but the Cthulhu mythos as an intellectual property
68500	70500	is public domain, so we're good.
70500	71500	Holla!
71500	73500	Second, the misconception about the mythos.
73500	76500	The overarching theme is not that the universe is malevolent,
76500	81500	just that it is apathetic to us because we do not matter that much.
81500	83500	All the more for us to shit on.
83500	84500	Yeah.
84500	85500	Woohoo!
85500	87500	Um, shall we start with the villain?
87500	91500	So, what we were getting a lot of was that it should be a cult.
91500	94500	It should be a cult of man, you know, Cthulhu worshipping a cultist.
94500	96500	Well, we got a lot of this.
96500	101500	Like, we had, I think, the thing we had the most re-villain was cultists.
101500	104500	And so, there was that.
104500	108500	But I think also, like, the idea that they're not Cthulhu cultists, but Azathoth cultists.
108500	109500	Yes.
109500	111500	Who's, like, a bigger man.
111500	115500	Sarah Desnes points out that the main antagonist should be female.
115500	117500	That you can use as contrast to the female protagonist.
117500	120500	Then you can use these comparisons to make antagonists look even worse
120500	123500	and female protagonists to look even better.
123500	125500	For instance, the antagonist could dislike children,
125500	128500	while the protagonist wants to be a mother.
128500	131500	So, you know, the antagonist is mean and heartless.
131500	133500	She hates love.
133500	136500	Maybe an inability to find or keep love could be what motivates her.
136500	137500	Yeah.
137500	140500	And also, the best part about having a female antagonist
140500	143500	is that it makes it easier for the female reader to hate her.
143500	145500	Yeah, and we can hate her too.
145500	147500	Because women hate women.
147500	148500	Am I right?
148500	149500	Am I right?
149500	150500	You bitch.
150500	151500	You whore.
151500	153500	While on the subject of the antagonist,
153500	157500	Christopher Emmett suggests that the Indian third wheel
157500	160500	actually becomes sort of an antagonist
160500	162500	by falling in with these evil cultists
162500	166500	and using the Nectric Namakon to banish the Eldritch Abomination.
166500	168500	My idea after that was that he gets brainwashed,
168500	170500	so there's no accountability.
170500	173500	So he's still like the good ethnic third wheel,
173500	175500	but he's been brainwashed by the evil cultists
175500	177500	and that becomes part of the plot.
177500	178500	She wants to save him.
178500	179500	Because they're friends.
179500	180500	Because they're friends.
180500	181500	He's like her best friend.
181500	182500	They're besties.
182500	183500	She would never be able to live without him.
183500	186500	They've known each other since the beginning of junior year.
186500	187500	Yeah.
187500	188500	Moving on to family.
188500	191500	I've been liking some things that have been thrown out
191500	194500	that the parents should be scientists.
194500	198500	I was seeing suggestions for should be an archaeologist.
198500	201500	Thomas de Grote mentioned that one of the parents
201500	203500	should be a marine biologist.
203500	205500	So it's kind of both.
205500	207500	I'm thinking that the father should be the marine biologist
207500	209500	and the mother the archaeologist.
209500	211500	The mother goes off on a dig.
211500	213500	Everyone thinks she's a little crazy, though.
213500	214500	Yeah.
214500	216500	Well, Elizabeth Smith suggests that
216500	218500	rather than just doing search and replace versions
218500	219500	of the parents of Twilight,
219500	220500	they're not divorced.
220500	222500	Rather, flighty mother is flighty
222500	225500	because she keeps running off for archaeology things.
225500	227500	So that's a good starting place with the parents.
227500	230500	Regarding the purity of our Lego brick.
230500	231500	This one is difficult
231500	234500	because it's really hard to define a character
234500	236500	without giving them any real definition
236500	238500	so that literally anyone, any white woman,
238500	240500	can pretend to be them.
240500	243500	Pavel Marek gave us one that I really liked.
243500	245500	And this came in the form of a scene
246500	249500	where our bitchy best friend, or a bitchy friend,
249500	252500	says or does something nasty to Bella.
252500	254500	And Cthulhu puts her in the hospital
254500	256500	in some way, shape, or form.
256500	258500	I did it. He started.
258500	260500	For you.
260500	263500	Then the problem will not be spoken of again.
263500	265500	The bitchy girl may or may not be
265500	268500	mentally debilitated forever and ever.
268500	270500	Bella will never question
270500	272500	that maybe she shouldn't be with this person
272500	274500	because of their Austen power.
274500	275500	No.
275500	276500	His devotion.
276500	278500	He loves her so much.
278500	280500	He can't help himself.
280500	282500	I enjoyed Catherine Rose's suggestion
282500	284500	that maybe Bella should have suffered
284500	286500	from night terrors from the time she was little
286500	288500	because of her being the only one
288500	290500	to perceive the real universe in her dreams.
290500	292500	I like this a lot.
292500	294500	She has a secret, unknown pain
294500	295500	and her parents were like,
295500	297500	well I haven't grown out of it yet,
297500	298500	so she keeps it to herself
298500	300500	because she's a teenager now.
300500	302500	She shouldn't be waking up for her nightmares anymore.
302500	304500	She just pretends it's not a thing.
304500	306500	And that's the second book of Twilight,
306500	308500	in that four months where she's waking up
308500	310500	with nightmares every single night
310500	312500	and Charlie just gives up on getting the shit.
312500	314500	As parents do.
314500	316500	As parents do, because it's like,
316500	317500	you're not dying.
317500	319500	They'll get over it, right?
319500	321500	Ghost Riddle Word reminds us that
321500	324500	Edward has to save Bella,
324500	328500	so Lego brick needs to be saved
328500	330500	from rape.
330500	332500	No less than two, maybe three times.
332500	333500	Three times.
333500	335500	Bless you, you signed into Yahoo
335500	337500	just as me.
339500	341500	You mentioned that,
341500	343500	me mentioned that
343500	345500	I like the idea of her being an artist
345500	347500	who works to get inspired by Cthulhu.
347500	349500	Now that gives her a little too much agency.
349500	351500	However, what we came up with
351500	353500	is that she does create
353500	355500	these artistic works
355500	357500	in a dream state.
357500	359500	Sort of like Shia in Transformers 2.
360500	362500	Just all of a sudden one day,
362500	364500	all these amazing abilities,
364500	366500	through no effort or agency of her own.
366500	368500	She never has to work for it,
368500	370500	it just happens to her one day.
370500	372500	So she's not actually an artist,
372500	374500	she's just a conduit for all these images
374500	376500	that control her.
376500	378500	And when she wakes up it's like,
378500	380500	but I can't even draw stick figures.
380500	382500	Anastasia Beaverhausen also suggests
382500	384500	that she needs a flaw that isn't really a flaw.
384500	386500	Like, she's too kind.
386500	388500	She's too nice,
388500	390500	and this only manifests
390500	392500	in the first person prose.
394500	396500	And Max Phillips also suggests
396500	398500	that Unbella throws around
398500	400500	the phrase beautiful insanity
400500	402500	every 15 pages or so.
402500	404500	I like that, it's so artistic.
404500	406500	Alexandria Lundelius points out
406500	408500	she was suggesting that the protagonist
408500	410500	should be an arts crafter,
410500	412500	like arts and crafts.
412500	414500	I think that should be her best friend,
414500	416500	like the fat one.
416500	418500	The fat best friend comes from
418500	420500	a Twilight knockoff called Hush Hush,
420500	422500	which is Twilight with fallen angels.
422500	424500	And the fat best friend is
424500	426500	real big in that one,
426500	428500	because, well, it's real big.
428500	430500	She eats.
430500	432500	Ideal women don't eat.
432500	434500	We don't need to.
434500	436500	We just drink.
436500	438500	Yeah.
438500	440500	Calories.
440500	442500	My life is hard.
442500	444500	And the thing about our Bella or Anna
444500	446500	is that
446500	448500	it's this that bitch lover.
450500	452500	I hate her guts,
452500	454500	but she's the greatest.
454500	456500	Gee, I wonder what she's doing,
456500	458500	that whore.
458500	460500	There has to be that judge love
460500	462500	that goes on in a teenage girl's mind
462500	464500	that is awful, totally awful,
464500	466500	and absolutely happens in real life.
466500	468500	But when you actually read it in a book,
468500	470500	it's the most heinous thing in the world.
470500	472500	Joe Drake's suggestion that we could have
472500	474500	just metaphors, like,
474500	476500	he was my totem, the altar, I wanted to worship that.
476500	478500	The cross I needed to kneel before
478500	480500	more than I had ever needed anything before.
480500	482500	At night in the mornings, on the walk home
482500	484500	from school, I would find myself whispering
484500	486500	little prayers to him.
486500	488500	To go into our, in using
488500	490500	great works of art,
490500	492500	to sort of
492500	494500	lead our stories without actually
494500	496500	influencing them. Genesis,
496500	498500	I'm looking at you. He suggests
498500	500500	we just go T.S. Eliot
500500	502500	The Hollow Men.
502500	504500	This is the way the world ends.
504500	506500	This is the way the world ends.
506500	508500	Not with a bang,
508500	510500	but a whimper.
510500	512500	So deep.
512500	514500	So deep. That's the beginning of our book
514500	516500	that we will never actually reference again.
516500	518500	Debra Elaine suggests that for
518500	520500	like a Briggs family, how about a father who's
520500	522500	spoken of as controlling, but never actually
522500	524500	does anything controlling.
524500	526500	She hates him for a stupid, possibly unexplained
526500	528500	reason. Do you want to explain
528500	530500	informed attributes
530500	532500	to those playing the home game?
532500	534500	So the idea of the informed attribute,
534500	536500	as many of our various
536500	538500	Duke commenters commented,
538500	540500	is that you bring something up,
540500	542500	you define a character
542500	544500	in the tell, don't
544500	546500	show sort of way,
546500	548500	and then never follow up on
548500	550500	it in any meaningful way, especially
550500	552500	in any meaningful way to the plot.
552500	554500	The important thing is the perception
554500	556500	of the reader.
556500	558500	My best friend is a bitch.
558500	560500	Best friend never does anything
560500	562500	bitchy. My father is
562500	564500	controlling. Father never does
564500	566500	anything controlling.
566500	568500	Cthulhu sets my spirit
568500	570500	free. Cthulhu controls
570500	572500	the shit out of her.
572500	574500	So on and so forth.
574500	576500	So what have we decided about our plot?
576500	578500	Well, I think the plot begins
578500	580500	with... In some way, shape,
580500	582500	or form, ethnic third wheels
582500	584500	family has the Necronomicon, right?
584500	586500	Yes. Somehow or other,
586500	588500	ethnic third wheel and
588500	590500	Lego brick read from
590500	592500	the Necronomicon, thereby
592500	594500	summoning the great old one.
594500	596500	Third wheel's
596500	598500	character development is he has
598500	600500	the Necronomicon, he's in love with her,
600500	602500	she meets the bad guy,
602500	604500	or the bad boy.
604500	606500	Third wheel gets shoved
606500	608500	aside, but he knows
608500	610500	that bad boy is the bad boy.
610500	612500	Okay. Proceed with like
612500	614500	20 scenes of them staring into each other's eyes
614500	616500	meaningfully. And also like the
616500	618500	what are you? I can't tell you.
618500	620500	No tell me. I can't tell you.
620500	622500	No one would believe you. I can't tell you.
622500	624500	Meanwhile, ethnic third wheel
624500	626500	knows what's going on.
626500	628500	So when eventually he becomes fed up,
628500	630500	he goes to the cultists,
630500	632500	gets brainwashed,
632500	634500	and we go to our third act,
634500	636500	which is effectively love saves the world.
636500	638500	That's our book.
638500	640500	So that's our basic
640500	642500	outline. Next week, with your
642500	644500	comments and help, we will
644500	646500	come up with a more concrete
646500	648500	outline.
648500	650500	But,
650500	652500	the big things that we need to start
652500	654500	thinking out are, what are
654500	656500	the names of all of these characters?
656500	658500	What is Lego Brick's name?
658500	660500	I really want to call her Blanche
660500	662500	Slate, but obviously that's a little too obvious.
662500	664500	No, my idea was that
664500	666500	her name is Tabitha
666500	668500	Louise Rasa. So we need
668500	670500	to find the names for
670500	672500	Ethnic Third Wheel, for Cthulhu
672500	674500	as boy,
674500	676500	and
676500	678500	for, of course
678500	680500	Lego Brick. Like I say, the Carlisle
680500	682500	is Uncle Neil, and he is
682500	684500	Neil. You're also a tip. Exactly.
684500	686500	Needs to happen.
686500	688500	I will hold on to this until my dying day.
688500	690500	Moreover,
690500	692500	we need to figure out
692500	694500	what our
694500	696500	pen name is.
696500	698500	Start throwing us ideas of
698500	700500	not only what our pen name could be,
700500	702500	but what the project name could be.
702500	704500	Alright! And our title for the book!
704500	706500	And our title for the book!
706500	708500	Start throwing us names for things for our Carlisles,
708500	710500	our supporting characters, our bitchy best friend,
710500	712500	our Lego Brick,
712500	714500	the mother, the father, the title
714500	716500	of the book, and of course our pen name.
716500	718500	Do all this
718500	720500	tweet at us, at Chez Apocalypse.
720500	722500	So after I finish this drink,
722500	724500	all my bad life choices come to fruition, right?
