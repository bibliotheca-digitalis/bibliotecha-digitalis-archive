WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.500
Well, before we make our bad life decisions, uh, I think you need to top me off.

00:04.500 --> 00:05.500
Oh, yeah.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
What's, uh, what's up with the dirndl today?

00:08.000 --> 00:11.500
Oh, I was feeling, uh, like Bavarian today.

00:11.500 --> 00:12.000
Oh.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.500
Uh, you should save that for the cultural appropriation episode.

00:15.500 --> 00:17.500
Yeah, I thought of that.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
But Germans don't count.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
I think almost the frustrating thing about, like, all these comments is, like,

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
since we pick a theme for each episode, uh, we can't, like, you know,

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
we're trying to save, like, oh, we'll do this comment next week, or, like,

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
when people write out scenes, we'll do stuff with the scenes later, I promise.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Oh, God, yeah, we're saving each and every scene.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Yeah, we're saving the scenes, but right now we're gonna try and focus,

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
because this week we're gonna try and hammer down what the plot is,

00:51.000 --> 00:56.500
so we can move on and actually start cobbling together our project, like, for realsies.

00:56.500 --> 00:59.500
And who are the characters that act in this plot? Very important.

00:59.500 --> 01:03.500
Piscasaurus clarified, first off, that the Cthulhu mythos as a concept,

01:03.500 --> 01:08.500
not any of the gaming or anything, but the Cthulhu mythos as an intellectual property

01:08.500 --> 01:10.500
is public domain, so we're good.

01:10.500 --> 01:11.500
Holla!

01:11.500 --> 01:13.500
Second, the misconception about the mythos.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.500
The overarching theme is not that the universe is malevolent,

01:16.500 --> 01:21.500
just that it is apathetic to us because we do not matter that much.

01:21.500 --> 01:23.500
All the more for us to shit on.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.500
Yeah.

01:24.500 --> 01:25.500
Woohoo!

01:25.500 --> 01:27.500
Um, shall we start with the villain?

01:27.500 --> 01:31.500
So, what we were getting a lot of was that it should be a cult.

01:31.500 --> 01:34.500
It should be a cult of man, you know, Cthulhu worshipping a cultist.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.500
Well, we got a lot of this.

01:36.500 --> 01:41.500
Like, we had, I think, the thing we had the most re-villain was cultists.

01:41.500 --> 01:44.500
And so, there was that.

01:44.500 --> 01:48.500
But I think also, like, the idea that they're not Cthulhu cultists, but Azathoth cultists.

01:48.500 --> 01:49.500
Yes.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.500
Who's, like, a bigger man.

01:51.500 --> 01:55.500
Sarah Desnes points out that the main antagonist should be female.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.500
That you can use as contrast to the female protagonist.

01:57.500 --> 02:00.500
Then you can use these comparisons to make antagonists look even worse

02:00.500 --> 02:03.500
and female protagonists to look even better.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.500
For instance, the antagonist could dislike children,

02:05.500 --> 02:08.500
while the protagonist wants to be a mother.

02:08.500 --> 02:11.500
So, you know, the antagonist is mean and heartless.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.500
She hates love.

02:13.500 --> 02:16.500
Maybe an inability to find or keep love could be what motivates her.

02:16.500 --> 02:17.500
Yeah.

02:17.500 --> 02:20.500
And also, the best part about having a female antagonist

02:20.500 --> 02:23.500
is that it makes it easier for the female reader to hate her.

02:23.500 --> 02:25.500
Yeah, and we can hate her too.

02:25.500 --> 02:27.500
Because women hate women.

02:27.500 --> 02:28.500
Am I right?

02:28.500 --> 02:29.500
Am I right?

02:29.500 --> 02:30.500
You bitch.

02:30.500 --> 02:31.500
You whore.

02:31.500 --> 02:33.500
While on the subject of the antagonist,

02:33.500 --> 02:37.500
Christopher Emmett suggests that the Indian third wheel

02:37.500 --> 02:40.500
actually becomes sort of an antagonist

02:40.500 --> 02:42.500
by falling in with these evil cultists

02:42.500 --> 02:46.500
and using the Nectric Namakon to banish the Eldritch Abomination.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.500
My idea after that was that he gets brainwashed,

02:48.500 --> 02:50.500
so there's no accountability.

02:50.500 --> 02:53.500
So he's still like the good ethnic third wheel,

02:53.500 --> 02:55.500
but he's been brainwashed by the evil cultists

02:55.500 --> 02:57.500
and that becomes part of the plot.

02:57.500 --> 02:58.500
She wants to save him.

02:58.500 --> 02:59.500
Because they're friends.

02:59.500 --> 03:00.500
Because they're friends.

03:00.500 --> 03:01.500
He's like her best friend.

03:01.500 --> 03:02.500
They're besties.

03:02.500 --> 03:03.500
She would never be able to live without him.

03:03.500 --> 03:06.500
They've known each other since the beginning of junior year.

03:06.500 --> 03:07.500
Yeah.

03:07.500 --> 03:08.500
Moving on to family.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.500
I've been liking some things that have been thrown out

03:11.500 --> 03:14.500
that the parents should be scientists.

03:14.500 --> 03:18.500
I was seeing suggestions for should be an archaeologist.

03:18.500 --> 03:21.500
Thomas de Grote mentioned that one of the parents

03:21.500 --> 03:23.500
should be a marine biologist.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.500
So it's kind of both.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.500
I'm thinking that the father should be the marine biologist

03:27.500 --> 03:29.500
and the mother the archaeologist.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.500
The mother goes off on a dig.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.500
Everyone thinks she's a little crazy, though.

03:33.500 --> 03:34.500
Yeah.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.500
Well, Elizabeth Smith suggests that

03:36.500 --> 03:38.500
rather than just doing search and replace versions

03:38.500 --> 03:39.500
of the parents of Twilight,

03:39.500 --> 03:40.500
they're not divorced.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.500
Rather, flighty mother is flighty

03:42.500 --> 03:45.500
because she keeps running off for archaeology things.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.500
So that's a good starting place with the parents.

03:47.500 --> 03:50.500
Regarding the purity of our Lego brick.

03:50.500 --> 03:51.500
This one is difficult

03:51.500 --> 03:54.500
because it's really hard to define a character

03:54.500 --> 03:56.500
without giving them any real definition

03:56.500 --> 03:58.500
so that literally anyone, any white woman,

03:58.500 --> 04:00.500
can pretend to be them.

04:00.500 --> 04:03.500
Pavel Marek gave us one that I really liked.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.500
And this came in the form of a scene

04:06.500 --> 04:09.500
where our bitchy best friend, or a bitchy friend,

04:09.500 --> 04:12.500
says or does something nasty to Bella.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.500
And Cthulhu puts her in the hospital

04:14.500 --> 04:16.500
in some way, shape, or form.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.500
I did it. He started.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.500
For you.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.500
Then the problem will not be spoken of again.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.500
The bitchy girl may or may not be

04:25.500 --> 04:28.500
mentally debilitated forever and ever.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.500
Bella will never question

04:30.500 --> 04:32.500
that maybe she shouldn't be with this person

04:32.500 --> 04:34.500
because of their Austen power.

04:34.500 --> 04:35.500
No.

04:35.500 --> 04:36.500
His devotion.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.500
He loves her so much.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.500
He can't help himself.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.500
I enjoyed Catherine Rose's suggestion

04:42.500 --> 04:44.500
that maybe Bella should have suffered

04:44.500 --> 04:46.500
from night terrors from the time she was little

04:46.500 --> 04:48.500
because of her being the only one

04:48.500 --> 04:50.500
to perceive the real universe in her dreams.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.500
I like this a lot.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.500
She has a secret, unknown pain

04:54.500 --> 04:55.500
and her parents were like,

04:55.500 --> 04:57.500
well I haven't grown out of it yet,

04:57.500 --> 04:58.500
so she keeps it to herself

04:58.500 --> 05:00.500
because she's a teenager now.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.500
She shouldn't be waking up for her nightmares anymore.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.500
She just pretends it's not a thing.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.500
And that's the second book of Twilight,

05:06.500 --> 05:08.500
in that four months where she's waking up

05:08.500 --> 05:10.500
with nightmares every single night

05:10.500 --> 05:12.500
and Charlie just gives up on getting the shit.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.500
As parents do.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.500
As parents do, because it's like,

05:16.500 --> 05:17.500
you're not dying.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.500
They'll get over it, right?

05:19.500 --> 05:21.500
Ghost Riddle Word reminds us that

05:21.500 --> 05:24.500
Edward has to save Bella,

05:24.500 --> 05:28.500
so Lego brick needs to be saved

05:28.500 --> 05:30.500
from rape.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.500
No less than two, maybe three times.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.500
Three times.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.500
Bless you, you signed into Yahoo

05:35.500 --> 05:37.500
just as me.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.500
You mentioned that,

05:41.500 --> 05:43.500
me mentioned that

05:43.500 --> 05:45.500
I like the idea of her being an artist

05:45.500 --> 05:47.500
who works to get inspired by Cthulhu.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.500
Now that gives her a little too much agency.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.500
However, what we came up with

05:51.500 --> 05:53.500
is that she does create

05:53.500 --> 05:55.500
these artistic works

05:55.500 --> 05:57.500
in a dream state.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.500
Sort of like Shia in Transformers 2.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.500
Just all of a sudden one day,

06:02.500 --> 06:04.500
all these amazing abilities,

06:04.500 --> 06:06.500
through no effort or agency of her own.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.500
She never has to work for it,

06:08.500 --> 06:10.500
it just happens to her one day.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.500
So she's not actually an artist,

06:12.500 --> 06:14.500
she's just a conduit for all these images

06:14.500 --> 06:16.500
that control her.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.500
And when she wakes up it's like,

06:18.500 --> 06:20.500
but I can't even draw stick figures.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.500
Anastasia Beaverhausen also suggests

06:22.500 --> 06:24.500
that she needs a flaw that isn't really a flaw.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.500
Like, she's too kind.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.500
She's too nice,

06:28.500 --> 06:30.500
and this only manifests

06:30.500 --> 06:32.500
in the first person prose.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.500
And Max Phillips also suggests

06:36.500 --> 06:38.500
that Unbella throws around

06:38.500 --> 06:40.500
the phrase beautiful insanity

06:40.500 --> 06:42.500
every 15 pages or so.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.500
I like that, it's so artistic.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.500
Alexandria Lundelius points out

06:46.500 --> 06:48.500
she was suggesting that the protagonist

06:48.500 --> 06:50.500
should be an arts crafter,

06:50.500 --> 06:52.500
like arts and crafts.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.500
I think that should be her best friend,

06:54.500 --> 06:56.500
like the fat one.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.500
The fat best friend comes from

06:58.500 --> 07:00.500
a Twilight knockoff called Hush Hush,

07:00.500 --> 07:02.500
which is Twilight with fallen angels.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.500
And the fat best friend is

07:04.500 --> 07:06.500
real big in that one,

07:06.500 --> 07:08.500
because, well, it's real big.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.500
She eats.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.500
Ideal women don't eat.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.500
We don't need to.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.500
We just drink.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.500
Yeah.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.500
Calories.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.500
My life is hard.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.500
And the thing about our Bella or Anna

07:24.500 --> 07:26.500
is that

07:26.500 --> 07:28.500
it's this that bitch lover.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.500
I hate her guts,

07:32.500 --> 07:34.500
but she's the greatest.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.500
Gee, I wonder what she's doing,

07:36.500 --> 07:38.500
that whore.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.500
There has to be that judge love

07:40.500 --> 07:42.500
that goes on in a teenage girl's mind

07:42.500 --> 07:44.500
that is awful, totally awful,

07:44.500 --> 07:46.500
and absolutely happens in real life.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.500
But when you actually read it in a book,

07:48.500 --> 07:50.500
it's the most heinous thing in the world.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.500
Joe Drake's suggestion that we could have

07:52.500 --> 07:54.500
just metaphors, like,

07:54.500 --> 07:56.500
he was my totem, the altar, I wanted to worship that.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.500
The cross I needed to kneel before

07:58.500 --> 08:00.500
more than I had ever needed anything before.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.500
At night in the mornings, on the walk home

08:02.500 --> 08:04.500
from school, I would find myself whispering

08:04.500 --> 08:06.500
little prayers to him.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.500
To go into our, in using

08:08.500 --> 08:10.500
great works of art,

08:10.500 --> 08:12.500
to sort of

08:12.500 --> 08:14.500
lead our stories without actually

08:14.500 --> 08:16.500
influencing them. Genesis,

08:16.500 --> 08:18.500
I'm looking at you. He suggests

08:18.500 --> 08:20.500
we just go T.S. Eliot

08:20.500 --> 08:22.500
The Hollow Men.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.500
This is the way the world ends.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.500
This is the way the world ends.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.500
Not with a bang,

08:28.500 --> 08:30.500
but a whimper.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.500
So deep.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.500
So deep. That's the beginning of our book

08:34.500 --> 08:36.500
that we will never actually reference again.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.500
Debra Elaine suggests that for

08:38.500 --> 08:40.500
like a Briggs family, how about a father who's

08:40.500 --> 08:42.500
spoken of as controlling, but never actually

08:42.500 --> 08:44.500
does anything controlling.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.500
She hates him for a stupid, possibly unexplained

08:46.500 --> 08:48.500
reason. Do you want to explain

08:48.500 --> 08:50.500
informed attributes

08:50.500 --> 08:52.500
to those playing the home game?

08:52.500 --> 08:54.500
So the idea of the informed attribute,

08:54.500 --> 08:56.500
as many of our various

08:56.500 --> 08:58.500
Duke commenters commented,

08:58.500 --> 09:00.500
is that you bring something up,

09:00.500 --> 09:02.500
you define a character

09:02.500 --> 09:04.500
in the tell, don't

09:04.500 --> 09:06.500
show sort of way,

09:06.500 --> 09:08.500
and then never follow up on

09:08.500 --> 09:10.500
it in any meaningful way, especially

09:10.500 --> 09:12.500
in any meaningful way to the plot.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.500
The important thing is the perception

09:14.500 --> 09:16.500
of the reader.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.500
My best friend is a bitch.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.500
Best friend never does anything

09:20.500 --> 09:22.500
bitchy. My father is

09:22.500 --> 09:24.500
controlling. Father never does

09:24.500 --> 09:26.500
anything controlling.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.500
Cthulhu sets my spirit

09:28.500 --> 09:30.500
free. Cthulhu controls

09:30.500 --> 09:32.500
the shit out of her.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.500
So on and so forth.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.500
So what have we decided about our plot?

09:36.500 --> 09:38.500
Well, I think the plot begins

09:38.500 --> 09:40.500
with... In some way, shape,

09:40.500 --> 09:42.500
or form, ethnic third wheels

09:42.500 --> 09:44.500
family has the Necronomicon, right?

09:44.500 --> 09:46.500
Yes. Somehow or other,

09:46.500 --> 09:48.500
ethnic third wheel and

09:48.500 --> 09:50.500
Lego brick read from

09:50.500 --> 09:52.500
the Necronomicon, thereby

09:52.500 --> 09:54.500
summoning the great old one.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.500
Third wheel's

09:56.500 --> 09:58.500
character development is he has

09:58.500 --> 10:00.500
the Necronomicon, he's in love with her,

10:00.500 --> 10:02.500
she meets the bad guy,

10:02.500 --> 10:04.500
or the bad boy.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.500
Third wheel gets shoved

10:06.500 --> 10:08.500
aside, but he knows

10:08.500 --> 10:10.500
that bad boy is the bad boy.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.500
Okay. Proceed with like

10:12.500 --> 10:14.500
20 scenes of them staring into each other's eyes

10:14.500 --> 10:16.500
meaningfully. And also like the

10:16.500 --> 10:18.500
what are you? I can't tell you.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.500
No tell me. I can't tell you.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.500
No one would believe you. I can't tell you.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.500
Meanwhile, ethnic third wheel

10:24.500 --> 10:26.500
knows what's going on.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.500
So when eventually he becomes fed up,

10:28.500 --> 10:30.500
he goes to the cultists,

10:30.500 --> 10:32.500
gets brainwashed,

10:32.500 --> 10:34.500
and we go to our third act,

10:34.500 --> 10:36.500
which is effectively love saves the world.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.500
That's our book.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.500
So that's our basic

10:40.500 --> 10:42.500
outline. Next week, with your

10:42.500 --> 10:44.500
comments and help, we will

10:44.500 --> 10:46.500
come up with a more concrete

10:46.500 --> 10:48.500
outline.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.500
But,

10:50.500 --> 10:52.500
the big things that we need to start

10:52.500 --> 10:54.500
thinking out are, what are

10:54.500 --> 10:56.500
the names of all of these characters?

10:56.500 --> 10:58.500
What is Lego Brick's name?

10:58.500 --> 11:00.500
I really want to call her Blanche

11:00.500 --> 11:02.500
Slate, but obviously that's a little too obvious.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.500
No, my idea was that

11:04.500 --> 11:06.500
her name is Tabitha

11:06.500 --> 11:08.500
Louise Rasa. So we need

11:08.500 --> 11:10.500
to find the names for

11:10.500 --> 11:12.500
Ethnic Third Wheel, for Cthulhu

11:12.500 --> 11:14.500
as boy,

11:14.500 --> 11:16.500
and

11:16.500 --> 11:18.500
for, of course

11:18.500 --> 11:20.500
Lego Brick. Like I say, the Carlisle

11:20.500 --> 11:22.500
is Uncle Neil, and he is

11:22.500 --> 11:24.500
Neil. You're also a tip. Exactly.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.500
Needs to happen.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.500
I will hold on to this until my dying day.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.500
Moreover,

11:30.500 --> 11:32.500
we need to figure out

11:32.500 --> 11:34.500
what our

11:34.500 --> 11:36.500
pen name is.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.500
Start throwing us ideas of

11:38.500 --> 11:40.500
not only what our pen name could be,

11:40.500 --> 11:42.500
but what the project name could be.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.500
Alright! And our title for the book!

11:44.500 --> 11:46.500
And our title for the book!

11:46.500 --> 11:48.500
Start throwing us names for things for our Carlisles,

11:48.500 --> 11:50.500
our supporting characters, our bitchy best friend,

11:50.500 --> 11:52.500
our Lego Brick,

11:52.500 --> 11:54.500
the mother, the father, the title

11:54.500 --> 11:56.500
of the book, and of course our pen name.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.500
Do all this

11:58.500 --> 12:00.500
tweet at us, at Chez Apocalypse.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.500
So after I finish this drink,

12:02.500 --> 12:04.500
all my bad life choices come to fruition, right?

12:04.500 --> 12:06.500
No!

12:06.500 --> 12:08.500
Because we framed them as good.
