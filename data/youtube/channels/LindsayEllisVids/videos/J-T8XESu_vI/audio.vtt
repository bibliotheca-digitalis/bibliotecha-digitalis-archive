WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.680
These were ice cubes, not five minutes ago, mostly.

00:08.680 --> 00:11.280
This is sweating like a horned turd.

00:11.280 --> 00:13.280
Mmm, salty water.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.280
Salty water.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.280
Mmm.

00:15.280 --> 00:16.280
Mmm-mmm.

00:16.280 --> 00:21.280
Okay, so today's drink of choice is the margarita, because it's fucking hot outside.

00:21.280 --> 00:22.280
Alright, so, cheers.

00:22.280 --> 00:25.920
Cheers to the heat wave ending, and to our project continuing.

00:25.920 --> 00:26.920
Yep.

00:26.920 --> 00:31.880
Okay, so, we haven't read any actual comments comments for a few episodes, because we've

00:31.880 --> 00:35.880
been too wrapped up in the actual process, so...

00:35.880 --> 00:38.880
So I mean, the question of last time was, you know, should we self-publish or should

00:38.880 --> 00:39.880
we publish?

00:39.880 --> 00:44.360
And the comments were very right down the middle, in regards to, no, self-publish, like,

00:44.360 --> 00:48.720
these are the reasons why, no, go the traditional route, these are the reasons why.

00:48.720 --> 00:54.360
My favorite comment was from Shiny McShine, who wrote, what, are you crazy?

00:54.360 --> 00:56.000
Take the real publisher.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.040
Just bear in mind that this will all end with both of you looking in the fancy mirrors

01:00.040 --> 01:03.840
and your Upper East Side penthouse and saying, who am I?

01:03.840 --> 01:06.720
But what the hell, mirrors have an off switch.

01:06.720 --> 01:08.360
It's called your rich, drunken fist.

01:08.360 --> 01:13.600
Well, that is funny, I think this person might overestimate how much money there is in publishing.

01:13.600 --> 01:14.600
Yeah, right?

01:14.600 --> 01:20.120
I mean, there were some comments that really pointed out that with self-publishing, um,

01:20.120 --> 01:24.840
we don't have to answer to anyone in regards to why we're doing this.

01:25.840 --> 01:30.080
Because that was one issue we were finding with the publishing house that did contact

01:30.080 --> 01:36.000
us, which was that they wanted us to transform it into something more National Lampoon's

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
parody-like.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.760
Yeah, like, they kind of wanted, the impression I got was they wanted something more in the

01:40.760 --> 01:46.400
vein of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, where the gimmick is right on the cover.

01:46.400 --> 01:49.400
So no one, like, there's no confusion as to what this is.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.400
Yeah.

01:50.400 --> 01:54.360
And I got several people who actually, like, who left comments wanting me to clarify that,

01:54.360 --> 01:57.200
hey, I make my living as an author.

01:57.200 --> 02:02.360
So yeah, what I meant the outliers were, like, the, you know, EL James' super, super blockbuster

02:02.360 --> 02:03.360
ones.

02:03.360 --> 02:04.360
Yeah.

02:04.360 --> 02:06.440
But, uh, yes, there are a lot of people that make their living through self-publishing

02:06.440 --> 02:07.440
now.

02:07.440 --> 02:08.440
Definitely.

02:08.440 --> 02:09.440
And that is very cool.

02:09.440 --> 02:10.440
Good on you, I'm jealous.

02:10.440 --> 02:13.600
Erin The Red, uh, had some good questions.

02:13.600 --> 02:20.480
A, she mentioned that the turnaround was long, I agree, um, but that he told me a year, so

02:20.480 --> 02:21.800
I'll take his word for it.

02:21.800 --> 02:27.600
And while part of the experiment was actually taking people through the, uh, process of

02:27.600 --> 02:34.000
actually getting a book published, A, that turnaround, and B, I think self-publishing

02:34.000 --> 02:35.280
is a process, too.

02:35.280 --> 02:38.240
It's just a different process, but an increasingly relevant one.

02:38.240 --> 02:43.320
Especially as if we look at, um, with self-publishing, though, what we'll be able to explore instead

02:43.320 --> 02:44.320
is self-promotion.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.040
Oh, yeah.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.040
And what-

02:47.040 --> 02:50.360
That stuff you have to do now, even if you are traditionally published, you as an author

02:50.360 --> 02:51.360
have to-

02:51.920 --> 02:56.000
Well, if you look at, like, the self-promotion that, um, uh, Hyperbole and a Half is now

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
doing.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Yeah.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Which is hilarious, by the way.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.480
Buy my book, or I'll fill your feed with spiders.

03:02.480 --> 03:06.040
But it works, but that's not easy for most people.

03:06.040 --> 03:07.040
Yeah.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.040
It wouldn't be easy for me.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.040
Yeah.

03:09.040 --> 03:13.680
Or I'd be like, hey, buy my book, or I'll talk about patriarchy some more.

03:13.680 --> 03:14.680
I'll bore you-

03:14.680 --> 03:15.680
Well, I'm trying to give tales.

03:15.680 --> 03:20.840
I'll bore you with tales of gender inequity, so buy our Cthulhu book.

03:20.840 --> 03:25.280
And third, this was her very good question, uh, why did you create Sarah Ellenson?

03:25.280 --> 03:27.680
Are you trying to pull the wool over unsuspecting readers?

03:27.680 --> 03:31.560
I used to make a statement about how these kinds of books are pastiche, uh, real literature

03:31.560 --> 03:35.120
or something else, and that kind of is cynical.

03:35.120 --> 03:39.200
And she makes the case that Naked Came the Stranger has come and gone.

03:39.200 --> 03:44.560
And the point of that book was to point out, like, I'm gonna write the worst book possible

03:44.560 --> 03:46.720
and people are gonna buy it.

03:46.720 --> 03:51.480
And I'm gonna prove how stupid people are because they bought this awful book that I

03:51.480 --> 03:52.480
wrote.

03:52.480 --> 03:53.480
Well, why did we create Sarah?

03:53.480 --> 03:58.800
It was because we wanted to create a character who would actually write this book.

03:58.800 --> 03:59.800
Yeah.

03:59.800 --> 04:03.040
Sarah is our author voice, which we kind of had to create in order to figure out what

04:03.040 --> 04:04.040
the voice was.

04:04.040 --> 04:10.360
And Sarah was very much based on real-life authors like, uh, Stephanie Meyer and E.L.

04:10.360 --> 04:17.560
James and Colleen Houck, who wrote, uh, the Tiger Books and, you know, they would, they're

04:17.560 --> 04:22.400
all these kind of really insecure women that, like, Stephanie Meyer, who, who she'd have

04:22.400 --> 04:27.080
her brother go through her emails to delete the un, the, the not nice ones and Colleen

04:27.080 --> 04:31.040
Houck who gets in good read fights with people who leave her bad reviews and E.L. James who

04:31.040 --> 04:32.040
gets in Twitter fights.

04:32.040 --> 04:36.680
The good read fights is what really, like, the, we wanted to create a character, a persona

04:36.680 --> 04:42.400
that we could use to kind of fight with people who talk shit about our book because this

04:42.400 --> 04:43.400
is what happens.

04:43.400 --> 04:50.400
This, yeah, this is, in this age of instant gratification, social access with the author,

04:50.400 --> 04:55.680
this is what we're reduced to, talking shit about each other on Goodreads.

04:55.680 --> 04:58.680
So Nagy Came a Stranger had its moment, came and gone.

04:58.680 --> 04:59.680
Yeah.

04:59.680 --> 05:04.440
Um, it was, it was more about how stupid people are than what the industry is like, I feel.

05:04.440 --> 05:08.800
We put a, I mean, like, as stupid as this project is, we put a lot of thought into it

05:08.800 --> 05:15.320
and it was, I mean, like, the, While the Ruse is fun, it's a joke, it's, you know, it's,

05:15.320 --> 05:19.040
we're not gonna, if, if someone comes on Goodreads, we're not gonna sit here and be like, ha ha,

05:19.040 --> 05:21.320
you read our book and liked it, dumbass.

05:21.320 --> 05:27.480
Like, the point, the whole point of the book is, like, we are hyperbolizing tropes that

05:27.480 --> 05:28.640
we don't like.

05:28.640 --> 05:32.720
So the whole point of Sarah was to basically create a character that is based on the Stephanie

05:32.720 --> 05:38.880
Miles of the world, who can't take criticism, but also, like, wear their fantasies on the sleeve.

05:38.880 --> 05:45.400
For me, it's more about, um, how things become popular, even when people can gather around

05:45.400 --> 05:47.400
and be like, yeah, that's not very good.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.760
Like, the room.

05:48.760 --> 05:49.760
Yeah.

05:49.760 --> 05:52.400
Which is awful.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.760
But celebratedly so.

05:54.760 --> 05:55.760
Yeah.

05:55.760 --> 06:00.040
To me, it was more about isolating the sort of terrible elements that people liked and

06:00.480 --> 06:02.760
taking them to their extreme extreme.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.920
That was the point of the actual book to me.

06:04.920 --> 06:10.280
And in that way, yes, it is definitely a parody and meant to be taken as such, but Poe's Law,

06:10.280 --> 06:11.280
not everybody will.

06:11.280 --> 06:16.240
Because we read it and we think it's hilarious, but not everyone might.

06:16.240 --> 06:19.480
They might think, like, yeah, that would be really hot if he tied me to a chair.

06:19.480 --> 06:23.480
But I think the thing about, like, movies like The Room and Birdemic and even Showgirls,

06:23.480 --> 06:28.600
like these camp classics of badness, they didn't set out to be that.

06:28.600 --> 06:29.600
Yeah.

06:30.160 --> 06:36.440
Whereas something like, say, Blazing Saddles or Young Frankenstein, they're genre parodies,

06:36.440 --> 06:39.640
but lovingly so.

06:39.640 --> 06:44.520
So I don't really know where exactly we fall because we're, like, fascinated by Twilight

06:44.520 --> 06:48.920
and that ilk, but I don't think we're fond of it.

06:48.920 --> 06:49.920
Yeah.

06:49.920 --> 06:50.920
But I guess we kind of are.

06:50.920 --> 06:54.080
Otherwise we would have given up on this months ago.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.080
Yeah.

06:55.080 --> 07:00.360
It is a much more subtle parody than I think a mainstream audience might go for.

07:00.360 --> 07:01.360
But that said...

07:01.360 --> 07:06.720
Which I think is why Poe's Law is going to play so hard in this one if it reaches beyond

07:06.720 --> 07:07.720
you, our viewing audience.

07:07.720 --> 07:08.720
Yeah.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.960
I mean, to us, it's super obviously a parody.

07:10.960 --> 07:16.960
We shall see if people take it as super obviously a parody.

07:16.960 --> 07:23.440
So I emailed him and I basically said, I think we could definitely talk about extending this

07:23.440 --> 07:28.680
web series into being something that might be useful to them and doing a different sort

07:28.680 --> 07:33.760
of funny book that is also crowd interactive like our last one was.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.800
But maybe not this one.

07:35.800 --> 07:39.880
Because I think we do kind of want to retain the creative control and I think people aren't

07:39.880 --> 07:41.360
going to want to wait a year.

07:41.360 --> 07:44.120
You know, a year from now they'll be like, what?

07:44.120 --> 07:45.120
I forgot about that.

07:45.120 --> 07:46.120
Yeah.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.120
Yeah.

07:47.120 --> 07:48.320
And what are we going to sit here and talk about for an entire year?

07:48.320 --> 07:50.320
I want my instant gratification!

07:50.320 --> 07:51.320
Yes.

07:51.320 --> 07:52.600
Dang nabbit.

07:52.760 --> 07:57.080
So, I think self-publishing is where it's at.

07:57.080 --> 08:05.600
And what that means is we need to have an art contest for our cover and then we need

08:05.600 --> 08:07.920
to do pre-release stuff.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.200
We need to release a chapter for reading.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.440
Oh yeah!

08:11.440 --> 08:16.960
I think, oh, and did I mention that our friend Sarah now has a website.

08:16.960 --> 08:21.240
So you can go onto Sarah's website and see the teaser chapter.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.360
I forget which one it is.

08:23.360 --> 08:24.360
The teaser.

08:24.360 --> 08:25.360
I don't know.

08:25.360 --> 08:26.360
Well, I guess you're just going to have to go to the website.

08:26.360 --> 08:28.000
I think you're just going to have to go to the website and see for yourself.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
It's going to be exciting.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Yeah.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Chapter 6 is great.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.200
It's got stuff.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.280
Riley.

08:35.280 --> 08:42.880
And also, we are going to be at ConBravo next week and we will have a super, super, super

08:42.880 --> 08:51.360
limited amount of very hastily printed copies of Awoken.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.920
So ConBravo, you get to be the first.

08:53.920 --> 08:54.920
Congratulations.

08:54.920 --> 08:55.920
Congratulations.

08:55.920 --> 08:56.920
So keep watching.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.960
We will keep people abreast of the progress.

08:59.960 --> 09:07.880
We'll also be actually talking to some literary agents on the actual camera.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.400
Not in letter form.

09:09.400 --> 09:13.840
We'll talk query letters and the market and how things are done now and that sort of fun

09:13.840 --> 09:14.840
stuff.

09:14.840 --> 09:19.840
And of course, we will start an art contest, very much like we did for the Ghostwriters

09:19.840 --> 09:25.160
within the next few weeks and then you guys can do a thing and yes, we will pay you.

09:25.160 --> 09:26.160
Yes.

09:26.160 --> 09:27.160
Yes.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.160
You will get paid for your contributions.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.160
Tumblr.

09:29.160 --> 09:30.440
We pay people.

09:30.440 --> 09:49.080
And I look forward to what the future holds for our Frankenstein's monster, Sarah.
