1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,680
These were ice cubes, not five minutes ago, mostly.

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,280
This is sweating like a horned turd.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,280
Mmm, salty water.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,280
Salty water.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,280
Mmm.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,280
Mmm-mmm.

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,280
Okay, so today's drink of choice is the margarita, because it's fucking hot outside.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,280
Alright, so, cheers.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,920
Cheers to the heat wave ending, and to our project continuing.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,920
Yep.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,880
Okay, so, we haven't read any actual comments comments for a few episodes, because we've

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,880
been too wrapped up in the actual process, so...

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,880
So I mean, the question of last time was, you know, should we self-publish or should

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,880
we publish?

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,360
And the comments were very right down the middle, in regards to, no, self-publish, like,

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,720
these are the reasons why, no, go the traditional route, these are the reasons why.

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,360
My favorite comment was from Shiny McShine, who wrote, what, are you crazy?

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,000
Take the real publisher.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,040
Just bear in mind that this will all end with both of you looking in the fancy mirrors

20
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,840
and your Upper East Side penthouse and saying, who am I?

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,720
But what the hell, mirrors have an off switch.

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,360
It's called your rich, drunken fist.

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,600
Well, that is funny, I think this person might overestimate how much money there is in publishing.

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,600
Yeah, right?

25
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,120
I mean, there were some comments that really pointed out that with self-publishing, um,

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,840
we don't have to answer to anyone in regards to why we're doing this.

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,080
Because that was one issue we were finding with the publishing house that did contact

28
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,000
us, which was that they wanted us to transform it into something more National Lampoon's

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
parody-like.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,760
Yeah, like, they kind of wanted, the impression I got was they wanted something more in the

31
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:46,400
vein of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, where the gimmick is right on the cover.

32
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,400
So no one, like, there's no confusion as to what this is.

33
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Yeah.

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,360
And I got several people who actually, like, who left comments wanting me to clarify that,

35
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,200
hey, I make my living as an author.

36
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,360
So yeah, what I meant the outliers were, like, the, you know, EL James' super, super blockbuster

37
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
ones.

38
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,360
Yeah.

39
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,440
But, uh, yes, there are a lot of people that make their living through self-publishing

40
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,440
now.

41
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,440
Definitely.

42
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,440
And that is very cool.

43
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,440
Good on you, I'm jealous.

44
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,600
Erin The Red, uh, had some good questions.

45
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:20,480
A, she mentioned that the turnaround was long, I agree, um, but that he told me a year, so

46
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,800
I'll take his word for it.

47
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,600
And while part of the experiment was actually taking people through the, uh, process of

48
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:34,000
actually getting a book published, A, that turnaround, and B, I think self-publishing

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,280
is a process, too.

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,240
It's just a different process, but an increasingly relevant one.

51
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,320
Especially as if we look at, um, with self-publishing, though, what we'll be able to explore instead

52
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
is self-promotion.

53
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,040
Oh, yeah.

54
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
And what-

55
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,360
That stuff you have to do now, even if you are traditionally published, you as an author

56
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
have to-

57
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,000
Well, if you look at, like, the self-promotion that, um, uh, Hyperbole and a Half is now

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
doing.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah.

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Which is hilarious, by the way.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,480
Buy my book, or I'll fill your feed with spiders.

62
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,040
But it works, but that's not easy for most people.

63
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
Yeah.

64
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
It wouldn't be easy for me.

65
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
Yeah.

66
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,680
Or I'd be like, hey, buy my book, or I'll talk about patriarchy some more.

67
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
I'll bore you-

68
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,680
Well, I'm trying to give tales.

69
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,840
I'll bore you with tales of gender inequity, so buy our Cthulhu book.

70
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,280
And third, this was her very good question, uh, why did you create Sarah Ellenson?

71
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,680
Are you trying to pull the wool over unsuspecting readers?

72
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,560
I used to make a statement about how these kinds of books are pastiche, uh, real literature

73
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,120
or something else, and that kind of is cynical.

74
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,200
And she makes the case that Naked Came the Stranger has come and gone.

75
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,560
And the point of that book was to point out, like, I'm gonna write the worst book possible

76
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,720
and people are gonna buy it.

77
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,480
And I'm gonna prove how stupid people are because they bought this awful book that I

78
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,480
wrote.

79
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,480
Well, why did we create Sarah?

80
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,800
It was because we wanted to create a character who would actually write this book.

81
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Yeah.

82
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,040
Sarah is our author voice, which we kind of had to create in order to figure out what

83
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,040
the voice was.

84
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:10,360
And Sarah was very much based on real-life authors like, uh, Stephanie Meyer and E.L.

85
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:17,560
James and Colleen Houck, who wrote, uh, the Tiger Books and, you know, they would, they're

86
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,400
all these kind of really insecure women that, like, Stephanie Meyer, who, who she'd have

87
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,080
her brother go through her emails to delete the un, the, the not nice ones and Colleen

88
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,040
Houck who gets in good read fights with people who leave her bad reviews and E.L. James who

89
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
gets in Twitter fights.

90
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,680
The good read fights is what really, like, the, we wanted to create a character, a persona

91
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,400
that we could use to kind of fight with people who talk shit about our book because this

92
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,400
is what happens.

93
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:50,400
This, yeah, this is, in this age of instant gratification, social access with the author,

94
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,680
this is what we're reduced to, talking shit about each other on Goodreads.

95
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,680
So Nagy Came a Stranger had its moment, came and gone.

96
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,680
Yeah.

97
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,440
Um, it was, it was more about how stupid people are than what the industry is like, I feel.

98
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,800
We put a, I mean, like, as stupid as this project is, we put a lot of thought into it

99
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,320
and it was, I mean, like, the, While the Ruse is fun, it's a joke, it's, you know, it's,

100
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,040
we're not gonna, if, if someone comes on Goodreads, we're not gonna sit here and be like, ha ha,

101
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,320
you read our book and liked it, dumbass.

102
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:27,480
Like, the point, the whole point of the book is, like, we are hyperbolizing tropes that

103
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,640
we don't like.

104
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,720
So the whole point of Sarah was to basically create a character that is based on the Stephanie

105
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,880
Miles of the world, who can't take criticism, but also, like, wear their fantasies on the sleeve.

106
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,400
For me, it's more about, um, how things become popular, even when people can gather around

107
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
and be like, yeah, that's not very good.

108
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,760
Like, the room.

109
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,760
Yeah.

110
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,400
Which is awful.

111
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,760
But celebratedly so.

112
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,760
Yeah.

113
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,040
To me, it was more about isolating the sort of terrible elements that people liked and

114
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,760
taking them to their extreme extreme.

115
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,920
That was the point of the actual book to me.

116
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:10,280
And in that way, yes, it is definitely a parody and meant to be taken as such, but Poe's Law,

117
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,280
not everybody will.

118
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,240
Because we read it and we think it's hilarious, but not everyone might.

119
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,480
They might think, like, yeah, that would be really hot if he tied me to a chair.

120
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,480
But I think the thing about, like, movies like The Room and Birdemic and even Showgirls,

121
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,600
like these camp classics of badness, they didn't set out to be that.

122
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Yeah.

123
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,440
Whereas something like, say, Blazing Saddles or Young Frankenstein, they're genre parodies,

124
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,640
but lovingly so.

125
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,520
So I don't really know where exactly we fall because we're, like, fascinated by Twilight

126
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,920
and that ilk, but I don't think we're fond of it.

127
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Yeah.

128
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
But I guess we kind of are.

129
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,080
Otherwise we would have given up on this months ago.

130
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
Yeah.

131
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,360
It is a much more subtle parody than I think a mainstream audience might go for.

132
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,360
But that said...

133
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,720
Which I think is why Poe's Law is going to play so hard in this one if it reaches beyond

134
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
you, our viewing audience.

135
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,720
Yeah.

136
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,960
I mean, to us, it's super obviously a parody.

137
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,960
We shall see if people take it as super obviously a parody.

138
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:23,440
So I emailed him and I basically said, I think we could definitely talk about extending this

139
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,680
web series into being something that might be useful to them and doing a different sort

140
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,760
of funny book that is also crowd interactive like our last one was.

141
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,800
But maybe not this one.

142
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,880
Because I think we do kind of want to retain the creative control and I think people aren't

143
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,360
going to want to wait a year.

144
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,120
You know, a year from now they'll be like, what?

145
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
I forgot about that.

146
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
Yeah.

147
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
Yeah.

148
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,320
And what are we going to sit here and talk about for an entire year?

149
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,320
I want my instant gratification!

150
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,320
Yes.

151
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,600
Dang nabbit.

152
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,080
So, I think self-publishing is where it's at.

153
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:05,600
And what that means is we need to have an art contest for our cover and then we need

154
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,920
to do pre-release stuff.

155
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,200
We need to release a chapter for reading.

156
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,440
Oh yeah!

157
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,960
I think, oh, and did I mention that our friend Sarah now has a website.

158
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,240
So you can go onto Sarah's website and see the teaser chapter.

159
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,360
I forget which one it is.

160
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
The teaser.

161
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
I don't know.

162
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
Well, I guess you're just going to have to go to the website.

163
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,000
I think you're just going to have to go to the website and see for yourself.

164
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's going to be exciting.

165
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah.

166
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Chapter 6 is great.

167
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,200
It's got stuff.

168
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,280
Riley.

169
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:42,880
And also, we are going to be at ConBravo next week and we will have a super, super, super

170
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:51,360
limited amount of very hastily printed copies of Awoken.

171
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,920
So ConBravo, you get to be the first.

172
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
Congratulations.

173
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
Congratulations.

174
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,920
So keep watching.

175
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,960
We will keep people abreast of the progress.

176
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:07,880
We'll also be actually talking to some literary agents on the actual camera.

177
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,400
Not in letter form.

178
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,840
We'll talk query letters and the market and how things are done now and that sort of fun

179
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
stuff.

180
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,840
And of course, we will start an art contest, very much like we did for the Ghostwriters

181
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:25,160
within the next few weeks and then you guys can do a thing and yes, we will pay you.

182
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
Yes.

183
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,160
Yes.

184
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,160
You will get paid for your contributions.

185
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
Tumblr.

186
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,440
We pay people.

187
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:49,080
And I look forward to what the future holds for our Frankenstein's monster, Sarah.
