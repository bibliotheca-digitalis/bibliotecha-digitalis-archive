0	8680	These were ice cubes, not five minutes ago, mostly.
8680	11280	This is sweating like a horned turd.
11280	13280	Mmm, salty water.
13280	14280	Salty water.
14280	15280	Mmm.
15280	16280	Mmm-mmm.
16280	21280	Okay, so today's drink of choice is the margarita, because it's fucking hot outside.
21280	22280	Alright, so, cheers.
22280	25920	Cheers to the heat wave ending, and to our project continuing.
25920	26920	Yep.
26920	31880	Okay, so, we haven't read any actual comments comments for a few episodes, because we've
31880	35880	been too wrapped up in the actual process, so...
35880	38880	So I mean, the question of last time was, you know, should we self-publish or should
38880	39880	we publish?
39880	44360	And the comments were very right down the middle, in regards to, no, self-publish, like,
44360	48720	these are the reasons why, no, go the traditional route, these are the reasons why.
48720	54360	My favorite comment was from Shiny McShine, who wrote, what, are you crazy?
54360	56000	Take the real publisher.
56000	60040	Just bear in mind that this will all end with both of you looking in the fancy mirrors
60040	63840	and your Upper East Side penthouse and saying, who am I?
63840	66720	But what the hell, mirrors have an off switch.
66720	68360	It's called your rich, drunken fist.
68360	73600	Well, that is funny, I think this person might overestimate how much money there is in publishing.
73600	74600	Yeah, right?
74600	80120	I mean, there were some comments that really pointed out that with self-publishing, um,
80120	84840	we don't have to answer to anyone in regards to why we're doing this.
85840	90080	Because that was one issue we were finding with the publishing house that did contact
90080	96000	us, which was that they wanted us to transform it into something more National Lampoon's
96000	97000	parody-like.
97000	100760	Yeah, like, they kind of wanted, the impression I got was they wanted something more in the
100760	106400	vein of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, where the gimmick is right on the cover.
106400	109400	So no one, like, there's no confusion as to what this is.
109400	110400	Yeah.
110400	114360	And I got several people who actually, like, who left comments wanting me to clarify that,
114360	117200	hey, I make my living as an author.
117200	122360	So yeah, what I meant the outliers were, like, the, you know, EL James' super, super blockbuster
122360	123360	ones.
123360	124360	Yeah.
124360	126440	But, uh, yes, there are a lot of people that make their living through self-publishing
126440	127440	now.
127440	128440	Definitely.
128440	129440	And that is very cool.
129440	130440	Good on you, I'm jealous.
130440	133600	Erin The Red, uh, had some good questions.
133600	140480	A, she mentioned that the turnaround was long, I agree, um, but that he told me a year, so
140480	141800	I'll take his word for it.
141800	147600	And while part of the experiment was actually taking people through the, uh, process of
147600	154000	actually getting a book published, A, that turnaround, and B, I think self-publishing
154000	155280	is a process, too.
155280	158240	It's just a different process, but an increasingly relevant one.
158240	163320	Especially as if we look at, um, with self-publishing, though, what we'll be able to explore instead
163320	164320	is self-promotion.
164320	166040	Oh, yeah.
166040	167040	And what-
167040	170360	That stuff you have to do now, even if you are traditionally published, you as an author
170360	171360	have to-
171920	176000	Well, if you look at, like, the self-promotion that, um, uh, Hyperbole and a Half is now
176000	177000	doing.
177000	178000	Yeah.
178000	179000	Which is hilarious, by the way.
179000	182480	Buy my book, or I'll fill your feed with spiders.
182480	186040	But it works, but that's not easy for most people.
186040	187040	Yeah.
187040	188040	It wouldn't be easy for me.
188040	189040	Yeah.
189040	193680	Or I'd be like, hey, buy my book, or I'll talk about patriarchy some more.
193680	194680	I'll bore you-
194680	195680	Well, I'm trying to give tales.
195680	200840	I'll bore you with tales of gender inequity, so buy our Cthulhu book.
200840	205280	And third, this was her very good question, uh, why did you create Sarah Ellenson?
205280	207680	Are you trying to pull the wool over unsuspecting readers?
207680	211560	I used to make a statement about how these kinds of books are pastiche, uh, real literature
211560	215120	or something else, and that kind of is cynical.
215120	219200	And she makes the case that Naked Came the Stranger has come and gone.
219200	224560	And the point of that book was to point out, like, I'm gonna write the worst book possible
224560	226720	and people are gonna buy it.
226720	231480	And I'm gonna prove how stupid people are because they bought this awful book that I
231480	232480	wrote.
232480	233480	Well, why did we create Sarah?
233480	238800	It was because we wanted to create a character who would actually write this book.
238800	239800	Yeah.
239800	243040	Sarah is our author voice, which we kind of had to create in order to figure out what
243040	244040	the voice was.
244040	250360	And Sarah was very much based on real-life authors like, uh, Stephanie Meyer and E.L.
250360	257560	James and Colleen Houck, who wrote, uh, the Tiger Books and, you know, they would, they're
257560	262400	all these kind of really insecure women that, like, Stephanie Meyer, who, who she'd have
262400	267080	her brother go through her emails to delete the un, the, the not nice ones and Colleen
267080	271040	Houck who gets in good read fights with people who leave her bad reviews and E.L. James who
271040	272040	gets in Twitter fights.
272040	276680	The good read fights is what really, like, the, we wanted to create a character, a persona
276680	282400	that we could use to kind of fight with people who talk shit about our book because this
282400	283400	is what happens.
283400	290400	This, yeah, this is, in this age of instant gratification, social access with the author,
290400	295680	this is what we're reduced to, talking shit about each other on Goodreads.
295680	298680	So Nagy Came a Stranger had its moment, came and gone.
298680	299680	Yeah.
299680	304440	Um, it was, it was more about how stupid people are than what the industry is like, I feel.
304440	308800	We put a, I mean, like, as stupid as this project is, we put a lot of thought into it
308800	315320	and it was, I mean, like, the, While the Ruse is fun, it's a joke, it's, you know, it's,
315320	319040	we're not gonna, if, if someone comes on Goodreads, we're not gonna sit here and be like, ha ha,
319040	321320	you read our book and liked it, dumbass.
321320	327480	Like, the point, the whole point of the book is, like, we are hyperbolizing tropes that
327480	328640	we don't like.
328640	332720	So the whole point of Sarah was to basically create a character that is based on the Stephanie
332720	338880	Miles of the world, who can't take criticism, but also, like, wear their fantasies on the sleeve.
338880	345400	For me, it's more about, um, how things become popular, even when people can gather around
345400	347400	and be like, yeah, that's not very good.
347400	348760	Like, the room.
348760	349760	Yeah.
349760	352400	Which is awful.
352400	354760	But celebratedly so.
354760	355760	Yeah.
355760	360040	To me, it was more about isolating the sort of terrible elements that people liked and
360480	362760	taking them to their extreme extreme.
362760	364920	That was the point of the actual book to me.
364920	370280	And in that way, yes, it is definitely a parody and meant to be taken as such, but Poe's Law,
370280	371280	not everybody will.
371280	376240	Because we read it and we think it's hilarious, but not everyone might.
376240	379480	They might think, like, yeah, that would be really hot if he tied me to a chair.
379480	383480	But I think the thing about, like, movies like The Room and Birdemic and even Showgirls,
383480	388600	like these camp classics of badness, they didn't set out to be that.
388600	389600	Yeah.
390160	396440	Whereas something like, say, Blazing Saddles or Young Frankenstein, they're genre parodies,
396440	399640	but lovingly so.
399640	404520	So I don't really know where exactly we fall because we're, like, fascinated by Twilight
404520	408920	and that ilk, but I don't think we're fond of it.
408920	409920	Yeah.
409920	410920	But I guess we kind of are.
410920	414080	Otherwise we would have given up on this months ago.
414080	415080	Yeah.
415080	420360	It is a much more subtle parody than I think a mainstream audience might go for.
420360	421360	But that said...
421360	426720	Which I think is why Poe's Law is going to play so hard in this one if it reaches beyond
426720	427720	you, our viewing audience.
427720	428720	Yeah.
428720	430960	I mean, to us, it's super obviously a parody.
430960	436960	We shall see if people take it as super obviously a parody.
436960	443440	So I emailed him and I basically said, I think we could definitely talk about extending this
443440	448680	web series into being something that might be useful to them and doing a different sort
448680	453760	of funny book that is also crowd interactive like our last one was.
453760	455800	But maybe not this one.
455800	459880	Because I think we do kind of want to retain the creative control and I think people aren't
459880	461360	going to want to wait a year.
461360	464120	You know, a year from now they'll be like, what?
464120	465120	I forgot about that.
465120	466120	Yeah.
466120	467120	Yeah.
467120	468320	And what are we going to sit here and talk about for an entire year?
468320	470320	I want my instant gratification!
470320	471320	Yes.
471320	472600	Dang nabbit.
472760	477080	So, I think self-publishing is where it's at.
477080	485600	And what that means is we need to have an art contest for our cover and then we need
485600	487920	to do pre-release stuff.
487920	490200	We need to release a chapter for reading.
490200	491440	Oh yeah!
491440	496960	I think, oh, and did I mention that our friend Sarah now has a website.
496960	501240	So you can go onto Sarah's website and see the teaser chapter.
501280	503360	I forget which one it is.
503360	504360	The teaser.
504360	505360	I don't know.
505360	506360	Well, I guess you're just going to have to go to the website.
506360	508000	I think you're just going to have to go to the website and see for yourself.
508000	509000	It's going to be exciting.
509000	510000	Yeah.
510000	511000	Chapter 6 is great.
511000	513200	It's got stuff.
513200	515280	Riley.
515280	522880	And also, we are going to be at ConBravo next week and we will have a super, super, super
522880	531360	limited amount of very hastily printed copies of Awoken.
531360	533920	So ConBravo, you get to be the first.
533920	534920	Congratulations.
534920	535920	Congratulations.
535920	536920	So keep watching.
536920	539960	We will keep people abreast of the progress.
539960	547880	We'll also be actually talking to some literary agents on the actual camera.
547880	549400	Not in letter form.
549400	553840	We'll talk query letters and the market and how things are done now and that sort of fun
553840	554840	stuff.
554840	559840	And of course, we will start an art contest, very much like we did for the Ghostwriters
559840	565160	within the next few weeks and then you guys can do a thing and yes, we will pay you.
565160	566160	Yes.
566160	567160	Yes.
567160	568160	You will get paid for your contributions.
568160	569160	Tumblr.
569160	570440	We pay people.
570440	589080	And I look forward to what the future holds for our Frankenstein's monster, Sarah.
