WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Once upon a time, there was this brilliant composer, not the best looking guy.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
And one day, this beautiful, young, chestnut-haired, singing and dancing ingenue

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
floats into his life, and he falls in love with her.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
And he decides, I'm going to take you under my wing, and tutor you,

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
and compose this incredible masterwork for you to star in.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
And she was enthralled at first, but then in the end, it didn't work out too well.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
I'm talking, of course, about the tragic, torrid tale

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Sarah Brightman.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
During the creation of what would eventually become

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
the longest-running Broadway show in musical theater history.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Gentlemen!

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Lord Andy decided that his version of Phantom of the Opera

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
would feature the angle of, hey, why don't we look at the things

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
from the Phantom's point of view, okay?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
He has needs, too, alright?

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Maybe he's not the best looking guy, but he's a really talented composer,

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
and he just wants to compose things for his precious lady love,

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
who is way too young for him, but is maybe kind of talented,

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
maybe not that talented, but he thinks she's really talented, okay?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
But that wasn't so innovative.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Brian De Palma did that, too.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
What was Andrew Lloyd Webber's really big innovation?

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
That huge, million-dollar idea that finally elevates Phantom of the Opera

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
to blockbuster status is that the Phantom is no longer a golem-y wretch,

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
but a misunderstood stud, and that Christine's kind of into it.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
You could call the stage musical, this stage musical,

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
a culmination of all of the previous versions,

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
because it takes inspiration not just from the book,

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
but almost everything else that came before it.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Phantom continues to be a cultural phenomenon to this day

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
because of the stage musical, which is still running.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Has your mom been to New York and seen exactly one Broadway show?

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
She's seen Phantom.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Or The Lion King.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
Everyone's mom and all the sad teenage girls love Phantom of the Opera.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Not that I would know.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
But in a post-Broadway musical world,

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
Phantom of the Opera wasn't something like, say, Avatar.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Remember that James Cameron movie?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
It wasn't a trend that came and went away.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
It's been here pretty steadily for the last 30 years.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
And this is honestly kind of difficult to keep this to a character profile,

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
even more now than the last episode,

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
because the character is so tied in with the franchise.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
But I will try to restrain my tangenting ways.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Here we go.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Phantom of the Opera, after Lloyd Wittman.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
I'll start with what you probably already know.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Phantom of the Opera.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
is the most financially successful musical in history,

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
with a worldwide gross nearly twice that of all four of the Transformers movies,

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
and it is also the longest-running musical in Broadway history.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
It won the Tony for Best Musical in 1988,

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
which beat Into the Woods,

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
and a lot of musical theater fans are still salty about that.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Poo-poo on the sucker, but let's be real, guys.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
There is a reason it's still running.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
It's kind of the perfect musical in the same way that, like,

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Independence Day is a perfect movie.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Oh, boys!

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
Civilization will fall, and Phantom of the Opera will still be running.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Watch it close, like, a week after this goes up.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical was of course not the last version of Phantom by any stretch,

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
but all of the weird and wonderful knockoffs we'll be covering today

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
are inspired by this much more than, say, the Lon Chaney version,

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
or the Claude Rains version.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
After the musical, we start seeing that half-mask,

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
right here,

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
as the iconic thing rather than, like, the full mask as we would see before.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
Even though the full mask is on the official logo of the Broadway musical,

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
this comes from the logo being set in stone before the wardrobe was,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
and that half-mask,

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
that was because Michael Crawford's microphone didn't jive with the full mask,

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
and so the half-mask and the deformity were kind of built around the microphone.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
What makes this version work the best

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
is the fact that the Phantom isn't in it all that much.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
A little goes a long way, but when he is in it,

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
oh, the feelings!

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
No! Damn you!

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Christine unmasks him and he flies into a rage!

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
This low sim carpoil!

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
And then for 30 seconds it's like,

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
blue, blue, blue, please love me,

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
and then 30 seconds after that, he's fine,

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
and we're going back upstairs.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
And this is one of the things that is so difficult for film adaptations to capture.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
The musical format allows these mood swings to work

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
in a really, really compressed amount of time.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
That's part of why Les Mis the musical works so much better

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
than Les Mis the movie musical,

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
but we'll get to the movie musical later.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
As always, Eric is an emotional mess in the stage musical,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
but how this is played, the characterization,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
really is based on the actor.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
For instance, a guy like Hugh Pinero is more on the

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
me-he-he-he-I'm-evil end,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
and guys like John Owen Jones are more on the

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
sad puppy end.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
Norm Lewis kind of gives him a more dad affect,

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
and Ramin Karimloo, he just has a lot of feelings, okay?

05:22.000 --> 05:28.000
Don't ever leave me!

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Or if you go way back, before the musical,

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
you get the rock god Phantom Steve Harley.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
He was never in the musical, so I can't speak to him much,

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
although he was originally going to be Michael Crawford,

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
but then Michael Crawford replaced him.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Sorry, dude.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
But that hella electric guitar riff.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Now the musical is the new benchmark,

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
the new theme to be ripped off,

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
and suddenly we have a lot more Phantom adaptations

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
in the wake of a hit Broadway musical.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Hey, it's the mid-80s, and VCRs are becoming

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
an increasingly popular form of babysitting.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
How about Phantom of the Opera for kids?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
This is nowhere near as hilarious as it sounds,

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
except insofar as it had a budget of, like, two,

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
and the animation is terrible.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
While the novel isn't really violent and has zero sex,

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
it isn't really, you know, interesting to kids either.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
So this, rather than being a kiddified version of the book,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
is basically just the book.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
But boy, did they not have the budget to give him

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
a scary face or more than five facial expressions.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
So since this one's also one of the closest to the books

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
of all the adaptations,

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
it gets that I've learned the error of my ways thing in there.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
But that is apparently not a terribly satisfactory ending,

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
so rocks falls and he dies.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Next.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
I'm sorry about the way I look.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
I know I said I'm not going to go into every post-musical version

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
because there are a ton, but I have to give a nod

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
to Phantom of the Mall.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Eric's Revenge.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
This is, um, it's actually a horror movie?

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Eric with a C is your average sexy high school athlete

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
with a family who happens to have a house on land

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
that is coveted by a mall development.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
So when Eric's family won't sell,

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
the mall people will sell the house.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
The mall people send a hitman to kill Eric's family by burning

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
so they could build that mall unfettered.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Morgan Fairchild plays the bad guy.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Pauly Shore is the Persian analog.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
And Eric doesn't compose, he works out.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
He doesn't use a Punjab lasso, he roundhouse kicks his enemies.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
And when Christine wakes up in his lair,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
he's not playing the organ.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
He's lifting.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Hello, Eric.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
That alone deserves a modest slow clap.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Next.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Yes.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
People are often surprised to learn that Freddy Krueger himself,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Robert England, starred in this version

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
at the height of both Nightmare on Elm Street

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
and the popularity of the Broadway musical.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
And it is a shameless ripoff of both.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
This one includes the odd element of Christine being a modern

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
who is like the reincarnation of 1880s Christine.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
And she goes back in time to relive the whole Phantom thing.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
Why the modern plot is in there, I don't know.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
This Eric has sold his soul to the devil.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
See, he's a great composer, but the soul selling made him ugg.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
So he kills people every few days or so

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
and sews skin onto his Freddy Krueger face.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
He has bad puns like any Freddy Krueger.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
And, of course, Freddy Krueger's oh face with his killgasm.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
This version is the most evil Phantom

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
and therefore the least interested in his Christine.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
From a filmmaking standpoint, he doesn't seem to want her at all.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
They're almost never in the same shot together.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
And in this version, he also solicits prostitutes.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
My name is Maddie.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
You haven't been doing this for very long, have you?

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
Well, I find this remarkable in that it is the super rare horror movie

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
where sex workers don't get punished for being sex workers.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
This version, on the whole, is surprisingly disappointing,

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
considering what it is.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Because it's boring, not because it's gross.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
But it is really gross.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Where do you live?

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
When you sing, I live in the heavens.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
And when you do not, down below.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
From Freddy Krueger, we go to Tywin Lannister.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Yet, before he was the lord of Casterly Rock,

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Charles Dance did a turn as the Phantom 2.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
This was a TV movie that was based on a musical

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
by Maury Yeston and Arthur Coppett of Nine fame.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
This one's pretty similar to their musical,

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
minus, you know, being a musical.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
And believe it or not, this musical actually predated

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
Lloyd Webber's version in terms of when it was started.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
But for a variety of reasons, it didn't premiere until 1991,

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
after they produced the TV movie, based on the then-unproduced musical.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
And this is honestly one of the better versions.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
Ignoring the part where it is way too freaking long.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Seriously, it's three hours.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
Dance plays Eric more vulnerable and sensitive than Tywin-y.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
I'm just not used to killing people.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Just throw me off a bit.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Once again, there's no Persian.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Instead, he's got a dad.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
I mean, he doesn't know that Burt Lancaster is his dad,

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
but his dad does.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Which kind of detracts from the tragedy a bit.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
A lot. It detracts a lot.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Because Eric's not alone.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
He's got Burt Lancaster watching out for him the whole movie.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
So it's really hard to feel sorry for him

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
when he's basically living on daddy's credit card under the opera house.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
This is also the only version where we don't see his face at all.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Does this work?

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Kinda? A little?

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
Honestly, it feels more like a cop-out.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
But it's also the only version where he punches a fake deer in the face.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Let's watch that again.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
Dario Argento's Italian horror version,

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
aka the version with the rat sex scene,

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
aka the absolute worst one, period.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
This one makes the 2004 movie look great.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
Remember how in Batman Returns the penguin was raised by sewer penguins?

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
Well, this phantom was raised by rats.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Also, he's not deformed at all.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
Shruggles.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
It's an internal kind of ugliness.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
I don't know.

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
I assume he looks normal because the director didn't want to have a hot, steamy sex scene

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
starring his actual IRL daughter with an uggo.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
He's also the only version that just straight-up rapes his Christine,

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
so he keeps racking up the worst one points.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Worst one.

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
In fairness, being raised by sewer rats makes a tiny bit more sense than sewer penguins.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
Boy, does this phantom love him some rats.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
And he will murder you if you come after his rats.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
And in the end, Christine's really hot for him, but...

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Christine!

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Oh, no, not my raised-by-rats rapist.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
Okay, but now we're really going to get into it.

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
You have come here

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
for one purpose and one alone

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Woof.

12:30.000 --> 12:36.000
Joel Schumacher of Batman and Robin fame was always Lord Andy's top choice to direct

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
because Lord Andy is the grand poobah of terrible decisions

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
once he's old enough to start drawing Retirement.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
And boy could I harp on the technical ineptitude of Joel Schumacher's filmmaking choices

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
in this shitstorm of a movie, but let's stick to the topic at hand.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
And I know a lot of people like this version,

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
so if you don't want to watch me rag on Gerard Butler for five minutes,

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
just skip to this timecode here.

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
The movie adaptation of the Broadway musical features Z-grade Tom Waits impersonator Gerard Butler

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
as the most bewilderingly miscast phantom yet.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
When you look at the other Phantom adaptations, at least some of the worst ones,

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
at least they knew what they were going for.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
They had a vision and they stuck to it.

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
What the hell were they thinking trying to fit a Gerard Butler-shaped peg

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
into a person-who-can-sing-shaped hole?

13:27.000 --> 13:33.000
This is the point of no return!

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
Curse you! You little lying Delilah!

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Here is where Gerard Butler belongs.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Or here.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
No, no, no.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Yes?

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
No.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
No, God, no.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Okay.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Focus.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
Ignoring the fact that the man with the perfect tenor cannot sing,

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
I wouldn't characterize Butler's Phantom as particularly sexual either,

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
possibly owing to the fact that our lead actress was underage at the time,

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
but his Phantom is more of a petulant child.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
In no other version, for instance, does he play with dolls.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
Like, where did this come from?

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
Though the relative sexlessness may be part of the draw,

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
in the same way, you know, Edward Cullen is a draw,

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
this movie fixes a lot of the logical problems from the musical,

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
but then creates all new ones.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
A big addition in the movie is a sword fight between Eric and Raoul,

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
which Raoul promptly wins.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
God, how did you survive on your own this long, dude?

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
That shit is caught.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
You have been caught.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
No, no, apparently not.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
Now, let it be war upon you both.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
And in the very next scene, Raoul's like,

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
and now I know how to catch him.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
To ensnare our clever friend.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
So during the scene featuring Dread Pirate Roberts and the Tango Dancers,

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
oh God.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
This fucking movie.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
So, after Dread Pirate Roberts and the Tango Dancers

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
in front of the PA waving flames in the background,

15:37.000 --> 15:42.000
Christine rips off his full head of hair to reveal another full head of hair

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
and a deformity that amounts to, like, I don't know,

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
maybe he had some shellfish that didn't agree with him.

15:48.000 --> 15:54.000
This feisty infection which poisons our love.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
She's like, really?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
That's what you're all worked up about?

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
This is your reason for abandoning society?

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
This is what got you caged and put in a freak show?

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
Like, you got stung by a bee, you're fine.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
You get the impression that Butler knows his deformity is not even really a deformity

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
because he really tries to compensate with ultra crazy face,

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
but really nothing compelling or tragic here when she kisses him.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
I'm glad you can bear to kiss me despite my pink eye.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
And the beat of him letting her go is apparently not enough

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
to impart his man pain for Joel Schumacher.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Oh no.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
This movie ends with him breaking all of the mirrors.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Every single one.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Metaphor.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
So, as watchably awful as the 2004 movie is,

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
the rabbit hole goes deeper still as we reach the coup de grace

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
of this whole shit show, the piece de resistance.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
I mean, the movie did...

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Okay.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
I mean, it got a theatrical release.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
And the show is now the longest running one ever,

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
so did someone say...

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
sequel?

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
Want to dissuade your kids from majoring in musical theater?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Murder that dream in its crib?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Love Never Dies.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
The worst musical I've ever seen.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
And I've seen Lestat the musical.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Twice.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
Ten years on and Eric has apparently jumped ship on living in France

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
and immigrated to Coney Island

17:25.000 --> 17:31.000
where he owns a theme park slash freaks show slash opera type thing.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
And now he's got his empire all set up.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
He's ready to lure Christine out in order to win her back

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
for realsies this time.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
The passion.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
The romance.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
The milking of the giant cow.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
Thrill as Eric pours Raoul a drink as their dick wagging contest

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
enters its second decade.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
Real as Eric and Christine sing a song about how they had sex that one time

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
off screen somewhere.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
And I caught you.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
And I kissed you.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
And I took you.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
And I pegged you.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
The version you can find on DVD, by the way,

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
is basically version like 35.6.0

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
as this show was workshopped a lot.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
So this isn't really even the definitive version.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
It's just a version.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
Instead of The Phantom, he goes by Mr. Why.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
Mr. Why welcomes you.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
So Christine and the fam come to Coney Island because they need money.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
And this might seem petty in the grand scheme of the show's shittiness,

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
but how does Christine not immediately recognize that something is wrong

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
when a Tim Burton carriage pulls up with Alan Cumming and Uncle Fester in tow?

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Climb aboard.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
Did somebody call for a nightmare?

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
As soon as Eric gets her alone, they sing this ten-minute dirge

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
about how they had sex once.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
As you do.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Then, surprise, guess whose kid that is.

18:48.000 --> 18:54.000
Ten years old.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
So, Eric, let's ask the serious question.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
What's different from the first musical?

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
What's missing?

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
He's a jerkass in both of them, sure.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
But in the first one, he's sympathetic because he's deprived.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
And while his actions aren't condonable, they are still motivated.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
In Love Never Dies, The Phantom has

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
A. A huge support network.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
B. Successful business.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
C. Lots of money.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
D. Already banged Christine.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
E. A fucking kid he didn't even have to raise.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
F. Is a massive asshole anyway.

19:26.000 --> 19:32.000
All your progeny may disappear.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Our hero threatens to murder Christine's child.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
So romantic.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Leaves are crying.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
What a man.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I guess Fifty Shades of Grey fans would like it.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
It's like it took everything about the first show that made it work despite itself

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
and chucked it out the window.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
He basically ruins all of the other characters' lives Heathcliff-style.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
But he's our hero now.

19:53.000 --> 19:58.000
To be fair, I'm at a loss as to where the story could have gone.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
The story of Eric and Christine is done when he lets Christine go.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
It is emotionally complete in a way that not many stories are.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
Continuing the story of Eric and Christine is just redundant.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
It's over.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
The mere existence of Love Never Dies makes the story beat of The Phantom

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
putting someone else's needs before his own.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Just destroys it.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Just gone.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Bye.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
Phantom's character arc, in the good versions anyway, is about maturation.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
He is a genius in some regards, sure.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
But in the realm of interhuman contact, of love, he is a child.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
He never made it past toddlerhood.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Now let there be war!

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Upon you both!

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Now!

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
Oh sure, just because I'm shooting fireballs at you, you abandon me.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Well fine, I'll kill everybody.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
Because he's never been shown love or compassion himself.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Other people are basically toys to him.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
That's kind of a thing that happens.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
The act of him letting Christine go is the first time in his life

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
that he really recognizes someone else's humanity.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
That act of self-sacrifice, of putting someone else's needs before his own,

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
is one of the most painful lessons that he or anyone can learn.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
That is adulthood.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
The world show no compassion to me!

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Toxic people are toxic for a reason.

21:12.000 --> 21:17.000
Their lives probably sucked, making them into toxic, abusive opera ghosts.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
That does not mean that they are not worthy of love,

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
or that they cannot learn to be better people.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
But just because your life sucked doesn't mean you can march up to people

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
and declare that they owe you something.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
So while many claim that it's this tragic story about repressed sexuality or something,

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
I don't see it that way.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
I see it as a coming-of-age story for a 50-year-old man,

21:37.000 --> 21:42.000
which is why I see Eric voluntarily letting Christine go as such an important character beat.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
That is the moment he finally grows up.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
The moment he realizes that, yeah, his life has sucked,

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
but that doesn't give him the license to make people his playthings.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
So, f**k Love Never Dies, and it's stupid existing,

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
but I highly recommend it for your bad movie nights.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
It is pretty Larry-awful.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Bad Larry-ous.

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
So, to conclude, is there a really great version of The Phantom of the Opera?

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
No.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
But there are compelling versions.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Obviously, this is all very subjective,

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
but because people ask, for my money,

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
the 25th Anniversary Live at the Royal Albert Hall version

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
is pretty much the closest to a definitive version you're going to find.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess are my favorite Phantom and Christine, respectively,

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
and here they are at the same time.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
And it is far from the deepest musical you're ever going to find,

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
but I'm just saying, it's still running for a reason.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
So, that wraps up my Phantom-opus, maybe?

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
Like I said, that could go on.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
But we're going to move on from that topic.

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
The voted theme for the next round is

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
historical people that actually existed and got fictionalized.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
Yeah, so here are your options.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Vote well, vote strong.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
You can do so here.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
You can find out who I pick on my Twitter,

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
and you can also support me on Patreon,

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
where you can help me vote on things like

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
what our next theme for Loose Cannon is going to be.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Thank you very much for watching,

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
and I will see you next time.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Don't kidnap people.
