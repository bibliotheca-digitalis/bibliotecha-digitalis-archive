1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Once upon a time, there was this brilliant composer, not the best looking guy.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And one day, this beautiful, young, chestnut-haired, singing and dancing ingenue

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
floats into his life, and he falls in love with her.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And he decides, I'm going to take you under my wing, and tutor you,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and compose this incredible masterwork for you to star in.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And she was enthralled at first, but then in the end, it didn't work out too well.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm talking, of course, about the tragic, torrid tale

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Sarah Brightman.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
During the creation of what would eventually become

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
the longest-running Broadway show in musical theater history.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Gentlemen!

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Lord Andy decided that his version of Phantom of the Opera

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
would feature the angle of, hey, why don't we look at the things

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
from the Phantom's point of view, okay?

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
He has needs, too, alright?

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Maybe he's not the best looking guy, but he's a really talented composer,

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and he just wants to compose things for his precious lady love,

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
who is way too young for him, but is maybe kind of talented,

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
maybe not that talented, but he thinks she's really talented, okay?

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But that wasn't so innovative.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Brian De Palma did that, too.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What was Andrew Lloyd Webber's really big innovation?

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That huge, million-dollar idea that finally elevates Phantom of the Opera

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
to blockbuster status is that the Phantom is no longer a golem-y wretch,

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
but a misunderstood stud, and that Christine's kind of into it.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You could call the stage musical, this stage musical,

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
a culmination of all of the previous versions,

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
because it takes inspiration not just from the book,

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
but almost everything else that came before it.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Phantom continues to be a cultural phenomenon to this day

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
because of the stage musical, which is still running.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Has your mom been to New York and seen exactly one Broadway show?

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
She's seen Phantom.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Or The Lion King.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Everyone's mom and all the sad teenage girls love Phantom of the Opera.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Not that I would know.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But in a post-Broadway musical world,

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Phantom of the Opera wasn't something like, say, Avatar.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Remember that James Cameron movie?

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It wasn't a trend that came and went away.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's been here pretty steadily for the last 30 years.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And this is honestly kind of difficult to keep this to a character profile,

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
even more now than the last episode,

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
because the character is so tied in with the franchise.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But I will try to restrain my tangenting ways.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Here we go.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Phantom of the Opera, after Lloyd Wittman.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll start with what you probably already know.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Phantom of the Opera.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
is the most financially successful musical in history,

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
with a worldwide gross nearly twice that of all four of the Transformers movies,

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and it is also the longest-running musical in Broadway history.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It won the Tony for Best Musical in 1988,

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
which beat Into the Woods,

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and a lot of musical theater fans are still salty about that.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Poo-poo on the sucker, but let's be real, guys.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
There is a reason it's still running.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's kind of the perfect musical in the same way that, like,

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Independence Day is a perfect movie.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh, boys!

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Civilization will fall, and Phantom of the Opera will still be running.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Watch it close, like, a week after this goes up.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical was of course not the last version of Phantom by any stretch,

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
but all of the weird and wonderful knockoffs we'll be covering today

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
are inspired by this much more than, say, the Lon Chaney version,

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
or the Claude Rains version.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
After the musical, we start seeing that half-mask,

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
right here,

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
as the iconic thing rather than, like, the full mask as we would see before.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Even though the full mask is on the official logo of the Broadway musical,

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
this comes from the logo being set in stone before the wardrobe was,

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and that half-mask,

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
that was because Michael Crawford's microphone didn't jive with the full mask,

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and so the half-mask and the deformity were kind of built around the microphone.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What makes this version work the best

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
is the fact that the Phantom isn't in it all that much.

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
A little goes a long way, but when he is in it,

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
oh, the feelings!

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
No! Damn you!

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Christine unmasks him and he flies into a rage!

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This low sim carpoil!

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And then for 30 seconds it's like,

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
blue, blue, blue, please love me,

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and then 30 seconds after that, he's fine,

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and we're going back upstairs.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And this is one of the things that is so difficult for film adaptations to capture.

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The musical format allows these mood swings to work

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
in a really, really compressed amount of time.

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's part of why Les Mis the musical works so much better

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
than Les Mis the movie musical,

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
but we'll get to the movie musical later.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
As always, Eric is an emotional mess in the stage musical,

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
but how this is played, the characterization,

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
really is based on the actor.

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
For instance, a guy like Hugh Pinero is more on the

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
me-he-he-he-I'm-evil end,

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and guys like John Owen Jones are more on the

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
sad puppy end.

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Norm Lewis kind of gives him a more dad affect,

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
and Ramin Karimloo, he just has a lot of feelings, okay?

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't ever leave me!

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Or if you go way back, before the musical,

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
you get the rock god Phantom Steve Harley.

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He was never in the musical, so I can't speak to him much,

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
although he was originally going to be Michael Crawford,

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
but then Michael Crawford replaced him.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Sorry, dude.

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But that hella electric guitar riff.

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Now the musical is the new benchmark,

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
the new theme to be ripped off,

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
and suddenly we have a lot more Phantom adaptations

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
in the wake of a hit Broadway musical.

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Hey, it's the mid-80s, and VCRs are becoming

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
an increasingly popular form of babysitting.

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
How about Phantom of the Opera for kids?

117
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This is nowhere near as hilarious as it sounds,

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
except insofar as it had a budget of, like, two,

119
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and the animation is terrible.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
While the novel isn't really violent and has zero sex,

121
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
it isn't really, you know, interesting to kids either.

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So this, rather than being a kiddified version of the book,

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
is basically just the book.

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But boy, did they not have the budget to give him

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
a scary face or more than five facial expressions.

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So since this one's also one of the closest to the books

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
of all the adaptations,

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
it gets that I've learned the error of my ways thing in there.

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But that is apparently not a terribly satisfactory ending,

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
so rocks falls and he dies.

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Next.

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm sorry about the way I look.

133
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I know I said I'm not going to go into every post-musical version

134
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
because there are a ton, but I have to give a nod

135
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
to Phantom of the Mall.

136
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Eric's Revenge.

137
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This is, um, it's actually a horror movie?

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Eric with a C is your average sexy high school athlete

139
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
with a family who happens to have a house on land

140
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
that is coveted by a mall development.

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So when Eric's family won't sell,

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
the mall people will sell the house.

143
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The mall people send a hitman to kill Eric's family by burning

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
so they could build that mall unfettered.

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Morgan Fairchild plays the bad guy.

146
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Pauly Shore is the Persian analog.

147
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And Eric doesn't compose, he works out.

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He doesn't use a Punjab lasso, he roundhouse kicks his enemies.

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And when Christine wakes up in his lair,

150
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
he's not playing the organ.

151
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He's lifting.

152
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Hello, Eric.

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That alone deserves a modest slow clap.

154
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Next.

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes.

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
People are often surprised to learn that Freddy Krueger himself,

157
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Robert England, starred in this version

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
at the height of both Nightmare on Elm Street

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
and the popularity of the Broadway musical.

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And it is a shameless ripoff of both.

161
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
This one includes the odd element of Christine being a modern

162
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
who is like the reincarnation of 1880s Christine.

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And she goes back in time to relive the whole Phantom thing.

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Why the modern plot is in there, I don't know.

165
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
This Eric has sold his soul to the devil.

166
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
See, he's a great composer, but the soul selling made him ugg.

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So he kills people every few days or so

168
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and sews skin onto his Freddy Krueger face.

169
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
He has bad puns like any Freddy Krueger.

170
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And, of course, Freddy Krueger's oh face with his killgasm.

171
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
This version is the most evil Phantom

172
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and therefore the least interested in his Christine.

173
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
From a filmmaking standpoint, he doesn't seem to want her at all.

174
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
They're almost never in the same shot together.

175
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And in this version, he also solicits prostitutes.

176
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
My name is Maddie.

177
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You haven't been doing this for very long, have you?

178
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Well, I find this remarkable in that it is the super rare horror movie

179
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
where sex workers don't get punished for being sex workers.

180
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This version, on the whole, is surprisingly disappointing,

181
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
considering what it is.

182
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Because it's boring, not because it's gross.

183
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But it is really gross.

184
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Where do you live?

185
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
When you sing, I live in the heavens.

186
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And when you do not, down below.

187
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
From Freddy Krueger, we go to Tywin Lannister.

188
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yet, before he was the lord of Casterly Rock,

189
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Charles Dance did a turn as the Phantom 2.

190
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
This was a TV movie that was based on a musical

191
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
by Maury Yeston and Arthur Coppett of Nine fame.

192
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This one's pretty similar to their musical,

193
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
minus, you know, being a musical.

194
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And believe it or not, this musical actually predated

195
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Lloyd Webber's version in terms of when it was started.

196
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But for a variety of reasons, it didn't premiere until 1991,

197
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
after they produced the TV movie, based on the then-unproduced musical.

198
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And this is honestly one of the better versions.

199
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Ignoring the part where it is way too freaking long.

200
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Seriously, it's three hours.

201
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Dance plays Eric more vulnerable and sensitive than Tywin-y.

202
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm just not used to killing people.

203
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Just throw me off a bit.

204
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Once again, there's no Persian.

205
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Instead, he's got a dad.

206
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I mean, he doesn't know that Burt Lancaster is his dad,

207
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
but his dad does.

208
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Which kind of detracts from the tragedy a bit.

209
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
A lot. It detracts a lot.

210
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Because Eric's not alone.

211
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
He's got Burt Lancaster watching out for him the whole movie.

212
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So it's really hard to feel sorry for him

213
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
when he's basically living on daddy's credit card under the opera house.

214
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
This is also the only version where we don't see his face at all.

215
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Does this work?

216
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Kinda? A little?

217
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Honestly, it feels more like a cop-out.

218
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But it's also the only version where he punches a fake deer in the face.

219
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Let's watch that again.

220
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Dario Argento's Italian horror version,

221
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
aka the version with the rat sex scene,

222
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
aka the absolute worst one, period.

223
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This one makes the 2004 movie look great.

224
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Remember how in Batman Returns the penguin was raised by sewer penguins?

225
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Well, this phantom was raised by rats.

226
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Also, he's not deformed at all.

227
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Shruggles.

228
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's an internal kind of ugliness.

229
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I don't know.

230
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I assume he looks normal because the director didn't want to have a hot, steamy sex scene

231
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
starring his actual IRL daughter with an uggo.

232
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
He's also the only version that just straight-up rapes his Christine,

233
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
so he keeps racking up the worst one points.

234
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Worst one.

235
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
In fairness, being raised by sewer rats makes a tiny bit more sense than sewer penguins.

236
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Boy, does this phantom love him some rats.

237
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And he will murder you if you come after his rats.

238
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And in the end, Christine's really hot for him, but...

239
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Christine!

240
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Oh, no, not my raised-by-rats rapist.

241
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Okay, but now we're really going to get into it.

242
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You have come here

243
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
for one purpose and one alone

244
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Woof.

245
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Joel Schumacher of Batman and Robin fame was always Lord Andy's top choice to direct

246
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
because Lord Andy is the grand poobah of terrible decisions

247
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
once he's old enough to start drawing Retirement.

248
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And boy could I harp on the technical ineptitude of Joel Schumacher's filmmaking choices

249
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
in this shitstorm of a movie, but let's stick to the topic at hand.

250
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And I know a lot of people like this version,

251
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
so if you don't want to watch me rag on Gerard Butler for five minutes,

252
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
just skip to this timecode here.

253
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The movie adaptation of the Broadway musical features Z-grade Tom Waits impersonator Gerard Butler

254
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
as the most bewilderingly miscast phantom yet.

255
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
When you look at the other Phantom adaptations, at least some of the worst ones,

256
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
at least they knew what they were going for.

257
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
They had a vision and they stuck to it.

258
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What the hell were they thinking trying to fit a Gerard Butler-shaped peg

259
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
into a person-who-can-sing-shaped hole?

260
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
This is the point of no return!

261
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Curse you! You little lying Delilah!

262
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Here is where Gerard Butler belongs.

263
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Or here.

264
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
No, no, no.

265
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yes?

266
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
No.

267
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
No, God, no.

268
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Okay.

269
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Focus.

270
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Ignoring the fact that the man with the perfect tenor cannot sing,

271
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I wouldn't characterize Butler's Phantom as particularly sexual either,

272
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
possibly owing to the fact that our lead actress was underage at the time,

273
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
but his Phantom is more of a petulant child.

274
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
In no other version, for instance, does he play with dolls.

275
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Like, where did this come from?

276
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Though the relative sexlessness may be part of the draw,

277
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
in the same way, you know, Edward Cullen is a draw,

278
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
this movie fixes a lot of the logical problems from the musical,

279
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
but then creates all new ones.

280
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
A big addition in the movie is a sword fight between Eric and Raoul,

281
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
which Raoul promptly wins.

282
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
God, how did you survive on your own this long, dude?

283
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That shit is caught.

284
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You have been caught.

285
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
No, no, apparently not.

286
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Now, let it be war upon you both.

287
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And in the very next scene, Raoul's like,

288
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and now I know how to catch him.

289
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
To ensnare our clever friend.

290
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So during the scene featuring Dread Pirate Roberts and the Tango Dancers,

291
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
oh God.

292
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
This fucking movie.

293
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So, after Dread Pirate Roberts and the Tango Dancers

294
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
in front of the PA waving flames in the background,

295
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Christine rips off his full head of hair to reveal another full head of hair

296
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
and a deformity that amounts to, like, I don't know,

297
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
maybe he had some shellfish that didn't agree with him.

298
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
This feisty infection which poisons our love.

299
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
She's like, really?

300
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
That's what you're all worked up about?

301
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
This is your reason for abandoning society?

302
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
This is what got you caged and put in a freak show?

303
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Like, you got stung by a bee, you're fine.

304
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You get the impression that Butler knows his deformity is not even really a deformity

305
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
because he really tries to compensate with ultra crazy face,

306
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
but really nothing compelling or tragic here when she kisses him.

307
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm glad you can bear to kiss me despite my pink eye.

308
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And the beat of him letting her go is apparently not enough

309
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
to impart his man pain for Joel Schumacher.

310
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Oh no.

311
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
This movie ends with him breaking all of the mirrors.

312
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Every single one.

313
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Metaphor.

314
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So, as watchably awful as the 2004 movie is,

315
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
the rabbit hole goes deeper still as we reach the coup de grace

316
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
of this whole shit show, the piece de resistance.

317
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I mean, the movie did...

318
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Okay.

319
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I mean, it got a theatrical release.

320
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And the show is now the longest running one ever,

321
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
so did someone say...

322
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
sequel?

323
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Want to dissuade your kids from majoring in musical theater?

324
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Murder that dream in its crib?

325
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Love Never Dies.

326
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The worst musical I've ever seen.

327
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And I've seen Lestat the musical.

328
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Twice.

329
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Ten years on and Eric has apparently jumped ship on living in France

330
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
and immigrated to Coney Island

331
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
where he owns a theme park slash freaks show slash opera type thing.

332
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And now he's got his empire all set up.

333
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
He's ready to lure Christine out in order to win her back

334
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
for realsies this time.

335
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The passion.

336
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
The romance.

337
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The milking of the giant cow.

338
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Thrill as Eric pours Raoul a drink as their dick wagging contest

339
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
enters its second decade.

340
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Real as Eric and Christine sing a song about how they had sex that one time

341
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
off screen somewhere.

342
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And I caught you.

343
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And I kissed you.

344
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And I took you.

345
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And I pegged you.

346
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
The version you can find on DVD, by the way,

347
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
is basically version like 35.6.0

348
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
as this show was workshopped a lot.

349
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So this isn't really even the definitive version.

350
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's just a version.

351
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Instead of The Phantom, he goes by Mr. Why.

352
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Mr. Why welcomes you.

353
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
So Christine and the fam come to Coney Island because they need money.

354
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And this might seem petty in the grand scheme of the show's shittiness,

355
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
but how does Christine not immediately recognize that something is wrong

356
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
when a Tim Burton carriage pulls up with Alan Cumming and Uncle Fester in tow?

357
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Climb aboard.

358
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Did somebody call for a nightmare?

359
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
As soon as Eric gets her alone, they sing this ten-minute dirge

360
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
about how they had sex once.

361
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
As you do.

362
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Then, surprise, guess whose kid that is.

363
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Ten years old.

364
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So, Eric, let's ask the serious question.

365
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What's different from the first musical?

366
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What's missing?

367
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
He's a jerkass in both of them, sure.

368
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
But in the first one, he's sympathetic because he's deprived.

369
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And while his actions aren't condonable, they are still motivated.

370
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
In Love Never Dies, The Phantom has

371
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
A. A huge support network.

372
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
B. Successful business.

373
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
C. Lots of money.

374
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
D. Already banged Christine.

375
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
E. A fucking kid he didn't even have to raise.

376
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
F. Is a massive asshole anyway.

377
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
All your progeny may disappear.

378
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Our hero threatens to murder Christine's child.

379
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So romantic.

380
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Leaves are crying.

381
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What a man.

382
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I guess Fifty Shades of Grey fans would like it.

383
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's like it took everything about the first show that made it work despite itself

384
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
and chucked it out the window.

385
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
He basically ruins all of the other characters' lives Heathcliff-style.

386
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
But he's our hero now.

387
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
To be fair, I'm at a loss as to where the story could have gone.

388
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The story of Eric and Christine is done when he lets Christine go.

389
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It is emotionally complete in a way that not many stories are.

390
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Continuing the story of Eric and Christine is just redundant.

391
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's over.

392
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
The mere existence of Love Never Dies makes the story beat of The Phantom

393
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
putting someone else's needs before his own.

394
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Just destroys it.

395
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Just gone.

396
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Bye.

397
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Phantom's character arc, in the good versions anyway, is about maturation.

398
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
He is a genius in some regards, sure.

399
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But in the realm of interhuman contact, of love, he is a child.

400
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
He never made it past toddlerhood.

401
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Now let there be war!

402
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Upon you both!

403
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Now!

404
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Oh sure, just because I'm shooting fireballs at you, you abandon me.

405
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Well fine, I'll kill everybody.

406
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Because he's never been shown love or compassion himself.

407
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Other people are basically toys to him.

408
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
That's kind of a thing that happens.

409
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The act of him letting Christine go is the first time in his life

410
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
that he really recognizes someone else's humanity.

411
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
That act of self-sacrifice, of putting someone else's needs before his own,

412
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
is one of the most painful lessons that he or anyone can learn.

413
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
That is adulthood.

414
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The world show no compassion to me!

415
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Toxic people are toxic for a reason.

416
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Their lives probably sucked, making them into toxic, abusive opera ghosts.

417
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
That does not mean that they are not worthy of love,

418
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
or that they cannot learn to be better people.

419
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
But just because your life sucked doesn't mean you can march up to people

420
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
and declare that they owe you something.

421
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So while many claim that it's this tragic story about repressed sexuality or something,

422
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I don't see it that way.

423
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I see it as a coming-of-age story for a 50-year-old man,

424
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
which is why I see Eric voluntarily letting Christine go as such an important character beat.

425
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
That is the moment he finally grows up.

426
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
The moment he realizes that, yeah, his life has sucked,

427
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
but that doesn't give him the license to make people his playthings.

428
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
So, f**k Love Never Dies, and it's stupid existing,

429
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
but I highly recommend it for your bad movie nights.

430
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It is pretty Larry-awful.

431
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Bad Larry-ous.

432
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So, to conclude, is there a really great version of The Phantom of the Opera?

433
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
No.

434
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
But there are compelling versions.

435
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Obviously, this is all very subjective,

436
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
but because people ask, for my money,

437
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
the 25th Anniversary Live at the Royal Albert Hall version

438
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
is pretty much the closest to a definitive version you're going to find.

439
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess are my favorite Phantom and Christine, respectively,

440
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
and here they are at the same time.

441
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And it is far from the deepest musical you're ever going to find,

442
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
but I'm just saying, it's still running for a reason.

443
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
So, that wraps up my Phantom-opus, maybe?

444
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Like I said, that could go on.

445
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
But we're going to move on from that topic.

446
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
The voted theme for the next round is

447
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000

448
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Yeah, so here are your options.

449
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Vote well, vote strong.

450
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000

and I will see you next time.

457
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
