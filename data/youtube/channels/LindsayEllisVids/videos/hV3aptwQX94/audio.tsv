0	5000	Once upon a time, there was this brilliant composer, not the best looking guy.
5000	10000	And one day, this beautiful, young, chestnut-haired, singing and dancing ingenue
10000	13000	floats into his life, and he falls in love with her.
13000	17000	And he decides, I'm going to take you under my wing, and tutor you,
17000	20000	and compose this incredible masterwork for you to star in.
20000	26000	And she was enthralled at first, but then in the end, it didn't work out too well.
26000	30000	I'm talking, of course, about the tragic, torrid tale
30000	33000	of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Sarah Brightman.
33000	35000	During the creation of what would eventually become
35000	39000	the longest-running Broadway show in musical theater history.
39000	41000	Gentlemen!
45000	48000	Lord Andy decided that his version of Phantom of the Opera
48000	51000	would feature the angle of, hey, why don't we look at the things
51000	53000	from the Phantom's point of view, okay?
53000	55000	He has needs, too, alright?
55000	58000	Maybe he's not the best looking guy, but he's a really talented composer,
58000	61000	and he just wants to compose things for his precious lady love,
61000	65000	who is way too young for him, but is maybe kind of talented,
65000	68000	maybe not that talented, but he thinks she's really talented, okay?
68000	70000	But that wasn't so innovative.
70000	72000	Brian De Palma did that, too.
72000	76000	What was Andrew Lloyd Webber's really big innovation?
76000	80000	That huge, million-dollar idea that finally elevates Phantom of the Opera
80000	84000	to blockbuster status is that the Phantom is no longer a golem-y wretch,
84000	88000	but a misunderstood stud, and that Christine's kind of into it.
92000	95000	You could call the stage musical, this stage musical,
95000	97000	a culmination of all of the previous versions,
97000	100000	because it takes inspiration not just from the book,
100000	102000	but almost everything else that came before it.
102000	105000	Phantom continues to be a cultural phenomenon to this day
105000	109000	because of the stage musical, which is still running.
109000	112000	Has your mom been to New York and seen exactly one Broadway show?
112000	114000	She's seen Phantom.
114000	115000	Or The Lion King.
115000	120000	Everyone's mom and all the sad teenage girls love Phantom of the Opera.
120000	123000	Not that I would know.
123000	126000	But in a post-Broadway musical world,
126000	130000	Phantom of the Opera wasn't something like, say, Avatar.
130000	132000	Remember that James Cameron movie?
132000	134000	It wasn't a trend that came and went away.
134000	137000	It's been here pretty steadily for the last 30 years.
137000	141000	And this is honestly kind of difficult to keep this to a character profile,
141000	143000	even more now than the last episode,
143000	145000	because the character is so tied in with the franchise.
145000	148000	But I will try to restrain my tangenting ways.
148000	150000	Here we go.
150000	153000	Phantom of the Opera, after Lloyd Wittman.
163000	165000	I'll start with what you probably already know.
168000	170000	Phantom of the Opera.
170000	172000	Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera
172000	175000	is the most financially successful musical in history,
175000	180000	with a worldwide gross nearly twice that of all four of the Transformers movies,
180000	183000	and it is also the longest-running musical in Broadway history.
183000	186000	It won the Tony for Best Musical in 1988,
186000	188000	which beat Into the Woods,
188000	192000	and a lot of musical theater fans are still salty about that.
192000	194000	Poo-poo on the sucker, but let's be real, guys.
194000	196000	There is a reason it's still running.
196000	200000	It's kind of the perfect musical in the same way that, like,
200000	203000	Independence Day is a perfect movie.
203000	205000	Oh, boys!
205000	209000	Civilization will fall, and Phantom of the Opera will still be running.
209000	212000	Watch it close, like, a week after this goes up.
212000	216000	Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical was of course not the last version of Phantom by any stretch,
216000	219000	but all of the weird and wonderful knockoffs we'll be covering today
219000	223000	are inspired by this much more than, say, the Lon Chaney version,
223000	225000	or the Claude Rains version.
225000	228000	After the musical, we start seeing that half-mask,
229000	230000	right here,
230000	235000	as the iconic thing rather than, like, the full mask as we would see before.
235000	239000	Even though the full mask is on the official logo of the Broadway musical,
239000	242000	this comes from the logo being set in stone before the wardrobe was,
242000	244000	and that half-mask,
244000	247000	that was because Michael Crawford's microphone didn't jive with the full mask,
247000	253000	and so the half-mask and the deformity were kind of built around the microphone.
254000	256000	What makes this version work the best
256000	259000	is the fact that the Phantom isn't in it all that much.
259000	261000	A little goes a long way, but when he is in it,
261000	263000	oh, the feelings!
263000	266000	No! Damn you!
266000	269000	Christine unmasks him and he flies into a rage!
269000	273000	This low sim carpoil!
273000	274000	And then for 30 seconds it's like,
274000	276000	blue, blue, blue, please love me,
276000	278000	and then 30 seconds after that, he's fine,
278000	280000	and we're going back upstairs.
280000	285000	And this is one of the things that is so difficult for film adaptations to capture.
285000	288000	The musical format allows these mood swings to work
288000	291000	in a really, really compressed amount of time.
291000	294000	That's part of why Les Mis the musical works so much better
294000	296000	than Les Mis the movie musical,
296000	299000	but we'll get to the movie musical later.
299000	302000	As always, Eric is an emotional mess in the stage musical,
302000	304000	but how this is played, the characterization,
304000	306000	really is based on the actor.
306000	309000	For instance, a guy like Hugh Pinero is more on the
309000	312000	me-he-he-he-I'm-evil end,
312000	314000	and guys like John Owen Jones are more on the
314000	315000	sad puppy end.
315000	319000	Norm Lewis kind of gives him a more dad affect,
319000	322000	and Ramin Karimloo, he just has a lot of feelings, okay?
322000	328000	Don't ever leave me!
328000	331000	Or if you go way back, before the musical,
331000	334000	you get the rock god Phantom Steve Harley.
335000	339000	He was never in the musical, so I can't speak to him much,
339000	342000	although he was originally going to be Michael Crawford,
342000	344000	but then Michael Crawford replaced him.
344000	345000	Sorry, dude.
345000	347000	But that hella electric guitar riff.
351000	353000	Now the musical is the new benchmark,
353000	355000	the new theme to be ripped off,
355000	358000	and suddenly we have a lot more Phantom adaptations
358000	361000	in the wake of a hit Broadway musical.
364000	367000	Hey, it's the mid-80s, and VCRs are becoming
367000	369000	an increasingly popular form of babysitting.
369000	372000	How about Phantom of the Opera for kids?
372000	374000	This is nowhere near as hilarious as it sounds,
374000	377000	except insofar as it had a budget of, like, two,
377000	379000	and the animation is terrible.
379000	382000	While the novel isn't really violent and has zero sex,
382000	385000	it isn't really, you know, interesting to kids either.
385000	388000	So this, rather than being a kiddified version of the book,
388000	390000	is basically just the book.
390000	392000	But boy, did they not have the budget to give him
392000	396000	a scary face or more than five facial expressions.
396000	398000	So since this one's also one of the closest to the books
398000	400000	of all the adaptations,
400000	403000	it gets that I've learned the error of my ways thing in there.
403000	408000	But that is apparently not a terribly satisfactory ending,
408000	411000	so rocks falls and he dies.
415000	416000	Next.
417000	419000	I'm sorry about the way I look.
419000	422000	I know I said I'm not going to go into every post-musical version
422000	424000	because there are a ton, but I have to give a nod
424000	426000	to Phantom of the Mall.
426000	427000	Eric's Revenge.
427000	430000	This is, um, it's actually a horror movie?
430000	433000	Eric with a C is your average sexy high school athlete
433000	436000	with a family who happens to have a house on land
436000	439000	that is coveted by a mall development.
439000	442000	So when Eric's family won't sell,
442000	444000	the mall people will sell the house.
445000	449000	The mall people send a hitman to kill Eric's family by burning
449000	452000	so they could build that mall unfettered.
452000	455000	Morgan Fairchild plays the bad guy.
455000	457000	Pauly Shore is the Persian analog.
457000	460000	And Eric doesn't compose, he works out.
460000	464000	He doesn't use a Punjab lasso, he roundhouse kicks his enemies.
465000	467000	And when Christine wakes up in his lair,
467000	469000	he's not playing the organ.
469000	471000	He's lifting.
472000	473000	Hello, Eric.
475000	478000	That alone deserves a modest slow clap.
479000	480000	Next.
485000	486000	Yes.
486000	489000	People are often surprised to learn that Freddy Krueger himself,
489000	491000	Robert England, starred in this version
491000	493000	at the height of both Nightmare on Elm Street
493000	495000	and the popularity of the Broadway musical.
495000	498000	And it is a shameless ripoff of both.
498000	502000	This one includes the odd element of Christine being a modern
502000	506000	who is like the reincarnation of 1880s Christine.
506000	509000	And she goes back in time to relive the whole Phantom thing.
509000	513000	Why the modern plot is in there, I don't know.
513000	515000	This Eric has sold his soul to the devil.
515000	519000	See, he's a great composer, but the soul selling made him ugg.
519000	522000	So he kills people every few days or so
522000	525000	and sews skin onto his Freddy Krueger face.
525000	527000	He has bad puns like any Freddy Krueger.
529000	534000	And, of course, Freddy Krueger's oh face with his killgasm.
534000	536000	This version is the most evil Phantom
536000	539000	and therefore the least interested in his Christine.
539000	543000	From a filmmaking standpoint, he doesn't seem to want her at all.
543000	545000	They're almost never in the same shot together.
545000	547000	And in this version, he also solicits prostitutes.
549000	550000	My name is Maddie.
550000	553000	You haven't been doing this for very long, have you?
553000	557000	Well, I find this remarkable in that it is the super rare horror movie
557000	560000	where sex workers don't get punished for being sex workers.
560000	564000	This version, on the whole, is surprisingly disappointing,
564000	565000	considering what it is.
565000	567000	Because it's boring, not because it's gross.
567000	569000	But it is really gross.
570000	571000	Where do you live?
573000	575000	When you sing, I live in the heavens.
575000	578000	And when you do not, down below.
579000	583000	From Freddy Krueger, we go to Tywin Lannister.
583000	585000	Yet, before he was the lord of Casterly Rock,
585000	588000	Charles Dance did a turn as the Phantom 2.
588000	590000	This was a TV movie that was based on a musical
590000	594000	by Maury Yeston and Arthur Coppett of Nine fame.
594000	597000	This one's pretty similar to their musical,
597000	599000	minus, you know, being a musical.
599000	601000	And believe it or not, this musical actually predated
601000	604000	Lloyd Webber's version in terms of when it was started.
604000	607000	But for a variety of reasons, it didn't premiere until 1991,
607000	612000	after they produced the TV movie, based on the then-unproduced musical.
612000	614000	And this is honestly one of the better versions.
614000	617000	Ignoring the part where it is way too freaking long.
617000	619000	Seriously, it's three hours.
619000	623000	Dance plays Eric more vulnerable and sensitive than Tywin-y.
623000	625000	I'm just not used to killing people.
625000	627000	Just throw me off a bit.
627000	628000	Once again, there's no Persian.
628000	630000	Instead, he's got a dad.
630000	633000	I mean, he doesn't know that Burt Lancaster is his dad,
633000	634000	but his dad does.
634000	637000	Which kind of detracts from the tragedy a bit.
637000	639000	A lot. It detracts a lot.
639000	641000	Because Eric's not alone.
641000	644000	He's got Burt Lancaster watching out for him the whole movie.
644000	647000	So it's really hard to feel sorry for him
647000	650000	when he's basically living on daddy's credit card under the opera house.
650000	654000	This is also the only version where we don't see his face at all.
654000	656000	Does this work?
656000	657000	Kinda? A little?
657000	660000	Honestly, it feels more like a cop-out.
660000	664000	But it's also the only version where he punches a fake deer in the face.
665000	667000	Let's watch that again.
672000	676000	Dario Argento's Italian horror version,
676000	679000	aka the version with the rat sex scene,
679000	682000	aka the absolute worst one, period.
682000	685000	This one makes the 2004 movie look great.
685000	690000	Remember how in Batman Returns the penguin was raised by sewer penguins?
690000	693000	Well, this phantom was raised by rats.
693000	696000	Also, he's not deformed at all.
696000	697000	Shruggles.
697000	699000	It's an internal kind of ugliness.
699000	700000	I don't know.
700000	705000	I assume he looks normal because the director didn't want to have a hot, steamy sex scene
705000	708000	starring his actual IRL daughter with an uggo.
708000	711000	He's also the only version that just straight-up rapes his Christine,
711000	715000	so he keeps racking up the worst one points.
715000	716000	Worst one.
716000	722000	In fairness, being raised by sewer rats makes a tiny bit more sense than sewer penguins.
722000	725000	Boy, does this phantom love him some rats.
725000	728000	And he will murder you if you come after his rats.
728000	731000	And in the end, Christine's really hot for him, but...
731000	733000	Christine!
733000	736000	Oh, no, not my raised-by-rats rapist.
736000	740000	Okay, but now we're really going to get into it.
740000	745000	You have come here
745000	749000	for one purpose and one alone
749000	750000	Woof.
750000	756000	Joel Schumacher of Batman and Robin fame was always Lord Andy's top choice to direct
756000	759000	because Lord Andy is the grand poobah of terrible decisions
759000	762000	once he's old enough to start drawing Retirement.
762000	767000	And boy could I harp on the technical ineptitude of Joel Schumacher's filmmaking choices
767000	772000	in this shitstorm of a movie, but let's stick to the topic at hand.
772000	774000	And I know a lot of people like this version,
774000	778000	so if you don't want to watch me rag on Gerard Butler for five minutes,
778000	781000	just skip to this timecode here.
781000	787000	The movie adaptation of the Broadway musical features Z-grade Tom Waits impersonator Gerard Butler
787000	791000	as the most bewilderingly miscast phantom yet.
791000	795000	When you look at the other Phantom adaptations, at least some of the worst ones,
795000	797000	at least they knew what they were going for.
797000	799000	They had a vision and they stuck to it.
799000	804000	What the hell were they thinking trying to fit a Gerard Butler-shaped peg
804000	807000	into a person-who-can-sing-shaped hole?
807000	813000	This is the point of no return!
838000	842000	Curse you! You little lying Delilah!
860000	862000	Here is where Gerard Butler belongs.
862000	863000	Or here.
863000	864000	No, no, no.
864000	865000	Yes?
865000	866000	No.
866000	867000	No, God, no.
867000	868000	Okay.
868000	869000	Focus.
869000	872000	Ignoring the fact that the man with the perfect tenor cannot sing,
872000	876000	I wouldn't characterize Butler's Phantom as particularly sexual either,
876000	880000	possibly owing to the fact that our lead actress was underage at the time,
880000	883000	but his Phantom is more of a petulant child.
883000	886000	In no other version, for instance, does he play with dolls.
886000	889000	Like, where did this come from?
889000	892000	Though the relative sexlessness may be part of the draw,
892000	895000	in the same way, you know, Edward Cullen is a draw,
895000	898000	this movie fixes a lot of the logical problems from the musical,
898000	900000	but then creates all new ones.
900000	903000	A big addition in the movie is a sword fight between Eric and Raoul,
903000	906000	which Raoul promptly wins.
906000	909000	God, how did you survive on your own this long, dude?
909000	911000	That shit is caught.
911000	912000	You have been caught.
912000	913000	No, no, apparently not.
913000	917000	Now, let it be war upon you both.
917000	919000	And in the very next scene, Raoul's like,
919000	920000	and now I know how to catch him.
920000	922000	To ensnare our clever friend.
922000	925000	So during the scene featuring Dread Pirate Roberts and the Tango Dancers,
925000	928000	oh God.
928000	930000	This fucking movie.
930000	934000	So, after Dread Pirate Roberts and the Tango Dancers
934000	937000	in front of the PA waving flames in the background,
937000	942000	Christine rips off his full head of hair to reveal another full head of hair
942000	945000	and a deformity that amounts to, like, I don't know,
945000	948000	maybe he had some shellfish that didn't agree with him.
948000	954000	This feisty infection which poisons our love.
954000	955000	She's like, really?
955000	957000	That's what you're all worked up about?
957000	960000	This is your reason for abandoning society?
960000	963000	This is what got you caged and put in a freak show?
963000	966000	Like, you got stung by a bee, you're fine.
966000	971000	You get the impression that Butler knows his deformity is not even really a deformity
971000	975000	because he really tries to compensate with ultra crazy face,
975000	979000	but really nothing compelling or tragic here when she kisses him.
979000	982000	I'm glad you can bear to kiss me despite my pink eye.
982000	985000	And the beat of him letting her go is apparently not enough
985000	987000	to impart his man pain for Joel Schumacher.
987000	988000	Oh no.
988000	992000	This movie ends with him breaking all of the mirrors.
992000	994000	Every single one.
994000	996000	Metaphor.
996000	999000	So, as watchably awful as the 2004 movie is,
999000	1003000	the rabbit hole goes deeper still as we reach the coup de grace
1003000	1007000	of this whole shit show, the piece de resistance.
1007000	1009000	I mean, the movie did...
1009000	1010000	Okay.
1010000	1013000	I mean, it got a theatrical release.
1013000	1016000	And the show is now the longest running one ever,
1016000	1019000	so did someone say...
1019000	1021000	sequel?
1027000	1030000	Want to dissuade your kids from majoring in musical theater?
1030000	1032000	Murder that dream in its crib?
1032000	1034000	Love Never Dies.
1034000	1036000	The worst musical I've ever seen.
1036000	1038000	And I've seen Lestat the musical.
1038000	1039000	Twice.
1039000	1043000	Ten years on and Eric has apparently jumped ship on living in France
1043000	1045000	and immigrated to Coney Island
1045000	1051000	where he owns a theme park slash freaks show slash opera type thing.
1051000	1054000	And now he's got his empire all set up.
1054000	1057000	He's ready to lure Christine out in order to win her back
1057000	1058000	for realsies this time.
1058000	1059000	The passion.
1059000	1060000	The romance.
1060000	1062000	The milking of the giant cow.
1062000	1066000	Thrill as Eric pours Raoul a drink as their dick wagging contest
1066000	1068000	enters its second decade.
1068000	1072000	Real as Eric and Christine sing a song about how they had sex that one time
1072000	1073000	off screen somewhere.
1073000	1075000	And I caught you.
1075000	1076000	And I kissed you.
1076000	1077000	And I took you.
1077000	1078000	And I pegged you.
1078000	1080000	The version you can find on DVD, by the way,
1080000	1083000	is basically version like 35.6.0
1083000	1086000	as this show was workshopped a lot.
1086000	1088000	So this isn't really even the definitive version.
1088000	1090000	It's just a version.
1090000	1094000	Instead of The Phantom, he goes by Mr. Why.
1094000	1097000	Mr. Why welcomes you.
1097000	1101000	So Christine and the fam come to Coney Island because they need money.
1101000	1105000	And this might seem petty in the grand scheme of the show's shittiness,
1105000	1108000	but how does Christine not immediately recognize that something is wrong
1108000	1113000	when a Tim Burton carriage pulls up with Alan Cumming and Uncle Fester in tow?
1113000	1115000	Climb aboard.
1115000	1118000	Did somebody call for a nightmare?
1118000	1121000	As soon as Eric gets her alone, they sing this ten-minute dirge
1121000	1123000	about how they had sex once.
1123000	1125000	As you do.
1125000	1128000	Then, surprise, guess whose kid that is.
1128000	1134000	Ten years old.
1134000	1138000	So, Eric, let's ask the serious question.
1138000	1141000	What's different from the first musical?
1141000	1143000	What's missing?
1143000	1145000	He's a jerkass in both of them, sure.
1145000	1148000	But in the first one, he's sympathetic because he's deprived.
1148000	1152000	And while his actions aren't condonable, they are still motivated.
1152000	1155000	In Love Never Dies, The Phantom has
1155000	1157000	A. A huge support network.
1157000	1158000	B. Successful business.
1158000	1159000	C. Lots of money.
1159000	1161000	D. Already banged Christine.
1161000	1164000	E. A fucking kid he didn't even have to raise.
1164000	1166000	F. Is a massive asshole anyway.
1166000	1172000	All your progeny may disappear.
1172000	1174000	Our hero threatens to murder Christine's child.
1174000	1176000	So romantic.
1176000	1177000	Leaves are crying.
1177000	1179000	What a man.
1179000	1181000	I guess Fifty Shades of Grey fans would like it.
1181000	1185000	It's like it took everything about the first show that made it work despite itself
1185000	1187000	and chucked it out the window.
1187000	1191000	He basically ruins all of the other characters' lives Heathcliff-style.
1191000	1193000	But he's our hero now.
1193000	1198000	To be fair, I'm at a loss as to where the story could have gone.
1198000	1202000	The story of Eric and Christine is done when he lets Christine go.
1202000	1205000	It is emotionally complete in a way that not many stories are.
1205000	1209000	Continuing the story of Eric and Christine is just redundant.
1209000	1210000	It's over.
1210000	1213000	The mere existence of Love Never Dies makes the story beat of The Phantom
1213000	1216000	putting someone else's needs before his own.
1216000	1217000	Just destroys it.
1217000	1218000	Just gone.
1218000	1219000	Bye.
1219000	1223000	Phantom's character arc, in the good versions anyway, is about maturation.
1223000	1225000	He is a genius in some regards, sure.
1225000	1230000	But in the realm of interhuman contact, of love, he is a child.
1230000	1232000	He never made it past toddlerhood.
1232000	1234000	Now let there be war!
1234000	1236000	Upon you both!
1236000	1237000	Now!
1237000	1242000	Oh sure, just because I'm shooting fireballs at you, you abandon me.
1242000	1244000	Well fine, I'll kill everybody.
1244000	1247000	Because he's never been shown love or compassion himself.
1247000	1249000	Other people are basically toys to him.
1249000	1251000	That's kind of a thing that happens.
1251000	1254000	The act of him letting Christine go is the first time in his life
1254000	1257000	that he really recognizes someone else's humanity.
1257000	1261000	That act of self-sacrifice, of putting someone else's needs before his own,
1261000	1265000	is one of the most painful lessons that he or anyone can learn.
1265000	1267000	That is adulthood.
1267000	1270000	The world show no compassion to me!
1270000	1272000	Toxic people are toxic for a reason.
1272000	1277000	Their lives probably sucked, making them into toxic, abusive opera ghosts.
1277000	1280000	That does not mean that they are not worthy of love,
1280000	1283000	or that they cannot learn to be better people.
1283000	1286000	But just because your life sucked doesn't mean you can march up to people
1286000	1288000	and declare that they owe you something.
1288000	1293000	So while many claim that it's this tragic story about repressed sexuality or something,
1293000	1294000	I don't see it that way.
1294000	1297000	I see it as a coming-of-age story for a 50-year-old man,
1297000	1302000	which is why I see Eric voluntarily letting Christine go as such an important character beat.
1302000	1304000	That is the moment he finally grows up.
1304000	1307000	The moment he realizes that, yeah, his life has sucked,
1307000	1311000	but that doesn't give him the license to make people his playthings.
1311000	1315000	So, f**k Love Never Dies, and it's stupid existing,
1315000	1318000	but I highly recommend it for your bad movie nights.
1318000	1322000	It is pretty Larry-awful.
1322000	1323000	Bad Larry-ous.
1323000	1328000	So, to conclude, is there a really great version of The Phantom of the Opera?
1328000	1329000	No.
1329000	1331000	But there are compelling versions.
1331000	1333000	Obviously, this is all very subjective,
1333000	1335000	but because people ask, for my money,
1335000	1338000	the 25th Anniversary Live at the Royal Albert Hall version
1338000	1341000	is pretty much the closest to a definitive version you're going to find.
1341000	1345000	Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess are my favorite Phantom and Christine, respectively,
1345000	1347000	and here they are at the same time.
1347000	1351000	And it is far from the deepest musical you're ever going to find,
1351000	1354000	but I'm just saying, it's still running for a reason.
1354000	1358000	So, that wraps up my Phantom-opus, maybe?
1358000	1361000	Like I said, that could go on.
1361000	1363000	But we're going to move on from that topic.
1363000	1368000	The voted theme for the next round is
1368000	1372000	historical people that actually existed and got fictionalized.
