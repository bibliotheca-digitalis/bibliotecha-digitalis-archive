0	8480	When, last we left our heroes, Frodo fell down a bunch, Gimli was short and it was funny,
8480	11240	and Andy Serkis got snobbed an Oscar nod.
11240	12240	Beliah!
12240	13240	I'm the thief!
13240	14240	It's mine!
14240	15240	I won it!
15240	16240	It was me!
16240	17880	Uh, wait, okay, hold back.
17880	20120	Metatextuality makes things even more complicated.
20120	21120	And you know what?
21120	25920	Regarding these movies, we could go on for hours and hours and years about all of their
25920	30520	influences and all of the outcomes, and there's a lot to go through.
30520	36760	But Return of the King, it's really long.
36760	43840	And when we're talking about market, the length of the film is pretty relevant, so
43840	46080	I'm going to pick up where I left off.
46080	49900	Last week, we talked about The Lord of the Rings and its impact on genre, but that wasn't
49900	50900	its only impact.
50900	54480	Before Lord of the Rings, it was pretty unheard of that you would film three gigantically
54480	58800	budgeted movies to be staggered over three years at the same time.
58800	64560	Now, with the right marketing strategy and the knowledge that it's a pre-existing property,
64560	66560	it's kind of a thing.
66560	70440	Lord of the Rings was unique in that they were all shot together from the start, which
70440	71800	tends not to be the case.
71800	75360	They usually wait till the franchise gets off the ground and then film two or three
75360	76360	at the same time.
76360	80040	It's odd to think that we live in a world now where sequels, especially two beloved
80040	83440	fantasy adaptations, are guaranteed to make more money.
83480	88480	That was seldom the case before, and they're all so longer in that recognizing a brand
88480	93480	to a property you're familiar with is more important in franchising than anything, really.
93480	97340	Obviously there are two stars colliding in this story, it wasn't just Lord of the Rings,
97340	102720	but the key here to these adapted franchises is the recognizability to the consumer.
102720	109480	These three movies, especially Return of the King, normalized the three-hour movie.
109480	112660	I'm the king of the world!
112660	117340	Before this trilogy, three-hour movies were the exception, not the rule.
117340	121700	Then this incredibly long monstrosity comes along, and three and a half hours, Return
121700	125580	of the King was the only one of the three movies to be the top-grossing film of its
125580	126580	year.
126580	128020	The other two only came in second.
128020	129020	And why have long movies?
129020	133460	After all, a really long movie reduces the number of showtimes you can cram in in any
133460	135340	given day.
135340	140900	Then again, a really long movie also drives out any incentive or time to see the competition.
142900	143900	Just sayin'.
143900	147220	All right, so we've got six hours of movie behind us and a whole bunch of plot threads
147220	151500	to wrap up in this, so the longest and the most peopled of the three movies.
151500	153540	Let's see where it takes us.
153540	159300	Return of the King is the end of the trilogy and all the stuff gets wrapped up, and some
159300	160300	doesn't.
160300	164460	It is a much more faithful adaptation than The Two Towers, but long as it is, a lot of
164460	167660	threads just get dropped utterly in the theatrical cut.
167660	171620	Like Eowyn's relationship to Aragorn, we haven't talked much about her yet, but she's coming.
171620	173460	She dumps her, and then that's that.
173460	176460	It is but a shadow on a throne that you love.
180460	182700	I cannot give you what you seek.
182700	188020	They introduce Gothmog, the big bad elephantiasis orc who ostensibly is in charge.
188020	193220	I don't like him, but he only gets an ending in the extended cut.
193220	196820	The extended cut of Return of the King is really, really long.
196820	198380	It's creeping up on five hours.
198380	199780	But I mean, it's good.
199780	201060	It's got a lot of good stuff in it.
201060	206860	It's probably just best to look at it like a miniseries, rather than a really, really
206860	208420	long movie.
208420	211380	Most of what got cut was minor character stuff.
211380	214420	Faramir's best stuff is all in Return of the King, and a lot of that gets relegated to
214420	215420	the extended cut.
215420	217820	There's a scene between Faramir and Pippin that I really like.
217820	221260	I didn't think they would find any livery that would fit me.
221260	223980	Ones belong to a young boy of the city.
223980	230100	Very foolish one, who wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending to his studies.
231100	234540	It also makes his later attachment to Faramir make more sense.
234540	237460	Like half of Eowyn's scenes get pushed into the extended cut.
237460	239020	Again, we'll get to her in a minute.
239020	241020	Oh, but Saruman.
241020	242940	Sorry, dude.
242940	247700	Saruman in the theatrical is just like, whoop, he's out of the movie.
247700	248700	Bye!
248700	252500	But there is a wizard to manage here.
252500	254580	Lock to your star.
254580	256500	And there Saruman must remain.
256900	261620	Originally this was not the case, and Saruman was going to have, you know, an ending.
261620	264540	But we only see that in the extended cut.
264540	269900	So I don't blame Christopher Lee for being pissed about his treatment in the theatrical.
269900	274700	But on a somewhat related note, Christopher Lee is kind of a badass.
274700	279060	Did you know this guy was a secret agent in World War II?
279060	285540	His mother was a Contessa, 6 foot 5, still doing action scenes in his 80s and 90s, speaks
285580	289420	a bunch of languages fluently, and was the only member of the cast and crew to actually
289420	293980	meet Tolkien, and I'm pretty sure is also like a literal vampire, and that's how he
293980	294980	stays young.
294980	299460	Yes, I know you wanted to play Gandalf, Chris, but damn, you really are perfect in this role.
299460	303740	We must join with him, Condon.
303740	309140	A part of that decision was because Christopher Lee was too old to play Gandalf, while Ian
309140	312020	McKellen was a spry 60.
312020	313500	His words, not mine.
313500	314500	But you know what?
314500	320020	I think when the news eventually does break that Christopher Lee has died of old age,
320020	327380	I think we can take that as code for went back to home planet.
327380	331420	Or went into his coffin to sleep for 100 years to regain power.
331420	335260	I buy it either way.
335260	342540	So speaking of dropped threads, there's a lot of this in this movie, so what up, Faramir?
342540	344420	How did your subplot end in the last movie?
344420	345420	I forget.
345420	347620	You know the laws of our country.
347620	349220	The laws of your father.
349220	351340	If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
351340	353780	What, thou shalt hand over rings of power?
353780	356260	Thou should happen to run a cr- never mind.
356260	358580	If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
358580	360900	Or I guess your life isn't actually forfeit at all.
360900	361900	That's cool.
361900	364900	Yeah, we're gonna just completely ignore that line in the next movie.
364900	367140	Like why throw that in there at all?
367140	368420	Like why throw that line in there at all?
368420	369420	Just have it be-
369420	370420	If you let them go-
370420	374580	You'll be really pissed.
374580	375920	Let him be pissed.
375920	378140	And I like Faramir a lot more in this movie.
378140	382060	His more compelling story was always in the third book, but his father, the increasingly
382060	387020	crazy-fying steward of Gondor, Denethor, sends him on a suicide mission because he's bitter
387020	390060	that the beloved son died instead of Faramir.
390060	394060	You wish now that our places had been exchanged.
394060	399060	That I had died and Boromir had lived.
399700	400700	Yes.
400700	403060	And no, this does not count towards this.
403060	405100	If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
405100	408300	Faramir goes on the suicide mission of his own free will, Gandalf even tries to talk
408300	409300	him out of it.
409300	411100	Do not throw away your life so rationally.
411100	413740	But he could have said no, and he didn't.
413740	415980	Does not apply to this stupid bogus line.
415980	419740	Denethor, the steward of Gondor.
419740	420740	He's not the king.
420740	423740	The line of kings failed.
423740	428140	The rule of Gondor was given over to messle men.
428220	432660	Yeah, that's also kind of an iffy concept in The Lord of the Rings, and you see this
432660	438260	a lot, this idea of this genetic stock is inferior to this genetic stock because reasons
438260	442340	and divine right and yada yada yada, coded Arabs and Asians are the bad guys.
442340	443340	Hail Britannia!
443340	449300	But I love the shit out of John Noble, like, you know, in general.
449300	454740	He has a penchant for intense Shakespearean roles, and he plays Denethor Cray.
455340	457340	Abandon your post!
458340	461340	Flee, flee for your lives!
461340	466340	Such to the point that his intensity is so much that Peach felt the need to break it.
468340	470340	Honestly, we're...okay.
470340	474540	Denethor's pretty much the batshit craziest role outside of Gollum, which of course makes
474540	475940	him one of my favorites.
475940	481340	Although it does make it kind of awkward when he dies because Gandalf f***ing kills him.
481940	485940	Hey, guys, we could, like, drag him off that pyre right now.
485940	488940	Like, he's still okay...I guess not.
490940	493940	So passes Denethor, son of Ixalan.
493940	494940	He sure does.
494940	500940	He passes all the way into the courtyard, and then into the quad, and all the way down,
500940	503940	like, 500 meters away over this cliff.
503940	508940	F***'s sake, I'd have a hard time making that sprint not emulated.
511940	515940	Incidentally, that shot got a huge laugh at the midnight showing I was at in 2003.
515940	517940	Oh, I remember.
520940	524940	But the real set piece of this movie, more than the other two, are the battles.
524940	530940	This one is so much more the war movie, and the battles start early, and they go long.
530940	533940	So, fortunately, there are a lot of emotional threads going on here.
533940	536940	Or else, why care about three hours of battles?
537540	542540	Eowyn and Theoden, Theramir and his father, Gandalf and Pippin, Merry and Pippin,
542540	545540	Eowyn and...everyone.
545540	549540	It is high fantasy, and while there are some elements that are kind of simplistic to the point
549540	554540	of being relevant to us in the real world, like the bad guys being irredeemably, irrevocably,
554540	559540	genetically just evil, it still deals with a lot of complex themes.
559540	564540	Issues of loyalty under a leader who's losing his mind, of the truest sacrifice for your friends
564540	568540	and your loved ones, how to deal with your friends' violent outbursts.
568540	570540	That's a filthy lie!
570540	576540	So you need stakes in order for us, the audience, to care about all this action and fighting and stuff.
576540	579540	So let's take a look at our breeding pair.
579540	581540	This is a dream.
583540	585540	Then it is a good dream.
586540	588540	Oh, the burning passion.
588540	592540	The two towers we see what's at stake with Aragorn and Arwen, and how she may like him a lot,
592540	597540	but he is gonna die, and she's not, and the funny thing is, especially when you get to the extended cut,
597540	601540	you kind of get the impression that Aragorn's just not that into her.
601540	603540	It was a dream, Arwen.
604540	605540	Nothing more.
605540	608540	Or Eowyn, for that matter. He's just not really into anyone.
608540	612540	But we gotta find a way to keep Arwen in the narrative and get us some stakes in there,
612540	615540	so are you ready for some bullshit?
615540	618540	I come on behalf of one whom I love.
619540	621540	Arwen is dying.
622540	625540	What? Why?
625540	629540	No, seriously, what? What?
629540	635540	In the book, it's Aragorn, you had better be the king of men to be worthy of my daughter, but just dying.
635540	638540	The life of the Eldar is leaving you.
638540	642540	And then the cure for this is beating Sauron, winning the war, apparently,
642540	646540	because she shows up at the end after three hours of not being in the movie at all, like,
646540	648540	I'm fine, let's get married.
648540	650540	Your reward has come.
651540	656540	And while we're in forced peach conflict territory, let's talk about Sam.
657540	661540	Ah, crumbs on those duckies, those whole turtles!
661540	663540	Huh, that wasn't in the book.
664540	666540	You stinking two-faced snake!
666540	669540	Sam, stop it!
669540	671540	Sam, stop it!
674540	677540	That really wasn't in the book.
679540	683540	I'm sorry, I didn't mean it to go so far, I was just so, so angry.
683540	685540	Isn't that what people in abusive relationships say?
685540	690540	Okay, Sam and Gollum, both in the book and in the movie, have an antagonistic relationship from the word go,
690540	694540	but it doesn't really manifest past some justified mistrust in the book,
694540	697540	the worst thing Sam does to Gollum there is call him a stinker.
697540	700540	In the third movie, Sam starts getting violent.
700540	702540	Like, really violent.
702540	703540	Sam!
703540	706540	Okay, in the Two Towers, yeah, I can see the violence.
706540	708540	He is kind of biting you.
708540	710540	Here, a little iffy.
710540	715540	He was completely defenseless, but I guess you did overhear him plotting your demise, so fine.
715540	721540	But his most violent outburst in all three movies comes from being accused of stealing food.
722540	725540	And then boom, goes all Chris Brown on him.
726540	730540	Wow, yeah, Frodo, I would send Sam away too.
730540	735540	He is clearly an unstable person who will probably snap on you somewhere down the line.
735540	736540	I'll get him!
736540	739540	See, the thing is with this little bit of forced-pige conflict,
739540	744540	in order to make it make sense for Frodo to send Sam away at all,
744540	750540	you have to push Sam so far away from his starting place that he's practically not the same character anymore.
750540	752540	Go home.
752540	757540	Or at the very least, has some terrible anger problems that are never addressed.
757540	763540	I personally think the reason that the forced-pige conflict has become such a distinctive and easy to identify thing
763540	770540	is the fact that Peter Jackson hasn't directed anything that was not an adaptation since Before Heavenly Creatures.
770540	774540	The closest thing would be District 9, which he neither wrote nor directed.
777540	780540	He's become a sort of auteur of adaptation,
780540	785540	and oddly enough, the book that he adapted that was the most faithful to the source material was The Lovely Bones,
785540	788540	which everyone hated.
788540	792540	So I'm not saying he's bad at adding conflict for the sake of adaptation.
792540	795540	Clearly he isn't clearly. He's very good at it. He's made a career out of it.
795540	802540	It's just sometimes the conflict he adds is a little over the top.
804540	809540	Yeah, so let's talk about Eowyn, who I think they actually did a really good job with in the extended cut.
809540	813540	In the Two Towers, she just sort of pines for Aragorn and wishes she could go off and fight,
813540	817540	and she doesn't really do anything until Return of the King, where she decides to fake being a man
817540	820540	so she too can ride into battle, and she sneaks Merry in with her.
820540	824540	And in doing so, they basically sneak around this loophole in this prophecy that says,
824540	827540	No man can kill the Witch-King of Angmar.
827540	832540	You fool. No man can kill me.
834540	836540	I am no man.
839540	843540	Cliche? Yes. Awesome?
843540	845540	Fuck yes.
845540	848540	So while it is nice to have at least one lady presence in an army of sausage,
848540	852540	and I honestly find her story and performance very compelling, especially in the extended cut,
852540	857540	Eowyn at the end just kind of gets shoved off on Faramir, which...
857540	862540	And behold, I will be a shieldmaiden no longer, nor vie with the great writers,
862540	865540	nor take joy only in the songs of slaying.
865540	869540	I will be a healer, and love all things that grow and are not barren.
869540	873540	No longer do I desire to be a queen.
875540	877540	I'm gonna settle!
877540	879540	You know who she should have ended up with?
883540	884540	Sorry.
884540	888540	The relationship between Eowyn and Merry is way better set up than Aragorn and Arwen,
888540	890540	and certainly Eowyn and Faramir.
890540	893540	I mean, look at these two. She helps him prepare for battle.
893540	895540	She believes in him.
895540	897540	You should not encourage him.
897540	899540	You should not doubt him.
899540	902540	They ride into battle together.
902540	905540	No! No!
905540	907540	They bond over love for their friends.
907540	910540	They slay the Witch King together!
910540	914540	If an elf and a human can get together and breed, why not a hobbit and a lady?
914540	915540	It's all I'm saying.
915540	920540	You are fair and brave and have much to live for.
921540	923540	And many who love you.
923540	926540	That is not subtext. That is text.
926540	931540	Even in the book, the Faramir thing is just kind of jammed in there at the last second,
931540	933540	and, you know, don't get me wrong, I like them both as characters,
933540	935540	and Faramir's a nice guy.
935540	939540	He's a lover, not a fighter, but come on, stupid rigid societal expectations.
939540	942540	This! This is a pure love.
942540	945540	Ride with me, my lady.
945540	948540	A lot of Eowyn's subplot got pushed into the extended edition,
948540	952540	which is kind of a shame because she's got a lot of compelling and interesting stuff,
952540	957540	but in the context of the whole trilogy, it's not a lot of payoff.
957540	960540	Her real arc is pretty much only in movie three,
960540	963540	and you've still got a lot of threads from movies one and two left dangling,
963540	967540	so in a way, that strength about movie three turns into a weakness.
967540	969540	You introduce new compelling stuff but end up having to cut it
969540	972540	because you have to tie up dangling threads from one and two.
972540	974540	Or not.
975540	978540	Oh my god, I've got so much crap to get through in so little time.
978540	979540	Hey.
979540	983540	Did you really just spend most of this review defending your one true ship?
983540	985540	It wasn't most of the review, no.
985540	988540	I mean, like, I spent all this time complaining about, like,
988540	990540	you know, shit they did end up changing,
990540	992540	and we were saying something they should have changed,
992540	994540	and you know, like, in terms of the screenplay,
994540	996540	things actually being set up well,
996540	998540	where it is in this case and not in others.
998540	1000540	Yeah, what was that about you still having a lot to actually get through?
1000540	1002540	To wrap it up?
1002540	1005540	Wait, where have you been in the last two?
1005540	1007540	I was in the last two.
1007540	1009540	Oh, but I'm in the extended cuts.
1009540	1012540	Does that mean this is an extended cut?
1012540	1014540	Yep.
1014540	1016540	Aren't extended cuts usually cut in half?
