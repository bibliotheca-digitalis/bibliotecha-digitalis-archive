WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.480
When, last we left our heroes, Frodo fell down a bunch, Gimli was short and it was funny,

00:08.480 --> 00:11.240
and Andy Serkis got snobbed an Oscar nod.

00:11.240 --> 00:12.240
Beliah!

00:12.240 --> 00:13.240
I'm the thief!

00:13.240 --> 00:14.240
It's mine!

00:14.240 --> 00:15.240
I won it!

00:15.240 --> 00:16.240
It was me!

00:16.240 --> 00:17.880
Uh, wait, okay, hold back.

00:17.880 --> 00:20.120
Metatextuality makes things even more complicated.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.120
And you know what?

00:21.120 --> 00:25.920
Regarding these movies, we could go on for hours and hours and years about all of their

00:25.920 --> 00:30.520
influences and all of the outcomes, and there's a lot to go through.

00:30.520 --> 00:36.760
But Return of the King, it's really long.

00:36.760 --> 00:43.840
And when we're talking about market, the length of the film is pretty relevant, so

00:43.840 --> 00:46.080
I'm going to pick up where I left off.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.900
Last week, we talked about The Lord of the Rings and its impact on genre, but that wasn't

00:49.900 --> 00:50.900
its only impact.

00:50.900 --> 00:54.480
Before Lord of the Rings, it was pretty unheard of that you would film three gigantically

00:54.480 --> 00:58.800
budgeted movies to be staggered over three years at the same time.

00:58.800 --> 01:04.560
Now, with the right marketing strategy and the knowledge that it's a pre-existing property,

01:04.560 --> 01:06.560
it's kind of a thing.

01:06.560 --> 01:10.440
Lord of the Rings was unique in that they were all shot together from the start, which

01:10.440 --> 01:11.800
tends not to be the case.

01:11.800 --> 01:15.360
They usually wait till the franchise gets off the ground and then film two or three

01:15.360 --> 01:16.360
at the same time.

01:16.360 --> 01:20.040
It's odd to think that we live in a world now where sequels, especially two beloved

01:20.040 --> 01:23.440
fantasy adaptations, are guaranteed to make more money.

01:23.480 --> 01:28.480
That was seldom the case before, and they're all so longer in that recognizing a brand

01:28.480 --> 01:33.480
to a property you're familiar with is more important in franchising than anything, really.

01:33.480 --> 01:37.340
Obviously there are two stars colliding in this story, it wasn't just Lord of the Rings,

01:37.340 --> 01:42.720
but the key here to these adapted franchises is the recognizability to the consumer.

01:42.720 --> 01:49.480
These three movies, especially Return of the King, normalized the three-hour movie.

01:49.480 --> 01:52.660
I'm the king of the world!

01:52.660 --> 01:57.340
Before this trilogy, three-hour movies were the exception, not the rule.

01:57.340 --> 02:01.700
Then this incredibly long monstrosity comes along, and three and a half hours, Return

02:01.700 --> 02:05.580
of the King was the only one of the three movies to be the top-grossing film of its

02:05.580 --> 02:06.580
year.

02:06.580 --> 02:08.020
The other two only came in second.

02:08.020 --> 02:09.020
And why have long movies?

02:09.020 --> 02:13.460
After all, a really long movie reduces the number of showtimes you can cram in in any

02:13.460 --> 02:15.340
given day.

02:15.340 --> 02:20.900
Then again, a really long movie also drives out any incentive or time to see the competition.

02:22.900 --> 02:23.900
Just sayin'.

02:23.900 --> 02:27.220
All right, so we've got six hours of movie behind us and a whole bunch of plot threads

02:27.220 --> 02:31.500
to wrap up in this, so the longest and the most peopled of the three movies.

02:31.500 --> 02:33.540
Let's see where it takes us.

02:33.540 --> 02:39.300
Return of the King is the end of the trilogy and all the stuff gets wrapped up, and some

02:39.300 --> 02:40.300
doesn't.

02:40.300 --> 02:44.460
It is a much more faithful adaptation than The Two Towers, but long as it is, a lot of

02:44.460 --> 02:47.660
threads just get dropped utterly in the theatrical cut.

02:47.660 --> 02:51.620
Like Eowyn's relationship to Aragorn, we haven't talked much about her yet, but she's coming.

02:51.620 --> 02:53.460
She dumps her, and then that's that.

02:53.460 --> 02:56.460
It is but a shadow on a throne that you love.

03:00.460 --> 03:02.700
I cannot give you what you seek.

03:02.700 --> 03:08.020
They introduce Gothmog, the big bad elephantiasis orc who ostensibly is in charge.

03:08.020 --> 03:13.220
I don't like him, but he only gets an ending in the extended cut.

03:13.220 --> 03:16.820
The extended cut of Return of the King is really, really long.

03:16.820 --> 03:18.380
It's creeping up on five hours.

03:18.380 --> 03:19.780
But I mean, it's good.

03:19.780 --> 03:21.060
It's got a lot of good stuff in it.

03:21.060 --> 03:26.860
It's probably just best to look at it like a miniseries, rather than a really, really

03:26.860 --> 03:28.420
long movie.

03:28.420 --> 03:31.380
Most of what got cut was minor character stuff.

03:31.380 --> 03:34.420
Faramir's best stuff is all in Return of the King, and a lot of that gets relegated to

03:34.420 --> 03:35.420
the extended cut.

03:35.420 --> 03:37.820
There's a scene between Faramir and Pippin that I really like.

03:37.820 --> 03:41.260
I didn't think they would find any livery that would fit me.

03:41.260 --> 03:43.980
Ones belong to a young boy of the city.

03:43.980 --> 03:50.100
Very foolish one, who wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending to his studies.

03:51.100 --> 03:54.540
It also makes his later attachment to Faramir make more sense.

03:54.540 --> 03:57.460
Like half of Eowyn's scenes get pushed into the extended cut.

03:57.460 --> 03:59.020
Again, we'll get to her in a minute.

03:59.020 --> 04:01.020
Oh, but Saruman.

04:01.020 --> 04:02.940
Sorry, dude.

04:02.940 --> 04:07.700
Saruman in the theatrical is just like, whoop, he's out of the movie.

04:07.700 --> 04:08.700
Bye!

04:08.700 --> 04:12.500
But there is a wizard to manage here.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.580
Lock to your star.

04:14.580 --> 04:16.500
And there Saruman must remain.

04:16.900 --> 04:21.620
Originally this was not the case, and Saruman was going to have, you know, an ending.

04:21.620 --> 04:24.540
But we only see that in the extended cut.

04:24.540 --> 04:29.900
So I don't blame Christopher Lee for being pissed about his treatment in the theatrical.

04:29.900 --> 04:34.700
But on a somewhat related note, Christopher Lee is kind of a badass.

04:34.700 --> 04:39.060
Did you know this guy was a secret agent in World War II?

04:39.060 --> 04:45.540
His mother was a Contessa, 6 foot 5, still doing action scenes in his 80s and 90s, speaks

04:45.580 --> 04:49.420
a bunch of languages fluently, and was the only member of the cast and crew to actually

04:49.420 --> 04:53.980
meet Tolkien, and I'm pretty sure is also like a literal vampire, and that's how he

04:53.980 --> 04:54.980
stays young.

04:54.980 --> 04:59.460
Yes, I know you wanted to play Gandalf, Chris, but damn, you really are perfect in this role.

04:59.460 --> 05:03.740
We must join with him, Condon.

05:03.740 --> 05:09.140
A part of that decision was because Christopher Lee was too old to play Gandalf, while Ian

05:09.140 --> 05:12.020
McKellen was a spry 60.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.500
His words, not mine.

05:13.500 --> 05:14.500
But you know what?

05:14.500 --> 05:20.020
I think when the news eventually does break that Christopher Lee has died of old age,

05:20.020 --> 05:27.380
I think we can take that as code for went back to home planet.

05:27.380 --> 05:31.420
Or went into his coffin to sleep for 100 years to regain power.

05:31.420 --> 05:35.260
I buy it either way.

05:35.260 --> 05:42.540
So speaking of dropped threads, there's a lot of this in this movie, so what up, Faramir?

05:42.540 --> 05:44.420
How did your subplot end in the last movie?

05:44.420 --> 05:45.420
I forget.

05:45.420 --> 05:47.620
You know the laws of our country.

05:47.620 --> 05:49.220
The laws of your father.

05:49.220 --> 05:51.340
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.

05:51.340 --> 05:53.780
What, thou shalt hand over rings of power?

05:53.780 --> 05:56.260
Thou should happen to run a cr- never mind.

05:56.260 --> 05:58.580
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.

05:58.580 --> 06:00.900
Or I guess your life isn't actually forfeit at all.

06:00.900 --> 06:01.900
That's cool.

06:01.900 --> 06:04.900
Yeah, we're gonna just completely ignore that line in the next movie.

06:04.900 --> 06:07.140
Like why throw that in there at all?

06:07.140 --> 06:08.420
Like why throw that line in there at all?

06:08.420 --> 06:09.420
Just have it be-

06:09.420 --> 06:10.420
If you let them go-

06:10.420 --> 06:14.580
You'll be really pissed.

06:14.580 --> 06:15.920
Let him be pissed.

06:15.920 --> 06:18.140
And I like Faramir a lot more in this movie.

06:18.140 --> 06:22.060
His more compelling story was always in the third book, but his father, the increasingly

06:22.060 --> 06:27.020
crazy-fying steward of Gondor, Denethor, sends him on a suicide mission because he's bitter

06:27.020 --> 06:30.060
that the beloved son died instead of Faramir.

06:30.060 --> 06:34.060
You wish now that our places had been exchanged.

06:34.060 --> 06:39.060
That I had died and Boromir had lived.

06:39.700 --> 06:40.700
Yes.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.060
And no, this does not count towards this.

06:43.060 --> 06:45.100
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.

06:45.100 --> 06:48.300
Faramir goes on the suicide mission of his own free will, Gandalf even tries to talk

06:48.300 --> 06:49.300
him out of it.

06:49.300 --> 06:51.100
Do not throw away your life so rationally.

06:51.100 --> 06:53.740
But he could have said no, and he didn't.

06:53.740 --> 06:55.980
Does not apply to this stupid bogus line.

06:55.980 --> 06:59.740
Denethor, the steward of Gondor.

06:59.740 --> 07:00.740
He's not the king.

07:00.740 --> 07:03.740
The line of kings failed.

07:03.740 --> 07:08.140
The rule of Gondor was given over to messle men.

07:08.220 --> 07:12.660
Yeah, that's also kind of an iffy concept in The Lord of the Rings, and you see this

07:12.660 --> 07:18.260
a lot, this idea of this genetic stock is inferior to this genetic stock because reasons

07:18.260 --> 07:22.340
and divine right and yada yada yada, coded Arabs and Asians are the bad guys.

07:22.340 --> 07:23.340
Hail Britannia!

07:23.340 --> 07:29.300
But I love the shit out of John Noble, like, you know, in general.

07:29.300 --> 07:34.740
He has a penchant for intense Shakespearean roles, and he plays Denethor Cray.

07:35.340 --> 07:37.340
Abandon your post!

07:38.340 --> 07:41.340
Flee, flee for your lives!

07:41.340 --> 07:46.340
Such to the point that his intensity is so much that Peach felt the need to break it.

07:48.340 --> 07:50.340
Honestly, we're...okay.

07:50.340 --> 07:54.540
Denethor's pretty much the batshit craziest role outside of Gollum, which of course makes

07:54.540 --> 07:55.940
him one of my favorites.

07:55.940 --> 08:01.340
Although it does make it kind of awkward when he dies because Gandalf f***ing kills him.

08:01.940 --> 08:05.940
Hey, guys, we could, like, drag him off that pyre right now.

08:05.940 --> 08:08.940
Like, he's still okay...I guess not.

08:10.940 --> 08:13.940
So passes Denethor, son of Ixalan.

08:13.940 --> 08:14.940
He sure does.

08:14.940 --> 08:20.940
He passes all the way into the courtyard, and then into the quad, and all the way down,

08:20.940 --> 08:23.940
like, 500 meters away over this cliff.

08:23.940 --> 08:28.940
F***'s sake, I'd have a hard time making that sprint not emulated.

08:31.940 --> 08:35.940
Incidentally, that shot got a huge laugh at the midnight showing I was at in 2003.

08:35.940 --> 08:37.940
Oh, I remember.

08:40.940 --> 08:44.940
But the real set piece of this movie, more than the other two, are the battles.

08:44.940 --> 08:50.940
This one is so much more the war movie, and the battles start early, and they go long.

08:50.940 --> 08:53.940
So, fortunately, there are a lot of emotional threads going on here.

08:53.940 --> 08:56.940
Or else, why care about three hours of battles?

08:57.540 --> 09:02.540
Eowyn and Theoden, Theramir and his father, Gandalf and Pippin, Merry and Pippin,

09:02.540 --> 09:05.540
Eowyn and...everyone.

09:05.540 --> 09:09.540
It is high fantasy, and while there are some elements that are kind of simplistic to the point

09:09.540 --> 09:14.540
of being relevant to us in the real world, like the bad guys being irredeemably, irrevocably,

09:14.540 --> 09:19.540
genetically just evil, it still deals with a lot of complex themes.

09:19.540 --> 09:24.540
Issues of loyalty under a leader who's losing his mind, of the truest sacrifice for your friends

09:24.540 --> 09:28.540
and your loved ones, how to deal with your friends' violent outbursts.

09:28.540 --> 09:30.540
That's a filthy lie!

09:30.540 --> 09:36.540
So you need stakes in order for us, the audience, to care about all this action and fighting and stuff.

09:36.540 --> 09:39.540
So let's take a look at our breeding pair.

09:39.540 --> 09:41.540
This is a dream.

09:43.540 --> 09:45.540
Then it is a good dream.

09:46.540 --> 09:48.540
Oh, the burning passion.

09:48.540 --> 09:52.540
The two towers we see what's at stake with Aragorn and Arwen, and how she may like him a lot,

09:52.540 --> 09:57.540
but he is gonna die, and she's not, and the funny thing is, especially when you get to the extended cut,

09:57.540 --> 10:01.540
you kind of get the impression that Aragorn's just not that into her.

10:01.540 --> 10:03.540
It was a dream, Arwen.

10:04.540 --> 10:05.540
Nothing more.

10:05.540 --> 10:08.540
Or Eowyn, for that matter. He's just not really into anyone.

10:08.540 --> 10:12.540
But we gotta find a way to keep Arwen in the narrative and get us some stakes in there,

10:12.540 --> 10:15.540
so are you ready for some bullshit?

10:15.540 --> 10:18.540
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

10:19.540 --> 10:21.540
Arwen is dying.

10:22.540 --> 10:25.540
What? Why?

10:25.540 --> 10:29.540
No, seriously, what? What?

10:29.540 --> 10:35.540
In the book, it's Aragorn, you had better be the king of men to be worthy of my daughter, but just dying.

10:35.540 --> 10:38.540
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

10:38.540 --> 10:42.540
And then the cure for this is beating Sauron, winning the war, apparently,

10:42.540 --> 10:46.540
because she shows up at the end after three hours of not being in the movie at all, like,

10:46.540 --> 10:48.540
I'm fine, let's get married.

10:48.540 --> 10:50.540
Your reward has come.

10:51.540 --> 10:56.540
And while we're in forced peach conflict territory, let's talk about Sam.

10:57.540 --> 11:01.540
Ah, crumbs on those duckies, those whole turtles!

11:01.540 --> 11:03.540
Huh, that wasn't in the book.

11:04.540 --> 11:06.540
You stinking two-faced snake!

11:06.540 --> 11:09.540
Sam, stop it!

11:09.540 --> 11:11.540
Sam, stop it!

11:14.540 --> 11:17.540
That really wasn't in the book.

11:19.540 --> 11:23.540
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it to go so far, I was just so, so angry.

11:23.540 --> 11:25.540
Isn't that what people in abusive relationships say?

11:25.540 --> 11:30.540
Okay, Sam and Gollum, both in the book and in the movie, have an antagonistic relationship from the word go,

11:30.540 --> 11:34.540
but it doesn't really manifest past some justified mistrust in the book,

11:34.540 --> 11:37.540
the worst thing Sam does to Gollum there is call him a stinker.

11:37.540 --> 11:40.540
In the third movie, Sam starts getting violent.

11:40.540 --> 11:42.540
Like, really violent.

11:42.540 --> 11:43.540
Sam!

11:43.540 --> 11:46.540
Okay, in the Two Towers, yeah, I can see the violence.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.540
He is kind of biting you.

11:48.540 --> 11:50.540
Here, a little iffy.

11:50.540 --> 11:55.540
He was completely defenseless, but I guess you did overhear him plotting your demise, so fine.

11:55.540 --> 12:01.540
But his most violent outburst in all three movies comes from being accused of stealing food.

12:02.540 --> 12:05.540
And then boom, goes all Chris Brown on him.

12:06.540 --> 12:10.540
Wow, yeah, Frodo, I would send Sam away too.

12:10.540 --> 12:15.540
He is clearly an unstable person who will probably snap on you somewhere down the line.

12:15.540 --> 12:16.540
I'll get him!

12:16.540 --> 12:19.540
See, the thing is with this little bit of forced-pige conflict,

12:19.540 --> 12:24.540
in order to make it make sense for Frodo to send Sam away at all,

12:24.540 --> 12:30.540
you have to push Sam so far away from his starting place that he's practically not the same character anymore.

12:30.540 --> 12:32.540
Go home.

12:32.540 --> 12:37.540
Or at the very least, has some terrible anger problems that are never addressed.

12:37.540 --> 12:43.540
I personally think the reason that the forced-pige conflict has become such a distinctive and easy to identify thing

12:43.540 --> 12:50.540
is the fact that Peter Jackson hasn't directed anything that was not an adaptation since Before Heavenly Creatures.

12:50.540 --> 12:54.540
The closest thing would be District 9, which he neither wrote nor directed.

12:57.540 --> 13:00.540
He's become a sort of auteur of adaptation,

13:00.540 --> 13:05.540
and oddly enough, the book that he adapted that was the most faithful to the source material was The Lovely Bones,

13:05.540 --> 13:08.540
which everyone hated.

13:08.540 --> 13:12.540
So I'm not saying he's bad at adding conflict for the sake of adaptation.

13:12.540 --> 13:15.540
Clearly he isn't clearly. He's very good at it. He's made a career out of it.

13:15.540 --> 13:22.540
It's just sometimes the conflict he adds is a little over the top.

13:24.540 --> 13:29.540
Yeah, so let's talk about Eowyn, who I think they actually did a really good job with in the extended cut.

13:29.540 --> 13:33.540
In the Two Towers, she just sort of pines for Aragorn and wishes she could go off and fight,

13:33.540 --> 13:37.540
and she doesn't really do anything until Return of the King, where she decides to fake being a man

13:37.540 --> 13:40.540
so she too can ride into battle, and she sneaks Merry in with her.

13:40.540 --> 13:44.540
And in doing so, they basically sneak around this loophole in this prophecy that says,

13:44.540 --> 13:47.540
No man can kill the Witch-King of Angmar.

13:47.540 --> 13:52.540
You fool. No man can kill me.

13:54.540 --> 13:56.540
I am no man.

13:59.540 --> 14:03.540
Cliche? Yes. Awesome?

14:03.540 --> 14:05.540
Fuck yes.

14:05.540 --> 14:08.540
So while it is nice to have at least one lady presence in an army of sausage,

14:08.540 --> 14:12.540
and I honestly find her story and performance very compelling, especially in the extended cut,

14:12.540 --> 14:17.540
Eowyn at the end just kind of gets shoved off on Faramir, which...

14:17.540 --> 14:22.540
And behold, I will be a shieldmaiden no longer, nor vie with the great writers,

14:22.540 --> 14:25.540
nor take joy only in the songs of slaying.

14:25.540 --> 14:29.540
I will be a healer, and love all things that grow and are not barren.

14:29.540 --> 14:33.540
No longer do I desire to be a queen.

14:35.540 --> 14:37.540
I'm gonna settle!

14:37.540 --> 14:39.540
You know who she should have ended up with?

14:43.540 --> 14:44.540
Sorry.

14:44.540 --> 14:48.540
The relationship between Eowyn and Merry is way better set up than Aragorn and Arwen,

14:48.540 --> 14:50.540
and certainly Eowyn and Faramir.

14:50.540 --> 14:53.540
I mean, look at these two. She helps him prepare for battle.

14:53.540 --> 14:55.540
She believes in him.

14:55.540 --> 14:57.540
You should not encourage him.

14:57.540 --> 14:59.540
You should not doubt him.

14:59.540 --> 15:02.540
They ride into battle together.

15:02.540 --> 15:05.540
No! No!

15:05.540 --> 15:07.540
They bond over love for their friends.

15:07.540 --> 15:10.540
They slay the Witch King together!

15:10.540 --> 15:14.540
If an elf and a human can get together and breed, why not a hobbit and a lady?

15:14.540 --> 15:15.540
It's all I'm saying.

15:15.540 --> 15:20.540
You are fair and brave and have much to live for.

15:21.540 --> 15:23.540
And many who love you.

15:23.540 --> 15:26.540
That is not subtext. That is text.

15:26.540 --> 15:31.540
Even in the book, the Faramir thing is just kind of jammed in there at the last second,

15:31.540 --> 15:33.540
and, you know, don't get me wrong, I like them both as characters,

15:33.540 --> 15:35.540
and Faramir's a nice guy.

15:35.540 --> 15:39.540
He's a lover, not a fighter, but come on, stupid rigid societal expectations.

15:39.540 --> 15:42.540
This! This is a pure love.

15:42.540 --> 15:45.540
Ride with me, my lady.

15:45.540 --> 15:48.540
A lot of Eowyn's subplot got pushed into the extended edition,

15:48.540 --> 15:52.540
which is kind of a shame because she's got a lot of compelling and interesting stuff,

15:52.540 --> 15:57.540
but in the context of the whole trilogy, it's not a lot of payoff.

15:57.540 --> 16:00.540
Her real arc is pretty much only in movie three,

16:00.540 --> 16:03.540
and you've still got a lot of threads from movies one and two left dangling,

16:03.540 --> 16:07.540
so in a way, that strength about movie three turns into a weakness.

16:07.540 --> 16:09.540
You introduce new compelling stuff but end up having to cut it

16:09.540 --> 16:12.540
because you have to tie up dangling threads from one and two.

16:12.540 --> 16:14.540
Or not.

16:15.540 --> 16:18.540
Oh my god, I've got so much crap to get through in so little time.

16:18.540 --> 16:19.540
Hey.

16:19.540 --> 16:23.540
Did you really just spend most of this review defending your one true ship?

16:23.540 --> 16:25.540
It wasn't most of the review, no.

16:25.540 --> 16:28.540
I mean, like, I spent all this time complaining about, like,

16:28.540 --> 16:30.540
you know, shit they did end up changing,

16:30.540 --> 16:32.540
and we were saying something they should have changed,

16:32.540 --> 16:34.540
and you know, like, in terms of the screenplay,

16:34.540 --> 16:36.540
things actually being set up well,

16:36.540 --> 16:38.540
where it is in this case and not in others.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.540
Yeah, what was that about you still having a lot to actually get through?

16:40.540 --> 16:42.540
To wrap it up?

16:42.540 --> 16:45.540
Wait, where have you been in the last two?

16:45.540 --> 16:47.540
I was in the last two.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.540
Oh, but I'm in the extended cuts.

16:49.540 --> 16:52.540
Does that mean this is an extended cut?

16:52.540 --> 16:54.540
Yep.

16:54.540 --> 16:56.540
Aren't extended cuts usually cut in half?
