1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
When, last we left our heroes, Frodo fell down a bunch, Gimli was short and it was funny,

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,240
and Andy Serkis got snobbed an Oscar nod.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,240
Beliah!

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,240
I'm the thief!

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,240
It's mine!

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,240
I won it!

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,240
It was me!

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,880
Uh, wait, okay, hold back.

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,120
Metatextuality makes things even more complicated.

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,120
And you know what?

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,920
Regarding these movies, we could go on for hours and hours and years about all of their

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,520
influences and all of the outcomes, and there's a lot to go through.

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:36,760
But Return of the King, it's really long.

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:43,840
And when we're talking about market, the length of the film is pretty relevant, so

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,080
I'm going to pick up where I left off.

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,900
Last week, we talked about The Lord of the Rings and its impact on genre, but that wasn't

17
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,900
its only impact.

18
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,480
Before Lord of the Rings, it was pretty unheard of that you would film three gigantically

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,800
budgeted movies to be staggered over three years at the same time.

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,560
Now, with the right marketing strategy and the knowledge that it's a pre-existing property,

21
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,560
it's kind of a thing.

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,440
Lord of the Rings was unique in that they were all shot together from the start, which

23
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,800
tends not to be the case.

24
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,360
They usually wait till the franchise gets off the ground and then film two or three

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,360
at the same time.

26
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,040
It's odd to think that we live in a world now where sequels, especially two beloved

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,440
fantasy adaptations, are guaranteed to make more money.

28
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,480
That was seldom the case before, and they're all so longer in that recognizing a brand

29
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,480
to a property you're familiar with is more important in franchising than anything, really.

30
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,340
Obviously there are two stars colliding in this story, it wasn't just Lord of the Rings,

31
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:42,720
but the key here to these adapted franchises is the recognizability to the consumer.

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,480
These three movies, especially Return of the King, normalized the three-hour movie.

33
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,660
I'm the king of the world!

34
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,340
Before this trilogy, three-hour movies were the exception, not the rule.

35
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,700
Then this incredibly long monstrosity comes along, and three and a half hours, Return

36
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,580
of the King was the only one of the three movies to be the top-grossing film of its

37
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,580
year.

38
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,020
The other two only came in second.

39
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,020
And why have long movies?

40
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,460
After all, a really long movie reduces the number of showtimes you can cram in in any

41
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,340
given day.

42
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:20,900
Then again, a really long movie also drives out any incentive or time to see the competition.

43
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,900
Just sayin'.

44
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,220
All right, so we've got six hours of movie behind us and a whole bunch of plot threads

45
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,500
to wrap up in this, so the longest and the most peopled of the three movies.

46
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,540
Let's see where it takes us.

47
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:39,300
Return of the King is the end of the trilogy and all the stuff gets wrapped up, and some

48
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,300
doesn't.

49
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,460
It is a much more faithful adaptation than The Two Towers, but long as it is, a lot of

50
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,660
threads just get dropped utterly in the theatrical cut.

51
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,620
Like Eowyn's relationship to Aragorn, we haven't talked much about her yet, but she's coming.

52
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,460
She dumps her, and then that's that.

53
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,460
It is but a shadow on a throne that you love.

54
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,700
I cannot give you what you seek.

55
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,020
They introduce Gothmog, the big bad elephantiasis orc who ostensibly is in charge.

56
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:13,220
I don't like him, but he only gets an ending in the extended cut.

57
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,820
The extended cut of Return of the King is really, really long.

58
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,380
It's creeping up on five hours.

59
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,780
But I mean, it's good.

60
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,060
It's got a lot of good stuff in it.

61
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,860
It's probably just best to look at it like a miniseries, rather than a really, really

62
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,420
long movie.

63
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,380
Most of what got cut was minor character stuff.

64
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,420
Faramir's best stuff is all in Return of the King, and a lot of that gets relegated to

65
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,420
the extended cut.

66
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,820
There's a scene between Faramir and Pippin that I really like.

67
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,260
I didn't think they would find any livery that would fit me.

68
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,980
Ones belong to a young boy of the city.

69
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:50,100
Very foolish one, who wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending to his studies.

70
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,540
It also makes his later attachment to Faramir make more sense.

71
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,460
Like half of Eowyn's scenes get pushed into the extended cut.

72
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,020
Again, we'll get to her in a minute.

73
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,020
Oh, but Saruman.

74
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,940
Sorry, dude.

75
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,700
Saruman in the theatrical is just like, whoop, he's out of the movie.

76
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,700
Bye!

77
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,500
But there is a wizard to manage here.

78
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,580
Lock to your star.

79
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,500
And there Saruman must remain.

80
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,620
Originally this was not the case, and Saruman was going to have, you know, an ending.

81
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,540
But we only see that in the extended cut.

82
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,900
So I don't blame Christopher Lee for being pissed about his treatment in the theatrical.

83
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,700
But on a somewhat related note, Christopher Lee is kind of a badass.

84
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,060
Did you know this guy was a secret agent in World War II?

85
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:45,540
His mother was a Contessa, 6 foot 5, still doing action scenes in his 80s and 90s, speaks

86
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,420
a bunch of languages fluently, and was the only member of the cast and crew to actually

87
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,980
meet Tolkien, and I'm pretty sure is also like a literal vampire, and that's how he

88
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,980
stays young.

89
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,460
Yes, I know you wanted to play Gandalf, Chris, but damn, you really are perfect in this role.

90
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,740
We must join with him, Condon.

91
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:09,140
A part of that decision was because Christopher Lee was too old to play Gandalf, while Ian

92
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,020
McKellen was a spry 60.

93
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,500
His words, not mine.

94
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
But you know what?

95
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:20,020
I think when the news eventually does break that Christopher Lee has died of old age,

96
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:27,380
I think we can take that as code for went back to home planet.

97
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,420
Or went into his coffin to sleep for 100 years to regain power.

98
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,260
I buy it either way.

99
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:42,540
So speaking of dropped threads, there's a lot of this in this movie, so what up, Faramir?

100
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,420
How did your subplot end in the last movie?

101
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,420
I forget.

102
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,620
You know the laws of our country.

103
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,220
The laws of your father.

104
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,340
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.

105
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,780
What, thou shalt hand over rings of power?

106
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,260
Thou should happen to run a cr- never mind.

107
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,580
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.

108
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,900
Or I guess your life isn't actually forfeit at all.

109
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,900
That's cool.

110
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,900
Yeah, we're gonna just completely ignore that line in the next movie.

111
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,140
Like why throw that in there at all?

112
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,420
Like why throw that line in there at all?

113
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,420
Just have it be-

114
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,420
If you let them go-

115
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,580
You'll be really pissed.

116
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,920
Let him be pissed.

117
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,140
And I like Faramir a lot more in this movie.

118
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,060
His more compelling story was always in the third book, but his father, the increasingly

119
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:27,020
crazy-fying steward of Gondor, Denethor, sends him on a suicide mission because he's bitter

120
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,060
that the beloved son died instead of Faramir.

121
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,060
You wish now that our places had been exchanged.

122
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,060
That I had died and Boromir had lived.

123
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,700
Yes.

124
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,060
And no, this does not count towards this.

125
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,100
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.

126
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,300
Faramir goes on the suicide mission of his own free will, Gandalf even tries to talk

127
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,300
him out of it.

128
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,100
Do not throw away your life so rationally.

129
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,740
But he could have said no, and he didn't.

130
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,980
Does not apply to this stupid bogus line.

131
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,740
Denethor, the steward of Gondor.

132
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,740
He's not the king.

133
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,740
The line of kings failed.

134
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,140
The rule of Gondor was given over to messle men.

135
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,660
Yeah, that's also kind of an iffy concept in The Lord of the Rings, and you see this

136
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:18,260
a lot, this idea of this genetic stock is inferior to this genetic stock because reasons

137
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,340
and divine right and yada yada yada, coded Arabs and Asians are the bad guys.

138
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,340
Hail Britannia!

139
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:29,300
But I love the shit out of John Noble, like, you know, in general.

140
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,740
He has a penchant for intense Shakespearean roles, and he plays Denethor Cray.

141
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,340
Abandon your post!

142
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,340
Flee, flee for your lives!

143
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,340
Such to the point that his intensity is so much that Peach felt the need to break it.

144
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,340
Honestly, we're...okay.

145
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,540
Denethor's pretty much the batshit craziest role outside of Gollum, which of course makes

146
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,940
him one of my favorites.

147
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:01,340
Although it does make it kind of awkward when he dies because Gandalf f***ing kills him.

148
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,940
Hey, guys, we could, like, drag him off that pyre right now.

149
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,940
Like, he's still okay...I guess not.

150
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,940
So passes Denethor, son of Ixalan.

151
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,940
He sure does.

152
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:20,940
He passes all the way into the courtyard, and then into the quad, and all the way down,

153
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,940
like, 500 meters away over this cliff.

154
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,940
F***'s sake, I'd have a hard time making that sprint not emulated.

155
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,940
Incidentally, that shot got a huge laugh at the midnight showing I was at in 2003.

156
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,940
Oh, I remember.

157
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,940
But the real set piece of this movie, more than the other two, are the battles.

158
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,940
This one is so much more the war movie, and the battles start early, and they go long.

159
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,940
So, fortunately, there are a lot of emotional threads going on here.

160
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,940
Or else, why care about three hours of battles?

161
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,540
Eowyn and Theoden, Theramir and his father, Gandalf and Pippin, Merry and Pippin,

162
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,540
Eowyn and...everyone.

163
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,540
It is high fantasy, and while there are some elements that are kind of simplistic to the point

164
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,540
of being relevant to us in the real world, like the bad guys being irredeemably, irrevocably,

165
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,540
genetically just evil, it still deals with a lot of complex themes.

166
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:24,540
Issues of loyalty under a leader who's losing his mind, of the truest sacrifice for your friends

167
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,540
and your loved ones, how to deal with your friends' violent outbursts.

168
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,540
That's a filthy lie!

169
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:36,540
So you need stakes in order for us, the audience, to care about all this action and fighting and stuff.

170
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,540
So let's take a look at our breeding pair.

171
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,540
This is a dream.

172
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,540
Then it is a good dream.

173
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,540
Oh, the burning passion.

174
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,540
The two towers we see what's at stake with Aragorn and Arwen, and how she may like him a lot,

175
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:57,540
but he is gonna die, and she's not, and the funny thing is, especially when you get to the extended cut,

176
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,540
you kind of get the impression that Aragorn's just not that into her.

177
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,540
It was a dream, Arwen.

178
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,540
Nothing more.

179
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,540
Or Eowyn, for that matter. He's just not really into anyone.

180
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,540
But we gotta find a way to keep Arwen in the narrative and get us some stakes in there,

181
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,540
so are you ready for some bullshit?

182
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,540
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

183
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,540
Arwen is dying.

184
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,540
What? Why?

185
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,540
No, seriously, what? What?

186
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:35,540
In the book, it's Aragorn, you had better be the king of men to be worthy of my daughter, but just dying.

187
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,540
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

188
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,540
And then the cure for this is beating Sauron, winning the war, apparently,

189
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,540
because she shows up at the end after three hours of not being in the movie at all, like,

190
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,540
I'm fine, let's get married.

191
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,540
Your reward has come.

192
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,540
And while we're in forced peach conflict territory, let's talk about Sam.

193
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,540
Ah, crumbs on those duckies, those whole turtles!

194
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,540
Huh, that wasn't in the book.

195
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,540
You stinking two-faced snake!

196
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,540
Sam, stop it!

197
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,540
Sam, stop it!

198
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,540
That really wasn't in the book.

199
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,540
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it to go so far, I was just so, so angry.

200
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,540
Isn't that what people in abusive relationships say?

201
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:30,540
Okay, Sam and Gollum, both in the book and in the movie, have an antagonistic relationship from the word go,

202
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,540
but it doesn't really manifest past some justified mistrust in the book,

203
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,540
the worst thing Sam does to Gollum there is call him a stinker.

204
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,540
In the third movie, Sam starts getting violent.

205
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,540
Like, really violent.

206
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,540
Sam!

207
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,540
Okay, in the Two Towers, yeah, I can see the violence.

208
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,540
He is kind of biting you.

209
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,540
Here, a little iffy.

210
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,540
He was completely defenseless, but I guess you did overhear him plotting your demise, so fine.

211
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:01,540
But his most violent outburst in all three movies comes from being accused of stealing food.

212
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,540
And then boom, goes all Chris Brown on him.

213
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,540
Wow, yeah, Frodo, I would send Sam away too.

214
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,540
He is clearly an unstable person who will probably snap on you somewhere down the line.

215
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,540
I'll get him!

216
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,540
See, the thing is with this little bit of forced-pige conflict,

217
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:24,540
in order to make it make sense for Frodo to send Sam away at all,

218
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:30,540
you have to push Sam so far away from his starting place that he's practically not the same character anymore.

219
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,540
Go home.

220
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:37,540
Or at the very least, has some terrible anger problems that are never addressed.

221
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:43,540
I personally think the reason that the forced-pige conflict has become such a distinctive and easy to identify thing

222
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:50,540
is the fact that Peter Jackson hasn't directed anything that was not an adaptation since Before Heavenly Creatures.

223
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,540
The closest thing would be District 9, which he neither wrote nor directed.

224
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,540
He's become a sort of auteur of adaptation,

225
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,540
and oddly enough, the book that he adapted that was the most faithful to the source material was The Lovely Bones,

226
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,540
which everyone hated.

227
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:12,540
So I'm not saying he's bad at adding conflict for the sake of adaptation.

228
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,540
Clearly he isn't clearly. He's very good at it. He's made a career out of it.

229
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:22,540
It's just sometimes the conflict he adds is a little over the top.

230
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:29,540
Yeah, so let's talk about Eowyn, who I think they actually did a really good job with in the extended cut.

231
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,540
In the Two Towers, she just sort of pines for Aragorn and wishes she could go off and fight,

232
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,540
and she doesn't really do anything until Return of the King, where she decides to fake being a man

233
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,540
so she too can ride into battle, and she sneaks Merry in with her.

234
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,540
And in doing so, they basically sneak around this loophole in this prophecy that says,

235
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,540
No man can kill the Witch-King of Angmar.

236
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,540
You fool. No man can kill me.

237
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,540
I am no man.

238
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,540
Cliche? Yes. Awesome?

239
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,540
Fuck yes.

240
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,540
So while it is nice to have at least one lady presence in an army of sausage,

241
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,540
and I honestly find her story and performance very compelling, especially in the extended cut,

242
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,540
Eowyn at the end just kind of gets shoved off on Faramir, which...

243
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,540
And behold, I will be a shieldmaiden no longer, nor vie with the great writers,

244
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,540
nor take joy only in the songs of slaying.

245
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,540
I will be a healer, and love all things that grow and are not barren.

246
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,540
No longer do I desire to be a queen.

247
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,540
I'm gonna settle!

248
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,540
You know who she should have ended up with?

249
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,540
Sorry.

250
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,540
The relationship between Eowyn and Merry is way better set up than Aragorn and Arwen,

251
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,540
and certainly Eowyn and Faramir.

252
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,540
I mean, look at these two. She helps him prepare for battle.

253
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,540
She believes in him.

254
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,540
You should not encourage him.

255
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,540
You should not doubt him.

256
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,540
They ride into battle together.

257
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,540
No! No!

258
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,540
They bond over love for their friends.

259
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,540
They slay the Witch King together!

260
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,540
If an elf and a human can get together and breed, why not a hobbit and a lady?

261
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,540
It's all I'm saying.

262
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,540
You are fair and brave and have much to live for.

263
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,540
And many who love you.

264
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,540
That is not subtext. That is text.

265
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:31,540
Even in the book, the Faramir thing is just kind of jammed in there at the last second,

266
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,540
and, you know, don't get me wrong, I like them both as characters,

267
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,540
and Faramir's a nice guy.

268
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,540
He's a lover, not a fighter, but come on, stupid rigid societal expectations.

269
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,540
This! This is a pure love.

270
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,540
Ride with me, my lady.

271
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,540
A lot of Eowyn's subplot got pushed into the extended edition,

272
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,540
which is kind of a shame because she's got a lot of compelling and interesting stuff,

273
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,540
but in the context of the whole trilogy, it's not a lot of payoff.

274
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,540
Her real arc is pretty much only in movie three,

275
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,540
and you've still got a lot of threads from movies one and two left dangling,

276
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,540
so in a way, that strength about movie three turns into a weakness.

277
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,540
You introduce new compelling stuff but end up having to cut it

278
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,540
because you have to tie up dangling threads from one and two.

279
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,540
Or not.

280
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,540
Oh my god, I've got so much crap to get through in so little time.

281
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,540
Hey.

282
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,540
Did you really just spend most of this review defending your one true ship?

283
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,540
It wasn't most of the review, no.

284
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,540
I mean, like, I spent all this time complaining about, like,

285
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,540
you know, shit they did end up changing,

286
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,540
and we were saying something they should have changed,

287
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,540
and you know, like, in terms of the screenplay,

288
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,540
things actually being set up well,

289
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,540
where it is in this case and not in others.

290
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,540
Yeah, what was that about you still having a lot to actually get through?

291
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,540
To wrap it up?

292
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,540
Wait, where have you been in the last two?

293
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,540
I was in the last two.

294
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,540
Oh, but I'm in the extended cuts.

295
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,540
Does that mean this is an extended cut?

296
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,540
Yep.

297
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,540
Aren't extended cuts usually cut in half?
