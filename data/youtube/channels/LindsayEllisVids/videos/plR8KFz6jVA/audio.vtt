WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.040
Well, here's to a successful first week.

00:06.040 --> 00:07.040
Cheers!

00:07.040 --> 00:09.480
To a successful-ish launch.

00:09.480 --> 00:12.280
Honestly, it did way better than I thought it would.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.560
At least in terms of rankings.

00:14.560 --> 00:20.520
I think the highest we ever got was like number seven under children's science fiction.

00:20.520 --> 00:24.860
And then in the Kindle Paranormal Romance we got up to like number six or so.

00:24.860 --> 00:29.320
And we were number two under hot new releases for Paranormal Romance.

00:29.320 --> 00:34.020
So that was also kind of a surprise because we only sold a few hundred copies.

00:34.020 --> 00:38.980
There was one person in the comments, however, who had a moment of, guys, no, because we

00:38.980 --> 00:40.340
outranked Wrinkle in Time.

00:40.340 --> 00:44.820
And I think you could see their heartbreak over their comment.

00:44.820 --> 00:46.540
Like, no, guys, no.

00:46.540 --> 00:52.740
Those rankings have nothing to do with the classicness of it, with the overall popularity.

00:52.740 --> 00:54.620
It's really just what's selling that day.

00:54.620 --> 00:56.300
What sold that day.

00:56.320 --> 01:03.440
So today's drink of the week is the Tennessee Hussie, which is a Brut Champagne and a Tennessee

01:03.440 --> 01:04.440
Honey.

01:04.440 --> 01:07.680
You have to find like a super dry champagne because this shit is really sweet.

01:07.680 --> 01:10.080
It's really, really sweet.

01:10.080 --> 01:11.400
Basically it's just whiskey with honey in it.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.400
It's good, though.

01:12.400 --> 01:15.220
It's just redonkulously sweet.

01:15.220 --> 01:19.880
We learned a lot about Poe's Law this week.

01:19.880 --> 01:26.200
The very day it got released, we ended up on like Fark and Reddit.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.380
There's a Lovecraft Reddit, turns out.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.900
People took what was on the tin for face value.

01:30.900 --> 01:35.620
Well, it's funny because people would like sneak into those threads and be like, guys,

01:35.620 --> 01:36.620
I think this is a joke.

01:36.620 --> 01:39.380
And someone else would jump in and be like, no, man, it's real.

01:39.380 --> 01:41.540
I think it was either from the Fark thread or the Reddit thread.

01:41.540 --> 01:44.260
They came in to troll Sarah's website.

01:44.260 --> 01:45.260
Poor Sarah.

01:45.260 --> 01:49.820
Jean-Francois Quaggy said, stop ruining Lovecraft's work.

01:49.820 --> 01:52.060
Why not have some imagination for a change?

01:52.060 --> 01:53.060
I'm honestly surprised.

01:53.060 --> 01:56.060
I thought we wouldn't really get any of the pro-Lovecraft people.

01:56.080 --> 01:59.400
I thought they'd kind of look at it and go, ha, and walk away.

01:59.400 --> 02:01.600
Lovecraft is serious business.

02:01.600 --> 02:06.240
Vivi Wannabe responded, she's not ruining it, she's expanding it.

02:06.240 --> 02:13.040
To which my personal favorite, Kaka Pizza, took it a step further, like, no, it's rape.

02:13.040 --> 02:15.840
Here we go.

02:15.840 --> 02:18.520
Yes, raping, says Kaka Pizza.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.960
Hey, Kaka Pizza, wanna know what's rape?

02:20.960 --> 02:21.960
Rape.

02:21.960 --> 02:22.960
Rape.

02:23.140 --> 02:27.660
As far as knowledge of the expanded mythos, I think we naysayers are fine, thank you bunch.

02:27.660 --> 02:30.180
And I'm all for funny Cthulhu paraphernalia.

02:30.180 --> 02:31.180
And this is rape.

02:31.180 --> 02:32.180
Yeah, rape.

02:32.180 --> 02:33.180
Rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, period.

02:33.180 --> 02:34.180
Rape.

02:34.180 --> 02:37.680
You see, all right, here's the thing.

02:37.680 --> 02:41.900
You keep saying that word, I don't think that word means what you think it means.

02:41.900 --> 02:45.580
He's like, guys, we gotta stop applying rape to, like, nostalgic sci-fi shit.

02:45.580 --> 02:47.180
To things you don't like.

02:47.180 --> 02:50.860
Bumblebee peeing on John Turturro is not rape.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.000
And Ninja Turtles is not rape.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.480
And young adult Cthulhu romance is not rape.

02:57.480 --> 03:00.520
But thank you, Kaka Pizza, you gave us a good laugh.

03:00.520 --> 03:05.800
On the other end of the, I think, the offended young adult fans, we have Goodreads.

03:05.800 --> 03:12.880
The funny thing is, Goodreads, uh, I'm tapping out.

03:12.880 --> 03:17.560
Goodreads has developed something of a subculture over the last few years.

03:17.580 --> 03:21.380
And honestly, I mean, like, I kind of knew about this in, like, a sort of knowing about

03:21.380 --> 03:22.540
it distantly sort of way.

03:22.540 --> 03:26.420
Well, that's why we made the character of Sarah, because we were aware of this sort

03:26.420 --> 03:34.260
of rising of authors actually engaging and even bullying detractors on sites like Goodreads.

03:34.260 --> 03:35.260
Yeah.

03:35.260 --> 03:40.100
Sarah, just so we're clear, is, does not exist, and she is a parody.

03:40.100 --> 03:46.020
Sarah herself is a parody of the thin-skinned, insecure Colleen Houcks and Becca Fitzpatricks

03:46.020 --> 03:49.880
and other authors that get in fights with their negative reviewers.

03:49.880 --> 03:56.040
So one person left a, um, a very negative review of the mere idea of the book, taking

03:56.040 --> 03:57.040
it at face value.

03:57.040 --> 04:00.480
But it was also so, like, over-the-top and ridiculous when we first read it, I think

04:00.480 --> 04:01.480
we were thinking...

04:01.480 --> 04:02.480
I thought she was one of ours.

04:02.480 --> 04:03.480
Yeah.

04:03.480 --> 04:04.480
Oopsie.

04:04.480 --> 04:07.720
Well, she mentioned, well, the other thing was, like, I should've known because she mentioned

04:07.720 --> 04:08.720
sock puppets.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.480
Guys, don't make sock puppets.

04:10.480 --> 04:11.480
Come on.

04:11.480 --> 04:14.440
I, I didn't, I didn't honestly think that people would do that.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.940
So she thought they were all Sarah.

04:16.940 --> 04:21.460
And so of course Sarah responded in her thin-skinned, insecure way, but in hindsight we probably

04:21.460 --> 04:24.820
should've tweeted it because I thought, you know, people would look at it and go, teehee,

04:24.820 --> 04:26.540
look at what Sarah said and not engage.

04:26.540 --> 04:29.300
Yeah, which, alright, moving forward.

04:29.300 --> 04:32.180
Write your reviews about it, be it negative or positive.

04:32.180 --> 04:35.500
Try to be as honest about the book as you can be.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.540
Don't harass people.

04:37.540 --> 04:38.540
Really don't harass people.

04:38.540 --> 04:41.780
Well, the other thing is, like, people have a very different, uh, idea of what harassment

04:41.780 --> 04:42.780
entails.

04:42.780 --> 04:46.000
Like, so many people jumped in on this girl and tried to explain to her what was going

04:46.000 --> 04:50.720
on and she was just like, no, I'm a social justice crusader, I'm blocking everyone.

04:50.720 --> 04:51.720
That was fascinating.

04:51.720 --> 04:55.880
She, she, she was kind of painting herself as like this Edward Snowden whistleblower

04:55.880 --> 05:00.840
who was like over here, like, letting, giving the truth to the masses and it was just like,

05:00.840 --> 05:03.480
oh, our cover's blown, you guys.

05:03.480 --> 05:06.560
I trust that most people who bought the book bought it knowing that it was a parody and

05:06.560 --> 05:07.680
had a good laugh.

05:07.680 --> 05:11.080
Some people have left reviews saying that it was not a good parody and that's fine.

05:11.080 --> 05:12.080
Yeah.

05:12.380 --> 05:15.620
Some people have left reviews being like, this was actually a better written book than

05:15.620 --> 05:16.820
I thought it would be.

05:16.820 --> 05:18.620
I, I had that feeling when we were writing it.

05:18.620 --> 05:21.660
We were just like, this is way too cohesive for the things we're parodying.

05:21.660 --> 05:25.220
Yes, it's a ridiculous parody, but we did want it to have like an engaging story and

05:25.220 --> 05:28.260
characters that you like and make sense and have a voice.

05:28.260 --> 05:31.900
Well, I think then it comes down to what's the difference between parody and satire?

05:31.900 --> 05:35.100
Well, that's, it's almost like the next point just found itself.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.100
Let's talk about that.

05:36.100 --> 05:43.520
In a way, I feel like this whole project kind of has elements of both.

05:43.520 --> 05:51.000
Um, I feel like Sarah is a satire, but in the way that Stephen Colbert is, but, uh,

05:51.000 --> 05:53.960
the book itself is definitely a parody.

05:53.960 --> 05:59.960
Satire is pretend, is pretending to be something it's not in order to make a comment on something

05:59.960 --> 06:08.300
else like society usually, whereas parody is just an over the top, stupidification of

06:08.300 --> 06:09.300
the product.

06:09.300 --> 06:12.220
So basically satire is about society, parody is about the product.

06:12.220 --> 06:17.320
What parody there is in it, even though it's silly and a ridiculous premise, we're remarkably

06:17.320 --> 06:18.580
subtle about it.

06:18.580 --> 06:22.860
When you look at things like Board of the Rings, well, that's, that's why I tend not

06:22.860 --> 06:27.940
to like feature length parodies and why I thought like we did need to be a stealth parody

06:27.940 --> 06:30.420
in order for the damn thing to be readable.

06:30.420 --> 06:34.000
Because like I've read Board of the Rings and no joke, it was one of the worst things

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
I've ever read.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.780
It was so awful.

06:36.780 --> 06:40.820
Like it was just like poop and fart jokes and there's sort of that thing with the National

06:40.820 --> 06:47.940
Lampoon style of parody that it's great for like short form SNL stuff, but like man, like

06:47.940 --> 06:49.940
long form, you're just like, no.

06:49.940 --> 06:50.940
Yeah.

06:50.940 --> 06:52.780
Well, like it's like that parody of Game of Thrones.

06:52.780 --> 06:57.900
The success of the show is linked to its two creative consultants, author George RR Martin

06:58.220 --> 07:02.740
I'm on set to ensure that the show honors the spirit of my books.

07:02.740 --> 07:11.220
And Adam Friedberg, a 13 year old boy, I make sure there are lots of boobs in the show.

07:11.220 --> 07:14.540
And that was a three minute skit, but could you imagine a feature length of that?

07:14.540 --> 07:15.980
No, it would be unbearable.

07:15.980 --> 07:20.980
Spaceballs and Young Frankenstein, I think are good examples of bearable parodies.

07:20.980 --> 07:27.220
They have lovable and memorable characters on top of basically existing to play up genre

07:27.220 --> 07:29.220
tropes and poke fun at them.

07:29.220 --> 07:33.340
In a way, in our own wicked way, we do kind of love the Young Adult Paranormal Romance

07:33.340 --> 07:35.980
thing because it wouldn't engage us so much.

07:35.980 --> 07:39.660
There wasn't something about it that just kind of captured our fancy.

07:39.660 --> 07:40.660
Yeah.

07:40.660 --> 07:44.260
But I think it was Mel Brooks who said like, you make a parody because you love it.

07:44.260 --> 07:45.260
Yeah.

07:45.260 --> 07:46.580
To an extent.

07:46.580 --> 07:52.260
My attitude on Young Adult is complicated in the same way that my attitude on Transformers

07:52.260 --> 07:53.260
is complicated.

07:53.260 --> 07:54.260
It's complicated.

07:54.300 --> 07:55.300
It's complicated.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.900
It's like my Facebook status.

07:56.900 --> 07:59.300
It's complicated with Young Adult Paranormal Romance.

07:59.300 --> 08:00.300
And Transformers.

08:00.300 --> 08:01.300
And also Transformers.

08:01.300 --> 08:02.300
It's polyamorous.

08:02.300 --> 08:03.300
Mermaid Transformers.

08:03.300 --> 08:04.300
Mermaid Transformers.

08:04.300 --> 08:05.300
What the fuck?

08:05.300 --> 08:14.860
You know what's real sad is like I went for like my whole life not knowing about that

08:14.860 --> 08:19.860
and if I did know about it, my brain went, nope, nope, and just blocked it.

08:19.860 --> 08:22.860
No, I did that when Bumblebee peed on a guy.

08:23.060 --> 08:26.060
My brain went, nope, and I just forgot about it.

08:26.060 --> 08:30.060
It was like the truck nuts in the second movie.

08:30.060 --> 08:35.060
See, this is what happens when I start talking about Transformers.

08:35.060 --> 08:36.060
Now we're Transformers.

08:36.060 --> 08:38.060
Back to YA Paranormal Romance.

08:38.060 --> 08:41.780
We as a culture have become so obsessed with it because it's become so popular, but at

08:41.780 --> 08:47.300
the same time, it's not like there's nothing redeemable about that sort of first love and

08:47.300 --> 08:50.460
adding this magical element into it.

08:50.980 --> 08:55.580
We really did get caught up in the story, like especially the secondary characters.

08:55.580 --> 08:59.900
To me, I think that is sort of the worst thing about this book as a reading experience is

08:59.900 --> 09:01.460
that the main character is so awful.

09:01.460 --> 09:04.460
They made her really awful.

09:04.460 --> 09:09.740
And I'm having the same problem with American Gods, which I'm just now getting around to

09:09.740 --> 09:13.380
reading and I'll read like 50 pages like, I hate you, Shadow.

09:13.380 --> 09:16.940
I'm going to read another book and I'll like blow through another book, go back to American

09:16.940 --> 09:17.940
Gods.

09:17.940 --> 09:18.940
Fuck this.

09:18.940 --> 09:19.940
Another book.

09:19.940 --> 09:20.940
Blow through that one.

09:20.940 --> 09:21.940
Fuck.

09:21.940 --> 09:22.940
I'm not a book.

09:22.940 --> 09:23.940
Some American Gods.

09:23.940 --> 09:28.220
So if that is parody, it's something that plays up the tropes, either lovingly or not,

09:28.220 --> 09:32.220
Board of the Rings.

09:32.220 --> 09:33.220
What is satire?

09:33.220 --> 09:39.980
When I think satire, I always think back to Jonathan Swift and it's a clashing example.

09:39.980 --> 09:43.580
Yeah, that's what they teach in high school English because it's so obvious and it's so

09:43.580 --> 09:44.580
over the top.

09:44.580 --> 09:47.260
And yet people really did legitimately think he was serious.

09:47.260 --> 09:48.260
Yeah.

09:48.260 --> 09:55.860
So I feel like it kind of in ways is both depending on which attitude you take.

09:55.860 --> 10:00.860
That said, I don't feel like this book is really trying to make a comment on society,

10:00.860 --> 10:04.660
nor is the project at this point because it's so obviously a parody.

10:04.660 --> 10:13.060
To me anyway, because we created Sarah, I think we are making some sort of loving jive

10:13.060 --> 10:16.140
at our modern ages and the internet ages.

10:16.140 --> 10:18.620
I feel no loving anything towards these authors.

10:18.620 --> 10:19.620
Okay.

10:19.620 --> 10:24.300
If you are an author that gets in goodreads fights with your detractors, you suck.

10:24.300 --> 10:27.380
Like straight up, stop it.

10:27.380 --> 10:28.940
Like what the fuck are you doing?

10:28.940 --> 10:31.660
You're hurting America.

10:31.660 --> 10:34.240
Writing fiction is such a personal thing.

10:34.240 --> 10:38.380
And so whenever people go after little tiny books about how fucking awful they are, then

10:38.380 --> 10:41.940
I feel kind of like, guys, come on, you know?

10:41.940 --> 10:47.340
But then there are the Fifty Shades of Grey's where it's like, hey, you just romanticized

10:47.340 --> 10:48.340
like abuse.

10:48.340 --> 10:56.220
And to have an author then go, lol, nope, my fantasy, lol, fly off to the sun.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.340
I mean, that's what drives me crazy.

10:58.340 --> 11:03.460
That's what's so fascinating about these types is this sort of just like, no, whenever they

11:03.460 --> 11:08.540
hear criticism and that they need to correct people, people like EL James and Colleen Houck

11:08.540 --> 11:13.380
and that there's just so such insecurity and such a thin skin that they just need to

11:13.380 --> 11:18.820
know and like react against these people who aren't getting it.

11:18.820 --> 11:27.020
People who interact with their fan base or with humanity in general as a creator of art,

11:27.020 --> 11:30.420
who act that way, like it bothers me.

11:30.420 --> 11:33.420
Well, here's the other thing.

11:33.420 --> 11:35.180
Writing fiction is hard.

11:35.180 --> 11:37.720
You put something of yourself into it.

11:37.720 --> 11:43.080
Something that you yourself probably may not even consciously perceive, you know, like

11:43.080 --> 11:46.040
my kinky shit or my daddy issues or whatever.

11:46.040 --> 11:51.480
But the thing is, world, when you put anything out into a public sphere, you are opening

11:51.480 --> 11:53.480
it to criticism.

11:53.480 --> 11:58.520
And you are not exempt from it just because it's your fantasy or someone doesn't get it.

11:58.520 --> 12:05.480
Or especially if they're trying to call you out on being like a romanticizing abuse, EL

12:05.480 --> 12:06.480
James.

12:06.480 --> 12:11.680
I think the thing that has most been revealed to me in this whole thing, having our baby

12:11.680 --> 12:19.280
now released to the world at large, is how quickly and almost foolishly people get passionate

12:19.280 --> 12:20.280
about things.

12:20.280 --> 12:21.280
And that's not a terrible thing, though.

12:21.280 --> 12:25.400
Well, I mean, it is kind of funny that, you know, it's like we created Sarah as a parody

12:25.400 --> 12:27.480
of drama and then actual drama happened.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.480
It was like, no, we didn't want that.

12:30.480 --> 12:31.480
What have we done?

12:31.480 --> 12:33.480
Oh, God, we've created a monster.

12:33.480 --> 12:36.280
Edward Snowden has to do the right thing, man.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.280
Gotta blow that whistle.

12:37.280 --> 12:38.280
People may not like the truth.

12:38.280 --> 12:39.280
Because it's a scam.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.280
Because it's a scam.

12:40.280 --> 12:47.280
But the thing is, for the most part, we've been having so much fun with what people are

12:47.280 --> 12:48.280
doing.

12:48.280 --> 12:51.280
There's Awoken fanfic now, which is the greatest.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.280
Oh, my God, yes.

12:52.280 --> 12:54.280
People live blogging the book has been hilarious.

12:54.280 --> 12:57.280
Oh, you have made my workday so much more pleasurable.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.280
Thank you.

12:58.280 --> 13:04.280
Special shout out to Theole, whose live blog has been hilarious.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.280
And we've like read out loud at parties.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.280
So in the meantime, keep leaving reviews.

13:08.280 --> 13:12.280
Of course, if you still want it on Kindle or paperback, you can do it down there.

13:12.280 --> 13:13.280
Yeah.

13:13.280 --> 13:16.280
And of course, we have great fun with all of them.

13:16.280 --> 13:18.280
Be honest as you like.

13:18.280 --> 13:19.280
We hope you find it funny.

13:19.280 --> 13:20.280
We want it to be funny.

13:20.280 --> 13:21.280
Yeah.

13:21.280 --> 13:26.280
But by all means, be honest if you feel like it's a, someone once put it as a really good

13:26.280 --> 13:29.280
second draft, which I'm fine with.

13:29.280 --> 13:30.280
Oh, my God.

13:30.280 --> 13:36.280
It's actually almost like, that's a go team.

13:36.280 --> 13:42.280
Considering we're consolidating the writing of eight authors, like, hey, I'll take it.

13:42.280 --> 13:48.280
After the, you know, we keep tracking this and see where it goes.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.280
Sequel.

14:00.280 --> 14:02.280
Yeah.
