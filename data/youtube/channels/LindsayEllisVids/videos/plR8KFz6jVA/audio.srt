1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
Well, here's to a successful first week.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,040
Cheers!

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,480
To a successful-ish launch.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,280
Honestly, it did way better than I thought it would.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,560
At least in terms of rankings.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,520
I think the highest we ever got was like number seven under children's science fiction.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,860
And then in the Kindle Paranormal Romance we got up to like number six or so.

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,320
And we were number two under hot new releases for Paranormal Romance.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,020
So that was also kind of a surprise because we only sold a few hundred copies.

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,980
There was one person in the comments, however, who had a moment of, guys, no, because we

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,340
outranked Wrinkle in Time.

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,820
And I think you could see their heartbreak over their comment.

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,540
Like, no, guys, no.

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:52,740
Those rankings have nothing to do with the classicness of it, with the overall popularity.

15
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,620
It's really just what's selling that day.

16
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,300
What sold that day.

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,440
So today's drink of the week is the Tennessee Hussie, which is a Brut Champagne and a Tennessee

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
Honey.

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,680
You have to find like a super dry champagne because this shit is really sweet.

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,080
It's really, really sweet.

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,400
Basically it's just whiskey with honey in it.

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
It's good, though.

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,220
It's just redonkulously sweet.

24
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,880
We learned a lot about Poe's Law this week.

25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:26,200
The very day it got released, we ended up on like Fark and Reddit.

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,380
There's a Lovecraft Reddit, turns out.

27
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,900
People took what was on the tin for face value.

28
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,620
Well, it's funny because people would like sneak into those threads and be like, guys,

29
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,620
I think this is a joke.

30
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,380
And someone else would jump in and be like, no, man, it's real.

31
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,540
I think it was either from the Fark thread or the Reddit thread.

32
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,260
They came in to troll Sarah's website.

33
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,260
Poor Sarah.

34
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,820
Jean-Francois Quaggy said, stop ruining Lovecraft's work.

35
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,060
Why not have some imagination for a change?

36
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,060
I'm honestly surprised.

37
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,060
I thought we wouldn't really get any of the pro-Lovecraft people.

38
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,400
I thought they'd kind of look at it and go, ha, and walk away.

39
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,600
Lovecraft is serious business.

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,240
Vivi Wannabe responded, she's not ruining it, she's expanding it.

41
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:13,040
To which my personal favorite, Kaka Pizza, took it a step further, like, no, it's rape.

42
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,840
Here we go.

43
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,520
Yes, raping, says Kaka Pizza.

44
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,960
Hey, Kaka Pizza, wanna know what's rape?

45
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
Rape.

46
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Rape.

47
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,660
As far as knowledge of the expanded mythos, I think we naysayers are fine, thank you bunch.

48
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,180
And I'm all for funny Cthulhu paraphernalia.

49
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,180
And this is rape.

50
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,180
Yeah, rape.

51
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,180
Rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, period.

52
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,180
Rape.

53
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,680
You see, all right, here's the thing.

54
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,900
You keep saying that word, I don't think that word means what you think it means.

55
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,580
He's like, guys, we gotta stop applying rape to, like, nostalgic sci-fi shit.

56
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,180
To things you don't like.

57
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,860
Bumblebee peeing on John Turturro is not rape.

58
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,000
And Ninja Turtles is not rape.

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,480
And young adult Cthulhu romance is not rape.

60
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,520
But thank you, Kaka Pizza, you gave us a good laugh.

61
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,800
On the other end of the, I think, the offended young adult fans, we have Goodreads.

62
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:12,880
The funny thing is, Goodreads, uh, I'm tapping out.

63
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,560
Goodreads has developed something of a subculture over the last few years.

64
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,380
And honestly, I mean, like, I kind of knew about this in, like, a sort of knowing about

65
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,540
it distantly sort of way.

66
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,420
Well, that's why we made the character of Sarah, because we were aware of this sort

67
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:34,260
of rising of authors actually engaging and even bullying detractors on sites like Goodreads.

68
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,260
Yeah.

69
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:40,100
Sarah, just so we're clear, is, does not exist, and she is a parody.

70
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:46,020
Sarah herself is a parody of the thin-skinned, insecure Colleen Houcks and Becca Fitzpatricks

71
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,880
and other authors that get in fights with their negative reviewers.

72
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:56,040
So one person left a, um, a very negative review of the mere idea of the book, taking

73
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,040
it at face value.

74
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,480
But it was also so, like, over-the-top and ridiculous when we first read it, I think

75
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480
we were thinking...

76
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,480
I thought she was one of ours.

77
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,480
Yeah.

78
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
Oopsie.

79
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,720
Well, she mentioned, well, the other thing was, like, I should've known because she mentioned

80
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,720
sock puppets.

81
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,480
Guys, don't make sock puppets.

82
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,480
Come on.

83
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,440
I, I didn't, I didn't honestly think that people would do that.

84
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,940
So she thought they were all Sarah.

85
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,460
And so of course Sarah responded in her thin-skinned, insecure way, but in hindsight we probably

86
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,820
should've tweeted it because I thought, you know, people would look at it and go, teehee,

87
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,540
look at what Sarah said and not engage.

88
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,300
Yeah, which, alright, moving forward.

89
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,180
Write your reviews about it, be it negative or positive.

90
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,500
Try to be as honest about the book as you can be.

91
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,540
Don't harass people.

92
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,540
Really don't harass people.

93
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,780
Well, the other thing is, like, people have a very different, uh, idea of what harassment

94
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,780
entails.

95
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,000
Like, so many people jumped in on this girl and tried to explain to her what was going

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,720
on and she was just like, no, I'm a social justice crusader, I'm blocking everyone.

97
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
That was fascinating.

98
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,880
She, she, she was kind of painting herself as like this Edward Snowden whistleblower

99
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,840
who was like over here, like, letting, giving the truth to the masses and it was just like,

100
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,480
oh, our cover's blown, you guys.

101
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,560
I trust that most people who bought the book bought it knowing that it was a parody and

102
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,680
had a good laugh.

103
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,080
Some people have left reviews saying that it was not a good parody and that's fine.

104
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Yeah.

105
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,620
Some people have left reviews being like, this was actually a better written book than

106
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,820
I thought it would be.

107
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,620
I, I had that feeling when we were writing it.

108
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,660
We were just like, this is way too cohesive for the things we're parodying.

109
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,220
Yes, it's a ridiculous parody, but we did want it to have like an engaging story and

110
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,260
characters that you like and make sense and have a voice.

111
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,900
Well, I think then it comes down to what's the difference between parody and satire?

112
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,100
Well, that's, it's almost like the next point just found itself.

113
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,100
Let's talk about that.

114
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:43,520
In a way, I feel like this whole project kind of has elements of both.

115
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:51,000
Um, I feel like Sarah is a satire, but in the way that Stephen Colbert is, but, uh,

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,960
the book itself is definitely a parody.

117
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,960
Satire is pretend, is pretending to be something it's not in order to make a comment on something

118
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:08,300
else like society usually, whereas parody is just an over the top, stupidification of

119
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,300
the product.

120
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,220
So basically satire is about society, parody is about the product.

121
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,320
What parody there is in it, even though it's silly and a ridiculous premise, we're remarkably

122
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,580
subtle about it.

123
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,860
When you look at things like Board of the Rings, well, that's, that's why I tend not

124
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,940
to like feature length parodies and why I thought like we did need to be a stealth parody

125
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,420
in order for the damn thing to be readable.

126
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,000
Because like I've read Board of the Rings and no joke, it was one of the worst things

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I've ever read.

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,780
It was so awful.

129
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,820
Like it was just like poop and fart jokes and there's sort of that thing with the National

130
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:47,940
Lampoon style of parody that it's great for like short form SNL stuff, but like man, like

131
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,940
long form, you're just like, no.

132
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,940
Yeah.

133
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,780
Well, like it's like that parody of Game of Thrones.

134
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,900
The success of the show is linked to its two creative consultants, author George RR Martin

135
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,740
I'm on set to ensure that the show honors the spirit of my books.

136
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:11,220
And Adam Friedberg, a 13 year old boy, I make sure there are lots of boobs in the show.

137
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,540
And that was a three minute skit, but could you imagine a feature length of that?

138
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,980
No, it would be unbearable.

139
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,980
Spaceballs and Young Frankenstein, I think are good examples of bearable parodies.

140
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:27,220
They have lovable and memorable characters on top of basically existing to play up genre

141
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,220
tropes and poke fun at them.

142
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,340
In a way, in our own wicked way, we do kind of love the Young Adult Paranormal Romance

143
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,980
thing because it wouldn't engage us so much.

144
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,660
There wasn't something about it that just kind of captured our fancy.

145
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,660
Yeah.

146
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,260
But I think it was Mel Brooks who said like, you make a parody because you love it.

147
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,260
Yeah.

148
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,580
To an extent.

149
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:52,260
My attitude on Young Adult is complicated in the same way that my attitude on Transformers

150
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,260
is complicated.

151
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,260
It's complicated.

152
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,300
It's complicated.

153
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,900
It's like my Facebook status.

154
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,300
It's complicated with Young Adult Paranormal Romance.

155
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,300
And Transformers.

156
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,300
And also Transformers.

157
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,300
It's polyamorous.

158
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,300
Mermaid Transformers.

159
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,300
Mermaid Transformers.

160
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,300
What the fuck?

161
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:14,860
You know what's real sad is like I went for like my whole life not knowing about that

162
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,860
and if I did know about it, my brain went, nope, nope, and just blocked it.

163
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,860
No, I did that when Bumblebee peed on a guy.

164
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,060
My brain went, nope, and I just forgot about it.

165
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,060
It was like the truck nuts in the second movie.

166
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,060
See, this is what happens when I start talking about Transformers.

167
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,060
Now we're Transformers.

168
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,060
Back to YA Paranormal Romance.

169
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,780
We as a culture have become so obsessed with it because it's become so popular, but at

170
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:47,300
the same time, it's not like there's nothing redeemable about that sort of first love and

171
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,460
adding this magical element into it.

172
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:55,580
We really did get caught up in the story, like especially the secondary characters.

173
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,900
To me, I think that is sort of the worst thing about this book as a reading experience is

174
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,460
that the main character is so awful.

175
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,460
They made her really awful.

176
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,740
And I'm having the same problem with American Gods, which I'm just now getting around to

177
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,380
reading and I'll read like 50 pages like, I hate you, Shadow.

178
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,940
I'm going to read another book and I'll like blow through another book, go back to American

179
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,940
Gods.

180
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,940
Fuck this.

181
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,940
Another book.

182
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,940
Blow through that one.

183
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,940
Fuck.

184
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,940
I'm not a book.

185
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,940
Some American Gods.

186
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,220
So if that is parody, it's something that plays up the tropes, either lovingly or not,

187
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,220
Board of the Rings.

188
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,220
What is satire?

189
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:39,980
When I think satire, I always think back to Jonathan Swift and it's a clashing example.

190
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,580
Yeah, that's what they teach in high school English because it's so obvious and it's so

191
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,580
over the top.

192
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,260
And yet people really did legitimately think he was serious.

193
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,260
Yeah.

194
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:55,860
So I feel like it kind of in ways is both depending on which attitude you take.

195
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,860
That said, I don't feel like this book is really trying to make a comment on society,

196
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,660
nor is the project at this point because it's so obviously a parody.

197
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:13,060
To me anyway, because we created Sarah, I think we are making some sort of loving jive

198
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,140
at our modern ages and the internet ages.

199
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,620
I feel no loving anything towards these authors.

200
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,620
Okay.

201
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,300
If you are an author that gets in goodreads fights with your detractors, you suck.

202
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,380
Like straight up, stop it.

203
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,940
Like what the fuck are you doing?

204
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,660
You're hurting America.

205
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,240
Writing fiction is such a personal thing.

206
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,380
And so whenever people go after little tiny books about how fucking awful they are, then

207
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,940
I feel kind of like, guys, come on, you know?

208
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:47,340
But then there are the Fifty Shades of Grey's where it's like, hey, you just romanticized

209
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,340
like abuse.

210
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:56,220
And to have an author then go, lol, nope, my fantasy, lol, fly off to the sun.

211
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,340
I mean, that's what drives me crazy.

212
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,460
That's what's so fascinating about these types is this sort of just like, no, whenever they

213
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:08,540
hear criticism and that they need to correct people, people like EL James and Colleen Houck

214
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:13,380
and that there's just so such insecurity and such a thin skin that they just need to

215
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,820
know and like react against these people who aren't getting it.

216
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:27,020
People who interact with their fan base or with humanity in general as a creator of art,

217
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,420
who act that way, like it bothers me.

218
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,420
Well, here's the other thing.

219
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,180
Writing fiction is hard.

220
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,720
You put something of yourself into it.

221
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,080
Something that you yourself probably may not even consciously perceive, you know, like

222
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,040
my kinky shit or my daddy issues or whatever.

223
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,480
But the thing is, world, when you put anything out into a public sphere, you are opening

224
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,480
it to criticism.

225
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,520
And you are not exempt from it just because it's your fantasy or someone doesn't get it.

226
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:05,480
Or especially if they're trying to call you out on being like a romanticizing abuse, EL

227
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
James.

228
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,680
I think the thing that has most been revealed to me in this whole thing, having our baby

229
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:19,280
now released to the world at large, is how quickly and almost foolishly people get passionate

230
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
about things.

231
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
And that's not a terrible thing, though.

232
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,400
Well, I mean, it is kind of funny that, you know, it's like we created Sarah as a parody

233
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,480
of drama and then actual drama happened.

234
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,480
It was like, no, we didn't want that.

235
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
What have we done?

236
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,480
Oh, God, we've created a monster.

237
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,280
Edward Snowden has to do the right thing, man.

238
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Gotta blow that whistle.

239
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
People may not like the truth.

240
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,280
Because it's a scam.

241
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Because it's a scam.

242
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:47,280
But the thing is, for the most part, we've been having so much fun with what people are

243
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,280
doing.

244
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,280
There's Awoken fanfic now, which is the greatest.

245
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Oh, my God, yes.

246
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,280
People live blogging the book has been hilarious.

247
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,280
Oh, you have made my workday so much more pleasurable.

248
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,280
Thank you.

249
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:04,280
Special shout out to Theole, whose live blog has been hilarious.

250
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,280
And we've like read out loud at parties.

251
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
So in the meantime, keep leaving reviews.

252
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,280
Of course, if you still want it on Kindle or paperback, you can do it down there.

253
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
Yeah.

254
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,280
And of course, we have great fun with all of them.

255
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,280
Be honest as you like.

256
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
We hope you find it funny.

257
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,280
We want it to be funny.

258
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,280
Yeah.

259
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,280
But by all means, be honest if you feel like it's a, someone once put it as a really good

260
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,280
second draft, which I'm fine with.

261
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,280
Oh, my God.

262
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:36,280
It's actually almost like, that's a go team.

263
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:42,280
Considering we're consolidating the writing of eight authors, like, hey, I'll take it.

264
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:48,280
After the, you know, we keep tracking this and see where it goes.

265
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,280
Sequel.

266
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,280
Yeah.
