0	6040	Well, here's to a successful first week.
6040	7040	Cheers!
7040	9480	To a successful-ish launch.
9480	12280	Honestly, it did way better than I thought it would.
12280	14560	At least in terms of rankings.
14560	20520	I think the highest we ever got was like number seven under children's science fiction.
20520	24860	And then in the Kindle Paranormal Romance we got up to like number six or so.
24860	29320	And we were number two under hot new releases for Paranormal Romance.
29320	34020	So that was also kind of a surprise because we only sold a few hundred copies.
34020	38980	There was one person in the comments, however, who had a moment of, guys, no, because we
38980	40340	outranked Wrinkle in Time.
40340	44820	And I think you could see their heartbreak over their comment.
44820	46540	Like, no, guys, no.
46540	52740	Those rankings have nothing to do with the classicness of it, with the overall popularity.
52740	54620	It's really just what's selling that day.
54620	56300	What sold that day.
56320	63440	So today's drink of the week is the Tennessee Hussie, which is a Brut Champagne and a Tennessee
63440	64440	Honey.
64440	67680	You have to find like a super dry champagne because this shit is really sweet.
67680	70080	It's really, really sweet.
70080	71400	Basically it's just whiskey with honey in it.
71400	72400	It's good, though.
72400	75220	It's just redonkulously sweet.
75220	79880	We learned a lot about Poe's Law this week.
79880	86200	The very day it got released, we ended up on like Fark and Reddit.
86200	88380	There's a Lovecraft Reddit, turns out.
88380	90900	People took what was on the tin for face value.
90900	95620	Well, it's funny because people would like sneak into those threads and be like, guys,
95620	96620	I think this is a joke.
96620	99380	And someone else would jump in and be like, no, man, it's real.
99380	101540	I think it was either from the Fark thread or the Reddit thread.
101540	104260	They came in to troll Sarah's website.
104260	105260	Poor Sarah.
105260	109820	Jean-Francois Quaggy said, stop ruining Lovecraft's work.
109820	112060	Why not have some imagination for a change?
112060	113060	I'm honestly surprised.
113060	116060	I thought we wouldn't really get any of the pro-Lovecraft people.
116080	119400	I thought they'd kind of look at it and go, ha, and walk away.
119400	121600	Lovecraft is serious business.
121600	126240	Vivi Wannabe responded, she's not ruining it, she's expanding it.
126240	133040	To which my personal favorite, Kaka Pizza, took it a step further, like, no, it's rape.
133040	135840	Here we go.
135840	138520	Yes, raping, says Kaka Pizza.
138520	140960	Hey, Kaka Pizza, wanna know what's rape?
140960	141960	Rape.
141960	142960	Rape.
143140	147660	As far as knowledge of the expanded mythos, I think we naysayers are fine, thank you bunch.
147660	150180	And I'm all for funny Cthulhu paraphernalia.
150180	151180	And this is rape.
151180	152180	Yeah, rape.
152180	153180	Rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, period.
153180	154180	Rape.
154180	157680	You see, all right, here's the thing.
157680	161900	You keep saying that word, I don't think that word means what you think it means.
161900	165580	He's like, guys, we gotta stop applying rape to, like, nostalgic sci-fi shit.
165580	167180	To things you don't like.
167180	170860	Bumblebee peeing on John Turturro is not rape.
170960	173000	And Ninja Turtles is not rape.
173000	177480	And young adult Cthulhu romance is not rape.
177480	180520	But thank you, Kaka Pizza, you gave us a good laugh.
180520	185800	On the other end of the, I think, the offended young adult fans, we have Goodreads.
185800	192880	The funny thing is, Goodreads, uh, I'm tapping out.
192880	197560	Goodreads has developed something of a subculture over the last few years.
197580	201380	And honestly, I mean, like, I kind of knew about this in, like, a sort of knowing about
201380	202540	it distantly sort of way.
202540	206420	Well, that's why we made the character of Sarah, because we were aware of this sort
206420	214260	of rising of authors actually engaging and even bullying detractors on sites like Goodreads.
214260	215260	Yeah.
215260	220100	Sarah, just so we're clear, is, does not exist, and she is a parody.
220100	226020	Sarah herself is a parody of the thin-skinned, insecure Colleen Houcks and Becca Fitzpatricks
226020	229880	and other authors that get in fights with their negative reviewers.
229880	236040	So one person left a, um, a very negative review of the mere idea of the book, taking
236040	237040	it at face value.
237040	240480	But it was also so, like, over-the-top and ridiculous when we first read it, I think
240480	241480	we were thinking...
241480	242480	I thought she was one of ours.
242480	243480	Yeah.
243480	244480	Oopsie.
244480	247720	Well, she mentioned, well, the other thing was, like, I should've known because she mentioned
247720	248720	sock puppets.
248720	250480	Guys, don't make sock puppets.
250480	251480	Come on.
251480	254440	I, I didn't, I didn't honestly think that people would do that.
254440	256940	So she thought they were all Sarah.
256940	261460	And so of course Sarah responded in her thin-skinned, insecure way, but in hindsight we probably
261460	264820	should've tweeted it because I thought, you know, people would look at it and go, teehee,
264820	266540	look at what Sarah said and not engage.
266540	269300	Yeah, which, alright, moving forward.
269300	272180	Write your reviews about it, be it negative or positive.
272180	275500	Try to be as honest about the book as you can be.
275500	277540	Don't harass people.
277540	278540	Really don't harass people.
278540	281780	Well, the other thing is, like, people have a very different, uh, idea of what harassment
281780	282780	entails.
282780	286000	Like, so many people jumped in on this girl and tried to explain to her what was going
286000	290720	on and she was just like, no, I'm a social justice crusader, I'm blocking everyone.
290720	291720	That was fascinating.
291720	295880	She, she, she was kind of painting herself as like this Edward Snowden whistleblower
295880	300840	who was like over here, like, letting, giving the truth to the masses and it was just like,
300840	303480	oh, our cover's blown, you guys.
303480	306560	I trust that most people who bought the book bought it knowing that it was a parody and
306560	307680	had a good laugh.
307680	311080	Some people have left reviews saying that it was not a good parody and that's fine.
311080	312080	Yeah.
312380	315620	Some people have left reviews being like, this was actually a better written book than
315620	316820	I thought it would be.
316820	318620	I, I had that feeling when we were writing it.
318620	321660	We were just like, this is way too cohesive for the things we're parodying.
321660	325220	Yes, it's a ridiculous parody, but we did want it to have like an engaging story and
325220	328260	characters that you like and make sense and have a voice.
328260	331900	Well, I think then it comes down to what's the difference between parody and satire?
331900	335100	Well, that's, it's almost like the next point just found itself.
335100	336100	Let's talk about that.
336100	343520	In a way, I feel like this whole project kind of has elements of both.
343520	351000	Um, I feel like Sarah is a satire, but in the way that Stephen Colbert is, but, uh,
351000	353960	the book itself is definitely a parody.
353960	359960	Satire is pretend, is pretending to be something it's not in order to make a comment on something
359960	368300	else like society usually, whereas parody is just an over the top, stupidification of
368300	369300	the product.
369300	372220	So basically satire is about society, parody is about the product.
372220	377320	What parody there is in it, even though it's silly and a ridiculous premise, we're remarkably
377320	378580	subtle about it.
378580	382860	When you look at things like Board of the Rings, well, that's, that's why I tend not
382860	387940	to like feature length parodies and why I thought like we did need to be a stealth parody
387940	390420	in order for the damn thing to be readable.
390420	394000	Because like I've read Board of the Rings and no joke, it was one of the worst things
394000	395000	I've ever read.
395000	396780	It was so awful.
396780	400820	Like it was just like poop and fart jokes and there's sort of that thing with the National
400820	407940	Lampoon style of parody that it's great for like short form SNL stuff, but like man, like
407940	409940	long form, you're just like, no.
409940	410940	Yeah.
410940	412780	Well, like it's like that parody of Game of Thrones.
412780	417900	The success of the show is linked to its two creative consultants, author George RR Martin
418220	422740	I'm on set to ensure that the show honors the spirit of my books.
422740	431220	And Adam Friedberg, a 13 year old boy, I make sure there are lots of boobs in the show.
431220	434540	And that was a three minute skit, but could you imagine a feature length of that?
434540	435980	No, it would be unbearable.
435980	440980	Spaceballs and Young Frankenstein, I think are good examples of bearable parodies.
440980	447220	They have lovable and memorable characters on top of basically existing to play up genre
447220	449220	tropes and poke fun at them.
449220	453340	In a way, in our own wicked way, we do kind of love the Young Adult Paranormal Romance
453340	455980	thing because it wouldn't engage us so much.
455980	459660	There wasn't something about it that just kind of captured our fancy.
459660	460660	Yeah.
460660	464260	But I think it was Mel Brooks who said like, you make a parody because you love it.
464260	465260	Yeah.
465260	466580	To an extent.
466580	472260	My attitude on Young Adult is complicated in the same way that my attitude on Transformers
472260	473260	is complicated.
473260	474260	It's complicated.
474300	475300	It's complicated.
475300	476900	It's like my Facebook status.
476900	479300	It's complicated with Young Adult Paranormal Romance.
479300	480300	And Transformers.
480300	481300	And also Transformers.
481300	482300	It's polyamorous.
482300	483300	Mermaid Transformers.
483300	484300	Mermaid Transformers.
484300	485300	What the fuck?
485300	494860	You know what's real sad is like I went for like my whole life not knowing about that
494860	499860	and if I did know about it, my brain went, nope, nope, and just blocked it.
499860	502860	No, I did that when Bumblebee peed on a guy.
503060	506060	My brain went, nope, and I just forgot about it.
506060	510060	It was like the truck nuts in the second movie.
510060	515060	See, this is what happens when I start talking about Transformers.
515060	516060	Now we're Transformers.
516060	518060	Back to YA Paranormal Romance.
518060	521780	We as a culture have become so obsessed with it because it's become so popular, but at
521780	527300	the same time, it's not like there's nothing redeemable about that sort of first love and
527300	530460	adding this magical element into it.
530980	535580	We really did get caught up in the story, like especially the secondary characters.
535580	539900	To me, I think that is sort of the worst thing about this book as a reading experience is
539900	541460	that the main character is so awful.
541460	544460	They made her really awful.
544460	549740	And I'm having the same problem with American Gods, which I'm just now getting around to
549740	553380	reading and I'll read like 50 pages like, I hate you, Shadow.
553380	556940	I'm going to read another book and I'll like blow through another book, go back to American
556940	557940	Gods.
557940	558940	Fuck this.
558940	559940	Another book.
559940	560940	Blow through that one.
560940	561940	Fuck.
561940	562940	I'm not a book.
562940	563940	Some American Gods.
563940	568220	So if that is parody, it's something that plays up the tropes, either lovingly or not,
568220	572220	Board of the Rings.
572220	573220	What is satire?
573220	579980	When I think satire, I always think back to Jonathan Swift and it's a clashing example.
579980	583580	Yeah, that's what they teach in high school English because it's so obvious and it's so
583580	584580	over the top.
584580	587260	And yet people really did legitimately think he was serious.
587260	588260	Yeah.
588260	595860	So I feel like it kind of in ways is both depending on which attitude you take.
595860	600860	That said, I don't feel like this book is really trying to make a comment on society,
600860	604660	nor is the project at this point because it's so obviously a parody.
604660	613060	To me anyway, because we created Sarah, I think we are making some sort of loving jive
613060	616140	at our modern ages and the internet ages.
616140	618620	I feel no loving anything towards these authors.
618620	619620	Okay.
619620	624300	If you are an author that gets in goodreads fights with your detractors, you suck.
624300	627380	Like straight up, stop it.
627380	628940	Like what the fuck are you doing?
628940	631660	You're hurting America.
631660	634240	Writing fiction is such a personal thing.
634240	638380	And so whenever people go after little tiny books about how fucking awful they are, then
638380	641940	I feel kind of like, guys, come on, you know?
641940	647340	But then there are the Fifty Shades of Grey's where it's like, hey, you just romanticized
647340	648340	like abuse.
648340	656220	And to have an author then go, lol, nope, my fantasy, lol, fly off to the sun.
656220	658340	I mean, that's what drives me crazy.
658340	663460	That's what's so fascinating about these types is this sort of just like, no, whenever they
663460	668540	hear criticism and that they need to correct people, people like EL James and Colleen Houck
668540	673380	and that there's just so such insecurity and such a thin skin that they just need to
673380	678820	know and like react against these people who aren't getting it.
678820	687020	People who interact with their fan base or with humanity in general as a creator of art,
687020	690420	who act that way, like it bothers me.
690420	693420	Well, here's the other thing.
693420	695180	Writing fiction is hard.
695180	697720	You put something of yourself into it.
697720	703080	Something that you yourself probably may not even consciously perceive, you know, like
703080	706040	my kinky shit or my daddy issues or whatever.
706040	711480	But the thing is, world, when you put anything out into a public sphere, you are opening
711480	713480	it to criticism.
713480	718520	And you are not exempt from it just because it's your fantasy or someone doesn't get it.
718520	725480	Or especially if they're trying to call you out on being like a romanticizing abuse, EL
725480	726480	James.
726480	731680	I think the thing that has most been revealed to me in this whole thing, having our baby
731680	739280	now released to the world at large, is how quickly and almost foolishly people get passionate
739280	740280	about things.
740280	741280	And that's not a terrible thing, though.
741280	745400	Well, I mean, it is kind of funny that, you know, it's like we created Sarah as a parody
745400	747480	of drama and then actual drama happened.
747480	750480	It was like, no, we didn't want that.
750480	751480	What have we done?
751480	753480	Oh, God, we've created a monster.
753480	756280	Edward Snowden has to do the right thing, man.
756280	757280	Gotta blow that whistle.
757280	758280	People may not like the truth.
758280	759280	Because it's a scam.
759280	760280	Because it's a scam.
760280	767280	But the thing is, for the most part, we've been having so much fun with what people are
767280	768280	doing.
768280	771280	There's Awoken fanfic now, which is the greatest.
771280	772280	Oh, my God, yes.
772280	774280	People live blogging the book has been hilarious.
774280	777280	Oh, you have made my workday so much more pleasurable.
777280	778280	Thank you.
778280	784280	Special shout out to Theole, whose live blog has been hilarious.
785280	787280	And we've like read out loud at parties.
787280	788280	So in the meantime, keep leaving reviews.
788280	792280	Of course, if you still want it on Kindle or paperback, you can do it down there.
792280	793280	Yeah.
793280	796280	And of course, we have great fun with all of them.
796280	798280	Be honest as you like.
798280	799280	We hope you find it funny.
799280	800280	We want it to be funny.
800280	801280	Yeah.
801280	806280	But by all means, be honest if you feel like it's a, someone once put it as a really good
806280	809280	second draft, which I'm fine with.
809280	810280	Oh, my God.
810280	816280	It's actually almost like, that's a go team.
816280	822280	Considering we're consolidating the writing of eight authors, like, hey, I'll take it.
822280	828280	After the, you know, we keep tracking this and see where it goes.
828280	830280	Sequel.
840280	842280	Yeah.
