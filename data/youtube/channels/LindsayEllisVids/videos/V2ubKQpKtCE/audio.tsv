0	27200	So the scene that he's going to be doing is from later on in the book.
27200	28240	It's towards the end.
28240	29600	Right before the climax.
29600	32880	If you know typical 3X structure, this is the end of Act II.
32880	36240	This is the protagonist's lowest, most heartbreaking point.
36240	43280	This scene is a parody of New Moon, where Edward dumps Bella for her own protection.
44080	47040	An excerpt from Awoken by Sarah Ellington.
48160	48880	Chapter 19.
49760	50260	Crushed.
51520	53760	My time with you has been pleasant, he said.
53760	54880	His voice was strained.
55920	56880	But I must depart.
58880	59760	I looked at him again.
60960	62080	When will I see you again?
63040	64000	His face grew hard.
65520	66480	I cannot say.
68960	71360	You cannot say? I demanded.
71360	72560	After all we've been through?
73360	74320	After Phantom?
80640	81840	Riley took a deep breath.
82720	85760	And his cool green eyes found my mud gray ones.
88240	88740	I...
92800	95280	You've opened my eyes so much, I said.
96080	99200	There is so much more of the universe that I understand now.
99200	99700	Because...
102080	102880	Because of you.
103840	104800	He stayed silent.
105440	106560	I started to get irritated.
107680	109280	Tell me what's going on!
109280	110320	I demanded.
110320	112560	If there's something wrong with me,
112560	114640	or if there's some other woman in the picture,
114640	115840	I have a right to know!
115840	119600	I am merely stating facts, little tiny ones.
124640	126160	But you said-
126160	127920	I said a great many things, puny one.
129120	131680	Sorry, Riley Bello is the next line.
131680	134000	I said a great many things, puny one.
138560	140240	Do I still even have a heart?
141040	144160	It felt broken, obliterated, evaporated,
144720	148640	gone with the sanity of so many minds destroyed by the great Cthulhu.
149760	152960	And yet the thought of his callous disregard for the human mind,
153520	156000	his power, only comforted me.
158240	159200	Jesus Christ, Peter.
164240	165200	Sorry, sorry.
165200	166800	I'm editorializing, I shouldn't be.
171920	172640	No!
172640	174080	No, I still wanted him.
174640	177680	I still loved him, and I didn't believe him.
177680	178880	I don't believe you!
181920	182720	I cry.
183280	185200	Why resist a call then?
185200	188480	Was this what it was to be driven mad by great Cthulhu?
189440	190000	Riley-
191760	193520	Please, you don't mean this.
193520	194020	I-
195040	195680	I love you.
196880	200240	You cannot comprehend me, paltry diminutive one.
200240	201360	Diminutive.
201360	202240	Diminutive one.
202640	203200	Thank you, girl.
204000	206240	Therefore, you cannot love me,
206240	208560	and that is why I cannot go out with you.
217040	219920	It has been weeks to you, diminutive being,
219920	223120	or less than seconds to me, Riley said quietly.
223680	228000	To me, the time was nothing, as you are nothing.
228800	229300	But-
230160	231920	But what about the pumpkin ball?
235040	235920	He turned from me.
236640	239040	I thought for a moment I saw a tear slide down his cheek.
240320	240820	I-
242160	244760	I cannot take you to the pumpkin ball.
258880	262240	I cannot be your boyfriend, it's an infinite moral.
264320	266880	Then go ahead and do it now, I wept.
266880	268480	Go ahead and kill me.
268480	269280	Destroy the world.
269280	271760	My life is nothing without you, do you hear me?
271760	274320	It began with you, and it will end with you.
276320	280320	You have fulfilled your purpose, my Lapushian child, he said.
283520	287600	Fulfilled the prophecy, thereby postponing as a thought's awakening.
288240	289600	Now is not the time.
290320	291440	I cannot do it now.
292320	294320	I grab his brave booboo t-shirt.
301120	302400	Then devour me!
304560	306800	I can't live now, not without you.
307680	310640	You can't possibly just leave now, leave me in this pain.
310640	314960	Devour me so my life will at least serve some purpose to you.
315840	316640	Pain?!
316640	319360	He snapped, jerking away from me, picking me full.
319360	322640	Speak not to me of pain, incontestable mortal.
322640	326960	You are no too trifling to understand the immensity of all the word can apply.
326960	329600	You know nothing of pain, do you understand?
330400	330900	Nothing!
332000	333360	That's not true!
333360	335680	I yelled, sprawled out on the driveway.
338080	341840	The agony burrowing through my veins, preventing me from even getting to my knees.
342640	347440	If you have a shred of mercy and you drive me mad like you have done so many others,
347440	350560	consume my sanity or just go ahead and devour me whole.
351280	354480	Whatever it is you do, but don't leave me.
355760	357360	I must itty bitty one.
363280	364800	I can see the thesaurus entry.
366800	368080	This is true!
368080	378560	Earlier today we have reached number seven on Amazon Kindle young adult paranormal sales.
382240	386720	But in paperback we reached 18 in young adult sci-fi.
386720	389440	How did you stay sane while learning this book?
389440	390480	It was a lot of fun.
392080	395360	We would all get together in a google doc in the chat room with a google doc
395360	397120	and just like bounce ideas off each other.
398640	401280	Someone would be like, all the chapters should start with the letter C.
401280	402160	Like that's brilliant!
405600	411040	So considering that you kind of took the food just to shit over with the
412480	413920	have you gotten any of that?
416880	420880	Just today people like you know there's like there's a Lovecraft reddit
421440	425440	and uh and also on Fark like
425440	427360	Yeah on Fark they were very upset
428160	429840	and then like they raped the midnose.
429840	432560	No Sarah Ellenson raped the midnose.
432560	438240	Well someone on Fark figured it out like okay this is she's a mom with five kids
438240	444480	and she's writing about Cthulhu and uh like her twitter footprint only goes back to May.
444480	445840	Clearly this is a troll.
445840	446720	Yeah this is fake.
448960	451040	Since Twilight is Mormon abstinence porn
451040	453600	are you going to fetishize anything like they did abstinence?
453600	456560	Well Sarah is a reform and a protestant.
456560	458400	We made up a fake religion for Sarah.
461120	464880	And it's funny like on her tv tropes page people have been like arguing about it.
466160	469440	All the hidden reform and a protestant messages that are in this book.
471680	474960	Not to like be mean or anything but were you ever too concerned like
474960	478400	oh no this is starting to sound too good there's too much ever being important to this.
478960	480240	Yeah we definitely got to that.
480240	482080	I think we're still at that point.
482080	486000	No I was reading someone's someone was live tweeting their responses to reading the book
486000	489360	today and I was following her I was like what's she saying about our book and she's like
489360	492960	I'm actually surprised like how well thought out and how cohesive this is.
492960	494560	It's so much better than half of YA I've read.
494560	494880	I know.
494880	495520	Damn it.
495520	501520	Yeah someone else's comment was like the worst thing I can say about this is that it feels like
501520	507040	a pretty good second draft but it's like it's there's so much thought and effort obviously
507040	509680	in this and it's actually very solid and cohesive.
510400	512240	I don't know how I feel about this.
512640	513680	YA has gotten though.
516800	519600	Are there any YA's you guys would suggest that you read?
519600	520960	Like recent YA's?
520960	523120	I'm reading the book thief right now it is amazing.
523120	524800	It's not sci-fi we're normal though.
524800	526960	Yeah The Fault in Our Stars I whipped.
528960	530400	Anything by John Green.
530400	531280	Yeah definitely.
531280	534240	Um I'm trying to think of something that stars as a girl and was written by one.
536000	538400	Like something written by real man Ash.
538400	543120	I recently read one called Daughter of Smoke and Bone by Lady Taylor.
543120	547200	It wasn't amazing but it was pretty entertaining and not horribly offensive.
547200	549040	It was a little original.
549040	550160	Yeah and written by a woman.
550160	552480	I think I liked the fifth wave I liked.
552480	554800	Okay I like the fifth I actually like the fifth wave a lot.
554800	556240	And written by a man.
556240	560160	Yeah it was written by a dude but it was it was very I mean it was like popcorn YA but it was
560160	562080	very fast I killed that one in a day.
563280	563920	I like it.
563920	565440	It's what Divergent should have been.
565440	566080	Yeah.
566080	569600	What do you think is or will be the most rewarding part of this entire experience?
570160	572240	Um I think writing it.
572240	577360	Yeah like we we just said so much like I'm although I'm really enjoying like the the reviews
577360	581360	and because we can't tell who's in on the joke.
581360	585120	Like making joke reviews there's you know flames and we're like are they actually flaming it
585120	588400	because it's silly and weird or are they flaming it because they're in on the joke and they
588400	589200	want to be controlled.
589200	594960	That's why the the park thing like was just so like delicious because they really did
594960	598240	until the guy gave it away like they really thought it.
598240	602080	A glorious hour this morning between 9 a.m and 11 a.m.
602080	602560	Two hours.
602560	614960	It was so funny it was so funny.
