00:00.000 --> 00:27.200
So the scene that he's going to be doing is from later on in the book.

00:27.200 --> 00:28.240
It's towards the end.

00:28.240 --> 00:29.600
Right before the climax.

00:29.600 --> 00:32.880
If you know typical 3X structure, this is the end of Act II.

00:32.880 --> 00:36.240
This is the protagonist's lowest, most heartbreaking point.

00:36.240 --> 00:43.280
This scene is a parody of New Moon, where Edward dumps Bella for her own protection.

00:44.080 --> 00:47.040
An excerpt from Awoken by Sarah Ellington.

00:48.160 --> 00:48.880
Chapter 19.

00:49.760 --> 00:50.260
Crushed.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.760
My time with you has been pleasant, he said.

00:53.760 --> 00:54.880
His voice was strained.

00:55.920 --> 00:56.880
But I must depart.

00:58.880 --> 00:59.760
I looked at him again.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.080
When will I see you again?

01:03.040 --> 01:04.000
His face grew hard.

01:05.520 --> 01:06.480
I cannot say.

01:08.960 --> 01:11.360
You cannot say? I demanded.

01:11.360 --> 01:12.560
After all we've been through?

01:13.360 --> 01:14.320
After Phantom?

01:20.640 --> 01:21.840
Riley took a deep breath.

01:22.720 --> 01:25.760
And his cool green eyes found my mud gray ones.

01:28.240 --> 01:28.740
I...

01:32.800 --> 01:35.280
You've opened my eyes so much, I said.

01:36.080 --> 01:39.200
There is so much more of the universe that I understand now.

01:39.200 --> 01:39.700
Because...

01:42.080 --> 01:42.880
Because of you.

01:43.840 --> 01:44.800
He stayed silent.

01:45.440 --> 01:46.560
I started to get irritated.

01:47.680 --> 01:49.280
Tell me what's going on!

01:49.280 --> 01:50.320
I demanded.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.560
If there's something wrong with me,

01:52.560 --> 01:54.640
or if there's some other woman in the picture,

01:54.640 --> 01:55.840
I have a right to know!

01:55.840 --> 01:59.600
I am merely stating facts, little tiny ones.

02:04.640 --> 02:06.160
But you said-

02:06.160 --> 02:07.920
I said a great many things, puny one.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.680
Sorry, Riley Bello is the next line.

02:11.680 --> 02:14.000
I said a great many things, puny one.

02:18.560 --> 02:20.240
Do I still even have a heart?

02:21.040 --> 02:24.160
It felt broken, obliterated, evaporated,

02:24.720 --> 02:28.640
gone with the sanity of so many minds destroyed by the great Cthulhu.

02:29.760 --> 02:32.960
And yet the thought of his callous disregard for the human mind,

02:33.520 --> 02:36.000
his power, only comforted me.

02:38.240 --> 02:39.200
Jesus Christ, Peter.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.200
Sorry, sorry.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.800
I'm editorializing, I shouldn't be.

02:51.920 --> 02:52.640
No!

02:52.640 --> 02:54.080
No, I still wanted him.

02:54.640 --> 02:57.680
I still loved him, and I didn't believe him.

02:57.680 --> 02:58.880
I don't believe you!

03:01.920 --> 03:02.720
I cry.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.200
Why resist a call then?

03:05.200 --> 03:08.480
Was this what it was to be driven mad by great Cthulhu?

03:09.440 --> 03:10.000
Riley-

03:11.760 --> 03:13.520
Please, you don't mean this.

03:13.520 --> 03:14.020
I-

03:15.040 --> 03:15.680
I love you.

03:16.880 --> 03:20.240
You cannot comprehend me, paltry diminutive one.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.360
Diminutive.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.240
Diminutive one.

03:22.640 --> 03:23.200
Thank you, girl.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.240
Therefore, you cannot love me,

03:26.240 --> 03:28.560
and that is why I cannot go out with you.

03:37.040 --> 03:39.920
It has been weeks to you, diminutive being,

03:39.920 --> 03:43.120
or less than seconds to me, Riley said quietly.

03:43.680 --> 03:48.000
To me, the time was nothing, as you are nothing.

03:48.800 --> 03:49.300
But-

03:50.160 --> 03:51.920
But what about the pumpkin ball?

03:55.040 --> 03:55.920
He turned from me.

03:56.640 --> 03:59.040
I thought for a moment I saw a tear slide down his cheek.

04:00.320 --> 04:00.820
I-

04:02.160 --> 04:04.760
I cannot take you to the pumpkin ball.

04:18.880 --> 04:22.240
I cannot be your boyfriend, it's an infinite moral.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.880
Then go ahead and do it now, I wept.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.480
Go ahead and kill me.

04:28.480 --> 04:29.280
Destroy the world.

04:29.280 --> 04:31.760
My life is nothing without you, do you hear me?

04:31.760 --> 04:34.320
It began with you, and it will end with you.

04:36.320 --> 04:40.320
You have fulfilled your purpose, my Lapushian child, he said.

04:43.520 --> 04:47.600
Fulfilled the prophecy, thereby postponing as a thought's awakening.

04:48.240 --> 04:49.600
Now is not the time.

04:50.320 --> 04:51.440
I cannot do it now.

04:52.320 --> 04:54.320
I grab his brave booboo t-shirt.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.400
Then devour me!

05:04.560 --> 05:06.800
I can't live now, not without you.

05:07.680 --> 05:10.640
You can't possibly just leave now, leave me in this pain.

05:10.640 --> 05:14.960
Devour me so my life will at least serve some purpose to you.

05:15.840 --> 05:16.640
Pain?!

05:16.640 --> 05:19.360
He snapped, jerking away from me, picking me full.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.640
Speak not to me of pain, incontestable mortal.

05:22.640 --> 05:26.960
You are no too trifling to understand the immensity of all the word can apply.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.600
You know nothing of pain, do you understand?

05:30.400 --> 05:30.900
Nothing!

05:32.000 --> 05:33.360
That's not true!

05:33.360 --> 05:35.680
I yelled, sprawled out on the driveway.

05:38.080 --> 05:41.840
The agony burrowing through my veins, preventing me from even getting to my knees.

05:42.640 --> 05:47.440
If you have a shred of mercy and you drive me mad like you have done so many others,

05:47.440 --> 05:50.560
consume my sanity or just go ahead and devour me whole.

05:51.280 --> 05:54.480
Whatever it is you do, but don't leave me.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.360
I must itty bitty one.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.800
I can see the thesaurus entry.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.080
This is true!

06:08.080 --> 06:18.560
Earlier today we have reached number seven on Amazon Kindle young adult paranormal sales.

06:22.240 --> 06:26.720
But in paperback we reached 18 in young adult sci-fi.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.440
How did you stay sane while learning this book?

06:29.440 --> 06:30.480
It was a lot of fun.

06:32.080 --> 06:35.360
We would all get together in a google doc in the chat room with a google doc

06:35.360 --> 06:37.120
and just like bounce ideas off each other.

06:38.640 --> 06:41.280
Someone would be like, all the chapters should start with the letter C.

06:41.280 --> 06:42.160
Like that's brilliant!

06:45.600 --> 06:51.040
So considering that you kind of took the food just to shit over with the

06:52.480 --> 06:53.920
have you gotten any of that?

06:56.880 --> 07:00.880
Just today people like you know there's like there's a Lovecraft reddit

07:01.440 --> 07:05.440
and uh and also on Fark like

07:05.440 --> 07:07.360
Yeah on Fark they were very upset

07:08.160 --> 07:09.840
and then like they raped the midnose.

07:09.840 --> 07:12.560
No Sarah Ellenson raped the midnose.

07:12.560 --> 07:18.240
Well someone on Fark figured it out like okay this is she's a mom with five kids

07:18.240 --> 07:24.480
and she's writing about Cthulhu and uh like her twitter footprint only goes back to May.

07:24.480 --> 07:25.840
Clearly this is a troll.

07:25.840 --> 07:26.720
Yeah this is fake.

07:28.960 --> 07:31.040
Since Twilight is Mormon abstinence porn

07:31.040 --> 07:33.600
are you going to fetishize anything like they did abstinence?

07:33.600 --> 07:36.560
Well Sarah is a reform and a protestant.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.400
We made up a fake religion for Sarah.

07:41.120 --> 07:44.880
And it's funny like on her tv tropes page people have been like arguing about it.

07:46.160 --> 07:49.440
All the hidden reform and a protestant messages that are in this book.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.960
Not to like be mean or anything but were you ever too concerned like

07:54.960 --> 07:58.400
oh no this is starting to sound too good there's too much ever being important to this.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.240
Yeah we definitely got to that.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.080
I think we're still at that point.

08:02.080 --> 08:06.000
No I was reading someone's someone was live tweeting their responses to reading the book

08:06.000 --> 08:09.360
today and I was following her I was like what's she saying about our book and she's like

08:09.360 --> 08:12.960
I'm actually surprised like how well thought out and how cohesive this is.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.560
It's so much better than half of YA I've read.

08:14.560 --> 08:14.880
I know.

08:14.880 --> 08:15.520
Damn it.

08:15.520 --> 08:21.520
Yeah someone else's comment was like the worst thing I can say about this is that it feels like

08:21.520 --> 08:27.040
a pretty good second draft but it's like it's there's so much thought and effort obviously

08:27.040 --> 08:29.680
in this and it's actually very solid and cohesive.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.240
I don't know how I feel about this.

08:32.640 --> 08:33.680
YA has gotten though.

08:36.800 --> 08:39.600
Are there any YA's you guys would suggest that you read?

08:39.600 --> 08:40.960
Like recent YA's?

08:40.960 --> 08:43.120
I'm reading the book thief right now it is amazing.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.800
It's not sci-fi we're normal though.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.960
Yeah The Fault in Our Stars I whipped.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.400
Anything by John Green.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.280
Yeah definitely.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.240
Um I'm trying to think of something that stars as a girl and was written by one.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.400
Like something written by real man Ash.

08:58.400 --> 09:03.120
I recently read one called Daughter of Smoke and Bone by Lady Taylor.

09:03.120 --> 09:07.200
It wasn't amazing but it was pretty entertaining and not horribly offensive.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.040
It was a little original.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.160
Yeah and written by a woman.

09:10.160 --> 09:12.480
I think I liked the fifth wave I liked.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.800
Okay I like the fifth I actually like the fifth wave a lot.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.240
And written by a man.

09:16.240 --> 09:20.160
Yeah it was written by a dude but it was it was very I mean it was like popcorn YA but it was

09:20.160 --> 09:22.080
very fast I killed that one in a day.

09:23.280 --> 09:23.920
I like it.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.440
It's what Divergent should have been.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.080
Yeah.

09:26.080 --> 09:29.600
What do you think is or will be the most rewarding part of this entire experience?

09:30.160 --> 09:32.240
Um I think writing it.

09:32.240 --> 09:37.360
Yeah like we we just said so much like I'm although I'm really enjoying like the the reviews

09:37.360 --> 09:41.360
and because we can't tell who's in on the joke.

09:41.360 --> 09:45.120
Like making joke reviews there's you know flames and we're like are they actually flaming it

09:45.120 --> 09:48.400
because it's silly and weird or are they flaming it because they're in on the joke and they

09:48.400 --> 09:49.200
want to be controlled.

09:49.200 --> 09:54.960
That's why the the park thing like was just so like delicious because they really did

09:54.960 --> 09:58.240
until the guy gave it away like they really thought it.

09:58.240 --> 10:02.080
A glorious hour this morning between 9 a.m and 11 a.m.

10:02.080 --> 10:02.560
Two hours.

10:02.560 --> 10:14.960
It was so funny it was so funny.
