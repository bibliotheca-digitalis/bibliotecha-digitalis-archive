1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,200
So the scene that he's going to be doing is from later on in the book.

2
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,240
It's towards the end.

3
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,600
Right before the climax.

4
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,880
If you know typical 3X structure, this is the end of Act II.

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,240
This is the protagonist's lowest, most heartbreaking point.

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:43,280
This scene is a parody of New Moon, where Edward dumps Bella for her own protection.

7
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,040
An excerpt from Awoken by Sarah Ellington.

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,880
Chapter 19.

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,260
Crushed.

10
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,760
My time with you has been pleasant, he said.

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,880
His voice was strained.

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,880
But I must depart.

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,760
I looked at him again.

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,080
When will I see you again?

15
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,000
His face grew hard.

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,480
I cannot say.

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,360
You cannot say? I demanded.

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,560
After all we've been through?

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,320
After Phantom?

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,840
Riley took a deep breath.

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,760
And his cool green eyes found my mud gray ones.

22
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,740
I...

23
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,280
You've opened my eyes so much, I said.

24
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,200
There is so much more of the universe that I understand now.

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,700
Because...

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,880
Because of you.

27
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,800
He stayed silent.

28
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,560
I started to get irritated.

29
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,280
Tell me what's going on!

30
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,320
I demanded.

31
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,560
If there's something wrong with me,

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,640
or if there's some other woman in the picture,

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,840
I have a right to know!

34
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,600
I am merely stating facts, little tiny ones.

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,160
But you said-

36
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,920
I said a great many things, puny one.

37
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,680
Sorry, Riley Bello is the next line.

38
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,000
I said a great many things, puny one.

39
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,240
Do I still even have a heart?

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,160
It felt broken, obliterated, evaporated,

41
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,640
gone with the sanity of so many minds destroyed by the great Cthulhu.

42
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,960
And yet the thought of his callous disregard for the human mind,

43
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,000
his power, only comforted me.

44
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,200
Jesus Christ, Peter.

45
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,200
Sorry, sorry.

46
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,800
I'm editorializing, I shouldn't be.

47
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,640
No!

48
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,080
No, I still wanted him.

49
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,680
I still loved him, and I didn't believe him.

50
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,880
I don't believe you!

51
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,720
I cry.

52
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,200
Why resist a call then?

53
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,480
Was this what it was to be driven mad by great Cthulhu?

54
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,000
Riley-

55
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,520
Please, you don't mean this.

56
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,020
I-

57
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,680
I love you.

58
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,240
You cannot comprehend me, paltry diminutive one.

59
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,360
Diminutive.

60
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,240
Diminutive one.

61
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,200
Thank you, girl.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,240
Therefore, you cannot love me,

63
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,560
and that is why I cannot go out with you.

64
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,920
It has been weeks to you, diminutive being,

65
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,120
or less than seconds to me, Riley said quietly.

66
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,000
To me, the time was nothing, as you are nothing.

67
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,300
But-

68
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,920
But what about the pumpkin ball?

69
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,920
He turned from me.

70
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,040
I thought for a moment I saw a tear slide down his cheek.

71
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,820
I-

72
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,760
I cannot take you to the pumpkin ball.

73
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,240
I cannot be your boyfriend, it's an infinite moral.

74
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,880
Then go ahead and do it now, I wept.

75
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,480
Go ahead and kill me.

76
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,280
Destroy the world.

77
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,760
My life is nothing without you, do you hear me?

78
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,320
It began with you, and it will end with you.

79
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,320
You have fulfilled your purpose, my Lapushian child, he said.

80
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,600
Fulfilled the prophecy, thereby postponing as a thought's awakening.

81
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,600
Now is not the time.

82
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,440
I cannot do it now.

83
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,320
I grab his brave booboo t-shirt.

84
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,400
Then devour me!

85
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,800
I can't live now, not without you.

86
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,640
You can't possibly just leave now, leave me in this pain.

87
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,960
Devour me so my life will at least serve some purpose to you.

88
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,640
Pain?!

89
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,360
He snapped, jerking away from me, picking me full.

90
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,640
Speak not to me of pain, incontestable mortal.

91
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,960
You are no too trifling to understand the immensity of all the word can apply.

92
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,600
You know nothing of pain, do you understand?

93
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:30,900
Nothing!

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,360
That's not true!

95
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,680
I yelled, sprawled out on the driveway.

96
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,840
The agony burrowing through my veins, preventing me from even getting to my knees.

97
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,440
If you have a shred of mercy and you drive me mad like you have done so many others,

98
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,560
consume my sanity or just go ahead and devour me whole.

99
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,480
Whatever it is you do, but don't leave me.

100
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,360
I must itty bitty one.

101
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,800
I can see the thesaurus entry.

102
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,080
This is true!

103
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:18,560
Earlier today we have reached number seven on Amazon Kindle young adult paranormal sales.

104
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,720
But in paperback we reached 18 in young adult sci-fi.

105
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,440
How did you stay sane while learning this book?

106
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,480
It was a lot of fun.

107
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,360
We would all get together in a google doc in the chat room with a google doc

108
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,120
and just like bounce ideas off each other.

109
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,280
Someone would be like, all the chapters should start with the letter C.

110
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,160
Like that's brilliant!

111
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,040
So considering that you kind of took the food just to shit over with the

112
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,920
have you gotten any of that?

113
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,880
Just today people like you know there's like there's a Lovecraft reddit

114
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,440
and uh and also on Fark like

115
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,360
Yeah on Fark they were very upset

116
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,840
and then like they raped the midnose.

117
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,560
No Sarah Ellenson raped the midnose.

118
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,240
Well someone on Fark figured it out like okay this is she's a mom with five kids

119
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,480
and she's writing about Cthulhu and uh like her twitter footprint only goes back to May.

120
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,840
Clearly this is a troll.

121
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,720
Yeah this is fake.

122
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,040
Since Twilight is Mormon abstinence porn

123
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,600
are you going to fetishize anything like they did abstinence?

124
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,560
Well Sarah is a reform and a protestant.

125
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,400
We made up a fake religion for Sarah.

126
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,880
And it's funny like on her tv tropes page people have been like arguing about it.

127
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,440
All the hidden reform and a protestant messages that are in this book.

128
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,960
Not to like be mean or anything but were you ever too concerned like

129
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,400
oh no this is starting to sound too good there's too much ever being important to this.

130
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,240
Yeah we definitely got to that.

131
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,080
I think we're still at that point.

132
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,000
No I was reading someone's someone was live tweeting their responses to reading the book

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,360
today and I was following her I was like what's she saying about our book and she's like

134
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,960
I'm actually surprised like how well thought out and how cohesive this is.

135
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,560
It's so much better than half of YA I've read.

136
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:14,880
I know.

137
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,520
Damn it.

138
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,520
Yeah someone else's comment was like the worst thing I can say about this is that it feels like

139
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,040
a pretty good second draft but it's like it's there's so much thought and effort obviously

140
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,680
in this and it's actually very solid and cohesive.

141
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,240
I don't know how I feel about this.

142
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,680
YA has gotten though.

143
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,600
Are there any YA's you guys would suggest that you read?

144
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,960
Like recent YA's?

145
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,120
I'm reading the book thief right now it is amazing.

146
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,800
It's not sci-fi we're normal though.

147
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,960
Yeah The Fault in Our Stars I whipped.

148
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,400
Anything by John Green.

149
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,280
Yeah definitely.

150
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,240
Um I'm trying to think of something that stars as a girl and was written by one.

151
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,400
Like something written by real man Ash.

152
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,120
I recently read one called Daughter of Smoke and Bone by Lady Taylor.

153
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,200
It wasn't amazing but it was pretty entertaining and not horribly offensive.

154
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,040
It was a little original.

155
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,160
Yeah and written by a woman.

156
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,480
I think I liked the fifth wave I liked.

157
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,800
Okay I like the fifth I actually like the fifth wave a lot.

158
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,240
And written by a man.

159
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,160
Yeah it was written by a dude but it was it was very I mean it was like popcorn YA but it was

160
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,080
very fast I killed that one in a day.

161
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,920
I like it.

162
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,440
It's what Divergent should have been.

163
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,080
Yeah.

164
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,600
What do you think is or will be the most rewarding part of this entire experience?

165
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,240
Um I think writing it.

166
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,360
Yeah like we we just said so much like I'm although I'm really enjoying like the the reviews

167
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,360
and because we can't tell who's in on the joke.

168
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,120
Like making joke reviews there's you know flames and we're like are they actually flaming it

169
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,400
because it's silly and weird or are they flaming it because they're in on the joke and they

170
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,200
want to be controlled.

171
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,960
That's why the the park thing like was just so like delicious because they really did

172
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,240
until the guy gave it away like they really thought it.

173
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,080
A glorious hour this morning between 9 a.m and 11 a.m.

174
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,560
Two hours.

175
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:14,960
It was so funny it was so funny.
