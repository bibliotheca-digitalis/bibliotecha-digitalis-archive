1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,640
So, we're at the last Barnes & Noble in Queens, the last one, and thank God because where

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,040
else are we going to go and take a look at what our competition is like?

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,240
Yeah, so this week we're going to do a little field trip where we check out our presumptions

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,040
on what young adult is now.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,920
Because what's the point of going off and claiming all sorts of mad things about the

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,920
nature of young adult paranormal romance novels without actually investigating further?

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,200
Yes, without actually physically going and seeing what it's all about.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,680
So, let's go laugh at the successful people.

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:52,920
This is funny to me.

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:00,280
I remember the first day I saw this and now it's just like, yeah, teen paranormal romance.

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,800
Here of course is Twilight with aliens.

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,360
Well Spring Chronicles unleashed werewolves.

13
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,760
There's a tiger one?

14
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,120
The last thing Kasey Hayes thought she'd be doing this summer was trying to break a 300

15
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,400
year old Indian curse with a mysterious white tiger named Wren.

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,960
I'm just going to assume that's a sexy ass tiger.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,800
So she was battling immortal sea monkeys and trekking the jungles of India.

18
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,160
She fell in love with Wren, the 300 year old prince who's a tiger.

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,160
So we're tiger.

20
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,160
We're tiger.

21
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,000
But of course it uses the tiger by William Blake.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,760
Tiger tiger burning bright in the forests of the night.

23
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,800
So five mythical Chinese dragons in the open sea beckon 19 year old Kelsey who must embark

24
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
on a third voyage.

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,800
It's time to find the goddess Durga's black pearl necklace and free her beloved Wren.

26
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,600
So this is a white chick doing a bunch of shit in India with Hindu stuff.

27
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Sounds like.

28
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,800
Okay so here we have some books by Amanda Hawking who was the lady that got super famous

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,880
by self-publishing and making millions and millions of dollars.

30
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,680
First beastly teepee.

31
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,560
A beast not quite wolf or gorilla or dog but a horrible new creature with fangs, claws

32
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,160
and hair springing from every pore.

33
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,920
Yes the spell the one the witch in my English class cast on me.

34
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,120
I see Taylor Swift has gotten a young adult novel.

35
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,400
I see our buddy's getting in the young adult game.

36
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,640
This is new in the new teen, new teen, this is brand new.

37
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,160
So I'm really, I'm really digging these incredibly vague titles.

38
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,160
Rise.

39
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,160
An Eve novel.

40
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
Entice.

41
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,160
Vague noncommittal name.

42
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
Vague noncommittal name.

43
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,280
Another and another and another.

44
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,280
But they are adjectives.

45
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
They are adjectives.

46
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,280
Death, doom, and detention.

47
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,280
Possession.

48
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,440
The name didn't tell me anything but her makeup is incredible.

49
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
Fragile darkness.

50
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,480
Or should I say beautiful insanity.

51
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,480
Faded.

52
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,480
Thirst.

53
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,480
So basically if you want to title your novel just find a verb and put it in its past participle.

54
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,480
Rift.

55
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,480
Rise.

56
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,480
Rise.

57
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,480
And crave.

58
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,000
That's the thing I look at these titles and I think about who I was when I was in middle

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,320
school and high school and none of these titles would ever have caught my attention.

60
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,320
Yeah.

61
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,320
Possession.

62
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,320
Captivate.

63
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,320
Entice.

64
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,320
Endure.

65
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,320
Firelight.

66
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Vanish.

67
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
Hidden.

68
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
See I just kind of feel like this one's taken.

69
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,240
Now we're in just normal romance because all this stems from here really.

70
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,280
And for an example we have, for the first time in print, a complete novel because you

71
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,760
are mine.

72
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,760
Is that another rich guy thing?

73
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,080
It's another rich guy thing.

74
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,080
Sexy.

75
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,080
Confident.

76
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,080
Commanding.

77
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,000
Anything he wanted he got and what he wanted was me.

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Damien Stark.

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,600
I just want to like, let's focus on that.

80
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,080
Damien Stark.

81
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,280
I um, I see what you're doing.

82
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,280
Anything he wants.

83
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,680
Dominated by the billionaire.

84
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,920
I see what you did there.

85
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,960
I just want you to know.

86
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,560
I see what you did there.

87
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
Just kidding.

88
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,120
Okay, this has to be like for, this has to be for gay guys.

89
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
This cannot be for women.

90
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,440
There's no way that that is a straight man with that gun holster and no shirt.

91
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,160
Here we have the book Cinder or the Lunar Chronicles because these books are always

92
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,640
sagas or chronicles or epics or something of that nature.

93
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,480
And here we have humans and androids crowd the raucous streets of New Beijing.

94
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,480
It's a Cinderella story with androids.

95
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
Ghosts.

96
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,360
She shares her mirror every morning with a phantom teenage boy.

97
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,040
Oh, so Twilight with ghosts.

98
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,680
But the ghosts are gaining power.

99
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,720
This is like one of the partial sequins.

100
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,720
And the human race is all but extinct after a war of partials.

101
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,320
Engineered, organic beings identical to humans.

102
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,760
So the partials aren't humans?

103
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,760
Test tube babies aren't humans?

104
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,440
Yeah, so what I'm learning right now is that there's not a huge world of difference between

105
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,760
the adult section and the young adult section in terms of romance.

106
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,280
Except for the young adult has more like paranormal stuff.

107
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,280
And the adult has more like billionaire-ish and shit.

108
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,280
You know what?

109
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,280
I'm out.

110
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,280
I'm out.

111
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
I'm out.

112
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
I'm out.

113
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
I'm out.

114
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,280
I'm out.

115
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,280
