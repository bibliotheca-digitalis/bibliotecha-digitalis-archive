WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.640
So, we're at the last Barnes & Noble in Queens, the last one, and thank God because where

00:09.640 --> 00:13.040
else are we going to go and take a look at what our competition is like?

00:13.040 --> 00:19.240
Yeah, so this week we're going to do a little field trip where we check out our presumptions

00:19.240 --> 00:23.040
on what young adult is now.

00:23.040 --> 00:27.920
Because what's the point of going off and claiming all sorts of mad things about the

00:27.920 --> 00:32.920
nature of young adult paranormal romance novels without actually investigating further?

00:32.920 --> 00:37.200
Yes, without actually physically going and seeing what it's all about.

00:37.200 --> 00:40.680
So, let's go laugh at the successful people.

00:40.680 --> 00:52.920
This is funny to me.

00:52.920 --> 01:00.280
I remember the first day I saw this and now it's just like, yeah, teen paranormal romance.

01:00.280 --> 01:04.800
Here of course is Twilight with aliens.

01:04.800 --> 01:09.360
Well Spring Chronicles unleashed werewolves.

01:09.360 --> 01:10.760
There's a tiger one?

01:10.760 --> 01:14.120
The last thing Kasey Hayes thought she'd be doing this summer was trying to break a 300

01:14.120 --> 01:18.400
year old Indian curse with a mysterious white tiger named Wren.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.960
I'm just going to assume that's a sexy ass tiger.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.800
So she was battling immortal sea monkeys and trekking the jungles of India.

01:23.800 --> 01:27.160
She fell in love with Wren, the 300 year old prince who's a tiger.

01:27.160 --> 01:28.160
So we're tiger.

01:28.160 --> 01:29.160
We're tiger.

01:29.160 --> 01:32.000
But of course it uses the tiger by William Blake.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.760
Tiger tiger burning bright in the forests of the night.

01:35.760 --> 01:39.800
So five mythical Chinese dragons in the open sea beckon 19 year old Kelsey who must embark

01:39.800 --> 01:40.800
on a third voyage.

01:40.800 --> 01:44.800
It's time to find the goddess Durga's black pearl necklace and free her beloved Wren.

01:44.800 --> 01:49.600
So this is a white chick doing a bunch of shit in India with Hindu stuff.

01:49.600 --> 01:50.600
Sounds like.

01:51.240 --> 01:57.800
Okay so here we have some books by Amanda Hawking who was the lady that got super famous

01:57.800 --> 02:01.880
by self-publishing and making millions and millions of dollars.

02:01.880 --> 02:05.680
First beastly teepee.

02:05.680 --> 02:09.560
A beast not quite wolf or gorilla or dog but a horrible new creature with fangs, claws

02:09.560 --> 02:11.160
and hair springing from every pore.

02:14.160 --> 02:18.920
Yes the spell the one the witch in my English class cast on me.

02:19.240 --> 02:22.120
I see Taylor Swift has gotten a young adult novel.

02:22.120 --> 02:27.400
I see our buddy's getting in the young adult game.

02:27.400 --> 02:33.640
This is new in the new teen, new teen, this is brand new.

02:33.640 --> 02:37.160
So I'm really, I'm really digging these incredibly vague titles.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.160
Rise.

02:38.160 --> 02:39.160
An Eve novel.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.160
Entice.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.160
Vague noncommittal name.

02:41.160 --> 02:42.160
Vague noncommittal name.

02:42.160 --> 02:47.280
Another and another and another.

02:47.280 --> 02:48.280
But they are adjectives.

02:48.280 --> 02:49.280
They are adjectives.

02:49.280 --> 02:50.280
Death, doom, and detention.

02:50.280 --> 02:51.280
Possession.

02:51.280 --> 02:57.440
The name didn't tell me anything but her makeup is incredible.

02:57.440 --> 02:58.440
Fragile darkness.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.480
Or should I say beautiful insanity.

03:00.480 --> 03:01.480
Faded.

03:01.480 --> 03:02.480
Thirst.

03:02.480 --> 03:08.480
So basically if you want to title your novel just find a verb and put it in its past participle.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.480
Rift.

03:09.480 --> 03:10.480
Rise.

03:10.480 --> 03:11.480
Rise.

03:11.480 --> 03:12.480
And crave.

03:12.480 --> 03:17.000
That's the thing I look at these titles and I think about who I was when I was in middle

03:17.000 --> 03:21.320
school and high school and none of these titles would ever have caught my attention.

03:21.320 --> 03:22.320
Yeah.

03:22.320 --> 03:23.320
Possession.

03:23.320 --> 03:24.320
Captivate.

03:24.320 --> 03:25.320
Entice.

03:25.320 --> 03:26.320
Endure.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.320
Firelight.

03:27.320 --> 03:28.320
Vanish.

03:28.320 --> 03:29.320
Hidden.

03:29.320 --> 03:30.320
See I just kind of feel like this one's taken.

03:30.320 --> 03:36.240
Now we're in just normal romance because all this stems from here really.

03:36.240 --> 03:40.280
And for an example we have, for the first time in print, a complete novel because you

03:40.280 --> 03:43.760
are mine.

03:43.760 --> 03:44.760
Is that another rich guy thing?

03:44.760 --> 03:46.080
It's another rich guy thing.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.080
Sexy.

03:47.080 --> 03:48.080
Confident.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.080
Commanding.

03:49.080 --> 03:51.000
Anything he wanted he got and what he wanted was me.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Damien Stark.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.600
I just want to like, let's focus on that.

03:53.600 --> 03:57.080
Damien Stark.

03:57.080 --> 04:01.280
I um, I see what you're doing.

04:01.280 --> 04:02.280
Anything he wants.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.680
Dominated by the billionaire.

04:04.680 --> 04:05.920
I see what you did there.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.960
I just want you to know.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.560
I see what you did there.

04:09.560 --> 04:10.560
Just kidding.

04:10.560 --> 04:14.120
Okay, this has to be like for, this has to be for gay guys.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.120
This cannot be for women.

04:15.160 --> 04:19.440
There's no way that that is a straight man with that gun holster and no shirt.

04:19.440 --> 04:24.160
Here we have the book Cinder or the Lunar Chronicles because these books are always

04:24.160 --> 04:27.640
sagas or chronicles or epics or something of that nature.

04:27.640 --> 04:31.480
And here we have humans and androids crowd the raucous streets of New Beijing.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.480
It's a Cinderella story with androids.

04:34.480 --> 04:35.480
Ghosts.

04:35.480 --> 04:38.360
She shares her mirror every morning with a phantom teenage boy.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.040
Oh, so Twilight with ghosts.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.680
But the ghosts are gaining power.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.720
This is like one of the partial sequins.

04:43.720 --> 04:46.720
And the human race is all but extinct after a war of partials.

04:46.720 --> 04:50.320
Engineered, organic beings identical to humans.

04:50.320 --> 04:55.760
So the partials aren't humans?

04:55.760 --> 04:56.760
Test tube babies aren't humans?

04:56.760 --> 05:00.440
Yeah, so what I'm learning right now is that there's not a huge world of difference between

05:00.440 --> 05:03.760
the adult section and the young adult section in terms of romance.

05:03.760 --> 05:07.280
Except for the young adult has more like paranormal stuff.

05:07.280 --> 05:10.280
And the adult has more like billionaire-ish and shit.

05:12.280 --> 05:13.280
You know what?

05:13.280 --> 05:14.280
I'm out.

05:14.280 --> 05:15.280
I'm out.

05:15.280 --> 05:16.280
I'm out.

05:16.280 --> 05:17.280
I'm out.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.280
I'm out.

05:18.280 --> 05:19.280
I'm out.

05:19.280 --> 05:19.280
