0	9640	So, we're at the last Barnes & Noble in Queens, the last one, and thank God because where
9640	13040	else are we going to go and take a look at what our competition is like?
13040	19240	Yeah, so this week we're going to do a little field trip where we check out our presumptions
19240	23040	on what young adult is now.
23040	27920	Because what's the point of going off and claiming all sorts of mad things about the
27920	32920	nature of young adult paranormal romance novels without actually investigating further?
32920	37200	Yes, without actually physically going and seeing what it's all about.
37200	40680	So, let's go laugh at the successful people.
40680	52920	This is funny to me.
52920	60280	I remember the first day I saw this and now it's just like, yeah, teen paranormal romance.
60280	64800	Here of course is Twilight with aliens.
64800	69360	Well Spring Chronicles unleashed werewolves.
69360	70760	There's a tiger one?
70760	74120	The last thing Kasey Hayes thought she'd be doing this summer was trying to break a 300
74120	78400	year old Indian curse with a mysterious white tiger named Wren.
78400	80960	I'm just going to assume that's a sexy ass tiger.
81000	83800	So she was battling immortal sea monkeys and trekking the jungles of India.
83800	87160	She fell in love with Wren, the 300 year old prince who's a tiger.
87160	88160	So we're tiger.
88160	89160	We're tiger.
89160	92000	But of course it uses the tiger by William Blake.
92000	95760	Tiger tiger burning bright in the forests of the night.
95760	99800	So five mythical Chinese dragons in the open sea beckon 19 year old Kelsey who must embark
99800	100800	on a third voyage.
100800	104800	It's time to find the goddess Durga's black pearl necklace and free her beloved Wren.
104800	109600	So this is a white chick doing a bunch of shit in India with Hindu stuff.
109600	110600	Sounds like.
111240	117800	Okay so here we have some books by Amanda Hawking who was the lady that got super famous
117800	121880	by self-publishing and making millions and millions of dollars.
121880	125680	First beastly teepee.
125680	129560	A beast not quite wolf or gorilla or dog but a horrible new creature with fangs, claws
129560	131160	and hair springing from every pore.
134160	138920	Yes the spell the one the witch in my English class cast on me.
139240	142120	I see Taylor Swift has gotten a young adult novel.
142120	147400	I see our buddy's getting in the young adult game.
147400	153640	This is new in the new teen, new teen, this is brand new.
153640	157160	So I'm really, I'm really digging these incredibly vague titles.
157160	158160	Rise.
158160	159160	An Eve novel.
159160	160160	Entice.
160160	161160	Vague noncommittal name.
161160	162160	Vague noncommittal name.
162160	167280	Another and another and another.
167280	168280	But they are adjectives.
168280	169280	They are adjectives.
169280	170280	Death, doom, and detention.
170280	171280	Possession.
171280	177440	The name didn't tell me anything but her makeup is incredible.
177440	178440	Fragile darkness.
178440	180480	Or should I say beautiful insanity.
180480	181480	Faded.
181480	182480	Thirst.
182480	188480	So basically if you want to title your novel just find a verb and put it in its past participle.
188480	189480	Rift.
189480	190480	Rise.
190480	191480	Rise.
191480	192480	And crave.
192480	197000	That's the thing I look at these titles and I think about who I was when I was in middle
197000	201320	school and high school and none of these titles would ever have caught my attention.
201320	202320	Yeah.
202320	203320	Possession.
203320	204320	Captivate.
204320	205320	Entice.
205320	206320	Endure.
206320	207320	Firelight.
207320	208320	Vanish.
208320	209320	Hidden.
209320	210320	See I just kind of feel like this one's taken.
210320	216240	Now we're in just normal romance because all this stems from here really.
216240	220280	And for an example we have, for the first time in print, a complete novel because you
220280	223760	are mine.
223760	224760	Is that another rich guy thing?
224760	226080	It's another rich guy thing.
226080	227080	Sexy.
227080	228080	Confident.
228080	229080	Commanding.
229080	231000	Anything he wanted he got and what he wanted was me.
231000	232000	Damien Stark.
232000	233600	I just want to like, let's focus on that.
233600	237080	Damien Stark.
237080	241280	I um, I see what you're doing.
241280	242280	Anything he wants.
242280	244680	Dominated by the billionaire.
244680	245920	I see what you did there.
245920	247960	I just want you to know.
247960	249560	I see what you did there.
249560	250560	Just kidding.
250560	254120	Okay, this has to be like for, this has to be for gay guys.
254120	255120	This cannot be for women.
255160	259440	There's no way that that is a straight man with that gun holster and no shirt.
259440	264160	Here we have the book Cinder or the Lunar Chronicles because these books are always
264160	267640	sagas or chronicles or epics or something of that nature.
267640	271480	And here we have humans and androids crowd the raucous streets of New Beijing.
271480	274480	It's a Cinderella story with androids.
274480	275480	Ghosts.
275480	278360	She shares her mirror every morning with a phantom teenage boy.
278360	280040	Oh, so Twilight with ghosts.
280040	281680	But the ghosts are gaining power.
281720	283720	This is like one of the partial sequins.
283720	286720	And the human race is all but extinct after a war of partials.
286720	290320	Engineered, organic beings identical to humans.
290320	295760	So the partials aren't humans?
295760	296760	Test tube babies aren't humans?
296760	300440	Yeah, so what I'm learning right now is that there's not a huge world of difference between
300440	303760	the adult section and the young adult section in terms of romance.
303760	307280	Except for the young adult has more like paranormal stuff.
307280	310280	And the adult has more like billionaire-ish and shit.
312280	313280	You know what?
313280	314280	I'm out.
314280	315280	I'm out.
315280	316280	I'm out.
316280	317280	I'm out.
317280	318280	I'm out.
318280	319280	I'm out.
319280	319280
