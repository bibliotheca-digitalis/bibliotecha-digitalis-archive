0	6520	When Men in Black became a surprise hit in 1997, it didn't yet have a sequel greenlit, or even written.
6640	10160	But that shouldn't have been a problem, right? Being based on a comic book?
10160	13320	It's the sort of thing that should work well with serialization.
13320	18080	If anything would lend itself to a franchise, it would be something like Men in Black.
18080	20080	Going to get your gun back, huh?
20600	21480	I like this gun.
21480	25320	But here's the problem. Men in Black 1 was an origin story.
25360	29720	The story of fish-out-of-water Agent J joining the eponymous organization.
29920	34520	The end of the film set up a sequel, sure, but it promised a different plot and different characters.
34880	39080	Agent J is no longer a greenhorn. Agent K, the mentor figure, has retired.
39440	45040	Agent L is now the new recruit. So given this setup, what did they decide to do for the sequel?
45520	47840	Okay, well, he's retired, right?
47960	54760	Well, they retconned the ending of the first movie, slotting Will Smith's Agent J back into the position of clueless noob to recreate that
54760	57120	sweet, sweet chemistry he had with Tommy Lee Jones.
57720	59520	Agent L is clumsily written out.
59520	63440	And plus, you can't count L. I mean, she wanted to go back to the morgue.
63440	64520	I just, I helped her.
64520	69920	Frank the Pug, who has a glorified cameo in the first movie, is now bumped up to lead character because fanservice.
69920	73920	I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face.
73920	76160	And there's lots of these guys.
77440	78720	That's gonna leave a scar.
78720	84720	Men in Black 2 didn't build on what the first movie had set up. It just repeated its greatest hits.
85320	87120	And everybody hated it.
87120	92720	Any story can arguably, probably have a compelling sequel.
92720	98320	But unless it's a sort of episodic thing, like a superhero franchise, where by design,
98320	103520	it's more or less gonna have, like, the same conflict and characters each time,
103520	108720	in order for it to be a satisfying story, it should probably be different from that first one.
108720	111120	Expand on the world in some way.
111120	115320	And if that is what you're here for, I have a sequel that's out today.
115320	119920	It's called Truth of the Divine, it's a sequel to Axiom's End, and it is not the same.
119920	123520	Say what you want about it, it's different from the first one.
123520	125120	It is not Men in Black 2.
125120	128720	There, I got my plug out of the way. Seriously, it's my one thing.
128720	135920	You can buy it now, wherever books are sold, as long as you are in the US, UK, Canada, also English-speaking countries.
135920	137920	I don't get any say on the foreign rank.
137920	144320	But there are some stories that probably should just not have sequels.
152320	162920	Love Never Dies is the result of a decades-long attempt to take a fundamentally unworkable story and make it work.
162920	168520	This might also be the musical that was given the most chances of all big-budget musicals,
168520	174520	with productions in Toronto, London, Australia, and even a world tour,
174520	180520	which absolutely, yes, I went and saw, in the futile hope that audiences might take to it eventually.
180520	184520	At least an oomph of the degree to which they did Phantom of the Opera.
184520	189320	Phantom of the Opera is, by most meaningful metrics, the most successful musical of all time.
189320	195320	It has played to over 140 million people in 35 countries and 166 cities around the world,
195320	198120	with an estimated gross of $6 billion.
198120	203120	It has played over 12,000 performances across 30 years at Her Majesty's Theatre in London alone,
203120	207320	and is still the longest-running show on Broadway.
207320	208120	Suck it.
208120	212520	So just so we'll have a point of reference for what happens in Love Never Dies,
212520	217520	here is a brief summary of the stage version of Phantom of the Opera.
219320	221920	Phantom of the Opera!
221920	226920	Phantom of the Opera is the story of Christine, a young ingenue who wows Paris
226920	230120	after she falls into the role of surprise understudy
230120	234720	after the prima donna is scared off performing by the Phantom of the Opera.
234720	240120	After her gangbusters performance, we learn that Christine has been getting voice lessons from a mysterious tutor,
240120	244320	which her friend and extremely minor character Meg remarks upon.
244320	253120	I hear your voice in the darkness, yet the words aren't yours.
253120	254720	Remember Meg.
254720	256720	We'll come back to Meg.
256720	260120	So it turns out her secret mentor is actually that Phantom,
260120	264320	a supposed ghost who is actually a guy who's not only been extorting the managers,
264320	267720	but also screwing with the cast because it's fun and he hates the prima donna.
267720	272520	But this is a sexy Phantom C, and he's in love with her, and she's kind of into it,
272520	277520	but she's also kind of into her old flame Raoul, who is also rich and a vicomte.
277520	284320	So Raoul becomes the obvious choice once Christine sees the reason for his phantom-y ways, namely his face.
284320	287320	Hijinks and a love triangle ensue, the Phantom kills a few people,
287320	291920	and after basically taking the entire opera house hostage and forcing them to perform his opera,
291920	298920	Christine unmasks him on stage and he kidnaps her,
298920	302920	and the show ends with Raoul trying to rescue her but getting captured immediately,
302920	306920	after which the Phantom demands that Christine marry him or Raoul dies.
306920	310120	But when Christine shows him a moment of compassion and kisses him,
310120	314320	he realizes what an asshole he's been the whole show, and he lets the two of them go,
314320	317920	wishes them mazel, and an angry mob shows up, but he escapes,
317920	322120	and that extremely minor character, Meg, remember her,
322120	327320	picks up his mask and holds it up as the spotlight focuses on it, and the show ends.
335320	342720	Love Never Dies is the story of the Phantom having apparently learned no lessons,
342720	348720	still obsessing over Christine and plotting to lure and extort her into marrying him again.
348720	353520	Only he succeeds in his endeavor this time, but then he has to negotiate a hostage crisis,
353520	355720	which ends in Christine getting shot.
360320	363520	Or Love Never Dies is the story of Christine,
363520	367520	trapped in a loveless marriage to a negligent alcoholic gambling addict,
367520	372520	reconnecting with the serial killer who loved her and also kidnapped her ten years ago,
372520	375520	and deciding that he's actually the lesser of two evils,
375520	379520	until she gets shot by a former friend in a completely unrelated hostage crisis.
383520	386720	Or Love Never Dies is the story of Meg Giry,
386720	390720	whose mother dragged her across the ocean to Coney Island to work for the murderer
390720	394920	who'd been extorting the Paris Opera for some reason,
394920	398920	and who has been dying for said murderous extortionist's approval?
399320	405320	I was suddenly aware of a presence in the air, and I knew it was him.
405320	411320	Until one day when she realizes that he's never going to choose her over her former friend he's still obsessed with,
411320	415320	she kidnaps said friend's child with the apparent intention of doing a murder-suicide,
415320	419320	but ends up accidentally shooting her old friend instead.
425320	428320	It is perfect. I wouldn't change anything.
428320	434320	So there are some variations on this show's plot because they kept revising it and revising it,
434320	441320	trying to make it work, but I'm just going to summarize the nightmare that is most readily available.
441320	446720	The 2011 Melbourne production filmed for broadcast ten years ago.
450720	454720	It's a decade after the events of the first musical, and if you're wondering what he's been up to
455120	458120	and how his life has pivoted in a new exciting direction,
458120	463120	well, he's still whining and obsessing over Christine Daae in song form.
467120	469120	Just milking the giant cow to her portrait,
469120	475120	which is better than the West End version where he was doing it to a real doll.
475520	483520	But wake, only nothing but the cold.
483520	485520	Oh, Ramin, why?
485520	489520	We then cut to Coney Island where Alan Cumming, Harley Quinn, and Uncle Fester introduce us to
489520	494520	The Vibe, which I guess could be described as Cirque du Soleil by way of Tim Burton,
494520	496520	but not like, you know, good Tim Burton,
496520	501520	more like Disney whipped out a boatload of money to make Dumbo because what else is he gonna do, Tim Burton?
501520	504520	Let's get ready for Dumbo!
504920	508920	So this is the Phantom's show, fairground, whatever,
508920	511920	and he's rebranded himself as Mr. Y.
511920	518920	Mr. Y welcomes you to Phantasma!
518920	521920	And we learn that Meg Giri, remember her,
521920	524920	the ballerina with like ten lines from the first show,
524920	528920	is now the star of Mr. Y's sideshow through a song she performs.
529320	533320	If it's marvel and illusion that your soul and body crave,
533320	536320	you'll be leaving here content without a doubt!
536320	544320	Also, in-universe, the Phantom writes all of the songs for everything that happens under the Mr. Y umbrella,
544320	546320	so the Phantom wrote this.
546320	550320	Such a show you've never seen, such a show there's never been,
550320	553320	and today's not brand-new!
553320	558320	Anyway, she finishes the song, runs backstage to her mom, Madam Giri, who is also here,
558720	562720	and is like, I hope Phantom Senpai notices me because everybody wants to fuck this asshole now!
562720	565720	And mom is like, no, Senpai is never going to notice you, sweetie.
565720	570720	And then we get an exposition dump explaining how the Giri smuggled the Phantom out of France
570720	574720	and went with him to New York for...
574720	576720	I'm sure a very good reason.
576720	579720	Who concealed him safe away?
579720	582720	Smuggled him up to Calais?
582720	584720	Found a freighter out of France?
584720	587720	We never learn it, but I'm sure it makes perfect sense.
588120	593120	Meg learns Christine is coming to New York and the audience is also reminded that Meg and Christine were friends at one point.
593120	597120	Meg is nostalgic, Madam Giri is like, oh no, I don't like this.
597120	601120	I don't see the problem, this is ancient history.
603120	607120	The Phantom shows up randomly in Lears to remind the audience that there are Phantoms in this Phantom.
607120	613120	We then cut to a dock in New York and Christine Daae serving real Kate Winslet in Titanic realness.
613120	617120	We learn that she and Raoul are married and have a kid named Gustav,
617520	621520	but the money's tight because Raoul, turns out, is a gambler and an alcoholic.
621520	626520	Oh yeah, and our art is paying off your gambling debts is what they're saying in France.
626520	631520	And he drank away all their money, just like in all the fanfics.
631520	636520	Father dear, come play with me, come and see this toy I've got.
636520	638520	What a snob at most.
638520	643520	I can't explain it, but it was just a weirdly popular fanfic trope back in 2002.
643920	649920	And I guess Andrew Lloyd Webber spent some time on fanfiction.net.
649920	651920	AO3 didn't exist yet.
651920	655920	Is it true you left your entire fortune on a roulette table in Monte Carlo?
655920	658920	How am I supposed to feel in this moment?
658920	661920	Ganja, I didn't want to make it that everybody was attacking you.
661920	663920	You insolent jackals, how dare you?
663920	665920	I feel very attacked!
665920	667920	Relax, relax.
668920	672920	So Christine is here at the invitation of Oscar Hammerstein and Raoul is a bad dad.
673320	676320	Doesn't he love me?
676320	678320	No, he does not.
678320	681320	So Uncle Fester, Alan Cumming, and Harley Quinn show up in the Nightmare Mobile
681320	683320	and they take the fam to the hotel.
683320	689320	While Raoul drinks some more and Christine sings a very thinly veiled number about how she clearly made the wrong choice.
689320	693320	Gustav goes to bed and then who breaks down the door like the Kool-Aid man?
694320	696320	Oh yeah!
696320	697320	And then...
697720	707720	Once there was a light beneath a moonless sky.
707720	709720	Okay, so how do I explain this?
709720	713720	And I touched you.
713720	715720	And I felt you.
715720	719720	And I heard those ravishing replays.
719720	725720	This is basically like an 8 minute dirge about how at the end of the last show,
726120	728120	after Christine escaped with Raoul,
728120	733120	she immediately came right back to the Phantom to confess her love.
733120	735120	They have sex.
735120	737120	Despite his virgin status,
737120	740120	he hits it and quits it like 30 times in one night.
740120	745120	Again and again and again.
745120	747120	Stamina.
747120	749120	Stamina.
749120	751120	And I held you.
751120	752120	And I touched you.
752120	753120	And embraced you.
753120	754120	And I felt you.
754520	755520	And I caught you.
755520	756520	And I kissed you.
756520	757520	And I took you.
757520	759520	And I begged you with a knee.
759520	761520	To urge you to deny.
761520	763520	8 minutes.
763520	766520	Again and again and again.
766520	771520	Cosmopolitan's top 10 positions to try beneath a moonless sky.
771520	777520	So then after that 8 minutes, they move to the balcony and have another 5 minute ballad about nothing.
777520	779520	And then Gustav shows up.
779520	781520	And we get this amazing reaction shot.
781920	784920	Oh, shh, Gustav, it's alright, darling.
786920	789920	And because the Phantom is an asshole, he Michael Jackson's the kid,
789920	795920	and then threatens to disappear the child if Christine doesn't perform at his side show.
795920	797920	Why does he wear a mask, mother?
797920	799920	Is he a magician?
799920	802920	Yes, darling. In his way.
802920	804920	He's an asshole.
804920	806920	And so she's like, okay.
806920	809920	But then she reads it and she's like, oh boy, but his music is just so good.
810320	813320	So then we get to the notes portion of the show,
813320	817320	which is basically just a carbon copy of the same thing in the original show.
825320	828320	In this version, Christine, Raoul, Meg, and Madame Jury reconnect.
828320	831320	They all kind of figure out what's going on.
831320	835320	Meg goes single, white, female, learning that Christine is there to sing on the Phantom's invite.
835720	839720	Raoul realizes that them coming to America was a ruse engineered by the Phantom.
839720	841720	It's him.
841720	842720	Him.
842720	843720	That's what I said.
843720	845720	You work for him.
845720	846720	Now you do too.
846720	849720	Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
851720	854720	And everyone's fine with it, I guess.
854720	856720	No one is going to bring up that he killed people.
856720	858720	So Christine is doing what the Phantom asked,
858720	863720	but he lures the child to his lair at the base of a roller coaster anyway
864120	866120	to his, I guess, doom.
866120	869120	But then the kid starts playing chopsticks on his piano
869120	873120	and the Phantom starts doing middle school punnett squares in his head like,
873120	875120	oh my, a virtuoso.
875120	878120	And he makes this connection.
878120	883120	He's just ten years old.
883120	890120	Ten years old.
890520	893520	And then...
899520	901520	You can feel it.
901520	902520	Yes.
902520	903520	Come closer.
903520	904520	Yes.
904520	907520	Have no fear of the beauty underneath.
907520	909520	You can face it.
909520	910520	Yes.
910520	911520	You can take it.
911520	912520	Yes.
912520	915520	Can we please stop talking to the ten year old like that, please?
915520	917520	You'll accept it.
917520	918520	Yes.
918520	919520	You'll embrace it.
919520	920520	Yes.
920520	921520	I don't think you like it.
921520	922520	Well, why not?
922520	925520	I like this new generation of music.
925520	926520	You'll accept it.
926520	927520	Yes.
927520	928520	You'll embrace it.
928520	929520	Yes.
929520	930520	Let me show you.
930520	932520	Mother of God, it's all toilet sounds.
932520	933520	Yes.
933520	937520	Let me show you the beauty of God.
937520	940520	So it turns out Gustav can't take the beauty underneath.
940520	944520	So the Phantom does the same heel face turn he does at the end of the first show
944520	946520	and just kind of accepts it and lets him go.
946520	951520	Only where in the first show, his change of heart is precipitated by Christine showing
951520	953520	him compassion and making out with him.
953520	956520	In this show, it's precipitated by nothing.
956520	960520	The kid screams at his horrible deformity, showing that no, actually, I don't accept
960520	961520	you no matter what.
961520	965520	And the Phantom takes from this, oh man, I was being a huge asshole again, wasn't I?
965520	968520	And then Christine is just suddenly there and he's like, oh, silly me being an asshole
968520	969520	again.
969520	970520	My bad.
970520	971520	You guys can go.
971520	973520	Just don't tell your kid I'm actually his dad.
973520	976520	And she's like, no, sir, I honor my contracts.
976520	978520	I am nothing if not a professional.
978520	981520	And I will sing your music because she needs to beef up her LinkedIn.
981520	985520	And so she leaves and the Phantom, again, precipitated by nothing, is like, I will give
985520	989520	everything I have to this miracle child who can play heart and soul.
989520	990520	And then he leaves.
990520	992520	And then the real villain shows up.
992520	1002520	And it's Madame Jury, who is angry because she seems to have expected to inherit his
1002520	1003520	wealth.
1003520	1007520	Ten dark years of toil and tears.
1007520	1012520	And now what we've worked for will go to that child.
1012520	1015520	Even though they appear to be about the same age.
1015520	1017520	And that's the end of Act One.
1017520	1019520	Please clap.
1019520	1023520	So here is where we begin Act Two, where love never dies bucks musical theater tradition
1023520	1029520	by trading off a rousing, high energy act opener that gets you invested and gets the
1029520	1032520	blood pumping with this.
1038520	1039520	One more.
1039520	1042520	Buddy, don't you think you had enough?
1042520	1044520	All right.
1044520	1046520	One more drink, sir.
1046520	1047520	That's what I need.
1047520	1049520	Don't you think so?
1049520	1055520	So here's day drunk Raoul sitting at a bar giving us low tempo B side of a mid 2000s
1055520	1059520	Tom Waits album energy, complete with a boozy saxophone.
1059520	1066520	Beneath this mask I wear, there's nothing of me.
1066520	1071520	Why does she love me?
1071520	1072520	She does not.
1072520	1077520	Then Meg just shows up and establishes that she likes the ocean and its inherent eroticism
1077520	1082520	and how sometimes she just has thoughts about, I don't know, walking straight into it.
1082520	1089520	Sink into the sea, blue and cool and kind.
1089520	1091520	Then we get to this.
1091520	1094520	He's just another circus freak.
1094520	1096520	I'm not afraid of him.
1096520	1097520	Surprise, bitch.
1097520	1101520	So this dick waving contest happens and the Phantom and Raoul waste no time going behind
1101520	1103520	Christine's back to make a bet.
1103520	1108520	If she doesn't sing the song, the Phantom will then go and pay off their debts.
1108520	1111520	And if she does, then she belongs to him.
1111520	1113520	She walks.
1113520	1115520	You leave together.
1115520	1116520	Pockets full.
1116520	1118520	Debts paid.
1118520	1121520	She sings.
1121520	1124520	You leave alone.
1124520	1125520	Whatever that means.
1125520	1128520	And if you thought Christine lacked agency in the first show, well.
1128520	1132520	So Raoul is an idiot and agrees, because we need to add stakes and there's like 45 minutes
1132520	1134520	left in this show and still no plot.
1134520	1137520	Then absolutely nothing happens between the bet and the culmination of the bet.
1137520	1139520	Well, except for this.
1139520	1142520	Bathing Beauty on the beach.
1142520	1145520	Bathing Beauty, say hello.
1145520	1148520	Again, in-universe, the Phantom wrote this.
1148520	1150520	And after we're done, Meg's like,
1150520	1151520	No!
1151520	1152520	No!
1152520	1155520	What, he didn't watch me sing Bathing Beauty's?
1155520	1156520	I had quick change.
1156520	1159520	All that you gave him has all been a waste.
1159520	1162520	All that you've done, it has all been erased.
1162520	1165520	Anyway, on to the culmination of that riveting drunken bet.
1165520	1169520	Gustaf's like, Mom, I love you, as she looks into the middle distance longing for death.
1169520	1173520	Raoul shows up, begs Christine not to sing, and gives enough of a rat's ass to comb his
1173520	1177520	hair and wear a coat for once, but of course does not tell her what he did.
1177520	1179520	Don't sing the song, dear.
1179520	1180520	What?
1180520	1183520	You have to know something's terribly wrong, dear.
1183520	1187520	Someone drove a hotdog-shaped car through the window!
1187520	1189520	Come on, whoever did this, just confess.
1189520	1191520	We promise we won't be mad.
1191520	1194520	Then the Phantom shows up and does a Billy Zane, the Duke in Moulin Rouge necklace scene
1194520	1197520	to assert his natural dominance.
1197520	1202520	Only in those scenes where the necklace functions as a metaphorical collar, chaining them to
1202520	1207520	a rich guy that they do not love, here we're supposed to root for this guy?
1207520	1218520	Let me hear you sing once more!
1218520	1222520	Is it because Kate Winslet is going to pick Billy Zane this time?
1222520	1230520	Our hero?
1230520	1236520	Consummate professional that she is, she dresses up in her iconic peacock, the symbol of...
1236520	1237520	I don't know.
1237520	1245520	And she sings the song.
1245520	1249520	So then Raoul peaces out, and the scene that all the cat moms in the audience have been
1249520	1251520	waiting for for 30 years, the...
1251520	1254520	No wait, there's still another 15 minutes.
1254520	1255520	Gustav.
1255520	1256520	What is it?
1256520	1257520	Gustav!
1257520	1258520	What's wrong?
1258520	1259520	I told him to wait for Raoul!
1259520	1260520	Oh no, where's Gustav?
1260520	1262520	That jealous Madame Giry must have taken him.
1262520	1265520	Anyway, Madame Giry wasn't the real villain of the show.
1265520	1266520	It was Meg.
1266520	1267520	Yo, what is that?
1267520	1268520	A tattoo.
1268520	1269520	It's my old high school team.
1269520	1270520	The Plainview Red Herrings.
1270520	1271520	Look at it swim.
1271520	1278520	Who has now kidnapped Gustav, and is about to toss him and herself off a pier because
1278520	1281520	she's just so lonely, and Senpai won't notice her.
1281520	1287520	Always wondered how to make you watch, well watch me now!
1287520	1291520	And the Phantom only wants Christine, even though Meg has ostensibly been forced into
1291520	1293520	sex work to raise funds for him?
1293520	1295520	Dot dot dot question mark.
1295520	1298520	I gave what they would take.
1298520	1301520	I gave what they would take.
1301520	1303520	I gave it for your sake.
1303520	1308520	So the whole gang shows up and tries to talk Meg down, and then Meg throws them the child
1308520	1309520	bit.
1309520	1311520	Oh shit, look out, she's got a gun!
1311520	1313520	No, Meg, don't!
1313520	1318520	So this show ends with the Phantom of the Opera negotiating a hostage crisis.
1318520	1321520	Give me the gun, Meg.
1321520	1324520	Give me the gun, said the Phantom of the Opera.
1324520	1329520	The Phantom then deploys his hostage negotiation skills, which aren't that sharp, turns out.
1329520	1331520	He says this.
1331520	1337520	We can't all be like Christine.
1337520	1338520	Christine?
1338520	1340520	Oh, it's Christine!
1343520	1348520	So Christine dies, but at least the Phantom gets a consolation child.
1349520	1354520	Boy and man hug, kid's okay with his face now, apparently, even though his mother just
1354520	1356520	bled out in front of him.
1356520	1359520	Raoul just stands there with Christine's corpse.
1359520	1364520	And I cannot wait for the CBS sitcom around these two and a half men.
1364520	1367520	The end.
1367520	1370520	So...
1370520	1372520	Why is this?
1372520	1381520	In a post-Phantom world in the late 80s, early 90s, you have all these Broadway producers
1381520	1383520	trying to replicate Phantom's success.
1383520	1386520	Oh, God!
1386520	1388520	Oh!
1388520	1395520	From Disney's Beauty and the Beast, to Miss Saigon, to that one Batman cover.
1395520	1399520	But there was also the possibility of film adaptations for Phantom itself.
1399520	1404520	In 1989, Warner Brothers buys the movie rights and Grand Central Lloyd Webber total artistic
1404520	1409520	control, and Lord Andy handpicks a young Joel Schumacher to direct the film, based on how
1409520	1413520	much he enjoyed the vampire film The Lost Boys.
1413520	1417520	Anyway, shooting is set to go, with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman reprising their
1417520	1418520	roles.
1418520	1420520	But then...
1420520	1424520	Andrew Lloyd Webber and Sarah Brightman divorce in 1990.
1425520	1429520	Not long after the divorce, Lord Andy and Phantom designer Maria Bjornsson were having
1429520	1432520	conversations about what a Phantom sequel would look like.
1432520	1436520	Webber wanted it to take place in Manhattan, with said Phantom living in New York's first
1436520	1440520	penthouse, but changed his mind after watching a documentary about the Brooklyn Beach and
1440520	1444520	Fairground and thought, hey, how about Coney Island?
1444520	1448520	So then he has dinner with Frederick Forsythe.
1448520	1451520	Now, Frederick Forsythe is a name you might be familiar with.
1451520	1455520	He's a best-selling thriller author from England, and Brexit supporter, who is still publishing
1455520	1457520	books as recently as 2018.
1457520	1461520	So I guess you could see where a man who makes his career writing thriller mysteries from
1461520	1466520	a journalistic bent would make him a natural fit for writing a sequel to Phantom.
1466520	1471520	So Lord Andy goes up to Frederick Forsythe and tells him, okay, so I'm going to unofficially
1471520	1476520	commission you to write my Phantom sequel, and I want you to include this, this, this,
1476520	1480520	and this, and set it mostly at Coney Island.
1480520	1482520	And Frederick Forsythe is like, okay.
1482520	1484520	And he writes this concept.
1484520	1488520	And then he finishes it, and he brings it to Lord Andy, and Lord Andy is like,
1488520	1490520	huh.
1492520	1496520	I guess you sure did give me what I asked for.
1496520	1502520	Okay, so in order to understand why Love Never Dies is the way it is, I am going to need
1502520	1508520	to give you a plot summary of Frederick Forsythe's The Phantom of Manhattan.
1509520	1514520	So in Phantom of Manhattan, Eric is an impresario millionaire in New York City, having worked
1514520	1519520	his way up from Coney Island engineer in a clown mask, building roller coasters, to owning
1519520	1520520	half the city.
1520520	1524520	He has accomplished this by being a super genius, and also teaming up with this random
1524520	1532520	Persian sidekick named Darius, who worships Mamun, the god of gold, who is real.
1532520	1538520	And Mamun has granted Eric powers, and good fortune to achieve millionarity.
1538520	1544520	Now Eric wants to open a new opera house in New York City, but gasp, so does Esker Hammerstein.
1544520	1545520	What bad timing.
1545520	1550520	And he has actual historical soprano Melba as his prima donna, so what's Eric going
1550520	1551520	to do?
1551520	1554520	The only way he can make sure his opera is a winner in the great opera house race is
1554520	1557520	to bring Christine over from Europe to be his prima donna.
1557520	1561520	Eric has written an opera about a disfigured war veteran that he wants Christine to star
1561520	1562520	in.
1562520	1566520	He will conveniently switch places with the bandaged-faced vet to sing with her, and there's
1566520	1570520	also conveniently a child role that her son will get to take later too.
1570520	1573520	Also, in this version, her son's name is Pierre.
1573520	1577520	We know from the beginning of the book that Christine's son can't be Raoul's, because
1577520	1585520	before they ever even met, Raoul got his dick shot off by performing a heroic deed in Paris.
1585520	1589520	And everyone was so sad for him, thinking no woman would ever want to marry him, but
1590520	1595520	lucky for him, Christine got knocked up by guess who, and she needs a husband, everybody
1595520	1596520	wins.
1596520	1601520	So Raoul is actually super sweet and self-sacrificing in this book, if a bit of a dullard, and he
1601520	1605520	can't speak English, so he spends the whole book being confused and French.
1605520	1609520	As they come over from Europe, the boy has a tutor who is an Irish priest who has literal
1609520	1611520	conversations with God.
1611520	1615520	Much of the narration is done by a smarmy New York City reporter who's getting the
1615520	1619520	scoop on the opera house race, as well as narration from the Irish priest, Eric's
1619520	1623520	evil sidekick, and a random street urchin character?
1623520	1628520	And of course Eric himself, who begins the book explaining why Gaston Leroux was a hack
1628520	1632520	idiot, and Andrew Lloyd Webber was the correct version, actually.
1632520	1637520	Looking at his original text today, frankly one is in a quandary.
1637520	1643520	The basic idea is there, and it is brilliant, but the way poor Gaston tells it is a mess.
1643520	1649520	Much more bewildering, Leroux tells his entire story without ever giving a date when it happened.
1649520	1655520	For an investigative reporter, which he purports to be, this is a bizarre omission.
1655520	1661520	But far and away the most bizarre departure by Leroux from even the most basic rules of
1661520	1667520	investigation and reporting is his end of book seduction by a mysterious character known
1667520	1669520	only as the Persian.
1669520	1674520	This strange mountebank is briefly mentioned twice in the first two thirds of the story,
1674520	1676520	and in a most passing manner.
1676520	1677520	Yet after the abduction of-
1677520	1681520	He appears also to have made an error with the position, appearance, and intelligence
1681520	1685520	of Madame Giry, and they were corrected in the Lloyd Webber musical.
1685520	1691520	This is the story of the Lloyd Webber musical, and it is the only one to make sense.
1691520	1693520	What do you think?
1693520	1695520	It stinks.
1695520	1701520	When Christine arrives, Eric sends a monkey music box, because this is a sequel to the musical,
1701520	1705520	to her hotel, which she immediately recognizes and realizes what's going on.
1705520	1709520	Eric invites her to a Coney Island maze of mirrors to tell her what's up and confesses his love.
1709520	1711520	I love you, bitch.
1711520	1712520	Oh my god.
1712520	1715520	I ain't gonna never stop loving you, bitch.
1715520	1717520	She flees, hijinks ensue.
1717520	1722520	Eventually the opera opens, and they perform his opera, and it's so romantic.
1722520	1727520	The priest and the reporter characters are trying to figure out what's going on with the evil Persian sidekick,
1727520	1733520	and then after the opera, this evil Persian sidekick invites Christine to the park so he can kill her,
1733520	1737520	or maybe just lure Eric there to kill him, because he's evil like that.
1737520	1741520	But his reason is because Eric has forsaken his worship of mamal,
1741520	1745520	which in Farsi actually means mother.
1747520	1750520	And the sidekick must kill the non-believer or something.
1750520	1756520	Anyway, Christine dies, Eric kills his sidekick, they tell the kid Eric is his dad,
1756520	1761520	Raoul's very cool about this, the Irish priest is chill, the reporter gets his scoop,
1761520	1766520	and then Eric lives happily ever after with his son in, like, this deformed people's community.
1766520	1768520	The end.
1768520	1774520	So although Lord Andy was not interested in pursuing the sequel stage show at first,
1774520	1777520	he never really lets the idea go.
1777520	1782520	Rather emboldened by the 2004 movie's... success?
1782520	1785520	Steep as hell!
1785520	1788520	Existence? What do you even call this? I don't know.
1788520	1794520	In a Daily Mail interview from 2007, Webber confirmed that the stage sequel is still on his mind.
1794520	1802520	It's taken me ten years to decide to do this, and I want to base it on the ideas I had with Freddy Forsythe years ago
1802520	1806520	for something called The Phantom of Manhattan that came out as a book.
1806520	1812520	There are various things in the plotting that I'm not very happy with, and I think I've solved them.
1812520	1817520	I hope we can sort them out, but I'm really pretty buzzed up about it.
1817520	1823520	So in 2007, Lloyd Webber approaches friend, previous collaborator, and successful playwright-slash-screenwriter Ben Elton
1823520	1827520	We have a lot in common. I think we're like Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland.
1827520	1831520	We want to do the show right now. I don't know which is which. I don't know who's got the better legs.
1831520	1835520	to rework the ideas that Webber and Forsythe had developed a decade earlier.
1835520	1838520	And then he decides that the real problem is...
1838520	1842520	It was he who found the way through the roadblock.
1842520	1847520	He pointed out that my first thoughts for a new plot contained several new characters.
1847520	1853520	Ben suggested that any continuation of the story must be about the protagonists of the original show.
1853520	1861520	So the new characters were axed, and Gustav Christine's son is the only new principal character we meet.
1861520	1869520	Come the autumn of 2007, Ben had shaped a story that I felt I could make work.
1869520	1870520	Oh.
1870520	1873520	Give me the gun, Meg!
1873520	1877520	So they kept more or less the same tension in Antagonist,
1877520	1884520	and just searched to replace the evil Persian with Madame and Meg Giry.
1884520	1889520	Well, I guess that makes sense. Madame Giry replaced the original Persian in the original show,
1889520	1892520	so why can't she just replace the evil Persian too?
1892520	1896520	So they set it up where you think the antagonist is going to be Madame Giry,
1896520	1900520	who also really has no reason at all to feel like this,
1900520	1904520	and is already an incredibly weak motivation going forward.
1904520	1913520	All would be ours if that bastard had never been born!
1913520	1916520	Why did you think he was going to leave everything to you?
1916520	1919520	Did he say he was going to? Is he terminally ill?
1919520	1923520	Because he appears to be about your age, Madame.
1923520	1928520	So giving Madame Giry and Meg something like Darius's motivation from the original book,
1928520	1934520	which was stupid but followed its own logic, makes this ending even worse.
1934520	1937520	Giry still has the evil Persian's same motivation.
1937520	1940520	She still wants his millionarity.
1940520	1943520	But based on what? Where the hell does this come from?
1943520	1947520	She never seemed motivated by money, not in the first show and not in the second either.
1947520	1953520	And this is to say nothing of the logic of the Giry's being here at all.
1953520	1958520	Who concealed him safe away? Smuggled him up to Calais?
1958520	1965520	We grafted Forsyth's weird plot onto old characters from the first show who have no reason to be here, so...
1965520	1967520	Give me the gun, Meg!
1967520	1970520	So this new version drops all of the new characters that Forsyth added,
1970520	1973520	like the priest, the reporter, and the evil Persian,
1973520	1976520	and hews closer to characters already established in the first show.
1976520	1980520	But not without keeping some key elements, like Christine's love child with the phantom.
1980520	1984520	And the whole runs a freak show despite having been held captive in a freak show,
1984520	1986520	but I guess it's a humane freak show now?
1986520	1988520	Hurt people hurt people, I guess.
1988520	1993520	And I'd be tempted to say that at least some of this was a good artistic move moving away from that book,
1993520	1995520	but the results, man...
1995520	1997520	You can face it. Yes!
1997520	1999520	You can take it. Yes!
1999520	2003520	Also, this show wants us to root for Eric and Christine.
2003520	2009520	And in earlier versions, apparently it didn't shy away as much from the fact that he was, you know, a murderer.
2009520	2015520	But in the final version, it has to totally ignore half of the first show to make its stupid romance work.
2015520	2018520	The juries treat him like he's just some guy.
2018520	2020520	You work for him!
2020520	2022520	Now you do too!
2022520	2024520	This man has killed several people.
2024520	2029520	Everyone just kind of politely ignores everything he did in the first one,
2029520	2032520	except for his fixation on Christine.
2032520	2036520	She chose road, chose to make a new start.
2036520	2040520	Chose beauty and youth over genius and art.
2040520	2046520	Or my favorite little writing detail, the one song that is repeated from the first show.
2047520	2052520	Twisted every way, what answer can I give?
2057520	2062520	I know I can't refuse, and yet I wish I could.
2062520	2067520	Here is that song from the first musical without that crucial line cut.
2067520	2072520	He kills without a thought, he murders or that's good.
2072520	2075520	I know I can't refuse.
2075520	2078520	Hmm, feels like that might be kind of a deal breaker.
2083520	2089520	So, let's be honest, the ending of this show is pretty hilarious.
2089520	2093520	Christine! Oh, it's Christine!
2093520	2095520	Oh, does Christine get killed?
2095520	2096520	Yes!
2096520	2097520	Oh!
2099520	2103520	Amazing! Amazing!
2103520	2106520	So what is the main tension of Love Never Dies?
2106520	2108520	Well, this verse is also same as the first.
2108520	2111520	What will become of the Phantom and Christine?
2111520	2113520	Who will she choose?
2113520	2117520	But that tension resolves after she sings her peacock dress, so the main plot is tied up.
2117520	2119520	But that doesn't end the story.
2119520	2121520	The random thing has to happen.
2121520	2122520	Gustav. What is it?
2122520	2123520	Gustav! What's wrong?
2123520	2125520	I told him to wait for Raoul.
2125520	2128520	Before he asked me to. Surely he wouldn't.
2128520	2133520	The Phantom never at any point interacts with Meg before the end of the show.
2133520	2137520	The Phantom at never any point interacted with Meg in the first show.
2137520	2141520	If a tragic thing happens at the end of a story, fine, great.
2141520	2146520	But it needs to both come out of and influence the actions of our protagonist.
2146520	2150520	And while, sure, Meg was in the show before this,
2150520	2157520	this isn't like some dad who never went to Timmy's baseball games and now Timmy's gone off the edge.
2157520	2163520	Always wondered how to make you want to watch me now.
2163520	2167520	We don't know anything about what their relationship even is.
2167520	2171520	We don't know how he treats her. For all we know, this is like a fatal attraction scenario.
2171520	2175520	But while you could argue that this was set up, sort of, like they tried to,
2175520	2180520	they can't bring themselves to make the Phantom legitimately fuck them over in order to get with Christine.
2180520	2182520	So this?
2182520	2187520	I took a little trip to Coney Island.
2187520	2192520	I took a little trip because of you.
2192520	2198520	Never makes sense. He never wrongs them in any way that we actually see.
2198520	2202520	I hope Christine is worthy of you.
2202520	2208520	I hope her singing makes up for what your blindness has done to Meg.
2208520	2211520	They just feel entitled to his stuff.
2211520	2217520	The Phantom pedestalizing Christine could, in a different story, lead to some kind of downfall,
2217520	2220520	but not here. Meg feels owed by him,
2220520	2224520	but the show never gives us any indication that her feelings are justified.
2224520	2229520	And either way, Meg is not, like, his ward. She's, like, at least 30.
2229520	2232520	Man, Sherry Lewis has got it going on.
2232520	2235520	In no universe is this man responsible for what she is doing right now,
2235520	2237520	and it's weird to imply that he is.
2237520	2242520	Give me the blame for not seeing the things that you've done, Meg.
2242520	2246520	This is some poetic, thematic culmination.
2246520	2249520	All his ghosts come back to haunt him.
2249520	2252520	There could have been a story where he throws all the people who helped him
2252520	2256520	when he very much did not deserve it under the bus because of his obsession with Christine,
2256520	2261520	but the show doesn't do that because it wants the audience to root for these crazy kids.
2261520	2263520	And I cannot overstate this.
2263520	2267520	This is a fundamentally unsalvageable relationship.
2267520	2269520	We should not be rooting for them.
2269520	2272520	In this very show, he threatened to murder a child.
2272520	2282520	That perfect specimen may disappear on Coley Island.
2282520	2284520	You know what you do? You buy yourself a tape recorder,
2284520	2286520	you just record yourself for a whole day.
2286520	2288520	I think I'm going to be surprised at some of your phrasing.
2288520	2292520	And only walked it back when he realized the kid was actually his crotch dumpling.
2292520	2294520	He plays like me.
2294520	2296520	So the tragic ending isn't poetic.
2296520	2300520	It isn't the result of some mistake the Phantom actually made, and he has made many.
2300520	2303520	This isn't his past or his character flaws coming back to haunt him.
2303520	2307520	It's not him burning everything down if he can't get what he wants.
2307520	2309520	It's just a random thing.
2310520	2320520	You know, the funny thing about Empire Strikes Back when it first came out
2320520	2325520	is it was actually kind of met with mixed reviews from critics and even from fans.
2325520	2331520	And I think part of the reason for that is because people were so used to sequels
2331520	2335520	more or less kind of following the same pattern as first ones.
2335520	2340520	And the Empire Strikes Back is pretty different from the first Star Wars movie.
2340520	2346520	But it didn't take long for Empire Strikes Back to be re-evaluated as the good one.
2346520	2350520	Arguably the best one of all of the ones that have been produced.
2350520	2355520	And generally when you look at sequels that are seen as positively,
2355520	2357520	even maybe even better than the first one,
2357520	2359520	it's probably because they try new things.
2359520	2361520	They expand on the world.
2361520	2363520	They introduce new characters.
2363520	2365520	They take the story in a different direction.
2365520	2370520	Because presumably your characters have grown since that first story.
2370520	2374520	Phantom of the Opera ends with him letting Christine go.
2374520	2379520	And the reason that the musical is more compelling than most other versions
2379520	2383520	is because it's one of the only ones where that happens.
2383520	2389520	Where he voluntarily kind of sees the error of his ways and lets her go.
2389520	2396520	Why undo the thing that made your first show work in the first place?
2396520	2399520	So you could say that Love Never Dies is a story for the ages
2399520	2402520	about the need to recapture lightning in a bottle.
2402520	2406520	A story of being unable to let go of the past.
2406520	2411520	But at the same time I strain to think of this as a cynical lazy cash grab
2411520	2413520	in the vein of Men in Black 2.
2413520	2417520	It's just so, I don't know, sincere?
2418520	2421520	Andrew Lloyd Webber wanted this to work.
2421520	2425520	And moreover, you can't say that there was no care or passion here.
2425520	2428520	Just look at the costumes and the sets.
2428520	2433520	The costumes in particular are arguably better than the ones from Phantom of the Opera.
2433520	2441520	Because Phantom of the Opera 1 is so melodramatic and loud and high emotions,
2441520	2446520	and because I strain to see a scenario where a Phantom of the Opera sequel
2446520	2451520	that includes the Phantom and Christine doing the same shit they did in the first one,
2451520	2454520	not being a complete trash fire.
2454520	2461520	I just, I can't imagine any sequel to that version of Phantom of the Opera
2461520	2465520	being anything but, just, you can't look away from it.
2465520	2469520	It is just going to inevitably be captivating.
2469520	2474520	It is baffling. It is bad from start to finish.
2474520	2477520	But it is also eminently watchable.
2477520	2479520	And for that, I can't say I hate it.
2479520	2483520	I love the shit out of Love Never Dies.
2483520	2486520	You might say my love for Love Never Dies never dies.
2486520	2489520	As you know, my single, my single is dropping, it's dropping.
2489520	2493520	But of course, there are also many Phantom sequels and retellings out there.
2493520	2496520	They don't necessarily have to take the form of a stage show.
2496520	2503520	My favorite sequel is a fanfic that was published by some mysterious author like 10 years ago.
2503520	2507520	There's books, and also, there's audiobooks.
2507520	2510520	Hi, did you know that this is not a conflict of interest?
2510520	2512520	I was surprised too.
2512520	2516520	But either way, I get to promote my new audiobook, Truth of the Divine,
2516520	2520520	by way of our sponsor, Audible.
