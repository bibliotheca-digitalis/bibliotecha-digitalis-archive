1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
When Men in Black became a surprise hit in 1997, it didn't yet have a sequel greenlit, or even written.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,160
But that shouldn't have been a problem, right? Being based on a comic book?

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,320
It's the sort of thing that should work well with serialization.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,080
If anything would lend itself to a franchise, it would be something like Men in Black.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,080
Going to get your gun back, huh?

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,480
I like this gun.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,320
But here's the problem. Men in Black 1 was an origin story.

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,720
The story of fish-out-of-water Agent J joining the eponymous organization.

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,520
The end of the film set up a sequel, sure, but it promised a different plot and different characters.

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,080
Agent J is no longer a greenhorn. Agent K, the mentor figure, has retired.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,040
Agent L is now the new recruit. So given this setup, what did they decide to do for the sequel?

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,840
Okay, well, he's retired, right?

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:54,760
Well, they retconned the ending of the first movie, slotting Will Smith's Agent J back into the position of clueless noob to recreate that

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,120
sweet, sweet chemistry he had with Tommy Lee Jones.

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,520
Agent L is clumsily written out.

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,440
And plus, you can't count L. I mean, she wanted to go back to the morgue.

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,520
I just, I helped her.

18
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:09,920
Frank the Pug, who has a glorified cameo in the first movie, is now bumped up to lead character because fanservice.

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,920
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face.

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,160
And there's lots of these guys.

21
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,720
That's gonna leave a scar.

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,720
Men in Black 2 didn't build on what the first movie had set up. It just repeated its greatest hits.

23
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,120
And everybody hated it.

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,720
Any story can arguably, probably have a compelling sequel.

25
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,320
But unless it's a sort of episodic thing, like a superhero franchise, where by design,

26
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,520
it's more or less gonna have, like, the same conflict and characters each time,

27
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,720
in order for it to be a satisfying story, it should probably be different from that first one.

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,120
Expand on the world in some way.

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,320
And if that is what you're here for, I have a sequel that's out today.

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,920
It's called Truth of the Divine, it's a sequel to Axiom's End, and it is not the same.

31
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,520
Say what you want about it, it's different from the first one.

32
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,120
It is not Men in Black 2.

33
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,720
There, I got my plug out of the way. Seriously, it's my one thing.

34
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,920
You can buy it now, wherever books are sold, as long as you are in the US, UK, Canada, also English-speaking countries.

35
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,920
I don't get any say on the foreign rank.

36
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,320
But there are some stories that probably should just not have sequels.

37
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:42,920
Love Never Dies is the result of a decades-long attempt to take a fundamentally unworkable story and make it work.

38
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,520
This might also be the musical that was given the most chances of all big-budget musicals,

39
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:54,520
with productions in Toronto, London, Australia, and even a world tour,

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:00,520
which absolutely, yes, I went and saw, in the futile hope that audiences might take to it eventually.

41
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,520
At least an oomph of the degree to which they did Phantom of the Opera.

42
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,320
Phantom of the Opera is, by most meaningful metrics, the most successful musical of all time.

43
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:15,320
It has played to over 140 million people in 35 countries and 166 cities around the world,

44
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,120
with an estimated gross of $6 billion.

45
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,120
It has played over 12,000 performances across 30 years at Her Majesty's Theatre in London alone,

46
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,320
and is still the longest-running show on Broadway.

47
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,120
Suck it.

48
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,520
So just so we'll have a point of reference for what happens in Love Never Dies,

49
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,520
here is a brief summary of the stage version of Phantom of the Opera.

50
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,920
Phantom of the Opera!

51
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,920
Phantom of the Opera is the story of Christine, a young ingenue who wows Paris

52
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,120
after she falls into the role of surprise understudy

53
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,720
after the prima donna is scared off performing by the Phantom of the Opera.

54
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,120
After her gangbusters performance, we learn that Christine has been getting voice lessons from a mysterious tutor,

55
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,320
which her friend and extremely minor character Meg remarks upon.

56
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:13,120
I hear your voice in the darkness, yet the words aren't yours.

57
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,720
Remember Meg.

58
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,720
We'll come back to Meg.

59
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,120
So it turns out her secret mentor is actually that Phantom,

60
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,320
a supposed ghost who is actually a guy who's not only been extorting the managers,

61
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,720
but also screwing with the cast because it's fun and he hates the prima donna.

62
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,520
But this is a sexy Phantom C, and he's in love with her, and she's kind of into it,

63
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,520
but she's also kind of into her old flame Raoul, who is also rich and a vicomte.

64
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,320
So Raoul becomes the obvious choice once Christine sees the reason for his phantom-y ways, namely his face.

65
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,320
Hijinks and a love triangle ensue, the Phantom kills a few people,

66
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,920
and after basically taking the entire opera house hostage and forcing them to perform his opera,

67
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:58,920
Christine unmasks him on stage and he kidnaps her,

68
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,920
and the show ends with Raoul trying to rescue her but getting captured immediately,

69
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,920
after which the Phantom demands that Christine marry him or Raoul dies.

70
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,120
But when Christine shows him a moment of compassion and kisses him,

71
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,320
he realizes what an asshole he's been the whole show, and he lets the two of them go,

72
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,920
wishes them mazel, and an angry mob shows up, but he escapes,

73
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,120
and that extremely minor character, Meg, remember her,

74
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,320
picks up his mask and holds it up as the spotlight focuses on it, and the show ends.

75
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:42,720
Love Never Dies is the story of the Phantom having apparently learned no lessons,

76
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,720
still obsessing over Christine and plotting to lure and extort her into marrying him again.

77
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,520
Only he succeeds in his endeavor this time, but then he has to negotiate a hostage crisis,

78
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,720
which ends in Christine getting shot.

79
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,520
Or Love Never Dies is the story of Christine,

80
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,520
trapped in a loveless marriage to a negligent alcoholic gambling addict,

81
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,520
reconnecting with the serial killer who loved her and also kidnapped her ten years ago,

82
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,520
and deciding that he's actually the lesser of two evils,

83
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,520
until she gets shot by a former friend in a completely unrelated hostage crisis.

84
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,720
Or Love Never Dies is the story of Meg Giry,

85
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,720
whose mother dragged her across the ocean to Coney Island to work for the murderer

86
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,920
who'd been extorting the Paris Opera for some reason,

87
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,920
and who has been dying for said murderous extortionist's approval?

88
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:45,320
I was suddenly aware of a presence in the air, and I knew it was him.

89
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:51,320
Until one day when she realizes that he's never going to choose her over her former friend he's still obsessed with,

90
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,320
she kidnaps said friend's child with the apparent intention of doing a murder-suicide,

91
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,320
but ends up accidentally shooting her old friend instead.

92
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,320
It is perfect. I wouldn't change anything.

93
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:14,320
So there are some variations on this show's plot because they kept revising it and revising it,

94
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:21,320
trying to make it work, but I'm just going to summarize the nightmare that is most readily available.

95
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,720
The 2011 Melbourne production filmed for broadcast ten years ago.

96
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,720
It's a decade after the events of the first musical, and if you're wondering what he's been up to

97
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,120
and how his life has pivoted in a new exciting direction,

98
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,120
well, he's still whining and obsessing over Christine Daae in song form.

99
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
Just milking the giant cow to her portrait,

100
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,120
which is better than the West End version where he was doing it to a real doll.

101
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:03,520
But wake, only nothing but the cold.

102
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,520
Oh, Ramin, why?

103
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,520
We then cut to Coney Island where Alan Cumming, Harley Quinn, and Uncle Fester introduce us to

104
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,520
The Vibe, which I guess could be described as Cirque du Soleil by way of Tim Burton,

105
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,520
but not like, you know, good Tim Burton,

106
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,520
more like Disney whipped out a boatload of money to make Dumbo because what else is he gonna do, Tim Burton?

107
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,520
Let's get ready for Dumbo!

108
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,920
So this is the Phantom's show, fairground, whatever,

109
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,920
and he's rebranded himself as Mr. Y.

110
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:38,920
Mr. Y welcomes you to Phantasma!

111
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,920
And we learn that Meg Giri, remember her,

112
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,920
the ballerina with like ten lines from the first show,

113
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,920
is now the star of Mr. Y's sideshow through a song she performs.

114
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,320
If it's marvel and illusion that your soul and body crave,

115
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,320
you'll be leaving here content without a doubt!

116
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:04,320
Also, in-universe, the Phantom writes all of the songs for everything that happens under the Mr. Y umbrella,

117
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
so the Phantom wrote this.

118
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,320
Such a show you've never seen, such a show there's never been,

119
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,320
and today's not brand-new!

120
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,320
Anyway, she finishes the song, runs backstage to her mom, Madam Giri, who is also here,

121
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,720
and is like, I hope Phantom Senpai notices me because everybody wants to fuck this asshole now!

122
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,720
And mom is like, no, Senpai is never going to notice you, sweetie.

123
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,720
And then we get an exposition dump explaining how the Giri smuggled the Phantom out of France

124
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,720
and went with him to New York for...

125
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
I'm sure a very good reason.

126
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,720
Who concealed him safe away?

127
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,720
Smuggled him up to Calais?

128
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
Found a freighter out of France?

129
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,720
We never learn it, but I'm sure it makes perfect sense.

130
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,120
Meg learns Christine is coming to New York and the audience is also reminded that Meg and Christine were friends at one point.

131
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,120
Meg is nostalgic, Madam Giri is like, oh no, I don't like this.

132
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,120
I don't see the problem, this is ancient history.

133
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,120
The Phantom shows up randomly in Lears to remind the audience that there are Phantoms in this Phantom.

134
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,120
We then cut to a dock in New York and Christine Daae serving real Kate Winslet in Titanic realness.

135
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,120
We learn that she and Raoul are married and have a kid named Gustav,

136
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,520
but the money's tight because Raoul, turns out, is a gambler and an alcoholic.

137
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,520
Oh yeah, and our art is paying off your gambling debts is what they're saying in France.

138
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,520
And he drank away all their money, just like in all the fanfics.

139
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:36,520
Father dear, come play with me, come and see this toy I've got.

140
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,520
What a snob at most.

141
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,520
I can't explain it, but it was just a weirdly popular fanfic trope back in 2002.

142
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,920
And I guess Andrew Lloyd Webber spent some time on fanfiction.net.

143
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
AO3 didn't exist yet.

144
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,920
Is it true you left your entire fortune on a roulette table in Monte Carlo?

145
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,920
How am I supposed to feel in this moment?

146
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,920
Ganja, I didn't want to make it that everybody was attacking you.

147
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,920
You insolent jackals, how dare you?

148
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
I feel very attacked!

149
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,920
Relax, relax.

150
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,920
So Christine is here at the invitation of Oscar Hammerstein and Raoul is a bad dad.

151
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,320
Doesn't he love me?

152
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
No, he does not.

153
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,320
So Uncle Fester, Alan Cumming, and Harley Quinn show up in the Nightmare Mobile

154
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,320
and they take the fam to the hotel.

155
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,320
While Raoul drinks some more and Christine sings a very thinly veiled number about how she clearly made the wrong choice.

156
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,320
Gustav goes to bed and then who breaks down the door like the Kool-Aid man?

157
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
Oh yeah!

158
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,320
And then...

159
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:47,720
Once there was a light beneath a moonless sky.

160
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Okay, so how do I explain this?

161
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,720
And I touched you.

162
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,720
And I felt you.

163
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,720
And I heard those ravishing replays.

164
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:05,720
This is basically like an 8 minute dirge about how at the end of the last show,

165
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,120
after Christine escaped with Raoul,

166
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,120
she immediately came right back to the Phantom to confess her love.

167
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,120
They have sex.

168
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Despite his virgin status,

169
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,120
he hits it and quits it like 30 times in one night.

170
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,120
Again and again and again.

171
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
Stamina.

172
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,120
Stamina.

173
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,120
And I held you.

174
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,120
And I touched you.

175
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,120
And embraced you.

176
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,120
And I felt you.

177
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,520
And I caught you.

178
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
And I kissed you.

179
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,520
And I took you.

180
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,520
And I begged you with a knee.

181
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,520
To urge you to deny.

182
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,520
8 minutes.

183
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,520
Again and again and again.

184
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,520
Cosmopolitan's top 10 positions to try beneath a moonless sky.

185
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:57,520
So then after that 8 minutes, they move to the balcony and have another 5 minute ballad about nothing.

186
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,520
And then Gustav shows up.

187
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,520
And we get this amazing reaction shot.

188
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,920
Oh, shh, Gustav, it's alright, darling.

189
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,920
And because the Phantom is an asshole, he Michael Jackson's the kid,

190
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,920
and then threatens to disappear the child if Christine doesn't perform at his side show.

191
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,920
Why does he wear a mask, mother?

192
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
Is he a magician?

193
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,920
Yes, darling. In his way.

194
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,920
He's an asshole.

195
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,920
And so she's like, okay.

196
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,920
But then she reads it and she's like, oh boy, but his music is just so good.

197
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,320
So then we get to the notes portion of the show,

198
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,320
which is basically just a carbon copy of the same thing in the original show.

199
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,320
In this version, Christine, Raoul, Meg, and Madame Jury reconnect.

200
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,320
They all kind of figure out what's going on.

201
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,320
Meg goes single, white, female, learning that Christine is there to sing on the Phantom's invite.

202
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,720
Raoul realizes that them coming to America was a ruse engineered by the Phantom.

203
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,720
It's him.

204
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,720
Him.

205
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
That's what I said.

206
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,720
You work for him.

207
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,720
Now you do too.

208
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

209
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,720
And everyone's fine with it, I guess.

210
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
No one is going to bring up that he killed people.

211
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
So Christine is doing what the Phantom asked,

212
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,720
but he lures the child to his lair at the base of a roller coaster anyway

213
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,120
to his, I guess, doom.

214
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,120
But then the kid starts playing chopsticks on his piano

215
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,120
and the Phantom starts doing middle school punnett squares in his head like,

216
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,120
oh my, a virtuoso.

217
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,120
And he makes this connection.

218
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,120
He's just ten years old.

219
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:50,120
Ten years old.

220
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,520
And then...

221
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,520
You can feel it.

222
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,520
Yes.

223
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,520
Come closer.

224
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,520
Yes.

225
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,520
Have no fear of the beauty underneath.

226
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,520
You can face it.

227
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
Yes.

228
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,520
You can take it.

229
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
Yes.

230
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,520
Can we please stop talking to the ten year old like that, please?

231
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,520
You'll accept it.

232
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
Yes.

233
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,520
You'll embrace it.

234
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,520
Yes.

235
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
I don't think you like it.

236
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
Well, why not?

237
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,520
I like this new generation of music.

238
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
You'll accept it.

239
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,520
Yes.

240
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
You'll embrace it.

241
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,520
Yes.

242
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
Let me show you.

243
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
Mother of God, it's all toilet sounds.

244
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,520
Yes.

245
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,520
Let me show you the beauty of God.

246
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,520
So it turns out Gustav can't take the beauty underneath.

247
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,520
So the Phantom does the same heel face turn he does at the end of the first show

248
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
and just kind of accepts it and lets him go.

249
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,520
Only where in the first show, his change of heart is precipitated by Christine showing

250
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,520
him compassion and making out with him.

251
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,520
In this show, it's precipitated by nothing.

252
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,520
The kid screams at his horrible deformity, showing that no, actually, I don't accept

253
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
you no matter what.

254
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,520
And the Phantom takes from this, oh man, I was being a huge asshole again, wasn't I?

255
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,520
And then Christine is just suddenly there and he's like, oh, silly me being an asshole

256
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
again.

257
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
My bad.

258
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,520
You guys can go.

259
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,520
Just don't tell your kid I'm actually his dad.

260
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,520
And she's like, no, sir, I honor my contracts.

261
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,520
I am nothing if not a professional.

262
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,520
And I will sing your music because she needs to beef up her LinkedIn.

263
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,520
And so she leaves and the Phantom, again, precipitated by nothing, is like, I will give

264
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,520
everything I have to this miracle child who can play heart and soul.

265
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,520
And then he leaves.

266
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,520
And then the real villain shows up.

267
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:42,520
And it's Madame Jury, who is angry because she seems to have expected to inherit his

268
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,520
wealth.

269
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,520
Ten dark years of toil and tears.

270
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,520
And now what we've worked for will go to that child.

271
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,520
Even though they appear to be about the same age.

272
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,520
And that's the end of Act One.

273
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,520
Please clap.

274
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,520
So here is where we begin Act Two, where love never dies bucks musical theater tradition

275
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:09,520
by trading off a rousing, high energy act opener that gets you invested and gets the

276
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,520
blood pumping with this.

277
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,520
One more.

278
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,520
Buddy, don't you think you had enough?

279
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,520
All right.

280
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
One more drink, sir.

281
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,520
That's what I need.

282
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
Don't you think so?

283
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,520
So here's day drunk Raoul sitting at a bar giving us low tempo B side of a mid 2000s

284
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,520
Tom Waits album energy, complete with a boozy saxophone.

285
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:46,520
Beneath this mask I wear, there's nothing of me.

286
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,520
Why does she love me?

287
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,520
She does not.

288
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,520
Then Meg just shows up and establishes that she likes the ocean and its inherent eroticism

289
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,520
and how sometimes she just has thoughts about, I don't know, walking straight into it.

290
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:09,520
Sink into the sea, blue and cool and kind.

291
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Then we get to this.

292
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,520
He's just another circus freak.

293
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,520
I'm not afraid of him.

294
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,520
Surprise, bitch.

295
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,520
So this dick waving contest happens and the Phantom and Raoul waste no time going behind

296
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,520
Christine's back to make a bet.

297
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,520
If she doesn't sing the song, the Phantom will then go and pay off their debts.

298
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,520
And if she does, then she belongs to him.

299
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
She walks.

300
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
You leave together.

301
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
Pockets full.

302
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,520
Debts paid.

303
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,520
She sings.

304
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,520
You leave alone.

305
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,520
Whatever that means.

306
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,520
And if you thought Christine lacked agency in the first show, well.

307
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,520
So Raoul is an idiot and agrees, because we need to add stakes and there's like 45 minutes

308
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,520
left in this show and still no plot.

309
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,520
Then absolutely nothing happens between the bet and the culmination of the bet.

310
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,520
Well, except for this.

311
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,520
Bathing Beauty on the beach.

312
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,520
Bathing Beauty, say hello.

313
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,520
Again, in-universe, the Phantom wrote this.

314
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,520
And after we're done, Meg's like,

315
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,520
No!

316
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
No!

317
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,520
What, he didn't watch me sing Bathing Beauty's?

318
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,520
I had quick change.

319
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,520
All that you gave him has all been a waste.

320
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,520
All that you've done, it has all been erased.

321
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,520
Anyway, on to the culmination of that riveting drunken bet.

322
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,520
Gustaf's like, Mom, I love you, as she looks into the middle distance longing for death.

323
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,520
Raoul shows up, begs Christine not to sing, and gives enough of a rat's ass to comb his

324
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,520
hair and wear a coat for once, but of course does not tell her what he did.

325
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,520
Don't sing the song, dear.

326
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,520
What?

327
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,520
You have to know something's terribly wrong, dear.

328
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,520
Someone drove a hotdog-shaped car through the window!

329
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
Come on, whoever did this, just confess.

330
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,520
We promise we won't be mad.

331
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,520
Then the Phantom shows up and does a Billy Zane, the Duke in Moulin Rouge necklace scene

332
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,520
to assert his natural dominance.

333
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,520
Only in those scenes where the necklace functions as a metaphorical collar, chaining them to

334
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,520
a rich guy that they do not love, here we're supposed to root for this guy?

335
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:18,520
Let me hear you sing once more!

336
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,520
Is it because Kate Winslet is going to pick Billy Zane this time?

337
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Our hero?

338
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:36,520
Consummate professional that she is, she dresses up in her iconic peacock, the symbol of...

339
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,520
I don't know.

340
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:45,520
And she sings the song.

341
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,520
So then Raoul peaces out, and the scene that all the cat moms in the audience have been

342
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,520
waiting for for 30 years, the...

343
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,520
No wait, there's still another 15 minutes.

344
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,520
Gustav.

345
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,520
What is it?

346
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
Gustav!

347
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
What's wrong?

348
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,520
I told him to wait for Raoul!

349
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,520
Oh no, where's Gustav?

350
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,520
That jealous Madame Giry must have taken him.

351
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,520
Anyway, Madame Giry wasn't the real villain of the show.

352
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,520
It was Meg.

353
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,520
Yo, what is that?

354
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,520
A tattoo.

355
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,520
It's my old high school team.

356
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,520
The Plainview Red Herrings.

357
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,520
Look at it swim.

358
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:18,520
Who has now kidnapped Gustav, and is about to toss him and herself off a pier because

359
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,520
she's just so lonely, and Senpai won't notice her.

360
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,520
Always wondered how to make you watch, well watch me now!

361
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,520
And the Phantom only wants Christine, even though Meg has ostensibly been forced into

362
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,520
sex work to raise funds for him?

363
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,520
Dot dot dot question mark.

364
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,520
I gave what they would take.

365
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,520
I gave what they would take.

366
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,520
I gave it for your sake.

367
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,520
So the whole gang shows up and tries to talk Meg down, and then Meg throws them the child

368
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,520
bit.

369
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,520
Oh shit, look out, she's got a gun!

370
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,520
No, Meg, don't!

371
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,520
So this show ends with the Phantom of the Opera negotiating a hostage crisis.

372
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,520
Give me the gun, Meg.

373
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,520
Give me the gun, said the Phantom of the Opera.

374
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,520
The Phantom then deploys his hostage negotiation skills, which aren't that sharp, turns out.

375
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,520
He says this.

376
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:17,520
We can't all be like Christine.

377
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
Christine?

378
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,520
Oh, it's Christine!

379
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,520
So Christine dies, but at least the Phantom gets a consolation child.

380
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,520
Boy and man hug, kid's okay with his face now, apparently, even though his mother just

381
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,520
bled out in front of him.

382
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,520
Raoul just stands there with Christine's corpse.

383
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,520
And I cannot wait for the CBS sitcom around these two and a half men.

384
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,520
The end.

385
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,520
So...

386
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,520
Why is this?

387
00:22:52,520 --> 00:23:01,520
In a post-Phantom world in the late 80s, early 90s, you have all these Broadway producers

388
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,520
trying to replicate Phantom's success.

389
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,520
Oh, God!

390
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,520
Oh!

391
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:15,520
From Disney's Beauty and the Beast, to Miss Saigon, to that one Batman cover.

392
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,520
But there was also the possibility of film adaptations for Phantom itself.

393
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,520
In 1989, Warner Brothers buys the movie rights and Grand Central Lloyd Webber total artistic

394
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,520
control, and Lord Andy handpicks a young Joel Schumacher to direct the film, based on how

395
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,520
much he enjoyed the vampire film The Lost Boys.

396
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,520
Anyway, shooting is set to go, with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman reprising their

397
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
roles.

398
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,520
But then...

399
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,520
Andrew Lloyd Webber and Sarah Brightman divorce in 1990.

400
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,520
Not long after the divorce, Lord Andy and Phantom designer Maria Bjornsson were having

401
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,520
conversations about what a Phantom sequel would look like.

402
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,520
Webber wanted it to take place in Manhattan, with said Phantom living in New York's first

403
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,520
penthouse, but changed his mind after watching a documentary about the Brooklyn Beach and

404
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,520
Fairground and thought, hey, how about Coney Island?

405
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,520
So then he has dinner with Frederick Forsythe.

406
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,520
Now, Frederick Forsythe is a name you might be familiar with.

407
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,520
He's a best-selling thriller author from England, and Brexit supporter, who is still publishing

408
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
books as recently as 2018.

409
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,520
So I guess you could see where a man who makes his career writing thriller mysteries from

410
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,520
a journalistic bent would make him a natural fit for writing a sequel to Phantom.

411
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:31,520
So Lord Andy goes up to Frederick Forsythe and tells him, okay, so I'm going to unofficially

412
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,520
commission you to write my Phantom sequel, and I want you to include this, this, this,

413
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,520
and this, and set it mostly at Coney Island.

414
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,520
And Frederick Forsythe is like, okay.

415
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,520
And he writes this concept.

416
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,520
And then he finishes it, and he brings it to Lord Andy, and Lord Andy is like,

417
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,520
huh.

418
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,520
I guess you sure did give me what I asked for.

419
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:02,520
Okay, so in order to understand why Love Never Dies is the way it is, I am going to need

420
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:08,520
to give you a plot summary of Frederick Forsythe's The Phantom of Manhattan.

421
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,520
So in Phantom of Manhattan, Eric is an impresario millionaire in New York City, having worked

422
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:19,520
his way up from Coney Island engineer in a clown mask, building roller coasters, to owning

423
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,520
half the city.

424
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,520
He has accomplished this by being a super genius, and also teaming up with this random

425
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:32,520
Persian sidekick named Darius, who worships Mamun, the god of gold, who is real.

426
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:38,520
And Mamun has granted Eric powers, and good fortune to achieve millionarity.

427
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:44,520
Now Eric wants to open a new opera house in New York City, but gasp, so does Esker Hammerstein.

428
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,520
What bad timing.

429
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,520
And he has actual historical soprano Melba as his prima donna, so what's Eric going

430
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,520
to do?

431
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,520
The only way he can make sure his opera is a winner in the great opera house race is

432
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,520
to bring Christine over from Europe to be his prima donna.

433
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,520
Eric has written an opera about a disfigured war veteran that he wants Christine to star

434
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,520
in.

435
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,520
He will conveniently switch places with the bandaged-faced vet to sing with her, and there's

436
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,520
also conveniently a child role that her son will get to take later too.

437
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,520
Also, in this version, her son's name is Pierre.

438
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,520
We know from the beginning of the book that Christine's son can't be Raoul's, because

439
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:25,520
before they ever even met, Raoul got his dick shot off by performing a heroic deed in Paris.

440
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,520
And everyone was so sad for him, thinking no woman would ever want to marry him, but

441
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:35,520
lucky for him, Christine got knocked up by guess who, and she needs a husband, everybody

442
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,520
wins.

443
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:41,520
So Raoul is actually super sweet and self-sacrificing in this book, if a bit of a dullard, and he

444
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,520
can't speak English, so he spends the whole book being confused and French.

445
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,520
As they come over from Europe, the boy has a tutor who is an Irish priest who has literal

446
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,520
conversations with God.

447
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,520
Much of the narration is done by a smarmy New York City reporter who's getting the

448
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,520
scoop on the opera house race, as well as narration from the Irish priest, Eric's

449
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,520
evil sidekick, and a random street urchin character?

450
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,520
And of course Eric himself, who begins the book explaining why Gaston Leroux was a hack

451
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,520
idiot, and Andrew Lloyd Webber was the correct version, actually.

452
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:17,520
Looking at his original text today, frankly one is in a quandary.

453
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:23,520
The basic idea is there, and it is brilliant, but the way poor Gaston tells it is a mess.

454
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,520
Much more bewildering, Leroux tells his entire story without ever giving a date when it happened.

455
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:35,520
For an investigative reporter, which he purports to be, this is a bizarre omission.

456
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:41,520
But far and away the most bizarre departure by Leroux from even the most basic rules of

457
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:47,520
investigation and reporting is his end of book seduction by a mysterious character known

458
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,520
only as the Persian.

459
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,520
This strange mountebank is briefly mentioned twice in the first two thirds of the story,

460
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,520
and in a most passing manner.

461
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,520
Yet after the abduction of-

462
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,520
He appears also to have made an error with the position, appearance, and intelligence

463
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,520
of Madame Giry, and they were corrected in the Lloyd Webber musical.

464
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:11,520
This is the story of the Lloyd Webber musical, and it is the only one to make sense.

465
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
What do you think?

466
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,520
It stinks.

467
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:21,520
When Christine arrives, Eric sends a monkey music box, because this is a sequel to the musical,

468
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,520
to her hotel, which she immediately recognizes and realizes what's going on.

469
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,520
Eric invites her to a Coney Island maze of mirrors to tell her what's up and confesses his love.

470
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,520
I love you, bitch.

471
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,520
Oh my god.

472
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,520
I ain't gonna never stop loving you, bitch.

473
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,520
She flees, hijinks ensue.

474
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,520
Eventually the opera opens, and they perform his opera, and it's so romantic.

475
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:47,520
The priest and the reporter characters are trying to figure out what's going on with the evil Persian sidekick,

476
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:53,520
and then after the opera, this evil Persian sidekick invites Christine to the park so he can kill her,

477
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,520
or maybe just lure Eric there to kill him, because he's evil like that.

478
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,520
But his reason is because Eric has forsaken his worship of mamal,

479
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,520
which in Farsi actually means mother.

480
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,520
And the sidekick must kill the non-believer or something.

481
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:16,520
Anyway, Christine dies, Eric kills his sidekick, they tell the kid Eric is his dad,

482
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,520
Raoul's very cool about this, the Irish priest is chill, the reporter gets his scoop,

483
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,520
and then Eric lives happily ever after with his son in, like, this deformed people's community.

484
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,520
The end.

485
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:34,520
So although Lord Andy was not interested in pursuing the sequel stage show at first,

486
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,520
he never really lets the idea go.

487
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,520
Rather emboldened by the 2004 movie's... success?

488
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,520
Steep as hell!

489
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,520
Existence? What do you even call this? I don't know.

490
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:54,520
In a Daily Mail interview from 2007, Webber confirmed that the stage sequel is still on his mind.

491
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:02,520
It's taken me ten years to decide to do this, and I want to base it on the ideas I had with Freddy Forsythe years ago

492
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,520
for something called The Phantom of Manhattan that came out as a book.

493
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:12,520
There are various things in the plotting that I'm not very happy with, and I think I've solved them.

494
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:17,520
I hope we can sort them out, but I'm really pretty buzzed up about it.

495
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,520
So in 2007, Lloyd Webber approaches friend, previous collaborator, and successful playwright-slash-screenwriter Ben Elton

496
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,520
We have a lot in common. I think we're like Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland.

497
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,520
We want to do the show right now. I don't know which is which. I don't know who's got the better legs.

498
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,520
to rework the ideas that Webber and Forsythe had developed a decade earlier.

499
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,520
And then he decides that the real problem is...

500
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,520
It was he who found the way through the roadblock.

501
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:47,520
He pointed out that my first thoughts for a new plot contained several new characters.

502
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:53,520
Ben suggested that any continuation of the story must be about the protagonists of the original show.

503
00:30:53,520 --> 00:31:01,520
So the new characters were axed, and Gustav Christine's son is the only new principal character we meet.

504
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:09,520
Come the autumn of 2007, Ben had shaped a story that I felt I could make work.

505
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,520
Oh.

506
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,520
Give me the gun, Meg!

507
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,520
So they kept more or less the same tension in Antagonist,

508
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:24,520
and just searched to replace the evil Persian with Madame and Meg Giry.

509
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:29,520
Well, I guess that makes sense. Madame Giry replaced the original Persian in the original show,

510
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,520
so why can't she just replace the evil Persian too?

511
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,520
So they set it up where you think the antagonist is going to be Madame Giry,

512
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,520
who also really has no reason at all to feel like this,

513
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,520
and is already an incredibly weak motivation going forward.

514
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:53,520
All would be ours if that bastard had never been born!

515
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,520
Why did you think he was going to leave everything to you?

516
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,520
Did he say he was going to? Is he terminally ill?

517
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,520
Because he appears to be about your age, Madame.

518
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:08,520
So giving Madame Giry and Meg something like Darius's motivation from the original book,

519
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:14,520
which was stupid but followed its own logic, makes this ending even worse.

520
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,520
Giry still has the evil Persian's same motivation.

521
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,520
She still wants his millionarity.

522
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,520
But based on what? Where the hell does this come from?

523
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,520
She never seemed motivated by money, not in the first show and not in the second either.

524
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:33,520
And this is to say nothing of the logic of the Giry's being here at all.

525
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:38,520
Who concealed him safe away? Smuggled him up to Calais?

526
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:45,520
We grafted Forsyth's weird plot onto old characters from the first show who have no reason to be here, so...

527
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,520
Give me the gun, Meg!

528
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,520
So this new version drops all of the new characters that Forsyth added,

529
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,520
like the priest, the reporter, and the evil Persian,

530
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,520
and hews closer to characters already established in the first show.

531
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,520
But not without keeping some key elements, like Christine's love child with the phantom.

532
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,520
And the whole runs a freak show despite having been held captive in a freak show,

533
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,520
but I guess it's a humane freak show now?

534
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,520
Hurt people hurt people, I guess.

535
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:13,520
And I'd be tempted to say that at least some of this was a good artistic move moving away from that book,

536
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,520
but the results, man...

537
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,520
You can face it. Yes!

538
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,520
You can take it. Yes!

539
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,520
Also, this show wants us to root for Eric and Christine.

540
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:29,520
And in earlier versions, apparently it didn't shy away as much from the fact that he was, you know, a murderer.

541
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:35,520
But in the final version, it has to totally ignore half of the first show to make its stupid romance work.

542
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,520
The juries treat him like he's just some guy.

543
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,520
You work for him!

544
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,520
Now you do too!

545
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,520
This man has killed several people.

546
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:49,520
Everyone just kind of politely ignores everything he did in the first one,

547
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,520
except for his fixation on Christine.

548
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,520
She chose road, chose to make a new start.

549
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:00,520
Chose beauty and youth over genius and art.

550
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:06,520
Or my favorite little writing detail, the one song that is repeated from the first show.

551
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:12,520
Twisted every way, what answer can I give?

552
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,520
I know I can't refuse, and yet I wish I could.

553
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:27,520
Here is that song from the first musical without that crucial line cut.

554
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,520
He kills without a thought, he murders or that's good.

555
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,520
I know I can't refuse.

556
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,520
Hmm, feels like that might be kind of a deal breaker.

557
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:49,520
So, let's be honest, the ending of this show is pretty hilarious.

558
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,520
Christine! Oh, it's Christine!

559
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,520
Oh, does Christine get killed?

560
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,520
Yes!

561
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,520
Oh!

562
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,520
Amazing! Amazing!

563
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,520
So what is the main tension of Love Never Dies?

564
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,520
Well, this verse is also same as the first.

565
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,520
What will become of the Phantom and Christine?

566
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,520
Who will she choose?

567
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,520
But that tension resolves after she sings her peacock dress, so the main plot is tied up.

568
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,520
But that doesn't end the story.

569
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
The random thing has to happen.

570
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,520
Gustav. What is it?

571
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,520
Gustav! What's wrong?

572
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,520
I told him to wait for Raoul.

573
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,520
Before he asked me to. Surely he wouldn't.

574
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,520
The Phantom never at any point interacts with Meg before the end of the show.

575
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,520
The Phantom at never any point interacted with Meg in the first show.

576
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,520
If a tragic thing happens at the end of a story, fine, great.

577
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,520
But it needs to both come out of and influence the actions of our protagonist.

578
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,520
And while, sure, Meg was in the show before this,

579
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:57,520
this isn't like some dad who never went to Timmy's baseball games and now Timmy's gone off the edge.

580
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,520
Always wondered how to make you want to watch me now.

581
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,520
We don't know anything about what their relationship even is.

582
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,520
We don't know how he treats her. For all we know, this is like a fatal attraction scenario.

583
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,520
But while you could argue that this was set up, sort of, like they tried to,

584
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,520
they can't bring themselves to make the Phantom legitimately fuck them over in order to get with Christine.

585
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,520
So this?

586
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:27,520
I took a little trip to Coney Island.

587
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,520
I took a little trip because of you.

588
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:38,520
Never makes sense. He never wrongs them in any way that we actually see.

589
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,520
I hope Christine is worthy of you.

590
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:48,520
I hope her singing makes up for what your blindness has done to Meg.

591
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,520
They just feel entitled to his stuff.

592
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:57,520
The Phantom pedestalizing Christine could, in a different story, lead to some kind of downfall,

593
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,520
but not here. Meg feels owed by him,

594
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,520
but the show never gives us any indication that her feelings are justified.

595
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:09,520
And either way, Meg is not, like, his ward. She's, like, at least 30.

596
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,520
Man, Sherry Lewis has got it going on.

597
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,520
In no universe is this man responsible for what she is doing right now,

598
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,520
and it's weird to imply that he is.

599
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,520
Give me the blame for not seeing the things that you've done, Meg.

600
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,520
This is some poetic, thematic culmination.

601
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,520
All his ghosts come back to haunt him.

602
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,520
There could have been a story where he throws all the people who helped him

603
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,520
when he very much did not deserve it under the bus because of his obsession with Christine,

604
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:41,520
but the show doesn't do that because it wants the audience to root for these crazy kids.

605
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,520
And I cannot overstate this.

606
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,520
This is a fundamentally unsalvageable relationship.

607
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,520
We should not be rooting for them.

608
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,520
In this very show, he threatened to murder a child.

609
00:37:52,520 --> 00:38:02,520
That perfect specimen may disappear on Coley Island.

610
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,520
You know what you do? You buy yourself a tape recorder,

611
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,520
you just record yourself for a whole day.

612
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,520
I think I'm going to be surprised at some of your phrasing.

613
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,520
And only walked it back when he realized the kid was actually his crotch dumpling.

614
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,520
He plays like me.

615
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,520
So the tragic ending isn't poetic.

616
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,520
It isn't the result of some mistake the Phantom actually made, and he has made many.

617
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,520
This isn't his past or his character flaws coming back to haunt him.

618
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,520
It's not him burning everything down if he can't get what he wants.

619
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,520
It's just a random thing.

620
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:40,520
You know, the funny thing about Empire Strikes Back when it first came out

621
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:45,520
is it was actually kind of met with mixed reviews from critics and even from fans.

622
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:51,520
And I think part of the reason for that is because people were so used to sequels

623
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,520
more or less kind of following the same pattern as first ones.

624
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:00,520
And the Empire Strikes Back is pretty different from the first Star Wars movie.

625
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:06,520
But it didn't take long for Empire Strikes Back to be re-evaluated as the good one.

626
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,520
Arguably the best one of all of the ones that have been produced.

627
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,520
And generally when you look at sequels that are seen as positively,

628
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,520
even maybe even better than the first one,

629
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,520
it's probably because they try new things.

630
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,520
They expand on the world.

631
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,520
They introduce new characters.

632
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,520
They take the story in a different direction.

633
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,520
Because presumably your characters have grown since that first story.

634
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,520
Phantom of the Opera ends with him letting Christine go.

635
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:39,520
And the reason that the musical is more compelling than most other versions

636
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,520
is because it's one of the only ones where that happens.

637
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:49,520
Where he voluntarily kind of sees the error of his ways and lets her go.

638
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:56,520
Why undo the thing that made your first show work in the first place?

639
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,520
So you could say that Love Never Dies is a story for the ages

640
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,520
about the need to recapture lightning in a bottle.

641
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,520
A story of being unable to let go of the past.

642
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:11,520
But at the same time I strain to think of this as a cynical lazy cash grab

643
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,520
in the vein of Men in Black 2.

644
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,520
It's just so, I don't know, sincere?

645
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,520
Andrew Lloyd Webber wanted this to work.

646
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,520
And moreover, you can't say that there was no care or passion here.

647
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,520
Just look at the costumes and the sets.

648
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:33,520
The costumes in particular are arguably better than the ones from Phantom of the Opera.

649
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:41,520
Because Phantom of the Opera 1 is so melodramatic and loud and high emotions,

650
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,520
and because I strain to see a scenario where a Phantom of the Opera sequel

651
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:51,520
that includes the Phantom and Christine doing the same shit they did in the first one,

652
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,520
not being a complete trash fire.

653
00:40:54,520 --> 00:41:01,520
I just, I can't imagine any sequel to that version of Phantom of the Opera

654
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,520
being anything but, just, you can't look away from it.

655
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,520
It is just going to inevitably be captivating.

656
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,520
It is baffling. It is bad from start to finish.

657
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,520
But it is also eminently watchable.

658
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,520
And for that, I can't say I hate it.

659
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,520
I love the shit out of Love Never Dies.

660
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,520
You might say my love for Love Never Dies never dies.

661
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,520
As you know, my single, my single is dropping, it's dropping.

662
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,520
But of course, there are also many Phantom sequels and retellings out there.

663
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,520
They don't necessarily have to take the form of a stage show.

664
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:43,520
My favorite sequel is a fanfic that was published by some mysterious author like 10 years ago.

665
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,520
There's books, and also, there's audiobooks.

666
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,520
Hi, did you know that this is not a conflict of interest?

667
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,520
I was surprised too.

668
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,520
But either way, I get to promote my new audiobook, Truth of the Divine,

669
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,520
by way of our sponsor, Audible.

670
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:05,520
A lot of people have asked, is Abigail Thorne from Philosophy Tube coming back for the sequel?

671
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,520
The answer to that is yes.

672
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,520
And best of all, you can get it for free if you visit audible.com

673
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:17,520
or text Lindsay Ellis to 500-500 and start your 30-day free trial today.

674
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,520
Audible members get one credit every month,

675
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,520
good for any title in the entire premium selection of bestsellers, new releases,

676
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,520
regardless of price, and you keep them forever.

677
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,520
Want to let a friend or relative know that you're thinking about them?

678
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,520
Share the gift of Audible with others.

679
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,520
This is actually the copy.

680
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,520
So they can be inspired, informed, or entertained.

681
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,520
No, I did not write that.

682
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:43,520
So visit audible.com slash Lindsay Ellis or text Lindsay Ellis to 500-500

683
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,520
to start your 30-day free trial.

684
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,520
And you can get both Axiom's End and Truth of the Divine,

685
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,520
which is out now on Audible,

686
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,520
or a hard copy wherever books are stoled.

687
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,520
