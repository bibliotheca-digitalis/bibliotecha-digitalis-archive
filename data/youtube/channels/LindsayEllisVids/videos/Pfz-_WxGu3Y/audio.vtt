00:00.000 --> 00:06.520
When Men in Black became a surprise hit in 1997, it didn't yet have a sequel greenlit, or even written.

00:06.640 --> 00:10.160
But that shouldn't have been a problem, right? Being based on a comic book?

00:10.160 --> 00:13.320
It's the sort of thing that should work well with serialization.

00:13.320 --> 00:18.080
If anything would lend itself to a franchise, it would be something like Men in Black.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.080
Going to get your gun back, huh?

00:20.600 --> 00:21.480
I like this gun.

00:21.480 --> 00:25.320
But here's the problem. Men in Black 1 was an origin story.

00:25.360 --> 00:29.720
The story of fish-out-of-water Agent J joining the eponymous organization.

00:29.920 --> 00:34.520
The end of the film set up a sequel, sure, but it promised a different plot and different characters.

00:34.880 --> 00:39.080
Agent J is no longer a greenhorn. Agent K, the mentor figure, has retired.

00:39.440 --> 00:45.040
Agent L is now the new recruit. So given this setup, what did they decide to do for the sequel?

00:45.520 --> 00:47.840
Okay, well, he's retired, right?

00:47.960 --> 00:54.760
Well, they retconned the ending of the first movie, slotting Will Smith's Agent J back into the position of clueless noob to recreate that

00:54.760 --> 00:57.120
sweet, sweet chemistry he had with Tommy Lee Jones.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.520
Agent L is clumsily written out.

00:59.520 --> 01:03.440
And plus, you can't count L. I mean, she wanted to go back to the morgue.

01:03.440 --> 01:04.520
I just, I helped her.

01:04.520 --> 01:09.920
Frank the Pug, who has a glorified cameo in the first movie, is now bumped up to lead character because fanservice.

01:09.920 --> 01:13.920
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face.

01:13.920 --> 01:16.160
And there's lots of these guys.

01:17.440 --> 01:18.720
That's gonna leave a scar.

01:18.720 --> 01:24.720
Men in Black 2 didn't build on what the first movie had set up. It just repeated its greatest hits.

01:25.320 --> 01:27.120
And everybody hated it.

01:27.120 --> 01:32.720
Any story can arguably, probably have a compelling sequel.

01:32.720 --> 01:38.320
But unless it's a sort of episodic thing, like a superhero franchise, where by design,

01:38.320 --> 01:43.520
it's more or less gonna have, like, the same conflict and characters each time,

01:43.520 --> 01:48.720
in order for it to be a satisfying story, it should probably be different from that first one.

01:48.720 --> 01:51.120
Expand on the world in some way.

01:51.120 --> 01:55.320
And if that is what you're here for, I have a sequel that's out today.

01:55.320 --> 01:59.920
It's called Truth of the Divine, it's a sequel to Axiom's End, and it is not the same.

01:59.920 --> 02:03.520
Say what you want about it, it's different from the first one.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.120
It is not Men in Black 2.

02:05.120 --> 02:08.720
There, I got my plug out of the way. Seriously, it's my one thing.

02:08.720 --> 02:15.920
You can buy it now, wherever books are sold, as long as you are in the US, UK, Canada, also English-speaking countries.

02:15.920 --> 02:17.920
I don't get any say on the foreign rank.

02:17.920 --> 02:24.320
But there are some stories that probably should just not have sequels.

02:32.320 --> 02:42.920
Love Never Dies is the result of a decades-long attempt to take a fundamentally unworkable story and make it work.

02:42.920 --> 02:48.520
This might also be the musical that was given the most chances of all big-budget musicals,

02:48.520 --> 02:54.520
with productions in Toronto, London, Australia, and even a world tour,

02:54.520 --> 03:00.520
which absolutely, yes, I went and saw, in the futile hope that audiences might take to it eventually.

03:00.520 --> 03:04.520
At least an oomph of the degree to which they did Phantom of the Opera.

03:04.520 --> 03:09.320
Phantom of the Opera is, by most meaningful metrics, the most successful musical of all time.

03:09.320 --> 03:15.320
It has played to over 140 million people in 35 countries and 166 cities around the world,

03:15.320 --> 03:18.120
with an estimated gross of $6 billion.

03:18.120 --> 03:23.120
It has played over 12,000 performances across 30 years at Her Majesty's Theatre in London alone,

03:23.120 --> 03:27.320
and is still the longest-running show on Broadway.

03:27.320 --> 03:28.120
Suck it.

03:28.120 --> 03:32.520
So just so we'll have a point of reference for what happens in Love Never Dies,

03:32.520 --> 03:37.520
here is a brief summary of the stage version of Phantom of the Opera.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.920
Phantom of the Opera!

03:41.920 --> 03:46.920
Phantom of the Opera is the story of Christine, a young ingenue who wows Paris

03:46.920 --> 03:50.120
after she falls into the role of surprise understudy

03:50.120 --> 03:54.720
after the prima donna is scared off performing by the Phantom of the Opera.

03:54.720 --> 04:00.120
After her gangbusters performance, we learn that Christine has been getting voice lessons from a mysterious tutor,

04:00.120 --> 04:04.320
which her friend and extremely minor character Meg remarks upon.

04:04.320 --> 04:13.120
I hear your voice in the darkness, yet the words aren't yours.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.720
Remember Meg.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.720
We'll come back to Meg.

04:16.720 --> 04:20.120
So it turns out her secret mentor is actually that Phantom,

04:20.120 --> 04:24.320
a supposed ghost who is actually a guy who's not only been extorting the managers,

04:24.320 --> 04:27.720
but also screwing with the cast because it's fun and he hates the prima donna.

04:27.720 --> 04:32.520
But this is a sexy Phantom C, and he's in love with her, and she's kind of into it,

04:32.520 --> 04:37.520
but she's also kind of into her old flame Raoul, who is also rich and a vicomte.

04:37.520 --> 04:44.320
So Raoul becomes the obvious choice once Christine sees the reason for his phantom-y ways, namely his face.

04:44.320 --> 04:47.320
Hijinks and a love triangle ensue, the Phantom kills a few people,

04:47.320 --> 04:51.920
and after basically taking the entire opera house hostage and forcing them to perform his opera,

04:51.920 --> 04:58.920
Christine unmasks him on stage and he kidnaps her,

04:58.920 --> 05:02.920
and the show ends with Raoul trying to rescue her but getting captured immediately,

05:02.920 --> 05:06.920
after which the Phantom demands that Christine marry him or Raoul dies.

05:06.920 --> 05:10.120
But when Christine shows him a moment of compassion and kisses him,

05:10.120 --> 05:14.320
he realizes what an asshole he's been the whole show, and he lets the two of them go,

05:14.320 --> 05:17.920
wishes them mazel, and an angry mob shows up, but he escapes,

05:17.920 --> 05:22.120
and that extremely minor character, Meg, remember her,

05:22.120 --> 05:27.320
picks up his mask and holds it up as the spotlight focuses on it, and the show ends.

05:35.320 --> 05:42.720
Love Never Dies is the story of the Phantom having apparently learned no lessons,

05:42.720 --> 05:48.720
still obsessing over Christine and plotting to lure and extort her into marrying him again.

05:48.720 --> 05:53.520
Only he succeeds in his endeavor this time, but then he has to negotiate a hostage crisis,

05:53.520 --> 05:55.720
which ends in Christine getting shot.

06:00.320 --> 06:03.520
Or Love Never Dies is the story of Christine,

06:03.520 --> 06:07.520
trapped in a loveless marriage to a negligent alcoholic gambling addict,

06:07.520 --> 06:12.520
reconnecting with the serial killer who loved her and also kidnapped her ten years ago,

06:12.520 --> 06:15.520
and deciding that he's actually the lesser of two evils,

06:15.520 --> 06:19.520
until she gets shot by a former friend in a completely unrelated hostage crisis.

06:23.520 --> 06:26.720
Or Love Never Dies is the story of Meg Giry,

06:26.720 --> 06:30.720
whose mother dragged her across the ocean to Coney Island to work for the murderer

06:30.720 --> 06:34.920
who'd been extorting the Paris Opera for some reason,

06:34.920 --> 06:38.920
and who has been dying for said murderous extortionist's approval?

06:39.320 --> 06:45.320
I was suddenly aware of a presence in the air, and I knew it was him.

06:45.320 --> 06:51.320
Until one day when she realizes that he's never going to choose her over her former friend he's still obsessed with,

06:51.320 --> 06:55.320
she kidnaps said friend's child with the apparent intention of doing a murder-suicide,

06:55.320 --> 06:59.320
but ends up accidentally shooting her old friend instead.

07:05.320 --> 07:08.320
It is perfect. I wouldn't change anything.

07:08.320 --> 07:14.320
So there are some variations on this show's plot because they kept revising it and revising it,

07:14.320 --> 07:21.320
trying to make it work, but I'm just going to summarize the nightmare that is most readily available.

07:21.320 --> 07:26.720
The 2011 Melbourne production filmed for broadcast ten years ago.

07:30.720 --> 07:34.720
It's a decade after the events of the first musical, and if you're wondering what he's been up to

07:35.120 --> 07:38.120
and how his life has pivoted in a new exciting direction,

07:38.120 --> 07:43.120
well, he's still whining and obsessing over Christine Daae in song form.

07:47.120 --> 07:49.120
Just milking the giant cow to her portrait,

07:49.120 --> 07:55.120
which is better than the West End version where he was doing it to a real doll.

07:55.520 --> 08:03.520
But wake, only nothing but the cold.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.520
Oh, Ramin, why?

08:05.520 --> 08:09.520
We then cut to Coney Island where Alan Cumming, Harley Quinn, and Uncle Fester introduce us to

08:09.520 --> 08:14.520
The Vibe, which I guess could be described as Cirque du Soleil by way of Tim Burton,

08:14.520 --> 08:16.520
but not like, you know, good Tim Burton,

08:16.520 --> 08:21.520
more like Disney whipped out a boatload of money to make Dumbo because what else is he gonna do, Tim Burton?

08:21.520 --> 08:24.520
Let's get ready for Dumbo!

08:24.920 --> 08:28.920
So this is the Phantom's show, fairground, whatever,

08:28.920 --> 08:31.920
and he's rebranded himself as Mr. Y.

08:31.920 --> 08:38.920
Mr. Y welcomes you to Phantasma!

08:38.920 --> 08:41.920
And we learn that Meg Giri, remember her,

08:41.920 --> 08:44.920
the ballerina with like ten lines from the first show,

08:44.920 --> 08:48.920
is now the star of Mr. Y's sideshow through a song she performs.

08:49.320 --> 08:53.320
If it's marvel and illusion that your soul and body crave,

08:53.320 --> 08:56.320
you'll be leaving here content without a doubt!

08:56.320 --> 09:04.320
Also, in-universe, the Phantom writes all of the songs for everything that happens under the Mr. Y umbrella,

09:04.320 --> 09:06.320
so the Phantom wrote this.

09:06.320 --> 09:10.320
Such a show you've never seen, such a show there's never been,

09:10.320 --> 09:13.320
and today's not brand-new!

09:13.320 --> 09:18.320
Anyway, she finishes the song, runs backstage to her mom, Madam Giri, who is also here,

09:18.720 --> 09:22.720
and is like, I hope Phantom Senpai notices me because everybody wants to fuck this asshole now!

09:22.720 --> 09:25.720
And mom is like, no, Senpai is never going to notice you, sweetie.

09:25.720 --> 09:30.720
And then we get an exposition dump explaining how the Giri smuggled the Phantom out of France

09:30.720 --> 09:34.720
and went with him to New York for...

09:34.720 --> 09:36.720
I'm sure a very good reason.

09:36.720 --> 09:39.720
Who concealed him safe away?

09:39.720 --> 09:42.720
Smuggled him up to Calais?

09:42.720 --> 09:44.720
Found a freighter out of France?

09:44.720 --> 09:47.720
We never learn it, but I'm sure it makes perfect sense.

09:48.120 --> 09:53.120
Meg learns Christine is coming to New York and the audience is also reminded that Meg and Christine were friends at one point.

09:53.120 --> 09:57.120
Meg is nostalgic, Madam Giri is like, oh no, I don't like this.

09:57.120 --> 10:01.120
I don't see the problem, this is ancient history.

10:03.120 --> 10:07.120
The Phantom shows up randomly in Lears to remind the audience that there are Phantoms in this Phantom.

10:07.120 --> 10:13.120
We then cut to a dock in New York and Christine Daae serving real Kate Winslet in Titanic realness.

10:13.120 --> 10:17.120
We learn that she and Raoul are married and have a kid named Gustav,

10:17.520 --> 10:21.520
but the money's tight because Raoul, turns out, is a gambler and an alcoholic.

10:21.520 --> 10:26.520
Oh yeah, and our art is paying off your gambling debts is what they're saying in France.

10:26.520 --> 10:31.520
And he drank away all their money, just like in all the fanfics.

10:31.520 --> 10:36.520
Father dear, come play with me, come and see this toy I've got.

10:36.520 --> 10:38.520
What a snob at most.

10:38.520 --> 10:43.520
I can't explain it, but it was just a weirdly popular fanfic trope back in 2002.

10:43.920 --> 10:49.920
And I guess Andrew Lloyd Webber spent some time on fanfiction.net.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.920
AO3 didn't exist yet.

10:51.920 --> 10:55.920
Is it true you left your entire fortune on a roulette table in Monte Carlo?

10:55.920 --> 10:58.920
How am I supposed to feel in this moment?

10:58.920 --> 11:01.920
Ganja, I didn't want to make it that everybody was attacking you.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.920
You insolent jackals, how dare you?

11:03.920 --> 11:05.920
I feel very attacked!

11:05.920 --> 11:07.920
Relax, relax.

11:08.920 --> 11:12.920
So Christine is here at the invitation of Oscar Hammerstein and Raoul is a bad dad.

11:13.320 --> 11:16.320
Doesn't he love me?

11:16.320 --> 11:18.320
No, he does not.

11:18.320 --> 11:21.320
So Uncle Fester, Alan Cumming, and Harley Quinn show up in the Nightmare Mobile

11:21.320 --> 11:23.320
and they take the fam to the hotel.

11:23.320 --> 11:29.320
While Raoul drinks some more and Christine sings a very thinly veiled number about how she clearly made the wrong choice.

11:29.320 --> 11:33.320
Gustav goes to bed and then who breaks down the door like the Kool-Aid man?

11:34.320 --> 11:36.320
Oh yeah!

11:36.320 --> 11:37.320
And then...

11:37.720 --> 11:47.720
Once there was a light beneath a moonless sky.

11:47.720 --> 11:49.720
Okay, so how do I explain this?

11:49.720 --> 11:53.720
And I touched you.

11:53.720 --> 11:55.720
And I felt you.

11:55.720 --> 11:59.720
And I heard those ravishing replays.

11:59.720 --> 12:05.720
This is basically like an 8 minute dirge about how at the end of the last show,

12:06.120 --> 12:08.120
after Christine escaped with Raoul,

12:08.120 --> 12:13.120
she immediately came right back to the Phantom to confess her love.

12:13.120 --> 12:15.120
They have sex.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.120
Despite his virgin status,

12:17.120 --> 12:20.120
he hits it and quits it like 30 times in one night.

12:20.120 --> 12:25.120
Again and again and again.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.120
Stamina.

12:27.120 --> 12:29.120
Stamina.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.120
And I held you.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.120
And I touched you.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.120
And embraced you.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.120
And I felt you.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.520
And I caught you.

12:35.520 --> 12:36.520
And I kissed you.

12:36.520 --> 12:37.520
And I took you.

12:37.520 --> 12:39.520
And I begged you with a knee.

12:39.520 --> 12:41.520
To urge you to deny.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.520
8 minutes.

12:43.520 --> 12:46.520
Again and again and again.

12:46.520 --> 12:51.520
Cosmopolitan's top 10 positions to try beneath a moonless sky.

12:51.520 --> 12:57.520
So then after that 8 minutes, they move to the balcony and have another 5 minute ballad about nothing.

12:57.520 --> 12:59.520
And then Gustav shows up.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.520
And we get this amazing reaction shot.

13:01.920 --> 13:04.920
Oh, shh, Gustav, it's alright, darling.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.920
And because the Phantom is an asshole, he Michael Jackson's the kid,

13:09.920 --> 13:15.920
and then threatens to disappear the child if Christine doesn't perform at his side show.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.920
Why does he wear a mask, mother?

13:17.920 --> 13:19.920
Is he a magician?

13:19.920 --> 13:22.920
Yes, darling. In his way.

13:22.920 --> 13:24.920
He's an asshole.

13:24.920 --> 13:26.920
And so she's like, okay.

13:26.920 --> 13:29.920
But then she reads it and she's like, oh boy, but his music is just so good.

13:30.320 --> 13:33.320
So then we get to the notes portion of the show,

13:33.320 --> 13:37.320
which is basically just a carbon copy of the same thing in the original show.

13:45.320 --> 13:48.320
In this version, Christine, Raoul, Meg, and Madame Jury reconnect.

13:48.320 --> 13:51.320
They all kind of figure out what's going on.

13:51.320 --> 13:55.320
Meg goes single, white, female, learning that Christine is there to sing on the Phantom's invite.

13:55.720 --> 13:59.720
Raoul realizes that them coming to America was a ruse engineered by the Phantom.

13:59.720 --> 14:01.720
It's him.

14:01.720 --> 14:02.720
Him.

14:02.720 --> 14:03.720
That's what I said.

14:03.720 --> 14:05.720
You work for him.

14:05.720 --> 14:06.720
Now you do too.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.720
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

14:11.720 --> 14:14.720
And everyone's fine with it, I guess.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.720
No one is going to bring up that he killed people.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.720
So Christine is doing what the Phantom asked,

14:18.720 --> 14:23.720
but he lures the child to his lair at the base of a roller coaster anyway

14:24.120 --> 14:26.120
to his, I guess, doom.

14:26.120 --> 14:29.120
But then the kid starts playing chopsticks on his piano

14:29.120 --> 14:33.120
and the Phantom starts doing middle school punnett squares in his head like,

14:33.120 --> 14:35.120
oh my, a virtuoso.

14:35.120 --> 14:38.120
And he makes this connection.

14:38.120 --> 14:43.120
He's just ten years old.

14:43.120 --> 14:50.120
Ten years old.

14:50.520 --> 14:53.520
And then...

14:59.520 --> 15:01.520
You can feel it.

15:01.520 --> 15:02.520
Yes.

15:02.520 --> 15:03.520
Come closer.

15:03.520 --> 15:04.520
Yes.

15:04.520 --> 15:07.520
Have no fear of the beauty underneath.

15:07.520 --> 15:09.520
You can face it.

15:09.520 --> 15:10.520
Yes.

15:10.520 --> 15:11.520
You can take it.

15:11.520 --> 15:12.520
Yes.

15:12.520 --> 15:15.520
Can we please stop talking to the ten year old like that, please?

15:15.520 --> 15:17.520
You'll accept it.

15:17.520 --> 15:18.520
Yes.

15:18.520 --> 15:19.520
You'll embrace it.

15:19.520 --> 15:20.520
Yes.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.520
I don't think you like it.

15:21.520 --> 15:22.520
Well, why not?

15:22.520 --> 15:25.520
I like this new generation of music.

15:25.520 --> 15:26.520
You'll accept it.

15:26.520 --> 15:27.520
Yes.

15:27.520 --> 15:28.520
You'll embrace it.

15:28.520 --> 15:29.520
Yes.

15:29.520 --> 15:30.520
Let me show you.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.520
Mother of God, it's all toilet sounds.

15:32.520 --> 15:33.520
Yes.

15:33.520 --> 15:37.520
Let me show you the beauty of God.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.520
So it turns out Gustav can't take the beauty underneath.

15:40.520 --> 15:44.520
So the Phantom does the same heel face turn he does at the end of the first show

15:44.520 --> 15:46.520
and just kind of accepts it and lets him go.

15:46.520 --> 15:51.520
Only where in the first show, his change of heart is precipitated by Christine showing

15:51.520 --> 15:53.520
him compassion and making out with him.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.520
In this show, it's precipitated by nothing.

15:56.520 --> 16:00.520
The kid screams at his horrible deformity, showing that no, actually, I don't accept

16:00.520 --> 16:01.520
you no matter what.

16:01.520 --> 16:05.520
And the Phantom takes from this, oh man, I was being a huge asshole again, wasn't I?

16:05.520 --> 16:08.520
And then Christine is just suddenly there and he's like, oh, silly me being an asshole

16:08.520 --> 16:09.520
again.

16:09.520 --> 16:10.520
My bad.

16:10.520 --> 16:11.520
You guys can go.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.520
Just don't tell your kid I'm actually his dad.

16:13.520 --> 16:16.520
And she's like, no, sir, I honor my contracts.

16:16.520 --> 16:18.520
I am nothing if not a professional.

16:18.520 --> 16:21.520
And I will sing your music because she needs to beef up her LinkedIn.

16:21.520 --> 16:25.520
And so she leaves and the Phantom, again, precipitated by nothing, is like, I will give

16:25.520 --> 16:29.520
everything I have to this miracle child who can play heart and soul.

16:29.520 --> 16:30.520
And then he leaves.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.520
And then the real villain shows up.

16:32.520 --> 16:42.520
And it's Madame Jury, who is angry because she seems to have expected to inherit his

16:42.520 --> 16:43.520
wealth.

16:43.520 --> 16:47.520
Ten dark years of toil and tears.

16:47.520 --> 16:52.520
And now what we've worked for will go to that child.

16:52.520 --> 16:55.520
Even though they appear to be about the same age.

16:55.520 --> 16:57.520
And that's the end of Act One.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.520
Please clap.

16:59.520 --> 17:03.520
So here is where we begin Act Two, where love never dies bucks musical theater tradition

17:03.520 --> 17:09.520
by trading off a rousing, high energy act opener that gets you invested and gets the

17:09.520 --> 17:12.520
blood pumping with this.

17:18.520 --> 17:19.520
One more.

17:19.520 --> 17:22.520
Buddy, don't you think you had enough?

17:22.520 --> 17:24.520
All right.

17:24.520 --> 17:26.520
One more drink, sir.

17:26.520 --> 17:27.520
That's what I need.

17:27.520 --> 17:29.520
Don't you think so?

17:29.520 --> 17:35.520
So here's day drunk Raoul sitting at a bar giving us low tempo B side of a mid 2000s

17:35.520 --> 17:39.520
Tom Waits album energy, complete with a boozy saxophone.

17:39.520 --> 17:46.520
Beneath this mask I wear, there's nothing of me.

17:46.520 --> 17:51.520
Why does she love me?

17:51.520 --> 17:52.520
She does not.

17:52.520 --> 17:57.520
Then Meg just shows up and establishes that she likes the ocean and its inherent eroticism

17:57.520 --> 18:02.520
and how sometimes she just has thoughts about, I don't know, walking straight into it.

18:02.520 --> 18:09.520
Sink into the sea, blue and cool and kind.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.520
Then we get to this.

18:11.520 --> 18:14.520
He's just another circus freak.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.520
I'm not afraid of him.

18:16.520 --> 18:17.520
Surprise, bitch.

18:17.520 --> 18:21.520
So this dick waving contest happens and the Phantom and Raoul waste no time going behind

18:21.520 --> 18:23.520
Christine's back to make a bet.

18:23.520 --> 18:28.520
If she doesn't sing the song, the Phantom will then go and pay off their debts.

18:28.520 --> 18:31.520
And if she does, then she belongs to him.

18:31.520 --> 18:33.520
She walks.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.520
You leave together.

18:35.520 --> 18:36.520
Pockets full.

18:36.520 --> 18:38.520
Debts paid.

18:38.520 --> 18:41.520
She sings.

18:41.520 --> 18:44.520
You leave alone.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.520
Whatever that means.

18:45.520 --> 18:48.520
And if you thought Christine lacked agency in the first show, well.

18:48.520 --> 18:52.520
So Raoul is an idiot and agrees, because we need to add stakes and there's like 45 minutes

18:52.520 --> 18:54.520
left in this show and still no plot.

18:54.520 --> 18:57.520
Then absolutely nothing happens between the bet and the culmination of the bet.

18:57.520 --> 18:59.520
Well, except for this.

18:59.520 --> 19:02.520
Bathing Beauty on the beach.

19:02.520 --> 19:05.520
Bathing Beauty, say hello.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.520
Again, in-universe, the Phantom wrote this.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.520
And after we're done, Meg's like,

19:10.520 --> 19:11.520
No!

19:11.520 --> 19:12.520
No!

19:12.520 --> 19:15.520
What, he didn't watch me sing Bathing Beauty's?

19:15.520 --> 19:16.520
I had quick change.

19:16.520 --> 19:19.520
All that you gave him has all been a waste.

19:19.520 --> 19:22.520
All that you've done, it has all been erased.

19:22.520 --> 19:25.520
Anyway, on to the culmination of that riveting drunken bet.

19:25.520 --> 19:29.520
Gustaf's like, Mom, I love you, as she looks into the middle distance longing for death.

19:29.520 --> 19:33.520
Raoul shows up, begs Christine not to sing, and gives enough of a rat's ass to comb his

19:33.520 --> 19:37.520
hair and wear a coat for once, but of course does not tell her what he did.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.520
Don't sing the song, dear.

19:39.520 --> 19:40.520
What?

19:40.520 --> 19:43.520
You have to know something's terribly wrong, dear.

19:43.520 --> 19:47.520
Someone drove a hotdog-shaped car through the window!

19:47.520 --> 19:49.520
Come on, whoever did this, just confess.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.520
We promise we won't be mad.

19:51.520 --> 19:54.520
Then the Phantom shows up and does a Billy Zane, the Duke in Moulin Rouge necklace scene

19:54.520 --> 19:57.520
to assert his natural dominance.

19:57.520 --> 20:02.520
Only in those scenes where the necklace functions as a metaphorical collar, chaining them to

20:02.520 --> 20:07.520
a rich guy that they do not love, here we're supposed to root for this guy?

20:07.520 --> 20:18.520
Let me hear you sing once more!

20:18.520 --> 20:22.520
Is it because Kate Winslet is going to pick Billy Zane this time?

20:22.520 --> 20:30.520
Our hero?

20:30.520 --> 20:36.520
Consummate professional that she is, she dresses up in her iconic peacock, the symbol of...

20:36.520 --> 20:37.520
I don't know.

20:37.520 --> 20:45.520
And she sings the song.

20:45.520 --> 20:49.520
So then Raoul peaces out, and the scene that all the cat moms in the audience have been

20:49.520 --> 20:51.520
waiting for for 30 years, the...

20:51.520 --> 20:54.520
No wait, there's still another 15 minutes.

20:54.520 --> 20:55.520
Gustav.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.520
What is it?

20:56.520 --> 20:57.520
Gustav!

20:57.520 --> 20:58.520
What's wrong?

20:58.520 --> 20:59.520
I told him to wait for Raoul!

20:59.520 --> 21:00.520
Oh no, where's Gustav?

21:00.520 --> 21:02.520
That jealous Madame Giry must have taken him.

21:02.520 --> 21:05.520
Anyway, Madame Giry wasn't the real villain of the show.

21:05.520 --> 21:06.520
It was Meg.

21:06.520 --> 21:07.520
Yo, what is that?

21:07.520 --> 21:08.520
A tattoo.

21:08.520 --> 21:09.520
It's my old high school team.

21:09.520 --> 21:10.520
The Plainview Red Herrings.

21:10.520 --> 21:11.520
Look at it swim.

21:11.520 --> 21:18.520
Who has now kidnapped Gustav, and is about to toss him and herself off a pier because

21:18.520 --> 21:21.520
she's just so lonely, and Senpai won't notice her.

21:21.520 --> 21:27.520
Always wondered how to make you watch, well watch me now!

21:27.520 --> 21:31.520
And the Phantom only wants Christine, even though Meg has ostensibly been forced into

21:31.520 --> 21:33.520
sex work to raise funds for him?

21:33.520 --> 21:35.520
Dot dot dot question mark.

21:35.520 --> 21:38.520
I gave what they would take.

21:38.520 --> 21:41.520
I gave what they would take.

21:41.520 --> 21:43.520
I gave it for your sake.

21:43.520 --> 21:48.520
So the whole gang shows up and tries to talk Meg down, and then Meg throws them the child

21:48.520 --> 21:49.520
bit.

21:49.520 --> 21:51.520
Oh shit, look out, she's got a gun!

21:51.520 --> 21:53.520
No, Meg, don't!

21:53.520 --> 21:58.520
So this show ends with the Phantom of the Opera negotiating a hostage crisis.

21:58.520 --> 22:01.520
Give me the gun, Meg.

22:01.520 --> 22:04.520
Give me the gun, said the Phantom of the Opera.

22:04.520 --> 22:09.520
The Phantom then deploys his hostage negotiation skills, which aren't that sharp, turns out.

22:09.520 --> 22:11.520
He says this.

22:11.520 --> 22:17.520
We can't all be like Christine.

22:17.520 --> 22:18.520
Christine?

22:18.520 --> 22:20.520
Oh, it's Christine!

22:23.520 --> 22:28.520
So Christine dies, but at least the Phantom gets a consolation child.

22:29.520 --> 22:34.520
Boy and man hug, kid's okay with his face now, apparently, even though his mother just

22:34.520 --> 22:36.520
bled out in front of him.

22:36.520 --> 22:39.520
Raoul just stands there with Christine's corpse.

22:39.520 --> 22:44.520
And I cannot wait for the CBS sitcom around these two and a half men.

22:44.520 --> 22:47.520
The end.

22:47.520 --> 22:50.520
So...

22:50.520 --> 22:52.520
Why is this?

22:52.520 --> 23:01.520
In a post-Phantom world in the late 80s, early 90s, you have all these Broadway producers

23:01.520 --> 23:03.520
trying to replicate Phantom's success.

23:03.520 --> 23:06.520
Oh, God!

23:06.520 --> 23:08.520
Oh!

23:08.520 --> 23:15.520
From Disney's Beauty and the Beast, to Miss Saigon, to that one Batman cover.

23:15.520 --> 23:19.520
But there was also the possibility of film adaptations for Phantom itself.

23:19.520 --> 23:24.520
In 1989, Warner Brothers buys the movie rights and Grand Central Lloyd Webber total artistic

23:24.520 --> 23:29.520
control, and Lord Andy handpicks a young Joel Schumacher to direct the film, based on how

23:29.520 --> 23:33.520
much he enjoyed the vampire film The Lost Boys.

23:33.520 --> 23:37.520
Anyway, shooting is set to go, with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman reprising their

23:37.520 --> 23:38.520
roles.

23:38.520 --> 23:40.520
But then...

23:40.520 --> 23:44.520
Andrew Lloyd Webber and Sarah Brightman divorce in 1990.

23:45.520 --> 23:49.520
Not long after the divorce, Lord Andy and Phantom designer Maria Bjornsson were having

23:49.520 --> 23:52.520
conversations about what a Phantom sequel would look like.

23:52.520 --> 23:56.520
Webber wanted it to take place in Manhattan, with said Phantom living in New York's first

23:56.520 --> 24:00.520
penthouse, but changed his mind after watching a documentary about the Brooklyn Beach and

24:00.520 --> 24:04.520
Fairground and thought, hey, how about Coney Island?

24:04.520 --> 24:08.520
So then he has dinner with Frederick Forsythe.

24:08.520 --> 24:11.520
Now, Frederick Forsythe is a name you might be familiar with.

24:11.520 --> 24:15.520
He's a best-selling thriller author from England, and Brexit supporter, who is still publishing

24:15.520 --> 24:17.520
books as recently as 2018.

24:17.520 --> 24:21.520
So I guess you could see where a man who makes his career writing thriller mysteries from

24:21.520 --> 24:26.520
a journalistic bent would make him a natural fit for writing a sequel to Phantom.

24:26.520 --> 24:31.520
So Lord Andy goes up to Frederick Forsythe and tells him, okay, so I'm going to unofficially

24:31.520 --> 24:36.520
commission you to write my Phantom sequel, and I want you to include this, this, this,

24:36.520 --> 24:40.520
and this, and set it mostly at Coney Island.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.520
And Frederick Forsythe is like, okay.

24:42.520 --> 24:44.520
And he writes this concept.

24:44.520 --> 24:48.520
And then he finishes it, and he brings it to Lord Andy, and Lord Andy is like,

24:48.520 --> 24:50.520
huh.

24:52.520 --> 24:56.520
I guess you sure did give me what I asked for.

24:56.520 --> 25:02.520
Okay, so in order to understand why Love Never Dies is the way it is, I am going to need

25:02.520 --> 25:08.520
to give you a plot summary of Frederick Forsythe's The Phantom of Manhattan.

25:09.520 --> 25:14.520
So in Phantom of Manhattan, Eric is an impresario millionaire in New York City, having worked

25:14.520 --> 25:19.520
his way up from Coney Island engineer in a clown mask, building roller coasters, to owning

25:19.520 --> 25:20.520
half the city.

25:20.520 --> 25:24.520
He has accomplished this by being a super genius, and also teaming up with this random

25:24.520 --> 25:32.520
Persian sidekick named Darius, who worships Mamun, the god of gold, who is real.

25:32.520 --> 25:38.520
And Mamun has granted Eric powers, and good fortune to achieve millionarity.

25:38.520 --> 25:44.520
Now Eric wants to open a new opera house in New York City, but gasp, so does Esker Hammerstein.

25:44.520 --> 25:45.520
What bad timing.

25:45.520 --> 25:50.520
And he has actual historical soprano Melba as his prima donna, so what's Eric going

25:50.520 --> 25:51.520
to do?

25:51.520 --> 25:54.520
The only way he can make sure his opera is a winner in the great opera house race is

25:54.520 --> 25:57.520
to bring Christine over from Europe to be his prima donna.

25:57.520 --> 26:01.520
Eric has written an opera about a disfigured war veteran that he wants Christine to star

26:01.520 --> 26:02.520
in.

26:02.520 --> 26:06.520
He will conveniently switch places with the bandaged-faced vet to sing with her, and there's

26:06.520 --> 26:10.520
also conveniently a child role that her son will get to take later too.

26:10.520 --> 26:13.520
Also, in this version, her son's name is Pierre.

26:13.520 --> 26:17.520
We know from the beginning of the book that Christine's son can't be Raoul's, because

26:17.520 --> 26:25.520
before they ever even met, Raoul got his dick shot off by performing a heroic deed in Paris.

26:25.520 --> 26:29.520
And everyone was so sad for him, thinking no woman would ever want to marry him, but

26:30.520 --> 26:35.520
lucky for him, Christine got knocked up by guess who, and she needs a husband, everybody

26:35.520 --> 26:36.520
wins.

26:36.520 --> 26:41.520
So Raoul is actually super sweet and self-sacrificing in this book, if a bit of a dullard, and he

26:41.520 --> 26:45.520
can't speak English, so he spends the whole book being confused and French.

26:45.520 --> 26:49.520
As they come over from Europe, the boy has a tutor who is an Irish priest who has literal

26:49.520 --> 26:51.520
conversations with God.

26:51.520 --> 26:55.520
Much of the narration is done by a smarmy New York City reporter who's getting the

26:55.520 --> 26:59.520
scoop on the opera house race, as well as narration from the Irish priest, Eric's

26:59.520 --> 27:03.520
evil sidekick, and a random street urchin character?

27:03.520 --> 27:08.520
And of course Eric himself, who begins the book explaining why Gaston Leroux was a hack

27:08.520 --> 27:12.520
idiot, and Andrew Lloyd Webber was the correct version, actually.

27:12.520 --> 27:17.520
Looking at his original text today, frankly one is in a quandary.

27:17.520 --> 27:23.520
The basic idea is there, and it is brilliant, but the way poor Gaston tells it is a mess.

27:23.520 --> 27:29.520
Much more bewildering, Leroux tells his entire story without ever giving a date when it happened.

27:29.520 --> 27:35.520
For an investigative reporter, which he purports to be, this is a bizarre omission.

27:35.520 --> 27:41.520
But far and away the most bizarre departure by Leroux from even the most basic rules of

27:41.520 --> 27:47.520
investigation and reporting is his end of book seduction by a mysterious character known

27:47.520 --> 27:49.520
only as the Persian.

27:49.520 --> 27:54.520
This strange mountebank is briefly mentioned twice in the first two thirds of the story,

27:54.520 --> 27:56.520
and in a most passing manner.

27:56.520 --> 27:57.520
Yet after the abduction of-

27:57.520 --> 28:01.520
He appears also to have made an error with the position, appearance, and intelligence

28:01.520 --> 28:05.520
of Madame Giry, and they were corrected in the Lloyd Webber musical.

28:05.520 --> 28:11.520
This is the story of the Lloyd Webber musical, and it is the only one to make sense.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.520
What do you think?

28:13.520 --> 28:15.520
It stinks.

28:15.520 --> 28:21.520
When Christine arrives, Eric sends a monkey music box, because this is a sequel to the musical,

28:21.520 --> 28:25.520
to her hotel, which she immediately recognizes and realizes what's going on.

28:25.520 --> 28:29.520
Eric invites her to a Coney Island maze of mirrors to tell her what's up and confesses his love.

28:29.520 --> 28:31.520
I love you, bitch.

28:31.520 --> 28:32.520
Oh my god.

28:32.520 --> 28:35.520
I ain't gonna never stop loving you, bitch.

28:35.520 --> 28:37.520
She flees, hijinks ensue.

28:37.520 --> 28:42.520
Eventually the opera opens, and they perform his opera, and it's so romantic.

28:42.520 --> 28:47.520
The priest and the reporter characters are trying to figure out what's going on with the evil Persian sidekick,

28:47.520 --> 28:53.520
and then after the opera, this evil Persian sidekick invites Christine to the park so he can kill her,

28:53.520 --> 28:57.520
or maybe just lure Eric there to kill him, because he's evil like that.

28:57.520 --> 29:01.520
But his reason is because Eric has forsaken his worship of mamal,

29:01.520 --> 29:05.520
which in Farsi actually means mother.

29:07.520 --> 29:10.520
And the sidekick must kill the non-believer or something.

29:10.520 --> 29:16.520
Anyway, Christine dies, Eric kills his sidekick, they tell the kid Eric is his dad,

29:16.520 --> 29:21.520
Raoul's very cool about this, the Irish priest is chill, the reporter gets his scoop,

29:21.520 --> 29:26.520
and then Eric lives happily ever after with his son in, like, this deformed people's community.

29:26.520 --> 29:28.520
The end.

29:28.520 --> 29:34.520
So although Lord Andy was not interested in pursuing the sequel stage show at first,

29:34.520 --> 29:37.520
he never really lets the idea go.

29:37.520 --> 29:42.520
Rather emboldened by the 2004 movie's... success?

29:42.520 --> 29:45.520
Steep as hell!

29:45.520 --> 29:48.520
Existence? What do you even call this? I don't know.

29:48.520 --> 29:54.520
In a Daily Mail interview from 2007, Webber confirmed that the stage sequel is still on his mind.

29:54.520 --> 30:02.520
It's taken me ten years to decide to do this, and I want to base it on the ideas I had with Freddy Forsythe years ago

30:02.520 --> 30:06.520
for something called The Phantom of Manhattan that came out as a book.

30:06.520 --> 30:12.520
There are various things in the plotting that I'm not very happy with, and I think I've solved them.

30:12.520 --> 30:17.520
I hope we can sort them out, but I'm really pretty buzzed up about it.

30:17.520 --> 30:23.520
So in 2007, Lloyd Webber approaches friend, previous collaborator, and successful playwright-slash-screenwriter Ben Elton

30:23.520 --> 30:27.520
We have a lot in common. I think we're like Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland.

30:27.520 --> 30:31.520
We want to do the show right now. I don't know which is which. I don't know who's got the better legs.

30:31.520 --> 30:35.520
to rework the ideas that Webber and Forsythe had developed a decade earlier.

30:35.520 --> 30:38.520
And then he decides that the real problem is...

30:38.520 --> 30:42.520
It was he who found the way through the roadblock.

30:42.520 --> 30:47.520
He pointed out that my first thoughts for a new plot contained several new characters.

30:47.520 --> 30:53.520
Ben suggested that any continuation of the story must be about the protagonists of the original show.

30:53.520 --> 31:01.520
So the new characters were axed, and Gustav Christine's son is the only new principal character we meet.

31:01.520 --> 31:09.520
Come the autumn of 2007, Ben had shaped a story that I felt I could make work.

31:09.520 --> 31:10.520
Oh.

31:10.520 --> 31:13.520
Give me the gun, Meg!

31:13.520 --> 31:17.520
So they kept more or less the same tension in Antagonist,

31:17.520 --> 31:24.520
and just searched to replace the evil Persian with Madame and Meg Giry.

31:24.520 --> 31:29.520
Well, I guess that makes sense. Madame Giry replaced the original Persian in the original show,

31:29.520 --> 31:32.520
so why can't she just replace the evil Persian too?

31:32.520 --> 31:36.520
So they set it up where you think the antagonist is going to be Madame Giry,

31:36.520 --> 31:40.520
who also really has no reason at all to feel like this,

31:40.520 --> 31:44.520
and is already an incredibly weak motivation going forward.

31:44.520 --> 31:53.520
All would be ours if that bastard had never been born!

31:53.520 --> 31:56.520
Why did you think he was going to leave everything to you?

31:56.520 --> 31:59.520
Did he say he was going to? Is he terminally ill?

31:59.520 --> 32:03.520
Because he appears to be about your age, Madame.

32:03.520 --> 32:08.520
So giving Madame Giry and Meg something like Darius's motivation from the original book,

32:08.520 --> 32:14.520
which was stupid but followed its own logic, makes this ending even worse.

32:14.520 --> 32:17.520
Giry still has the evil Persian's same motivation.

32:17.520 --> 32:20.520
She still wants his millionarity.

32:20.520 --> 32:23.520
But based on what? Where the hell does this come from?

32:23.520 --> 32:27.520
She never seemed motivated by money, not in the first show and not in the second either.

32:27.520 --> 32:33.520
And this is to say nothing of the logic of the Giry's being here at all.

32:33.520 --> 32:38.520
Who concealed him safe away? Smuggled him up to Calais?

32:38.520 --> 32:45.520
We grafted Forsyth's weird plot onto old characters from the first show who have no reason to be here, so...

32:45.520 --> 32:47.520
Give me the gun, Meg!

32:47.520 --> 32:50.520
So this new version drops all of the new characters that Forsyth added,

32:50.520 --> 32:53.520
like the priest, the reporter, and the evil Persian,

32:53.520 --> 32:56.520
and hews closer to characters already established in the first show.

32:56.520 --> 33:00.520
But not without keeping some key elements, like Christine's love child with the phantom.

33:00.520 --> 33:04.520
And the whole runs a freak show despite having been held captive in a freak show,

33:04.520 --> 33:06.520
but I guess it's a humane freak show now?

33:06.520 --> 33:08.520
Hurt people hurt people, I guess.

33:08.520 --> 33:13.520
And I'd be tempted to say that at least some of this was a good artistic move moving away from that book,

33:13.520 --> 33:15.520
but the results, man...

33:15.520 --> 33:17.520
You can face it. Yes!

33:17.520 --> 33:19.520
You can take it. Yes!

33:19.520 --> 33:23.520
Also, this show wants us to root for Eric and Christine.

33:23.520 --> 33:29.520
And in earlier versions, apparently it didn't shy away as much from the fact that he was, you know, a murderer.

33:29.520 --> 33:35.520
But in the final version, it has to totally ignore half of the first show to make its stupid romance work.

33:35.520 --> 33:38.520
The juries treat him like he's just some guy.

33:38.520 --> 33:40.520
You work for him!

33:40.520 --> 33:42.520
Now you do too!

33:42.520 --> 33:44.520
This man has killed several people.

33:44.520 --> 33:49.520
Everyone just kind of politely ignores everything he did in the first one,

33:49.520 --> 33:52.520
except for his fixation on Christine.

33:52.520 --> 33:56.520
She chose road, chose to make a new start.

33:56.520 --> 34:00.520
Chose beauty and youth over genius and art.

34:00.520 --> 34:06.520
Or my favorite little writing detail, the one song that is repeated from the first show.

34:07.520 --> 34:12.520
Twisted every way, what answer can I give?

34:17.520 --> 34:22.520
I know I can't refuse, and yet I wish I could.

34:22.520 --> 34:27.520
Here is that song from the first musical without that crucial line cut.

34:27.520 --> 34:32.520
He kills without a thought, he murders or that's good.

34:32.520 --> 34:35.520
I know I can't refuse.

34:35.520 --> 34:38.520
Hmm, feels like that might be kind of a deal breaker.

34:43.520 --> 34:49.520
So, let's be honest, the ending of this show is pretty hilarious.

34:49.520 --> 34:53.520
Christine! Oh, it's Christine!

34:53.520 --> 34:55.520
Oh, does Christine get killed?

34:55.520 --> 34:56.520
Yes!

34:56.520 --> 34:57.520
Oh!

34:59.520 --> 35:03.520
Amazing! Amazing!

35:03.520 --> 35:06.520
So what is the main tension of Love Never Dies?

35:06.520 --> 35:08.520
Well, this verse is also same as the first.

35:08.520 --> 35:11.520
What will become of the Phantom and Christine?

35:11.520 --> 35:13.520
Who will she choose?

35:13.520 --> 35:17.520
But that tension resolves after she sings her peacock dress, so the main plot is tied up.

35:17.520 --> 35:19.520
But that doesn't end the story.

35:19.520 --> 35:21.520
The random thing has to happen.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.520
Gustav. What is it?

35:22.520 --> 35:23.520
Gustav! What's wrong?

35:23.520 --> 35:25.520
I told him to wait for Raoul.

35:25.520 --> 35:28.520
Before he asked me to. Surely he wouldn't.

35:28.520 --> 35:33.520
The Phantom never at any point interacts with Meg before the end of the show.

35:33.520 --> 35:37.520
The Phantom at never any point interacted with Meg in the first show.

35:37.520 --> 35:41.520
If a tragic thing happens at the end of a story, fine, great.

35:41.520 --> 35:46.520
But it needs to both come out of and influence the actions of our protagonist.

35:46.520 --> 35:50.520
And while, sure, Meg was in the show before this,

35:50.520 --> 35:57.520
this isn't like some dad who never went to Timmy's baseball games and now Timmy's gone off the edge.

35:57.520 --> 36:03.520
Always wondered how to make you want to watch me now.

36:03.520 --> 36:07.520
We don't know anything about what their relationship even is.

36:07.520 --> 36:11.520
We don't know how he treats her. For all we know, this is like a fatal attraction scenario.

36:11.520 --> 36:15.520
But while you could argue that this was set up, sort of, like they tried to,

36:15.520 --> 36:20.520
they can't bring themselves to make the Phantom legitimately fuck them over in order to get with Christine.

36:20.520 --> 36:22.520
So this?

36:22.520 --> 36:27.520
I took a little trip to Coney Island.

36:27.520 --> 36:32.520
I took a little trip because of you.

36:32.520 --> 36:38.520
Never makes sense. He never wrongs them in any way that we actually see.

36:38.520 --> 36:42.520
I hope Christine is worthy of you.

36:42.520 --> 36:48.520
I hope her singing makes up for what your blindness has done to Meg.

36:48.520 --> 36:51.520
They just feel entitled to his stuff.

36:51.520 --> 36:57.520
The Phantom pedestalizing Christine could, in a different story, lead to some kind of downfall,

36:57.520 --> 37:00.520
but not here. Meg feels owed by him,

37:00.520 --> 37:04.520
but the show never gives us any indication that her feelings are justified.

37:04.520 --> 37:09.520
And either way, Meg is not, like, his ward. She's, like, at least 30.

37:09.520 --> 37:12.520
Man, Sherry Lewis has got it going on.

37:12.520 --> 37:15.520
In no universe is this man responsible for what she is doing right now,

37:15.520 --> 37:17.520
and it's weird to imply that he is.

37:17.520 --> 37:22.520
Give me the blame for not seeing the things that you've done, Meg.

37:22.520 --> 37:26.520
This is some poetic, thematic culmination.

37:26.520 --> 37:29.520
All his ghosts come back to haunt him.

37:29.520 --> 37:32.520
There could have been a story where he throws all the people who helped him

37:32.520 --> 37:36.520
when he very much did not deserve it under the bus because of his obsession with Christine,

37:36.520 --> 37:41.520
but the show doesn't do that because it wants the audience to root for these crazy kids.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.520
And I cannot overstate this.

37:43.520 --> 37:47.520
This is a fundamentally unsalvageable relationship.

37:47.520 --> 37:49.520
We should not be rooting for them.

37:49.520 --> 37:52.520
In this very show, he threatened to murder a child.

37:52.520 --> 38:02.520
That perfect specimen may disappear on Coley Island.

38:02.520 --> 38:04.520
You know what you do? You buy yourself a tape recorder,

38:04.520 --> 38:06.520
you just record yourself for a whole day.

38:06.520 --> 38:08.520
I think I'm going to be surprised at some of your phrasing.

38:08.520 --> 38:12.520
And only walked it back when he realized the kid was actually his crotch dumpling.

38:12.520 --> 38:14.520
He plays like me.

38:14.520 --> 38:16.520
So the tragic ending isn't poetic.

38:16.520 --> 38:20.520
It isn't the result of some mistake the Phantom actually made, and he has made many.

38:20.520 --> 38:23.520
This isn't his past or his character flaws coming back to haunt him.

38:23.520 --> 38:27.520
It's not him burning everything down if he can't get what he wants.

38:27.520 --> 38:29.520
It's just a random thing.

38:30.520 --> 38:40.520
You know, the funny thing about Empire Strikes Back when it first came out

38:40.520 --> 38:45.520
is it was actually kind of met with mixed reviews from critics and even from fans.

38:45.520 --> 38:51.520
And I think part of the reason for that is because people were so used to sequels

38:51.520 --> 38:55.520
more or less kind of following the same pattern as first ones.

38:55.520 --> 39:00.520
And the Empire Strikes Back is pretty different from the first Star Wars movie.

39:00.520 --> 39:06.520
But it didn't take long for Empire Strikes Back to be re-evaluated as the good one.

39:06.520 --> 39:10.520
Arguably the best one of all of the ones that have been produced.

39:10.520 --> 39:15.520
And generally when you look at sequels that are seen as positively,

39:15.520 --> 39:17.520
even maybe even better than the first one,

39:17.520 --> 39:19.520
it's probably because they try new things.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.520
They expand on the world.

39:21.520 --> 39:23.520
They introduce new characters.

39:23.520 --> 39:25.520
They take the story in a different direction.

39:25.520 --> 39:30.520
Because presumably your characters have grown since that first story.

39:30.520 --> 39:34.520
Phantom of the Opera ends with him letting Christine go.

39:34.520 --> 39:39.520
And the reason that the musical is more compelling than most other versions

39:39.520 --> 39:43.520
is because it's one of the only ones where that happens.

39:43.520 --> 39:49.520
Where he voluntarily kind of sees the error of his ways and lets her go.

39:49.520 --> 39:56.520
Why undo the thing that made your first show work in the first place?

39:56.520 --> 39:59.520
So you could say that Love Never Dies is a story for the ages

39:59.520 --> 40:02.520
about the need to recapture lightning in a bottle.

40:02.520 --> 40:06.520
A story of being unable to let go of the past.

40:06.520 --> 40:11.520
But at the same time I strain to think of this as a cynical lazy cash grab

40:11.520 --> 40:13.520
in the vein of Men in Black 2.

40:13.520 --> 40:17.520
It's just so, I don't know, sincere?

40:18.520 --> 40:21.520
Andrew Lloyd Webber wanted this to work.

40:21.520 --> 40:25.520
And moreover, you can't say that there was no care or passion here.

40:25.520 --> 40:28.520
Just look at the costumes and the sets.

40:28.520 --> 40:33.520
The costumes in particular are arguably better than the ones from Phantom of the Opera.

40:33.520 --> 40:41.520
Because Phantom of the Opera 1 is so melodramatic and loud and high emotions,

40:41.520 --> 40:46.520
and because I strain to see a scenario where a Phantom of the Opera sequel

40:46.520 --> 40:51.520
that includes the Phantom and Christine doing the same shit they did in the first one,

40:51.520 --> 40:54.520
not being a complete trash fire.

40:54.520 --> 41:01.520
I just, I can't imagine any sequel to that version of Phantom of the Opera

41:01.520 --> 41:05.520
being anything but, just, you can't look away from it.

41:05.520 --> 41:09.520
It is just going to inevitably be captivating.

41:09.520 --> 41:14.520
It is baffling. It is bad from start to finish.

41:14.520 --> 41:17.520
But it is also eminently watchable.

41:17.520 --> 41:19.520
And for that, I can't say I hate it.

41:19.520 --> 41:23.520
I love the shit out of Love Never Dies.

41:23.520 --> 41:26.520
You might say my love for Love Never Dies never dies.

41:26.520 --> 41:29.520
As you know, my single, my single is dropping, it's dropping.

41:29.520 --> 41:33.520
But of course, there are also many Phantom sequels and retellings out there.

41:33.520 --> 41:36.520
They don't necessarily have to take the form of a stage show.

41:36.520 --> 41:43.520
My favorite sequel is a fanfic that was published by some mysterious author like 10 years ago.

41:43.520 --> 41:47.520
There's books, and also, there's audiobooks.

41:47.520 --> 41:50.520
Hi, did you know that this is not a conflict of interest?

41:50.520 --> 41:52.520
I was surprised too.

41:52.520 --> 41:56.520
But either way, I get to promote my new audiobook, Truth of the Divine,

41:56.520 --> 42:00.520
by way of our sponsor, Audible.

42:00.520 --> 42:05.520
A lot of people have asked, is Abigail Thorne from Philosophy Tube coming back for the sequel?

42:05.520 --> 42:07.520
The answer to that is yes.

42:07.520 --> 42:10.520
And best of all, you can get it for free if you visit audible.com

So they can be inspired, informed, or entertained.

42:37.520 --> 42:38.520
No, I did not write that.

42:38.520 --> 42:43.520
