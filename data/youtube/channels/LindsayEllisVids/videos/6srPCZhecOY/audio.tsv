0	3760	If you go into the auditorium of the Palais Garnier in Paris, France,
3760	8800	you'll notice that there's this giant chandelier hanging right over the middle of the orchestra section.
8800	14320	So, on May 20th, 1896, during a performance, a counterweight to this giant chandelier fell
14320	20000	right through the ceiling and killed a concierge during a performance on her first day of work.
20720	21220	Yeah.
21680	26640	Some odd years later, a journalist-turned-novelist named Gaston Leroux took this incident and went,
26640	32000	hey, what if there was some nefarious being behind this whole chandelier thing?
32000	33120	What if it wasn't a counterweight?
33120	36480	What if it was the entire chandelier that fell?
36480	38960	What would motivate such a nefarious being?
38960	43440	I'm gonna do all this research and write this ballin' mystery novel, and it's gonna be great.
43440	46080	It's gonna be a classic of modern literature, and it...
47280	48080	was not.
48080	48560	At all.
48560	48960	It's not.
48960	50560	It's not great literature.
50560	53120	But it certainly merits discussion.
53120	55280	Phantom of the Opera is no Les Miserables.
55280	61120	It was not a sensation in its day, and yet it has spawned countless movies, musicals,
61120	67760	comic books, children's books, TV shows, ice capades, reimaginings including but not limited to
67760	71920	Phantom of the Megaplex, Phantom of the Ritz, Phantom of Hollywood, Phantom of the Mall,
71920	77200	Phantom of the Paradise, Phantom on Ice, stage versions that are not the Andrew Lloyd Webber
77200	80080	version, dozens of novel spinoffs, children's books, graphic novels.
80480	85440	For such a nothing little book, it's had a lot of adaptations.
85440	90320	But the character of the Phantom varies a lot, from really genuinely engaging to the
90320	93920	most boring thing that's ever dried your brain to a fine powder.
93920	98960	He's evil, he's sympathetic, he's the villain, he's the antihero, sometimes he's even the hero.
98960	106000	And owing to my long history of Phantom fandom, I could probably do a 26-part Ken Burns-style
106000	110560	epic on all of the many facets of this book and its adaptations and who influenced what
110560	114640	and what now, but difficult it is for me not to go on 11 tangents.
114640	119600	This episode is about the character of Eric, and I'm not going to lie and say a lot of
119600	124000	my criticisms don't stem from a nerd rage standpoint, they totally do, but here we go.
124000	128400	Instead of a comprehensive 30-hour dissection, which I could totally do,
128400	130000	we're going to keep it to two parts.
130640	134640	Eric, the Phantom of the Opera, before the musical, and after.
136000	144640	INTRO
144640	148400	The original novel is… pulpy.
148400	152640	It's told from Le Roux's point of view, as a man who's trying to piece together this
152640	155200	mystery that happened 30 years after the fact.
155200	159760	And though you, the modern reader, know from cultural osmosis that yes, there is a Phantom,
159760	163440	the first half of this book is basically a mystery with a ton of red herrings that
163440	166480	are actually pretty tedious from a storytelling standpoint.
166480	167840	Who could the Phantom be?
168640	170240	Is it the stagehand?
170240	171760	Is it the rat catcher?
171760	174960	Is it this Persian fellow who's sneaking about all the time?
174960	178640	And about halfway through the book, we find out that yes, there is indeed a dude who calls
178640	182640	himself the Opera Ghost, and that it's his basically full-time job.
182640	186880	Literally, he even extorts the opera managers to the tune of about 20,000 francs a month.
186880	189360	Mr. Phantom goes by the name of Eric.
189360	190160	No surname.
190160	191200	He's like Madonna.
191760	196240	Eric is described as having the ugliest face of any person who's ever lived.
196240	198160	He basically looks like a death's head.
198160	199440	Sort of a living corpse.
199440	204320	He compensates for this by being an amazing genius at everything.
204320	205760	He's a master musician.
205760	206880	He's a ventriloquist.
206880	207920	He can throw his voice.
207920	209440	He's a genius architect.
209440	211040	He's a master assassin.
211040	214400	And he has the most beautiful voice of any man who's ever lived.
214400	215920	What can't he do?
215920	219920	Well, turns out he's not so good with the ladies, and is a huge drama queen.
219920	221600	Like, oh, my mama didn't love me.
221600	222800	I sleep in a casket.
222800	226160	I have a literal torture chamber in my house for some reason.
226160	229520	Hey, young girl, I'm gonna kidnap you and force you to live in my lair until you fall
229520	230320	in love with me.
230320	231840	That seems reasonable.
231840	236080	The Phantom of the Opera is a Beauty and the Beast tale, but it has more in common with
236080	237920	the myth of Hades and Persephone.
237920	242240	Eric is frequently compared to death-like things in the novel, and he quite literally
242240	243760	lives in an underworld.
243760	248480	And he absconds with this innocent young girl, a novice singer in the opera named Christine.
248480	252240	Speaking to her from behind her mirrors in her dressing room, he tells her, hey, I'm
252240	256720	a literal angel sent to you by your dead father to train you to sing, which she, being super
256720	259840	religious, is like, okay, that sounds legit.
260400	264320	So she's pretty disappointed to find out that he's actually kind of like a crazy,
264320	265600	deformed person.
265600	270080	But Eric is also super jealous of Christine's childhood sweetheart, the Vicomte Raoul de
270080	274560	Chagny, and the novel comes to a head when Raoul and the Persian descend into the Phantom's
274560	278960	underworld to rescue Christine, only immediately to get oopsy-daisy caught in Eric's torture
278960	279920	chamber, which he has.
280480	283200	And Eric thinks this is great, more to blackmail Christine with.
283200	287520	He's like, hey, girl, either you marry me or I'm gonna kill these two and blow up the
287520	289360	entire opera, and both of us.
290480	291280	What a prize.
292400	296960	So let's talk about Eric's character arc, which is the most important aspect of the
296960	300880	story to me, and the thing that most of the adaptations screw the pooch on.
300880	305600	Christine says, okay, I'll marry you, which obviously she really does not want to do,
305600	309760	but will do this incredibly selfless thing if it means saving other people's lives.
309760	314800	But the fact that she does this kind of does him in, and she even kisses him because she
314800	316560	really does feel sorry for him.
317120	322400	And so Eric, surprised and completely done in by her selflessness, lets her, Raoul, and
322400	323600	the Persian go.
323600	326400	She marries Raoul, and Eric dies alone.
326400	331360	And the book ends with the author contending that, despite his deeds, Eric was not an inherently
331360	335520	bad person, and could have been a great person if the world hadn't been so shitty to him,
335520	340480	and that he did not deserve to be demonized, but there were many circumstances, some within
340480	345600	his control, but many not, that made him the way he was, that he wasn't a monster, but
345600	346720	a flawed human.
347280	352480	So that's actually pretty sophisticated moral for a turn-of-the-century pulp horror novel.
353920	355920	Let's see what Hollywood does with that.
356400	365200	When you think of Universal Monsters and Phantom of the Opera, this is that version.
365200	370400	In fact, as far as Monster Phantom goes, the Lloyd Webber musical, he's a misunderstood
370400	374720	sex god, so we're not counting that, Lon Chaney's is the definitive version.
374720	376720	This was actually not the first film version.
376720	381520	There was one in 1916, but as is the case with about 90% of all silent films, this one
381520	384080	was lost, and we don't really know all that much about it.
384080	388640	So for the purposes of this little YouTube video, 1925 is the first movie.
388640	394000	Like Book Eric, Chaney's Eric is highly emotional and really just a little too upfront
394000	394880	with his feelings.
396720	399120	Oh good, that's really appealing.
400000	405840	And she then immediately runs on in the casket he sleeps in, and he's like, yep, it is
405840	407200	what it is, baby.
407200	411520	This movie isn't just important as an adaptation of Phantom of the Opera, but is also a seminal
411520	416160	piece of pop culture and Hollywood history in the horror genre, not to mention a landmark
416160	418960	in makeup and effects work, and well worth checking out.
418960	424000	The scene where Christine first unmasks Eric and then he comes at her, critics at the time
424000	428880	reported hearing screams in the screening, and some patrons even fainted or left the
428880	431760	theater because they were so horrified by Lon Chaney's makeup.
432320	437120	Although that weird little cloth thing on his mask does detract from his menace a bit.
437760	442560	I wouldn't call it the best of the movie adaptations, except for that ending.
443360	447360	Early in the novel, the corpse of a stagehand named Bouquet, who'd been garrotted, is
447360	448720	found in the cellar.
448720	454080	In the movie, Bouquet's got a brother, and there's an obviously hastily added in, hey,
454080	458400	this guy killed my brother and I found out where he lives offscreen somewhere, ending.
458400	462640	Like in the novel, Christine's like, please let them go, I'll do whatever, and Eric's
462640	463280	like, okay.
463840	465360	And he does let them go.
465360	469360	And then when Christine's petting on Raoul and Eric's over here kinda grumpy and then
469360	475280	busts in the angry mob and suddenly there's a chase scene and we're on a wild carriage
475280	476800	ride and dang.
476800	481920	So obviously in the book, Eric is a lot more sympathetic, but his rival, Raoul, is a lot
481920	482480	less so.
482480	485120	He is a whiny, self-centered little baby.
485120	489440	In the movie, Raoul is more of a conventional, dashing, straightforward movie hero, and Eric
489440	490720	is a monster.
490720	495600	Both of them become less complex, and that element in the original novel that contemplates
495600	500160	on Eric's humanity and what made him into a monster, eh, screw that.
500720	504800	But even so, there's a great case to make for Lon Chaney's Eric as pure and simple
504800	506160	the best performance.
506160	511600	He walks this great fine line of sympathetic, terrifying, childlike, eccentric, and all
511600	513760	through facial expression and body language.
513760	517760	He's really, genuinely horrifying, and yet he's so expressive.
518480	520240	Except for the stupid ending.
520240	521600	Okay, guys, I've got a grenade!
521600	522100	It's...
522560	523760	I'm just kidding.
524800	525680	Hey, we have fun.
528400	533680	It was also originally going to end like the book, and Lon Chaney himself was purportedly
533680	535280	not wild about this change.
535280	539520	But, you know, it's early Hollywood and villainous characters aren't allowed to have, like,
539520	542800	you know, redemption arcs or growth or depth.
542800	544080	So, bye Eric.
544960	545460	Next.
545940	549940	歌谱已经操好了。现在我们先把这歌练起来吧。
549940	553300	This movie is considered one of the greats of early Chinese cinema.
553300	558260	It was lost to the ages during the Cultural Revolution, and was only found again in 1998.
558900	563460	This one is a first in the trend of the Phantom getting disfigured after the fact rather than
563460	568100	from birth, which I take slight umbrage with, but we'll get to that.
568100	573700	The Phantom in this one is a dude named Song Danping, and Christine in this version appears
573700	581460	to be a dude, his name is Song, and promises to train him so that he can sing to Song's
581460	585620	lady love who has been driven mad because she thinks Song is dead.
585620	588580	So, Song teaches Song to sing.
589780	591380	I swear I'm not making this up.
591380	596180	This movie has a big subplot about a leftist revolutionary movement, and most of the romance
596180	598500	storyline is told in flashbacks.
598500	600260	Song's lady love is not a singer.
600260	603140	Instead, she's in what appears to be a madhouse.
603140	607380	Song is also a lot more sympathetic than the Cheney version, or even the book version
607380	611540	for that matter, as it really plays up the romance angle and his tragic fall.
611540	613380	Hey, the Phantom was hot at one point.
613940	616980	Although, true to form, our Phantom is a huge drama queen.
621620	626340	And I know this is pretty much par for the course as far as acting in early Chinese cinema
626340	630900	goes, but I'm just saying it works where the Phantom is concerned.
633140	636260	I can't even stand bad feelings.
636260	640500	But even with our more sympathetic Phantom, the movie still ends like the fucking Lon
640500	644180	Chaney movie, and the Christine analog ends up with Song.
645860	647380	But it doesn't matter now.
647380	649860	Nothing matters except you and me, Christine.
649860	653300	Now you sing all you want, but only for me.
653300	658660	This was Universal's big, lavish, big-budgeted remake of the 1925 version, but like its
658660	662980	rewrite-addled predecessor, you can kind of see the cracks.
663700	668420	Claude Rains plays Éric Clodin, who's a retiring star violinist at the opera.
668420	672100	In the original screenplay, he was going to be Christine's father, and that's why,
672100	676900	rather than teaching her to sing himself, he spends his life savings on singing lessons
676900	677300	for her.
677860	683220	Knowing this makes the movie make more sense, but they cut out the father angle.
683220	688260	So instead, he's just this weird old guy who's oddly fixated on this one girl with
688260	690020	no real context as to why.
690580	691620	You weren't ill, were you?
692740	694100	You're not in any trouble.
694100	699060	But this Phantom also has a tragic life, and he has a super sympathetic backstory up until
699060	702580	he, uh, up and murders a guy over a misunderstanding.
703380	706580	And then we get the acid in the face, and hot damn with the crazy.
707220	711620	I suppose the implication was that this version, he was always kind of on the edge, and then
711620	713300	here was the snapping point.
713300	717540	So when, towards the end, he gets Christine down in his lair, it's like...
717620	718820	I warned them.
718820	722580	I told them there'd be death and destruction if they didn't let you sing.
722580	724020	Well, that escalated quickly.
724580	726420	But then the focus shifts entirely.
726420	730580	After the acid sploosh, Eric isn't in the movie much at all, and for the most part,
730580	734500	we follow the not one but two Raouls, trying to figure out what's going on.
735220	738660	Why is he so obsessed with this girl he's had basically no contact with?
739940	743460	There's a lot of reading between the lines with this Phantom's motivation.
743460	746260	If he is her dad, then why is he not in her life?
746260	747780	If not, what's his deal?
747780	749220	Is he just thinks she's cute?
749220	752100	What made him snap and kill that guy over basically nothing?
752100	754020	Does he have a history of stuff like this?
754020	756980	And that's why he lives alone and tries to stay out of Christine's life?
757860	762340	In the end, the movie just ends abruptly with death by falling rocks,
762340	764900	and everyone just kind of shrugs and moves on.
765540	769540	In the end, I'm left wondering what the filmmakers were even going for.
770980	771480	Next.
772280	773400	I shall teach you.
773960	776920	When you sing, it will be only for me.
777640	782360	This version is trying to be scary, and it's, uh, it's boring.
782360	783240	It's really boring.
783240	787880	There's the theft of his music during slash after his disfigurement, which, yep, once again,
790840	793880	only where in the 1943 version it was a perceived theft,
793880	797160	this time it is a legit theft by the opera.
797160	800920	Also, like in the 43 version, we get not one but two Raouls,
800920	803720	only this time one of the Raouls is a bad guy.
803720	805640	One with a dashing yet boring love interest,
805640	807880	the other's just kind of, you know, rapey,
807880	812120	and I guess he's there to make the Phantom look more sympathetic by comparison.
812120	813960	See, the Phantom may be a total jerkwad,
813960	817080	but at least he's not an attempted rapist like this guy, so.
817080	819640	You are dining with Ambrose Darcy tonight.
820360	824200	Be warned, he's a vile and vicious man.
824200	826280	Don't let him be creepy and possessive.
826280	828360	Let me be creepy and possessive.
828440	831880	This is also the only version where the chandelier fall is an accident,
831880	834760	and rather than causing it, he pushes Christine to safety,
834760	837080	sacrificing himself, and that's how the movie ends.
837640	840280	So it's interesting to note that of the ones we've covered,
840280	845000	the American versions all have a monstrous villainous Eric getting punished at the end,
845000	848440	and the non-American ones have a more sympathetic, complex version.
848440	849880	This one is British.
849880	854200	That's not to say a more complex take isn't doable by American filmmakers,
854200	858520	but maybe it just needs to be done outside of the studio system.
858520	861480	Have you ever seen my music again?
862200	864600	Not here, not anywhere, do you understand?
864600	865480	Never again.
865480	869640	Phantom of the Paradise takes place in a sort of surreal alternate universe
869640	871640	at a club called The Paradise.
871640	874040	It's one of Brian De Palma's earliest movies.
874040	878360	It's a musical, and it's probably the best of all of the Phantom movies,
878360	880440	and it's also probably my favorite De Palma.
880440	880840	Easy.
880840	882680	Say what you want about Phantom of the Paradise,
882680	884280	it knows what it's about.
884280	886440	This movie is in for a penny, in for a pound.
887560	888440	But I'm innocent!
888440	891480	Swan stole my music and framed me!
891480	895080	In a way, it's more of an adaptation of Faust than Phantom of the Opera,
895080	899000	Faust being the opera in the original novel that Christine makes her debut in.
899000	902040	Like the 1943 and 1962 versions,
902040	906600	this one has the theft of my beautiful music and then I got disfigured thing going on.
906600	911320	Unlike in those versions, there's also a selling my soul to Satan thing going on.
912120	916600	And yes, this is another fucking version where he becomes disfigured during the plot.
916600	917880	His name is Winslow.
917880	921000	He's basically if Elton John and Leonard Cohen had a kid.
921000	924120	It's debatable whether there is a Raoul in this version.
924120	926600	Let's go with no.
926600	929640	But there is an antagonist who competes for the love of Phoenix,
929640	931560	who is the Christine in this version.
931560	932520	And she sucks.
935400	936920	This guy is named Swan,
937000	941480	and he has more in common with Lord Ambrose in the 1962 version.
941480	943560	As for Winslow's character arc,
943560	947320	the punishment that he goes through makes his turn to the crazy
947320	949000	be more than just being,
949000	952840	ah, I'm disfigured, now I'm insane, as we've seen before.
952840	956920	The movie does torture him, but the bizarre comedic tone of it?
956920	959000	Well, I think it makes it work.
959000	961800	But even after all of his mad deeds at the end,
961800	964440	Winslow basically sacrifices himself for Phoenix
964440	967160	and manages to get out of that whole deal with Satan thing.
967160	969640	So he takes it a step further than book Eric,
969640	972920	from letting go the one you love to self-sacrifice.
972920	976280	So, so far, and we will see this also in part two,
976280	978840	here's two major changes we see all the time.
978840	981000	One, he was not born disfigured,
981000	984440	therefore it wasn't a lifetime of crap that made him the way he is,
984440	986200	but he just snapped one day.
986200	989000	And that he does not let Christine go at the end.
989800	993320	So this story is Victorian melodrama.
993320	995880	Everyone is a prodigy, and I'm a mad genius,
995880	997400	and I'm deformed, and I killed people,
997400	999480	and oh, my love could crush mountains,
999480	1003000	and I'm gonna blow up the opera house if you don't marry me right now.
1003720	1005000	Who doesn't relate to that?
1006200	1008840	Seriously, I mean, the premise is kind of out there,
1008840	1010520	but the emotions aren't.
1010520	1013480	This is a story about a deeply toxic relationship,
1013480	1016360	and how the two major players mature out of it.
1016360	1017960	And the thing about monsters,
1017960	1020920	movies like to show you that they are bad monsters for a reason,
1020920	1023800	but they also like to punish the monster.
1023800	1025880	Hollywood movies love to reinforce this idea
1025880	1027960	that there are good people, and bad people,
1027960	1029640	and bad people get punished,
1030280	1033320	which is kind of limiting.
1033320	1034200	Let's say that.
1034200	1037160	We all have the potential to be monstrous to varying degrees.
1037160	1038520	Maybe we don't kill people,
1038520	1042920	but being manipulative, jealous, possessive, reclusive, selfish.
1042920	1045240	Those are the traits that made Eric monstrous,
1045240	1047080	and they are also painfully human.
1047640	1050280	Eric is the way he is because his life has sucked.
1050280	1051960	All of it, from start to finish.
1051960	1053480	And that's why I don't like the whole,
1053480	1056120	and then one day I got acid in the face angle.
1056120	1058680	I think the Brian De Palma version, Phantom of the Paradise,
1059720	1062600	came pretty close to tapping into why this character is engaging.
1062600	1065560	But in all of them, something's missing.
1066600	1070200	Something that could really just appeal to every midwestern mom,
1071080	1072360	every teenage girl.
1073320	1077320	I think we need to take this tragic emotional breakdown of a character,
1077320	1080200	and make him sexy.
1080840	1084280	Now, let it be war upon you both.
1086040	1088200	Or at least try to.
