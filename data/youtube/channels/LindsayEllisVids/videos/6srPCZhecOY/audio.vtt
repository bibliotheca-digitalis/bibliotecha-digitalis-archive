WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.760
If you go into the auditorium of the Palais Garnier in Paris, France,

00:03.760 --> 00:08.800
you'll notice that there's this giant chandelier hanging right over the middle of the orchestra section.

00:08.800 --> 00:14.320
So, on May 20th, 1896, during a performance, a counterweight to this giant chandelier fell

00:14.320 --> 00:20.000
right through the ceiling and killed a concierge during a performance on her first day of work.

00:20.720 --> 00:21.220
Yeah.

00:21.680 --> 00:26.640
Some odd years later, a journalist-turned-novelist named Gaston Leroux took this incident and went,

00:26.640 --> 00:32.000
hey, what if there was some nefarious being behind this whole chandelier thing?

00:32.000 --> 00:33.120
What if it wasn't a counterweight?

00:33.120 --> 00:36.480
What if it was the entire chandelier that fell?

00:36.480 --> 00:38.960
What would motivate such a nefarious being?

00:38.960 --> 00:43.440
I'm gonna do all this research and write this ballin' mystery novel, and it's gonna be great.

00:43.440 --> 00:46.080
It's gonna be a classic of modern literature, and it...

00:47.280 --> 00:48.080
was not.

00:48.080 --> 00:48.560
At all.

00:48.560 --> 00:48.960
It's not.

00:48.960 --> 00:50.560
It's not great literature.

00:50.560 --> 00:53.120
But it certainly merits discussion.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.280
Phantom of the Opera is no Les Miserables.

00:55.280 --> 01:01.120
It was not a sensation in its day, and yet it has spawned countless movies, musicals,

01:01.120 --> 01:07.760
comic books, children's books, TV shows, ice capades, reimaginings including but not limited to

01:07.760 --> 01:11.920
Phantom of the Megaplex, Phantom of the Ritz, Phantom of Hollywood, Phantom of the Mall,

01:11.920 --> 01:17.200
Phantom of the Paradise, Phantom on Ice, stage versions that are not the Andrew Lloyd Webber

01:17.200 --> 01:20.080
version, dozens of novel spinoffs, children's books, graphic novels.

01:20.480 --> 01:25.440
For such a nothing little book, it's had a lot of adaptations.

01:25.440 --> 01:30.320
But the character of the Phantom varies a lot, from really genuinely engaging to the

01:30.320 --> 01:33.920
most boring thing that's ever dried your brain to a fine powder.

01:33.920 --> 01:38.960
He's evil, he's sympathetic, he's the villain, he's the antihero, sometimes he's even the hero.

01:38.960 --> 01:46.000
And owing to my long history of Phantom fandom, I could probably do a 26-part Ken Burns-style

01:46.000 --> 01:50.560
epic on all of the many facets of this book and its adaptations and who influenced what

01:50.560 --> 01:54.640
and what now, but difficult it is for me not to go on 11 tangents.

01:54.640 --> 01:59.600
This episode is about the character of Eric, and I'm not going to lie and say a lot of

01:59.600 --> 02:04.000
my criticisms don't stem from a nerd rage standpoint, they totally do, but here we go.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.400
Instead of a comprehensive 30-hour dissection, which I could totally do,

02:08.400 --> 02:10.000
we're going to keep it to two parts.

02:10.640 --> 02:14.640
Eric, the Phantom of the Opera, before the musical, and after.

02:16.000 --> 02:24.640
INTRO

02:24.640 --> 02:28.400
The original novel is… pulpy.

02:28.400 --> 02:32.640
It's told from Le Roux's point of view, as a man who's trying to piece together this

02:32.640 --> 02:35.200
mystery that happened 30 years after the fact.

02:35.200 --> 02:39.760
And though you, the modern reader, know from cultural osmosis that yes, there is a Phantom,

02:39.760 --> 02:43.440
the first half of this book is basically a mystery with a ton of red herrings that

02:43.440 --> 02:46.480
are actually pretty tedious from a storytelling standpoint.

02:46.480 --> 02:47.840
Who could the Phantom be?

02:48.640 --> 02:50.240
Is it the stagehand?

02:50.240 --> 02:51.760
Is it the rat catcher?

02:51.760 --> 02:54.960
Is it this Persian fellow who's sneaking about all the time?

02:54.960 --> 02:58.640
And about halfway through the book, we find out that yes, there is indeed a dude who calls

02:58.640 --> 03:02.640
himself the Opera Ghost, and that it's his basically full-time job.

03:02.640 --> 03:06.880
Literally, he even extorts the opera managers to the tune of about 20,000 francs a month.

03:06.880 --> 03:09.360
Mr. Phantom goes by the name of Eric.

03:09.360 --> 03:10.160
No surname.

03:10.160 --> 03:11.200
He's like Madonna.

03:11.760 --> 03:16.240
Eric is described as having the ugliest face of any person who's ever lived.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.160
He basically looks like a death's head.

03:18.160 --> 03:19.440
Sort of a living corpse.

03:19.440 --> 03:24.320
He compensates for this by being an amazing genius at everything.

03:24.320 --> 03:25.760
He's a master musician.

03:25.760 --> 03:26.880
He's a ventriloquist.

03:26.880 --> 03:27.920
He can throw his voice.

03:27.920 --> 03:29.440
He's a genius architect.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.040
He's a master assassin.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.400
And he has the most beautiful voice of any man who's ever lived.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.920
What can't he do?

03:35.920 --> 03:39.920
Well, turns out he's not so good with the ladies, and is a huge drama queen.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.600
Like, oh, my mama didn't love me.

03:41.600 --> 03:42.800
I sleep in a casket.

03:42.800 --> 03:46.160
I have a literal torture chamber in my house for some reason.

03:46.160 --> 03:49.520
Hey, young girl, I'm gonna kidnap you and force you to live in my lair until you fall

03:49.520 --> 03:50.320
in love with me.

03:50.320 --> 03:51.840
That seems reasonable.

03:51.840 --> 03:56.080
The Phantom of the Opera is a Beauty and the Beast tale, but it has more in common with

03:56.080 --> 03:57.920
the myth of Hades and Persephone.

03:57.920 --> 04:02.240
Eric is frequently compared to death-like things in the novel, and he quite literally

04:02.240 --> 04:03.760
lives in an underworld.

04:03.760 --> 04:08.480
And he absconds with this innocent young girl, a novice singer in the opera named Christine.

04:08.480 --> 04:12.240
Speaking to her from behind her mirrors in her dressing room, he tells her, hey, I'm

04:12.240 --> 04:16.720
a literal angel sent to you by your dead father to train you to sing, which she, being super

04:16.720 --> 04:19.840
religious, is like, okay, that sounds legit.

04:20.400 --> 04:24.320
So she's pretty disappointed to find out that he's actually kind of like a crazy,

04:24.320 --> 04:25.600
deformed person.

04:25.600 --> 04:30.080
But Eric is also super jealous of Christine's childhood sweetheart, the Vicomte Raoul de

04:30.080 --> 04:34.560
Chagny, and the novel comes to a head when Raoul and the Persian descend into the Phantom's

04:34.560 --> 04:38.960
underworld to rescue Christine, only immediately to get oopsy-daisy caught in Eric's torture

04:38.960 --> 04:39.920
chamber, which he has.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.200
And Eric thinks this is great, more to blackmail Christine with.

04:43.200 --> 04:47.520
He's like, hey, girl, either you marry me or I'm gonna kill these two and blow up the

04:47.520 --> 04:49.360
entire opera, and both of us.

04:50.480 --> 04:51.280
What a prize.

04:52.400 --> 04:56.960
So let's talk about Eric's character arc, which is the most important aspect of the

04:56.960 --> 05:00.880
story to me, and the thing that most of the adaptations screw the pooch on.

05:00.880 --> 05:05.600
Christine says, okay, I'll marry you, which obviously she really does not want to do,

05:05.600 --> 05:09.760
but will do this incredibly selfless thing if it means saving other people's lives.

05:09.760 --> 05:14.800
But the fact that she does this kind of does him in, and she even kisses him because she

05:14.800 --> 05:16.560
really does feel sorry for him.

05:17.120 --> 05:22.400
And so Eric, surprised and completely done in by her selflessness, lets her, Raoul, and

05:22.400 --> 05:23.600
the Persian go.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.400
She marries Raoul, and Eric dies alone.

05:26.400 --> 05:31.360
And the book ends with the author contending that, despite his deeds, Eric was not an inherently

05:31.360 --> 05:35.520
bad person, and could have been a great person if the world hadn't been so shitty to him,

05:35.520 --> 05:40.480
and that he did not deserve to be demonized, but there were many circumstances, some within

05:40.480 --> 05:45.600
his control, but many not, that made him the way he was, that he wasn't a monster, but

05:45.600 --> 05:46.720
a flawed human.

05:47.280 --> 05:52.480
So that's actually pretty sophisticated moral for a turn-of-the-century pulp horror novel.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.920
Let's see what Hollywood does with that.

05:56.400 --> 06:05.200
When you think of Universal Monsters and Phantom of the Opera, this is that version.

06:05.200 --> 06:10.400
In fact, as far as Monster Phantom goes, the Lloyd Webber musical, he's a misunderstood

06:10.400 --> 06:14.720
sex god, so we're not counting that, Lon Chaney's is the definitive version.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.720
This was actually not the first film version.

06:16.720 --> 06:21.520
There was one in 1916, but as is the case with about 90% of all silent films, this one

06:21.520 --> 06:24.080
was lost, and we don't really know all that much about it.

06:24.080 --> 06:28.640
So for the purposes of this little YouTube video, 1925 is the first movie.

06:28.640 --> 06:34.000
Like Book Eric, Chaney's Eric is highly emotional and really just a little too upfront

06:34.000 --> 06:34.880
with his feelings.

06:36.720 --> 06:39.120
Oh good, that's really appealing.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.840
And she then immediately runs on in the casket he sleeps in, and he's like, yep, it is

06:45.840 --> 06:47.200
what it is, baby.

06:47.200 --> 06:51.520
This movie isn't just important as an adaptation of Phantom of the Opera, but is also a seminal

06:51.520 --> 06:56.160
piece of pop culture and Hollywood history in the horror genre, not to mention a landmark

06:56.160 --> 06:58.960
in makeup and effects work, and well worth checking out.

06:58.960 --> 07:04.000
The scene where Christine first unmasks Eric and then he comes at her, critics at the time

07:04.000 --> 07:08.880
reported hearing screams in the screening, and some patrons even fainted or left the

07:08.880 --> 07:11.760
theater because they were so horrified by Lon Chaney's makeup.

07:12.320 --> 07:17.120
Although that weird little cloth thing on his mask does detract from his menace a bit.

07:17.760 --> 07:22.560
I wouldn't call it the best of the movie adaptations, except for that ending.

07:23.360 --> 07:27.360
Early in the novel, the corpse of a stagehand named Bouquet, who'd been garrotted, is

07:27.360 --> 07:28.720
found in the cellar.

07:28.720 --> 07:34.080
In the movie, Bouquet's got a brother, and there's an obviously hastily added in, hey,

07:34.080 --> 07:38.400
this guy killed my brother and I found out where he lives offscreen somewhere, ending.

07:38.400 --> 07:42.640
Like in the novel, Christine's like, please let them go, I'll do whatever, and Eric's

07:42.640 --> 07:43.280
like, okay.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.360
And he does let them go.

07:45.360 --> 07:49.360
And then when Christine's petting on Raoul and Eric's over here kinda grumpy and then

07:49.360 --> 07:55.280
busts in the angry mob and suddenly there's a chase scene and we're on a wild carriage

07:55.280 --> 07:56.800
ride and dang.

07:56.800 --> 08:01.920
So obviously in the book, Eric is a lot more sympathetic, but his rival, Raoul, is a lot

08:01.920 --> 08:02.480
less so.

08:02.480 --> 08:05.120
He is a whiny, self-centered little baby.

08:05.120 --> 08:09.440
In the movie, Raoul is more of a conventional, dashing, straightforward movie hero, and Eric

08:09.440 --> 08:10.720
is a monster.

08:10.720 --> 08:15.600
Both of them become less complex, and that element in the original novel that contemplates

08:15.600 --> 08:20.160
on Eric's humanity and what made him into a monster, eh, screw that.

08:20.720 --> 08:24.800
But even so, there's a great case to make for Lon Chaney's Eric as pure and simple

08:24.800 --> 08:26.160
the best performance.

08:26.160 --> 08:31.600
He walks this great fine line of sympathetic, terrifying, childlike, eccentric, and all

08:31.600 --> 08:33.760
through facial expression and body language.

08:33.760 --> 08:37.760
He's really, genuinely horrifying, and yet he's so expressive.

08:38.480 --> 08:40.240
Except for the stupid ending.

08:40.240 --> 08:41.600
Okay, guys, I've got a grenade!

08:41.600 --> 08:42.100
It's...

08:42.560 --> 08:43.760
I'm just kidding.

08:44.800 --> 08:45.680
Hey, we have fun.

08:48.400 --> 08:53.680
It was also originally going to end like the book, and Lon Chaney himself was purportedly

08:53.680 --> 08:55.280
not wild about this change.

08:55.280 --> 08:59.520
But, you know, it's early Hollywood and villainous characters aren't allowed to have, like,

08:59.520 --> 09:02.800
you know, redemption arcs or growth or depth.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.080
So, bye Eric.

09:04.960 --> 09:05.460
Next.

09:05.940 --> 09:09.940
歌谱已经操好了。现在我们先把这歌练起来吧。

09:09.940 --> 09:13.300
This movie is considered one of the greats of early Chinese cinema.

09:13.300 --> 09:18.260
It was lost to the ages during the Cultural Revolution, and was only found again in 1998.

09:18.900 --> 09:23.460
This one is a first in the trend of the Phantom getting disfigured after the fact rather than

09:23.460 --> 09:28.100
from birth, which I take slight umbrage with, but we'll get to that.

09:28.100 --> 09:33.700
The Phantom in this one is a dude named Song Danping, and Christine in this version appears

09:33.700 --> 09:41.460
to be a dude, his name is Song, and promises to train him so that he can sing to Song's

09:41.460 --> 09:45.620
lady love who has been driven mad because she thinks Song is dead.

09:45.620 --> 09:48.580
So, Song teaches Song to sing.

09:49.780 --> 09:51.380
I swear I'm not making this up.

09:51.380 --> 09:56.180
This movie has a big subplot about a leftist revolutionary movement, and most of the romance

09:56.180 --> 09:58.500
storyline is told in flashbacks.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.260
Song's lady love is not a singer.

10:00.260 --> 10:03.140
Instead, she's in what appears to be a madhouse.

10:03.140 --> 10:07.380
Song is also a lot more sympathetic than the Cheney version, or even the book version

10:07.380 --> 10:11.540
for that matter, as it really plays up the romance angle and his tragic fall.

10:11.540 --> 10:13.380
Hey, the Phantom was hot at one point.

10:13.940 --> 10:16.980
Although, true to form, our Phantom is a huge drama queen.

10:21.620 --> 10:26.340
And I know this is pretty much par for the course as far as acting in early Chinese cinema

10:26.340 --> 10:30.900
goes, but I'm just saying it works where the Phantom is concerned.

10:33.140 --> 10:36.260
I can't even stand bad feelings.

10:36.260 --> 10:40.500
But even with our more sympathetic Phantom, the movie still ends like the fucking Lon

10:40.500 --> 10:44.180
Chaney movie, and the Christine analog ends up with Song.

10:45.860 --> 10:47.380
But it doesn't matter now.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.860
Nothing matters except you and me, Christine.

10:49.860 --> 10:53.300
Now you sing all you want, but only for me.

10:53.300 --> 10:58.660
This was Universal's big, lavish, big-budgeted remake of the 1925 version, but like its

10:58.660 --> 11:02.980
rewrite-addled predecessor, you can kind of see the cracks.

11:03.700 --> 11:08.420
Claude Rains plays Éric Clodin, who's a retiring star violinist at the opera.

11:08.420 --> 11:12.100
In the original screenplay, he was going to be Christine's father, and that's why,

11:12.100 --> 11:16.900
rather than teaching her to sing himself, he spends his life savings on singing lessons

11:16.900 --> 11:17.300
for her.

11:17.860 --> 11:23.220
Knowing this makes the movie make more sense, but they cut out the father angle.

11:23.220 --> 11:28.260
So instead, he's just this weird old guy who's oddly fixated on this one girl with

11:28.260 --> 11:30.020
no real context as to why.

11:30.580 --> 11:31.620
You weren't ill, were you?

11:32.740 --> 11:34.100
You're not in any trouble.

11:34.100 --> 11:39.060
But this Phantom also has a tragic life, and he has a super sympathetic backstory up until

11:39.060 --> 11:42.580
he, uh, up and murders a guy over a misunderstanding.

11:43.380 --> 11:46.580
And then we get the acid in the face, and hot damn with the crazy.

11:47.220 --> 11:51.620
I suppose the implication was that this version, he was always kind of on the edge, and then

11:51.620 --> 11:53.300
here was the snapping point.

11:53.300 --> 11:57.540
So when, towards the end, he gets Christine down in his lair, it's like...

11:57.620 --> 11:58.820
I warned them.

11:58.820 --> 12:02.580
I told them there'd be death and destruction if they didn't let you sing.

12:02.580 --> 12:04.020
Well, that escalated quickly.

12:04.580 --> 12:06.420
But then the focus shifts entirely.

12:06.420 --> 12:10.580
After the acid sploosh, Eric isn't in the movie much at all, and for the most part,

12:10.580 --> 12:14.500
we follow the not one but two Raouls, trying to figure out what's going on.

12:15.220 --> 12:18.660
Why is he so obsessed with this girl he's had basically no contact with?

12:19.940 --> 12:23.460
There's a lot of reading between the lines with this Phantom's motivation.

12:23.460 --> 12:26.260
If he is her dad, then why is he not in her life?

12:26.260 --> 12:27.780
If not, what's his deal?

12:27.780 --> 12:29.220
Is he just thinks she's cute?

12:29.220 --> 12:32.100
What made him snap and kill that guy over basically nothing?

12:32.100 --> 12:34.020
Does he have a history of stuff like this?

12:34.020 --> 12:36.980
And that's why he lives alone and tries to stay out of Christine's life?

12:37.860 --> 12:42.340
In the end, the movie just ends abruptly with death by falling rocks,

12:42.340 --> 12:44.900
and everyone just kind of shrugs and moves on.

12:45.540 --> 12:49.540
In the end, I'm left wondering what the filmmakers were even going for.

12:50.980 --> 12:51.480
Next.

12:52.280 --> 12:53.400
I shall teach you.

12:53.960 --> 12:56.920
When you sing, it will be only for me.

12:57.640 --> 13:02.360
This version is trying to be scary, and it's, uh, it's boring.

13:02.360 --> 13:03.240
It's really boring.

13:03.240 --> 13:07.880
There's the theft of his music during slash after his disfigurement, which, yep, once again,

13:10.840 --> 13:13.880
only where in the 1943 version it was a perceived theft,

13:13.880 --> 13:17.160
this time it is a legit theft by the opera.

13:17.160 --> 13:20.920
Also, like in the 43 version, we get not one but two Raouls,

13:20.920 --> 13:23.720
only this time one of the Raouls is a bad guy.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.640
One with a dashing yet boring love interest,

13:25.640 --> 13:27.880
the other's just kind of, you know, rapey,

13:27.880 --> 13:32.120
and I guess he's there to make the Phantom look more sympathetic by comparison.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.960
See, the Phantom may be a total jerkwad,

13:33.960 --> 13:37.080
but at least he's not an attempted rapist like this guy, so.

13:37.080 --> 13:39.640
You are dining with Ambrose Darcy tonight.

13:40.360 --> 13:44.200
Be warned, he's a vile and vicious man.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.280
Don't let him be creepy and possessive.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.360
Let me be creepy and possessive.

13:48.440 --> 13:51.880
This is also the only version where the chandelier fall is an accident,

13:51.880 --> 13:54.760
and rather than causing it, he pushes Christine to safety,

13:54.760 --> 13:57.080
sacrificing himself, and that's how the movie ends.

13:57.640 --> 14:00.280
So it's interesting to note that of the ones we've covered,

14:00.280 --> 14:05.000
the American versions all have a monstrous villainous Eric getting punished at the end,

14:05.000 --> 14:08.440
and the non-American ones have a more sympathetic, complex version.

14:08.440 --> 14:09.880
This one is British.

14:09.880 --> 14:14.200
That's not to say a more complex take isn't doable by American filmmakers,

14:14.200 --> 14:18.520
but maybe it just needs to be done outside of the studio system.

14:18.520 --> 14:21.480
Have you ever seen my music again?

14:22.200 --> 14:24.600
Not here, not anywhere, do you understand?

14:24.600 --> 14:25.480
Never again.

14:25.480 --> 14:29.640
Phantom of the Paradise takes place in a sort of surreal alternate universe

14:29.640 --> 14:31.640
at a club called The Paradise.

14:31.640 --> 14:34.040
It's one of Brian De Palma's earliest movies.

14:34.040 --> 14:38.360
It's a musical, and it's probably the best of all of the Phantom movies,

14:38.360 --> 14:40.440
and it's also probably my favorite De Palma.

14:40.440 --> 14:40.840
Easy.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.680
Say what you want about Phantom of the Paradise,

14:42.680 --> 14:44.280
it knows what it's about.

14:44.280 --> 14:46.440
This movie is in for a penny, in for a pound.

14:47.560 --> 14:48.440
But I'm innocent!

14:48.440 --> 14:51.480
Swan stole my music and framed me!

14:51.480 --> 14:55.080
In a way, it's more of an adaptation of Faust than Phantom of the Opera,

14:55.080 --> 14:59.000
Faust being the opera in the original novel that Christine makes her debut in.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.040
Like the 1943 and 1962 versions,

15:02.040 --> 15:06.600
this one has the theft of my beautiful music and then I got disfigured thing going on.

15:06.600 --> 15:11.320
Unlike in those versions, there's also a selling my soul to Satan thing going on.

15:12.120 --> 15:16.600
And yes, this is another fucking version where he becomes disfigured during the plot.

15:16.600 --> 15:17.880
His name is Winslow.

15:17.880 --> 15:21.000
He's basically if Elton John and Leonard Cohen had a kid.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.120
It's debatable whether there is a Raoul in this version.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.600
Let's go with no.

15:26.600 --> 15:29.640
But there is an antagonist who competes for the love of Phoenix,

15:29.640 --> 15:31.560
who is the Christine in this version.

15:31.560 --> 15:32.520
And she sucks.

15:35.400 --> 15:36.920
This guy is named Swan,

15:37.000 --> 15:41.480
and he has more in common with Lord Ambrose in the 1962 version.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.560
As for Winslow's character arc,

15:43.560 --> 15:47.320
the punishment that he goes through makes his turn to the crazy

15:47.320 --> 15:49.000
be more than just being,

15:49.000 --> 15:52.840
ah, I'm disfigured, now I'm insane, as we've seen before.

15:52.840 --> 15:56.920
The movie does torture him, but the bizarre comedic tone of it?

15:56.920 --> 15:59.000
Well, I think it makes it work.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.800
But even after all of his mad deeds at the end,

16:01.800 --> 16:04.440
Winslow basically sacrifices himself for Phoenix

16:04.440 --> 16:07.160
and manages to get out of that whole deal with Satan thing.

16:07.160 --> 16:09.640
So he takes it a step further than book Eric,

16:09.640 --> 16:12.920
from letting go the one you love to self-sacrifice.

16:12.920 --> 16:16.280
So, so far, and we will see this also in part two,

16:16.280 --> 16:18.840
here's two major changes we see all the time.

16:18.840 --> 16:21.000
One, he was not born disfigured,

16:21.000 --> 16:24.440
therefore it wasn't a lifetime of crap that made him the way he is,

16:24.440 --> 16:26.200
but he just snapped one day.

16:26.200 --> 16:29.000
And that he does not let Christine go at the end.

16:29.800 --> 16:33.320
So this story is Victorian melodrama.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.880
Everyone is a prodigy, and I'm a mad genius,

16:35.880 --> 16:37.400
and I'm deformed, and I killed people,

16:37.400 --> 16:39.480
and oh, my love could crush mountains,

16:39.480 --> 16:43.000
and I'm gonna blow up the opera house if you don't marry me right now.

16:43.720 --> 16:45.000
Who doesn't relate to that?

16:46.200 --> 16:48.840
Seriously, I mean, the premise is kind of out there,

16:48.840 --> 16:50.520
but the emotions aren't.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.480
This is a story about a deeply toxic relationship,

16:53.480 --> 16:56.360
and how the two major players mature out of it.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.960
And the thing about monsters,

16:57.960 --> 17:00.920
movies like to show you that they are bad monsters for a reason,

17:00.920 --> 17:03.800
but they also like to punish the monster.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.880
Hollywood movies love to reinforce this idea

17:05.880 --> 17:07.960
that there are good people, and bad people,

17:07.960 --> 17:09.640
and bad people get punished,

17:10.280 --> 17:13.320
which is kind of limiting.

17:13.320 --> 17:14.200
Let's say that.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.160
We all have the potential to be monstrous to varying degrees.

17:17.160 --> 17:18.520
Maybe we don't kill people,

17:18.520 --> 17:22.920
but being manipulative, jealous, possessive, reclusive, selfish.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.240
Those are the traits that made Eric monstrous,

17:25.240 --> 17:27.080
and they are also painfully human.

17:27.640 --> 17:30.280
Eric is the way he is because his life has sucked.

17:30.280 --> 17:31.960
All of it, from start to finish.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.480
And that's why I don't like the whole,

17:33.480 --> 17:36.120
and then one day I got acid in the face angle.

17:36.120 --> 17:38.680
I think the Brian De Palma version, Phantom of the Paradise,

17:39.720 --> 17:42.600
came pretty close to tapping into why this character is engaging.

17:42.600 --> 17:45.560
But in all of them, something's missing.

17:46.600 --> 17:50.200
Something that could really just appeal to every midwestern mom,

17:51.080 --> 17:52.360
every teenage girl.

17:53.320 --> 17:57.320
I think we need to take this tragic emotional breakdown of a character,

17:57.320 --> 18:00.200
and make him sexy.

18:00.840 --> 18:04.280
Now, let it be war upon you both.

18:06.040 --> 18:08.200
Or at least try to.
