1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
If you go into the auditorium of the Palais Garnier in Paris, France,

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,800
you'll notice that there's this giant chandelier hanging right over the middle of the orchestra section.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,320
So, on May 20th, 1896, during a performance, a counterweight to this giant chandelier fell

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,000
right through the ceiling and killed a concierge during a performance on her first day of work.

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,220
Yeah.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,640
Some odd years later, a journalist-turned-novelist named Gaston Leroux took this incident and went,

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,000
hey, what if there was some nefarious being behind this whole chandelier thing?

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,120
What if it wasn't a counterweight?

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,480
What if it was the entire chandelier that fell?

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,960
What would motivate such a nefarious being?

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,440
I'm gonna do all this research and write this ballin' mystery novel, and it's gonna be great.

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,080
It's gonna be a classic of modern literature, and it...

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,080
was not.

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,560
At all.

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:48,960
It's not.

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,560
It's not great literature.

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,120
But it certainly merits discussion.

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,280
Phantom of the Opera is no Les Miserables.

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,120
It was not a sensation in its day, and yet it has spawned countless movies, musicals,

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,760
comic books, children's books, TV shows, ice capades, reimaginings including but not limited to

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,920
Phantom of the Megaplex, Phantom of the Ritz, Phantom of Hollywood, Phantom of the Mall,

22
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,200
Phantom of the Paradise, Phantom on Ice, stage versions that are not the Andrew Lloyd Webber

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,080
version, dozens of novel spinoffs, children's books, graphic novels.

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,440
For such a nothing little book, it's had a lot of adaptations.

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,320
But the character of the Phantom varies a lot, from really genuinely engaging to the

26
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,920
most boring thing that's ever dried your brain to a fine powder.

27
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,960
He's evil, he's sympathetic, he's the villain, he's the antihero, sometimes he's even the hero.

28
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:46,000
And owing to my long history of Phantom fandom, I could probably do a 26-part Ken Burns-style

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,560
epic on all of the many facets of this book and its adaptations and who influenced what

30
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,640
and what now, but difficult it is for me not to go on 11 tangents.

31
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,600
This episode is about the character of Eric, and I'm not going to lie and say a lot of

32
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,000
my criticisms don't stem from a nerd rage standpoint, they totally do, but here we go.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,400
Instead of a comprehensive 30-hour dissection, which I could totally do,

34
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,000
we're going to keep it to two parts.

35
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,640
Eric, the Phantom of the Opera, before the musical, and after.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,640
INTRO

37
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,400
The original novel is… pulpy.

38
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,640
It's told from Le Roux's point of view, as a man who's trying to piece together this

39
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,200
mystery that happened 30 years after the fact.

40
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,760
And though you, the modern reader, know from cultural osmosis that yes, there is a Phantom,

41
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,440
the first half of this book is basically a mystery with a ton of red herrings that

42
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,480
are actually pretty tedious from a storytelling standpoint.

43
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,840
Who could the Phantom be?

44
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,240
Is it the stagehand?

45
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,760
Is it the rat catcher?

46
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,960
Is it this Persian fellow who's sneaking about all the time?

47
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,640
And about halfway through the book, we find out that yes, there is indeed a dude who calls

48
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,640
himself the Opera Ghost, and that it's his basically full-time job.

49
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,880
Literally, he even extorts the opera managers to the tune of about 20,000 francs a month.

50
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,360
Mr. Phantom goes by the name of Eric.

51
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,160
No surname.

52
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,200
He's like Madonna.

53
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,240
Eric is described as having the ugliest face of any person who's ever lived.

54
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,160
He basically looks like a death's head.

55
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,440
Sort of a living corpse.

56
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,320
He compensates for this by being an amazing genius at everything.

57
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,760
He's a master musician.

58
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,880
He's a ventriloquist.

59
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,920
He can throw his voice.

60
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,440
He's a genius architect.

61
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,040
He's a master assassin.

62
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,400
And he has the most beautiful voice of any man who's ever lived.

63
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,920
What can't he do?

64
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,920
Well, turns out he's not so good with the ladies, and is a huge drama queen.

65
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,600
Like, oh, my mama didn't love me.

66
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,800
I sleep in a casket.

67
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,160
I have a literal torture chamber in my house for some reason.

68
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,520
Hey, young girl, I'm gonna kidnap you and force you to live in my lair until you fall

69
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,320
in love with me.

70
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,840
That seems reasonable.

71
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,080
The Phantom of the Opera is a Beauty and the Beast tale, but it has more in common with

72
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,920
the myth of Hades and Persephone.

73
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,240
Eric is frequently compared to death-like things in the novel, and he quite literally

74
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,760
lives in an underworld.

75
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,480
And he absconds with this innocent young girl, a novice singer in the opera named Christine.

76
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,240
Speaking to her from behind her mirrors in her dressing room, he tells her, hey, I'm

77
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,720
a literal angel sent to you by your dead father to train you to sing, which she, being super

78
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,840
religious, is like, okay, that sounds legit.

79
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,320
So she's pretty disappointed to find out that he's actually kind of like a crazy,

80
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,600
deformed person.

81
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,080
But Eric is also super jealous of Christine's childhood sweetheart, the Vicomte Raoul de

82
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,560
Chagny, and the novel comes to a head when Raoul and the Persian descend into the Phantom's

83
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,960
underworld to rescue Christine, only immediately to get oopsy-daisy caught in Eric's torture

84
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,920
chamber, which he has.

85
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,200
And Eric thinks this is great, more to blackmail Christine with.

86
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,520
He's like, hey, girl, either you marry me or I'm gonna kill these two and blow up the

87
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,360
entire opera, and both of us.

88
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,280
What a prize.

89
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,960
So let's talk about Eric's character arc, which is the most important aspect of the

90
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,880
story to me, and the thing that most of the adaptations screw the pooch on.

91
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,600
Christine says, okay, I'll marry you, which obviously she really does not want to do,

92
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,760
but will do this incredibly selfless thing if it means saving other people's lives.

93
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,800
But the fact that she does this kind of does him in, and she even kisses him because she

94
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,560
really does feel sorry for him.

95
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,400
And so Eric, surprised and completely done in by her selflessness, lets her, Raoul, and

96
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,600
the Persian go.

97
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,400
She marries Raoul, and Eric dies alone.

98
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,360
And the book ends with the author contending that, despite his deeds, Eric was not an inherently

99
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,520
bad person, and could have been a great person if the world hadn't been so shitty to him,

100
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,480
and that he did not deserve to be demonized, but there were many circumstances, some within

101
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,600
his control, but many not, that made him the way he was, that he wasn't a monster, but

102
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,720
a flawed human.

103
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,480
So that's actually pretty sophisticated moral for a turn-of-the-century pulp horror novel.

104
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,920
Let's see what Hollywood does with that.

105
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:05,200
When you think of Universal Monsters and Phantom of the Opera, this is that version.

106
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,400
In fact, as far as Monster Phantom goes, the Lloyd Webber musical, he's a misunderstood

107
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,720
sex god, so we're not counting that, Lon Chaney's is the definitive version.

108
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,720
This was actually not the first film version.

109
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,520
There was one in 1916, but as is the case with about 90% of all silent films, this one

110
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,080
was lost, and we don't really know all that much about it.

111
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,640
So for the purposes of this little YouTube video, 1925 is the first movie.

112
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:34,000
Like Book Eric, Chaney's Eric is highly emotional and really just a little too upfront

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,880
with his feelings.

114
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,120
Oh good, that's really appealing.

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,840
And she then immediately runs on in the casket he sleeps in, and he's like, yep, it is

116
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,200
what it is, baby.

117
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,520
This movie isn't just important as an adaptation of Phantom of the Opera, but is also a seminal

118
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,160
piece of pop culture and Hollywood history in the horror genre, not to mention a landmark

119
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,960
in makeup and effects work, and well worth checking out.

120
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,000
The scene where Christine first unmasks Eric and then he comes at her, critics at the time

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,880
reported hearing screams in the screening, and some patrons even fainted or left the

122
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,760
theater because they were so horrified by Lon Chaney's makeup.

123
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,120
Although that weird little cloth thing on his mask does detract from his menace a bit.

124
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,560
I wouldn't call it the best of the movie adaptations, except for that ending.

125
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,360
Early in the novel, the corpse of a stagehand named Bouquet, who'd been garrotted, is

126
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,720
found in the cellar.

127
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,080
In the movie, Bouquet's got a brother, and there's an obviously hastily added in, hey,

128
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,400
this guy killed my brother and I found out where he lives offscreen somewhere, ending.

129
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,640
Like in the novel, Christine's like, please let them go, I'll do whatever, and Eric's

130
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,280
like, okay.

131
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,360
And he does let them go.

132
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,360
And then when Christine's petting on Raoul and Eric's over here kinda grumpy and then

133
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,280
busts in the angry mob and suddenly there's a chase scene and we're on a wild carriage

134
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,800
ride and dang.

135
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,920
So obviously in the book, Eric is a lot more sympathetic, but his rival, Raoul, is a lot

136
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,480
less so.

137
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,120
He is a whiny, self-centered little baby.

138
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,440
In the movie, Raoul is more of a conventional, dashing, straightforward movie hero, and Eric

139
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,720
is a monster.

140
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,600
Both of them become less complex, and that element in the original novel that contemplates

141
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,160
on Eric's humanity and what made him into a monster, eh, screw that.

142
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,800
But even so, there's a great case to make for Lon Chaney's Eric as pure and simple

143
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,160
the best performance.

144
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,600
He walks this great fine line of sympathetic, terrifying, childlike, eccentric, and all

145
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,760
through facial expression and body language.

146
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,760
He's really, genuinely horrifying, and yet he's so expressive.

147
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,240
Except for the stupid ending.

148
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,600
Okay, guys, I've got a grenade!

149
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,100
It's...

150
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,760
I'm just kidding.

151
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,680
Hey, we have fun.

152
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,680
It was also originally going to end like the book, and Lon Chaney himself was purportedly

153
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,280
not wild about this change.

154
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,520
But, you know, it's early Hollywood and villainous characters aren't allowed to have, like,

155
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,800
you know, redemption arcs or growth or depth.

156
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,080
So, bye Eric.

157
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,460
Next.

158
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,940
歌谱已经操好了。现在我们先把这歌练起来吧。

159
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,300
This movie is considered one of the greats of early Chinese cinema.

160
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:18,260
It was lost to the ages during the Cultural Revolution, and was only found again in 1998.

161
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,460
This one is a first in the trend of the Phantom getting disfigured after the fact rather than

162
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,100
from birth, which I take slight umbrage with, but we'll get to that.

163
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:33,700
The Phantom in this one is a dude named Song Danping, and Christine in this version appears

164
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:41,460
to be a dude, his name is Song, and promises to train him so that he can sing to Song's

165
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,620
lady love who has been driven mad because she thinks Song is dead.

166
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,580
So, Song teaches Song to sing.

167
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,380
I swear I'm not making this up.

168
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:56,180
This movie has a big subplot about a leftist revolutionary movement, and most of the romance

169
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,500
storyline is told in flashbacks.

170
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,260
Song's lady love is not a singer.

171
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,140
Instead, she's in what appears to be a madhouse.

172
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,380
Song is also a lot more sympathetic than the Cheney version, or even the book version

173
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,540
for that matter, as it really plays up the romance angle and his tragic fall.

174
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,380
Hey, the Phantom was hot at one point.

175
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,980
Although, true to form, our Phantom is a huge drama queen.

176
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,340
And I know this is pretty much par for the course as far as acting in early Chinese cinema

177
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,900
goes, but I'm just saying it works where the Phantom is concerned.

178
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,260
I can't even stand bad feelings.

179
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,500
But even with our more sympathetic Phantom, the movie still ends like the fucking Lon

180
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,180
Chaney movie, and the Christine analog ends up with Song.

181
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,380
But it doesn't matter now.

182
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,860
Nothing matters except you and me, Christine.

183
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,300
Now you sing all you want, but only for me.

184
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:58,660
This was Universal's big, lavish, big-budgeted remake of the 1925 version, but like its

185
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,980
rewrite-addled predecessor, you can kind of see the cracks.

186
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,420
Claude Rains plays Éric Clodin, who's a retiring star violinist at the opera.

187
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,100
In the original screenplay, he was going to be Christine's father, and that's why,

188
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,900
rather than teaching her to sing himself, he spends his life savings on singing lessons

189
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,300
for her.

190
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:23,220
Knowing this makes the movie make more sense, but they cut out the father angle.

191
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,260
So instead, he's just this weird old guy who's oddly fixated on this one girl with

192
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,020
no real context as to why.

193
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,620
You weren't ill, were you?

194
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,100
You're not in any trouble.

195
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,060
But this Phantom also has a tragic life, and he has a super sympathetic backstory up until

196
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,580
he, uh, up and murders a guy over a misunderstanding.

197
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,580
And then we get the acid in the face, and hot damn with the crazy.

198
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,620
I suppose the implication was that this version, he was always kind of on the edge, and then

199
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,300
here was the snapping point.

200
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,540
So when, towards the end, he gets Christine down in his lair, it's like...

201
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,820
I warned them.

202
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,580
I told them there'd be death and destruction if they didn't let you sing.

203
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,020
Well, that escalated quickly.

204
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,420
But then the focus shifts entirely.

205
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,580
After the acid sploosh, Eric isn't in the movie much at all, and for the most part,

206
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,500
we follow the not one but two Raouls, trying to figure out what's going on.

207
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,660
Why is he so obsessed with this girl he's had basically no contact with?

208
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,460
There's a lot of reading between the lines with this Phantom's motivation.

209
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,260
If he is her dad, then why is he not in her life?

210
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,780
If not, what's his deal?

211
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,220
Is he just thinks she's cute?

212
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,100
What made him snap and kill that guy over basically nothing?

213
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,020
Does he have a history of stuff like this?

214
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,980
And that's why he lives alone and tries to stay out of Christine's life?

215
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,340
In the end, the movie just ends abruptly with death by falling rocks,

216
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,900
and everyone just kind of shrugs and moves on.

217
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,540
In the end, I'm left wondering what the filmmakers were even going for.

218
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,480
Next.

219
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,400
I shall teach you.

220
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,920
When you sing, it will be only for me.

221
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,360
This version is trying to be scary, and it's, uh, it's boring.

222
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,240
It's really boring.

223
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,880
There's the theft of his music during slash after his disfigurement, which, yep, once again,

224
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,880
only where in the 1943 version it was a perceived theft,

225
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,160
this time it is a legit theft by the opera.

226
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,920
Also, like in the 43 version, we get not one but two Raouls,

227
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,720
only this time one of the Raouls is a bad guy.

228
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,640
One with a dashing yet boring love interest,

229
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,880
the other's just kind of, you know, rapey,

230
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,120
and I guess he's there to make the Phantom look more sympathetic by comparison.

231
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,960
See, the Phantom may be a total jerkwad,

232
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,080
but at least he's not an attempted rapist like this guy, so.

233
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,640
You are dining with Ambrose Darcy tonight.

234
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,200
Be warned, he's a vile and vicious man.

235
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,280
Don't let him be creepy and possessive.

236
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,360
Let me be creepy and possessive.

237
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,880
This is also the only version where the chandelier fall is an accident,

238
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,760
and rather than causing it, he pushes Christine to safety,

239
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,080
sacrificing himself, and that's how the movie ends.

240
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,280
So it's interesting to note that of the ones we've covered,

241
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,000
the American versions all have a monstrous villainous Eric getting punished at the end,

242
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,440
and the non-American ones have a more sympathetic, complex version.

243
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,880
This one is British.

244
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,200
That's not to say a more complex take isn't doable by American filmmakers,

245
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,520
but maybe it just needs to be done outside of the studio system.

246
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,480
Have you ever seen my music again?

247
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,600
Not here, not anywhere, do you understand?

248
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,480
Never again.

249
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,640
Phantom of the Paradise takes place in a sort of surreal alternate universe

250
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,640
at a club called The Paradise.

251
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,040
It's one of Brian De Palma's earliest movies.

252
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,360
It's a musical, and it's probably the best of all of the Phantom movies,

253
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,440
and it's also probably my favorite De Palma.

254
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:40,840
Easy.

255
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,680
Say what you want about Phantom of the Paradise,

256
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,280
it knows what it's about.

257
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,440
This movie is in for a penny, in for a pound.

258
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,440
But I'm innocent!

259
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,480
Swan stole my music and framed me!

260
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,080
In a way, it's more of an adaptation of Faust than Phantom of the Opera,

261
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,000
Faust being the opera in the original novel that Christine makes her debut in.

262
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,040
Like the 1943 and 1962 versions,

263
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,600
this one has the theft of my beautiful music and then I got disfigured thing going on.

264
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,320
Unlike in those versions, there's also a selling my soul to Satan thing going on.

265
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,600
And yes, this is another fucking version where he becomes disfigured during the plot.

266
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,880
His name is Winslow.

267
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,000
He's basically if Elton John and Leonard Cohen had a kid.

268
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,120
It's debatable whether there is a Raoul in this version.

269
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,600
Let's go with no.

270
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,640
But there is an antagonist who competes for the love of Phoenix,

271
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,560
who is the Christine in this version.

272
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,520
And she sucks.

273
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,920
This guy is named Swan,

274
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,480
and he has more in common with Lord Ambrose in the 1962 version.

275
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,560
As for Winslow's character arc,

276
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,320
the punishment that he goes through makes his turn to the crazy

277
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,000
be more than just being,

278
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,840
ah, I'm disfigured, now I'm insane, as we've seen before.

279
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,920
The movie does torture him, but the bizarre comedic tone of it?

280
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,000
Well, I think it makes it work.

281
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,800
But even after all of his mad deeds at the end,

282
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,440
Winslow basically sacrifices himself for Phoenix

283
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,160
and manages to get out of that whole deal with Satan thing.

284
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,640
So he takes it a step further than book Eric,

285
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,920
from letting go the one you love to self-sacrifice.

286
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,280
So, so far, and we will see this also in part two,

287
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,840
here's two major changes we see all the time.

288
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,000
One, he was not born disfigured,

289
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,440
therefore it wasn't a lifetime of crap that made him the way he is,

290
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,200
but he just snapped one day.

291
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,000
And that he does not let Christine go at the end.

292
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,320
So this story is Victorian melodrama.

293
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,880
Everyone is a prodigy, and I'm a mad genius,

294
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,400
and I'm deformed, and I killed people,

295
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,480
and oh, my love could crush mountains,

296
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,000
and I'm gonna blow up the opera house if you don't marry me right now.

297
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,000
Who doesn't relate to that?

298
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,840
Seriously, I mean, the premise is kind of out there,

299
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,520
but the emotions aren't.

300
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,480
This is a story about a deeply toxic relationship,

301
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,360
and how the two major players mature out of it.

302
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,960
And the thing about monsters,

303
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,920
movies like to show you that they are bad monsters for a reason,

304
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,800
but they also like to punish the monster.

305
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,880
Hollywood movies love to reinforce this idea

306
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,960
that there are good people, and bad people,

307
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,640
and bad people get punished,

308
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,320
which is kind of limiting.

309
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,200
Let's say that.

310
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,160
We all have the potential to be monstrous to varying degrees.

311
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,520
Maybe we don't kill people,

312
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,920
but being manipulative, jealous, possessive, reclusive, selfish.

313
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,240
Those are the traits that made Eric monstrous,

314
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,080
and they are also painfully human.

315
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,280
Eric is the way he is because his life has sucked.

316
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,960
All of it, from start to finish.

317
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,480
And that's why I don't like the whole,

318
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,120
and then one day I got acid in the face angle.

319
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,680
I think the Brian De Palma version, Phantom of the Paradise,

320
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,600
came pretty close to tapping into why this character is engaging.

321
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,560
But in all of them, something's missing.

322
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,200
Something that could really just appeal to every midwestern mom,

323
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,360
every teenage girl.

324
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,320
I think we need to take this tragic emotional breakdown of a character,

325
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,200
and make him sexy.

326
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,280
Now, let it be war upon you both.

327
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,200
Or at least try to.
