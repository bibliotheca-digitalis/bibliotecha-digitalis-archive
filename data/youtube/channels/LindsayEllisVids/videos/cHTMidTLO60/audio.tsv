0	2560	The trope seems to originate in 1960
2560	4520	with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.
4520	5480	That's just my guess, though.
5480	6680	I haven't researched this.
6680	8480	Who do you think I am, Lindsay Ellis?
10880	14160	Well, it would appear that I have been summoned.
14160	18440	So since this topic is never gonna go away, apparently,
18440	20240	ContraPoints and I were, you know,
20240	23080	planning on doing, like, a collab of sorts.
23080	23920	But the thing is, like,
23920	25120	both of us are really bad at scheduling
25120	28060	and we couldn't, like, really figure anything out.
28100	31180	And then someone sniped, like, half my talking points.
31180	32020	I don't know.
32020	32860	I figure this topic is, like,
32860	34300	half of all we ever talk about,
34300	36100	so we may as well monetize it, you know?
36100	38100	So, do you wanna collab on the Psycho part?
38100	41180	Or do you, why don't I do the Psycho part?
41180	42700	I'm gonna do the Psycho part.
42700	43540	It's happening.
43540	44360	Whore.
44360	46020	So, you know what that means.
46020	47060	That's right.
47060	49340	This is a feud.
49340	50580	A YouTuber feud.
50580	51900	That's right, we're feuding.
51900	54140	Leave us a comment for who you think should win.
54140	55820	And, you know, this isn't, like, a regular feud.
55820	57660	This is, like, a cool feud.
58060	59940	This feud has merchandise.
59940	60780	No, really.
60780	62640	You can go to my store and buy one of these two pins
62640	64980	based on who you think should win the feud.
64980	67140	Whoever sells the most pins wins.
67140	70660	And 100% of the profits for these pins will go to
70660	73820	The aptly named Sir Not Appearing in this film.
74780	76820	Yeah, so the last time I named which charity
76820	79380	I was going to give merchandise profits to,
79380	81620	they got threatened with legal action.
81620	84820	And because the EFF worked in collusion with Lindsay Ellis
84820	86720	to create the monetized video,
86720	90000	the EFF is also culpable for the copyright infringement
90000	91120	and the defamation.
91120	96120	So yeah, it's unnamed charity benefiting trans youths.
97040	98480	You know, a variety of them.
98480	99600	A melange.
99600	101440	A rainbow, you might say.
101440	103100	This is why we can't have nice things.
103100	105240	So I did a Death of the Author addendum last year
105240	107240	after a bunch of people asked me questions
107240	109160	about the applicability of Death of the Author
109160	111440	to the works of one Joanne Rowling
111440	114520	in light of her new philosophy.
114560	117320	When you throw open the doors of bathrooms
117320	119480	and changing rooms to any man who believes
119480	121120	or feels he's a woman,
121120	123560	and as I've said, gender confirmation certificates
123560	126920	may not be granted without any need for surgery or hormones,
126920	129160	then you open the door to any and all men
129160	130720	who wish to come inside.
130720	132680	Which led to all sorts of fun feedback
132680	135480	from viewers of other fine YouTube channels,
135480	139480	such as reader of books, Vanessa LeBlanc.
139480	140800	The opinions you're going to hear today
140800	142880	are from someone who is not just, you know,
142880	145040	on Twitter, hearing what other people have to say
145040	146160	and hopping on a bandwagon.
146160	148160	This is because I read the book.
149220	150400	She totally read it.
150400	153560	At the very most, the concept of being a transvestite
153560	158560	makes a very quick, brief, fleeting appearance in the book,
159440	161560	and it's extremely unimportant.
161560	164440	It comes in the form of one line in the book,
164440	167840	one page in a 900-page book.
167840	170960	And master of cell phones, Gary of Swendon.
170960	173200	Society is built around the interactions
173200	175680	between men and women, and so it's not surprising
175680	177800	that they would have quite a formalized
177800	180920	and baked-in set of rules.
180920	183080	Five minutes later.
183080	187120	Why would we need to do anything in its purest, pure form?
187120	190800	What has Lindsay Ellis ever done in her entire life
190800	192720	that was of the purest, pure form?
192720	194120	The answer is nothing.
194120	197180	It's not gonna be exactly as it should be conceptually,
197180	198980	but you just have to deal with that.
201880	203480	I'm just gonna say, I haven't read this book.
203480	205280	I don't even know if it's out yet, actually.
205280	208280	Although my personal favorite came from one of Gary's fans
208280	211760	who emailed me to scold me because they thought
211760	216240	that death of the author meant I was literally advocating
216240	218900	for the murder of J.K. Rowling.
220040	221080	The thinkery.
222500	225480	So much of the chicanery stemmed from a misrepresentation
225480	228840	of J.K.'s argument, which is that she's just stating
228840	230560	biology, you guys.
231120	233200	She's not denying people's humanity.
233200	236160	I don't hate trans people, but what is wrong
236160	240440	with the trans activists that they think biology isn't real?
240440	243560	J.K.R. is being canceled for stating a fact?
243560	247080	Well, that's just canceled culture run amok.
247080	249040	But while a huge component against discrimination
249040	251640	against trans people is biological in nature,
251640	254600	namely the denial of healthcare and medical gatekeeping,
254600	257640	it is, in this context, completely besides the point.
257640	259440	No one is saying biology isn't real.
259440	262440	That's why the healthcare thing is such a big deal.
263680	264960	Because of the biology.
264960	267800	So for some people to reframe this discussion
267800	270160	like trans activists are denying biology
270160	273600	and that they are simply in their thinker, thinkery ways
273600	275840	arguing against this obvious falsehood,
275840	278720	well, that is how Sharon and Mike from Dayton, Ohio
278720	280560	will first understand the argument.
280560	284140	Joanne and Vanessa and Gary arguing against a point
284140	287560	that no one is making, but since that's the point
287560	290440	that Sharon and Mike are seeing argued against,
290440	292400	that is what Sharon and Mike think
292400	295840	that the trans activists actually believe.
295840	297760	So as with a lot of reactionary movements,
297760	299560	much of the anti-trans ideology
299560	303000	is rooted in an appeal to common sense.
303000	304600	And there really is something to this idea
304600	307080	of using common sense as a rhetorical device.
307080	309760	If a new or challenging idea is presented,
309760	311520	all you need to do is look at the camera
311520	314040	and be like, common sense, am I right?
314040	317480	And it's effective because by appealing to common sense,
318320	319160	the viewer slash reader doesn't need
319160	321040	to challenge preconceptions.
321040	322760	Like this cholera outbreak,
322760	326000	common sense says it's the miasma.
326000	328560	Germ theory, you can't even see those.
328560	330960	Which is why all of these debates are so frustrating
330960	332580	because to the Ben Shapiros
332580	334400	and the Joanne Rowlings of the world,
334400	338120	trans people existing doesn't have anything to do with them
338120	340840	or their lives, but there is something inherently
340840	343560	threatening about their acceptance by society.
343560	346160	So they have to make up scenarios
346160	349080	where it does have things to do with them.
349080	351020	And they try to sell these scenarios
351020	354440	with a very shallow brand of common sense.
354440	356460	What if penis in bathroom?
356460	359080	What if I'm dating one and I get tricked?
359080	361840	And of course, that old reactionary classic,
361840	364460	won't someone think of the children?
364460	366360	So won't someone think of the children
366360	368920	is a staple of every reactionary movement.
368920	370800	If society progresses one inch,
370800	374520	reactionaries are going to use the children as a shield.
374520	376120	The ancients among us might remember,
376120	378420	it wasn't that long ago that that was the argument
378420	379840	used against gay marriage.
379840	381920	How am I supposed to explain to my child?
381920	384600	Hang your shitty child for all I care.
384600	386440	McKaylee will just have to figure out
386440	388000	how to navigate a world where the gays
388000	390720	are allowed to kiss in public on her own.
390720	392640	Yes, if you steal my shit, I'm allowed to steal your shit.
392640	393960	That's how it works, whore.
393960	395480	So what people hear when they see these
395480	398640	very intellectually honest thinkers
398640	401320	decrying the cancellation of JK Rowling
401320	404400	is that all Joanne said was that biological sex is real.
405280	406800	And that trans people are being mean to her on the internet
406800	410200	because she was just stating a simple scientific fact, guys.
410200	412360	And all of this stems from an essay Joanne wrote
412360	415000	back in June called Turf Wars,
415000	418680	in which she explained why she was so deeply concerned
418680	421000	about the encroaching menace of trans rights.
421000	422600	Her essay was even awarded
422600	425320	the 2020 Russell Prize by the BBC.
425320	427360	So now we know you can win awards for essays
427360	429000	that have sections ranging from
429000	432160	wild misrepresentations of the truth to flat out lies.
432160	433620	And so for those of you who haven't read it,
433620	435380	which I'm guessing is most of you,
435380	438660	here is a quick rundown of the point she makes in her essay.
438660	440620	I was canceled for liking some tweets
440620	441940	and then standing up for this woman
441940	444800	whose place of employment declined to renew her contract
444800	446100	after her contract expired
446100	448500	because she was a dick to a trans coworker.
448500	450660	For people who don't know,
450660	454580	last December I tweeted my support for Maya Forstater,
454580	457540	a tax specialist who'd lost her job
457540	460620	for what were deemed transphobic tweets.
460620	463300	She took her case to an employment tribunal
463300	466100	asking the judge to rule on whether a philosophical belief
466100	469820	that sex is determined by biology is protected in law.
469820	473220	Judge Taylor ruled that it wasn't.
473220	475740	Here is incidentally what the judge actually said.
475740	478160	I conclude from the totality of the evidence
478160	480700	that Forstater is absolutist in her view of sex
480700	482860	and it is a core component of her belief
482860	484460	that she will refer to a person
484460	486420	by the sex she considers appropriate
486420	488540	even if it violates their dignity
488540	491840	and or creates an intimidating, hostile, degrading,
491880	494280	humiliating, or offensive environment.
494280	496160	The approach is not worthy of respect
496160	498240	in a democratic society.
498240	499400	The erosion of gender norms
499400	501680	negatively affects charities I run
501680	503140	because I might accidentally give money
503140	505340	to a trans domestic abuse survivor
505340	508560	or something about multiple sclerosis.
508560	510600	Think of the children.
510600	513120	I'm an advocate for free speech.
513120	516200	Too many girls who are being brainwashed by the gay agenda,
516200	518880	I mean, radical trans activists,
518880	520160	and they don't actually know what they want
520160	521000	and girls are transitioning
521000	522560	because of internalized misogyny.
522560	524120	Think of the children.
524120	525260	If I was a child today,
525260	527500	I might have fallen in with the wrong crowd
527500	529120	and gotten transed.
530800	532400	Like it's the Crips.
533320	534720	Snoop Dogg over here like.
534720	537080	♪ I keep a black flag hanging on my backside ♪
537080	539880	♪ But only on the left side, yeah that's the side. ♪
539880	541720	Long beach in the house.
541720	543700	Yes, I know Snoop is a problematic.
543700	546080	Leave me a comment about how Snoop is a...
546080	548840	Our once robust gatekeeping systems are being eroded
548840	550480	and now anyone can say I'm a woman
550480	552120	and be recognized as such in the eyes of the law
552120	553680	and I feel threatened by that.
553680	555960	The world is misogynist and porn is bad.
555960	558920	Trans occlusive language is misogynist, actually.
558920	560080	I was an abuse survivor,
560080	562460	so the idea of male-bodied persons
562460	564280	in the bathroom triggers me.
564280	565280	On Saturday morning,
565280	567560	I read that the Scottish government is proceeding
567560	570760	with its controversial gender recognition plans,
570760	573200	which will in effect mean that all a man needs
573200	576840	to become a woman is to say he's one.
576840	579480	To use a very contemporary word,
579480	581680	I was triggered.
581680	583320	I couldn't shut out those memories
583320	585720	and I was finding it hard to contain my anger
585720	588320	and disappointment about the way I believe my government
588320	592120	is playing fast and loose with women's and girls' safety.
592120	594220	This visceral fear reaction was in response
594220	598400	to the Scottish government making transition less gatekeepy.
598400	601040	Men in women's spaces is putting natal women
601040	602520	and girls in danger.
602520	604760	Gender criticals are nice, actually,
604760	607320	and they don't hate the transes.
607320	610300	And finally, think of the children.
611940	613160	Okay.
613160	616640	It would be so much easier to tweet the approved hashtags
616640	618880	because of course trans rights are human rights
618880	621080	and of course trans lives matter.
621080	623480	Scoop up the woke cookies
623480	626720	and bask in a virtue signaling afterglow.
626720	631200	There's joy, relief, and safety in conformity.
631200	632760	Come on, Snoop, work with us.
632760	633640	So I need to make it clear
633640	636040	that I do not care about Joanne Rowling.
636040	637880	I do not care about saving her soul.
637880	639720	I don't care about canceling her.
639720	641840	What I do care about is her influence,
641840	644120	which is why we have to discuss this at all.
644120	645760	But in the context of this video,
645760	648680	I am more interested in why these beliefs
648680	651520	are even in her head in the first place.
651520	654480	Like, where did her belief that trans women
654480	658280	are gonna do a bunch of bathroom assaults even come from?
658280	660400	Because it wasn't reality.
660400	663000	Was it then the movies?
663000	665720	Well, that's a complicated question,
666760	668520	but the answer is yes.
668520	670880	The mother half took over completely.
670880	672480	He was never all Norman,
673440	675960	but he was often only mother.
675960	678640	Why was he dressed like that?
678640	680080	He's a transvestite.
680080	683760	I did not know that the Bates Motel was in California.
683760	685200	Just like us, Snoop.
685200	687800	So before we jump into the roots of transphobic tropes,
687800	689000	we must first acknowledge
689000	691960	that the understanding of sex and gender
691960	693800	is always kind of in flux.
693800	696240	It is a theory that is always evolving.
696240	698640	That said, some very good faith actors
698640	699480	tend to get caught up
699480	702360	in this very hyper-literal interpretation of media,
702360	704880	i.e. a depiction cannot be transphobic
704880	705920	if the depiction in question
705920	707680	is not of a literal trans person.
707680	709440	Now, people are calling the book transphobic
709440	710280	because of this,
710280	713240	because it has a character who is a cis man
713240	715960	who dresses as a woman when killing his victim.
715960	717840	And no, honey, that's not how it works.
717840	719760	While the idea of cross-dressing men
719760	722360	may not be an accurate reflection of trans identity
722360	723800	as we conceive it today,
723800	726520	it certainly influenced the mainstream understanding
726520	728840	of what trans identity even is.
728840	731320	So a lot of the characters that we are going to talk about
731320	734280	are not trans as we'd consider them.
734280	736040	When a straight man puts on a dress
736040	739440	and gets his sexual kicks, he is a transvestite.
739440	742440	When a man is a woman trapped in a man's body
742440	745680	and has the little operation, he is a transsexual.
745680	746520	I know that.
746520	749320	And before we go any further, big old content warning,
749880	750720	because it is one thing to kind of, you know,
750720	752160	know about the tropes,
752160	754960	but to like see them in rapid fire succession,
756040	757560	you know, it's a lot.
758600	760840	Like, I don't even have any skin in the game
760840	763200	and it's still a lot.
763200	767320	So here's your warning.
767320	768240	In Western culture,
768240	770120	cross-dressing has often been used
770120	771840	as a shorthand for deception,
771840	774320	but not always maliciously so.
774320	776000	In fact, for most of history,
776000	778880	cross-dressing men are portrayed as neutral
778880	780920	or more often comical.
780920	783040	In the Iliad, Achilles tries to get out of war
783040	784160	by dressing as a woman,
784160	785360	but Odysseus figures him out
785360	787000	when he gives Achilles a gift of perfume
787000	789120	and Achilles doesn't lose his shit over the gift,
789120	791000	you know, like women do.
791000	792240	In Shakespeare's Twelfth Night,
792240	794880	protagonist Viola takes up service for Duke Orsinio
794880	797080	disguised as a young man named Cesario.
797080	798560	After some comic misunderstanding
798560	799920	and then lots of cross-dressing,
799920	802240	Viola's identity is revealed and it's fine,
802240	804400	compulsory heterosexuality all around.
804400	806600	The benign cross-dresser motif remained popular
806600	807920	well into the 20th century
807920	810240	with entries like Bosom Buddies, Tootsie,
810240	814200	Some Like It Hot, and White Chicks.
814200	818200	♪ And I need you, and I miss you ♪
819720	821840	Billy Wilder's classic comedy Some Like It Hot
821840	824200	in particular depicts a fun, harmless version
824200	827000	of the very scenario Joanne seems so worried about.
827000	829480	I feel naked, I feel like everybody's staring at me.
829480	831080	With those legs, are you crazy?
831080	831920	Now come on.
831920	835320	Men dressing up as women to gain access to women's spaces.
835320	837760	Now in this film, it's because the two men are in hiding.
837760	839400	Two musicians witness a mob hit,
839400	841880	so they dress up as women and join an all-female band
841880	843280	to disguise themselves.
843280	845360	Both of them fall for the band's lead vocalist,
845360	847600	Sugar Cane, played by Marilyn Monroe.
847600	848800	Well, see you around, girl.
848800	849920	Bye, sugar.
849920	851360	And compete for her affections
851360	853440	despite her thinking that they're women.
853440	854920	No butter, no pastry.
854920	855880	We're on a diet.
855880	857200	Oh yeah, well, sure.
857200	859120	But Some Like It Hot is not only considered
859120	861360	to be one of the greatest comedies of all time,
861360	864240	its freewheeling approach to gender and even sexuality
864240	866400	is widely considered to be the nail in the coffin
866400	867360	for the Hays Code,
867360	869040	as it was released without its approval
869040	871000	and was a huge success anyway.
871000	872280	The deception is revealed at the end
872280	874960	with no hard feelings and an ending that...
874960	876760	I'm good on level with you.
876760	878320	We can't get married at all.
878320	879160	Why not?
880840	882360	I'm a man.
882360	884400	Well, nobody's perfect.
884400	887000	Well, I wouldn't even call this a happy hetero ending.
888000	890000	I use the example of Some Like It Hot
890000	891840	to illustrate that even in the 1950s,
891840	893360	a time of heightened anxiety
893360	895320	over all things gender and sexuality,
895320	896480	Kinsey,
896480	899240	cross-dressing wasn't considered inherently deviant.
899240	900920	However, in all of the above examples,
900920	903800	the male protagonist's heterosexuality is not in question.
903800	905480	The joke is that we, the audience,
905480	907560	know the hero's true nature,
907560	909400	but the other characters do not.
909400	910840	But the more, shall we say,
910840	912960	influential representation of cross-dressing
912960	914560	to Joanne's concerns
914560	917600	also involves discovery about the truth
917600	919280	of a character's body.
919280	923480	Such revelation, however, is not comic, but horrific.
923480	926280	So, what changed?
926280	930280	♪♪♪♪♪
930280	932880	Ed Gein was born in Wisconsin in 1906,
932880	934800	the son of an abusive alcoholic father
934800	936680	and a domineering, hyper-religious mother
936680	939520	who only let her kids leave their remote property for school,
939520	941120	even going so far as to punish Ed
941120	942520	when he tried to make friends.
942520	943720	Ed's mother, Agatha,
943720	945680	was a hellfire and brimstone preacher
945680	946880	who preached to her sons
946880	948800	about the innate immorality of the world,
948800	950080	the evils of drinking,
950080	952840	and her belief that all women, apart from herself,
952840	954080	were naturally promiscuous
954080	955480	and the instruments of the devil.
955480	958400	When she died in 1945, Ed was devastated.
958400	960120	In the words of one of his biographers,
960120	963320	he had lost his only friend and one true love.
963320	966040	On the morning of November 16th, 1957,
966040	969600	Plainfield hardware store owner Bernice Worden disappeared.
969600	970600	Later that evening,
970600	972360	the Washara County Sheriff's Department
972640	974440	discovered Worden's decapitated body
974440	976960	in a shed on Ed Gein's property,
976960	978720	hung upside down by her legs
978720	980320	with a crossbar at her ankles
980320	982000	and ropes at her wrists,
982000	983840	dressed out like a deer.
983840	985720	Gein not only admitted to the murders of Worden
985720	987160	and at least one other woman,
987160	990000	he'd also spent the last decade digging up graves
990000	991680	and exhuming the corpses of women
991680	993720	who looked like his mother.
993720	994880	He took the bodies home
994880	998000	where he tanned their skins to make his paraphernalia.
998000	999720	This paraphernalia included,
999720	1001320	but was not limited to,
1001320	1003680	a waist basket made of human skin,
1003680	1005800	chair seats made out of human skin,
1005800	1007560	a corset made from a female torso
1007560	1009360	skinned from the shoulders to the waist,
1009360	1011480	leggings made from human skin,
1011480	1013880	masks made from the skin of female heads,
1013880	1016640	a lampshade made from the skin of a human face.
1016640	1017680	You get the idea.
1017680	1020000	There are other more infamous killers, sure,
1020000	1023240	but none seem to be so inspiring.
1023240	1025760	The country was fascinated by Ed Gein,
1025760	1028280	particularly the type of menace he represented,
1028280	1031200	a sexual deviant, an Oedipal nightmare,
1031200	1033160	depicted in the press as a feminine
1033160	1035120	and gender confused man.
1035120	1037400	Here, the guise of femininity does not hide
1037400	1040320	or empower a clever heterosexual man,
1040320	1042200	but reveals a sexual deviant,
1042200	1044800	a man in gender distress.
1044800	1053200	Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho changed cinema in a lot of ways,
1053200	1055240	and deservedly so, in my opinion.
1055240	1056840	It's my favorite Hitchcock film.
1056840	1059560	Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh are iconic in their roles
1059560	1061760	as Norman Bates and Marion Crane.
1061760	1063800	Techniques that may seem like old hat now
1063800	1066480	seem that way because Hitchcock was the originator.
1066480	1068160	We all go a little mad sometimes.
1068160	1072760	Haven't you?
1072760	1075320	The plot revolves around the murder of Marion Crane,
1075320	1076680	who stops at the Bates Motel
1076680	1078920	after stealing a bunch of money from her workplace.
1078920	1080480	While staying at the Bates Motel,
1080480	1082120	Marion realizes her mistake
1082120	1084520	and decides to go back to her workplace to make amends,
1084520	1085640	but before she can...
1086440	1089960	Ow! Ow! No! Ow!
1089960	1092240	...she's murdered by Norman's mother.
1092240	1094560	Of course, the twist at the end is that Norman's mother
1094560	1096640	is actually Norman Bates in drag.
1096640	1098440	The film does not reveal Norman's identity
1098440	1101080	as murderer and crossdresser until the end,
1101080	1103440	in a scene that admittedly did not age well.
1103440	1108640	Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat!
1108640	1110040	It would be accurate to say
1110040	1112040	that this isn't even really crossdressing.
1112040	1113840	It's a transvestite.
1113840	1115440	Uh, not exactly.
1115440	1116640	Like Ed Gein before him,
1116640	1119240	Norman is diagnosed with a schizotypal disorder.
1119240	1120840	He doesn't want to be a woman.
1120840	1122240	He just hears voices.
1122240	1125640	He quite literally believes he is his mother.
1125640	1130040	Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly.
1130040	1131840	But in terms of things that literally
1131840	1133440	actually happen on the screen,
1133440	1136640	Psycho is a film about a man dressing as a woman
1136640	1138840	while he predates on other women.
1138840	1141440	First, he leers at them in a way that makes it seem
1142440	1144640	First, he leers at them in the bathroom,
1144640	1146440	and then he kills them in the bathroom.
1146440	1149440	And he predates on women because they are women,
1149440	1151440	specifically because the mother personality
1151440	1153840	is threatened by Norman's attraction to them.
1153840	1155240	Mother, she's just a stranger.
1155240	1157040	She's hungry and it's raining out.
1157040	1159240	Mother, she's just a stranger.
1159240	1161840	But it's men who desire strangers.
1161840	1164640	And where is this most iconic of movie scenes set
1164640	1166240	where this woman is preyed upon,
1166240	1168640	but the place where she is most vulnerable?
1168640	1170040	The bathroom.
1172440	1174440	Thus, it is the figure of Ed Gein
1174440	1176440	and his fictional counterpart, Norman Bates,
1176440	1178440	who have captured the imagination of filmmakers
1178440	1181040	and novelists rather than other serial killers.
1181040	1184440	Because Psycho is inspired by real-life events, right?
1184440	1186440	This idea of the cross-dressing serial killer
1186440	1189840	wasn't made up out of whole cloth, right?
1189840	1190640	It was.
1190640	1193040	Life magazine, which ran an eight-page pictorial
1193040	1194240	sporting the headline,
1194240	1196240	House of Horror Stuns the Nation,
1196240	1197840	two weeks after Gein's arrest,
1197840	1200440	announced that Gein wished he were a woman
1201040	1202640	After an unidentified investigator
1202640	1205240	supplied the Milwaukee Journal with information on Gein,
1205240	1207440	the November 21st issue of the journal ran a story
1207440	1210440	claiming that Gein's unnatural attachment to his mother
1210440	1212240	caused an Oedipus complex
1212240	1214640	that resulted in Ed wishing he had been a woman
1214640	1215640	instead of a man
1215640	1217240	and wondering whether it would be possible
1217240	1218440	to change his sex.
1218440	1220440	He considered inquiring about an operation
1220440	1221440	to change into a woman
1221440	1224240	and even thought about trying the operation upon himself,
1224240	1226040	but did nothing about such plans.
1226040	1227240	But here's the thing.
1227240	1228840	None of it is true.
1228840	1230040	All of these are slipped to the press
1230040	1233040	before any real psychoanalysis of the Gein had been done
1233040	1235840	and none of the psychiatrists who actually analyzed him
1235840	1238040	concluded that he had any sort of tendencies
1238040	1240840	towards transvestism or even homosexuality.
1240840	1244040	Indeed, he seemed pretty honking straight
1244040	1248640	and resented women just like most serial killers do.
1248640	1251440	Thus, in part, Gein's infamy resided in an indication
1251440	1253240	that he was not fully masculine
1253240	1256640	in an era that was obsessed with proper forms of masculinity.
1256640	1258840	Ed Gein is remembered as effeminate,
1258840	1261440	a transvestite, or transsexual,
1261440	1265640	as well as the narrative trope that explained his psychosis.
1265640	1267440	And Ed Gein and the character of Norman Bates
1267440	1270240	are often cited as the first examples of this trope,
1270240	1273240	but that's actually not entirely true either.
1273240	1275240	The book Gender-Bending Detective Fiction
1275240	1277640	cites the 1950 detective novel
1277640	1280640	Vengeance is Mine by Frank Morris and Spillane,
1280640	1282840	which centers around a transgender killer
1282840	1285040	who the detective has felt some attraction to,
1285240	1286640	as an earlier example,
1286640	1288440	and that was published seven years
1288440	1290640	before Ed Gein even got caught.
1290640	1294040	So, Gein and Psycho may have been the codifiers,
1294040	1295840	but they weren't the first example
1295840	1298040	of the murderous crossdresser.
1298040	1301440	That idea was already there
1301440	1305040	because the anxiety over gender roles was already there.
1305040	1306240	Gen Z.
1306240	1308640	We just needed an excuse to make hay out of it.
1308640	1311840	So, thanks, Ed Gein.
1311840	1313240	According to Richard Tithicott,
1313240	1314840	author of Men and Monsters,
1314840	1317640	Jeffrey Dahmer, and the Construction of the Serial Killer,
1317640	1319840	we fail to read the serial killer accurately
1319840	1323440	because he is an embodiment of society's dominant values.
1323440	1326040	As a culture, we are so unable to admit or recognize
1326040	1328640	the connection between our dominant forms of masculinity
1328640	1330440	and violent misogynist crimes
1330440	1332840	that we must attribute some other kind of motive to them
1332840	1334240	besides masculinity.
1334240	1337240	Instead, motive is attributed to perceived gender deviance,
1337240	1339040	in particular, the men coveting
1339040	1340840	or assuming the mantle of femininity
1340840	1344640	through gender identification or homosexual object choice.
1344640	1346440	What is the first and principal thing he does?
1346440	1349840	What needs does he serve by killing?
1349840	1352840	Acceptance in sexual frustrations.
1352840	1355840	No, he covets.
1355840	1358240	The 70s and 80s saw an explosion of films
1358240	1359640	featuring all sorts of plays
1359640	1361640	on the murderous crossdresser trope,
1361640	1363240	with titles like
1363240	1364640	Deadly Blessing,
1364640	1366440	No Way to Treat a Lady,
1366440	1369040	Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde,
1369040	1370240	Deranged,
1370240	1371640	Homicidal,
1371640	1372840	Private Parts,
1372840	1374040	not that Private Parts,
1374040	1375640	Stripped to Kill,
1375640	1377240	Three on a Meat Hook,
1377240	1378640	Relentless,
1378640	1379440	Three.
1379440	1381040	And of course, the most infamous of these
1381040	1384240	is Brian De Palma's psycho ripoff, Dressed to Kill,
1384240	1386640	wherein the killer isn't incidentally a crossdresser,
1386640	1387440	like Norman Bates,
1387440	1389640	but a canon transsexual.
1389640	1391240	You see, there's some men and women, too,
1391240	1392840	think they're born in the wrong body.
1392840	1394440	They're called transsexuals.
1394440	1397240	And all they want to do is have their sex changed.
1397240	1399240	Most include elements of the Gein mythos,
1399240	1402040	stealing women's body parts after the deed is done,
1402040	1403840	gender confusion,
1403840	1405640	which brings us to,
1405640	1406840	of course,
1406840	1408840	the act you've all been waiting for.
1411640	1412840	Goodbye.
1418840	1421040	So, Silence of the Lambs,
1421040	1422640	like Psycho before it,
1422640	1424440	has the problem of
1424440	1426240	being one of the best movies ever made.
1426240	1427240	God damn it.
1427240	1429240	See, this is why good movies are dangerous.
1429240	1429840	This is...
1429840	1431040	All movies are bad.
1432040	1433240	Isn't that right, Snoop?
1433240	1436040	You regret Mac and Devin go to high school, don't you?
1441640	1444040	Silence of the Lambs is the story of Clarice Starling,
1444040	1445640	a student at the FBI Academy
1445640	1447040	who's on the verge of becoming an agent
1447040	1448640	when she's tasked with profiling
1448640	1451040	the cannibal serial killer Hannibal Lecter.
1451040	1454440	I ate his liver with some fava beans
1454440	1456440	and a nice Chianti.
1457840	1459640	Pfft.
1459640	1461640	Hannibal has no interest in being profiled,
1461640	1464640	but he takes a liking to Clarice in his sociopath way,
1464640	1465840	and he starts giving her clues
1465840	1468240	to help solve the real active serial killer case
1468240	1469440	going on in the world,
1469440	1470840	that of Buffalo Bill,
1470840	1472440	so named because he...
1472440	1474240	Likes to skin his humps.
1474240	1475640	...gender and power dynamics
1475640	1477640	are very much at the heart of the film,
1477640	1480240	which deliberately sort of flips the male gaze.
1480240	1481640	Her boss doesn't respect her,
1481640	1483440	her colleagues leer at her,
1483440	1485440	others in position of authority turn cold
1485440	1487840	when she politely refuses their advances.
1487840	1489440	You know, we get a lot of detectives here,
1489440	1492440	but I must say, I can't ever remember one as attractive.
1495440	1498440	Only Barney, one of the orderlies at the mental institution,
1498440	1500840	and Hannibal Lecter, a convicted serial killer,
1500840	1502840	treat Clarice with any respect.
1502840	1504040	In contrast to Lecter,
1504040	1507040	Bill is presented as a deviant and coded hideously queer,
1507040	1510640	a gay man who lisps and cavorts around his dungeon basement,
1510640	1512440	listening to Goodbye Horses
1512440	1515240	and carrying around a poodle named Precious.
1515640	1518040	Yes, you will, Precious. You'll forget the horse.
1518040	1519440	The first thing we learn about him
1519440	1521040	before we even know who he is
1521040	1523240	is that he had a gay cross-dressing lover
1523240	1525240	whom he's implied to have killed.
1525240	1527440	Lecter is a gentleman and a scholar,
1527440	1528640	Bill is low-class,
1528640	1530840	and has a Hedwig and the Angry Inch aesthetic.
1530840	1533040	Lecter appreciates femininity.
1533040	1535040	Bill wants to appropriate it.
1535040	1537040	Aaaaah!
1537040	1539040	Ha! Ha! Aaaaah!
1539040	1541040	The framing suggests that Bill is monstrous
1541040	1542640	not so much through his killing,
1542640	1544640	after all, Lecter is a killer too,
1544640	1546440	but because he's a man who sews,
1546440	1547440	wears makeup,
1547440	1549440	and desires a sex change operation,
1549440	1551040	even though he's...
1551040	1553040	Not a real transsexual.
1553040	1555040	But he thinks he is. He tries to be.
1555040	1557440	He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
1557440	1559840	So Thomas Harris seemed to understand
1559840	1562840	that he was putting something potentially harmful
1562840	1564040	into the world
1564040	1566840	about a group that was already stigmatized.
1566840	1568640	So the film adds this caveat
1568640	1571240	about how Buffalo Bill isn't a real tran,
1571240	1572840	while Clarice makes it clear to Lecter,
1572840	1574440	and by extension the viewer,
1574440	1576040	that trans people as a group
1576040	1578040	don't pose any inherent danger.
1578040	1579640	There's no correlation in the literature
1579640	1581440	between transsexualism and violence.
1581440	1583040	Transsexuals are very passive.
1583040	1584440	But these little disclaimers
1584440	1585640	aren't what linger in your mind
1585640	1587040	when you think of Buffalo Bill.
1587040	1588840	In fact, everyone I've asked about it
1588840	1591240	does not even remember this line is even there.
1591240	1593240	But you know what they do remember?
1593240	1595240	I'd fuck myself.
1595240	1597640	He's making himself a woman's suit, Mr. Crawford,
1597640	1598640	out of real women.
1598640	1601040	Aaaaah!
1601040	1603040	I'd fuck myself.
1604040	1606640	So Silence of the Lambs comes out,
1606640	1610240	and suddenly those lying duplicitous transes are everywhere.
1610240	1612640	During this era, if a character is transgender,
1612640	1615640	it's usually tied to some dark and horrible secret
1615640	1616440	in the narrative.
1616440	1619640	And the revelation about the truth of their body
1619640	1621640	typically is revealed simultaneously
1621640	1624640	with the revelation of another secret of some sort.
1624640	1626640	That the person is a liar,
1626640	1629040	a criminal, or even a killer.
1629040	1631040	In 1991's Soap Dish,
1631040	1633440	a scheming actress named Montana Moorhead
1633440	1636640	is trying to steal Sally Fields' job as a soap opera star
1636640	1637840	by sleeping her way to the top.
1637840	1639040	Only for it to be revealed
1639040	1641440	that Montana used to be Milton Moorhead.
1641440	1643640	She was...
1643640	1648040	Milton Moorhead of Syosset, Long Island.
1648040	1651040	Hello.
1651040	1652840	And she flees the set in shame
1652840	1655440	as the cast and crew look on in shock and horror.
1655440	1657040	Montana's transgender reveal
1657040	1658840	elucidates her deceitful nature.
1658840	1660640	If she lied about being trans,
1660640	1662240	then she's a liar at heart.
1662240	1663840	And also a slut.
1663840	1665440	This is my moment.
1665440	1666640	I have to seize it.
1666640	1669040	In 1992's The Crying Game,
1669040	1670240	an otherwise gritty drama
1670240	1672440	that was nominated for a bunch of Oscars,
1672440	1674440	a woman has an affair with a man
1674440	1676840	who killed her boyfriend,
1676840	1678040	but she doesn't know that.
1678040	1680040	And, you know, it's progressing pretty normally
1680040	1684240	when, blammo!
1684240	1685440	You did know, didn't you?
1685440	1689040	Straight to the toilet.
1689240	1691440	Although I don't super want to misrepresent this movie,
1691440	1694040	like, it is one of the more, like,
1694040	1696240	sensitive and nuanced takes
1696240	1700040	we would see for the next 20 years.
1700040	1701640	And I also, like, gotta give it credit
1701640	1704040	for its, like, weirdly sweet ending.
1704040	1705440	But it does seem to be the first example
1705440	1709440	of a trope that was going to be
1709440	1710840	really tiresome.
1710840	1712640	In Naked Gun, 33 and 1 3rd,
1712640	1715440	detective Frank Drebin has an on-and-off flirtation
1715440	1716440	with the villain's girlfriend,
1716440	1718440	played by Anna Nicole Smith,
1718440	1721240	which culminates with her undressing for him in silhouette,
1721240	1729840	revealing this.
1729840	1736640	And Frank reacts.
1736640	1739040	But perhaps the most notorious example from this era
1739040	1741440	comes from Ace Ventura Pet Detective,
1741440	1743840	wherein it is revealed that a female police detective
1743840	1746040	that Ace kisses earlier in the film
1746040	1749840	is the same person as one of Ace's dolphin-kidnapping suspects,
1749840	1751640	who happens to be a man, honey,
1751640	1754840	a crazy one that went to a mental institution and everything.
1754840	1757840	We're talking paranoid delusional psychosis.
1757840	1759240	I saw the guy's room.
1759240	1761840	It's cozy if you're Hannibal Lecter.
1761840	1764640	And when he figures this out, of course.
1764640	1767240	Oh, my God!
1767240	1773840	Einhorn is a man!
1773840	1776240	Then at the end, when Ace reveals her former identity
1776240	1778840	by forcibly exposing the bulge in her underwear
1778840	1780840	to practically her entire police department
1780840	1782840	at the end of the movie,
1782840	1790440	wait for it.
1790440	1793040	One of the major indicators of trans women's villainy
1793040	1797240	in these movies is that they do not disclose their trans status.
1797240	1800840	Their trans status is used as shorthand for their duplicitous ways.
1800840	1803240	The nauseating revelation that they're trans
1803240	1806040	is typically treated as more shocking and important
1806040	1808240	than any actual crime they've committed.
1808240	1811440	There's no meaningful difference made between finding out a woman is trans
1811440	1813240	and discovering that she's a criminal.
1813240	1817040	There's also a sort of phobia of intersex and non-binary people, too,
1817040	1819440	that was, I don't want to say all the rage as much,
1819440	1821440	but it was definitely a thing in the 90s.
1821440	1824440	Pat from SNL was a well-known example from this era,
1824440	1828840	the joke being that no one can ever figure out if Pat is a man or a woman.
1828840	1834440	I was in love with someone who was not what they appeared to be.
1834440	1838240	Well, and what was it that Chris appeared to be, exactly?
1838240	1840240	A decent human being.
1840240	1843240	And this was a character popular enough that they even got their own movie.
1843240	1844840	We got it in Spaceballs 2.
1844840	1849640	I'm the bearded lady, but are you one of the freaks?
1849640	1855040	And in a 1998 episode of South Park entitled
1855040	1857240	Cartman's mom is still a dirty slut.
1857240	1860040	Cartman's mom is revealed to be intersex.
1860040	1862440	You're a big fat ass, and your mom's a hermaphrodite!
1862440	1864640	I'm sorry I never told you, Eric.
1864640	1869640	But because she is a dirty slut, she also has slept with every man in South Park,
1869640	1873240	and when they find out about this...
1873240	1875440	She was a he?
1875440	1878240	No, no, not exactly, but she did have a penis.
1879840	1880840	One joke.
1882240	1883040	One joke.
1883040	1885240	Yeah, this was eventually retconned, but who cares?
1885240	1888040	And yes, of course, there's Mr. Garrison.
1888040	1891440	But I paid $5,000 to be a woman.
1891440	1893640	This would mean I'm not really a woman.
1893640	1897040	I'm just a guy with a mutilated penis.
1897040	1898440	Basically, yes.
1898440	1900440	If we talked about South Park, we'd be here all day.
1900440	1901640	I don't really care.
1901640	1904640	And in the 2000s, the bro comedy emerges.
1904640	1906040	Dude, where's my car?
1906040	1907640	In 2000's Dude, Where's My Car?
1907640	1910840	a stripper gives a couple of stoners money for safekeeping
1910840	1914440	and reveals her trans status when she demands it back, and...
1916240	1917640	No!
1917640	1919440	Oh, dude, you're a dude!
1922840	1926240	Guys, if the mere sight of a penis makes you want to hurl,
1926240	1929240	like, how do you live with yourselves? I don't get it.
1929240	1933240	The trans surprise is there in The 40-Year-Old Virgin and The Hangover 2.
1933240	1937040	Both have their reveal and the idea of deception and shame for attraction
1937040	1939640	and or sexual relation with a trans woman.
1939640	1942640	You know what? Hiring a transvestite prostitute isn't helping me, man.
1942640	1944640	What? Ain't nobody hiring no damn transvestite.
1944640	1946040	What? What are you talking about?
1946040	1948040	She was really nice, incidentally.
1948040	1951440	But at least they've stopped puking.
1951440	1953240	You in Bangkok, sweetie?
1953240	1955040	That's the reason they don't call it Bangkok.
1955040	1956040	Oh!
1956040	1959040	Also noteworthy that most of these characters are sex workers.
1959040	1961040	In Family Guy, it pops up a few times,
1961040	1963840	most notably in an episode called Quagmire's Dad,
1963840	1967840	where it is revealed that Quagmire's Dad transitioned at some point
1967840	1970440	after fathering Quagmire.
1970440	1974440	Brian sleeps with her, and when he finds out...
1989440	1990440	Are you done?
1993440	1995440	This scene goes on for a minute.
1998440	2001440	Trans panic puke walked so attack helicopter could fly.
2001440	2002440	Literally.
2007440	2011440	Also, like, Quagmire's Dad slept with a dog.
2011440	2014440	And the dog is the nauseated one in this scenario.
2019440	2021440	But it wasn't in just stuff for bros.
2021440	2024440	In a 2000 episode of Sex and the City called...
2024440	2026440	Cock-a-doodle-doo,
2027040	2030040	Samantha's not thrilled with the, uh...
2030040	2031040	There they were.
2031040	2034040	Samantha's friendly neighborhood pre-op transsexual hookers.
2034040	2035040	Oh, hey.
2035040	2036040	Sex workers and women of color.
2036040	2037040	Nice.
2037040	2039040	I am paying a fortune to live in a neighborhood
2039040	2042040	that's trendy by day and tr-y by night.
2042040	2043040	It's like...
2043040	2046040	It's like sometimes it starts to be okay, and then...
2046040	2047040	Aha!
2047040	2049040	Don't I know it?
2049040	2052040	Samantha always knew how to get her way with men.
2052040	2054040	Oh, goddammit, Curie.
2054640	2057640	They party at the end of the episode, so it's fine, I guess, but...
2057640	2058640	Oh, no.
2062640	2063640	This episode is just...
2063640	2064640	It's...
2064640	2066640	It's so cringe.
2066640	2069640	No, Sarah Jessica Parker, stop.
2069640	2070640	Stop.
2070640	2072640	Oh, what are you doing? No.
2072640	2074640	I don't know, there's something about the well-meaningness
2074640	2076640	that makes it even more cringe.
2076640	2077640	Don't worry.
2077640	2079640	They have a very lovely life.
2079640	2082640	GLAAD did a survey of the representation of trans people
2083240	2085240	on television from 2002 to 2012,
2085240	2088240	most of which cataloged procedurals like
2088240	2090240	NCIS and Law & Order and...
2094240	2097240	Because that was most of what was on TV.
2097240	2099240	But the survey found that transgender characters
2099240	2101240	were cast as killers or villains
2101240	2104240	in at least 21% of the cataloged episodes and storylines.
2104240	2106240	The most common profession transgender characters
2106240	2109240	were depicted as having was that of sex workers,
2109240	2111240	which a fifth of all characters were depicted as.
2111840	2113840	An anti-trans slurs, language, and dialogue
2113840	2116840	was present in at least 61% of the cataloged episodes and storylines.
2116840	2119840	But starting in the 2000s, the narrative also shifted,
2119840	2122840	and we started to see more positive representation
2122840	2125840	of trans people in films and TV shows like
2125840	2128840	The Danish Girl, Transparent, Orange is the New Black,
2128840	2132840	Transamerica, Boys Don't Cry, and Dallas Buyers Club.
2132840	2134840	Now there's this attempt in the mainstream
2134840	2136840	to empathize with the trans experience,
2136840	2137840	where before it was...
2138440	2151440	And a lot of people feel like these efforts fall short,
2151440	2154440	especially when a cis actor plays a trans character,
2154440	2156440	which is... most of them.
2156440	2158440	All of them, except Orange is the New Black.
2158440	2161440	But even though that does deserve some scrutiny,
2161440	2164440	the fact is that now you have a mainstream who is ready,
2164440	2167440	even eager, to empathize with trans characters.
2168040	2171040	And in a way, this is what's threatening to people like Joanne.
2171040	2174040	Before, these characters were killers, and liars,
2174040	2177040	and criminals, and sex perverts, or all of the above.
2177040	2181040	But now, they're people with humanity and depth?
2181040	2182040	Hmm.
2182040	2184040	Which brings us to...
2186040	2189040	Troubled Blood is the fifth book in J.K. Rowling's
2189040	2191040	Cormoran Strike detective novel series,
2191040	2193040	written under the pen name of Robert Galbraith.
2193040	2196040	In this installment, it's titular hero, Cormoran,
2196040	2198040	an army veteran turned private detective,
2198040	2200040	and his partner, Robin,
2200040	2202040	basically a younger, hot J.K. Rowling,
2202040	2204040	Her face in the wing mirror was pale,
2204040	2206040	her blue eyes bloodshot,
2206040	2208040	and the strawberry blonde hair currently hidden
2208040	2211040	under a black beanie hat needed a wash,
2211040	2214040	are trying to solve a 40-year-old cold case
2214040	2217040	of a missing doctor, Margaret Bambrough.
2217040	2219040	You see, Bambrough, who was a gorgeous,
2219040	2221040	strong-headed second-wave feminist,
2221040	2223040	left her office one evening after treating
2223040	2225040	a shady, masculine-looking woman
2225040	2227040	who was never seen again.
2227040	2229040	And everyone, including Bambrough's now-grown daughter,
2229040	2232040	assumes that Margot was an unconfirmed victim
2232040	2234040	of the Essex Butcher, a 70s serial killer
2234040	2236040	who liked to kidnap women,
2236040	2237040	chain them up in his basement,
2237040	2239040	and eventually rape and murder them.
2239040	2242040	And he dressed like a woman to do it.
2242040	2245040	He likes dressing up in women's clothing to get off,
2245040	2247040	and he uses makeup and wigs
2247040	2249040	to make himself less threatening
2249040	2251040	so he can gain access to women's spaces
2251040	2254040	to lure them into a false sense of security
2254040	2257040	for the easier murdering.
2257040	2259040	Well, it's Cormoran on the case.
2259040	2261040	Who killed the second-wave feminist doctor?
2261040	2263040	Was it the Essex Butcher?
2263040	2265040	Or could it have been the ex-boyfriend artist?
2265040	2267040	Or the medical clerk who is so very fat
2267040	2269040	and wears a lot of makeup?
2269040	2272040	She's really fat, and she wears too much makeup.
2272040	2274040	Like her sitting room, Irene Hickson presented
2274040	2276040	a first impression of over-embellished,
2276040	2278040	over-padded opulence.
2278040	2280040	Just as blonde as she'd been at 25,
2280040	2283040	she was now much heavier with an enormous bosom.
2283040	2285040	She'd outlined her hooded eyes in black,
2285040	2289040	penciled her sparse brows into a high, Piero-ish arc,
2289040	2291040	and painted her thin lips in scarlet.
2291040	2294040	Irene helped herself to another biscuit,
2294040	2295040	frowning slightly.
2295040	2298040	Janice passed around fresh cups of tea and coffee.
2298040	2301040	Irene helped herself to another chocolate biscuit,
2301040	2303040	looking as though she'd said something very clever
2303040	2305040	as she reached forwards to take another biscuit,
2305040	2308040	and a deafening fart ripped through the room.
2308040	2310040	Or could it be the nurse
2310040	2312040	who speaks like a Cockney cartoon chap?
2312040	2313040	What?
2313040	2316040	Aw, you know Dr. Brenner probably taught Carl a fence-off.
2316040	2319040	He was an only terror when he was a kid, Carl,
2319040	2323040	and he comes across as the kind of man who owns a garage.
2323040	2325040	Or the questionably gay, I'm sorry,
2325040	2328040	camp man who just loves karaoke?
2328040	2331040	And will Cormoran and the J.K. Rowling stand-in
2331040	2333040	finally, finally confess their very hetero love
2333040	2334040	for each other?
2335040	2339040	So, this is 900 pages of J.K.'s worst tendencies,
2339040	2341040	from phonetically writing out accents,
2341040	2344040	He started dropping in, telling me all his problems,
2344040	2347040	and he tells me how he's mad about this married woman,
2347040	2349040	falling for his mate's wife.
2349040	2352040	On and on and on about how odd her life is,
2352040	2355040	and there's me sitting there with a kid of my own.
2355040	2357040	What about my odd life?
2357040	2359040	She had an husband, didn't she?
2359040	2361040	To the cool girl not being like the other girls,
2361040	2364040	to a predilection for describing characters' appearances
2364040	2366040	and weight so thoroughly and repeatedly
2366040	2369040	that it honestly becomes kind of uncomfortable.
2369040	2371040	Robin was trying to eat healthily
2371040	2373040	in spite of her unsociable hours,
2373040	2375040	but the almonds had long since ceased to be appetizing,
2375040	2378040	and she craved nothing more than a bit of the pizza
2378040	2380040	she could see an overweight couple enjoying
2380040	2381040	in the restaurant window.
2381040	2382040	A hugely obese...
2382040	2384040	Okay, this is getting ridiculous.
2384040	2386040	A hugely obese old lady came into view
2386040	2388040	on the landing above them.
2388040	2389040	She was clad in shorts,
2390040	2392040	She was clad in shocking pink leggings
2392040	2394040	and a T-shirt bearing the slogan,
2394040	2396040	The more people I meet, the more I like my dog.
2396040	2400040	The only occupant, a small, obese, bespectacled man,
2400040	2402040	wore jeans and a black sweatshirt.
2402040	2404040	He had a triple chin,
2404040	2406040	and his belly kept him a foot and a half away
2406040	2409040	from the white formica-topped table at which he was sitting.
2409040	2412040	Seriously, Joanne, what fat person hurt you?
2412040	2414040	In terms of theory, it's easy to read
2414040	2417040	a lot of biological determinist second-wave feminism
2417040	2419040	into troubled blood's influence.
2419040	2421040	Second-wave feminists coined the idea
2421040	2423040	that gender is a social construct,
2423040	2426040	but sex is a biological prison
2426040	2428040	from which there is no escape.
2428040	2430040	Asterisk.
2430040	2432040	There's a whole lot of flim-flam about gender roles
2432040	2434040	and how Strike's on-again, off-again flame
2434040	2437040	slash assistant is not like the other women.
2437040	2440040	Lots of women do this, men do that.
2440040	2443040	So much rape, and men can't be trusted
2443040	2446040	to not hurt women and do the rape.
2446040	2448040	Except Strike, of course, he's fine.
2448040	2451040	Joanne has a lot of opinion about not just the transes,
2451040	2453040	but the state of womanhood in general.
2453040	2456040	Such as modern fourth-wave feminists
2456040	2460040	with their slut walks and selfies and too much makeup,
2460040	2462040	are frivolous little bitches who don't organize
2462040	2464040	and actually work for a change
2464040	2467040	like their second-wave counterparts, the good ones.
2467040	2470040	Women who are uggos are just reeling for blood.
2470040	2472040	Actually, no, you don't need to be a full-on uggo,
2472040	2476040	you need to be, like, a six to go into a murderous rage
2476040	2478040	because boys don't like you.
2478040	2481040	That don't help a woman. It's better to be pretty.
2481040	2483040	You'll have a better life if you're good-looking.
2483040	2486040	Men always went for Irene, not me.
2486040	2489040	Why wouldn't anyone marry me?
2489040	2492040	What haven't I got that I'm a woman, Ev?
2492040	2495040	No one suspects the six.
2495040	2496040	Ancients.
2496040	2498040	Repeated Janice Beattie as the police car
2498040	2500040	drew to a halt outside her front door
2500040	2502040	and she squared her shoulders ready to accept her fate.
2502040	2504040	Ev consequences.
2504040	2506040	You don't have to write the accent in, Joanne.
2506040	2508040	We get that you hate poor people.
2508040	2512040	Contraception is fine, but abortion is morally dubious.
2512040	2514040	Imagine aborting your husband's...
2514040	2516040	What the fuck?
2516040	2518040	When you asked me to read these,
2518040	2520040	I didn't think they would be this bad.
2520040	2523040	Imagine aborting your husband's child, she thought.
2523040	2525040	Could Margot really have done that
2525040	2527040	when she already had that child's sister at home?
2527040	2529040	Oh.
2530040	2532040	To quote Vox.com's review of the book,
2532040	2534040	it's the writing of someone who feels she has no choice
2534040	2537040	but to bring some home truth to you, the reader,
2537040	2539040	and damn the consequences.
2539040	2541040	Now, you might be thinking,
2541040	2543040	I heard from other YouTubers who totally,
2543040	2546040	100% read the e-book.
2546040	2548040	I read the book, I spent the last 12 hours
2548040	2550040	reading it as an e-book.
2550040	2552040	I mean the hard copy.
2552040	2556040	With overnight shipping, a long, obnoxiously thick novel.
2556040	2558040	I'm sorry, I mean the e-book.
2558040	2560040	Reading it as an e-book.
2560040	2562040	Shout out to D'Angelo for catching that.
2562040	2564040	That the serial killer in question
2564040	2566040	is a cis man specifically,
2566040	2568040	and not a trans woman.
2568040	2570040	It only ever really seems to paint him
2570040	2572040	as just a pervert who looks cross-dressing
2572040	2574040	but he's male.
2574040	2577040	What do any of these tropes about women in general
2577040	2579040	have to do with transphobia?
2579040	2581040	Well, the book has this very Victorian
2581040	2583040	men and women do some things differently
2583040	2586040	and ne'er the twain shall meet thread.
2586040	2588040	Much in the way that, well, the Victorians
2588040	2590040	describe the phenomena as living in
2590040	2592040	separate spheres.
2592040	2594040	And to me, J.K. Rowling making the killer
2594040	2596040	a self-identified man in the context
2596040	2598040	of her public comments feels less
2598040	2600040	like her trying to assure the reader
2600040	2602040	that he is not trans, and more like
2602040	2604040	an assertion that any man in a wig
2604040	2606040	and lipstick has the potential to invade
2606040	2609040	women's holy spaces and rape and kill them.
2609040	2611040	When you throw open the doors
2611040	2613040	of bathrooms and changing rooms
2613040	2615040	to any man who believes or feels he's a woman
2615040	2617040	and, as I've said, gender confirmation
2617040	2619040	certificates may now be granted without
2619040	2621040	any need for surgery or hormones
2621040	2623040	then you open the door to any and all
2623040	2625040	men who wish to come inside.
2625040	2627040	That is the simple truth.
2627040	2629040	The way she describes her worries
2629040	2631040	in her essay completely lines up
2631040	2633040	with her serial killer's modus operandi
2633040	2635040	in Troubled Blood. And no,
2635040	2637040	I don't think it's a coincidence that these came out
2637040	2639040	at the same time,
2639040	2641040	summer of last year.
2641040	2643040	And this actually lies in contrast to Silence of the Lambs
2643040	2645040	wherein Thomas Harris
2645040	2647040	is even more aware than the movie
2647040	2649040	of the harm a transgender serial killer
2649040	2651040	could do to the trans community.
2651040	2653040	There's even a whole subplot
2653040	2655040	in the book where Crawford goes to the
2655040	2657040	gender reassignment clinic.
2657040	2659040	To even mention Buffalo Bill in the same breath
2659040	2661040	with the problems we treat here is ignorant
2661040	2663040	and unfair and dangerous, Mr. Crawford.
2663040	2665040	It makes my hair stand on end.
2665040	2667040	It's taken years, we're not through yet
2667040	2669040	showing the public that transsexuals
2669040	2671040	aren't crazy, they aren't perverts,
2671040	2673040	they aren't queers,
2673040	2675040	whatever that is. Hold on,
2675040	2677040	the incidence of violence among transsexuals is a lot
2677040	2679040	lower than in the general population.
2679040	2681040	These are decent people with a real problem,
2681040	2683040	a famously intransigent problem.
2683040	2685040	They deserve help and we can give it.
2685040	2687040	And Crawford's like, ah, I know, but I know
2687040	2689040	that and that's why we need to know who you rejected
2689040	2691040	because we know Bill is not a true
2691040	2693040	tran, a true tran would never.
2693040	2695040	The whole idea is the man we want
2695040	2697040	is not your patient.
2697040	2699040	It would be someone you refused because you
2699040	2701040	recognized that he was not a transsexual.
2701040	2703040	So even the author of the most
2703040	2705040	popular example of the gender distressed
2705040	2707040	serial killer is conscious of the fact
2707040	2709040	that trans people exist, that their
2709040	2711040	perception as predatory has no statistical
2711040	2713040	data to back it, and the
2713040	2715040	existence of a trans serial killer
2715040	2717040	would really affect the entire
2717040	2719040	community. But in Treble Blood,
2719040	2721040	gender nonconformity isn't even
2721040	2723040	mentioned outside of Dennis Creed,
2723040	2725040	sex pervert, who wears women's
2725040	2727040	clothes to get off.
2727040	2729040	He soon progressed to stealing women's underwear
2729040	2731040	from neighbors' washing lines and even
2731040	2733040	from his grandmother, Aina.
2733040	2735040	These he enjoying wearing
2735040	2737040	in secret. What?
2737040	2739040	There's never any actual discussion about being
2739040	2741040	transgender either, almost as if to say
2741040	2743040	that there are no trans women, that
2743040	2745040	anyone not assigned female at birth who
2745040	2747040	appears feminine is using it
2747040	2749040	to deceive women in some way.
2749040	2751040	In effect, every trans woman
2751040	2753040	is a potential Buffalo Bill.
2753040	2755040	I'd fuck myself.
2755040	2757040	So Treble Blood is
2757040	2759040	effectually resurrecting a trope that is already
2759040	2761040	really dated, you know, in the way that
2761040	2763040	foppish gay hairstyling
2763040	2765040	besties are dated, but is still playing into
2765040	2767040	a trope that has very real-world consequences,
2767040	2769040	namely the idea that trans women are
2769040	2771040	inherently predatory. And I don't mean to
2771040	2773040	imply that trans people can't be
2773040	2775040	predatory or abusive.
2775040	2777040	Every group has perverts and weirdos.
2777040	2779040	But being a pervert and
2779040	2781040	or weirdo doesn't have anything to do with one's
2781040	2783040	transness any more than it would
2783040	2785040	someone's, I don't know, gayness
2785040	2787040	or depression or whatever.
2787040	2789040	But this is the association that runs
2789040	2791040	deep in the popular consciousness.
2791040	2793040	She was described in court as a predator
2793040	2795040	who was a danger to women
2795040	2797040	and to children. I can only surmise
2797040	2799040	that the case of Karen White is
2799040	2801040	one of the things that upset her so much.
2801040	2803040	Karen, once known as
2803040	2805040	Stephen Wood, appeared by a video link
2805040	2807040	from the men's prison at Armley in Leeds
2807040	2809040	wearing a wig, glasses, and a
2809040	2811040	floral blouse. Karen White is a
2811040	2813040	trans woman in the UK who is currently
2813040	2815040	in prison for various crimes,
2815040	2817040	a lot of them sex crimes, in a men's
2817040	2819040	prison as far as the most recent update.
2819040	2821040	According to this article in the Independent,
2821040	2823040	White used her transgender
2823040	2825040	persona to put herself in contact
2825040	2827040	with vulnerable women. Right off the
2827040	2829040	bat, the media inextricably links
2829040	2831040	her sex crimes with her transness.
2831040	2833040	Notably, the Independent article uses
2833040	2835040	the prosecutor's interpretation of events
2835040	2837040	and doesn't mention the defense's
2837040	2839040	interpretation at all, saying there was
2839040	2841040	evidence to suggest that her approach
2841040	2843040	to transitioning has been less than
2843040	2845040	committed, and in fact was designed
2845040	2847040	to allow White access to vulnerable
2847040	2849040	victims, dressed up in drag
2849040	2851040	to gain access to women's spaces
2851040	2853040	and lure them into a false sense of security.
2853040	2855040	Hmm. Man, at least
2855040	2857040	when Jack Lemmon did it, it was fun.
2857040	2859040	It's not my fault I
2859040	2861040	didn't invite them.
2861040	2863040	So this article isn't just a list of White's
2863040	2865040	crimes, which are allegedly very real,
2865040	2867040	but a pointed effort to paint
2867040	2869040	White not as a criminal who happens to be
2869040	2871040	trans, but spotlighting her
2871040	2873040	transness somehow as relevant to
2873040	2875040	her crimes. Let's take a look at
2875040	2877040	one of the favorite articles TERFs like to
2877040	2879040	cite as evidence for the inherent dangers
2879040	2881040	trans women present.
2881040	2883040	Transgender inmates have carried out
2883040	2885040	seven sex attacks...
2885040	2887040	Sex attack.
2887040	2889040	I want a man who wants to
2889040	2891040	make a sex attack on me.
2891040	2893040	Transgender inmates have carried out seven sex attacks
2893040	2895040	on women in jail, despite the risks
2895040	2897040	male-born trans convicts are still
2897040	2899040	allowed to move into women's prisons.
2899040	2901040	So conservative politician Richard Cain made
2901040	2903040	this statement, which then went viral,
2903040	2905040	and the Ministry of Justice has said,
2905040	2907040	since 2010, out of the 124
2907040	2909040	sexual assaults that occurred in the
2909040	2911040	female estate, a total of seven of those
2911040	2913040	were sexual assaults against females in
2913040	2915040	custody, perpetrated by
2915040	2917040	transgender individuals.
2917040	2919040	Snoop, I know you're not with
2919040	2921040	the Crips anymore, but please don't kill me for that
2921040	2923040	trans flag thing.
2923040	2925040	Basically, this article talks about transgender
2925040	2927040	INDIVIDUALS
2927040	2929040	assaulting women in women's prisons, which
2929040	2931040	let's assume that that's
2931040	2933040	true. This word
2933040	2935040	INDIVIDUALS is doing a lot
2935040	2937040	of heavy lifting, because it's assuming that
2937040	2939040	trans women are doing the predation,
2939040	2941040	but neglects the fact that most
2941040	2943040	trans INDIVIDUALS
2943040	2945040	in women's prisons are
2945040	2947040	assigned female at birth trans men.
2947040	2949040	According to the data, we do have
2949040	2951040	trans men outnumber trans women
2951040	2953040	in women's prisons in the UK almost
2953040	2955040	2 to 1. So assuming that
2955040	2957040	sex attack number is correct, it doesn't
2957040	2959040	say how many of these seven are
2959040	2961040	trans men, trans women,
2961040	2963040	non-binary, or whatever.
2963040	2965040	So while the implication here is that men
2965040	2967040	in drag are sneaking into women's
2967040	2969040	prisons to assault cis women,
2969040	2971040	they aren't telling us who is doing the
2971040	2973040	assaulting. So if by extreme
2973040	2975040	technicality the Daily Mail is
2975040	2977040	not representing a falsehood in this article,
2977040	2979040	and for the sake of argument,
2979040	2981040	let's just assume that they're not,
2981040	2983040	even though I have my doubts,
2983040	2985040	they are relying on the reader's
2985040	2987040	biases to connect the dots
2987040	2989040	that trans women are predatory and
2989040	2991040	are a danger to cis women. Also
2991040	2993040	all of the data this article draws on is a
2993040	2995040	mess. Found out the hard way that the UK
2995040	2997040	apparently does not keep nearly as good data
2997040	2999040	on sexual assault as prisons in the US
2999040	3001040	do, and just the way that
3001040	3003040	things are phrased in this report
3003040	3005040	is super confusing to read
3005040	3007040	and therefore really easy for
3007040	3009040	bad faith actors to misrepresent.
3009040	3011040	For instance, there are the people who take bits of data
3011040	3013040	and clearly willfully misrepresent
3013040	3015040	them, like saying
3015040	3017040	139 transgender inmates are currently
3017040	3019040	housed in women's prisons.
3019040	3021040	Which is just flat out wrong. It's a lie.
3021040	3023040	That was the total number of
3023040	3025040	transgender prisoners in 2018
3025040	3027040	in prisons for either sex.
3027040	3029040	But that comes with an even weirder caveat
3029040	3031040	because this 139 transgender
3031040	3033040	inmates number does not
3033040	3035040	include people who have legally transitioned
3035040	3037040	and have the gender recognition
3037040	3039040	certificate that Joanne
3039040	3041040	is so f***ing mad about.
3041040	3043040	So people who are transgender
3043040	3045040	and have fully legally transitioned
3045040	3047040	and ended up in prison
3047040	3049040	somehow, aren't even accounted for
3049040	3051040	in this 139 number.
3051040	3053040	So who are these
3053040	3055040	people? Eh?
3055040	3057040	How are they counting them? Eh?
3057040	3059040	So it's absurd for them to claim
3059040	3061040	that they can draw accurate conclusions about
3061040	3063040	the dangers of the predatory trans
3063040	3065040	because that data does not
3065040	3067040	exist. And on the claim that transgender
3067040	3069040	people are disproportionately imprisoned
3069040	3071040	for committing sex offenses, another
3071040	3073040	TERF favorite in the UK,
3073040	3075040	according to the UK non-profit
3075040	3077040	Bent Bars,
3093040	3097040	And like with so many things,
3097040	3099040	that statistic is completely made up.
3099040	3101040	But it sounds plausible,
3101040	3103040	doesn't it? Because that presumption
3103040	3105040	of trans women as predatory
3105040	3107040	is already there.
3107040	3109040	Inside your mind.
3109040	3111040	Like the fanci-
3111040	3113040	I'm sorry. So you have this combination of people
3113040	3115040	with specifically anti-trans agendas
3115040	3117040	spreading misinformation based on a misrepresentation
3117040	3119040	of data that is already insufficient,
3119040	3121040	melding with an extremely
3121040	3123040	common trope going all the way back to
3123040	3125040	Ed Gein that there's just something inherently
3125040	3127040	predatory about trans women.
3127040	3129040	So while Troubled Blood definitely
3129040	3131040	has an early 90's
3131040	3133040	dated-ness to it, as Natalie
3133040	3135040	put it, my enemy
3135040	3137040	eternal, whore, you'd think that a
3137040	3139040	seasoned writer like Joanne would at least put a
3139040	3141040	new twist on the crossdressing murderer
3141040	3143040	trope. But she doesn't.
3143040	3145040	It's just dressed to kill. Only
3145040	3147040	in this book, the crossdresser is a red herring.
3147040	3149040	Spoilers.
3149040	3151040	Spoilers.
3151040	3153040	We have no evidence that trans women
3153040	3155040	are any more danger to cis women
3155040	3157040	than other cis women, in prison or
3157040	3159040	otherwise. And non-prison-related
3159040	3161040	studies do bear this out.
3161040	3163040	But we do have mountains of evidence for who is
3163040	3165040	really in danger in prison.
3165040	3167040	This being, of course, trans women.
3167040	3169040	One statewide study in California
3169040	3171040	found that when transgender women were automatically
3171040	3173040	housed with men, they were 13
3173040	3175040	times more likely to be sexually assaulted
3175040	3177040	than male prisoners in the same facility.
3177040	3179040	And a report from the U.S. Bureau of
3179040	3181040	Justice Statistics said that from 2011
3181040	3183040	to 2012, 40% of
3183040	3185040	transgender prisoners reported being the victim of
3185040	3187040	a sexual assault within the previous 12 months,
3187040	3189040	10 times the percentage of non-transgender
3189040	3191040	inmates. Regarding the case
3191040	3193040	of Karen White, a U.K. prison spokesperson
3193040	3195040	said,
3201040	3203040	But surely
3203040	3205040	your trans prisoners fall under the
3205040	3207040	umbrella of all prisoners.
3207040	3209040	So, what about them?
3209040	3211040	The message is clear.
3211040	3213040	The priority of cis women's feelings
3213040	3215040	of being in danger, rather than the reality
3215040	3217040	of trans people being more at risk.
3217040	3219040	And where do these feelings come from but the cultural
3219040	3221040	boogeyman of the predatory tran?
3221040	3223040	So, there's already
3223040	3225040	been a lot of discussion by
3225040	3227040	people who are not me, and
3227040	3229040	who actually care about this
3229040	3231040	sort of thing, about the weird gender subtext
3231040	3233040	in the Harry Potter series.
3233040	3235040	Whether it's Cho Chang, or
3235040	3237040	Voldemort's mother, or
3237040	3239040	basically any woman in the Fantastic
3239040	3241040	Beasts series. But, you know,
3241040	3243040	it was easy to hand-wave away with claims of
3243040	3245040	like, you know, well, J.K., but she donated
3245040	3247040	to ex-feminist charity, or, you know,
3247040	3249040	they're children's stories, it's not that deep, bro.
3249040	3251040	But, it's clear
3251040	3253040	now that there's always been this sort of current
3253040	3255040	in her work of acceptable
3255040	3257040	womanhood. In terms of actual
3257040	3259040	personhood, no one should care anymore
3259040	3261040	about what J.K. Rowling thinks
3261040	3263040	than, like, you know, Sharon from Dayton, Ohio.
3263040	3265040	Who cares what she thinks?
3265040	3267040	The thing we should care about is her
3267040	3269040	influence, and that's why we even have to have this
3269040	3271040	stupid f***ing discussion
3271040	3273040	in the first place. The International Lesbian
3273040	3275040	Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Intersex
3275040	3277040	Association's 2021 Review of LGBT
3277040	3279040	Human Rights in Europe specifically
3279040	3281040	said this of Rowling's influence in the UK.
3281040	3283040	Anti-trans rhetoric continued
3283040	3285040	to cause serious damage in the UK
3285040	3287040	again this year. A prime example is
3287040	3289040	repeated transphobic attacks by author J.K.
3289040	3291040	Rowling on Twitter and in her writing.
3291040	3293040	The report warns that in some parts of the
3293040	3295040	UK, hate crimes had been steadily
3295040	3297040	increasing, in part due to an increase
3297040	3299040	in reporting, but also influenced by
3299040	3301040	increasing hostility in UK-wide media
3301040	3303040	towards trans identities and communities.
3303040	3305040	Mainstream media has only just begun
3305040	3307040	to center trans characters, creative heads,
3307040	3309040	and actors. You have shows like Pose,
3309040	3311040	produced, written, and directed in part by Janet Mock,
3311040	3313040	a trans woman of color, and also starring
3313040	3315040	multiple trans actors. God may have
3315040	3317040	blessed you with Barbies, a backyard with a
3317040	3319040	pony in it, a boyfriend named Jake, and an unwanted
3319040	3321040	pregnancy that your father paid to terminate so
3321040	3323040	you could go to college and major in being a basic
3323040	3325040	bitch. Or Sensate, produced, written,
3325040	3327040	and directed by the Wachowski sisters and starring
3327040	3329040	Jamie Clayton. Hell, there's even Difficult People's
3329040	3331040	Lola, played by trans comedian and actress
3331040	3333040	Shakina Nafak. Third airplane
3333040	3335040	goes right into the Pentagon?
3335040	3337040	I don't think so, bitches. That was
3337040	3339040	a missile. And Tower 7 was brought down
3339040	3341040	by a bomb. Whose transness takes a backseat
3341040	3343040	to the fact that she's Billy Eichner's work
3343040	3345040	enemy and also a massive 9-11 truther.
3345040	3347040	May your love shine as bright as the
3347040	3349040	sun did on that fair September morn
3349040	3351040	when George W. Bush pulled off the greatest scam
3351040	3353040	in American history since the moon landing.
3353040	3355040	On the character, Nafak had this to say,
3355040	3357040	In the quest for transgender visibility, we've
3357040	3359040	only been introduced to sympathetic roles that rely
3359040	3361040	on victimization or stereotypes in order
3361040	3363040	to elicit empathy from our audiences.
3363040	3365040	You're gonna love Lola because she's strong and opinionated
3365040	3367040	and crass, not because she's getting
3367040	3369040	bashed, locked up, or wrestling with coming
3369040	3371040	out. You do seem happier than usual.
3371040	3373040	Granted, that bar is set about as low as the burning
3373040	3375040	temperature of jet fuel. So how can it
3375040	3377040	melt steel beams? Exactly.
3377040	3379040	So while there's still the Ready Player Two's or
3379040	3381040	cyberpunk 2077's of the world
3381040	3383040	that include trans characters with,
3383040	3385040	and I say this very generously, good
3385040	3387040	intentions of inclusion,
3387040	3389040	while still falling on the spectrum of reducing trans
3389040	3391040	people to sexual commodities, progress
3391040	3393040	is being made and even embraced, which
3393040	3395040	is why it's disappointing and almost
3395040	3397040	surprising that something so archaic
3397040	3399040	as troubled blood is even a thing.
3399040	3401040	In terms of theory and media crit,
3401040	3403040	I have done what I can do.
3403040	3405040	But in terms of YouTube drama,
3405040	3407040	well, only you can help with that.
3407040	3409040	So I'm not kidding, this is real,
3409040	3411040	all of the profits from our feud merch
3411040	3413040	will go to...
3413040	3415040	Sir not appearing in this film.
3415040	3417040	It will be a good one,
3417040	3419040	I promise. Blame Addison
3419040	3421040	Cain for me not being.
3421040	3423040	And remember, trans women are not
3423040	3425040	predatory, except for that whore
3425040	3427040	Natalie.
3427040	3429040	Leave me a message about how Hitchcock is
3429040	3431040	a problematic too, I haven't heard that one.
3431040	3433040	Okay, I guess that's it, I'm done.
3459040	3461040	I finally have a dozen of my donuts
3461040	3463040	Delicious donuts
3463040	3465040	They're downright dunky
3465040	3467040	And they are definitely
3467040	3469040	done by only me
3469040	3471040	Yes they are deep fried
3471040	3473040	dipped and dabbed by Mr. D
3483040	3485040	And when I deliver
3485040	3487040	my delicious donuts
3487040	3489040	I do
3489040	3491040	the donut dance
3493040	3495040	Don't you want to do
3495040	3497040	the dance too?
3501040	3503040	What a delicious
3503040	3505040	donut dance
3517040	3519040	If you like donuts
3519040	3521040	Delicious donuts
3521040	3523040	Don't dilly-dally, have a dozen
3523040	3525040	of my donuts
3525040	3527040	Delicious donuts
3529040	3531040	Hold on, I paused in the middle to record that clip
3531040	3533040	What does he say next?
3533040	3535040	I'm just gonna say, I haven't read this book, I don't even know if it's
3535040	3537040	I'm just gonna say, I haven't read this book, I don't even know if it's
