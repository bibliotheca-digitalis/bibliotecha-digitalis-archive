WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.560
The trope seems to originate in 1960

00:02.560 --> 00:04.520
with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.

00:04.520 --> 00:05.480
That's just my guess, though.

00:05.480 --> 00:06.680
I haven't researched this.

00:06.680 --> 00:08.480
Who do you think I am, Lindsay Ellis?

00:10.880 --> 00:14.160
Well, it would appear that I have been summoned.

00:14.160 --> 00:18.440
So since this topic is never gonna go away, apparently,

00:18.440 --> 00:20.240
ContraPoints and I were, you know,

00:20.240 --> 00:23.080
planning on doing, like, a collab of sorts.

00:23.080 --> 00:23.920
But the thing is, like,

00:23.920 --> 00:25.120
both of us are really bad at scheduling

00:25.120 --> 00:28.060
and we couldn't, like, really figure anything out.

00:28.100 --> 00:31.180
And then someone sniped, like, half my talking points.

00:31.180 --> 00:32.020
I don't know.

00:32.020 --> 00:32.860
I figure this topic is, like,

00:32.860 --> 00:34.300
half of all we ever talk about,

00:34.300 --> 00:36.100
so we may as well monetize it, you know?

00:36.100 --> 00:38.100
So, do you wanna collab on the Psycho part?

00:38.100 --> 00:41.180
Or do you, why don't I do the Psycho part?

00:41.180 --> 00:42.700
I'm gonna do the Psycho part.

00:42.700 --> 00:43.540
It's happening.

00:43.540 --> 00:44.360
Whore.

00:44.360 --> 00:46.020
So, you know what that means.

00:46.020 --> 00:47.060
That's right.

00:47.060 --> 00:49.340
This is a feud.

00:49.340 --> 00:50.580
A YouTuber feud.

00:50.580 --> 00:51.900
That's right, we're feuding.

00:51.900 --> 00:54.140
Leave us a comment for who you think should win.

00:54.140 --> 00:55.820
And, you know, this isn't, like, a regular feud.

00:55.820 --> 00:57.660
This is, like, a cool feud.

00:58.060 --> 00:59.940
This feud has merchandise.

00:59.940 --> 01:00.780
No, really.

01:00.780 --> 01:02.640
You can go to my store and buy one of these two pins

01:02.640 --> 01:04.980
based on who you think should win the feud.

01:04.980 --> 01:07.140
Whoever sells the most pins wins.

01:07.140 --> 01:10.660
And 100% of the profits for these pins will go to

01:10.660 --> 01:13.820
The aptly named Sir Not Appearing in this film.

01:14.780 --> 01:16.820
Yeah, so the last time I named which charity

01:16.820 --> 01:19.380
I was going to give merchandise profits to,

01:19.380 --> 01:21.620
they got threatened with legal action.

01:21.620 --> 01:24.820
And because the EFF worked in collusion with Lindsay Ellis

01:24.820 --> 01:26.720
to create the monetized video,

01:26.720 --> 01:30.000
the EFF is also culpable for the copyright infringement

01:30.000 --> 01:31.120
and the defamation.

01:31.120 --> 01:36.120
So yeah, it's unnamed charity benefiting trans youths.

01:37.040 --> 01:38.480
You know, a variety of them.

01:38.480 --> 01:39.600
A melange.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.440
A rainbow, you might say.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.100
This is why we can't have nice things.

01:43.100 --> 01:45.240
So I did a Death of the Author addendum last year

01:45.240 --> 01:47.240
after a bunch of people asked me questions

01:47.240 --> 01:49.160
about the applicability of Death of the Author

01:49.160 --> 01:51.440
to the works of one Joanne Rowling

01:51.440 --> 01:54.520
in light of her new philosophy.

01:54.560 --> 01:57.320
When you throw open the doors of bathrooms

01:57.320 --> 01:59.480
and changing rooms to any man who believes

01:59.480 --> 02:01.120
or feels he's a woman,

02:01.120 --> 02:03.560
and as I've said, gender confirmation certificates

02:03.560 --> 02:06.920
may not be granted without any need for surgery or hormones,

02:06.920 --> 02:09.160
then you open the door to any and all men

02:09.160 --> 02:10.720
who wish to come inside.

02:10.720 --> 02:12.680
Which led to all sorts of fun feedback

02:12.680 --> 02:15.480
from viewers of other fine YouTube channels,

02:15.480 --> 02:19.480
such as reader of books, Vanessa LeBlanc.

02:19.480 --> 02:20.800
The opinions you're going to hear today

02:20.800 --> 02:22.880
are from someone who is not just, you know,

02:22.880 --> 02:25.040
on Twitter, hearing what other people have to say

02:25.040 --> 02:26.160
and hopping on a bandwagon.

02:26.160 --> 02:28.160
This is because I read the book.

02:29.220 --> 02:30.400
She totally read it.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.560
At the very most, the concept of being a transvestite

02:33.560 --> 02:38.560
makes a very quick, brief, fleeting appearance in the book,

02:39.440 --> 02:41.560
and it's extremely unimportant.

02:41.560 --> 02:44.440
It comes in the form of one line in the book,

02:44.440 --> 02:47.840
one page in a 900-page book.

02:47.840 --> 02:50.960
And master of cell phones, Gary of Swendon.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.200
Society is built around the interactions

02:53.200 --> 02:55.680
between men and women, and so it's not surprising

02:55.680 --> 02:57.800
that they would have quite a formalized

02:57.800 --> 03:00.920
and baked-in set of rules.

03:00.920 --> 03:03.080
Five minutes later.

03:03.080 --> 03:07.120
Why would we need to do anything in its purest, pure form?

03:07.120 --> 03:10.800
What has Lindsay Ellis ever done in her entire life

03:10.800 --> 03:12.720
that was of the purest, pure form?

03:12.720 --> 03:14.120
The answer is nothing.

03:14.120 --> 03:17.180
It's not gonna be exactly as it should be conceptually,

03:17.180 --> 03:18.980
but you just have to deal with that.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.480
I'm just gonna say, I haven't read this book.

03:23.480 --> 03:25.280
I don't even know if it's out yet, actually.

03:25.280 --> 03:28.280
Although my personal favorite came from one of Gary's fans

03:28.280 --> 03:31.760
who emailed me to scold me because they thought

03:31.760 --> 03:36.240
that death of the author meant I was literally advocating

03:36.240 --> 03:38.900
for the murder of J.K. Rowling.

03:40.040 --> 03:41.080
The thinkery.

03:42.500 --> 03:45.480
So much of the chicanery stemmed from a misrepresentation

03:45.480 --> 03:48.840
of J.K.'s argument, which is that she's just stating

03:48.840 --> 03:50.560
biology, you guys.

03:51.120 --> 03:53.200
She's not denying people's humanity.

03:53.200 --> 03:56.160
I don't hate trans people, but what is wrong

03:56.160 --> 04:00.440
with the trans activists that they think biology isn't real?

04:00.440 --> 04:03.560
J.K.R. is being canceled for stating a fact?

04:03.560 --> 04:07.080
Well, that's just canceled culture run amok.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.040
But while a huge component against discrimination

04:09.040 --> 04:11.640
against trans people is biological in nature,

04:11.640 --> 04:14.600
namely the denial of healthcare and medical gatekeeping,

04:14.600 --> 04:17.640
it is, in this context, completely besides the point.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.440
No one is saying biology isn't real.

04:19.440 --> 04:22.440
That's why the healthcare thing is such a big deal.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.960
Because of the biology.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.800
So for some people to reframe this discussion

04:27.800 --> 04:30.160
like trans activists are denying biology

04:30.160 --> 04:33.600
and that they are simply in their thinker, thinkery ways

04:33.600 --> 04:35.840
arguing against this obvious falsehood,

04:35.840 --> 04:38.720
well, that is how Sharon and Mike from Dayton, Ohio

04:38.720 --> 04:40.560
will first understand the argument.

04:40.560 --> 04:44.140
Joanne and Vanessa and Gary arguing against a point

04:44.140 --> 04:47.560
that no one is making, but since that's the point

04:47.560 --> 04:50.440
that Sharon and Mike are seeing argued against,

04:50.440 --> 04:52.400
that is what Sharon and Mike think

04:52.400 --> 04:55.840
that the trans activists actually believe.

04:55.840 --> 04:57.760
So as with a lot of reactionary movements,

04:57.760 --> 04:59.560
much of the anti-trans ideology

04:59.560 --> 05:03.000
is rooted in an appeal to common sense.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.600
And there really is something to this idea

05:04.600 --> 05:07.080
of using common sense as a rhetorical device.

05:07.080 --> 05:09.760
If a new or challenging idea is presented,

05:09.760 --> 05:11.520
all you need to do is look at the camera

05:11.520 --> 05:14.040
and be like, common sense, am I right?

05:14.040 --> 05:17.480
And it's effective because by appealing to common sense,

05:18.320 --> 05:19.160
the viewer slash reader doesn't need

05:19.160 --> 05:21.040
to challenge preconceptions.

05:21.040 --> 05:22.760
Like this cholera outbreak,

05:22.760 --> 05:26.000
common sense says it's the miasma.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.560
Germ theory, you can't even see those.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.960
Which is why all of these debates are so frustrating

05:30.960 --> 05:32.580
because to the Ben Shapiros

05:32.580 --> 05:34.400
and the Joanne Rowlings of the world,

05:34.400 --> 05:38.120
trans people existing doesn't have anything to do with them

05:38.120 --> 05:40.840
or their lives, but there is something inherently

05:40.840 --> 05:43.560
threatening about their acceptance by society.

05:43.560 --> 05:46.160
So they have to make up scenarios

05:46.160 --> 05:49.080
where it does have things to do with them.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.020
And they try to sell these scenarios

05:51.020 --> 05:54.440
with a very shallow brand of common sense.

05:54.440 --> 05:56.460
What if penis in bathroom?

05:56.460 --> 05:59.080
What if I'm dating one and I get tricked?

05:59.080 --> 06:01.840
And of course, that old reactionary classic,

06:01.840 --> 06:04.460
won't someone think of the children?

06:04.460 --> 06:06.360
So won't someone think of the children

06:06.360 --> 06:08.920
is a staple of every reactionary movement.

06:08.920 --> 06:10.800
If society progresses one inch,

06:10.800 --> 06:14.520
reactionaries are going to use the children as a shield.

06:14.520 --> 06:16.120
The ancients among us might remember,

06:16.120 --> 06:18.420
it wasn't that long ago that that was the argument

06:18.420 --> 06:19.840
used against gay marriage.

06:19.840 --> 06:21.920
How am I supposed to explain to my child?

06:21.920 --> 06:24.600
Hang your shitty child for all I care.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.440
McKaylee will just have to figure out

06:26.440 --> 06:28.000
how to navigate a world where the gays

06:28.000 --> 06:30.720
are allowed to kiss in public on her own.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.640
Yes, if you steal my shit, I'm allowed to steal your shit.

06:32.640 --> 06:33.960
That's how it works, whore.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.480
So what people hear when they see these

06:35.480 --> 06:38.640
very intellectually honest thinkers

06:38.640 --> 06:41.320
decrying the cancellation of JK Rowling

06:41.320 --> 06:44.400
is that all Joanne said was that biological sex is real.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.800
And that trans people are being mean to her on the internet

06:46.800 --> 06:50.200
because she was just stating a simple scientific fact, guys.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.360
And all of this stems from an essay Joanne wrote

06:52.360 --> 06:55.000
back in June called Turf Wars,

06:55.000 --> 06:58.680
in which she explained why she was so deeply concerned

06:58.680 --> 07:01.000
about the encroaching menace of trans rights.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.600
Her essay was even awarded

07:02.600 --> 07:05.320
the 2020 Russell Prize by the BBC.

07:05.320 --> 07:07.360
So now we know you can win awards for essays

07:07.360 --> 07:09.000
that have sections ranging from

07:09.000 --> 07:12.160
wild misrepresentations of the truth to flat out lies.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.620
And so for those of you who haven't read it,

07:13.620 --> 07:15.380
which I'm guessing is most of you,

07:15.380 --> 07:18.660
here is a quick rundown of the point she makes in her essay.

07:18.660 --> 07:20.620
I was canceled for liking some tweets

07:20.620 --> 07:21.940
and then standing up for this woman

07:21.940 --> 07:24.800
whose place of employment declined to renew her contract

07:24.800 --> 07:26.100
after her contract expired

07:26.100 --> 07:28.500
because she was a dick to a trans coworker.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.660
For people who don't know,

07:30.660 --> 07:34.580
last December I tweeted my support for Maya Forstater,

07:34.580 --> 07:37.540
a tax specialist who'd lost her job

07:37.540 --> 07:40.620
for what were deemed transphobic tweets.

07:40.620 --> 07:43.300
She took her case to an employment tribunal

07:43.300 --> 07:46.100
asking the judge to rule on whether a philosophical belief

07:46.100 --> 07:49.820
that sex is determined by biology is protected in law.

07:49.820 --> 07:53.220
Judge Taylor ruled that it wasn't.

07:53.220 --> 07:55.740
Here is incidentally what the judge actually said.

07:55.740 --> 07:58.160
I conclude from the totality of the evidence

07:58.160 --> 08:00.700
that Forstater is absolutist in her view of sex

08:00.700 --> 08:02.860
and it is a core component of her belief

08:02.860 --> 08:04.460
that she will refer to a person

08:04.460 --> 08:06.420
by the sex she considers appropriate

08:06.420 --> 08:08.540
even if it violates their dignity

08:08.540 --> 08:11.840
and or creates an intimidating, hostile, degrading,

08:11.880 --> 08:14.280
humiliating, or offensive environment.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.160
The approach is not worthy of respect

08:16.160 --> 08:18.240
in a democratic society.

08:18.240 --> 08:19.400
The erosion of gender norms

08:19.400 --> 08:21.680
negatively affects charities I run

08:21.680 --> 08:23.140
because I might accidentally give money

08:23.140 --> 08:25.340
to a trans domestic abuse survivor

08:25.340 --> 08:28.560
or something about multiple sclerosis.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.600
Think of the children.

08:30.600 --> 08:33.120
I'm an advocate for free speech.

08:33.120 --> 08:36.200
Too many girls who are being brainwashed by the gay agenda,

08:36.200 --> 08:38.880
I mean, radical trans activists,

08:38.880 --> 08:40.160
and they don't actually know what they want

08:40.160 --> 08:41.000
and girls are transitioning

08:41.000 --> 08:42.560
because of internalized misogyny.

08:42.560 --> 08:44.120
Think of the children.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.260
If I was a child today,

08:45.260 --> 08:47.500
I might have fallen in with the wrong crowd

08:47.500 --> 08:49.120
and gotten transed.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.400
Like it's the Crips.

08:53.320 --> 08:54.720
Snoop Dogg over here like.

08:54.720 --> 08:57.080
♪ I keep a black flag hanging on my backside ♪

08:57.080 --> 08:59.880
♪ But only on the left side, yeah that's the side. ♪

08:59.880 --> 09:01.720
Long beach in the house.

09:01.720 --> 09:03.700
Yes, I know Snoop is a problematic.

09:03.700 --> 09:06.080
Leave me a comment about how Snoop is a...

09:06.080 --> 09:08.840
Our once robust gatekeeping systems are being eroded

09:08.840 --> 09:10.480
and now anyone can say I'm a woman

09:10.480 --> 09:12.120
and be recognized as such in the eyes of the law

09:12.120 --> 09:13.680
and I feel threatened by that.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.960
The world is misogynist and porn is bad.

09:15.960 --> 09:18.920
Trans occlusive language is misogynist, actually.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.080
I was an abuse survivor,

09:20.080 --> 09:22.460
so the idea of male-bodied persons

09:22.460 --> 09:24.280
in the bathroom triggers me.

09:24.280 --> 09:25.280
On Saturday morning,

09:25.280 --> 09:27.560
I read that the Scottish government is proceeding

09:27.560 --> 09:30.760
with its controversial gender recognition plans,

09:30.760 --> 09:33.200
which will in effect mean that all a man needs

09:33.200 --> 09:36.840
to become a woman is to say he's one.

09:36.840 --> 09:39.480
To use a very contemporary word,

09:39.480 --> 09:41.680
I was triggered.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.320
I couldn't shut out those memories

09:43.320 --> 09:45.720
and I was finding it hard to contain my anger

09:45.720 --> 09:48.320
and disappointment about the way I believe my government

09:48.320 --> 09:52.120
is playing fast and loose with women's and girls' safety.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.220
This visceral fear reaction was in response

09:54.220 --> 09:58.400
to the Scottish government making transition less gatekeepy.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.040
Men in women's spaces is putting natal women

10:01.040 --> 10:02.520
and girls in danger.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.760
Gender criticals are nice, actually,

10:04.760 --> 10:07.320
and they don't hate the transes.

10:07.320 --> 10:10.300
And finally, think of the children.

10:11.940 --> 10:13.160
Okay.

10:13.160 --> 10:16.640
It would be so much easier to tweet the approved hashtags

10:16.640 --> 10:18.880
because of course trans rights are human rights

10:18.880 --> 10:21.080
and of course trans lives matter.

10:21.080 --> 10:23.480
Scoop up the woke cookies

10:23.480 --> 10:26.720
and bask in a virtue signaling afterglow.

10:26.720 --> 10:31.200
There's joy, relief, and safety in conformity.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.760
Come on, Snoop, work with us.

10:32.760 --> 10:33.640
So I need to make it clear

10:33.640 --> 10:36.040
that I do not care about Joanne Rowling.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.880
I do not care about saving her soul.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.720
I don't care about canceling her.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.840
What I do care about is her influence,

10:41.840 --> 10:44.120
which is why we have to discuss this at all.

10:44.120 --> 10:45.760
But in the context of this video,

10:45.760 --> 10:48.680
I am more interested in why these beliefs

10:48.680 --> 10:51.520
are even in her head in the first place.

10:51.520 --> 10:54.480
Like, where did her belief that trans women

10:54.480 --> 10:58.280
are gonna do a bunch of bathroom assaults even come from?

10:58.280 --> 11:00.400
Because it wasn't reality.

11:00.400 --> 11:03.000
Was it then the movies?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.720
Well, that's a complicated question,

11:06.760 --> 11:08.520
but the answer is yes.

11:08.520 --> 11:10.880
The mother half took over completely.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.480
He was never all Norman,

11:13.440 --> 11:15.960
but he was often only mother.

11:15.960 --> 11:18.640
Why was he dressed like that?

11:18.640 --> 11:20.080
He's a transvestite.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.760
I did not know that the Bates Motel was in California.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.200
Just like us, Snoop.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.800
So before we jump into the roots of transphobic tropes,

11:27.800 --> 11:29.000
we must first acknowledge

11:29.000 --> 11:31.960
that the understanding of sex and gender

11:31.960 --> 11:33.800
is always kind of in flux.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.240
It is a theory that is always evolving.

11:36.240 --> 11:38.640
That said, some very good faith actors

11:38.640 --> 11:39.480
tend to get caught up

11:39.480 --> 11:42.360
in this very hyper-literal interpretation of media,

11:42.360 --> 11:44.880
i.e. a depiction cannot be transphobic

11:44.880 --> 11:45.920
if the depiction in question

11:45.920 --> 11:47.680
is not of a literal trans person.

11:47.680 --> 11:49.440
Now, people are calling the book transphobic

11:49.440 --> 11:50.280
because of this,

11:50.280 --> 11:53.240
because it has a character who is a cis man

11:53.240 --> 11:55.960
who dresses as a woman when killing his victim.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.840
And no, honey, that's not how it works.

11:57.840 --> 11:59.760
While the idea of cross-dressing men

11:59.760 --> 12:02.360
may not be an accurate reflection of trans identity

12:02.360 --> 12:03.800
as we conceive it today,

12:03.800 --> 12:06.520
it certainly influenced the mainstream understanding

12:06.520 --> 12:08.840
of what trans identity even is.

12:08.840 --> 12:11.320
So a lot of the characters that we are going to talk about

12:11.320 --> 12:14.280
are not trans as we'd consider them.

12:14.280 --> 12:16.040
When a straight man puts on a dress

12:16.040 --> 12:19.440
and gets his sexual kicks, he is a transvestite.

12:19.440 --> 12:22.440
When a man is a woman trapped in a man's body

12:22.440 --> 12:25.680
and has the little operation, he is a transsexual.

12:25.680 --> 12:26.520
I know that.

12:26.520 --> 12:29.320
And before we go any further, big old content warning,

12:29.880 --> 12:30.720
because it is one thing to kind of, you know,

12:30.720 --> 12:32.160
know about the tropes,

12:32.160 --> 12:34.960
but to like see them in rapid fire succession,

12:36.040 --> 12:37.560
you know, it's a lot.

12:38.600 --> 12:40.840
Like, I don't even have any skin in the game

12:40.840 --> 12:43.200
and it's still a lot.

12:43.200 --> 12:47.320
So here's your warning.

12:47.320 --> 12:48.240
In Western culture,

12:48.240 --> 12:50.120
cross-dressing has often been used

12:50.120 --> 12:51.840
as a shorthand for deception,

12:51.840 --> 12:54.320
but not always maliciously so.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.000
In fact, for most of history,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.880
cross-dressing men are portrayed as neutral

12:58.880 --> 13:00.920
or more often comical.

13:00.920 --> 13:03.040
In the Iliad, Achilles tries to get out of war

13:03.040 --> 13:04.160
by dressing as a woman,

13:04.160 --> 13:05.360
but Odysseus figures him out

13:05.360 --> 13:07.000
when he gives Achilles a gift of perfume

13:07.000 --> 13:09.120
and Achilles doesn't lose his shit over the gift,

13:09.120 --> 13:11.000
you know, like women do.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.240
In Shakespeare's Twelfth Night,

13:12.240 --> 13:14.880
protagonist Viola takes up service for Duke Orsinio

13:14.880 --> 13:17.080
disguised as a young man named Cesario.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.560
After some comic misunderstanding

13:18.560 --> 13:19.920
and then lots of cross-dressing,

13:19.920 --> 13:22.240
Viola's identity is revealed and it's fine,

13:22.240 --> 13:24.400
compulsory heterosexuality all around.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.600
The benign cross-dresser motif remained popular

13:26.600 --> 13:27.920
well into the 20th century

13:27.920 --> 13:30.240
with entries like Bosom Buddies, Tootsie,

13:30.240 --> 13:34.200
Some Like It Hot, and White Chicks.

13:34.200 --> 13:38.200
♪ And I need you, and I miss you ♪

13:39.720 --> 13:41.840
Billy Wilder's classic comedy Some Like It Hot

13:41.840 --> 13:44.200
in particular depicts a fun, harmless version

13:44.200 --> 13:47.000
of the very scenario Joanne seems so worried about.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.480
I feel naked, I feel like everybody's staring at me.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.080
With those legs, are you crazy?

13:51.080 --> 13:51.920
Now come on.

13:51.920 --> 13:55.320
Men dressing up as women to gain access to women's spaces.

13:55.320 --> 13:57.760
Now in this film, it's because the two men are in hiding.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.400
Two musicians witness a mob hit,

13:59.400 --> 14:01.880
so they dress up as women and join an all-female band

14:01.880 --> 14:03.280
to disguise themselves.

14:03.280 --> 14:05.360
Both of them fall for the band's lead vocalist,

14:05.360 --> 14:07.600
Sugar Cane, played by Marilyn Monroe.

14:07.600 --> 14:08.800
Well, see you around, girl.

14:08.800 --> 14:09.920
Bye, sugar.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.360
And compete for her affections

14:11.360 --> 14:13.440
despite her thinking that they're women.

14:13.440 --> 14:14.920
No butter, no pastry.

14:14.920 --> 14:15.880
We're on a diet.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.200
Oh yeah, well, sure.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.120
But Some Like It Hot is not only considered

14:19.120 --> 14:21.360
to be one of the greatest comedies of all time,

14:21.360 --> 14:24.240
its freewheeling approach to gender and even sexuality

14:24.240 --> 14:26.400
is widely considered to be the nail in the coffin

14:26.400 --> 14:27.360
for the Hays Code,

14:27.360 --> 14:29.040
as it was released without its approval

14:29.040 --> 14:31.000
and was a huge success anyway.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.280
The deception is revealed at the end

14:32.280 --> 14:34.960
with no hard feelings and an ending that...

14:34.960 --> 14:36.760
I'm good on level with you.

14:36.760 --> 14:38.320
We can't get married at all.

14:38.320 --> 14:39.160
Why not?

14:40.840 --> 14:42.360
I'm a man.

14:42.360 --> 14:44.400
Well, nobody's perfect.

14:44.400 --> 14:47.000
Well, I wouldn't even call this a happy hetero ending.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I use the example of Some Like It Hot

14:50.000 --> 14:51.840
to illustrate that even in the 1950s,

14:51.840 --> 14:53.360
a time of heightened anxiety

14:53.360 --> 14:55.320
over all things gender and sexuality,

14:55.320 --> 14:56.480
Kinsey,

14:56.480 --> 14:59.240
cross-dressing wasn't considered inherently deviant.

14:59.240 --> 15:00.920
However, in all of the above examples,

15:00.920 --> 15:03.800
the male protagonist's heterosexuality is not in question.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.480
The joke is that we, the audience,

15:05.480 --> 15:07.560
know the hero's true nature,

15:07.560 --> 15:09.400
but the other characters do not.

15:09.400 --> 15:10.840
But the more, shall we say,

15:10.840 --> 15:12.960
influential representation of cross-dressing

15:12.960 --> 15:14.560
to Joanne's concerns

15:14.560 --> 15:17.600
also involves discovery about the truth

15:17.600 --> 15:19.280
of a character's body.

15:19.280 --> 15:23.480
Such revelation, however, is not comic, but horrific.

15:23.480 --> 15:26.280
So, what changed?

15:26.280 --> 15:30.280
♪♪♪♪♪

15:30.280 --> 15:32.880
Ed Gein was born in Wisconsin in 1906,

15:32.880 --> 15:34.800
the son of an abusive alcoholic father

15:34.800 --> 15:36.680
and a domineering, hyper-religious mother

15:36.680 --> 15:39.520
who only let her kids leave their remote property for school,

15:39.520 --> 15:41.120
even going so far as to punish Ed

15:41.120 --> 15:42.520
when he tried to make friends.

15:42.520 --> 15:43.720
Ed's mother, Agatha,

15:43.720 --> 15:45.680
was a hellfire and brimstone preacher

15:45.680 --> 15:46.880
who preached to her sons

15:46.880 --> 15:48.800
about the innate immorality of the world,

15:48.800 --> 15:50.080
the evils of drinking,

15:50.080 --> 15:52.840
and her belief that all women, apart from herself,

15:52.840 --> 15:54.080
were naturally promiscuous

15:54.080 --> 15:55.480
and the instruments of the devil.

15:55.480 --> 15:58.400
When she died in 1945, Ed was devastated.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.120
In the words of one of his biographers,

16:00.120 --> 16:03.320
he had lost his only friend and one true love.

16:03.320 --> 16:06.040
On the morning of November 16th, 1957,

16:06.040 --> 16:09.600
Plainfield hardware store owner Bernice Worden disappeared.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.600
Later that evening,

16:10.600 --> 16:12.360
the Washara County Sheriff's Department

16:12.640 --> 16:14.440
discovered Worden's decapitated body

16:14.440 --> 16:16.960
in a shed on Ed Gein's property,

16:16.960 --> 16:18.720
hung upside down by her legs

16:18.720 --> 16:20.320
with a crossbar at her ankles

16:20.320 --> 16:22.000
and ropes at her wrists,

16:22.000 --> 16:23.840
dressed out like a deer.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.720
Gein not only admitted to the murders of Worden

16:25.720 --> 16:27.160
and at least one other woman,

16:27.160 --> 16:30.000
he'd also spent the last decade digging up graves

16:30.000 --> 16:31.680
and exhuming the corpses of women

16:31.680 --> 16:33.720
who looked like his mother.

16:33.720 --> 16:34.880
He took the bodies home

16:34.880 --> 16:38.000
where he tanned their skins to make his paraphernalia.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.720
This paraphernalia included,

16:39.720 --> 16:41.320
but was not limited to,

16:41.320 --> 16:43.680
a waist basket made of human skin,

16:43.680 --> 16:45.800
chair seats made out of human skin,

16:45.800 --> 16:47.560
a corset made from a female torso

16:47.560 --> 16:49.360
skinned from the shoulders to the waist,

16:49.360 --> 16:51.480
leggings made from human skin,

16:51.480 --> 16:53.880
masks made from the skin of female heads,

16:53.880 --> 16:56.640
a lampshade made from the skin of a human face.

16:56.640 --> 16:57.680
You get the idea.

16:57.680 --> 17:00.000
There are other more infamous killers, sure,

17:00.000 --> 17:03.240
but none seem to be so inspiring.

17:03.240 --> 17:05.760
The country was fascinated by Ed Gein,

17:05.760 --> 17:08.280
particularly the type of menace he represented,

17:08.280 --> 17:11.200
a sexual deviant, an Oedipal nightmare,

17:11.200 --> 17:13.160
depicted in the press as a feminine

17:13.160 --> 17:15.120
and gender confused man.

17:15.120 --> 17:17.400
Here, the guise of femininity does not hide

17:17.400 --> 17:20.320
or empower a clever heterosexual man,

17:20.320 --> 17:22.200
but reveals a sexual deviant,

17:22.200 --> 17:24.800
a man in gender distress.

17:24.800 --> 17:33.200
Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho changed cinema in a lot of ways,

17:33.200 --> 17:35.240
and deservedly so, in my opinion.

17:35.240 --> 17:36.840
It's my favorite Hitchcock film.

17:36.840 --> 17:39.560
Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh are iconic in their roles

17:39.560 --> 17:41.760
as Norman Bates and Marion Crane.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.800
Techniques that may seem like old hat now

17:43.800 --> 17:46.480
seem that way because Hitchcock was the originator.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.160
We all go a little mad sometimes.

17:48.160 --> 17:52.760
Haven't you?

17:52.760 --> 17:55.320
The plot revolves around the murder of Marion Crane,

17:55.320 --> 17:56.680
who stops at the Bates Motel

17:56.680 --> 17:58.920
after stealing a bunch of money from her workplace.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.480
While staying at the Bates Motel,

18:00.480 --> 18:02.120
Marion realizes her mistake

18:02.120 --> 18:04.520
and decides to go back to her workplace to make amends,

18:04.520 --> 18:05.640
but before she can...

18:06.440 --> 18:09.960
Ow! Ow! No! Ow!

18:09.960 --> 18:12.240
...she's murdered by Norman's mother.

18:12.240 --> 18:14.560
Of course, the twist at the end is that Norman's mother

18:14.560 --> 18:16.640
is actually Norman Bates in drag.

18:16.640 --> 18:18.440
The film does not reveal Norman's identity

18:18.440 --> 18:21.080
as murderer and crossdresser until the end,

18:21.080 --> 18:23.440
in a scene that admittedly did not age well.

18:23.440 --> 18:28.640
Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat!

18:28.640 --> 18:30.040
It would be accurate to say

18:30.040 --> 18:32.040
that this isn't even really crossdressing.

18:32.040 --> 18:33.840
It's a transvestite.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.440
Uh, not exactly.

18:35.440 --> 18:36.640
Like Ed Gein before him,

18:36.640 --> 18:39.240
Norman is diagnosed with a schizotypal disorder.

18:39.240 --> 18:40.840
He doesn't want to be a woman.

18:40.840 --> 18:42.240
He just hears voices.

18:42.240 --> 18:45.640
He quite literally believes he is his mother.

18:45.640 --> 18:50.040
Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.840
But in terms of things that literally

18:51.840 --> 18:53.440
actually happen on the screen,

18:53.440 --> 18:56.640
Psycho is a film about a man dressing as a woman

18:56.640 --> 18:58.840
while he predates on other women.

18:58.840 --> 19:01.440
First, he leers at them in a way that makes it seem

19:02.440 --> 19:04.640
First, he leers at them in the bathroom,

19:04.640 --> 19:06.440
and then he kills them in the bathroom.

19:06.440 --> 19:09.440
And he predates on women because they are women,

19:09.440 --> 19:11.440
specifically because the mother personality

19:11.440 --> 19:13.840
is threatened by Norman's attraction to them.

19:13.840 --> 19:15.240
Mother, she's just a stranger.

19:15.240 --> 19:17.040
She's hungry and it's raining out.

19:17.040 --> 19:19.240
Mother, she's just a stranger.

19:19.240 --> 19:21.840
But it's men who desire strangers.

19:21.840 --> 19:24.640
And where is this most iconic of movie scenes set

19:24.640 --> 19:26.240
where this woman is preyed upon,

19:26.240 --> 19:28.640
but the place where she is most vulnerable?

19:28.640 --> 19:30.040
The bathroom.

19:32.440 --> 19:34.440
Thus, it is the figure of Ed Gein

19:34.440 --> 19:36.440
and his fictional counterpart, Norman Bates,

19:36.440 --> 19:38.440
who have captured the imagination of filmmakers

19:38.440 --> 19:41.040
and novelists rather than other serial killers.

19:41.040 --> 19:44.440
Because Psycho is inspired by real-life events, right?

19:44.440 --> 19:46.440
This idea of the cross-dressing serial killer

19:46.440 --> 19:49.840
wasn't made up out of whole cloth, right?

19:49.840 --> 19:50.640
It was.

19:50.640 --> 19:53.040
Life magazine, which ran an eight-page pictorial

19:53.040 --> 19:54.240
sporting the headline,

19:54.240 --> 19:56.240
House of Horror Stuns the Nation,

19:56.240 --> 19:57.840
two weeks after Gein's arrest,

19:57.840 --> 20:00.440
announced that Gein wished he were a woman

20:01.040 --> 20:02.640
After an unidentified investigator

20:02.640 --> 20:05.240
supplied the Milwaukee Journal with information on Gein,

20:05.240 --> 20:07.440
the November 21st issue of the journal ran a story

20:07.440 --> 20:10.440
claiming that Gein's unnatural attachment to his mother

20:10.440 --> 20:12.240
caused an Oedipus complex

20:12.240 --> 20:14.640
that resulted in Ed wishing he had been a woman

20:14.640 --> 20:15.640
instead of a man

20:15.640 --> 20:17.240
and wondering whether it would be possible

20:17.240 --> 20:18.440
to change his sex.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.440
He considered inquiring about an operation

20:20.440 --> 20:21.440
to change into a woman

20:21.440 --> 20:24.240
and even thought about trying the operation upon himself,

20:24.240 --> 20:26.040
but did nothing about such plans.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.240
But here's the thing.

20:27.240 --> 20:28.840
None of it is true.

20:28.840 --> 20:30.040
All of these are slipped to the press

20:30.040 --> 20:33.040
before any real psychoanalysis of the Gein had been done

20:33.040 --> 20:35.840
and none of the psychiatrists who actually analyzed him

20:35.840 --> 20:38.040
concluded that he had any sort of tendencies

20:38.040 --> 20:40.840
towards transvestism or even homosexuality.

20:40.840 --> 20:44.040
Indeed, he seemed pretty honking straight

20:44.040 --> 20:48.640
and resented women just like most serial killers do.

20:48.640 --> 20:51.440
Thus, in part, Gein's infamy resided in an indication

20:51.440 --> 20:53.240
that he was not fully masculine

20:53.240 --> 20:56.640
in an era that was obsessed with proper forms of masculinity.

20:56.640 --> 20:58.840
Ed Gein is remembered as effeminate,

20:58.840 --> 21:01.440
a transvestite, or transsexual,

21:01.440 --> 21:05.640
as well as the narrative trope that explained his psychosis.

21:05.640 --> 21:07.440
And Ed Gein and the character of Norman Bates

21:07.440 --> 21:10.240
are often cited as the first examples of this trope,

21:10.240 --> 21:13.240
but that's actually not entirely true either.

21:13.240 --> 21:15.240
The book Gender-Bending Detective Fiction

21:15.240 --> 21:17.640
cites the 1950 detective novel

21:17.640 --> 21:20.640
Vengeance is Mine by Frank Morris and Spillane,

21:20.640 --> 21:22.840
which centers around a transgender killer

21:22.840 --> 21:25.040
who the detective has felt some attraction to,

21:25.240 --> 21:26.640
as an earlier example,

21:26.640 --> 21:28.440
and that was published seven years

21:28.440 --> 21:30.640
before Ed Gein even got caught.

21:30.640 --> 21:34.040
So, Gein and Psycho may have been the codifiers,

21:34.040 --> 21:35.840
but they weren't the first example

21:35.840 --> 21:38.040
of the murderous crossdresser.

21:38.040 --> 21:41.440
That idea was already there

21:41.440 --> 21:45.040
because the anxiety over gender roles was already there.

21:45.040 --> 21:46.240
Gen Z.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.640
We just needed an excuse to make hay out of it.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.840
So, thanks, Ed Gein.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.240
According to Richard Tithicott,

21:53.240 --> 21:54.840
author of Men and Monsters,

21:54.840 --> 21:57.640
Jeffrey Dahmer, and the Construction of the Serial Killer,

21:57.640 --> 21:59.840
we fail to read the serial killer accurately

21:59.840 --> 22:03.440
because he is an embodiment of society's dominant values.

22:03.440 --> 22:06.040
As a culture, we are so unable to admit or recognize

22:06.040 --> 22:08.640
the connection between our dominant forms of masculinity

22:08.640 --> 22:10.440
and violent misogynist crimes

22:10.440 --> 22:12.840
that we must attribute some other kind of motive to them

22:12.840 --> 22:14.240
besides masculinity.

22:14.240 --> 22:17.240
Instead, motive is attributed to perceived gender deviance,

22:17.240 --> 22:19.040
in particular, the men coveting

22:19.040 --> 22:20.840
or assuming the mantle of femininity

22:20.840 --> 22:24.640
through gender identification or homosexual object choice.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.440
What is the first and principal thing he does?

22:26.440 --> 22:29.840
What needs does he serve by killing?

22:29.840 --> 22:32.840
Acceptance in sexual frustrations.

22:32.840 --> 22:35.840
No, he covets.

22:35.840 --> 22:38.240
The 70s and 80s saw an explosion of films

22:38.240 --> 22:39.640
featuring all sorts of plays

22:39.640 --> 22:41.640
on the murderous crossdresser trope,

22:41.640 --> 22:43.240
with titles like

22:43.240 --> 22:44.640
Deadly Blessing,

22:44.640 --> 22:46.440
No Way to Treat a Lady,

22:46.440 --> 22:49.040
Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde,

22:49.040 --> 22:50.240
Deranged,

22:50.240 --> 22:51.640
Homicidal,

22:51.640 --> 22:52.840
Private Parts,

22:52.840 --> 22:54.040
not that Private Parts,

22:54.040 --> 22:55.640
Stripped to Kill,

22:55.640 --> 22:57.240
Three on a Meat Hook,

22:57.240 --> 22:58.640
Relentless,

22:58.640 --> 22:59.440
Three.

22:59.440 --> 23:01.040
And of course, the most infamous of these

23:01.040 --> 23:04.240
is Brian De Palma's psycho ripoff, Dressed to Kill,

23:04.240 --> 23:06.640
wherein the killer isn't incidentally a crossdresser,

23:06.640 --> 23:07.440
like Norman Bates,

23:07.440 --> 23:09.640
but a canon transsexual.

23:09.640 --> 23:11.240
You see, there's some men and women, too,

23:11.240 --> 23:12.840
think they're born in the wrong body.

23:12.840 --> 23:14.440
They're called transsexuals.

23:14.440 --> 23:17.240
And all they want to do is have their sex changed.

23:17.240 --> 23:19.240
Most include elements of the Gein mythos,

23:19.240 --> 23:22.040
stealing women's body parts after the deed is done,

23:22.040 --> 23:23.840
gender confusion,

23:23.840 --> 23:25.640
which brings us to,

23:25.640 --> 23:26.840
of course,

23:26.840 --> 23:28.840
the act you've all been waiting for.

23:31.640 --> 23:32.840
Goodbye.

23:38.840 --> 23:41.040
So, Silence of the Lambs,

23:41.040 --> 23:42.640
like Psycho before it,

23:42.640 --> 23:44.440
has the problem of

23:44.440 --> 23:46.240
being one of the best movies ever made.

23:46.240 --> 23:47.240
God damn it.

23:47.240 --> 23:49.240
See, this is why good movies are dangerous.

23:49.240 --> 23:49.840
This is...

23:49.840 --> 23:51.040
All movies are bad.

23:52.040 --> 23:53.240
Isn't that right, Snoop?

23:53.240 --> 23:56.040
You regret Mac and Devin go to high school, don't you?

24:01.640 --> 24:04.040
Silence of the Lambs is the story of Clarice Starling,

24:04.040 --> 24:05.640
a student at the FBI Academy

24:05.640 --> 24:07.040
who's on the verge of becoming an agent

24:07.040 --> 24:08.640
when she's tasked with profiling

24:08.640 --> 24:11.040
the cannibal serial killer Hannibal Lecter.

24:11.040 --> 24:14.440
I ate his liver with some fava beans

24:14.440 --> 24:16.440
and a nice Chianti.

24:17.840 --> 24:19.640
Pfft.

24:19.640 --> 24:21.640
Hannibal has no interest in being profiled,

24:21.640 --> 24:24.640
but he takes a liking to Clarice in his sociopath way,

24:24.640 --> 24:25.840
and he starts giving her clues

24:25.840 --> 24:28.240
to help solve the real active serial killer case

24:28.240 --> 24:29.440
going on in the world,

24:29.440 --> 24:30.840
that of Buffalo Bill,

24:30.840 --> 24:32.440
so named because he...

24:32.440 --> 24:34.240
Likes to skin his humps.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.640
...gender and power dynamics

24:35.640 --> 24:37.640
are very much at the heart of the film,

24:37.640 --> 24:40.240
which deliberately sort of flips the male gaze.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.640
Her boss doesn't respect her,

24:41.640 --> 24:43.440
her colleagues leer at her,

24:43.440 --> 24:45.440
others in position of authority turn cold

24:45.440 --> 24:47.840
when she politely refuses their advances.

24:47.840 --> 24:49.440
You know, we get a lot of detectives here,

24:49.440 --> 24:52.440
but I must say, I can't ever remember one as attractive.

24:55.440 --> 24:58.440
Only Barney, one of the orderlies at the mental institution,

24:58.440 --> 25:00.840
and Hannibal Lecter, a convicted serial killer,

25:00.840 --> 25:02.840
treat Clarice with any respect.

25:02.840 --> 25:04.040
In contrast to Lecter,

25:04.040 --> 25:07.040
Bill is presented as a deviant and coded hideously queer,

25:07.040 --> 25:10.640
a gay man who lisps and cavorts around his dungeon basement,

25:10.640 --> 25:12.440
listening to Goodbye Horses

25:12.440 --> 25:15.240
and carrying around a poodle named Precious.

25:15.640 --> 25:18.040
Yes, you will, Precious. You'll forget the horse.

25:18.040 --> 25:19.440
The first thing we learn about him

25:19.440 --> 25:21.040
before we even know who he is

25:21.040 --> 25:23.240
is that he had a gay cross-dressing lover

25:23.240 --> 25:25.240
whom he's implied to have killed.

25:25.240 --> 25:27.440
Lecter is a gentleman and a scholar,

25:27.440 --> 25:28.640
Bill is low-class,

25:28.640 --> 25:30.840
and has a Hedwig and the Angry Inch aesthetic.

25:30.840 --> 25:33.040
Lecter appreciates femininity.

25:33.040 --> 25:35.040
Bill wants to appropriate it.

25:35.040 --> 25:37.040
Aaaaah!

25:37.040 --> 25:39.040
Ha! Ha! Aaaaah!

25:39.040 --> 25:41.040
The framing suggests that Bill is monstrous

25:41.040 --> 25:42.640
not so much through his killing,

25:42.640 --> 25:44.640
after all, Lecter is a killer too,

25:44.640 --> 25:46.440
but because he's a man who sews,

25:46.440 --> 25:47.440
wears makeup,

25:47.440 --> 25:49.440
and desires a sex change operation,

25:49.440 --> 25:51.040
even though he's...

25:51.040 --> 25:53.040
Not a real transsexual.

25:53.040 --> 25:55.040
But he thinks he is. He tries to be.

25:55.040 --> 25:57.440
He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.840
So Thomas Harris seemed to understand

25:59.840 --> 26:02.840
that he was putting something potentially harmful

26:02.840 --> 26:04.040
into the world

26:04.040 --> 26:06.840
about a group that was already stigmatized.

26:06.840 --> 26:08.640
So the film adds this caveat

26:08.640 --> 26:11.240
about how Buffalo Bill isn't a real tran,

26:11.240 --> 26:12.840
while Clarice makes it clear to Lecter,

26:12.840 --> 26:14.440
and by extension the viewer,

26:14.440 --> 26:16.040
that trans people as a group

26:16.040 --> 26:18.040
don't pose any inherent danger.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.640
There's no correlation in the literature

26:19.640 --> 26:21.440
between transsexualism and violence.

26:21.440 --> 26:23.040
Transsexuals are very passive.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.440
But these little disclaimers

26:24.440 --> 26:25.640
aren't what linger in your mind

26:25.640 --> 26:27.040
when you think of Buffalo Bill.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.840
In fact, everyone I've asked about it

26:28.840 --> 26:31.240
does not even remember this line is even there.

26:31.240 --> 26:33.240
But you know what they do remember?

26:33.240 --> 26:35.240
I'd fuck myself.

26:35.240 --> 26:37.640
He's making himself a woman's suit, Mr. Crawford,

26:37.640 --> 26:38.640
out of real women.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.040
Aaaaah!

26:41.040 --> 26:43.040
I'd fuck myself.

26:44.040 --> 26:46.640
So Silence of the Lambs comes out,

26:46.640 --> 26:50.240
and suddenly those lying duplicitous transes are everywhere.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.640
During this era, if a character is transgender,

26:52.640 --> 26:55.640
it's usually tied to some dark and horrible secret

26:55.640 --> 26:56.440
in the narrative.

26:56.440 --> 26:59.640
And the revelation about the truth of their body

26:59.640 --> 27:01.640
typically is revealed simultaneously

27:01.640 --> 27:04.640
with the revelation of another secret of some sort.

27:04.640 --> 27:06.640
That the person is a liar,

27:06.640 --> 27:09.040
a criminal, or even a killer.

27:09.040 --> 27:11.040
In 1991's Soap Dish,

27:11.040 --> 27:13.440
a scheming actress named Montana Moorhead

27:13.440 --> 27:16.640
is trying to steal Sally Fields' job as a soap opera star

27:16.640 --> 27:17.840
by sleeping her way to the top.

27:17.840 --> 27:19.040
Only for it to be revealed

27:19.040 --> 27:21.440
that Montana used to be Milton Moorhead.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.640
She was...

27:23.640 --> 27:28.040
Milton Moorhead of Syosset, Long Island.

27:28.040 --> 27:31.040
Hello.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.840
And she flees the set in shame

27:32.840 --> 27:35.440
as the cast and crew look on in shock and horror.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.040
Montana's transgender reveal

27:37.040 --> 27:38.840
elucidates her deceitful nature.

27:38.840 --> 27:40.640
If she lied about being trans,

27:40.640 --> 27:42.240
then she's a liar at heart.

27:42.240 --> 27:43.840
And also a slut.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.440
This is my moment.

27:45.440 --> 27:46.640
I have to seize it.

27:46.640 --> 27:49.040
In 1992's The Crying Game,

27:49.040 --> 27:50.240
an otherwise gritty drama

27:50.240 --> 27:52.440
that was nominated for a bunch of Oscars,

27:52.440 --> 27:54.440
a woman has an affair with a man

27:54.440 --> 27:56.840
who killed her boyfriend,

27:56.840 --> 27:58.040
but she doesn't know that.

27:58.040 --> 28:00.040
And, you know, it's progressing pretty normally

28:00.040 --> 28:04.240
when, blammo!

28:04.240 --> 28:05.440
You did know, didn't you?

28:05.440 --> 28:09.040
Straight to the toilet.

28:09.240 --> 28:11.440
Although I don't super want to misrepresent this movie,

28:11.440 --> 28:14.040
like, it is one of the more, like,

28:14.040 --> 28:16.240
sensitive and nuanced takes

28:16.240 --> 28:20.040
we would see for the next 20 years.

28:20.040 --> 28:21.640
And I also, like, gotta give it credit

28:21.640 --> 28:24.040
for its, like, weirdly sweet ending.

28:24.040 --> 28:25.440
But it does seem to be the first example

28:25.440 --> 28:29.440
of a trope that was going to be

28:29.440 --> 28:30.840
really tiresome.

28:30.840 --> 28:32.640
In Naked Gun, 33 and 1 3rd,

28:32.640 --> 28:35.440
detective Frank Drebin has an on-and-off flirtation

28:35.440 --> 28:36.440
with the villain's girlfriend,

28:36.440 --> 28:38.440
played by Anna Nicole Smith,

28:38.440 --> 28:41.240
which culminates with her undressing for him in silhouette,

28:41.240 --> 28:49.840
revealing this.

28:49.840 --> 28:56.640
And Frank reacts.

28:56.640 --> 28:59.040
But perhaps the most notorious example from this era

28:59.040 --> 29:01.440
comes from Ace Ventura Pet Detective,

29:01.440 --> 29:03.840
wherein it is revealed that a female police detective

29:03.840 --> 29:06.040
that Ace kisses earlier in the film

29:06.040 --> 29:09.840
is the same person as one of Ace's dolphin-kidnapping suspects,

29:09.840 --> 29:11.640
who happens to be a man, honey,

29:11.640 --> 29:14.840
a crazy one that went to a mental institution and everything.

29:14.840 --> 29:17.840
We're talking paranoid delusional psychosis.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.240
I saw the guy's room.

29:19.240 --> 29:21.840
It's cozy if you're Hannibal Lecter.

29:21.840 --> 29:24.640
And when he figures this out, of course.

29:24.640 --> 29:27.240
Oh, my God!

29:27.240 --> 29:33.840
Einhorn is a man!

29:33.840 --> 29:36.240
Then at the end, when Ace reveals her former identity

29:36.240 --> 29:38.840
by forcibly exposing the bulge in her underwear

29:38.840 --> 29:40.840
to practically her entire police department

29:40.840 --> 29:42.840
at the end of the movie,

29:42.840 --> 29:50.440
wait for it.

29:50.440 --> 29:53.040
One of the major indicators of trans women's villainy

29:53.040 --> 29:57.240
in these movies is that they do not disclose their trans status.

29:57.240 --> 30:00.840
Their trans status is used as shorthand for their duplicitous ways.

30:00.840 --> 30:03.240
The nauseating revelation that they're trans

30:03.240 --> 30:06.040
is typically treated as more shocking and important

30:06.040 --> 30:08.240
than any actual crime they've committed.

30:08.240 --> 30:11.440
There's no meaningful difference made between finding out a woman is trans

30:11.440 --> 30:13.240
and discovering that she's a criminal.

30:13.240 --> 30:17.040
There's also a sort of phobia of intersex and non-binary people, too,

30:17.040 --> 30:19.440
that was, I don't want to say all the rage as much,

30:19.440 --> 30:21.440
but it was definitely a thing in the 90s.

30:21.440 --> 30:24.440
Pat from SNL was a well-known example from this era,

30:24.440 --> 30:28.840
the joke being that no one can ever figure out if Pat is a man or a woman.

30:28.840 --> 30:34.440
I was in love with someone who was not what they appeared to be.

30:34.440 --> 30:38.240
Well, and what was it that Chris appeared to be, exactly?

30:38.240 --> 30:40.240
A decent human being.

30:40.240 --> 30:43.240
And this was a character popular enough that they even got their own movie.

30:43.240 --> 30:44.840
We got it in Spaceballs 2.

30:44.840 --> 30:49.640
I'm the bearded lady, but are you one of the freaks?

30:49.640 --> 30:55.040
And in a 1998 episode of South Park entitled

30:55.040 --> 30:57.240
Cartman's mom is still a dirty slut.

30:57.240 --> 31:00.040
Cartman's mom is revealed to be intersex.

31:00.040 --> 31:02.440
You're a big fat ass, and your mom's a hermaphrodite!

31:02.440 --> 31:04.640
I'm sorry I never told you, Eric.

31:04.640 --> 31:09.640
But because she is a dirty slut, she also has slept with every man in South Park,

31:09.640 --> 31:13.240
and when they find out about this...

31:13.240 --> 31:15.440
She was a he?

31:15.440 --> 31:18.240
No, no, not exactly, but she did have a penis.

31:19.840 --> 31:20.840
One joke.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.040
One joke.

31:23.040 --> 31:25.240
Yeah, this was eventually retconned, but who cares?

31:25.240 --> 31:28.040
And yes, of course, there's Mr. Garrison.

31:28.040 --> 31:31.440
But I paid $5,000 to be a woman.

31:31.440 --> 31:33.640
This would mean I'm not really a woman.

31:33.640 --> 31:37.040
I'm just a guy with a mutilated penis.

31:37.040 --> 31:38.440
Basically, yes.

31:38.440 --> 31:40.440
If we talked about South Park, we'd be here all day.

31:40.440 --> 31:41.640
I don't really care.

31:41.640 --> 31:44.640
And in the 2000s, the bro comedy emerges.

31:44.640 --> 31:46.040
Dude, where's my car?

31:46.040 --> 31:47.640
In 2000's Dude, Where's My Car?

31:47.640 --> 31:50.840
a stripper gives a couple of stoners money for safekeeping

31:50.840 --> 31:54.440
and reveals her trans status when she demands it back, and...

31:56.240 --> 31:57.640
No!

31:57.640 --> 31:59.440
Oh, dude, you're a dude!

32:02.840 --> 32:06.240
Guys, if the mere sight of a penis makes you want to hurl,

32:06.240 --> 32:09.240
like, how do you live with yourselves? I don't get it.

32:09.240 --> 32:13.240
The trans surprise is there in The 40-Year-Old Virgin and The Hangover 2.

32:13.240 --> 32:17.040
Both have their reveal and the idea of deception and shame for attraction

32:17.040 --> 32:19.640
and or sexual relation with a trans woman.

32:19.640 --> 32:22.640
You know what? Hiring a transvestite prostitute isn't helping me, man.

32:22.640 --> 32:24.640
What? Ain't nobody hiring no damn transvestite.

32:24.640 --> 32:26.040
What? What are you talking about?

32:26.040 --> 32:28.040
She was really nice, incidentally.

32:28.040 --> 32:31.440
But at least they've stopped puking.

32:31.440 --> 32:33.240
You in Bangkok, sweetie?

32:33.240 --> 32:35.040
That's the reason they don't call it Bangkok.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.040
Oh!

32:36.040 --> 32:39.040
Also noteworthy that most of these characters are sex workers.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.040
In Family Guy, it pops up a few times,

32:41.040 --> 32:43.840
most notably in an episode called Quagmire's Dad,

32:43.840 --> 32:47.840
where it is revealed that Quagmire's Dad transitioned at some point

32:47.840 --> 32:50.440
after fathering Quagmire.

32:50.440 --> 32:54.440
Brian sleeps with her, and when he finds out...

33:09.440 --> 33:10.440
Are you done?

33:13.440 --> 33:15.440
This scene goes on for a minute.

33:18.440 --> 33:21.440
Trans panic puke walked so attack helicopter could fly.

33:21.440 --> 33:22.440
Literally.

33:27.440 --> 33:31.440
Also, like, Quagmire's Dad slept with a dog.

33:31.440 --> 33:34.440
And the dog is the nauseated one in this scenario.

33:39.440 --> 33:41.440
But it wasn't in just stuff for bros.

33:41.440 --> 33:44.440
In a 2000 episode of Sex and the City called...

33:44.440 --> 33:46.440
Cock-a-doodle-doo,

33:47.040 --> 33:50.040
Samantha's not thrilled with the, uh...

33:50.040 --> 33:51.040
There they were.

33:51.040 --> 33:54.040
Samantha's friendly neighborhood pre-op transsexual hookers.

33:54.040 --> 33:55.040
Oh, hey.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.040
Sex workers and women of color.

33:56.040 --> 33:57.040
Nice.

33:57.040 --> 33:59.040
I am paying a fortune to live in a neighborhood

33:59.040 --> 34:02.040
that's trendy by day and tr-y by night.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.040
It's like...

34:03.040 --> 34:06.040
It's like sometimes it starts to be okay, and then...

34:06.040 --> 34:07.040
Aha!

34:07.040 --> 34:09.040
Don't I know it?

34:09.040 --> 34:12.040
Samantha always knew how to get her way with men.

34:12.040 --> 34:14.040
Oh, goddammit, Curie.

34:14.640 --> 34:17.640
They party at the end of the episode, so it's fine, I guess, but...

34:17.640 --> 34:18.640
Oh, no.

34:22.640 --> 34:23.640
This episode is just...

34:23.640 --> 34:24.640
It's...

34:24.640 --> 34:26.640
It's so cringe.

34:26.640 --> 34:29.640
No, Sarah Jessica Parker, stop.

34:29.640 --> 34:30.640
Stop.

34:30.640 --> 34:32.640
Oh, what are you doing? No.

34:32.640 --> 34:34.640
I don't know, there's something about the well-meaningness

34:34.640 --> 34:36.640
that makes it even more cringe.

34:36.640 --> 34:37.640
Don't worry.

34:37.640 --> 34:39.640
They have a very lovely life.

34:39.640 --> 34:42.640
GLAAD did a survey of the representation of trans people

34:43.240 --> 34:45.240
on television from 2002 to 2012,

34:45.240 --> 34:48.240
most of which cataloged procedurals like

34:48.240 --> 34:50.240
NCIS and Law & Order and...

34:54.240 --> 34:57.240
Because that was most of what was on TV.

34:57.240 --> 34:59.240
But the survey found that transgender characters

34:59.240 --> 35:01.240
were cast as killers or villains

35:01.240 --> 35:04.240
in at least 21% of the cataloged episodes and storylines.

35:04.240 --> 35:06.240
The most common profession transgender characters

35:06.240 --> 35:09.240
were depicted as having was that of sex workers,

35:09.240 --> 35:11.240
which a fifth of all characters were depicted as.

35:11.840 --> 35:13.840
An anti-trans slurs, language, and dialogue

35:13.840 --> 35:16.840
was present in at least 61% of the cataloged episodes and storylines.

35:16.840 --> 35:19.840
But starting in the 2000s, the narrative also shifted,

35:19.840 --> 35:22.840
and we started to see more positive representation

35:22.840 --> 35:25.840
of trans people in films and TV shows like

35:25.840 --> 35:28.840
The Danish Girl, Transparent, Orange is the New Black,

35:28.840 --> 35:32.840
Transamerica, Boys Don't Cry, and Dallas Buyers Club.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.840
Now there's this attempt in the mainstream

35:34.840 --> 35:36.840
to empathize with the trans experience,

35:36.840 --> 35:37.840
where before it was...

35:38.440 --> 35:51.440
And a lot of people feel like these efforts fall short,

35:51.440 --> 35:54.440
especially when a cis actor plays a trans character,

35:54.440 --> 35:56.440
which is... most of them.

35:56.440 --> 35:58.440
All of them, except Orange is the New Black.

35:58.440 --> 36:01.440
But even though that does deserve some scrutiny,

36:01.440 --> 36:04.440
the fact is that now you have a mainstream who is ready,

36:04.440 --> 36:07.440
even eager, to empathize with trans characters.

36:08.040 --> 36:11.040
And in a way, this is what's threatening to people like Joanne.

36:11.040 --> 36:14.040
Before, these characters were killers, and liars,

36:14.040 --> 36:17.040
and criminals, and sex perverts, or all of the above.

36:17.040 --> 36:21.040
But now, they're people with humanity and depth?

36:21.040 --> 36:22.040
Hmm.

36:22.040 --> 36:24.040
Which brings us to...

36:26.040 --> 36:29.040
Troubled Blood is the fifth book in J.K. Rowling's

36:29.040 --> 36:31.040
Cormoran Strike detective novel series,

36:31.040 --> 36:33.040
written under the pen name of Robert Galbraith.

36:33.040 --> 36:36.040
In this installment, it's titular hero, Cormoran,

36:36.040 --> 36:38.040
an army veteran turned private detective,

36:38.040 --> 36:40.040
and his partner, Robin,

36:40.040 --> 36:42.040
basically a younger, hot J.K. Rowling,

36:42.040 --> 36:44.040
Her face in the wing mirror was pale,

36:44.040 --> 36:46.040
her blue eyes bloodshot,

36:46.040 --> 36:48.040
and the strawberry blonde hair currently hidden

36:48.040 --> 36:51.040
under a black beanie hat needed a wash,

36:51.040 --> 36:54.040
are trying to solve a 40-year-old cold case

36:54.040 --> 36:57.040
of a missing doctor, Margaret Bambrough.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.040
You see, Bambrough, who was a gorgeous,

36:59.040 --> 37:01.040
strong-headed second-wave feminist,

37:01.040 --> 37:03.040
left her office one evening after treating

37:03.040 --> 37:05.040
a shady, masculine-looking woman

37:05.040 --> 37:07.040
who was never seen again.

37:07.040 --> 37:09.040
And everyone, including Bambrough's now-grown daughter,

37:09.040 --> 37:12.040
assumes that Margot was an unconfirmed victim

37:12.040 --> 37:14.040
of the Essex Butcher, a 70s serial killer

37:14.040 --> 37:16.040
who liked to kidnap women,

37:16.040 --> 37:17.040
chain them up in his basement,

37:17.040 --> 37:19.040
and eventually rape and murder them.

37:19.040 --> 37:22.040
And he dressed like a woman to do it.

37:22.040 --> 37:25.040
He likes dressing up in women's clothing to get off,

37:25.040 --> 37:27.040
and he uses makeup and wigs

37:27.040 --> 37:29.040
to make himself less threatening

37:29.040 --> 37:31.040
so he can gain access to women's spaces

37:31.040 --> 37:34.040
to lure them into a false sense of security

37:34.040 --> 37:37.040
for the easier murdering.

37:37.040 --> 37:39.040
Well, it's Cormoran on the case.

37:39.040 --> 37:41.040
Who killed the second-wave feminist doctor?

37:41.040 --> 37:43.040
Was it the Essex Butcher?

37:43.040 --> 37:45.040
Or could it have been the ex-boyfriend artist?

37:45.040 --> 37:47.040
Or the medical clerk who is so very fat

37:47.040 --> 37:49.040
and wears a lot of makeup?

37:49.040 --> 37:52.040
She's really fat, and she wears too much makeup.

37:52.040 --> 37:54.040
Like her sitting room, Irene Hickson presented

37:54.040 --> 37:56.040
a first impression of over-embellished,

37:56.040 --> 37:58.040
over-padded opulence.

37:58.040 --> 38:00.040
Just as blonde as she'd been at 25,

38:00.040 --> 38:03.040
she was now much heavier with an enormous bosom.

38:03.040 --> 38:05.040
She'd outlined her hooded eyes in black,

38:05.040 --> 38:09.040
penciled her sparse brows into a high, Piero-ish arc,

38:09.040 --> 38:11.040
and painted her thin lips in scarlet.

38:11.040 --> 38:14.040
Irene helped herself to another biscuit,

38:14.040 --> 38:15.040
frowning slightly.

38:15.040 --> 38:18.040
Janice passed around fresh cups of tea and coffee.

38:18.040 --> 38:21.040
Irene helped herself to another chocolate biscuit,

38:21.040 --> 38:23.040
looking as though she'd said something very clever

38:23.040 --> 38:25.040
as she reached forwards to take another biscuit,

38:25.040 --> 38:28.040
and a deafening fart ripped through the room.

38:28.040 --> 38:30.040
Or could it be the nurse

38:30.040 --> 38:32.040
who speaks like a Cockney cartoon chap?

38:32.040 --> 38:33.040
What?

38:33.040 --> 38:36.040
Aw, you know Dr. Brenner probably taught Carl a fence-off.

38:36.040 --> 38:39.040
He was an only terror when he was a kid, Carl,

38:39.040 --> 38:43.040
and he comes across as the kind of man who owns a garage.

38:43.040 --> 38:45.040
Or the questionably gay, I'm sorry,

38:45.040 --> 38:48.040
camp man who just loves karaoke?

38:48.040 --> 38:51.040
And will Cormoran and the J.K. Rowling stand-in

38:51.040 --> 38:53.040
finally, finally confess their very hetero love

38:53.040 --> 38:54.040
for each other?

38:55.040 --> 38:59.040
So, this is 900 pages of J.K.'s worst tendencies,

38:59.040 --> 39:01.040
from phonetically writing out accents,

39:01.040 --> 39:04.040
He started dropping in, telling me all his problems,

39:04.040 --> 39:07.040
and he tells me how he's mad about this married woman,

39:07.040 --> 39:09.040
falling for his mate's wife.

39:09.040 --> 39:12.040
On and on and on about how odd her life is,

39:12.040 --> 39:15.040
and there's me sitting there with a kid of my own.

39:15.040 --> 39:17.040
What about my odd life?

39:17.040 --> 39:19.040
She had an husband, didn't she?

39:19.040 --> 39:21.040
To the cool girl not being like the other girls,

39:21.040 --> 39:24.040
to a predilection for describing characters' appearances

39:24.040 --> 39:26.040
and weight so thoroughly and repeatedly

39:26.040 --> 39:29.040
that it honestly becomes kind of uncomfortable.

39:29.040 --> 39:31.040
Robin was trying to eat healthily

39:31.040 --> 39:33.040
in spite of her unsociable hours,

39:33.040 --> 39:35.040
but the almonds had long since ceased to be appetizing,

39:35.040 --> 39:38.040
and she craved nothing more than a bit of the pizza

39:38.040 --> 39:40.040
she could see an overweight couple enjoying

39:40.040 --> 39:41.040
in the restaurant window.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.040
A hugely obese...

39:42.040 --> 39:44.040
Okay, this is getting ridiculous.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.040
A hugely obese old lady came into view

39:46.040 --> 39:48.040
on the landing above them.

39:48.040 --> 39:49.040
She was clad in shorts,

39:50.040 --> 39:52.040
She was clad in shocking pink leggings

39:52.040 --> 39:54.040
and a T-shirt bearing the slogan,

39:54.040 --> 39:56.040
The more people I meet, the more I like my dog.

39:56.040 --> 40:00.040
The only occupant, a small, obese, bespectacled man,

40:00.040 --> 40:02.040
wore jeans and a black sweatshirt.

40:02.040 --> 40:04.040
He had a triple chin,

40:04.040 --> 40:06.040
and his belly kept him a foot and a half away

40:06.040 --> 40:09.040
from the white formica-topped table at which he was sitting.

40:09.040 --> 40:12.040
Seriously, Joanne, what fat person hurt you?

40:12.040 --> 40:14.040
In terms of theory, it's easy to read

40:14.040 --> 40:17.040
a lot of biological determinist second-wave feminism

40:17.040 --> 40:19.040
into troubled blood's influence.

40:19.040 --> 40:21.040
Second-wave feminists coined the idea

40:21.040 --> 40:23.040
that gender is a social construct,

40:23.040 --> 40:26.040
but sex is a biological prison

40:26.040 --> 40:28.040
from which there is no escape.

40:28.040 --> 40:30.040
Asterisk.

40:30.040 --> 40:32.040
There's a whole lot of flim-flam about gender roles

40:32.040 --> 40:34.040
and how Strike's on-again, off-again flame

40:34.040 --> 40:37.040
slash assistant is not like the other women.

40:37.040 --> 40:40.040
Lots of women do this, men do that.

40:40.040 --> 40:43.040
So much rape, and men can't be trusted

40:43.040 --> 40:46.040
to not hurt women and do the rape.

40:46.040 --> 40:48.040
Except Strike, of course, he's fine.

40:48.040 --> 40:51.040
Joanne has a lot of opinion about not just the transes,

40:51.040 --> 40:53.040
but the state of womanhood in general.

40:53.040 --> 40:56.040
Such as modern fourth-wave feminists

40:56.040 --> 41:00.040
with their slut walks and selfies and too much makeup,

41:00.040 --> 41:02.040
are frivolous little bitches who don't organize

41:02.040 --> 41:04.040
and actually work for a change

41:04.040 --> 41:07.040
like their second-wave counterparts, the good ones.

41:07.040 --> 41:10.040
Women who are uggos are just reeling for blood.

41:10.040 --> 41:12.040
Actually, no, you don't need to be a full-on uggo,

41:12.040 --> 41:16.040
you need to be, like, a six to go into a murderous rage

41:16.040 --> 41:18.040
because boys don't like you.

41:18.040 --> 41:21.040
That don't help a woman. It's better to be pretty.

41:21.040 --> 41:23.040
You'll have a better life if you're good-looking.

41:23.040 --> 41:26.040
Men always went for Irene, not me.

41:26.040 --> 41:29.040
Why wouldn't anyone marry me?

41:29.040 --> 41:32.040
What haven't I got that I'm a woman, Ev?

41:32.040 --> 41:35.040
No one suspects the six.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.040
Ancients.

41:36.040 --> 41:38.040
Repeated Janice Beattie as the police car

41:38.040 --> 41:40.040
drew to a halt outside her front door

41:40.040 --> 41:42.040
and she squared her shoulders ready to accept her fate.

41:42.040 --> 41:44.040
Ev consequences.

41:44.040 --> 41:46.040
You don't have to write the accent in, Joanne.

41:46.040 --> 41:48.040
We get that you hate poor people.

41:48.040 --> 41:52.040
Contraception is fine, but abortion is morally dubious.

41:52.040 --> 41:54.040
Imagine aborting your husband's...

41:54.040 --> 41:56.040
What the fuck?

41:56.040 --> 41:58.040
When you asked me to read these,

41:58.040 --> 42:00.040
I didn't think they would be this bad.

42:00.040 --> 42:03.040
Imagine aborting your husband's child, she thought.

42:03.040 --> 42:05.040
Could Margot really have done that

42:05.040 --> 42:07.040
when she already had that child's sister at home?

42:07.040 --> 42:09.040
Oh.

42:10.040 --> 42:12.040
To quote Vox.com's review of the book,

42:12.040 --> 42:14.040
it's the writing of someone who feels she has no choice

42:14.040 --> 42:17.040
but to bring some home truth to you, the reader,

42:17.040 --> 42:19.040
and damn the consequences.

42:19.040 --> 42:21.040
Now, you might be thinking,

42:21.040 --> 42:23.040
I heard from other YouTubers who totally,

42:23.040 --> 42:26.040
100% read the e-book.

42:26.040 --> 42:28.040
I read the book, I spent the last 12 hours

42:28.040 --> 42:30.040
reading it as an e-book.

42:30.040 --> 42:32.040
I mean the hard copy.

42:32.040 --> 42:36.040
With overnight shipping, a long, obnoxiously thick novel.

42:36.040 --> 42:38.040
I'm sorry, I mean the e-book.

42:38.040 --> 42:40.040
Reading it as an e-book.

42:40.040 --> 42:42.040
Shout out to D'Angelo for catching that.

42:42.040 --> 42:44.040
That the serial killer in question

42:44.040 --> 42:46.040
is a cis man specifically,

42:46.040 --> 42:48.040
and not a trans woman.

42:48.040 --> 42:50.040
It only ever really seems to paint him

42:50.040 --> 42:52.040
as just a pervert who looks cross-dressing

42:52.040 --> 42:54.040
but he's male.

42:54.040 --> 42:57.040
What do any of these tropes about women in general

42:57.040 --> 42:59.040
have to do with transphobia?

42:59.040 --> 43:01.040
Well, the book has this very Victorian

43:01.040 --> 43:03.040
men and women do some things differently

43:03.040 --> 43:06.040
and ne'er the twain shall meet thread.

43:06.040 --> 43:08.040
Much in the way that, well, the Victorians

43:08.040 --> 43:10.040
describe the phenomena as living in

43:10.040 --> 43:12.040
separate spheres.

43:12.040 --> 43:14.040
And to me, J.K. Rowling making the killer

43:14.040 --> 43:16.040
a self-identified man in the context

43:16.040 --> 43:18.040
of her public comments feels less

43:18.040 --> 43:20.040
like her trying to assure the reader

43:20.040 --> 43:22.040
that he is not trans, and more like

43:22.040 --> 43:24.040
an assertion that any man in a wig

43:24.040 --> 43:26.040
and lipstick has the potential to invade

43:26.040 --> 43:29.040
women's holy spaces and rape and kill them.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.040
When you throw open the doors

43:31.040 --> 43:33.040
of bathrooms and changing rooms

43:33.040 --> 43:35.040
to any man who believes or feels he's a woman

43:35.040 --> 43:37.040
and, as I've said, gender confirmation

43:37.040 --> 43:39.040
certificates may now be granted without

43:39.040 --> 43:41.040
any need for surgery or hormones

43:41.040 --> 43:43.040
then you open the door to any and all

43:43.040 --> 43:45.040
men who wish to come inside.

43:45.040 --> 43:47.040
That is the simple truth.

43:47.040 --> 43:49.040
The way she describes her worries

43:49.040 --> 43:51.040
in her essay completely lines up

43:51.040 --> 43:53.040
with her serial killer's modus operandi

43:53.040 --> 43:55.040
in Troubled Blood. And no,

43:55.040 --> 43:57.040
I don't think it's a coincidence that these came out

43:57.040 --> 43:59.040
at the same time,

43:59.040 --> 44:01.040
summer of last year.

44:01.040 --> 44:03.040
And this actually lies in contrast to Silence of the Lambs

44:03.040 --> 44:05.040
wherein Thomas Harris

44:05.040 --> 44:07.040
is even more aware than the movie

44:07.040 --> 44:09.040
of the harm a transgender serial killer

44:09.040 --> 44:11.040
could do to the trans community.

44:11.040 --> 44:13.040
There's even a whole subplot

44:13.040 --> 44:15.040
in the book where Crawford goes to the

44:15.040 --> 44:17.040
gender reassignment clinic.

44:17.040 --> 44:19.040
To even mention Buffalo Bill in the same breath

44:19.040 --> 44:21.040
with the problems we treat here is ignorant

44:21.040 --> 44:23.040
and unfair and dangerous, Mr. Crawford.

44:23.040 --> 44:25.040
It makes my hair stand on end.

44:25.040 --> 44:27.040
It's taken years, we're not through yet

44:27.040 --> 44:29.040
showing the public that transsexuals

44:29.040 --> 44:31.040
aren't crazy, they aren't perverts,

44:31.040 --> 44:33.040
they aren't queers,

44:33.040 --> 44:35.040
whatever that is. Hold on,

44:35.040 --> 44:37.040
the incidence of violence among transsexuals is a lot

44:37.040 --> 44:39.040
lower than in the general population.

44:39.040 --> 44:41.040
These are decent people with a real problem,

44:41.040 --> 44:43.040
a famously intransigent problem.

44:43.040 --> 44:45.040
They deserve help and we can give it.

44:45.040 --> 44:47.040
And Crawford's like, ah, I know, but I know

44:47.040 --> 44:49.040
that and that's why we need to know who you rejected

44:49.040 --> 44:51.040
because we know Bill is not a true

44:51.040 --> 44:53.040
tran, a true tran would never.

44:53.040 --> 44:55.040
The whole idea is the man we want

44:55.040 --> 44:57.040
is not your patient.

44:57.040 --> 44:59.040
It would be someone you refused because you

44:59.040 --> 45:01.040
recognized that he was not a transsexual.

45:01.040 --> 45:03.040
So even the author of the most

45:03.040 --> 45:05.040
popular example of the gender distressed

45:05.040 --> 45:07.040
serial killer is conscious of the fact

45:07.040 --> 45:09.040
that trans people exist, that their

45:09.040 --> 45:11.040
perception as predatory has no statistical

45:11.040 --> 45:13.040
data to back it, and the

45:13.040 --> 45:15.040
existence of a trans serial killer

45:15.040 --> 45:17.040
would really affect the entire

45:17.040 --> 45:19.040
community. But in Treble Blood,

45:19.040 --> 45:21.040
gender nonconformity isn't even

45:21.040 --> 45:23.040
mentioned outside of Dennis Creed,

45:23.040 --> 45:25.040
sex pervert, who wears women's

45:25.040 --> 45:27.040
clothes to get off.

45:27.040 --> 45:29.040
He soon progressed to stealing women's underwear

45:29.040 --> 45:31.040
from neighbors' washing lines and even

45:31.040 --> 45:33.040
from his grandmother, Aina.

45:33.040 --> 45:35.040
These he enjoying wearing

45:35.040 --> 45:37.040
in secret. What?

45:37.040 --> 45:39.040
There's never any actual discussion about being

45:39.040 --> 45:41.040
transgender either, almost as if to say

45:41.040 --> 45:43.040
that there are no trans women, that

45:43.040 --> 45:45.040
anyone not assigned female at birth who

45:45.040 --> 45:47.040
appears feminine is using it

45:47.040 --> 45:49.040
to deceive women in some way.

45:49.040 --> 45:51.040
In effect, every trans woman

45:51.040 --> 45:53.040
is a potential Buffalo Bill.

45:53.040 --> 45:55.040
I'd fuck myself.

45:55.040 --> 45:57.040
So Treble Blood is

45:57.040 --> 45:59.040
effectually resurrecting a trope that is already

45:59.040 --> 46:01.040
really dated, you know, in the way that

46:01.040 --> 46:03.040
foppish gay hairstyling

46:03.040 --> 46:05.040
besties are dated, but is still playing into

46:05.040 --> 46:07.040
a trope that has very real-world consequences,

46:07.040 --> 46:09.040
namely the idea that trans women are

46:09.040 --> 46:11.040
inherently predatory. And I don't mean to

46:11.040 --> 46:13.040
imply that trans people can't be

46:13.040 --> 46:15.040
predatory or abusive.

46:15.040 --> 46:17.040
Every group has perverts and weirdos.

46:17.040 --> 46:19.040
But being a pervert and

46:19.040 --> 46:21.040
or weirdo doesn't have anything to do with one's

46:21.040 --> 46:23.040
transness any more than it would

46:23.040 --> 46:25.040
someone's, I don't know, gayness

46:25.040 --> 46:27.040
or depression or whatever.

46:27.040 --> 46:29.040
But this is the association that runs

46:29.040 --> 46:31.040
deep in the popular consciousness.

46:31.040 --> 46:33.040
She was described in court as a predator

46:33.040 --> 46:35.040
who was a danger to women

46:35.040 --> 46:37.040
and to children. I can only surmise

46:37.040 --> 46:39.040
that the case of Karen White is

46:39.040 --> 46:41.040
one of the things that upset her so much.

46:41.040 --> 46:43.040
Karen, once known as

46:43.040 --> 46:45.040
Stephen Wood, appeared by a video link

46:45.040 --> 46:47.040
from the men's prison at Armley in Leeds

46:47.040 --> 46:49.040
wearing a wig, glasses, and a

46:49.040 --> 46:51.040
floral blouse. Karen White is a

46:51.040 --> 46:53.040
trans woman in the UK who is currently

46:53.040 --> 46:55.040
in prison for various crimes,

46:55.040 --> 46:57.040
a lot of them sex crimes, in a men's

46:57.040 --> 46:59.040
prison as far as the most recent update.

46:59.040 --> 47:01.040
According to this article in the Independent,

47:01.040 --> 47:03.040
White used her transgender

47:03.040 --> 47:05.040
persona to put herself in contact

47:05.040 --> 47:07.040
with vulnerable women. Right off the

47:07.040 --> 47:09.040
bat, the media inextricably links

47:09.040 --> 47:11.040
her sex crimes with her transness.

47:11.040 --> 47:13.040
Notably, the Independent article uses

47:13.040 --> 47:15.040
the prosecutor's interpretation of events

47:15.040 --> 47:17.040
and doesn't mention the defense's

47:17.040 --> 47:19.040
interpretation at all, saying there was

47:19.040 --> 47:21.040
evidence to suggest that her approach

47:21.040 --> 47:23.040
to transitioning has been less than

47:23.040 --> 47:25.040
committed, and in fact was designed

47:25.040 --> 47:27.040
to allow White access to vulnerable

47:27.040 --> 47:29.040
victims, dressed up in drag

47:29.040 --> 47:31.040
to gain access to women's spaces

47:31.040 --> 47:33.040
and lure them into a false sense of security.

47:33.040 --> 47:35.040
Hmm. Man, at least

47:35.040 --> 47:37.040
when Jack Lemmon did it, it was fun.

47:37.040 --> 47:39.040
It's not my fault I

47:39.040 --> 47:41.040
didn't invite them.

47:41.040 --> 47:43.040
So this article isn't just a list of White's

47:43.040 --> 47:45.040
crimes, which are allegedly very real,

47:45.040 --> 47:47.040
but a pointed effort to paint

47:47.040 --> 47:49.040
White not as a criminal who happens to be

47:49.040 --> 47:51.040
trans, but spotlighting her

47:51.040 --> 47:53.040
transness somehow as relevant to

47:53.040 --> 47:55.040
her crimes. Let's take a look at

47:55.040 --> 47:57.040
one of the favorite articles TERFs like to

47:57.040 --> 47:59.040
cite as evidence for the inherent dangers

47:59.040 --> 48:01.040
trans women present.

48:01.040 --> 48:03.040
Transgender inmates have carried out

48:03.040 --> 48:05.040
seven sex attacks...

48:05.040 --> 48:07.040
Sex attack.

48:07.040 --> 48:09.040
I want a man who wants to

48:09.040 --> 48:11.040
make a sex attack on me.

48:11.040 --> 48:13.040
Transgender inmates have carried out seven sex attacks

48:13.040 --> 48:15.040
on women in jail, despite the risks

48:15.040 --> 48:17.040
male-born trans convicts are still

48:17.040 --> 48:19.040
allowed to move into women's prisons.

48:19.040 --> 48:21.040
So conservative politician Richard Cain made

48:21.040 --> 48:23.040
this statement, which then went viral,

48:23.040 --> 48:25.040
and the Ministry of Justice has said,

48:25.040 --> 48:27.040
since 2010, out of the 124

48:27.040 --> 48:29.040
sexual assaults that occurred in the

48:29.040 --> 48:31.040
female estate, a total of seven of those

48:31.040 --> 48:33.040
were sexual assaults against females in

48:33.040 --> 48:35.040
custody, perpetrated by

48:35.040 --> 48:37.040
transgender individuals.

48:37.040 --> 48:39.040
Snoop, I know you're not with

48:39.040 --> 48:41.040
the Crips anymore, but please don't kill me for that

48:41.040 --> 48:43.040
trans flag thing.

48:43.040 --> 48:45.040
Basically, this article talks about transgender

48:45.040 --> 48:47.040
INDIVIDUALS

48:47.040 --> 48:49.040
assaulting women in women's prisons, which

48:49.040 --> 48:51.040
let's assume that that's

48:51.040 --> 48:53.040
true. This word

48:53.040 --> 48:55.040
INDIVIDUALS is doing a lot

48:55.040 --> 48:57.040
of heavy lifting, because it's assuming that

48:57.040 --> 48:59.040
trans women are doing the predation,

48:59.040 --> 49:01.040
but neglects the fact that most

49:01.040 --> 49:03.040
trans INDIVIDUALS

49:03.040 --> 49:05.040
in women's prisons are

49:05.040 --> 49:07.040
assigned female at birth trans men.

49:07.040 --> 49:09.040
According to the data, we do have

49:09.040 --> 49:11.040
trans men outnumber trans women

49:11.040 --> 49:13.040
in women's prisons in the UK almost

49:13.040 --> 49:15.040
2 to 1. So assuming that

49:15.040 --> 49:17.040
sex attack number is correct, it doesn't

49:17.040 --> 49:19.040
say how many of these seven are

49:19.040 --> 49:21.040
trans men, trans women,

49:21.040 --> 49:23.040
non-binary, or whatever.

49:23.040 --> 49:25.040
So while the implication here is that men

49:25.040 --> 49:27.040
in drag are sneaking into women's

49:27.040 --> 49:29.040
prisons to assault cis women,

49:29.040 --> 49:31.040
they aren't telling us who is doing the

49:31.040 --> 49:33.040
assaulting. So if by extreme

49:33.040 --> 49:35.040
technicality the Daily Mail is

49:35.040 --> 49:37.040
not representing a falsehood in this article,

49:37.040 --> 49:39.040
and for the sake of argument,

49:39.040 --> 49:41.040
let's just assume that they're not,

49:41.040 --> 49:43.040
even though I have my doubts,

49:43.040 --> 49:45.040
they are relying on the reader's

49:45.040 --> 49:47.040
biases to connect the dots

49:47.040 --> 49:49.040
that trans women are predatory and

49:49.040 --> 49:51.040
are a danger to cis women. Also

49:51.040 --> 49:53.040
all of the data this article draws on is a

49:53.040 --> 49:55.040
mess. Found out the hard way that the UK

49:55.040 --> 49:57.040
apparently does not keep nearly as good data

49:57.040 --> 49:59.040
on sexual assault as prisons in the US

49:59.040 --> 50:01.040
do, and just the way that

50:01.040 --> 50:03.040
things are phrased in this report

50:03.040 --> 50:05.040
is super confusing to read

50:05.040 --> 50:07.040
and therefore really easy for

50:07.040 --> 50:09.040
bad faith actors to misrepresent.

50:09.040 --> 50:11.040
For instance, there are the people who take bits of data

50:11.040 --> 50:13.040
and clearly willfully misrepresent

50:13.040 --> 50:15.040
them, like saying

50:15.040 --> 50:17.040
139 transgender inmates are currently

50:17.040 --> 50:19.040
housed in women's prisons.

50:19.040 --> 50:21.040
Which is just flat out wrong. It's a lie.

50:21.040 --> 50:23.040
That was the total number of

50:23.040 --> 50:25.040
transgender prisoners in 2018

50:25.040 --> 50:27.040
in prisons for either sex.

50:27.040 --> 50:29.040
But that comes with an even weirder caveat

50:29.040 --> 50:31.040
because this 139 transgender

50:31.040 --> 50:33.040
inmates number does not

50:33.040 --> 50:35.040
include people who have legally transitioned

50:35.040 --> 50:37.040
and have the gender recognition

50:37.040 --> 50:39.040
certificate that Joanne

50:39.040 --> 50:41.040
is so f***ing mad about.

50:41.040 --> 50:43.040
So people who are transgender

50:43.040 --> 50:45.040
and have fully legally transitioned

50:45.040 --> 50:47.040
and ended up in prison

50:47.040 --> 50:49.040
somehow, aren't even accounted for

50:49.040 --> 50:51.040
in this 139 number.

50:51.040 --> 50:53.040
So who are these

50:53.040 --> 50:55.040
people? Eh?

50:55.040 --> 50:57.040
How are they counting them? Eh?

50:57.040 --> 50:59.040
So it's absurd for them to claim

50:59.040 --> 51:01.040
that they can draw accurate conclusions about

51:01.040 --> 51:03.040
the dangers of the predatory trans

51:03.040 --> 51:05.040
because that data does not

51:05.040 --> 51:07.040
exist. And on the claim that transgender

51:07.040 --> 51:09.040
people are disproportionately imprisoned

51:09.040 --> 51:11.040
for committing sex offenses, another

51:11.040 --> 51:13.040
TERF favorite in the UK,

51:13.040 --> 51:15.040
according to the UK non-profit

51:15.040 --> 51:17.040
Bent Bars,

51:33.040 --> 51:37.040
And like with so many things,

51:37.040 --> 51:39.040
that statistic is completely made up.

51:39.040 --> 51:41.040
But it sounds plausible,

51:41.040 --> 51:43.040
doesn't it? Because that presumption

51:43.040 --> 51:45.040
of trans women as predatory

51:45.040 --> 51:47.040
is already there.

51:47.040 --> 51:49.040
Inside your mind.

51:49.040 --> 51:51.040
Like the fanci-

51:51.040 --> 51:53.040
I'm sorry. So you have this combination of people

51:53.040 --> 51:55.040
with specifically anti-trans agendas

51:55.040 --> 51:57.040
spreading misinformation based on a misrepresentation

51:57.040 --> 51:59.040
of data that is already insufficient,

51:59.040 --> 52:01.040
melding with an extremely

52:01.040 --> 52:03.040
common trope going all the way back to

52:03.040 --> 52:05.040
Ed Gein that there's just something inherently

52:05.040 --> 52:07.040
predatory about trans women.

52:07.040 --> 52:09.040
So while Troubled Blood definitely

52:09.040 --> 52:11.040
has an early 90's

52:11.040 --> 52:13.040
dated-ness to it, as Natalie

52:13.040 --> 52:15.040
put it, my enemy

52:15.040 --> 52:17.040
eternal, whore, you'd think that a

52:17.040 --> 52:19.040
seasoned writer like Joanne would at least put a

52:19.040 --> 52:21.040
new twist on the crossdressing murderer

52:21.040 --> 52:23.040
trope. But she doesn't.

52:23.040 --> 52:25.040
It's just dressed to kill. Only

52:25.040 --> 52:27.040
in this book, the crossdresser is a red herring.

52:27.040 --> 52:29.040
Spoilers.

52:29.040 --> 52:31.040
Spoilers.

52:31.040 --> 52:33.040
We have no evidence that trans women

52:33.040 --> 52:35.040
are any more danger to cis women

52:35.040 --> 52:37.040
than other cis women, in prison or

52:37.040 --> 52:39.040
otherwise. And non-prison-related

52:39.040 --> 52:41.040
studies do bear this out.

52:41.040 --> 52:43.040
But we do have mountains of evidence for who is

52:43.040 --> 52:45.040
really in danger in prison.

52:45.040 --> 52:47.040
This being, of course, trans women.

52:47.040 --> 52:49.040
One statewide study in California

52:49.040 --> 52:51.040
found that when transgender women were automatically

52:51.040 --> 52:53.040
housed with men, they were 13

52:53.040 --> 52:55.040
times more likely to be sexually assaulted

52:55.040 --> 52:57.040
than male prisoners in the same facility.

52:57.040 --> 52:59.040
And a report from the U.S. Bureau of

52:59.040 --> 53:01.040
Justice Statistics said that from 2011

53:01.040 --> 53:03.040
to 2012, 40% of

53:03.040 --> 53:05.040
transgender prisoners reported being the victim of

53:05.040 --> 53:07.040
a sexual assault within the previous 12 months,

53:07.040 --> 53:09.040
10 times the percentage of non-transgender

53:09.040 --> 53:11.040
inmates. Regarding the case

53:11.040 --> 53:13.040
of Karen White, a U.K. prison spokesperson

53:13.040 --> 53:15.040
said,

53:21.040 --> 53:23.040
But surely

53:23.040 --> 53:25.040
your trans prisoners fall under the

53:25.040 --> 53:27.040
umbrella of all prisoners.

53:27.040 --> 53:29.040
So, what about them?

53:29.040 --> 53:31.040
The message is clear.

53:31.040 --> 53:33.040
The priority of cis women's feelings

53:33.040 --> 53:35.040
of being in danger, rather than the reality

53:35.040 --> 53:37.040
of trans people being more at risk.

53:37.040 --> 53:39.040
And where do these feelings come from but the cultural

53:39.040 --> 53:41.040
boogeyman of the predatory tran?

53:41.040 --> 53:43.040
So, there's already

53:43.040 --> 53:45.040
been a lot of discussion by

53:45.040 --> 53:47.040
people who are not me, and

53:47.040 --> 53:49.040
who actually care about this

53:49.040 --> 53:51.040
sort of thing, about the weird gender subtext

53:51.040 --> 53:53.040
in the Harry Potter series.

53:53.040 --> 53:55.040
Whether it's Cho Chang, or

53:55.040 --> 53:57.040
Voldemort's mother, or

53:57.040 --> 53:59.040
basically any woman in the Fantastic

53:59.040 --> 54:01.040
Beasts series. But, you know,

54:01.040 --> 54:03.040
it was easy to hand-wave away with claims of

54:03.040 --> 54:05.040
like, you know, well, J.K., but she donated

54:05.040 --> 54:07.040
to ex-feminist charity, or, you know,

54:07.040 --> 54:09.040
they're children's stories, it's not that deep, bro.

54:09.040 --> 54:11.040
But, it's clear

54:11.040 --> 54:13.040
now that there's always been this sort of current

54:13.040 --> 54:15.040
in her work of acceptable

54:15.040 --> 54:17.040
womanhood. In terms of actual

54:17.040 --> 54:19.040
personhood, no one should care anymore

54:19.040 --> 54:21.040
about what J.K. Rowling thinks

54:21.040 --> 54:23.040
than, like, you know, Sharon from Dayton, Ohio.

54:23.040 --> 54:25.040
Who cares what she thinks?

54:25.040 --> 54:27.040
The thing we should care about is her

54:27.040 --> 54:29.040
influence, and that's why we even have to have this

54:29.040 --> 54:31.040
stupid f***ing discussion

54:31.040 --> 54:33.040
in the first place. The International Lesbian

54:33.040 --> 54:35.040
Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Intersex

54:35.040 --> 54:37.040
Association's 2021 Review of LGBT

54:37.040 --> 54:39.040
Human Rights in Europe specifically

54:39.040 --> 54:41.040
said this of Rowling's influence in the UK.

54:41.040 --> 54:43.040
Anti-trans rhetoric continued

54:43.040 --> 54:45.040
to cause serious damage in the UK

54:45.040 --> 54:47.040
again this year. A prime example is

54:47.040 --> 54:49.040
repeated transphobic attacks by author J.K.

54:49.040 --> 54:51.040
Rowling on Twitter and in her writing.

54:51.040 --> 54:53.040
The report warns that in some parts of the

54:53.040 --> 54:55.040
UK, hate crimes had been steadily

54:55.040 --> 54:57.040
increasing, in part due to an increase

54:57.040 --> 54:59.040
in reporting, but also influenced by

54:59.040 --> 55:01.040
increasing hostility in UK-wide media

55:01.040 --> 55:03.040
towards trans identities and communities.

55:03.040 --> 55:05.040
Mainstream media has only just begun

55:05.040 --> 55:07.040
to center trans characters, creative heads,

55:07.040 --> 55:09.040
and actors. You have shows like Pose,

55:09.040 --> 55:11.040
produced, written, and directed in part by Janet Mock,

55:11.040 --> 55:13.040
a trans woman of color, and also starring

55:13.040 --> 55:15.040
multiple trans actors. God may have

55:15.040 --> 55:17.040
blessed you with Barbies, a backyard with a

55:17.040 --> 55:19.040
pony in it, a boyfriend named Jake, and an unwanted

55:19.040 --> 55:21.040
pregnancy that your father paid to terminate so

55:21.040 --> 55:23.040
you could go to college and major in being a basic

55:23.040 --> 55:25.040
bitch. Or Sensate, produced, written,

55:25.040 --> 55:27.040
and directed by the Wachowski sisters and starring

55:27.040 --> 55:29.040
Jamie Clayton. Hell, there's even Difficult People's

55:29.040 --> 55:31.040
Lola, played by trans comedian and actress

55:31.040 --> 55:33.040
Shakina Nafak. Third airplane

55:33.040 --> 55:35.040
goes right into the Pentagon?

55:35.040 --> 55:37.040
I don't think so, bitches. That was

55:37.040 --> 55:39.040
a missile. And Tower 7 was brought down

55:39.040 --> 55:41.040
by a bomb. Whose transness takes a backseat

55:41.040 --> 55:43.040
to the fact that she's Billy Eichner's work

55:43.040 --> 55:45.040
enemy and also a massive 9-11 truther.

55:45.040 --> 55:47.040
May your love shine as bright as the

55:47.040 --> 55:49.040
sun did on that fair September morn

55:49.040 --> 55:51.040
when George W. Bush pulled off the greatest scam

55:51.040 --> 55:53.040
in American history since the moon landing.

55:53.040 --> 55:55.040
On the character, Nafak had this to say,

55:55.040 --> 55:57.040
In the quest for transgender visibility, we've

55:57.040 --> 55:59.040
only been introduced to sympathetic roles that rely

55:59.040 --> 56:01.040
on victimization or stereotypes in order

56:01.040 --> 56:03.040
to elicit empathy from our audiences.

56:03.040 --> 56:05.040
You're gonna love Lola because she's strong and opinionated

56:05.040 --> 56:07.040
and crass, not because she's getting

56:07.040 --> 56:09.040
bashed, locked up, or wrestling with coming

56:09.040 --> 56:11.040
out. You do seem happier than usual.

56:11.040 --> 56:13.040
Granted, that bar is set about as low as the burning

56:13.040 --> 56:15.040
temperature of jet fuel. So how can it

56:15.040 --> 56:17.040
melt steel beams? Exactly.

56:17.040 --> 56:19.040
So while there's still the Ready Player Two's or

56:19.040 --> 56:21.040
cyberpunk 2077's of the world

56:21.040 --> 56:23.040
that include trans characters with,

56:23.040 --> 56:25.040
and I say this very generously, good

56:25.040 --> 56:27.040
intentions of inclusion,

56:27.040 --> 56:29.040
while still falling on the spectrum of reducing trans

56:29.040 --> 56:31.040
people to sexual commodities, progress

56:31.040 --> 56:33.040
is being made and even embraced, which

56:33.040 --> 56:35.040
is why it's disappointing and almost

56:35.040 --> 56:37.040
surprising that something so archaic

56:37.040 --> 56:39.040
as troubled blood is even a thing.

56:39.040 --> 56:41.040
In terms of theory and media crit,

56:41.040 --> 56:43.040
I have done what I can do.

56:43.040 --> 56:45.040
But in terms of YouTube drama,

56:45.040 --> 56:47.040
well, only you can help with that.

56:47.040 --> 56:49.040
So I'm not kidding, this is real,

56:49.040 --> 56:51.040
all of the profits from our feud merch

56:51.040 --> 56:53.040
will go to...

56:53.040 --> 56:55.040
Sir not appearing in this film.

56:55.040 --> 56:57.040
It will be a good one,

56:57.040 --> 56:59.040
I promise. Blame Addison

56:59.040 --> 57:01.040
Cain for me not being.

57:01.040 --> 57:03.040
And remember, trans women are not

57:03.040 --> 57:05.040
predatory, except for that whore

57:05.040 --> 57:07.040
Natalie.

57:07.040 --> 57:09.040
Leave me a message about how Hitchcock is

57:09.040 --> 57:11.040
a problematic too, I haven't heard that one.

57:11.040 --> 57:13.040
Okay, I guess that's it, I'm done.

57:39.040 --> 57:41.040
I finally have a dozen of my donuts

57:41.040 --> 57:43.040
Delicious donuts

57:43.040 --> 57:45.040
They're downright dunky

57:45.040 --> 57:47.040
And they are definitely

57:47.040 --> 57:49.040
done by only me

57:49.040 --> 57:51.040
Yes they are deep fried

57:51.040 --> 57:53.040
dipped and dabbed by Mr. D

58:03.040 --> 58:05.040
And when I deliver

58:05.040 --> 58:07.040
my delicious donuts

58:07.040 --> 58:09.040
I do

58:09.040 --> 58:11.040
the donut dance

58:13.040 --> 58:15.040
Don't you want to do

58:15.040 --> 58:17.040
the dance too?

58:21.040 --> 58:23.040
What a delicious

58:23.040 --> 58:25.040
donut dance

58:37.040 --> 58:39.040
If you like donuts

58:39.040 --> 58:41.040
Delicious donuts

58:41.040 --> 58:43.040
Don't dilly-dally, have a dozen

58:43.040 --> 58:45.040
of my donuts

58:45.040 --> 58:47.040
Delicious donuts

58:49.040 --> 58:51.040
Hold on, I paused in the middle to record that clip

58:51.040 --> 58:53.040
What does he say next?

58:53.040 --> 58:55.040
I'm just gonna say, I haven't read this book, I don't even know if it's

58:55.040 --> 58:57.040
I'm just gonna say, I haven't read this book, I don't even know if it's
