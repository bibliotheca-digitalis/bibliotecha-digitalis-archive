1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
The trope seems to originate in 1960

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,520
with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,480
That's just my guess, though.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,680
I haven't researched this.

5
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,480
Who do you think I am, Lindsay Ellis?

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,160
Well, it would appear that I have been summoned.

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,440
So since this topic is never gonna go away, apparently,

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,240
ContraPoints and I were, you know,

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,080
planning on doing, like, a collab of sorts.

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:23,920
But the thing is, like,

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,120
both of us are really bad at scheduling

12
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,060
and we couldn't, like, really figure anything out.

13
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,180
And then someone sniped, like, half my talking points.

14
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,020
I don't know.

15
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:32,860
I figure this topic is, like,

16
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,300
half of all we ever talk about,

17
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,100
so we may as well monetize it, you know?

18
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,100
So, do you wanna collab on the Psycho part?

19
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,180
Or do you, why don't I do the Psycho part?

20
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,700
I'm gonna do the Psycho part.

21
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,540
It's happening.

22
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,360
Whore.

23
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,020
So, you know what that means.

24
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,060
That's right.

25
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,340
This is a feud.

26
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,580
A YouTuber feud.

27
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,900
That's right, we're feuding.

28
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,140
Leave us a comment for who you think should win.

29
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,820
And, you know, this isn't, like, a regular feud.

30
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,660
This is, like, a cool feud.

31
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,940
This feud has merchandise.

32
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,780
No, really.

33
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,640
You can go to my store and buy one of these two pins

34
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,980
based on who you think should win the feud.

35
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,140
Whoever sells the most pins wins.

36
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,660
And 100% of the profits for these pins will go to

37
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,820
The aptly named Sir Not Appearing in this film.

38
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,820
Yeah, so the last time I named which charity

39
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,380
I was going to give merchandise profits to,

40
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,620
they got threatened with legal action.

41
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,820
And because the EFF worked in collusion with Lindsay Ellis

42
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,720
to create the monetized video,

43
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,000
the EFF is also culpable for the copyright infringement

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,120
and the defamation.

45
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:36,120
So yeah, it's unnamed charity benefiting trans youths.

46
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,480
You know, a variety of them.

47
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,600
A melange.

48
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,440
A rainbow, you might say.

49
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,100
This is why we can't have nice things.

50
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,240
So I did a Death of the Author addendum last year

51
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,240
after a bunch of people asked me questions

52
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,160
about the applicability of Death of the Author

53
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,440
to the works of one Joanne Rowling

54
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,520
in light of her new philosophy.

55
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,320
When you throw open the doors of bathrooms

56
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,480
and changing rooms to any man who believes

57
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,120
or feels he's a woman,

58
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,560
and as I've said, gender confirmation certificates

59
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,920
may not be granted without any need for surgery or hormones,

60
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,160
then you open the door to any and all men

61
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,720
who wish to come inside.

62
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,680
Which led to all sorts of fun feedback

63
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,480
from viewers of other fine YouTube channels,

64
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,480
such as reader of books, Vanessa LeBlanc.

65
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,800
The opinions you're going to hear today

66
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,880
are from someone who is not just, you know,

67
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,040
on Twitter, hearing what other people have to say

68
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,160
and hopping on a bandwagon.

69
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
This is because I read the book.

70
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,400
She totally read it.

71
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,560
At the very most, the concept of being a transvestite

72
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,560
makes a very quick, brief, fleeting appearance in the book,

73
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,560
and it's extremely unimportant.

74
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,440
It comes in the form of one line in the book,

75
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,840
one page in a 900-page book.

76
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,960
And master of cell phones, Gary of Swendon.

77
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,200
Society is built around the interactions

78
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,680
between men and women, and so it's not surprising

79
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,800
that they would have quite a formalized

80
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,920
and baked-in set of rules.

81
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,080
Five minutes later.

82
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,120
Why would we need to do anything in its purest, pure form?

83
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,800
What has Lindsay Ellis ever done in her entire life

84
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,720
that was of the purest, pure form?

85
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,120
The answer is nothing.

86
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,180
It's not gonna be exactly as it should be conceptually,

87
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,980
but you just have to deal with that.

88
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,480
I'm just gonna say, I haven't read this book.

89
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,280
I don't even know if it's out yet, actually.

90
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,280
Although my personal favorite came from one of Gary's fans

91
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,760
who emailed me to scold me because they thought

92
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,240
that death of the author meant I was literally advocating

93
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,900
for the murder of J.K. Rowling.

94
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,080
The thinkery.

95
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,480
So much of the chicanery stemmed from a misrepresentation

96
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,840
of J.K.'s argument, which is that she's just stating

97
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,560
biology, you guys.

98
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,200
She's not denying people's humanity.

99
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,160
I don't hate trans people, but what is wrong

100
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,440
with the trans activists that they think biology isn't real?

101
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,560
J.K.R. is being canceled for stating a fact?

102
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,080
Well, that's just canceled culture run amok.

103
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,040
But while a huge component against discrimination

104
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,640
against trans people is biological in nature,

105
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,600
namely the denial of healthcare and medical gatekeeping,

106
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,640
it is, in this context, completely besides the point.

107
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,440
No one is saying biology isn't real.

108
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,440
That's why the healthcare thing is such a big deal.

109
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,960
Because of the biology.

110
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,800
So for some people to reframe this discussion

111
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,160
like trans activists are denying biology

112
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,600
and that they are simply in their thinker, thinkery ways

113
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,840
arguing against this obvious falsehood,

114
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,720
well, that is how Sharon and Mike from Dayton, Ohio

115
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,560
will first understand the argument.

116
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,140
Joanne and Vanessa and Gary arguing against a point

117
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,560
that no one is making, but since that's the point

118
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,440
that Sharon and Mike are seeing argued against,

119
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,400
that is what Sharon and Mike think

120
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,840
that the trans activists actually believe.

121
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,760
So as with a lot of reactionary movements,

122
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,560
much of the anti-trans ideology

123
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,000
is rooted in an appeal to common sense.

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,600
And there really is something to this idea

125
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,080
of using common sense as a rhetorical device.

126
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,760
If a new or challenging idea is presented,

127
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,520
all you need to do is look at the camera

128
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,040
and be like, common sense, am I right?

129
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,480
And it's effective because by appealing to common sense,

130
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,160
the viewer slash reader doesn't need

131
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,040
to challenge preconceptions.

132
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,760
Like this cholera outbreak,

133
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,000
common sense says it's the miasma.

134
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,560
Germ theory, you can't even see those.

135
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,960
Which is why all of these debates are so frustrating

136
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,580
because to the Ben Shapiros

137
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,400
and the Joanne Rowlings of the world,

138
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,120
trans people existing doesn't have anything to do with them

139
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,840
or their lives, but there is something inherently

140
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,560
threatening about their acceptance by society.

141
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,160
So they have to make up scenarios

142
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,080
where it does have things to do with them.

143
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,020
And they try to sell these scenarios

144
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,440
with a very shallow brand of common sense.

145
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,460
What if penis in bathroom?

146
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,080
What if I'm dating one and I get tricked?

147
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,840
And of course, that old reactionary classic,

148
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,460
won't someone think of the children?

149
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,360
So won't someone think of the children

150
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,920
is a staple of every reactionary movement.

151
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,800
If society progresses one inch,

152
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,520
reactionaries are going to use the children as a shield.

153
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,120
The ancients among us might remember,

154
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,420
it wasn't that long ago that that was the argument

155
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,840
used against gay marriage.

156
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,920
How am I supposed to explain to my child?

157
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,600
Hang your shitty child for all I care.

158
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,440
McKaylee will just have to figure out

159
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,000
how to navigate a world where the gays

160
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,720
are allowed to kiss in public on her own.

161
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,640
Yes, if you steal my shit, I'm allowed to steal your shit.

162
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,960
That's how it works, whore.

163
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,480
So what people hear when they see these

164
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,640
very intellectually honest thinkers

165
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,320
decrying the cancellation of JK Rowling

166
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,400
is that all Joanne said was that biological sex is real.

167
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,800
And that trans people are being mean to her on the internet

168
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,200
because she was just stating a simple scientific fact, guys.

169
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,360
And all of this stems from an essay Joanne wrote

170
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,000
back in June called Turf Wars,

171
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,680
in which she explained why she was so deeply concerned

172
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,000
about the encroaching menace of trans rights.

173
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,600
Her essay was even awarded

174
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,320
the 2020 Russell Prize by the BBC.

175
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,360
So now we know you can win awards for essays

176
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,000
that have sections ranging from

177
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,160
wild misrepresentations of the truth to flat out lies.

178
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,620
And so for those of you who haven't read it,

179
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,380
which I'm guessing is most of you,

180
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,660
here is a quick rundown of the point she makes in her essay.

181
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,620
I was canceled for liking some tweets

182
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,940
and then standing up for this woman

183
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,800
whose place of employment declined to renew her contract

184
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,100
after her contract expired

185
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,500
because she was a dick to a trans coworker.

186
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,660
For people who don't know,

187
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,580
last December I tweeted my support for Maya Forstater,

188
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,540
a tax specialist who'd lost her job

189
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,620
for what were deemed transphobic tweets.

190
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,300
She took her case to an employment tribunal

191
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,100
asking the judge to rule on whether a philosophical belief

192
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,820
that sex is determined by biology is protected in law.

193
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,220
Judge Taylor ruled that it wasn't.

194
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,740
Here is incidentally what the judge actually said.

195
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,160
I conclude from the totality of the evidence

196
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,700
that Forstater is absolutist in her view of sex

197
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,860
and it is a core component of her belief

198
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,460
that she will refer to a person

199
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,420
by the sex she considers appropriate

200
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,540
even if it violates their dignity

201
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,840
and or creates an intimidating, hostile, degrading,

202
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,280
humiliating, or offensive environment.

203
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,160
The approach is not worthy of respect

204
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,240
in a democratic society.

205
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,400
The erosion of gender norms

206
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,680
negatively affects charities I run

207
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,140
because I might accidentally give money

208
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,340
to a trans domestic abuse survivor

209
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,560
or something about multiple sclerosis.

210
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,600
Think of the children.

211
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,120
I'm an advocate for free speech.

212
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,200
Too many girls who are being brainwashed by the gay agenda,

213
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,880
I mean, radical trans activists,

214
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,160
and they don't actually know what they want

215
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,000
and girls are transitioning

216
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,560
because of internalized misogyny.

217
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,120
Think of the children.

218
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,260
If I was a child today,

219
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,500
I might have fallen in with the wrong crowd

220
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,120
and gotten transed.

221
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,400
Like it's the Crips.

222
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,720
Snoop Dogg over here like.

223
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,080
♪ I keep a black flag hanging on my backside ♪

224
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,880
♪ But only on the left side, yeah that's the side. ♪

225
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,720
Long beach in the house.

226
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,700
Yes, I know Snoop is a problematic.

227
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,080
Leave me a comment about how Snoop is a...

228
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,840
Our once robust gatekeeping systems are being eroded

229
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,480
and now anyone can say I'm a woman

230
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,120
and be recognized as such in the eyes of the law

231
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,680
and I feel threatened by that.

232
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,960
The world is misogynist and porn is bad.

233
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,920
Trans occlusive language is misogynist, actually.

234
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,080
I was an abuse survivor,

235
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,460
so the idea of male-bodied persons

236
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,280
in the bathroom triggers me.

237
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
On Saturday morning,

238
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,560
I read that the Scottish government is proceeding

239
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,760
with its controversial gender recognition plans,

240
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,200
which will in effect mean that all a man needs

241
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,840
to become a woman is to say he's one.

242
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,480
To use a very contemporary word,

243
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,680
I was triggered.

244
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,320
I couldn't shut out those memories

245
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,720
and I was finding it hard to contain my anger

246
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,320
and disappointment about the way I believe my government

247
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,120
is playing fast and loose with women's and girls' safety.

248
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,220
This visceral fear reaction was in response

249
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,400
to the Scottish government making transition less gatekeepy.

250
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,040
Men in women's spaces is putting natal women

251
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,520
and girls in danger.

252
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,760
Gender criticals are nice, actually,

253
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,320
and they don't hate the transes.

254
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,300
And finally, think of the children.

255
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,160
Okay.

256
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,640
It would be so much easier to tweet the approved hashtags

257
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,880
because of course trans rights are human rights

258
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,080
and of course trans lives matter.

259
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,480
Scoop up the woke cookies

260
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,720
and bask in a virtue signaling afterglow.

261
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,200
There's joy, relief, and safety in conformity.

262
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,760
Come on, Snoop, work with us.

263
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,640
So I need to make it clear

264
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,040
that I do not care about Joanne Rowling.

265
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,880
I do not care about saving her soul.

266
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,720
I don't care about canceling her.

267
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,840
What I do care about is her influence,

268
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,120
which is why we have to discuss this at all.

269
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,760
But in the context of this video,

270
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,680
I am more interested in why these beliefs

271
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,520
are even in her head in the first place.

272
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,480
Like, where did her belief that trans women

273
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,280
are gonna do a bunch of bathroom assaults even come from?

274
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,400
Because it wasn't reality.

275
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,000
Was it then the movies?

276
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,720
Well, that's a complicated question,

277
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,520
but the answer is yes.

278
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,880
The mother half took over completely.

279
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,480
He was never all Norman,

280
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,960
but he was often only mother.

281
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,640
Why was he dressed like that?

282
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,080
He's a transvestite.

283
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,760
I did not know that the Bates Motel was in California.

284
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,200
Just like us, Snoop.

285
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,800
So before we jump into the roots of transphobic tropes,

286
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,000
we must first acknowledge

287
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,960
that the understanding of sex and gender

288
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,800
is always kind of in flux.

289
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,240
It is a theory that is always evolving.

290
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,640
That said, some very good faith actors

291
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,480
tend to get caught up

292
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,360
in this very hyper-literal interpretation of media,

293
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,880
i.e. a depiction cannot be transphobic

294
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,920
if the depiction in question

295
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,680
is not of a literal trans person.

296
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,440
Now, people are calling the book transphobic

297
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,280
because of this,

298
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,240
because it has a character who is a cis man

299
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,960
who dresses as a woman when killing his victim.

300
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,840
And no, honey, that's not how it works.

301
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,760
While the idea of cross-dressing men

302
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,360
may not be an accurate reflection of trans identity

303
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,800
as we conceive it today,

304
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,520
it certainly influenced the mainstream understanding

305
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,840
of what trans identity even is.

306
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,320
So a lot of the characters that we are going to talk about

307
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,280
are not trans as we'd consider them.

308
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,040
When a straight man puts on a dress

309
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,440
and gets his sexual kicks, he is a transvestite.

310
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,440
When a man is a woman trapped in a man's body

311
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,680
and has the little operation, he is a transsexual.

312
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,520
I know that.

313
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,320
And before we go any further, big old content warning,

314
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,720
because it is one thing to kind of, you know,

315
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,160
know about the tropes,

316
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,960
but to like see them in rapid fire succession,

317
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,560
you know, it's a lot.

318
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,840
Like, I don't even have any skin in the game

319
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,200
and it's still a lot.

320
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,320
So here's your warning.

321
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,240
In Western culture,

322
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,120
cross-dressing has often been used

323
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,840
as a shorthand for deception,

324
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,320
but not always maliciously so.

325
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,000
In fact, for most of history,

326
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,880
cross-dressing men are portrayed as neutral

327
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,920
or more often comical.

328
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,040
In the Iliad, Achilles tries to get out of war

329
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,160
by dressing as a woman,

330
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,360
but Odysseus figures him out

331
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,000
when he gives Achilles a gift of perfume

332
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,120
and Achilles doesn't lose his shit over the gift,

333
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,000
you know, like women do.

334
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,240
In Shakespeare's Twelfth Night,

335
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,880
protagonist Viola takes up service for Duke Orsinio

336
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,080
disguised as a young man named Cesario.

337
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,560
After some comic misunderstanding

338
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,920
and then lots of cross-dressing,

339
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,240
Viola's identity is revealed and it's fine,

340
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,400
compulsory heterosexuality all around.

341
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,600
The benign cross-dresser motif remained popular

342
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,920
well into the 20th century

343
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,240
with entries like Bosom Buddies, Tootsie,

344
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,200
Some Like It Hot, and White Chicks.

345
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,200
♪ And I need you, and I miss you ♪

346
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,840
Billy Wilder's classic comedy Some Like It Hot

347
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,200
in particular depicts a fun, harmless version

348
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,000
of the very scenario Joanne seems so worried about.

349
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,480
I feel naked, I feel like everybody's staring at me.

350
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,080
With those legs, are you crazy?

351
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,920
Now come on.

352
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,320
Men dressing up as women to gain access to women's spaces.

353
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,760
Now in this film, it's because the two men are in hiding.

354
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,400
Two musicians witness a mob hit,

355
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,880
so they dress up as women and join an all-female band

356
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,280
to disguise themselves.

357
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,360
Both of them fall for the band's lead vocalist,

358
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,600
Sugar Cane, played by Marilyn Monroe.

359
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,800
Well, see you around, girl.

360
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,920
Bye, sugar.

361
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,360
And compete for her affections

362
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,440
despite her thinking that they're women.

363
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,920
No butter, no pastry.

364
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,880
We're on a diet.

365
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,200
Oh yeah, well, sure.

366
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,120
But Some Like It Hot is not only considered

367
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,360
to be one of the greatest comedies of all time,

368
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,240
its freewheeling approach to gender and even sexuality

369
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,400
is widely considered to be the nail in the coffin

370
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,360
for the Hays Code,

371
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,040
as it was released without its approval

372
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,000
and was a huge success anyway.

373
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,280
The deception is revealed at the end

374
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,960
with no hard feelings and an ending that...

375
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,760
I'm good on level with you.

376
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,320
We can't get married at all.

377
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,160
Why not?

378
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,360
I'm a man.

379
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,400
Well, nobody's perfect.

380
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,000
Well, I wouldn't even call this a happy hetero ending.

381
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I use the example of Some Like It Hot

382
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,840
to illustrate that even in the 1950s,

383
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,360
a time of heightened anxiety

384
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,320
over all things gender and sexuality,

385
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,480
Kinsey,

386
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,240
cross-dressing wasn't considered inherently deviant.

387
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,920
However, in all of the above examples,

388
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,800
the male protagonist's heterosexuality is not in question.

389
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,480
The joke is that we, the audience,

390
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,560
know the hero's true nature,

391
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,400
but the other characters do not.

392
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,840
But the more, shall we say,

393
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,960
influential representation of cross-dressing

394
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,560
to Joanne's concerns

395
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,600
also involves discovery about the truth

396
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,280
of a character's body.

397
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,480
Such revelation, however, is not comic, but horrific.

398
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,280
So, what changed?

399
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,280
♪♪♪♪♪

400
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,880
Ed Gein was born in Wisconsin in 1906,

401
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,800
the son of an abusive alcoholic father

402
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,680
and a domineering, hyper-religious mother

403
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,520
who only let her kids leave their remote property for school,

404
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,120
even going so far as to punish Ed

405
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,520
when he tried to make friends.

406
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,720
Ed's mother, Agatha,

407
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,680
was a hellfire and brimstone preacher

408
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,880
who preached to her sons

409
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,800
about the innate immorality of the world,

410
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,080
the evils of drinking,

411
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,840
and her belief that all women, apart from herself,

412
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,080
were naturally promiscuous

413
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,480
and the instruments of the devil.

414
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,400
When she died in 1945, Ed was devastated.

415
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,120
In the words of one of his biographers,

416
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,320
he had lost his only friend and one true love.

417
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,040
On the morning of November 16th, 1957,

418
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,600
Plainfield hardware store owner Bernice Worden disappeared.

419
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
Later that evening,

420
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,360
the Washara County Sheriff's Department

421
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,440
discovered Worden's decapitated body

422
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,960
in a shed on Ed Gein's property,

423
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,720
hung upside down by her legs

424
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,320
with a crossbar at her ankles

425
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,000
and ropes at her wrists,

426
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,840
dressed out like a deer.

427
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,720
Gein not only admitted to the murders of Worden

428
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,160
and at least one other woman,

429
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,000
he'd also spent the last decade digging up graves

430
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,680
and exhuming the corpses of women

431
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,720
who looked like his mother.

432
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,880
He took the bodies home

433
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,000
where he tanned their skins to make his paraphernalia.

434
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,720
This paraphernalia included,

435
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,320
but was not limited to,

436
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,680
a waist basket made of human skin,

437
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,800
chair seats made out of human skin,

438
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,560
a corset made from a female torso

439
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,360
skinned from the shoulders to the waist,

440
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,480
leggings made from human skin,

441
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,880
masks made from the skin of female heads,

442
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,640
a lampshade made from the skin of a human face.

443
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,680
You get the idea.

444
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,000
There are other more infamous killers, sure,

445
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,240
but none seem to be so inspiring.

446
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,760
The country was fascinated by Ed Gein,

447
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,280
particularly the type of menace he represented,

448
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,200
a sexual deviant, an Oedipal nightmare,

449
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,160
depicted in the press as a feminine

450
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,120
and gender confused man.

451
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,400
Here, the guise of femininity does not hide

452
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,320
or empower a clever heterosexual man,

453
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,200
but reveals a sexual deviant,

454
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,800
a man in gender distress.

455
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:33,200
Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho changed cinema in a lot of ways,

456
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,240
and deservedly so, in my opinion.

457
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,840
It's my favorite Hitchcock film.

458
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,560
Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh are iconic in their roles

459
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,760
as Norman Bates and Marion Crane.

460
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,800
Techniques that may seem like old hat now

461
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,480
seem that way because Hitchcock was the originator.

462
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,160
We all go a little mad sometimes.

463
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,760
Haven't you?

464
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,320
The plot revolves around the murder of Marion Crane,

465
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,680
who stops at the Bates Motel

466
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,920
after stealing a bunch of money from her workplace.

467
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,480
While staying at the Bates Motel,

468
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,120
Marion realizes her mistake

469
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,520
and decides to go back to her workplace to make amends,

470
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,640
but before she can...

471
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,960
Ow! Ow! No! Ow!

472
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,240
...she's murdered by Norman's mother.

473
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,560
Of course, the twist at the end is that Norman's mother

474
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,640
is actually Norman Bates in drag.

475
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,440
The film does not reveal Norman's identity

476
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,080
as murderer and crossdresser until the end,

477
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,440
in a scene that admittedly did not age well.

478
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,640
Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat! Bat!

479
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,040
It would be accurate to say

480
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,040
that this isn't even really crossdressing.

481
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,840
It's a transvestite.

482
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,440
Uh, not exactly.

483
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,640
Like Ed Gein before him,

484
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,240
Norman is diagnosed with a schizotypal disorder.

485
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,840
He doesn't want to be a woman.

486
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,240
He just hears voices.

487
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,640
He quite literally believes he is his mother.

488
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,040
Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly.

489
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,840
But in terms of things that literally

490
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,440
actually happen on the screen,

491
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,640
Psycho is a film about a man dressing as a woman

492
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,840
while he predates on other women.

493
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,440
First, he leers at them in a way that makes it seem

494
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,640
First, he leers at them in the bathroom,

495
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,440
and then he kills them in the bathroom.

496
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,440
And he predates on women because they are women,

497
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
specifically because the mother personality

498
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,840
is threatened by Norman's attraction to them.

499
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,240
Mother, she's just a stranger.

500
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,040
She's hungry and it's raining out.

501
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,240
Mother, she's just a stranger.

502
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,840
But it's men who desire strangers.

503
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,640
And where is this most iconic of movie scenes set

504
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,240
where this woman is preyed upon,

505
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,640
but the place where she is most vulnerable?

506
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,040
The bathroom.

507
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,440
Thus, it is the figure of Ed Gein

508
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,440
and his fictional counterpart, Norman Bates,

509
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,440
who have captured the imagination of filmmakers

510
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,040
and novelists rather than other serial killers.

511
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,440
Because Psycho is inspired by real-life events, right?

512
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,440
This idea of the cross-dressing serial killer

513
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,840
wasn't made up out of whole cloth, right?

514
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,640
It was.

515
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,040
Life magazine, which ran an eight-page pictorial

516
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,240
sporting the headline,

517
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,240
House of Horror Stuns the Nation,

518
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,840
two weeks after Gein's arrest,

519
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,440
announced that Gein wished he were a woman

520
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,640
After an unidentified investigator

521
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,240
supplied the Milwaukee Journal with information on Gein,

522
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,440
the November 21st issue of the journal ran a story

523
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,440
claiming that Gein's unnatural attachment to his mother

524
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,240
caused an Oedipus complex

525
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,640
that resulted in Ed wishing he had been a woman

526
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,640
instead of a man

527
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,240
and wondering whether it would be possible

528
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,440
to change his sex.

529
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,440
He considered inquiring about an operation

530
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,440
to change into a woman

531
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,240
and even thought about trying the operation upon himself,

532
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,040
but did nothing about such plans.

533
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,240
But here's the thing.

534
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,840
None of it is true.

535
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,040
All of these are slipped to the press

536
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,040
before any real psychoanalysis of the Gein had been done

537
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,840
and none of the psychiatrists who actually analyzed him

538
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,040
concluded that he had any sort of tendencies

539
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,840
towards transvestism or even homosexuality.

540
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,040
Indeed, he seemed pretty honking straight

541
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,640
and resented women just like most serial killers do.

542
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,440
Thus, in part, Gein's infamy resided in an indication

543
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,240
that he was not fully masculine

544
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,640
in an era that was obsessed with proper forms of masculinity.

545
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,840
Ed Gein is remembered as effeminate,

546
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,440
a transvestite, or transsexual,

547
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,640
as well as the narrative trope that explained his psychosis.

548
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,440
And Ed Gein and the character of Norman Bates

549
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,240
are often cited as the first examples of this trope,

550
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,240
but that's actually not entirely true either.

551
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,240
The book Gender-Bending Detective Fiction

552
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,640
cites the 1950 detective novel

553
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,640
Vengeance is Mine by Frank Morris and Spillane,

554
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,840
which centers around a transgender killer

555
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,040
who the detective has felt some attraction to,

556
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,640
as an earlier example,

557
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,440
and that was published seven years

558
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,640
before Ed Gein even got caught.

559
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,040
So, Gein and Psycho may have been the codifiers,

560
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,840
but they weren't the first example

561
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,040
of the murderous crossdresser.

562
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,440
That idea was already there

563
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,040
because the anxiety over gender roles was already there.

564
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,240
Gen Z.

565
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,640
We just needed an excuse to make hay out of it.

566
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,840
So, thanks, Ed Gein.

567
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,240
According to Richard Tithicott,

568
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,840
author of Men and Monsters,

569
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,640
Jeffrey Dahmer, and the Construction of the Serial Killer,

570
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,840
we fail to read the serial killer accurately

571
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,440
because he is an embodiment of society's dominant values.

572
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,040
As a culture, we are so unable to admit or recognize

573
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,640
the connection between our dominant forms of masculinity

574
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,440
and violent misogynist crimes

575
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,840
that we must attribute some other kind of motive to them

576
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,240
besides masculinity.

577
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,240
Instead, motive is attributed to perceived gender deviance,

578
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,040
in particular, the men coveting

579
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,840
or assuming the mantle of femininity

580
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,640
through gender identification or homosexual object choice.

581
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,440
What is the first and principal thing he does?

582
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,840
What needs does he serve by killing?

583
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,840
Acceptance in sexual frustrations.

584
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,840
No, he covets.

585
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,240
The 70s and 80s saw an explosion of films

586
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,640
featuring all sorts of plays

587
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,640
on the murderous crossdresser trope,

588
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,240
with titles like

589
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,640
Deadly Blessing,

590
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,440
No Way to Treat a Lady,

591
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,040
Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde,

592
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,240
Deranged,

593
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,640
Homicidal,

594
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,840
Private Parts,

595
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,040
not that Private Parts,

596
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,640
Stripped to Kill,

597
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,240
Three on a Meat Hook,

598
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,640
Relentless,

599
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,440
Three.

600
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,040
And of course, the most infamous of these

601
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,240
is Brian De Palma's psycho ripoff, Dressed to Kill,

602
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,640
wherein the killer isn't incidentally a crossdresser,

603
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,440
like Norman Bates,

604
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,640
but a canon transsexual.

605
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,240
You see, there's some men and women, too,

606
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,840
think they're born in the wrong body.

607
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,440
They're called transsexuals.

608
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,240
And all they want to do is have their sex changed.

609
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,240
Most include elements of the Gein mythos,

610
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,040
stealing women's body parts after the deed is done,

611
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,840
gender confusion,

612
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,640
which brings us to,

613
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,840
of course,

614
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,840
the act you've all been waiting for.

615
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,840
Goodbye.

616
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,040
So, Silence of the Lambs,

617
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,640
like Psycho before it,

618
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,440
has the problem of

619
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,240
being one of the best movies ever made.

620
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,240
God damn it.

621
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,240
See, this is why good movies are dangerous.

622
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:49,840
This is...

623
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,040
All movies are bad.

624
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,240
Isn't that right, Snoop?

625
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,040
You regret Mac and Devin go to high school, don't you?

626
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,040
Silence of the Lambs is the story of Clarice Starling,

627
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,640
a student at the FBI Academy

628
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,040
who's on the verge of becoming an agent

629
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,640
when she's tasked with profiling

630
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,040
the cannibal serial killer Hannibal Lecter.

631
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,440
I ate his liver with some fava beans

632
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,440
and a nice Chianti.

633
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,640
Pfft.

634
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,640
Hannibal has no interest in being profiled,

635
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,640
but he takes a liking to Clarice in his sociopath way,

636
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,840
and he starts giving her clues

637
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,240
to help solve the real active serial killer case

638
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,440
going on in the world,

639
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,840
that of Buffalo Bill,

640
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,440
so named because he...

641
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,240
Likes to skin his humps.

642
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,640
...gender and power dynamics

643
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,640
are very much at the heart of the film,

644
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,240
which deliberately sort of flips the male gaze.

645
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,640
Her boss doesn't respect her,

646
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,440
her colleagues leer at her,

647
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,440
others in position of authority turn cold

648
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,840
when she politely refuses their advances.

649
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,440
You know, we get a lot of detectives here,

650
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,440
but I must say, I can't ever remember one as attractive.

651
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,440
Only Barney, one of the orderlies at the mental institution,

652
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,840
and Hannibal Lecter, a convicted serial killer,

653
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,840
treat Clarice with any respect.

654
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,040
In contrast to Lecter,

655
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,040
Bill is presented as a deviant and coded hideously queer,

656
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,640
a gay man who lisps and cavorts around his dungeon basement,

657
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,440
listening to Goodbye Horses

658
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,240
and carrying around a poodle named Precious.

659
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,040
Yes, you will, Precious. You'll forget the horse.

660
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,440
The first thing we learn about him

661
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,040
before we even know who he is

662
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,240
is that he had a gay cross-dressing lover

663
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,240
whom he's implied to have killed.

664
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,440
Lecter is a gentleman and a scholar,

665
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,640
Bill is low-class,

666
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,840
and has a Hedwig and the Angry Inch aesthetic.

667
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,040
Lecter appreciates femininity.

668
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,040
Bill wants to appropriate it.

669
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,040
Aaaaah!

670
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,040
Ha! Ha! Aaaaah!

671
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,040
The framing suggests that Bill is monstrous

672
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,640
not so much through his killing,

673
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,640
after all, Lecter is a killer too,

674
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,440
but because he's a man who sews,

675
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,440
wears makeup,

676
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,440
and desires a sex change operation,

677
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,040
even though he's...

678
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,040
Not a real transsexual.

679
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,040
But he thinks he is. He tries to be.

680
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,440
He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.

681
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,840
So Thomas Harris seemed to understand

682
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,840
that he was putting something potentially harmful

683
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,040
into the world

684
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,840
about a group that was already stigmatized.

685
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,640
So the film adds this caveat

686
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,240
about how Buffalo Bill isn't a real tran,

687
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,840
while Clarice makes it clear to Lecter,

688
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,440
and by extension the viewer,

689
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,040
that trans people as a group

690
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,040
don't pose any inherent danger.

691
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,640
There's no correlation in the literature

692
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,440
between transsexualism and violence.

693
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,040
Transsexuals are very passive.

694
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,440
But these little disclaimers

695
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,640
aren't what linger in your mind

696
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,040
when you think of Buffalo Bill.

697
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,840
In fact, everyone I've asked about it

698
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,240
does not even remember this line is even there.

699
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,240
But you know what they do remember?

700
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,240
I'd fuck myself.

701
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,640
He's making himself a woman's suit, Mr. Crawford,

702
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,640
out of real women.

703
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,040
Aaaaah!

704
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,040
I'd fuck myself.

705
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,640
So Silence of the Lambs comes out,

706
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,240
and suddenly those lying duplicitous transes are everywhere.

707
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,640
During this era, if a character is transgender,

708
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,640
it's usually tied to some dark and horrible secret

709
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,440
in the narrative.

710
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,640
And the revelation about the truth of their body

711
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,640
typically is revealed simultaneously

712
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,640
with the revelation of another secret of some sort.

713
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,640
That the person is a liar,

714
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,040
a criminal, or even a killer.

715
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
In 1991's Soap Dish,

716
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,440
a scheming actress named Montana Moorhead

717
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,640
is trying to steal Sally Fields' job as a soap opera star

718
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,840
by sleeping her way to the top.

719
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,040
Only for it to be revealed

720
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,440
that Montana used to be Milton Moorhead.

721
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,640
She was...

722
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,040
Milton Moorhead of Syosset, Long Island.

723
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,040
Hello.

724
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,840
And she flees the set in shame

725
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,440
as the cast and crew look on in shock and horror.

726
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,040
Montana's transgender reveal

727
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,840
elucidates her deceitful nature.

728
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,640
If she lied about being trans,

729
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,240
then she's a liar at heart.

730
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,840
And also a slut.

731
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,440
This is my moment.

732
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,640
I have to seize it.

733
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,040
In 1992's The Crying Game,

734
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,240
an otherwise gritty drama

735
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,440
that was nominated for a bunch of Oscars,

736
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,440
a woman has an affair with a man

737
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,840
who killed her boyfriend,

738
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,040
but she doesn't know that.

739
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,040
And, you know, it's progressing pretty normally

740
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,240
when, blammo!

741
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,440
You did know, didn't you?

742
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,040
Straight to the toilet.

743
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,440
Although I don't super want to misrepresent this movie,

744
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,040
like, it is one of the more, like,

745
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,240
sensitive and nuanced takes

746
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,040
we would see for the next 20 years.

747
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,640
And I also, like, gotta give it credit

748
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,040
for its, like, weirdly sweet ending.

749
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,440
But it does seem to be the first example

750
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,440
of a trope that was going to be

751
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,840
really tiresome.

752
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,640
In Naked Gun, 33 and 1 3rd,

753
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,440
detective Frank Drebin has an on-and-off flirtation

754
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440
with the villain's girlfriend,

755
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,440
played by Anna Nicole Smith,

756
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,240
which culminates with her undressing for him in silhouette,

757
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:49,840
revealing this.

758
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:56,640
And Frank reacts.

759
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,040
But perhaps the most notorious example from this era

760
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,440
comes from Ace Ventura Pet Detective,

761
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,840
wherein it is revealed that a female police detective

762
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,040
that Ace kisses earlier in the film

763
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,840
is the same person as one of Ace's dolphin-kidnapping suspects,

764
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,640
who happens to be a man, honey,

765
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,840
a crazy one that went to a mental institution and everything.

766
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,840
We're talking paranoid delusional psychosis.

767
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,240
I saw the guy's room.

768
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,840
It's cozy if you're Hannibal Lecter.

769
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,640
And when he figures this out, of course.

770
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,240
Oh, my God!

771
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:33,840
Einhorn is a man!

772
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,240
Then at the end, when Ace reveals her former identity

773
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,840
by forcibly exposing the bulge in her underwear

774
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,840
to practically her entire police department

775
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,840
at the end of the movie,

776
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:50,440
wait for it.

777
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,040
One of the major indicators of trans women's villainy

778
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,240
in these movies is that they do not disclose their trans status.

779
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,840
Their trans status is used as shorthand for their duplicitous ways.

780
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,240
The nauseating revelation that they're trans

781
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,040
is typically treated as more shocking and important

782
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,240
than any actual crime they've committed.

783
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,440
There's no meaningful difference made between finding out a woman is trans

784
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,240
and discovering that she's a criminal.

785
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,040
There's also a sort of phobia of intersex and non-binary people, too,

786
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,440
that was, I don't want to say all the rage as much,

787
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,440
but it was definitely a thing in the 90s.

788
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,440
Pat from SNL was a well-known example from this era,

789
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,840
the joke being that no one can ever figure out if Pat is a man or a woman.

790
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:34,440
I was in love with someone who was not what they appeared to be.

791
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,240
Well, and what was it that Chris appeared to be, exactly?

792
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,240
A decent human being.

793
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,240
And this was a character popular enough that they even got their own movie.

794
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,840
We got it in Spaceballs 2.

795
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,640
I'm the bearded lady, but are you one of the freaks?

796
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:55,040
And in a 1998 episode of South Park entitled

797
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,240
Cartman's mom is still a dirty slut.

798
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,040
Cartman's mom is revealed to be intersex.

799
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,440
You're a big fat ass, and your mom's a hermaphrodite!

800
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,640
I'm sorry I never told you, Eric.

801
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,640
But because she is a dirty slut, she also has slept with every man in South Park,

802
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,240
and when they find out about this...

803
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,440
She was a he?

804
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,240
No, no, not exactly, but she did have a penis.

805
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,840
One joke.

806
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,040
One joke.

807
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,240
Yeah, this was eventually retconned, but who cares?

808
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,040
And yes, of course, there's Mr. Garrison.

809
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,440
But I paid $5,000 to be a woman.

810
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,640
This would mean I'm not really a woman.

811
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,040
I'm just a guy with a mutilated penis.

812
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,440
Basically, yes.

813
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,440
If we talked about South Park, we'd be here all day.

814
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,640
I don't really care.

815
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,640
And in the 2000s, the bro comedy emerges.

816
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,040
Dude, where's my car?

817
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,640
In 2000's Dude, Where's My Car?

818
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,840
a stripper gives a couple of stoners money for safekeeping

819
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,440
and reveals her trans status when she demands it back, and...

820
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,640
No!

821
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,440
Oh, dude, you're a dude!

822
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,240
Guys, if the mere sight of a penis makes you want to hurl,

823
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,240
like, how do you live with yourselves? I don't get it.

824
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,240
The trans surprise is there in The 40-Year-Old Virgin and The Hangover 2.

825
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,040
Both have their reveal and the idea of deception and shame for attraction

826
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,640
and or sexual relation with a trans woman.

827
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,640
You know what? Hiring a transvestite prostitute isn't helping me, man.

828
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,640
What? Ain't nobody hiring no damn transvestite.

829
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,040
What? What are you talking about?

830
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,040
She was really nice, incidentally.

831
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,440
But at least they've stopped puking.

832
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,240
You in Bangkok, sweetie?

833
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,040
That's the reason they don't call it Bangkok.

834
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,040
Oh!

835
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,040
Also noteworthy that most of these characters are sex workers.

836
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,040
In Family Guy, it pops up a few times,

837
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,840
most notably in an episode called Quagmire's Dad,

838
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,840
where it is revealed that Quagmire's Dad transitioned at some point

839
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,440
after fathering Quagmire.

840
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,440
Brian sleeps with her, and when he finds out...

841
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,440
Are you done?

842
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,440
This scene goes on for a minute.

843
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,440
Trans panic puke walked so attack helicopter could fly.

844
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,440
Literally.

845
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,440
Also, like, Quagmire's Dad slept with a dog.

846
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,440
And the dog is the nauseated one in this scenario.

847
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,440
But it wasn't in just stuff for bros.

848
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,440
In a 2000 episode of Sex and the City called...

849
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,440
Cock-a-doodle-doo,

850
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,040
Samantha's not thrilled with the, uh...

851
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,040
There they were.

852
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,040
Samantha's friendly neighborhood pre-op transsexual hookers.

853
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,040
Oh, hey.

854
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,040
Sex workers and women of color.

855
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,040
Nice.

856
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,040
I am paying a fortune to live in a neighborhood

857
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,040
that's trendy by day and tr-y by night.

858
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,040
It's like...

859
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,040
It's like sometimes it starts to be okay, and then...

860
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,040
Aha!

861
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,040
Don't I know it?

862
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,040
Samantha always knew how to get her way with men.

863
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,040
Oh, goddammit, Curie.

864
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,640
They party at the end of the episode, so it's fine, I guess, but...

865
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,640
Oh, no.

866
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,640
This episode is just...

867
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,640
It's...

868
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,640
It's so cringe.

869
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,640
No, Sarah Jessica Parker, stop.

870
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,640
Stop.

871
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,640
Oh, what are you doing? No.

872
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,640
I don't know, there's something about the well-meaningness

873
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,640
that makes it even more cringe.

874
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,640
Don't worry.

875
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,640
They have a very lovely life.

876
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,640
GLAAD did a survey of the representation of trans people

877
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,240
on television from 2002 to 2012,

878
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,240
most of which cataloged procedurals like

879
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,240
NCIS and Law & Order and...

880
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,240
Because that was most of what was on TV.

881
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,240
But the survey found that transgender characters

882
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,240
were cast as killers or villains

883
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,240
in at least 21% of the cataloged episodes and storylines.

884
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,240
The most common profession transgender characters

885
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,240
were depicted as having was that of sex workers,

886
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,240
which a fifth of all characters were depicted as.

887
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,840
An anti-trans slurs, language, and dialogue

888
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,840
was present in at least 61% of the cataloged episodes and storylines.

889
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,840
But starting in the 2000s, the narrative also shifted,

890
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,840
and we started to see more positive representation

891
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,840
of trans people in films and TV shows like

892
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,840
The Danish Girl, Transparent, Orange is the New Black,

893
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,840
Transamerica, Boys Don't Cry, and Dallas Buyers Club.

894
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,840
Now there's this attempt in the mainstream

895
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,840
to empathize with the trans experience,

896
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,840
where before it was...

897
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:51,440
And a lot of people feel like these efforts fall short,

898
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,440
especially when a cis actor plays a trans character,

899
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,440
which is... most of them.

900
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,440
All of them, except Orange is the New Black.

901
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,440
But even though that does deserve some scrutiny,

902
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,440
the fact is that now you have a mainstream who is ready,

903
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,440
even eager, to empathize with trans characters.

904
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,040
And in a way, this is what's threatening to people like Joanne.

905
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,040
Before, these characters were killers, and liars,

906
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,040
and criminals, and sex perverts, or all of the above.

907
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,040
But now, they're people with humanity and depth?

908
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,040
Hmm.

909
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,040
Which brings us to...

910
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,040
Troubled Blood is the fifth book in J.K. Rowling's

911
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,040
Cormoran Strike detective novel series,

912
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,040
written under the pen name of Robert Galbraith.

913
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,040
In this installment, it's titular hero, Cormoran,

914
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,040
an army veteran turned private detective,

915
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,040
and his partner, Robin,

916
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,040
basically a younger, hot J.K. Rowling,

917
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,040
Her face in the wing mirror was pale,

918
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,040
her blue eyes bloodshot,

919
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,040
and the strawberry blonde hair currently hidden

920
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,040
under a black beanie hat needed a wash,

921
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,040
are trying to solve a 40-year-old cold case

922
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,040
of a missing doctor, Margaret Bambrough.

923
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,040
You see, Bambrough, who was a gorgeous,

924
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,040
strong-headed second-wave feminist,

925
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,040
left her office one evening after treating

926
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,040
a shady, masculine-looking woman

927
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,040
who was never seen again.

928
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,040
And everyone, including Bambrough's now-grown daughter,

929
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,040
assumes that Margot was an unconfirmed victim

930
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,040
of the Essex Butcher, a 70s serial killer

931
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,040
who liked to kidnap women,

932
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,040
chain them up in his basement,

933
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,040
and eventually rape and murder them.

934
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,040
And he dressed like a woman to do it.

935
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,040
He likes dressing up in women's clothing to get off,

936
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,040
and he uses makeup and wigs

937
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,040
to make himself less threatening

938
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,040
so he can gain access to women's spaces

939
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,040
to lure them into a false sense of security

940
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,040
for the easier murdering.

941
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,040
Well, it's Cormoran on the case.

942
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,040
Who killed the second-wave feminist doctor?

943
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,040
Was it the Essex Butcher?

944
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,040
Or could it have been the ex-boyfriend artist?

945
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,040
Or the medical clerk who is so very fat

946
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,040
and wears a lot of makeup?

947
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,040
She's really fat, and she wears too much makeup.

948
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,040
Like her sitting room, Irene Hickson presented

949
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,040
a first impression of over-embellished,

950
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,040
over-padded opulence.

951
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,040
Just as blonde as she'd been at 25,

952
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,040
she was now much heavier with an enormous bosom.

953
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,040
She'd outlined her hooded eyes in black,

954
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,040
penciled her sparse brows into a high, Piero-ish arc,

955
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,040
and painted her thin lips in scarlet.

956
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,040
Irene helped herself to another biscuit,

957
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,040
frowning slightly.

958
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,040
Janice passed around fresh cups of tea and coffee.

959
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,040
Irene helped herself to another chocolate biscuit,

960
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,040
looking as though she'd said something very clever

961
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,040
as she reached forwards to take another biscuit,

962
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,040
and a deafening fart ripped through the room.

963
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,040
Or could it be the nurse

964
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,040
who speaks like a Cockney cartoon chap?

965
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,040
What?

966
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,040
Aw, you know Dr. Brenner probably taught Carl a fence-off.

967
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,040
He was an only terror when he was a kid, Carl,

968
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,040
and he comes across as the kind of man who owns a garage.

969
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,040
Or the questionably gay, I'm sorry,

970
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,040
camp man who just loves karaoke?

971
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,040
And will Cormoran and the J.K. Rowling stand-in

972
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,040
finally, finally confess their very hetero love

973
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,040
for each other?

974
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,040
So, this is 900 pages of J.K.'s worst tendencies,

975
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,040
from phonetically writing out accents,

976
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,040
He started dropping in, telling me all his problems,

977
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,040
and he tells me how he's mad about this married woman,

978
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,040
falling for his mate's wife.

979
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,040
On and on and on about how odd her life is,

980
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,040
and there's me sitting there with a kid of my own.

981
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,040
What about my odd life?

982
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,040
She had an husband, didn't she?

983
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,040
To the cool girl not being like the other girls,

984
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,040
to a predilection for describing characters' appearances

985
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,040
and weight so thoroughly and repeatedly

986
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,040
that it honestly becomes kind of uncomfortable.

987
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,040
Robin was trying to eat healthily

988
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,040
in spite of her unsociable hours,

989
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,040
but the almonds had long since ceased to be appetizing,

990
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,040
and she craved nothing more than a bit of the pizza

991
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,040
she could see an overweight couple enjoying

992
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,040
in the restaurant window.

993
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,040
A hugely obese...

994
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,040
Okay, this is getting ridiculous.

995
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,040
A hugely obese old lady came into view

996
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,040
on the landing above them.

997
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,040
She was clad in shorts,

998
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,040
She was clad in shocking pink leggings

999
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,040
and a T-shirt bearing the slogan,

1000
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,040
The more people I meet, the more I like my dog.

1001
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,040
The only occupant, a small, obese, bespectacled man,

1002
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,040
wore jeans and a black sweatshirt.

1003
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,040
He had a triple chin,

1004
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,040
and his belly kept him a foot and a half away

1005
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,040
from the white formica-topped table at which he was sitting.

1006
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,040
Seriously, Joanne, what fat person hurt you?

1007
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,040
In terms of theory, it's easy to read

1008
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,040
a lot of biological determinist second-wave feminism

1009
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,040
into troubled blood's influence.

1010
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,040
Second-wave feminists coined the idea

1011
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,040
that gender is a social construct,

1012
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,040
but sex is a biological prison

1013
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,040
from which there is no escape.

1014
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,040
Asterisk.

1015
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,040
There's a whole lot of flim-flam about gender roles

1016
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,040
and how Strike's on-again, off-again flame

1017
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,040
slash assistant is not like the other women.

1018
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,040
Lots of women do this, men do that.

1019
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,040
So much rape, and men can't be trusted

1020
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,040
to not hurt women and do the rape.

1021
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,040
Except Strike, of course, he's fine.

1022
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,040
Joanne has a lot of opinion about not just the transes,

1023
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,040
but the state of womanhood in general.

1024
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,040
Such as modern fourth-wave feminists

1025
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:00,040
with their slut walks and selfies and too much makeup,

1026
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,040
are frivolous little bitches who don't organize

1027
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,040
and actually work for a change

1028
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,040
like their second-wave counterparts, the good ones.

1029
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,040
Women who are uggos are just reeling for blood.

1030
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,040
Actually, no, you don't need to be a full-on uggo,

1031
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:16,040
you need to be, like, a six to go into a murderous rage

1032
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,040
because boys don't like you.

1033
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,040
That don't help a woman. It's better to be pretty.

1034
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,040
You'll have a better life if you're good-looking.

1035
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,040
Men always went for Irene, not me.

1036
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,040
Why wouldn't anyone marry me?

1037
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,040
What haven't I got that I'm a woman, Ev?

1038
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,040
No one suspects the six.

1039
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,040
Ancients.

1040
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,040
Repeated Janice Beattie as the police car

1041
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,040
drew to a halt outside her front door

1042
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,040
and she squared her shoulders ready to accept her fate.

1043
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,040
Ev consequences.

1044
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,040
You don't have to write the accent in, Joanne.

1045
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,040
We get that you hate poor people.

1046
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:52,040
Contraception is fine, but abortion is morally dubious.

1047
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,040
Imagine aborting your husband's...

1048
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,040
What the fuck?

1049
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,040
When you asked me to read these,

1050
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,040
I didn't think they would be this bad.

1051
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,040
Imagine aborting your husband's child, she thought.

1052
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,040
Could Margot really have done that

1053
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,040
when she already had that child's sister at home?

1054
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,040
Oh.

1055
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,040
To quote Vox.com's review of the book,

1056
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,040
it's the writing of someone who feels she has no choice

1057
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,040
but to bring some home truth to you, the reader,

1058
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,040
and damn the consequences.

1059
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,040
Now, you might be thinking,

1060
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,040
I heard from other YouTubers who totally,

1061
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,040
100% read the e-book.

1062
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,040
I read the book, I spent the last 12 hours

1063
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,040
reading it as an e-book.

1064
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,040
I mean the hard copy.

1065
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,040
With overnight shipping, a long, obnoxiously thick novel.

1066
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,040
I'm sorry, I mean the e-book.

1067
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,040
Reading it as an e-book.

1068
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,040
Shout out to D'Angelo for catching that.

1069
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,040
That the serial killer in question

1070
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,040
is a cis man specifically,

1071
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,040
and not a trans woman.

1072
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,040
It only ever really seems to paint him

1073
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,040
as just a pervert who looks cross-dressing

1074
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,040
but he's male.

1075
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,040
What do any of these tropes about women in general

1076
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,040
have to do with transphobia?

1077
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,040
Well, the book has this very Victorian

1078
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,040
men and women do some things differently

1079
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,040
and ne'er the twain shall meet thread.

1080
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,040
Much in the way that, well, the Victorians

1081
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,040
describe the phenomena as living in

1082
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,040
separate spheres.

1083
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,040
And to me, J.K. Rowling making the killer

1084
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,040
a self-identified man in the context

1085
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,040
of her public comments feels less

1086
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,040
like her trying to assure the reader

1087
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,040
that he is not trans, and more like

1088
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,040
an assertion that any man in a wig

1089
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,040
and lipstick has the potential to invade

1090
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,040
women's holy spaces and rape and kill them.

1091
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,040
When you throw open the doors

1092
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,040
of bathrooms and changing rooms

1093
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,040
to any man who believes or feels he's a woman

1094
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,040
and, as I've said, gender confirmation

1095
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,040
certificates may now be granted without

1096
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,040
any need for surgery or hormones

1097
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,040
then you open the door to any and all

1098
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,040
men who wish to come inside.

1099
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,040
That is the simple truth.

1100
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,040
The way she describes her worries

1101
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,040
in her essay completely lines up

1102
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,040
with her serial killer's modus operandi

1103
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,040
in Troubled Blood. And no,

1104
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,040
I don't think it's a coincidence that these came out

1105
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,040
at the same time,

1106
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,040
summer of last year.

1107
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,040
And this actually lies in contrast to Silence of the Lambs

1108
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,040
wherein Thomas Harris

1109
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,040
is even more aware than the movie

1110
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,040
of the harm a transgender serial killer

1111
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,040
could do to the trans community.

1112
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,040
There's even a whole subplot

1113
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,040
in the book where Crawford goes to the

1114
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,040
gender reassignment clinic.

1115
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,040
To even mention Buffalo Bill in the same breath

1116
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,040
with the problems we treat here is ignorant

1117
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,040
and unfair and dangerous, Mr. Crawford.

1118
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,040
It makes my hair stand on end.

1119
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,040
It's taken years, we're not through yet

1120
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,040
showing the public that transsexuals

1121
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,040
aren't crazy, they aren't perverts,

1122
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,040
they aren't queers,

1123
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,040
whatever that is. Hold on,

1124
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,040
the incidence of violence among transsexuals is a lot

1125
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,040
lower than in the general population.

1126
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,040
These are decent people with a real problem,

1127
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,040
a famously intransigent problem.

1128
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,040
They deserve help and we can give it.

1129
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,040
And Crawford's like, ah, I know, but I know

1130
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,040
that and that's why we need to know who you rejected

1131
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,040
because we know Bill is not a true

1132
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,040
tran, a true tran would never.

1133
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,040
The whole idea is the man we want

1134
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,040
is not your patient.

1135
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,040
It would be someone you refused because you

1136
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,040
recognized that he was not a transsexual.

1137
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,040
So even the author of the most

1138
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,040
popular example of the gender distressed

1139
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,040
serial killer is conscious of the fact

1140
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,040
that trans people exist, that their

1141
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,040
perception as predatory has no statistical

1142
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,040
data to back it, and the

1143
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,040
existence of a trans serial killer

1144
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,040
would really affect the entire

1145
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,040
community. But in Treble Blood,

1146
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,040
gender nonconformity isn't even

1147
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,040
mentioned outside of Dennis Creed,

1148
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,040
sex pervert, who wears women's

1149
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,040
clothes to get off.

1150
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,040
He soon progressed to stealing women's underwear

1151
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,040
from neighbors' washing lines and even

1152
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,040
from his grandmother, Aina.

1153
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,040
These he enjoying wearing

1154
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,040
in secret. What?

1155
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,040
There's never any actual discussion about being

1156
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,040
transgender either, almost as if to say

1157
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,040
that there are no trans women, that

1158
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,040
anyone not assigned female at birth who

1159
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,040
appears feminine is using it

1160
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,040
to deceive women in some way.

1161
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,040
In effect, every trans woman

1162
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,040
is a potential Buffalo Bill.

1163
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,040
I'd fuck myself.

1164
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,040
So Treble Blood is

1165
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,040
effectually resurrecting a trope that is already

1166
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,040
really dated, you know, in the way that

1167
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,040
foppish gay hairstyling

1168
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,040
besties are dated, but is still playing into

1169
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,040
a trope that has very real-world consequences,

1170
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,040
namely the idea that trans women are

1171
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,040
inherently predatory. And I don't mean to

1172
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,040
imply that trans people can't be

1173
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,040
predatory or abusive.

1174
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,040
Every group has perverts and weirdos.

1175
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,040
But being a pervert and

1176
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,040
or weirdo doesn't have anything to do with one's

1177
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,040
transness any more than it would

1178
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,040
someone's, I don't know, gayness

1179
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,040
or depression or whatever.

1180
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,040
But this is the association that runs

1181
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,040
deep in the popular consciousness.

1182
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,040
She was described in court as a predator

1183
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,040
who was a danger to women

1184
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,040
and to children. I can only surmise

1185
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,040
that the case of Karen White is

1186
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,040
one of the things that upset her so much.

1187
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,040
Karen, once known as

1188
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,040
Stephen Wood, appeared by a video link

1189
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,040
from the men's prison at Armley in Leeds

1190
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,040
wearing a wig, glasses, and a

1191
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,040
floral blouse. Karen White is a

1192
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,040
trans woman in the UK who is currently

1193
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,040
in prison for various crimes,

1194
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,040
a lot of them sex crimes, in a men's

1195
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,040
prison as far as the most recent update.

1196
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,040
According to this article in the Independent,

1197
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,040
White used her transgender

1198
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,040
persona to put herself in contact

1199
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,040
with vulnerable women. Right off the

1200
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,040
bat, the media inextricably links

1201
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,040
her sex crimes with her transness.

1202
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,040
Notably, the Independent article uses

1203
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,040
the prosecutor's interpretation of events

1204
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,040
and doesn't mention the defense's

1205
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,040
interpretation at all, saying there was

1206
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,040
evidence to suggest that her approach

1207
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,040
to transitioning has been less than

1208
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,040
committed, and in fact was designed

1209
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,040
to allow White access to vulnerable

1210
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,040
victims, dressed up in drag

1211
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,040
to gain access to women's spaces

1212
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,040
and lure them into a false sense of security.

1213
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,040
Hmm. Man, at least

1214
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,040
when Jack Lemmon did it, it was fun.

1215
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,040
It's not my fault I

1216
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,040
didn't invite them.

1217
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,040
So this article isn't just a list of White's

1218
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,040
crimes, which are allegedly very real,

1219
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,040
but a pointed effort to paint

1220
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,040
White not as a criminal who happens to be

1221
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,040
trans, but spotlighting her

1222
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,040
transness somehow as relevant to

1223
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,040
her crimes. Let's take a look at

1224
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,040
one of the favorite articles TERFs like to

1225
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,040
cite as evidence for the inherent dangers

1226
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,040
trans women present.

1227
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,040
Transgender inmates have carried out

1228
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,040
seven sex attacks...

1229
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,040
Sex attack.

1230
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,040
I want a man who wants to

1231
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,040
make a sex attack on me.

1232
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,040
Transgender inmates have carried out seven sex attacks

1233
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,040
on women in jail, despite the risks

1234
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,040
male-born trans convicts are still

1235
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,040
allowed to move into women's prisons.

1236
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,040
So conservative politician Richard Cain made

1237
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,040
this statement, which then went viral,

1238
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,040
and the Ministry of Justice has said,

1239
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,040
since 2010, out of the 124

1240
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,040
sexual assaults that occurred in the

1241
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,040
female estate, a total of seven of those

1242
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,040
were sexual assaults against females in

1243
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,040
custody, perpetrated by

1244
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,040
transgender individuals.

1245
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,040
Snoop, I know you're not with

1246
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,040
the Crips anymore, but please don't kill me for that

1247
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,040
trans flag thing.

1248
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,040
Basically, this article talks about transgender

1249
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,040
INDIVIDUALS

1250
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,040
assaulting women in women's prisons, which

1251
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,040
let's assume that that's

1252
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,040
true. This word

1253
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,040
INDIVIDUALS is doing a lot

1254
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,040
of heavy lifting, because it's assuming that

1255
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,040
trans women are doing the predation,

1256
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,040
but neglects the fact that most

1257
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,040
trans INDIVIDUALS

1258
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,040
in women's prisons are

1259
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,040
assigned female at birth trans men.

1260
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,040
According to the data, we do have

1261
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,040
trans men outnumber trans women

1262
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,040
in women's prisons in the UK almost

1263
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,040
2 to 1. So assuming that

1264
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,040
sex attack number is correct, it doesn't

1265
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,040
say how many of these seven are

1266
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,040
trans men, trans women,

1267
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,040
non-binary, or whatever.

1268
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,040
So while the implication here is that men

1269
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,040
in drag are sneaking into women's

1270
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,040
prisons to assault cis women,

1271
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,040
they aren't telling us who is doing the

1272
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,040
assaulting. So if by extreme

1273
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,040
technicality the Daily Mail is

1274
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,040
not representing a falsehood in this article,

1275
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,040
and for the sake of argument,

1276
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,040
let's just assume that they're not,

1277
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,040
even though I have my doubts,

1278
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,040
they are relying on the reader's

1279
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,040
biases to connect the dots

1280
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,040
that trans women are predatory and

1281
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,040
are a danger to cis women. Also

1282
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,040
all of the data this article draws on is a

1283
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,040
mess. Found out the hard way that the UK

1284
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,040
apparently does not keep nearly as good data

1285
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,040
on sexual assault as prisons in the US

1286
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,040
do, and just the way that

1287
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,040
things are phrased in this report

1288
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,040
is super confusing to read

1289
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,040
and therefore really easy for

1290
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,040
bad faith actors to misrepresent.

1291
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,040
For instance, there are the people who take bits of data

1292
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,040
and clearly willfully misrepresent

1293
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,040
them, like saying

1294
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,040
139 transgender inmates are currently

1295
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,040
housed in women's prisons.

1296
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,040
Which is just flat out wrong. It's a lie.

1297
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,040
That was the total number of

1298
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,040
transgender prisoners in 2018

1299
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,040
in prisons for either sex.

1300
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,040
But that comes with an even weirder caveat

1301
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,040
because this 139 transgender

1302
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,040
inmates number does not

1303
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,040
include people who have legally transitioned

1304
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,040
and have the gender recognition

1305
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,040
certificate that Joanne

1306
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,040
is so f***ing mad about.

1307
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,040
So people who are transgender

1308
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,040
and have fully legally transitioned

1309
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,040
and ended up in prison

1310
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,040
somehow, aren't even accounted for

1311
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,040
in this 139 number.

1312
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,040
So who are these

1313
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,040
people? Eh?

1314
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,040
How are they counting them? Eh?

1315
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,040
So it's absurd for them to claim

1316
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,040
that they can draw accurate conclusions about

1317
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,040
the dangers of the predatory trans

1318
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,040
because that data does not

1319
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,040
exist. And on the claim that transgender

1320
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,040
people are disproportionately imprisoned

1321
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,040
for committing sex offenses, another

1322
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,040
TERF favorite in the UK,

1323
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,040
according to the UK non-profit

1324
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,040
Bent Bars,

1325
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,040
And like with so many things,

1326
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,040
that statistic is completely made up.

1327
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,040
But it sounds plausible,

1328
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,040
doesn't it? Because that presumption

1329
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,040
of trans women as predatory

1330
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,040
is already there.

1331
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,040
Inside your mind.

1332
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,040
Like the fanci-

1333
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,040
I'm sorry. So you have this combination of people

1334
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,040
with specifically anti-trans agendas

1335
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,040
spreading misinformation based on a misrepresentation

1336
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,040
of data that is already insufficient,

1337
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,040
melding with an extremely

1338
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,040
common trope going all the way back to

1339
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,040
Ed Gein that there's just something inherently

1340
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,040
predatory about trans women.

1341
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,040
So while Troubled Blood definitely

1342
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,040
has an early 90's

1343
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,040
dated-ness to it, as Natalie

1344
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,040
put it, my enemy

1345
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,040
eternal, whore, you'd think that a

1346
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,040
seasoned writer like Joanne would at least put a

1347
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,040
new twist on the crossdressing murderer

1348
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,040
trope. But she doesn't.

1349
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,040
It's just dressed to kill. Only

1350
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,040
in this book, the crossdresser is a red herring.

1351
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,040
Spoilers.

1352
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,040
Spoilers.

1353
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,040
We have no evidence that trans women

1354
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,040
are any more danger to cis women

1355
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,040
than other cis women, in prison or

1356
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,040
otherwise. And non-prison-related

1357
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,040
studies do bear this out.

1358
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,040
But we do have mountains of evidence for who is

1359
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,040
really in danger in prison.

1360
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,040
This being, of course, trans women.

1361
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,040
One statewide study in California

1362
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,040
found that when transgender women were automatically

1363
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,040
housed with men, they were 13

1364
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,040
times more likely to be sexually assaulted

1365
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,040
than male prisoners in the same facility.

1366
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,040
And a report from the U.S. Bureau of

1367
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,040
Justice Statistics said that from 2011

1368
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,040
to 2012, 40% of

1369
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,040
transgender prisoners reported being the victim of

1370
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,040
a sexual assault within the previous 12 months,

1371
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,040
10 times the percentage of non-transgender

1372
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,040
inmates. Regarding the case

1373
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,040
of Karen White, a U.K. prison spokesperson

1374
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,040
said,

1375
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,040
But surely

1376
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,040
your trans prisoners fall under the

1377
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,040
umbrella of all prisoners.

1378
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,040
So, what about them?

1379
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,040
The message is clear.

1380
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,040
The priority of cis women's feelings

1381
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,040
of being in danger, rather than the reality

1382
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,040
of trans people being more at risk.

1383
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,040
And where do these feelings come from but the cultural

1384
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,040
boogeyman of the predatory tran?

1385
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,040
So, there's already

1386
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,040
been a lot of discussion by

1387
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,040
people who are not me, and

1388
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,040
who actually care about this

1389
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,040
sort of thing, about the weird gender subtext

1390
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,040
in the Harry Potter series.

1391
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,040
Whether it's Cho Chang, or

1392
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,040
Voldemort's mother, or

1393
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,040
basically any woman in the Fantastic

1394
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,040
Beasts series. But, you know,

1395
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,040
it was easy to hand-wave away with claims of

1396
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,040
like, you know, well, J.K., but she donated

1397
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,040
to ex-feminist charity, or, you know,

1398
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,040
they're children's stories, it's not that deep, bro.

1399
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,040
But, it's clear

1400
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,040
now that there's always been this sort of current

1401
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,040
in her work of acceptable

1402
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,040
womanhood. In terms of actual

1403
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,040
personhood, no one should care anymore

1404
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,040
about what J.K. Rowling thinks

1405
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,040
than, like, you know, Sharon from Dayton, Ohio.

1406
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,040
Who cares what she thinks?

1407
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,040
The thing we should care about is her

1408
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,040
influence, and that's why we even have to have this

1409
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,040
stupid f***ing discussion

1410
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,040
in the first place. The International Lesbian

1411
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,040
Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Intersex

1412
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,040
Association's 2021 Review of LGBT

1413
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,040
Human Rights in Europe specifically

1414
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,040
said this of Rowling's influence in the UK.

1415
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,040
Anti-trans rhetoric continued

1416
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,040
to cause serious damage in the UK

1417
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,040
again this year. A prime example is

1418
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,040
repeated transphobic attacks by author J.K.

1419
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,040
Rowling on Twitter and in her writing.

1420
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,040
The report warns that in some parts of the

1421
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,040
UK, hate crimes had been steadily

1422
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,040
increasing, in part due to an increase

1423
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,040
in reporting, but also influenced by

1424
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,040
increasing hostility in UK-wide media

1425
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,040
towards trans identities and communities.

1426
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,040
Mainstream media has only just begun

1427
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,040
to center trans characters, creative heads,

1428
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,040
and actors. You have shows like Pose,

1429
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,040
produced, written, and directed in part by Janet Mock,

1430
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,040
a trans woman of color, and also starring

1431
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,040
multiple trans actors. God may have

1432
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,040
blessed you with Barbies, a backyard with a

1433
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,040
pony in it, a boyfriend named Jake, and an unwanted

1434
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,040
pregnancy that your father paid to terminate so

1435
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,040
you could go to college and major in being a basic

1436
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,040
bitch. Or Sensate, produced, written,

1437
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,040
and directed by the Wachowski sisters and starring

1438
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,040
Jamie Clayton. Hell, there's even Difficult People's

1439
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,040
Lola, played by trans comedian and actress

1440
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,040
Shakina Nafak. Third airplane

1441
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,040
goes right into the Pentagon?

1442
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,040
I don't think so, bitches. That was

1443
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,040
a missile. And Tower 7 was brought down

1444
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,040
by a bomb. Whose transness takes a backseat

1445
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,040
to the fact that she's Billy Eichner's work

1446
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,040
enemy and also a massive 9-11 truther.

1447
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,040
May your love shine as bright as the

1448
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,040
sun did on that fair September morn

1449
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,040
when George W. Bush pulled off the greatest scam

1450
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,040
in American history since the moon landing.

1451
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,040
On the character, Nafak had this to say,

1452
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,040
In the quest for transgender visibility, we've

1453
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,040
only been introduced to sympathetic roles that rely

1454
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,040
on victimization or stereotypes in order

1455
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,040
to elicit empathy from our audiences.

1456
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,040
You're gonna love Lola because she's strong and opinionated

1457
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,040
and crass, not because she's getting

1458
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,040
bashed, locked up, or wrestling with coming

1459
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,040
out. You do seem happier than usual.

1460
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,040
Granted, that bar is set about as low as the burning

1461
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,040
temperature of jet fuel. So how can it

1462
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,040
melt steel beams? Exactly.

1463
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,040
So while there's still the Ready Player Two's or

1464
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,040
cyberpunk 2077's of the world

1465
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,040
that include trans characters with,

1466
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,040
and I say this very generously, good

1467
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,040
intentions of inclusion,

1468
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,040
while still falling on the spectrum of reducing trans

1469
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,040
people to sexual commodities, progress

1470
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,040
is being made and even embraced, which

1471
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,040
is why it's disappointing and almost

1472
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,040
surprising that something so archaic

1473
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,040
as troubled blood is even a thing.

1474
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,040
In terms of theory and media crit,

1475
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,040
I have done what I can do.

1476
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,040
But in terms of YouTube drama,

1477
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,040
well, only you can help with that.

1478
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,040
So I'm not kidding, this is real,

1479
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,040
all of the profits from our feud merch

1480
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,040
will go to...

1481
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,040
Sir not appearing in this film.

1482
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,040
It will be a good one,

1483
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,040
I promise. Blame Addison

1484
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,040
Cain for me not being.

1485
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,040
And remember, trans women are not

1486
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,040
predatory, except for that whore

1487
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,040
Natalie.

1488
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,040
Leave me a message about how Hitchcock is

1489
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,040
a problematic too, I haven't heard that one.

1490
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,040
Okay, I guess that's it, I'm done.

1491
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,040
I finally have a dozen of my donuts

1492
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,040
Delicious donuts

1493
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,040
They're downright dunky

1494
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,040
And they are definitely

1495
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,040
done by only me

1496
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,040
Yes they are deep fried

1497
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,040
dipped and dabbed by Mr. D

1498
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,040
And when I deliver

1499
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,040
my delicious donuts

1500
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,040
I do

1501
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,040
the donut dance

1502
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,040
Don't you want to do

1503
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,040
the dance too?

1504
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,040
What a delicious

1505
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,040
donut dance

1506
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,040
If you like donuts

1507
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,040
Delicious donuts

1508
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,040
Don't dilly-dally, have a dozen

1509
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,040
of my donuts

1510
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,040
Delicious donuts

1511
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,040
Hold on, I paused in the middle to record that clip

1512
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,040
What does he say next?

1513
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,040
I'm just gonna say, I haven't read this book, I don't even know if it's

1514
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,040
I'm just gonna say, I haven't read this book, I don't even know if it's
