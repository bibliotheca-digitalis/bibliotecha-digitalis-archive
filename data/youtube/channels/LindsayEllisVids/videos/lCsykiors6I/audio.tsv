0	1000	All right, hey!
1000	2000	Ah, we're girly!
2000	3000	We're girly!
3000	4000	We drink mimosas!
4000	5000	Yeah, that's right, we're wearing shorts.
5000	6000	And shitboard glasses.
6000	17880	Hey, that's, that's what champagne is supposed to be served in, it's like these 1920s style
17880	21080	glasses that we totally didn't drink margaritas out of last week.
21080	22360	I was 10.
22360	23680	How did you find Conbravo?
23680	25160	It was great!
25160	28440	So many people wanted to hear about sexy Cthulhu.
28440	35080	Yeah, and so many people were kind of, uh, bewildered, I guess?
35080	38440	Um, so, oh, it's Twilight with Cthulhu.
38440	41480	They would either run screaming or be like, shit, I have to read that!
41480	45120	Yeah, there was a lot of, like, I gotta buy this out of morbid curiosity.
45120	50960	So if you happen to, um, you know, get one of these things, and if you had the time to
50960	55240	read it, go on to Goodreads and leave Sarah a review.
55240	56720	She will really appreciate it.
56720	61720	She really, like, desperately needs validation, and if you're a hater, that's okay.
61720	64800	She needs validation from you too, attention is attention.
64800	69160	So we had this little temporary version that we printed off specifically for Conbravo and
69160	70160	for this bookstore launch.
70160	74720	Yeah, we made it small and cheap and we just got it out there real quick.
74720	80400	But, uh, now we need to start thinking about the for real launch since we're doing it the
80400	84880	old fashioned way where we have to, like, build buzz and, uh.
85040	87720	Yeah, I mean, that's the way the publishing industry is now.
87720	90840	Even if you get picked up by a real agent and a real publisher, they still expect you
90840	92880	to do a lot of your own marketing.
92880	95360	And it ends up just taking, like, half the length of time.
95360	100320	The publishing is just, like, the pre-release buzz business and it just takes so freaking
100320	101320	long.
101320	103480	Like, two years, so we're thinking more like.
103480	104480	A month.
104480	105480	A month.
105480	106480	Yeah, a month.
106480	107480	Cause, cause.
107480	108480	From now.
108480	109480	Yeah, from now.
109480	110480	Cause we're impatient and we know that you're probably going to forget about it if we wait
110480	111480	too much longer.
111480	112480	Strike the iron while it's hot.
113080	116760	Yeah, but we're going to try and do, like, all the stuff that you're supposed to do in,
116760	121280	uh, like, you know, six to nine months in, uh, one.
121280	124400	So that means we need a cover.
124400	125400	Like a real one.
125400	137400	A real one is a cover that is the trope-iest of, you know, clich√©-ist of what is young
137400	138920	adult today.
138920	139920	Or yesterday.
139920	140920	Or what people think about.
140920	141920	Yeah.
142360	143360	What do we got?
143360	144360	What's we got?
144360	145360	Okay, so here's some examples.
145360	147080	You've got the typical simple object on black.
147080	151280	That's, that's your, your twilight and everything there derived.
151280	156240	You've got your simple object, but boys will like this too.
156240	161040	This is actually, like, this is, I think, is why, uh, The Hunger Games is so brilliant
161040	163400	is because it's so gender neutral.
163400	166240	This is still three years, four years old.
166240	167240	No, this is way older.
167240	168320	Yeah, so that's old.
168320	169320	So here is.
169320	170320	But that doesn't, like, it's okay.
170320	171320	Cause people are still.
171720	172720	This is 2008, so this is five years old.
172720	175240	Yeah, but this is what's, what that's turned into.
175240	179520	Like, you can see the influence of The Hunger Games and the twilight.
179520	180840	This is two-ish.
180840	184120	This one's two years old, which totally isn't ripping off.
184120	185120	Hunger Games or Twilight.
185120	186800	Hunger Games or Twilight at all.
186800	190600	And this is what we have today, which is what I like to call.
190600	191600	The movie poster.
191600	194840	Girl is going places.
194880	203120	She is going from point A to point B and, uh, she's alone and you can relate to her
203120	206240	also a lone girl.
206240	207480	So these are just some good examples.
207480	210720	So for instance, like this one uses a photograph.
210720	214400	If you do use a photograph, people.
214400	215400	Who are entering our contest.
215400	219480	People who are entering our contest, you absolutely have to own the copyright, whether you bought
219480	221240	it or licensed it from a friend.
221240	225120	If you use a photograph, that's fine, but you absolutely have to own the copyright.
225120	226120	That is a prerequisite.
226120	230280	You could also take photographs yourself, but that does not mean, uh, necessarily that
230280	231920	it has to be a photo.
231920	233200	It could be something like this.
233200	236960	Now, this is a lot like The Hunger Games really, because like in The Hunger Games, this is
236960	240800	like the little pendant that she gets and here, this is like, she gets a little tattoo,
240800	245120	which is like the symbol of her little Gryffindor that, uh, punches people.
245120	248200	Well, this is not necessarily YA, but it's sort of a lot.
248200	249200	This is chiclet.
249200	250200	Yeah.
250200	251200	This is a chiclet cover.
251200	256000	This is a lot like, you see a lot of YA right now because it's got like a lady doing, going
256000	257000	somewhere.
257000	258000	Yeah.
258000	259000	Without this, this, that's your something.
259000	260000	Yeah.
260000	261000	Well, I mean, Sarah's like, tentacles are gross.
261000	262000	I wouldn't put those on the cover.
262000	263000	Well, obviously.
263000	267120	If she doesn't think tentacles are gross because she wrote Twilight with Cthulhu, I think there's
267120	268120	something there.
268120	269120	Yeah.
269120	270120	She just doesn't want to admit it publicly.
270120	271120	Yeah.
271120	276440	No, I feel like I could totally see like some of these, uh, you know, really recent artsy
276440	280800	YA covers, maybe with like the silhouette of a really like.
281400	282400	It's the shadow box.
282400	283400	Yeah, the shadow box.
283400	284400	With the tentacles coming down.
284400	285400	But there's tentacles in there.
285400	286400	Yeah.
286400	287400	Mopey girls with no face.
287400	290200	That's super, super points.
290200	291200	Okay.
291200	295440	So in our little audition process, it's going to be very similar to what we did for the
295440	301360	Ghost Riders, but, uh, we do not want a finished polished work.
301360	302360	Yeah.
302360	303360	Don't waste your time.
303360	304360	Do not waste your time doing an entire thing.
304360	305360	Please.
305360	306360	We're not worth it.
306360	307360	Yeah.
307360	309160	So what we're going to do is we're going to ask for a proposal, which will come in the
309160	310760	form of a sketch.
310760	315320	We would also like the title to be on it and also Sarah's name.
315320	320160	So a sketch of what you think the book facing cover would look like.
320160	323800	And our book cover is five and a half by eight and a half.
323800	324800	Yeah.
324800	325800	So keep those proportions in mind.
325800	326800	Yeah.
326800	329600	It doesn't have to be perfect for your sketch, but you know, if that helps you.
329600	335020	Also provide a link to an online portfolio so we can see other examples of your work.
335020	337760	Also provide a tagline.
337760	339920	Bonus points for good taglines.
340080	341080	So a tagline.
341080	346200	This is Divergent, a very recent YA novel that's tagline is, one choice can transform
346200	347200	you.
347200	351400	You know, that comes straight off the back, which is part of their copy.
351400	356520	And on the back of our book will be our Goodreads copy, which if you go to Sarah's Goodreads
356520	361160	website, goodreads.com, Sarah Ellenson, you can read the description of her book has the
361160	362920	exact copy, which is going to be on the back of the book.
362920	368800	So if you want to pull something from there or something to do with love.
369800	370880	Dark.
370880	371880	Dark depths of love.
371880	372880	Depths.
372880	379200	Yeah, like our example tagline is like, even from the darkest depths, love may rise.
379200	383880	And in addition to these three things, sketch proposal, potential tagline, link to online
383880	386280	portfolio, nothing.
386280	387760	Please do not send us anything else.
387760	393880	No life stories, no witty anecdotes, no cover letter, no hi, how are you?
393880	395880	Just keep it to the basics.
395920	403760	So we want this a week from today, Monday, August 12th, by midnight, Monday night, Tuesday
403760	406640	early morning, Eastern Standard Daylight.
406640	409360	Because we are New York, center of the world.
409360	414680	And then on Tuesday, after we get everything, we're going to narrow it down to some finalists
414680	419520	and then we'll release another video sharing our finalists and then asking you, the viewer,
419520	425240	to help us decide from these finalists who our lucky hiree will be.
425600	426600	Yes, exactly.
426600	430960	And we will give you a hiree's commission fee like we did for our Ghostwriters.
430960	433680	And you will get credit on the back of the book, like you can see on Wendy's.
433680	434680	Unlike the Ghostwriters.
434680	437200	Cover art designed by you.
437200	440520	Yes, you can have your name on a terrible book.
440520	441520	Don't you want it?
441520	442520	You can put it on your resume.
442520	443520	It's an awesome book.
443520	444520	I mean, it's a great book.
444520	445520	It's a great book.
445520	446520	It's so romantic.
446520	447520	Where's mine?
447520	451480	After we've narrowed down our finalists, we will choose a winner and then that winner
451480	455160	will have one week to give us the finished product.
456080	459400	And then a week-ish from that day is our book launch.
459400	463120	Book launch, which is going to be Friday, August 30th.
463120	464120	Labor Day weekend.
464120	470240	And we are going to have a party, probably, at a bookstore, probably, locally here in
470240	478200	New York City, probably, probably, a book launch party, which you are all invited to
478200	484240	and Sarah will be there in picture and you can get your book signed by Sarah and everything.
484320	487880	So yeah, there's going to be a book launch party on Friday, August 30th and that will
487880	494680	also be when it becomes available on Amazon and on all the e-sites that are affiliated
494680	496400	with that because we're going to do the wide release.
496400	499200	And it will be available, yes, to you people who do not live in America.
499200	503960	You will be able to order it to have it shipped to you, so you can order it from Amazon in
503960	505760	print or in e-book.
505760	508760	Yeah, so if you want the e-book version, we got that.
508760	513360	If you want a non-Kindle version, you convert it like I do.
514360	515600	And yeah, it's really easy.
515600	517800	We will provide information on that later.
517800	521840	And also, if you want a hard copy, we got that too.
521840	523400	Thank you, Amazon.
523400	528560	And thank you very much to my unnamed friends at certain literary agencies that gave me
528560	533360	advice on self-publishing in the modern era and how you can make it work best for you,
533360	537060	which we will talk about on a later episode.
537060	543420	And of course, if you have happened to come across a copy of Awoken, please leave a review
543420	544420	on Goodreads.
544420	547300	Otherwise, add it to your to-read list.
547300	553260	And we look forward to your submissions and to talking about them next week.
553260	559660	And everybody else, without artistic inclination, please tune in and help us decide who our
559660	560660	cover will be.
560660	562660	You'll be able to judge people.
562660	563660	It'll be fun.
567060	568060	Bye.
568060	569060	Bye.
569060	569560	Bye.
