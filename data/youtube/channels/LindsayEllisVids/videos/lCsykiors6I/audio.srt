1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
All right, hey!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ah, we're girly!

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We're girly!

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We drink mimosas!

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yeah, that's right, we're wearing shorts.

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And shitboard glasses.

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:17,880
Hey, that's, that's what champagne is supposed to be served in, it's like these 1920s style

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,080
glasses that we totally didn't drink margaritas out of last week.

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,360
I was 10.

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,680
How did you find Conbravo?

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,160
It was great!

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,440
So many people wanted to hear about sexy Cthulhu.

13
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:35,080
Yeah, and so many people were kind of, uh, bewildered, I guess?

14
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,440
Um, so, oh, it's Twilight with Cthulhu.

15
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,480
They would either run screaming or be like, shit, I have to read that!

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,120
Yeah, there was a lot of, like, I gotta buy this out of morbid curiosity.

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,960
So if you happen to, um, you know, get one of these things, and if you had the time to

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,240
read it, go on to Goodreads and leave Sarah a review.

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,720
She will really appreciate it.

20
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,720
She really, like, desperately needs validation, and if you're a hater, that's okay.

21
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,800
She needs validation from you too, attention is attention.

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,160
So we had this little temporary version that we printed off specifically for Conbravo and

23
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,160
for this bookstore launch.

24
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,720
Yeah, we made it small and cheap and we just got it out there real quick.

25
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,400
But, uh, now we need to start thinking about the for real launch since we're doing it the

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,880
old fashioned way where we have to, like, build buzz and, uh.

27
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,720
Yeah, I mean, that's the way the publishing industry is now.

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,840
Even if you get picked up by a real agent and a real publisher, they still expect you

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,880
to do a lot of your own marketing.

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,360
And it ends up just taking, like, half the length of time.

31
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,320
The publishing is just, like, the pre-release buzz business and it just takes so freaking

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,320
long.

33
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,480
Like, two years, so we're thinking more like.

34
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,480
A month.

35
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
A month.

36
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,480
Yeah, a month.

37
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
Cause, cause.

38
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
From now.

39
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,480
Yeah, from now.

40
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,480
Cause we're impatient and we know that you're probably going to forget about it if we wait

41
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
too much longer.

42
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
Strike the iron while it's hot.

43
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,760
Yeah, but we're going to try and do, like, all the stuff that you're supposed to do in,

44
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,280
uh, like, you know, six to nine months in, uh, one.

45
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,400
So that means we need a cover.

46
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Like a real one.

47
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:17,400
A real one is a cover that is the trope-iest of, you know, clichÃ©-ist of what is young

48
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,920
adult today.

49
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,920
Or yesterday.

50
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
Or what people think about.

51
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,920
Yeah.

52
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,360
What do we got?

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,360
What's we got?

54
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,360
Okay, so here's some examples.

55
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,080
You've got the typical simple object on black.

56
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,280
That's, that's your, your twilight and everything there derived.

57
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,240
You've got your simple object, but boys will like this too.

58
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,040
This is actually, like, this is, I think, is why, uh, The Hunger Games is so brilliant

59
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,400
is because it's so gender neutral.

60
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,240
This is still three years, four years old.

61
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,240
No, this is way older.

62
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,320
Yeah, so that's old.

63
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,320
So here is.

64
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
But that doesn't, like, it's okay.

65
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,320
Cause people are still.

66
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
This is 2008, so this is five years old.

67
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,240
Yeah, but this is what's, what that's turned into.

68
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,520
Like, you can see the influence of The Hunger Games and the twilight.

69
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,840
This is two-ish.

70
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,120
This one's two years old, which totally isn't ripping off.

71
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,120
Hunger Games or Twilight.

72
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,800
Hunger Games or Twilight at all.

73
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,600
And this is what we have today, which is what I like to call.

74
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
The movie poster.

75
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,840
Girl is going places.

76
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:23,120
She is going from point A to point B and, uh, she's alone and you can relate to her

77
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,240
also a lone girl.

78
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,480
So these are just some good examples.

79
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,720
So for instance, like this one uses a photograph.

80
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,400
If you do use a photograph, people.

81
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Who are entering our contest.

82
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,480
People who are entering our contest, you absolutely have to own the copyright, whether you bought

83
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,240
it or licensed it from a friend.

84
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,120
If you use a photograph, that's fine, but you absolutely have to own the copyright.

85
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,120
That is a prerequisite.

86
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,280
You could also take photographs yourself, but that does not mean, uh, necessarily that

87
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,920
it has to be a photo.

88
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,200
It could be something like this.

89
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,960
Now, this is a lot like The Hunger Games really, because like in The Hunger Games, this is

90
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,800
like the little pendant that she gets and here, this is like, she gets a little tattoo,

91
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,120
which is like the symbol of her little Gryffindor that, uh, punches people.

92
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,200
Well, this is not necessarily YA, but it's sort of a lot.

93
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,200
This is chiclet.

94
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Yeah.

95
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
This is a chiclet cover.

96
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,000
This is a lot like, you see a lot of YA right now because it's got like a lady doing, going

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
somewhere.

98
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah.

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Without this, this, that's your something.

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah.

101
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Well, I mean, Sarah's like, tentacles are gross.

102
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I wouldn't put those on the cover.

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Well, obviously.

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,120
If she doesn't think tentacles are gross because she wrote Twilight with Cthulhu, I think there's

105
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,120
something there.

106
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
Yeah.

107
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
She just doesn't want to admit it publicly.

108
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
Yeah.

109
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,440
No, I feel like I could totally see like some of these, uh, you know, really recent artsy

110
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,800
YA covers, maybe with like the silhouette of a really like.

111
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,400
It's the shadow box.

112
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,400
Yeah, the shadow box.

113
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,400
With the tentacles coming down.

114
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,400
But there's tentacles in there.

115
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
Yeah.

116
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,400
Mopey girls with no face.

117
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,200
That's super, super points.

118
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Okay.

119
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,440
So in our little audition process, it's going to be very similar to what we did for the

120
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,360
Ghost Riders, but, uh, we do not want a finished polished work.

121
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
Yeah.

122
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Don't waste your time.

123
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Do not waste your time doing an entire thing.

124
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
Please.

125
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
We're not worth it.

126
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
Yeah.

127
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,160
So what we're going to do is we're going to ask for a proposal, which will come in the

128
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,760
form of a sketch.

129
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,320
We would also like the title to be on it and also Sarah's name.

130
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,160
So a sketch of what you think the book facing cover would look like.

131
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,800
And our book cover is five and a half by eight and a half.

132
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Yeah.

133
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
So keep those proportions in mind.

134
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Yeah.

135
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,600
It doesn't have to be perfect for your sketch, but you know, if that helps you.

136
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,020
Also provide a link to an online portfolio so we can see other examples of your work.

137
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,760
Also provide a tagline.

138
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,920
Bonus points for good taglines.

139
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
So a tagline.

140
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,200
This is Divergent, a very recent YA novel that's tagline is, one choice can transform

141
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
you.

142
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,400
You know, that comes straight off the back, which is part of their copy.

143
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,520
And on the back of our book will be our Goodreads copy, which if you go to Sarah's Goodreads

144
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,160
website, goodreads.com, Sarah Ellenson, you can read the description of her book has the

145
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,920
exact copy, which is going to be on the back of the book.

146
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,800
So if you want to pull something from there or something to do with love.

147
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,880
Dark.

148
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
Dark depths of love.

149
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
Depths.

150
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,200
Yeah, like our example tagline is like, even from the darkest depths, love may rise.

151
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,880
And in addition to these three things, sketch proposal, potential tagline, link to online

152
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,280
portfolio, nothing.

153
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,760
Please do not send us anything else.

154
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:33,880
No life stories, no witty anecdotes, no cover letter, no hi, how are you?

155
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,880
Just keep it to the basics.

156
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:43,760
So we want this a week from today, Monday, August 12th, by midnight, Monday night, Tuesday

157
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,640
early morning, Eastern Standard Daylight.

158
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,360
Because we are New York, center of the world.

159
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,680
And then on Tuesday, after we get everything, we're going to narrow it down to some finalists

160
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,520
and then we'll release another video sharing our finalists and then asking you, the viewer,

161
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,240
to help us decide from these finalists who our lucky hiree will be.

162
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
Yes, exactly.

163
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,960
And we will give you a hiree's commission fee like we did for our Ghostwriters.

164
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,680
And you will get credit on the back of the book, like you can see on Wendy's.

165
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,680
Unlike the Ghostwriters.

166
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,200
Cover art designed by you.

167
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,520
Yes, you can have your name on a terrible book.

168
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,520
Don't you want it?

169
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,520
You can put it on your resume.

170
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,520
It's an awesome book.

171
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
I mean, it's a great book.

172
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
It's a great book.

173
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,520
It's so romantic.

174
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
Where's mine?

175
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,480
After we've narrowed down our finalists, we will choose a winner and then that winner

176
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,160
will have one week to give us the finished product.

177
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,400
And then a week-ish from that day is our book launch.

178
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,120
Book launch, which is going to be Friday, August 30th.

179
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
Labor Day weekend.

180
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,240
And we are going to have a party, probably, at a bookstore, probably, locally here in

181
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:58,200
New York City, probably, probably, a book launch party, which you are all invited to

182
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:04,240
and Sarah will be there in picture and you can get your book signed by Sarah and everything.

183
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,880
So yeah, there's going to be a book launch party on Friday, August 30th and that will

184
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:14,680
also be when it becomes available on Amazon and on all the e-sites that are affiliated

185
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,400
with that because we're going to do the wide release.

186
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,200
And it will be available, yes, to you people who do not live in America.

187
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,960
You will be able to order it to have it shipped to you, so you can order it from Amazon in

188
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,760
print or in e-book.

189
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,760
Yeah, so if you want the e-book version, we got that.

190
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,360
If you want a non-Kindle version, you convert it like I do.

191
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,600
And yeah, it's really easy.

192
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,800
We will provide information on that later.

193
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,840
And also, if you want a hard copy, we got that too.

194
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,400
Thank you, Amazon.

195
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,560
And thank you very much to my unnamed friends at certain literary agencies that gave me

196
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,360
advice on self-publishing in the modern era and how you can make it work best for you,

197
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,060
which we will talk about on a later episode.

198
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:03,420
And of course, if you have happened to come across a copy of Awoken, please leave a review

199
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,420
on Goodreads.

200
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,300
Otherwise, add it to your to-read list.

201
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:13,260
And we look forward to your submissions and to talking about them next week.

202
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:19,660
And everybody else, without artistic inclination, please tune in and help us decide who our

203
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,660
cover will be.

204
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,660
You'll be able to judge people.

205
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,660
It'll be fun.

206
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,060
Bye.

207
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,060
Bye.

208
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,560
Bye.
