WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
All right, hey!

00:01.000 --> 00:02.000
Ah, we're girly!

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
We're girly!

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
We drink mimosas!

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
Yeah, that's right, we're wearing shorts.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
And shitboard glasses.

00:06.000 --> 00:17.880
Hey, that's, that's what champagne is supposed to be served in, it's like these 1920s style

00:17.880 --> 00:21.080
glasses that we totally didn't drink margaritas out of last week.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.360
I was 10.

00:22.360 --> 00:23.680
How did you find Conbravo?

00:23.680 --> 00:25.160
It was great!

00:25.160 --> 00:28.440
So many people wanted to hear about sexy Cthulhu.

00:28.440 --> 00:35.080
Yeah, and so many people were kind of, uh, bewildered, I guess?

00:35.080 --> 00:38.440
Um, so, oh, it's Twilight with Cthulhu.

00:38.440 --> 00:41.480
They would either run screaming or be like, shit, I have to read that!

00:41.480 --> 00:45.120
Yeah, there was a lot of, like, I gotta buy this out of morbid curiosity.

00:45.120 --> 00:50.960
So if you happen to, um, you know, get one of these things, and if you had the time to

00:50.960 --> 00:55.240
read it, go on to Goodreads and leave Sarah a review.

00:55.240 --> 00:56.720
She will really appreciate it.

00:56.720 --> 01:01.720
She really, like, desperately needs validation, and if you're a hater, that's okay.

01:01.720 --> 01:04.800
She needs validation from you too, attention is attention.

01:04.800 --> 01:09.160
So we had this little temporary version that we printed off specifically for Conbravo and

01:09.160 --> 01:10.160
for this bookstore launch.

01:10.160 --> 01:14.720
Yeah, we made it small and cheap and we just got it out there real quick.

01:14.720 --> 01:20.400
But, uh, now we need to start thinking about the for real launch since we're doing it the

01:20.400 --> 01:24.880
old fashioned way where we have to, like, build buzz and, uh.

01:25.040 --> 01:27.720
Yeah, I mean, that's the way the publishing industry is now.

01:27.720 --> 01:30.840
Even if you get picked up by a real agent and a real publisher, they still expect you

01:30.840 --> 01:32.880
to do a lot of your own marketing.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.360
And it ends up just taking, like, half the length of time.

01:35.360 --> 01:40.320
The publishing is just, like, the pre-release buzz business and it just takes so freaking

01:40.320 --> 01:41.320
long.

01:41.320 --> 01:43.480
Like, two years, so we're thinking more like.

01:43.480 --> 01:44.480
A month.

01:44.480 --> 01:45.480
A month.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.480
Yeah, a month.

01:46.480 --> 01:47.480
Cause, cause.

01:47.480 --> 01:48.480
From now.

01:48.480 --> 01:49.480
Yeah, from now.

01:49.480 --> 01:50.480
Cause we're impatient and we know that you're probably going to forget about it if we wait

01:50.480 --> 01:51.480
too much longer.

01:51.480 --> 01:52.480
Strike the iron while it's hot.

01:53.080 --> 01:56.760
Yeah, but we're going to try and do, like, all the stuff that you're supposed to do in,

01:56.760 --> 02:01.280
uh, like, you know, six to nine months in, uh, one.

02:01.280 --> 02:04.400
So that means we need a cover.

02:04.400 --> 02:05.400
Like a real one.

02:05.400 --> 02:17.400
A real one is a cover that is the trope-iest of, you know, clichÃ©-ist of what is young

02:17.400 --> 02:18.920
adult today.

02:18.920 --> 02:19.920
Or yesterday.

02:19.920 --> 02:20.920
Or what people think about.

02:20.920 --> 02:21.920
Yeah.

02:22.360 --> 02:23.360
What do we got?

02:23.360 --> 02:24.360
What's we got?

02:24.360 --> 02:25.360
Okay, so here's some examples.

02:25.360 --> 02:27.080
You've got the typical simple object on black.

02:27.080 --> 02:31.280
That's, that's your, your twilight and everything there derived.

02:31.280 --> 02:36.240
You've got your simple object, but boys will like this too.

02:36.240 --> 02:41.040
This is actually, like, this is, I think, is why, uh, The Hunger Games is so brilliant

02:41.040 --> 02:43.400
is because it's so gender neutral.

02:43.400 --> 02:46.240
This is still three years, four years old.

02:46.240 --> 02:47.240
No, this is way older.

02:47.240 --> 02:48.320
Yeah, so that's old.

02:48.320 --> 02:49.320
So here is.

02:49.320 --> 02:50.320
But that doesn't, like, it's okay.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.320
Cause people are still.

02:51.720 --> 02:52.720
This is 2008, so this is five years old.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.240
Yeah, but this is what's, what that's turned into.

02:55.240 --> 02:59.520
Like, you can see the influence of The Hunger Games and the twilight.

02:59.520 --> 03:00.840
This is two-ish.

03:00.840 --> 03:04.120
This one's two years old, which totally isn't ripping off.

03:04.120 --> 03:05.120
Hunger Games or Twilight.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.800
Hunger Games or Twilight at all.

03:06.800 --> 03:10.600
And this is what we have today, which is what I like to call.

03:10.600 --> 03:11.600
The movie poster.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.840
Girl is going places.

03:14.880 --> 03:23.120
She is going from point A to point B and, uh, she's alone and you can relate to her

03:23.120 --> 03:26.240
also a lone girl.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.480
So these are just some good examples.

03:27.480 --> 03:30.720
So for instance, like this one uses a photograph.

03:30.720 --> 03:34.400
If you do use a photograph, people.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.400
Who are entering our contest.

03:35.400 --> 03:39.480
People who are entering our contest, you absolutely have to own the copyright, whether you bought

03:39.480 --> 03:41.240
it or licensed it from a friend.

03:41.240 --> 03:45.120
If you use a photograph, that's fine, but you absolutely have to own the copyright.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.120
That is a prerequisite.

03:46.120 --> 03:50.280
You could also take photographs yourself, but that does not mean, uh, necessarily that

03:50.280 --> 03:51.920
it has to be a photo.

03:51.920 --> 03:53.200
It could be something like this.

03:53.200 --> 03:56.960
Now, this is a lot like The Hunger Games really, because like in The Hunger Games, this is

03:56.960 --> 04:00.800
like the little pendant that she gets and here, this is like, she gets a little tattoo,

04:00.800 --> 04:05.120
which is like the symbol of her little Gryffindor that, uh, punches people.

04:05.120 --> 04:08.200
Well, this is not necessarily YA, but it's sort of a lot.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.200
This is chiclet.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.200
Yeah.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.200
This is a chiclet cover.

04:11.200 --> 04:16.000
This is a lot like, you see a lot of YA right now because it's got like a lady doing, going

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
somewhere.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Yeah.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Without this, this, that's your something.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Yeah.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Well, I mean, Sarah's like, tentacles are gross.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
I wouldn't put those on the cover.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Well, obviously.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.120
If she doesn't think tentacles are gross because she wrote Twilight with Cthulhu, I think there's

04:27.120 --> 04:28.120
something there.

04:28.120 --> 04:29.120
Yeah.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.120
She just doesn't want to admit it publicly.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.120
Yeah.

04:31.120 --> 04:36.440
No, I feel like I could totally see like some of these, uh, you know, really recent artsy

04:36.440 --> 04:40.800
YA covers, maybe with like the silhouette of a really like.

04:41.400 --> 04:42.400
It's the shadow box.

04:42.400 --> 04:43.400
Yeah, the shadow box.

04:43.400 --> 04:44.400
With the tentacles coming down.

04:44.400 --> 04:45.400
But there's tentacles in there.

04:45.400 --> 04:46.400
Yeah.

04:46.400 --> 04:47.400
Mopey girls with no face.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.200
That's super, super points.

04:50.200 --> 04:51.200
Okay.

04:51.200 --> 04:55.440
So in our little audition process, it's going to be very similar to what we did for the

04:55.440 --> 05:01.360
Ghost Riders, but, uh, we do not want a finished polished work.

05:01.360 --> 05:02.360
Yeah.

05:02.360 --> 05:03.360
Don't waste your time.

05:03.360 --> 05:04.360
Do not waste your time doing an entire thing.

05:04.360 --> 05:05.360
Please.

05:05.360 --> 05:06.360
We're not worth it.

05:06.360 --> 05:07.360
Yeah.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.160
So what we're going to do is we're going to ask for a proposal, which will come in the

05:09.160 --> 05:10.760
form of a sketch.

05:10.760 --> 05:15.320
We would also like the title to be on it and also Sarah's name.

05:15.320 --> 05:20.160
So a sketch of what you think the book facing cover would look like.

05:20.160 --> 05:23.800
And our book cover is five and a half by eight and a half.

05:23.800 --> 05:24.800
Yeah.

05:24.800 --> 05:25.800
So keep those proportions in mind.

05:25.800 --> 05:26.800
Yeah.

05:26.800 --> 05:29.600
It doesn't have to be perfect for your sketch, but you know, if that helps you.

05:29.600 --> 05:35.020
Also provide a link to an online portfolio so we can see other examples of your work.

05:35.020 --> 05:37.760
Also provide a tagline.

05:37.760 --> 05:39.920
Bonus points for good taglines.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.080
So a tagline.

05:41.080 --> 05:46.200
This is Divergent, a very recent YA novel that's tagline is, one choice can transform

05:46.200 --> 05:47.200
you.

05:47.200 --> 05:51.400
You know, that comes straight off the back, which is part of their copy.

05:51.400 --> 05:56.520
And on the back of our book will be our Goodreads copy, which if you go to Sarah's Goodreads

05:56.520 --> 06:01.160
website, goodreads.com, Sarah Ellenson, you can read the description of her book has the

06:01.160 --> 06:02.920
exact copy, which is going to be on the back of the book.

06:02.920 --> 06:08.800
So if you want to pull something from there or something to do with love.

06:09.800 --> 06:10.880
Dark.

06:10.880 --> 06:11.880
Dark depths of love.

06:11.880 --> 06:12.880
Depths.

06:12.880 --> 06:19.200
Yeah, like our example tagline is like, even from the darkest depths, love may rise.

06:19.200 --> 06:23.880
And in addition to these three things, sketch proposal, potential tagline, link to online

06:23.880 --> 06:26.280
portfolio, nothing.

06:26.280 --> 06:27.760
Please do not send us anything else.

06:27.760 --> 06:33.880
No life stories, no witty anecdotes, no cover letter, no hi, how are you?

06:33.880 --> 06:35.880
Just keep it to the basics.

06:35.920 --> 06:43.760
So we want this a week from today, Monday, August 12th, by midnight, Monday night, Tuesday

06:43.760 --> 06:46.640
early morning, Eastern Standard Daylight.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.360
Because we are New York, center of the world.

06:49.360 --> 06:54.680
And then on Tuesday, after we get everything, we're going to narrow it down to some finalists

06:54.680 --> 06:59.520
and then we'll release another video sharing our finalists and then asking you, the viewer,

06:59.520 --> 07:05.240
to help us decide from these finalists who our lucky hiree will be.

07:05.600 --> 07:06.600
Yes, exactly.

07:06.600 --> 07:10.960
And we will give you a hiree's commission fee like we did for our Ghostwriters.

07:10.960 --> 07:13.680
And you will get credit on the back of the book, like you can see on Wendy's.

07:13.680 --> 07:14.680
Unlike the Ghostwriters.

07:14.680 --> 07:17.200
Cover art designed by you.

07:17.200 --> 07:20.520
Yes, you can have your name on a terrible book.

07:20.520 --> 07:21.520
Don't you want it?

07:21.520 --> 07:22.520
You can put it on your resume.

07:22.520 --> 07:23.520
It's an awesome book.

07:23.520 --> 07:24.520
I mean, it's a great book.

07:24.520 --> 07:25.520
It's a great book.

07:25.520 --> 07:26.520
It's so romantic.

07:26.520 --> 07:27.520
Where's mine?

07:27.520 --> 07:31.480
After we've narrowed down our finalists, we will choose a winner and then that winner

07:31.480 --> 07:35.160
will have one week to give us the finished product.

07:36.080 --> 07:39.400
And then a week-ish from that day is our book launch.

07:39.400 --> 07:43.120
Book launch, which is going to be Friday, August 30th.

07:43.120 --> 07:44.120
Labor Day weekend.

07:44.120 --> 07:50.240
And we are going to have a party, probably, at a bookstore, probably, locally here in

07:50.240 --> 07:58.200
New York City, probably, probably, a book launch party, which you are all invited to

07:58.200 --> 08:04.240
and Sarah will be there in picture and you can get your book signed by Sarah and everything.

08:04.320 --> 08:07.880
So yeah, there's going to be a book launch party on Friday, August 30th and that will

08:07.880 --> 08:14.680
also be when it becomes available on Amazon and on all the e-sites that are affiliated

08:14.680 --> 08:16.400
with that because we're going to do the wide release.

08:16.400 --> 08:19.200
And it will be available, yes, to you people who do not live in America.

08:19.200 --> 08:23.960
You will be able to order it to have it shipped to you, so you can order it from Amazon in

08:23.960 --> 08:25.760
print or in e-book.

08:25.760 --> 08:28.760
Yeah, so if you want the e-book version, we got that.

08:28.760 --> 08:33.360
If you want a non-Kindle version, you convert it like I do.

08:34.360 --> 08:35.600
And yeah, it's really easy.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.800
We will provide information on that later.

08:37.800 --> 08:41.840
And also, if you want a hard copy, we got that too.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.400
Thank you, Amazon.

08:43.400 --> 08:48.560
And thank you very much to my unnamed friends at certain literary agencies that gave me

08:48.560 --> 08:53.360
advice on self-publishing in the modern era and how you can make it work best for you,

08:53.360 --> 08:57.060
which we will talk about on a later episode.

08:57.060 --> 09:03.420
And of course, if you have happened to come across a copy of Awoken, please leave a review

09:03.420 --> 09:04.420
on Goodreads.

09:04.420 --> 09:07.300
Otherwise, add it to your to-read list.

09:07.300 --> 09:13.260
And we look forward to your submissions and to talking about them next week.

09:13.260 --> 09:19.660
And everybody else, without artistic inclination, please tune in and help us decide who our

09:19.660 --> 09:20.660
cover will be.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.660
You'll be able to judge people.

09:22.660 --> 09:23.660
It'll be fun.

09:27.060 --> 09:28.060
Bye.

09:28.060 --> 09:29.060
Bye.

09:29.060 --> 09:29.560
Bye.
