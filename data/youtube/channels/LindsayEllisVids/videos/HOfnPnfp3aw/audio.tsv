0	12000	So today's Loose Canon features one of the oldest, most iteration-y franchise characters that didn't start in, like, a book, or as an archetype, or as a folk character, but from the movies.
12000	20000	King Kong is utterly of cinema, and while, yeah, there are plenty of non-movie versions,
20000	27000	there's a lot to take about how film form has changed over the years just by looking at the different versions of King Kong.
27000	34000	Like, which symbol of man's hubris are we climbing today? Or, why is man the real monster this time?
34000	40000	Or the racism that never really seems to be handled better with each different incarnation.
40000	48000	Anyway, given that this is also a character that tends not to get much in the way of, you know, dialogue or any dialogue,
48000	53000	Kong is less a deep, nuanced character that changes a lot from version to version, so much as a concept.
53000	60000	If a theme can be a character, it's King Kong, and with it, his interactions with the kidnapped ladyfolk.
65000	67000	That aspect tends not to change too much.
67000	75000	Even though Kong is supposed to be the monster of the piece, he's also the thing people remember, and like, and even kind of sympathize with.
75000	83000	He's very similar to Godzilla in that way, and yes, we may look at Godzilla another day, maybe, maybe,
83000	86000	in that the audience can't help but sympathize with the monster.
86000	90000	Kong is usually an antagonist, but he's never the villain.
90000	95000	So, while there are a bunch of versions of King Kong that are not movies,
95000	99000	I'm going to stick just to movie versions for this particular episode,
99000	104000	because the legacy of Kong is so much of popular cinema, and not just American cinema.
104000	110000	So, climb up your favorite monument to man's hubris and cuddle up with your favorite helpless kidnappee
110000	115000	as we take a look at the history of King Kong.
122000	125000	Did you ever hear of Kong?
126000	130000	Gorillas are kind of the symbol of virility,
130000	137000	which is funny because they have the smallest nards and lowest sex drives of all of the great apes, including us.
137000	138000	Reason.
138000	145000	But you know what? Whatever. It's a symbol of raw animal virility, not an actual, you know, one-to-one thing.
145000	147000	Well, anyway, neither beast nor man.
147000	151000	But this is relevant because the neither beast nor man aspect of King Kong
151000	155000	tends to be sexualized when he's not actively appealing to children.
155000	158000	And sometimes when he is. We'll get to that.
158000	165000	King Kong was born of the Lost World genre of literature, popularized by the likes of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
165000	172000	Basically, now that it's the 20th century and Europe and America have colonized all of Africa and half of Asia,
172000	176000	those parts of the world aren't so mysterious and scary anymore,
176000	180000	so the West is like, hey, let's make up new ones.
180000	184000	Director Marion C. Cooper lived for the whole safari and exotic places thing,
184000	188000	and King Kong was the brainchild inspired by his real-life adventures.
188000	193000	Not to mention some excitement about the Empire State Building, which had only recently finished being constructed.
193000	199000	In terms of the film itself, Carl Denham is basically Cooper's self-insert character.
199000	202000	King Kong is a simple movie, and a short movie.
202000	206000	A film crew goes to an island to film a fantastic, mysterious thing,
206000	208000	and halfway through they find the monster,
208000	212000	and the monster becomes immediately smitten with the first white woman he ever sees.
212000	214000	Yeah, blondes are scarce around here.
214000	217000	The movie even sets up, like, a lady exchange rate.
217000	220000	He's offering to trade six of his women for Anne.
220000	223000	So six women of color on the Anne dollar today.
223000	229000	Also, King Kong came out at this perfect time of when America was getting, like, really obsessed with monkeys,
229000	233000	and that lasted for a while, like decades.
233000	236000	This movie doesn't spend much time with Anne Darrow and King Kong.
236000	239000	It's mostly just the adventures of the guys trying to get her back.
239000	243000	Anne doesn't really even so much as pity Kong, but you know what?
243000	245000	He doesn't really seem to care what she thinks.
245000	250000	There is actually one point where he starts stripping off her clothes and tickling her.
255000	258000	And that's kind of an odd juxtaposition when they get back to New York,
258000	264000	which are just really kind of blase about engaging in Carl's really, really, really bad idea to put Kong on stage.
264000	266000	So, you know, denim insisted.
266000	268000	Of course, we had to come when he said it would help the show.
268000	270000	I'll relive my trauma if you insist.
270000	275000	King Kong starts with this quote, which sets up our theme.
275000	280000	And I find that noteworthy because it's not an old Arabian proverb.
280000	283000	It's not an old anything proverb.
283000	285000	Cooper made it up.
285000	289000	The Beauty and the Beast quote has this lofty, profound heft to it.
289000	291000	And yet it isn't even a real quote.
291000	297000	Like the legend of Kong within the context of the movie, we, the audience, take it for granted that, sure, that's a thing.
297000	300000	Kong is uncivilized masculinity, let's say.
300000	303000	Chaotic neutral, if you will.
303000	308000	And Beauty, in this case, belongs with lawful neutral.
308000	310000	Or a civilized white guy. Civilized-ish.
310000	311000	You know, he's a sailor.
311000	316000	Which leads us to the statement that I'm not sure even the filmmakers were conscious they were making.
316000	318000	It was Beauty who killed the Beast.
318000	321000	It's not Beauty that kills the Beast.
321000	323000	It's colonialism.
323000	325000	It's not that Kong wants Anne, and that's the problem.
325000	328000	I mean, Jack wants her too, and, you know, no problem there.
328000	330000	It's that Anne tames Kong.
330000	335000	And in the end, that deprives him of the self-preservation instinct that had been keeping him alive all this time.
336000	341000	And given that Kong is somewhat humanized in this version, and even sexualized to some extent,
341000	348000	there's always been this uncomfortable racial subtext to basically the entire King Kong series.
348000	352000	To quote an old Mel Brooksian proverb,
352000	355000	Hey, where are the white women at?
355000	358000	It sounds kind of silly, but I'm sorry for it.
358000	361000	So am I. But I've got a reason.
361000	366000	For our holy shit, let's hastily crap out a quick cash-in literally the very same year,
366000	368000	we have Son of Kong.
368000	373000	This one totally owns the concept of sympathetic monster Kong who's your buddy.
373000	374000	Aww.
374000	377000	And it's...
377000	380000	Well, at least it's short.
380000	387000	Screenwriter Ruth Rose basically copped to the eh, why bother nature of this movie's existence,
387000	395000	So this one is a lot goofier and less efforty and no symbols of man's hubris are climbed.
395000	397000	No Ann Darrow or Jack Driscoll here.
397000	401000	This one is about Denim and his flaccid white guilt.
401000	403000	This must be remorse or something.
403000	407000	You see, I'm the guy that knocked out your pop with her.
407000	410000	Once again, you know, Denim was always a bit of a self-insert Mary Sue,
410000	416000	so it's not the best sequel, but it's not like there's nothing interesting here.
416000	423000	At first, Carl is more torn up about the lawsuits than any, you know, horrors wrought or Kongs exploited.
423000	429000	He appears to view the whole King Kong thing in the last movie as something of an oopsie-daisy.
429000	431000	Kong sure was a hoodoo for me.
431000	435000	Carl meanders Skull Island words for a while, makes some friends,
435000	438000	and then 30 minutes into a movie that is only an hour long,
438000	441000	they decide to go back to Skull Island for reasons and boom.
441000	444000	Why never knew that old Kong had a son?
445000	449000	Well, you know what? Good, good. I'm glad you didn't know that.
449000	453000	And Denim and his new love interest are instantly sympathetic to little Kong.
453000	457000	Unlike Anne, she's not much with the screaming and isn't afraid of the little guy.
457000	459000	Well, you know, little.
459000	462000	Carl's got some white guilt, so he helps the little Kong out
462000	465000	and then pats himself on the back for doing the barest possible minimum.
465000	469000	I know it sounds funny, but instead of shooting him, I helped him out of a jam.
469000	472000	I felt I owed his family something.
472000	474000	And then suddenly, out of nowhere, the island sinks.
474000	476000	Sorry, natives.
476000	480000	The movie ends with baby Kong holding Denim above the water long enough to be rescued
480000	482000	and then baby Kong drowns.
482000	487000	It has a weirdly tragic ending for such a goofy little movie.
487000	490000	Because Denim learns the ways of his oopsie-daisy,
490000	496000	Son of Kong gives Denim and Englehorn the happy ending that they do not deserve.
496000	498000	Poor little Kong.
499000	502000	Kong family just can't catch a break.
507000	510000	In 1963, with the Godzilla franchise still going strong,
510000	514000	Toho figured, hey, what about this obvious team-up?
514000	518000	Let's contrive a reason for Godzilla and King Kong to fight.
518000	523000	In this one, a pharmaceutical company wants to boost the ratings of some TV show it's sponsoring.
523000	527000	So, let's go get a giant monster and put it on display,
527000	530000	because that usually works out really well.
530000	534000	But then things go wrong with that, and Godzilla just happens to pop by,
534000	538000	and our human characters do what they always do in these situations.
540000	545000	And appropriates some of the worst and most embarrassing of American cultural exports as well.
548000	551000	Yeah, so apparently blackface never really went away in Japan,
551000	555000	and the natives are in this a lot.
555000	558000	Since Kong is scaled up enough to be on par with Godzilla,
558000	564000	it does lead to some pretty interesting scale wonk when he gets around to kidnapping a woman.
564000	572000	And she seems to vary from roughly, like, ant-sized relative to Kong to the 40-foot woman.
572000	576000	Yeah, and him kidnapping this lady comes completely out of nowhere and goes nowhere.
576000	579000	He just does it because that's what he do.
579000	585000	And then she's saved and it's fine, and they make Kong go fight Godzilla for the last 20 minutes.
585000	590000	And at least they don't do it in a major city.
590000	591000	Ahem.
591000	594000	Kong appears to win, and then they let him go because...
598000	600000	Lesson learned from man's hubris?
600000	602000	It's just not worth the trouble.
603000	606000	King Kong Escapes was a Japanese-American co-production
606000	610000	loosely based on a Rankin and Bass animated series from a few years earlier.
610000	613000	In the animated series, Kong befriends a little boy.
613000	617000	This version loses that angle and Kong...
617000	621000	Oh, really? That's what we're going with?
621000	625000	This movie is mostly a setup to get Kong here to battle a Robocong
625000	629000	built by a mad scientist named, uh, Dr. Who.
629000	634000	No little boy in this version, but uh-oh, a blonde lady, and you know what that means.
634000	636000	I don't want to go with you!
636000	639000	This movie kind of marries the children-love-Kong thing
639000	643000	to the sexualized-he-wants-him-some-lovin' thing.
643000	648000	This was also made during the Godzilla-is-a-friend-of-the-children phase of that franchise,
648000	653000	so that definitely influences this Kong in what is one of his more confused portrayals.
653000	656000	Kong is a male, and Miss Watson is...
656000	659000	Well, see for yourselves, gentlemen.
659000	661000	Vagina equals laughing.
661000	665000	So some bland Americans and one Japanese dude go to Kong Island to study Kong,
665000	670000	but they don't get a chance to study him as Dr. Who kidnaps him and turns him into a hypno-Kong.
670000	675000	See, he built a robot-Kong to get element X, but then Robocong failed,
675000	680000	and Dr. Who decided to go for the real deal, and then they fight.
680000	683000	It's Robocong who does the climbing of Man-O-Man,
684000	687000	It's Robocong who does the climbing of Man's hubris in this one,
687000	690000	so I guess that metaphor kind of falls apart.
690000	693000	Kong just kind of follows him to get his lady friend back.
693000	697000	And although Kong is known for scaling various New York monuments,
697000	702000	it has to be said he has by this point scaled a fair portion of Tokyo as well.
707000	711000	Ah, the movie that nearly killed Jessica Lange's career in its crib
711000	714000	in the same way Star Trek nemesis nearly killed Tom Hardy's.
714000	717000	Yes, I will find a way to work him into anything.
717000	721000	A story that doesn't belong in the 70s any more than Captain America did.
721000	725000	Everything is wrong and nothing will ever be right again.
725000	728000	And I think I might love this version.
728000	732000	For you goddamn show-bitters, pig ape!
732000	737000	This might be the most clumsy update in the history of reboots.
737000	740000	Carl isn't a filmmaker, he's an oil man,
740000	744000	which is the most 70 things that ever 70s and makes no sense.
744000	747000	I promise you, you'll never get another booking in your life.
747000	750000	Said the oil CEO.
750000	753000	This group goes to Kong's island because drill, baby, drill,
753000	757000	but then oil CEO sees Kong and can drive some marketing-related reason to take him,
757000	762000	because it's the 70s and, you know, colonialism is kind of dying, and so...
762000	763000	this.
763000	766000	Even an environmental rapist like you, even you...
766000	767000	Oh, 70s.
767000	770000	Kong climbs not the recently-constructed Empire State Building,
770000	774000	but the recently-constructed Twin Towers, because 70s.
774000	777000	And that's the symbol of man's hubris du jour,
777000	780000	something-something oil, something-something stock market.
780000	781000	Fine.
781000	785000	But trying to sex this movie up is the most bewildering failure.
785000	788000	It's like a more boring Showgirls.
788000	793000	To make sure the allegorical sexuality isn't missed on even the most dents,
794000	799000	Kong has a stand-in who does a sexy dance before Anne's sacrifice.
799000	802000	It's an animal, a beast, that tried to rape you.
802000	804000	He risked his life to save me.
804000	806000	He tried to rape you, honey.
806000	809000	Ah, just what audiences wanted in their King Kong.
809000	812000	Thank you, movie. Thanks for that.
812000	815000	The movie clearly does not know how to update the gender thing,
815000	818000	because second-wave feminism might give them a frowny face,
818000	820000	so this will have to do.
820000	822000	You goddamn chauvinist pig ape!
822000	824000	Girl power?
824000	828000	Dwan is a narcissistic airhead because theme.
828000	832000	The movie ends with some dumb non-comment about celebrity or something.
832000	835000	Is this not what you want, actor lady?
835000	838000	Where the 05 remake loves the original maybe too much,
838000	841000	this version seems to hate it.
841000	844000	It doesn't shy away from the whole rape-of-the-natural-world subtext,
844000	847000	but it doesn't do anything with it either.
847000	850000	I can't decide if I love or hate this version.
850000	852000	On the one hand, it sucks.
852000	855000	On the other hand, it did give us one of the most, frankly,
855000	860000	wonder-terrible, awesonine additions to the entire Kong legacy.
872000	874000	Hot?
874000	876000	Moving on.
876000	878000	Only one thing can save Kong.
878000	880000	What's that?
880000	881000	A miracle.
881000	884000	King Kong Lives has the implied subtitle,
884000	886000	at the end of the last movie.
886000	890000	It even starts with footage from the end of the 76 version.
890000	893000	Linda Hamilton plays a doctor who is desperately, desperately
893000	896000	trying to save Kong's life for reasons?
896000	900000	To the point where they engineer this enormous, giant, artificial heart
900000	903000	to save his life because a huge fall equals...
903000	906000	the heart's the problem...
906000	908000	I don't know.
908000	911000	But then, out of the random, they find a lady Kong,
911000	914000	and some competing university takes her,
914000	917000	and captures her, and takes her back to the States
917000	919000	because that went so well the first time.
919000	921000	And it's like, yay!
921000	924000	We can get a blood transfusion for the dying Kong.
924000	927000	So, in this one, the man's hubris seems to be,
927000	931000	oh no, another institution of learning will have the only other giant ape,
931000	935000	and that's why man is the real monster.
937000	942000	Linda Hamilton does not get Konged in the tradition of her lady predecessors.
942000	945000	In fact, she doesn't seem to register to him at all.
945000	948000	Mostly it's about Kong and She-Kong.
948000	951000	A huge portion of this movie is just watching a couple of people in monkey suits
951000	953000	fuck around.
953000	957000	A lot of shots of people in monkey suits looking sad.
957000	961000	Somehow or other, they find time to gestate a baby Kong
961000	963000	in the runtime of the movie.
963000	966000	At the end of King Kong Lives, King Kong Dies.
966000	968000	Moving on.
968000	970000	Visiting hours are over, ma'am.
970000	972000	Permanently.
972000	975000	So before we get into this one, let's go back to that fake-ass proverb.
975000	977000	Note the difference.
977000	980000	And lo, the beast looked upon the face of beauty,
980000	983000	and beauty stayed his hand.
983000	988000	And from that day forward, he was his one death.
988000	990000	Nice thing about totally bogus proverbs,
990000	992000	you can just change them to fit your meaning.
992000	996000	In this case, it supports the premise that Ann Darrow is not a passive beauty
996000	1000000	that Kong reacts to, but an active agent that does things.
1000000	1002000	And in this case, befriends him.
1002000	1005000	This is the key difference between this version and the original.
1005000	1008000	That is not to say that it is superior, necessarily.
1008000	1011000	It is just noteworthy.
1011000	1015000	The cliche criticism of this movie is that it's too long.
1015000	1016000	You know, which it is.
1016000	1020000	But really, it's like, at two hours, it would have felt too long.
1020000	1022000	But at three hours, it almost feels too short.
1022000	1024000	Like all post-Lord of the Rings Jackson,
1024000	1029000	almost all of the bad comes from Jackson's inability to ever cut anything.
1029000	1031000	And yet, clearly a lot has been cut,
1031000	1035000	because there are so many dropped plot threads in this movie.
1035000	1037000	And so much that's just...
1037000	1039000	Why is this even here?
1039000	1041000	So much that the movie could have cut,
1041000	1043000	except for the scenes between Kong and Ann.
1043000	1045000	Those are great. Keep those.
1045000	1047000	Yes, even this one.
1048000	1050000	Whee!
1050000	1053000	Because there is so much love in this version.
1053000	1055000	It's kind of awkward, really.
1055000	1058000	Like, Jackson loves everything about the original.
1058000	1060000	He's remaking too much.
1060000	1062000	That's the thing you come to learn about, Kong.
1062000	1066000	His unfailing ability to destroy the things he loves.
1066000	1069000	It's both hyper-sincere and kind of meta.
1069000	1070000	Cooper, huh?
1072000	1073000	I might have known.
1073000	1076000	Jesus Christ, it's just so loving.
1076000	1079000	This movie is kind of worse, and better,
1079000	1082000	and also kind of worse than earlier versions.
1082000	1086000	For instance, at least it's not like the natives see Ann
1086000	1089000	and just inherently know white woman is superior,
1089000	1091000	that Ann screams,
1091000	1094000	and that's what makes the Kong happen.
1096000	1097000	And the natives are like,
1097000	1100000	oh, okay, that's what he wants, let's give him this woman.
1100000	1103000	That said, the natives kind of make me physically ill.
1103000	1106000	Like, at least in earlier versions, they were somewhat humanized,
1106000	1110000	and they are way more humanized and sympathetic in the 30s version.
1110000	1112000	Like, you see them dying, and you're like,
1112000	1116000	oh, humans, humans are sad and dying, they have babies.
1116000	1119000	Here they are so othered, they may as well be aliens.
1119000	1121000	But on the other hand, Kong,
1121000	1124000	who is mo-captain of this version by Andy Serkis,
1124000	1128000	got dehumaned and is much more overtly a gorilla.
1128000	1131000	Like, sure, like a smart gorilla with pathos,
1131000	1135000	but they dropped the sexualized neither beast nor man aspect.
1135000	1137000	He's just a big gorilla.
1138000	1140000	And I realize that Peej is a little boy,
1140000	1143000	but honestly, thank God.
1143000	1146000	Make a three-hour romp about a misunderstood lady
1146000	1148000	and her misunderstood gorilla friend,
1148000	1151000	and they're going wee on the ice in Central Park,
1151000	1155000	and it's weird, but at least you're never really worried
1155000	1159000	that Kong is going to, you know, get handsy.
1159000	1162000	In this version, Beauty is an active participant,
1162000	1164000	which, given that she's our protagonist this time,
1164000	1168000	like, indisputably, makes the film a lot more compelling.
1168000	1171000	That said, it also makes it a lot less tragic.
1171000	1173000	The thing about the original is that
1173000	1176000	Anne doesn't feel anything for Kong at the end.
1176000	1178000	And in the end, he's more interested in petting her
1178000	1180000	than defending himself.
1180000	1182000	And she feels nothing.
1182000	1184000	Who cares? Nobody. Certainly not Beauty.
1184000	1186000	But honestly, I still find this character arc for Anne
1186000	1188000	way more compelling since our lead character
1188000	1190000	gets to be something other than a ragdoll.
1190000	1192000	And watching a character dynamic grow and change
1192000	1195000	over the narrative is just more gratifying.
1195000	1197000	But I think for everyone's money,
1197000	1200000	maybe just seek out one of those two-ish hour fan cuts
1200000	1202000	instead of this one.
1205000	1207000	There are a couple of non-movie versions
1207000	1209000	that at least merit mention.
1209000	1213000	Did you know that there was, for instance, a musical?
1213000	1218000	Let the night surround you
1218000	1220000	It was limited to a run in Australia,
1220000	1222000	and although the music wasn't great,
1222000	1225000	and it's pretty easy to poo-poo on the mere idea
1225000	1227000	of a King Kong musical,
1227000	1230000	that animatronic is actually pretty badass.
1230000	1234000	And also next year, there is a new Netflix series
1234000	1236000	in the works, set in the future,
1236000	1239000	in which Kong must save humanity
1239000	1242000	from an army of robot dinosaurs.
1243000	1245000	I kind of wish I had known about that
1245000	1246000	when I chose this topic,
1246000	1248000	or I might have done this later.
1249000	1251000	Anyway, that's it for this episode.
1251000	1253000	You can support this show here,
1253000	1256000	and also that you can help me decide on themes
1256000	1258000	for what my next voting round will be.
1258000	1260000	In this case, I've been getting a lot of requests
1260000	1262000	for X-Men characters,
1262000	1263000	and you know what?
1263000	1264000	It's time to get hype,
1264000	1266000	because Apocalypse is coming out next year,
1266000	1269000	so here are three characters
1269000	1271000	that are slated to appear in that movie.
1271000	1273000	Pick the one that you want me to do.
1273000	1275000	Here is the URL where you can vote,
1275000	1277000	and it's also in the link below.
1277000	1279000	As always, thank you for watching,
1279000	1281000	and always ask permission
1281000	1283000	before foisting your lady friends
1283000	1287000	up any given symbol of man's hubris.
1288000	1290000	Because I'm sitting, sitting on top
1290000	1293000	Of the world, way on top
1293000	1299000	Rolling along, I'm rolling along
