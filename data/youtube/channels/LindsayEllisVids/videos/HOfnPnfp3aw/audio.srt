1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So today's Loose Canon features one of the oldest, most iteration-y franchise characters that didn't start in, like, a book, or as an archetype, or as a folk character, but from the movies.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
King Kong is utterly of cinema, and while, yeah, there are plenty of non-movie versions,

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
there's a lot to take about how film form has changed over the years just by looking at the different versions of King Kong.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Like, which symbol of man's hubris are we climbing today? Or, why is man the real monster this time?

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Or the racism that never really seems to be handled better with each different incarnation.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Anyway, given that this is also a character that tends not to get much in the way of, you know, dialogue or any dialogue,

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Kong is less a deep, nuanced character that changes a lot from version to version, so much as a concept.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If a theme can be a character, it's King Kong, and with it, his interactions with the kidnapped ladyfolk.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That aspect tends not to change too much.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Even though Kong is supposed to be the monster of the piece, he's also the thing people remember, and like, and even kind of sympathize with.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
He's very similar to Godzilla in that way, and yes, we may look at Godzilla another day, maybe, maybe,

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
in that the audience can't help but sympathize with the monster.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Kong is usually an antagonist, but he's never the villain.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So, while there are a bunch of versions of King Kong that are not movies,

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm going to stick just to movie versions for this particular episode,

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
because the legacy of Kong is so much of popular cinema, and not just American cinema.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So, climb up your favorite monument to man's hubris and cuddle up with your favorite helpless kidnappee

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
as we take a look at the history of King Kong.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Did you ever hear of Kong?

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Gorillas are kind of the symbol of virility,

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
which is funny because they have the smallest nards and lowest sex drives of all of the great apes, including us.

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Reason.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But you know what? Whatever. It's a symbol of raw animal virility, not an actual, you know, one-to-one thing.

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Well, anyway, neither beast nor man.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But this is relevant because the neither beast nor man aspect of King Kong

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
tends to be sexualized when he's not actively appealing to children.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And sometimes when he is. We'll get to that.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
King Kong was born of the Lost World genre of literature, popularized by the likes of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Basically, now that it's the 20th century and Europe and America have colonized all of Africa and half of Asia,

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
those parts of the world aren't so mysterious and scary anymore,

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
so the West is like, hey, let's make up new ones.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Director Marion C. Cooper lived for the whole safari and exotic places thing,

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and King Kong was the brainchild inspired by his real-life adventures.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Not to mention some excitement about the Empire State Building, which had only recently finished being constructed.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
In terms of the film itself, Carl Denham is basically Cooper's self-insert character.

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
King Kong is a simple movie, and a short movie.

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
A film crew goes to an island to film a fantastic, mysterious thing,

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and halfway through they find the monster,

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and the monster becomes immediately smitten with the first white woman he ever sees.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah, blondes are scarce around here.

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The movie even sets up, like, a lady exchange rate.

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He's offering to trade six of his women for Anne.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So six women of color on the Anne dollar today.

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Also, King Kong came out at this perfect time of when America was getting, like, really obsessed with monkeys,

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and that lasted for a while, like decades.

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This movie doesn't spend much time with Anne Darrow and King Kong.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's mostly just the adventures of the guys trying to get her back.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Anne doesn't really even so much as pity Kong, but you know what?

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He doesn't really seem to care what she thinks.

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
There is actually one point where he starts stripping off her clothes and tickling her.

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And that's kind of an odd juxtaposition when they get back to New York,

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
which are just really kind of blase about engaging in Carl's really, really, really bad idea to put Kong on stage.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So, you know, denim insisted.

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Of course, we had to come when he said it would help the show.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll relive my trauma if you insist.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
King Kong starts with this quote, which sets up our theme.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And I find that noteworthy because it's not an old Arabian proverb.

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's not an old anything proverb.

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Cooper made it up.

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The Beauty and the Beast quote has this lofty, profound heft to it.

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And yet it isn't even a real quote.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Like the legend of Kong within the context of the movie, we, the audience, take it for granted that, sure, that's a thing.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Kong is uncivilized masculinity, let's say.

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Chaotic neutral, if you will.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And Beauty, in this case, belongs with lawful neutral.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Or a civilized white guy. Civilized-ish.

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You know, he's a sailor.

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Which leads us to the statement that I'm not sure even the filmmakers were conscious they were making.

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It was Beauty who killed the Beast.

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's not Beauty that kills the Beast.

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's colonialism.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's not that Kong wants Anne, and that's the problem.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I mean, Jack wants her too, and, you know, no problem there.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's that Anne tames Kong.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And in the end, that deprives him of the self-preservation instinct that had been keeping him alive all this time.

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And given that Kong is somewhat humanized in this version, and even sexualized to some extent,

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
there's always been this uncomfortable racial subtext to basically the entire King Kong series.

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
To quote an old Mel Brooksian proverb,

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Hey, where are the white women at?

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It sounds kind of silly, but I'm sorry for it.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So am I. But I've got a reason.

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
For our holy shit, let's hastily crap out a quick cash-in literally the very same year,

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
we have Son of Kong.

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This one totally owns the concept of sympathetic monster Kong who's your buddy.

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Aww.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And it's...

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Well, at least it's short.

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Screenwriter Ruth Rose basically copped to the eh, why bother nature of this movie's existence,

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So this one is a lot goofier and less efforty and no symbols of man's hubris are climbed.

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
No Ann Darrow or Jack Driscoll here.

91
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
This one is about Denim and his flaccid white guilt.

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
This must be remorse or something.

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You see, I'm the guy that knocked out your pop with her.

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Once again, you know, Denim was always a bit of a self-insert Mary Sue,

95
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
so it's not the best sequel, but it's not like there's nothing interesting here.

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
At first, Carl is more torn up about the lawsuits than any, you know, horrors wrought or Kongs exploited.

97
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
He appears to view the whole King Kong thing in the last movie as something of an oopsie-daisy.

98
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Kong sure was a hoodoo for me.

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Carl meanders Skull Island words for a while, makes some friends,

100
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and then 30 minutes into a movie that is only an hour long,

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
they decide to go back to Skull Island for reasons and boom.

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Why never knew that old Kong had a son?

103
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Well, you know what? Good, good. I'm glad you didn't know that.

104
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And Denim and his new love interest are instantly sympathetic to little Kong.

105
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Unlike Anne, she's not much with the screaming and isn't afraid of the little guy.

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Well, you know, little.

107
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Carl's got some white guilt, so he helps the little Kong out

108
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and then pats himself on the back for doing the barest possible minimum.

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I know it sounds funny, but instead of shooting him, I helped him out of a jam.

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I felt I owed his family something.

111
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And then suddenly, out of nowhere, the island sinks.

112
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Sorry, natives.

113
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The movie ends with baby Kong holding Denim above the water long enough to be rescued

114
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and then baby Kong drowns.

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It has a weirdly tragic ending for such a goofy little movie.

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Because Denim learns the ways of his oopsie-daisy,

117
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Son of Kong gives Denim and Englehorn the happy ending that they do not deserve.

118
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Poor little Kong.

119
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Kong family just can't catch a break.

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
In 1963, with the Godzilla franchise still going strong,

121
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Toho figured, hey, what about this obvious team-up?

122
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Let's contrive a reason for Godzilla and King Kong to fight.

123
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
In this one, a pharmaceutical company wants to boost the ratings of some TV show it's sponsoring.

124
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So, let's go get a giant monster and put it on display,

125
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
because that usually works out really well.

126
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But then things go wrong with that, and Godzilla just happens to pop by,

127
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and our human characters do what they always do in these situations.

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And appropriates some of the worst and most embarrassing of American cultural exports as well.

129
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah, so apparently blackface never really went away in Japan,

130
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
and the natives are in this a lot.

131
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Since Kong is scaled up enough to be on par with Godzilla,

132
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
it does lead to some pretty interesting scale wonk when he gets around to kidnapping a woman.

133
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And she seems to vary from roughly, like, ant-sized relative to Kong to the 40-foot woman.

134
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah, and him kidnapping this lady comes completely out of nowhere and goes nowhere.

135
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
He just does it because that's what he do.

136
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And then she's saved and it's fine, and they make Kong go fight Godzilla for the last 20 minutes.

137
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And at least they don't do it in a major city.

138
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Ahem.

139
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Kong appears to win, and then they let him go because...

140
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Lesson learned from man's hubris?

141
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's just not worth the trouble.

142
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
King Kong Escapes was a Japanese-American co-production

143
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
loosely based on a Rankin and Bass animated series from a few years earlier.

144
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
In the animated series, Kong befriends a little boy.

145
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
This version loses that angle and Kong...

146
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Oh, really? That's what we're going with?

147
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
This movie is mostly a setup to get Kong here to battle a Robocong

148
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
built by a mad scientist named, uh, Dr. Who.

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No little boy in this version, but uh-oh, a blonde lady, and you know what that means.

150
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I don't want to go with you!

151
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
This movie kind of marries the children-love-Kong thing

152
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
to the sexualized-he-wants-him-some-lovin' thing.

153
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
This was also made during the Godzilla-is-a-friend-of-the-children phase of that franchise,

154
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
so that definitely influences this Kong in what is one of his more confused portrayals.

155
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Kong is a male, and Miss Watson is...

156
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Well, see for yourselves, gentlemen.

157
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Vagina equals laughing.

158
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So some bland Americans and one Japanese dude go to Kong Island to study Kong,

159
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
but they don't get a chance to study him as Dr. Who kidnaps him and turns him into a hypno-Kong.

160
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
See, he built a robot-Kong to get element X, but then Robocong failed,

161
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and Dr. Who decided to go for the real deal, and then they fight.

162
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's Robocong who does the climbing of Man-O-Man,

163
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's Robocong who does the climbing of Man's hubris in this one,

164
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
so I guess that metaphor kind of falls apart.

165
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Kong just kind of follows him to get his lady friend back.

166
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And although Kong is known for scaling various New York monuments,

167
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
it has to be said he has by this point scaled a fair portion of Tokyo as well.

168
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Ah, the movie that nearly killed Jessica Lange's career in its crib

169
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
in the same way Star Trek nemesis nearly killed Tom Hardy's.

170
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yes, I will find a way to work him into anything.

171
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
A story that doesn't belong in the 70s any more than Captain America did.

172
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Everything is wrong and nothing will ever be right again.

173
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And I think I might love this version.

174
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
For you goddamn show-bitters, pig ape!

175
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
This might be the most clumsy update in the history of reboots.

176
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Carl isn't a filmmaker, he's an oil man,

177
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
which is the most 70 things that ever 70s and makes no sense.

178
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I promise you, you'll never get another booking in your life.

179
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Said the oil CEO.

180
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
This group goes to Kong's island because drill, baby, drill,

181
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
but then oil CEO sees Kong and can drive some marketing-related reason to take him,

182
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
because it's the 70s and, you know, colonialism is kind of dying, and so...

183
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
this.

184
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Even an environmental rapist like you, even you...

185
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Oh, 70s.

186
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Kong climbs not the recently-constructed Empire State Building,

187
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
but the recently-constructed Twin Towers, because 70s.

188
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And that's the symbol of man's hubris du jour,

189
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
something-something oil, something-something stock market.

190
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Fine.

191
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But trying to sex this movie up is the most bewildering failure.

192
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's like a more boring Showgirls.

193
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
To make sure the allegorical sexuality isn't missed on even the most dents,

194
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Kong has a stand-in who does a sexy dance before Anne's sacrifice.

195
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's an animal, a beast, that tried to rape you.

196
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
He risked his life to save me.

197
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
He tried to rape you, honey.

198
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Ah, just what audiences wanted in their King Kong.

199
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Thank you, movie. Thanks for that.

200
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The movie clearly does not know how to update the gender thing,

201
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
because second-wave feminism might give them a frowny face,

202
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
so this will have to do.

203
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You goddamn chauvinist pig ape!

204
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Girl power?

205
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Dwan is a narcissistic airhead because theme.

206
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
The movie ends with some dumb non-comment about celebrity or something.

207
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Is this not what you want, actor lady?

208
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Where the 05 remake loves the original maybe too much,

209
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
this version seems to hate it.

210
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It doesn't shy away from the whole rape-of-the-natural-world subtext,

211
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
but it doesn't do anything with it either.

212
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I can't decide if I love or hate this version.

213
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
On the one hand, it sucks.

214
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
On the other hand, it did give us one of the most, frankly,

215
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
wonder-terrible, awesonine additions to the entire Kong legacy.

216
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Hot?

217
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Moving on.

218
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Only one thing can save Kong.

219
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What's that?

220
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
A miracle.

221
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
King Kong Lives has the implied subtitle,

222
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
at the end of the last movie.

223
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It even starts with footage from the end of the 76 version.

224
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Linda Hamilton plays a doctor who is desperately, desperately

225
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
trying to save Kong's life for reasons?

226
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
To the point where they engineer this enormous, giant, artificial heart

227
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
to save his life because a huge fall equals...

228
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
the heart's the problem...

229
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I don't know.

230
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But then, out of the random, they find a lady Kong,

231
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
and some competing university takes her,

232
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
and captures her, and takes her back to the States

233
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
because that went so well the first time.

234
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And it's like, yay!

235
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We can get a blood transfusion for the dying Kong.

236
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So, in this one, the man's hubris seems to be,

237
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
oh no, another institution of learning will have the only other giant ape,

238
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and that's why man is the real monster.

239
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Linda Hamilton does not get Konged in the tradition of her lady predecessors.

240
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
In fact, she doesn't seem to register to him at all.

241
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Mostly it's about Kong and She-Kong.

242
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
A huge portion of this movie is just watching a couple of people in monkey suits

243
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
fuck around.

244
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
A lot of shots of people in monkey suits looking sad.

245
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Somehow or other, they find time to gestate a baby Kong

246
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
in the runtime of the movie.

247
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
At the end of King Kong Lives, King Kong Dies.

248
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Moving on.

249
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Visiting hours are over, ma'am.

250
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Permanently.

251
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
So before we get into this one, let's go back to that fake-ass proverb.

252
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Note the difference.

253
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And lo, the beast looked upon the face of beauty,

254
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
and beauty stayed his hand.

255
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And from that day forward, he was his one death.

256
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Nice thing about totally bogus proverbs,

257
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
you can just change them to fit your meaning.

258
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
In this case, it supports the premise that Ann Darrow is not a passive beauty

259
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
that Kong reacts to, but an active agent that does things.

260
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And in this case, befriends him.

261
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
This is the key difference between this version and the original.

262
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
That is not to say that it is superior, necessarily.

263
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It is just noteworthy.

264
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
The cliche criticism of this movie is that it's too long.

265
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You know, which it is.

266
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But really, it's like, at two hours, it would have felt too long.

267
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
But at three hours, it almost feels too short.

268
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Like all post-Lord of the Rings Jackson,

269
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
almost all of the bad comes from Jackson's inability to ever cut anything.

270
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And yet, clearly a lot has been cut,

271
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
because there are so many dropped plot threads in this movie.

272
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And so much that's just...

273
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Why is this even here?

274
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So much that the movie could have cut,

275
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
except for the scenes between Kong and Ann.

276
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Those are great. Keep those.

277
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yes, even this one.

278
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Whee!

279
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Because there is so much love in this version.

280
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's kind of awkward, really.

281
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Like, Jackson loves everything about the original.

282
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
He's remaking too much.

283
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That's the thing you come to learn about, Kong.

284
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
His unfailing ability to destroy the things he loves.

285
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's both hyper-sincere and kind of meta.

286
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Cooper, huh?

287
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I might have known.

288
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Jesus Christ, it's just so loving.

289
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
This movie is kind of worse, and better,

290
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
and also kind of worse than earlier versions.

291
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
For instance, at least it's not like the natives see Ann

292
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
and just inherently know white woman is superior,

293
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
that Ann screams,

294
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and that's what makes the Kong happen.

295
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And the natives are like,

296
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
oh, okay, that's what he wants, let's give him this woman.

297
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
That said, the natives kind of make me physically ill.

298
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Like, at least in earlier versions, they were somewhat humanized,

299
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and they are way more humanized and sympathetic in the 30s version.

300
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Like, you see them dying, and you're like,

301
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
oh, humans, humans are sad and dying, they have babies.

302
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Here they are so othered, they may as well be aliens.

303
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But on the other hand, Kong,

304
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
who is mo-captain of this version by Andy Serkis,

305
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
got dehumaned and is much more overtly a gorilla.

306
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Like, sure, like a smart gorilla with pathos,

307
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
but they dropped the sexualized neither beast nor man aspect.

308
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
He's just a big gorilla.

309
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And I realize that Peej is a little boy,

310
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
but honestly, thank God.

311
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Make a three-hour romp about a misunderstood lady

312
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and her misunderstood gorilla friend,

313
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
and they're going wee on the ice in Central Park,

314
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
and it's weird, but at least you're never really worried

315
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
that Kong is going to, you know, get handsy.

316
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
In this version, Beauty is an active participant,

317
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
which, given that she's our protagonist this time,

318
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
like, indisputably, makes the film a lot more compelling.

319
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
That said, it also makes it a lot less tragic.

320
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The thing about the original is that

321
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Anne doesn't feel anything for Kong at the end.

322
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And in the end, he's more interested in petting her

323
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
than defending himself.

324
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And she feels nothing.

325
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Who cares? Nobody. Certainly not Beauty.

326
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
But honestly, I still find this character arc for Anne

327
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
way more compelling since our lead character

328
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
gets to be something other than a ragdoll.

329
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And watching a character dynamic grow and change

330
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
over the narrative is just more gratifying.

331
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
But I think for everyone's money,

332
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
maybe just seek out one of those two-ish hour fan cuts

333
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
instead of this one.

334
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
There are a couple of non-movie versions

335
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
that at least merit mention.

336
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Did you know that there was, for instance, a musical?

337
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Let the night surround you

338
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It was limited to a run in Australia,

339
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
and although the music wasn't great,

340
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
and it's pretty easy to poo-poo on the mere idea

341
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
of a King Kong musical,

342
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
that animatronic is actually pretty badass.

343
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And also next year, there is a new Netflix series

344
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
in the works, set in the future,

345
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
in which Kong must save humanity

346
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
from an army of robot dinosaurs.

347
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I kind of wish I had known about that

348
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
when I chose this topic,

349
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
or I might have done this later.

350
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Anyway, that's it for this episode.

351
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You can support this show here,

352
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
and also that you can help me decide on themes

353
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
for what my next voting round will be.

354
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
In this case, I've been getting a lot of requests

355
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
for X-Men characters,

356
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
and you know what?

357
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's time to get hype,

358
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
because Apocalypse is coming out next year,

359
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
so here are three characters

360
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
that are slated to appear in that movie.

361
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Pick the one that you want me to do.

362
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Here is the URL where you can vote,

363
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
and it's also in the link below.

364
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
As always, thank you for watching,

365
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
and always ask permission

366
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
before foisting your lady friends

367
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
up any given symbol of man's hubris.

368
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Because I'm sitting, sitting on top

369
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Of the world, way on top

370
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Rolling along, I'm rolling along
