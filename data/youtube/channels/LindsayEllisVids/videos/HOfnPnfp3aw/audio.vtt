00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
So today's Loose Canon features one of the oldest, most iteration-y franchise characters that didn't start in, like, a book, or as an archetype, or as a folk character, but from the movies.

00:12.000 --> 00:20.000
King Kong is utterly of cinema, and while, yeah, there are plenty of non-movie versions,

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
there's a lot to take about how film form has changed over the years just by looking at the different versions of King Kong.

00:27.000 --> 00:34.000
Like, which symbol of man's hubris are we climbing today? Or, why is man the real monster this time?

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
Or the racism that never really seems to be handled better with each different incarnation.

00:40.000 --> 00:48.000
Anyway, given that this is also a character that tends not to get much in the way of, you know, dialogue or any dialogue,

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
Kong is less a deep, nuanced character that changes a lot from version to version, so much as a concept.

00:53.000 --> 01:00.000
If a theme can be a character, it's King Kong, and with it, his interactions with the kidnapped ladyfolk.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
That aspect tends not to change too much.

01:07.000 --> 01:15.000
Even though Kong is supposed to be the monster of the piece, he's also the thing people remember, and like, and even kind of sympathize with.

01:15.000 --> 01:23.000
He's very similar to Godzilla in that way, and yes, we may look at Godzilla another day, maybe, maybe,

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
in that the audience can't help but sympathize with the monster.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Kong is usually an antagonist, but he's never the villain.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
So, while there are a bunch of versions of King Kong that are not movies,

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
I'm going to stick just to movie versions for this particular episode,

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
because the legacy of Kong is so much of popular cinema, and not just American cinema.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
So, climb up your favorite monument to man's hubris and cuddle up with your favorite helpless kidnappee

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
as we take a look at the history of King Kong.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Did you ever hear of Kong?

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
Gorillas are kind of the symbol of virility,

02:10.000 --> 02:17.000
which is funny because they have the smallest nards and lowest sex drives of all of the great apes, including us.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Reason.

02:18.000 --> 02:25.000
But you know what? Whatever. It's a symbol of raw animal virility, not an actual, you know, one-to-one thing.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Well, anyway, neither beast nor man.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
But this is relevant because the neither beast nor man aspect of King Kong

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
tends to be sexualized when he's not actively appealing to children.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
And sometimes when he is. We'll get to that.

02:38.000 --> 02:45.000
King Kong was born of the Lost World genre of literature, popularized by the likes of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

02:45.000 --> 02:52.000
Basically, now that it's the 20th century and Europe and America have colonized all of Africa and half of Asia,

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
those parts of the world aren't so mysterious and scary anymore,

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
so the West is like, hey, let's make up new ones.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Director Marion C. Cooper lived for the whole safari and exotic places thing,

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
and King Kong was the brainchild inspired by his real-life adventures.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
Not to mention some excitement about the Empire State Building, which had only recently finished being constructed.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
In terms of the film itself, Carl Denham is basically Cooper's self-insert character.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
King Kong is a simple movie, and a short movie.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
A film crew goes to an island to film a fantastic, mysterious thing,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
and halfway through they find the monster,

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
and the monster becomes immediately smitten with the first white woman he ever sees.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Yeah, blondes are scarce around here.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
The movie even sets up, like, a lady exchange rate.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
He's offering to trade six of his women for Anne.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
So six women of color on the Anne dollar today.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
Also, King Kong came out at this perfect time of when America was getting, like, really obsessed with monkeys,

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
and that lasted for a while, like decades.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
This movie doesn't spend much time with Anne Darrow and King Kong.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
It's mostly just the adventures of the guys trying to get her back.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
Anne doesn't really even so much as pity Kong, but you know what?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
He doesn't really seem to care what she thinks.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
There is actually one point where he starts stripping off her clothes and tickling her.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
And that's kind of an odd juxtaposition when they get back to New York,

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
which are just really kind of blase about engaging in Carl's really, really, really bad idea to put Kong on stage.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
So, you know, denim insisted.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Of course, we had to come when he said it would help the show.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
I'll relive my trauma if you insist.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
King Kong starts with this quote, which sets up our theme.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
And I find that noteworthy because it's not an old Arabian proverb.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
It's not an old anything proverb.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Cooper made it up.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
The Beauty and the Beast quote has this lofty, profound heft to it.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
And yet it isn't even a real quote.

04:51.000 --> 04:57.000
Like the legend of Kong within the context of the movie, we, the audience, take it for granted that, sure, that's a thing.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Kong is uncivilized masculinity, let's say.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Chaotic neutral, if you will.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
And Beauty, in this case, belongs with lawful neutral.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Or a civilized white guy. Civilized-ish.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
You know, he's a sailor.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
Which leads us to the statement that I'm not sure even the filmmakers were conscious they were making.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
It was Beauty who killed the Beast.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
It's not Beauty that kills the Beast.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
It's colonialism.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
It's not that Kong wants Anne, and that's the problem.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
I mean, Jack wants her too, and, you know, no problem there.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
It's that Anne tames Kong.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
And in the end, that deprives him of the self-preservation instinct that had been keeping him alive all this time.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
And given that Kong is somewhat humanized in this version, and even sexualized to some extent,

05:41.000 --> 05:48.000
there's always been this uncomfortable racial subtext to basically the entire King Kong series.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
To quote an old Mel Brooksian proverb,

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Hey, where are the white women at?

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
It sounds kind of silly, but I'm sorry for it.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
So am I. But I've got a reason.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
For our holy shit, let's hastily crap out a quick cash-in literally the very same year,

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
we have Son of Kong.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
This one totally owns the concept of sympathetic monster Kong who's your buddy.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Aww.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
And it's...

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Well, at least it's short.

06:20.000 --> 06:27.000
Screenwriter Ruth Rose basically copped to the eh, why bother nature of this movie's existence,

06:27.000 --> 06:35.000
So this one is a lot goofier and less efforty and no symbols of man's hubris are climbed.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
No Ann Darrow or Jack Driscoll here.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
This one is about Denim and his flaccid white guilt.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
This must be remorse or something.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
You see, I'm the guy that knocked out your pop with her.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Once again, you know, Denim was always a bit of a self-insert Mary Sue,

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
so it's not the best sequel, but it's not like there's nothing interesting here.

06:56.000 --> 07:03.000
At first, Carl is more torn up about the lawsuits than any, you know, horrors wrought or Kongs exploited.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
He appears to view the whole King Kong thing in the last movie as something of an oopsie-daisy.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Kong sure was a hoodoo for me.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
Carl meanders Skull Island words for a while, makes some friends,

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
and then 30 minutes into a movie that is only an hour long,

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
they decide to go back to Skull Island for reasons and boom.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Why never knew that old Kong had a son?

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
Well, you know what? Good, good. I'm glad you didn't know that.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
And Denim and his new love interest are instantly sympathetic to little Kong.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
Unlike Anne, she's not much with the screaming and isn't afraid of the little guy.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Well, you know, little.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Carl's got some white guilt, so he helps the little Kong out

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
and then pats himself on the back for doing the barest possible minimum.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
I know it sounds funny, but instead of shooting him, I helped him out of a jam.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
I felt I owed his family something.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
And then suddenly, out of nowhere, the island sinks.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Sorry, natives.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
The movie ends with baby Kong holding Denim above the water long enough to be rescued

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
and then baby Kong drowns.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
It has a weirdly tragic ending for such a goofy little movie.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Because Denim learns the ways of his oopsie-daisy,

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
Son of Kong gives Denim and Englehorn the happy ending that they do not deserve.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Poor little Kong.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
Kong family just can't catch a break.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
In 1963, with the Godzilla franchise still going strong,

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
Toho figured, hey, what about this obvious team-up?

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
Let's contrive a reason for Godzilla and King Kong to fight.

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
In this one, a pharmaceutical company wants to boost the ratings of some TV show it's sponsoring.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
So, let's go get a giant monster and put it on display,

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
because that usually works out really well.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
But then things go wrong with that, and Godzilla just happens to pop by,

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
and our human characters do what they always do in these situations.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
And appropriates some of the worst and most embarrassing of American cultural exports as well.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
Yeah, so apparently blackface never really went away in Japan,

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
and the natives are in this a lot.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
Since Kong is scaled up enough to be on par with Godzilla,

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
it does lead to some pretty interesting scale wonk when he gets around to kidnapping a woman.

09:24.000 --> 09:32.000
And she seems to vary from roughly, like, ant-sized relative to Kong to the 40-foot woman.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
Yeah, and him kidnapping this lady comes completely out of nowhere and goes nowhere.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
He just does it because that's what he do.

09:39.000 --> 09:45.000
And then she's saved and it's fine, and they make Kong go fight Godzilla for the last 20 minutes.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
And at least they don't do it in a major city.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Ahem.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
Kong appears to win, and then they let him go because...

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Lesson learned from man's hubris?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
It's just not worth the trouble.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
King Kong Escapes was a Japanese-American co-production

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
loosely based on a Rankin and Bass animated series from a few years earlier.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
In the animated series, Kong befriends a little boy.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
This version loses that angle and Kong...

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
Oh, really? That's what we're going with?

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
This movie is mostly a setup to get Kong here to battle a Robocong

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
built by a mad scientist named, uh, Dr. Who.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
No little boy in this version, but uh-oh, a blonde lady, and you know what that means.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
I don't want to go with you!

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
This movie kind of marries the children-love-Kong thing

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
to the sexualized-he-wants-him-some-lovin' thing.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
This was also made during the Godzilla-is-a-friend-of-the-children phase of that franchise,

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
so that definitely influences this Kong in what is one of his more confused portrayals.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
Kong is a male, and Miss Watson is...

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Well, see for yourselves, gentlemen.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Vagina equals laughing.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
So some bland Americans and one Japanese dude go to Kong Island to study Kong,

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
but they don't get a chance to study him as Dr. Who kidnaps him and turns him into a hypno-Kong.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
See, he built a robot-Kong to get element X, but then Robocong failed,

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
and Dr. Who decided to go for the real deal, and then they fight.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
It's Robocong who does the climbing of Man-O-Man,

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
It's Robocong who does the climbing of Man's hubris in this one,

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
so I guess that metaphor kind of falls apart.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
Kong just kind of follows him to get his lady friend back.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
And although Kong is known for scaling various New York monuments,

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
it has to be said he has by this point scaled a fair portion of Tokyo as well.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
Ah, the movie that nearly killed Jessica Lange's career in its crib

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
in the same way Star Trek nemesis nearly killed Tom Hardy's.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
Yes, I will find a way to work him into anything.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
A story that doesn't belong in the 70s any more than Captain America did.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
Everything is wrong and nothing will ever be right again.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
And I think I might love this version.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
For you goddamn show-bitters, pig ape!

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
This might be the most clumsy update in the history of reboots.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Carl isn't a filmmaker, he's an oil man,

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
which is the most 70 things that ever 70s and makes no sense.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
I promise you, you'll never get another booking in your life.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Said the oil CEO.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
This group goes to Kong's island because drill, baby, drill,

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
but then oil CEO sees Kong and can drive some marketing-related reason to take him,

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
because it's the 70s and, you know, colonialism is kind of dying, and so...

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
this.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
Even an environmental rapist like you, even you...

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Oh, 70s.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Kong climbs not the recently-constructed Empire State Building,

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
but the recently-constructed Twin Towers, because 70s.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
And that's the symbol of man's hubris du jour,

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
something-something oil, something-something stock market.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Fine.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
But trying to sex this movie up is the most bewildering failure.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
It's like a more boring Showgirls.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
To make sure the allegorical sexuality isn't missed on even the most dents,

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
Kong has a stand-in who does a sexy dance before Anne's sacrifice.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
It's an animal, a beast, that tried to rape you.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
He risked his life to save me.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
He tried to rape you, honey.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Ah, just what audiences wanted in their King Kong.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Thank you, movie. Thanks for that.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
The movie clearly does not know how to update the gender thing,

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
because second-wave feminism might give them a frowny face,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
so this will have to do.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
You goddamn chauvinist pig ape!

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Girl power?

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
Dwan is a narcissistic airhead because theme.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
The movie ends with some dumb non-comment about celebrity or something.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
Is this not what you want, actor lady?

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Where the 05 remake loves the original maybe too much,

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
this version seems to hate it.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
It doesn't shy away from the whole rape-of-the-natural-world subtext,

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
but it doesn't do anything with it either.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
I can't decide if I love or hate this version.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
On the one hand, it sucks.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
On the other hand, it did give us one of the most, frankly,

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
wonder-terrible, awesonine additions to the entire Kong legacy.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Hot?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Moving on.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Only one thing can save Kong.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
What's that?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
A miracle.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
King Kong Lives has the implied subtitle,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
at the end of the last movie.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
It even starts with footage from the end of the 76 version.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
Linda Hamilton plays a doctor who is desperately, desperately

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
trying to save Kong's life for reasons?

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
To the point where they engineer this enormous, giant, artificial heart

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
to save his life because a huge fall equals...

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
the heart's the problem...

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I don't know.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
But then, out of the random, they find a lady Kong,

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
and some competing university takes her,

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
and captures her, and takes her back to the States

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
because that went so well the first time.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
And it's like, yay!

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
We can get a blood transfusion for the dying Kong.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
So, in this one, the man's hubris seems to be,

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
oh no, another institution of learning will have the only other giant ape,

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
and that's why man is the real monster.

15:37.000 --> 15:42.000
Linda Hamilton does not get Konged in the tradition of her lady predecessors.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
In fact, she doesn't seem to register to him at all.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
Mostly it's about Kong and She-Kong.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
A huge portion of this movie is just watching a couple of people in monkey suits

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
fuck around.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
A lot of shots of people in monkey suits looking sad.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
Somehow or other, they find time to gestate a baby Kong

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
in the runtime of the movie.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
At the end of King Kong Lives, King Kong Dies.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Moving on.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Visiting hours are over, ma'am.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Permanently.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
So before we get into this one, let's go back to that fake-ass proverb.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Note the difference.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
And lo, the beast looked upon the face of beauty,

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
and beauty stayed his hand.

16:23.000 --> 16:28.000
And from that day forward, he was his one death.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Nice thing about totally bogus proverbs,

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
you can just change them to fit your meaning.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
In this case, it supports the premise that Ann Darrow is not a passive beauty

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
that Kong reacts to, but an active agent that does things.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
And in this case, befriends him.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
This is the key difference between this version and the original.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
That is not to say that it is superior, necessarily.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
It is just noteworthy.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
The cliche criticism of this movie is that it's too long.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
You know, which it is.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
But really, it's like, at two hours, it would have felt too long.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
But at three hours, it almost feels too short.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Like all post-Lord of the Rings Jackson,

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
almost all of the bad comes from Jackson's inability to ever cut anything.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
And yet, clearly a lot has been cut,

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
because there are so many dropped plot threads in this movie.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
And so much that's just...

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Why is this even here?

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
So much that the movie could have cut,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
except for the scenes between Kong and Ann.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Those are great. Keep those.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Yes, even this one.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Whee!

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Because there is so much love in this version.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
It's kind of awkward, really.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
Like, Jackson loves everything about the original.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
He's remaking too much.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
That's the thing you come to learn about, Kong.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
His unfailing ability to destroy the things he loves.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
It's both hyper-sincere and kind of meta.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Cooper, huh?

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
I might have known.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
Jesus Christ, it's just so loving.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
This movie is kind of worse, and better,

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
and also kind of worse than earlier versions.

18:02.000 --> 18:06.000
For instance, at least it's not like the natives see Ann

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
and just inherently know white woman is superior,

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
that Ann screams,

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
and that's what makes the Kong happen.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
And the natives are like,

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
oh, okay, that's what he wants, let's give him this woman.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
That said, the natives kind of make me physically ill.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Like, at least in earlier versions, they were somewhat humanized,

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
and they are way more humanized and sympathetic in the 30s version.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Like, you see them dying, and you're like,

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
oh, humans, humans are sad and dying, they have babies.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
Here they are so othered, they may as well be aliens.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
But on the other hand, Kong,

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
who is mo-captain of this version by Andy Serkis,

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
got dehumaned and is much more overtly a gorilla.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
Like, sure, like a smart gorilla with pathos,

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
but they dropped the sexualized neither beast nor man aspect.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
He's just a big gorilla.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
And I realize that Peej is a little boy,

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
but honestly, thank God.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
Make a three-hour romp about a misunderstood lady

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
and her misunderstood gorilla friend,

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
and they're going wee on the ice in Central Park,

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
and it's weird, but at least you're never really worried

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
that Kong is going to, you know, get handsy.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
In this version, Beauty is an active participant,

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
which, given that she's our protagonist this time,

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
like, indisputably, makes the film a lot more compelling.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
That said, it also makes it a lot less tragic.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
The thing about the original is that

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
Anne doesn't feel anything for Kong at the end.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
And in the end, he's more interested in petting her

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
than defending himself.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
And she feels nothing.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Who cares? Nobody. Certainly not Beauty.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
But honestly, I still find this character arc for Anne

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
way more compelling since our lead character

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
gets to be something other than a ragdoll.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
And watching a character dynamic grow and change

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
over the narrative is just more gratifying.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
But I think for everyone's money,

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
maybe just seek out one of those two-ish hour fan cuts

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
instead of this one.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
There are a couple of non-movie versions

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
that at least merit mention.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
Did you know that there was, for instance, a musical?

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
Let the night surround you

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
It was limited to a run in Australia,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
and although the music wasn't great,

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
and it's pretty easy to poo-poo on the mere idea

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
of a King Kong musical,

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
that animatronic is actually pretty badass.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
And also next year, there is a new Netflix series

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
in the works, set in the future,

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
in which Kong must save humanity

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
from an army of robot dinosaurs.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
I kind of wish I had known about that

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
when I chose this topic,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
or I might have done this later.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Anyway, that's it for this episode.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
You can support this show here,

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
and also that you can help me decide on themes

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
for what my next voting round will be.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
In this case, I've been getting a lot of requests

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
for X-Men characters,

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
and you know what?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
It's time to get hype,

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
because Apocalypse is coming out next year,

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
so here are three characters

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
that are slated to appear in that movie.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Pick the one that you want me to do.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Here is the URL where you can vote,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
and it's also in the link below.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
As always, thank you for watching,

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
and always ask permission

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
before foisting your lady friends

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
up any given symbol of man's hubris.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Because I'm sitting, sitting on top

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
Of the world, way on top

21:33.000 --> 21:39.000
Rolling along, I'm rolling along
