00:00.000 --> 00:13.880
The term Oscar bait is relatively new, and although the concept has been around for a

00:13.880 --> 00:19.360
few decades, it was the 78th Academy Awards in 2006 that indirectly popularized the term

00:19.360 --> 00:31.640
outside of film circles into household use.

00:31.640 --> 00:36.240
The 78th Academy Awards became infamous for its best picture winner, as it was an exceptionally

00:36.240 --> 00:40.920
strong year for thoughtful adult dramas, and as far as the nominees went, there was really

00:40.920 --> 00:49.520
only one wrong answer.

00:49.520 --> 00:54.200
Crash beat Brokeback Mountain, Capote, Good Night and Good Luck, and Munich, despite not

00:54.200 --> 00:58.240
winning Best Picture at any other major film awards or even being nominated for Best Picture

00:58.240 --> 00:59.640
at the Golden Globes.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.600
Several lessons were learned that night.

01:01.600 --> 01:02.600
1.

01:02.600 --> 01:07.000
That aggressive, for-your-consideration campaigns work, regardless of merit, and 2.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.060
Meditations on the subject of race that place the root of the problems on flawed individuals

01:11.060 --> 01:28.560
rather than historical, systemic, and structural injustices will win awards.

01:28.560 --> 01:33.000
We have seen this play out time and time again since Crash won Best Picture.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.400
That said, though Crash beating favorite Brokeback Mountain was controversial at the

01:36.400 --> 01:40.360
time, history has only been more unkind to Crash.

01:40.360 --> 01:45.500
Yale professor Xuan Su wrote that Crash imagines racial encounter along the lines of individual

01:45.500 --> 01:49.480
experience of hate and forgiveness without exploring questions of structural inequality

01:49.480 --> 01:51.240
and public redress.

01:51.240 --> 01:57.080
In 2009, writer and cultural critic Ta-Nehisi Coates called it the worst movie of the decade,

01:57.080 --> 01:58.080
stating,

01:59.080 --> 02:04.560
Instead, you have arguments and propaganda violently bumping into each other, impressed

02:04.560 --> 02:09.680
with their own quirkiness, and calling it the apotheosis of a kind of unthinking, incurious,

02:09.680 --> 02:11.680
nihilistic multiculturalism.

02:40.680 --> 02:45.000
There's this narrative that's emerged surrounding Netflix's Bright that audiences

02:45.000 --> 02:47.280
loved it and critics hated it.

02:47.280 --> 02:50.880
It's hard to measure Bright's success against the typical Hollywood release, which measures

02:50.880 --> 02:52.920
success with box-officer turns.

02:52.920 --> 02:56.520
Netflix doesn't release metrics, but according to Nielsen, which has recently started recording

02:56.520 --> 03:00.320
metrics for streaming services, Bright got about 22 million eyeballs.

03:00.320 --> 03:04.960
That is to say, about 11 million people, assuming an average of about two eyeballs per person,

03:04.960 --> 03:07.600
during the first three days of its release.

03:07.640 --> 03:11.520
Assuming every person who watched Bright at home would have paid money to see it in theaters,

03:11.520 --> 03:16.720
that would put it roughly on track with Transformers 4 and just behind Thor Ragnarok.

03:16.720 --> 03:20.720
Very respectable, especially for a non-franchise film, but this again assumes that everyone

03:20.720 --> 03:24.200
who watched Bright in those three days in the comfort of their own homes would have

03:24.200 --> 03:27.080
gone outside into the world and watched it in theaters.

03:27.080 --> 03:28.560
A mighty big jump.

03:28.560 --> 03:32.640
The sub-narrative to this is the conspiracy narrative, which is stupid but has become

03:32.640 --> 03:35.840
part of the discussion and must therefore be addressed.

03:35.840 --> 03:40.320
That big Hollywood is paying off critics to pan Bright because the new model Bright

03:40.320 --> 03:42.480
represents is a huge threat to their revenue.

03:42.480 --> 03:46.600
Which, you know, it kind of is, but you all have got to stop with the conspiracy theories

03:46.600 --> 03:51.680
around critics being paid off because the Hollywood Illuminati are trying to crush your movie.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.400
There is plenty to dislike about Bright.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.920
Fairy lives don't matter today.

03:56.920 --> 04:00.680
It is true that despite the critical reception, Bright could possibly represent a paradigm

04:00.680 --> 04:05.520
shift in filmmaking, away from the focused theatrical experience and towards streaming,

04:05.520 --> 04:08.560
all while not needing to sacrifice big names or budgets.

04:08.560 --> 04:12.480
Netflix took a lot of risks with Bright, and even if this project wasn't the greatest

04:12.480 --> 04:16.320
triumph, it will be interesting to see where they take other projects in the future.

04:16.320 --> 04:19.920
Although I do question their decision not to hire a screenwriter for Bright, and to

04:19.920 --> 04:24.680
go ahead with the project completely screenwriter-less, I don't know, they already ordered a sequel

04:24.680 --> 04:29.200
from Trigger Warning Entertainment, maybe this time they'll hire a screenwriter.

04:29.200 --> 04:32.160
Shit, did I forget to endorse this?

04:32.160 --> 04:34.880
Anyway, if this is your trash, I'm not trying to judge.

04:34.880 --> 04:39.520
I have seen Showgirls dozens of times, and I just released a video defending Twilight.

04:39.520 --> 04:43.400
That said, even though this movie kind of came and went and everyone else has already,

04:43.400 --> 04:48.320
you know, forgotten about it, I cannot stop thinking about Bright.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.360
So we're going to make a thing out of it.

04:51.360 --> 04:54.040
That's right, we're making a thing.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.240
Fairy lives don't matter today.

04:56.280 --> 05:02.800
So, to start, I am going to simply, factually recount the events of the film without commentary,

05:02.800 --> 05:05.200
questions, or asides.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.200
Alright?

05:06.200 --> 05:07.200
Alright.

05:07.200 --> 05:12.360
Credits roll with a variety of shots of an alternate reality Los Angeles, mostly consisting

05:12.360 --> 05:16.960
of orc graffiti mentioning a dark lord and orc antipathy towards the police.

05:16.960 --> 05:21.280
The story proper opens with street cop Ward, played by Will Smith, getting shot by an orc

05:21.280 --> 05:25.520
robbing a bodega while his partner Jacoby, also an orc, buys him a burrito.

05:25.520 --> 05:29.120
But to some time later, Ward has recovered, his wife tells him that there is a fairy in

05:29.120 --> 05:31.280
the bird feeder, she wants him to kill it.

05:31.280 --> 05:35.640
He goes outside, criticizes his neighbors for playing into gangsta stereotypes, says

05:35.640 --> 05:36.640
this

05:36.640 --> 05:38.680
Fairy lives don't matter today.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.560
And crushes the fairy to death with a broom.

05:40.560 --> 05:43.640
Upstairs, Ward explains to his daughter that racism is bad.

05:43.640 --> 05:47.240
All of the races are different, okay?

05:47.240 --> 05:50.840
And just because they're different doesn't mean anybody's smarter.

05:50.840 --> 05:55.240
Jacoby shows up to offer Ward a ride to work, embarrassing Ward in front of his neighbors.

05:55.240 --> 05:58.520
On the way to work, Ward continues to be a jerk to Jacoby, blaming him for getting

05:58.520 --> 06:02.120
shot, and Jacoby suggests that the root of Ward's racism against him is that he isn't

06:02.120 --> 06:03.120
getting laid.

06:03.120 --> 06:06.880
They drive through an elf district, Ward complains some more, nothing happens, and then they

06:06.880 --> 06:08.040
continue to work.

06:08.040 --> 06:11.920
In the locker room, Ward's co-workers all make bigoted remarks about Jacoby, and justify

06:11.920 --> 06:19.640
their bigotry by the fact that the orcs had sided with the Dark Lord 2,000 years ago.

06:19.640 --> 06:22.960
During assignment, Ward is assigned to partner with Jacoby, he complains to Margaret Cho

06:23.160 --> 06:25.360
who blames the orc diversity department.

06:25.360 --> 06:28.440
Jacoby has a kick me sign on his back, his co-workers laugh at him.

06:28.440 --> 06:30.680
While on the beat, Ward yells at Jacoby over nothing.

06:30.680 --> 06:34.800
They get a call because of a crazy sword-wielding dirty man who mentions a Dark Lord returning.

06:34.800 --> 06:41.600
They joke with Sheriff's Deputy Rodriguez about their shared struggles with racism.

06:41.600 --> 06:42.960
They take in the dirty man.

06:42.960 --> 06:45.660
Dirty man tells Jacoby and Orcish that Ward is special.

06:45.660 --> 06:49.640
Back at the station, Internal Affairs goads Ward into forcing Jacoby to admit that he

06:49.640 --> 06:52.840
had intentionally let the perp go because they're both orcs.

06:52.840 --> 06:57.120
The Magic Task Force, aka the Magic Feds, show up and reveal that the dirty man is in

06:57.120 --> 06:58.800
a group called Shield of Light.

06:58.800 --> 07:02.600
They talk about a group of renegade elves called the Inferni, who need three magic wands

07:02.600 --> 07:04.920
in order to resurrect the Dark Lord.

07:04.920 --> 07:08.840
He explains that most Brights are elves, but humans can be Brights too, if only one in

07:08.840 --> 07:13.360
a million.

07:13.360 --> 07:17.840
Ward and Jacoby get called to a shootout where they find a bunch of supernatural death, this,

07:17.840 --> 07:22.160
and a fragile kick-ass waif named Tika with a magic wand who appears not to speak English.

07:22.160 --> 07:25.960
The Enforcement show up, put the magic wand in a bag, and tell Ward that he needs to go

07:25.960 --> 07:30.800
outside now and murder Jacoby, or the corrupt cops will kill both of them.

07:30.800 --> 07:35.200
Ward goes outside, accuses Jacoby of letting the orc perp go, and Jacoby admits that he

07:35.200 --> 07:39.600
did let the perp go, but only because he realizes he'd chased down the wrong kid after losing

07:39.600 --> 07:41.440
the real shooter in the crowd.

07:41.440 --> 07:44.880
Inside the house, the corrupt cops decide to kill Ward, Jacoby, and Tika no matter what

07:44.880 --> 07:46.040
Ward does.

07:46.040 --> 07:51.400
They go outside, tell Ward it's time, and Ward turns around and murders all four of

07:51.400 --> 07:52.400
them.

07:52.400 --> 07:56.280
Another group of gangsters show up, led by a guy named Poison, declare that the wand

07:56.280 --> 08:02.120
belongs to the Barrio, they escape, run into an invisible wall, have a terrible slow-mo

08:02.120 --> 08:06.120
car crash, which they then walk away from with no apparent injuries.

08:06.120 --> 08:09.200
Inferni leader Layla arrives with her Inferni at the original scene.

08:09.200 --> 08:13.060
They murder an entire Spanish-speaking family of witnesses, including a baby, and begin

08:13.060 --> 08:15.240
the hunt for Ward, Jacoby, and Tika.

08:15.240 --> 08:20.920
Ward and Jacoby hide, are discovered by Poison's gang, one of them grabs the wand, and explodes.

08:21.920 --> 08:25.120
This is what happens to non-Brites who touch magic wands.

08:25.120 --> 08:30.120
They escape, hide in a strip club, where they are found yet again by Poison's gang.

08:30.120 --> 08:33.960
A gunfight is about to commence, but then the Inferni show up and kill everyone, while

08:33.960 --> 08:36.120
failing to capture Ward and Jacoby.

08:36.120 --> 08:40.040
Ward and Jacoby escape, talk about their feelings in a gas station bathroom while Layla whimpers

08:40.040 --> 08:41.040
in the corner.

08:41.040 --> 08:43.720
Ward calls Rodriguez, who demands to see the wand.

08:43.720 --> 08:47.600
He calls the magic feds, but the Inferni are tapping the phone lines and cut the line with

08:47.600 --> 08:48.800
an axe.

08:48.800 --> 08:53.240
Rodriguez cuffs them for their own safety, and is then shot and killed by the Inferni.

08:53.240 --> 08:56.760
Another fight scene, Ward, Jacoby, and Tika escape yet again, only to be captured by a

08:56.760 --> 08:57.760
gang of orcs.

08:57.760 --> 09:03.680
Take your fat Shrek looking ass back to your vehicle and drive the fuck home to Fiona.

09:03.680 --> 09:07.040
The leader explains that he's angry that they brought guns into that first club they

09:07.040 --> 09:11.160
escaped into, demands the wand, beats them, and then stabs Jacoby.

09:11.160 --> 09:18.760
He orders his son, Mikey, Mikey the Orc, to shoot Jacoby, but then wouldn't you know,

09:18.760 --> 09:21.840
it's the kid Jacoby let go, and he can't kill him.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.200
So his dad shoots Jacoby instead.

09:24.200 --> 09:28.480
But Tika rips the wand from her skin, revealing her Brightlyhood, and resurrects Jacoby while

09:28.480 --> 09:31.080
the orcs… let her.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.840
The orcs kneel, and then they are allowed to leave without a word.

09:33.840 --> 09:42.080
Ward chastises Tika for not letting them know she is a Bright, or that she can speak English.

09:42.080 --> 09:45.720
She tells them that the Inferni plan to restore the Dark Lord to power, using the wand has

09:45.720 --> 09:50.480
crippled her, she's dying, and Jacoby, grateful for her saving his life, convinces Ward to

09:50.480 --> 09:52.680
take her back to the house where they found her.

09:52.680 --> 09:57.280
The Inferni are waiting for them, another fight scene, Jacoby shoots Layla, Ward brings

09:57.280 --> 09:59.160
Tika to the pool of healing.

09:59.160 --> 10:07.080
Layla somehow survives her shooting, hangs Jacoby, this happens, Jacoby shoots the wand

10:07.080 --> 10:09.720
out of Layla's hand, but runs out of ammo.

10:09.720 --> 10:15.120
Ward grabs the wand, surprise surprise, he is a Bright.

10:15.120 --> 10:19.840
Jacoby tells him the magic word, and he defeats Layla.

10:19.840 --> 10:23.160
Jacoby tries to get them outside the burning house, when he realizes Ward didn't follow

10:23.160 --> 10:26.280
him, he goes back into the burning building and rescues him.

10:26.280 --> 10:30.560
The orcs that were going to kill them earlier respect him now.

10:30.560 --> 10:39.520
After all that, Ward says this, they explain their side of the story to the magic feds

10:39.520 --> 10:40.600
in the hospital.

10:40.600 --> 10:45.480
The magic feds take the wand, at the memorial for Rodriguez and the four cops Ward murdered,

10:45.480 --> 10:55.080
they see Tika in the crowd, a fairy flies at the camera, the end.

10:55.080 --> 11:00.480
So this is not a book of Henry situation, this is not a concept so squirrely that only

11:00.480 --> 11:03.600
a complete change of genre would have salvaged it.

11:03.600 --> 11:07.440
Obviously there were huge problems with the screenplay, but nothing that a couple of rewrites

11:07.440 --> 11:08.640
couldn't have fixed.

11:08.640 --> 11:11.920
In the broadest of strokes, there's nothing fundamentally wrong with the premise or the

11:11.920 --> 11:12.920
story itself.

11:12.920 --> 11:16.960
A fantasy setting that resembles our modern universe, with the central characters as two

11:16.960 --> 11:21.160
cops of different fantasy races that don't like each other, but have to learn to work

11:21.160 --> 11:26.160
together when they come into possession of what is effectively a weapon of mass destruction.

11:26.160 --> 11:30.520
You could just as easily imagine the two cops as Legolas and Gimli, and that could make

11:30.520 --> 11:32.120
for a fun unique romp.

11:32.120 --> 11:35.720
And it's also not like the elements weren't in place to make it work, specifically with

11:35.720 --> 11:36.840
the two mains.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.240
Smith and Edgerton actually have great chemistry.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.240
No holes?

11:40.240 --> 11:41.240
Huh?

11:41.240 --> 11:43.240
Uh, only the ones that I was born with.

11:44.240 --> 11:45.240
How are your holes?

11:46.240 --> 11:48.240
The fuck can you make a shootout awkward?

11:48.240 --> 11:53.240
Ward is a garden variety jerk who disrespects Jacoby, who happens to be an awkward dork.

11:53.240 --> 11:56.240
I thought it'd be nice to get me a ride on your first date.

11:56.240 --> 11:59.240
But through shared hardship, they learn to value each other.

11:59.240 --> 12:02.240
A modern take on a traditional fantasy trope.

12:02.640 --> 12:05.640
Who thought I'd die fighting side by side with an elf?

12:06.640 --> 12:08.640
What about side by side with a friend?

12:10.640 --> 12:14.640
This dynamic doesn't live up to its potential because of the poor plotting and character

12:14.640 --> 12:15.640
development.

12:15.640 --> 12:18.640
Again, why didn't they hire a screenwriter?

12:18.640 --> 12:19.640
Weird.

12:19.640 --> 12:22.640
But you can see the intent there in a lot of their interactions.

12:22.640 --> 12:27.640
I used to be like you, thinking save everybody and fix everything.

12:28.640 --> 12:31.640
Now I just pretend to be a good dude.

12:32.040 --> 12:35.040
The glut of action scenes is a problem because much of these fight scenes with the Inferni

12:35.040 --> 12:37.040
don't advance anything.

12:37.040 --> 12:42.040
Several times they are in danger, escape, exposit some while Lulu cowers, more danger,

12:42.040 --> 12:43.040
they escape, repeat.

12:43.040 --> 12:48.040
They gain nothing, lose nothing, and learn nothing for nearly an hour of the film's

12:48.040 --> 12:51.040
runtime until Tikka saves Jacoby using the wand.

12:51.040 --> 12:55.040
This should have been the midpoint of the film, not the end of Act 2 as it isn't a

12:55.040 --> 12:56.040
final product.

12:56.040 --> 13:00.040
And the second half of Act 2 should have been built around these three building a dynamic

13:00.440 --> 13:04.440
and learning to trust each other and care about each other, giving us, the audience,

13:04.440 --> 13:09.440
the chance to care about her before she starts dying, and about Jacoby and Ward's dynamic.

13:10.440 --> 13:14.440
If Tikka were to begin trusting Ward and Jacoby during the midpoint, they could have developed

13:14.440 --> 13:19.440
a rapport, and rather than her overextending herself with the wand being potentially fatal,

13:19.440 --> 13:23.440
a plot point which makes no sense because this doesn't happen to any other wand users,

13:23.440 --> 13:27.440
maybe have her be fatally injured in some other way later, and then, the audience having

13:27.840 --> 13:30.840
now built up some emotional investment in these characters, Ward and Jacoby spend the

13:30.840 --> 13:34.840
third act trying to save her, cue the climax, the end.

13:34.840 --> 13:39.840
My point is, it wouldn't have been that hard to bring this up to the level of...

13:39.840 --> 13:41.840
okay.

13:41.840 --> 13:45.840
A lot of the worldbuilding is clumsily explained by characters that have nothing to do with

13:45.840 --> 13:47.840
the narrative, like this guy.

13:47.840 --> 13:52.840
You ever notice how most brides are elves, and elves run the world?

13:52.840 --> 13:53.840
Coincidence?

13:54.240 --> 13:59.240
Yeah, we never see him again after this scene, and organic worldbuilding that isn't exposition

13:59.240 --> 14:03.240
word-dumped from characters that are relevant to the plot comes at the cost of unnecessarily

14:03.240 --> 14:07.240
long action scenes that take up so much of the film's runtime.

14:07.240 --> 14:08.240
But this movie is gritty.

14:08.240 --> 14:14.240
See, it needs to reflect harsh truths about racism in LA.

14:14.240 --> 14:16.240
You know, like Crash did.

14:16.240 --> 14:20.240
Look at all that urban gangsta flavor.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.640
Ahhhhhhhhhhh

14:27.640 --> 14:31.640
A major symptom of these structure problems comes in the form of the poor execution of

14:31.640 --> 14:33.640
setup and payoff.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.640
The trip to Elftown at the beginning is a setup that never pays off.

14:36.640 --> 14:39.640
They go to Elftown, Elftown is set up.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.840
It is a huge pointed setup.

14:41.840 --> 14:47.840
Ain't nothing over here but rich-ass elves just running the world and shopping.

14:48.240 --> 14:52.640
Not only do they never go back to Elftown again, Elftown isn't even mentioned.

14:52.640 --> 14:55.160
Also they couldn't find a better name for it than Elftown?

14:55.160 --> 14:58.640
Like Beverly Hills isn't called WEALTHTOWN.

14:58.640 --> 15:00.160
Also where the fuck is this supposed to be?

15:00.160 --> 15:04.640
It looks like downtown LA but Beverly Hills is like 10 miles away.

15:04.640 --> 15:05.640
Nevermind.

15:05.640 --> 15:10.640
The fact that Ward has a loving family totally undermines the character they're going for.

15:10.640 --> 15:13.640
You don't want me as a friend.

15:14.440 --> 15:15.440
Yeah.

15:15.440 --> 15:20.440
Cause besides taking out the fairy LAPD style, you seem to be doing alright.

15:20.440 --> 15:27.840
You have a loving family, a daughter you care for, a wife who makes you coffee with napkins

15:27.840 --> 15:29.440
and you joke around with.

15:34.440 --> 15:36.440
Made doubly confusing by this line.

15:44.440 --> 15:47.440
Physical love.

15:47.440 --> 15:52.440
A relic from an earlier draft of the script where Ward was estranged from his wife.

15:52.440 --> 15:56.440
But if they were going to give Ward a nice wife and give them a happy relationship, then

15:56.440 --> 15:58.440
they probably should have cut this exchange.

15:58.440 --> 16:01.440
And the setup of the family pays off not at all.

16:01.440 --> 16:05.440
All it does is undermine the badass loner thing they're trying to go for with Ward.

16:05.440 --> 16:09.440
It is a weak incentive for him to maybe betray Jacoby, maybe for a little bit.

16:09.440 --> 16:13.440
But really, why does he even have a wife and daughter?

16:14.240 --> 16:17.240
They get the family out of danger immediately, and then the family only comes back at the

16:17.240 --> 16:18.240
very end.

16:18.240 --> 16:24.240
If you want to play up this I'm a bad dude with no friends angle, don't give him a family.

16:24.240 --> 16:29.240
These are wasted story elements in a story with already way too much clumsy, inorganic

16:29.240 --> 16:30.240
worldbuilding.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.240
Poison's gang, for instance.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.240
They are never mentioned again after the Titty Bar shootout.

16:34.240 --> 16:36.240
We gonna Titty Bar gunfight die.

16:36.240 --> 16:40.240
Which wouldn't be so bad if there had been some growth or development during the previous

16:41.040 --> 16:44.040
three shootouts with Poison's gang, but there isn't.

16:47.040 --> 16:53.040
All we get is that this is what happens when a non-bright touches a wand, a thing that

16:53.040 --> 16:58.040
we already knew, and the orcs getting mad at the trio as justification to capture them

16:58.040 --> 17:02.040
and shoot Jacoby later, a plot point which is really weak.

17:02.040 --> 17:06.240
These three spend a full half hour of the film on the run from Poison's gang, who

17:06.240 --> 17:10.040
does not matter, and has nothing to do with the plot.

17:10.840 --> 17:14.840
Moreover, no one seems to care that even if they get this magic wand, they cannot use it.

17:14.840 --> 17:19.840
Perhaps the worst failure of setup and payoff is that Mikey the orc, the kid whom Jacoby

17:19.840 --> 17:24.840
helped escape earlier, that we meet later in the orc hideout, at first you're like

17:24.840 --> 17:26.840
hey some setup that was paid off.

17:26.840 --> 17:29.840
Jacoby's mercy and good deeds saves him.

17:29.840 --> 17:34.840
But then Mikey's dad shoots Jacoby anyway, and Tika has to use the wand to resurrect him.

17:35.640 --> 17:40.640
So this setup, the fact that Jacoby showed Mikey mercy, is of no consequence.

17:40.640 --> 17:44.640
There is no meaningful outcome to Jacoby showing this kid mercy.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.640
He gets shot either way.

17:46.640 --> 17:48.640
Bad setup and payoff.

17:48.640 --> 17:53.640
And once again, in the earlier draft of the script, Mikey the orc actually did spare Jacoby.

17:53.640 --> 17:58.640
But in the David Ayer rewrite, it was decided that apparently that wasn't dramatic enough.

17:58.640 --> 18:03.640
And as in the example with the estranged wife, they kept the setup where the payoff no longer makes sense.

18:04.440 --> 18:08.440
I started with the focus on structure because flawed though it is, the story is there and

18:08.440 --> 18:11.440
this could have easily been fixed in the screenplay stage.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.440
This could have worked.

18:13.440 --> 18:16.440
But really, the devil is in the details.

18:22.440 --> 18:27.440
A major part of film editing is just as much deciding what to cut out as what to keep in.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.440
Elements in a story need narrative utility.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.240
Let's examine a scene. Ward kills the fairy.

18:33.240 --> 18:36.240
What narrative purpose does this serve?

18:36.240 --> 18:38.240
Fairies in this universe appear to be pests.

18:38.240 --> 18:43.240
Which is fine, but either way, Ward's solution is cruel and inhumane.

18:43.240 --> 18:47.240
So from a narrative utility standpoint, either it is trying to demonstrate Ward's antipathy

18:47.240 --> 18:51.240
towards fantasy things, or it is setting up Ward as a blood psychopath.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.240
Here's why neither of these things work.

18:55.240 --> 18:59.240
One, in-universe, magic is seen as separate from all things normal.

19:00.040 --> 19:03.040
That's whatever you want.

19:03.040 --> 19:08.040
The magic wand is magic, but that doesn't mean that orcs, elves, humans, or fairies are.

19:08.040 --> 19:10.040
They just exist in this universe and they share it.

19:10.040 --> 19:12.040
Therefore, humans aren't necessarily separate from it.

19:12.040 --> 19:15.040
They are just another race in this world.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.040
Like they are in The Lord of the Rings.

19:17.040 --> 19:21.040
So using this as setup as Ward magic hater doesn't work because the fairy is just another

19:21.040 --> 19:23.040
non-magical element in this universe.

19:23.040 --> 19:26.040
Number two, is it setting up Ward as a blood psychopath?

19:26.840 --> 19:29.840
Well, he's kind of a jerk, but he isn't exceptionally cruel after this scene.

19:29.840 --> 19:34.840
He drops his four corrupt colleagues because he correctly assumes they are about to kill

19:34.840 --> 19:35.840
both of them.

19:35.840 --> 19:39.840
Either way, we never see him abusing his power in relation to relative powerlessness,

19:39.840 --> 19:42.840
as it relates to him killing what is in this universe effectively an animal.

19:42.840 --> 19:46.840
So he doesn't grow from this, learn to be more kind to the powerless,

19:46.840 --> 19:48.840
nor is it foreshadowing some other cruelty.

19:48.840 --> 19:53.840
Like imagine if this movie had begun with Ward instead killing like a rat or a raccoon

19:53.840 --> 19:55.840
or a cat or something in the same manner.

19:56.640 --> 19:57.640
Yikes, we might say.

19:57.640 --> 19:59.640
Not a good dude.

19:59.640 --> 20:01.640
This must be going somewhere.

20:01.640 --> 20:02.640
But it doesn't.

20:02.640 --> 20:03.640
It's what I do.

20:03.640 --> 20:05.640
And this isn't about Will Smith being mean.

20:05.640 --> 20:09.640
It's about nobody acts like a person in this movie.

20:09.640 --> 20:14.640
The worst offender is the climactic scene in which Ward discovers that he is a bright.

20:14.640 --> 20:18.640
Everyone is beaten up pretty badly, and then Layla starts with this.

20:18.640 --> 20:21.640
What have you done to my sister?

20:21.640 --> 20:23.640
What have you done to her?

20:23.640 --> 20:28.640
Which neither sets up anything nor pays off anything or relates to anything that we've learned about the Inferni.

20:28.640 --> 20:31.640
And don't start with it setting up extended universe crap.

20:31.640 --> 20:35.640
Jacoby breaks free of being hung, shoots the wand out of Layla's hand,

20:35.640 --> 20:38.640
and then Ward starts like sassing him.

20:38.640 --> 20:42.640
Nick, if you were aiming at the wand, that was a really good shot.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.640
But shoot her in her head!

20:44.640 --> 20:50.640
And nobody is like moving or hiding or trying to defend themselves as they might be doing in a tense shootout.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.640
And Jacoby moves to shoot her again, but...

20:52.640 --> 20:54.640
I can't. I'm out.

20:54.640 --> 20:59.640
He says this like he's got a headache and he just realizes he left his aspirin at home.

20:59.640 --> 21:02.640
And all of these characters are within about ten feet of each other.

21:02.640 --> 21:06.640
Nothing is stopping Layla from lunging for the wand with her other not-blown-off hand,

21:06.640 --> 21:08.640
or Jacoby from bum-rushing her.

21:08.640 --> 21:11.640
And it takes like a full minute for Ward to grab that wand.

21:11.640 --> 21:13.640
And then he gets it and he's like,

21:13.640 --> 21:15.640
What do I do?

21:15.640 --> 21:17.640
Hey Nick, I got the wand!

21:17.640 --> 21:18.640
What now?

21:18.640 --> 21:20.640
And still nobody's moving?

21:20.640 --> 21:22.640
Like, they're still in their spots.

21:22.640 --> 21:25.640
Like, well, they can't move or that would ruin the blocking.

21:25.640 --> 21:29.640
The unkillable Layla doesn't even stand up when Leeloo tells Ward the magic word.

21:29.640 --> 21:31.640
The war word is Vaequaras.

21:31.640 --> 21:33.640
Dracarys.

21:35.640 --> 21:37.640
And in the time it takes him to process this,

21:37.640 --> 21:40.640
Layla still could have grabbed it from him, but she doesn't.

21:40.640 --> 21:41.640
She stays put.

21:41.640 --> 21:45.640
Like, you know, we couldn't have set up the magic word before this scene somehow.

21:45.640 --> 21:48.640
This scene is just astonishing in how much it doesn't work from every angle.

21:48.640 --> 21:53.640
Because no one acts like a person who is in danger.

21:53.640 --> 21:54.640
I'm out.

21:54.640 --> 21:57.640
But it's Tika who stands out as the biggest problem character development-wise,

21:57.640 --> 22:02.640
as there's never any reason for Ward or Jacoby or the audience to be emotionally invested in her.

22:02.640 --> 22:05.640
There's no reason for her to withhold that she speaks English as long as she does.

22:05.640 --> 22:08.640
She speaks English pretty good now, too.

22:08.640 --> 22:09.640
Now I trust you.

22:09.640 --> 22:11.640
Or her brightly-hood.

22:11.640 --> 22:13.640
Or to follow them around as long as she does,

22:13.640 --> 22:15.640
if no trust or emotional bond has been built up.

22:15.640 --> 22:17.640
By the end of the movie, when she's dying,

22:17.640 --> 22:20.640
neither Ward nor Jacoby nor the audience have any reason to care about her.

22:20.640 --> 22:25.640
Tika acting like a weird child alien is, yep, you guessed it,

22:25.640 --> 22:29.640
a relic from an earlier draft where she was a literal elf child,

22:29.640 --> 22:31.640
and that's why they were carting her around.

22:31.640 --> 22:34.640
So I guess when they added the titty-bar gunfight,

22:34.640 --> 22:36.640
We're gonna titty-bar gunfight die.

22:36.640 --> 22:38.640
that means they couldn't have Tika be a literal child anymore.

22:38.640 --> 22:43.640
So they aged her up to like a 25-year-old, but changed literally nothing else.

22:43.640 --> 22:45.640
But Tika is emblematic of the bigger problem with the film

22:45.640 --> 22:47.640
as it ties into theme and world-building.

22:47.640 --> 22:49.640
She's just poorly thought out.

22:49.640 --> 22:51.640
She's just as much a MacGuffin as the wand is.

22:51.640 --> 22:55.640
When she is deigned the thinnest of backstories, it is pure function.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.640
You're gonna need to unfuck this.

22:58.640 --> 23:01.640
No motivation, no emotional core, nothing.

23:01.640 --> 23:06.640
Her defection from the Inferni is motivated by nothing other than Dark Lord bad,

23:06.640 --> 23:09.640
but we never have any idea of who she is,

23:09.640 --> 23:11.640
so there's never any reason to care about her.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.640
The only character who even consistently comes close to acting like a person

23:14.640 --> 23:17.640
with pathos and motivations is Jacoby.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.640
Hey, Sophia, what's up, rockstar?

23:19.640 --> 23:22.640
So, like Crash feels like it was written by space aliens

23:22.640 --> 23:24.640
trying to understand why humans are racist,

23:24.640 --> 23:28.640
You get on your knees and suck my motherfucking dick while you're down there!

23:28.640 --> 23:30.640
so too it applies to Bright.

23:30.640 --> 23:33.640
To paraphrase Ta-Nehisi Coates' comments on Crash,

23:33.640 --> 23:35.640
I don't think there is a single human being in Bright,

23:35.640 --> 23:38.640
except for, arguably, the Orc.

23:38.640 --> 23:40.640
Both Crash and Bright reach to capture a truth,

23:40.640 --> 23:42.640
but capture nothing,

23:42.640 --> 23:46.640
because it fails utterly to capture the way people talk and think and act,

23:46.640 --> 23:48.640
or how systems work within a society.

23:48.640 --> 23:49.640
Man, you know what they say,

23:49.640 --> 23:51.640
once with the Dark Lord, always with the Dark Lord.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.640
Now, this normally wouldn't be that noteworthy.

23:53.640 --> 23:56.640
It would just be a premise with lots of potential

23:56.640 --> 23:59.640
that unfortunately led to a bad movie.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.640
But then Bright had to go and make Bright's self about race.

24:03.640 --> 24:04.640
I said, Orcs ain't cops.

24:04.640 --> 24:05.640
He said, now we are.

24:05.640 --> 24:08.640
Then he went outside into his Audi car.

24:08.640 --> 24:11.640
The intellectual grandfather of the type of fantasy shown in Bright

24:11.640 --> 24:12.640
is J.R.R. Tolkien,

24:12.640 --> 24:15.640
whose works directly influenced all contemporary fantasy

24:15.640 --> 24:19.640
from Dungeons and Dragons to Willow to Skyrim to Bright.

24:19.640 --> 24:21.640
Lord of the Rings is also a launching point of discussion

24:21.640 --> 24:23.640
as it pertains to allegory and racial coding

24:23.640 --> 24:25.640
as it applies to works of fantasy.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.640
Many over the years have pointed to The Lord of the Rings

24:27.640 --> 24:30.640
as an obvious allegory for, for instance, World War II,

24:30.640 --> 24:32.640
a claim which Tolkien virulently denied,

24:32.640 --> 24:35.640
stating in a preface to a reprint of Fellowship of the Ring,

24:35.640 --> 24:38.640
I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations,

24:38.640 --> 24:39.640
and always have done so

24:39.640 --> 24:42.640
since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence.

24:42.640 --> 24:43.640
Tolkien's attitude was that

24:43.640 --> 24:45.640
if people are going to read allegory and do his work,

24:45.640 --> 24:47.640
fine, have a party,

24:47.640 --> 24:49.640
but not to assume that he intended any to be there.

24:49.640 --> 24:51.640
He drew from history, yes,

24:51.640 --> 24:54.640
but he wasn't making an intentional statement about it.

24:54.640 --> 24:55.640
Now the thing is, Tolkien, of course,

24:55.640 --> 24:57.640
existed in, absorbed, and reproduced

24:57.640 --> 24:59.640
the colonialist worldview of his day.

24:59.640 --> 25:01.640
No, I don't think he did it on purpose,

25:01.640 --> 25:03.640
but I also don't think it occurred to him

25:03.640 --> 25:05.640
to question the implications of making

25:05.640 --> 25:08.640
the dark-skinned races of men side with Sauron.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.640
I'm not saying Tolkien was a bad guy,

25:10.640 --> 25:12.640
I'm just saying he was a man of his time,

25:12.640 --> 25:14.640
and critical race theory didn't really exist yet.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.640
However, it is also important to differentiate between

25:16.640 --> 25:18.640
allegory, story elements that are meant to have

25:18.640 --> 25:21.640
a one-to-one correlation with something outside of the story,

25:21.640 --> 25:24.640
for instance, Aslan in the Narnia books as Christ allegory,

25:24.640 --> 25:28.640
or Animal Farm as allegory for totalitarian communism,

25:28.640 --> 25:30.640
and, of course, there's Mother,

25:30.640 --> 25:32.640
which is the rare modern movie that is just

25:32.640 --> 25:34.640
oops, all allegory.

25:34.640 --> 25:36.640
I gave you everything!

25:36.640 --> 25:38.640
Allegory is not the same as coding,

25:38.640 --> 25:40.640
Why don't you get a haircut with your bitch ass?

25:40.640 --> 25:42.640
which lifts elements from the real world

25:42.640 --> 25:44.640
to provide a shorthand message based on

25:44.640 --> 25:46.640
the presumed worldview of the audience,

25:46.640 --> 25:48.640
i.e., the aliens in Avatar being coded

25:48.640 --> 25:50.640
as indigenous as shorthand for them being

25:50.640 --> 25:52.640
more pure and in touch with nature.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.640
And again, coding is one of those terms

25:54.640 --> 25:56.640
that has become politicized and is often

25:56.640 --> 25:58.640
read as negative when, in fact,

25:58.640 --> 26:00.640
it is a neutral term in academia.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.640
It describes a sociological phenomenon.

26:02.640 --> 26:04.640
Coding is a neutral term.

26:04.640 --> 26:07.640
Allegory exists as a statement of authorial intent.

26:07.640 --> 26:10.640
Coding may or may not even be a conscious choice.

26:10.640 --> 26:11.640
Ah!

26:11.640 --> 26:13.640
With stories made by and for humans,

26:13.640 --> 26:15.640
there is always coding.

26:15.640 --> 26:17.640
There's especially coding in fantasy worlds

26:17.640 --> 26:18.640
derived from the worlds of Tolkien.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.640
Some that were there in the books.

26:20.640 --> 26:22.640
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.

26:22.640 --> 26:24.640
Some that weren't.

26:24.640 --> 26:26.640
And on some levels, this is kind of inescapable

26:26.640 --> 26:28.640
because it's basically impossible to create

26:28.640 --> 26:30.640
fantasy races that aren't at least a little bit

26:30.640 --> 26:32.640
derived from the author's perception of human cultures.

26:32.640 --> 26:35.640
Humans have a natural in-group, out-group mentality

26:35.640 --> 26:37.640
and we've divvied ourselves up

26:37.640 --> 26:39.640
into lots and lots of groups.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.640
So, cultural and racial coding

26:41.640 --> 26:43.640
sneaks into stories, intentional or not.

26:43.640 --> 26:45.640
If we look at Skyrim, for example,

26:45.640 --> 26:48.640
we have the Nords, who are a coded Scandinavian mishmash.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.640
We also have the race of the Khajiit.

26:54.640 --> 26:56.640
Here we have a race of nomadic cat people

26:56.640 --> 26:58.640
with these accents.

26:58.640 --> 27:00.640
Much snow in Skyrim.

27:00.640 --> 27:02.640
Enough snow.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.640
I does not want anymore.

27:04.640 --> 27:06.640
They also make very good thieves.

27:06.640 --> 27:08.640
They like their skooma.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.640
Yeah, yeah, they're Romani.

27:10.640 --> 27:12.640
They're Romani. They're cat Romani. We get it.

27:12.640 --> 27:14.640
You with one of the trade caravans, Khajiit?

27:14.640 --> 27:17.640
Your kind always seems to find trouble.

27:17.640 --> 27:19.640
And then, of course, there are orcs.

27:19.640 --> 27:21.640
Written variations on orcs have been around

27:21.640 --> 27:23.640
in English folklore as far back as Beowulf.

27:23.640 --> 27:26.640
But it was Tolkien who collated the modern idea of the orc.

27:26.640 --> 27:28.640
Tolkien described his orcs as

27:28.640 --> 27:30.640
corruptions of the human form.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.640
Squat, broad, flat-nosed,

27:32.640 --> 27:35.640
sallow-skinned, with wide mouths and slant eyes.

27:35.640 --> 27:37.640
In fact, degraded and repulsive versions

27:37.640 --> 27:39.640
of the, to Europeans,

27:39.640 --> 27:41.640
least lovely Mongol types.

27:41.640 --> 27:43.640
Nice.

27:43.640 --> 27:45.640
The works of Tolkien influenced Dungeons and Dragons,

27:45.640 --> 27:47.640
which influenced Warhammer,

27:47.640 --> 27:49.640
which influenced World of Warcraft,

27:49.640 --> 27:51.640
which influenced the Elder Scrolls games,

27:51.640 --> 27:52.640
which influenced Bright.

27:52.640 --> 27:54.640
Orcs in all of these absorb coding

27:54.640 --> 27:56.640
from ethnic groups from across the world,

27:56.640 --> 27:58.640
from ancient Celts, to Scots,

27:58.640 --> 28:00.640
to the Zulu, and, of course,

28:00.640 --> 28:02.640
the least lovely Mongol types.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.640
So while some fantasy fans want to suggest

28:04.640 --> 28:06.640
that fantasy races sprung fully formed

28:06.640 --> 28:09.640
from the forehead of Zeus with no real-world influences,

28:09.640 --> 28:11.640
Bright isn't completely off the mark

28:11.640 --> 28:13.640
by applying racial coding to its orcs.

28:13.640 --> 28:15.640
And in a perverse way, there is something

28:15.640 --> 28:17.640
cogent about Bright putting its orcs in chains

28:17.640 --> 28:19.640
and sports jerseys and do-rags

28:19.640 --> 28:21.640
and wearing baseball caps with the name

28:21.640 --> 28:23.640
of their gang lovingly embroidered on the front

28:23.640 --> 28:25.640
just like real gangs do.

28:25.640 --> 28:28.640
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

28:28.640 --> 28:29.620
According to Tolkien,

28:29.620 --> 28:31.640
I think that many confuse applicability

28:31.640 --> 28:33.640
with allegory, but the one resides

28:33.640 --> 28:35.640
in the freedom of the reader and the other

28:35.640 --> 28:37.640
in the proposed domination of the author.

28:37.640 --> 28:39.640
In other words, for something to be considered allegorical,

28:39.640 --> 28:41.640
there needs to be authorial intent.

28:41.640 --> 28:43.640
And authors can't really help it if people

28:43.640 --> 28:45.640
read into their work something that they did

28:45.640 --> 28:46.640
not intend.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.640
But coding does not require authorial intent.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.640
Coding is often careless or unintentional,

28:51.640 --> 28:53.640
born from reappropriating tropes

28:53.640 --> 28:55.640
without delving into the history of why they're even there

28:55.640 --> 28:56.640
in the first place.

28:56.640 --> 28:58.640
Missy called John John Binks.

28:58.640 --> 28:59.640
Missy, your humble servant.

28:59.640 --> 29:01.640
Coding in Bright is way too on the nose

29:01.640 --> 29:03.640
to be ignorant, but it certainly

29:03.640 --> 29:04.640
raises questions.

29:04.640 --> 29:06.640
Can racial coding in science fiction

29:06.640 --> 29:08.640
and fantasy used to make some

29:08.640 --> 29:10.640
one-to-one

29:10.640 --> 29:12.640
allegory about interracial

29:12.640 --> 29:14.640
relationships ever actually

29:14.640 --> 29:15.640
work?

29:15.640 --> 29:17.640
One observation that's kind of flown under the radar

29:17.640 --> 29:19.640
is the comparison of Bright to the

29:19.640 --> 29:21.640
almost identical 1988 film Alien

29:21.640 --> 29:23.640
Nation, which has a very similar premise

29:23.640 --> 29:25.640
right down to the first alien

29:25.640 --> 29:27.640
cop in the LAPD, played by

29:27.640 --> 29:29.640
Mandy Patinkin, and the aliens as

29:29.640 --> 29:31.640
thinly veiled allegories for black and hispanic

29:31.640 --> 29:32.640
communities in LA.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.640
Why do we have to take them?

29:34.640 --> 29:36.640
Why can't they go to Russia or someplace like that?

29:36.640 --> 29:38.640
A list of newcomer informants is about

29:38.640 --> 29:40.640
as long as a list of Mexican war

29:40.640 --> 29:42.640
heroes. Hey! Hey! Come on.

29:42.640 --> 29:44.640
Nobody talks to nobody down there.

29:44.640 --> 29:46.640
And half of them don't even speak English.

29:46.640 --> 29:48.640
That movie also sucks. But Alien Nation

29:48.640 --> 29:50.640
has one crucial difference, as does

29:50.640 --> 29:52.640
District 9. The aliens are

29:52.640 --> 29:54.640
relative newcomers to this universe, and

29:54.640 --> 29:56.640
therefore they don't conflict with the rest of history

29:56.640 --> 29:58.640
as we, the audience, knows it.

29:58.640 --> 30:00.640
Now, District 9 is controversial because

30:00.640 --> 30:02.640
it does some of the things that Bright does,

30:02.640 --> 30:04.640
namely using aliens as an allegory for

30:04.640 --> 30:06.640
racial injustice. It's also gotten huge pushback

30:06.640 --> 30:08.640
for its portrayal of the Nigerian gangsters,

30:08.640 --> 30:10.640
and I'm not going to disagree with that.

30:10.640 --> 30:12.640
But while District 9 is far from perfect,

30:12.640 --> 30:14.640
I'm going to quickly point out where I think it succeeds

30:14.640 --> 30:16.640
and its allegory where Bright fails.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.640
1. The aliens are alien, and with the

30:18.640 --> 30:20.640
exception of Christopher Johnson, largely

30:20.640 --> 30:22.640
incomprehensible.

30:22.640 --> 30:24.640
Yes, there is racial coding woven in because

30:24.640 --> 30:26.640
there always is, but they aren't wearing do-rags

30:26.640 --> 30:28.640
and chains and sports jerseys.

30:28.640 --> 30:30.640
God damn it, Bright!

30:30.640 --> 30:32.640
2. Our history and the movie's history diverge like

30:32.640 --> 30:34.640
20 years earlier. The recently divergent

30:34.640 --> 30:36.640
history means that interhuman racism

30:36.640 --> 30:38.640
was allowed to develop and thrive and does not

30:38.640 --> 30:40.640
feel out of place in this universe the way

30:40.640 --> 30:42.640
it does in Bright. 3. You spend a lot of time

30:42.640 --> 30:44.640
with Christopher Johnson and see the actual shit

30:44.640 --> 30:46.640
he and his family live under, and it's not just

30:46.640 --> 30:48.640
stupid lip service like a

30:48.640 --> 30:50.640
kick-me sign at work. 4. District 9 does

30:50.640 --> 30:52.640
not pussyfoot around what it thinks is a cute

30:52.640 --> 30:54.640
metaphor. It does not place the blame of

30:54.640 --> 30:56.640
racism on flawed individuals, but rather

30:56.640 --> 30:58.640
on vast systems in which individuals

30:58.640 --> 31:00.640
are willingly complicit because they

31:00.640 --> 31:02.640
benefit from those systems. But

31:02.640 --> 31:04.640
perhaps the most applicable comparison to Bright

31:04.640 --> 31:06.640
is who framed Roger Rabbit.

31:06.640 --> 31:08.640
What could have possibly happened to you

31:08.640 --> 31:10.640
to turn you into such a sourpuss?

31:10.640 --> 31:12.640
You wanna know?

31:12.640 --> 31:14.640
I'll tell you.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.640
A toon killed my brother.

31:16.640 --> 31:18.640
A toon? No!

31:18.640 --> 31:20.640
First of all, sometimes it is actually better to just not

31:20.640 --> 31:22.640
explain how we got here. Roger Rabbit

31:22.640 --> 31:24.640
never explains the history of how toons came

31:24.640 --> 31:26.640
to be, and to be clear, that is a good

31:26.640 --> 31:28.640
thing, because we do not need it in this

31:28.640 --> 31:30.640
story. It's also a clever reflection on

31:30.640 --> 31:32.640
how black entertainers were valued as commodities

31:32.640 --> 31:34.640
in the 1940s. In

31:34.640 --> 31:36.640
many instances, not even allowed to be

31:36.640 --> 31:38.640
patrons in some establishments in which

31:38.640 --> 31:40.640
they themselves were headliners.

31:40.640 --> 31:42.640
Toon review. Strictly

31:42.640 --> 31:44.640
humans only, okay? But the most

31:44.640 --> 31:46.640
important facet of who framed Roger Rabbit

31:46.640 --> 31:48.640
is that the plot of the corporate scheme to

31:48.640 --> 31:50.640
bulldoze Toontown is perfectly interwoven

31:50.640 --> 31:52.640
with both the themes of the toons as an

31:52.640 --> 31:54.640
exploited underclass and with the protagonist's

31:54.640 --> 31:56.640
own internal conflict and nascent

31:56.640 --> 31:58.640
anti-toon racism. So when you

31:58.640 --> 32:00.640
look at the above examples, especially Roger

32:00.640 --> 32:02.640
Rabbit, the laziness of the world-building

32:02.640 --> 32:04.640
and allegory in Bright comes into sharp

32:04.640 --> 32:06.640
focus. Racism is bad,

32:06.640 --> 32:08.640
orcs are oppressed, now here's a movie

32:08.640 --> 32:10.640
about some cops playing keep-away-with-a-magic-wand

32:10.640 --> 32:12.640
for 90 minutes. Really, a lot of these

32:12.640 --> 32:14.640
problems could have been avoided if they hadn't taken

32:14.640 --> 32:16.640
a poorly thought-out fantasy-based

32:16.640 --> 32:18.640
alternate reality of our own world and used

32:18.640 --> 32:20.640
it to make a comment on the tragedy of modern

32:20.640 --> 32:22.640
racial relations. And the

32:22.640 --> 32:24.640
real irony is if you look at earlier drafts

32:24.640 --> 32:26.640
of the script, they're not really there.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.640
The hacky lines about the Alamo,

32:28.640 --> 32:30.640
words like gangbanger and

32:30.640 --> 32:32.640
homies, those appear to be

32:32.640 --> 32:34.640
Ayer additions. And playing up

32:34.640 --> 32:36.640
those elements only makes the movie make

32:36.640 --> 32:38.640
less sense. Like the master race

32:38.640 --> 32:40.640
of elves here means nothing because the baddies

32:40.640 --> 32:42.640
are outliers. It drops this

32:42.640 --> 32:44.640
very juicy idea that this is a very

32:44.640 --> 32:46.640
vertical society and then does nothing with

32:46.640 --> 32:48.640
it, and it ends up meaning nothing to the world.

32:48.640 --> 32:50.640
More to the point, the plot itself,

32:50.640 --> 32:52.640
keep-the-magic-wand-away-from-Layla,

32:52.640 --> 32:54.640
has fuck-all to do with the

32:54.640 --> 32:56.640
oppression of orcs or Mexicans

32:56.640 --> 32:58.640
or whoever. The entire first act

32:58.640 --> 33:00.640
sets up this world of oppression, but

33:00.640 --> 33:02.640
once the wand comes along, the theme of racism

33:02.640 --> 33:04.640
is bad as just window dressing.

33:04.640 --> 33:06.640
Yeah, the film still would have had racial

33:06.640 --> 33:08.640
coding because all fantasy does,

33:08.640 --> 33:10.640
but did the orcs really need to be wearing

33:10.640 --> 33:12.640
sports jerseys?

33:12.640 --> 33:14.640
Did we need this?

33:14.640 --> 33:16.640
I'm not sure embracing all that

33:16.640 --> 33:18.640
urban gangsta flavor

33:18.640 --> 33:20.640
and leaning in

33:20.640 --> 33:22.640
really, really hard

33:22.640 --> 33:24.640
into that racial coding

33:24.640 --> 33:26.640
while still also keeping

33:26.640 --> 33:28.640
the racism we have

33:28.640 --> 33:30.640
in the real world, like

33:30.640 --> 33:32.640
between humans, was

33:32.640 --> 33:34.640
the right way to go.

33:34.640 --> 33:36.640
So you note in the examples that work,

33:36.640 --> 33:38.640
like District 9 and Who Framed Roger Rabbit,

33:38.640 --> 33:40.640
not only are the actual plots of these movies

33:40.640 --> 33:42.640
about the exploitation of this underclass

33:42.640 --> 33:44.640
and the direct effects of the systemic oppression,

33:44.640 --> 33:46.640
they are actually clever about how oppression

33:46.640 --> 33:48.640
manifests in these alternate universes.

33:48.640 --> 33:50.640
They have their own in-universe

33:50.640 --> 33:52.640
prejudices and stereotypes.

33:54.640 --> 33:56.640
Tomb Raider.

33:56.640 --> 33:58.640
But now he's a sore shot!

33:58.640 --> 34:00.640
Not a lot runs report, cop.

34:00.640 --> 34:02.640
Jirac

34:02.640 --> 34:04.640
was unblooded, like me,

34:04.640 --> 34:06.640
an orc that nobody cared about.

34:06.640 --> 34:08.640
He united the nine armies

34:08.640 --> 34:10.640
and they defeated the Dark Lord.

34:10.640 --> 34:12.640
Wow. That sounds like kind of

34:12.640 --> 34:14.640
a big deal. Like, the kind of big

34:14.640 --> 34:16.640
deal that, I don't know, might lead to

34:16.640 --> 34:18.640
a totally different, intervening

34:18.640 --> 34:20.640
2,000 years of history?

34:20.640 --> 34:22.640
He was a farmer

34:22.640 --> 34:24.640
who changed the world.

34:24.640 --> 34:26.640
According to The World of Bright, there was

34:26.640 --> 34:28.640
a war of nine races 2,000 years ago

34:28.640 --> 34:30.640
where a Dark Lord was bad

34:30.640 --> 34:32.640
and the orcs supported the Dark Lord.

34:32.640 --> 34:34.640
But then there was an unblooded orc named Jirac

34:34.640 --> 34:36.640
who defected from the Dark Lord,

34:36.640 --> 34:38.640
united the nine races, and led to his defeat.

34:38.640 --> 34:40.640
Regardless of the fact that Jirac

34:40.640 --> 34:42.640
was the hero, everyone points to

34:42.640 --> 34:44.640
this little bit of ancient history as the reason

34:44.640 --> 34:46.640
why orcs are discriminated against in the modern day.

34:46.640 --> 34:48.640
You know what they say,

34:48.640 --> 34:50.640
once with the Dark Lord, always with the Dark Lord.

34:50.640 --> 34:52.640
Let's take a quick look at other fantasy stories

34:52.640 --> 34:54.640
that take place in the modern day.

34:54.640 --> 34:56.640
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

34:56.640 --> 34:58.640
Harry Potter. Underworld.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.640
American Gods. Gargoyles.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.640
All of these have a secret

35:02.640 --> 35:04.640
underworld that exists alongside the world

35:04.640 --> 35:06.640
that we know, and therefore does not contradict it.

35:06.640 --> 35:08.640
This makes Bright unique, but to its detriment.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.640
It never thinks through the implications

35:10.640 --> 35:12.640
of building an alternate history.

35:12.640 --> 35:14.640
Alternate reality stories are relatively

35:14.640 --> 35:16.640
rare compared to secret underworld stories,

35:16.640 --> 35:18.640
but they're not impossible to find.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.640
Bioshock Infinite and Watchmen are popular

35:20.640 --> 35:22.640
alternate reality stories,

35:22.640 --> 35:24.640
but both have relatively recent divergent points

35:24.640 --> 35:26.640
in history, and massively different outcomes.

35:26.640 --> 35:28.640
The point I'm making is that

35:28.640 --> 35:30.640
the 2000 years of backstory all of the characters

35:30.640 --> 35:32.640
make such a huge deal about would have led to

35:32.640 --> 35:34.640
a massively different universe than just

35:34.640 --> 35:36.640
LA with orc homies.

35:36.640 --> 35:38.640
And when people talk about the squandered

35:38.640 --> 35:40.640
potential of Bright, to me this is

35:40.640 --> 35:42.640
the worst part. There is no imagination

35:42.640 --> 35:44.640
put into the history of the world past

35:44.640 --> 35:46.640
the central conceit of a modern setting with

35:46.640 --> 35:48.640
orcs and elves in it. And then when

35:48.640 --> 35:50.640
Ayer rewrote the project, instead of developing

35:50.640 --> 35:52.640
a fully realized world, he had to go ahead

35:52.640 --> 35:54.640
and end up with gritty edginess and

35:54.640 --> 35:56.640
add all that urban gangster flavor.

35:56.640 --> 35:58.640
So you end up with this.

35:58.640 --> 36:00.640
Fairy lives don't matter

36:00.640 --> 36:02.640
today.

36:02.640 --> 36:04.640
So I'm going to ignore

36:04.640 --> 36:06.640
how tone deaf that reference is and just

36:06.640 --> 36:08.640
stick with the inherent implication of the

36:08.640 --> 36:10.640
line. Either Black Lives Matter

36:10.640 --> 36:12.640
exists in the universe, and Ward is

36:12.640 --> 36:14.640
referencing it, or this is

36:14.640 --> 36:16.640
for the benefit of the audience and means to

36:16.640 --> 36:18.640
telegraph that this is a movie about

36:18.640 --> 36:20.640
race. Or it's just a bad ad-lib and

36:20.640 --> 36:22.640
Ayer didn't think through the implication of keeping it in.

36:22.640 --> 36:24.640
Ahem.

36:24.640 --> 36:26.640
Here's a list of things that exist

36:26.640 --> 36:28.640
in the Bright universe.

36:28.640 --> 36:30.640
The Crips. Let's Crip-walk your asses on back

36:30.640 --> 36:32.640
to the barbecue. Shrek.

36:32.640 --> 36:34.640
To take your fat, Shrek-looking

36:34.640 --> 36:36.640
ass. The Alamo.

36:36.640 --> 36:38.640
Hey, don't look at me, man. Mexicans still get shit

36:38.640 --> 36:40.640
for the fucking Alamo. Los Angeles.

36:40.640 --> 36:42.640
Dragons over Los Angeles.

36:42.640 --> 36:44.640
Fairy lives don't matter

36:44.640 --> 36:46.640
today.

36:46.640 --> 36:48.640
Well,

36:48.640 --> 36:50.640
we're gonna go through that point by point.

36:50.640 --> 36:52.640
I'm sorry. I had to.

36:52.640 --> 36:54.640
Bright made me do it.

36:54.640 --> 36:56.640
This fucking movie. Number one, the Crips.

36:56.640 --> 36:58.640
Let's Crip-walk your

36:58.640 --> 37:00.640
asses on back to the barbecue. The history of the Crips

37:00.640 --> 37:02.640
stems from a variety of factors, namely

37:02.640 --> 37:04.640
segregationist housing policies leading up to

37:04.640 --> 37:06.640
World War II and the FBI systemic eradication

37:06.640 --> 37:08.640
of the original Black Panther Party in the late 1960s,

37:08.640 --> 37:10.640
leaving a power vacuum in south-central

37:10.640 --> 37:12.640
LA and a lot of 17-year-olds with

37:12.640 --> 37:14.640
guns. These segregationist housing policies

37:14.640 --> 37:16.640
arose not long after Jim Crow forced many Black

37:16.640 --> 37:18.640
Southerners to immigrate to the west coast in the early

37:18.640 --> 37:20.640
20th century, which directly results

37:20.640 --> 37:22.640
from the diaspora after the Civil War, which

37:22.640 --> 37:24.640
was fought over slavery. Ergo,

37:24.640 --> 37:26.640
it follows that the Atlantic slave

37:26.640 --> 37:28.640
trade existed in the Bright

37:28.640 --> 37:30.640
Universe. Number two, Shrek

37:30.640 --> 37:32.640
exists. To take your fat,

37:32.640 --> 37:34.640
Shrek-looking ass back

37:34.640 --> 37:36.640
to your vehicle and drive the fuck home

37:36.640 --> 37:38.640
to Fiona. Meaning that Jeffrey Katzenberg

37:38.640 --> 37:40.640
exists, and the Disney Company

37:40.640 --> 37:42.640
exists, and it made its bread and butter from

37:42.640 --> 37:44.640
fairy tales, which are just normal tales

37:44.640 --> 37:46.640
in this universe, but okay. Meaning

37:46.640 --> 37:48.640
that Jeffrey Katzenberg was let go from the Disney Company

37:48.640 --> 37:50.640
after 15 years and an acrimonious

37:50.640 --> 37:52.640
multi-million dollar settlement and several lawsuits,

37:52.640 --> 37:54.640
and after several failed attempts at 2D animation,

37:54.640 --> 37:56.640
Dreamworks broke through with its pastiche and version

37:56.640 --> 37:58.640
of fairy tale tropes, Shrek.

37:58.640 --> 38:00.640
The Alamo exists.

38:00.640 --> 38:02.640
Hey, don't look at me, man. Mexicans

38:02.640 --> 38:04.640
still get shit for the fucking Alamo.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.640
Were there orcs there, too?

38:06.640 --> 38:08.640
If there's so much strike between non-human

38:08.640 --> 38:10.640
races, why is there inter-human

38:10.640 --> 38:12.640
racism? Was there chattel slavery of orcs

38:12.640 --> 38:14.640
in addition to black people, and that's why

38:14.640 --> 38:16.640
orcs seem to all have European

38:16.640 --> 38:18.640
white surnames? Was the

38:18.640 --> 38:20.640
Alamo a bigger deal in this universe?

38:20.640 --> 38:22.640
Because Mexican-Americans get shit for a lot of

38:22.640 --> 38:24.640
things. I thought you were out having your, like,

38:24.640 --> 38:26.640
zillionth baby. The Alamo is not

38:26.640 --> 38:28.640
one of those things. What was

38:28.640 --> 38:30.640
the nine races? Were Mexicans

38:30.640 --> 38:32.640
one of the nine races? I see you.

38:32.640 --> 38:34.640
I see you typing those comments about

38:34.640 --> 38:36.640
how I'm overthinking this, and you know,

38:36.640 --> 38:38.640
yeah, it's true, but why are you watching this channel anyway?

38:38.640 --> 38:40.640
But, you know, I can't

38:40.640 --> 38:42.640
help it, and people say

38:42.640 --> 38:44.640
that they're interested in the world-building

38:44.640 --> 38:46.640
of Bright, and I'm like,

38:46.640 --> 38:48.640
there isn't any. It's just

38:48.640 --> 38:50.640
Star World with some

38:50.640 --> 38:52.640
fantasy stuff slapped on top.

38:52.640 --> 38:54.640
Los Angeles exists, meaning a Franciscan

38:54.640 --> 38:56.640
mission settlement was built in the 18th century, meaning

38:56.640 --> 38:58.640
the Catholic Church maintained its dominion over Spain,

38:58.640 --> 39:00.640
meaning the War of Nine Races, a thing that is so

39:00.640 --> 39:02.640
big a deal that in 2,000 years after the fact,

39:02.640 --> 39:04.640
it warrants graffiti, was not such a big deal

39:04.640 --> 39:06.640
that Emperor Constantine couldn't make

39:06.640 --> 39:08.640
Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire

39:08.640 --> 39:10.640
in the 4th century AD.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.640
You cannot include elements

39:12.640 --> 39:14.640
from our real world without importing

39:14.640 --> 39:16.640
the history that comes with them.

39:16.640 --> 39:18.640
I mean, you can, it's just,

39:18.640 --> 39:20.640
you know, it's lazy and it sucks.

39:20.640 --> 39:22.640
This is why modern sci-fi and fantasy

39:22.640 --> 39:24.640
with alternate histories are so rare,

39:24.640 --> 39:26.640
and the ones you do see, like The Man

39:26.640 --> 39:28.640
in the High Castle and Bioshock Infinite,

39:28.640 --> 39:30.640
have relatively recent divergent points

39:30.640 --> 39:32.640
in history. Sure, you could give us an

39:32.640 --> 39:34.640
alternate fantasy past that resulted in a

39:34.640 --> 39:36.640
similar present with cars and stuff,

39:36.640 --> 39:38.640
but the histories can't be the same.

39:38.640 --> 39:40.640
L.A. wouldn't exist, Shrek wouldn't

39:40.640 --> 39:42.640
exist, the crypts wouldn't exist,

39:42.640 --> 39:44.640
it doesn't make sense for there to be racism

39:44.640 --> 39:46.640
against Mexicans or black

39:46.640 --> 39:48.640
people if we're so

39:48.640 --> 39:50.640
bigoted against orcs.

39:50.640 --> 39:52.640
Everywhere I go, live orcs always

39:52.640 --> 39:54.640
gotta be the bad guys.

39:54.640 --> 39:56.640
And elves.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.640
So instead of an organic

39:58.640 --> 40:00.640
world where the history is woven in,

40:00.640 --> 40:02.640
it's just our world with fantasy elements

40:02.640 --> 40:04.640
slapped on top, like magnets

40:04.640 --> 40:06.640
on a fridge.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.640
I know, building an alternate history

40:10.640 --> 40:12.640
and weaving it in would have been difficult.

40:12.640 --> 40:14.640
So they just didn't bother, and

40:14.640 --> 40:16.640
it's just lazy, and it sucks.

40:18.640 --> 40:20.640
We will not be listening to no orcish music.

40:22.640 --> 40:24.640
The whole root of this entire

40:24.640 --> 40:26.640
monstrosity of a video,

40:26.640 --> 40:28.640
of me complaining about Brite

40:28.640 --> 40:30.640
for 45 minutes, which you have

40:30.640 --> 40:32.640
now sat through, good for you, thanks

40:32.640 --> 40:34.640
for that, is because

40:34.640 --> 40:36.640
I could not stop thinking about

40:36.640 --> 40:38.640
this one line

40:38.640 --> 40:40.640
from Sheriff's Deputy

40:40.640 --> 40:42.640
Rodriguez.

40:44.640 --> 40:46.640
No, Rodriguez, they don't.

40:46.640 --> 40:48.640
And it's played as a joke, like we the audience

40:48.640 --> 40:50.640
are supposed to get and understand it.

40:50.640 --> 40:52.640
Like, yes, ha ha ha, we do

40:52.640 --> 40:54.640
give Mexicans shit for the Alamo.

40:54.640 --> 40:56.640
I personally told my neighbor Jorge

40:56.640 --> 40:58.640
to remember it just the other day.

40:58.640 --> 41:00.640
But it reveals both the ignorance and the

41:00.640 --> 41:02.640
incuriosity of the filmmakers.

41:02.640 --> 41:04.640
It understands that movies about racism

41:04.640 --> 41:06.640
win awards,

41:14.640 --> 41:16.640
but has no curiosity to its causes

41:16.640 --> 41:18.640
or its roots. So by reducing

41:18.640 --> 41:20.640
bigotry to single, definable, and justifiable

41:20.640 --> 41:22.640
historical events, like a lot of

41:22.640 --> 41:24.640
the fantasy genre does with its worldbuilding,

41:24.640 --> 41:26.640
reducing bigotry to single,

41:26.640 --> 41:28.640
justifiable, and even understandable conflicts

41:28.640 --> 41:30.640
makes racism feel that much

41:30.640 --> 41:32.640
more reasonable. Logical, even.

41:32.640 --> 41:34.640
Mexicans get shit because of the Alamo.

41:34.640 --> 41:36.640
Orcs get shit because of the

41:36.640 --> 41:38.640
Dark Lord. Racism is bad,

41:38.640 --> 41:40.640
but, you know,

41:40.640 --> 41:42.640
people have legit reasons for being racist.

41:42.640 --> 41:44.640
Like black men

41:44.640 --> 41:46.640
consciously playing into stereotypes.

41:46.640 --> 41:48.640
And the Alamo.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.640
This is a massive shortcoming of movies like

41:50.640 --> 41:52.640
Crash and Brite.

41:52.640 --> 41:54.640
They seek to understand the logic behind

41:54.640 --> 41:56.640
racism, but racism isn't

41:56.640 --> 41:58.640
logical. And you can't logic people

41:58.640 --> 42:00.640
out of a mindset they did not logic

42:00.640 --> 42:02.640
themselves into. Chance the Rapper

42:02.640 --> 42:04.640
commented in a tweet after watching Brite,

42:04.640 --> 42:06.640
I always feel a little cheated when I see allegorical

42:06.640 --> 42:08.640
racism in movies, because that racism usually

42:08.640 --> 42:10.640
stems from human emotion or tolerance,

42:10.640 --> 42:12.640
but not by law or systems the way it is

42:12.640 --> 42:14.640
in real life. The world of this movie

42:14.640 --> 42:16.640
reaches for edgy and topical, but is just lazy

42:16.640 --> 42:18.640
and careless. All it wants is to

42:18.640 --> 42:20.640
import the facade of urban, gangsta

42:20.640 --> 42:22.640
flavor. And the language of bigotry

42:22.640 --> 42:24.640
in these movies is so cartoonish that no

42:24.640 --> 42:26.640
one would see it in themselves.

42:26.640 --> 42:28.640
Dwarfs have mad hops.

42:28.640 --> 42:30.640
This is a popular go-to when trying to capture the

42:30.640 --> 42:32.640
language of casual racism in movies.

42:32.640 --> 42:34.640
The focus on historical events.

42:34.640 --> 42:36.640
The army of nine races fought shoulder

42:36.640 --> 42:38.640
to shoulder to give you the world

42:38.640 --> 42:40.640
you neglect. The focus on affirmative

42:40.640 --> 42:42.640
action. And what happens if they hire more

42:42.640 --> 42:44.640
of them? I can't look at you without thinking

42:44.640 --> 42:46.640
about the five or six more qualified white

42:46.640 --> 42:48.640
men who didn't get your job. What the fuck about

42:48.640 --> 42:50.640
my demeanor gives you the impression

42:50.640 --> 42:52.640
that I want to be a target on the department's

42:52.640 --> 42:54.640
work diversity radar. Yes, white bitterness

42:54.640 --> 42:56.640
about affirmative action and corporate diversity

42:56.640 --> 42:58.640
initiatives is certainly a thing.

42:58.640 --> 43:00.640
But this captures that bitterness poorly because

43:00.640 --> 43:02.640
if you use the actual language of casual racism

43:02.640 --> 43:04.640
you run the risk of offending casual racists

43:04.640 --> 43:06.640
which is a huge demographic.

43:06.640 --> 43:08.640
Tonight's the trifecta. Is that your cousin?

43:08.640 --> 43:10.640
Full moon. Friday night.

43:10.640 --> 43:12.640
Summer heat wave.

43:12.640 --> 43:14.640
So you use the language of cartoon

43:14.640 --> 43:16.640
casual racism and never have to run the risk

43:16.640 --> 43:18.640
of making the audience question whether they are

43:18.640 --> 43:20.640
seeing themselves in the bad guys.

43:20.640 --> 43:22.640
How many orcs play pro basketball?

43:22.640 --> 43:24.640
None. They're slow. They're heavy.

43:24.640 --> 43:26.640
That's why half the NFL defensive lines

43:26.640 --> 43:28.640
are orcish. It's not racism. It's physics.

43:28.640 --> 43:30.640
Reduce the outcome of racism

43:30.640 --> 43:32.640
to a kick me sign and justify

43:32.640 --> 43:34.640
racism and bigotry by pointing to historical

43:34.640 --> 43:36.640
events where entire ethnic groups made

43:36.640 --> 43:38.640
an oopsie daisy. Hey, don't look at me, man.

43:38.640 --> 43:40.640
Mexicans still get shit for the fucking Alamo.

43:40.640 --> 43:42.640
Fantasy world building is always going to be a

43:42.640 --> 43:44.640
reflection of the author's experiences

43:44.640 --> 43:46.640
and you will have blind spots or biases that

43:46.640 --> 43:48.640
will manifest themselves in the work.

43:48.640 --> 43:50.640
The problem isn't just that this world is too close to

43:50.640 --> 43:52.640
our own, so inevitably you can't help but

43:52.640 --> 43:54.640
impose our world logic onto it.

43:54.640 --> 43:56.640
It isn't just that being on the nose with your race

43:56.640 --> 43:58.640
allegory might read as tone deaf.

43:58.640 --> 44:00.640
Fairy lives don't matter today.

44:00.640 --> 44:02.640
And it isn't just that fairy lives don't

44:02.640 --> 44:04.640
matter. Really, it's just

44:04.640 --> 44:06.640
that it's incurious and lazy

44:06.640 --> 44:08.640
but it doesn't want to be.

44:08.640 --> 44:10.640
And that is what makes it disappointing.

44:10.640 --> 44:12.640
Remember when music

44:12.640 --> 44:14.640
sold so well that people would use

44:14.640 --> 44:16.640
it to promote movies? Yes, they do.

44:16.640 --> 44:18.640
Yeah. We're going to make this a franchise.

44:18.640 --> 44:20.640
Okay. We're going to

44:20.640 --> 44:22.640
have a knockoff animated TV show.

44:22.640 --> 44:24.640
It's going to be on Fox on Saturday mornings.

44:24.640 --> 44:26.640
Saturday morning cartoons.

44:26.640 --> 44:28.640
That's still a thing, right?

44:28.640 --> 44:30.640
No.

44:30.640 --> 44:32.640
Yeah.
