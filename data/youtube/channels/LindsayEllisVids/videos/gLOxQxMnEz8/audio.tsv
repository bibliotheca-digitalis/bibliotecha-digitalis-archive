0	13880	The term Oscar bait is relatively new, and although the concept has been around for a
13880	19360	few decades, it was the 78th Academy Awards in 2006 that indirectly popularized the term
19360	31640	outside of film circles into household use.
31640	36240	The 78th Academy Awards became infamous for its best picture winner, as it was an exceptionally
36240	40920	strong year for thoughtful adult dramas, and as far as the nominees went, there was really
40920	49520	only one wrong answer.
49520	54200	Crash beat Brokeback Mountain, Capote, Good Night and Good Luck, and Munich, despite not
54200	58240	winning Best Picture at any other major film awards or even being nominated for Best Picture
58240	59640	at the Golden Globes.
59640	61600	Several lessons were learned that night.
61600	62600	1.
62600	67000	That aggressive, for-your-consideration campaigns work, regardless of merit, and 2.
67000	71060	Meditations on the subject of race that place the root of the problems on flawed individuals
71060	88560	rather than historical, systemic, and structural injustices will win awards.
88560	93000	We have seen this play out time and time again since Crash won Best Picture.
93000	96400	That said, though Crash beating favorite Brokeback Mountain was controversial at the
96400	100360	time, history has only been more unkind to Crash.
100360	105500	Yale professor Xuan Su wrote that Crash imagines racial encounter along the lines of individual
105500	109480	experience of hate and forgiveness without exploring questions of structural inequality
109480	111240	and public redress.
111240	117080	In 2009, writer and cultural critic Ta-Nehisi Coates called it the worst movie of the decade,
117080	118080	stating,
119080	124560	Instead, you have arguments and propaganda violently bumping into each other, impressed
124560	129680	with their own quirkiness, and calling it the apotheosis of a kind of unthinking, incurious,
129680	131680	nihilistic multiculturalism.
160680	165000	There's this narrative that's emerged surrounding Netflix's Bright that audiences
165000	167280	loved it and critics hated it.
167280	170880	It's hard to measure Bright's success against the typical Hollywood release, which measures
170880	172920	success with box-officer turns.
172920	176520	Netflix doesn't release metrics, but according to Nielsen, which has recently started recording
176520	180320	metrics for streaming services, Bright got about 22 million eyeballs.
180320	184960	That is to say, about 11 million people, assuming an average of about two eyeballs per person,
184960	187600	during the first three days of its release.
187640	191520	Assuming every person who watched Bright at home would have paid money to see it in theaters,
191520	196720	that would put it roughly on track with Transformers 4 and just behind Thor Ragnarok.
196720	200720	Very respectable, especially for a non-franchise film, but this again assumes that everyone
200720	204200	who watched Bright in those three days in the comfort of their own homes would have
204200	207080	gone outside into the world and watched it in theaters.
207080	208560	A mighty big jump.
208560	212640	The sub-narrative to this is the conspiracy narrative, which is stupid but has become
212640	215840	part of the discussion and must therefore be addressed.
215840	220320	That big Hollywood is paying off critics to pan Bright because the new model Bright
220320	222480	represents is a huge threat to their revenue.
222480	226600	Which, you know, it kind of is, but you all have got to stop with the conspiracy theories
226600	231680	around critics being paid off because the Hollywood Illuminati are trying to crush your movie.
231680	234400	There is plenty to dislike about Bright.
234400	236920	Fairy lives don't matter today.
236920	240680	It is true that despite the critical reception, Bright could possibly represent a paradigm
240680	245520	shift in filmmaking, away from the focused theatrical experience and towards streaming,
245520	248560	all while not needing to sacrifice big names or budgets.
248560	252480	Netflix took a lot of risks with Bright, and even if this project wasn't the greatest
252480	256320	triumph, it will be interesting to see where they take other projects in the future.
256320	259920	Although I do question their decision not to hire a screenwriter for Bright, and to
259920	264680	go ahead with the project completely screenwriter-less, I don't know, they already ordered a sequel
264680	269200	from Trigger Warning Entertainment, maybe this time they'll hire a screenwriter.
269200	272160	Shit, did I forget to endorse this?
272160	274880	Anyway, if this is your trash, I'm not trying to judge.
274880	279520	I have seen Showgirls dozens of times, and I just released a video defending Twilight.
279520	283400	That said, even though this movie kind of came and went and everyone else has already,
283400	288320	you know, forgotten about it, I cannot stop thinking about Bright.
288320	291360	So we're going to make a thing out of it.
291360	294040	That's right, we're making a thing.
294040	296240	Fairy lives don't matter today.
296280	302800	So, to start, I am going to simply, factually recount the events of the film without commentary,
302800	305200	questions, or asides.
305200	306200	Alright?
306200	307200	Alright.
307200	312360	Credits roll with a variety of shots of an alternate reality Los Angeles, mostly consisting
312360	316960	of orc graffiti mentioning a dark lord and orc antipathy towards the police.
316960	321280	The story proper opens with street cop Ward, played by Will Smith, getting shot by an orc
321280	325520	robbing a bodega while his partner Jacoby, also an orc, buys him a burrito.
325520	329120	But to some time later, Ward has recovered, his wife tells him that there is a fairy in
329120	331280	the bird feeder, she wants him to kill it.
331280	335640	He goes outside, criticizes his neighbors for playing into gangsta stereotypes, says
335640	336640	this
336640	338680	Fairy lives don't matter today.
338680	340560	And crushes the fairy to death with a broom.
340560	343640	Upstairs, Ward explains to his daughter that racism is bad.
343640	347240	All of the races are different, okay?
347240	350840	And just because they're different doesn't mean anybody's smarter.
350840	355240	Jacoby shows up to offer Ward a ride to work, embarrassing Ward in front of his neighbors.
355240	358520	On the way to work, Ward continues to be a jerk to Jacoby, blaming him for getting
358520	362120	shot, and Jacoby suggests that the root of Ward's racism against him is that he isn't
362120	363120	getting laid.
363120	366880	They drive through an elf district, Ward complains some more, nothing happens, and then they
366880	368040	continue to work.
368040	371920	In the locker room, Ward's co-workers all make bigoted remarks about Jacoby, and justify
371920	379640	their bigotry by the fact that the orcs had sided with the Dark Lord 2,000 years ago.
379640	382960	During assignment, Ward is assigned to partner with Jacoby, he complains to Margaret Cho
383160	385360	who blames the orc diversity department.
385360	388440	Jacoby has a kick me sign on his back, his co-workers laugh at him.
388440	390680	While on the beat, Ward yells at Jacoby over nothing.
390680	394800	They get a call because of a crazy sword-wielding dirty man who mentions a Dark Lord returning.
394800	401600	They joke with Sheriff's Deputy Rodriguez about their shared struggles with racism.
401600	402960	They take in the dirty man.
402960	405660	Dirty man tells Jacoby and Orcish that Ward is special.
405660	409640	Back at the station, Internal Affairs goads Ward into forcing Jacoby to admit that he
409640	412840	had intentionally let the perp go because they're both orcs.
412840	417120	The Magic Task Force, aka the Magic Feds, show up and reveal that the dirty man is in
417120	418800	a group called Shield of Light.
418800	422600	They talk about a group of renegade elves called the Inferni, who need three magic wands
422600	424920	in order to resurrect the Dark Lord.
424920	428840	He explains that most Brights are elves, but humans can be Brights too, if only one in
428840	433360	a million.
433360	437840	Ward and Jacoby get called to a shootout where they find a bunch of supernatural death, this,
437840	442160	and a fragile kick-ass waif named Tika with a magic wand who appears not to speak English.
442160	445960	The Enforcement show up, put the magic wand in a bag, and tell Ward that he needs to go
445960	450800	outside now and murder Jacoby, or the corrupt cops will kill both of them.
450800	455200	Ward goes outside, accuses Jacoby of letting the orc perp go, and Jacoby admits that he
455200	459600	did let the perp go, but only because he realizes he'd chased down the wrong kid after losing
459600	461440	the real shooter in the crowd.
461440	464880	Inside the house, the corrupt cops decide to kill Ward, Jacoby, and Tika no matter what
464880	466040	Ward does.
466040	471400	They go outside, tell Ward it's time, and Ward turns around and murders all four of
471400	472400	them.
472400	476280	Another group of gangsters show up, led by a guy named Poison, declare that the wand
476280	482120	belongs to the Barrio, they escape, run into an invisible wall, have a terrible slow-mo
482120	486120	car crash, which they then walk away from with no apparent injuries.
486120	489200	Inferni leader Layla arrives with her Inferni at the original scene.
489200	493060	They murder an entire Spanish-speaking family of witnesses, including a baby, and begin
493060	495240	the hunt for Ward, Jacoby, and Tika.
495240	500920	Ward and Jacoby hide, are discovered by Poison's gang, one of them grabs the wand, and explodes.
501920	505120	This is what happens to non-Brites who touch magic wands.
505120	510120	They escape, hide in a strip club, where they are found yet again by Poison's gang.
510120	513960	A gunfight is about to commence, but then the Inferni show up and kill everyone, while
513960	516120	failing to capture Ward and Jacoby.
516120	520040	Ward and Jacoby escape, talk about their feelings in a gas station bathroom while Layla whimpers
520040	521040	in the corner.
521040	523720	Ward calls Rodriguez, who demands to see the wand.
523720	527600	He calls the magic feds, but the Inferni are tapping the phone lines and cut the line with
527600	528800	an axe.
528800	533240	Rodriguez cuffs them for their own safety, and is then shot and killed by the Inferni.
533240	536760	Another fight scene, Ward, Jacoby, and Tika escape yet again, only to be captured by a
536760	537760	gang of orcs.
537760	543680	Take your fat Shrek looking ass back to your vehicle and drive the fuck home to Fiona.
543680	547040	The leader explains that he's angry that they brought guns into that first club they
547040	551160	escaped into, demands the wand, beats them, and then stabs Jacoby.
551160	558760	He orders his son, Mikey, Mikey the Orc, to shoot Jacoby, but then wouldn't you know,
558760	561840	it's the kid Jacoby let go, and he can't kill him.
561840	564200	So his dad shoots Jacoby instead.
564200	568480	But Tika rips the wand from her skin, revealing her Brightlyhood, and resurrects Jacoby while
568480	571080	the orcs… let her.
571080	573840	The orcs kneel, and then they are allowed to leave without a word.
573840	582080	Ward chastises Tika for not letting them know she is a Bright, or that she can speak English.
582080	585720	She tells them that the Inferni plan to restore the Dark Lord to power, using the wand has
585720	590480	crippled her, she's dying, and Jacoby, grateful for her saving his life, convinces Ward to
590480	592680	take her back to the house where they found her.
592680	597280	The Inferni are waiting for them, another fight scene, Jacoby shoots Layla, Ward brings
597280	599160	Tika to the pool of healing.
599160	607080	Layla somehow survives her shooting, hangs Jacoby, this happens, Jacoby shoots the wand
607080	609720	out of Layla's hand, but runs out of ammo.
609720	615120	Ward grabs the wand, surprise surprise, he is a Bright.
615120	619840	Jacoby tells him the magic word, and he defeats Layla.
619840	623160	Jacoby tries to get them outside the burning house, when he realizes Ward didn't follow
623160	626280	him, he goes back into the burning building and rescues him.
626280	630560	The orcs that were going to kill them earlier respect him now.
630560	639520	After all that, Ward says this, they explain their side of the story to the magic feds
639520	640600	in the hospital.
640600	645480	The magic feds take the wand, at the memorial for Rodriguez and the four cops Ward murdered,
645480	655080	they see Tika in the crowd, a fairy flies at the camera, the end.
655080	660480	So this is not a book of Henry situation, this is not a concept so squirrely that only
660480	663600	a complete change of genre would have salvaged it.
663600	667440	Obviously there were huge problems with the screenplay, but nothing that a couple of rewrites
667440	668640	couldn't have fixed.
668640	671920	In the broadest of strokes, there's nothing fundamentally wrong with the premise or the
671920	672920	story itself.
672920	676960	A fantasy setting that resembles our modern universe, with the central characters as two
676960	681160	cops of different fantasy races that don't like each other, but have to learn to work
681160	686160	together when they come into possession of what is effectively a weapon of mass destruction.
686160	690520	You could just as easily imagine the two cops as Legolas and Gimli, and that could make
690520	692120	for a fun unique romp.
692120	695720	And it's also not like the elements weren't in place to make it work, specifically with
695720	696840	the two mains.
697040	699240	Smith and Edgerton actually have great chemistry.
699240	700240	No holes?
700240	701240	Huh?
701240	703240	Uh, only the ones that I was born with.
704240	705240	How are your holes?
706240	708240	The fuck can you make a shootout awkward?
708240	713240	Ward is a garden variety jerk who disrespects Jacoby, who happens to be an awkward dork.
713240	716240	I thought it'd be nice to get me a ride on your first date.
716240	719240	But through shared hardship, they learn to value each other.
719240	722240	A modern take on a traditional fantasy trope.
722640	725640	Who thought I'd die fighting side by side with an elf?
726640	728640	What about side by side with a friend?
730640	734640	This dynamic doesn't live up to its potential because of the poor plotting and character
734640	735640	development.
735640	738640	Again, why didn't they hire a screenwriter?
738640	739640	Weird.
739640	742640	But you can see the intent there in a lot of their interactions.
742640	747640	I used to be like you, thinking save everybody and fix everything.
748640	751640	Now I just pretend to be a good dude.
752040	755040	The glut of action scenes is a problem because much of these fight scenes with the Inferni
755040	757040	don't advance anything.
757040	762040	Several times they are in danger, escape, exposit some while Lulu cowers, more danger,
762040	763040	they escape, repeat.
763040	768040	They gain nothing, lose nothing, and learn nothing for nearly an hour of the film's
768040	771040	runtime until Tikka saves Jacoby using the wand.
771040	775040	This should have been the midpoint of the film, not the end of Act 2 as it isn't a
775040	776040	final product.
776040	780040	And the second half of Act 2 should have been built around these three building a dynamic
780440	784440	and learning to trust each other and care about each other, giving us, the audience,
784440	789440	the chance to care about her before she starts dying, and about Jacoby and Ward's dynamic.
790440	794440	If Tikka were to begin trusting Ward and Jacoby during the midpoint, they could have developed
794440	799440	a rapport, and rather than her overextending herself with the wand being potentially fatal,
799440	803440	a plot point which makes no sense because this doesn't happen to any other wand users,
803440	807440	maybe have her be fatally injured in some other way later, and then, the audience having
807840	810840	now built up some emotional investment in these characters, Ward and Jacoby spend the
810840	814840	third act trying to save her, cue the climax, the end.
814840	819840	My point is, it wouldn't have been that hard to bring this up to the level of...
819840	821840	okay.
821840	825840	A lot of the worldbuilding is clumsily explained by characters that have nothing to do with
825840	827840	the narrative, like this guy.
827840	832840	You ever notice how most brides are elves, and elves run the world?
832840	833840	Coincidence?
834240	839240	Yeah, we never see him again after this scene, and organic worldbuilding that isn't exposition
839240	843240	word-dumped from characters that are relevant to the plot comes at the cost of unnecessarily
843240	847240	long action scenes that take up so much of the film's runtime.
847240	848240	But this movie is gritty.
848240	854240	See, it needs to reflect harsh truths about racism in LA.
854240	856240	You know, like Crash did.
856240	860240	Look at all that urban gangsta flavor.
860640	862640	Ahhhhhhhhhhh
867640	871640	A major symptom of these structure problems comes in the form of the poor execution of
871640	873640	setup and payoff.
873640	876640	The trip to Elftown at the beginning is a setup that never pays off.
876640	879640	They go to Elftown, Elftown is set up.
879640	881840	It is a huge pointed setup.
881840	887840	Ain't nothing over here but rich-ass elves just running the world and shopping.
888240	892640	Not only do they never go back to Elftown again, Elftown isn't even mentioned.
892640	895160	Also they couldn't find a better name for it than Elftown?
895160	898640	Like Beverly Hills isn't called WEALTHTOWN.
898640	900160	Also where the fuck is this supposed to be?
900160	904640	It looks like downtown LA but Beverly Hills is like 10 miles away.
904640	905640	Nevermind.
905640	910640	The fact that Ward has a loving family totally undermines the character they're going for.
910640	913640	You don't want me as a friend.
914440	915440	Yeah.
915440	920440	Cause besides taking out the fairy LAPD style, you seem to be doing alright.
920440	927840	You have a loving family, a daughter you care for, a wife who makes you coffee with napkins
927840	929440	and you joke around with.
934440	936440	Made doubly confusing by this line.
944440	947440	Physical love.
947440	952440	A relic from an earlier draft of the script where Ward was estranged from his wife.
952440	956440	But if they were going to give Ward a nice wife and give them a happy relationship, then
956440	958440	they probably should have cut this exchange.
958440	961440	And the setup of the family pays off not at all.
961440	965440	All it does is undermine the badass loner thing they're trying to go for with Ward.
965440	969440	It is a weak incentive for him to maybe betray Jacoby, maybe for a little bit.
969440	973440	But really, why does he even have a wife and daughter?
974240	977240	They get the family out of danger immediately, and then the family only comes back at the
977240	978240	very end.
978240	984240	If you want to play up this I'm a bad dude with no friends angle, don't give him a family.
984240	989240	These are wasted story elements in a story with already way too much clumsy, inorganic
989240	990240	worldbuilding.
990240	991240	Poison's gang, for instance.
991240	994240	They are never mentioned again after the Titty Bar shootout.
994240	996240	We gonna Titty Bar gunfight die.
996240	1000240	Which wouldn't be so bad if there had been some growth or development during the previous
1001040	1004040	three shootouts with Poison's gang, but there isn't.
1007040	1013040	All we get is that this is what happens when a non-bright touches a wand, a thing that
1013040	1018040	we already knew, and the orcs getting mad at the trio as justification to capture them
1018040	1022040	and shoot Jacoby later, a plot point which is really weak.
1022040	1026240	These three spend a full half hour of the film on the run from Poison's gang, who
1026240	1030040	does not matter, and has nothing to do with the plot.
1030840	1034840	Moreover, no one seems to care that even if they get this magic wand, they cannot use it.
1034840	1039840	Perhaps the worst failure of setup and payoff is that Mikey the orc, the kid whom Jacoby
1039840	1044840	helped escape earlier, that we meet later in the orc hideout, at first you're like
1044840	1046840	hey some setup that was paid off.
1046840	1049840	Jacoby's mercy and good deeds saves him.
1049840	1054840	But then Mikey's dad shoots Jacoby anyway, and Tika has to use the wand to resurrect him.
1055640	1060640	So this setup, the fact that Jacoby showed Mikey mercy, is of no consequence.
1060640	1064640	There is no meaningful outcome to Jacoby showing this kid mercy.
1064640	1066640	He gets shot either way.
1066640	1068640	Bad setup and payoff.
1068640	1073640	And once again, in the earlier draft of the script, Mikey the orc actually did spare Jacoby.
1073640	1078640	But in the David Ayer rewrite, it was decided that apparently that wasn't dramatic enough.
1078640	1083640	And as in the example with the estranged wife, they kept the setup where the payoff no longer makes sense.
1084440	1088440	I started with the focus on structure because flawed though it is, the story is there and
1088440	1091440	this could have easily been fixed in the screenplay stage.
1091440	1093440	This could have worked.
1093440	1096440	But really, the devil is in the details.
1102440	1107440	A major part of film editing is just as much deciding what to cut out as what to keep in.
1107440	1110440	Elements in a story need narrative utility.
1111240	1113240	Let's examine a scene. Ward kills the fairy.
1113240	1116240	What narrative purpose does this serve?
1116240	1118240	Fairies in this universe appear to be pests.
1118240	1123240	Which is fine, but either way, Ward's solution is cruel and inhumane.
1123240	1127240	So from a narrative utility standpoint, either it is trying to demonstrate Ward's antipathy
1127240	1131240	towards fantasy things, or it is setting up Ward as a blood psychopath.
1133240	1135240	Here's why neither of these things work.
1135240	1139240	One, in-universe, magic is seen as separate from all things normal.
1140040	1143040	That's whatever you want.
1143040	1148040	The magic wand is magic, but that doesn't mean that orcs, elves, humans, or fairies are.
1148040	1150040	They just exist in this universe and they share it.
1150040	1152040	Therefore, humans aren't necessarily separate from it.
1152040	1155040	They are just another race in this world.
1155040	1157040	Like they are in The Lord of the Rings.
1157040	1161040	So using this as setup as Ward magic hater doesn't work because the fairy is just another
1161040	1163040	non-magical element in this universe.
1163040	1166040	Number two, is it setting up Ward as a blood psychopath?
1166840	1169840	Well, he's kind of a jerk, but he isn't exceptionally cruel after this scene.
1169840	1174840	He drops his four corrupt colleagues because he correctly assumes they are about to kill
1174840	1175840	both of them.
1175840	1179840	Either way, we never see him abusing his power in relation to relative powerlessness,
1179840	1182840	as it relates to him killing what is in this universe effectively an animal.
1182840	1186840	So he doesn't grow from this, learn to be more kind to the powerless,
1186840	1188840	nor is it foreshadowing some other cruelty.
1188840	1193840	Like imagine if this movie had begun with Ward instead killing like a rat or a raccoon
1193840	1195840	or a cat or something in the same manner.
1196640	1197640	Yikes, we might say.
1197640	1199640	Not a good dude.
1199640	1201640	This must be going somewhere.
1201640	1202640	But it doesn't.
1202640	1203640	It's what I do.
1203640	1205640	And this isn't about Will Smith being mean.
1205640	1209640	It's about nobody acts like a person in this movie.
1209640	1214640	The worst offender is the climactic scene in which Ward discovers that he is a bright.
1214640	1218640	Everyone is beaten up pretty badly, and then Layla starts with this.
1218640	1221640	What have you done to my sister?
1221640	1223640	What have you done to her?
1223640	1228640	Which neither sets up anything nor pays off anything or relates to anything that we've learned about the Inferni.
1228640	1231640	And don't start with it setting up extended universe crap.
1231640	1235640	Jacoby breaks free of being hung, shoots the wand out of Layla's hand,
1235640	1238640	and then Ward starts like sassing him.
1238640	1242640	Nick, if you were aiming at the wand, that was a really good shot.
1242640	1244640	But shoot her in her head!
1244640	1250640	And nobody is like moving or hiding or trying to defend themselves as they might be doing in a tense shootout.
1250640	1252640	And Jacoby moves to shoot her again, but...
1252640	1254640	I can't. I'm out.
1254640	1259640	He says this like he's got a headache and he just realizes he left his aspirin at home.
1259640	1262640	And all of these characters are within about ten feet of each other.
1262640	1266640	Nothing is stopping Layla from lunging for the wand with her other not-blown-off hand,
1266640	1268640	or Jacoby from bum-rushing her.
1268640	1271640	And it takes like a full minute for Ward to grab that wand.
1271640	1273640	And then he gets it and he's like,
1273640	1275640	What do I do?
1275640	1277640	Hey Nick, I got the wand!
1277640	1278640	What now?
1278640	1280640	And still nobody's moving?
1280640	1282640	Like, they're still in their spots.
1282640	1285640	Like, well, they can't move or that would ruin the blocking.
1285640	1289640	The unkillable Layla doesn't even stand up when Leeloo tells Ward the magic word.
1289640	1291640	The war word is Vaequaras.
1291640	1293640	Dracarys.
1295640	1297640	And in the time it takes him to process this,
1297640	1300640	Layla still could have grabbed it from him, but she doesn't.
1300640	1301640	She stays put.
1301640	1305640	Like, you know, we couldn't have set up the magic word before this scene somehow.
1305640	1308640	This scene is just astonishing in how much it doesn't work from every angle.
1308640	1313640	Because no one acts like a person who is in danger.
1313640	1314640	I'm out.
1314640	1317640	But it's Tika who stands out as the biggest problem character development-wise,
1317640	1322640	as there's never any reason for Ward or Jacoby or the audience to be emotionally invested in her.
1322640	1325640	There's no reason for her to withhold that she speaks English as long as she does.
1325640	1328640	She speaks English pretty good now, too.
1328640	1329640	Now I trust you.
1329640	1331640	Or her brightly-hood.
1331640	1333640	Or to follow them around as long as she does,
1333640	1335640	if no trust or emotional bond has been built up.
1335640	1337640	By the end of the movie, when she's dying,
1337640	1340640	neither Ward nor Jacoby nor the audience have any reason to care about her.
1340640	1345640	Tika acting like a weird child alien is, yep, you guessed it,
1345640	1349640	a relic from an earlier draft where she was a literal elf child,
1349640	1351640	and that's why they were carting her around.
1351640	1354640	So I guess when they added the titty-bar gunfight,
1354640	1356640	We're gonna titty-bar gunfight die.
1356640	1358640	that means they couldn't have Tika be a literal child anymore.
1358640	1363640	So they aged her up to like a 25-year-old, but changed literally nothing else.
1363640	1365640	But Tika is emblematic of the bigger problem with the film
1365640	1367640	as it ties into theme and world-building.
1367640	1369640	She's just poorly thought out.
1369640	1371640	She's just as much a MacGuffin as the wand is.
1371640	1375640	When she is deigned the thinnest of backstories, it is pure function.
1376640	1378640	You're gonna need to unfuck this.
1378640	1381640	No motivation, no emotional core, nothing.
1381640	1386640	Her defection from the Inferni is motivated by nothing other than Dark Lord bad,
1386640	1389640	but we never have any idea of who she is,
1389640	1391640	so there's never any reason to care about her.
1391640	1394640	The only character who even consistently comes close to acting like a person
1394640	1397640	with pathos and motivations is Jacoby.
1397640	1399640	Hey, Sophia, what's up, rockstar?
1399640	1402640	So, like Crash feels like it was written by space aliens
1402640	1404640	trying to understand why humans are racist,
1404640	1408640	You get on your knees and suck my motherfucking dick while you're down there!
1408640	1410640	so too it applies to Bright.
1410640	1413640	To paraphrase Ta-Nehisi Coates' comments on Crash,
1413640	1415640	I don't think there is a single human being in Bright,
1415640	1418640	except for, arguably, the Orc.
1418640	1420640	Both Crash and Bright reach to capture a truth,
1420640	1422640	but capture nothing,
1422640	1426640	because it fails utterly to capture the way people talk and think and act,
1426640	1428640	or how systems work within a society.
1428640	1429640	Man, you know what they say,
1429640	1431640	once with the Dark Lord, always with the Dark Lord.
1431640	1433640	Now, this normally wouldn't be that noteworthy.
1433640	1436640	It would just be a premise with lots of potential
1436640	1439640	that unfortunately led to a bad movie.
1440640	1443640	But then Bright had to go and make Bright's self about race.
1443640	1444640	I said, Orcs ain't cops.
1444640	1445640	He said, now we are.
1445640	1448640	Then he went outside into his Audi car.
1448640	1451640	The intellectual grandfather of the type of fantasy shown in Bright
1451640	1452640	is J.R.R. Tolkien,
1452640	1455640	whose works directly influenced all contemporary fantasy
1455640	1459640	from Dungeons and Dragons to Willow to Skyrim to Bright.
1459640	1461640	Lord of the Rings is also a launching point of discussion
1461640	1463640	as it pertains to allegory and racial coding
1463640	1465640	as it applies to works of fantasy.
1465640	1467640	Many over the years have pointed to The Lord of the Rings
1467640	1470640	as an obvious allegory for, for instance, World War II,
1470640	1472640	a claim which Tolkien virulently denied,
1472640	1475640	stating in a preface to a reprint of Fellowship of the Ring,
1475640	1478640	I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations,
1478640	1479640	and always have done so
1479640	1482640	since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence.
1482640	1483640	Tolkien's attitude was that
1483640	1485640	if people are going to read allegory and do his work,
1485640	1487640	fine, have a party,
1487640	1489640	but not to assume that he intended any to be there.
1489640	1491640	He drew from history, yes,
1491640	1494640	but he wasn't making an intentional statement about it.
1494640	1495640	Now the thing is, Tolkien, of course,
1495640	1497640	existed in, absorbed, and reproduced
1497640	1499640	the colonialist worldview of his day.
1499640	1501640	No, I don't think he did it on purpose,
1501640	1503640	but I also don't think it occurred to him
1503640	1505640	to question the implications of making
1505640	1508640	the dark-skinned races of men side with Sauron.
1508640	1510640	I'm not saying Tolkien was a bad guy,
1510640	1512640	I'm just saying he was a man of his time,
1512640	1514640	and critical race theory didn't really exist yet.
1514640	1516640	However, it is also important to differentiate between
1516640	1518640	allegory, story elements that are meant to have
1518640	1521640	a one-to-one correlation with something outside of the story,
1521640	1524640	for instance, Aslan in the Narnia books as Christ allegory,
1524640	1528640	or Animal Farm as allegory for totalitarian communism,
1528640	1530640	and, of course, there's Mother,
1530640	1532640	which is the rare modern movie that is just
1532640	1534640	oops, all allegory.
1534640	1536640	I gave you everything!
1536640	1538640	Allegory is not the same as coding,
1538640	1540640	Why don't you get a haircut with your bitch ass?
1540640	1542640	which lifts elements from the real world
1542640	1544640	to provide a shorthand message based on
1544640	1546640	the presumed worldview of the audience,
1546640	1548640	i.e., the aliens in Avatar being coded
1548640	1550640	as indigenous as shorthand for them being
1550640	1552640	more pure and in touch with nature.
1552640	1554640	And again, coding is one of those terms
1554640	1556640	that has become politicized and is often
1556640	1558640	read as negative when, in fact,
1558640	1560640	it is a neutral term in academia.
1560640	1562640	It describes a sociological phenomenon.
1562640	1564640	Coding is a neutral term.
1564640	1567640	Allegory exists as a statement of authorial intent.
1567640	1570640	Coding may or may not even be a conscious choice.
1570640	1571640	Ah!
1571640	1573640	With stories made by and for humans,
1573640	1575640	there is always coding.
1575640	1577640	There's especially coding in fantasy worlds
1577640	1578640	derived from the worlds of Tolkien.
1578640	1580640	Some that were there in the books.
1580640	1582640	His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
1582640	1584640	Some that weren't.
1584640	1586640	And on some levels, this is kind of inescapable
1586640	1588640	because it's basically impossible to create
1588640	1590640	fantasy races that aren't at least a little bit
1590640	1592640	derived from the author's perception of human cultures.
1592640	1595640	Humans have a natural in-group, out-group mentality
1595640	1597640	and we've divvied ourselves up
1597640	1599640	into lots and lots of groups.
1599640	1601640	So, cultural and racial coding
1601640	1603640	sneaks into stories, intentional or not.
1603640	1605640	If we look at Skyrim, for example,
1605640	1608640	we have the Nords, who are a coded Scandinavian mishmash.
1612640	1614640	We also have the race of the Khajiit.
1614640	1616640	Here we have a race of nomadic cat people
1616640	1618640	with these accents.
1618640	1620640	Much snow in Skyrim.
1620640	1622640	Enough snow.
1622640	1624640	I does not want anymore.
1624640	1626640	They also make very good thieves.
1626640	1628640	They like their skooma.
1628640	1630640	Yeah, yeah, they're Romani.
1630640	1632640	They're Romani. They're cat Romani. We get it.
1632640	1634640	You with one of the trade caravans, Khajiit?
1634640	1637640	Your kind always seems to find trouble.
1637640	1639640	And then, of course, there are orcs.
1639640	1641640	Written variations on orcs have been around
1641640	1643640	in English folklore as far back as Beowulf.
1643640	1646640	But it was Tolkien who collated the modern idea of the orc.
1646640	1648640	Tolkien described his orcs as
1648640	1650640	corruptions of the human form.
1650640	1652640	Squat, broad, flat-nosed,
1652640	1655640	sallow-skinned, with wide mouths and slant eyes.
1655640	1657640	In fact, degraded and repulsive versions
1657640	1659640	of the, to Europeans,
1659640	1661640	least lovely Mongol types.
1661640	1663640	Nice.
1663640	1665640	The works of Tolkien influenced Dungeons and Dragons,
1665640	1667640	which influenced Warhammer,
1667640	1669640	which influenced World of Warcraft,
1669640	1671640	which influenced the Elder Scrolls games,
1671640	1672640	which influenced Bright.
1672640	1674640	Orcs in all of these absorb coding
1674640	1676640	from ethnic groups from across the world,
1676640	1678640	from ancient Celts, to Scots,
1678640	1680640	to the Zulu, and, of course,
1680640	1682640	the least lovely Mongol types.
1682640	1684640	So while some fantasy fans want to suggest
1684640	1686640	that fantasy races sprung fully formed
1686640	1689640	from the forehead of Zeus with no real-world influences,
1689640	1691640	Bright isn't completely off the mark
1691640	1693640	by applying racial coding to its orcs.
1693640	1695640	And in a perverse way, there is something
1695640	1697640	cogent about Bright putting its orcs in chains
1697640	1699640	and sports jerseys and do-rags
1699640	1701640	and wearing baseball caps with the name
1701640	1703640	of their gang lovingly embroidered on the front
1703640	1705640	just like real gangs do.
1705640	1708640	Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
1708640	1709620	According to Tolkien,
1709620	1711640	I think that many confuse applicability
1711640	1713640	with allegory, but the one resides
1713640	1715640	in the freedom of the reader and the other
1715640	1717640	in the proposed domination of the author.
1717640	1719640	In other words, for something to be considered allegorical,
1719640	1721640	there needs to be authorial intent.
1721640	1723640	And authors can't really help it if people
1723640	1725640	read into their work something that they did
1725640	1726640	not intend.
1726640	1728640	But coding does not require authorial intent.
1729640	1731640	Coding is often careless or unintentional,
1731640	1733640	born from reappropriating tropes
1733640	1735640	without delving into the history of why they're even there
1735640	1736640	in the first place.
1736640	1738640	Missy called John John Binks.
1738640	1739640	Missy, your humble servant.
1739640	1741640	Coding in Bright is way too on the nose
1741640	1743640	to be ignorant, but it certainly
1743640	1744640	raises questions.
1744640	1746640	Can racial coding in science fiction
1746640	1748640	and fantasy used to make some
1748640	1750640	one-to-one
1750640	1752640	allegory about interracial
1752640	1754640	relationships ever actually
1754640	1755640	work?
1755640	1757640	One observation that's kind of flown under the radar
1757640	1759640	is the comparison of Bright to the
1759640	1761640	almost identical 1988 film Alien
1761640	1763640	Nation, which has a very similar premise
1763640	1765640	right down to the first alien
1765640	1767640	cop in the LAPD, played by
1767640	1769640	Mandy Patinkin, and the aliens as
1769640	1771640	thinly veiled allegories for black and hispanic
1771640	1772640	communities in LA.
1772640	1774640	Why do we have to take them?
1774640	1776640	Why can't they go to Russia or someplace like that?
1776640	1778640	A list of newcomer informants is about
1778640	1780640	as long as a list of Mexican war
1780640	1782640	heroes. Hey! Hey! Come on.
1782640	1784640	Nobody talks to nobody down there.
1784640	1786640	And half of them don't even speak English.
1786640	1788640	That movie also sucks. But Alien Nation
1788640	1790640	has one crucial difference, as does
1790640	1792640	District 9. The aliens are
1792640	1794640	relative newcomers to this universe, and
1794640	1796640	therefore they don't conflict with the rest of history
1796640	1798640	as we, the audience, knows it.
1798640	1800640	Now, District 9 is controversial because
1800640	1802640	it does some of the things that Bright does,
1802640	1804640	namely using aliens as an allegory for
1804640	1806640	racial injustice. It's also gotten huge pushback
1806640	1808640	for its portrayal of the Nigerian gangsters,
1808640	1810640	and I'm not going to disagree with that.
1810640	1812640	But while District 9 is far from perfect,
1812640	1814640	I'm going to quickly point out where I think it succeeds
1814640	1816640	and its allegory where Bright fails.
1816640	1818640	1. The aliens are alien, and with the
1818640	1820640	exception of Christopher Johnson, largely
1820640	1822640	incomprehensible.
1822640	1824640	Yes, there is racial coding woven in because
1824640	1826640	there always is, but they aren't wearing do-rags
1826640	1828640	and chains and sports jerseys.
1828640	1830640	God damn it, Bright!
1830640	1832640	2. Our history and the movie's history diverge like
1832640	1834640	20 years earlier. The recently divergent
1834640	1836640	history means that interhuman racism
1836640	1838640	was allowed to develop and thrive and does not
1838640	1840640	feel out of place in this universe the way
1840640	1842640	it does in Bright. 3. You spend a lot of time
1842640	1844640	with Christopher Johnson and see the actual shit
1844640	1846640	he and his family live under, and it's not just
1846640	1848640	stupid lip service like a
1848640	1850640	kick-me sign at work. 4. District 9 does
1850640	1852640	not pussyfoot around what it thinks is a cute
1852640	1854640	metaphor. It does not place the blame of
1854640	1856640	racism on flawed individuals, but rather
1856640	1858640	on vast systems in which individuals
1858640	1860640	are willingly complicit because they
1860640	1862640	benefit from those systems. But
1862640	1864640	perhaps the most applicable comparison to Bright
1864640	1866640	is who framed Roger Rabbit.
1866640	1868640	What could have possibly happened to you
1868640	1870640	to turn you into such a sourpuss?
1870640	1872640	You wanna know?
1872640	1874640	I'll tell you.
1874640	1876640	A toon killed my brother.
1876640	1878640	A toon? No!
1878640	1880640	First of all, sometimes it is actually better to just not
1880640	1882640	explain how we got here. Roger Rabbit
1882640	1884640	never explains the history of how toons came
1884640	1886640	to be, and to be clear, that is a good
1886640	1888640	thing, because we do not need it in this
1888640	1890640	story. It's also a clever reflection on
1890640	1892640	how black entertainers were valued as commodities
1892640	1894640	in the 1940s. In
1894640	1896640	many instances, not even allowed to be
1896640	1898640	patrons in some establishments in which
1898640	1900640	they themselves were headliners.
1900640	1902640	Toon review. Strictly
1902640	1904640	humans only, okay? But the most
1904640	1906640	important facet of who framed Roger Rabbit
1906640	1908640	is that the plot of the corporate scheme to
1908640	1910640	bulldoze Toontown is perfectly interwoven
1910640	1912640	with both the themes of the toons as an
1912640	1914640	exploited underclass and with the protagonist's
1914640	1916640	own internal conflict and nascent
1916640	1918640	anti-toon racism. So when you
1918640	1920640	look at the above examples, especially Roger
1920640	1922640	Rabbit, the laziness of the world-building
1922640	1924640	and allegory in Bright comes into sharp
1924640	1926640	focus. Racism is bad,
1926640	1928640	orcs are oppressed, now here's a movie
1928640	1930640	about some cops playing keep-away-with-a-magic-wand
1930640	1932640	for 90 minutes. Really, a lot of these
1932640	1934640	problems could have been avoided if they hadn't taken
1934640	1936640	a poorly thought-out fantasy-based
1936640	1938640	alternate reality of our own world and used
1938640	1940640	it to make a comment on the tragedy of modern
1940640	1942640	racial relations. And the
1942640	1944640	real irony is if you look at earlier drafts
1944640	1946640	of the script, they're not really there.
1946640	1948640	The hacky lines about the Alamo,
1948640	1950640	words like gangbanger and
1950640	1952640	homies, those appear to be
1952640	1954640	Ayer additions. And playing up
1954640	1956640	those elements only makes the movie make
1956640	1958640	less sense. Like the master race
1958640	1960640	of elves here means nothing because the baddies
1960640	1962640	are outliers. It drops this
1962640	1964640	very juicy idea that this is a very
1964640	1966640	vertical society and then does nothing with
1966640	1968640	it, and it ends up meaning nothing to the world.
1968640	1970640	More to the point, the plot itself,
1970640	1972640	keep-the-magic-wand-away-from-Layla,
1972640	1974640	has fuck-all to do with the
1974640	1976640	oppression of orcs or Mexicans
1976640	1978640	or whoever. The entire first act
1978640	1980640	sets up this world of oppression, but
1980640	1982640	once the wand comes along, the theme of racism
1982640	1984640	is bad as just window dressing.
1984640	1986640	Yeah, the film still would have had racial
1986640	1988640	coding because all fantasy does,
1988640	1990640	but did the orcs really need to be wearing
1990640	1992640	sports jerseys?
1992640	1994640	Did we need this?
1994640	1996640	I'm not sure embracing all that
1996640	1998640	urban gangsta flavor
1998640	2000640	and leaning in
2000640	2002640	really, really hard
2002640	2004640	into that racial coding
2004640	2006640	while still also keeping
2006640	2008640	the racism we have
2008640	2010640	in the real world, like
2010640	2012640	between humans, was
2012640	2014640	the right way to go.
2014640	2016640	So you note in the examples that work,
2016640	2018640	like District 9 and Who Framed Roger Rabbit,
2018640	2020640	not only are the actual plots of these movies
2020640	2022640	about the exploitation of this underclass
2022640	2024640	and the direct effects of the systemic oppression,
2024640	2026640	they are actually clever about how oppression
2026640	2028640	manifests in these alternate universes.
2028640	2030640	They have their own in-universe
2030640	2032640	prejudices and stereotypes.
2034640	2036640	Tomb Raider.
2036640	2038640	But now he's a sore shot!
2038640	2040640	Not a lot runs report, cop.
2040640	2042640	Jirac
2042640	2044640	was unblooded, like me,
2044640	2046640	an orc that nobody cared about.
2046640	2048640	He united the nine armies
2048640	2050640	and they defeated the Dark Lord.
2050640	2052640	Wow. That sounds like kind of
2052640	2054640	a big deal. Like, the kind of big
2054640	2056640	deal that, I don't know, might lead to
2056640	2058640	a totally different, intervening
2058640	2060640	2,000 years of history?
2060640	2062640	He was a farmer
2062640	2064640	who changed the world.
2064640	2066640	According to The World of Bright, there was
2066640	2068640	a war of nine races 2,000 years ago
2068640	2070640	where a Dark Lord was bad
2070640	2072640	and the orcs supported the Dark Lord.
2072640	2074640	But then there was an unblooded orc named Jirac
2074640	2076640	who defected from the Dark Lord,
2076640	2078640	united the nine races, and led to his defeat.
2078640	2080640	Regardless of the fact that Jirac
2080640	2082640	was the hero, everyone points to
2082640	2084640	this little bit of ancient history as the reason
2084640	2086640	why orcs are discriminated against in the modern day.
2086640	2088640	You know what they say,
2088640	2090640	once with the Dark Lord, always with the Dark Lord.
2090640	2092640	Let's take a quick look at other fantasy stories
2092640	2094640	that take place in the modern day.
2094640	2096640	Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
2096640	2098640	Harry Potter. Underworld.
2098640	2100640	American Gods. Gargoyles.
2100640	2102640	All of these have a secret
2102640	2104640	underworld that exists alongside the world
2104640	2106640	that we know, and therefore does not contradict it.
2106640	2108640	This makes Bright unique, but to its detriment.
2108640	2110640	It never thinks through the implications
2110640	2112640	of building an alternate history.
2112640	2114640	Alternate reality stories are relatively
2114640	2116640	rare compared to secret underworld stories,
2116640	2118640	but they're not impossible to find.
2118640	2120640	Bioshock Infinite and Watchmen are popular
2120640	2122640	alternate reality stories,
2122640	2124640	but both have relatively recent divergent points
2124640	2126640	in history, and massively different outcomes.
2126640	2128640	The point I'm making is that
2128640	2130640	the 2000 years of backstory all of the characters
2130640	2132640	make such a huge deal about would have led to
2132640	2134640	a massively different universe than just
2134640	2136640	LA with orc homies.
2136640	2138640	And when people talk about the squandered
2138640	2140640	potential of Bright, to me this is
2140640	2142640	the worst part. There is no imagination
2142640	2144640	put into the history of the world past
2144640	2146640	the central conceit of a modern setting with
2146640	2148640	orcs and elves in it. And then when
2148640	2150640	Ayer rewrote the project, instead of developing
2150640	2152640	a fully realized world, he had to go ahead
2152640	2154640	and end up with gritty edginess and
2154640	2156640	add all that urban gangster flavor.
2156640	2158640	So you end up with this.
2158640	2160640	Fairy lives don't matter
2160640	2162640	today.
2162640	2164640	So I'm going to ignore
2164640	2166640	how tone deaf that reference is and just
2166640	2168640	stick with the inherent implication of the
2168640	2170640	line. Either Black Lives Matter
2170640	2172640	exists in the universe, and Ward is
2172640	2174640	referencing it, or this is
2174640	2176640	for the benefit of the audience and means to
2176640	2178640	telegraph that this is a movie about
2178640	2180640	race. Or it's just a bad ad-lib and
2180640	2182640	Ayer didn't think through the implication of keeping it in.
2182640	2184640	Ahem.
2184640	2186640	Here's a list of things that exist
2186640	2188640	in the Bright universe.
2188640	2190640	The Crips. Let's Crip-walk your asses on back
2190640	2192640	to the barbecue. Shrek.
2192640	2194640	To take your fat, Shrek-looking
2194640	2196640	ass. The Alamo.
2196640	2198640	Hey, don't look at me, man. Mexicans still get shit
2198640	2200640	for the fucking Alamo. Los Angeles.
2200640	2202640	Dragons over Los Angeles.
2202640	2204640	Fairy lives don't matter
2204640	2206640	today.
2206640	2208640	Well,
2208640	2210640	we're gonna go through that point by point.
2210640	2212640	I'm sorry. I had to.
2212640	2214640	Bright made me do it.
2214640	2216640	This fucking movie. Number one, the Crips.
2216640	2218640	Let's Crip-walk your
2218640	2220640	asses on back to the barbecue. The history of the Crips
2220640	2222640	stems from a variety of factors, namely
2222640	2224640	segregationist housing policies leading up to
2224640	2226640	World War II and the FBI systemic eradication
2226640	2228640	of the original Black Panther Party in the late 1960s,
2228640	2230640	leaving a power vacuum in south-central
2230640	2232640	LA and a lot of 17-year-olds with
2232640	2234640	guns. These segregationist housing policies
2234640	2236640	arose not long after Jim Crow forced many Black
2236640	2238640	Southerners to immigrate to the west coast in the early
2238640	2240640	20th century, which directly results
2240640	2242640	from the diaspora after the Civil War, which
2242640	2244640	was fought over slavery. Ergo,
2244640	2246640	it follows that the Atlantic slave
2246640	2248640	trade existed in the Bright
2248640	2250640	Universe. Number two, Shrek
2250640	2252640	exists. To take your fat,
2252640	2254640	Shrek-looking ass back
2254640	2256640	to your vehicle and drive the fuck home
2256640	2258640	to Fiona. Meaning that Jeffrey Katzenberg
2258640	2260640	exists, and the Disney Company
2260640	2262640	exists, and it made its bread and butter from
2262640	2264640	fairy tales, which are just normal tales
2264640	2266640	in this universe, but okay. Meaning
2266640	2268640	that Jeffrey Katzenberg was let go from the Disney Company
2268640	2270640	after 15 years and an acrimonious
2270640	2272640	multi-million dollar settlement and several lawsuits,
2272640	2274640	and after several failed attempts at 2D animation,
2274640	2276640	Dreamworks broke through with its pastiche and version
2276640	2278640	of fairy tale tropes, Shrek.
2278640	2280640	The Alamo exists.
2280640	2282640	Hey, don't look at me, man. Mexicans
2282640	2284640	still get shit for the fucking Alamo.
2284640	2286640	Were there orcs there, too?
2286640	2288640	If there's so much strike between non-human
2288640	2290640	races, why is there inter-human
2290640	2292640	racism? Was there chattel slavery of orcs
2292640	2294640	in addition to black people, and that's why
2294640	2296640	orcs seem to all have European
2296640	2298640	white surnames? Was the
2298640	2300640	Alamo a bigger deal in this universe?
2300640	2302640	Because Mexican-Americans get shit for a lot of
2302640	2304640	things. I thought you were out having your, like,
2304640	2306640	zillionth baby. The Alamo is not
2306640	2308640	one of those things. What was
2308640	2310640	the nine races? Were Mexicans
2310640	2312640	one of the nine races? I see you.
2312640	2314640	I see you typing those comments about
2314640	2316640	how I'm overthinking this, and you know,
2316640	2318640	yeah, it's true, but why are you watching this channel anyway?
2318640	2320640	But, you know, I can't
2320640	2322640	help it, and people say
2322640	2324640	that they're interested in the world-building
2324640	2326640	of Bright, and I'm like,
2326640	2328640	there isn't any. It's just
2328640	2330640	Star World with some
2330640	2332640	fantasy stuff slapped on top.
2332640	2334640	Los Angeles exists, meaning a Franciscan
2334640	2336640	mission settlement was built in the 18th century, meaning
2336640	2338640	the Catholic Church maintained its dominion over Spain,
2338640	2340640	meaning the War of Nine Races, a thing that is so
2340640	2342640	big a deal that in 2,000 years after the fact,
2342640	2344640	it warrants graffiti, was not such a big deal
2344640	2346640	that Emperor Constantine couldn't make
2346640	2348640	Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire
2348640	2350640	in the 4th century AD.
2350640	2352640	You cannot include elements
2352640	2354640	from our real world without importing
2354640	2356640	the history that comes with them.
2356640	2358640	I mean, you can, it's just,
2358640	2360640	you know, it's lazy and it sucks.
2360640	2362640	This is why modern sci-fi and fantasy
2362640	2364640	with alternate histories are so rare,
2364640	2366640	and the ones you do see, like The Man
2366640	2368640	in the High Castle and Bioshock Infinite,
2368640	2370640	have relatively recent divergent points
2370640	2372640	in history. Sure, you could give us an
2372640	2374640	alternate fantasy past that resulted in a
2374640	2376640	similar present with cars and stuff,
2376640	2378640	but the histories can't be the same.
2378640	2380640	L.A. wouldn't exist, Shrek wouldn't
2380640	2382640	exist, the crypts wouldn't exist,
2382640	2384640	it doesn't make sense for there to be racism
2384640	2386640	against Mexicans or black
2386640	2388640	people if we're so
2388640	2390640	bigoted against orcs.
2390640	2392640	Everywhere I go, live orcs always
2392640	2394640	gotta be the bad guys.
2394640	2396640	And elves.
2396640	2398640	So instead of an organic
2398640	2400640	world where the history is woven in,
2400640	2402640	it's just our world with fantasy elements
2402640	2404640	slapped on top, like magnets
2404640	2406640	on a fridge.
2408640	2410640	I know, building an alternate history
2410640	2412640	and weaving it in would have been difficult.
2412640	2414640	So they just didn't bother, and
2414640	2416640	it's just lazy, and it sucks.
2418640	2420640	We will not be listening to no orcish music.
2422640	2424640	The whole root of this entire
2424640	2426640	monstrosity of a video,
2426640	2428640	of me complaining about Brite
2428640	2430640	for 45 minutes, which you have
2430640	2432640	now sat through, good for you, thanks
2432640	2434640	for that, is because
2434640	2436640	I could not stop thinking about
2436640	2438640	this one line
2438640	2440640	from Sheriff's Deputy
2440640	2442640	Rodriguez.
2444640	2446640	No, Rodriguez, they don't.
2446640	2448640	And it's played as a joke, like we the audience
2448640	2450640	are supposed to get and understand it.
2450640	2452640	Like, yes, ha ha ha, we do
2452640	2454640	give Mexicans shit for the Alamo.
2454640	2456640	I personally told my neighbor Jorge
2456640	2458640	to remember it just the other day.
2458640	2460640	But it reveals both the ignorance and the
2460640	2462640	incuriosity of the filmmakers.
2462640	2464640	It understands that movies about racism
2464640	2466640	win awards,
2474640	2476640	but has no curiosity to its causes
2476640	2478640	or its roots. So by reducing
2478640	2480640	bigotry to single, definable, and justifiable
2480640	2482640	historical events, like a lot of
2482640	2484640	the fantasy genre does with its worldbuilding,
2484640	2486640	reducing bigotry to single,
2486640	2488640	justifiable, and even understandable conflicts
2488640	2490640	makes racism feel that much
2490640	2492640	more reasonable. Logical, even.
2492640	2494640	Mexicans get shit because of the Alamo.
2494640	2496640	Orcs get shit because of the
2496640	2498640	Dark Lord. Racism is bad,
2498640	2500640	but, you know,
2500640	2502640	people have legit reasons for being racist.
2502640	2504640	Like black men
2504640	2506640	consciously playing into stereotypes.
2506640	2508640	And the Alamo.
2508640	2510640	This is a massive shortcoming of movies like
2510640	2512640	Crash and Brite.
2512640	2514640	They seek to understand the logic behind
2514640	2516640	racism, but racism isn't
2516640	2518640	logical. And you can't logic people
2518640	2520640	out of a mindset they did not logic
2520640	2522640	themselves into. Chance the Rapper
2522640	2524640	commented in a tweet after watching Brite,
2524640	2526640	I always feel a little cheated when I see allegorical
2526640	2528640	racism in movies, because that racism usually
2528640	2530640	stems from human emotion or tolerance,
2530640	2532640	but not by law or systems the way it is
2532640	2534640	in real life. The world of this movie
2534640	2536640	reaches for edgy and topical, but is just lazy
2536640	2538640	and careless. All it wants is to
2538640	2540640	import the facade of urban, gangsta
2540640	2542640	flavor. And the language of bigotry
2542640	2544640	in these movies is so cartoonish that no
2544640	2546640	one would see it in themselves.
2546640	2548640	Dwarfs have mad hops.
2548640	2550640	This is a popular go-to when trying to capture the
2550640	2552640	language of casual racism in movies.
2552640	2554640	The focus on historical events.
2554640	2556640	The army of nine races fought shoulder
2556640	2558640	to shoulder to give you the world
2558640	2560640	you neglect. The focus on affirmative
2560640	2562640	action. And what happens if they hire more
2562640	2564640	of them? I can't look at you without thinking
2564640	2566640	about the five or six more qualified white
2566640	2568640	men who didn't get your job. What the fuck about
2568640	2570640	my demeanor gives you the impression
2570640	2572640	that I want to be a target on the department's
2572640	2574640	work diversity radar. Yes, white bitterness
2574640	2576640	about affirmative action and corporate diversity
2576640	2578640	initiatives is certainly a thing.
2578640	2580640	But this captures that bitterness poorly because
2580640	2582640	if you use the actual language of casual racism
2582640	2584640	you run the risk of offending casual racists
2584640	2586640	which is a huge demographic.
2586640	2588640	Tonight's the trifecta. Is that your cousin?
2588640	2590640	Full moon. Friday night.
2590640	2592640	Summer heat wave.
2592640	2594640	So you use the language of cartoon
2594640	2596640	casual racism and never have to run the risk
2596640	2598640	of making the audience question whether they are
2598640	2600640	seeing themselves in the bad guys.
2600640	2602640	How many orcs play pro basketball?
2602640	2604640	None. They're slow. They're heavy.
2604640	2606640	That's why half the NFL defensive lines
2606640	2608640	are orcish. It's not racism. It's physics.
2608640	2610640	Reduce the outcome of racism
2610640	2612640	to a kick me sign and justify
2612640	2614640	racism and bigotry by pointing to historical
2614640	2616640	events where entire ethnic groups made
2616640	2618640	an oopsie daisy. Hey, don't look at me, man.
2618640	2620640	Mexicans still get shit for the fucking Alamo.
2620640	2622640	Fantasy world building is always going to be a
2622640	2624640	reflection of the author's experiences
2624640	2626640	and you will have blind spots or biases that
2626640	2628640	will manifest themselves in the work.
2628640	2630640	The problem isn't just that this world is too close to
2630640	2632640	our own, so inevitably you can't help but
2632640	2634640	impose our world logic onto it.
2634640	2636640	It isn't just that being on the nose with your race
2636640	2638640	allegory might read as tone deaf.
2638640	2640640	Fairy lives don't matter today.
2640640	2642640	And it isn't just that fairy lives don't
2642640	2644640	matter. Really, it's just
2644640	2646640	that it's incurious and lazy
2646640	2648640	but it doesn't want to be.
2648640	2650640	And that is what makes it disappointing.
2650640	2652640	Remember when music
2652640	2654640	sold so well that people would use
2654640	2656640	it to promote movies? Yes, they do.
2656640	2658640	Yeah. We're going to make this a franchise.
2658640	2660640	Okay. We're going to
2660640	2662640	have a knockoff animated TV show.
2662640	2664640	It's going to be on Fox on Saturday mornings.
2664640	2666640	Saturday morning cartoons.
2666640	2668640	That's still a thing, right?
2668640	2670640	No.
2670640	2672640	Yeah.
