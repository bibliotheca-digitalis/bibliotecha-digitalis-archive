1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,880
The term Oscar bait is relatively new, and although the concept has been around for a

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,360
few decades, it was the 78th Academy Awards in 2006 that indirectly popularized the term

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:31,640
outside of film circles into household use.

4
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,240
The 78th Academy Awards became infamous for its best picture winner, as it was an exceptionally

5
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,920
strong year for thoughtful adult dramas, and as far as the nominees went, there was really

6
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:49,520
only one wrong answer.

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,200
Crash beat Brokeback Mountain, Capote, Good Night and Good Luck, and Munich, despite not

8
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,240
winning Best Picture at any other major film awards or even being nominated for Best Picture

9
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,640
at the Golden Globes.

10
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,600
Several lessons were learned that night.

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,600
1.

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,000
That aggressive, for-your-consideration campaigns work, regardless of merit, and 2.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,060
Meditations on the subject of race that place the root of the problems on flawed individuals

14
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:28,560
rather than historical, systemic, and structural injustices will win awards.

15
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,000
We have seen this play out time and time again since Crash won Best Picture.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,400
That said, though Crash beating favorite Brokeback Mountain was controversial at the

17
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,360
time, history has only been more unkind to Crash.

18
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,500
Yale professor Xuan Su wrote that Crash imagines racial encounter along the lines of individual

19
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,480
experience of hate and forgiveness without exploring questions of structural inequality

20
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,240
and public redress.

21
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,080
In 2009, writer and cultural critic Ta-Nehisi Coates called it the worst movie of the decade,

22
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
stating,

23
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,560
Instead, you have arguments and propaganda violently bumping into each other, impressed

24
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,680
with their own quirkiness, and calling it the apotheosis of a kind of unthinking, incurious,

25
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,680
nihilistic multiculturalism.

26
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,000
There's this narrative that's emerged surrounding Netflix's Bright that audiences

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,280
loved it and critics hated it.

28
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,880
It's hard to measure Bright's success against the typical Hollywood release, which measures

29
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,920
success with box-officer turns.

30
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,520
Netflix doesn't release metrics, but according to Nielsen, which has recently started recording

31
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,320
metrics for streaming services, Bright got about 22 million eyeballs.

32
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,960
That is to say, about 11 million people, assuming an average of about two eyeballs per person,

33
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,600
during the first three days of its release.

34
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,520
Assuming every person who watched Bright at home would have paid money to see it in theaters,

35
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,720
that would put it roughly on track with Transformers 4 and just behind Thor Ragnarok.

36
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Very respectable, especially for a non-franchise film, but this again assumes that everyone

37
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,200
who watched Bright in those three days in the comfort of their own homes would have

38
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,080
gone outside into the world and watched it in theaters.

39
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,560
A mighty big jump.

40
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,640
The sub-narrative to this is the conspiracy narrative, which is stupid but has become

41
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,840
part of the discussion and must therefore be addressed.

42
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,320
That big Hollywood is paying off critics to pan Bright because the new model Bright

43
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,480
represents is a huge threat to their revenue.

44
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,600
Which, you know, it kind of is, but you all have got to stop with the conspiracy theories

45
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,680
around critics being paid off because the Hollywood Illuminati are trying to crush your movie.

46
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,400
There is plenty to dislike about Bright.

47
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,920
Fairy lives don't matter today.

48
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,680
It is true that despite the critical reception, Bright could possibly represent a paradigm

49
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,520
shift in filmmaking, away from the focused theatrical experience and towards streaming,

50
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,560
all while not needing to sacrifice big names or budgets.

51
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,480
Netflix took a lot of risks with Bright, and even if this project wasn't the greatest

52
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,320
triumph, it will be interesting to see where they take other projects in the future.

53
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,920
Although I do question their decision not to hire a screenwriter for Bright, and to

54
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,680
go ahead with the project completely screenwriter-less, I don't know, they already ordered a sequel

55
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,200
from Trigger Warning Entertainment, maybe this time they'll hire a screenwriter.

56
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,160
Shit, did I forget to endorse this?

57
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,880
Anyway, if this is your trash, I'm not trying to judge.

58
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,520
I have seen Showgirls dozens of times, and I just released a video defending Twilight.

59
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,400
That said, even though this movie kind of came and went and everyone else has already,

60
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,320
you know, forgotten about it, I cannot stop thinking about Bright.

61
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,360
So we're going to make a thing out of it.

62
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,040
That's right, we're making a thing.

63
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,240
Fairy lives don't matter today.

64
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:02,800
So, to start, I am going to simply, factually recount the events of the film without commentary,

65
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,200
questions, or asides.

66
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
Alright?

67
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
Alright.

68
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,360
Credits roll with a variety of shots of an alternate reality Los Angeles, mostly consisting

69
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,960
of orc graffiti mentioning a dark lord and orc antipathy towards the police.

70
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,280
The story proper opens with street cop Ward, played by Will Smith, getting shot by an orc

71
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,520
robbing a bodega while his partner Jacoby, also an orc, buys him a burrito.

72
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,120
But to some time later, Ward has recovered, his wife tells him that there is a fairy in

73
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,280
the bird feeder, she wants him to kill it.

74
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,640
He goes outside, criticizes his neighbors for playing into gangsta stereotypes, says

75
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,640
this

76
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,680
Fairy lives don't matter today.

77
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,560
And crushes the fairy to death with a broom.

78
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,640
Upstairs, Ward explains to his daughter that racism is bad.

79
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,240
All of the races are different, okay?

80
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,840
And just because they're different doesn't mean anybody's smarter.

81
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,240
Jacoby shows up to offer Ward a ride to work, embarrassing Ward in front of his neighbors.

82
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,520
On the way to work, Ward continues to be a jerk to Jacoby, blaming him for getting

83
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,120
shot, and Jacoby suggests that the root of Ward's racism against him is that he isn't

84
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
getting laid.

85
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,880
They drive through an elf district, Ward complains some more, nothing happens, and then they

86
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,040
continue to work.

87
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,920
In the locker room, Ward's co-workers all make bigoted remarks about Jacoby, and justify

88
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:19,640
their bigotry by the fact that the orcs had sided with the Dark Lord 2,000 years ago.

89
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,960
During assignment, Ward is assigned to partner with Jacoby, he complains to Margaret Cho

90
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,360
who blames the orc diversity department.

91
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,440
Jacoby has a kick me sign on his back, his co-workers laugh at him.

92
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,680
While on the beat, Ward yells at Jacoby over nothing.

93
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,800
They get a call because of a crazy sword-wielding dirty man who mentions a Dark Lord returning.

94
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,600
They joke with Sheriff's Deputy Rodriguez about their shared struggles with racism.

95
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,960
They take in the dirty man.

96
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,660
Dirty man tells Jacoby and Orcish that Ward is special.

97
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,640
Back at the station, Internal Affairs goads Ward into forcing Jacoby to admit that he

98
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,840
had intentionally let the perp go because they're both orcs.

99
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,120
The Magic Task Force, aka the Magic Feds, show up and reveal that the dirty man is in

100
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,800
a group called Shield of Light.

101
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,600
They talk about a group of renegade elves called the Inferni, who need three magic wands

102
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,920
in order to resurrect the Dark Lord.

103
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,840
He explains that most Brights are elves, but humans can be Brights too, if only one in

104
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,360
a million.

105
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,840
Ward and Jacoby get called to a shootout where they find a bunch of supernatural death, this,

106
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,160
and a fragile kick-ass waif named Tika with a magic wand who appears not to speak English.

107
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,960
The Enforcement show up, put the magic wand in a bag, and tell Ward that he needs to go

108
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,800
outside now and murder Jacoby, or the corrupt cops will kill both of them.

109
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,200
Ward goes outside, accuses Jacoby of letting the orc perp go, and Jacoby admits that he

110
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,600
did let the perp go, but only because he realizes he'd chased down the wrong kid after losing

111
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,440
the real shooter in the crowd.

112
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,880
Inside the house, the corrupt cops decide to kill Ward, Jacoby, and Tika no matter what

113
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,040
Ward does.

114
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:51,400
They go outside, tell Ward it's time, and Ward turns around and murders all four of

115
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
them.

116
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,280
Another group of gangsters show up, led by a guy named Poison, declare that the wand

117
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:02,120
belongs to the Barrio, they escape, run into an invisible wall, have a terrible slow-mo

118
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,120
car crash, which they then walk away from with no apparent injuries.

119
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,200
Inferni leader Layla arrives with her Inferni at the original scene.

120
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,060
They murder an entire Spanish-speaking family of witnesses, including a baby, and begin

121
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,240
the hunt for Ward, Jacoby, and Tika.

122
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,920
Ward and Jacoby hide, are discovered by Poison's gang, one of them grabs the wand, and explodes.

123
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,120
This is what happens to non-Brites who touch magic wands.

124
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,120
They escape, hide in a strip club, where they are found yet again by Poison's gang.

125
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,960
A gunfight is about to commence, but then the Inferni show up and kill everyone, while

126
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,120
failing to capture Ward and Jacoby.

127
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,040
Ward and Jacoby escape, talk about their feelings in a gas station bathroom while Layla whimpers

128
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,040
in the corner.

129
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,720
Ward calls Rodriguez, who demands to see the wand.

130
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,600
He calls the magic feds, but the Inferni are tapping the phone lines and cut the line with

131
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,800
an axe.

132
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,240
Rodriguez cuffs them for their own safety, and is then shot and killed by the Inferni.

133
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,760
Another fight scene, Ward, Jacoby, and Tika escape yet again, only to be captured by a

134
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
gang of orcs.

135
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,680
Take your fat Shrek looking ass back to your vehicle and drive the fuck home to Fiona.

136
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,040
The leader explains that he's angry that they brought guns into that first club they

137
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,160
escaped into, demands the wand, beats them, and then stabs Jacoby.

138
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:18,760
He orders his son, Mikey, Mikey the Orc, to shoot Jacoby, but then wouldn't you know,

139
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,840
it's the kid Jacoby let go, and he can't kill him.

140
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,200
So his dad shoots Jacoby instead.

141
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,480
But Tika rips the wand from her skin, revealing her Brightlyhood, and resurrects Jacoby while

142
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,080
the orcs… let her.

143
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,840
The orcs kneel, and then they are allowed to leave without a word.

144
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:42,080
Ward chastises Tika for not letting them know she is a Bright, or that she can speak English.

145
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,720
She tells them that the Inferni plan to restore the Dark Lord to power, using the wand has

146
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,480
crippled her, she's dying, and Jacoby, grateful for her saving his life, convinces Ward to

147
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,680
take her back to the house where they found her.

148
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,280
The Inferni are waiting for them, another fight scene, Jacoby shoots Layla, Ward brings

149
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,160
Tika to the pool of healing.

150
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:07,080
Layla somehow survives her shooting, hangs Jacoby, this happens, Jacoby shoots the wand

151
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,720
out of Layla's hand, but runs out of ammo.

152
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,120
Ward grabs the wand, surprise surprise, he is a Bright.

153
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,840
Jacoby tells him the magic word, and he defeats Layla.

154
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,160
Jacoby tries to get them outside the burning house, when he realizes Ward didn't follow

155
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,280
him, he goes back into the burning building and rescues him.

156
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,560
The orcs that were going to kill them earlier respect him now.

157
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:39,520
After all that, Ward says this, they explain their side of the story to the magic feds

158
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,600
in the hospital.

159
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,480
The magic feds take the wand, at the memorial for Rodriguez and the four cops Ward murdered,

160
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:55,080
they see Tika in the crowd, a fairy flies at the camera, the end.

161
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,480
So this is not a book of Henry situation, this is not a concept so squirrely that only

162
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,600
a complete change of genre would have salvaged it.

163
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,440
Obviously there were huge problems with the screenplay, but nothing that a couple of rewrites

164
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,640
couldn't have fixed.

165
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,920
In the broadest of strokes, there's nothing fundamentally wrong with the premise or the

166
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,920
story itself.

167
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,960
A fantasy setting that resembles our modern universe, with the central characters as two

168
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,160
cops of different fantasy races that don't like each other, but have to learn to work

169
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,160
together when they come into possession of what is effectively a weapon of mass destruction.

170
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,520
You could just as easily imagine the two cops as Legolas and Gimli, and that could make

171
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,120
for a fun unique romp.

172
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,720
And it's also not like the elements weren't in place to make it work, specifically with

173
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,840
the two mains.

174
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,240
Smith and Edgerton actually have great chemistry.

175
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
No holes?

176
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,240
Huh?

177
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,240
Uh, only the ones that I was born with.

178
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
How are your holes?

179
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
The fuck can you make a shootout awkward?

180
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,240
Ward is a garden variety jerk who disrespects Jacoby, who happens to be an awkward dork.

181
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,240
I thought it'd be nice to get me a ride on your first date.

182
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,240
But through shared hardship, they learn to value each other.

183
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,240
A modern take on a traditional fantasy trope.

184
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,640
Who thought I'd die fighting side by side with an elf?

185
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,640
What about side by side with a friend?

186
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,640
This dynamic doesn't live up to its potential because of the poor plotting and character

187
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
development.

188
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,640
Again, why didn't they hire a screenwriter?

189
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
Weird.

190
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,640
But you can see the intent there in a lot of their interactions.

191
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,640
I used to be like you, thinking save everybody and fix everything.

192
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,640
Now I just pretend to be a good dude.

193
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,040
The glut of action scenes is a problem because much of these fight scenes with the Inferni

194
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
don't advance anything.

195
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,040
Several times they are in danger, escape, exposit some while Lulu cowers, more danger,

196
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,040
they escape, repeat.

197
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,040
They gain nothing, lose nothing, and learn nothing for nearly an hour of the film's

198
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,040
runtime until Tikka saves Jacoby using the wand.

199
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,040
This should have been the midpoint of the film, not the end of Act 2 as it isn't a

200
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,040
final product.

201
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,040
And the second half of Act 2 should have been built around these three building a dynamic

202
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,440
and learning to trust each other and care about each other, giving us, the audience,

203
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,440
the chance to care about her before she starts dying, and about Jacoby and Ward's dynamic.

204
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,440
If Tikka were to begin trusting Ward and Jacoby during the midpoint, they could have developed

205
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,440
a rapport, and rather than her overextending herself with the wand being potentially fatal,

206
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,440
a plot point which makes no sense because this doesn't happen to any other wand users,

207
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,440
maybe have her be fatally injured in some other way later, and then, the audience having

208
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,840
now built up some emotional investment in these characters, Ward and Jacoby spend the

209
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,840
third act trying to save her, cue the climax, the end.

210
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,840
My point is, it wouldn't have been that hard to bring this up to the level of...

211
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,840
okay.

212
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,840
A lot of the worldbuilding is clumsily explained by characters that have nothing to do with

213
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,840
the narrative, like this guy.

214
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,840
You ever notice how most brides are elves, and elves run the world?

215
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
Coincidence?

216
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,240
Yeah, we never see him again after this scene, and organic worldbuilding that isn't exposition

217
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,240
word-dumped from characters that are relevant to the plot comes at the cost of unnecessarily

218
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,240
long action scenes that take up so much of the film's runtime.

219
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
But this movie is gritty.

220
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,240
See, it needs to reflect harsh truths about racism in LA.

221
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,240
You know, like Crash did.

222
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,240
Look at all that urban gangsta flavor.

223
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
Ahhhhhhhhhhh

224
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,640
A major symptom of these structure problems comes in the form of the poor execution of

225
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,640
setup and payoff.

226
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,640
The trip to Elftown at the beginning is a setup that never pays off.

227
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,640
They go to Elftown, Elftown is set up.

228
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,840
It is a huge pointed setup.

229
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,840
Ain't nothing over here but rich-ass elves just running the world and shopping.

230
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,640
Not only do they never go back to Elftown again, Elftown isn't even mentioned.

231
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,160
Also they couldn't find a better name for it than Elftown?

232
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,640
Like Beverly Hills isn't called WEALTHTOWN.

233
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,160
Also where the fuck is this supposed to be?

234
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,640
It looks like downtown LA but Beverly Hills is like 10 miles away.

235
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,640
Nevermind.

236
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,640
The fact that Ward has a loving family totally undermines the character they're going for.

237
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,640
You don't want me as a friend.

238
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Yeah.

239
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,440
Cause besides taking out the fairy LAPD style, you seem to be doing alright.

240
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:27,840
You have a loving family, a daughter you care for, a wife who makes you coffee with napkins

241
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,440
and you joke around with.

242
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,440
Made doubly confusing by this line.

243
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,440
Physical love.

244
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,440
A relic from an earlier draft of the script where Ward was estranged from his wife.

245
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,440
But if they were going to give Ward a nice wife and give them a happy relationship, then

246
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,440
they probably should have cut this exchange.

247
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,440
And the setup of the family pays off not at all.

248
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,440
All it does is undermine the badass loner thing they're trying to go for with Ward.

249
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,440
It is a weak incentive for him to maybe betray Jacoby, maybe for a little bit.

250
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,440
But really, why does he even have a wife and daughter?

251
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,240
They get the family out of danger immediately, and then the family only comes back at the

252
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
very end.

253
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,240
If you want to play up this I'm a bad dude with no friends angle, don't give him a family.

254
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,240
These are wasted story elements in a story with already way too much clumsy, inorganic

255
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,240
worldbuilding.

256
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,240
Poison's gang, for instance.

257
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,240
They are never mentioned again after the Titty Bar shootout.

258
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
We gonna Titty Bar gunfight die.

259
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,240
Which wouldn't be so bad if there had been some growth or development during the previous

260
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,040
three shootouts with Poison's gang, but there isn't.

261
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:53,040
All we get is that this is what happens when a non-bright touches a wand, a thing that

262
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,040
we already knew, and the orcs getting mad at the trio as justification to capture them

263
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,040
and shoot Jacoby later, a plot point which is really weak.

264
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,240
These three spend a full half hour of the film on the run from Poison's gang, who

265
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,040
does not matter, and has nothing to do with the plot.

266
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,840
Moreover, no one seems to care that even if they get this magic wand, they cannot use it.

267
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,840
Perhaps the worst failure of setup and payoff is that Mikey the orc, the kid whom Jacoby

268
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,840
helped escape earlier, that we meet later in the orc hideout, at first you're like

269
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,840
hey some setup that was paid off.

270
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,840
Jacoby's mercy and good deeds saves him.

271
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,840
But then Mikey's dad shoots Jacoby anyway, and Tika has to use the wand to resurrect him.

272
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,640
So this setup, the fact that Jacoby showed Mikey mercy, is of no consequence.

273
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,640
There is no meaningful outcome to Jacoby showing this kid mercy.

274
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
He gets shot either way.

275
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,640
Bad setup and payoff.

276
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,640
And once again, in the earlier draft of the script, Mikey the orc actually did spare Jacoby.

277
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,640
But in the David Ayer rewrite, it was decided that apparently that wasn't dramatic enough.

278
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,640
And as in the example with the estranged wife, they kept the setup where the payoff no longer makes sense.

279
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,440
I started with the focus on structure because flawed though it is, the story is there and

280
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,440
this could have easily been fixed in the screenplay stage.

281
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
This could have worked.

282
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,440
But really, the devil is in the details.

283
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,440
A major part of film editing is just as much deciding what to cut out as what to keep in.

284
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,440
Elements in a story need narrative utility.

285
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,240
Let's examine a scene. Ward kills the fairy.

286
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,240
What narrative purpose does this serve?

287
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
Fairies in this universe appear to be pests.

288
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,240
Which is fine, but either way, Ward's solution is cruel and inhumane.

289
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,240
So from a narrative utility standpoint, either it is trying to demonstrate Ward's antipathy

290
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,240
towards fantasy things, or it is setting up Ward as a blood psychopath.

291
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,240
Here's why neither of these things work.

292
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,240
One, in-universe, magic is seen as separate from all things normal.

293
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,040
That's whatever you want.

294
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,040
The magic wand is magic, but that doesn't mean that orcs, elves, humans, or fairies are.

295
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,040
They just exist in this universe and they share it.

296
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,040
Therefore, humans aren't necessarily separate from it.

297
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,040
They are just another race in this world.

298
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,040
Like they are in The Lord of the Rings.

299
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,040
So using this as setup as Ward magic hater doesn't work because the fairy is just another

300
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,040
non-magical element in this universe.

301
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,040
Number two, is it setting up Ward as a blood psychopath?

302
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,840
Well, he's kind of a jerk, but he isn't exceptionally cruel after this scene.

303
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,840
He drops his four corrupt colleagues because he correctly assumes they are about to kill

304
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,840
both of them.

305
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,840
Either way, we never see him abusing his power in relation to relative powerlessness,

306
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,840
as it relates to him killing what is in this universe effectively an animal.

307
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,840
So he doesn't grow from this, learn to be more kind to the powerless,

308
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,840
nor is it foreshadowing some other cruelty.

309
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,840
Like imagine if this movie had begun with Ward instead killing like a rat or a raccoon

310
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,840
or a cat or something in the same manner.

311
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,640
Yikes, we might say.

312
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,640
Not a good dude.

313
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,640
This must be going somewhere.

314
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,640
But it doesn't.

315
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,640
It's what I do.

316
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,640
And this isn't about Will Smith being mean.

317
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,640
It's about nobody acts like a person in this movie.

318
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,640
The worst offender is the climactic scene in which Ward discovers that he is a bright.

319
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,640
Everyone is beaten up pretty badly, and then Layla starts with this.

320
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,640
What have you done to my sister?

321
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,640
What have you done to her?

322
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,640
Which neither sets up anything nor pays off anything or relates to anything that we've learned about the Inferni.

323
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,640
And don't start with it setting up extended universe crap.

324
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,640
Jacoby breaks free of being hung, shoots the wand out of Layla's hand,

325
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,640
and then Ward starts like sassing him.

326
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,640
Nick, if you were aiming at the wand, that was a really good shot.

327
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
But shoot her in her head!

328
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,640
And nobody is like moving or hiding or trying to defend themselves as they might be doing in a tense shootout.

329
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,640
And Jacoby moves to shoot her again, but...

330
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,640
I can't. I'm out.

331
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,640
He says this like he's got a headache and he just realizes he left his aspirin at home.

332
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,640
And all of these characters are within about ten feet of each other.

333
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,640
Nothing is stopping Layla from lunging for the wand with her other not-blown-off hand,

334
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,640
or Jacoby from bum-rushing her.

335
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,640
And it takes like a full minute for Ward to grab that wand.

336
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,640
And then he gets it and he's like,

337
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,640
What do I do?

338
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,640
Hey Nick, I got the wand!

339
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,640
What now?

340
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,640
And still nobody's moving?

341
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Like, they're still in their spots.

342
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,640
Like, well, they can't move or that would ruin the blocking.

343
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,640
The unkillable Layla doesn't even stand up when Leeloo tells Ward the magic word.

344
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,640
The war word is Vaequaras.

345
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,640
Dracarys.

346
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,640
And in the time it takes him to process this,

347
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,640
Layla still could have grabbed it from him, but she doesn't.

348
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,640
She stays put.

349
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,640
Like, you know, we couldn't have set up the magic word before this scene somehow.

350
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,640
This scene is just astonishing in how much it doesn't work from every angle.

351
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,640
Because no one acts like a person who is in danger.

352
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,640
I'm out.

353
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,640
But it's Tika who stands out as the biggest problem character development-wise,

354
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,640
as there's never any reason for Ward or Jacoby or the audience to be emotionally invested in her.

355
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,640
There's no reason for her to withhold that she speaks English as long as she does.

356
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,640
She speaks English pretty good now, too.

357
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,640
Now I trust you.

358
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,640
Or her brightly-hood.

359
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,640
Or to follow them around as long as she does,

360
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,640
if no trust or emotional bond has been built up.

361
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,640
By the end of the movie, when she's dying,

362
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,640
neither Ward nor Jacoby nor the audience have any reason to care about her.

363
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,640
Tika acting like a weird child alien is, yep, you guessed it,

364
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,640
a relic from an earlier draft where she was a literal elf child,

365
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,640
and that's why they were carting her around.

366
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,640
So I guess when they added the titty-bar gunfight,

367
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,640
We're gonna titty-bar gunfight die.

368
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
that means they couldn't have Tika be a literal child anymore.

369
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,640
So they aged her up to like a 25-year-old, but changed literally nothing else.

370
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,640
But Tika is emblematic of the bigger problem with the film

371
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,640
as it ties into theme and world-building.

372
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,640
She's just poorly thought out.

373
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,640
She's just as much a MacGuffin as the wand is.

374
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,640
When she is deigned the thinnest of backstories, it is pure function.

375
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,640
You're gonna need to unfuck this.

376
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,640
No motivation, no emotional core, nothing.

377
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,640
Her defection from the Inferni is motivated by nothing other than Dark Lord bad,

378
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,640
but we never have any idea of who she is,

379
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,640
so there's never any reason to care about her.

380
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,640
The only character who even consistently comes close to acting like a person

381
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,640
with pathos and motivations is Jacoby.

382
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,640
Hey, Sophia, what's up, rockstar?

383
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,640
So, like Crash feels like it was written by space aliens

384
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,640
trying to understand why humans are racist,

385
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,640
You get on your knees and suck my motherfucking dick while you're down there!

386
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,640
so too it applies to Bright.

387
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,640
To paraphrase Ta-Nehisi Coates' comments on Crash,

388
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,640
I don't think there is a single human being in Bright,

389
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,640
except for, arguably, the Orc.

390
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,640
Both Crash and Bright reach to capture a truth,

391
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,640
but capture nothing,

392
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,640
because it fails utterly to capture the way people talk and think and act,

393
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
or how systems work within a society.

394
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,640
Man, you know what they say,

395
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,640
once with the Dark Lord, always with the Dark Lord.

396
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,640
Now, this normally wouldn't be that noteworthy.

397
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,640
It would just be a premise with lots of potential

398
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,640
that unfortunately led to a bad movie.

399
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,640
But then Bright had to go and make Bright's self about race.

400
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
I said, Orcs ain't cops.

401
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
He said, now we are.

402
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,640
Then he went outside into his Audi car.

403
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,640
The intellectual grandfather of the type of fantasy shown in Bright

404
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,640
is J.R.R. Tolkien,

405
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,640
whose works directly influenced all contemporary fantasy

406
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,640
from Dungeons and Dragons to Willow to Skyrim to Bright.

407
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,640
Lord of the Rings is also a launching point of discussion

408
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,640
as it pertains to allegory and racial coding

409
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,640
as it applies to works of fantasy.

410
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,640
Many over the years have pointed to The Lord of the Rings

411
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,640
as an obvious allegory for, for instance, World War II,

412
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,640
a claim which Tolkien virulently denied,

413
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,640
stating in a preface to a reprint of Fellowship of the Ring,

414
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,640
I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations,

415
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,640
and always have done so

416
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,640
since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence.

417
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,640
Tolkien's attitude was that

418
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,640
if people are going to read allegory and do his work,

419
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,640
fine, have a party,

420
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,640
but not to assume that he intended any to be there.

421
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,640
He drew from history, yes,

422
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,640
but he wasn't making an intentional statement about it.

423
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,640
Now the thing is, Tolkien, of course,

424
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,640
existed in, absorbed, and reproduced

425
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,640
the colonialist worldview of his day.

426
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,640
No, I don't think he did it on purpose,

427
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,640
but I also don't think it occurred to him

428
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,640
to question the implications of making

429
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,640
the dark-skinned races of men side with Sauron.

430
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,640
I'm not saying Tolkien was a bad guy,

431
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,640
I'm just saying he was a man of his time,

432
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,640
and critical race theory didn't really exist yet.

433
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,640
However, it is also important to differentiate between

434
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,640
allegory, story elements that are meant to have

435
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,640
a one-to-one correlation with something outside of the story,

436
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,640
for instance, Aslan in the Narnia books as Christ allegory,

437
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,640
or Animal Farm as allegory for totalitarian communism,

438
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,640
and, of course, there's Mother,

439
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,640
which is the rare modern movie that is just

440
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,640
oops, all allegory.

441
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
I gave you everything!

442
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,640
Allegory is not the same as coding,

443
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
Why don't you get a haircut with your bitch ass?

444
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,640
which lifts elements from the real world

445
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,640
to provide a shorthand message based on

446
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,640
the presumed worldview of the audience,

447
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,640
i.e., the aliens in Avatar being coded

448
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,640
as indigenous as shorthand for them being

449
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,640
more pure and in touch with nature.

450
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,640
And again, coding is one of those terms

451
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,640
that has become politicized and is often

452
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,640
read as negative when, in fact,

453
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,640
it is a neutral term in academia.

454
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,640
It describes a sociological phenomenon.

455
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,640
Coding is a neutral term.

456
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,640
Allegory exists as a statement of authorial intent.

457
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,640
Coding may or may not even be a conscious choice.

458
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,640
Ah!

459
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,640
With stories made by and for humans,

460
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,640
there is always coding.

461
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,640
There's especially coding in fantasy worlds

462
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
derived from the worlds of Tolkien.

463
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,640
Some that were there in the books.

464
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,640
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.

465
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
Some that weren't.

466
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,640
And on some levels, this is kind of inescapable

467
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
because it's basically impossible to create

468
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,640
fantasy races that aren't at least a little bit

469
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,640
derived from the author's perception of human cultures.

470
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,640
Humans have a natural in-group, out-group mentality

471
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,640
and we've divvied ourselves up

472
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,640
into lots and lots of groups.

473
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,640
So, cultural and racial coding

474
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,640
sneaks into stories, intentional or not.

475
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,640
If we look at Skyrim, for example,

476
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,640
we have the Nords, who are a coded Scandinavian mishmash.

477
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,640
We also have the race of the Khajiit.

478
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,640
Here we have a race of nomadic cat people

479
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
with these accents.

480
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
Much snow in Skyrim.

481
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,640
Enough snow.

482
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,640
I does not want anymore.

483
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,640
They also make very good thieves.

484
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,640
They like their skooma.

485
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,640
Yeah, yeah, they're Romani.

486
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,640
They're Romani. They're cat Romani. We get it.

487
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,640
You with one of the trade caravans, Khajiit?

488
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,640
Your kind always seems to find trouble.

489
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,640
And then, of course, there are orcs.

490
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,640
Written variations on orcs have been around

491
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,640
in English folklore as far back as Beowulf.

492
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,640
But it was Tolkien who collated the modern idea of the orc.

493
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,640
Tolkien described his orcs as

494
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,640
corruptions of the human form.

495
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,640
Squat, broad, flat-nosed,

496
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,640
sallow-skinned, with wide mouths and slant eyes.

497
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,640
In fact, degraded and repulsive versions

498
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,640
of the, to Europeans,

499
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,640
least lovely Mongol types.

500
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,640
Nice.

501
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,640
The works of Tolkien influenced Dungeons and Dragons,

502
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,640
which influenced Warhammer,

503
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,640
which influenced World of Warcraft,

504
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,640
which influenced the Elder Scrolls games,

505
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,640
which influenced Bright.

506
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,640
Orcs in all of these absorb coding

507
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,640
from ethnic groups from across the world,

508
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,640
from ancient Celts, to Scots,

509
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,640
to the Zulu, and, of course,

510
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,640
the least lovely Mongol types.

511
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,640
So while some fantasy fans want to suggest

512
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,640
that fantasy races sprung fully formed

513
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,640
from the forehead of Zeus with no real-world influences,

514
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,640
Bright isn't completely off the mark

515
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,640
by applying racial coding to its orcs.

516
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,640
And in a perverse way, there is something

517
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,640
cogent about Bright putting its orcs in chains

518
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,640
and sports jerseys and do-rags

519
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,640
and wearing baseball caps with the name

520
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,640
of their gang lovingly embroidered on the front

521
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,640
just like real gangs do.

522
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,640
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

523
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,620
According to Tolkien,

524
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,640
I think that many confuse applicability

525
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,640
with allegory, but the one resides

526
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,640
in the freedom of the reader and the other

527
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,640
in the proposed domination of the author.

528
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,640
In other words, for something to be considered allegorical,

529
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,640
there needs to be authorial intent.

530
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,640
And authors can't really help it if people

531
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,640
read into their work something that they did

532
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,640
not intend.

533
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,640
But coding does not require authorial intent.

534
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,640
Coding is often careless or unintentional,

535
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,640
born from reappropriating tropes

536
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,640
without delving into the history of why they're even there

537
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,640
in the first place.

538
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,640
Missy called John John Binks.

539
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,640
Missy, your humble servant.

540
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,640
Coding in Bright is way too on the nose

541
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,640
to be ignorant, but it certainly

542
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,640
raises questions.

543
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,640
Can racial coding in science fiction

544
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,640
and fantasy used to make some

545
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,640
one-to-one

546
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,640
allegory about interracial

547
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,640
relationships ever actually

548
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,640
work?

549
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,640
One observation that's kind of flown under the radar

550
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,640
is the comparison of Bright to the

551
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,640
almost identical 1988 film Alien

552
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,640
Nation, which has a very similar premise

553
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,640
right down to the first alien

554
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,640
cop in the LAPD, played by

555
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,640
Mandy Patinkin, and the aliens as

556
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,640
thinly veiled allegories for black and hispanic

557
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,640
communities in LA.

558
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,640
Why do we have to take them?

559
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,640
Why can't they go to Russia or someplace like that?

560
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,640
A list of newcomer informants is about

561
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,640
as long as a list of Mexican war

562
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,640
heroes. Hey! Hey! Come on.

563
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,640
Nobody talks to nobody down there.

564
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,640
And half of them don't even speak English.

565
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,640
That movie also sucks. But Alien Nation

566
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,640
has one crucial difference, as does

567
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,640
District 9. The aliens are

568
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,640
relative newcomers to this universe, and

569
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,640
therefore they don't conflict with the rest of history

570
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
as we, the audience, knows it.

571
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,640
Now, District 9 is controversial because

572
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,640
it does some of the things that Bright does,

573
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,640
namely using aliens as an allegory for

574
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,640
racial injustice. It's also gotten huge pushback

575
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,640
for its portrayal of the Nigerian gangsters,

576
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,640
and I'm not going to disagree with that.

577
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,640
But while District 9 is far from perfect,

578
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,640
I'm going to quickly point out where I think it succeeds

579
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,640
and its allegory where Bright fails.

580
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,640
1. The aliens are alien, and with the

581
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
exception of Christopher Johnson, largely

582
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,640
incomprehensible.

583
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,640
Yes, there is racial coding woven in because

584
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,640
there always is, but they aren't wearing do-rags

585
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,640
and chains and sports jerseys.

586
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,640
God damn it, Bright!

587
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
2. Our history and the movie's history diverge like

588
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,640
20 years earlier. The recently divergent

589
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,640
history means that interhuman racism

590
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,640
was allowed to develop and thrive and does not

591
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
feel out of place in this universe the way

592
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
it does in Bright. 3. You spend a lot of time

593
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
with Christopher Johnson and see the actual shit

594
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,640
he and his family live under, and it's not just

595
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,640
stupid lip service like a

596
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,640
kick-me sign at work. 4. District 9 does

597
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,640
not pussyfoot around what it thinks is a cute

598
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,640
metaphor. It does not place the blame of

599
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,640
racism on flawed individuals, but rather

600
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,640
on vast systems in which individuals

601
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,640
are willingly complicit because they

602
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,640
benefit from those systems. But

603
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,640
perhaps the most applicable comparison to Bright

604
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
is who framed Roger Rabbit.

605
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,640
What could have possibly happened to you

606
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,640
to turn you into such a sourpuss?

607
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,640
You wanna know?

608
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,640
I'll tell you.

609
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,640
A toon killed my brother.

610
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,640
A toon? No!

611
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,640
First of all, sometimes it is actually better to just not

612
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,640
explain how we got here. Roger Rabbit

613
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,640
never explains the history of how toons came

614
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,640
to be, and to be clear, that is a good

615
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,640
thing, because we do not need it in this

616
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,640
story. It's also a clever reflection on

617
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,640
how black entertainers were valued as commodities

618
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,640
in the 1940s. In

619
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,640
many instances, not even allowed to be

620
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,640
patrons in some establishments in which

621
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,640
they themselves were headliners.

622
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
Toon review. Strictly

623
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640
humans only, okay? But the most

624
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,640
important facet of who framed Roger Rabbit

625
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,640
is that the plot of the corporate scheme to

626
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,640
bulldoze Toontown is perfectly interwoven

627
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,640
with both the themes of the toons as an

628
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,640
exploited underclass and with the protagonist's

629
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,640
own internal conflict and nascent

630
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,640
anti-toon racism. So when you

631
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,640
look at the above examples, especially Roger

632
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,640
Rabbit, the laziness of the world-building

633
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,640
and allegory in Bright comes into sharp

634
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,640
focus. Racism is bad,

635
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,640
orcs are oppressed, now here's a movie

636
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,640
about some cops playing keep-away-with-a-magic-wand

637
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,640
for 90 minutes. Really, a lot of these

638
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,640
problems could have been avoided if they hadn't taken

639
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,640
a poorly thought-out fantasy-based

640
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,640
alternate reality of our own world and used

641
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,640
it to make a comment on the tragedy of modern

642
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,640
racial relations. And the

643
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,640
real irony is if you look at earlier drafts

644
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,640
of the script, they're not really there.

645
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,640
The hacky lines about the Alamo,

646
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,640
words like gangbanger and

647
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
homies, those appear to be

648
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,640
Ayer additions. And playing up

649
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,640
those elements only makes the movie make

650
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,640
less sense. Like the master race

651
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,640
of elves here means nothing because the baddies

652
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,640
are outliers. It drops this

653
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,640
very juicy idea that this is a very

654
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,640
vertical society and then does nothing with

655
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,640
it, and it ends up meaning nothing to the world.

656
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,640
More to the point, the plot itself,

657
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,640
keep-the-magic-wand-away-from-Layla,

658
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
has fuck-all to do with the

659
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,640
oppression of orcs or Mexicans

660
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
or whoever. The entire first act

661
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,640
sets up this world of oppression, but

662
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,640
once the wand comes along, the theme of racism

663
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,640
is bad as just window dressing.

664
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,640
Yeah, the film still would have had racial

665
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,640
coding because all fantasy does,

666
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,640
but did the orcs really need to be wearing

667
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,640
sports jerseys?

668
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640
Did we need this?

669
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,640
I'm not sure embracing all that

670
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,640
urban gangsta flavor

671
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,640
and leaning in

672
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,640
really, really hard

673
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,640
into that racial coding

674
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,640
while still also keeping

675
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,640
the racism we have

676
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,640
in the real world, like

677
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,640
between humans, was

678
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,640
the right way to go.

679
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,640
So you note in the examples that work,

680
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,640
like District 9 and Who Framed Roger Rabbit,

681
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,640
not only are the actual plots of these movies

682
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,640
about the exploitation of this underclass

683
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
and the direct effects of the systemic oppression,

684
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,640
they are actually clever about how oppression

685
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,640
manifests in these alternate universes.

686
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,640
They have their own in-universe

687
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,640
prejudices and stereotypes.

688
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,640
Tomb Raider.

689
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,640
But now he's a sore shot!

690
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,640
Not a lot runs report, cop.

691
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,640
Jirac

692
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,640
was unblooded, like me,

693
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,640
an orc that nobody cared about.

694
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,640
He united the nine armies

695
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,640
and they defeated the Dark Lord.

696
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,640
Wow. That sounds like kind of

697
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,640
a big deal. Like, the kind of big

698
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,640
deal that, I don't know, might lead to

699
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,640
a totally different, intervening

700
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,640
2,000 years of history?

701
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,640
He was a farmer

702
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,640
who changed the world.

703
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,640
According to The World of Bright, there was

704
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,640
a war of nine races 2,000 years ago

705
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,640
where a Dark Lord was bad

706
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,640
and the orcs supported the Dark Lord.

707
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,640
But then there was an unblooded orc named Jirac

708
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,640
who defected from the Dark Lord,

709
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,640
united the nine races, and led to his defeat.

710
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,640
Regardless of the fact that Jirac

711
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,640
was the hero, everyone points to

712
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,640
this little bit of ancient history as the reason

713
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,640
why orcs are discriminated against in the modern day.

714
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,640
You know what they say,

715
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,640
once with the Dark Lord, always with the Dark Lord.

716
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,640
Let's take a quick look at other fantasy stories

717
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,640
that take place in the modern day.

718
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,640
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

719
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,640
Harry Potter. Underworld.

720
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,640
American Gods. Gargoyles.

721
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,640
All of these have a secret

722
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,640
underworld that exists alongside the world

723
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,640
that we know, and therefore does not contradict it.

724
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,640
This makes Bright unique, but to its detriment.

725
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,640
It never thinks through the implications

726
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,640
of building an alternate history.

727
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,640
Alternate reality stories are relatively

728
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,640
rare compared to secret underworld stories,

729
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,640
but they're not impossible to find.

730
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,640
Bioshock Infinite and Watchmen are popular

731
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,640
alternate reality stories,

732
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,640
but both have relatively recent divergent points

733
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,640
in history, and massively different outcomes.

734
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,640
The point I'm making is that

735
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,640
the 2000 years of backstory all of the characters

736
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,640
make such a huge deal about would have led to

737
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,640
a massively different universe than just

738
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,640
LA with orc homies.

739
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,640
And when people talk about the squandered

740
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,640
potential of Bright, to me this is

741
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,640
the worst part. There is no imagination

742
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,640
put into the history of the world past

743
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,640
the central conceit of a modern setting with

744
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,640
orcs and elves in it. And then when

745
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
Ayer rewrote the project, instead of developing

746
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,640
a fully realized world, he had to go ahead

747
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,640
and end up with gritty edginess and

748
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,640
add all that urban gangster flavor.

749
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,640
So you end up with this.

750
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,640
Fairy lives don't matter

751
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,640
today.

752
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,640
So I'm going to ignore

753
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,640
how tone deaf that reference is and just

754
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,640
stick with the inherent implication of the

755
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,640
line. Either Black Lives Matter

756
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,640
exists in the universe, and Ward is

757
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,640
referencing it, or this is

758
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,640
for the benefit of the audience and means to

759
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,640
telegraph that this is a movie about

760
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,640
race. Or it's just a bad ad-lib and

761
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,640
Ayer didn't think through the implication of keeping it in.

762
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,640
Ahem.

763
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,640
Here's a list of things that exist

764
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,640
in the Bright universe.

765
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,640
The Crips. Let's Crip-walk your asses on back

766
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,640
to the barbecue. Shrek.

767
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,640
To take your fat, Shrek-looking

768
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,640
ass. The Alamo.

769
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,640
Hey, don't look at me, man. Mexicans still get shit

770
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,640
for the fucking Alamo. Los Angeles.

771
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,640
Dragons over Los Angeles.

772
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,640
Fairy lives don't matter

773
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,640
today.

774
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,640
Well,

775
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,640
we're gonna go through that point by point.

776
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,640
I'm sorry. I had to.

777
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,640
Bright made me do it.

778
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,640
This fucking movie. Number one, the Crips.

779
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,640
Let's Crip-walk your

780
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,640
asses on back to the barbecue. The history of the Crips

781
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,640
stems from a variety of factors, namely

782
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,640
segregationist housing policies leading up to

783
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,640
World War II and the FBI systemic eradication

784
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,640
of the original Black Panther Party in the late 1960s,

785
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,640
leaving a power vacuum in south-central

786
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,640
LA and a lot of 17-year-olds with

787
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,640
guns. These segregationist housing policies

788
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,640
arose not long after Jim Crow forced many Black

789
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,640
Southerners to immigrate to the west coast in the early

790
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,640
20th century, which directly results

791
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,640
from the diaspora after the Civil War, which

792
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,640
was fought over slavery. Ergo,

793
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,640
it follows that the Atlantic slave

794
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,640
trade existed in the Bright

795
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,640
Universe. Number two, Shrek

796
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,640
exists. To take your fat,

797
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,640
Shrek-looking ass back

798
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,640
to your vehicle and drive the fuck home

799
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,640
to Fiona. Meaning that Jeffrey Katzenberg

800
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,640
exists, and the Disney Company

801
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,640
exists, and it made its bread and butter from

802
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,640
fairy tales, which are just normal tales

803
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,640
in this universe, but okay. Meaning

804
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,640
that Jeffrey Katzenberg was let go from the Disney Company

805
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,640
after 15 years and an acrimonious

806
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,640
multi-million dollar settlement and several lawsuits,

807
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,640
and after several failed attempts at 2D animation,

808
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,640
Dreamworks broke through with its pastiche and version

809
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,640
of fairy tale tropes, Shrek.

810
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,640
The Alamo exists.

811
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,640
Hey, don't look at me, man. Mexicans

812
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,640
still get shit for the fucking Alamo.

813
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,640
Were there orcs there, too?

814
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,640
If there's so much strike between non-human

815
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,640
races, why is there inter-human

816
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,640
racism? Was there chattel slavery of orcs

817
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,640
in addition to black people, and that's why

818
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,640
orcs seem to all have European

819
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,640
white surnames? Was the

820
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,640
Alamo a bigger deal in this universe?

821
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,640
Because Mexican-Americans get shit for a lot of

822
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,640
things. I thought you were out having your, like,

823
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,640
zillionth baby. The Alamo is not

824
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,640
one of those things. What was

825
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,640
the nine races? Were Mexicans

826
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,640
one of the nine races? I see you.

827
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,640
I see you typing those comments about

828
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,640
how I'm overthinking this, and you know,

829
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,640
yeah, it's true, but why are you watching this channel anyway?

830
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,640
But, you know, I can't

831
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,640
help it, and people say

832
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,640
that they're interested in the world-building

833
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,640
of Bright, and I'm like,

834
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,640
there isn't any. It's just

835
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,640
Star World with some

836
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,640
fantasy stuff slapped on top.

837
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,640
Los Angeles exists, meaning a Franciscan

838
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,640
mission settlement was built in the 18th century, meaning

839
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,640
the Catholic Church maintained its dominion over Spain,

840
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,640
meaning the War of Nine Races, a thing that is so

841
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,640
big a deal that in 2,000 years after the fact,

842
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,640
it warrants graffiti, was not such a big deal

843
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,640
that Emperor Constantine couldn't make

844
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,640
Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire

845
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,640
in the 4th century AD.

846
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,640
You cannot include elements

847
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,640
from our real world without importing

848
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,640
the history that comes with them.

849
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,640
I mean, you can, it's just,

850
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,640
you know, it's lazy and it sucks.

851
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,640
This is why modern sci-fi and fantasy

852
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,640
with alternate histories are so rare,

853
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,640
and the ones you do see, like The Man

854
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,640
in the High Castle and Bioshock Infinite,

855
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,640
have relatively recent divergent points

856
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,640
in history. Sure, you could give us an

857
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,640
alternate fantasy past that resulted in a

858
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,640
similar present with cars and stuff,

859
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,640
but the histories can't be the same.

860
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,640
L.A. wouldn't exist, Shrek wouldn't

861
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,640
exist, the crypts wouldn't exist,

862
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,640
it doesn't make sense for there to be racism

863
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,640
against Mexicans or black

864
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,640
people if we're so

865
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,640
bigoted against orcs.

866
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,640
Everywhere I go, live orcs always

867
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,640
gotta be the bad guys.

868
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,640
And elves.

869
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,640
So instead of an organic

870
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,640
world where the history is woven in,

871
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,640
it's just our world with fantasy elements

872
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,640
slapped on top, like magnets

873
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,640
on a fridge.

874
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,640
I know, building an alternate history

875
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,640
and weaving it in would have been difficult.

876
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,640
So they just didn't bother, and

877
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,640
it's just lazy, and it sucks.

878
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,640
We will not be listening to no orcish music.

879
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,640
The whole root of this entire

880
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,640
monstrosity of a video,

881
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,640
of me complaining about Brite

882
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,640
for 45 minutes, which you have

883
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,640
now sat through, good for you, thanks

884
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,640
for that, is because

885
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,640
I could not stop thinking about

886
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,640
this one line

887
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,640
from Sheriff's Deputy

888
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,640
Rodriguez.

889
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,640
No, Rodriguez, they don't.

890
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,640
And it's played as a joke, like we the audience

891
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,640
are supposed to get and understand it.

892
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,640
Like, yes, ha ha ha, we do

893
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,640
give Mexicans shit for the Alamo.

894
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,640
I personally told my neighbor Jorge

895
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,640
to remember it just the other day.

896
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,640
But it reveals both the ignorance and the

897
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,640
incuriosity of the filmmakers.

898
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,640
It understands that movies about racism

899
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,640
win awards,

900
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,640
but has no curiosity to its causes

901
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,640
or its roots. So by reducing

902
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,640
bigotry to single, definable, and justifiable

903
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,640
historical events, like a lot of

904
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,640
the fantasy genre does with its worldbuilding,

905
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,640
reducing bigotry to single,

906
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,640
justifiable, and even understandable conflicts

907
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,640
makes racism feel that much

908
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,640
more reasonable. Logical, even.

909
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,640
Mexicans get shit because of the Alamo.

910
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,640
Orcs get shit because of the

911
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,640
Dark Lord. Racism is bad,

912
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,640
but, you know,

913
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,640
people have legit reasons for being racist.

914
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,640
Like black men

915
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,640
consciously playing into stereotypes.

916
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,640
And the Alamo.

917
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,640
This is a massive shortcoming of movies like

918
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,640
Crash and Brite.

919
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,640
They seek to understand the logic behind

920
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,640
racism, but racism isn't

921
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,640
logical. And you can't logic people

922
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,640
out of a mindset they did not logic

923
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,640
themselves into. Chance the Rapper

924
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,640
commented in a tweet after watching Brite,

925
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,640
I always feel a little cheated when I see allegorical

926
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,640
racism in movies, because that racism usually

927
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,640
stems from human emotion or tolerance,

928
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,640
but not by law or systems the way it is

929
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,640
in real life. The world of this movie

930
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,640
reaches for edgy and topical, but is just lazy

931
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,640
and careless. All it wants is to

932
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,640
import the facade of urban, gangsta

933
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,640
flavor. And the language of bigotry

934
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,640
in these movies is so cartoonish that no

935
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,640
one would see it in themselves.

936
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,640
Dwarfs have mad hops.

937
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,640
This is a popular go-to when trying to capture the

938
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,640
language of casual racism in movies.

939
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,640
The focus on historical events.

940
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,640
The army of nine races fought shoulder

941
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,640
to shoulder to give you the world

942
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,640
you neglect. The focus on affirmative

943
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,640
action. And what happens if they hire more

944
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,640
of them? I can't look at you without thinking

945
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,640
about the five or six more qualified white

946
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,640
men who didn't get your job. What the fuck about

947
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,640
my demeanor gives you the impression

948
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,640
that I want to be a target on the department's

949
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,640
work diversity radar. Yes, white bitterness

950
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,640
about affirmative action and corporate diversity

951
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,640
initiatives is certainly a thing.

952
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,640
But this captures that bitterness poorly because

953
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,640
if you use the actual language of casual racism

954
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,640
you run the risk of offending casual racists

955
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,640
which is a huge demographic.

956
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,640
Tonight's the trifecta. Is that your cousin?

957
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,640
Full moon. Friday night.

958
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,640
Summer heat wave.

959
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,640
So you use the language of cartoon

960
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,640
casual racism and never have to run the risk

961
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,640
of making the audience question whether they are

962
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,640
seeing themselves in the bad guys.

963
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,640
How many orcs play pro basketball?

964
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,640
None. They're slow. They're heavy.

965
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,640
That's why half the NFL defensive lines

966
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,640
are orcish. It's not racism. It's physics.

967
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,640
Reduce the outcome of racism

968
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,640
to a kick me sign and justify

969
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,640
racism and bigotry by pointing to historical

970
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,640
events where entire ethnic groups made

971
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,640
an oopsie daisy. Hey, don't look at me, man.

972
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,640
Mexicans still get shit for the fucking Alamo.

973
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,640
Fantasy world building is always going to be a

974
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,640
reflection of the author's experiences

975
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,640
and you will have blind spots or biases that

976
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,640
will manifest themselves in the work.

977
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,640
The problem isn't just that this world is too close to

978
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,640
our own, so inevitably you can't help but

979
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,640
impose our world logic onto it.

980
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,640
It isn't just that being on the nose with your race

981
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,640
allegory might read as tone deaf.

982
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,640
Fairy lives don't matter today.

983
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,640
And it isn't just that fairy lives don't

984
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,640
matter. Really, it's just

985
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,640
that it's incurious and lazy

986
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,640
but it doesn't want to be.

987
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,640
And that is what makes it disappointing.

988
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,640
Remember when music

989
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,640
sold so well that people would use

990
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,640
it to promote movies? Yes, they do.

991
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,640
Yeah. We're going to make this a franchise.

992
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,640
Okay. We're going to

993
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,640
have a knockoff animated TV show.

994
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,640
It's going to be on Fox on Saturday mornings.

995
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,640
Saturday morning cartoons.

996
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,640
That's still a thing, right?

997
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,640
No.

998
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,640
Yeah.
