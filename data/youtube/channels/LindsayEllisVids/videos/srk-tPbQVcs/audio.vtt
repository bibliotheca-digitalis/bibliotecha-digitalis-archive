00:00.000 --> 00:04.280
Okay, so first up, we're getting my least favorite area of film studies out of the way.

00:05.040 --> 00:07.040
It's auteur theory.

00:14.380 --> 00:16.380
So when I was an undergrad in like the

00:16.800 --> 00:22.340
1650s or whatever, auteur theory always kind of turned me off because film by its very nature

00:22.960 --> 00:26.440
is a collaborative art and with some very rare exceptions

00:26.440 --> 00:33.000
no film is the sole product of one person. When I was first introduced to auteur theory, it came across to me as a sort

00:33.000 --> 00:34.560
of celebration of

00:34.560 --> 00:36.840
egomania, like we're going to give a reach around to these

00:37.080 --> 00:43.800
self-impressed nicotine-soaked French dudes for being the most important person on a set and then invent an entire field of academia to justify it.

00:43.800 --> 00:47.800
I say it came across to me like that because that's what it is.

00:49.840 --> 00:55.800
Okay, okay, yeah, I'm not being completely fair. Even in its super original form, auteur theory wasn't just about, hey,

00:55.920 --> 00:59.720
look how important we are over here with our voice-driven films.

00:59.720 --> 01:06.160
It was mainly about trying to get audiences and critics to see film as an art form, not just as commercial product,

01:06.280 --> 01:11.760
similar to the conversations surrounding video games as art we see today. Auteur theory also has some good points.

01:11.760 --> 01:18.560
It holds that there is a distinct style and preoccupation throughout a director's body of work, and you can see this in action with most directors.

01:19.080 --> 01:24.640
Spielberg with his dad thing, Tarantino with his revenge thing, and Michael Bay with his...

01:26.440 --> 01:29.040
I ate the whole plate. The whole plate.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.520
Well, we'll get to that.

01:31.520 --> 01:37.180
Auteurism came out of the French New Wave in the 1940s, and film critics and theorists of the time developed the idea of the French

01:37.320 --> 01:43.380
auteur in contrast to the Hollywood studio system, with the very real implication that, yes, this was more art than

01:43.840 --> 01:49.680
whatever garbage the Hollywood machine was spitting out in the 1940s, like Casablanca and Citizen Kane.

01:50.480 --> 01:51.680
Tch.

01:51.680 --> 01:57.840
Francois Truffaut developed this idea further in the 1950s, with the assertion that it was the director's job to inject

01:58.000 --> 02:05.240
politique into the film. Truffaut believed that a film was inexorably tied to the creative vision of a single author, the director.

02:05.640 --> 02:12.780
According to Truffaut, there are no good and bad movies, only good and bad directors. Truffaut believed that greatness was a measure of

02:13.120 --> 02:19.560
originality and vision rather than of craft, and that ultimately it is more important for a film to be interesting than good.

02:19.800 --> 02:27.320
And I can kind of get behind that. You know, quality is great and all, but art and medium can only really evolve if it evokes some

02:27.320 --> 02:34.940
reaction in the audience. The term auteur theory was coined by American film writer Andrew Sarris in his essay, Notes on the Auteur Theory, in

02:35.400 --> 02:41.320
1962. The following year, Jean-Luc Godard's Contempt was released, and it is something of a culmination of the idea of

02:41.560 --> 02:48.280
auteurship as defined by the French New Wave in opposition to the studio system. Exploring themes of authorship in conflict with the shallow

02:48.600 --> 02:50.600
superficiality of Hollywood.

02:50.600 --> 02:57.600
According to Andrew Sarris, a filmmaker can only be considered a true auteur as if he is in position of the following attributes of increasing importance.

02:58.200 --> 03:05.560
Number one, technical competence. Says Sarris, a great director must be at least a good director. Number two, a distinguishing personality.

03:05.760 --> 03:14.200
And number three, interior meaning within the work. Sarris cites the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Jean Renoir, Fritz Lang, and D.W. Griffith as

03:14.400 --> 03:21.360
true auteurs. Auteur Theory, Sarris' version in particular, saw some of its earliest pushback in the writing of Pauline Kael.

03:21.640 --> 03:25.560
I'm Pauline Kael, and I write about movies for the New Yorker.

03:25.640 --> 03:32.120
According to Kael, entangling the perceived quality or meaning of one film with the director's body of work indicates that you are not capable of

03:32.120 --> 03:38.280
really judging either. When a famous director makes a good movie, we look at the movie. We don't think about the director's

03:38.640 --> 03:45.840
personality. For instance, the existence of, say, The Rock doesn't make Transformers 3 any less terrible, and the

03:46.400 --> 03:53.920
anti-authoritarian undertones in The Rock don't refute the authoritarian themes in Transformers 3. Kael argued that we should judge the auteur by the art,

03:54.120 --> 03:56.120
not the art by the auteur.

03:56.680 --> 04:00.120
But there is a Marxist influence in early ideas of auteur theory as well.

04:00.280 --> 04:05.240
We see it in contempt. Auteurism is, by its very nature, stilted by commercialism.

04:05.680 --> 04:11.800
See, if you're worried about the market and what your audience will or will not buy, then you can't make real art, man.

04:19.800 --> 04:27.600
If the whole thrust behind classical auteur theory is that the true auteur must exist outside of the system of unrestrained capitalism and commercialism,

04:28.160 --> 04:31.520
then can Michael Bay be considered a true auteur?

04:32.000 --> 04:36.160
Hey, I'm Michael Bay, and I am a strong believer in protecting the cinema experience.

04:50.400 --> 04:56.960
To which I would ask, what if unrestrained and undeniable commercialism is the author's vision?

04:57.800 --> 05:01.080
Let's use Saris's model. First, technical competence.

05:01.600 --> 05:06.560
Every frame of painting did an excellent rundown on the technical stylings of Michael Bay and what defined them,

05:06.560 --> 05:08.400
so I'm not going to spend a lot of time on that.

05:08.400 --> 05:14.000
But it is nothing if not distinct. Bay's stylistic ethos is summed up in the very name of his official website,

05:14.320 --> 05:19.720
Shoot for the Edit, which is a calm, simple ethos especially relevant in the thing that Bay is most known for,

05:20.320 --> 05:23.840
action scenes. Does Michael Bay have a distinguishing personality?

05:26.520 --> 05:28.520
Hold those. What is that?

05:29.480 --> 05:35.840
What? I wear one when I'm in a funk. Mojo, no dominating Frankie. What you're about to see is top secret.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.680
Do not tell my mother.

05:39.560 --> 05:41.560
I ate the whole plate.

05:42.600 --> 05:48.800
Yes, and an interior meaning throughout his work. I would argue that this third criteria makes the best case for Michael Bay.

05:48.880 --> 05:53.000
It would be one thing if Bay's mark as a director was all point one and

05:53.160 --> 05:57.680
no points two and three. That would put him more in the sort of bland,

05:58.160 --> 06:00.960
milquetoast camp with the likes of Brett Ratner.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.360
But Bay's movies are imbued with

06:04.800 --> 06:11.600
worldview and meaning. Michael Bay movies all portray a distinct point of view, one which even casual filmgoers can nail down.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.520
It squirts the fuel in so you can go faster. Oh.

06:16.520 --> 06:20.200
I like to go faster. Some subtext of Michael Bay movies include

06:21.120 --> 06:27.200
male protagonist eager to push back against own inadequacy, soldiers good, government bad,

06:28.120 --> 06:30.120
minorities are loud, and that's funny.

06:30.120 --> 06:32.120
I don't know, boss. I've never seen that. That's loco.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.120
Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me, man.

06:34.280 --> 06:37.400
Bay's very distinct visuals and the list goes on.

06:37.520 --> 06:44.200
The Transformers films were not the first to receive generous subsidies from the US Department of Defense to basically act as an official recruitment tools,

06:44.200 --> 06:46.800
and this isn't just Bay being an opportunist.

06:46.800 --> 06:51.560
He is a private person, but he is not just posturing when it comes to the subject of supporting the military.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.880
Simmons? Yes, sir? I do what he says.

06:55.920 --> 07:02.540
Losing's really not an option for these guys. Every piece of every Michael Bay movie, from the aesthetic, to the edit, to the sound design,

07:05.540 --> 07:09.480
to its portrayal of women and minorities, to the government and the military,

07:10.040 --> 07:16.240
authority and subordinates, the weak and the powerful, it may seem schizophrenic and at times wildly contradictory.

07:16.280 --> 07:21.240
But despite the studio oversight, corporate demands, and the inherently collaborative nature of film,

07:21.480 --> 07:25.120
Bay's movies always retain a very distinct personality.

07:25.280 --> 07:28.080
But there is also a flip side to the idea of auteur theory,

07:28.160 --> 07:32.240
one that cares not one whit about the collaborative aspect of film as a medium.

07:32.240 --> 07:37.360
Auteur theory was really gaining steam at the same time in American academia as another theory was gaining popularity,

07:37.800 --> 07:42.940
arguably in response to the idea of auteur theory, Death of the Author, which was articulated in

07:43.420 --> 07:48.880
1967 by French literary critic and theorist Roland Barthes in the essay La Monde de l'Orteur.

07:49.060 --> 07:53.640
Barthes argues against the traditional literary critical practice of incorporating authorial intent.

07:54.020 --> 07:59.980
Intent is meaningless, says Barthes, and that all products of an artist should independently exist of each other.

08:00.100 --> 08:06.160
So whatever Michael Bay thinks about, say, the military or capitalism or black people or women,

08:06.580 --> 08:08.580
all of that is irrelevant to...

08:09.220 --> 08:11.220
All of that is irrelevant.

08:21.380 --> 08:25.860
Sorry, yeah, I think I've been thinking about Michael Bay too much.

08:25.860 --> 08:29.140
Anyway, all of that is irrelevant to what the audience reads.

08:29.140 --> 08:34.180
And the thing is, we don't really know what he thinks about all of these things except for the military.

08:34.220 --> 08:36.500
He likes it, and animal welfare.

08:36.500 --> 08:41.900
He really cares about dogs, you guys. Other than that, he uses his medium to communicate his worldview,

08:41.900 --> 08:43.860
but he never discusses intent.

08:43.860 --> 08:49.140
He has described himself as a deeply political person, but will not go into what that actually means.

08:49.580 --> 08:54.100
Michael Bay is a great example of why absolutism on either of these theories doesn't really work,

08:54.100 --> 08:57.260
but you can't really discount either theory completely either.

08:57.420 --> 09:02.700
He's a great example of an auteur, his movies have a very distinct politique and style,

09:02.940 --> 09:07.460
but he's also a great example of death of the author. He deliberately keeps his intent to himself.

09:07.620 --> 09:11.100
There's this idea of Bay as a sort of totalitarian maniac.

09:11.100 --> 09:12.620
How's Michael Bay to work with?

09:12.620 --> 09:17.140
You know, it's like looking into the mind of madness,

09:17.140 --> 09:21.540
and then having it tell you, like, move out of my way, I'm trying to get this shot.

09:21.540 --> 09:27.580
And I think the irony of a strict auteurist reading a la Truffaut is that Bay probably would side more with Pauline Kael.

09:27.740 --> 09:29.740
He may or may not be an egomaniac,

09:30.060 --> 09:32.660
worded in the industry is mixed, to put it lightly.

09:33.140 --> 09:37.700
This has to be all grips on hand with this thing, and it's not to move under the tail. You understand me?

09:37.700 --> 09:38.260
Yes, sir.

09:38.260 --> 09:40.260
All right, am I very clear? Good.

09:40.260 --> 09:42.260
Working with Michael Bay is, it's not a picnic.

09:42.260 --> 09:46.940
And that still does not shed any light onto his worldview or what he is trying to do.

09:47.140 --> 09:52.260
Bay's style is distinct, but like Kael, he clearly thinks that the work should speak for itself.

09:52.420 --> 09:57.860
So, we may not have an on-the-record manifesto of Bay's authorial intent,

09:58.380 --> 10:02.220
but we can pretty strongly infer that he does have one.

10:02.400 --> 10:07.460
So, in that regard, Bay definitely falls into Truffaut's ideas on an auteur politique,

10:07.460 --> 10:14.060
and in the intersection between the Bay politique and Transformers lies the answer both to why the films have been so successful,

10:14.060 --> 10:17.260
and why many fans of the franchise find the film so noxious.

10:17.340 --> 10:23.380
Bay politique appeals to a mainstream, but it does not line up with the sincere honorship of nostalgia.

10:27.780 --> 10:31.940
The message in Michael Bay's Transformers movies about Transformers is not,

10:32.060 --> 10:35.900
let's leave these wonderful creations in the innocent world of children where they belong,

10:35.980 --> 10:41.300
it's more along the lines of, why would you want to play with plastic toys when you can play with titties, you f***ing losers?

10:41.300 --> 10:47.180
Take a look at this 1939 Delahaye 165 Cabriolet, designed by a Frenchman.

10:47.740 --> 10:50.100
Look at the curves. Elegant, isn't it?

10:50.580 --> 10:58.060
So, when people say Michael Bay raped my childhood, or used to say, you don't really see that phrase being thrown around so much anymore,

10:58.140 --> 11:03.300
what they really mean is Michael Bay added politique to something innocent.

11:03.740 --> 11:09.340
Michael Bay took this memory of a property that I hold fondly and robbed it of its magical, nostalgic value

11:09.380 --> 11:14.740
by dragging it into this idea of things that really matter, like the military, titties, and cars,

11:18.740 --> 11:23.340
which are all shown as vastly superior to the child-like quality of the franchise itself.

11:26.340 --> 11:31.540
It isn't really even about political affiliation or worldview so much as its reverence for the source material,

11:31.540 --> 11:33.340
of which Michael Bay has none.

11:33.740 --> 11:38.740
So, you can really get more in-depth with the robots this time, and that's what we tried to do different than the other movies.

11:38.740 --> 11:43.740
Which is why people who have a vague memory of the Transformers franchise, i.e. most people,

11:43.740 --> 11:49.740
tend to respond more positively to these movies than people with a more intense knowledge and affinity for the franchise.

11:49.740 --> 11:55.740
They're so good, you know, and there's a lot of bad in the world, and it's like, they're always doing the right thing.

11:56.140 --> 11:58.140
Give me your face!

11:59.140 --> 12:06.140
But in terms of Michael Bay's preoccupation, as well as his influence, his technical prowess remains the most important.

12:06.140 --> 12:11.140
It is both his defining attribute, as well as his greatest limitation.

12:25.740 --> 12:30.740
Thanks for watching!
