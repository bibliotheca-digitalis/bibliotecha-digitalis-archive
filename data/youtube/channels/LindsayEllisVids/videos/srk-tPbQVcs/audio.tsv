0	4280	Okay, so first up, we're getting my least favorite area of film studies out of the way.
5040	7040	It's auteur theory.
14380	16380	So when I was an undergrad in like the
16800	22340	1650s or whatever, auteur theory always kind of turned me off because film by its very nature
22960	26440	is a collaborative art and with some very rare exceptions
26440	33000	no film is the sole product of one person. When I was first introduced to auteur theory, it came across to me as a sort
33000	34560	of celebration of
34560	36840	egomania, like we're going to give a reach around to these
37080	43800	self-impressed nicotine-soaked French dudes for being the most important person on a set and then invent an entire field of academia to justify it.
43800	47800	I say it came across to me like that because that's what it is.
49840	55800	Okay, okay, yeah, I'm not being completely fair. Even in its super original form, auteur theory wasn't just about, hey,
55920	59720	look how important we are over here with our voice-driven films.
59720	66160	It was mainly about trying to get audiences and critics to see film as an art form, not just as commercial product,
66280	71760	similar to the conversations surrounding video games as art we see today. Auteur theory also has some good points.
71760	78560	It holds that there is a distinct style and preoccupation throughout a director's body of work, and you can see this in action with most directors.
79080	84640	Spielberg with his dad thing, Tarantino with his revenge thing, and Michael Bay with his...
86440	89040	I ate the whole plate. The whole plate.
89520	91520	Well, we'll get to that.
91520	97180	Auteurism came out of the French New Wave in the 1940s, and film critics and theorists of the time developed the idea of the French
97320	103380	auteur in contrast to the Hollywood studio system, with the very real implication that, yes, this was more art than
103840	109680	whatever garbage the Hollywood machine was spitting out in the 1940s, like Casablanca and Citizen Kane.
110480	111680	Tch.
111680	117840	Francois Truffaut developed this idea further in the 1950s, with the assertion that it was the director's job to inject
118000	125240	politique into the film. Truffaut believed that a film was inexorably tied to the creative vision of a single author, the director.
125640	132780	According to Truffaut, there are no good and bad movies, only good and bad directors. Truffaut believed that greatness was a measure of
133120	139560	originality and vision rather than of craft, and that ultimately it is more important for a film to be interesting than good.
139800	147320	And I can kind of get behind that. You know, quality is great and all, but art and medium can only really evolve if it evokes some
147320	154940	reaction in the audience. The term auteur theory was coined by American film writer Andrew Sarris in his essay, Notes on the Auteur Theory, in
155400	161320	1962. The following year, Jean-Luc Godard's Contempt was released, and it is something of a culmination of the idea of
161560	168280	auteurship as defined by the French New Wave in opposition to the studio system. Exploring themes of authorship in conflict with the shallow
168600	170600	superficiality of Hollywood.
170600	177600	According to Andrew Sarris, a filmmaker can only be considered a true auteur as if he is in position of the following attributes of increasing importance.
178200	185560	Number one, technical competence. Says Sarris, a great director must be at least a good director. Number two, a distinguishing personality.
185760	194200	And number three, interior meaning within the work. Sarris cites the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Jean Renoir, Fritz Lang, and D.W. Griffith as
194400	201360	true auteurs. Auteur Theory, Sarris' version in particular, saw some of its earliest pushback in the writing of Pauline Kael.
201640	205560	I'm Pauline Kael, and I write about movies for the New Yorker.
205640	212120	According to Kael, entangling the perceived quality or meaning of one film with the director's body of work indicates that you are not capable of
212120	218280	really judging either. When a famous director makes a good movie, we look at the movie. We don't think about the director's
218640	225840	personality. For instance, the existence of, say, The Rock doesn't make Transformers 3 any less terrible, and the
226400	233920	anti-authoritarian undertones in The Rock don't refute the authoritarian themes in Transformers 3. Kael argued that we should judge the auteur by the art,
234120	236120	not the art by the auteur.
236680	240120	But there is a Marxist influence in early ideas of auteur theory as well.
240280	245240	We see it in contempt. Auteurism is, by its very nature, stilted by commercialism.
245680	251800	See, if you're worried about the market and what your audience will or will not buy, then you can't make real art, man.
259800	267600	If the whole thrust behind classical auteur theory is that the true auteur must exist outside of the system of unrestrained capitalism and commercialism,
268160	271520	then can Michael Bay be considered a true auteur?
272000	276160	Hey, I'm Michael Bay, and I am a strong believer in protecting the cinema experience.
290400	296960	To which I would ask, what if unrestrained and undeniable commercialism is the author's vision?
297800	301080	Let's use Saris's model. First, technical competence.
301600	306560	Every frame of painting did an excellent rundown on the technical stylings of Michael Bay and what defined them,
306560	308400	so I'm not going to spend a lot of time on that.
308400	314000	But it is nothing if not distinct. Bay's stylistic ethos is summed up in the very name of his official website,
314320	319720	Shoot for the Edit, which is a calm, simple ethos especially relevant in the thing that Bay is most known for,
320320	323840	action scenes. Does Michael Bay have a distinguishing personality?
326520	328520	Hold those. What is that?
329480	335840	What? I wear one when I'm in a funk. Mojo, no dominating Frankie. What you're about to see is top secret.
336680	338680	Do not tell my mother.
339560	341560	I ate the whole plate.
342600	348800	Yes, and an interior meaning throughout his work. I would argue that this third criteria makes the best case for Michael Bay.
348880	353000	It would be one thing if Bay's mark as a director was all point one and
353160	357680	no points two and three. That would put him more in the sort of bland,
358160	360960	milquetoast camp with the likes of Brett Ratner.
361360	364360	But Bay's movies are imbued with
364800	371600	worldview and meaning. Michael Bay movies all portray a distinct point of view, one which even casual filmgoers can nail down.
371720	374520	It squirts the fuel in so you can go faster. Oh.
376520	380200	I like to go faster. Some subtext of Michael Bay movies include
381120	387200	male protagonist eager to push back against own inadequacy, soldiers good, government bad,
388120	390120	minorities are loud, and that's funny.
390120	392120	I don't know, boss. I've never seen that. That's loco.
392120	394120	Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me, man.
394280	397400	Bay's very distinct visuals and the list goes on.
397520	404200	The Transformers films were not the first to receive generous subsidies from the US Department of Defense to basically act as an official recruitment tools,
404200	406800	and this isn't just Bay being an opportunist.
406800	411560	He is a private person, but he is not just posturing when it comes to the subject of supporting the military.
412400	414880	Simmons? Yes, sir? I do what he says.
415920	422540	Losing's really not an option for these guys. Every piece of every Michael Bay movie, from the aesthetic, to the edit, to the sound design,
425540	429480	to its portrayal of women and minorities, to the government and the military,
430040	436240	authority and subordinates, the weak and the powerful, it may seem schizophrenic and at times wildly contradictory.
436280	441240	But despite the studio oversight, corporate demands, and the inherently collaborative nature of film,
441480	445120	Bay's movies always retain a very distinct personality.
445280	448080	But there is also a flip side to the idea of auteur theory,
448160	452240	one that cares not one whit about the collaborative aspect of film as a medium.
452240	457360	Auteur theory was really gaining steam at the same time in American academia as another theory was gaining popularity,
457800	462940	arguably in response to the idea of auteur theory, Death of the Author, which was articulated in
463420	468880	1967 by French literary critic and theorist Roland Barthes in the essay La Monde de l'Orteur.
469060	473640	Barthes argues against the traditional literary critical practice of incorporating authorial intent.
474020	479980	Intent is meaningless, says Barthes, and that all products of an artist should independently exist of each other.
480100	486160	So whatever Michael Bay thinks about, say, the military or capitalism or black people or women,
486580	488580	all of that is irrelevant to...
489220	491220	All of that is irrelevant.
501380	505860	Sorry, yeah, I think I've been thinking about Michael Bay too much.
505860	509140	Anyway, all of that is irrelevant to what the audience reads.
509140	514180	And the thing is, we don't really know what he thinks about all of these things except for the military.
514220	516500	He likes it, and animal welfare.
516500	521900	He really cares about dogs, you guys. Other than that, he uses his medium to communicate his worldview,
521900	523860	but he never discusses intent.
523860	529140	He has described himself as a deeply political person, but will not go into what that actually means.
529580	534100	Michael Bay is a great example of why absolutism on either of these theories doesn't really work,
534100	537260	but you can't really discount either theory completely either.
537420	542700	He's a great example of an auteur, his movies have a very distinct politique and style,
542940	547460	but he's also a great example of death of the author. He deliberately keeps his intent to himself.
547620	551100	There's this idea of Bay as a sort of totalitarian maniac.
551100	552620	How's Michael Bay to work with?
552620	557140	You know, it's like looking into the mind of madness,
557140	561540	and then having it tell you, like, move out of my way, I'm trying to get this shot.
561540	567580	And I think the irony of a strict auteurist reading a la Truffaut is that Bay probably would side more with Pauline Kael.
567740	569740	He may or may not be an egomaniac,
570060	572660	worded in the industry is mixed, to put it lightly.
573140	577700	This has to be all grips on hand with this thing, and it's not to move under the tail. You understand me?
577700	578260	Yes, sir.
578260	580260	All right, am I very clear? Good.
580260	582260	Working with Michael Bay is, it's not a picnic.
582260	586940	And that still does not shed any light onto his worldview or what he is trying to do.
587140	592260	Bay's style is distinct, but like Kael, he clearly thinks that the work should speak for itself.
592420	597860	So, we may not have an on-the-record manifesto of Bay's authorial intent,
598380	602220	but we can pretty strongly infer that he does have one.
602400	607460	So, in that regard, Bay definitely falls into Truffaut's ideas on an auteur politique,
607460	614060	and in the intersection between the Bay politique and Transformers lies the answer both to why the films have been so successful,
614060	617260	and why many fans of the franchise find the film so noxious.
617340	623380	Bay politique appeals to a mainstream, but it does not line up with the sincere honorship of nostalgia.
627780	631940	The message in Michael Bay's Transformers movies about Transformers is not,
632060	635900	let's leave these wonderful creations in the innocent world of children where they belong,
635980	641300	it's more along the lines of, why would you want to play with plastic toys when you can play with titties, you f***ing losers?
641300	647180	Take a look at this 1939 Delahaye 165 Cabriolet, designed by a Frenchman.
647740	650100	Look at the curves. Elegant, isn't it?
650580	658060	So, when people say Michael Bay raped my childhood, or used to say, you don't really see that phrase being thrown around so much anymore,
658140	663300	what they really mean is Michael Bay added politique to something innocent.
663740	669340	Michael Bay took this memory of a property that I hold fondly and robbed it of its magical, nostalgic value
669380	674740	by dragging it into this idea of things that really matter, like the military, titties, and cars,
678740	683340	which are all shown as vastly superior to the child-like quality of the franchise itself.
686340	691540	It isn't really even about political affiliation or worldview so much as its reverence for the source material,
691540	693340	of which Michael Bay has none.
693740	698740	So, you can really get more in-depth with the robots this time, and that's what we tried to do different than the other movies.
698740	703740	Which is why people who have a vague memory of the Transformers franchise, i.e. most people,
703740	709740	tend to respond more positively to these movies than people with a more intense knowledge and affinity for the franchise.
709740	715740	They're so good, you know, and there's a lot of bad in the world, and it's like, they're always doing the right thing.
716140	718140	Give me your face!
719140	726140	But in terms of Michael Bay's preoccupation, as well as his influence, his technical prowess remains the most important.
726140	731140	It is both his defining attribute, as well as his greatest limitation.
745740	750740	Thanks for watching!
