1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
Okay, so first up, we're getting my least favorite area of film studies out of the way.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,040
It's auteur theory.

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,380
So when I was an undergrad in like the

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,340
1650s or whatever, auteur theory always kind of turned me off because film by its very nature

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,440
is a collaborative art and with some very rare exceptions

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:33,000
no film is the sole product of one person. When I was first introduced to auteur theory, it came across to me as a sort

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,560
of celebration of

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,840
egomania, like we're going to give a reach around to these

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:43,800
self-impressed nicotine-soaked French dudes for being the most important person on a set and then invent an entire field of academia to justify it.

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,800
I say it came across to me like that because that's what it is.

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,800
Okay, okay, yeah, I'm not being completely fair. Even in its super original form, auteur theory wasn't just about, hey,

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,720
look how important we are over here with our voice-driven films.

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:06,160
It was mainly about trying to get audiences and critics to see film as an art form, not just as commercial product,

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,760
similar to the conversations surrounding video games as art we see today. Auteur theory also has some good points.

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,560
It holds that there is a distinct style and preoccupation throughout a director's body of work, and you can see this in action with most directors.

16
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,640
Spielberg with his dad thing, Tarantino with his revenge thing, and Michael Bay with his...

17
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,040
I ate the whole plate. The whole plate.

18
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,520
Well, we'll get to that.

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,180
Auteurism came out of the French New Wave in the 1940s, and film critics and theorists of the time developed the idea of the French

20
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,380
auteur in contrast to the Hollywood studio system, with the very real implication that, yes, this was more art than

21
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,680
whatever garbage the Hollywood machine was spitting out in the 1940s, like Casablanca and Citizen Kane.

22
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,680
Tch.

23
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,840
Francois Truffaut developed this idea further in the 1950s, with the assertion that it was the director's job to inject

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,240
politique into the film. Truffaut believed that a film was inexorably tied to the creative vision of a single author, the director.

25
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,780
According to Truffaut, there are no good and bad movies, only good and bad directors. Truffaut believed that greatness was a measure of

26
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,560
originality and vision rather than of craft, and that ultimately it is more important for a film to be interesting than good.

27
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:27,320
And I can kind of get behind that. You know, quality is great and all, but art and medium can only really evolve if it evokes some

28
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:34,940
reaction in the audience. The term auteur theory was coined by American film writer Andrew Sarris in his essay, Notes on the Auteur Theory, in

29
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,320
1962. The following year, Jean-Luc Godard's Contempt was released, and it is something of a culmination of the idea of

30
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:48,280
auteurship as defined by the French New Wave in opposition to the studio system. Exploring themes of authorship in conflict with the shallow

31
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
superficiality of Hollywood.

32
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:57,600
According to Andrew Sarris, a filmmaker can only be considered a true auteur as if he is in position of the following attributes of increasing importance.

33
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:05,560
Number one, technical competence. Says Sarris, a great director must be at least a good director. Number two, a distinguishing personality.

34
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:14,200
And number three, interior meaning within the work. Sarris cites the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Jean Renoir, Fritz Lang, and D.W. Griffith as

35
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,360
true auteurs. Auteur Theory, Sarris' version in particular, saw some of its earliest pushback in the writing of Pauline Kael.

36
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,560
I'm Pauline Kael, and I write about movies for the New Yorker.

37
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:32,120
According to Kael, entangling the perceived quality or meaning of one film with the director's body of work indicates that you are not capable of

38
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,280
really judging either. When a famous director makes a good movie, we look at the movie. We don't think about the director's

39
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,840
personality. For instance, the existence of, say, The Rock doesn't make Transformers 3 any less terrible, and the

40
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,920
anti-authoritarian undertones in The Rock don't refute the authoritarian themes in Transformers 3. Kael argued that we should judge the auteur by the art,

41
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,120
not the art by the auteur.

42
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,120
But there is a Marxist influence in early ideas of auteur theory as well.

43
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,240
We see it in contempt. Auteurism is, by its very nature, stilted by commercialism.

44
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,800
See, if you're worried about the market and what your audience will or will not buy, then you can't make real art, man.

45
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:27,600
If the whole thrust behind classical auteur theory is that the true auteur must exist outside of the system of unrestrained capitalism and commercialism,

46
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,520
then can Michael Bay be considered a true auteur?

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,160
Hey, I'm Michael Bay, and I am a strong believer in protecting the cinema experience.

48
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,960
To which I would ask, what if unrestrained and undeniable commercialism is the author's vision?

49
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,080
Let's use Saris's model. First, technical competence.

50
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,560
Every frame of painting did an excellent rundown on the technical stylings of Michael Bay and what defined them,

51
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,400
so I'm not going to spend a lot of time on that.

52
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,000
But it is nothing if not distinct. Bay's stylistic ethos is summed up in the very name of his official website,

53
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,720
Shoot for the Edit, which is a calm, simple ethos especially relevant in the thing that Bay is most known for,

54
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,840
action scenes. Does Michael Bay have a distinguishing personality?

55
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,520
Hold those. What is that?

56
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:35,840
What? I wear one when I'm in a funk. Mojo, no dominating Frankie. What you're about to see is top secret.

57
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,680
Do not tell my mother.

58
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,560
I ate the whole plate.

59
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,800
Yes, and an interior meaning throughout his work. I would argue that this third criteria makes the best case for Michael Bay.

60
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,000
It would be one thing if Bay's mark as a director was all point one and

61
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,680
no points two and three. That would put him more in the sort of bland,

62
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,960
milquetoast camp with the likes of Brett Ratner.

63
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,360
But Bay's movies are imbued with

64
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,600
worldview and meaning. Michael Bay movies all portray a distinct point of view, one which even casual filmgoers can nail down.

65
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,520
It squirts the fuel in so you can go faster. Oh.

66
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,200
I like to go faster. Some subtext of Michael Bay movies include

67
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,200
male protagonist eager to push back against own inadequacy, soldiers good, government bad,

68
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,120
minorities are loud, and that's funny.

69
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,120
I don't know, boss. I've never seen that. That's loco.

70
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,120
Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me, man.

71
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,400
Bay's very distinct visuals and the list goes on.

72
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:44,200
The Transformers films were not the first to receive generous subsidies from the US Department of Defense to basically act as an official recruitment tools,

73
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,800
and this isn't just Bay being an opportunist.

74
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,560
He is a private person, but he is not just posturing when it comes to the subject of supporting the military.

75
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,880
Simmons? Yes, sir? I do what he says.

76
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:02,540
Losing's really not an option for these guys. Every piece of every Michael Bay movie, from the aesthetic, to the edit, to the sound design,

77
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,480
to its portrayal of women and minorities, to the government and the military,

78
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:16,240
authority and subordinates, the weak and the powerful, it may seem schizophrenic and at times wildly contradictory.

79
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,240
But despite the studio oversight, corporate demands, and the inherently collaborative nature of film,

80
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,120
Bay's movies always retain a very distinct personality.

81
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,080
But there is also a flip side to the idea of auteur theory,

82
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,240
one that cares not one whit about the collaborative aspect of film as a medium.

83
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,360
Auteur theory was really gaining steam at the same time in American academia as another theory was gaining popularity,

84
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,940
arguably in response to the idea of auteur theory, Death of the Author, which was articulated in

85
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,880
1967 by French literary critic and theorist Roland Barthes in the essay La Monde de l'Orteur.

86
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,640
Barthes argues against the traditional literary critical practice of incorporating authorial intent.

87
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,980
Intent is meaningless, says Barthes, and that all products of an artist should independently exist of each other.

88
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:06,160
So whatever Michael Bay thinks about, say, the military or capitalism or black people or women,

89
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,580
all of that is irrelevant to...

90
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,220
All of that is irrelevant.

91
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,860
Sorry, yeah, I think I've been thinking about Michael Bay too much.

92
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,140
Anyway, all of that is irrelevant to what the audience reads.

93
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:34,180
And the thing is, we don't really know what he thinks about all of these things except for the military.

94
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,500
He likes it, and animal welfare.

95
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,900
He really cares about dogs, you guys. Other than that, he uses his medium to communicate his worldview,

96
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,860
but he never discusses intent.

97
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:49,140
He has described himself as a deeply political person, but will not go into what that actually means.

98
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:54,100
Michael Bay is a great example of why absolutism on either of these theories doesn't really work,

99
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,260
but you can't really discount either theory completely either.

100
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,700
He's a great example of an auteur, his movies have a very distinct politique and style,

101
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,460
but he's also a great example of death of the author. He deliberately keeps his intent to himself.

102
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,100
There's this idea of Bay as a sort of totalitarian maniac.

103
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,620
How's Michael Bay to work with?

104
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,140
You know, it's like looking into the mind of madness,

105
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,540
and then having it tell you, like, move out of my way, I'm trying to get this shot.

106
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:27,580
And I think the irony of a strict auteurist reading a la Truffaut is that Bay probably would side more with Pauline Kael.

107
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,740
He may or may not be an egomaniac,

108
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,660
worded in the industry is mixed, to put it lightly.

109
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,700
This has to be all grips on hand with this thing, and it's not to move under the tail. You understand me?

110
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,260
Yes, sir.

111
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,260
All right, am I very clear? Good.

112
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,260
Working with Michael Bay is, it's not a picnic.

113
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,940
And that still does not shed any light onto his worldview or what he is trying to do.

114
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,260
Bay's style is distinct, but like Kael, he clearly thinks that the work should speak for itself.

115
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:57,860
So, we may not have an on-the-record manifesto of Bay's authorial intent,

116
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,220
but we can pretty strongly infer that he does have one.

117
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,460
So, in that regard, Bay definitely falls into Truffaut's ideas on an auteur politique,

118
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:14,060
and in the intersection between the Bay politique and Transformers lies the answer both to why the films have been so successful,

119
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,260
and why many fans of the franchise find the film so noxious.

120
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:23,380
Bay politique appeals to a mainstream, but it does not line up with the sincere honorship of nostalgia.

121
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,940
The message in Michael Bay's Transformers movies about Transformers is not,

122
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,900
let's leave these wonderful creations in the innocent world of children where they belong,

123
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:41,300
it's more along the lines of, why would you want to play with plastic toys when you can play with titties, you f***ing losers?

124
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:47,180
Take a look at this 1939 Delahaye 165 Cabriolet, designed by a Frenchman.

125
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,100
Look at the curves. Elegant, isn't it?

126
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:58,060
So, when people say Michael Bay raped my childhood, or used to say, you don't really see that phrase being thrown around so much anymore,

127
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:03,300
what they really mean is Michael Bay added politique to something innocent.

128
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:09,340
Michael Bay took this memory of a property that I hold fondly and robbed it of its magical, nostalgic value

129
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:14,740
by dragging it into this idea of things that really matter, like the military, titties, and cars,

130
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,340
which are all shown as vastly superior to the child-like quality of the franchise itself.

131
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,540
It isn't really even about political affiliation or worldview so much as its reverence for the source material,

132
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,340
of which Michael Bay has none.

133
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:38,740
So, you can really get more in-depth with the robots this time, and that's what we tried to do different than the other movies.

134
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,740
Which is why people who have a vague memory of the Transformers franchise, i.e. most people,

135
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:49,740
tend to respond more positively to these movies than people with a more intense knowledge and affinity for the franchise.

136
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:55,740
They're so good, you know, and there's a lot of bad in the world, and it's like, they're always doing the right thing.

137
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,140
Give me your face!

138
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:06,140
But in terms of Michael Bay's preoccupation, as well as his influence, his technical prowess remains the most important.

139
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:11,140
It is both his defining attribute, as well as his greatest limitation.

140
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,740
Thanks for watching!
