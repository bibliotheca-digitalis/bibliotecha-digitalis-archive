WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.500
So I'm going to talk about one last oft-overlooked but still very important contribution that this film trilogy had for the world of film, and that is, uh, this business.

00:12.500 --> 00:13.500
Oop.

00:15.500 --> 00:27.500
Nine and a half hours wasn't enough for ya? Well guess what? We had, like, every excruciating detail of the production of this thing, uh, in like, I don't know, 27 DVDs or something.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
It's actually really cool. I think this is awesome.

00:30.000 --> 00:39.000
I mean, yeah, the cuts themselves are cool because they put all this time, effort, and money into something that was effectively just for the DVD, but there's also all the stuff that comes with them.

00:39.000 --> 00:48.500
Hours and hours on technique, on music, on sound design, on miniatures, on digital grading, on special effects, on the actors and the rigorous schedule.

00:49.000 --> 00:59.000
I feel like a lot of people have this idea about filmmaking that the movie studio, like, calls the movie stork, and then they push the movie button, and then a movie gets made.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
There wasn't a huge demand to know how movies like these got made. You know, they just did it.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
But it was these DVDs that really started to sell the process as a part of the product.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
And you learn a lot about filmmaking just from these extended editions.

01:12.500 --> 01:23.500
And when studios realized that there was actually some serious demand for really in-depth DVDs like this about the process and the filmmakers and the art, hell, everyone started doing it.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.500
I think that's great.

01:25.500 --> 01:29.500
But the extended cuts of the films are interesting in their own right, especially for Return of the King.

01:29.500 --> 01:33.500
We only really see the conclusion of Aragorn's arc in the extended cut.

01:33.500 --> 01:37.500
In the extended cut, we also get the where there's a whip, there's a way scene.

01:37.500 --> 01:39.500
Also this.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
And a whole lot of character development stuff.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Stuff the casual moviegoer doesn't really want or care about.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
But if you're a fan, what up?

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
The battle scenes in Return of the King are the only battle scenes in the trilogy that I really love.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Like when Theoden gives the speech.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
This movie also benefits a lot more from variety in terms of shots and framing and lighting and the editing.

02:09.500 --> 02:12.500
Hell, the most poignant battle scene ends up being one that we don't even see.

02:26.500 --> 02:35.500
And another interesting aspect that you don't see in a lot of war movies that this one really pushes is the fact that the characters seem genuinely hopeless about their prospects.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
They're not fighting to win. They fight despite the fact they know they're going to lose.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Is there any hope, Gandalf?

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
There never was much hope.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Just a fool's hope.

02:49.000 --> 02:56.000
So there's this great contrast between the Rohirrim and Gandalf versus Denethor who has lost all hope.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
This makes the stakes much more emotionally complicated.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
What do people do when they're fighting in the face of such hopelessness?

03:02.500 --> 03:06.500
And I feel like the hopelessness thing is handled way better here than in The Two Towers.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.500
They say that it is hopeless.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.500
Though Legolas hasn't improved much.

03:12.500 --> 03:17.500
But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron's eye fixed upon us.

03:17.500 --> 03:18.500
A diversion.

03:18.500 --> 03:21.500
Thanks, plot summary guy.

03:21.500 --> 03:25.500
I never thought I'd die fighting side by side with an elf.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.500
What about side by side with a friend?

03:28.500 --> 03:31.500
Okay, I forgive your stupid one-liners, Legolas.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
I'm going to just touch on this one a little.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
There have been many, many essays and even books written on the subject of Tolkien and race

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
and divine right and imperialism and all that fun stuff.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
I'm talking more about the movies and, you know, that is an issue with the books.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
But, Tolkien did write it that way.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
And Peej did make the decision to go with it.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Like, a lot.

04:01.500 --> 04:02.500
Like, a whole lot.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.500
He might have even embellished it.

04:04.500 --> 04:05.500
A lot.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.500
It's not not there.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.500
Make of that what you will.

04:11.500 --> 04:17.500
So back to the threads that need tying up, I'd say the biggest is the ring getting destroyed.

04:17.500 --> 04:22.500
And here, as in in the book, after all that, Frodo fails.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.500
The ring is mine.

04:24.500 --> 04:29.500
One of the big changes they made, well, it's actually pretty little really, is at the mouth of Mount Doom.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
Frodo fails in his quest, claims the ring as his own, and then Gollum comes and bites his damn finger off.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
And now he has the ring.

04:41.000 --> 04:48.000
And in the book, Gollum's happy dance ended with him and the ring going into the fire in a bit of a whoopsie-daisy.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Yeah, after all that, that might have been a little bit of a letdown.

04:54.500 --> 05:00.500
A small difference that they added, but it works so much better that Frodo is so entranced with the power of the ring,

05:00.500 --> 05:05.500
finger bitten off and all, he gets up and bites Gollum over it.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.500
And then they both go down.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.500
Either way, the result is the same.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.500
Oh, hey, while we're here...

05:24.500 --> 05:29.500
And then we get deus ex... eagles.

05:29.500 --> 05:31.500
Oh, Tolkien.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.500
Eagles!

05:35.500 --> 05:37.500
The eagles are coming!

05:37.500 --> 05:39.500
You know, I'm not gonna defend that.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.500
You know, so far, so good.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.500
I mean, I don't know.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.500
I mean, I don't know.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.500
I mean, I don't know.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.500
I mean, I don't know.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.500
I mean, I don't know.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.000
You know, I'm not gonna defend that.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
You know, suffice to say the needs of the plot sometimes outweigh the needs of the logic.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
And despite the fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight,

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
the emotional machinations of this movie are fascinating to me.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
I'll use the Dark Knight trilogy as a contrast.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
And the reason I cite the Dark Knight is that those movies, the female characters aren't just in there to fill a quota,

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
they're there to fill a function, an emotional function.

06:16.000 --> 06:22.500
With the exception of Alfred, the father figure, none of the other dudes form emotional attachments to any of the other dudes.

06:22.500 --> 06:27.500
Bros don't form an emotional attachment to Commissioner Gordon, to Joseph Gordon-Levitt, to Morgan Freeman.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.500
They are just allies in a shared venture.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.500
They don't love each other.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.500
Most Hollywood movies are like that.

06:34.500 --> 06:41.500
So it's surprising that this movie has the narge to really and truly go there with the emotional attachments between all these male characters.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
They're not just allies in a war who form emotional attachments only to women and the occasional father figure.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
They love each other. Brothers. Allies.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
Hell, Legolas and Gimli expressly stick with Aragorn out of love and for no other reason.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Have you learned nothing of the stubbornness of dwarves?

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
You might as well accept it. We're going with you, laddie.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
So, of course, people went on and on and on about...

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I'm glad you're with me.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
That was an actual ad that actually ran on TBS, by the way.

07:18.000 --> 07:27.000
So, in the interest of getting an outsider perspective, I hired a sassy gay friend named Rantasmo.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Hello, Rantasmo.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Oh, hey, Lindsay. What's up?

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Girlfriend.

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
So please enlighten us with your gay wisdom. Is the gay interpretation valid?

07:41.500 --> 07:44.500
Well, because Lord of the Rings is such a sausage fest,

07:44.500 --> 07:49.500
most of the meaningful relationships in the trilogy are between male characters.

07:49.500 --> 07:52.500
The power struggle between Gandalf and Saruman,

07:52.500 --> 07:55.500
the rivalry between Sam and Gollum,

07:55.500 --> 07:57.500
the romance between Merry and Pippin,

07:57.500 --> 08:02.500
and especially the very strong friendship between Frodo and Sam.

08:02.500 --> 08:07.500
Since the only hobbit with any real love interest is Sam, and we hardly see her at all,

08:08.000 --> 08:14.000
this is the closest that our main protagonist gets to a romance subplot, in the cinematic sense.

08:14.000 --> 08:21.000
And I would argue that this relationship is significantly more compelling than the one between Aragorn and Arwen.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
I don't mean to.

08:25.000 --> 08:29.000
You know, I think there's at least one instance where women are actually at an advantage in our society.

08:29.000 --> 08:36.000
And that's that they have more latitude when it comes to forming close relationships with others of the same gender.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
Whenever men try to do the same, even if it's just as simple as basic proximity,

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
they tend to fall under what we academic types refer to as homo-suspicion.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
All it really took was a hug between two guys in a very extreme situation

08:51.000 --> 08:52.500
for audiences to start yelling,

08:52.500 --> 08:54.000
GAAAY

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
F***ING GAAAY

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
But on the whole, this didn't seem to interfere much with anyone's enjoyment of the movie.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.500
Maybe it was ambiguous enough that people could look past it.

09:03.500 --> 09:10.500
Or maybe the possibility that the hobbits, who are generally the least powerful characters in the story, were gay,

09:10.500 --> 09:13.000
just didn't seem all that threatening.

09:13.000 --> 09:20.000
And yes, for some people, the possibility of hobbit-on-hobbit love was a benefit rather than a feature.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.500
So this film became, like, a bastion of hope for gay culture.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.500
Not really.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.500
Not really?

09:27.500 --> 09:31.000
Well, I mean, as far as the gay stuff goes, it's just subtext.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
And probably unintentional subtext to that.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I mean, it's fine.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
It's just, we've seen it before.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
It's nothing special.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
Well, Ian McKellen said it did.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
Name one Ian McKellen movie with no gay subtext.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Yeah, that's what I thought.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Sassy Gay Friend Out!

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
Well, I've seen people on the side of, it's gay as hell,

09:56.000 --> 10:02.000
and I've also seen people get, like, really defensive and mad at the mere implication that the hobbits might be gay.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
But my position is this.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Who cares?

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
First off, even if one day down the line Frodo and Sam realize their big gay love for each other,

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
and yes, trauma does sometimes forge romantic bonds,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
that is not what their bond is right now.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
So what if they're gay? So what if they're not?

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
I mean, yeah, the movie does pull a touch of the not-gays with Sam here.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
If ever I was to marry someone,

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
it would have been her.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
I know I haven't mentioned this in, like, nine hours of movie, but no homo, Mr. Frodo.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
So regardless of the nature of their relationship, and I do think that nature is up for interpretation,

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
the important thing really is the strength of their bond.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
But regardless of how many people point it out,

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
which side you might sit on in the are-they-gay debate,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
the point is, you liked it.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I'm glad you're with me.

10:50.000 --> 10:56.000
Their relationship made people uncomfortable, but it was just so damn touching, so damn sincere.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Hell, Frodo even gives him a kiss at the end.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
In this day and age, it takes real nards for men to even hug in a movie,

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
but Frodo gives him a single tender kiss.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
Hell, they even used the imagery in the teaser posters.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
The teaser posters!

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
They didn't stick it in under the radar, they used it as incentive to go see the movie.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
So it did become a joke in the wider cultural sphere.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
But only because you liked it.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
It touched you emotionally.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Admit it.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Yeah.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
So then after they destroy the ring, there's this really silly scene where they, like, are jumping on the bed and laughing.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Gimli!

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
Yeah, we need some happiness as a reward for the last three hours of heaviness and misery,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
but okay, the laughing is weird, guys.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
What's funny?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Seriously, did someone tell a joke?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
What's funny?

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
And they come in one at a time, like it's the end of a Broadway show,

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
and we're supposed to be giving, like, standing ovations.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
Everyone out there who complained about the multiple endings,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
I gotta say cry more on this one.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Sorry.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
The thing I really like about this compared to Harry Potter,

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
which is also a book where the protagonist suffers a lot,

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
is that the Lord of the Rings follows Frodo for a while after the end of the plot

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
and shows that, no, he doesn't really get a happily ever after.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
And I get a lot of pushback for this opinion on the Harry Potter franchise,

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
but battle and trauma doesn't come with a reward.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
It drains you, it changes you.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
In Frodo's case, it's killing him slowly.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
How do you go on?

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
But in your heart, you begin to understand.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
There is no going back.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
So Harry gets his happily ever after,

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
marries the girl he's shown, like, a tiny little bit of interest in,

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
and then he pops out some kids, and yay?

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
I just don't buy it.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
If anything, I read this as just a facade.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
So if you ended the movie in Minas Tirith

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
and imply that the hobbits were honored forever and la-di-da and happy ending,

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
it really undermines the sacrifice they made.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
I'm really glad they didn't leave those scenes for the extended cut.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Frodo didn't really get his happy ending.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
His story, therefore, is a lot more poignant than Harry's,

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
because after all he's been through, he can't ever return to the very thing he set out to save.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
And it has been saved.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
But not for me.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
And there's this great little scene at the end with the four hobbits

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
just sitting and looking at each other like,

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
wow, we have been outside the cave.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
We can never relate to these people again.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
The damage done to Frodo wasn't just there for some shallow drama,

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
and we, the viewer, actually get to see that it had some real consequences.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
Frodo ends up having to leave the very thing he set out to save.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
And that's some real poignancy you don't see in big blockbusters.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
All these films, I think, are pretty much the best we could have realistically hoped for.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
When I look at them, particularly movies two and three,

14:12.000 --> 14:20.000
I see flaws, but only flaws in a great, wide, deeply complex, very elaborate piece of art.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
Some of the flaws come straight from the source material.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
Some involve a man running a kilometer while on fire to jump off a cliff.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
I had this guy the other day tweet at me that he considered

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
Back to the Future trilogy to be completely without flaw.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Um...

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
See, this is the thing about any work made by human hands.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
It's gonna be flawed.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
And in the case of adaptation, they're easier to spot

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
because you can see where it might have worked better

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
based on the source material that you're already familiar with.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
The Lord of the Rings hit that increasingly rare sweet spot in this day and age

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
of critical darling, beloved by the masses, and maker of lots of money.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
Return of the King, which was the only one of the three to win Best Picture,

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
was also the last one to be in the top ten grossing movies of its year.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
In nerd culture, general acceptance by the masses is too often used

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
as an excuse to discourage critical thought.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
But to me, it's upon things like this that we need to employ the most critical thought.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
Why this franchise? What appealed to it about us?

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
Why did they change what they changed so we'd like it more as filmgoers?

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
What does it say about the medium of film that they needed to make changes in the first place?

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
All discussions, I think, are worth having.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
What?

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
No, I'm legitimately out of things to say.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
We can...

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
We can move on.
