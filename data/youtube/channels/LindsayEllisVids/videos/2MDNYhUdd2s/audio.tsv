0	12500	So I'm going to talk about one last oft-overlooked but still very important contribution that this film trilogy had for the world of film, and that is, uh, this business.
12500	13500	Oop.
15500	27500	Nine and a half hours wasn't enough for ya? Well guess what? We had, like, every excruciating detail of the production of this thing, uh, in like, I don't know, 27 DVDs or something.
28000	30000	It's actually really cool. I think this is awesome.
30000	39000	I mean, yeah, the cuts themselves are cool because they put all this time, effort, and money into something that was effectively just for the DVD, but there's also all the stuff that comes with them.
39000	48500	Hours and hours on technique, on music, on sound design, on miniatures, on digital grading, on special effects, on the actors and the rigorous schedule.
49000	59000	I feel like a lot of people have this idea about filmmaking that the movie studio, like, calls the movie stork, and then they push the movie button, and then a movie gets made.
59000	64000	There wasn't a huge demand to know how movies like these got made. You know, they just did it.
64000	69000	But it was these DVDs that really started to sell the process as a part of the product.
69000	72000	And you learn a lot about filmmaking just from these extended editions.
72500	83500	And when studios realized that there was actually some serious demand for really in-depth DVDs like this about the process and the filmmakers and the art, hell, everyone started doing it.
83500	85500	I think that's great.
85500	89500	But the extended cuts of the films are interesting in their own right, especially for Return of the King.
89500	93500	We only really see the conclusion of Aragorn's arc in the extended cut.
93500	97500	In the extended cut, we also get the where there's a whip, there's a way scene.
97500	99500	Also this.
100000	102000	And a whole lot of character development stuff.
102000	105000	Stuff the casual moviegoer doesn't really want or care about.
105000	107000	But if you're a fan, what up?
109000	114000	The battle scenes in Return of the King are the only battle scenes in the trilogy that I really love.
114000	116000	Like when Theoden gives the speech.
123000	129000	This movie also benefits a lot more from variety in terms of shots and framing and lighting and the editing.
129500	132500	Hell, the most poignant battle scene ends up being one that we don't even see.
146500	155500	And another interesting aspect that you don't see in a lot of war movies that this one really pushes is the fact that the characters seem genuinely hopeless about their prospects.
156000	161000	They're not fighting to win. They fight despite the fact they know they're going to lose.
161000	163000	Is there any hope, Gandalf?
163000	165000	There never was much hope.
168000	169000	Just a fool's hope.
169000	176000	So there's this great contrast between the Rohirrim and Gandalf versus Denethor who has lost all hope.
176000	179000	This makes the stakes much more emotionally complicated.
179000	182000	What do people do when they're fighting in the face of such hopelessness?
182500	186500	And I feel like the hopelessness thing is handled way better here than in The Two Towers.
186500	188500	They say that it is hopeless.
190500	192500	Though Legolas hasn't improved much.
192500	197500	But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron's eye fixed upon us.
197500	198500	A diversion.
198500	201500	Thanks, plot summary guy.
201500	205500	I never thought I'd die fighting side by side with an elf.
205500	207500	What about side by side with a friend?
208500	211500	Okay, I forgive your stupid one-liners, Legolas.
212000	214000	I'm going to just touch on this one a little.
214000	219000	There have been many, many essays and even books written on the subject of Tolkien and race
219000	223000	and divine right and imperialism and all that fun stuff.
224000	228000	I'm talking more about the movies and, you know, that is an issue with the books.
229000	233000	But, Tolkien did write it that way.
234000	238000	And Peej did make the decision to go with it.
239000	241000	Like, a lot.
241500	242500	Like, a whole lot.
242500	244500	He might have even embellished it.
244500	245500	A lot.
247500	248500	It's not not there.
248500	250500	Make of that what you will.
251500	257500	So back to the threads that need tying up, I'd say the biggest is the ring getting destroyed.
257500	262500	And here, as in in the book, after all that, Frodo fails.
262500	264500	The ring is mine.
264500	269500	One of the big changes they made, well, it's actually pretty little really, is at the mouth of Mount Doom.
270000	275000	Frodo fails in his quest, claims the ring as his own, and then Gollum comes and bites his damn finger off.
275000	277000	And now he has the ring.
281000	288000	And in the book, Gollum's happy dance ended with him and the ring going into the fire in a bit of a whoopsie-daisy.
291000	294000	Yeah, after all that, that might have been a little bit of a letdown.
294500	300500	A small difference that they added, but it works so much better that Frodo is so entranced with the power of the ring,
300500	305500	finger bitten off and all, he gets up and bites Gollum over it.
305500	307500	And then they both go down.
307500	309500	Either way, the result is the same.
309500	311500	Oh, hey, while we're here...
324500	329500	And then we get deus ex... eagles.
329500	331500	Oh, Tolkien.
333500	335500	Eagles!
335500	337500	The eagles are coming!
337500	339500	You know, I'm not gonna defend that.
339500	341500	You know, so far, so good.
341500	343500	I mean, I don't know.
343500	345500	I mean, I don't know.
345500	347500	I mean, I don't know.
347500	349500	I mean, I don't know.
349500	351500	I mean, I don't know.
351500	353000	You know, I'm not gonna defend that.
353000	358000	You know, suffice to say the needs of the plot sometimes outweigh the needs of the logic.
360000	362000	And despite the fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight,
362000	365000	the emotional machinations of this movie are fascinating to me.
365000	368000	I'll use the Dark Knight trilogy as a contrast.
368000	373000	And the reason I cite the Dark Knight is that those movies, the female characters aren't just in there to fill a quota,
373000	376000	they're there to fill a function, an emotional function.
376000	382500	With the exception of Alfred, the father figure, none of the other dudes form emotional attachments to any of the other dudes.
382500	387500	Bros don't form an emotional attachment to Commissioner Gordon, to Joseph Gordon-Levitt, to Morgan Freeman.
387500	390500	They are just allies in a shared venture.
390500	392500	They don't love each other.
392500	394500	Most Hollywood movies are like that.
394500	401500	So it's surprising that this movie has the narge to really and truly go there with the emotional attachments between all these male characters.
402000	407000	They're not just allies in a war who form emotional attachments only to women and the occasional father figure.
407000	410000	They love each other. Brothers. Allies.
410000	415000	Hell, Legolas and Gimli expressly stick with Aragorn out of love and for no other reason.
415000	418000	Have you learned nothing of the stubbornness of dwarves?
418000	422000	You might as well accept it. We're going with you, laddie.
422000	426000	So, of course, people went on and on and on about...
428000	430000	I'm glad you're with me.
432000	435000	That was an actual ad that actually ran on TBS, by the way.
438000	447000	So, in the interest of getting an outsider perspective, I hired a sassy gay friend named Rantasmo.
447000	449000	Hello, Rantasmo.
449000	451000	Oh, hey, Lindsay. What's up?
452000	455000	Girlfriend.
455000	461000	So please enlighten us with your gay wisdom. Is the gay interpretation valid?
461500	464500	Well, because Lord of the Rings is such a sausage fest,
464500	469500	most of the meaningful relationships in the trilogy are between male characters.
469500	472500	The power struggle between Gandalf and Saruman,
472500	475500	the rivalry between Sam and Gollum,
475500	477500	the romance between Merry and Pippin,
477500	482500	and especially the very strong friendship between Frodo and Sam.
482500	487500	Since the only hobbit with any real love interest is Sam, and we hardly see her at all,
488000	494000	this is the closest that our main protagonist gets to a romance subplot, in the cinematic sense.
494000	501000	And I would argue that this relationship is significantly more compelling than the one between Aragorn and Arwen.
501000	503000	Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee.
503000	505000	I don't mean to.
505000	509000	You know, I think there's at least one instance where women are actually at an advantage in our society.
509000	516000	And that's that they have more latitude when it comes to forming close relationships with others of the same gender.
516000	521000	Whenever men try to do the same, even if it's just as simple as basic proximity,
521000	526000	they tend to fall under what we academic types refer to as homo-suspicion.
526000	531000	All it really took was a hug between two guys in a very extreme situation
531000	532500	for audiences to start yelling,
532500	534000	GAAAY
534000	536000	F***ING GAAAY
536000	540000	But on the whole, this didn't seem to interfere much with anyone's enjoyment of the movie.
540000	543500	Maybe it was ambiguous enough that people could look past it.
543500	550500	Or maybe the possibility that the hobbits, who are generally the least powerful characters in the story, were gay,
550500	553000	just didn't seem all that threatening.
553000	560000	And yes, for some people, the possibility of hobbit-on-hobbit love was a benefit rather than a feature.
560000	564500	So this film became, like, a bastion of hope for gay culture.
564500	566500	Not really.
566500	567500	Not really?
567500	571000	Well, I mean, as far as the gay stuff goes, it's just subtext.
571000	574000	And probably unintentional subtext to that.
574000	576000	I mean, it's fine.
576000	578000	It's just, we've seen it before.
578000	580000	It's nothing special.
580000	583000	Well, Ian McKellen said it did.
583000	587000	Name one Ian McKellen movie with no gay subtext.
588000	590000	Yeah, that's what I thought.
590000	592000	Sassy Gay Friend Out!
592000	596000	Well, I've seen people on the side of, it's gay as hell,
596000	602000	and I've also seen people get, like, really defensive and mad at the mere implication that the hobbits might be gay.
602000	604000	But my position is this.
604000	606000	Who cares?
606000	611000	First off, even if one day down the line Frodo and Sam realize their big gay love for each other,
611000	614000	and yes, trauma does sometimes forge romantic bonds,
614000	616000	that is not what their bond is right now.
616000	619000	So what if they're gay? So what if they're not?
619000	622000	I mean, yeah, the movie does pull a touch of the not-gays with Sam here.
622000	625000	If ever I was to marry someone,
625000	627000	it would have been her.
627000	632000	I know I haven't mentioned this in, like, nine hours of movie, but no homo, Mr. Frodo.
632000	637000	So regardless of the nature of their relationship, and I do think that nature is up for interpretation,
637000	640000	the important thing really is the strength of their bond.
640000	643000	But regardless of how many people point it out,
643000	646000	which side you might sit on in the are-they-gay debate,
646000	648000	the point is, you liked it.
648000	650000	I'm glad you're with me.
650000	656000	Their relationship made people uncomfortable, but it was just so damn touching, so damn sincere.
656000	658000	Hell, Frodo even gives him a kiss at the end.
658000	662000	In this day and age, it takes real nards for men to even hug in a movie,
662000	665000	but Frodo gives him a single tender kiss.
665000	668000	Hell, they even used the imagery in the teaser posters.
668000	670000	The teaser posters!
670000	675000	They didn't stick it in under the radar, they used it as incentive to go see the movie.
675000	679000	So it did become a joke in the wider cultural sphere.
679000	681000	But only because you liked it.
681000	684000	It touched you emotionally.
684000	686000	Admit it.
688000	689000	Yeah.
693000	698000	So then after they destroy the ring, there's this really silly scene where they, like, are jumping on the bed and laughing.
702000	704000	Gimli!
704000	709000	Yeah, we need some happiness as a reward for the last three hours of heaviness and misery,
709000	711000	but okay, the laughing is weird, guys.
716000	718000	What's funny?
718000	720000	Seriously, did someone tell a joke?
720000	721000	What's funny?
721000	724000	And they come in one at a time, like it's the end of a Broadway show,
724000	727000	and we're supposed to be giving, like, standing ovations.
727000	732000	Everyone out there who complained about the multiple endings,
732000	734000	I gotta say cry more on this one.
734000	735000	Sorry.
735000	738000	The thing I really like about this compared to Harry Potter,
738000	741000	which is also a book where the protagonist suffers a lot,
741000	745000	is that the Lord of the Rings follows Frodo for a while after the end of the plot
745000	749000	and shows that, no, he doesn't really get a happily ever after.
749000	752000	And I get a lot of pushback for this opinion on the Harry Potter franchise,
752000	755000	but battle and trauma doesn't come with a reward.
755000	757000	It drains you, it changes you.
757000	759000	In Frodo's case, it's killing him slowly.
759000	761000	How do you go on?
762000	766000	But in your heart, you begin to understand.
768000	770000	There is no going back.
770000	772000	So Harry gets his happily ever after,
772000	775000	marries the girl he's shown, like, a tiny little bit of interest in,
775000	777000	and then he pops out some kids, and yay?
777000	779000	I just don't buy it.
779000	781000	If anything, I read this as just a facade.
781000	783000	So if you ended the movie in Minas Tirith
783000	786000	and imply that the hobbits were honored forever and la-di-da and happy ending,
786000	789000	it really undermines the sacrifice they made.
789000	792000	I'm really glad they didn't leave those scenes for the extended cut.
792000	794000	Frodo didn't really get his happy ending.
794000	797000	His story, therefore, is a lot more poignant than Harry's,
797000	801000	because after all he's been through, he can't ever return to the very thing he set out to save.
801000	804000	We set out to save the Shire, Sam.
806000	808000	And it has been saved.
812000	814000	But not for me.
814000	816000	And there's this great little scene at the end with the four hobbits
816000	818000	just sitting and looking at each other like,
818000	821000	wow, we have been outside the cave.
821000	824000	We can never relate to these people again.
824000	828000	The damage done to Frodo wasn't just there for some shallow drama,
828000	832000	and we, the viewer, actually get to see that it had some real consequences.
832000	836000	Frodo ends up having to leave the very thing he set out to save.
836000	840000	And that's some real poignancy you don't see in big blockbusters.
846000	849000	All these films, I think, are pretty much the best we could have realistically hoped for.
849000	852000	When I look at them, particularly movies two and three,
852000	860000	I see flaws, but only flaws in a great, wide, deeply complex, very elaborate piece of art.
860000	863000	Some of the flaws come straight from the source material.
863000	867000	Some involve a man running a kilometer while on fire to jump off a cliff.
867000	871000	I had this guy the other day tweet at me that he considered
871000	876000	Back to the Future trilogy to be completely without flaw.
879000	880000	Um...
880000	884000	See, this is the thing about any work made by human hands.
884000	886000	It's gonna be flawed.
886000	888000	And in the case of adaptation, they're easier to spot
888000	890000	because you can see where it might have worked better
890000	893000	based on the source material that you're already familiar with.
893000	897000	The Lord of the Rings hit that increasingly rare sweet spot in this day and age
897000	902000	of critical darling, beloved by the masses, and maker of lots of money.
902000	905000	Return of the King, which was the only one of the three to win Best Picture,
905000	909000	was also the last one to be in the top ten grossing movies of its year.
909000	912000	In nerd culture, general acceptance by the masses is too often used
912000	914000	as an excuse to discourage critical thought.
914000	918000	But to me, it's upon things like this that we need to employ the most critical thought.
918000	921000	Why this franchise? What appealed to it about us?
921000	925000	Why did they change what they changed so we'd like it more as filmgoers?
925000	930000	What does it say about the medium of film that they needed to make changes in the first place?
930000	933000	All discussions, I think, are worth having.
938000	939000	What?
939000	942000	No, I'm legitimately out of things to say.
942000	943000	We can...
943000	945000	We can move on.
