1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,940
It was just over 90 minutes beyond President Bush's deadline for Saddam Hussein to leave

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:13,840
Iraq that U.S. warships and planes launched the opening salvo of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,400
The year is 2003.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,120
America prepares for war.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,560
President George W. Bush has declared that Iraq is building weapons of mass destruction

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,400
with which to attack America, and that the only possible response is a preemptive invasion.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,240
The administration's case is transparently flimsy and dishonest, both on the evidence

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,080
and the ethical justification.

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,160
And though the country is still reeling in shock from 9-11, the anti-war movement manages

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,320
to organize massive protests.

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,960
Roughly 32 million people participate worldwide over the course of four months, to no avail.

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,720
America invades against all good judgment or reason, a tragic boondoggle that would

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,120
eventually prove everyone's worst fears completely true and spark a new dark era of

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,600
global politics.

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,560
There is despair among the anti-war left, but they did have one silver lining.

16
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,240
Not much of a silver lining, in light of historic crime unfolding, but a silver lining nonetheless.

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,240
A silver lining we heard many, many people clinging to in those awful days.

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,240
Extremists are in the White House!

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,240
Extremists are in the Pentagon!

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,240
At least we're going to get a lot of great music.

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,880
Hm.

22
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,880
Hello?

23
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,880
Yeah, hi.

24
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,880
I was just listening to the video.

25
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,880
Did you literally just steal the entire intro from my Madonna Train Records video?

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,880
Like, verbatim?

27
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,880
No!

28
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,880
Well, yes, but you totally ripped off the format for the introduction to my Rent video.

29
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,880
Oh yeah, I guess I kinda did.

30
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,880
Okay.

31
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,880
Um.

32
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,880
Does that make this a collaboration?

33
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,880
I, uh, I thought people didn't do video collabs anymore.

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,520
No, see, it turns out that, like, most YouTubers never stopped doing that.

35
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,520
We just did because, you know, you never know who's going to have a Twitter meltdown, and

36
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,520
you don't want to have to be doing, like, apologies by proxy.

37
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,520
Oh yeah, yeah, that is why we stopped.

38
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,520
And no other reason.

39
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,520
No other reason.

40
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,520
So anyway.

41
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,520
Well, it's been a minute, hasn't it?

42
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,520
So I have this book coming out next month.

43
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
Pre-order link in the description.

44
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,160
And one of the more common questions I get, besides, what the hell is wrong with you,

45
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,960
is, why did you decide to set it in the 2000s instead of, you know, the nebulous present

46
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
now?

47
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,960
You know, whatever this is.

48
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,480
And to that I say, you know, besides the fact that nothing makes sense in our current hell

49
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,240
world, it makes sense in context.

50
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,320
It was a very different time.

51
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,680
So the idea for this episode came about while I was actually writing it, and I was making

52
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,240
all these playlists for, you know, mood.

53
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,640
There's also a link to my main playlist in the description.

54
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,040
It's full of mid-2000s cheese, if that's what you need to get you through this time.

55
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,000
And listening to that sort of thing made me think a lot about, you know, the resistance

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,120
music of that era.

57
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,320
Or lack thereof.

58
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,920
So while I had been working on this for a while, I was going to put it out later, you

59
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,400
know, to be more of like a tie-in release thing.

60
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,380
But then the topic of protests had to go and get all topical, so this got bumped up.

61
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:16,040
So obviously the topic of music and music history isn't exactly my wheelhouse, so I

62
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,840
wrote this with some consulting from our good friend Todd in the Shadows.

63
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,840
Thank you for the plug.

64
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,120
And if you like books, check out the new novel, Axiom's End, by my close personal friend,

65
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,600
Lindsay Ellis.

66
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,400
Gee, thanks.

67
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,600
So before we get into the era at hand, first let's take a quick look at the history of

68
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:42,000
protest music.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,240
Protest music can be found in pretty much every culture throughout the world, but you're

70
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,920
much more likely to find it in cultures that are, you know, like, oppressed and colonized.

71
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,240
Ireland, for instance, has a very long, proud history of protest songs, from Irish-language

72
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:01,240
songs like Orosheidevá Hávaile to more recent ones like Kevin Berry.

73
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:11,160
And it ranges all over the world, to the anti-apartheid music movement spearheaded

74
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,280
by black South African musicians like Hugh Masekela, all the way to broader genres of

75
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:35,920
music like British punk rock, a la The Clash, all the way to Yankee Goddamn Doodle Dandy.

76
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:48,960
Yeah, so early American protest music was like basically taking British diss tracks

77
00:04:48,960 --> 00:05:03,600
and being like, yeah, our hats are stupid, we're proud of that.

78
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,240
Now protest songs have been written and attached to movements of all sorts, from anti-racism

79
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:24,560
to feminism to gay rights to literally nothing.

80
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,360
You know, a revolution.

81
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,760
Prayin' for it.

82
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
Every day.

83
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,520
Stop singing this at karaoke.

84
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,480
But the common thread between most protest songs is that they, for obvious reasons, tend

85
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,000
to come about in times of mass disenfranchisement or injustice.

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,120
So the assumption that, hey, shit might be bad and we're all in agreement about that,

87
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,280
therefore it's time for some great art that captures the zeitgeist of the now is not unfounded.

88
00:05:51,280 --> 00:06:02,840
But what is the basis of this assumption in America specifically?

89
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,600
When people think of American protest music in pop songs, they're probably thinking

90
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,840
of the music of the late 1960s and early 1970s, specifically music surrounding the Vietnam

91
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,840
War.

92
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,920
But what was it about this war that was different from that which became before and after?

93
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,200
Well, the roots of the Vietnam War stretch back into the 19th century, and it was one

94
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,120
of those conflicts that even now people have a hard time explaining what it was really

95
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:31,600
about other than, like, you know, the vague proxy war, something-something communism.

96
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,520
And that's not, you know, completely wrong, but like most war-related topics, taking a

97
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,840
complex issue and simplifying it is not easy.

98
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,320
So to keep it simple, we have this really long, nebulous war.

99
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,340
Nobody really knows what we're fighting for.

100
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:51,900
It results in the deaths of millions of Vietnamese people by some counts, and 58,000 U.S. troops.

101
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,620
I think all the decent people in this country have decided this war is an absurdity and

102
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,820
immoral, and it's time to bring it to a halt.

103
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:06,820
We spend $322,000 for each enemy we kill in Vietnam.

104
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:12,060
Well, all I can say is I'm not as patriotic as I used to be.

105
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,380
As you can imagine, this sits very poorly with people all over the world, including

106
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:19,860
people inside the United States, who genuinely do not understand why this is a conflict that

107
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,580
should involve the U.S. military at all.

108
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,380
And that brings us to...

109
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:29,380
A-one, two, a-one, two, three, four!

110
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,860
There was a wide array of protest music that came out of this war.

111
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,660
Bands like Creedence Clearwater Revival, artists like Donovan, John Lennon, and Cat Stevens

112
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,380
are all letting it out.

113
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:50,660
Some of this music is critical and angry of the war effort and the military, but on the

114
00:07:50,660 --> 00:08:04,380
whole, the aesthetic trends more towards pleading for peace.

115
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,260
Creedence Clearwater Revival's Fortunate Son is, of course, emblematic of the audio

116
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:23,460
aesthetic when we think of music of the Vietnam War.

117
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:32,060
Even the succinctly titled What Is It Good For?

118
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:37,180
by Edwin Starr is pretty broad and less about America as a military machine, but again,

119
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:41,460
all of this reflects a general sense that we don't know why we're fighting in Vietnam.

120
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,660
And this is a problem to this day.

121
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:48,460
This is completely anecdotal, but both of the writers of this episode, whenever it got

122
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:55,140
to Vietnam time in our history classes, we spent maybe one day on it, and that was it

123
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,140
moving on.

124
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,140
Let's get to Watergate.

125
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:01,940
So with Vietnam, not only did you have a wildly unpopular draft, you had a war where most

126
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,740
American randos didn't really see that the cost was worth it.

127
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,020
There wasn't really a cause and effect for why we should be there in the first place.

128
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,700
Contrast this with 2001, where...

129
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,220
This is as close as we can get to the base of the World Trade Center.

130
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,780
You can see the firemen assembled here, the police officers, FBI agents, and you can see

131
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:26,260
the two towers, a huge explosion now raining debris.

132
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,620
9-11 was one of the most collectively traumatic events in U.S. history, and unlike combat

133
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,460
in Vietnam, it was witnessed in real time by virtually everyone in the country.

134
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:40,020
So rational or no, and it was not rational, there was a specific thing that was being

135
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,260
responded to before the war in Iraq, which was why it was so easy for Bush to get so

136
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,060
much of the public at large on board in the first place.

137
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:53,820
American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq,

138
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,700
to free its people, and to defend the world from grave danger.

139
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,700
So you know what that means.

140
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,140
We saw it in the 60s and 70s, and we're about to see it again.

141
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:06,580
It's not just our direct action and our protests that's going to change the world.

142
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,020
It's our music.

143
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,220
It's our art.

144
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,220
Let's go.

145
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,220
What do we got?

146
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:18,220
Cause we'll put a boot in your ass, it's the American way.

147
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,220
Hmm.

148
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,640
Probably should have seen that coming.

149
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,700
For the last few months of 2001 and early 2002, there was this strange sort of sincerity

150
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,860
that was, I don't know, kind of like the same vibe that was Kate McKinnon cosplaying as

151
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,660
Hillary Clinton singing Hallelujah on the first SNL after the 2016 election.

152
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:45,500
The first signs of trouble, the dust and the rubble, unspeakable loss.

153
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,740
There were songs like Paul McCartney's Freedom,

154
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:55,740
Freedom, we're talking about freedom.

155
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,780
Neil Young's Let's Roll, and hey, Bruce Springsteen made an entire album that was basically him

156
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,740
processing 9-11.

157
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:14,260
But processing the thing through art did not come without resistance to, you know, resistance.

158
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:23,060
The above example is called Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue, the Angry American,

159
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,740
and was released in the spring of 2002, and was much more emblematic of music of the era

160
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:36,540
than...

161
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:50,980
In the months following 9-11, we saw a lot of jingoism bleed into the arts.

162
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,220
A lot of kiss my American ass were number one sentiment hit the airwaves, most pervasively

163
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,900
in top 50 country music.

164
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:17,260
There were songs like Steve Curtis Chapman's Remember the Day, Daryl Worley's Have You Forgotten,

165
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:32,500
and of course Toby Keith's Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue, the Angry American.

166
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,580
And that was kind of new.

167
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:41,660
With Vietnam, there wasn't really like a pro-war movement in America, it was more like anti-anti-war,

168
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,780
like these hippies and Jane Fonda need to shut up and get off my lawn.

169
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,180
And even during World War II, which had a much more concerted and organized government

170
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,820
propaganda campaign, much of the music of the era was about like, you know, tee hee

171
00:12:53,820 --> 00:13:09,980
soldiers are cute, the music of that war wasn't really marked by a thirst for revenge.

172
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,620
So with this jingoism comes a sort of reluctance to make any kind of mainstream art about the

173
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,060
thing that is critical of the United States government in any capacity.

174
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,460
For example, Michael Moore criticizing Bush at the 2003 Oscars got him booed.

175
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:31,140
We live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons, whether

176
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:36,940
it's the fictition of duct tape or the fictitious of orange alerts.

177
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:42,700
Opposing the war in Iraq got him booed at the Oscars by these people.

178
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,100
So this was around the same time the Congress cafeteria stopped selling French fries and

179
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,380
started calling them Freedom Fries.

180
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,420
Because France did not want to join the invasion.

181
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,180
You know, not like our buddies the British over here, they were all about it.

182
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,660
Our friends the British, with us at every stupid turn.

183
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:05,260
The special relationship.

184
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,860
But these transgressions were all minor cultural blips compared to

185
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:20,100
So right before the Iraq invasion, Texas country trio the Dixie Chicks, who were at

186
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,980
the height of their popularity, were kicking off their 2003 world tour in London and opened

187
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:41,580
their concert with this.

188
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,420
And it all went to hell from there.

189
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,860
Thousands of phone calls flooded country music radio stations from Denver to Nashville, calls

190
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,620
demanding that the Dixie Chicks be removed from the station's playlists, their single

191
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:57,220
at the time, a cover of Fleetwood Mac's Landslide, dropped off the charts almost immediately,

192
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:04,740
the American Red Cross refused a promotional partnership with them, fans burned CDs, and

193
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,940
of course, death threats.

194
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:13,540
Lots and lots of death threats.

195
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,700
Lead singer Natalie Maines tried to apologize, but the damage was done, marking the Dixie

196
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,580
Chicks as a cautionary tale for people who tried to oppose the president.

197
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,620
And they didn't even sing about anything.

198
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,460
And although it turned the Dixie Chicks into the literal face of the resistance, and they

199
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,900
have released some new music fairly recently, their careers never really recovered to the

200
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,660
pre-Bush Bad Glory days.

201
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:41,080
But the short term result, at least as far as the next several years went, was that musicians

202
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,540
were extremely bearish about criticizing the status quo.

203
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,740
Which brings us to the audio aesthetic of the early 2000s.

204
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:54,940
Compare this to the late 1960s, where the sound is kind of gritty and raw and honest,

205
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,420
but also kind of tongue in cheek and clever.

206
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:11,780
If I had to succinctly describe the mood of pop music of that era, I'd say it was dumb.

207
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,700
It was big and dumb.

208
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,700
And loud.

209
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:24,100
Big and dumb and loud.

210
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,340
You didn't have these moody, thoughtful pop stars like you have now.

211
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:35,660
And the ones you did have were like, I don't know, Evanescence?

212
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,020
In the months and years that followed the Dixie Chicksening, pop stars kind of responded

213
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:48,780
to the thing by not really saying anything.

214
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:55,060
Madonna released her lead single from her album, American Life, in which she sings about

215
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,860
how hollow the American dream is because she's not satisfied with her life despite having

216
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:08,100
like agents and nannies and soy lattes.

217
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,020
All set to this backdrop.

218
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,500
Or rather, this was originally the music video.

219
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:36,500
It got scrapped because Madonna chickened out after the invasion went ahead.

220
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:44,100
So what was released was just her in front of a bad green screen and, you know, flags.

221
00:17:44,100 --> 00:18:01,580
Similarly we have Jewel's album track from her album, 0304, simply titled America.

222
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,460
Literally we live in a society.

223
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:09,020
So arguably the best we got out of 2003 was The Black Eyed Peas.

224
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:34,300
You know, it was more in the vein of protest songs that sort of vaguely plead for peace.

225
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,780
So one might say that this was the last gasp of the thoughtful peas.

226
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:46,580
You know, before the My Humps era.

227
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,660
But was that it?

228
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,300
Was everyone else too scared to try?

229
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,300
No.

230
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,300
Attempts were made.

231
00:18:54,300 --> 00:19:00,380
In 2004 there was an entire double album called Rock Against Bush.

232
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,940
Of course the albums consist mostly of artists that were either no longer relevant or you

233
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,500
had never heard of.

234
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,700
Plus that cover art is fantastic.

235
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,300
It's like, oh no, not the rock and roll.

236
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,380
And while they did have some songs written for the album, many were repurposed from earlier

237
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:25,980
albums, like this offspring song from 1992.

238
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,700
Perhaps one of the more fondly remembered efforts comes from System of a Down, with

239
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:40,620
their song BYOB, or Bring Your Own Bombs.

240
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:48,420
This is funnier in hindsight considering what the drummer currently feels compelled to share.

241
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,780
For something even more on the nose, A Perfect Circle released a single called Counting Bodies

242
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:59,780
Like Sheep To The Rhythm Of The War Drums, in 2004.

243
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:05,780
Ugh, subtle.

244
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,780
I don't get it.

245
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:12,780
I don't get what you're trying to tell me.

246
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:18,660
It's too vague.

247
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:23,220
Neil Young released an album called Living With War, and wrote a song straight up called

248
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:38,020
Let's Impeach The President.

249
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:49,620
There's a similar call in the Beastie Boys' 2004 song It Takes Time To Build.

250
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:59,180
From Pearl Jam, we got Bush Liger.

251
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:07,340
The song is also terrible.

252
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:19,540
Even Eminem got in on it.

253
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,980
And for all of Eminem's early controversies, I feel like everyone has forgotten the fact

254
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:32,980
that Eminem was investigated by the Secret Service for some of his lyrics.

255
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:40,260
Yeah, totally out of character for Eminem to fantasize doing murder in his raps.

256
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,380
A single with a video, Mosh, was released in 2004, before the election, as a plea to

257
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:51,500
vote Bush out of office.

258
00:21:51,500 --> 00:22:02,960
And we see stuff like this from Eminem now, but at the time, the music video was incredibly

259
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,560
serious and somber for him.

260
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,120
For comparison, this was released right after Just Lose It, Eminem's goofiest and worst

261
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,560
song ever?

262
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:16,360
Yeah, I might be going with ever.

263
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:22,760
So yeah, you might notice that this is mostly white dudes and alt-rock.

264
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,560
And white dudes doing alt-rock.

265
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,560
There was indie darling Nellie Mackay, who I think was meant to be a big pop star, sort

266
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:36,400
of anti-Nora Jones.

267
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,640
But then the label kind of pulled funding for the marketing of her album, probably because

268
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:48,400
of lines like this.

269
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,520
But these were not mainstream.

270
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,160
The aforementioned were not exactly top 40 singles.

271
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,280
With one notable exception.

272
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,160
Yep, it's the moment you've all been waiting for.

273
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:06,840
Yes, the definitive anti-war album of the Iraq War era comes from aging garage punk

274
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,360
guyliner burnouts Green Day.

275
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,840
At least that's how I felt at the time.

276
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:23,280
I say aging, but fuck's sake, Billy Joe Armstrong was 32.

277
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:33,680
So for a quick Green Day rundown, this was their breakout hit.

278
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:39,280
Their brand was like extremely young and not very smart, return of the bratty snot-nosed

279
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
punk.

280
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:45,040
They were a lot less miserable than grunge, more just bored and frustrated, lazy and aimless,

281
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:51,160
trapped in the dirt town with nothing to do, the perfect encapsulation of mid-90s ennui.

282
00:23:51,160 --> 00:24:05,240
And then came the huge hit, the sellout of all sellouts, punks writing a prom theme.

283
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,160
And it's funny to think that this was like actually a thing that people cared about in

284
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,160
the 90s.

285
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,760
But after that, they had kind of one middling album and then they fell off the radar for

286
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,760
several years.

287
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,060
And I'm including all of this because Green Day is just about the last band you would

288
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:25,420
ever expect to be like political, the voice of the resistance, especially in an atmosphere

289
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:33,380
where the most successful political music is.

290
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:38,380
There's a lot to unpack here, the tone, the aesthetic, an exploration of an entire generation

291
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:49,500
and country feeling duped, but you know, a happy one.

292
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,780
Like the album is a, it's a grenade, but you know, a heart-shaped one.

293
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:57,420
A lot of the tie-in art, marketing, music video used a lot of wartime imagery, but you

294
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,840
know, like a punk hot topic version.

295
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,300
The lead single, of course, was American Idiot.

296
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,180
And when you compare it to stuff like the System of a Down or Perfect Circle song, this

297
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,460
one kind of hits the combination of upbeat and angry.

298
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:17,540
That was just where we were in 2004, a time when the top 40 was aggressively apolitical.

299
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:22,160
The song succeeds in the same way that Credence did by being kind of tongue in cheek.

300
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:27,340
So you could make the argument that Green Day is our generation's Credence.

301
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:34,340
American Idiot is our fortunate son.

302
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:45,220
Less remembered, but more deliberate is the single Holiday.

303
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:52,020
And the chorus's refrain was according to Armstrong, intended to reflect the average

304
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,220
American's apathy on the issues of the day.

305
00:25:54,220 --> 00:26:02,100
And then there's the really big hit off that album.

306
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,820
Perhaps the obvious parallel to Time of Your Life, Wake Me Up When September Ends.

307
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,220
The more sincere counterpoint to American Idiot, and one of their biggest hits of all

308
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:15,100
time, it's basically a song about not wanting to live through the time you're in.

309
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:19,900
Wow, good thing we don't have that on we anymore.

310
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:24,420
If Holiday is anger at the apathy, September kind of leans into it.

311
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:28,740
Although the music video seems less anti-war than the previous ones, as it has a lot more

312
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,140
sympathy for the soldier.

313
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,660
Aesthetically, it's not that far from Toby Keith's American Soldier.

314
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:38,980
I don't do it for the glory, I just do it anyway.

315
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:52,900
American Idiot, and Green Day in general, had a musical, which did have a soldier goes

316
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,900
to war element.

317
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,100
I didn't see it.

318
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:59,900
It wasn't a complete failure, but it didn't really stick around, which might be indicative

319
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,860
of it not belonging in the time it was released, in the 2010s.

320
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,820
Like imagine a Creedence musical in the 1980s.

321
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,540
I never thought I'd end up doing Broadway.

322
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,940
Me neither, Billy Joe.

323
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:28,420
So I guess my hot take is, maybe Green Day is good, actually?

324
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:33,100
Even relatively popular artists like Eminem and System of a Down didn't really figure

325
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:38,340
out how to make any art that stayed in the popular lexicon the way Green Day did.

326
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,060
And part of it, like with the Black Eyed Peas, was that Green Day was palatable to the mainstream

327
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,900
because they don't mention Bush or Iraq by name.

328
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,100
But this isn't a bad thing.

329
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:50,540
They have this in common with a lot of protest music, from Irish music that made allusions

330
00:27:50,540 --> 00:28:11,340
to the British, all the way to the music of the Vietnam War.

331
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:16,580
Just the complete on-the-noseness of calling people sheep while Bush surfs through a river

332
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,800
of blood just feels preachy.

333
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,080
This was just not an era for political activism through art and music, leaving Green Day the

334
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:29,400
only act that managed to thread the needle and get a big hit out of it.

335
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,120
Before the 2004 election.

336
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,120
Speaking of which...

337
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
Thank you all for coming.

338
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,120
We had a long night.

339
00:28:36,120 --> 00:29:02,640
Voters turned out in record numbers and delivered an historic victory.

340
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,120
Bush gets re-elected.

341
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:10,120
And I guess the trend of anti-Bush, anti-war punk rock seemed just kind of like a waste

342
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,480
of time.

343
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,480
Like this is it.

344
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,480
This is where we live now.

345
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,280
You see less protest songs so much as generally being resigned to this being the way things

346
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
are.

347
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:30,680
Not a lot of fighting the establishment and the music.

348
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:41,720
Sheryl Crow gave us God Bless This Mess.

349
00:29:41,720 --> 00:30:04,360
R. Williams gives us a less optimistic interpretation of the new America with Empire.

350
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:15,240
Drake has a much more empathetic plea with Dear Mr. President.

351
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,320
There's gotta be a human man in there somewhere.

352
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:23,240
LL Cool J had a similar song called Mr. President which similarly made an empathetic plea inquiring

353
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:33,360
just what is going on in your head.

354
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:53,000
And Tori Amos had a short album track called Yo George.

355
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,560
But on the whole, especially after the election of 2004, most mainstream art couldn't seem

356
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,880
to bring itself to wholly or even partially condemn the establishment that the majority

357
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,400
of people by now pretty much agreed was bad.

358
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,800
To me, the sound and the attitude of that era is best embodied with music like John

359
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:25,200
Mayer's Waiting on the World to Change, a bad song that is bad and I hate it.

360
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,720
So here in 2006, one of the biggest hits of the year is effectively about riding out the

361
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:37,840
bullshit.

362
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,440
Somehow John Mayer invented the opposite of a revolutionary song.

363
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:51,480
And if it reminds me of anything, it reminds me of a song from Avenue Q called For Now.

364
00:31:51,480 --> 00:32:02,560
So songs like Waiting on the World to Change and For Now kind of back up this idea that

365
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,280
you know, we tried, we fought, it didn't work.

366
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,840
So right now we just have to wait it out.

367
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:15,440
We will survive this.

368
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,200
So where does that put us today?

369
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:26,920
How do we equivocate that era with this one?

370
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,680
Well the struggle is a lot more nebulous.

371
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:35,320
The issue isn't this war is unjust, the issue is more everything is unjust.

372
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:45,200
Much more common is the identity-based protest song like Lady Gaga's Born This Way or Taylor

373
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,220
Swift's You Need to Calm Down.

374
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:54,400
So it's not that protest music has gone away, but the thing that is being protested has

375
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,840
become extremely broad.

376
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,760
Protesting a war is a problem with a clearer solution, but today's big issues are harder

377
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,360
to solve than send the troops home or vote this guy out of office.

378
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:18,800
But from Taylor Swift all the way to celebrities singing Imagine, we can say this.

379
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:23,200
At least there's no trend of songs proudly proclaiming their disengagement, or reassuring

380
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,200
themselves that it'll be fine, we'll live through this, because I think that most people

381
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,940
finally get that no, not everyone will live through this actually, and there is no guarantee

382
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,940
that this is for now.

383
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:43,940
Don't stress, relax, let life roll off your backs, except for death and paying taxes.

384
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:49,940
Everything in life is only for now.

385
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:55,540
So to bring this thing full circle, in December of 2016, former Dresden Dolls frontwoman and

386
00:33:55,540 --> 00:34:04,140
musician, Amanda Palmer, wrote the following.

387
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:08,660
Being an optimist, there is a part of me, especially having studied Weimar Germany extensively,

388
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,860
I'm like, this is our moment.

389
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,580
Donald Trump is going to make punk rock great again.

390
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:17,420
We're all going to crawl down staircases into basements and speakeasies and make amazing

391
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,740
satirically political art.

392
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,900
Similarly, author Joyce Carol Oates wrote,

393
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,860
Artists thrive on turbulence and estrangement from establishment slash authority.

394
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,780
So Trump presidency would not be a total disaster.

395
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,780
For some.

396
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,780
For some?

397
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,420
Well that's a caveat.

398
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:38,020
So here's the thing that happens in times of great cultural stress, there's this sort

399
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:44,820
of impulse to try to give meaning to the badness and the suffering, like if you put one suffering

400
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,780
unit in, you get one art unit out.

401
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:54,140
And I understand that impulse, you need to give meaning to the badness, but I think it's

402
00:34:54,140 --> 00:35:00,100
kind of misguided to give meaning to suffering by saying, hey, at least we'll get great art

403
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,100
out of it.

404
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:05,620
Amanda Palmer's comment about Weimar Germany rings particularly tone deaf in this context.

405
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:09,160
Like yeah, hey, the Holocaust sucked, but we got the producers, didn't we?

406
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,620
And this tends to put stress on people that's also kind of unnecessary, like I'm at home,

407
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:20,060
I haven't gone outside in months, there's a pandemic, and why have I not written the

408
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,240
Great American Novel?

409
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,900
Why have I not found a way to turn my suffering into art?

410
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:29,060
Which is like perfectly encapsulated in this Onion headline, man not sure why he thought

411
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:33,660
most psychologically taxing situation of his life would be the thing to make him productive.

412
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:38,940
But moreover, art and music, you know, it's great and all, but it's not a substitute for

413
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,900
direct action.

414
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,620
And there's no better evidence for that than these last couple weeks.

415
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:50,380
As he slides into position and goes straight into another really up song.

416
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,460
And I hope that we're kind of turning a corner on this mindset.

417
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,520
Because while yes, a lot of incredible meaningful art has come out of suffering, we should not

418
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,440
think of suffering as a prerequisite for interesting and meaningful art.

419
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,660
And we certainly shouldn't try to put a silver lining to people's suffering because consumers

420
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,340
might get a good art out of it.

421
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,620
Again, the pre-order link for my book is in the description.

422
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:21,900
It has nothing to do with this topic, except for being set in the 2000s.

423
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,380
Well, I guess it does have like some protesting in it.

424
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,780
And George W. Bush is an extremely minor character.

425
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,180
To be clear, this is the book about aliens, yes.

426
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,900
So again, pre-order link in the description.

427
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:37,980
And if you want a signed copy, by which I mean like, I sign this and then they stick

428
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,020
it in like a page in the book.

429
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,860
The instructions for that are also in the description.

430
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,460
You have to do a whole thing that involves screenshots.

431
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,660
Thank you for watching.

432
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:53,060
