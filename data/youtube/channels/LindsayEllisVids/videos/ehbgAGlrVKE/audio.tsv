0	6940	It was just over 90 minutes beyond President Bush's deadline for Saddam Hussein to leave
6940	13840	Iraq that U.S. warships and planes launched the opening salvo of Operation Iraqi Freedom.
13840	16400	The year is 2003.
16400	18120	America prepares for war.
18120	21560	President George W. Bush has declared that Iraq is building weapons of mass destruction
21560	26400	with which to attack America, and that the only possible response is a preemptive invasion.
26400	30240	The administration's case is transparently flimsy and dishonest, both on the evidence
30240	32080	and the ethical justification.
32080	36160	And though the country is still reeling in shock from 9-11, the anti-war movement manages
36160	38320	to organize massive protests.
38320	43960	Roughly 32 million people participate worldwide over the course of four months, to no avail.
43960	47720	America invades against all good judgment or reason, a tragic boondoggle that would
47720	52120	eventually prove everyone's worst fears completely true and spark a new dark era of
52120	53600	global politics.
53600	57560	There is despair among the anti-war left, but they did have one silver lining.
57560	62240	Not much of a silver lining, in light of historic crime unfolding, but a silver lining nonetheless.
62240	66240	A silver lining we heard many, many people clinging to in those awful days.
66240	68240	Extremists are in the White House!
68240	70240	Extremists are in the Pentagon!
74240	78240	At least we're going to get a lot of great music.
78880	80880	Hm.
82880	83880	Hello?
83880	84880	Yeah, hi.
84880	85880	I was just listening to the video.
85880	89880	Did you literally just steal the entire intro from my Madonna Train Records video?
89880	91880	Like, verbatim?
91880	92880	No!
92880	96880	Well, yes, but you totally ripped off the format for the introduction to my Rent video.
97880	99880	Oh yeah, I guess I kinda did.
99880	100880	Okay.
100880	101880	Um.
101880	103880	Does that make this a collaboration?
103880	106880	I, uh, I thought people didn't do video collabs anymore.
107520	110520	No, see, it turns out that, like, most YouTubers never stopped doing that.
110520	113520	We just did because, you know, you never know who's going to have a Twitter meltdown, and
113520	116520	you don't want to have to be doing, like, apologies by proxy.
116520	119520	Oh yeah, yeah, that is why we stopped.
119520	121520	And no other reason.
121520	123520	No other reason.
125520	126520	So anyway.
126520	127520	Well, it's been a minute, hasn't it?
127520	129520	So I have this book coming out next month.
129520	131520	Pre-order link in the description.
132160	137160	And one of the more common questions I get, besides, what the hell is wrong with you,
137160	143960	is, why did you decide to set it in the 2000s instead of, you know, the nebulous present
143960	144960	now?
144960	145960	You know, whatever this is.
145960	150480	And to that I say, you know, besides the fact that nothing makes sense in our current hell
150480	153240	world, it makes sense in context.
153240	155320	It was a very different time.
155320	159680	So the idea for this episode came about while I was actually writing it, and I was making
159680	163240	all these playlists for, you know, mood.
163240	165640	There's also a link to my main playlist in the description.
165640	171040	It's full of mid-2000s cheese, if that's what you need to get you through this time.
171040	176000	And listening to that sort of thing made me think a lot about, you know, the resistance
176000	178120	music of that era.
178120	179320	Or lack thereof.
179320	183920	So while I had been working on this for a while, I was going to put it out later, you
183920	186400	know, to be more of like a tie-in release thing.
186400	191380	But then the topic of protests had to go and get all topical, so this got bumped up.
191380	196040	So obviously the topic of music and music history isn't exactly my wheelhouse, so I
196040	200840	wrote this with some consulting from our good friend Todd in the Shadows.
200840	201840	Thank you for the plug.
201840	207120	And if you like books, check out the new novel, Axiom's End, by my close personal friend,
207120	208600	Lindsay Ellis.
208600	211400	Gee, thanks.
211400	216600	So before we get into the era at hand, first let's take a quick look at the history of
216600	222000	protest music.
222000	225240	Protest music can be found in pretty much every culture throughout the world, but you're
225240	229920	much more likely to find it in cultures that are, you know, like, oppressed and colonized.
229920	235240	Ireland, for instance, has a very long, proud history of protest songs, from Irish-language
235240	241240	songs like Orosheidevá Hávaile to more recent ones like Kevin Berry.
241240	251160	And it ranges all over the world, to the anti-apartheid music movement spearheaded
251160	255280	by black South African musicians like Hugh Masekela, all the way to broader genres of
255280	275920	music like British punk rock, a la The Clash, all the way to Yankee Goddamn Doodle Dandy.
275920	288960	Yeah, so early American protest music was like basically taking British diss tracks
288960	303600	and being like, yeah, our hats are stupid, we're proud of that.
303600	308240	Now protest songs have been written and attached to movements of all sorts, from anti-racism
308240	324560	to feminism to gay rights to literally nothing.
324560	326360	You know, a revolution.
326360	327760	Prayin' for it.
327760	328760	Every day.
328760	334520	Stop singing this at karaoke.
334520	338480	But the common thread between most protest songs is that they, for obvious reasons, tend
338480	342000	to come about in times of mass disenfranchisement or injustice.
342000	346120	So the assumption that, hey, shit might be bad and we're all in agreement about that,
346120	351280	therefore it's time for some great art that captures the zeitgeist of the now is not unfounded.
351280	362840	But what is the basis of this assumption in America specifically?
362840	366600	When people think of American protest music in pop songs, they're probably thinking
366600	371840	of the music of the late 1960s and early 1970s, specifically music surrounding the Vietnam
371840	372840	War.
372840	376920	But what was it about this war that was different from that which became before and after?
376920	380200	Well, the roots of the Vietnam War stretch back into the 19th century, and it was one
380200	384120	of those conflicts that even now people have a hard time explaining what it was really
384120	391600	about other than, like, you know, the vague proxy war, something-something communism.
391600	396520	And that's not, you know, completely wrong, but like most war-related topics, taking a
396520	399840	complex issue and simplifying it is not easy.
399840	404320	So to keep it simple, we have this really long, nebulous war.
404320	406340	Nobody really knows what we're fighting for.
406340	411900	It results in the deaths of millions of Vietnamese people by some counts, and 58,000 U.S. troops.
411900	415620	I think all the decent people in this country have decided this war is an absurdity and
415620	417820	immoral, and it's time to bring it to a halt.
417820	426820	We spend $322,000 for each enemy we kill in Vietnam.
426820	432060	Well, all I can say is I'm not as patriotic as I used to be.
432060	435380	As you can imagine, this sits very poorly with people all over the world, including
435420	439860	people inside the United States, who genuinely do not understand why this is a conflict that
439860	442580	should involve the U.S. military at all.
442580	444380	And that brings us to...
444380	449380	A-one, two, a-one, two, three, four!
449380	454860	There was a wide array of protest music that came out of this war.
454860	459660	Bands like Creedence Clearwater Revival, artists like Donovan, John Lennon, and Cat Stevens
459660	461380	are all letting it out.
462380	470660	Some of this music is critical and angry of the war effort and the military, but on the
470660	484380	whole, the aesthetic trends more towards pleading for peace.
484380	488260	Creedence Clearwater Revival's Fortunate Son is, of course, emblematic of the audio
488260	503460	aesthetic when we think of music of the Vietnam War.
503460	512060	Even the succinctly titled What Is It Good For?
512060	517180	by Edwin Starr is pretty broad and less about America as a military machine, but again,
517180	521460	all of this reflects a general sense that we don't know why we're fighting in Vietnam.
521460	523660	And this is a problem to this day.
523660	528460	This is completely anecdotal, but both of the writers of this episode, whenever it got
528460	535140	to Vietnam time in our history classes, we spent maybe one day on it, and that was it
535140	536140	moving on.
536140	537140	Let's get to Watergate.
537140	541940	So with Vietnam, not only did you have a wildly unpopular draft, you had a war where most
541940	546740	American randos didn't really see that the cost was worth it.
546740	551020	There wasn't really a cause and effect for why we should be there in the first place.
551020	554700	Contrast this with 2001, where...
554700	557220	This is as close as we can get to the base of the World Trade Center.
557220	561780	You can see the firemen assembled here, the police officers, FBI agents, and you can see
561780	566260	the two towers, a huge explosion now raining debris.
566260	570620	9-11 was one of the most collectively traumatic events in U.S. history, and unlike combat
570620	575460	in Vietnam, it was witnessed in real time by virtually everyone in the country.
575460	580020	So rational or no, and it was not rational, there was a specific thing that was being
580020	584260	responded to before the war in Iraq, which was why it was so easy for Bush to get so
584260	588060	much of the public at large on board in the first place.
588060	593820	American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq,
593820	597700	to free its people, and to defend the world from grave danger.
597700	598700	So you know what that means.
598700	602140	We saw it in the 60s and 70s, and we're about to see it again.
602140	606580	It's not just our direct action and our protests that's going to change the world.
606580	608020	It's our music.
608020	610220	It's our art.
610220	611220	Let's go.
611220	612220	What do we got?
612220	618220	Cause we'll put a boot in your ass, it's the American way.
618220	619220	Hmm.
619220	623640	Probably should have seen that coming.
623640	628700	For the last few months of 2001 and early 2002, there was this strange sort of sincerity
628900	632860	that was, I don't know, kind of like the same vibe that was Kate McKinnon cosplaying as
632860	637660	Hillary Clinton singing Hallelujah on the first SNL after the 2016 election.
637660	645500	The first signs of trouble, the dust and the rubble, unspeakable loss.
645500	647740	There were songs like Paul McCartney's Freedom,
647740	655740	Freedom, we're talking about freedom.
655780	660780	Neil Young's Let's Roll, and hey, Bruce Springsteen made an entire album that was basically him
660780	662740	processing 9-11.
662740	674260	But processing the thing through art did not come without resistance to, you know, resistance.
674260	683060	The above example is called Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue, the Angry American,
683100	687740	and was released in the spring of 2002, and was much more emblematic of music of the era
687740	696540	than...
696540	710980	In the months following 9-11, we saw a lot of jingoism bleed into the arts.
710980	715220	A lot of kiss my American ass were number one sentiment hit the airwaves, most pervasively
715220	716900	in top 50 country music.
716900	737260	There were songs like Steve Curtis Chapman's Remember the Day, Daryl Worley's Have You Forgotten,
737260	752500	and of course Toby Keith's Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue, the Angry American.
752500	754580	And that was kind of new.
754580	761660	With Vietnam, there wasn't really like a pro-war movement in America, it was more like anti-anti-war,
761660	765780	like these hippies and Jane Fonda need to shut up and get off my lawn.
765780	769180	And even during World War II, which had a much more concerted and organized government
769180	773820	propaganda campaign, much of the music of the era was about like, you know, tee hee
773820	789980	soldiers are cute, the music of that war wasn't really marked by a thirst for revenge.
789980	794620	So with this jingoism comes a sort of reluctance to make any kind of mainstream art about the
794620	798060	thing that is critical of the United States government in any capacity.
798060	802460	For example, Michael Moore criticizing Bush at the 2003 Oscars got him booed.
802460	811140	We live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons, whether
811140	816940	it's the fictition of duct tape or the fictitious of orange alerts.
816940	822700	Opposing the war in Iraq got him booed at the Oscars by these people.
822700	826100	So this was around the same time the Congress cafeteria stopped selling French fries and
826100	828380	started calling them Freedom Fries.
828380	831420	Because France did not want to join the invasion.
831420	835180	You know, not like our buddies the British over here, they were all about it.
835180	838660	Our friends the British, with us at every stupid turn.
838660	845260	The special relationship.
845260	848860	But these transgressions were all minor cultural blips compared to
848860	860100	So right before the Iraq invasion, Texas country trio the Dixie Chicks, who were at
860100	864980	the height of their popularity, were kicking off their 2003 world tour in London and opened
864980	881580	their concert with this.
881580	883420	And it all went to hell from there.
883420	887860	Thousands of phone calls flooded country music radio stations from Denver to Nashville, calls
887860	891620	demanding that the Dixie Chicks be removed from the station's playlists, their single
891620	897220	at the time, a cover of Fleetwood Mac's Landslide, dropped off the charts almost immediately,
897220	904740	the American Red Cross refused a promotional partnership with them, fans burned CDs, and
904740	906940	of course, death threats.
906940	913540	Lots and lots of death threats.
913540	917700	Lead singer Natalie Maines tried to apologize, but the damage was done, marking the Dixie
917700	921580	Chicks as a cautionary tale for people who tried to oppose the president.
921580	924620	And they didn't even sing about anything.
924620	928460	And although it turned the Dixie Chicks into the literal face of the resistance, and they
928460	932900	have released some new music fairly recently, their careers never really recovered to the
932900	935660	pre-Bush Bad Glory days.
935660	941080	But the short term result, at least as far as the next several years went, was that musicians
941080	945540	were extremely bearish about criticizing the status quo.
945540	948740	Which brings us to the audio aesthetic of the early 2000s.
948740	954940	Compare this to the late 1960s, where the sound is kind of gritty and raw and honest,
954940	957420	but also kind of tongue in cheek and clever.
957420	971780	If I had to succinctly describe the mood of pop music of that era, I'd say it was dumb.
971780	973700	It was big and dumb.
973700	974700	And loud.
974700	984100	Big and dumb and loud.
984100	987340	You didn't have these moody, thoughtful pop stars like you have now.
987340	995660	And the ones you did have were like, I don't know, Evanescence?
995660	1000020	In the months and years that followed the Dixie Chicksening, pop stars kind of responded
1000020	1008780	to the thing by not really saying anything.
1008780	1015060	Madonna released her lead single from her album, American Life, in which she sings about
1015060	1019860	how hollow the American dream is because she's not satisfied with her life despite having
1019860	1028100	like agents and nannies and soy lattes.
1028100	1030020	All set to this backdrop.
1030020	1032500	Or rather, this was originally the music video.
1032500	1056500	It got scrapped because Madonna chickened out after the invasion went ahead.
1056500	1064100	So what was released was just her in front of a bad green screen and, you know, flags.
1064100	1081580	Similarly we have Jewel's album track from her album, 0304, simply titled America.
1081580	1084460	Literally we live in a society.
1084460	1089020	So arguably the best we got out of 2003 was The Black Eyed Peas.
1089020	1114300	You know, it was more in the vein of protest songs that sort of vaguely plead for peace.
1114300	1118780	So one might say that this was the last gasp of the thoughtful peas.
1118780	1126580	You know, before the My Humps era.
1126580	1127660	But was that it?
1127660	1130300	Was everyone else too scared to try?
1130300	1131300	No.
1131300	1134300	Attempts were made.
1134300	1140380	In 2004 there was an entire double album called Rock Against Bush.
1140380	1144940	Of course the albums consist mostly of artists that were either no longer relevant or you
1144940	1146500	had never heard of.
1146500	1148700	Plus that cover art is fantastic.
1148700	1152300	It's like, oh no, not the rock and roll.
1152300	1156380	And while they did have some songs written for the album, many were repurposed from earlier
1156380	1165980	albums, like this offspring song from 1992.
1165980	1169700	Perhaps one of the more fondly remembered efforts comes from System of a Down, with
1169700	1180620	their song BYOB, or Bring Your Own Bombs.
1180620	1188420	This is funnier in hindsight considering what the drummer currently feels compelled to share.
1188420	1192780	For something even more on the nose, A Perfect Circle released a single called Counting Bodies
1192780	1199780	Like Sheep To The Rhythm Of The War Drums, in 2004.
1199780	1205780	Ugh, subtle.
1205780	1206780	I don't get it.
1206780	1212780	I don't get what you're trying to tell me.
1212780	1218660	It's too vague.
1218660	1223220	Neil Young released an album called Living With War, and wrote a song straight up called
1223220	1238020	Let's Impeach The President.
1238020	1249620	There's a similar call in the Beastie Boys' 2004 song It Takes Time To Build.
1249620	1259180	From Pearl Jam, we got Bush Liger.
1259180	1267340	The song is also terrible.
1267340	1279540	Even Eminem got in on it.
1279540	1283980	And for all of Eminem's early controversies, I feel like everyone has forgotten the fact
1283980	1292980	that Eminem was investigated by the Secret Service for some of his lyrics.
1293980	1300260	Yeah, totally out of character for Eminem to fantasize doing murder in his raps.
1300260	1304380	A single with a video, Mosh, was released in 2004, before the election, as a plea to
1304380	1311500	vote Bush out of office.
1311500	1322960	And we see stuff like this from Eminem now, but at the time, the music video was incredibly
1322960	1324560	serious and somber for him.
1324560	1329120	For comparison, this was released right after Just Lose It, Eminem's goofiest and worst
1329120	1331560	song ever?
1331560	1336360	Yeah, I might be going with ever.
1336360	1342760	So yeah, you might notice that this is mostly white dudes and alt-rock.
1342760	1344560	And white dudes doing alt-rock.
1344560	1348560	There was indie darling Nellie Mackay, who I think was meant to be a big pop star, sort
1348560	1356400	of anti-Nora Jones.
1356400	1361640	But then the label kind of pulled funding for the marketing of her album, probably because
1361640	1368400	of lines like this.
1368400	1369520	But these were not mainstream.
1369520	1373160	The aforementioned were not exactly top 40 singles.
1373160	1375280	With one notable exception.
1375280	1380160	Yep, it's the moment you've all been waiting for.
1380160	1386840	Yes, the definitive anti-war album of the Iraq War era comes from aging garage punk
1386840	1392360	guyliner burnouts Green Day.
1392360	1393840	At least that's how I felt at the time.
1393840	1403280	I say aging, but fuck's sake, Billy Joe Armstrong was 32.
1403280	1413680	So for a quick Green Day rundown, this was their breakout hit.
1413680	1419280	Their brand was like extremely young and not very smart, return of the bratty snot-nosed
1419280	1420280	punk.
1420280	1425040	They were a lot less miserable than grunge, more just bored and frustrated, lazy and aimless,
1425040	1431160	trapped in the dirt town with nothing to do, the perfect encapsulation of mid-90s ennui.
1431160	1445240	And then came the huge hit, the sellout of all sellouts, punks writing a prom theme.
1445240	1448160	And it's funny to think that this was like actually a thing that people cared about in
1448160	1449160	the 90s.
1449160	1452760	But after that, they had kind of one middling album and then they fell off the radar for
1452760	1453760	several years.
1453760	1459060	And I'm including all of this because Green Day is just about the last band you would
1459060	1465420	ever expect to be like political, the voice of the resistance, especially in an atmosphere
1465420	1473380	where the most successful political music is.
1473380	1478380	There's a lot to unpack here, the tone, the aesthetic, an exploration of an entire generation
1478380	1489500	and country feeling duped, but you know, a happy one.
1489500	1492780	Like the album is a, it's a grenade, but you know, a heart-shaped one.
1492780	1497420	A lot of the tie-in art, marketing, music video used a lot of wartime imagery, but you
1497420	1499840	know, like a punk hot topic version.
1499840	1502300	The lead single, of course, was American Idiot.
1502300	1506180	And when you compare it to stuff like the System of a Down or Perfect Circle song, this
1506180	1509460	one kind of hits the combination of upbeat and angry.
1509460	1517540	That was just where we were in 2004, a time when the top 40 was aggressively apolitical.
1517540	1522160	The song succeeds in the same way that Credence did by being kind of tongue in cheek.
1522160	1527340	So you could make the argument that Green Day is our generation's Credence.
1527340	1534340	American Idiot is our fortunate son.
1534340	1545220	Less remembered, but more deliberate is the single Holiday.
1545220	1552020	And the chorus's refrain was according to Armstrong, intended to reflect the average
1552020	1554220	American's apathy on the issues of the day.
1554220	1562100	And then there's the really big hit off that album.
1562100	1566820	Perhaps the obvious parallel to Time of Your Life, Wake Me Up When September Ends.
1566820	1570220	The more sincere counterpoint to American Idiot, and one of their biggest hits of all
1570220	1575100	time, it's basically a song about not wanting to live through the time you're in.
1575100	1579900	Wow, good thing we don't have that on we anymore.
1579900	1584420	If Holiday is anger at the apathy, September kind of leans into it.
1584420	1588740	Although the music video seems less anti-war than the previous ones, as it has a lot more
1588740	1590140	sympathy for the soldier.
1590180	1593660	Aesthetically, it's not that far from Toby Keith's American Soldier.
1593660	1598980	I don't do it for the glory, I just do it anyway.
1598980	1612900	American Idiot, and Green Day in general, had a musical, which did have a soldier goes
1612900	1613900	to war element.
1613900	1615100	I didn't see it.
1615100	1619900	It wasn't a complete failure, but it didn't really stick around, which might be indicative
1619940	1623860	of it not belonging in the time it was released, in the 2010s.
1623860	1626820	Like imagine a Creedence musical in the 1980s.
1626820	1629540	I never thought I'd end up doing Broadway.
1629540	1630940	Me neither, Billy Joe.
1630940	1648420	So I guess my hot take is, maybe Green Day is good, actually?
1648460	1653100	Even relatively popular artists like Eminem and System of a Down didn't really figure
1653100	1658340	out how to make any art that stayed in the popular lexicon the way Green Day did.
1658340	1662060	And part of it, like with the Black Eyed Peas, was that Green Day was palatable to the mainstream
1662060	1664900	because they don't mention Bush or Iraq by name.
1664900	1666100	But this isn't a bad thing.
1666100	1670540	They have this in common with a lot of protest music, from Irish music that made allusions
1670540	1691340	to the British, all the way to the music of the Vietnam War.
1691340	1696580	Just the complete on-the-noseness of calling people sheep while Bush surfs through a river
1696580	1698800	of blood just feels preachy.
1698800	1703080	This was just not an era for political activism through art and music, leaving Green Day the
1703080	1709400	only act that managed to thread the needle and get a big hit out of it.
1709400	1713120	Before the 2004 election.
1713120	1714120	Speaking of which...
1714120	1715120	Thank you all for coming.
1715120	1716120	We had a long night.
1716120	1742640	Voters turned out in record numbers and delivered an historic victory.
1742640	1744120	Bush gets re-elected.
1744120	1750120	And I guess the trend of anti-Bush, anti-war punk rock seemed just kind of like a waste
1750120	1753480	of time.
1753480	1754480	Like this is it.
1754480	1755480	This is where we live now.
1755480	1760280	You see less protest songs so much as generally being resigned to this being the way things
1760280	1761280	are.
1761280	1770680	Not a lot of fighting the establishment and the music.
1770720	1781720	Sheryl Crow gave us God Bless This Mess.
1781720	1804360	R. Williams gives us a less optimistic interpretation of the new America with Empire.
1804400	1815240	Drake has a much more empathetic plea with Dear Mr. President.
1815240	1817320	There's gotta be a human man in there somewhere.
1817320	1823240	LL Cool J had a similar song called Mr. President which similarly made an empathetic plea inquiring
1823240	1833360	just what is going on in your head.
1833360	1853000	And Tori Amos had a short album track called Yo George.
1853000	1857560	But on the whole, especially after the election of 2004, most mainstream art couldn't seem
1857560	1861880	to bring itself to wholly or even partially condemn the establishment that the majority
1861880	1866400	of people by now pretty much agreed was bad.
1866400	1870800	To me, the sound and the attitude of that era is best embodied with music like John
1870800	1885200	Mayer's Waiting on the World to Change, a bad song that is bad and I hate it.
1885200	1889720	So here in 2006, one of the biggest hits of the year is effectively about riding out the
1889720	1897840	bullshit.
1897840	1901440	Somehow John Mayer invented the opposite of a revolutionary song.
1901440	1911480	And if it reminds me of anything, it reminds me of a song from Avenue Q called For Now.
1911480	1922560	So songs like Waiting on the World to Change and For Now kind of back up this idea that
1922560	1926280	you know, we tried, we fought, it didn't work.
1926280	1928840	So right now we just have to wait it out.
1928840	1935440	We will survive this.
1935440	1937200	So where does that put us today?
1937200	1946920	How do we equivocate that era with this one?
1946920	1949680	Well the struggle is a lot more nebulous.
1949680	1955320	The issue isn't this war is unjust, the issue is more everything is unjust.
1955320	1965200	Much more common is the identity-based protest song like Lady Gaga's Born This Way or Taylor
1965200	1970220	Swift's You Need to Calm Down.
1970220	1974400	So it's not that protest music has gone away, but the thing that is being protested has
1974400	1976840	become extremely broad.
1976840	1980760	Protesting a war is a problem with a clearer solution, but today's big issues are harder
1980760	1985360	to solve than send the troops home or vote this guy out of office.
1985360	1998800	But from Taylor Swift all the way to celebrities singing Imagine, we can say this.
1998800	2003200	At least there's no trend of songs proudly proclaiming their disengagement, or reassuring
2003200	2008200	themselves that it'll be fine, we'll live through this, because I think that most people
2008200	2013940	finally get that no, not everyone will live through this actually, and there is no guarantee
2013940	2015940	that this is for now.
2015940	2023940	Don't stress, relax, let life roll off your backs, except for death and paying taxes.
2023940	2029940	Everything in life is only for now.
2029940	2035540	So to bring this thing full circle, in December of 2016, former Dresden Dolls frontwoman and
2035540	2044140	musician, Amanda Palmer, wrote the following.
2044140	2048660	Being an optimist, there is a part of me, especially having studied Weimar Germany extensively,
2048660	2050860	I'm like, this is our moment.
2050860	2053580	Donald Trump is going to make punk rock great again.
2053580	2057420	We're all going to crawl down staircases into basements and speakeasies and make amazing
2057420	2059740	satirically political art.
2059740	2062900	Similarly, author Joyce Carol Oates wrote,
2062900	2066860	Artists thrive on turbulence and estrangement from establishment slash authority.
2066860	2069780	So Trump presidency would not be a total disaster.
2069780	2070780	For some.
2070780	2071780	For some?
2071780	2073420	Well that's a caveat.
2073420	2078020	So here's the thing that happens in times of great cultural stress, there's this sort
2078020	2084820	of impulse to try to give meaning to the badness and the suffering, like if you put one suffering
2084820	2088780	unit in, you get one art unit out.
2088780	2094140	And I understand that impulse, you need to give meaning to the badness, but I think it's
2094140	2100100	kind of misguided to give meaning to suffering by saying, hey, at least we'll get great art
2100100	2101100	out of it.
2101100	2105620	Amanda Palmer's comment about Weimar Germany rings particularly tone deaf in this context.
2105620	2109160	Like yeah, hey, the Holocaust sucked, but we got the producers, didn't we?
2109160	2114620	And this tends to put stress on people that's also kind of unnecessary, like I'm at home,
2114620	2120060	I haven't gone outside in months, there's a pandemic, and why have I not written the
2120060	2121240	Great American Novel?
2121240	2124900	Why have I not found a way to turn my suffering into art?
2124900	2129060	Which is like perfectly encapsulated in this Onion headline, man not sure why he thought
2129060	2133660	most psychologically taxing situation of his life would be the thing to make him productive.
2133660	2138940	But moreover, art and music, you know, it's great and all, but it's not a substitute for
2138940	2141900	direct action.
2141900	2144620	And there's no better evidence for that than these last couple weeks.
2144620	2150380	As he slides into position and goes straight into another really up song.
2150380	2153460	And I hope that we're kind of turning a corner on this mindset.
2153460	2157520	Because while yes, a lot of incredible meaningful art has come out of suffering, we should not
2157520	2161440	think of suffering as a prerequisite for interesting and meaningful art.
2161440	2165660	And we certainly shouldn't try to put a silver lining to people's suffering because consumers
2165660	2167340	might get a good art out of it.
2172900	2175620	Again, the pre-order link for my book is in the description.
2175620	2181900	It has nothing to do with this topic, except for being set in the 2000s.
2181900	2185380	Well, I guess it does have like some protesting in it.
2185380	2188780	And George W. Bush is an extremely minor character.
2188780	2191180	To be clear, this is the book about aliens, yes.
2191180	2192900	So again, pre-order link in the description.
2192900	2197980	And if you want a signed copy, by which I mean like, I sign this and then they stick
2197980	2201020	it in like a page in the book.
2201020	2203860	The instructions for that are also in the description.
2203860	2206460	You have to do a whole thing that involves screenshots.
2206460	2207660	Thank you for watching.
2207660	2213060	And the video I was originally going to put up right now will be out...
