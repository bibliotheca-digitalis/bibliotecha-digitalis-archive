00:00.000 --> 00:06.940
It was just over 90 minutes beyond President Bush's deadline for Saddam Hussein to leave

00:06.940 --> 00:13.840
Iraq that U.S. warships and planes launched the opening salvo of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

00:13.840 --> 00:16.400
The year is 2003.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.120
America prepares for war.

00:18.120 --> 00:21.560
President George W. Bush has declared that Iraq is building weapons of mass destruction

00:21.560 --> 00:26.400
with which to attack America, and that the only possible response is a preemptive invasion.

00:26.400 --> 00:30.240
The administration's case is transparently flimsy and dishonest, both on the evidence

00:30.240 --> 00:32.080
and the ethical justification.

00:32.080 --> 00:36.160
And though the country is still reeling in shock from 9-11, the anti-war movement manages

00:36.160 --> 00:38.320
to organize massive protests.

00:38.320 --> 00:43.960
Roughly 32 million people participate worldwide over the course of four months, to no avail.

00:43.960 --> 00:47.720
America invades against all good judgment or reason, a tragic boondoggle that would

00:47.720 --> 00:52.120
eventually prove everyone's worst fears completely true and spark a new dark era of

00:52.120 --> 00:53.600
global politics.

00:53.600 --> 00:57.560
There is despair among the anti-war left, but they did have one silver lining.

00:57.560 --> 01:02.240
Not much of a silver lining, in light of historic crime unfolding, but a silver lining nonetheless.

01:02.240 --> 01:06.240
A silver lining we heard many, many people clinging to in those awful days.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.240
Extremists are in the White House!

01:08.240 --> 01:10.240
Extremists are in the Pentagon!

01:14.240 --> 01:18.240
At least we're going to get a lot of great music.

01:18.880 --> 01:20.880
Hm.

01:22.880 --> 01:23.880
Hello?

01:23.880 --> 01:24.880
Yeah, hi.

01:24.880 --> 01:25.880
I was just listening to the video.

01:25.880 --> 01:29.880
Did you literally just steal the entire intro from my Madonna Train Records video?

01:29.880 --> 01:31.880
Like, verbatim?

01:31.880 --> 01:32.880
No!

01:32.880 --> 01:36.880
Well, yes, but you totally ripped off the format for the introduction to my Rent video.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.880
Oh yeah, I guess I kinda did.

01:39.880 --> 01:40.880
Okay.

01:40.880 --> 01:41.880
Um.

01:41.880 --> 01:43.880
Does that make this a collaboration?

01:43.880 --> 01:46.880
I, uh, I thought people didn't do video collabs anymore.

01:47.520 --> 01:50.520
No, see, it turns out that, like, most YouTubers never stopped doing that.

01:50.520 --> 01:53.520
We just did because, you know, you never know who's going to have a Twitter meltdown, and

01:53.520 --> 01:56.520
you don't want to have to be doing, like, apologies by proxy.

01:56.520 --> 01:59.520
Oh yeah, yeah, that is why we stopped.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.520
And no other reason.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.520
No other reason.

02:05.520 --> 02:06.520
So anyway.

02:06.520 --> 02:07.520
Well, it's been a minute, hasn't it?

02:07.520 --> 02:09.520
So I have this book coming out next month.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.520
Pre-order link in the description.

02:12.160 --> 02:17.160
And one of the more common questions I get, besides, what the hell is wrong with you,

02:17.160 --> 02:23.960
is, why did you decide to set it in the 2000s instead of, you know, the nebulous present

02:23.960 --> 02:24.960
now?

02:24.960 --> 02:25.960
You know, whatever this is.

02:25.960 --> 02:30.480
And to that I say, you know, besides the fact that nothing makes sense in our current hell

02:30.480 --> 02:33.240
world, it makes sense in context.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.320
It was a very different time.

02:35.320 --> 02:39.680
So the idea for this episode came about while I was actually writing it, and I was making

02:39.680 --> 02:43.240
all these playlists for, you know, mood.

02:43.240 --> 02:45.640
There's also a link to my main playlist in the description.

02:45.640 --> 02:51.040
It's full of mid-2000s cheese, if that's what you need to get you through this time.

02:51.040 --> 02:56.000
And listening to that sort of thing made me think a lot about, you know, the resistance

02:56.000 --> 02:58.120
music of that era.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.320
Or lack thereof.

02:59.320 --> 03:03.920
So while I had been working on this for a while, I was going to put it out later, you

03:03.920 --> 03:06.400
know, to be more of like a tie-in release thing.

03:06.400 --> 03:11.380
But then the topic of protests had to go and get all topical, so this got bumped up.

03:11.380 --> 03:16.040
So obviously the topic of music and music history isn't exactly my wheelhouse, so I

03:16.040 --> 03:20.840
wrote this with some consulting from our good friend Todd in the Shadows.

03:20.840 --> 03:21.840
Thank you for the plug.

03:21.840 --> 03:27.120
And if you like books, check out the new novel, Axiom's End, by my close personal friend,

03:27.120 --> 03:28.600
Lindsay Ellis.

03:28.600 --> 03:31.400
Gee, thanks.

03:31.400 --> 03:36.600
So before we get into the era at hand, first let's take a quick look at the history of

03:36.600 --> 03:42.000
protest music.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.240
Protest music can be found in pretty much every culture throughout the world, but you're

03:45.240 --> 03:49.920
much more likely to find it in cultures that are, you know, like, oppressed and colonized.

03:49.920 --> 03:55.240
Ireland, for instance, has a very long, proud history of protest songs, from Irish-language

03:55.240 --> 04:01.240
songs like Orosheidevá Hávaile to more recent ones like Kevin Berry.

04:01.240 --> 04:11.160
And it ranges all over the world, to the anti-apartheid music movement spearheaded

04:11.160 --> 04:15.280
by black South African musicians like Hugh Masekela, all the way to broader genres of

04:15.280 --> 04:35.920
music like British punk rock, a la The Clash, all the way to Yankee Goddamn Doodle Dandy.

04:35.920 --> 04:48.960
Yeah, so early American protest music was like basically taking British diss tracks

04:48.960 --> 05:03.600
and being like, yeah, our hats are stupid, we're proud of that.

05:03.600 --> 05:08.240
Now protest songs have been written and attached to movements of all sorts, from anti-racism

05:08.240 --> 05:24.560
to feminism to gay rights to literally nothing.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.360
You know, a revolution.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.760
Prayin' for it.

05:27.760 --> 05:28.760
Every day.

05:28.760 --> 05:34.520
Stop singing this at karaoke.

05:34.520 --> 05:38.480
But the common thread between most protest songs is that they, for obvious reasons, tend

05:38.480 --> 05:42.000
to come about in times of mass disenfranchisement or injustice.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.120
So the assumption that, hey, shit might be bad and we're all in agreement about that,

05:46.120 --> 05:51.280
therefore it's time for some great art that captures the zeitgeist of the now is not unfounded.

05:51.280 --> 06:02.840
But what is the basis of this assumption in America specifically?

06:02.840 --> 06:06.600
When people think of American protest music in pop songs, they're probably thinking

06:06.600 --> 06:11.840
of the music of the late 1960s and early 1970s, specifically music surrounding the Vietnam

06:11.840 --> 06:12.840
War.

06:12.840 --> 06:16.920
But what was it about this war that was different from that which became before and after?

06:16.920 --> 06:20.200
Well, the roots of the Vietnam War stretch back into the 19th century, and it was one

06:20.200 --> 06:24.120
of those conflicts that even now people have a hard time explaining what it was really

06:24.120 --> 06:31.600
about other than, like, you know, the vague proxy war, something-something communism.

06:31.600 --> 06:36.520
And that's not, you know, completely wrong, but like most war-related topics, taking a

06:36.520 --> 06:39.840
complex issue and simplifying it is not easy.

06:39.840 --> 06:44.320
So to keep it simple, we have this really long, nebulous war.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.340
Nobody really knows what we're fighting for.

06:46.340 --> 06:51.900
It results in the deaths of millions of Vietnamese people by some counts, and 58,000 U.S. troops.

06:51.900 --> 06:55.620
I think all the decent people in this country have decided this war is an absurdity and

06:55.620 --> 06:57.820
immoral, and it's time to bring it to a halt.

06:57.820 --> 07:06.820
We spend $322,000 for each enemy we kill in Vietnam.

07:06.820 --> 07:12.060
Well, all I can say is I'm not as patriotic as I used to be.

07:12.060 --> 07:15.380
As you can imagine, this sits very poorly with people all over the world, including

07:15.420 --> 07:19.860
people inside the United States, who genuinely do not understand why this is a conflict that

07:19.860 --> 07:22.580
should involve the U.S. military at all.

07:22.580 --> 07:24.380
And that brings us to...

07:24.380 --> 07:29.380
A-one, two, a-one, two, three, four!

07:29.380 --> 07:34.860
There was a wide array of protest music that came out of this war.

07:34.860 --> 07:39.660
Bands like Creedence Clearwater Revival, artists like Donovan, John Lennon, and Cat Stevens

07:39.660 --> 07:41.380
are all letting it out.

07:42.380 --> 07:50.660
Some of this music is critical and angry of the war effort and the military, but on the

07:50.660 --> 08:04.380
whole, the aesthetic trends more towards pleading for peace.

08:04.380 --> 08:08.260
Creedence Clearwater Revival's Fortunate Son is, of course, emblematic of the audio

08:08.260 --> 08:23.460
aesthetic when we think of music of the Vietnam War.

08:23.460 --> 08:32.060
Even the succinctly titled What Is It Good For?

08:32.060 --> 08:37.180
by Edwin Starr is pretty broad and less about America as a military machine, but again,

08:37.180 --> 08:41.460
all of this reflects a general sense that we don't know why we're fighting in Vietnam.

08:41.460 --> 08:43.660
And this is a problem to this day.

08:43.660 --> 08:48.460
This is completely anecdotal, but both of the writers of this episode, whenever it got

08:48.460 --> 08:55.140
to Vietnam time in our history classes, we spent maybe one day on it, and that was it

08:55.140 --> 08:56.140
moving on.

08:56.140 --> 08:57.140
Let's get to Watergate.

08:57.140 --> 09:01.940
So with Vietnam, not only did you have a wildly unpopular draft, you had a war where most

09:01.940 --> 09:06.740
American randos didn't really see that the cost was worth it.

09:06.740 --> 09:11.020
There wasn't really a cause and effect for why we should be there in the first place.

09:11.020 --> 09:14.700
Contrast this with 2001, where...

09:14.700 --> 09:17.220
This is as close as we can get to the base of the World Trade Center.

09:17.220 --> 09:21.780
You can see the firemen assembled here, the police officers, FBI agents, and you can see

09:21.780 --> 09:26.260
the two towers, a huge explosion now raining debris.

09:26.260 --> 09:30.620
9-11 was one of the most collectively traumatic events in U.S. history, and unlike combat

09:30.620 --> 09:35.460
in Vietnam, it was witnessed in real time by virtually everyone in the country.

09:35.460 --> 09:40.020
So rational or no, and it was not rational, there was a specific thing that was being

09:40.020 --> 09:44.260
responded to before the war in Iraq, which was why it was so easy for Bush to get so

09:44.260 --> 09:48.060
much of the public at large on board in the first place.

09:48.060 --> 09:53.820
American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq,

09:53.820 --> 09:57.700
to free its people, and to defend the world from grave danger.

09:57.700 --> 09:58.700
So you know what that means.

09:58.700 --> 10:02.140
We saw it in the 60s and 70s, and we're about to see it again.

10:02.140 --> 10:06.580
It's not just our direct action and our protests that's going to change the world.

10:06.580 --> 10:08.020
It's our music.

10:08.020 --> 10:10.220
It's our art.

10:10.220 --> 10:11.220
Let's go.

10:11.220 --> 10:12.220
What do we got?

10:12.220 --> 10:18.220
Cause we'll put a boot in your ass, it's the American way.

10:18.220 --> 10:19.220
Hmm.

10:19.220 --> 10:23.640
Probably should have seen that coming.

10:23.640 --> 10:28.700
For the last few months of 2001 and early 2002, there was this strange sort of sincerity

10:28.900 --> 10:32.860
that was, I don't know, kind of like the same vibe that was Kate McKinnon cosplaying as

10:32.860 --> 10:37.660
Hillary Clinton singing Hallelujah on the first SNL after the 2016 election.

10:37.660 --> 10:45.500
The first signs of trouble, the dust and the rubble, unspeakable loss.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.740
There were songs like Paul McCartney's Freedom,

10:47.740 --> 10:55.740
Freedom, we're talking about freedom.

10:55.780 --> 11:00.780
Neil Young's Let's Roll, and hey, Bruce Springsteen made an entire album that was basically him

11:00.780 --> 11:02.740
processing 9-11.

11:02.740 --> 11:14.260
But processing the thing through art did not come without resistance to, you know, resistance.

11:14.260 --> 11:23.060
The above example is called Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue, the Angry American,

11:23.100 --> 11:27.740
and was released in the spring of 2002, and was much more emblematic of music of the era

11:27.740 --> 11:36.540
than...

11:36.540 --> 11:50.980
In the months following 9-11, we saw a lot of jingoism bleed into the arts.

11:50.980 --> 11:55.220
A lot of kiss my American ass were number one sentiment hit the airwaves, most pervasively

11:55.220 --> 11:56.900
in top 50 country music.

11:56.900 --> 12:17.260
There were songs like Steve Curtis Chapman's Remember the Day, Daryl Worley's Have You Forgotten,

12:17.260 --> 12:32.500
and of course Toby Keith's Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue, the Angry American.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.580
And that was kind of new.

12:34.580 --> 12:41.660
With Vietnam, there wasn't really like a pro-war movement in America, it was more like anti-anti-war,

12:41.660 --> 12:45.780
like these hippies and Jane Fonda need to shut up and get off my lawn.

12:45.780 --> 12:49.180
And even during World War II, which had a much more concerted and organized government

12:49.180 --> 12:53.820
propaganda campaign, much of the music of the era was about like, you know, tee hee

12:53.820 --> 13:09.980
soldiers are cute, the music of that war wasn't really marked by a thirst for revenge.

13:09.980 --> 13:14.620
So with this jingoism comes a sort of reluctance to make any kind of mainstream art about the

13:14.620 --> 13:18.060
thing that is critical of the United States government in any capacity.

13:18.060 --> 13:22.460
For example, Michael Moore criticizing Bush at the 2003 Oscars got him booed.

13:22.460 --> 13:31.140
We live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons, whether

13:31.140 --> 13:36.940
it's the fictition of duct tape or the fictitious of orange alerts.

13:36.940 --> 13:42.700
Opposing the war in Iraq got him booed at the Oscars by these people.

13:42.700 --> 13:46.100
So this was around the same time the Congress cafeteria stopped selling French fries and

13:46.100 --> 13:48.380
started calling them Freedom Fries.

13:48.380 --> 13:51.420
Because France did not want to join the invasion.

13:51.420 --> 13:55.180
You know, not like our buddies the British over here, they were all about it.

13:55.180 --> 13:58.660
Our friends the British, with us at every stupid turn.

13:58.660 --> 14:05.260
The special relationship.

14:05.260 --> 14:08.860
But these transgressions were all minor cultural blips compared to

14:08.860 --> 14:20.100
So right before the Iraq invasion, Texas country trio the Dixie Chicks, who were at

14:20.100 --> 14:24.980
the height of their popularity, were kicking off their 2003 world tour in London and opened

14:24.980 --> 14:41.580
their concert with this.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.420
And it all went to hell from there.

14:43.420 --> 14:47.860
Thousands of phone calls flooded country music radio stations from Denver to Nashville, calls

14:47.860 --> 14:51.620
demanding that the Dixie Chicks be removed from the station's playlists, their single

14:51.620 --> 14:57.220
at the time, a cover of Fleetwood Mac's Landslide, dropped off the charts almost immediately,

14:57.220 --> 15:04.740
the American Red Cross refused a promotional partnership with them, fans burned CDs, and

15:04.740 --> 15:06.940
of course, death threats.

15:06.940 --> 15:13.540
Lots and lots of death threats.

15:13.540 --> 15:17.700
Lead singer Natalie Maines tried to apologize, but the damage was done, marking the Dixie

15:17.700 --> 15:21.580
Chicks as a cautionary tale for people who tried to oppose the president.

15:21.580 --> 15:24.620
And they didn't even sing about anything.

15:24.620 --> 15:28.460
And although it turned the Dixie Chicks into the literal face of the resistance, and they

15:28.460 --> 15:32.900
have released some new music fairly recently, their careers never really recovered to the

15:32.900 --> 15:35.660
pre-Bush Bad Glory days.

15:35.660 --> 15:41.080
But the short term result, at least as far as the next several years went, was that musicians

15:41.080 --> 15:45.540
were extremely bearish about criticizing the status quo.

15:45.540 --> 15:48.740
Which brings us to the audio aesthetic of the early 2000s.

15:48.740 --> 15:54.940
Compare this to the late 1960s, where the sound is kind of gritty and raw and honest,

15:54.940 --> 15:57.420
but also kind of tongue in cheek and clever.

15:57.420 --> 16:11.780
If I had to succinctly describe the mood of pop music of that era, I'd say it was dumb.

16:11.780 --> 16:13.700
It was big and dumb.

16:13.700 --> 16:14.700
And loud.

16:14.700 --> 16:24.100
Big and dumb and loud.

16:24.100 --> 16:27.340
You didn't have these moody, thoughtful pop stars like you have now.

16:27.340 --> 16:35.660
And the ones you did have were like, I don't know, Evanescence?

16:35.660 --> 16:40.020
In the months and years that followed the Dixie Chicksening, pop stars kind of responded

16:40.020 --> 16:48.780
to the thing by not really saying anything.

16:48.780 --> 16:55.060
Madonna released her lead single from her album, American Life, in which she sings about

16:55.060 --> 16:59.860
how hollow the American dream is because she's not satisfied with her life despite having

16:59.860 --> 17:08.100
like agents and nannies and soy lattes.

17:08.100 --> 17:10.020
All set to this backdrop.

17:10.020 --> 17:12.500
Or rather, this was originally the music video.

17:12.500 --> 17:36.500
It got scrapped because Madonna chickened out after the invasion went ahead.

17:36.500 --> 17:44.100
So what was released was just her in front of a bad green screen and, you know, flags.

17:44.100 --> 18:01.580
Similarly we have Jewel's album track from her album, 0304, simply titled America.

18:01.580 --> 18:04.460
Literally we live in a society.

18:04.460 --> 18:09.020
So arguably the best we got out of 2003 was The Black Eyed Peas.

18:09.020 --> 18:34.300
You know, it was more in the vein of protest songs that sort of vaguely plead for peace.

18:34.300 --> 18:38.780
So one might say that this was the last gasp of the thoughtful peas.

18:38.780 --> 18:46.580
You know, before the My Humps era.

18:46.580 --> 18:47.660
But was that it?

18:47.660 --> 18:50.300
Was everyone else too scared to try?

18:50.300 --> 18:51.300
No.

18:51.300 --> 18:54.300
Attempts were made.

18:54.300 --> 19:00.380
In 2004 there was an entire double album called Rock Against Bush.

19:00.380 --> 19:04.940
Of course the albums consist mostly of artists that were either no longer relevant or you

19:04.940 --> 19:06.500
had never heard of.

19:06.500 --> 19:08.700
Plus that cover art is fantastic.

19:08.700 --> 19:12.300
It's like, oh no, not the rock and roll.

19:12.300 --> 19:16.380
And while they did have some songs written for the album, many were repurposed from earlier

19:16.380 --> 19:25.980
albums, like this offspring song from 1992.

19:25.980 --> 19:29.700
Perhaps one of the more fondly remembered efforts comes from System of a Down, with

19:29.700 --> 19:40.620
their song BYOB, or Bring Your Own Bombs.

19:40.620 --> 19:48.420
This is funnier in hindsight considering what the drummer currently feels compelled to share.

19:48.420 --> 19:52.780
For something even more on the nose, A Perfect Circle released a single called Counting Bodies

19:52.780 --> 19:59.780
Like Sheep To The Rhythm Of The War Drums, in 2004.

19:59.780 --> 20:05.780
Ugh, subtle.

20:05.780 --> 20:06.780
I don't get it.

20:06.780 --> 20:12.780
I don't get what you're trying to tell me.

20:12.780 --> 20:18.660
It's too vague.

20:18.660 --> 20:23.220
Neil Young released an album called Living With War, and wrote a song straight up called

20:23.220 --> 20:38.020
Let's Impeach The President.

20:38.020 --> 20:49.620
There's a similar call in the Beastie Boys' 2004 song It Takes Time To Build.

20:49.620 --> 20:59.180
From Pearl Jam, we got Bush Liger.

20:59.180 --> 21:07.340
The song is also terrible.

21:07.340 --> 21:19.540
Even Eminem got in on it.

21:19.540 --> 21:23.980
And for all of Eminem's early controversies, I feel like everyone has forgotten the fact

21:23.980 --> 21:32.980
that Eminem was investigated by the Secret Service for some of his lyrics.

21:33.980 --> 21:40.260
Yeah, totally out of character for Eminem to fantasize doing murder in his raps.

21:40.260 --> 21:44.380
A single with a video, Mosh, was released in 2004, before the election, as a plea to

21:44.380 --> 21:51.500
vote Bush out of office.

21:51.500 --> 22:02.960
And we see stuff like this from Eminem now, but at the time, the music video was incredibly

22:02.960 --> 22:04.560
serious and somber for him.

22:04.560 --> 22:09.120
For comparison, this was released right after Just Lose It, Eminem's goofiest and worst

22:09.120 --> 22:11.560
song ever?

22:11.560 --> 22:16.360
Yeah, I might be going with ever.

22:16.360 --> 22:22.760
So yeah, you might notice that this is mostly white dudes and alt-rock.

22:22.760 --> 22:24.560
And white dudes doing alt-rock.

22:24.560 --> 22:28.560
There was indie darling Nellie Mackay, who I think was meant to be a big pop star, sort

22:28.560 --> 22:36.400
of anti-Nora Jones.

22:36.400 --> 22:41.640
But then the label kind of pulled funding for the marketing of her album, probably because

22:41.640 --> 22:48.400
of lines like this.

22:48.400 --> 22:49.520
But these were not mainstream.

22:49.520 --> 22:53.160
The aforementioned were not exactly top 40 singles.

22:53.160 --> 22:55.280
With one notable exception.

22:55.280 --> 23:00.160
Yep, it's the moment you've all been waiting for.

23:00.160 --> 23:06.840
Yes, the definitive anti-war album of the Iraq War era comes from aging garage punk

23:06.840 --> 23:12.360
guyliner burnouts Green Day.

23:12.360 --> 23:13.840
At least that's how I felt at the time.

23:13.840 --> 23:23.280
I say aging, but fuck's sake, Billy Joe Armstrong was 32.

23:23.280 --> 23:33.680
So for a quick Green Day rundown, this was their breakout hit.

23:33.680 --> 23:39.280
Their brand was like extremely young and not very smart, return of the bratty snot-nosed

23:39.280 --> 23:40.280
punk.

23:40.280 --> 23:45.040
They were a lot less miserable than grunge, more just bored and frustrated, lazy and aimless,

23:45.040 --> 23:51.160
trapped in the dirt town with nothing to do, the perfect encapsulation of mid-90s ennui.

23:51.160 --> 24:05.240
And then came the huge hit, the sellout of all sellouts, punks writing a prom theme.

24:05.240 --> 24:08.160
And it's funny to think that this was like actually a thing that people cared about in

24:08.160 --> 24:09.160
the 90s.

24:09.160 --> 24:12.760
But after that, they had kind of one middling album and then they fell off the radar for

24:12.760 --> 24:13.760
several years.

24:13.760 --> 24:19.060
And I'm including all of this because Green Day is just about the last band you would

24:19.060 --> 24:25.420
ever expect to be like political, the voice of the resistance, especially in an atmosphere

24:25.420 --> 24:33.380
where the most successful political music is.

24:33.380 --> 24:38.380
There's a lot to unpack here, the tone, the aesthetic, an exploration of an entire generation

24:38.380 --> 24:49.500
and country feeling duped, but you know, a happy one.

24:49.500 --> 24:52.780
Like the album is a, it's a grenade, but you know, a heart-shaped one.

24:52.780 --> 24:57.420
A lot of the tie-in art, marketing, music video used a lot of wartime imagery, but you

24:57.420 --> 24:59.840
know, like a punk hot topic version.

24:59.840 --> 25:02.300
The lead single, of course, was American Idiot.

25:02.300 --> 25:06.180
And when you compare it to stuff like the System of a Down or Perfect Circle song, this

25:06.180 --> 25:09.460
one kind of hits the combination of upbeat and angry.

25:09.460 --> 25:17.540
That was just where we were in 2004, a time when the top 40 was aggressively apolitical.

25:17.540 --> 25:22.160
The song succeeds in the same way that Credence did by being kind of tongue in cheek.

25:22.160 --> 25:27.340
So you could make the argument that Green Day is our generation's Credence.

25:27.340 --> 25:34.340
American Idiot is our fortunate son.

25:34.340 --> 25:45.220
Less remembered, but more deliberate is the single Holiday.

25:45.220 --> 25:52.020
And the chorus's refrain was according to Armstrong, intended to reflect the average

25:52.020 --> 25:54.220
American's apathy on the issues of the day.

25:54.220 --> 26:02.100
And then there's the really big hit off that album.

26:02.100 --> 26:06.820
Perhaps the obvious parallel to Time of Your Life, Wake Me Up When September Ends.

26:06.820 --> 26:10.220
The more sincere counterpoint to American Idiot, and one of their biggest hits of all

26:10.220 --> 26:15.100
time, it's basically a song about not wanting to live through the time you're in.

26:15.100 --> 26:19.900
Wow, good thing we don't have that on we anymore.

26:19.900 --> 26:24.420
If Holiday is anger at the apathy, September kind of leans into it.

26:24.420 --> 26:28.740
Although the music video seems less anti-war than the previous ones, as it has a lot more

26:28.740 --> 26:30.140
sympathy for the soldier.

26:30.180 --> 26:33.660
Aesthetically, it's not that far from Toby Keith's American Soldier.

26:33.660 --> 26:38.980
I don't do it for the glory, I just do it anyway.

26:38.980 --> 26:52.900
American Idiot, and Green Day in general, had a musical, which did have a soldier goes

26:52.900 --> 26:53.900
to war element.

26:53.900 --> 26:55.100
I didn't see it.

26:55.100 --> 26:59.900
It wasn't a complete failure, but it didn't really stick around, which might be indicative

26:59.940 --> 27:03.860
of it not belonging in the time it was released, in the 2010s.

27:03.860 --> 27:06.820
Like imagine a Creedence musical in the 1980s.

27:06.820 --> 27:09.540
I never thought I'd end up doing Broadway.

27:09.540 --> 27:10.940
Me neither, Billy Joe.

27:10.940 --> 27:28.420
So I guess my hot take is, maybe Green Day is good, actually?

27:28.460 --> 27:33.100
Even relatively popular artists like Eminem and System of a Down didn't really figure

27:33.100 --> 27:38.340
out how to make any art that stayed in the popular lexicon the way Green Day did.

27:38.340 --> 27:42.060
And part of it, like with the Black Eyed Peas, was that Green Day was palatable to the mainstream

27:42.060 --> 27:44.900
because they don't mention Bush or Iraq by name.

27:44.900 --> 27:46.100
But this isn't a bad thing.

27:46.100 --> 27:50.540
They have this in common with a lot of protest music, from Irish music that made allusions

27:50.540 --> 28:11.340
to the British, all the way to the music of the Vietnam War.

28:11.340 --> 28:16.580
Just the complete on-the-noseness of calling people sheep while Bush surfs through a river

28:16.580 --> 28:18.800
of blood just feels preachy.

28:18.800 --> 28:23.080
This was just not an era for political activism through art and music, leaving Green Day the

28:23.080 --> 28:29.400
only act that managed to thread the needle and get a big hit out of it.

28:29.400 --> 28:33.120
Before the 2004 election.

28:33.120 --> 28:34.120
Speaking of which...

28:34.120 --> 28:35.120
Thank you all for coming.

28:35.120 --> 28:36.120
We had a long night.

28:36.120 --> 29:02.640
Voters turned out in record numbers and delivered an historic victory.

29:02.640 --> 29:04.120
Bush gets re-elected.

29:04.120 --> 29:10.120
And I guess the trend of anti-Bush, anti-war punk rock seemed just kind of like a waste

29:10.120 --> 29:13.480
of time.

29:13.480 --> 29:14.480
Like this is it.

29:14.480 --> 29:15.480
This is where we live now.

29:15.480 --> 29:20.280
You see less protest songs so much as generally being resigned to this being the way things

29:20.280 --> 29:21.280
are.

29:21.280 --> 29:30.680
Not a lot of fighting the establishment and the music.

29:30.720 --> 29:41.720
Sheryl Crow gave us God Bless This Mess.

29:41.720 --> 30:04.360
R. Williams gives us a less optimistic interpretation of the new America with Empire.

30:04.400 --> 30:15.240
Drake has a much more empathetic plea with Dear Mr. President.

30:15.240 --> 30:17.320
There's gotta be a human man in there somewhere.

30:17.320 --> 30:23.240
LL Cool J had a similar song called Mr. President which similarly made an empathetic plea inquiring

30:23.240 --> 30:33.360
just what is going on in your head.

30:33.360 --> 30:53.000
And Tori Amos had a short album track called Yo George.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.560
But on the whole, especially after the election of 2004, most mainstream art couldn't seem

30:57.560 --> 31:01.880
to bring itself to wholly or even partially condemn the establishment that the majority

31:01.880 --> 31:06.400
of people by now pretty much agreed was bad.

31:06.400 --> 31:10.800
To me, the sound and the attitude of that era is best embodied with music like John

31:10.800 --> 31:25.200
Mayer's Waiting on the World to Change, a bad song that is bad and I hate it.

31:25.200 --> 31:29.720
So here in 2006, one of the biggest hits of the year is effectively about riding out the

31:29.720 --> 31:37.840
bullshit.

31:37.840 --> 31:41.440
Somehow John Mayer invented the opposite of a revolutionary song.

31:41.440 --> 31:51.480
And if it reminds me of anything, it reminds me of a song from Avenue Q called For Now.

31:51.480 --> 32:02.560
So songs like Waiting on the World to Change and For Now kind of back up this idea that

32:02.560 --> 32:06.280
you know, we tried, we fought, it didn't work.

32:06.280 --> 32:08.840
So right now we just have to wait it out.

32:08.840 --> 32:15.440
We will survive this.

32:15.440 --> 32:17.200
So where does that put us today?

32:17.200 --> 32:26.920
How do we equivocate that era with this one?

32:26.920 --> 32:29.680
Well the struggle is a lot more nebulous.

32:29.680 --> 32:35.320
The issue isn't this war is unjust, the issue is more everything is unjust.

32:35.320 --> 32:45.200
Much more common is the identity-based protest song like Lady Gaga's Born This Way or Taylor

32:45.200 --> 32:50.220
Swift's You Need to Calm Down.

32:50.220 --> 32:54.400
So it's not that protest music has gone away, but the thing that is being protested has

32:54.400 --> 32:56.840
become extremely broad.

32:56.840 --> 33:00.760
Protesting a war is a problem with a clearer solution, but today's big issues are harder

33:00.760 --> 33:05.360
to solve than send the troops home or vote this guy out of office.

33:05.360 --> 33:18.800
But from Taylor Swift all the way to celebrities singing Imagine, we can say this.

33:18.800 --> 33:23.200
At least there's no trend of songs proudly proclaiming their disengagement, or reassuring

33:23.200 --> 33:28.200
themselves that it'll be fine, we'll live through this, because I think that most people

33:28.200 --> 33:33.940
finally get that no, not everyone will live through this actually, and there is no guarantee

33:33.940 --> 33:35.940
that this is for now.

33:35.940 --> 33:43.940
Don't stress, relax, let life roll off your backs, except for death and paying taxes.

33:43.940 --> 33:49.940
Everything in life is only for now.

33:49.940 --> 33:55.540
So to bring this thing full circle, in December of 2016, former Dresden Dolls frontwoman and

33:55.540 --> 34:04.140
musician, Amanda Palmer, wrote the following.

34:04.140 --> 34:08.660
Being an optimist, there is a part of me, especially having studied Weimar Germany extensively,

34:08.660 --> 34:10.860
I'm like, this is our moment.

34:10.860 --> 34:13.580
Donald Trump is going to make punk rock great again.

34:13.580 --> 34:17.420
We're all going to crawl down staircases into basements and speakeasies and make amazing

34:17.420 --> 34:19.740
satirically political art.

34:19.740 --> 34:22.900
Similarly, author Joyce Carol Oates wrote,

34:22.900 --> 34:26.860
Artists thrive on turbulence and estrangement from establishment slash authority.

34:26.860 --> 34:29.780
So Trump presidency would not be a total disaster.

34:29.780 --> 34:30.780
For some.

34:30.780 --> 34:31.780
For some?

34:31.780 --> 34:33.420
Well that's a caveat.

34:33.420 --> 34:38.020
So here's the thing that happens in times of great cultural stress, there's this sort

34:38.020 --> 34:44.820
of impulse to try to give meaning to the badness and the suffering, like if you put one suffering

34:44.820 --> 34:48.780
unit in, you get one art unit out.

34:48.780 --> 34:54.140
And I understand that impulse, you need to give meaning to the badness, but I think it's

34:54.140 --> 35:00.100
kind of misguided to give meaning to suffering by saying, hey, at least we'll get great art

35:00.100 --> 35:01.100
out of it.

35:01.100 --> 35:05.620
Amanda Palmer's comment about Weimar Germany rings particularly tone deaf in this context.

35:05.620 --> 35:09.160
Like yeah, hey, the Holocaust sucked, but we got the producers, didn't we?

35:09.160 --> 35:14.620
And this tends to put stress on people that's also kind of unnecessary, like I'm at home,

35:14.620 --> 35:20.060
I haven't gone outside in months, there's a pandemic, and why have I not written the

35:20.060 --> 35:21.240
Great American Novel?

35:21.240 --> 35:24.900
Why have I not found a way to turn my suffering into art?

35:24.900 --> 35:29.060
Which is like perfectly encapsulated in this Onion headline, man not sure why he thought

35:29.060 --> 35:33.660
most psychologically taxing situation of his life would be the thing to make him productive.

35:33.660 --> 35:38.940
But moreover, art and music, you know, it's great and all, but it's not a substitute for

35:38.940 --> 35:41.900
direct action.

35:41.900 --> 35:44.620
And there's no better evidence for that than these last couple weeks.

35:44.620 --> 35:50.380
As he slides into position and goes straight into another really up song.

35:50.380 --> 35:53.460
And I hope that we're kind of turning a corner on this mindset.

35:53.460 --> 35:57.520
Because while yes, a lot of incredible meaningful art has come out of suffering, we should not

35:57.520 --> 36:01.440
think of suffering as a prerequisite for interesting and meaningful art.

36:01.440 --> 36:05.660
And we certainly shouldn't try to put a silver lining to people's suffering because consumers

36:05.660 --> 36:07.340
might get a good art out of it.

36:12.900 --> 36:15.620
Again, the pre-order link for my book is in the description.

36:15.620 --> 36:21.900
It has nothing to do with this topic, except for being set in the 2000s.

36:21.900 --> 36:25.380
Well, I guess it does have like some protesting in it.

36:25.380 --> 36:28.780
And George W. Bush is an extremely minor character.

36:28.780 --> 36:31.180

36:37.980 --> 36:41.020
it in like a page in the book.

36:41.020 --> 36:43.860
The instructions for that are also in the description.

36:43.860 --> 36:46.460
You have to do a whole thing that involves screenshots.
