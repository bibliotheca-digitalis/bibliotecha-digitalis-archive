0	8660	Miss Ellis, my firm represents Addison Cain.
8660	12760	We are aware of your recent YouTube video and other postings related to lawsuits involving
12760	13760	my client.
13760	18760	In your video, you used my client's copyrighted content and made numerous false claims including
18760	24440	statements from allegations made in the lawsuits that were not based on evidence or facts.
24440	26920	These false statements include the following allegations.
26920	33080	1. That my client claimed to own tropes and that was what the DMCA's at issue were about.
33080	36360	2. That my client blackmailed Zoe Ellis.
36360	41240	3. That Miss Cain's publisher settled due to Miss Cain's perjury in Oklahoma.
41240	47360	4. That Miss Cain committed perjury and 5. That the other lawsuits in Virginia died for
47360	49120	unrelated reasons.
49120	52120	These statements are entirely false and defamatory.
52120	56880	No proof was ever provided by Miss Ellis or her company in the lawsuits about any of these
56880	57880	issues.
57880	61440	While my client was accused of perjury by Miss Ellis' company, the basis of that claim
61440	66800	was never argued before court and Miss Cain never misrepresented any facts to the court.
66800	73340	Her previous publisher filed the DMCA's and no DMCA's were sent by Miss Cain to Oklahoma.
73340	77680	An accurate account of the various lawsuits may be viewed on my client's Facebook page
77680	81960	if you are interested in a factual account instead of spreading the previous lies and
81960	86760	inaccuracies spread by Quill, Zoe Ellis, Courtney Milan and others.
86760	91160	We believe that your video violates the terms and services of your Patreon account as it
91160	94440	clearly includes abusive content and uses my client's content.
94440	98680	My client is currently receiving threats, hate mail, and other harassing posts due to
98680	99820	your video.
99820	103520	We demand that you remove or correct the video immediately.
103520	112200	Regards, Tina Watson
112200	113200	Welcome back.
113240	118360	Now, if you didn't see my previous video about the so-called Omegaverse lawsuit, I suggest
118360	120320	you go ahead and do that now.
120320	122600	It's Tiger King for her.
122600	124760	And also, engage with it.
124760	125760	Give it a like.
125760	126760	Give it a comment.
126760	132200	Because the algorithm was not kind to that one and it did not show up in most subscribers'
132200	133200	recommendations.
133200	134200	Hmm.
134200	135200	Weird.
135200	139860	In fact, while you're here, go ahead and give this a like.
139860	140860	Give it a comment.
140860	142040	Give it several comments.
142040	143640	Get in fights in the comments.
143640	145360	Drive that engagement.
145360	146360	Because this...
146360	149560	Well, I don't want to say this is war, but...
149560	153880	Honey, you've got a big storm coming.
153880	159400	Now let me start by saying that I had never intended to make this video at all.
159400	163200	Like most of my videos, except for Game of Thrones, which I will die mad about.
163200	165960	Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something.
165960	167260	That's whinging.
167260	168680	That was supposed to be one and done.
168680	171640	But then someone had to go and get me involved in the whole thing.
171640	176480	Now one way or the other, I had to take September off in order to finish revisions on my second
176480	178000	book, which is out next fall.
178000	179480	It's called Truth of the Divine.
179480	180480	You can...
180480	181960	Well, not available for pre-order yet.
181960	182960	I don't know.
182960	183960	I'll pimp it later.
183960	189320	But also, a lot went down in the month of September and there was a lot of documentation
189320	194940	that I had to go through in order to cobble together as coherent a narrative as I'm about
194940	196300	to attempt to make.
196300	198640	Now before we get started, a note.
198640	201960	Yes, despite my costume, this is not theater.
201960	203040	This is all real.
203040	204220	This is really happening.
204220	210640	And that also said, Addison Cain and I are both regrettably, technically, public figures.
210640	216000	Now that said, despite my request that you do not harass this woman from the last video,
216000	218640	some of you were shitty anyway.
218640	222720	And I get that we're all bored and losing our minds and that like, you know, cancelling
222720	224280	is fun now.
224280	226880	But again, I'd like to ask you to not.
226880	227880	Like this guy.
227880	229720	Like, we don't need to bring her shitty book into it.
229720	234200	I know I'm not on the hook if any of you idiots post cringe in her ats or on her Facebook
234200	238300	page, but it is, as the kids say, a bad look.
238300	242960	Now that said, with regard to the last video, I feel like I was pretty even-handed with
242960	246400	the criticisms I made and the conclusions I drew.
246400	251760	And I definitely withheld a lot of criticisms and comments about Addison Cain because I
251760	256480	was concerned that they might be a little unnecessarily mean.
256480	259200	But trust, I feel no such obligation this time.
259200	262840	So before we get into this, a refresher on the Dramatis Personae.
262840	268500	Addison Cain, not her real name, erotica author who claims to have spearheaded the concept
268500	276880	of Het Omegaverse, or ABO, and who has a knack for accusing her fellow authors of plagiarism
276880	280460	because her ideas are just that good.
280460	282080	Because I am your alpha.
282080	283480	It was almost a roar.
283480	286000	You want to be f***ed by me.
286000	287280	Do you understand?
287280	292600	Zoe Ellis, also not her real name and one of the alleged plagiarists, who in 2018 sued
292600	297240	Addison Cain for alleged abusive DMCA takedown notices.
297240	301920	She is also, in my opinion, correct.
301920	304800	Those takedown notices were illegal and abusive.
304800	309640	Blushing Books, Addison Cain's former publisher, who gleefully threw themselves in front of
309640	315720	the bus for Addison Cain during the lawsuit, only to be hilariously betrayed by her and
315720	321880	backstabbed later, and she hates them now, and they are also on her eternity quest for
321880	322880	revenge.
322880	323880	Patreon.
323880	324880	Yes, really.
324880	329680	The crowdfunding website that my company relies on for most of our income.
329680	330960	YouTube.
330960	331960	This hell space.
331960	333960	The Electronic Frontier Foundation.
333960	339080	The leading legal non-profit defending digital privacy, free speech, and innovation that
339080	342100	I plugged at the end of the last video.
342100	343840	And also my lawyers.
343960	350980	Taniyah Watson, a lawyer, shown here getting brunch with her client Addison Cain in a public
350980	354460	Facebook post that somebody wanted me to see.
354460	355460	Actually several posts.
355460	359500	Like, yeah, you know, I'm just getting lunch with my lawyer, you know, so just some girls
359500	362860	talking about copyright law, gal pals.
362860	366140	So that crazy month of September, what happened?
366140	369300	So the video went public early on September 3rd.
369300	373620	I was trying to get away from it, again, that was supposed to be revision month.
373620	380360	But later that day, I get this email from Taniyah Watson saying all that weird shit.
380360	384100	Like yes, I am a barred lawyer in the state of Oklahoma.
384100	387760	If you want the truth, go to my client's Facebook page.
387760	393340	Why should you go to jail for a crime someone else noticed?
393340	394760	You don't need double talk.
394760	395760	You need blah blah blah.
395760	396760	Blah blah blah.
396760	397760	No habla espanol.
397760	401780	The thing about it is, this email didn't have any, like, thread of litigation in it.
401780	406220	It wasn't like, take it down or else, or take it down or we'll sue.
406220	410220	It was just take it down, gal pals.
410220	414340	So I decided to milk that for some content because it was indeed very funny.
414340	418340	I posted it to Twitter and decided to move on.
418340	419940	But of course, that was not the end of it.
419940	424460	The following day, I get an email from the head of legal at Patreon, Colin Sullivan.
424460	432300	You see, Addison Cain has sent a DMCA takedown notice to Patreon demanding that I take the
432300	434740	post about Omegaverse down.
434740	438540	Honestly, yeah, I was kind of surprised.
438540	444540	Like, the entire video was about how dumb and abusive and transparently flimsy her DMCA
444540	445540	case was.
445540	449660	But shh, we're still doing this, I guess.
449660	454020	So what Addison Cain apparently even failed to consider is that, unlike companies like
454020	458540	Amazon and YouTube, Patreon is not a giant faceless conglomerate.
458540	462860	Not only am I one of Patreon's top creators, so of course they're going to investigate
462860	467940	any wrongdoing I'm accused of, they also took the time to watch the video and found the
467940	470980	whole situation a touch ironic.
470980	473580	So I talked with the legal team at Patreon for a while.
473580	478020	We discussed some options and what we decided was that they, in order to not be on the hook
478020	484220	legally just in case litigation came down the pike, we will honor that DMCA takedown
484220	485220	notice.
485220	495460	And all that meant was I had to unlink the YouTube URL from the Patreon post for 10 days
495460	499060	and then relink it.
499060	505620	So I send the DMCA counter notice and Patreon basically tells Addison Cain and her lawyer
505620	509140	that they have 10 days to sue me or I can do whatever I want with the content.
509140	512860	And here's the thing, despite my years and years of doing this, I've never actually gotten
512860	515020	a DMCA takedown notice before.
515020	521140	But here's the other thing, Patreon was so, I guess the word was offended that she thought
521140	529980	this would work, that they were like, hey, if you were to, I don't know, end up in court
530940	539820	one way or the other, we would stand behind you and, you know, maybe fund your legal fees.
539820	541180	Like that would be a first.
541180	545900	Now during this whole time, despite all of these behind the scenes machinations, publicly
545900	548380	she's weirdly quiet about the whole thing.
548380	551700	She has to this date not said anything on her Twitter or her public Facebook or her
551700	552700	private Facebook.
552700	558700	However, on September 5th, rather than say something about me, she instead redirects
558700	563340	her ire and her fans to another author.
563340	564660	And we will get to that too.
564660	569380	And although I cannot say for certain that she had anything to do with this, other strange
569380	573340	goings on happened with that video and my channel in general.
573340	579660	Somebody reported the ads as having violence and terrorism in it and full nudity and YouTube
579660	581420	review was like, yeah, that checks out.
581420	583660	So I had to demonetize the thing.
583660	588500	Someone reported the URL to Twitter, meaning that sometimes when the URL popped up, it
588500	590580	would be clocked as not safe.
590580	595980	And someone was reporting the video, meaning that it was age restricted as recently as
595980	598980	last week since lifted.
598980	604580	But maybe that's all just a huge coincidence, even though none of those things have ever
604580	606900	happened to me before.
606900	611300	In my 10 years of doing this, big old coincidence.
611300	614820	During this time, Addison Cain also hires a PR person.
614820	619700	And on September 9th, she emails entertainment journalist Kaylee Donaldson asking if she
619700	622500	wants to softball an interview with Addison Cain.
622500	625860	Kaylee, of course, posted this email to Twitter and it was very funny.
625860	631020	We privately speculated that it was maybe because she was a known fan of the morally
631020	634540	questionable monster love genre.
634540	641300	But because of that, one of the very last book reviews she did was of my book.
641300	642860	So I know what you're all thinking.
642900	648940	She sends a DMCA takedown notice to Patreon, but not to YouTube.
648940	649940	Why?
649940	651700	And we puzzled over this.
651700	653340	Why go for Patreon?
653340	655900	The content is not hosted on Patreon.
655900	658620	It's hosted on YouTube and Nebula.
658620	662980	Well, it turns out she did go for YouTube.
662980	669020	On Friday, September 11th, I get an email from YouTube saying, hey, someone sent us
669020	671500	a DMCA takedown notice.
671500	676420	We looked into it and we think it's bogus.
676420	678740	Because we think this probably falls under fair use.
678740	681820	So we're going to ignore it.
686820	691940	I have never heard of this ever happening, of YouTube actually getting a DMCA takedown
691940	697380	notice and saying, no.
697380	702100	Because as we discussed in the last video, that puts YouTube possibly legally liable
702100	705540	if Wolfcock Karen decides to start suing people.
705540	710900	But as we have already learned, when a platform gets a DMCA takedown notice, they have to
710900	716180	send the notice to the person being accused of copyright infringement.
716180	724740	Meaning, I got the letter that Addison Cain sent YouTube and...
724740	727500	To whom it may concern.
727500	730660	The work infringed is not fair use.
730660	733060	My book is not public domain.
733060	736220	It is a creative work, not a textbook.
736220	739980	The poster reads my books to degrade my work.
739980	745540	This is not fair use of a copyrighted work, nor was this video a review of my work.
745540	747260	It was a personal attack.
747260	752900	The poster significantly transformed my original work, both by altering the work and by mocking
752900	757540	it for the poster's financial gain via YouTube and Patreon.
757540	761260	Monetizing the video does not make this fair use.
761260	767020	Furthermore, this poster, in regards to her video, refers to the necessity of blurring
767020	771740	out the face of my child as DAMN BABY on Twitter.
771740	773180	Tweet attached.
773180	778020	The baby in question's safety has already been threatened via the lawsuit this video
778020	779780	monopolizes upon.
779780	784940	Photos of my daughter and how to find my address under my real name, not pseudonym,
784940	786380	were made public.
786380	789100	Those documents were sealed by the court.
789100	796820	I feel Lindsay Ellis is a menace, a threat to my child, and is monetizing defamation
796820	799380	for personal, financial gain.
803140	805620	Oh, I am gonna milk the shit out of that.
809980	818220	Alright, let's, uh, break this bat-shittery down, shall we?
818220	819900	Yes, I'm still wearing the falsies.
819900	822700	Like, this is as much effort as you're gonna get look-wise.
822700	824020	This isn't ContraPoints.
824020	826620	Because I don't want this to be an hour of pwnage.
826620	828780	This is an opportunity.
828780	831140	We can make this a learning experience.
831140	834580	So, uh, let's break this apart.
834580	836460	My book is not public domain.
836820	839980	It is a creative work, not a textbook.
839980	845420	Copyrighted material is copyrighted material, whether it's an educational textbook or
845420	846420	wolf porn.
846420	851380	That said, the sum total of Kane's work that we used was about 400 words.
851380	855100	Um, about two minutes out of an hour-long video.
855100	858860	The poster reads my books to degrade my work.
858860	863900	This is not fair use of a copyrighted work, nor was this video a review of my work.
863900	865380	Yeah, I don't really do reviews.
865420	868860	Uh, fair use actually encompasses a lot more than that.
868860	873860	That said, we didn't just include copyrighted material for shits and giggles.
873860	879420	We included it in order to give examples of the content that was being fought over.
879420	884860	It was a personal attack, framed around two lawsuits filed against me personally, in which
884860	887860	the poster did not like the outcomes in court.
887860	895340	I mean, I know it feels personal, maybe, but I didn't say anything about Addison Kane
895660	899020	outside of what was relevant to the court case.
899020	904700	The reason I came down the way I did was because I looked at the evidence and was like, hmm,
904700	907660	there's kind of a clear right and wrong side here.
907660	911580	That said, we seem to be in disagreement of what the outcomes even were, and I'll get
911580	912580	to that later.
912580	918340	Furthermore, my work has been altered, words blacked out, thus creating work product the
918340	921060	poster did not have permission to create.
921060	925060	I, uh, I don't usually ask for permission.
925060	930540	When people talk about fair use, they usually restrict it to educational purposes, criticism,
930540	937140	and parody, and they don't seem to think that it can exist outside of that, but it actually
937140	938540	does go further.
938540	942260	The other key word here is transformative, and that's sort of the ironic thing with her
942260	949460	letter at all, is she's upset that I did a dramatic reading of her work and blacked out
949460	955380	some of the words, thereby transforming it, lending more credence to fair use.
955380	958740	Monetizing the video does not make this fair use.
958740	963300	Uh, it doesn't actually have anything to do with whether it's monetized or not.
963300	971020	Like, it being commercial kind of works against the argument, but you can monetize things
971020	976220	and it still be fair use, you know, reviewers and critics have careers.
976220	982940	Now the reason why monetizing your content can work against fair use isn't because, like,
982940	987380	it's, you know, commercial and nonprofits are better or more moral or something.
987380	991740	It has to do with the market for the original copyrighted material.
991740	997640	The standard when you make money off of someone else's copyrighted material is does this substitute
997640	1000260	or destroy the original market?
1000260	1006200	And a YouTube video about a court case isn't going to substitute the market for erotica.
1006200	1009120	Does my monetizing this content destroy her market?
1009120	1011040	And the answer is obviously no.
1011040	1014560	The only way you could argue that I would harm the market is if I made the book look
1014560	1020080	bad by saying it's bad and that's fair use.
1020080	1022240	There's nothing you can do about that.
1022240	1027120	Criticism does not count as destroying the market, uh, even though I didn't actually
1027120	1028880	criticize her dumb book.
1028880	1033960	But while we're on this subject, I did have some empathy for Addison Cain before the video
1033960	1041640	went up because as a New York Times bestselling author, I do actually know what it's like
1041640	1045760	for people to shit on your book and monetize them shitting on your book.
1045760	1049660	I know what it's like for some of these people to shit on your book while getting tens of
1049660	1050980	thousands of views.
1050980	1054480	And if you want to go outside the book stuff, I know what it's like for a lot of people
1054480	1060440	to personally target me to the tune of hundreds of thousands, if not millions of views.
1060440	1061840	It sucks.
1061840	1063840	It really fucking sucks.
1063840	1069480	But here's the thing, it's not copyright infringement and technically it's not illegal.
1069480	1073920	I can't really even claim that it's defamation, which is ironic because every time one of
1073920	1077920	those dipshits videos get taken down, they think I did it like I've even fucking watched
1077920	1078920	any of them.
1078920	1080920	No one cares about your response video, Gary.
1080920	1081920	But that is the thing.
1081920	1086320	People can monetize themselves saying shit about you that you don't like.
1086320	1090640	And if you're a public figure, there is not a lot you can do about it unless they say
1090640	1094320	something that is objectively, patently untrue.
1094320	1096320	And even then, it's still an uphill battle.
1096320	1097320	Sucks, huh?
1097320	1108680	So as I said, no, I did not actually think that the subject of a video that I made about
1108680	1116520	a person known for making bad faith DMCA takedown notices would make a bad faith takedown DMCA
1117520	1124520	but I don't know, maybe there's, I don't know, there's some, I feel like there's a term for
1124520	1125520	this.
1125520	1126520	Some sort of effect.
1126520	1133520	I just, I don't know, I've been listening to the wavy word of the mind.
1133520	1136400	Okay, let's look at the allegations.
1136400	1141440	That my client claimed to own tropes and that was what the DMCA's at issue were about.
1141440	1142440	No I didn't.
1142440	1145400	Two, that my client blackmailed Zoe Ellis.
1145400	1148920	Wow, no, no I didn't even a little bit allege that.
1148920	1150360	I don't know where the hell you got that.
1150360	1153920	That Miss Kane's publisher settled due to Miss Kane's perjury in Oklahoma.
1153920	1158800	Yeah, about the perjury thing, I guess you could say I implied it, but I didn't say it.
1158800	1165320	I did say what actually did happen was that the plaintiff accused Kane of perjuring herself
1165320	1170400	and then three days later, a judgment was filed by the court.
1170400	1173040	And this was one mistake I did make.
1173040	1175440	You see, there was no settlement.
1175440	1176940	It was not a settlement.
1176940	1177940	It was a judgment.
1177940	1182960	A judgment is an official designation that is entered on a court's docket that designates
1182960	1189000	that a plaintiff has prevailed against the defendant in a court case.
1189000	1194720	Plaintiff in the Oklahoma case, Quill Inc.'s books, prevailed over the defendant blushing
1194720	1195720	books.
1195720	1197520	There was no settlement.
1197520	1199080	That was my mistake.
1199080	1201440	Sorry, Addison.
1201440	1205560	But the other lawsuits in Virginia died for unrelated reasons.
1205560	1208400	It did close for unrelated reasons.
1208400	1215000	The Oklahoma case was closed after blushing books, admitting wrongdoing, and the Virginia
1215000	1219480	case was closed for lack of prosecution.
1219480	1220880	These things had nothing to do with each other.
1220880	1222640	They were completely unrelated.
1222640	1228720	But one thing I have not really touched on yet is the letter that Tanya Watson had sent
1228720	1229720	to Patreon.
1230120	1231880	To whom it may concern.
1231880	1234160	My firm represents Addison Cain.
1234160	1236360	Miss Cain is a well-known author.
1236360	1238200	Recently, one of your users posted co-
1238200	1239200	Okay, here's the thing.
1239200	1243640	It's not substantive enough to be, like, you know, fun to read the way the other one was,
1243640	1245040	so I'm just gonna break it down.
1245040	1249200	Due to the content, my client has received hate mail and attacks on social media.
1249200	1253800	I have a good faith belief that the material I am reporting is not authorized by the copyright
1253800	1256400	owner, an agent of the owner, or the law.
1256600	1261000	If you really do have a good faith belief that this is copyright infringement, I find
1261000	1267040	it interesting that you would mention defamation or harassment at all, because those things
1267040	1272320	do not have anything to do with whether or not my use of the 400 words of Born to be
1272320	1274640	Bound was copyright infringement.
1274640	1280120	Lens v. Universal Music Corp. 2016, the fair use of a copyrighted work for purposes such
1280120	1286520	as criticism, comment, news reporting, or teaching is not an infringement, and is therefore
1286520	1288640	wholly authorized by the law.
1288640	1293240	Recently, one of your users posted content that includes excerpts of my client's work
1293240	1297640	that were posted without her permission, along with numerous false claims and defamatory
1297640	1298880	statements.
1298880	1300260	It does not work like that.
1300260	1304400	You hurt my feelings, ipso facto copyright infringement.
1304400	1307240	That's not how copyright works.
1307240	1312040	Copyright infringement is infringement whether your feelings are hurt or not.
1312040	1319640	I actually kind of like this wolf hat.
1319640	1321200	I'm like, I'm going to start wearing this.
1321200	1322200	It's got pockets.
1322200	1324760	None of my clothes do.
1324760	1325760	Paws.
1325760	1328640	Furry solidarity.
1328640	1331800	So that's just me, but what about everybody else?
1331800	1336600	What about the other, um, I don't want to say victims, targets of Addison Cain's disdain,
1336960	1337960	shall we say?
1337960	1341600	Well, first and most obvious is Zoe Ellis, who filed the original lawsuit, who alleges
1341600	1349000	that Cain's publisher at the direction of Cain filed dozens of DMCA takedown notices.
1349000	1350800	Is that specific enough for you?
1350800	1354720	I mean, she does also allege that Cain herself sent some of them, but we're keeping it simple.
1354720	1359920	But that wasn't all there was to it when we're talking about the defamation side of the lawsuit.
1359920	1365040	Basically, Ellis also alleges that Cain spent a lot of time and effort shit-talking her
1365040	1366040	to the community.
1366040	1370600	And since we're talking about self-published erotica, authors kind of live and die a lot
1370600	1373800	more on networking than they do on the traditional side.
1373800	1377240	And so if Addison Cain is running around in all these like Omegaverse Facebook groups
1377240	1384160	saying like, hey, this woman is plagiarizing me, that's kind of a bad look for the accused.
1384160	1388720	Then there is an author, Nora Ashe, who was an early proponent of Zoe Ellis when she was
1388720	1390800	first entering authoredom.
1390800	1393960	And this is another mistake slash redaction I need to make.
1393960	1400360	Patricia Briggs, who I said was the first Omegaverse author, was not actually that.
1400360	1403520	She wrote kind of werewolfy stuff.
1403520	1407360	You know, there was like some, obviously it was called Alpha and Omega, but like it didn't
1407360	1412200	have most of the tropes that we associate with ABO.
1412200	1419320	The first hit commercial Omegaverse author was Nora Ashe, not Addison Cain.
1419320	1424480	Part of her crime was being an early champion of Zoe Ellis, but another part of it was the
1424480	1431600	fact that she repeatedly pointed out that she was the first commercially published Omegaverse
1431600	1432600	hit author.
1432600	1437200	God, this is like, the specificity is really important in the erotica wars, okay?
1437200	1442160	Anyway, Nora Ashe alleges that Cain also threw her clout around to damage her brand within
1442160	1443240	the author community.
1443240	1444380	And then there's Lee Savino.
1444380	1447040	And now we're getting into like the really wild shit.
1447040	1449040	Lee Savino does not write ABO.
1449040	1454280	She's more in the vein of dark werewolfy romance sort of thing.
1454280	1457760	Also a former friend of Addison Cain, as so many of these women are.
1457760	1463040	And I'm not exactly clear on when Addison Cain decided that Lee Savino was actually
1463040	1467520	in the enemy's camp, in this grand conspiracy against her.
1467520	1472880	But the long and short is that Cain decided that Lee Savino knew damning things about
1472880	1475500	Zoe Ellis and Nora Ashe.
1475500	1480940	And so she subpoenaed Lee Savino in her counterclaim in the Virginia lawsuit.
1480940	1484260	So you remember how earlier I mentioned that she didn't say anything about my video, but
1484260	1487620	instead redirected her ire to another author?
1487620	1490780	Well, this is that author, and here's what she said.
1490780	1495580	It is extremely expensive to subpoena someone in a lawsuit.
1495580	1501780	Myself and my reputable attorneys would never do so frivolously or vindictively.
1502100	1507340	Regrettably, we were forced to subpoena Lee Savino because she has in her possession highly
1507340	1511340	relevant information to the lawsuit brought against me.
1511340	1513580	There is a reason she was subpoenaed.
1513580	1518780	She and I are both aware of it, and if she continues to make inflammatory statements
1518780	1522820	against my character, I will make what I know public.
1522820	1528220	Thing is, I do have a copy of that subpoena, and I have absolutely no problem making public
1528220	1530580	what she thinks is such a big deal.
1530820	1535460	Of course, it was like long-winding conspiratorial nonsense, but the long and short is that she
1535460	1542900	demanded that Lee Savino produce all documents relating to Margarita Cole, Eva Dresden, and
1542900	1549060	remember those names, we'll get to them, Addison Cain, Zoe Ellis, and Nora Ash.
1549060	1553300	The latter two, again, are both in the UK and are harder to get information on.
1553300	1554660	Oh, but that's not all.
1554660	1560380	Lee Savino is also a plagiarist, but she didn't copy a plot.
1560380	1562900	She copied a, uh, character.
1562900	1567420	So here's part of the letter that Tammy Watson sent Lee Savino when they were forced to drop
1567420	1569340	the counterclaim in Virginia.
1569340	1573900	We are writing to inform you that my client has decided to move to dismiss her counterclaim
1573900	1576060	in the above-referenced lawsuit.
1576060	1580260	My client wishes to put these matters behind her and would appreciate if your client would
1580260	1585180	either return the witch character at issue and remove her from Miss Savino's Berserker
1585180	1586180	series.
1586180	1587180	Return the witch!
1587580	1591900	Considering the history and Miss Savino's use of my client's character, we request that
1591900	1597060	Miss Cain's books are no longer used as the inspiration for ghostwriters to emulate.
1597060	1600660	Like I cannot read her mind, I don't know what's in her heart, but according to her,
1600660	1605540	this is a character she's been writing for like 10 years and she has no idea where Cain
1605540	1610620	decided that this character and this character alone was plagiarized from one of Cain's books.
1610620	1616020	Oh, and Addison Cain also accused Savino of reporting her Facebook ads to Facebook as
1616140	1617140	being inappropriate.
1617140	1620860	Huge, if true.
1620860	1625780	Then there's author Ava Dresden, also an author in this community, also subpoenaed in the
1625780	1631180	Virginia case, basically the exact same shit, like give me dirt on this, this, this, and
1631180	1632180	this person.
1632180	1636420	So Dresden takes this seriously and has to hire a lawyer and ends up spending a ton of
1636420	1644980	money on this whole nonsense thing only to have Cain drop the subpoena when Quill gets
1644980	1648060	dismissed from the Virginia case for lack of prosecution.
1648060	1653940	Courtney Milan is not an Omegaverse author, but is fairly well known in the more traditional
1653940	1655660	historical romance community.
1655660	1660780	And so Milan basically got involved in this when someone reached out to her like, hey,
1660780	1664220	you're a lawyer, what do you think of this whole thing?
1664220	1668740	And Milan looked at it and she opined on Twitter basically that she thought Cain was in the
1668740	1673460	wrong and this is obviously not plagiarism, it's just too broad, it's too tropey, this
1673460	1675900	is sans affair, this is not how plagiarism works.
1675900	1681380	And so Milan, a person that Cain has never really interacted with or talked to, is now
1681380	1685260	also on the list of eternity vengeance quest.
1685260	1690260	Here she is harassing Milan on Twitter, here she is dragging Milan on her personal Facebook.
1690260	1694340	I have been one of Courtney Milan's favorite punching bags over the years.
1694340	1695340	Why?
1695340	1697260	In the beginning, I didn't know.
1697260	1701740	I still don't know why she was comfortable saying the things she said without any form
1701740	1708060	of proof or taking the time to afford a fellow human the courtesy of due diligence.
1708060	1713980	Authors are afraid of Courtney Milan, and I understand why better than most.
1713980	1719680	To all the others she has bullied without respecting the community and seeking fact,
1719680	1722020	I am so sorry.
1722020	1729300	I know what it feels like to be trampled, ignored, and attacked for sport, but we don't
1729300	1731500	need to be afraid of bullies.
1731500	1733380	Not when we have each other.
1733380	1737740	Not when we have kindness and the support of a community we love.
1737740	1741060	Not when we have THE TRUTH.
1741060	1742180	Hashtag RWA.
1742180	1744100	Hashtag stand up to bullying.
1744100	1747220	Here's Toni Watson mentioning her in her letter to me.
1747220	1752940	The previous lies and inaccuracies spread by Quill, Zoe Ellis, Courtney Milan, and others.
1752940	1758020	And here is the formal ethics complaint Cain filed against Courtney Milan with the Romance
1758020	1759820	Writers of America.
1759820	1764940	Formal Ethics Complaint against Courtney Milan to Romance Writers of America.
1764940	1772100	To whom it may concern, I have recently learned that Courtney Milan serves on the RWA Ethics
1772100	1773100	Committee.
1773100	1778620	The high level of trust authors must place in the RWA to operate with integrity leads
1778620	1784860	me to file this complaint against Ms. Milan for poor and unethical behavior.
1784860	1790860	On March 12, 2019, Courtney Milan posted statements about me and a lawsuit against
1790860	1799380	me to her 37.9k Twitter followers after I was sent to her by the RWA for assistance.
1799380	1805380	These posts were not based on fact or evidence, but merely on the allegations in a lawsuit
1805380	1807860	which had just been initiated.
1807860	1812900	And as someone who markets herself as a legal expert, she did not take the time to research
1812900	1815780	the allegations she recklessly tweeted.
1815780	1821300	Thanks to Courtney's carelessness, unsubstantiated slander was spread to the point I received
1821300	1829300	threatening messages.
1829300	1835140	After her tweets, many members of the community I loved and dedicated readers turned on me,
1835140	1839260	taking her factually unsupported posts at face value.
1839260	1844580	Once again, I request RWA sanction Courtney Milan and remove her from the Ethics Board
1844580	1847260	and any affiliation with RWA.
1847260	1852060	Sincerely, Addison Cain, Membership ID 31817.
1852060	1854820	Is there no manager she won't complain to?
1854820	1859500	To be clear, all of this sturm und drang is because Courtney Milan, who has a pretty solid
1859500	1866300	base of legal knowledge, expressed an opinion about the court case on Twitter.com.
1867300	1870500	She never said anything about Cain as a person.
1870500	1877220	So what's funny to me about this Twitter exchange is that Milan, despite having a law degree,
1877220	1882820	can't really understand what's going on because she's not a barred lawyer, meaning she's not
1882820	1890620	practicing, but Addison Cain, who thinks monetizing content exempts it from fair use, is the legalist
1890620	1892100	expert that ever legaled.
1892100	1896000	Oh, but one other funny thing that happened just as I was editing this is I got an email
1896000	1901360	from Courtney Milan saying, hey, I actually remembered who it was that originally reached
1901360	1904400	out to me about the Omegaverse lawsuit.
1904400	1907960	And wouldn't you know, it was Addison Cain.
1907960	1911080	Well, that backfired.
1911080	1912280	Margarita Cole.
1912280	1914280	This is Zoe Ellis's lawyer.
1914280	1919840	Now Cole is a lawyer that represents a lot of authors in like IP and like rights and
1919840	1920840	stuff.
1920840	1924080	She's like that kind of lawyer, formerly a bankruptcy lawyer.
1924080	1925900	This comes into it, believe it or not.
1925900	1930540	Now, according to Cole, she originally got involved with Zoe Ellis by getting onto one
1930540	1932300	of her mailing lists.
1932300	1935180	And then eventually they started talking about rights and stuff.
1935180	1938900	Then Zoe Ellis reached out to her whenever she started getting all these DMCA takedown
1938900	1939900	notices.
1939900	1944260	Now I bring this whole up because Cain has repeatedly alleged that Margarita Cole has
1944260	1950840	had like this weird, obsessive vendetta against Addison Cain for years, saw an opportunity
1950840	1956800	with Zoe Ellis and all these DMCA takedowns and is therefore the mastermind of this whole
1956800	1957800	thing.
1957800	1961200	And kind of like Milan, she's does the thing where she's like, well, you're a bankruptcy
1961200	1962200	lawyer.
1962200	1965780	How can you possibly know about copyright infringement?
1965780	1970840	And this is kind of a running theme with Cain's aspersions against people.
1970840	1977240	Like Milan isn't barred, therefore she cannot opine on the whole case unless it's in favor
1977240	1978480	of Cain.
1978480	1983120	And Margarita Cole doesn't know what she's doing because she was a bankruptcy lawyer
1983120	1986960	at some point in history, even though she's not anymore.
1986960	1989540	Oh, but that's not all.
1989540	1995760	Blushing Books and Addison Cain alleges Margarita Cole, covering my ass, has filed three bar
1995760	1999040	complaints against this woman over the last two years.
1999040	2003680	And I know I have to say alleged to cover my ass, but like I do have a copy of one of
2003680	2008600	these bar complaints and it was Blushing that filed it and it was during the freaking
2008600	2009600	lawsuit.
2009600	2015840	So they filed a bar complaint against an opposing lawyer as ongoing litigation was happening.
2015840	2018840	Ethics.
2018840	2022080	And again, it is this sort of conspiracy, like she read an art she didn't like and she's
2022080	2025240	been trying to take down Addison Cain for years.
2025240	2030520	And also she's got like 80 sock puppets and here are examples of all of them, ergo bar
2030520	2031520	complaint.
2031520	2040720	And again, according to Cole, a new bar complaint was filed by Addison Cain on August 26, 2020.
2040720	2042040	Less than two months ago.
2042040	2045880	And finally, surprisingly, Blushing Books.
2045880	2051760	So Blushing has alleged that Addison Cain was the person who reported them to the RWA
2051760	2055040	and is therefore the reason they are on advocacy alert.
2055040	2059520	Now we reached out to the RWA to confirm that and they declined to comment because they
2059520	2061420	don't give names for that sort of thing.
2061420	2068060	But based on an email that Blushing sent to Courtney Milan, the only romance lawyer,
2068060	2069540	they do believe it was Cain.
2069540	2074220	And of course, Cain made all sorts of wild allegations against Blushing, including like
2074220	2077620	book burning and breach of contract, bit, bit, bit, bit, bit.
2077620	2091340	How many of you have ever felt personally victimized by Regina George?
2091340	2093260	So why bring all of this up?
2093260	2098540	Well, originally, this video was meant to be sort of a learning experience about copyright.
2098540	2102180	But obviously this isn't about copyright.
2102180	2106060	Some people just want other people to shut up.
2106060	2109700	And sometimes she uses copyright law to do it.
2109700	2114620	But most of the time she doesn't like the way she uses this word defamation just so
2114620	2115620	eagerly.
2115620	2122020	I'm reminded of the way that El Presidente is just so eager to expand libel laws in the
2122020	2124700	US to be like the ones in the UK.
2124700	2127500	So really, this isn't even about copyright law anymore.
2127500	2128860	And it never was.
2128860	2130500	It's about deplatforming.
2130500	2131980	Cain has people she doesn't like.
2131980	2134420	She wants to deplatform them.
2134420	2137260	Just sometimes she uses the DMCA to do it.
2137260	2141980	And I think this is really interesting because while I think she's wrong and is definitely
2141980	2147780	abusing systems that are in place to protect people, it does kinda highlight a major problem,
2147780	2150860	which is that platforms don't really care about abuse.
2150860	2152500	They don't care about harassment.
2152500	2156820	And before you go there Addison, no, by no meaningful definition, legal or ethical, does
2156820	2159900	this count as defamation, abuse, or harassment.
2159900	2160900	Dammit.
2160900	2164940	However, as someone who has multiple times been on the wrong side of coordinated harassment
2164940	2169820	campaigns and is also friends with people who have gone through way, way worse, including
2169860	2176300	having to move, sometimes move cities, I feel like I can say with some certainty that platforms
2176300	2177820	don't take harassment seriously.
2177820	2180220	But you know what they do take seriously?
2180220	2181540	Copyright.
2181540	2186820	As if for instance, here again we have the President of the United States sharing a bad
2186820	2189260	meme using Nickelback's photograph.
2189260	2193820	Well Nickelback was successful in getting that tweet taken down because they filed a
2193820	2194820	DMCA takedown.
2194820	2201140	Similarly, there are examples of counter-protesters blasting copyrighted music at alt-right rallies
2201140	2206340	so it can't get uploaded in its raw form and will also therefore be taken down.
2206340	2210980	Which, while effective, also swings in the other direction because counter-protesters
2210980	2216540	have been known to do that to, for instance, BLM using the exact same tactic.
2216540	2221700	The pendulum swings both ways, and even in the Nickelback case, while ethically good
2221700	2227460	for them, I honestly don't think that counts as copyright infringement.
2227460	2234820	It's a dumb shitty meme, but I think that, personally, it's transformative enough that
2234820	2236860	it would count as fair use.
2236860	2241940	If it were taken to court, oh god, I'm imagining that, no, please, no.
2241940	2246100	So it really is no wonder that there are people who feel like copyright law and the DMCA is
2246100	2249780	a perfectly valid way to suppress speech they don't like.
2249780	2254820	Both Addison Cain and her lawyer, Shania Watson, say as much in their DMCA complaints.
2254820	2258900	And neither Addison nor her lawyer seem to care that it doesn't matter why you want the
2258900	2261740	infringing material taken down.
2261740	2267700	Copyright exists to protect your share of the market, not to protect you from defamation
2267700	2270420	or things that might make you look bad.
2270420	2280020	Hey, Angelina, what the hell is taking so long with this edit?
2280020	2284940	Yeah, uh, sorry, sorry, um, I've just been so busy with my damn baby that it's just starting
2284940	2286020	to take over my brain.
2286020	2289420	It's like how you can't call your damn baby a damn baby unless you are, like, the most
2289420	2292900	wretched person in the world, and not like you're a mom who's constantly overloaded with
2292900	2296620	a toddler who's screaming for you nonstop, and the fact that you just want to call her
2296620	2300820	a damn baby to your friends over a glass of wine doesn't necessarily make you a bad
2300820	2301820	person.
2301820	2303820	Ah, you're always going on about your damn baby.
2303820	2309820	Yeah, yeah, of course, I won't say anything else about the damn baby, DAMN BABY!
2309820	2310820	Ugh, damn baby.
2310820	2313780	Well, of course this wasn't the end of it.
2313780	2319180	EFF did decide to take me on, so they sent a letter to Tomi Watson explaining why all
2319180	2324900	of the stuff in her letter was wrong, and, um, I don't know, I kind of genuinely did
2324900	2331380	think that would be the end of it, like I didn't think, uh, I didn't think they'd respond.
2331380	2332380	But they did.
2332380	2338500	Um, so yeah, let's, uh, let's see what they said.
2338500	2343900	As your organization, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, EFF, is a close partner with the
2343900	2349500	Organization for Transformative Works, OTW, and was clearly working with Lindsay Ellis
2349500	2356180	on the video, the EFF is aware that for over two years, my client, Addison Cain, Ms. Cain,
2356180	2360780	has been involved in two lawsuits in which the plaintiff, Quill Inc. Books Ltd., was
2360780	2363740	supported by the OTW.
2363740	2374300	OT... the people who own AO3, the fanfiction website?
2374300	2378260	Regardless of what really happened during the two lawsuits, it is clear that you and
2378260	2383460	your clients were intent on spreading false allegations and outright lies about my clients
2383460	2388900	and the litigation in the monetized video, which the EFF received a portion of the proceeds
2388900	2389900	to help produce.
2389900	2394940	Ms. Ellis could have easily condensed use of Ms. Cain's book into a few paragraphs for
2394940	2400420	illustration instead of reading from the book for over two minutes.
2400420	2404340	How... how long do you think it takes to read a few paragraphs?
2404340	2405340	Like...
2406140	2411180	Zoe Ellis and her attorneys utilized numerous methods to obtain their objective to spear
2411180	2416820	Ms. Cain's name, but one common denominator has been their utilization of the OTW, of
2416820	2418820	which the EFF is a close partner.
2418820	2423820	It is our opinion that defamation exists, and because the EFF worked in collusion with
2423820	2429120	Lindsay Ellis to create the monetized video, the EFF is also culpable for the copyright
2429120	2431100	infringement and the defamation.
2431100	2435780	Lindsay Ellis goes on to further claim the EFF is the leading non-profit defending digital
2435780	2436780	privacy.
2436780	2442380	However, the relationship between the EFF and the OTW in this instance makes that statement
2442380	2444060	shaky at best.
2444060	2448620	The OTW previously partnered with Zoe Ellis and her agents, who went to great lengths
2448620	2453860	to expose my client's real name, home address, and photos of her child in relation to her
2453860	2458780	real name and home address, which is the opposite of digital privacy.
2458780	2464260	The tie between OTW and the EFF, and the history of abuse my client has faced the last
2464260	2470220	two years, makes the use of Lindsay Ellis, a YouTube-slash-Patreon personality with public
2470220	2476340	sway, suspicious in the least, particularly when you assisted in the creation of a monetized
2476340	2481940	video where both the EFF and Lindsay Ellis could profit off copyright infringement and
2481940	2482940	defamation.
2482940	2488740	As you are clearly aware, the fair use doctrine is highly subjective, and we find your analysis
2488740	2493340	of Ms. Ellis' use of Ms. Kane's book erroneous and incomplete.
2493340	2499940	As your client is unaware of legal procedure, she must also not understand that simply because
2499940	2505140	a motion-slash-complaint was filed in court does not mean the statement is true.
2505140	2510020	However, there is no excuse for your lack of due diligence on this topic.
2510020	2515340	Ms. Ellis clearly creates her videos and publishes them on YouTube and Patreon for profit, and
2515340	2520780	the EFF profited as well in this case, a factor that strongly cuts against your fair
2520780	2522100	use argument.
2522100	2526820	As a direct result of the video, see Exhibit 1 showing evidence of a Twitter user who states
2526820	2529660	that he gave a one-star review to my client's book.
2529660	2534460	God damn it, you fucking asshole.
2534460	2540380	Despite my client's current public silence regarding Lindsay Ellis, her ongoing accusations,
2540380	2546420	the defaming video, and verbal attacks of her child, your client has gone to great lengths
2546420	2550900	to continue to spread baseless accusations and misinformation.
2550900	2556660	Regardless of this failure, it is clear that the EFF, through Lindsay Ellis, is now attempting
2556660	2562780	to drag the battle's corpses over the finish line by making a defamatory video and misleading
2562780	2569140	the public about your agenda, using a legally ignorant layman to do your dirty work in exchange
2569180	2570820	for donations.
2570820	2575900	We request a public apology from both the EFF and Lindsay Ellis for knowingly spreading
2575900	2578420	false information for profit.
2578420	2583820	And finally, we request that Lindsay Ellis and the EFF donate all proceeds made from
2583820	2590820	the defaming video to the anti-bully charity, KindCampaign.com.
2591500	2600500	It's the champagne of beers.
2600500	2604420	Oh my god, I can't believe I even need to say this.
2604420	2612460	Neither EFF nor OTW had anything to do with the production of that video.
2612460	2613900	No collusion.
2613900	2618700	To date, I have not made a donation to EFF, especially since the damn video is demonetized.
2618700	2623660	I only chose EFF because they were a non-profit that was irrelevant to the topics of the court
2623660	2624660	case.
2624660	2629900	But Jesus Christ, the moon logic of bringing the OTW into this, like, I don't even have
2629900	2631340	an AO3 account.
2631340	2635060	I have no contact or affiliation with OTW.
2635060	2639420	I did reach out to them about this video and they left me on read.
2639420	2645260	The only connection I have with OTW is I wrote one article for them earlier this year when
2645260	2650540	my book came out that nobody read and I lost a Hugo to them last year.
2650540	2653980	For best related work.
2653980	2656100	You guys deserve to win the Hugo, it's fine.
2656100	2662540	But the moon logic of even connecting OTW to this case is that Ellis' lawyers hired
2662540	2669740	Christina Busey as their expert witness on the topic of fanfiction and she happens to
2669740	2676980	be on the board of OTW.
2676980	2682700	So this letter definitely does fall into a pattern with regard to people and lawyers,
2682700	2687700	which is, you know what, the actual client, they're just dupes.
2687700	2689340	They're ignorant laymen.
2689340	2693620	You know, we attack the lawyers who are the real masterminds.
2693620	2699380	In this case, the fact that the EFF has worked with OTW before on completely unrelated things
2699540	2704340	means that there is a fanfiction deep state keen on taking Addison Cain down.
2704340	2708580	Pepe Sylvia, Pepe Sylvia, I looked in the mail, well this whole box is Pepe Sylvia!
2708580	2713260	Well your claim that I am a legally ignorant layman kind of works against all that stuff
2713260	2717420	that you're so mad about because clearly I don't know what I'm talking about.
2717420	2722620	My opinions, as expressed in the video, were good faith interpretations of the facts that
2722620	2724900	I had as I understood them.
2724900	2729060	And I may not have a law degree, but I do have a little tool you may not have heard
2729060	2730060	of.
2730060	2731980	It's called Goomba.
2731980	2737900	And to claim defamation against a public figure like Addison Cain, you have to show actual
2737900	2744580	malice that you published with either knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth,
2744580	2745940	which I did not.
2745940	2750940	But a lot of the stuff that Addison and her lawyer Taylee are so mad about, well, I got
2750940	2755620	my interpretation of it actually from lawyers, but not lawyers that I know.
2755620	2759020	It's from a podcast called All Lawyers Are Bad.
2759020	2764700	He serves a series of requests for admission, including a key one, which is admit that Cain
2764700	2772460	misrepresented her involvement with the filing of the DMCA takedown notices against Zoe Ellis.
2772460	2775980	And the response was, admit it.
2775980	2782420	Cain was willing to lie her ass off, but the lawyers representing her confronted with
2782420	2788620	this request to admit did not, and they admitted that in fact she lied, and that she had been
2788620	2792580	entirely involved in the DMCA's issued into Oklahoma.
2792580	2796060	Turn down for what?
2796060	2799700	And they read out loud about as much copyrighted material as I did.
2799700	2805500	It was necessary, and it will only be beneficial to you if, in your coming estrous cycle, you
2805500	2807060	should conceal it.
2807060	2811100	And they were also a lot harsher, going so far as to call Cain things like,
2811100	2812940	To the profiteering shitheads.
2812940	2816580	They also use her real name a lot, which I never did.
2816580	2823220	So I wonder, why did they never get a DMCA takedown notice or emails from her lawyer?
2823220	2824220	Tell me.
2824220	2828140	Because if she's attractive, I'm gonna do everything I can to try to make her case.
2828140	2832580	I have to say, she's, I'm not gonna, I'm just gonna come out, she's hot.
2832580	2833580	Uh-huh.
2834580	2836340	I guess that'll do it.
2836340	2837340	Maybe I should have called her hot.
2837340	2839300	Well then again, I don't think that would have saved me.
2839300	2845300	It does not escape my notice that every single person that Cain has allegedly targeted is
2845300	2846300	a woman.
2846300	2850540	Poetic, that the charity she wants me to donate to is anti-girl-on-girl bullying.
2850540	2853900	But wait, you say, maybe she didn't even know about this podcast.
2853900	2856980	Oh no, mon frere, she did.
2856980	2861220	And something that one of the guys in the podcast said inspired her to commission fan
2861220	2865340	art of herself, drinking the blood of her enemies.
2865340	2874260	Yeah, you know, I'm just having a normal one, sitting on my throne of bones, drinking
2874260	2882060	the blood of my enemies.
2882060	2885020	Drinking the blood of her enemies, but she's the bullied one.
2885020	2886500	Hashtag stand up to bullying.
2886500	2891100	And then we get to this anti-bullying charity at the end, where it's like trying to gaslight
2891100	2896660	people into believing that they are the bullies, and that they are the ones with behavior that
2896660	2897900	needs to be atoned for.
2897900	2899340	I can't be a bully.
2899340	2902540	I simply am the person demanding that you be better.
2902540	2905420	All of those other people making accusations against me?
2905420	2907540	Well, they were not the bullied ones.
2907540	2909220	I was the bullied one.
2909220	2910700	They were the bullies.
2910700	2914500	Any action I took against them, I had to take it.
2914500	2918940	It's totally normal that there are so many of them and they all kinda have the same story.
2918980	2924860	And you ever notice how people who crow about victimhood the loudest tend to be bullies themselves?
2924860	2930260	Now that said, I did make a couple hundred dollars off of it before it got demonetized.
2930260	2934660	So as a gesture of good faith, I went ahead and donated the money that would have gone
2934660	2940060	to EFF to the Kind campaign.
2940060	2941260	Are we square?
2941260	2943780	And I don't want this to be the Addison Cain drama channel.
2943780	2948140	I genuinely hope this is the last video I make on the subject.
2948140	2950700	By which I mean I hope we don't go to court.
2950700	2954340	That said, it is petty fandom bullshit, but it does real harm.
2954340	2959620	In the great Regina George tradition, this does have impact on people's lives.
2959620	2963500	Every single author that I talk to, except Courtney Milan, said that their careers have
2963500	2970860	been harmed by everything Addison Cain has done, from DMCA on to petty fandom bullshit.
2970860	2976220	Now that said, to reiterate myself, don't harass her, goddammit.
2976220	2981140	She blames me for every single one of you idiots that are shitty to her on social media.
2981140	2987100	I understand the energy needing to go somewhere, where a quarantine and public shaming is fun.
2987100	2991160	But if you really want to piss her off, instead of being an asshole on Twitter, support the
2991160	2993260	authors that she has targeted.
2993260	2997580	I was really glib about the whole erotica thing in the first video, and I kind of would
2997580	2999140	like to backtrack that.
2999140	3003300	Erotica is a real legit genre, and if you're into it, go check them out.
3003300	3004860	Most of it's ABO.
3004860	3006420	Not for me.
3006420	3008940	But it might be for you.
3008940	3009940	Awoooooo.
3009940	3012740	Outside of that, there is Courtney Milan.
3012740	3016940	She just had a book come out that features an Asian hero, and that's something you'd
3016940	3022940	never see in the US in a traditional romance publishing, so go check her out.
3022940	3027860	And when I said I'm gonna milk the shit out of this, what of course I meant was merchandise.
3027860	3029580	And no, I don't actually mean this shirt.
3029580	3031060	You can't buy this.
3031380	3036820	Elisa, the comment matriarch, has been crafty lately, so she made this for me and a few
3036820	3038740	friends as a joke.
3038740	3041780	But there is some stuff you can buy.
3041780	3045660	And our good friends at DFTBA were super down with it.
3045660	3050300	We of course were very inspired by Lindsay Ellis' A Menace, so came up with a Saul Bass
3050300	3052620	inspired embossed pen you can get.
3052620	3056260	I'd also love to thank Tammy Watson for coming up with this idea of the fan fiction
3056260	3057260	deep state.
3057260	3058740	Just loves it.
3058740	3064420	Not a direct reference per se, but we were definitely inspired by the myth of the Karen,
3064420	3066180	let's say.
3066180	3069420	And finally, my personal favorite, the With Prejudice hat.
3069420	3071340	Buy it for the lawyer in your life.
3071340	3073620	They don't need to know the context.
3073620	3076380	And if you do know the context, it's very funny.
3076380	3081420	So enjoy our dumb merch, and join the hashtag fan fiction deep state.
3081420	3083100	One last thing before we go.
3083460	3089060	Patreon is a membership service, and my patrons are charged not by the content unit, but by
3089060	3090060	the month.
3090060	3093580	So if someone wanted to get into the weeds of monetization, they should understand that
3093580	3100420	people who give money to my Patreon are effectively paying for membership to me, which includes
3100420	3102940	certain perks, i.e. name in credits.
3102940	3108380	They are not paying for the content itself, they are in effect paying membership dues.
3108940	3114060	And ain't no ads on this video, so it is going unmonetized.
3114060	3118580	And while we're here, I'd like to thank the fine folks at Patreon for supporting creators,
3118580	3125420	standing up for fair use, and for being all around a bunch of really solid menches.
3125420	3126220	Thanks for watching.
3199380	3203380	Which is the opposite of digital privacy.
3203380	3204380	Wow.
