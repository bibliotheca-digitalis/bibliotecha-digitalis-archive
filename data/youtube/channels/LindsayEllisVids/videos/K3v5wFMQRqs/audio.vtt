00:00.000 --> 00:08.660
Miss Ellis, my firm represents Addison Cain.

00:08.660 --> 00:12.760
We are aware of your recent YouTube video and other postings related to lawsuits involving

00:12.760 --> 00:13.760
my client.

00:13.760 --> 00:18.760
In your video, you used my client's copyrighted content and made numerous false claims including

00:18.760 --> 00:24.440
statements from allegations made in the lawsuits that were not based on evidence or facts.

00:24.440 --> 00:26.920
These false statements include the following allegations.

00:26.920 --> 00:33.080
1. That my client claimed to own tropes and that was what the DMCA's at issue were about.

00:33.080 --> 00:36.360
2. That my client blackmailed Zoe Ellis.

00:36.360 --> 00:41.240
3. That Miss Cain's publisher settled due to Miss Cain's perjury in Oklahoma.

00:41.240 --> 00:47.360
4. That Miss Cain committed perjury and 5. That the other lawsuits in Virginia died for

00:47.360 --> 00:49.120
unrelated reasons.

00:49.120 --> 00:52.120
These statements are entirely false and defamatory.

00:52.120 --> 00:56.880
No proof was ever provided by Miss Ellis or her company in the lawsuits about any of these

00:56.880 --> 00:57.880
issues.

00:57.880 --> 01:01.440
While my client was accused of perjury by Miss Ellis' company, the basis of that claim

01:01.440 --> 01:06.800
was never argued before court and Miss Cain never misrepresented any facts to the court.

01:06.800 --> 01:13.340
Her previous publisher filed the DMCA's and no DMCA's were sent by Miss Cain to Oklahoma.

01:13.340 --> 01:17.680
An accurate account of the various lawsuits may be viewed on my client's Facebook page

01:17.680 --> 01:21.960
if you are interested in a factual account instead of spreading the previous lies and

01:21.960 --> 01:26.760
inaccuracies spread by Quill, Zoe Ellis, Courtney Milan and others.

01:26.760 --> 01:31.160
We believe that your video violates the terms and services of your Patreon account as it

01:31.160 --> 01:34.440
clearly includes abusive content and uses my client's content.

01:34.440 --> 01:38.680
My client is currently receiving threats, hate mail, and other harassing posts due to

01:38.680 --> 01:39.820
your video.

01:39.820 --> 01:43.520
We demand that you remove or correct the video immediately.

01:43.520 --> 01:52.200
Regards, Tina Watson

01:52.200 --> 01:53.200
Welcome back.

01:53.240 --> 01:58.360
Now, if you didn't see my previous video about the so-called Omegaverse lawsuit, I suggest

01:58.360 --> 02:00.320
you go ahead and do that now.

02:00.320 --> 02:02.600
It's Tiger King for her.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.760
And also, engage with it.

02:04.760 --> 02:05.760
Give it a like.

02:05.760 --> 02:06.760
Give it a comment.

02:06.760 --> 02:12.200
Because the algorithm was not kind to that one and it did not show up in most subscribers'

02:12.200 --> 02:13.200
recommendations.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.200
Hmm.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.200
Weird.

02:15.200 --> 02:19.860
In fact, while you're here, go ahead and give this a like.

02:19.860 --> 02:20.860
Give it a comment.

02:20.860 --> 02:22.040
Give it several comments.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.640
Get in fights in the comments.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.360
Drive that engagement.

02:25.360 --> 02:26.360
Because this...

02:26.360 --> 02:29.560
Well, I don't want to say this is war, but...

02:29.560 --> 02:33.880
Honey, you've got a big storm coming.

02:33.880 --> 02:39.400
Now let me start by saying that I had never intended to make this video at all.

02:39.400 --> 02:43.200
Like most of my videos, except for Game of Thrones, which I will die mad about.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.960
Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.260
That's whinging.

02:47.260 --> 02:48.680
That was supposed to be one and done.

02:48.680 --> 02:51.640
But then someone had to go and get me involved in the whole thing.

02:51.640 --> 02:56.480
Now one way or the other, I had to take September off in order to finish revisions on my second

02:56.480 --> 02:58.000
book, which is out next fall.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.480
It's called Truth of the Divine.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.480
You can...

03:00.480 --> 03:01.960
Well, not available for pre-order yet.

03:01.960 --> 03:02.960
I don't know.

03:02.960 --> 03:03.960
I'll pimp it later.

03:03.960 --> 03:09.320
But also, a lot went down in the month of September and there was a lot of documentation

03:09.320 --> 03:14.940
that I had to go through in order to cobble together as coherent a narrative as I'm about

03:14.940 --> 03:16.300
to attempt to make.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.640
Now before we get started, a note.

03:18.640 --> 03:21.960
Yes, despite my costume, this is not theater.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.040
This is all real.

03:23.040 --> 03:24.220
This is really happening.

03:24.220 --> 03:30.640
And that also said, Addison Cain and I are both regrettably, technically, public figures.

03:30.640 --> 03:36.000
Now that said, despite my request that you do not harass this woman from the last video,

03:36.000 --> 03:38.640
some of you were shitty anyway.

03:38.640 --> 03:42.720
And I get that we're all bored and losing our minds and that like, you know, cancelling

03:42.720 --> 03:44.280
is fun now.

03:44.280 --> 03:46.880
But again, I'd like to ask you to not.

03:46.880 --> 03:47.880
Like this guy.

03:47.880 --> 03:49.720
Like, we don't need to bring her shitty book into it.

03:49.720 --> 03:54.200
I know I'm not on the hook if any of you idiots post cringe in her ats or on her Facebook

03:54.200 --> 03:58.300
page, but it is, as the kids say, a bad look.

03:58.300 --> 04:02.960
Now that said, with regard to the last video, I feel like I was pretty even-handed with

04:02.960 --> 04:06.400
the criticisms I made and the conclusions I drew.

04:06.400 --> 04:11.760
And I definitely withheld a lot of criticisms and comments about Addison Cain because I

04:11.760 --> 04:16.480
was concerned that they might be a little unnecessarily mean.

04:16.480 --> 04:19.200
But trust, I feel no such obligation this time.

04:19.200 --> 04:22.840
So before we get into this, a refresher on the Dramatis Personae.

04:22.840 --> 04:28.500
Addison Cain, not her real name, erotica author who claims to have spearheaded the concept

04:28.500 --> 04:36.880
of Het Omegaverse, or ABO, and who has a knack for accusing her fellow authors of plagiarism

04:36.880 --> 04:40.460
because her ideas are just that good.

04:40.460 --> 04:42.080
Because I am your alpha.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.480
It was almost a roar.

04:43.480 --> 04:46.000
You want to be f***ed by me.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.280
Do you understand?

04:47.280 --> 04:52.600
Zoe Ellis, also not her real name and one of the alleged plagiarists, who in 2018 sued

04:52.600 --> 04:57.240
Addison Cain for alleged abusive DMCA takedown notices.

04:57.240 --> 05:01.920
She is also, in my opinion, correct.

05:01.920 --> 05:04.800
Those takedown notices were illegal and abusive.

05:04.800 --> 05:09.640
Blushing Books, Addison Cain's former publisher, who gleefully threw themselves in front of

05:09.640 --> 05:15.720
the bus for Addison Cain during the lawsuit, only to be hilariously betrayed by her and

05:15.720 --> 05:21.880
backstabbed later, and she hates them now, and they are also on her eternity quest for

05:21.880 --> 05:22.880
revenge.

05:22.880 --> 05:23.880
Patreon.

05:23.880 --> 05:24.880
Yes, really.

05:24.880 --> 05:29.680
The crowdfunding website that my company relies on for most of our income.

05:29.680 --> 05:30.960
YouTube.

05:30.960 --> 05:31.960
This hell space.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.960
The Electronic Frontier Foundation.

05:33.960 --> 05:39.080
The leading legal non-profit defending digital privacy, free speech, and innovation that

05:39.080 --> 05:42.100
I plugged at the end of the last video.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.840
And also my lawyers.

05:43.960 --> 05:50.980
Taniyah Watson, a lawyer, shown here getting brunch with her client Addison Cain in a public

05:50.980 --> 05:54.460
Facebook post that somebody wanted me to see.

05:54.460 --> 05:55.460
Actually several posts.

05:55.460 --> 05:59.500
Like, yeah, you know, I'm just getting lunch with my lawyer, you know, so just some girls

05:59.500 --> 06:02.860
talking about copyright law, gal pals.

06:02.860 --> 06:06.140
So that crazy month of September, what happened?

06:06.140 --> 06:09.300
So the video went public early on September 3rd.

06:09.300 --> 06:13.620
I was trying to get away from it, again, that was supposed to be revision month.

06:13.620 --> 06:20.360
But later that day, I get this email from Taniyah Watson saying all that weird shit.

06:20.360 --> 06:24.100
Like yes, I am a barred lawyer in the state of Oklahoma.

06:24.100 --> 06:27.760
If you want the truth, go to my client's Facebook page.

06:27.760 --> 06:33.340
Why should you go to jail for a crime someone else noticed?

06:33.340 --> 06:34.760
You don't need double talk.

06:34.760 --> 06:35.760
You need blah blah blah.

06:35.760 --> 06:36.760
Blah blah blah.

06:36.760 --> 06:37.760
No habla espanol.

06:37.760 --> 06:41.780
The thing about it is, this email didn't have any, like, thread of litigation in it.

06:41.780 --> 06:46.220
It wasn't like, take it down or else, or take it down or we'll sue.

06:46.220 --> 06:50.220
It was just take it down, gal pals.

06:50.220 --> 06:54.340
So I decided to milk that for some content because it was indeed very funny.

06:54.340 --> 06:58.340
I posted it to Twitter and decided to move on.

06:58.340 --> 06:59.940
But of course, that was not the end of it.

06:59.940 --> 07:04.460
The following day, I get an email from the head of legal at Patreon, Colin Sullivan.

07:04.460 --> 07:12.300
You see, Addison Cain has sent a DMCA takedown notice to Patreon demanding that I take the

07:12.300 --> 07:14.740
post about Omegaverse down.

07:14.740 --> 07:18.540
Honestly, yeah, I was kind of surprised.

07:18.540 --> 07:24.540
Like, the entire video was about how dumb and abusive and transparently flimsy her DMCA

07:24.540 --> 07:25.540
case was.

07:25.540 --> 07:29.660
But shh, we're still doing this, I guess.

07:29.660 --> 07:34.020
So what Addison Cain apparently even failed to consider is that, unlike companies like

07:34.020 --> 07:38.540
Amazon and YouTube, Patreon is not a giant faceless conglomerate.

07:38.540 --> 07:42.860
Not only am I one of Patreon's top creators, so of course they're going to investigate

07:42.860 --> 07:47.940
any wrongdoing I'm accused of, they also took the time to watch the video and found the

07:47.940 --> 07:50.980
whole situation a touch ironic.

07:50.980 --> 07:53.580
So I talked with the legal team at Patreon for a while.

07:53.580 --> 07:58.020
We discussed some options and what we decided was that they, in order to not be on the hook

07:58.020 --> 08:04.220
legally just in case litigation came down the pike, we will honor that DMCA takedown

08:04.220 --> 08:05.220
notice.

08:05.220 --> 08:15.460
And all that meant was I had to unlink the YouTube URL from the Patreon post for 10 days

08:15.460 --> 08:19.060
and then relink it.

08:19.060 --> 08:25.620
So I send the DMCA counter notice and Patreon basically tells Addison Cain and her lawyer

08:25.620 --> 08:29.140
that they have 10 days to sue me or I can do whatever I want with the content.

08:29.140 --> 08:32.860
And here's the thing, despite my years and years of doing this, I've never actually gotten

08:32.860 --> 08:35.020
a DMCA takedown notice before.

08:35.020 --> 08:41.140
But here's the other thing, Patreon was so, I guess the word was offended that she thought

08:41.140 --> 08:49.980
this would work, that they were like, hey, if you were to, I don't know, end up in court

08:50.940 --> 08:59.820
one way or the other, we would stand behind you and, you know, maybe fund your legal fees.

08:59.820 --> 09:01.180
Like that would be a first.

09:01.180 --> 09:05.900
Now during this whole time, despite all of these behind the scenes machinations, publicly

09:05.900 --> 09:08.380
she's weirdly quiet about the whole thing.

09:08.380 --> 09:11.700
She has to this date not said anything on her Twitter or her public Facebook or her

09:11.700 --> 09:12.700
private Facebook.

09:12.700 --> 09:18.700
However, on September 5th, rather than say something about me, she instead redirects

09:18.700 --> 09:23.340
her ire and her fans to another author.

09:23.340 --> 09:24.660
And we will get to that too.

09:24.660 --> 09:29.380
And although I cannot say for certain that she had anything to do with this, other strange

09:29.380 --> 09:33.340
goings on happened with that video and my channel in general.

09:33.340 --> 09:39.660
Somebody reported the ads as having violence and terrorism in it and full nudity and YouTube

09:39.660 --> 09:41.420
review was like, yeah, that checks out.

09:41.420 --> 09:43.660
So I had to demonetize the thing.

09:43.660 --> 09:48.500
Someone reported the URL to Twitter, meaning that sometimes when the URL popped up, it

09:48.500 --> 09:50.580
would be clocked as not safe.

09:50.580 --> 09:55.980
And someone was reporting the video, meaning that it was age restricted as recently as

09:55.980 --> 09:58.980
last week since lifted.

09:58.980 --> 10:04.580
But maybe that's all just a huge coincidence, even though none of those things have ever

10:04.580 --> 10:06.900
happened to me before.

10:06.900 --> 10:11.300
In my 10 years of doing this, big old coincidence.

10:11.300 --> 10:14.820
During this time, Addison Cain also hires a PR person.

10:14.820 --> 10:19.700
And on September 9th, she emails entertainment journalist Kaylee Donaldson asking if she

10:19.700 --> 10:22.500
wants to softball an interview with Addison Cain.

10:22.500 --> 10:25.860
Kaylee, of course, posted this email to Twitter and it was very funny.

10:25.860 --> 10:31.020
We privately speculated that it was maybe because she was a known fan of the morally

10:31.020 --> 10:34.540
questionable monster love genre.

10:34.540 --> 10:41.300
But because of that, one of the very last book reviews she did was of my book.

10:41.300 --> 10:42.860
So I know what you're all thinking.

10:42.900 --> 10:48.940
She sends a DMCA takedown notice to Patreon, but not to YouTube.

10:48.940 --> 10:49.940
Why?

10:49.940 --> 10:51.700
And we puzzled over this.

10:51.700 --> 10:53.340
Why go for Patreon?

10:53.340 --> 10:55.900
The content is not hosted on Patreon.

10:55.900 --> 10:58.620
It's hosted on YouTube and Nebula.

10:58.620 --> 11:02.980
Well, it turns out she did go for YouTube.

11:02.980 --> 11:09.020
On Friday, September 11th, I get an email from YouTube saying, hey, someone sent us

11:09.020 --> 11:11.500
a DMCA takedown notice.

11:11.500 --> 11:16.420
We looked into it and we think it's bogus.

11:16.420 --> 11:18.740
Because we think this probably falls under fair use.

11:18.740 --> 11:21.820
So we're going to ignore it.

11:26.820 --> 11:31.940
I have never heard of this ever happening, of YouTube actually getting a DMCA takedown

11:31.940 --> 11:37.380
notice and saying, no.

11:37.380 --> 11:42.100
Because as we discussed in the last video, that puts YouTube possibly legally liable

11:42.100 --> 11:45.540
if Wolfcock Karen decides to start suing people.

11:45.540 --> 11:50.900
But as we have already learned, when a platform gets a DMCA takedown notice, they have to

11:50.900 --> 11:56.180
send the notice to the person being accused of copyright infringement.

11:56.180 --> 12:04.740
Meaning, I got the letter that Addison Cain sent YouTube and...

12:04.740 --> 12:07.500
To whom it may concern.

12:07.500 --> 12:10.660
The work infringed is not fair use.

12:10.660 --> 12:13.060
My book is not public domain.

12:13.060 --> 12:16.220
It is a creative work, not a textbook.

12:16.220 --> 12:19.980
The poster reads my books to degrade my work.

12:19.980 --> 12:25.540
This is not fair use of a copyrighted work, nor was this video a review of my work.

12:25.540 --> 12:27.260
It was a personal attack.

12:27.260 --> 12:32.900
The poster significantly transformed my original work, both by altering the work and by mocking

12:32.900 --> 12:37.540
it for the poster's financial gain via YouTube and Patreon.

12:37.540 --> 12:41.260
Monetizing the video does not make this fair use.

12:41.260 --> 12:47.020
Furthermore, this poster, in regards to her video, refers to the necessity of blurring

12:47.020 --> 12:51.740
out the face of my child as DAMN BABY on Twitter.

12:51.740 --> 12:53.180
Tweet attached.

12:53.180 --> 12:58.020
The baby in question's safety has already been threatened via the lawsuit this video

12:58.020 --> 12:59.780
monopolizes upon.

12:59.780 --> 13:04.940
Photos of my daughter and how to find my address under my real name, not pseudonym,

13:04.940 --> 13:06.380
were made public.

13:06.380 --> 13:09.100
Those documents were sealed by the court.

13:09.100 --> 13:16.820
I feel Lindsay Ellis is a menace, a threat to my child, and is monetizing defamation

13:16.820 --> 13:19.380
for personal, financial gain.

13:23.140 --> 13:25.620
Oh, I am gonna milk the shit out of that.

13:29.980 --> 13:38.220
Alright, let's, uh, break this bat-shittery down, shall we?

13:38.220 --> 13:39.900
Yes, I'm still wearing the falsies.

13:39.900 --> 13:42.700
Like, this is as much effort as you're gonna get look-wise.

13:42.700 --> 13:44.020
This isn't ContraPoints.

13:44.020 --> 13:46.620
Because I don't want this to be an hour of pwnage.

13:46.620 --> 13:48.780
This is an opportunity.

13:48.780 --> 13:51.140
We can make this a learning experience.

13:51.140 --> 13:54.580
So, uh, let's break this apart.

13:54.580 --> 13:56.460
My book is not public domain.

13:56.820 --> 13:59.980
It is a creative work, not a textbook.

13:59.980 --> 14:05.420
Copyrighted material is copyrighted material, whether it's an educational textbook or

14:05.420 --> 14:06.420
wolf porn.

14:06.420 --> 14:11.380
That said, the sum total of Kane's work that we used was about 400 words.

14:11.380 --> 14:15.100
Um, about two minutes out of an hour-long video.

14:15.100 --> 14:18.860
The poster reads my books to degrade my work.

14:18.860 --> 14:23.900
This is not fair use of a copyrighted work, nor was this video a review of my work.

14:23.900 --> 14:25.380
Yeah, I don't really do reviews.

14:25.420 --> 14:28.860
Uh, fair use actually encompasses a lot more than that.

14:28.860 --> 14:33.860
That said, we didn't just include copyrighted material for shits and giggles.

14:33.860 --> 14:39.420
We included it in order to give examples of the content that was being fought over.

14:39.420 --> 14:44.860
It was a personal attack, framed around two lawsuits filed against me personally, in which

14:44.860 --> 14:47.860
the poster did not like the outcomes in court.

14:47.860 --> 14:55.340
I mean, I know it feels personal, maybe, but I didn't say anything about Addison Kane

14:55.660 --> 14:59.020
outside of what was relevant to the court case.

14:59.020 --> 15:04.700
The reason I came down the way I did was because I looked at the evidence and was like, hmm,

15:04.700 --> 15:07.660
there's kind of a clear right and wrong side here.

15:07.660 --> 15:11.580
That said, we seem to be in disagreement of what the outcomes even were, and I'll get

15:11.580 --> 15:12.580
to that later.

15:12.580 --> 15:18.340
Furthermore, my work has been altered, words blacked out, thus creating work product the

15:18.340 --> 15:21.060
poster did not have permission to create.

15:21.060 --> 15:25.060
I, uh, I don't usually ask for permission.

15:25.060 --> 15:30.540
When people talk about fair use, they usually restrict it to educational purposes, criticism,

15:30.540 --> 15:37.140
and parody, and they don't seem to think that it can exist outside of that, but it actually

15:37.140 --> 15:38.540
does go further.

15:38.540 --> 15:42.260
The other key word here is transformative, and that's sort of the ironic thing with her

15:42.260 --> 15:49.460
letter at all, is she's upset that I did a dramatic reading of her work and blacked out

15:49.460 --> 15:55.380
some of the words, thereby transforming it, lending more credence to fair use.

15:55.380 --> 15:58.740
Monetizing the video does not make this fair use.

15:58.740 --> 16:03.300
Uh, it doesn't actually have anything to do with whether it's monetized or not.

16:03.300 --> 16:11.020
Like, it being commercial kind of works against the argument, but you can monetize things

16:11.020 --> 16:16.220
and it still be fair use, you know, reviewers and critics have careers.

16:16.220 --> 16:22.940
Now the reason why monetizing your content can work against fair use isn't because, like,

16:22.940 --> 16:27.380
it's, you know, commercial and nonprofits are better or more moral or something.

16:27.380 --> 16:31.740
It has to do with the market for the original copyrighted material.

16:31.740 --> 16:37.640
The standard when you make money off of someone else's copyrighted material is does this substitute

16:37.640 --> 16:40.260
or destroy the original market?

16:40.260 --> 16:46.200
And a YouTube video about a court case isn't going to substitute the market for erotica.

16:46.200 --> 16:49.120
Does my monetizing this content destroy her market?

16:49.120 --> 16:51.040
And the answer is obviously no.

16:51.040 --> 16:54.560
The only way you could argue that I would harm the market is if I made the book look

16:54.560 --> 17:00.080
bad by saying it's bad and that's fair use.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.240
There's nothing you can do about that.

17:02.240 --> 17:07.120
Criticism does not count as destroying the market, uh, even though I didn't actually

17:07.120 --> 17:08.880
criticize her dumb book.

17:08.880 --> 17:13.960
But while we're on this subject, I did have some empathy for Addison Cain before the video

17:13.960 --> 17:21.640
went up because as a New York Times bestselling author, I do actually know what it's like

17:21.640 --> 17:25.760
for people to shit on your book and monetize them shitting on your book.

17:25.760 --> 17:29.660
I know what it's like for some of these people to shit on your book while getting tens of

17:29.660 --> 17:30.980
thousands of views.

17:30.980 --> 17:34.480
And if you want to go outside the book stuff, I know what it's like for a lot of people

17:34.480 --> 17:40.440
to personally target me to the tune of hundreds of thousands, if not millions of views.

17:40.440 --> 17:41.840
It sucks.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.840
It really fucking sucks.

17:43.840 --> 17:49.480
But here's the thing, it's not copyright infringement and technically it's not illegal.

17:49.480 --> 17:53.920
I can't really even claim that it's defamation, which is ironic because every time one of

17:53.920 --> 17:57.920
those dipshits videos get taken down, they think I did it like I've even fucking watched

17:57.920 --> 17:58.920
any of them.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.920
No one cares about your response video, Gary.

18:00.920 --> 18:01.920
But that is the thing.

18:01.920 --> 18:06.320
People can monetize themselves saying shit about you that you don't like.

18:06.320 --> 18:10.640
And if you're a public figure, there is not a lot you can do about it unless they say

18:10.640 --> 18:14.320
something that is objectively, patently untrue.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.320
And even then, it's still an uphill battle.

18:16.320 --> 18:17.320
Sucks, huh?

18:17.320 --> 18:28.680
So as I said, no, I did not actually think that the subject of a video that I made about

18:28.680 --> 18:36.520
a person known for making bad faith DMCA takedown notices would make a bad faith takedown DMCA

18:37.520 --> 18:44.520
but I don't know, maybe there's, I don't know, there's some, I feel like there's a term for

18:44.520 --> 18:45.520
this.

18:45.520 --> 18:46.520
Some sort of effect.

18:46.520 --> 18:53.520
I just, I don't know, I've been listening to the wavy word of the mind.

18:53.520 --> 18:56.400
Okay, let's look at the allegations.

18:56.400 --> 19:01.440
That my client claimed to own tropes and that was what the DMCA's at issue were about.

19:01.440 --> 19:02.440
No I didn't.

19:02.440 --> 19:05.400
Two, that my client blackmailed Zoe Ellis.

19:05.400 --> 19:08.920
Wow, no, no I didn't even a little bit allege that.

19:08.920 --> 19:10.360
I don't know where the hell you got that.

19:10.360 --> 19:13.920
That Miss Kane's publisher settled due to Miss Kane's perjury in Oklahoma.

19:13.920 --> 19:18.800
Yeah, about the perjury thing, I guess you could say I implied it, but I didn't say it.

19:18.800 --> 19:25.320
I did say what actually did happen was that the plaintiff accused Kane of perjuring herself

19:25.320 --> 19:30.400
and then three days later, a judgment was filed by the court.

19:30.400 --> 19:33.040
And this was one mistake I did make.

19:33.040 --> 19:35.440
You see, there was no settlement.

19:35.440 --> 19:36.940
It was not a settlement.

19:36.940 --> 19:37.940
It was a judgment.

19:37.940 --> 19:42.960
A judgment is an official designation that is entered on a court's docket that designates

19:42.960 --> 19:49.000
that a plaintiff has prevailed against the defendant in a court case.

19:49.000 --> 19:54.720
Plaintiff in the Oklahoma case, Quill Inc.'s books, prevailed over the defendant blushing

19:54.720 --> 19:55.720
books.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.520
There was no settlement.

19:57.520 --> 19:59.080
That was my mistake.

19:59.080 --> 20:01.440
Sorry, Addison.

20:01.440 --> 20:05.560
But the other lawsuits in Virginia died for unrelated reasons.

20:05.560 --> 20:08.400
It did close for unrelated reasons.

20:08.400 --> 20:15.000
The Oklahoma case was closed after blushing books, admitting wrongdoing, and the Virginia

20:15.000 --> 20:19.480
case was closed for lack of prosecution.

20:19.480 --> 20:20.880
These things had nothing to do with each other.

20:20.880 --> 20:22.640
They were completely unrelated.

20:22.640 --> 20:28.720
But one thing I have not really touched on yet is the letter that Tanya Watson had sent

20:28.720 --> 20:29.720
to Patreon.

20:30.120 --> 20:31.880
To whom it may concern.

20:31.880 --> 20:34.160
My firm represents Addison Cain.

20:34.160 --> 20:36.360
Miss Cain is a well-known author.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.200
Recently, one of your users posted co-

20:38.200 --> 20:39.200
Okay, here's the thing.

20:39.200 --> 20:43.640
It's not substantive enough to be, like, you know, fun to read the way the other one was,

20:43.640 --> 20:45.040
so I'm just gonna break it down.

20:45.040 --> 20:49.200
Due to the content, my client has received hate mail and attacks on social media.

20:49.200 --> 20:53.800
I have a good faith belief that the material I am reporting is not authorized by the copyright

20:53.800 --> 20:56.400
owner, an agent of the owner, or the law.

20:56.600 --> 21:01.000
If you really do have a good faith belief that this is copyright infringement, I find

21:01.000 --> 21:07.040
it interesting that you would mention defamation or harassment at all, because those things

21:07.040 --> 21:12.320
do not have anything to do with whether or not my use of the 400 words of Born to be

21:12.320 --> 21:14.640
Bound was copyright infringement.

21:14.640 --> 21:20.120
Lens v. Universal Music Corp. 2016, the fair use of a copyrighted work for purposes such

21:20.120 --> 21:26.520
as criticism, comment, news reporting, or teaching is not an infringement, and is therefore

21:26.520 --> 21:28.640
wholly authorized by the law.

21:28.640 --> 21:33.240
Recently, one of your users posted content that includes excerpts of my client's work

21:33.240 --> 21:37.640
that were posted without her permission, along with numerous false claims and defamatory

21:37.640 --> 21:38.880
statements.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.260
It does not work like that.

21:40.260 --> 21:44.400
You hurt my feelings, ipso facto copyright infringement.

21:44.400 --> 21:47.240
That's not how copyright works.

21:47.240 --> 21:52.040
Copyright infringement is infringement whether your feelings are hurt or not.

21:52.040 --> 21:59.640
I actually kind of like this wolf hat.

21:59.640 --> 22:01.200
I'm like, I'm going to start wearing this.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.200
It's got pockets.

22:02.200 --> 22:04.760
None of my clothes do.

22:04.760 --> 22:05.760
Paws.

22:05.760 --> 22:08.640
Furry solidarity.

22:08.640 --> 22:11.800
So that's just me, but what about everybody else?

22:11.800 --> 22:16.600
What about the other, um, I don't want to say victims, targets of Addison Cain's disdain,

22:16.960 --> 22:17.960
shall we say?

22:17.960 --> 22:21.600
Well, first and most obvious is Zoe Ellis, who filed the original lawsuit, who alleges

22:21.600 --> 22:29.000
that Cain's publisher at the direction of Cain filed dozens of DMCA takedown notices.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.800
Is that specific enough for you?

22:30.800 --> 22:34.720
I mean, she does also allege that Cain herself sent some of them, but we're keeping it simple.

22:34.720 --> 22:39.920
But that wasn't all there was to it when we're talking about the defamation side of the lawsuit.

22:39.920 --> 22:45.040
Basically, Ellis also alleges that Cain spent a lot of time and effort shit-talking her

22:45.040 --> 22:46.040
to the community.

22:46.040 --> 22:50.600
And since we're talking about self-published erotica, authors kind of live and die a lot

22:50.600 --> 22:53.800
more on networking than they do on the traditional side.

22:53.800 --> 22:57.240
And so if Addison Cain is running around in all these like Omegaverse Facebook groups

22:57.240 --> 23:04.160
saying like, hey, this woman is plagiarizing me, that's kind of a bad look for the accused.

23:04.160 --> 23:08.720
Then there is an author, Nora Ashe, who was an early proponent of Zoe Ellis when she was

23:08.720 --> 23:10.800
first entering authoredom.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.960
And this is another mistake slash redaction I need to make.

23:13.960 --> 23:20.360
Patricia Briggs, who I said was the first Omegaverse author, was not actually that.

23:20.360 --> 23:23.520
She wrote kind of werewolfy stuff.

23:23.520 --> 23:27.360
You know, there was like some, obviously it was called Alpha and Omega, but like it didn't

23:27.360 --> 23:32.200
have most of the tropes that we associate with ABO.

23:32.200 --> 23:39.320
The first hit commercial Omegaverse author was Nora Ashe, not Addison Cain.

23:39.320 --> 23:44.480
Part of her crime was being an early champion of Zoe Ellis, but another part of it was the

23:44.480 --> 23:51.600
fact that she repeatedly pointed out that she was the first commercially published Omegaverse

23:51.600 --> 23:52.600
hit author.

23:52.600 --> 23:57.200
God, this is like, the specificity is really important in the erotica wars, okay?

23:57.200 --> 24:02.160
Anyway, Nora Ashe alleges that Cain also threw her clout around to damage her brand within

24:02.160 --> 24:03.240
the author community.

24:03.240 --> 24:04.380
And then there's Lee Savino.

24:04.380 --> 24:07.040
And now we're getting into like the really wild shit.

24:07.040 --> 24:09.040
Lee Savino does not write ABO.

24:09.040 --> 24:14.280
She's more in the vein of dark werewolfy romance sort of thing.

24:14.280 --> 24:17.760
Also a former friend of Addison Cain, as so many of these women are.

24:17.760 --> 24:23.040
And I'm not exactly clear on when Addison Cain decided that Lee Savino was actually

24:23.040 --> 24:27.520
in the enemy's camp, in this grand conspiracy against her.

24:27.520 --> 24:32.880
But the long and short is that Cain decided that Lee Savino knew damning things about

24:32.880 --> 24:35.500
Zoe Ellis and Nora Ashe.

24:35.500 --> 24:40.940
And so she subpoenaed Lee Savino in her counterclaim in the Virginia lawsuit.

24:40.940 --> 24:44.260
So you remember how earlier I mentioned that she didn't say anything about my video, but

24:44.260 --> 24:47.620
instead redirected her ire to another author?

24:47.620 --> 24:50.780
Well, this is that author, and here's what she said.

24:50.780 --> 24:55.580
It is extremely expensive to subpoena someone in a lawsuit.

24:55.580 --> 25:01.780
Myself and my reputable attorneys would never do so frivolously or vindictively.

25:02.100 --> 25:07.340
Regrettably, we were forced to subpoena Lee Savino because she has in her possession highly

25:07.340 --> 25:11.340
relevant information to the lawsuit brought against me.

25:11.340 --> 25:13.580
There is a reason she was subpoenaed.

25:13.580 --> 25:18.780
She and I are both aware of it, and if she continues to make inflammatory statements

25:18.780 --> 25:22.820
against my character, I will make what I know public.

25:22.820 --> 25:28.220
Thing is, I do have a copy of that subpoena, and I have absolutely no problem making public

25:28.220 --> 25:30.580
what she thinks is such a big deal.

25:30.820 --> 25:35.460
Of course, it was like long-winding conspiratorial nonsense, but the long and short is that she

25:35.460 --> 25:42.900
demanded that Lee Savino produce all documents relating to Margarita Cole, Eva Dresden, and

25:42.900 --> 25:49.060
remember those names, we'll get to them, Addison Cain, Zoe Ellis, and Nora Ash.

25:49.060 --> 25:53.300
The latter two, again, are both in the UK and are harder to get information on.

25:53.300 --> 25:54.660
Oh, but that's not all.

25:54.660 --> 26:00.380
Lee Savino is also a plagiarist, but she didn't copy a plot.

26:00.380 --> 26:02.900
She copied a, uh, character.

26:02.900 --> 26:07.420
So here's part of the letter that Tammy Watson sent Lee Savino when they were forced to drop

26:07.420 --> 26:09.340
the counterclaim in Virginia.

26:09.340 --> 26:13.900
We are writing to inform you that my client has decided to move to dismiss her counterclaim

26:13.900 --> 26:16.060
in the above-referenced lawsuit.

26:16.060 --> 26:20.260
My client wishes to put these matters behind her and would appreciate if your client would

26:20.260 --> 26:25.180
either return the witch character at issue and remove her from Miss Savino's Berserker

26:25.180 --> 26:26.180
series.

26:26.180 --> 26:27.180
Return the witch!

26:27.580 --> 26:31.900
Considering the history and Miss Savino's use of my client's character, we request that

26:31.900 --> 26:37.060
Miss Cain's books are no longer used as the inspiration for ghostwriters to emulate.

26:37.060 --> 26:40.660
Like I cannot read her mind, I don't know what's in her heart, but according to her,

26:40.660 --> 26:45.540
this is a character she's been writing for like 10 years and she has no idea where Cain

26:45.540 --> 26:50.620
decided that this character and this character alone was plagiarized from one of Cain's books.

26:50.620 --> 26:56.020
Oh, and Addison Cain also accused Savino of reporting her Facebook ads to Facebook as

26:56.140 --> 26:57.140
being inappropriate.

26:57.140 --> 27:00.860
Huge, if true.

27:00.860 --> 27:05.780
Then there's author Ava Dresden, also an author in this community, also subpoenaed in the

27:05.780 --> 27:11.180
Virginia case, basically the exact same shit, like give me dirt on this, this, this, and

27:11.180 --> 27:12.180
this person.

27:12.180 --> 27:16.420
So Dresden takes this seriously and has to hire a lawyer and ends up spending a ton of

27:16.420 --> 27:24.980
money on this whole nonsense thing only to have Cain drop the subpoena when Quill gets

27:24.980 --> 27:28.060
dismissed from the Virginia case for lack of prosecution.

27:28.060 --> 27:33.940
Courtney Milan is not an Omegaverse author, but is fairly well known in the more traditional

27:33.940 --> 27:35.660
historical romance community.

27:35.660 --> 27:40.780
And so Milan basically got involved in this when someone reached out to her like, hey,

27:40.780 --> 27:44.220
you're a lawyer, what do you think of this whole thing?

27:44.220 --> 27:48.740
And Milan looked at it and she opined on Twitter basically that she thought Cain was in the

27:48.740 --> 27:53.460
wrong and this is obviously not plagiarism, it's just too broad, it's too tropey, this

27:53.460 --> 27:55.900
is sans affair, this is not how plagiarism works.

27:55.900 --> 28:01.380
And so Milan, a person that Cain has never really interacted with or talked to, is now

28:01.380 --> 28:05.260
also on the list of eternity vengeance quest.

28:05.260 --> 28:10.260
Here she is harassing Milan on Twitter, here she is dragging Milan on her personal Facebook.

28:10.260 --> 28:14.340
I have been one of Courtney Milan's favorite punching bags over the years.

28:14.340 --> 28:15.340
Why?

28:15.340 --> 28:17.260
In the beginning, I didn't know.

28:17.260 --> 28:21.740
I still don't know why she was comfortable saying the things she said without any form

28:21.740 --> 28:28.060
of proof or taking the time to afford a fellow human the courtesy of due diligence.

28:28.060 --> 28:33.980
Authors are afraid of Courtney Milan, and I understand why better than most.

28:33.980 --> 28:39.680
To all the others she has bullied without respecting the community and seeking fact,

28:39.680 --> 28:42.020
I am so sorry.

28:42.020 --> 28:49.300
I know what it feels like to be trampled, ignored, and attacked for sport, but we don't

28:49.300 --> 28:51.500
need to be afraid of bullies.

28:51.500 --> 28:53.380
Not when we have each other.

28:53.380 --> 28:57.740
Not when we have kindness and the support of a community we love.

28:57.740 --> 29:01.060
Not when we have THE TRUTH.

29:01.060 --> 29:02.180
Hashtag RWA.

29:02.180 --> 29:04.100
Hashtag stand up to bullying.

29:04.100 --> 29:07.220
Here's Toni Watson mentioning her in her letter to me.

29:07.220 --> 29:12.940
The previous lies and inaccuracies spread by Quill, Zoe Ellis, Courtney Milan, and others.

29:12.940 --> 29:18.020
And here is the formal ethics complaint Cain filed against Courtney Milan with the Romance

29:18.020 --> 29:19.820
Writers of America.

29:19.820 --> 29:24.940
Formal Ethics Complaint against Courtney Milan to Romance Writers of America.

29:24.940 --> 29:32.100
To whom it may concern, I have recently learned that Courtney Milan serves on the RWA Ethics

29:32.100 --> 29:33.100
Committee.

29:33.100 --> 29:38.620
The high level of trust authors must place in the RWA to operate with integrity leads

29:38.620 --> 29:44.860
me to file this complaint against Ms. Milan for poor and unethical behavior.

29:44.860 --> 29:50.860
On March 12, 2019, Courtney Milan posted statements about me and a lawsuit against

29:50.860 --> 29:59.380
me to her 37.9k Twitter followers after I was sent to her by the RWA for assistance.

29:59.380 --> 30:05.380
These posts were not based on fact or evidence, but merely on the allegations in a lawsuit

30:05.380 --> 30:07.860
which had just been initiated.

30:07.860 --> 30:12.900
And as someone who markets herself as a legal expert, she did not take the time to research

30:12.900 --> 30:15.780
the allegations she recklessly tweeted.

30:15.780 --> 30:21.300
Thanks to Courtney's carelessness, unsubstantiated slander was spread to the point I received

30:21.300 --> 30:29.300
threatening messages.

30:29.300 --> 30:35.140
After her tweets, many members of the community I loved and dedicated readers turned on me,

30:35.140 --> 30:39.260
taking her factually unsupported posts at face value.

30:39.260 --> 30:44.580
Once again, I request RWA sanction Courtney Milan and remove her from the Ethics Board

30:44.580 --> 30:47.260
and any affiliation with RWA.

30:47.260 --> 30:52.060
Sincerely, Addison Cain, Membership ID 31817.

30:52.060 --> 30:54.820
Is there no manager she won't complain to?

30:54.820 --> 30:59.500
To be clear, all of this sturm und drang is because Courtney Milan, who has a pretty solid

30:59.500 --> 31:06.300
base of legal knowledge, expressed an opinion about the court case on Twitter.com.

31:07.300 --> 31:10.500
She never said anything about Cain as a person.

31:10.500 --> 31:17.220
So what's funny to me about this Twitter exchange is that Milan, despite having a law degree,

31:17.220 --> 31:22.820
can't really understand what's going on because she's not a barred lawyer, meaning she's not

31:22.820 --> 31:30.620
practicing, but Addison Cain, who thinks monetizing content exempts it from fair use, is the legalist

31:30.620 --> 31:32.100
expert that ever legaled.

31:32.100 --> 31:36.000
Oh, but one other funny thing that happened just as I was editing this is I got an email

31:36.000 --> 31:41.360
from Courtney Milan saying, hey, I actually remembered who it was that originally reached

31:41.360 --> 31:44.400
out to me about the Omegaverse lawsuit.

31:44.400 --> 31:47.960
And wouldn't you know, it was Addison Cain.

31:47.960 --> 31:51.080
Well, that backfired.

31:51.080 --> 31:52.280
Margarita Cole.

31:52.280 --> 31:54.280
This is Zoe Ellis's lawyer.

31:54.280 --> 31:59.840
Now Cole is a lawyer that represents a lot of authors in like IP and like rights and

31:59.840 --> 32:00.840
stuff.

32:00.840 --> 32:04.080
She's like that kind of lawyer, formerly a bankruptcy lawyer.

32:04.080 --> 32:05.900
This comes into it, believe it or not.

32:05.900 --> 32:10.540
Now, according to Cole, she originally got involved with Zoe Ellis by getting onto one

32:10.540 --> 32:12.300
of her mailing lists.

32:12.300 --> 32:15.180
And then eventually they started talking about rights and stuff.

32:15.180 --> 32:18.900
Then Zoe Ellis reached out to her whenever she started getting all these DMCA takedown

32:18.900 --> 32:19.900
notices.

32:19.900 --> 32:24.260
Now I bring this whole up because Cain has repeatedly alleged that Margarita Cole has

32:24.260 --> 32:30.840
had like this weird, obsessive vendetta against Addison Cain for years, saw an opportunity

32:30.840 --> 32:36.800
with Zoe Ellis and all these DMCA takedowns and is therefore the mastermind of this whole

32:36.800 --> 32:37.800
thing.

32:37.800 --> 32:41.200
And kind of like Milan, she's does the thing where she's like, well, you're a bankruptcy

32:41.200 --> 32:42.200
lawyer.

32:42.200 --> 32:45.780
How can you possibly know about copyright infringement?

32:45.780 --> 32:50.840
And this is kind of a running theme with Cain's aspersions against people.

32:50.840 --> 32:57.240
Like Milan isn't barred, therefore she cannot opine on the whole case unless it's in favor

32:57.240 --> 32:58.480
of Cain.

32:58.480 --> 33:03.120
And Margarita Cole doesn't know what she's doing because she was a bankruptcy lawyer

33:03.120 --> 33:06.960
at some point in history, even though she's not anymore.

33:06.960 --> 33:09.540
Oh, but that's not all.

33:09.540 --> 33:15.760
Blushing Books and Addison Cain alleges Margarita Cole, covering my ass, has filed three bar

33:15.760 --> 33:19.040
complaints against this woman over the last two years.

33:19.040 --> 33:23.680
And I know I have to say alleged to cover my ass, but like I do have a copy of one of

33:23.680 --> 33:28.600
these bar complaints and it was Blushing that filed it and it was during the freaking

33:28.600 --> 33:29.600
lawsuit.

33:29.600 --> 33:35.840
So they filed a bar complaint against an opposing lawyer as ongoing litigation was happening.

33:35.840 --> 33:38.840
Ethics.

33:38.840 --> 33:42.080
And again, it is this sort of conspiracy, like she read an art she didn't like and she's

33:42.080 --> 33:45.240
been trying to take down Addison Cain for years.

33:45.240 --> 33:50.520
And also she's got like 80 sock puppets and here are examples of all of them, ergo bar

33:50.520 --> 33:51.520
complaint.

33:51.520 --> 34:00.720
And again, according to Cole, a new bar complaint was filed by Addison Cain on August 26, 2020.

34:00.720 --> 34:02.040
Less than two months ago.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.880
And finally, surprisingly, Blushing Books.

34:05.880 --> 34:11.760
So Blushing has alleged that Addison Cain was the person who reported them to the RWA

34:11.760 --> 34:15.040
and is therefore the reason they are on advocacy alert.

34:15.040 --> 34:19.520
Now we reached out to the RWA to confirm that and they declined to comment because they

34:19.520 --> 34:21.420
don't give names for that sort of thing.

34:21.420 --> 34:28.060
But based on an email that Blushing sent to Courtney Milan, the only romance lawyer,

34:28.060 --> 34:29.540
they do believe it was Cain.

34:29.540 --> 34:34.220
And of course, Cain made all sorts of wild allegations against Blushing, including like

34:34.220 --> 34:37.620
book burning and breach of contract, bit, bit, bit, bit, bit.

34:37.620 --> 34:51.340
How many of you have ever felt personally victimized by Regina George?

34:51.340 --> 34:53.260
So why bring all of this up?

34:53.260 --> 34:58.540
Well, originally, this video was meant to be sort of a learning experience about copyright.

34:58.540 --> 35:02.180
But obviously this isn't about copyright.

35:02.180 --> 35:06.060
Some people just want other people to shut up.

35:06.060 --> 35:09.700
And sometimes she uses copyright law to do it.

35:09.700 --> 35:14.620
But most of the time she doesn't like the way she uses this word defamation just so

35:14.620 --> 35:15.620
eagerly.

35:15.620 --> 35:22.020
I'm reminded of the way that El Presidente is just so eager to expand libel laws in the

35:22.020 --> 35:24.700
US to be like the ones in the UK.

35:24.700 --> 35:27.500
So really, this isn't even about copyright law anymore.

35:27.500 --> 35:28.860
And it never was.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.500
It's about deplatforming.

35:30.500 --> 35:31.980
Cain has people she doesn't like.

35:31.980 --> 35:34.420
She wants to deplatform them.

35:34.420 --> 35:37.260
Just sometimes she uses the DMCA to do it.

35:37.260 --> 35:41.980
And I think this is really interesting because while I think she's wrong and is definitely

35:41.980 --> 35:47.780
abusing systems that are in place to protect people, it does kinda highlight a major problem,

35:47.780 --> 35:50.860
which is that platforms don't really care about abuse.

35:50.860 --> 35:52.500
They don't care about harassment.

35:52.500 --> 35:56.820
And before you go there Addison, no, by no meaningful definition, legal or ethical, does

35:56.820 --> 35:59.900
this count as defamation, abuse, or harassment.

35:59.900 --> 36:00.900
Dammit.

36:00.900 --> 36:04.940
However, as someone who has multiple times been on the wrong side of coordinated harassment

36:04.940 --> 36:09.820
campaigns and is also friends with people who have gone through way, way worse, including

36:09.860 --> 36:16.300
having to move, sometimes move cities, I feel like I can say with some certainty that platforms

36:16.300 --> 36:17.820
don't take harassment seriously.

36:17.820 --> 36:20.220
But you know what they do take seriously?

36:20.220 --> 36:21.540
Copyright.

36:21.540 --> 36:26.820
As if for instance, here again we have the President of the United States sharing a bad

36:26.820 --> 36:29.260
meme using Nickelback's photograph.

36:29.260 --> 36:33.820
Well Nickelback was successful in getting that tweet taken down because they filed a

36:33.820 --> 36:34.820
DMCA takedown.

36:34.820 --> 36:41.140
Similarly, there are examples of counter-protesters blasting copyrighted music at alt-right rallies

36:41.140 --> 36:46.340
so it can't get uploaded in its raw form and will also therefore be taken down.

36:46.340 --> 36:50.980
Which, while effective, also swings in the other direction because counter-protesters

36:50.980 --> 36:56.540
have been known to do that to, for instance, BLM using the exact same tactic.

36:56.540 --> 37:01.700
The pendulum swings both ways, and even in the Nickelback case, while ethically good

37:01.700 --> 37:07.460
for them, I honestly don't think that counts as copyright infringement.

37:07.460 --> 37:14.820
It's a dumb shitty meme, but I think that, personally, it's transformative enough that

37:14.820 --> 37:16.860
it would count as fair use.

37:16.860 --> 37:21.940
If it were taken to court, oh god, I'm imagining that, no, please, no.

37:21.940 --> 37:26.100
So it really is no wonder that there are people who feel like copyright law and the DMCA is

37:26.100 --> 37:29.780
a perfectly valid way to suppress speech they don't like.

37:29.780 --> 37:34.820
Both Addison Cain and her lawyer, Shania Watson, say as much in their DMCA complaints.

37:34.820 --> 37:38.900
And neither Addison nor her lawyer seem to care that it doesn't matter why you want the

37:38.900 --> 37:41.740
infringing material taken down.

37:41.740 --> 37:47.700
Copyright exists to protect your share of the market, not to protect you from defamation

37:47.700 --> 37:50.420
or things that might make you look bad.

37:50.420 --> 38:00.020
Hey, Angelina, what the hell is taking so long with this edit?

38:00.020 --> 38:04.940
Yeah, uh, sorry, sorry, um, I've just been so busy with my damn baby that it's just starting

38:04.940 --> 38:06.020
to take over my brain.

38:06.020 --> 38:09.420
It's like how you can't call your damn baby a damn baby unless you are, like, the most

38:09.420 --> 38:12.900
wretched person in the world, and not like you're a mom who's constantly overloaded with

38:12.900 --> 38:16.620
a toddler who's screaming for you nonstop, and the fact that you just want to call her

38:16.620 --> 38:20.820
a damn baby to your friends over a glass of wine doesn't necessarily make you a bad

38:20.820 --> 38:21.820
person.

38:21.820 --> 38:23.820
Ah, you're always going on about your damn baby.

38:23.820 --> 38:29.820
Yeah, yeah, of course, I won't say anything else about the damn baby, DAMN BABY!

38:29.820 --> 38:30.820
Ugh, damn baby.

38:30.820 --> 38:33.780
Well, of course this wasn't the end of it.

38:33.780 --> 38:39.180
EFF did decide to take me on, so they sent a letter to Tomi Watson explaining why all

38:39.180 --> 38:44.900
of the stuff in her letter was wrong, and, um, I don't know, I kind of genuinely did

38:44.900 --> 38:51.380
think that would be the end of it, like I didn't think, uh, I didn't think they'd respond.

38:51.380 --> 38:52.380
But they did.

38:52.380 --> 38:58.500
Um, so yeah, let's, uh, let's see what they said.

38:58.500 --> 39:03.900
As your organization, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, EFF, is a close partner with the

39:03.900 --> 39:09.500
Organization for Transformative Works, OTW, and was clearly working with Lindsay Ellis

39:09.500 --> 39:16.180
on the video, the EFF is aware that for over two years, my client, Addison Cain, Ms. Cain,

39:16.180 --> 39:20.780
has been involved in two lawsuits in which the plaintiff, Quill Inc. Books Ltd., was

39:20.780 --> 39:23.740
supported by the OTW.

39:23.740 --> 39:34.300
OT... the people who own AO3, the fanfiction website?

39:34.300 --> 39:38.260
Regardless of what really happened during the two lawsuits, it is clear that you and

39:38.260 --> 39:43.460
your clients were intent on spreading false allegations and outright lies about my clients

39:43.460 --> 39:48.900
and the litigation in the monetized video, which the EFF received a portion of the proceeds

39:48.900 --> 39:49.900
to help produce.

39:49.900 --> 39:54.940
Ms. Ellis could have easily condensed use of Ms. Cain's book into a few paragraphs for

39:54.940 --> 40:00.420
illustration instead of reading from the book for over two minutes.

40:00.420 --> 40:04.340
How... how long do you think it takes to read a few paragraphs?

40:04.340 --> 40:05.340
Like...

40:06.140 --> 40:11.180
Zoe Ellis and her attorneys utilized numerous methods to obtain their objective to spear

40:11.180 --> 40:16.820
Ms. Cain's name, but one common denominator has been their utilization of the OTW, of

40:16.820 --> 40:18.820
which the EFF is a close partner.

40:18.820 --> 40:23.820
It is our opinion that defamation exists, and because the EFF worked in collusion with

40:23.820 --> 40:29.120
Lindsay Ellis to create the monetized video, the EFF is also culpable for the copyright

40:29.120 --> 40:31.100
infringement and the defamation.

40:31.100 --> 40:35.780
Lindsay Ellis goes on to further claim the EFF is the leading non-profit defending digital

40:35.780 --> 40:36.780
privacy.

40:36.780 --> 40:42.380
However, the relationship between the EFF and the OTW in this instance makes that statement

40:42.380 --> 40:44.060
shaky at best.

40:44.060 --> 40:48.620
The OTW previously partnered with Zoe Ellis and her agents, who went to great lengths

40:48.620 --> 40:53.860
to expose my client's real name, home address, and photos of her child in relation to her

40:53.860 --> 40:58.780
real name and home address, which is the opposite of digital privacy.

40:58.780 --> 41:04.260
The tie between OTW and the EFF, and the history of abuse my client has faced the last

41:04.260 --> 41:10.220
two years, makes the use of Lindsay Ellis, a YouTube-slash-Patreon personality with public

41:10.220 --> 41:16.340
sway, suspicious in the least, particularly when you assisted in the creation of a monetized

41:16.340 --> 41:21.940
video where both the EFF and Lindsay Ellis could profit off copyright infringement and

41:21.940 --> 41:22.940
defamation.

41:22.940 --> 41:28.740
As you are clearly aware, the fair use doctrine is highly subjective, and we find your analysis

41:28.740 --> 41:33.340
of Ms. Ellis' use of Ms. Kane's book erroneous and incomplete.

41:33.340 --> 41:39.940
As your client is unaware of legal procedure, she must also not understand that simply because

41:39.940 --> 41:45.140
a motion-slash-complaint was filed in court does not mean the statement is true.

41:45.140 --> 41:50.020
However, there is no excuse for your lack of due diligence on this topic.

41:50.020 --> 41:55.340
Ms. Ellis clearly creates her videos and publishes them on YouTube and Patreon for profit, and

41:55.340 --> 42:00.780
the EFF profited as well in this case, a factor that strongly cuts against your fair

42:00.780 --> 42:02.100
use argument.

42:02.100 --> 42:06.820
As a direct result of the video, see Exhibit 1 showing evidence of a Twitter user who states

42:06.820 --> 42:09.660
that he gave a one-star review to my client's book.

42:09.660 --> 42:14.460
God damn it, you fucking asshole.

42:14.460 --> 42:20.380
Despite my client's current public silence regarding Lindsay Ellis, her ongoing accusations,

42:20.380 --> 42:26.420
the defaming video, and verbal attacks of her child, your client has gone to great lengths

42:26.420 --> 42:30.900
to continue to spread baseless accusations and misinformation.

42:30.900 --> 42:36.660
Regardless of this failure, it is clear that the EFF, through Lindsay Ellis, is now attempting

42:36.660 --> 42:42.780
to drag the battle's corpses over the finish line by making a defamatory video and misleading

42:42.780 --> 42:49.140
the public about your agenda, using a legally ignorant layman to do your dirty work in exchange

42:49.180 --> 42:50.820
for donations.

42:50.820 --> 42:55.900
We request a public apology from both the EFF and Lindsay Ellis for knowingly spreading

42:55.900 --> 42:58.420
false information for profit.

42:58.420 --> 43:03.820
And finally, we request that Lindsay Ellis and the EFF donate all proceeds made from

43:03.820 --> 43:10.820
the defaming video to the anti-bully charity, KindCampaign.com.

43:11.500 --> 43:20.500
It's the champagne of beers.

43:20.500 --> 43:24.420
Oh my god, I can't believe I even need to say this.

43:24.420 --> 43:32.460
Neither EFF nor OTW had anything to do with the production of that video.

43:32.460 --> 43:33.900
No collusion.

43:33.900 --> 43:38.700
To date, I have not made a donation to EFF, especially since the damn video is demonetized.

43:38.700 --> 43:43.660
I only chose EFF because they were a non-profit that was irrelevant to the topics of the court

43:43.660 --> 43:44.660
case.

43:44.660 --> 43:49.900
But Jesus Christ, the moon logic of bringing the OTW into this, like, I don't even have

43:49.900 --> 43:51.340
an AO3 account.

43:51.340 --> 43:55.060
I have no contact or affiliation with OTW.

43:55.060 --> 43:59.420
I did reach out to them about this video and they left me on read.

43:59.420 --> 44:05.260
The only connection I have with OTW is I wrote one article for them earlier this year when

44:05.260 --> 44:10.540
my book came out that nobody read and I lost a Hugo to them last year.

44:10.540 --> 44:13.980
For best related work.

44:13.980 --> 44:16.100
You guys deserve to win the Hugo, it's fine.

44:16.100 --> 44:22.540
But the moon logic of even connecting OTW to this case is that Ellis' lawyers hired

44:22.540 --> 44:29.740
Christina Busey as their expert witness on the topic of fanfiction and she happens to

44:29.740 --> 44:36.980
be on the board of OTW.

44:36.980 --> 44:42.700
So this letter definitely does fall into a pattern with regard to people and lawyers,

44:42.700 --> 44:47.700
which is, you know what, the actual client, they're just dupes.

44:47.700 --> 44:49.340
They're ignorant laymen.

44:49.340 --> 44:53.620
You know, we attack the lawyers who are the real masterminds.

44:53.620 --> 44:59.380
In this case, the fact that the EFF has worked with OTW before on completely unrelated things

44:59.540 --> 45:04.340
means that there is a fanfiction deep state keen on taking Addison Cain down.

45:04.340 --> 45:08.580
Pepe Sylvia, Pepe Sylvia, I looked in the mail, well this whole box is Pepe Sylvia!

45:08.580 --> 45:13.260
Well your claim that I am a legally ignorant layman kind of works against all that stuff

45:13.260 --> 45:17.420
that you're so mad about because clearly I don't know what I'm talking about.

45:17.420 --> 45:22.620
My opinions, as expressed in the video, were good faith interpretations of the facts that

45:22.620 --> 45:24.900
I had as I understood them.

45:24.900 --> 45:29.060
And I may not have a law degree, but I do have a little tool you may not have heard

45:29.060 --> 45:30.060
of.

45:30.060 --> 45:31.980
It's called Goomba.

45:31.980 --> 45:37.900
And to claim defamation against a public figure like Addison Cain, you have to show actual

45:37.900 --> 45:44.580
malice that you published with either knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth,

45:44.580 --> 45:45.940
which I did not.

45:45.940 --> 45:50.940
But a lot of the stuff that Addison and her lawyer Taylee are so mad about, well, I got

45:50.940 --> 45:55.620
my interpretation of it actually from lawyers, but not lawyers that I know.

45:55.620 --> 45:59.020
It's from a podcast called All Lawyers Are Bad.

45:59.020 --> 46:04.700
He serves a series of requests for admission, including a key one, which is admit that Cain

46:04.700 --> 46:12.460
misrepresented her involvement with the filing of the DMCA takedown notices against Zoe Ellis.

46:12.460 --> 46:15.980
And the response was, admit it.

46:15.980 --> 46:22.420
Cain was willing to lie her ass off, but the lawyers representing her confronted with

46:22.420 --> 46:28.620
this request to admit did not, and they admitted that in fact she lied, and that she had been

46:28.620 --> 46:32.580
entirely involved in the DMCA's issued into Oklahoma.

46:32.580 --> 46:36.060
Turn down for what?

46:36.060 --> 46:39.700
And they read out loud about as much copyrighted material as I did.

46:39.700 --> 46:45.500
It was necessary, and it will only be beneficial to you if, in your coming estrous cycle, you

46:45.500 --> 46:47.060
should conceal it.

46:47.060 --> 46:51.100
And they were also a lot harsher, going so far as to call Cain things like,

46:51.100 --> 46:52.940
To the profiteering shitheads.

46:52.940 --> 46:56.580
They also use her real name a lot, which I never did.

46:56.580 --> 47:03.220
So I wonder, why did they never get a DMCA takedown notice or emails from her lawyer?

47:03.220 --> 47:04.220
Tell me.

47:04.220 --> 47:08.140
Because if she's attractive, I'm gonna do everything I can to try to make her case.

47:08.140 --> 47:12.580
I have to say, she's, I'm not gonna, I'm just gonna come out, she's hot.

47:12.580 --> 47:13.580
Uh-huh.

47:14.580 --> 47:16.340
I guess that'll do it.

47:16.340 --> 47:17.340
Maybe I should have called her hot.

47:17.340 --> 47:19.300
Well then again, I don't think that would have saved me.

47:19.300 --> 47:25.300
It does not escape my notice that every single person that Cain has allegedly targeted is

47:25.300 --> 47:26.300
a woman.

47:26.300 --> 47:30.540
Poetic, that the charity she wants me to donate to is anti-girl-on-girl bullying.

47:30.540 --> 47:33.900
But wait, you say, maybe she didn't even know about this podcast.

47:33.900 --> 47:36.980
Oh no, mon frere, she did.

47:36.980 --> 47:41.220
And something that one of the guys in the podcast said inspired her to commission fan

47:41.220 --> 47:45.340
art of herself, drinking the blood of her enemies.

47:45.340 --> 47:54.260
Yeah, you know, I'm just having a normal one, sitting on my throne of bones, drinking

47:54.260 --> 48:02.060
the blood of my enemies.

48:02.060 --> 48:05.020
Drinking the blood of her enemies, but she's the bullied one.

48:05.020 --> 48:06.500
Hashtag stand up to bullying.

48:06.500 --> 48:11.100
And then we get to this anti-bullying charity at the end, where it's like trying to gaslight

48:11.100 --> 48:16.660
people into believing that they are the bullies, and that they are the ones with behavior that

48:16.660 --> 48:17.900
needs to be atoned for.

48:17.900 --> 48:19.340
I can't be a bully.

48:19.340 --> 48:22.540
I simply am the person demanding that you be better.

48:22.540 --> 48:25.420
All of those other people making accusations against me?

48:25.420 --> 48:27.540
Well, they were not the bullied ones.

48:27.540 --> 48:29.220
I was the bullied one.

48:29.220 --> 48:30.700
They were the bullies.

48:30.700 --> 48:34.500
Any action I took against them, I had to take it.

48:34.500 --> 48:38.940
It's totally normal that there are so many of them and they all kinda have the same story.

48:38.980 --> 48:44.860
And you ever notice how people who crow about victimhood the loudest tend to be bullies themselves?

48:44.860 --> 48:50.260
Now that said, I did make a couple hundred dollars off of it before it got demonetized.

48:50.260 --> 48:54.660
So as a gesture of good faith, I went ahead and donated the money that would have gone

48:54.660 --> 49:00.060
to EFF to the Kind campaign.

49:00.060 --> 49:01.260
Are we square?

49:01.260 --> 49:03.780
And I don't want this to be the Addison Cain drama channel.

49:03.780 --> 49:08.140
I genuinely hope this is the last video I make on the subject.

49:08.140 --> 49:10.700
By which I mean I hope we don't go to court.

49:10.700 --> 49:14.340
That said, it is petty fandom bullshit, but it does real harm.

49:14.340 --> 49:19.620
In the great Regina George tradition, this does have impact on people's lives.

49:19.620 --> 49:23.500
Every single author that I talk to, except Courtney Milan, said that their careers have

49:23.500 --> 49:30.860
been harmed by everything Addison Cain has done, from DMCA on to petty fandom bullshit.

49:30.860 --> 49:36.220
Now that said, to reiterate myself, don't harass her, goddammit.

49:36.220 --> 49:41.140
She blames me for every single one of you idiots that are shitty to her on social media.

49:41.140 --> 49:47.100
I understand the energy needing to go somewhere, where a quarantine and public shaming is fun.

49:47.100 --> 49:51.160
But if you really want to piss her off, instead of being an asshole on Twitter, support the

49:51.160 --> 49:53.260
authors that she has targeted.

49:53.260 --> 49:57.580
I was really glib about the whole erotica thing in the first video, and I kind of would

49:57.580 --> 49:59.140
like to backtrack that.

49:59.140 --> 50:03.300
Erotica is a real legit genre, and if you're into it, go check them out.

50:03.300 --> 50:04.860
Most of it's ABO.

50:04.860 --> 50:06.420
Not for me.

50:06.420 --> 50:08.940
But it might be for you.

50:08.940 --> 50:09.940
Awoooooo.

50:09.940 --> 50:12.740
Outside of that, there is Courtney Milan.

50:12.740 --> 50:16.940
She just had a book come out that features an Asian hero, and that's something you'd

50:16.940 --> 50:22.940
never see in the US in a traditional romance publishing, so go check her out.

50:22.940 --> 50:27.860
And when I said I'm gonna milk the shit out of this, what of course I meant was merchandise.

50:27.860 --> 50:29.580
And no, I don't actually mean this shirt.

50:29.580 --> 50:31.060
You can't buy this.

50:31.380 --> 50:36.820
Elisa, the comment matriarch, has been crafty lately, so she made this for me and a few

50:36.820 --> 50:38.740
friends as a joke.

50:38.740 --> 50:41.780
But there is some stuff you can buy.

50:41.780 --> 50:45.660
And our good friends at DFTBA were super down with it.

50:45.660 --> 50:50.300
We of course were very inspired by Lindsay Ellis' A Menace, so came up with a Saul Bass

50:50.300 --> 50:52.620
inspired embossed pen you can get.

50:52.620 --> 50:56.260
I'd also love to thank Tammy Watson for coming up with this idea of the fan fiction

50:56.260 --> 50:57.260
deep state.

50:57.260 --> 50:58.740
Just loves it.

50:58.740 --> 51:04.420
Not a direct reference per se, but we were definitely inspired by the myth of the Karen,

51:04.420 --> 51:06.180
let's say.

51:06.180 --> 51:09.420
And finally, my personal favorite, the With Prejudice hat.

51:09.420 --> 51:11.340
Buy it for the lawyer in your life.

51:11.340 --> 51:13.620
They don't need to know the context.

51:13.620 --> 51:16.380
And if you do know the context, it's very funny.

51:16.380 --> 51:21.420
So enjoy our dumb merch, and join the hashtag fan fiction deep state.

51:21.420 --> 51:23.100
One last thing before we go.

51:23.460 --> 51:29.060
Patreon is a membership service, and my patrons are charged not by the content unit, but by

51:29.060 --> 51:30.060
the month.

51:30.060 --> 51:33.580
So if someone wanted to get into the weeds of monetization, they should understand that

51:33.580 --> 51:40.420
people who give money to my Patreon are effectively paying for membership to me, which includes

51:40.420 --> 51:42.940
certain perks, i.e. name in credits.

51:42.940 --> 51:48.380
They are not paying for the content itself, they are in effect paying membership dues.

51:48.940 --> 51:54.060
And ain't no ads on this video, so it is going unmonetized.

51:54.060 --> 51:58.580
And while we're here, I'd like to thank the fine folks at Patreon for supporting creators,

51:58.580 --> 52:05.420
standing up for fair use, and for being all around a bunch of really solid menches.

52:05.420 --> 52:06.220
Thanks for watching.

53:19.380 --> 53:23.380
Which is the opposite of digital privacy.

53:23.380 --> 53:24.380
Wow.
