00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,660
Miss Ellis, my firm represents Addison Cain.

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,760
We are aware of your recent YouTube video and other postings related to lawsuits involving

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,760
my client.

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,760
In your video, you used my client's copyrighted content and made numerous false claims including

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,440
statements from allegations made in the lawsuits that were not based on evidence or facts.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,920
These false statements include the following allegations.

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:33,080
1. That my client claimed to own tropes and that was what the DMCA's at issue were about.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,360
2. That my client blackmailed Zoe Ellis.

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,240
3. That Miss Cain's publisher settled due to Miss Cain's perjury in Oklahoma.

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:47,360
4. That Miss Cain committed perjury and 5. That the other lawsuits in Virginia died for

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,120
unrelated reasons.

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,120
These statements are entirely false and defamatory.

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,880
No proof was ever provided by Miss Ellis or her company in the lawsuits about any of these

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,880
issues.

15
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,440
While my client was accused of perjury by Miss Ellis' company, the basis of that claim

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,800
was never argued before court and Miss Cain never misrepresented any facts to the court.

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,340
Her previous publisher filed the DMCA's and no DMCA's were sent by Miss Cain to Oklahoma.

18
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,680
An accurate account of the various lawsuits may be viewed on my client's Facebook page

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,960
if you are interested in a factual account instead of spreading the previous lies and

20
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,760
inaccuracies spread by Quill, Zoe Ellis, Courtney Milan and others.

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,160
We believe that your video violates the terms and services of your Patreon account as it

22
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,440
clearly includes abusive content and uses my client's content.

23
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,680
My client is currently receiving threats, hate mail, and other harassing posts due to

24
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,820
your video.

25
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,520
We demand that you remove or correct the video immediately.

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:52,200
Regards, Tina Watson

27
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
Welcome back.

28
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,360
Now, if you didn't see my previous video about the so-called Omegaverse lawsuit, I suggest

29
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,320
you go ahead and do that now.

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,600
It's Tiger King for her.

31
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,760
And also, engage with it.

32
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Give it a like.

33
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
Give it a comment.

34
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:12,200
Because the algorithm was not kind to that one and it did not show up in most subscribers'

35
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,200
recommendations.

36
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Hmm.

37
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
Weird.

38
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,860
In fact, while you're here, go ahead and give this a like.

39
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,860
Give it a comment.

40
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,040
Give it several comments.

41
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,640
Get in fights in the comments.

42
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,360
Drive that engagement.

43
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
Because this...

44
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,560
Well, I don't want to say this is war, but...

45
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,880
Honey, you've got a big storm coming.

46
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:39,400
Now let me start by saying that I had never intended to make this video at all.

47
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,200
Like most of my videos, except for Game of Thrones, which I will die mad about.

48
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,960
Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something.

49
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,260
That's whinging.

50
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,680
That was supposed to be one and done.

51
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,640
But then someone had to go and get me involved in the whole thing.

52
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,480
Now one way or the other, I had to take September off in order to finish revisions on my second

53
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,000
book, which is out next fall.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,480
It's called Truth of the Divine.

55
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,480
You can...

56
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,960
Well, not available for pre-order yet.

57
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
I don't know.

58
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
I'll pimp it later.

59
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,320
But also, a lot went down in the month of September and there was a lot of documentation

60
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,940
that I had to go through in order to cobble together as coherent a narrative as I'm about

61
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,300
to attempt to make.

62
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,640
Now before we get started, a note.

63
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,960
Yes, despite my costume, this is not theater.

64
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,040
This is all real.

65
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,220
This is really happening.

66
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:30,640
And that also said, Addison Cain and I are both regrettably, technically, public figures.

67
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,000
Now that said, despite my request that you do not harass this woman from the last video,

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,640
some of you were shitty anyway.

69
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,720
And I get that we're all bored and losing our minds and that like, you know, cancelling

70
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,280
is fun now.

71
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,880
But again, I'd like to ask you to not.

72
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,880
Like this guy.

73
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,720
Like, we don't need to bring her shitty book into it.

74
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,200
I know I'm not on the hook if any of you idiots post cringe in her ats or on her Facebook

75
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,300
page, but it is, as the kids say, a bad look.

76
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,960
Now that said, with regard to the last video, I feel like I was pretty even-handed with

77
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,400
the criticisms I made and the conclusions I drew.

78
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,760
And I definitely withheld a lot of criticisms and comments about Addison Cain because I

79
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,480
was concerned that they might be a little unnecessarily mean.

80
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,200
But trust, I feel no such obligation this time.

81
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,840
So before we get into this, a refresher on the Dramatis Personae.

82
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,500
Addison Cain, not her real name, erotica author who claims to have spearheaded the concept

83
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:36,880
of Het Omegaverse, or ABO, and who has a knack for accusing her fellow authors of plagiarism

84
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,460
because her ideas are just that good.

85
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,080
Because I am your alpha.

86
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,480
It was almost a roar.

87
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,000
You want to be f***ed by me.

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,280
Do you understand?

89
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,600
Zoe Ellis, also not her real name and one of the alleged plagiarists, who in 2018 sued

90
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,240
Addison Cain for alleged abusive DMCA takedown notices.

91
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,920
She is also, in my opinion, correct.

92
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,800
Those takedown notices were illegal and abusive.

93
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,640
Blushing Books, Addison Cain's former publisher, who gleefully threw themselves in front of

94
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:15,720
the bus for Addison Cain during the lawsuit, only to be hilariously betrayed by her and

95
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,880
backstabbed later, and she hates them now, and they are also on her eternity quest for

96
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
revenge.

97
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
Patreon.

98
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,880
Yes, really.

99
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,680
The crowdfunding website that my company relies on for most of our income.

100
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,960
YouTube.

101
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
This hell space.

102
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,960
The Electronic Frontier Foundation.

103
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,080
The leading legal non-profit defending digital privacy, free speech, and innovation that

104
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,100
I plugged at the end of the last video.

105
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,840
And also my lawyers.

106
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:50,980
Taniyah Watson, a lawyer, shown here getting brunch with her client Addison Cain in a public

107
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,460
Facebook post that somebody wanted me to see.

108
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,460
Actually several posts.

109
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,500
Like, yeah, you know, I'm just getting lunch with my lawyer, you know, so just some girls

110
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,860
talking about copyright law, gal pals.

111
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,140
So that crazy month of September, what happened?

112
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,300
So the video went public early on September 3rd.

113
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,620
I was trying to get away from it, again, that was supposed to be revision month.

114
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:20,360
But later that day, I get this email from Taniyah Watson saying all that weird shit.

115
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,100
Like yes, I am a barred lawyer in the state of Oklahoma.

116
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,760
If you want the truth, go to my client's Facebook page.

117
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:33,340
Why should you go to jail for a crime someone else noticed?

118
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,760
You don't need double talk.

119
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,760
You need blah blah blah.

120
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
Blah blah blah.

121
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,760
No habla espanol.

122
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,780
The thing about it is, this email didn't have any, like, thread of litigation in it.

123
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,220
It wasn't like, take it down or else, or take it down or we'll sue.

124
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,220
It was just take it down, gal pals.

125
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,340
So I decided to milk that for some content because it was indeed very funny.

126
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,340
I posted it to Twitter and decided to move on.

127
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,940
But of course, that was not the end of it.

128
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,460
The following day, I get an email from the head of legal at Patreon, Colin Sullivan.

129
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:12,300
You see, Addison Cain has sent a DMCA takedown notice to Patreon demanding that I take the

130
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,740
post about Omegaverse down.

131
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,540
Honestly, yeah, I was kind of surprised.

132
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:24,540
Like, the entire video was about how dumb and abusive and transparently flimsy her DMCA

133
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,540
case was.

134
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,660
But shh, we're still doing this, I guess.

135
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,020
So what Addison Cain apparently even failed to consider is that, unlike companies like

136
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,540
Amazon and YouTube, Patreon is not a giant faceless conglomerate.

137
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,860
Not only am I one of Patreon's top creators, so of course they're going to investigate

138
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,940
any wrongdoing I'm accused of, they also took the time to watch the video and found the

139
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,980
whole situation a touch ironic.

140
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,580
So I talked with the legal team at Patreon for a while.

141
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,020
We discussed some options and what we decided was that they, in order to not be on the hook

142
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:04,220
legally just in case litigation came down the pike, we will honor that DMCA takedown

143
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,220
notice.

144
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:15,460
And all that meant was I had to unlink the YouTube URL from the Patreon post for 10 days

145
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,060
and then relink it.

146
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:25,620
So I send the DMCA counter notice and Patreon basically tells Addison Cain and her lawyer

147
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,140
that they have 10 days to sue me or I can do whatever I want with the content.

148
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,860
And here's the thing, despite my years and years of doing this, I've never actually gotten

149
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,020
a DMCA takedown notice before.

150
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:41,140
But here's the other thing, Patreon was so, I guess the word was offended that she thought

151
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:49,980
this would work, that they were like, hey, if you were to, I don't know, end up in court

152
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:59,820
one way or the other, we would stand behind you and, you know, maybe fund your legal fees.

153
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,180
Like that would be a first.

154
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,900
Now during this whole time, despite all of these behind the scenes machinations, publicly

155
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,380
she's weirdly quiet about the whole thing.

156
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,700
She has to this date not said anything on her Twitter or her public Facebook or her

157
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,700
private Facebook.

158
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:18,700
However, on September 5th, rather than say something about me, she instead redirects

159
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,340
her ire and her fans to another author.

160
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,660
And we will get to that too.

161
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,380
And although I cannot say for certain that she had anything to do with this, other strange

162
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,340
goings on happened with that video and my channel in general.

163
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:39,660
Somebody reported the ads as having violence and terrorism in it and full nudity and YouTube

164
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,420
review was like, yeah, that checks out.

165
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,660
So I had to demonetize the thing.

166
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,500
Someone reported the URL to Twitter, meaning that sometimes when the URL popped up, it

167
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,580
would be clocked as not safe.

168
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,980
And someone was reporting the video, meaning that it was age restricted as recently as

169
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,980
last week since lifted.

170
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:04,580
But maybe that's all just a huge coincidence, even though none of those things have ever

171
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,900
happened to me before.

172
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,300
In my 10 years of doing this, big old coincidence.

173
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,820
During this time, Addison Cain also hires a PR person.

174
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,700
And on September 9th, she emails entertainment journalist Kaylee Donaldson asking if she

175
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,500
wants to softball an interview with Addison Cain.

176
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,860
Kaylee, of course, posted this email to Twitter and it was very funny.

177
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:31,020
We privately speculated that it was maybe because she was a known fan of the morally

178
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,540
questionable monster love genre.

179
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:41,300
But because of that, one of the very last book reviews she did was of my book.

180
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,860
So I know what you're all thinking.

181
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:48,940
She sends a DMCA takedown notice to Patreon, but not to YouTube.

182
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,940
Why?

183
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,700
And we puzzled over this.

184
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,340
Why go for Patreon?

185
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,900
The content is not hosted on Patreon.

186
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,620
It's hosted on YouTube and Nebula.

187
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,980
Well, it turns out she did go for YouTube.

188
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:09,020
On Friday, September 11th, I get an email from YouTube saying, hey, someone sent us

189
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,500
a DMCA takedown notice.

190
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,420
We looked into it and we think it's bogus.

191
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,740
Because we think this probably falls under fair use.

192
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,820
So we're going to ignore it.

193
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,940
I have never heard of this ever happening, of YouTube actually getting a DMCA takedown

194
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:37,380
notice and saying, no.

195
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,100
Because as we discussed in the last video, that puts YouTube possibly legally liable

196
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,540
if Wolfcock Karen decides to start suing people.

197
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,900
But as we have already learned, when a platform gets a DMCA takedown notice, they have to

198
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:56,180
send the notice to the person being accused of copyright infringement.

199
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:04,740
Meaning, I got the letter that Addison Cain sent YouTube and...

200
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,500
To whom it may concern.

201
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,660
The work infringed is not fair use.

202
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,060
My book is not public domain.

203
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,220
It is a creative work, not a textbook.

204
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,980
The poster reads my books to degrade my work.

205
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:25,540
This is not fair use of a copyrighted work, nor was this video a review of my work.

206
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,260
It was a personal attack.

207
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:32,900
The poster significantly transformed my original work, both by altering the work and by mocking

208
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,540
it for the poster's financial gain via YouTube and Patreon.

209
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,260
Monetizing the video does not make this fair use.

210
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:47,020
Furthermore, this poster, in regards to her video, refers to the necessity of blurring

211
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,740
out the face of my child as DAMN BABY on Twitter.

212
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,180
Tweet attached.

213
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:58,020
The baby in question's safety has already been threatened via the lawsuit this video

214
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,780
monopolizes upon.

215
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:04,940
Photos of my daughter and how to find my address under my real name, not pseudonym,

216
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,380
were made public.

217
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,100
Those documents were sealed by the court.

218
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:16,820
I feel Lindsay Ellis is a menace, a threat to my child, and is monetizing defamation

219
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,380
for personal, financial gain.

220
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,620
Oh, I am gonna milk the shit out of that.

221
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:38,220
Alright, let's, uh, break this bat-shittery down, shall we?

222
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,900
Yes, I'm still wearing the falsies.

223
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,700
Like, this is as much effort as you're gonna get look-wise.

224
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,020
This isn't ContraPoints.

225
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,620
Because I don't want this to be an hour of pwnage.

226
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,780
This is an opportunity.

227
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,140
We can make this a learning experience.

228
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,580
So, uh, let's break this apart.

229
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,460
My book is not public domain.

230
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,980
It is a creative work, not a textbook.

231
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:05,420
Copyrighted material is copyrighted material, whether it's an educational textbook or

232
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,420
wolf porn.

233
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,380
That said, the sum total of Kane's work that we used was about 400 words.

234
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,100
Um, about two minutes out of an hour-long video.

235
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,860
The poster reads my books to degrade my work.

236
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,900
This is not fair use of a copyrighted work, nor was this video a review of my work.

237
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,380
Yeah, I don't really do reviews.

238
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,860
Uh, fair use actually encompasses a lot more than that.

239
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,860
That said, we didn't just include copyrighted material for shits and giggles.

240
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:39,420
We included it in order to give examples of the content that was being fought over.

241
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:44,860
It was a personal attack, framed around two lawsuits filed against me personally, in which

242
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,860
the poster did not like the outcomes in court.

243
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:55,340
I mean, I know it feels personal, maybe, but I didn't say anything about Addison Kane

244
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,020
outside of what was relevant to the court case.

245
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:04,700
The reason I came down the way I did was because I looked at the evidence and was like, hmm,

246
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,660
there's kind of a clear right and wrong side here.

247
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,580
That said, we seem to be in disagreement of what the outcomes even were, and I'll get

248
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,580
to that later.

249
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:18,340
Furthermore, my work has been altered, words blacked out, thus creating work product the

250
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,060
poster did not have permission to create.

251
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,060
I, uh, I don't usually ask for permission.

252
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:30,540
When people talk about fair use, they usually restrict it to educational purposes, criticism,

253
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:37,140
and parody, and they don't seem to think that it can exist outside of that, but it actually

254
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,540
does go further.

255
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,260
The other key word here is transformative, and that's sort of the ironic thing with her

256
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:49,460
letter at all, is she's upset that I did a dramatic reading of her work and blacked out

257
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:55,380
some of the words, thereby transforming it, lending more credence to fair use.

258
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,740
Monetizing the video does not make this fair use.

259
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,300
Uh, it doesn't actually have anything to do with whether it's monetized or not.

260
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:11,020
Like, it being commercial kind of works against the argument, but you can monetize things

261
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:16,220
and it still be fair use, you know, reviewers and critics have careers.

262
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:22,940
Now the reason why monetizing your content can work against fair use isn't because, like,

263
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,380
it's, you know, commercial and nonprofits are better or more moral or something.

264
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,740
It has to do with the market for the original copyrighted material.

265
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:37,640
The standard when you make money off of someone else's copyrighted material is does this substitute

266
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,260
or destroy the original market?

267
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:46,200
And a YouTube video about a court case isn't going to substitute the market for erotica.

268
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,120
Does my monetizing this content destroy her market?

269
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,040
And the answer is obviously no.

270
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,560
The only way you could argue that I would harm the market is if I made the book look

271
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,080
bad by saying it's bad and that's fair use.

272
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,240
There's nothing you can do about that.

273
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,120
Criticism does not count as destroying the market, uh, even though I didn't actually

274
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,880
criticize her dumb book.

275
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,960
But while we're on this subject, I did have some empathy for Addison Cain before the video

276
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:21,640
went up because as a New York Times bestselling author, I do actually know what it's like

277
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,760
for people to shit on your book and monetize them shitting on your book.

278
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,660
I know what it's like for some of these people to shit on your book while getting tens of

279
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,980
thousands of views.

280
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,480
And if you want to go outside the book stuff, I know what it's like for a lot of people

281
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,440
to personally target me to the tune of hundreds of thousands, if not millions of views.

282
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,840
It sucks.

283
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,840
It really fucking sucks.

284
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,480
But here's the thing, it's not copyright infringement and technically it's not illegal.

285
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,920
I can't really even claim that it's defamation, which is ironic because every time one of

286
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,920
those dipshits videos get taken down, they think I did it like I've even fucking watched

287
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
any of them.

288
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,920
No one cares about your response video, Gary.

289
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,920
But that is the thing.

290
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,320
People can monetize themselves saying shit about you that you don't like.

291
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,640
And if you're a public figure, there is not a lot you can do about it unless they say

292
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,320
something that is objectively, patently untrue.

293
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
And even then, it's still an uphill battle.

294
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
Sucks, huh?

295
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:28,680
So as I said, no, I did not actually think that the subject of a video that I made about

296
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:36,520
a person known for making bad faith DMCA takedown notices would make a bad faith takedown DMCA

297
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:44,520
but I don't know, maybe there's, I don't know, there's some, I feel like there's a term for

298
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,520
this.

299
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,520
Some sort of effect.

300
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:53,520
I just, I don't know, I've been listening to the wavy word of the mind.

301
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,400
Okay, let's look at the allegations.

302
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,440
That my client claimed to own tropes and that was what the DMCA's at issue were about.

303
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,440
No I didn't.

304
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,400
Two, that my client blackmailed Zoe Ellis.

305
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,920
Wow, no, no I didn't even a little bit allege that.

306
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,360
I don't know where the hell you got that.

307
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,920
That Miss Kane's publisher settled due to Miss Kane's perjury in Oklahoma.

308
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,800
Yeah, about the perjury thing, I guess you could say I implied it, but I didn't say it.

309
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:25,320
I did say what actually did happen was that the plaintiff accused Kane of perjuring herself

310
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,400
and then three days later, a judgment was filed by the court.

311
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,040
And this was one mistake I did make.

312
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,440
You see, there was no settlement.

313
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,940
It was not a settlement.

314
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,940
It was a judgment.

315
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,960
A judgment is an official designation that is entered on a court's docket that designates

316
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:49,000
that a plaintiff has prevailed against the defendant in a court case.

317
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,720
Plaintiff in the Oklahoma case, Quill Inc.'s books, prevailed over the defendant blushing

318
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
books.

319
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,520
There was no settlement.

320
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,080
That was my mistake.

321
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,440
Sorry, Addison.

322
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,560
But the other lawsuits in Virginia died for unrelated reasons.

323
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,400
It did close for unrelated reasons.

324
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,000
The Oklahoma case was closed after blushing books, admitting wrongdoing, and the Virginia

325
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,480
case was closed for lack of prosecution.

326
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,880
These things had nothing to do with each other.

327
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,640
They were completely unrelated.

328
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,720
But one thing I have not really touched on yet is the letter that Tanya Watson had sent

329
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,720
to Patreon.

330
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,880
To whom it may concern.

331
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,160
My firm represents Addison Cain.

332
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,360
Miss Cain is a well-known author.

333
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,200
Recently, one of your users posted co-

334
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
Okay, here's the thing.

335
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,640
It's not substantive enough to be, like, you know, fun to read the way the other one was,

336
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,040
so I'm just gonna break it down.

337
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,200
Due to the content, my client has received hate mail and attacks on social media.

338
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,800
I have a good faith belief that the material I am reporting is not authorized by the copyright

339
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,400
owner, an agent of the owner, or the law.

340
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,000
If you really do have a good faith belief that this is copyright infringement, I find

341
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,040
it interesting that you would mention defamation or harassment at all, because those things

342
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:12,320
do not have anything to do with whether or not my use of the 400 words of Born to be

343
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,640
Bound was copyright infringement.

344
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,120
Lens v. Universal Music Corp. 2016, the fair use of a copyrighted work for purposes such

345
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:26,520
as criticism, comment, news reporting, or teaching is not an infringement, and is therefore

346
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,640
wholly authorized by the law.

347
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,240
Recently, one of your users posted content that includes excerpts of my client's work

348
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,640
that were posted without her permission, along with numerous false claims and defamatory

349
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,880
statements.

350
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,260
It does not work like that.

351
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,400
You hurt my feelings, ipso facto copyright infringement.

352
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,240
That's not how copyright works.

353
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,040
Copyright infringement is infringement whether your feelings are hurt or not.

354
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:59,640
I actually kind of like this wolf hat.

355
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,200
I'm like, I'm going to start wearing this.

356
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
It's got pockets.

357
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,760
None of my clothes do.

358
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,760
Paws.

359
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,640
Furry solidarity.

360
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,800
So that's just me, but what about everybody else?

361
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,600
What about the other, um, I don't want to say victims, targets of Addison Cain's disdain,

362
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,960
shall we say?

363
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,600
Well, first and most obvious is Zoe Ellis, who filed the original lawsuit, who alleges

364
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:29,000
that Cain's publisher at the direction of Cain filed dozens of DMCA takedown notices.

365
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,800
Is that specific enough for you?

366
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,720
I mean, she does also allege that Cain herself sent some of them, but we're keeping it simple.

367
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,920
But that wasn't all there was to it when we're talking about the defamation side of the lawsuit.

368
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:45,040
Basically, Ellis also alleges that Cain spent a lot of time and effort shit-talking her

369
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,040
to the community.

370
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:50,600
And since we're talking about self-published erotica, authors kind of live and die a lot

371
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,800
more on networking than they do on the traditional side.

372
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,240
And so if Addison Cain is running around in all these like Omegaverse Facebook groups

373
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:04,160
saying like, hey, this woman is plagiarizing me, that's kind of a bad look for the accused.

374
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,720
Then there is an author, Nora Ashe, who was an early proponent of Zoe Ellis when she was

375
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,800
first entering authoredom.

376
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,960
And this is another mistake slash redaction I need to make.

377
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:20,360
Patricia Briggs, who I said was the first Omegaverse author, was not actually that.

378
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,520
She wrote kind of werewolfy stuff.

379
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,360
You know, there was like some, obviously it was called Alpha and Omega, but like it didn't

380
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,200
have most of the tropes that we associate with ABO.

381
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:39,320
The first hit commercial Omegaverse author was Nora Ashe, not Addison Cain.

382
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:44,480
Part of her crime was being an early champion of Zoe Ellis, but another part of it was the

383
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:51,600
fact that she repeatedly pointed out that she was the first commercially published Omegaverse

384
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,600
hit author.

385
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,200
God, this is like, the specificity is really important in the erotica wars, okay?

386
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,160
Anyway, Nora Ashe alleges that Cain also threw her clout around to damage her brand within

387
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,240
the author community.

388
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,380
And then there's Lee Savino.

389
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,040
And now we're getting into like the really wild shit.

390
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,040
Lee Savino does not write ABO.

391
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:14,280
She's more in the vein of dark werewolfy romance sort of thing.

392
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,760
Also a former friend of Addison Cain, as so many of these women are.

393
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,040
And I'm not exactly clear on when Addison Cain decided that Lee Savino was actually

394
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,520
in the enemy's camp, in this grand conspiracy against her.

395
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,880
But the long and short is that Cain decided that Lee Savino knew damning things about

396
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,500
Zoe Ellis and Nora Ashe.

397
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,940
And so she subpoenaed Lee Savino in her counterclaim in the Virginia lawsuit.

398
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,260
So you remember how earlier I mentioned that she didn't say anything about my video, but

399
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,620
instead redirected her ire to another author?

400
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,780
Well, this is that author, and here's what she said.

401
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:55,580
It is extremely expensive to subpoena someone in a lawsuit.

402
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:01,780
Myself and my reputable attorneys would never do so frivolously or vindictively.

403
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:07,340
Regrettably, we were forced to subpoena Lee Savino because she has in her possession highly

404
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,340
relevant information to the lawsuit brought against me.

405
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,580
There is a reason she was subpoenaed.

406
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:18,780
She and I are both aware of it, and if she continues to make inflammatory statements

407
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,820
against my character, I will make what I know public.

408
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:28,220
Thing is, I do have a copy of that subpoena, and I have absolutely no problem making public

409
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,580
what she thinks is such a big deal.

410
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:35,460
Of course, it was like long-winding conspiratorial nonsense, but the long and short is that she

411
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:42,900
demanded that Lee Savino produce all documents relating to Margarita Cole, Eva Dresden, and

412
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:49,060
remember those names, we'll get to them, Addison Cain, Zoe Ellis, and Nora Ash.

413
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:53,300
The latter two, again, are both in the UK and are harder to get information on.

414
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,660
Oh, but that's not all.

415
00:25:54,660 --> 00:26:00,380
Lee Savino is also a plagiarist, but she didn't copy a plot.

416
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,900
She copied a, uh, character.

417
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:07,420
So here's part of the letter that Tammy Watson sent Lee Savino when they were forced to drop

418
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,340
the counterclaim in Virginia.

419
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:13,900
We are writing to inform you that my client has decided to move to dismiss her counterclaim

420
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,060
in the above-referenced lawsuit.

421
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:20,260
My client wishes to put these matters behind her and would appreciate if your client would

422
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:25,180
either return the witch character at issue and remove her from Miss Savino's Berserker

423
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,180
series.

424
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,180
Return the witch!

425
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:31,900
Considering the history and Miss Savino's use of my client's character, we request that

426
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:37,060
Miss Cain's books are no longer used as the inspiration for ghostwriters to emulate.

427
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,660
Like I cannot read her mind, I don't know what's in her heart, but according to her,

428
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:45,540
this is a character she's been writing for like 10 years and she has no idea where Cain

429
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:50,620
decided that this character and this character alone was plagiarized from one of Cain's books.

430
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:56,020
Oh, and Addison Cain also accused Savino of reporting her Facebook ads to Facebook as

431
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,140
being inappropriate.

432
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,860
Huge, if true.

433
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:05,780
Then there's author Ava Dresden, also an author in this community, also subpoenaed in the

434
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:11,180
Virginia case, basically the exact same shit, like give me dirt on this, this, this, and

435
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,180
this person.

436
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,420
So Dresden takes this seriously and has to hire a lawyer and ends up spending a ton of

437
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:24,980
money on this whole nonsense thing only to have Cain drop the subpoena when Quill gets

438
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,060
dismissed from the Virginia case for lack of prosecution.

439
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:33,940
Courtney Milan is not an Omegaverse author, but is fairly well known in the more traditional

440
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,660
historical romance community.

441
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:40,780
And so Milan basically got involved in this when someone reached out to her like, hey,

442
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,220
you're a lawyer, what do you think of this whole thing?

443
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:48,740
And Milan looked at it and she opined on Twitter basically that she thought Cain was in the

444
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:53,460
wrong and this is obviously not plagiarism, it's just too broad, it's too tropey, this

445
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,900
is sans affair, this is not how plagiarism works.

446
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:01,380
And so Milan, a person that Cain has never really interacted with or talked to, is now

447
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,260
also on the list of eternity vengeance quest.

448
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:10,260
Here she is harassing Milan on Twitter, here she is dragging Milan on her personal Facebook.

449
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,340
I have been one of Courtney Milan's favorite punching bags over the years.

450
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,340
Why?

451
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,260
In the beginning, I didn't know.

452
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:21,740
I still don't know why she was comfortable saying the things she said without any form

453
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:28,060
of proof or taking the time to afford a fellow human the courtesy of due diligence.

454
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:33,980
Authors are afraid of Courtney Milan, and I understand why better than most.

455
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:39,680
To all the others she has bullied without respecting the community and seeking fact,

456
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,020
I am so sorry.

457
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:49,300
I know what it feels like to be trampled, ignored, and attacked for sport, but we don't

458
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,500
need to be afraid of bullies.

459
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,380
Not when we have each other.

460
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:57,740
Not when we have kindness and the support of a community we love.

461
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,060
Not when we have THE TRUTH.

462
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,180
Hashtag RWA.

463
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,100
Hashtag stand up to bullying.

464
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,220
Here's Toni Watson mentioning her in her letter to me.

465
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:12,940
The previous lies and inaccuracies spread by Quill, Zoe Ellis, Courtney Milan, and others.

466
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:18,020
And here is the formal ethics complaint Cain filed against Courtney Milan with the Romance

467
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,820
Writers of America.

468
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:24,940
Formal Ethics Complaint against Courtney Milan to Romance Writers of America.

469
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:32,100
To whom it may concern, I have recently learned that Courtney Milan serves on the RWA Ethics

470
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,100
Committee.

471
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:38,620
The high level of trust authors must place in the RWA to operate with integrity leads

472
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:44,860
me to file this complaint against Ms. Milan for poor and unethical behavior.

473
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:50,860
On March 12, 2019, Courtney Milan posted statements about me and a lawsuit against

474
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:59,380
me to her 37.9k Twitter followers after I was sent to her by the RWA for assistance.

475
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:05,380
These posts were not based on fact or evidence, but merely on the allegations in a lawsuit

476
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,860
which had just been initiated.

477
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:12,900
And as someone who markets herself as a legal expert, she did not take the time to research

478
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,780
the allegations she recklessly tweeted.

479
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:21,300
Thanks to Courtney's carelessness, unsubstantiated slander was spread to the point I received

480
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:29,300
threatening messages.

481
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:35,140
After her tweets, many members of the community I loved and dedicated readers turned on me,

482
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,260
taking her factually unsupported posts at face value.

483
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:44,580
Once again, I request RWA sanction Courtney Milan and remove her from the Ethics Board

484
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,260
and any affiliation with RWA.

485
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:52,060
Sincerely, Addison Cain, Membership ID 31817.

486
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,820
Is there no manager she won't complain to?

487
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:59,500
To be clear, all of this sturm und drang is because Courtney Milan, who has a pretty solid

488
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:06,300
base of legal knowledge, expressed an opinion about the court case on Twitter.com.

489
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,500
She never said anything about Cain as a person.

490
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:17,220
So what's funny to me about this Twitter exchange is that Milan, despite having a law degree,

491
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,820
can't really understand what's going on because she's not a barred lawyer, meaning she's not

492
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:30,620
practicing, but Addison Cain, who thinks monetizing content exempts it from fair use, is the legalist

493
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,100
expert that ever legaled.

494
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,000
Oh, but one other funny thing that happened just as I was editing this is I got an email

495
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,360
from Courtney Milan saying, hey, I actually remembered who it was that originally reached

496
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,400
out to me about the Omegaverse lawsuit.

497
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,960
And wouldn't you know, it was Addison Cain.

498
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,080
Well, that backfired.

499
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,280
Margarita Cole.

500
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,280
This is Zoe Ellis's lawyer.

501
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:59,840
Now Cole is a lawyer that represents a lot of authors in like IP and like rights and

502
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,840
stuff.

503
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,080
She's like that kind of lawyer, formerly a bankruptcy lawyer.

504
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,900
This comes into it, believe it or not.

505
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:10,540
Now, according to Cole, she originally got involved with Zoe Ellis by getting onto one

506
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,300
of her mailing lists.

507
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,180
And then eventually they started talking about rights and stuff.

508
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,900
Then Zoe Ellis reached out to her whenever she started getting all these DMCA takedown

509
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,900
notices.

510
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:24,260
Now I bring this whole up because Cain has repeatedly alleged that Margarita Cole has

511
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:30,840
had like this weird, obsessive vendetta against Addison Cain for years, saw an opportunity

512
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:36,800
with Zoe Ellis and all these DMCA takedowns and is therefore the mastermind of this whole

513
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,800
thing.

514
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,200
And kind of like Milan, she's does the thing where she's like, well, you're a bankruptcy

515
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,200
lawyer.

516
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,780
How can you possibly know about copyright infringement?

517
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:50,840
And this is kind of a running theme with Cain's aspersions against people.

518
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:57,240
Like Milan isn't barred, therefore she cannot opine on the whole case unless it's in favor

519
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,480
of Cain.

520
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,120
And Margarita Cole doesn't know what she's doing because she was a bankruptcy lawyer

521
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,960
at some point in history, even though she's not anymore.

522
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,540
Oh, but that's not all.

523
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:15,760
Blushing Books and Addison Cain alleges Margarita Cole, covering my ass, has filed three bar

524
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,040
complaints against this woman over the last two years.

525
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,680
And I know I have to say alleged to cover my ass, but like I do have a copy of one of

526
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,600
these bar complaints and it was Blushing that filed it and it was during the freaking

527
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
lawsuit.

528
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,840
So they filed a bar complaint against an opposing lawyer as ongoing litigation was happening.

529
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,840
Ethics.

530
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,080
And again, it is this sort of conspiracy, like she read an art she didn't like and she's

531
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,240
been trying to take down Addison Cain for years.

532
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:50,520
And also she's got like 80 sock puppets and here are examples of all of them, ergo bar

533
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,520
complaint.

534
00:33:51,520 --> 00:34:00,720
And again, according to Cole, a new bar complaint was filed by Addison Cain on August 26, 2020.

535
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,040
Less than two months ago.

536
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,880
And finally, surprisingly, Blushing Books.

537
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,760
So Blushing has alleged that Addison Cain was the person who reported them to the RWA

538
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,040
and is therefore the reason they are on advocacy alert.

539
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,520
Now we reached out to the RWA to confirm that and they declined to comment because they

540
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,420
don't give names for that sort of thing.

541
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:28,060
But based on an email that Blushing sent to Courtney Milan, the only romance lawyer,

542
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,540
they do believe it was Cain.

543
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:34,220
And of course, Cain made all sorts of wild allegations against Blushing, including like

544
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,620
book burning and breach of contract, bit, bit, bit, bit, bit.

545
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:51,340
How many of you have ever felt personally victimized by Regina George?

546
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,260
So why bring all of this up?

547
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:58,540
Well, originally, this video was meant to be sort of a learning experience about copyright.

548
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,180
But obviously this isn't about copyright.

549
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:06,060
Some people just want other people to shut up.

550
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,700
And sometimes she uses copyright law to do it.

551
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:14,620
But most of the time she doesn't like the way she uses this word defamation just so

552
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,620
eagerly.

553
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:22,020
I'm reminded of the way that El Presidente is just so eager to expand libel laws in the

554
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,700
US to be like the ones in the UK.

555
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,500
So really, this isn't even about copyright law anymore.

556
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,860
And it never was.

557
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,500
It's about deplatforming.

558
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,980
Cain has people she doesn't like.

559
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,420
She wants to deplatform them.

560
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,260
Just sometimes she uses the DMCA to do it.

561
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,980
And I think this is really interesting because while I think she's wrong and is definitely

562
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:47,780
abusing systems that are in place to protect people, it does kinda highlight a major problem,

563
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,860
which is that platforms don't really care about abuse.

564
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,500
They don't care about harassment.

565
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,820
And before you go there Addison, no, by no meaningful definition, legal or ethical, does

566
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,900
this count as defamation, abuse, or harassment.

567
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,900
Dammit.

568
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,940
However, as someone who has multiple times been on the wrong side of coordinated harassment

569
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:09,820
campaigns and is also friends with people who have gone through way, way worse, including

570
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:16,300
having to move, sometimes move cities, I feel like I can say with some certainty that platforms

571
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,820
don't take harassment seriously.

572
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,220
But you know what they do take seriously?

573
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,540
Copyright.

574
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:26,820
As if for instance, here again we have the President of the United States sharing a bad

575
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,260
meme using Nickelback's photograph.

576
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:33,820
Well Nickelback was successful in getting that tweet taken down because they filed a

577
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,820
DMCA takedown.

578
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:41,140
Similarly, there are examples of counter-protesters blasting copyrighted music at alt-right rallies

579
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:46,340
so it can't get uploaded in its raw form and will also therefore be taken down.

580
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:50,980
Which, while effective, also swings in the other direction because counter-protesters

581
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:56,540
have been known to do that to, for instance, BLM using the exact same tactic.

582
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:01,700
The pendulum swings both ways, and even in the Nickelback case, while ethically good

583
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:07,460
for them, I honestly don't think that counts as copyright infringement.

584
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:14,820
It's a dumb shitty meme, but I think that, personally, it's transformative enough that

585
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,860
it would count as fair use.

586
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:21,940
If it were taken to court, oh god, I'm imagining that, no, please, no.

587
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:26,100
So it really is no wonder that there are people who feel like copyright law and the DMCA is

588
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,780
a perfectly valid way to suppress speech they don't like.

589
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:34,820
Both Addison Cain and her lawyer, Shania Watson, say as much in their DMCA complaints.

590
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,900
And neither Addison nor her lawyer seem to care that it doesn't matter why you want the

591
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,740
infringing material taken down.

592
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:47,700
Copyright exists to protect your share of the market, not to protect you from defamation

593
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,420
or things that might make you look bad.

594
00:37:50,420 --> 00:38:00,020
Hey, Angelina, what the hell is taking so long with this edit?

595
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:04,940
Yeah, uh, sorry, sorry, um, I've just been so busy with my damn baby that it's just starting

596
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,020
to take over my brain.

597
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,420
It's like how you can't call your damn baby a damn baby unless you are, like, the most

598
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,900
wretched person in the world, and not like you're a mom who's constantly overloaded with

599
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,620
a toddler who's screaming for you nonstop, and the fact that you just want to call her

600
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:20,820
a damn baby to your friends over a glass of wine doesn't necessarily make you a bad

601
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,820
person.

602
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,820
Ah, you're always going on about your damn baby.

603
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:29,820
Yeah, yeah, of course, I won't say anything else about the damn baby, DAMN BABY!

604
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,820
Ugh, damn baby.

605
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,780
Well, of course this wasn't the end of it.

606
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:39,180
EFF did decide to take me on, so they sent a letter to Tomi Watson explaining why all

607
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:44,900
of the stuff in her letter was wrong, and, um, I don't know, I kind of genuinely did

608
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:51,380
think that would be the end of it, like I didn't think, uh, I didn't think they'd respond.

609
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,380
But they did.

610
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:58,500
Um, so yeah, let's, uh, let's see what they said.

611
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:03,900
As your organization, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, EFF, is a close partner with the

612
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:09,500
Organization for Transformative Works, OTW, and was clearly working with Lindsay Ellis

613
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:16,180
on the video, the EFF is aware that for over two years, my client, Addison Cain, Ms. Cain,

614
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:20,780
has been involved in two lawsuits in which the plaintiff, Quill Inc. Books Ltd., was

615
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,740
supported by the OTW.

616
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:34,300
OT... the people who own AO3, the fanfiction website?

617
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:38,260
Regardless of what really happened during the two lawsuits, it is clear that you and

618
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:43,460
your clients were intent on spreading false allegations and outright lies about my clients

619
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:48,900
and the litigation in the monetized video, which the EFF received a portion of the proceeds

620
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,900
to help produce.

621
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:54,940
Ms. Ellis could have easily condensed use of Ms. Cain's book into a few paragraphs for

622
00:39:54,940 --> 00:40:00,420
illustration instead of reading from the book for over two minutes.

623
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:04,340
How... how long do you think it takes to read a few paragraphs?

624
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,340
Like...

625
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:11,180
Zoe Ellis and her attorneys utilized numerous methods to obtain their objective to spear

626
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:16,820
Ms. Cain's name, but one common denominator has been their utilization of the OTW, of

627
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,820
which the EFF is a close partner.

628
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:23,820
It is our opinion that defamation exists, and because the EFF worked in collusion with

629
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:29,120
Lindsay Ellis to create the monetized video, the EFF is also culpable for the copyright

630
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,100
infringement and the defamation.

631
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:35,780
Lindsay Ellis goes on to further claim the EFF is the leading non-profit defending digital

632
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,780
privacy.

633
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:42,380
However, the relationship between the EFF and the OTW in this instance makes that statement

634
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,060
shaky at best.

635
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:48,620
The OTW previously partnered with Zoe Ellis and her agents, who went to great lengths

636
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:53,860
to expose my client's real name, home address, and photos of her child in relation to her

637
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:58,780
real name and home address, which is the opposite of digital privacy.

638
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:04,260
The tie between OTW and the EFF, and the history of abuse my client has faced the last

639
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:10,220
two years, makes the use of Lindsay Ellis, a YouTube-slash-Patreon personality with public

640
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:16,340
sway, suspicious in the least, particularly when you assisted in the creation of a monetized

641
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:21,940
video where both the EFF and Lindsay Ellis could profit off copyright infringement and

642
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,940
defamation.

643
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:28,740
As you are clearly aware, the fair use doctrine is highly subjective, and we find your analysis

644
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:33,340
of Ms. Ellis' use of Ms. Kane's book erroneous and incomplete.

645
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:39,940
As your client is unaware of legal procedure, she must also not understand that simply because

646
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:45,140
a motion-slash-complaint was filed in court does not mean the statement is true.

647
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:50,020
However, there is no excuse for your lack of due diligence on this topic.

648
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:55,340
Ms. Ellis clearly creates her videos and publishes them on YouTube and Patreon for profit, and

649
00:41:55,340 --> 00:42:00,780
the EFF profited as well in this case, a factor that strongly cuts against your fair

650
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,100
use argument.

651
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:06,820
As a direct result of the video, see Exhibit 1 showing evidence of a Twitter user who states

652
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,660
that he gave a one-star review to my client's book.

653
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:14,460
God damn it, you fucking asshole.

654
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:20,380
Despite my client's current public silence regarding Lindsay Ellis, her ongoing accusations,

655
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:26,420
the defaming video, and verbal attacks of her child, your client has gone to great lengths

656
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:30,900
to continue to spread baseless accusations and misinformation.

657
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:36,660
Regardless of this failure, it is clear that the EFF, through Lindsay Ellis, is now attempting

658
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:42,780
to drag the battle's corpses over the finish line by making a defamatory video and misleading

659
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:49,140
the public about your agenda, using a legally ignorant layman to do your dirty work in exchange

660
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,820
for donations.

661
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:55,900
We request a public apology from both the EFF and Lindsay Ellis for knowingly spreading

662
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,420
false information for profit.

663
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:03,820
And finally, we request that Lindsay Ellis and the EFF donate all proceeds made from

664
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:10,820
the defaming video to the anti-bully charity, KindCampaign.com.

665
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:20,500
It's the champagne of beers.

666
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:24,420
Oh my god, I can't believe I even need to say this.

667
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:32,460
Neither EFF nor OTW had anything to do with the production of that video.

668
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,900
No collusion.

669
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:38,700
To date, I have not made a donation to EFF, especially since the damn video is demonetized.

670
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:43,660
I only chose EFF because they were a non-profit that was irrelevant to the topics of the court

671
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,660
case.

672
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:49,900
But Jesus Christ, the moon logic of bringing the OTW into this, like, I don't even have

673
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,340
an AO3 account.

674
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:55,060
I have no contact or affiliation with OTW.

675
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:59,420
I did reach out to them about this video and they left me on read.

676
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:05,260
The only connection I have with OTW is I wrote one article for them earlier this year when

677
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:10,540
my book came out that nobody read and I lost a Hugo to them last year.

678
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:13,980
For best related work.

679
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:16,100
You guys deserve to win the Hugo, it's fine.

680
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:22,540
But the moon logic of even connecting OTW to this case is that Ellis' lawyers hired

681
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:29,740
Christina Busey as their expert witness on the topic of fanfiction and she happens to

682
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:36,980
be on the board of OTW.

683
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:42,700
So this letter definitely does fall into a pattern with regard to people and lawyers,

684
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:47,700
which is, you know what, the actual client, they're just dupes.

685
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,340
They're ignorant laymen.

686
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:53,620
You know, we attack the lawyers who are the real masterminds.

687
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:59,380
In this case, the fact that the EFF has worked with OTW before on completely unrelated things

688
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:04,340
means that there is a fanfiction deep state keen on taking Addison Cain down.

689
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:08,580
Pepe Sylvia, Pepe Sylvia, I looked in the mail, well this whole box is Pepe Sylvia!

690
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:13,260
Well your claim that I am a legally ignorant layman kind of works against all that stuff

691
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:17,420
that you're so mad about because clearly I don't know what I'm talking about.

692
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:22,620
My opinions, as expressed in the video, were good faith interpretations of the facts that

693
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,900
I had as I understood them.

694
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:29,060
And I may not have a law degree, but I do have a little tool you may not have heard

695
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,060
of.

696
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,980
It's called Goomba.

697
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:37,900
And to claim defamation against a public figure like Addison Cain, you have to show actual

698
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:44,580
malice that you published with either knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for the truth,

699
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,940
which I did not.

700
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:50,940
But a lot of the stuff that Addison and her lawyer Taylee are so mad about, well, I got

701
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:55,620
my interpretation of it actually from lawyers, but not lawyers that I know.

702
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,020
It's from a podcast called All Lawyers Are Bad.

703
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:04,700
He serves a series of requests for admission, including a key one, which is admit that Cain

704
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:12,460
misrepresented her involvement with the filing of the DMCA takedown notices against Zoe Ellis.

705
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:15,980
And the response was, admit it.

706
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:22,420
Cain was willing to lie her ass off, but the lawyers representing her confronted with

707
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:28,620
this request to admit did not, and they admitted that in fact she lied, and that she had been

708
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:32,580
entirely involved in the DMCA's issued into Oklahoma.

709
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:36,060
Turn down for what?

710
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:39,700
And they read out loud about as much copyrighted material as I did.

711
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:45,500
It was necessary, and it will only be beneficial to you if, in your coming estrous cycle, you

712
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,060
should conceal it.

713
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:51,100
And they were also a lot harsher, going so far as to call Cain things like,

714
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,940
To the profiteering shitheads.

715
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:56,580
They also use her real name a lot, which I never did.

716
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:03,220
So I wonder, why did they never get a DMCA takedown notice or emails from her lawyer?

717
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,220
Tell me.

718
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:08,140
Because if she's attractive, I'm gonna do everything I can to try to make her case.

719
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:12,580
I have to say, she's, I'm not gonna, I'm just gonna come out, she's hot.

720
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:13,580
Uh-huh.

721
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,340
I guess that'll do it.

722
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,340
Maybe I should have called her hot.

723
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,300
Well then again, I don't think that would have saved me.

724
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:25,300
It does not escape my notice that every single person that Cain has allegedly targeted is

725
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,300
a woman.

726
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:30,540
Poetic, that the charity she wants me to donate to is anti-girl-on-girl bullying.

727
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:33,900
But wait, you say, maybe she didn't even know about this podcast.

728
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,980
Oh no, mon frere, she did.

729
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:41,220
And something that one of the guys in the podcast said inspired her to commission fan

730
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:45,340
art of herself, drinking the blood of her enemies.

731
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:54,260
Yeah, you know, I'm just having a normal one, sitting on my throne of bones, drinking

732
00:47:54,260 --> 00:48:02,060
the blood of my enemies.

733
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:05,020
Drinking the blood of her enemies, but she's the bullied one.

734
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,500
Hashtag stand up to bullying.

735
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:11,100
And then we get to this anti-bullying charity at the end, where it's like trying to gaslight

736
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:16,660
people into believing that they are the bullies, and that they are the ones with behavior that

737
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,900
needs to be atoned for.

738
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,340
I can't be a bully.

739
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:22,540
I simply am the person demanding that you be better.

740
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:25,420
All of those other people making accusations against me?

741
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,540
Well, they were not the bullied ones.

742
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,220
I was the bullied one.

743
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,700
They were the bullies.

744
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:34,500
Any action I took against them, I had to take it.

745
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:38,940
It's totally normal that there are so many of them and they all kinda have the same story.

746
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:44,860
And you ever notice how people who crow about victimhood the loudest tend to be bullies themselves?

747
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:50,260
Now that said, I did make a couple hundred dollars off of it before it got demonetized.

748
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:54,660
So as a gesture of good faith, I went ahead and donated the money that would have gone

749
00:48:54,660 --> 00:49:00,060
to EFF to the Kind campaign.

750
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,260
Are we square?

751
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,780
And I don't want this to be the Addison Cain drama channel.

752
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:08,140
I genuinely hope this is the last video I make on the subject.

753
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:10,700
By which I mean I hope we don't go to court.

754
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,340
That said, it is petty fandom bullshit, but it does real harm.

755
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:19,620
In the great Regina George tradition, this does have impact on people's lives.

756
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:23,500
Every single author that I talk to, except Courtney Milan, said that their careers have

757
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:30,860
been harmed by everything Addison Cain has done, from DMCA on to petty fandom bullshit.

758
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:36,220
Now that said, to reiterate myself, don't harass her, goddammit.

759
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:41,140
She blames me for every single one of you idiots that are shitty to her on social media.

760
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:47,100
I understand the energy needing to go somewhere, where a quarantine and public shaming is fun.

761
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:51,160
But if you really want to piss her off, instead of being an asshole on Twitter, support the

762
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,260
authors that she has targeted.

763
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:57,580
I was really glib about the whole erotica thing in the first video, and I kind of would

764
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,140
like to backtrack that.

765
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:03,300
Erotica is a real legit genre, and if you're into it, go check them out.

766
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,860
Most of it's ABO.

767
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,420
Not for me.

768
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,940
But it might be for you.

769
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:09,940
Awoooooo.

770
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,740
Outside of that, there is Courtney Milan.

771
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:16,940
She just had a book come out that features an Asian hero, and that's something you'd

772
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:22,940
never see in the US in a traditional romance publishing, so go check her out.

773
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:27,860
And when I said I'm gonna milk the shit out of this, what of course I meant was merchandise.

774
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,580
And no, I don't actually mean this shirt.

775
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,060
You can't buy this.

776
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:36,820
Elisa, the comment matriarch, has been crafty lately, so she made this for me and a few

777
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,740
friends as a joke.

778
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:41,780
But there is some stuff you can buy.

779
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:45,660
And our good friends at DFTBA were super down with it.

780
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:50,300
We of course were very inspired by Lindsay Ellis' A Menace, so came up with a Saul Bass

781
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,620
inspired embossed pen you can get.

782
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:56,260
I'd also love to thank Tammy Watson for coming up with this idea of the fan fiction

783
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,260
deep state.

784
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,740
Just loves it.

785
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:04,420
Not a direct reference per se, but we were definitely inspired by the myth of the Karen,

786
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:06,180
let's say.

787
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:09,420
And finally, my personal favorite, the With Prejudice hat.

788
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,340
Buy it for the lawyer in your life.

789
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,620
They don't need to know the context.

790
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:16,380
And if you do know the context, it's very funny.

791
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:21,420
So enjoy our dumb merch, and join the hashtag fan fiction deep state.

792
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,100
One last thing before we go.

793
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:29,060
Patreon is a membership service, and my patrons are charged not by the content unit, but by

794
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,060
the month.

795
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:33,580
So if someone wanted to get into the weeds of monetization, they should understand that

796
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:40,420
people who give money to my Patreon are effectively paying for membership to me, which includes

797
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:42,940
certain perks, i.e. name in credits.

798
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:48,380
They are not paying for the content itself, they are in effect paying membership dues.

799
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:54,060
And ain't no ads on this video, so it is going unmonetized.

800
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:58,580
And while we're here, I'd like to thank the fine folks at Patreon for supporting creators,

801
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:05,420
standing up for fair use, and for being all around a bunch of really solid menches.

802
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,220
Thanks for watching.

803
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:23,380
Which is the opposite of digital privacy.

804
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:24,380
Wow.
