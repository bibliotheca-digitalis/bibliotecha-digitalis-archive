0	18200	Long ago, in the faraway land of ancient Burbank, was a golden age of powerful animation and
18200	19200	extraordinary directors.
19200	26600	And the greatest and strongest of all these directors was the mighty Musker and Clements.
26600	31160	Our story actually begins with The Great Mouse Detective.
31160	32160	No, really.
32160	36520	Well, actually, no, you could easily say it begins before that, but for our purposes,
36520	39680	let's say it begins with The Great Mouse Detective.
39680	44400	This film had four credited directors, these two guys named John Musker and Ron Clements
44400	49280	among them, and The Great Mouse Detective did okay enough that Disney was willing to
49280	51760	give some of these directors bigger projects.
51760	55080	Jeffrey Katzenberg was in charge of Disney Animation at the time, and he wanted to bring
55080	58120	Disney Animation Studios back to its former glory.
58120	63480	So, in a pitch meeting in 1985, Ron Clements pitched two projects of note, an adaptation
63480	67520	of Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid, and what was effectively Treasure
67520	70920	Island in Space.
70920	75320	And Jeffrey Katzenberg was like, hmm, that sounds kind of stupid.
75320	77040	Maybe keep workshopping that.
77040	79640	But that mermaid thing seems legit, let's do that.
79640	81120	And Clements was like, okay.
81120	85000	And so, with his former Great Mouse Detective co-director, John Musker, they go off and
85000	86200	make The Little Mermaid.
86200	90600	The Little Mermaid ended up doing gangbusters for the studio and ushering a new era of animation.
90600	94080	So they come back to Katzenberg like, hey, so about that Treasure Island in spit, and
94080	97320	Katzenberg is like, hey, actually, one of our former animators has been working on this
97320	100640	intricate and deeply artistic Arabian Nights type thing for like a decade, so let's rip
100640	102800	that off and release him before he can even finish his.
102800	104000	And so they're like, okay.
104000	105880	And then Musker and Clements go make Aladdin.
105880	107840	And Aladdin makes even more money for the studio.
107840	111880	And suddenly Disney's back on track, in no small part thanks to these two guys.
111880	115600	So now with two big hits under their belt, Musker and Clements go back to Katzenberg like,
115600	119160	hey, look how successful we are, can we please make Treasure Planet now?
119160	123320	And Katzenberg is like, I don't know, that still sounds pretty stupid, but I tell you
123320	127440	what, you make me one more movie that does impossibly well at the box office, something
127440	131400	that has every commercially viable element imaginable, thereby rendering it impossible
131400	137120	to fail, and lets you make your project that you actually care about.
137120	140900	And lo, so that these guys could finally make their beloved Treasure Planet, they first
140900	145640	had to create the most commercially viable thing you can imagine, aggressively tailored
145640	150320	to appeal to as wide a demographic as possible, referencing as many popular 90s things as
150320	155480	would fit in its 89 minute runtime, and combining such dissonant tones and styles that audiences
155480	163480	across the land would...eh, it was okay, I guess.
163480	171520	This movie is not a disaster, there's a lot about it that I like, both its villain
171520	176760	and its art design rank among my favorites in all of Disneydom, but the film didn't
176760	183120	do well upon release, and Disney then basically swept it under the rug.
183120	189320	And years have passed since 1997, empires have risen and fallen, entire civilizations
189320	195480	swept off the map, all having never found the answer to that one burning question, why
195480	198880	did Disney's Hercules underperform?
198880	218080	I mean, I know, it is one of the most important issues of our day, and no one is courageous
218080	226160	enough to talk about it, except me, and obviously, there's a lot to talk about.
226160	227880	Look at how long this video is.
227880	234040	Cause it's not actively bad, there is a lot, in fact, that is great about this movie,
234040	238440	but why is it on the whole not as good as the sum of its parts?
238440	246880	I've spent the bitter part of two decades unraveling this mystery, someone's gotta
246880	252000	do it, apparently.
252000	256760	I count Hercules, as a whole, as generally the weakest of the 90s Disney movies, and
256760	261520	this was a decade with singing, dancing gargoyles rhyming Adonis with croissant-es.
261520	265360	Now when I say weak, I don't mean actively inept, see the Phantom of the Opera review
265360	269320	for that, and I don't mean being inaccurate to the source material either, if you, like
269320	273040	me, were an insufferable 12 year old at the time, most of your criticism probably boiled
273040	277520	down to it not being faithful to the mythology.
277520	282760	And just for clarity's sake, I'm calling him Hercules, not Heracles, so just get that
282760	285160	out of your system, comment, whatever, I don't care.
285160	289860	When I talk about parts versus whole, Hercules had elements that were really great, but when
289860	292320	put together, it just didn't really jive.
292360	296440	Pocahontas, I think, is the worst of the 90s Disney movies because it's more boring and
296440	304560	less good, but I'd call it also a stronger movie because the parts gel, the tone is consistent,
304560	306840	the stakes are high, and the motivations are clear.
306840	311880	Hunchback of Notre Dame has a similar, albeit flipped, tone problem as Hercules, but again,
311880	313360	has a much stronger whole.
313360	316960	I probably would have never even noticed the tone problem if I hadn't run across Hercules
316960	319400	the Animated Series when I was in college.
319400	322920	There are some definite duds of episodes in that, especially considering the budget
322920	328160	was basically $10 per episode once the movie underperformed, and some main characters that
328160	335600	are really fucking annoying, but I think the Animated Series embodies what the movie should
335600	340600	have been.
340600	344320	The Animated Series doesn't bother with those massive plot contrivances.
344320	347920	It completely ignores the really important plot point in the movie that Hades didn't
347920	351880	know Hercules was alive the whole time, which is good because that never made sense anyway.
351880	356840	What I think Hercules wanted to be was what The Emperor's New Groove actually succeeded
356840	360120	in doing, a comedic take on a mythologized history.
360120	367680	Sincere, sure, but ultimately a fun romp that never took itself too seriously.
367680	372800	What Hercules ended up being was EVERY FUCKING THING UNDER THE SUN.
372800	376960	Which I guess was kind of inevitable, given that you were instructed by corporate to make
376960	380840	it everything to everyone, and whether or not you get to make your passion project is
380840	383760	on the line.
383760	388040	Let's discuss.
388040	391400	This movie is a comedy, arguably more than any other Disney movie that came out that
391400	392400	decade.
392400	393400	Two words.
393400	394400	I.
394400	395400	Am.
395400	396400	Retired.
396400	397820	At least as far as the marketing goes.
397820	401320	That wouldn't be a problem or even noteworthy, except that this has some of the darkest stuff
401320	402320	in all of Disney-dom.
402320	411880	Yep, that woman just got crushed by a several ton stone column.
411880	414440	I'm going to use this one scene as an example.
414440	419340	So this entire climactic scene where Hercules goes and fights the Titans is dogged by this
419340	420340	tonal yo-yoing.
420340	422240	Megara gets squished.
422240	424440	Somehow she's still breathing.
424440	425440	Okay.
425440	430520	Hercules races off and all sense of Megara-related urgency is lost.
430520	435000	We revert right back to that comedic tone.
435000	441240	And it almost feels like the gods didn't really need Hercules.
441240	446000	They just needed, like, moral support or a cheerleader.
446000	447880	And this scene goes by so fast.
447880	451880	Zeus lobs a couple of lightning bolts, Hercules then sucks them into the tornado giant and
451880	457000	lobs them into the sky and the plot explodes.
457000	458000	And that's the end of that.
458000	461760	And they're laughing and giving high-fives and then Hades reminds them that Meg is dying.
461760	466320	Like Hercules had completely forgotten about that little detail.
466320	470040	And then less than 30 seconds after wacky nonsense, we're down here like...
470040	471040	No!
471040	479560	Yeah, this movie's got a tone problem.
479560	487000	It's not as bad as Hunchback, though.
488000	492520	And since you people love that nitpicky plot hole crap, I'm gonna go ahead and get that
492520	494720	out of the way before we get into the deeper stuff.
494720	497240	I mean, who are we kidding?
497240	498240	I love it too.
498240	508120	So I feel like there is a difference between a plot hole and just a contrivance, but I
508120	510480	don't think it's necessarily like a black or white thing.
510480	513080	It's, you know, more of a gradient.
513080	517360	That said, Hades orders his minions to kill Hercules as a baby, and he doesn't find out
517360	524680	that they failed until 18 years later.
524680	526840	Hades apparently doesn't talk to any of the gods.
526840	528240	I mean, this kid's your nephew.
528240	532120	How did you miss that you failed to kill him for 18 years?
532120	536600	I mean, Zeus ordered all of the gods to go look for him.
536600	539320	You'd think he'd have at least, you know, sent a memo to the underworld.
539320	541360	Also, Hades, you seem like a smart guy.
541360	548920	You wouldn't want to, you know, check, make sure your bumbling minions got the job done?
548920	553320	I mean, it's not like they're related or anything.
553320	560320	The fates?
560320	561880	I thought you knew everything.
561880	570720	Hades, the villain, makes two bargains with Hercules, and keeps both of them.
571680	576360	Hercules, the hero, makes one bargain with Hades, and does not keep it.
576360	578840	You get her out, she goes.
578840	579840	You stay.
579840	580840	Our hero.
580840	586800	Anyway, that's not really a plot hole so much as a raging hypocrisy, but I guess that's
586800	589600	what you get when your villain is way more likable than your hero.
589600	593200	Actually, I'd love to see a version of this where Hercules keeps his end of the bargain,
593200	597600	and Meg goes, and he stays, and it turns into like Beauty and the Beast, and they kind of
597600	601720	hate each other at first, but then like Hades learned to change his ways, and it's just
601720	603280	a love story for the ages.
603280	606520	God damn, I would watch the shit out of that movie.
606520	610760	If you can prove yourself a true hero on Earth, your godhood will be restored.
610760	613120	I can't just make you a god.
613120	614840	Is that a hard and fast rule?
614840	616800	Any true hero attains godhood?
616800	621040	Or does it only apply to ex-gods who drank Hades' mortality juice?
621040	625240	Speaking of which, how do we get around Hercules' immortality?
625240	627520	I think you gotta turn the little sunspot...
627520	628520	Mortal.
628520	637440	Eh, Hades has this juice floating in a room devoted to the juice that robs gods of their
637440	638440	immortality.
638440	640640	He calls it his pink juice room.
640640	641640	Where did he get the juice?
641640	642640	Who knows?
642640	644760	Why does he only have one juice?
644760	646000	Who knows?
646000	648440	Why hasn't he used it on Zeus before this?
648440	650400	Eh, Hercules has a doggie tag.
650400	652800	Is that in case Zeus forgets his name?
652800	656560	The ticking clock of the planets aligning is arbitrary and lame and lazy.
656560	664240	In 18 years, precisely, the planets will align.
664240	666320	I mean, it's not like a plot hole, really.
666320	668480	It's just a weak-ass ticking clock.
668480	671720	Like on this day, the planets will make a doom tornado.
671720	675960	And you couldn't do your god lightning thing before that, but you can now because the doom
675960	678960	tornado got the water out of the way, I guess.
678960	681360	Then again, a lot of shit in Greek mythology is arbitrary.
682160	685440	See, she ate some pomegranate seeds.
685440	690480	So now that means she has to come stay with me for half the year every year.
690480	693200	That's according to the rules I just made up.
693200	697960	Zeus has no problem getting the Titans underground the first time, but now with an army of gods,
697960	699360	they are defeated almost immediately.
699360	702000	Yeah, maybe they just got lazy.
702000	705400	And possibly the biggest continuity error in any Disney movie.
705400	710280	So this movie has a lot of problems like that, and they are a lot more egregious than other
710280	715680	Disney movies, but unlike with Phantom Review, again, we already covered this sort of thing,
715680	718720	I'm not really going to talk about the filmmaking so much.
718720	725400	In this one, we're going to concentrate on structure, character, theme, and influence.
725400	729600	So let's start with influence.
729600	733480	In translating the story for a modern audience, Musker and Clements claimed that Hercules
733480	737800	appealed to them because it would allow them to do a superhero story while also commenting
737800	740600	on the world of celebrity athletes and endorsement deals.
740600	746200	Okay, here's the thing, I can see where you would get that ancient Greek hero equals
746200	751000	superhero plus sports star, but endorsement deals?
751000	756680	Put a pin in that, we're going to come back to that, pin that up on the wall.
756680	758840	Um, let's start with the hero thing.
758840	761440	I happen to be a hero.
761440	766240	The Greek idea of a hero, while bearing some similarities, is not the same as our modern
766240	767640	idea of a hero.
767640	771700	For the Greeks, heroes were in this context historical figures of cultural import who
771700	776320	either did exceptional things or had exceptional abilities, and were almost always descended
776320	778900	from Zeus, because Zeus got around.
778900	782600	But they were important figures, not necessarily nice ones.
782600	784680	And also, Greek heroes were deeply flawed.
784680	788200	And I don't mean flawed as in snapping a guy's neck to save the world and did I do
788200	789240	the right thing flawed.
789240	794320	I mean like flew into a murderous god-induced panic and murder your wife and children flawed.
794320	796640	Hercules did a lot of fucked up shit.
796640	800720	A Disney hero is about as far cry as one can get from the traditional Greek hero.
800720	803720	Greek heroes are always tragically flawed.
803720	807000	Every Disney protagonist in the 90s' tragic flaw was clumsiness.
807000	810360	He's too dangerous to be around normal people.
810360	812920	An entire canon of Bella Swans.
812920	817000	But let's say that, for the sake of argument, a hero is defined by our modern mythology
817000	818720	as a superhero.
818720	821880	In that case, a hero is defined by their selflessness.
821880	825440	By contrast, Greek heroes were more about quests for glory.
825440	828680	You know, Odysseus didn't go Odyssey-ing for the greater good.
828680	832880	They were more defined by their importance to the culture than by their inherent goodness.
832880	837960	And that way, they have more in common with, say, King Solomon of Israel than Superman.
837960	842780	A historical-slash-religious figure rather than some ideal of morality.
842780	847000	So the workaround here to make this work for our modern definition of a hero is that in
847000	852200	this version of Ancient Greece, being a hero is like a job one can aspire to.
852200	855220	He's just another chariot chaser.
855220	857060	You know, like professional athlete.
857060	860160	Which is an interesting idea, and I think works as a concept.
860160	863920	But they have a lot of wiggle room in terms of story because most people, while familiar
863920	868180	with the strongman Hercules archetype, aren't familiar with any of his stories.
868180	873540	So the checklist for what people would have associated the word Hercules with in 1997,
873540	879660	besides Kevin Sorbo, would have been A. Greek, B. Strong.
879660	880660	And that's about it.
880660	882660	Oh, he's a little Hercules.
882660	883660	Show me muscle again.
883660	884660	Oh, Hercules!
884660	885660	Hercules!
885660	886660	Hercules!
886660	890460	Like, sure, nerds knew about the Twelve Leapers of Hercules and that Hades wasn't the bad
890460	894460	guy, but if you're a normie back in 1995, the most obscure thing you probably knew about
894460	896660	Hercules is that Arnold Schwarzenegger played him once.
896660	899060	That is not Hercules.
899060	906500	Some have stated, I have stated, that this movie borrows almost nothing from the mythology
906500	909980	in terms of its story, and that's not entirely fair.
909980	912580	In Hercules, the main threats come from the Titans.
912580	914780	Olympus would be that way.
914780	920580	At the beginning, it references the big battle, which is called the Titanomachy.
920580	921580	Titanomachy?
921580	922580	Titanomachy?
922580	923580	Okay.
923580	930620	Anyway, mythologically, Hercules had nothing to do with that, and the Titans never got
930620	931620	out.
931620	935380	But there was a less well-known myth known as the Gigantomachy, where the gods of Olympus
935380	938000	fought a bunch of giants rather than titans.
938000	940960	There was a prophecy in this that had it that the giants would only be defeated if
940960	944440	a mortal was to help the gods, and Hercules did help out with that one.
944440	948680	So in this movie, they basically combine the Gigantomachy and the Titanomachy, and that's
948680	949680	fine.
949680	952440	So the Titans in Hercules are basically a mush of everything.
952440	955240	Giants, Titans, the Cyclops.
955240	958000	And the Twelve Leapers of Hercules are there, sort of.
958000	960720	They're just referenced visually during a montage.
960720	962040	And then again here.
962040	964080	So these guys clearly did their homework.
964080	969320	There is much more here rooted in Greek mythology than people give it credit for.
969320	977480	That said, the bulk of the story's influence is not from that.
977480	982680	The two main influences in Disney's Hercules are Superman and Rocky.
982680	987180	Rocky is a ragtag underdog story about a poor but plucky boxer who gets his chance when
987180	991080	the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed, decides to have a fight against a nobody
991080	993160	in order to stage a high-profile easy win.
993240	996960	But Rocky trains really hard, and to everyone's shock, manages the whole 15 rounds against
996960	998600	Creed, who only barely wins.
998600	1004120	But really, Rocky wins because love.
1004120	1008520	And Superman is a Christ allegory about an alien man who comes to Earth already gifted
1008520	1013120	with superhuman strength, powers, and compassion, and who is instructed by his alien ghost dad
1013120	1015240	to go set a good example for the human.
1015520	1024920	This reason above all, their capacity for good, I have sent them you, my only son.
1024920	1029720	Hercules has to train, like Rocky, despite having been divinely given his gifts, like
1029720	1030720	Superman.
1030720	1034480	This is written off in the movie as he's clumsy, so he doesn't really need to learn
1034480	1039320	how to do the thing, but rather how to control the thing that he's already been given.
1039320	1043120	So rather than letting the movie be its own new thing that isn't overly derivative,
1043120	1045520	All I want to do is go the distance.
1045520	1047080	I can go the distance.
1047080	1048080	Go the distance.
1048080	1049160	Go the distance.
1049160	1052560	the core of the film is trying to mush Rocky and Superman.
1052560	1057440	It's not wrong, but it's not only a stretch in terms of things to try to combine, it's
1057440	1059520	also just way too derivative.
1059520	1063000	Because inspiration is one thing, but this movie goes way out of its way to let you know
1063000	1066920	just how much it's lifting from other movies that, in the back of your mind, you're always
1066920	1070660	reminded in this subconscious way how not only is this movie not letting itself be its
1070660	1074020	own movie, but of these other, better movies it's lifting from.
1074020	1077020	Like, maybe you don't hate Kid Rock's All Summer Long,
1077020	1081020	Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long.
1081020	1085460	but it's always going to be this weird mush of Sweet Home Alabama and Werewolves of London,
1085460	1087540	which given a second's thought is like, what?
1091540	1095740	Sports movies typically end with a big match at the end, and superhero movies tend to have
1095740	1099740	the hero's motivation derived from some sense of duty to serve and protect the masses.
1099820	1103740	With great power comes great responsibility.
1103740	1108660	As a sports movie, there is no big match Hercules is training for, and as a superhero movie,
1108660	1111020	the hero part is just a means to an end.
1111020	1114820	You'll get your chance, you just need some kind of catastrophe.
1114820	1118300	Meg at one point even calls Hercules out on how he doesn't really care about the people
1118300	1120300	he portends to want to save.
1120300	1121300	Kids?
1121300	1122300	Trapped?
1122300	1123300	Phil!
1123300	1124300	This is great!
1124300	1125800	You're really choked up about this, aren't you?
1125860	1130280	The movie kind of has a mean, dismissive attitude towards the populace at large.
1130280	1131280	They are either catty,
1131280	1132280	Yeah?
1132280	1134040	And who are you?
1134040	1135040	or judgmental,
1135040	1138360	Have you ever reversed a natural disaster?
1138360	1140280	or mindlessly sycophantic.
1140280	1142080	They are just a means to an end.
1142080	1146600	Rocky's story and Superman's story are non-complementary, so by combining them you
1146600	1150280	have a Rocky movie where Rocky doesn't know what he's training for, and a Superman movie
1150280	1154040	where Superman feels no sense of duty to the people and is only a hero to them because
1154040	1156920	he's told that doing so will get him what he wants.
1156920	1161400	So do you remember how we put a pin in the filmmakers wanting to comment on celebrity
1161400	1162400	endorsement?
1162400	1165240	Well, okay, we're back to that part now.
1165240	1170400	When you're watching a movie, any movie, basically everything you see on the screen
1170400	1172520	will contain some form of shorthand.
1172520	1176560	For instance, here is Hercules getting down on his knees and praying to Zeus.
1176560	1177560	Almighty Zeus?
1177560	1182480	Now, a good boy in ancient Greece probably would have, you know, brought a goat and slaughtered
1182480	1187760	it on that altar, you know, rather than getting down on his knees and praying like a Christian.
1187760	1189200	Do things the proper way.
1189200	1193120	The audience associates getting on their knees with piety, therefore this is shorthand.
1193120	1196600	And this has nothing to do with historical accuracy and everything to do with using shorthand
1196600	1200560	to get information to the audience using cultural knowledge the audience is presumably familiar
1200560	1201560	with.
1201560	1204960	Pop culture references became an increasingly popular form of shorthand in animation ever
1204960	1209360	since Aladdin, and this movie has a lot of that.
1209360	1217480	The audience is familiar with these things, and without the lines being drawn explicitly,
1217480	1221520	our mid-90s audience is still able to draw the lines between Hercules and celebrity athletes
1221520	1225240	being wealthy and endorsing products.
1225240	1234920	Hercules isn't just Rocky and Superman, he's also Michael Jordan, from pain-wearing
1234920	1246120	Air Herx to panic-consuming-then-not-McDonalds that Hercules has been celebrity-endorsing.
1246120	1249840	How does this tie into the film thematically?
1249840	1253760	After he trains with Phil, Hercules goes to Thebes, which is a thinly-veiled version of
1253760	1258960	New York that was already dated in 1997.
1258960	1261720	This is the big city in which Hercules goes to make it.
1261720	1265800	Then Hades stages a battle with the intent of killing Hercules, but inadvertently makes
1265800	1267840	him an overnight sensation.
1267840	1272320	After that, we get a montage with all of these references to sports stardom—signing autographs,
1272320	1278220	fans wearing his jersey, appearance fees, royalties, action figures, sweatshops making
1278220	1289000	your product, endorsing fast foods, Air Jordans, our Herc had cash to burn, yeah, money, whoo!
1289720	1293680	Hercules doesn't set out like, I'm going to go be a hero and that will net me fame
1293680	1295360	and fortune, yay.
1295360	1299660	Fame and fortune just kind of happened to him incidentally, so there was never a point
1299660	1303680	where he sought out wealth and fortune and then learned the error of his ways.
1303680	1308160	He never tries to win Meg over with his fame and fortune, it's just kind of there.
1308160	1312800	And this would have worked if Hercules had a more arrogant starting point, or maybe had
1312800	1324960	equated fame and fortune with personal worth, like Aladdin did, and Spider-Man did.
1324960	1327800	This points to why Kuzco is a much more compelling character.
1327800	1332040	He was genuinely flawed and arrogant, and eventually he learned the error of his ways.
1332040	1336040	I'm not saying Hercules needed to be like Kuzco, but for wealth and fame to be framed
1336040	1341080	as not the point of being a true hero, he kind of needed to want it.
1341080	1346440	But he never cared about any of that, this isn't a character flaw.
1346440	1350040	It doesn't corrupt him at all, it doesn't make him egotistical or make him lose sight
1350040	1351600	of what it means to be a hero.
1351600	1355120	In the end, the references end up kind of being hollow.
1355120	1359560	It's less a comment on celebrity athlete endorsement culture, or homage to Rocky, than
1359560	1363160	it's just trying to remind the audience something they're already familiar with without
1363160	1369360	actually exploring it.
1369600	1372720	Chosen One narratives are easy to write, because then you don't need to come up with a good
1372720	1375940	and compelling reason for why our hero is the center of the conflict.
1375940	1378800	But they're hard to make interesting, because there's no good and compelling reason for
1378800	1381140	why our hero is the center of the conflict.
1381140	1384560	And you notice that most popular heroes' journey stories don't involve a prophecy
1384560	1388560	proclaiming them to be the Chosen One.
1388560	1394140	Frodo wasn't prophesied, Katniss wasn't prophesied, Luke Skywalker wasn't prophesied,
1394140	1398480	they were all ordinary people thrust into extraordinary circumstances by chance or plot
1398480	1400800	stuff or them wanting to do a thing.
1400800	1405560	The only real Chosen One character in the Star Wars universe is Anakin, and we all remember
1405560	1408520	how that turned out.
1408520	1412160	Even Harry Potter ends up being more of a send-up of Chosen One narratives than a Chosen
1412160	1418360	One narrative played straight.
1418360	1422000	His Chosen One-ness comes into play more in how people treat him than as it pertains to
1422000	1425680	the actual plot, and most of the conflicts of the individual stories have more to do
1425680	1429560	with the periphery of the universe as a whole, rather than the fact that Harry is the only
1429560	1431400	person who can save the world.
1431400	1434200	Which ultimately turns out not to be true, by the by.
1434200	1440800	The Chosen One narrative was even more pointedly dissected in The Lego Movie, and the whole
1440800	1444200	point of that ends up being that there is no Chosen One.
1444200	1448000	Think Chosen One narratives work better in TV shows than in movies?
1448000	1451680	Contrast this with something like Buffy, who was one in a long line of Chosen Ones and
1451680	1452920	could die at any moment.
1453200	1456680	Avatar The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra take a similar approach to their Chosen
1456680	1457680	Ones.
1457680	1460440	Their stories are about the day-to-day dealing with it.
1460440	1463440	Disney movies mostly stayed away from Chosen One prophecies.
1463440	1469600	The closest we get is probably Aladdin.
1469600	1473640	Aladdin's Chosen One-ness is what gets him into the cave to get the lamp, but this aspect
1473640	1477520	is completely done and over with by the end of Act 1 of the film, and the rest of the
1477520	1479780	film's conflict has nothing to do with it.
1479780	1483180	The momentum of the film is fully propelled by character motivation, and is rooted in
1483180	1484180	actual stakes.
1484180	1491980	Simba's arc has an element of destiny to it, but this has more to do with duty than
1491980	1492980	prophecy.
1492980	1496980	In Hercules, the only reason Hades has it in for Hercules is because the fates told
1496980	1498380	him to.
1498380	1499380	Because prophecy.
1499380	1503160	And by the end of the film, they have built up to no enmity, because they don't really
1503160	1508660	know each other, and they have no reason to be at odds with each other besides prophecy.
1508660	1512780	And again, contrast this with the TV show, where they do know each other, and do develop
1512780	1513780	a dynamic.
1513780	1516780	Hey, if I could only turn one person to stone, I'm glad it was Jercules.
1516780	1517780	I hate that kid.
1517780	1522100	The only thing that makes Hercules special, the only reason Hades pays any attention to
1522100	1525940	him at all, is a prophecy that Hercules has no idea about.
1525940	1531740	Nearly every iota of plot momentum is manufactured by contrivances outside of Hercules' control.
1531740	1536260	So the result is a story that is not being pushed by actions or character development,
1536260	1542500	but is instead being pulled by its nose by the plot contrivance of destiny.
1542500	1549580	So if you want to learn about screenwriting and screenplay structure, Disney's Hercules
1549580	1554700	is the perfect vehicle for baby's first three act structure, because it is so carefully
1554700	1556540	and clearly delineated.
1556540	1560620	And if you're wondering why I'm taking the time to go through this, it's because I'm
1560620	1561620	trying to save you.
1561620	1563540	I'm trying to save you from the student loans.
1563540	1564740	Don't go to film school.
1564740	1565740	Watch internet videos.
1566220	1569380	Hercules has a very simple, very traditional three act structure.
1569380	1572980	So we can use this as an opportunity to examine story structure as it pertains to Hollywood
1572980	1573980	movies.
1573980	1574980	Backstory.
1574980	1579060	We learn who Hercules is and how the universe works.
1579060	1580060	Excuse me?
1580060	1584140	Should Hercules fight, you will fail.
1584140	1585140	Inciting incident.
1585140	1588540	Hades hears the prophecy that Hercules will defeat him.
1588540	1591100	This leads Hades to turning Hercules into a mortal.
1591100	1592100	This is it.
1592100	1593100	Don't you see?
1593100	1595100	Maybe they have the answers.
1595460	1596460	Point of attack.
1596460	1597980	Hercules finds out that he's adopted.
1597980	1603460	Now, some people say that point of attack and inciting incident are the same thing.
1603460	1605020	And these people are wrong.
1605020	1607420	The inciting incident sets the plot in motion.
1607420	1611020	The point of attack is the moment the central conflict and character motivation appears
1611020	1613660	and the primary action of the story can get moving.
1613660	1614660	The central conflict.
1614660	1618580	I feel like, like I really don't belong here.
1618580	1620780	Hercules wants to find out where he belongs.
1620780	1622860	This culminates at the end of act one.
1622860	1625020	Hercules presents his central conflict to Zeus.
1625020	1626020	Zeus tells him how to fix it.
1626020	1630260	If you can prove yourself a true hero on earth, your godhood will be restored.
1630260	1633500	This is called a lock-in, also known as the end of act one.
1633500	1635900	Our hero has his quest and now he goes out to quest it.
1635900	1637620	I won't let you down, father.
1637620	1641420	Go be a true hero, Hercules, and that will solve your central conflict.
1641420	1644060	Act two is typically split into two segments.
1644060	1650620	In Hercules, these two segments are very clearly defined.
1650620	1654140	A first culmination occurs at the end of the first half of the second act.
1654260	1657220	In Hercules, it's where he proves himself by defeating Dehydra.
1657220	1660140	The midpoint is Hercules attaining fame and fortune.
1660140	1664740	Important to note also that the midpoint doesn't necessarily fall right in the middle of the
1664740	1665780	movie.
1665780	1669580	The Lion King has an unusually long first act and a really short second act, so its
1669580	1673820	midpoint, which is where he meets up with Nala, happens around 60% through the movie.
1673820	1679100	Gotta blaze, there's a whole cosmos up there waiting for me, with hey, my name on it.
1679100	1683080	The end of act two also generally sees the resolution of the main tension.
1683080	1689640	In this case, Hades releasing the Titans while building a new tension for act three.
1689640	1692840	The Titans now having been released, now we have to go defeat them.
1692840	1696920	This is called the main culmination and usually coincides with the hero being at his lowest
1696920	1697920	point.
1697920	1706920	Again, illustrated really, really clearly here.
1706920	1710000	Twist in the third act, Meg sacrifices herself for Hercules.
1710000	1711600	Hercules gets his strength back.
1711600	1715520	The twist in the third act is important because it shifts the focus of the final tension.
1715520	1719440	The main tension is no longer, will we defeat the Titans, which is part of what makes his
1719440	1723200	little cul-de-sac where he actually does go and wackily defeat the Titans all the more
1723200	1727280	problematic for the tone, by the by.
1727280	1728560	It's will Meg die.
1728560	1731280	The stakes are much higher.
1731280	1738760	Climax, Hercules sacrifices himself for Meg, becomes a true hero.
1738760	1748160	Now here's the thing, central conflict.
1748160	1752160	The central conflict in pretty much all of the 90s Disney movies was about self-identity
1752160	1753840	and finding oneself.
1753840	1757680	And Hercules is probably the most overt in that regard alongside Tarzan.
1757680	1759400	Both have the same central conflict.
1759400	1762600	I am an outsider and I want to find out where I belong.
1762600	1764080	And same resolution.
1764080	1765920	This sexy lady is where I belong.
1765920	1766920	Resolution.
1767160	1771120	You were willing to give your life to rescue this young woman.
1771120	1775600	So the resolution resolves the conflict between sports star equals self-serving and superhero
1775600	1780400	equals selfless, but it does not resolve Hercules' central conflict.
1780400	1785560	Which brings us to...
1785560	1789600	In screenplay terms, motivation is described as want versus need.
1789600	1794040	In a story, a character needs to grow or change or learn something for a satisfying character
1794040	1795040	arc.
1795040	1798120	Not all the time, but in Disney movies, yeah, all the time.
1798120	1801920	And generally, the want and the need are related but aren't necessarily the same thing.
1801920	1804520	The character is motivated by a want set up in the first act.
1804520	1807160	I want to be where the people are.
1807160	1812160	I want adventure in the great wide somewhere.
1812160	1819280	Just to live one day out there.
1819280	1822720	And their growth is detailed by meeting a need at the end of the third act.
1822720	1823720	Aladdin, want.
1823720	1824720	We'll be rich.
1824720	1825720	Live in a palace.
1825720	1826720	Need.
1826720	1830520	I gotta start pretending to be something I'm not.
1830520	1831520	Simba, want.
1831520	1832520	I guess you can change the past.
1832520	1833520	Need.
1833520	1834520	Yes, the past can't hurt.
1834520	1841560	But the way I see it, you can either run from it or learn from it.
1841560	1845160	So one fine day, Hercules finds out he's adopted and he goes to find out what's up.
1845160	1847240	Why do I feel so out of place, mom and dad?
1847240	1848240	Go find out.
1848240	1849240	Good.
1849240	1850240	Go.
1850240	1851240	Fine.
1851240	1852240	Good.
1852240	1853240	Perfectly good starting point.
1853760	1858120	And you need to learn to become a hero so you can be a god again.
1858120	1860720	And Hercules is like, okay, that makes perfect sense.
1860720	1862600	I'll go learn to be a true hero.
1862600	1863600	So Hercules' want.
1863600	1864600	To find where I belong.
1864600	1873400	And his need, which is being selfless is the mark of a true hero.
1873400	1876360	Well, one doesn't really build to the other.
1876360	1880360	This culminates when he sacrifices himself for Meg, which would indicate that he needed
1880360	1884800	to learn that being a hero is self-sacrificing, but that doesn't really have anything to
1884800	1889720	do with his main motivation, which is to find out where he belongs, or to resolve some character
1889720	1890720	flaw.
1890720	1893240	He was always kind of an innocent nice guy.
1893240	1899240	Not the most altruistic, but not exactly selfish either.
1899240	1903400	Hercules wants basically the same things as Aladdin, but he gets that halfway through
1903400	1904500	the movie.
1904500	1907820	He never has to accept himself to be respected by the masses.
1907820	1912540	So self-sacrifice is noble, sure, but it's not a culminating moment for his character
1912540	1918060	like it was for, say, Kuzco, who was selfish, or Aladdin, who was pretending to be something
1918060	1919060	he wasn't.
1919060	1924140	Basically, his want, a sense of belonging, and his need, being self-sacrificing, don't
1924140	1925940	really have anything to do with each other.
1925940	1929220	One does not resolve the other, which makes for a weak character arc.
1929220	1933340	And you could say, but Hades, but the Hades plot isn't relevant to Hercules' motivation
1933340	1937000	because at no point does Hercules even learn about the prophecy, and he doesn't even
1937000	1942000	meet Hades up until the end of the movie, which also makes this showdown kind of limp.
1942000	1943800	Let her go.
1943800	1947440	I've been waiting for this moment for ten minutes.
1947440	1948800	Look again at Aladdin.
1948800	1953920	The thing that he and Jafar are fighting over, namely the genie, is directly related to Aladdin's
1953920	1954920	character growth.
1954920	1957800	There is a point where Aladdin decides he won't let the genie go because the genie
1957800	1960280	helps him maintain his facade.
1960280	1962800	Without you, I'm just Aladdin.
1962800	1966000	But his character arc culminates with him letting the genie go.
1966000	1970080	And Aladdin's growth also relates to the antagonist, Jafar, because letting the genie
1970080	1972640	go is something Jafar would never do.
1972640	1976480	At its core, the problem with Hercules' motivation is that, unlike all of the other
1976480	1978840	Disney characters, it's not an internal motivation.
1978840	1983560	But if I don't become a true hero, I'll never be able to rejoin my father, Zeus.
1983560	1985980	He doesn't want to be a hero because he wants it.
1985980	1987880	He wants it because he was told to.
1987880	1992800	Some of the most memorable characters in the last twenty years, Walter White, Tony Soprano,
1992800	1995080	Cersei Lannister, Daniel Plainview,
1996720	2001440	these characters do some fucked up shit and are rarely if ever sympathetic, but the audience
2001440	2004280	engages with them highly because they are highly motivated.
2004280	2006240	You're goddamn right.
2006240	2009360	And you see this more on television because you have a lot more time to really explore
2009360	2011080	character depth and nuance.
2011080	2014360	And I use these characters as examples, not because they belong in Disney movies, but
2014360	2018600	to illustrate that it is more important for a character to be motivated than to be sympathetic
2018600	2019600	or relatable.
2019600	2022200	Hercules is certainly the latter, but not the former.
2022200	2025240	And even though on a personal level I really hate most movies that have some sort of
2025240	2028520	YOU LIED TO ME engineered conflict, let's ignore that.
2028520	2032360	Meg's character arc is much stronger than Hercules because her stakes are much higher,
2032360	2035080	her dilemma more intense, and her motivations clearer.
2035080	2038720	Even though history has taught her that she can't trust men or her own feelings, which
2038720	2041600	her bitchy gay boyfriend Hades details explicitly.
2041600	2042600	This one is different.
2042600	2044080	He's honest and he's sweet.
2044080	2045080	Please.
2045080	2046080	He would never do anything to hurt me.
2046080	2047080	He's a guy.
2047080	2048400	You deserve a better movie, Meg.
2048400	2051400	In fact, everyone in this movie deserves a better movie.
2051400	2052720	Meg deserves a better movie.
2052720	2054560	Hercules deserves a better movie.
2054560	2056360	Hades deserves a better movie.
2056360	2059080	Phil, actually no, not Phil, f**k Phil.
2059080	2061240	I'm real too.
2061240	2062560	Dang it!
2062560	2064920	When I say I'm fond of this movie, that is what I mean.
2064920	2071880	I'm fond of the characters, I'm fond of the style, I'm fond of the idea, of the tone,
2071880	2076960	you know, when it's being fun and actually enjoyable.
2076960	2082400	The bones of the thing I am not fond of, and that is one of the most important parts
2082400	2083400	of any movie.
2083400	2086680	To make it clear, I do not mean to say that there was nothing risky or new or innovative
2086680	2087680	in this movie.
2087680	2088680	Far from it.
2088680	2091880	It has the first Disney heroine who starts out in league with the bad guy, and who's
2091880	2096360	not only got a past with men, but she's gotta be pushing 30 given how world-weary she is.
2096360	2097800	Well, you know how men are.
2097800	2101440	They think no means yes and get lost means take me, I'm yours.
2101440	2104800	Don't worry, Shorty here can explain it to you later.
2104800	2106580	Like I said, f**k Phil.
2106580	2110180	The risk of going with a straight comedic villain is one of the best things in the movie,
2110180	2111860	despite the tonal problems.
2111860	2117580	This is also the first Disney movie since, uh, Fantasia, uh, yeah, to have named black
2117580	2118580	characters.
2118580	2119580	Yep, 1997.
2119580	2121820	That's how long it took.
2121820	2125820	This is one of the most stylized of the Disney canon, thanks in large part to the filmmakers
2125820	2128460	hiring Gerald Scarfe as the concept artist.
2128460	2131940	He was a New Yorker cartoonist, but at the time, he was most famous for doing the art
2131940	2133740	for Pink Floyd's The Wall.
2133740	2137100	And the style Scarfe came up with for the movie was pretty out there, but you can totally
2137100	2139420	see its influence in the finished product.
2139420	2141620	And here is the sad irony of Hercules.
2141620	2146260	Like Hercules learning to be a hero as a means to a different, unrelated end, Musker and
2146260	2150260	Clements made Hercules as a means to a different, unrelated project.
2150260	2153540	They had to do this thing in order to earn the thing they actually cared about.
2153540	2158460	Katzenberg left Disney in 1994 under not very friendly circumstances, but the studio made
2158460	2160540	good on Katzenberg's promise.
2160540	2162140	And Treasure Planet exists.
2162140	2166660	I found it pretty unmemorable, and to this day is the biggest flop Musker and Clements
2166660	2168100	were involved in.
2168100	2170460	And I take no schadenfreude in that.
2170460	2174940	Let me be clear, I actually really respect these guys and what they've done for animation,
2174940	2175940	but it didn't ruin them.
2175940	2176940	They're fine.
2176940	2177940	They're doing fine.
2177940	2182460	Everything good and memorable about Hercules stems from the filmmakers taking risk.
2182460	2184980	And that is the essence of really great films.
2184980	2189980	It is a combination of risk and of cliché, of new and of safe.
2189980	2195220	The art is in how you weave the two together.
2195220	2196220	So now that's it.
2196220	2198460	We can finally put it to rest.
2198460	2204180	The long-standing mystery of what exactly made Hercules kind of meh in the eyes of the
2204180	2206420	public and Disney.
2206420	2212060	And to those of you who look down on me and people like me who just tried for so long
2212060	2219340	to do this Hercules dissection thing, to you I say, there are dozens of us.
2219340	2221020	Dozens!
