00:00.000 --> 00:18.200
Long ago, in the faraway land of ancient Burbank, was a golden age of powerful animation and

00:18.200 --> 00:19.200
extraordinary directors.

00:19.200 --> 00:26.600
And the greatest and strongest of all these directors was the mighty Musker and Clements.

00:26.600 --> 00:31.160
Our story actually begins with The Great Mouse Detective.

00:31.160 --> 00:32.160
No, really.

00:32.160 --> 00:36.520
Well, actually, no, you could easily say it begins before that, but for our purposes,

00:36.520 --> 00:39.680
let's say it begins with The Great Mouse Detective.

00:39.680 --> 00:44.400
This film had four credited directors, these two guys named John Musker and Ron Clements

00:44.400 --> 00:49.280
among them, and The Great Mouse Detective did okay enough that Disney was willing to

00:49.280 --> 00:51.760
give some of these directors bigger projects.

00:51.760 --> 00:55.080
Jeffrey Katzenberg was in charge of Disney Animation at the time, and he wanted to bring

00:55.080 --> 00:58.120
Disney Animation Studios back to its former glory.

00:58.120 --> 01:03.480
So, in a pitch meeting in 1985, Ron Clements pitched two projects of note, an adaptation

01:03.480 --> 01:07.520
of Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid, and what was effectively Treasure

01:07.520 --> 01:10.920
Island in Space.

01:10.920 --> 01:15.320
And Jeffrey Katzenberg was like, hmm, that sounds kind of stupid.

01:15.320 --> 01:17.040
Maybe keep workshopping that.

01:17.040 --> 01:19.640
But that mermaid thing seems legit, let's do that.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.120
And Clements was like, okay.

01:21.120 --> 01:25.000
And so, with his former Great Mouse Detective co-director, John Musker, they go off and

01:25.000 --> 01:26.200
make The Little Mermaid.

01:26.200 --> 01:30.600
The Little Mermaid ended up doing gangbusters for the studio and ushering a new era of animation.

01:30.600 --> 01:34.080
So they come back to Katzenberg like, hey, so about that Treasure Island in spit, and

01:34.080 --> 01:37.320
Katzenberg is like, hey, actually, one of our former animators has been working on this

01:37.320 --> 01:40.640
intricate and deeply artistic Arabian Nights type thing for like a decade, so let's rip

01:40.640 --> 01:42.800
that off and release him before he can even finish his.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.000
And so they're like, okay.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.880
And then Musker and Clements go make Aladdin.

01:45.880 --> 01:47.840
And Aladdin makes even more money for the studio.

01:47.840 --> 01:51.880
And suddenly Disney's back on track, in no small part thanks to these two guys.

01:51.880 --> 01:55.600
So now with two big hits under their belt, Musker and Clements go back to Katzenberg like,

01:55.600 --> 01:59.160
hey, look how successful we are, can we please make Treasure Planet now?

01:59.160 --> 02:03.320
And Katzenberg is like, I don't know, that still sounds pretty stupid, but I tell you

02:03.320 --> 02:07.440
what, you make me one more movie that does impossibly well at the box office, something

02:07.440 --> 02:11.400
that has every commercially viable element imaginable, thereby rendering it impossible

02:11.400 --> 02:17.120
to fail, and lets you make your project that you actually care about.

02:17.120 --> 02:20.900
And lo, so that these guys could finally make their beloved Treasure Planet, they first

02:20.900 --> 02:25.640
had to create the most commercially viable thing you can imagine, aggressively tailored

02:25.640 --> 02:30.320
to appeal to as wide a demographic as possible, referencing as many popular 90s things as

02:30.320 --> 02:35.480
would fit in its 89 minute runtime, and combining such dissonant tones and styles that audiences

02:35.480 --> 02:43.480
across the land would...eh, it was okay, I guess.

02:43.480 --> 02:51.520
This movie is not a disaster, there's a lot about it that I like, both its villain

02:51.520 --> 02:56.760
and its art design rank among my favorites in all of Disneydom, but the film didn't

02:56.760 --> 03:03.120
do well upon release, and Disney then basically swept it under the rug.

03:03.120 --> 03:09.320
And years have passed since 1997, empires have risen and fallen, entire civilizations

03:09.320 --> 03:15.480
swept off the map, all having never found the answer to that one burning question, why

03:15.480 --> 03:18.880
did Disney's Hercules underperform?

03:18.880 --> 03:38.080
I mean, I know, it is one of the most important issues of our day, and no one is courageous

03:38.080 --> 03:46.160
enough to talk about it, except me, and obviously, there's a lot to talk about.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.880
Look at how long this video is.

03:47.880 --> 03:54.040
Cause it's not actively bad, there is a lot, in fact, that is great about this movie,

03:54.040 --> 03:58.440
but why is it on the whole not as good as the sum of its parts?

03:58.440 --> 04:06.880
I've spent the bitter part of two decades unraveling this mystery, someone's gotta

04:06.880 --> 04:12.000
do it, apparently.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.760
I count Hercules, as a whole, as generally the weakest of the 90s Disney movies, and

04:16.760 --> 04:21.520
this was a decade with singing, dancing gargoyles rhyming Adonis with croissant-es.

04:21.520 --> 04:25.360
Now when I say weak, I don't mean actively inept, see the Phantom of the Opera review

04:25.360 --> 04:29.320
for that, and I don't mean being inaccurate to the source material either, if you, like

04:29.320 --> 04:33.040
me, were an insufferable 12 year old at the time, most of your criticism probably boiled

04:33.040 --> 04:37.520
down to it not being faithful to the mythology.

04:37.520 --> 04:42.760
And just for clarity's sake, I'm calling him Hercules, not Heracles, so just get that

04:42.760 --> 04:45.160
out of your system, comment, whatever, I don't care.

04:45.160 --> 04:49.860
When I talk about parts versus whole, Hercules had elements that were really great, but when

04:49.860 --> 04:52.320
put together, it just didn't really jive.

04:52.360 --> 04:56.440
Pocahontas, I think, is the worst of the 90s Disney movies because it's more boring and

04:56.440 --> 05:04.560
less good, but I'd call it also a stronger movie because the parts gel, the tone is consistent,

05:04.560 --> 05:06.840
the stakes are high, and the motivations are clear.

05:06.840 --> 05:11.880
Hunchback of Notre Dame has a similar, albeit flipped, tone problem as Hercules, but again,

05:11.880 --> 05:13.360
has a much stronger whole.

05:13.360 --> 05:16.960
I probably would have never even noticed the tone problem if I hadn't run across Hercules

05:16.960 --> 05:19.400
the Animated Series when I was in college.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.920
There are some definite duds of episodes in that, especially considering the budget

05:22.920 --> 05:28.160
was basically $10 per episode once the movie underperformed, and some main characters that

05:28.160 --> 05:35.600
are really fucking annoying, but I think the Animated Series embodies what the movie should

05:35.600 --> 05:40.600
have been.

05:40.600 --> 05:44.320
The Animated Series doesn't bother with those massive plot contrivances.

05:44.320 --> 05:47.920
It completely ignores the really important plot point in the movie that Hades didn't

05:47.920 --> 05:51.880
know Hercules was alive the whole time, which is good because that never made sense anyway.

05:51.880 --> 05:56.840
What I think Hercules wanted to be was what The Emperor's New Groove actually succeeded

05:56.840 --> 06:00.120
in doing, a comedic take on a mythologized history.

06:00.120 --> 06:07.680
Sincere, sure, but ultimately a fun romp that never took itself too seriously.

06:07.680 --> 06:12.800
What Hercules ended up being was EVERY FUCKING THING UNDER THE SUN.

06:12.800 --> 06:16.960
Which I guess was kind of inevitable, given that you were instructed by corporate to make

06:16.960 --> 06:20.840
it everything to everyone, and whether or not you get to make your passion project is

06:20.840 --> 06:23.760
on the line.

06:23.760 --> 06:28.040
Let's discuss.

06:28.040 --> 06:31.400
This movie is a comedy, arguably more than any other Disney movie that came out that

06:31.400 --> 06:32.400
decade.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.400
Two words.

06:33.400 --> 06:34.400
I.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.400
Am.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.400
Retired.

06:36.400 --> 06:37.820
At least as far as the marketing goes.

06:37.820 --> 06:41.320
That wouldn't be a problem or even noteworthy, except that this has some of the darkest stuff

06:41.320 --> 06:42.320
in all of Disney-dom.

06:42.320 --> 06:51.880
Yep, that woman just got crushed by a several ton stone column.

06:51.880 --> 06:54.440
I'm going to use this one scene as an example.

06:54.440 --> 06:59.340
So this entire climactic scene where Hercules goes and fights the Titans is dogged by this

06:59.340 --> 07:00.340
tonal yo-yoing.

07:00.340 --> 07:02.240
Megara gets squished.

07:02.240 --> 07:04.440
Somehow she's still breathing.

07:04.440 --> 07:05.440
Okay.

07:05.440 --> 07:10.520
Hercules races off and all sense of Megara-related urgency is lost.

07:10.520 --> 07:15.000
We revert right back to that comedic tone.

07:15.000 --> 07:21.240
And it almost feels like the gods didn't really need Hercules.

07:21.240 --> 07:26.000
They just needed, like, moral support or a cheerleader.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.880
And this scene goes by so fast.

07:27.880 --> 07:31.880
Zeus lobs a couple of lightning bolts, Hercules then sucks them into the tornado giant and

07:31.880 --> 07:37.000
lobs them into the sky and the plot explodes.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
And that's the end of that.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.760
And they're laughing and giving high-fives and then Hades reminds them that Meg is dying.

07:41.760 --> 07:46.320
Like Hercules had completely forgotten about that little detail.

07:46.320 --> 07:50.040
And then less than 30 seconds after wacky nonsense, we're down here like...

07:50.040 --> 07:51.040
No!

07:51.040 --> 07:59.560
Yeah, this movie's got a tone problem.

07:59.560 --> 08:07.000
It's not as bad as Hunchback, though.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.520
And since you people love that nitpicky plot hole crap, I'm gonna go ahead and get that

08:12.520 --> 08:14.720
out of the way before we get into the deeper stuff.

08:14.720 --> 08:17.240
I mean, who are we kidding?

08:17.240 --> 08:18.240
I love it too.

08:18.240 --> 08:28.120
So I feel like there is a difference between a plot hole and just a contrivance, but I

08:28.120 --> 08:30.480
don't think it's necessarily like a black or white thing.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.080
It's, you know, more of a gradient.

08:33.080 --> 08:37.360
That said, Hades orders his minions to kill Hercules as a baby, and he doesn't find out

08:37.360 --> 08:44.680
that they failed until 18 years later.

08:44.680 --> 08:46.840
Hades apparently doesn't talk to any of the gods.

08:46.840 --> 08:48.240
I mean, this kid's your nephew.

08:48.240 --> 08:52.120
How did you miss that you failed to kill him for 18 years?

08:52.120 --> 08:56.600
I mean, Zeus ordered all of the gods to go look for him.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.320
You'd think he'd have at least, you know, sent a memo to the underworld.

08:59.320 --> 09:01.360
Also, Hades, you seem like a smart guy.

09:01.360 --> 09:08.920
You wouldn't want to, you know, check, make sure your bumbling minions got the job done?

09:08.920 --> 09:13.320
I mean, it's not like they're related or anything.

09:13.320 --> 09:20.320
The fates?

09:20.320 --> 09:21.880
I thought you knew everything.

09:21.880 --> 09:30.720
Hades, the villain, makes two bargains with Hercules, and keeps both of them.

09:31.680 --> 09:36.360
Hercules, the hero, makes one bargain with Hades, and does not keep it.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.840
You get her out, she goes.

09:38.840 --> 09:39.840
You stay.

09:39.840 --> 09:40.840
Our hero.

09:40.840 --> 09:46.800
Anyway, that's not really a plot hole so much as a raging hypocrisy, but I guess that's

09:46.800 --> 09:49.600
what you get when your villain is way more likable than your hero.

09:49.600 --> 09:53.200
Actually, I'd love to see a version of this where Hercules keeps his end of the bargain,

09:53.200 --> 09:57.600
and Meg goes, and he stays, and it turns into like Beauty and the Beast, and they kind of

09:57.600 --> 10:01.720
hate each other at first, but then like Hades learned to change his ways, and it's just

10:01.720 --> 10:03.280
a love story for the ages.

10:03.280 --> 10:06.520
God damn, I would watch the shit out of that movie.

10:06.520 --> 10:10.760
If you can prove yourself a true hero on Earth, your godhood will be restored.

10:10.760 --> 10:13.120
I can't just make you a god.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.840
Is that a hard and fast rule?

10:14.840 --> 10:16.800
Any true hero attains godhood?

10:16.800 --> 10:21.040
Or does it only apply to ex-gods who drank Hades' mortality juice?

10:21.040 --> 10:25.240
Speaking of which, how do we get around Hercules' immortality?

10:25.240 --> 10:27.520
I think you gotta turn the little sunspot...

10:27.520 --> 10:28.520
Mortal.

10:28.520 --> 10:37.440
Eh, Hades has this juice floating in a room devoted to the juice that robs gods of their

10:37.440 --> 10:38.440
immortality.

10:38.440 --> 10:40.640
He calls it his pink juice room.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.640
Where did he get the juice?

10:41.640 --> 10:42.640
Who knows?

10:42.640 --> 10:44.760
Why does he only have one juice?

10:44.760 --> 10:46.000
Who knows?

10:46.000 --> 10:48.440
Why hasn't he used it on Zeus before this?

10:48.440 --> 10:50.400
Eh, Hercules has a doggie tag.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.800
Is that in case Zeus forgets his name?

10:52.800 --> 10:56.560
The ticking clock of the planets aligning is arbitrary and lame and lazy.

10:56.560 --> 11:04.240
In 18 years, precisely, the planets will align.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.320
I mean, it's not like a plot hole, really.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.480
It's just a weak-ass ticking clock.

11:08.480 --> 11:11.720
Like on this day, the planets will make a doom tornado.

11:11.720 --> 11:15.960
And you couldn't do your god lightning thing before that, but you can now because the doom

11:15.960 --> 11:18.960
tornado got the water out of the way, I guess.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.360
Then again, a lot of shit in Greek mythology is arbitrary.

11:22.160 --> 11:25.440
See, she ate some pomegranate seeds.

11:25.440 --> 11:30.480
So now that means she has to come stay with me for half the year every year.

11:30.480 --> 11:33.200
That's according to the rules I just made up.

11:33.200 --> 11:37.960
Zeus has no problem getting the Titans underground the first time, but now with an army of gods,

11:37.960 --> 11:39.360
they are defeated almost immediately.

11:39.360 --> 11:42.000
Yeah, maybe they just got lazy.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.400
And possibly the biggest continuity error in any Disney movie.

11:45.400 --> 11:50.280
So this movie has a lot of problems like that, and they are a lot more egregious than other

11:50.280 --> 11:55.680
Disney movies, but unlike with Phantom Review, again, we already covered this sort of thing,

11:55.680 --> 11:58.720
I'm not really going to talk about the filmmaking so much.

11:58.720 --> 12:05.400
In this one, we're going to concentrate on structure, character, theme, and influence.

12:05.400 --> 12:09.600
So let's start with influence.

12:09.600 --> 12:13.480
In translating the story for a modern audience, Musker and Clements claimed that Hercules

12:13.480 --> 12:17.800
appealed to them because it would allow them to do a superhero story while also commenting

12:17.800 --> 12:20.600
on the world of celebrity athletes and endorsement deals.

12:20.600 --> 12:26.200
Okay, here's the thing, I can see where you would get that ancient Greek hero equals

12:26.200 --> 12:31.000
superhero plus sports star, but endorsement deals?

12:31.000 --> 12:36.680
Put a pin in that, we're going to come back to that, pin that up on the wall.

12:36.680 --> 12:38.840
Um, let's start with the hero thing.

12:38.840 --> 12:41.440
I happen to be a hero.

12:41.440 --> 12:46.240
The Greek idea of a hero, while bearing some similarities, is not the same as our modern

12:46.240 --> 12:47.640
idea of a hero.

12:47.640 --> 12:51.700
For the Greeks, heroes were in this context historical figures of cultural import who

12:51.700 --> 12:56.320
either did exceptional things or had exceptional abilities, and were almost always descended

12:56.320 --> 12:58.900
from Zeus, because Zeus got around.

12:58.900 --> 13:02.600
But they were important figures, not necessarily nice ones.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.680
And also, Greek heroes were deeply flawed.

13:04.680 --> 13:08.200
And I don't mean flawed as in snapping a guy's neck to save the world and did I do

13:08.200 --> 13:09.240
the right thing flawed.

13:09.240 --> 13:14.320
I mean like flew into a murderous god-induced panic and murder your wife and children flawed.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.640
Hercules did a lot of fucked up shit.

13:16.640 --> 13:20.720
A Disney hero is about as far cry as one can get from the traditional Greek hero.

13:20.720 --> 13:23.720
Greek heroes are always tragically flawed.

13:23.720 --> 13:27.000
Every Disney protagonist in the 90s' tragic flaw was clumsiness.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.360
He's too dangerous to be around normal people.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.920
An entire canon of Bella Swans.

13:32.920 --> 13:37.000
But let's say that, for the sake of argument, a hero is defined by our modern mythology

13:37.000 --> 13:38.720
as a superhero.

13:38.720 --> 13:41.880
In that case, a hero is defined by their selflessness.

13:41.880 --> 13:45.440
By contrast, Greek heroes were more about quests for glory.

13:45.440 --> 13:48.680
You know, Odysseus didn't go Odyssey-ing for the greater good.

13:48.680 --> 13:52.880
They were more defined by their importance to the culture than by their inherent goodness.

13:52.880 --> 13:57.960
And that way, they have more in common with, say, King Solomon of Israel than Superman.

13:57.960 --> 14:02.780
A historical-slash-religious figure rather than some ideal of morality.

14:02.780 --> 14:07.000
So the workaround here to make this work for our modern definition of a hero is that in

14:07.000 --> 14:12.200
this version of Ancient Greece, being a hero is like a job one can aspire to.

14:12.200 --> 14:15.220
He's just another chariot chaser.

14:15.220 --> 14:17.060
You know, like professional athlete.

14:17.060 --> 14:20.160
Which is an interesting idea, and I think works as a concept.

14:20.160 --> 14:23.920
But they have a lot of wiggle room in terms of story because most people, while familiar

14:23.920 --> 14:28.180
with the strongman Hercules archetype, aren't familiar with any of his stories.

14:28.180 --> 14:33.540
So the checklist for what people would have associated the word Hercules with in 1997,

14:33.540 --> 14:39.660
besides Kevin Sorbo, would have been A. Greek, B. Strong.

14:39.660 --> 14:40.660
And that's about it.

14:40.660 --> 14:42.660
Oh, he's a little Hercules.

14:42.660 --> 14:43.660
Show me muscle again.

14:43.660 --> 14:44.660
Oh, Hercules!

14:44.660 --> 14:45.660
Hercules!

14:45.660 --> 14:46.660
Hercules!

14:46.660 --> 14:50.460
Like, sure, nerds knew about the Twelve Leapers of Hercules and that Hades wasn't the bad

14:50.460 --> 14:54.460
guy, but if you're a normie back in 1995, the most obscure thing you probably knew about

14:54.460 --> 14:56.660
Hercules is that Arnold Schwarzenegger played him once.

14:56.660 --> 14:59.060
That is not Hercules.

14:59.060 --> 15:06.500
Some have stated, I have stated, that this movie borrows almost nothing from the mythology

15:06.500 --> 15:09.980
in terms of its story, and that's not entirely fair.

15:09.980 --> 15:12.580
In Hercules, the main threats come from the Titans.

15:12.580 --> 15:14.780
Olympus would be that way.

15:14.780 --> 15:20.580
At the beginning, it references the big battle, which is called the Titanomachy.

15:20.580 --> 15:21.580
Titanomachy?

15:21.580 --> 15:22.580
Titanomachy?

15:22.580 --> 15:23.580
Okay.

15:23.580 --> 15:30.620
Anyway, mythologically, Hercules had nothing to do with that, and the Titans never got

15:30.620 --> 15:31.620
out.

15:31.620 --> 15:35.380
But there was a less well-known myth known as the Gigantomachy, where the gods of Olympus

15:35.380 --> 15:38.000
fought a bunch of giants rather than titans.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.960
There was a prophecy in this that had it that the giants would only be defeated if

15:40.960 --> 15:44.440
a mortal was to help the gods, and Hercules did help out with that one.

15:44.440 --> 15:48.680
So in this movie, they basically combine the Gigantomachy and the Titanomachy, and that's

15:48.680 --> 15:49.680
fine.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.440
So the Titans in Hercules are basically a mush of everything.

15:52.440 --> 15:55.240
Giants, Titans, the Cyclops.

15:55.240 --> 15:58.000
And the Twelve Leapers of Hercules are there, sort of.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.720
They're just referenced visually during a montage.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.040
And then again here.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.080
So these guys clearly did their homework.

16:04.080 --> 16:09.320
There is much more here rooted in Greek mythology than people give it credit for.

16:09.320 --> 16:17.480
That said, the bulk of the story's influence is not from that.

16:17.480 --> 16:22.680
The two main influences in Disney's Hercules are Superman and Rocky.

16:22.680 --> 16:27.180
Rocky is a ragtag underdog story about a poor but plucky boxer who gets his chance when

16:27.180 --> 16:31.080
the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed, decides to have a fight against a nobody

16:31.080 --> 16:33.160
in order to stage a high-profile easy win.

16:33.240 --> 16:36.960
But Rocky trains really hard, and to everyone's shock, manages the whole 15 rounds against

16:36.960 --> 16:38.600
Creed, who only barely wins.

16:38.600 --> 16:44.120
But really, Rocky wins because love.

16:44.120 --> 16:48.520
And Superman is a Christ allegory about an alien man who comes to Earth already gifted

16:48.520 --> 16:53.120
with superhuman strength, powers, and compassion, and who is instructed by his alien ghost dad

16:53.120 --> 16:55.240
to go set a good example for the human.

16:55.520 --> 17:04.920
This reason above all, their capacity for good, I have sent them you, my only son.

17:04.920 --> 17:09.720
Hercules has to train, like Rocky, despite having been divinely given his gifts, like

17:09.720 --> 17:10.720
Superman.

17:10.720 --> 17:14.480
This is written off in the movie as he's clumsy, so he doesn't really need to learn

17:14.480 --> 17:19.320
how to do the thing, but rather how to control the thing that he's already been given.

17:19.320 --> 17:23.120
So rather than letting the movie be its own new thing that isn't overly derivative,

17:23.120 --> 17:25.520
All I want to do is go the distance.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.080
I can go the distance.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.080
Go the distance.

17:28.080 --> 17:29.160
Go the distance.

17:29.160 --> 17:32.560
the core of the film is trying to mush Rocky and Superman.

17:32.560 --> 17:37.440
It's not wrong, but it's not only a stretch in terms of things to try to combine, it's

17:37.440 --> 17:39.520
also just way too derivative.

17:39.520 --> 17:43.000
Because inspiration is one thing, but this movie goes way out of its way to let you know

17:43.000 --> 17:46.920
just how much it's lifting from other movies that, in the back of your mind, you're always

17:46.920 --> 17:50.660
reminded in this subconscious way how not only is this movie not letting itself be its

17:50.660 --> 17:54.020
own movie, but of these other, better movies it's lifting from.

17:54.020 --> 17:57.020
Like, maybe you don't hate Kid Rock's All Summer Long,

17:57.020 --> 18:01.020
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long.

18:01.020 --> 18:05.460
but it's always going to be this weird mush of Sweet Home Alabama and Werewolves of London,

18:05.460 --> 18:07.540
which given a second's thought is like, what?

18:11.540 --> 18:15.740
Sports movies typically end with a big match at the end, and superhero movies tend to have

18:15.740 --> 18:19.740
the hero's motivation derived from some sense of duty to serve and protect the masses.

18:19.820 --> 18:23.740
With great power comes great responsibility.

18:23.740 --> 18:28.660
As a sports movie, there is no big match Hercules is training for, and as a superhero movie,

18:28.660 --> 18:31.020
the hero part is just a means to an end.

18:31.020 --> 18:34.820
You'll get your chance, you just need some kind of catastrophe.

18:34.820 --> 18:38.300
Meg at one point even calls Hercules out on how he doesn't really care about the people

18:38.300 --> 18:40.300
he portends to want to save.

18:40.300 --> 18:41.300
Kids?

18:41.300 --> 18:42.300
Trapped?

18:42.300 --> 18:43.300
Phil!

18:43.300 --> 18:44.300
This is great!

18:44.300 --> 18:45.800
You're really choked up about this, aren't you?

18:45.860 --> 18:50.280
The movie kind of has a mean, dismissive attitude towards the populace at large.

18:50.280 --> 18:51.280
They are either catty,

18:51.280 --> 18:52.280
Yeah?

18:52.280 --> 18:54.040
And who are you?

18:54.040 --> 18:55.040
or judgmental,

18:55.040 --> 18:58.360
Have you ever reversed a natural disaster?

18:58.360 --> 19:00.280
or mindlessly sycophantic.

19:00.280 --> 19:02.080
They are just a means to an end.

19:02.080 --> 19:06.600
Rocky's story and Superman's story are non-complementary, so by combining them you

19:06.600 --> 19:10.280
have a Rocky movie where Rocky doesn't know what he's training for, and a Superman movie

19:10.280 --> 19:14.040
where Superman feels no sense of duty to the people and is only a hero to them because

19:14.040 --> 19:16.920
he's told that doing so will get him what he wants.

19:16.920 --> 19:21.400
So do you remember how we put a pin in the filmmakers wanting to comment on celebrity

19:21.400 --> 19:22.400
endorsement?

19:22.400 --> 19:25.240
Well, okay, we're back to that part now.

19:25.240 --> 19:30.400
When you're watching a movie, any movie, basically everything you see on the screen

19:30.400 --> 19:32.520
will contain some form of shorthand.

19:32.520 --> 19:36.560
For instance, here is Hercules getting down on his knees and praying to Zeus.

19:36.560 --> 19:37.560
Almighty Zeus?

19:37.560 --> 19:42.480
Now, a good boy in ancient Greece probably would have, you know, brought a goat and slaughtered

19:42.480 --> 19:47.760
it on that altar, you know, rather than getting down on his knees and praying like a Christian.

19:47.760 --> 19:49.200
Do things the proper way.

19:49.200 --> 19:53.120
The audience associates getting on their knees with piety, therefore this is shorthand.

19:53.120 --> 19:56.600
And this has nothing to do with historical accuracy and everything to do with using shorthand

19:56.600 --> 20:00.560
to get information to the audience using cultural knowledge the audience is presumably familiar

20:00.560 --> 20:01.560
with.

20:01.560 --> 20:04.960
Pop culture references became an increasingly popular form of shorthand in animation ever

20:04.960 --> 20:09.360
since Aladdin, and this movie has a lot of that.

20:09.360 --> 20:17.480
The audience is familiar with these things, and without the lines being drawn explicitly,

20:17.480 --> 20:21.520
our mid-90s audience is still able to draw the lines between Hercules and celebrity athletes

20:21.520 --> 20:25.240
being wealthy and endorsing products.

20:25.240 --> 20:34.920
Hercules isn't just Rocky and Superman, he's also Michael Jordan, from pain-wearing

20:34.920 --> 20:46.120
Air Herx to panic-consuming-then-not-McDonalds that Hercules has been celebrity-endorsing.

20:46.120 --> 20:49.840
How does this tie into the film thematically?

20:49.840 --> 20:53.760
After he trains with Phil, Hercules goes to Thebes, which is a thinly-veiled version of

20:53.760 --> 20:58.960
New York that was already dated in 1997.

20:58.960 --> 21:01.720
This is the big city in which Hercules goes to make it.

21:01.720 --> 21:05.800
Then Hades stages a battle with the intent of killing Hercules, but inadvertently makes

21:05.800 --> 21:07.840
him an overnight sensation.

21:07.840 --> 21:12.320
After that, we get a montage with all of these references to sports stardom—signing autographs,

21:12.320 --> 21:18.220
fans wearing his jersey, appearance fees, royalties, action figures, sweatshops making

21:18.220 --> 21:29.000
your product, endorsing fast foods, Air Jordans, our Herc had cash to burn, yeah, money, whoo!

21:29.720 --> 21:33.680
Hercules doesn't set out like, I'm going to go be a hero and that will net me fame

21:33.680 --> 21:35.360
and fortune, yay.

21:35.360 --> 21:39.660
Fame and fortune just kind of happened to him incidentally, so there was never a point

21:39.660 --> 21:43.680
where he sought out wealth and fortune and then learned the error of his ways.

21:43.680 --> 21:48.160
He never tries to win Meg over with his fame and fortune, it's just kind of there.

21:48.160 --> 21:52.800
And this would have worked if Hercules had a more arrogant starting point, or maybe had

21:52.800 --> 22:04.960
equated fame and fortune with personal worth, like Aladdin did, and Spider-Man did.

22:04.960 --> 22:07.800
This points to why Kuzco is a much more compelling character.

22:07.800 --> 22:12.040
He was genuinely flawed and arrogant, and eventually he learned the error of his ways.

22:12.040 --> 22:16.040
I'm not saying Hercules needed to be like Kuzco, but for wealth and fame to be framed

22:16.040 --> 22:21.080
as not the point of being a true hero, he kind of needed to want it.

22:21.080 --> 22:26.440
But he never cared about any of that, this isn't a character flaw.

22:26.440 --> 22:30.040
It doesn't corrupt him at all, it doesn't make him egotistical or make him lose sight

22:30.040 --> 22:31.600
of what it means to be a hero.

22:31.600 --> 22:35.120
In the end, the references end up kind of being hollow.

22:35.120 --> 22:39.560
It's less a comment on celebrity athlete endorsement culture, or homage to Rocky, than

22:39.560 --> 22:43.160
it's just trying to remind the audience something they're already familiar with without

22:43.160 --> 22:49.360
actually exploring it.

22:49.600 --> 22:52.720
Chosen One narratives are easy to write, because then you don't need to come up with a good

22:52.720 --> 22:55.940
and compelling reason for why our hero is the center of the conflict.

22:55.940 --> 22:58.800
But they're hard to make interesting, because there's no good and compelling reason for

22:58.800 --> 23:01.140
why our hero is the center of the conflict.

23:01.140 --> 23:04.560
And you notice that most popular heroes' journey stories don't involve a prophecy

23:04.560 --> 23:08.560
proclaiming them to be the Chosen One.

23:08.560 --> 23:14.140
Frodo wasn't prophesied, Katniss wasn't prophesied, Luke Skywalker wasn't prophesied,

23:14.140 --> 23:18.480
they were all ordinary people thrust into extraordinary circumstances by chance or plot

23:18.480 --> 23:20.800
stuff or them wanting to do a thing.

23:20.800 --> 23:25.560
The only real Chosen One character in the Star Wars universe is Anakin, and we all remember

23:25.560 --> 23:28.520
how that turned out.

23:28.520 --> 23:32.160
Even Harry Potter ends up being more of a send-up of Chosen One narratives than a Chosen

23:32.160 --> 23:38.360
One narrative played straight.

23:38.360 --> 23:42.000
His Chosen One-ness comes into play more in how people treat him than as it pertains to

23:42.000 --> 23:45.680
the actual plot, and most of the conflicts of the individual stories have more to do

23:45.680 --> 23:49.560
with the periphery of the universe as a whole, rather than the fact that Harry is the only

23:49.560 --> 23:51.400
person who can save the world.

23:51.400 --> 23:54.200
Which ultimately turns out not to be true, by the by.

23:54.200 --> 24:00.800
The Chosen One narrative was even more pointedly dissected in The Lego Movie, and the whole

24:00.800 --> 24:04.200
point of that ends up being that there is no Chosen One.

24:04.200 --> 24:08.000
Think Chosen One narratives work better in TV shows than in movies?

24:08.000 --> 24:11.680
Contrast this with something like Buffy, who was one in a long line of Chosen Ones and

24:11.680 --> 24:12.920
could die at any moment.

24:13.200 --> 24:16.680
Avatar The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra take a similar approach to their Chosen

24:16.680 --> 24:17.680
Ones.

24:17.680 --> 24:20.440
Their stories are about the day-to-day dealing with it.

24:20.440 --> 24:23.440
Disney movies mostly stayed away from Chosen One prophecies.

24:23.440 --> 24:29.600
The closest we get is probably Aladdin.

24:29.600 --> 24:33.640
Aladdin's Chosen One-ness is what gets him into the cave to get the lamp, but this aspect

24:33.640 --> 24:37.520
is completely done and over with by the end of Act 1 of the film, and the rest of the

24:37.520 --> 24:39.780
film's conflict has nothing to do with it.

24:39.780 --> 24:43.180
The momentum of the film is fully propelled by character motivation, and is rooted in

24:43.180 --> 24:44.180
actual stakes.

24:44.180 --> 24:51.980
Simba's arc has an element of destiny to it, but this has more to do with duty than

24:51.980 --> 24:52.980
prophecy.

24:52.980 --> 24:56.980
In Hercules, the only reason Hades has it in for Hercules is because the fates told

24:56.980 --> 24:58.380
him to.

24:58.380 --> 24:59.380
Because prophecy.

24:59.380 --> 25:03.160
And by the end of the film, they have built up to no enmity, because they don't really

25:03.160 --> 25:08.660
know each other, and they have no reason to be at odds with each other besides prophecy.

25:08.660 --> 25:12.780
And again, contrast this with the TV show, where they do know each other, and do develop

25:12.780 --> 25:13.780
a dynamic.

25:13.780 --> 25:16.780
Hey, if I could only turn one person to stone, I'm glad it was Jercules.

25:16.780 --> 25:17.780
I hate that kid.

25:17.780 --> 25:22.100
The only thing that makes Hercules special, the only reason Hades pays any attention to

25:22.100 --> 25:25.940
him at all, is a prophecy that Hercules has no idea about.

25:25.940 --> 25:31.740
Nearly every iota of plot momentum is manufactured by contrivances outside of Hercules' control.

25:31.740 --> 25:36.260
So the result is a story that is not being pushed by actions or character development,

25:36.260 --> 25:42.500
but is instead being pulled by its nose by the plot contrivance of destiny.

25:42.500 --> 25:49.580
So if you want to learn about screenwriting and screenplay structure, Disney's Hercules

25:49.580 --> 25:54.700
is the perfect vehicle for baby's first three act structure, because it is so carefully

25:54.700 --> 25:56.540
and clearly delineated.

25:56.540 --> 26:00.620
And if you're wondering why I'm taking the time to go through this, it's because I'm

26:00.620 --> 26:01.620
trying to save you.

26:01.620 --> 26:03.540
I'm trying to save you from the student loans.

26:03.540 --> 26:04.740
Don't go to film school.

26:04.740 --> 26:05.740
Watch internet videos.

26:06.220 --> 26:09.380
Hercules has a very simple, very traditional three act structure.

26:09.380 --> 26:12.980
So we can use this as an opportunity to examine story structure as it pertains to Hollywood

26:12.980 --> 26:13.980
movies.

26:13.980 --> 26:14.980
Backstory.

26:14.980 --> 26:19.060
We learn who Hercules is and how the universe works.

26:19.060 --> 26:20.060
Excuse me?

26:20.060 --> 26:24.140
Should Hercules fight, you will fail.

26:24.140 --> 26:25.140
Inciting incident.

26:25.140 --> 26:28.540
Hades hears the prophecy that Hercules will defeat him.

26:28.540 --> 26:31.100
This leads Hades to turning Hercules into a mortal.

26:31.100 --> 26:32.100
This is it.

26:32.100 --> 26:33.100
Don't you see?

26:33.100 --> 26:35.100
Maybe they have the answers.

26:35.460 --> 26:36.460
Point of attack.

26:36.460 --> 26:37.980
Hercules finds out that he's adopted.

26:37.980 --> 26:43.460
Now, some people say that point of attack and inciting incident are the same thing.

26:43.460 --> 26:45.020
And these people are wrong.

26:45.020 --> 26:47.420
The inciting incident sets the plot in motion.

26:47.420 --> 26:51.020
The point of attack is the moment the central conflict and character motivation appears

26:51.020 --> 26:53.660
and the primary action of the story can get moving.

26:53.660 --> 26:54.660
The central conflict.

26:54.660 --> 26:58.580
I feel like, like I really don't belong here.

26:58.580 --> 27:00.780
Hercules wants to find out where he belongs.

27:00.780 --> 27:02.860
This culminates at the end of act one.

27:02.860 --> 27:05.020
Hercules presents his central conflict to Zeus.

27:05.020 --> 27:06.020
Zeus tells him how to fix it.

27:06.020 --> 27:10.260
If you can prove yourself a true hero on earth, your godhood will be restored.

27:10.260 --> 27:13.500
This is called a lock-in, also known as the end of act one.

27:13.500 --> 27:15.900
Our hero has his quest and now he goes out to quest it.

27:15.900 --> 27:17.620
I won't let you down, father.

27:17.620 --> 27:21.420
Go be a true hero, Hercules, and that will solve your central conflict.

27:21.420 --> 27:24.060
Act two is typically split into two segments.

27:24.060 --> 27:30.620
In Hercules, these two segments are very clearly defined.

27:30.620 --> 27:34.140
A first culmination occurs at the end of the first half of the second act.

27:34.260 --> 27:37.220
In Hercules, it's where he proves himself by defeating Dehydra.

27:37.220 --> 27:40.140
The midpoint is Hercules attaining fame and fortune.

27:40.140 --> 27:44.740
Important to note also that the midpoint doesn't necessarily fall right in the middle of the

27:44.740 --> 27:45.780
movie.

27:45.780 --> 27:49.580
The Lion King has an unusually long first act and a really short second act, so its

27:49.580 --> 27:53.820
midpoint, which is where he meets up with Nala, happens around 60% through the movie.

27:53.820 --> 27:59.100
Gotta blaze, there's a whole cosmos up there waiting for me, with hey, my name on it.

27:59.100 --> 28:03.080
The end of act two also generally sees the resolution of the main tension.

28:03.080 --> 28:09.640
In this case, Hades releasing the Titans while building a new tension for act three.

28:09.640 --> 28:12.840
The Titans now having been released, now we have to go defeat them.

28:12.840 --> 28:16.920
This is called the main culmination and usually coincides with the hero being at his lowest

28:16.920 --> 28:17.920
point.

28:17.920 --> 28:26.920
Again, illustrated really, really clearly here.

28:26.920 --> 28:30.000
Twist in the third act, Meg sacrifices herself for Hercules.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.600
Hercules gets his strength back.

28:31.600 --> 28:35.520
The twist in the third act is important because it shifts the focus of the final tension.

28:35.520 --> 28:39.440
The main tension is no longer, will we defeat the Titans, which is part of what makes his

28:39.440 --> 28:43.200
little cul-de-sac where he actually does go and wackily defeat the Titans all the more

28:43.200 --> 28:47.280
problematic for the tone, by the by.

28:47.280 --> 28:48.560
It's will Meg die.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.280
The stakes are much higher.

28:51.280 --> 28:58.760
Climax, Hercules sacrifices himself for Meg, becomes a true hero.

28:58.760 --> 29:08.160
Now here's the thing, central conflict.

29:08.160 --> 29:12.160
The central conflict in pretty much all of the 90s Disney movies was about self-identity

29:12.160 --> 29:13.840
and finding oneself.

29:13.840 --> 29:17.680
And Hercules is probably the most overt in that regard alongside Tarzan.

29:17.680 --> 29:19.400
Both have the same central conflict.

29:19.400 --> 29:22.600
I am an outsider and I want to find out where I belong.

29:22.600 --> 29:24.080
And same resolution.

29:24.080 --> 29:25.920
This sexy lady is where I belong.

29:25.920 --> 29:26.920
Resolution.

29:27.160 --> 29:31.120
You were willing to give your life to rescue this young woman.

29:31.120 --> 29:35.600
So the resolution resolves the conflict between sports star equals self-serving and superhero

29:35.600 --> 29:40.400
equals selfless, but it does not resolve Hercules' central conflict.

29:40.400 --> 29:45.560
Which brings us to...

29:45.560 --> 29:49.600
In screenplay terms, motivation is described as want versus need.

29:49.600 --> 29:54.040
In a story, a character needs to grow or change or learn something for a satisfying character

29:54.040 --> 29:55.040
arc.

29:55.040 --> 29:58.120
Not all the time, but in Disney movies, yeah, all the time.

29:58.120 --> 30:01.920
And generally, the want and the need are related but aren't necessarily the same thing.

30:01.920 --> 30:04.520
The character is motivated by a want set up in the first act.

30:04.520 --> 30:07.160
I want to be where the people are.

30:07.160 --> 30:12.160
I want adventure in the great wide somewhere.

30:12.160 --> 30:19.280
Just to live one day out there.

30:19.280 --> 30:22.720
And their growth is detailed by meeting a need at the end of the third act.

30:22.720 --> 30:23.720
Aladdin, want.

30:23.720 --> 30:24.720
We'll be rich.

30:24.720 --> 30:25.720
Live in a palace.

30:25.720 --> 30:26.720
Need.

30:26.720 --> 30:30.520
I gotta start pretending to be something I'm not.

30:30.520 --> 30:31.520
Simba, want.

30:31.520 --> 30:32.520
I guess you can change the past.

30:32.520 --> 30:33.520
Need.

30:33.520 --> 30:34.520
Yes, the past can't hurt.

30:34.520 --> 30:41.560
But the way I see it, you can either run from it or learn from it.

30:41.560 --> 30:45.160
So one fine day, Hercules finds out he's adopted and he goes to find out what's up.

30:45.160 --> 30:47.240
Why do I feel so out of place, mom and dad?

30:47.240 --> 30:48.240
Go find out.

30:48.240 --> 30:49.240
Good.

30:49.240 --> 30:50.240
Go.

30:50.240 --> 30:51.240
Fine.

30:51.240 --> 30:52.240
Good.

30:52.240 --> 30:53.240
Perfectly good starting point.

30:53.760 --> 30:58.120
And you need to learn to become a hero so you can be a god again.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.720
And Hercules is like, okay, that makes perfect sense.

31:00.720 --> 31:02.600
I'll go learn to be a true hero.

31:02.600 --> 31:03.600
So Hercules' want.

31:03.600 --> 31:04.600
To find where I belong.

31:04.600 --> 31:13.400
And his need, which is being selfless is the mark of a true hero.

31:13.400 --> 31:16.360
Well, one doesn't really build to the other.

31:16.360 --> 31:20.360
This culminates when he sacrifices himself for Meg, which would indicate that he needed

31:20.360 --> 31:24.800
to learn that being a hero is self-sacrificing, but that doesn't really have anything to

31:24.800 --> 31:29.720
do with his main motivation, which is to find out where he belongs, or to resolve some character

31:29.720 --> 31:30.720
flaw.

31:30.720 --> 31:33.240
He was always kind of an innocent nice guy.

31:33.240 --> 31:39.240
Not the most altruistic, but not exactly selfish either.

31:39.240 --> 31:43.400
Hercules wants basically the same things as Aladdin, but he gets that halfway through

31:43.400 --> 31:44.500
the movie.

31:44.500 --> 31:47.820
He never has to accept himself to be respected by the masses.

31:47.820 --> 31:52.540
So self-sacrifice is noble, sure, but it's not a culminating moment for his character

31:52.540 --> 31:58.060
like it was for, say, Kuzco, who was selfish, or Aladdin, who was pretending to be something

31:58.060 --> 31:59.060
he wasn't.

31:59.060 --> 32:04.140
Basically, his want, a sense of belonging, and his need, being self-sacrificing, don't

32:04.140 --> 32:05.940
really have anything to do with each other.

32:05.940 --> 32:09.220
One does not resolve the other, which makes for a weak character arc.

32:09.220 --> 32:13.340
And you could say, but Hades, but the Hades plot isn't relevant to Hercules' motivation

32:13.340 --> 32:17.000
because at no point does Hercules even learn about the prophecy, and he doesn't even

32:17.000 --> 32:22.000
meet Hades up until the end of the movie, which also makes this showdown kind of limp.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.800
Let her go.

32:23.800 --> 32:27.440
I've been waiting for this moment for ten minutes.

32:27.440 --> 32:28.800
Look again at Aladdin.

32:28.800 --> 32:33.920
The thing that he and Jafar are fighting over, namely the genie, is directly related to Aladdin's

32:33.920 --> 32:34.920
character growth.

32:34.920 --> 32:37.800
There is a point where Aladdin decides he won't let the genie go because the genie

32:37.800 --> 32:40.280
helps him maintain his facade.

32:40.280 --> 32:42.800
Without you, I'm just Aladdin.

32:42.800 --> 32:46.000
But his character arc culminates with him letting the genie go.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.080
And Aladdin's growth also relates to the antagonist, Jafar, because letting the genie

32:50.080 --> 32:52.640
go is something Jafar would never do.

32:52.640 --> 32:56.480
At its core, the problem with Hercules' motivation is that, unlike all of the other

32:56.480 --> 32:58.840
Disney characters, it's not an internal motivation.

32:58.840 --> 33:03.560
But if I don't become a true hero, I'll never be able to rejoin my father, Zeus.

33:03.560 --> 33:05.980
He doesn't want to be a hero because he wants it.

33:05.980 --> 33:07.880
He wants it because he was told to.

33:07.880 --> 33:12.800
Some of the most memorable characters in the last twenty years, Walter White, Tony Soprano,

33:12.800 --> 33:15.080
Cersei Lannister, Daniel Plainview,

33:16.720 --> 33:21.440
these characters do some fucked up shit and are rarely if ever sympathetic, but the audience

33:21.440 --> 33:24.280
engages with them highly because they are highly motivated.

33:24.280 --> 33:26.240
You're goddamn right.

33:26.240 --> 33:29.360
And you see this more on television because you have a lot more time to really explore

33:29.360 --> 33:31.080
character depth and nuance.

33:31.080 --> 33:34.360
And I use these characters as examples, not because they belong in Disney movies, but

33:34.360 --> 33:38.600
to illustrate that it is more important for a character to be motivated than to be sympathetic

33:38.600 --> 33:39.600
or relatable.

33:39.600 --> 33:42.200
Hercules is certainly the latter, but not the former.

33:42.200 --> 33:45.240
And even though on a personal level I really hate most movies that have some sort of

33:45.240 --> 33:48.520
YOU LIED TO ME engineered conflict, let's ignore that.

33:48.520 --> 33:52.360
Meg's character arc is much stronger than Hercules because her stakes are much higher,

33:52.360 --> 33:55.080
her dilemma more intense, and her motivations clearer.

33:55.080 --> 33:58.720
Even though history has taught her that she can't trust men or her own feelings, which

33:58.720 --> 34:01.600
her bitchy gay boyfriend Hades details explicitly.

34:01.600 --> 34:02.600
This one is different.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.080
He's honest and he's sweet.

34:04.080 --> 34:05.080
Please.

34:05.080 --> 34:06.080
He would never do anything to hurt me.

34:06.080 --> 34:07.080
He's a guy.

34:07.080 --> 34:08.400
You deserve a better movie, Meg.

34:08.400 --> 34:11.400
In fact, everyone in this movie deserves a better movie.

34:11.400 --> 34:12.720
Meg deserves a better movie.

34:12.720 --> 34:14.560
Hercules deserves a better movie.

34:14.560 --> 34:16.360
Hades deserves a better movie.

34:16.360 --> 34:19.080
Phil, actually no, not Phil, f**k Phil.

34:19.080 --> 34:21.240
I'm real too.

34:21.240 --> 34:22.560
Dang it!

34:22.560 --> 34:24.920
When I say I'm fond of this movie, that is what I mean.

34:24.920 --> 34:31.880
I'm fond of the characters, I'm fond of the style, I'm fond of the idea, of the tone,

34:31.880 --> 34:36.960
you know, when it's being fun and actually enjoyable.

34:36.960 --> 34:42.400
The bones of the thing I am not fond of, and that is one of the most important parts

34:42.400 --> 34:43.400
of any movie.

34:43.400 --> 34:46.680
To make it clear, I do not mean to say that there was nothing risky or new or innovative

34:46.680 --> 34:47.680
in this movie.

34:47.680 --> 34:48.680
Far from it.

34:48.680 --> 34:51.880
It has the first Disney heroine who starts out in league with the bad guy, and who's

34:51.880 --> 34:56.360
not only got a past with men, but she's gotta be pushing 30 given how world-weary she is.

34:56.360 --> 34:57.800
Well, you know how men are.

34:57.800 --> 35:01.440
They think no means yes and get lost means take me, I'm yours.

35:01.440 --> 35:04.800
Don't worry, Shorty here can explain it to you later.

35:04.800 --> 35:06.580
Like I said, f**k Phil.

35:06.580 --> 35:10.180
The risk of going with a straight comedic villain is one of the best things in the movie,

35:10.180 --> 35:11.860
despite the tonal problems.

35:11.860 --> 35:17.580
This is also the first Disney movie since, uh, Fantasia, uh, yeah, to have named black

35:17.580 --> 35:18.580
characters.

35:18.580 --> 35:19.580
Yep, 1997.

35:19.580 --> 35:21.820
That's how long it took.

35:21.820 --> 35:25.820
This is one of the most stylized of the Disney canon, thanks in large part to the filmmakers

35:25.820 --> 35:28.460
hiring Gerald Scarfe as the concept artist.

35:28.460 --> 35:31.940
He was a New Yorker cartoonist, but at the time, he was most famous for doing the art

35:31.940 --> 35:33.740
for Pink Floyd's The Wall.

35:33.740 --> 35:37.100
And the style Scarfe came up with for the movie was pretty out there, but you can totally

35:37.100 --> 35:39.420
see its influence in the finished product.

35:39.420 --> 35:41.620
And here is the sad irony of Hercules.

35:41.620 --> 35:46.260
Like Hercules learning to be a hero as a means to a different, unrelated end, Musker and

35:46.260 --> 35:50.260
Clements made Hercules as a means to a different, unrelated project.

35:50.260 --> 35:53.540
They had to do this thing in order to earn the thing they actually cared about.

35:53.540 --> 35:58.460
Katzenberg left Disney in 1994 under not very friendly circumstances, but the studio made

35:58.460 --> 36:00.540
good on Katzenberg's promise.

36:00.540 --> 36:02.140
And Treasure Planet exists.

36:02.140 --> 36:06.660
I found it pretty unmemorable, and to this day is the biggest flop Musker and Clements

36:06.660 --> 36:08.100
were involved in.

36:08.100 --> 36:10.460
And I take no schadenfreude in that.

36:10.460 --> 36:14.940
Let me be clear, I actually really respect these guys and what they've done for animation,

36:14.940 --> 36:15.940
but it didn't ruin them.

36:15.940 --> 36:16.940
They're fine.

36:16.940 --> 36:17.940
They're doing fine.

36:17.940 --> 36:22.460
Everything good and memorable about Hercules stems from the filmmakers taking risk.

36:22.460 --> 36:24.980
And that is the essence of really great films.

36:24.980 --> 36:29.980
It is a combination of risk and of cliché, of new and of safe.

36:29.980 --> 36:35.220
The art is in how you weave the two together.

36:35.220 --> 36:36.220
So now that's it.

36:36.220 --> 36:38.460
We can finally put it to rest.

36:38.460 --> 36:44.180
The long-standing mystery of what exactly made Hercules kind of meh in the eyes of the

36:44.180 --> 36:46.420
public and Disney.

36:46.420 --> 36:52.060
And to those of you who look down on me and people like me who just tried for so long

36:52.060 --> 36:59.340
to do this Hercules dissection thing, to you I say, there are dozens of us.

36:59.340 --> 37:01.020
Dozens!
