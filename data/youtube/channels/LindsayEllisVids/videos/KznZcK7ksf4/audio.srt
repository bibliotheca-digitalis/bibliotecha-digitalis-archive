1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,200
Long ago, in the faraway land of ancient Burbank, was a golden age of powerful animation and

2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,200
extraordinary directors.

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:26,600
And the greatest and strongest of all these directors was the mighty Musker and Clements.

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,160
Our story actually begins with The Great Mouse Detective.

5
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,160
No, really.

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,520
Well, actually, no, you could easily say it begins before that, but for our purposes,

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,680
let's say it begins with The Great Mouse Detective.

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,400
This film had four credited directors, these two guys named John Musker and Ron Clements

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,280
among them, and The Great Mouse Detective did okay enough that Disney was willing to

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,760
give some of these directors bigger projects.

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,080
Jeffrey Katzenberg was in charge of Disney Animation at the time, and he wanted to bring

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,120
Disney Animation Studios back to its former glory.

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,480
So, in a pitch meeting in 1985, Ron Clements pitched two projects of note, an adaptation

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,520
of Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid, and what was effectively Treasure

15
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,920
Island in Space.

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,320
And Jeffrey Katzenberg was like, hmm, that sounds kind of stupid.

17
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,040
Maybe keep workshopping that.

18
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,640
But that mermaid thing seems legit, let's do that.

19
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,120
And Clements was like, okay.

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,000
And so, with his former Great Mouse Detective co-director, John Musker, they go off and

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,200
make The Little Mermaid.

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,600
The Little Mermaid ended up doing gangbusters for the studio and ushering a new era of animation.

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,080
So they come back to Katzenberg like, hey, so about that Treasure Island in spit, and

24
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,320
Katzenberg is like, hey, actually, one of our former animators has been working on this

25
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,640
intricate and deeply artistic Arabian Nights type thing for like a decade, so let's rip

26
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,800
that off and release him before he can even finish his.

27
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,000
And so they're like, okay.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,880
And then Musker and Clements go make Aladdin.

29
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,840
And Aladdin makes even more money for the studio.

30
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,880
And suddenly Disney's back on track, in no small part thanks to these two guys.

31
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,600
So now with two big hits under their belt, Musker and Clements go back to Katzenberg like,

32
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,160
hey, look how successful we are, can we please make Treasure Planet now?

33
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,320
And Katzenberg is like, I don't know, that still sounds pretty stupid, but I tell you

34
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,440
what, you make me one more movie that does impossibly well at the box office, something

35
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,400
that has every commercially viable element imaginable, thereby rendering it impossible

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,120
to fail, and lets you make your project that you actually care about.

37
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,900
And lo, so that these guys could finally make their beloved Treasure Planet, they first

38
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,640
had to create the most commercially viable thing you can imagine, aggressively tailored

39
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,320
to appeal to as wide a demographic as possible, referencing as many popular 90s things as

40
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,480
would fit in its 89 minute runtime, and combining such dissonant tones and styles that audiences

41
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:43,480
across the land would...eh, it was okay, I guess.

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:51,520
This movie is not a disaster, there's a lot about it that I like, both its villain

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,760
and its art design rank among my favorites in all of Disneydom, but the film didn't

44
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:03,120
do well upon release, and Disney then basically swept it under the rug.

45
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,320
And years have passed since 1997, empires have risen and fallen, entire civilizations

46
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:15,480
swept off the map, all having never found the answer to that one burning question, why

47
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,880
did Disney's Hercules underperform?

48
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:38,080
I mean, I know, it is one of the most important issues of our day, and no one is courageous

49
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:46,160
enough to talk about it, except me, and obviously, there's a lot to talk about.

50
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,880
Look at how long this video is.

51
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:54,040
Cause it's not actively bad, there is a lot, in fact, that is great about this movie,

52
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,440
but why is it on the whole not as good as the sum of its parts?

53
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:06,880
I've spent the bitter part of two decades unraveling this mystery, someone's gotta

54
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,000
do it, apparently.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,760
I count Hercules, as a whole, as generally the weakest of the 90s Disney movies, and

56
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,520
this was a decade with singing, dancing gargoyles rhyming Adonis with croissant-es.

57
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,360
Now when I say weak, I don't mean actively inept, see the Phantom of the Opera review

58
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,320
for that, and I don't mean being inaccurate to the source material either, if you, like

59
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,040
me, were an insufferable 12 year old at the time, most of your criticism probably boiled

60
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,520
down to it not being faithful to the mythology.

61
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,760
And just for clarity's sake, I'm calling him Hercules, not Heracles, so just get that

62
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,160
out of your system, comment, whatever, I don't care.

63
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,860
When I talk about parts versus whole, Hercules had elements that were really great, but when

64
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,320
put together, it just didn't really jive.

65
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,440
Pocahontas, I think, is the worst of the 90s Disney movies because it's more boring and

66
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:04,560
less good, but I'd call it also a stronger movie because the parts gel, the tone is consistent,

67
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,840
the stakes are high, and the motivations are clear.

68
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,880
Hunchback of Notre Dame has a similar, albeit flipped, tone problem as Hercules, but again,

69
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,360
has a much stronger whole.

70
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,960
I probably would have never even noticed the tone problem if I hadn't run across Hercules

71
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,400
the Animated Series when I was in college.

72
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,920
There are some definite duds of episodes in that, especially considering the budget

73
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,160
was basically $10 per episode once the movie underperformed, and some main characters that

74
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:35,600
are really fucking annoying, but I think the Animated Series embodies what the movie should

75
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,600
have been.

76
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,320
The Animated Series doesn't bother with those massive plot contrivances.

77
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,920
It completely ignores the really important plot point in the movie that Hades didn't

78
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,880
know Hercules was alive the whole time, which is good because that never made sense anyway.

79
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,840
What I think Hercules wanted to be was what The Emperor's New Groove actually succeeded

80
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,120
in doing, a comedic take on a mythologized history.

81
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:07,680
Sincere, sure, but ultimately a fun romp that never took itself too seriously.

82
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,800
What Hercules ended up being was EVERY FUCKING THING UNDER THE SUN.

83
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,960
Which I guess was kind of inevitable, given that you were instructed by corporate to make

84
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,840
it everything to everyone, and whether or not you get to make your passion project is

85
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,760
on the line.

86
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,040
Let's discuss.

87
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,400
This movie is a comedy, arguably more than any other Disney movie that came out that

88
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
decade.

89
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Two words.

90
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
I.

91
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
Am.

92
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Retired.

93
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,820
At least as far as the marketing goes.

94
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,320
That wouldn't be a problem or even noteworthy, except that this has some of the darkest stuff

95
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
in all of Disney-dom.

96
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:51,880
Yep, that woman just got crushed by a several ton stone column.

97
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,440
I'm going to use this one scene as an example.

98
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,340
So this entire climactic scene where Hercules goes and fights the Titans is dogged by this

99
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,340
tonal yo-yoing.

100
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,240
Megara gets squished.

101
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,440
Somehow she's still breathing.

102
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,440
Okay.

103
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,520
Hercules races off and all sense of Megara-related urgency is lost.

104
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,000
We revert right back to that comedic tone.

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,240
And it almost feels like the gods didn't really need Hercules.

106
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,000
They just needed, like, moral support or a cheerleader.

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,880
And this scene goes by so fast.

108
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,880
Zeus lobs a couple of lightning bolts, Hercules then sucks them into the tornado giant and

109
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:37,000
lobs them into the sky and the plot explodes.

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And that's the end of that.

111
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,760
And they're laughing and giving high-fives and then Hades reminds them that Meg is dying.

112
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,320
Like Hercules had completely forgotten about that little detail.

113
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,040
And then less than 30 seconds after wacky nonsense, we're down here like...

114
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,040
No!

115
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:59,560
Yeah, this movie's got a tone problem.

116
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:07,000
It's not as bad as Hunchback, though.

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,520
And since you people love that nitpicky plot hole crap, I'm gonna go ahead and get that

118
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,720
out of the way before we get into the deeper stuff.

119
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,240
I mean, who are we kidding?

120
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
I love it too.

121
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:28,120
So I feel like there is a difference between a plot hole and just a contrivance, but I

122
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,480
don't think it's necessarily like a black or white thing.

123
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,080
It's, you know, more of a gradient.

124
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,360
That said, Hades orders his minions to kill Hercules as a baby, and he doesn't find out

125
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:44,680
that they failed until 18 years later.

126
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,840
Hades apparently doesn't talk to any of the gods.

127
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,240
I mean, this kid's your nephew.

128
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,120
How did you miss that you failed to kill him for 18 years?

129
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,600
I mean, Zeus ordered all of the gods to go look for him.

130
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,320
You'd think he'd have at least, you know, sent a memo to the underworld.

131
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,360
Also, Hades, you seem like a smart guy.

132
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:08,920
You wouldn't want to, you know, check, make sure your bumbling minions got the job done?

133
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,320
I mean, it's not like they're related or anything.

134
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:20,320
The fates?

135
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,880
I thought you knew everything.

136
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:30,720
Hades, the villain, makes two bargains with Hercules, and keeps both of them.

137
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,360
Hercules, the hero, makes one bargain with Hades, and does not keep it.

138
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,840
You get her out, she goes.

139
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,840
You stay.

140
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,840
Our hero.

141
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:46,800
Anyway, that's not really a plot hole so much as a raging hypocrisy, but I guess that's

142
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,600
what you get when your villain is way more likable than your hero.

143
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,200
Actually, I'd love to see a version of this where Hercules keeps his end of the bargain,

144
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,600
and Meg goes, and he stays, and it turns into like Beauty and the Beast, and they kind of

145
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,720
hate each other at first, but then like Hades learned to change his ways, and it's just

146
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,280
a love story for the ages.

147
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,520
God damn, I would watch the shit out of that movie.

148
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,760
If you can prove yourself a true hero on Earth, your godhood will be restored.

149
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,120
I can't just make you a god.

150
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,840
Is that a hard and fast rule?

151
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,800
Any true hero attains godhood?

152
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,040
Or does it only apply to ex-gods who drank Hades' mortality juice?

153
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,240
Speaking of which, how do we get around Hercules' immortality?

154
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,520
I think you gotta turn the little sunspot...

155
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,520
Mortal.

156
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:37,440
Eh, Hades has this juice floating in a room devoted to the juice that robs gods of their

157
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
immortality.

158
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,640
He calls it his pink juice room.

159
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
Where did he get the juice?

160
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,640
Who knows?

161
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,760
Why does he only have one juice?

162
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,000
Who knows?

163
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,440
Why hasn't he used it on Zeus before this?

164
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,400
Eh, Hercules has a doggie tag.

165
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,800
Is that in case Zeus forgets his name?

166
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,560
The ticking clock of the planets aligning is arbitrary and lame and lazy.

167
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:04,240
In 18 years, precisely, the planets will align.

168
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,320
I mean, it's not like a plot hole, really.

169
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,480
It's just a weak-ass ticking clock.

170
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,720
Like on this day, the planets will make a doom tornado.

171
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,960
And you couldn't do your god lightning thing before that, but you can now because the doom

172
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,960
tornado got the water out of the way, I guess.

173
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,360
Then again, a lot of shit in Greek mythology is arbitrary.

174
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,440
See, she ate some pomegranate seeds.

175
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,480
So now that means she has to come stay with me for half the year every year.

176
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,200
That's according to the rules I just made up.

177
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,960
Zeus has no problem getting the Titans underground the first time, but now with an army of gods,

178
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,360
they are defeated almost immediately.

179
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,000
Yeah, maybe they just got lazy.

180
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,400
And possibly the biggest continuity error in any Disney movie.

181
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,280
So this movie has a lot of problems like that, and they are a lot more egregious than other

182
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:55,680
Disney movies, but unlike with Phantom Review, again, we already covered this sort of thing,

183
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,720
I'm not really going to talk about the filmmaking so much.

184
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:05,400
In this one, we're going to concentrate on structure, character, theme, and influence.

185
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,600
So let's start with influence.

186
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,480
In translating the story for a modern audience, Musker and Clements claimed that Hercules

187
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,800
appealed to them because it would allow them to do a superhero story while also commenting

188
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,600
on the world of celebrity athletes and endorsement deals.

189
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,200
Okay, here's the thing, I can see where you would get that ancient Greek hero equals

190
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,000
superhero plus sports star, but endorsement deals?

191
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,680
Put a pin in that, we're going to come back to that, pin that up on the wall.

192
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,840
Um, let's start with the hero thing.

193
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,440
I happen to be a hero.

194
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,240
The Greek idea of a hero, while bearing some similarities, is not the same as our modern

195
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,640
idea of a hero.

196
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,700
For the Greeks, heroes were in this context historical figures of cultural import who

197
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,320
either did exceptional things or had exceptional abilities, and were almost always descended

198
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,900
from Zeus, because Zeus got around.

199
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,600
But they were important figures, not necessarily nice ones.

200
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,680
And also, Greek heroes were deeply flawed.

201
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,200
And I don't mean flawed as in snapping a guy's neck to save the world and did I do

202
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,240
the right thing flawed.

203
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,320
I mean like flew into a murderous god-induced panic and murder your wife and children flawed.

204
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,640
Hercules did a lot of fucked up shit.

205
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,720
A Disney hero is about as far cry as one can get from the traditional Greek hero.

206
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,720
Greek heroes are always tragically flawed.

207
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,000
Every Disney protagonist in the 90s' tragic flaw was clumsiness.

208
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,360
He's too dangerous to be around normal people.

209
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,920
An entire canon of Bella Swans.

210
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,000
But let's say that, for the sake of argument, a hero is defined by our modern mythology

211
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,720
as a superhero.

212
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,880
In that case, a hero is defined by their selflessness.

213
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,440
By contrast, Greek heroes were more about quests for glory.

214
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,680
You know, Odysseus didn't go Odyssey-ing for the greater good.

215
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,880
They were more defined by their importance to the culture than by their inherent goodness.

216
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,960
And that way, they have more in common with, say, King Solomon of Israel than Superman.

217
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,780
A historical-slash-religious figure rather than some ideal of morality.

218
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:07,000
So the workaround here to make this work for our modern definition of a hero is that in

219
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,200
this version of Ancient Greece, being a hero is like a job one can aspire to.

220
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,220
He's just another chariot chaser.

221
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,060
You know, like professional athlete.

222
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,160
Which is an interesting idea, and I think works as a concept.

223
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,920
But they have a lot of wiggle room in terms of story because most people, while familiar

224
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,180
with the strongman Hercules archetype, aren't familiar with any of his stories.

225
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:33,540
So the checklist for what people would have associated the word Hercules with in 1997,

226
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:39,660
besides Kevin Sorbo, would have been A. Greek, B. Strong.

227
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,660
And that's about it.

228
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,660
Oh, he's a little Hercules.

229
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,660
Show me muscle again.

230
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,660
Oh, Hercules!

231
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,660
Hercules!

232
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,660
Hercules!

233
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,460
Like, sure, nerds knew about the Twelve Leapers of Hercules and that Hades wasn't the bad

234
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:54,460
guy, but if you're a normie back in 1995, the most obscure thing you probably knew about

235
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,660
Hercules is that Arnold Schwarzenegger played him once.

236
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,060
That is not Hercules.

237
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:06,500
Some have stated, I have stated, that this movie borrows almost nothing from the mythology

238
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,980
in terms of its story, and that's not entirely fair.

239
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,580
In Hercules, the main threats come from the Titans.

240
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,780
Olympus would be that way.

241
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:20,580
At the beginning, it references the big battle, which is called the Titanomachy.

242
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,580
Titanomachy?

243
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,580
Titanomachy?

244
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,580
Okay.

245
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:30,620
Anyway, mythologically, Hercules had nothing to do with that, and the Titans never got

246
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,620
out.

247
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,380
But there was a less well-known myth known as the Gigantomachy, where the gods of Olympus

248
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,000
fought a bunch of giants rather than titans.

249
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,960
There was a prophecy in this that had it that the giants would only be defeated if

250
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,440
a mortal was to help the gods, and Hercules did help out with that one.

251
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,680
So in this movie, they basically combine the Gigantomachy and the Titanomachy, and that's

252
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,680
fine.

253
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,440
So the Titans in Hercules are basically a mush of everything.

254
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,240
Giants, Titans, the Cyclops.

255
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,000
And the Twelve Leapers of Hercules are there, sort of.

256
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,720
They're just referenced visually during a montage.

257
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,040
And then again here.

258
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,080
So these guys clearly did their homework.

259
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,320
There is much more here rooted in Greek mythology than people give it credit for.

260
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:17,480
That said, the bulk of the story's influence is not from that.

261
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,680
The two main influences in Disney's Hercules are Superman and Rocky.

262
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,180
Rocky is a ragtag underdog story about a poor but plucky boxer who gets his chance when

263
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,080
the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed, decides to have a fight against a nobody

264
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,160
in order to stage a high-profile easy win.

265
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,960
But Rocky trains really hard, and to everyone's shock, manages the whole 15 rounds against

266
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,600
Creed, who only barely wins.

267
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,120
But really, Rocky wins because love.

268
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,520
And Superman is a Christ allegory about an alien man who comes to Earth already gifted

269
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:53,120
with superhuman strength, powers, and compassion, and who is instructed by his alien ghost dad

270
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,240
to go set a good example for the human.

271
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:04,920
This reason above all, their capacity for good, I have sent them you, my only son.

272
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,720
Hercules has to train, like Rocky, despite having been divinely given his gifts, like

273
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Superman.

274
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,480
This is written off in the movie as he's clumsy, so he doesn't really need to learn

275
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,320
how to do the thing, but rather how to control the thing that he's already been given.

276
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,120
So rather than letting the movie be its own new thing that isn't overly derivative,

277
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,520
All I want to do is go the distance.

278
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,080
I can go the distance.

279
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,080
Go the distance.

280
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,160
Go the distance.

281
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,560
the core of the film is trying to mush Rocky and Superman.

282
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,440
It's not wrong, but it's not only a stretch in terms of things to try to combine, it's

283
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,520
also just way too derivative.

284
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,000
Because inspiration is one thing, but this movie goes way out of its way to let you know

285
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,920
just how much it's lifting from other movies that, in the back of your mind, you're always

286
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,660
reminded in this subconscious way how not only is this movie not letting itself be its

287
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,020
own movie, but of these other, better movies it's lifting from.

288
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,020
Like, maybe you don't hate Kid Rock's All Summer Long,

289
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,020
Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long.

290
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,460
but it's always going to be this weird mush of Sweet Home Alabama and Werewolves of London,

291
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,540
which given a second's thought is like, what?

292
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,740
Sports movies typically end with a big match at the end, and superhero movies tend to have

293
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,740
the hero's motivation derived from some sense of duty to serve and protect the masses.

294
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,740
With great power comes great responsibility.

295
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,660
As a sports movie, there is no big match Hercules is training for, and as a superhero movie,

296
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,020
the hero part is just a means to an end.

297
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,820
You'll get your chance, you just need some kind of catastrophe.

298
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,300
Meg at one point even calls Hercules out on how he doesn't really care about the people

299
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,300
he portends to want to save.

300
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,300
Kids?

301
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,300
Trapped?

302
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,300
Phil!

303
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,300
This is great!

304
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,800
You're really choked up about this, aren't you?

305
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:50,280
The movie kind of has a mean, dismissive attitude towards the populace at large.

306
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
They are either catty,

307
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Yeah?

308
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,040
And who are you?

309
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,040
or judgmental,

310
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,360
Have you ever reversed a natural disaster?

311
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,280
or mindlessly sycophantic.

312
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,080
They are just a means to an end.

313
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,600
Rocky's story and Superman's story are non-complementary, so by combining them you

314
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,280
have a Rocky movie where Rocky doesn't know what he's training for, and a Superman movie

315
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,040
where Superman feels no sense of duty to the people and is only a hero to them because

316
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,920
he's told that doing so will get him what he wants.

317
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,400
So do you remember how we put a pin in the filmmakers wanting to comment on celebrity

318
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
endorsement?

319
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,240
Well, okay, we're back to that part now.

320
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,400
When you're watching a movie, any movie, basically everything you see on the screen

321
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,520
will contain some form of shorthand.

322
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,560
For instance, here is Hercules getting down on his knees and praying to Zeus.

323
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,560
Almighty Zeus?

324
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:42,480
Now, a good boy in ancient Greece probably would have, you know, brought a goat and slaughtered

325
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,760
it on that altar, you know, rather than getting down on his knees and praying like a Christian.

326
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,200
Do things the proper way.

327
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,120
The audience associates getting on their knees with piety, therefore this is shorthand.

328
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,600
And this has nothing to do with historical accuracy and everything to do with using shorthand

329
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,560
to get information to the audience using cultural knowledge the audience is presumably familiar

330
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,560
with.

331
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,960
Pop culture references became an increasingly popular form of shorthand in animation ever

332
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,360
since Aladdin, and this movie has a lot of that.

333
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:17,480
The audience is familiar with these things, and without the lines being drawn explicitly,

334
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,520
our mid-90s audience is still able to draw the lines between Hercules and celebrity athletes

335
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,240
being wealthy and endorsing products.

336
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:34,920
Hercules isn't just Rocky and Superman, he's also Michael Jordan, from pain-wearing

337
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:46,120
Air Herx to panic-consuming-then-not-McDonalds that Hercules has been celebrity-endorsing.

338
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,840
How does this tie into the film thematically?

339
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,760
After he trains with Phil, Hercules goes to Thebes, which is a thinly-veiled version of

340
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,960
New York that was already dated in 1997.

341
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,720
This is the big city in which Hercules goes to make it.

342
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,800
Then Hades stages a battle with the intent of killing Hercules, but inadvertently makes

343
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,840
him an overnight sensation.

344
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,320
After that, we get a montage with all of these references to sports stardom—signing autographs,

345
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:18,220
fans wearing his jersey, appearance fees, royalties, action figures, sweatshops making

346
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:29,000
your product, endorsing fast foods, Air Jordans, our Herc had cash to burn, yeah, money, whoo!

347
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,680
Hercules doesn't set out like, I'm going to go be a hero and that will net me fame

348
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,360
and fortune, yay.

349
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,660
Fame and fortune just kind of happened to him incidentally, so there was never a point

350
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,680
where he sought out wealth and fortune and then learned the error of his ways.

351
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,160
He never tries to win Meg over with his fame and fortune, it's just kind of there.

352
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,800
And this would have worked if Hercules had a more arrogant starting point, or maybe had

353
00:21:52,800 --> 00:22:04,960
equated fame and fortune with personal worth, like Aladdin did, and Spider-Man did.

354
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,800
This points to why Kuzco is a much more compelling character.

355
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,040
He was genuinely flawed and arrogant, and eventually he learned the error of his ways.

356
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,040
I'm not saying Hercules needed to be like Kuzco, but for wealth and fame to be framed

357
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:21,080
as not the point of being a true hero, he kind of needed to want it.

358
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,440
But he never cared about any of that, this isn't a character flaw.

359
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,040
It doesn't corrupt him at all, it doesn't make him egotistical or make him lose sight

360
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,600
of what it means to be a hero.

361
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,120
In the end, the references end up kind of being hollow.

362
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,560
It's less a comment on celebrity athlete endorsement culture, or homage to Rocky, than

363
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,160
it's just trying to remind the audience something they're already familiar with without

364
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:49,360
actually exploring it.

365
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,720
Chosen One narratives are easy to write, because then you don't need to come up with a good

366
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,940
and compelling reason for why our hero is the center of the conflict.

367
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,800
But they're hard to make interesting, because there's no good and compelling reason for

368
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,140
why our hero is the center of the conflict.

369
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,560
And you notice that most popular heroes' journey stories don't involve a prophecy

370
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,560
proclaiming them to be the Chosen One.

371
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:14,140
Frodo wasn't prophesied, Katniss wasn't prophesied, Luke Skywalker wasn't prophesied,

372
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,480
they were all ordinary people thrust into extraordinary circumstances by chance or plot

373
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,800
stuff or them wanting to do a thing.

374
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,560
The only real Chosen One character in the Star Wars universe is Anakin, and we all remember

375
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,520
how that turned out.

376
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,160
Even Harry Potter ends up being more of a send-up of Chosen One narratives than a Chosen

377
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:38,360
One narrative played straight.

378
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,000
His Chosen One-ness comes into play more in how people treat him than as it pertains to

379
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,680
the actual plot, and most of the conflicts of the individual stories have more to do

380
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,560
with the periphery of the universe as a whole, rather than the fact that Harry is the only

381
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,400
person who can save the world.

382
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,200
Which ultimately turns out not to be true, by the by.

383
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:00,800
The Chosen One narrative was even more pointedly dissected in The Lego Movie, and the whole

384
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,200
point of that ends up being that there is no Chosen One.

385
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,000
Think Chosen One narratives work better in TV shows than in movies?

386
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,680
Contrast this with something like Buffy, who was one in a long line of Chosen Ones and

387
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,920
could die at any moment.

388
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,680
Avatar The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra take a similar approach to their Chosen

389
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,680
Ones.

390
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,440
Their stories are about the day-to-day dealing with it.

391
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,440
Disney movies mostly stayed away from Chosen One prophecies.

392
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,600
The closest we get is probably Aladdin.

393
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,640
Aladdin's Chosen One-ness is what gets him into the cave to get the lamp, but this aspect

394
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,520
is completely done and over with by the end of Act 1 of the film, and the rest of the

395
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,780
film's conflict has nothing to do with it.

396
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,180
The momentum of the film is fully propelled by character motivation, and is rooted in

397
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,180
actual stakes.

398
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:51,980
Simba's arc has an element of destiny to it, but this has more to do with duty than

399
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,980
prophecy.

400
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,980
In Hercules, the only reason Hades has it in for Hercules is because the fates told

401
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,380
him to.

402
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,380
Because prophecy.

403
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,160
And by the end of the film, they have built up to no enmity, because they don't really

404
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:08,660
know each other, and they have no reason to be at odds with each other besides prophecy.

405
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,780
And again, contrast this with the TV show, where they do know each other, and do develop

406
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,780
a dynamic.

407
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,780
Hey, if I could only turn one person to stone, I'm glad it was Jercules.

408
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,780
I hate that kid.

409
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:22,100
The only thing that makes Hercules special, the only reason Hades pays any attention to

410
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,940
him at all, is a prophecy that Hercules has no idea about.

411
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:31,740
Nearly every iota of plot momentum is manufactured by contrivances outside of Hercules' control.

412
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,260
So the result is a story that is not being pushed by actions or character development,

413
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:42,500
but is instead being pulled by its nose by the plot contrivance of destiny.

414
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:49,580
So if you want to learn about screenwriting and screenplay structure, Disney's Hercules

415
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:54,700
is the perfect vehicle for baby's first three act structure, because it is so carefully

416
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,540
and clearly delineated.

417
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:00,620
And if you're wondering why I'm taking the time to go through this, it's because I'm

418
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,620
trying to save you.

419
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,540
I'm trying to save you from the student loans.

420
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,740
Don't go to film school.

421
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,740
Watch internet videos.

422
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,380
Hercules has a very simple, very traditional three act structure.

423
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,980
So we can use this as an opportunity to examine story structure as it pertains to Hollywood

424
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,980
movies.

425
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,980
Backstory.

426
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,060
We learn who Hercules is and how the universe works.

427
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,060
Excuse me?

428
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,140
Should Hercules fight, you will fail.

429
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,140
Inciting incident.

430
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,540
Hades hears the prophecy that Hercules will defeat him.

431
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,100
This leads Hades to turning Hercules into a mortal.

432
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,100
This is it.

433
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,100
Don't you see?

434
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,100
Maybe they have the answers.

435
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,460
Point of attack.

436
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,980
Hercules finds out that he's adopted.

437
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:43,460
Now, some people say that point of attack and inciting incident are the same thing.

438
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,020
And these people are wrong.

439
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,420
The inciting incident sets the plot in motion.

440
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:51,020
The point of attack is the moment the central conflict and character motivation appears

441
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,660
and the primary action of the story can get moving.

442
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,660
The central conflict.

443
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,580
I feel like, like I really don't belong here.

444
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,780
Hercules wants to find out where he belongs.

445
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,860
This culminates at the end of act one.

446
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,020
Hercules presents his central conflict to Zeus.

447
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,020
Zeus tells him how to fix it.

448
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:10,260
If you can prove yourself a true hero on earth, your godhood will be restored.

449
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,500
This is called a lock-in, also known as the end of act one.

450
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,900
Our hero has his quest and now he goes out to quest it.

451
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,620
I won't let you down, father.

452
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:21,420
Go be a true hero, Hercules, and that will solve your central conflict.

453
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,060
Act two is typically split into two segments.

454
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:30,620
In Hercules, these two segments are very clearly defined.

455
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:34,140
A first culmination occurs at the end of the first half of the second act.

456
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,220
In Hercules, it's where he proves himself by defeating Dehydra.

457
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,140
The midpoint is Hercules attaining fame and fortune.

458
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,740
Important to note also that the midpoint doesn't necessarily fall right in the middle of the

459
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,780
movie.

460
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:49,580
The Lion King has an unusually long first act and a really short second act, so its

461
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:53,820
midpoint, which is where he meets up with Nala, happens around 60% through the movie.

462
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:59,100
Gotta blaze, there's a whole cosmos up there waiting for me, with hey, my name on it.

463
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,080
The end of act two also generally sees the resolution of the main tension.

464
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:09,640
In this case, Hades releasing the Titans while building a new tension for act three.

465
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,840
The Titans now having been released, now we have to go defeat them.

466
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,920
This is called the main culmination and usually coincides with the hero being at his lowest

467
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
point.

468
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:26,920
Again, illustrated really, really clearly here.

469
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,000
Twist in the third act, Meg sacrifices herself for Hercules.

470
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,600
Hercules gets his strength back.

471
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,520
The twist in the third act is important because it shifts the focus of the final tension.

472
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,440
The main tension is no longer, will we defeat the Titans, which is part of what makes his

473
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,200
little cul-de-sac where he actually does go and wackily defeat the Titans all the more

474
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,280
problematic for the tone, by the by.

475
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,560
It's will Meg die.

476
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,280
The stakes are much higher.

477
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:58,760
Climax, Hercules sacrifices himself for Meg, becomes a true hero.

478
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:08,160
Now here's the thing, central conflict.

479
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,160
The central conflict in pretty much all of the 90s Disney movies was about self-identity

480
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,840
and finding oneself.

481
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,680
And Hercules is probably the most overt in that regard alongside Tarzan.

482
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,400
Both have the same central conflict.

483
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,600
I am an outsider and I want to find out where I belong.

484
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,080
And same resolution.

485
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,920
This sexy lady is where I belong.

486
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,920
Resolution.

487
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:31,120
You were willing to give your life to rescue this young woman.

488
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,600
So the resolution resolves the conflict between sports star equals self-serving and superhero

489
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,400
equals selfless, but it does not resolve Hercules' central conflict.

490
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:45,560
Which brings us to...

491
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,600
In screenplay terms, motivation is described as want versus need.

492
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,040
In a story, a character needs to grow or change or learn something for a satisfying character

493
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,040
arc.

494
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,120
Not all the time, but in Disney movies, yeah, all the time.

495
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,920
And generally, the want and the need are related but aren't necessarily the same thing.

496
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,520
The character is motivated by a want set up in the first act.

497
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,160
I want to be where the people are.

498
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:12,160
I want adventure in the great wide somewhere.

499
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:19,280
Just to live one day out there.

500
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,720
And their growth is detailed by meeting a need at the end of the third act.

501
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,720
Aladdin, want.

502
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
We'll be rich.

503
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
Live in a palace.

504
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
Need.

505
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,520
I gotta start pretending to be something I'm not.

506
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,520
Simba, want.

507
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,520
I guess you can change the past.

508
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,520
Need.

509
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,520
Yes, the past can't hurt.

510
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:41,560
But the way I see it, you can either run from it or learn from it.

511
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,160
So one fine day, Hercules finds out he's adopted and he goes to find out what's up.

512
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,240
Why do I feel so out of place, mom and dad?

513
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,240
Go find out.

514
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,240
Good.

515
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,240
Go.

516
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,240
Fine.

517
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
Good.

518
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
Perfectly good starting point.

519
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,120
And you need to learn to become a hero so you can be a god again.

520
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,720
And Hercules is like, okay, that makes perfect sense.

521
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,600
I'll go learn to be a true hero.

522
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
So Hercules' want.

523
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
To find where I belong.

524
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:13,400
And his need, which is being selfless is the mark of a true hero.

525
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,360
Well, one doesn't really build to the other.

526
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,360
This culminates when he sacrifices himself for Meg, which would indicate that he needed

527
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,800
to learn that being a hero is self-sacrificing, but that doesn't really have anything to

528
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,720
do with his main motivation, which is to find out where he belongs, or to resolve some character

529
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,720
flaw.

530
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,240
He was always kind of an innocent nice guy.

531
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:39,240
Not the most altruistic, but not exactly selfish either.

532
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,400
Hercules wants basically the same things as Aladdin, but he gets that halfway through

533
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,500
the movie.

534
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,820
He never has to accept himself to be respected by the masses.

535
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,540
So self-sacrifice is noble, sure, but it's not a culminating moment for his character

536
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:58,060
like it was for, say, Kuzco, who was selfish, or Aladdin, who was pretending to be something

537
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,060
he wasn't.

538
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:04,140
Basically, his want, a sense of belonging, and his need, being self-sacrificing, don't

539
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,940
really have anything to do with each other.

540
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:09,220
One does not resolve the other, which makes for a weak character arc.

541
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,340
And you could say, but Hades, but the Hades plot isn't relevant to Hercules' motivation

542
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:17,000
because at no point does Hercules even learn about the prophecy, and he doesn't even

543
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
meet Hades up until the end of the movie, which also makes this showdown kind of limp.

544
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,800
Let her go.

545
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,440
I've been waiting for this moment for ten minutes.

546
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,800
Look again at Aladdin.

547
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:33,920
The thing that he and Jafar are fighting over, namely the genie, is directly related to Aladdin's

548
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,920
character growth.

549
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,800
There is a point where Aladdin decides he won't let the genie go because the genie

550
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,280
helps him maintain his facade.

551
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,800
Without you, I'm just Aladdin.

552
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,000
But his character arc culminates with him letting the genie go.

553
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,080
And Aladdin's growth also relates to the antagonist, Jafar, because letting the genie

554
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,640
go is something Jafar would never do.

555
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,480
At its core, the problem with Hercules' motivation is that, unlike all of the other

556
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,840
Disney characters, it's not an internal motivation.

557
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:03,560
But if I don't become a true hero, I'll never be able to rejoin my father, Zeus.

558
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,980
He doesn't want to be a hero because he wants it.

559
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,880
He wants it because he was told to.

560
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,800
Some of the most memorable characters in the last twenty years, Walter White, Tony Soprano,

561
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,080
Cersei Lannister, Daniel Plainview,

562
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,440
these characters do some fucked up shit and are rarely if ever sympathetic, but the audience

563
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,280
engages with them highly because they are highly motivated.

564
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,240
You're goddamn right.

565
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,360
And you see this more on television because you have a lot more time to really explore

566
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,080
character depth and nuance.

567
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,360
And I use these characters as examples, not because they belong in Disney movies, but

568
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,600
to illustrate that it is more important for a character to be motivated than to be sympathetic

569
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,600
or relatable.

570
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,200
Hercules is certainly the latter, but not the former.

571
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,240
And even though on a personal level I really hate most movies that have some sort of

572
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,520
YOU LIED TO ME engineered conflict, let's ignore that.

573
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,360
Meg's character arc is much stronger than Hercules because her stakes are much higher,

574
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,080
her dilemma more intense, and her motivations clearer.

575
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,720
Even though history has taught her that she can't trust men or her own feelings, which

576
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,600
her bitchy gay boyfriend Hades details explicitly.

577
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
This one is different.

578
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,080
He's honest and he's sweet.

579
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,080
Please.

580
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,080
He would never do anything to hurt me.

581
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,080
He's a guy.

582
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,400
You deserve a better movie, Meg.

583
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,400
In fact, everyone in this movie deserves a better movie.

584
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,720
Meg deserves a better movie.

585
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,560
Hercules deserves a better movie.

586
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,360
Hades deserves a better movie.

587
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,080
Phil, actually no, not Phil, f**k Phil.

588
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,240
I'm real too.

589
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,560
Dang it!

590
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,920
When I say I'm fond of this movie, that is what I mean.

591
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:31,880
I'm fond of the characters, I'm fond of the style, I'm fond of the idea, of the tone,

592
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,960
you know, when it's being fun and actually enjoyable.

593
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,400
The bones of the thing I am not fond of, and that is one of the most important parts

594
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,400
of any movie.

595
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,680
To make it clear, I do not mean to say that there was nothing risky or new or innovative

596
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,680
in this movie.

597
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,680
Far from it.

598
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,880
It has the first Disney heroine who starts out in league with the bad guy, and who's

599
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:56,360
not only got a past with men, but she's gotta be pushing 30 given how world-weary she is.

600
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,800
Well, you know how men are.

601
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,440
They think no means yes and get lost means take me, I'm yours.

602
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,800
Don't worry, Shorty here can explain it to you later.

603
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,580
Like I said, f**k Phil.

604
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:10,180
The risk of going with a straight comedic villain is one of the best things in the movie,

605
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,860
despite the tonal problems.

606
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:17,580
This is also the first Disney movie since, uh, Fantasia, uh, yeah, to have named black

607
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,580
characters.

608
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,580
Yep, 1997.

609
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,820
That's how long it took.

610
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,820
This is one of the most stylized of the Disney canon, thanks in large part to the filmmakers

611
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,460
hiring Gerald Scarfe as the concept artist.

612
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,940
He was a New Yorker cartoonist, but at the time, he was most famous for doing the art

613
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,740
for Pink Floyd's The Wall.

614
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,100
And the style Scarfe came up with for the movie was pretty out there, but you can totally

615
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,420
see its influence in the finished product.

616
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,620
And here is the sad irony of Hercules.

617
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:46,260
Like Hercules learning to be a hero as a means to a different, unrelated end, Musker and

618
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:50,260
Clements made Hercules as a means to a different, unrelated project.

619
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,540
They had to do this thing in order to earn the thing they actually cared about.

620
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:58,460
Katzenberg left Disney in 1994 under not very friendly circumstances, but the studio made

621
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,540
good on Katzenberg's promise.

622
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,140
And Treasure Planet exists.

623
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:06,660
I found it pretty unmemorable, and to this day is the biggest flop Musker and Clements

624
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,100
were involved in.

625
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,460
And I take no schadenfreude in that.

626
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,940
Let me be clear, I actually really respect these guys and what they've done for animation,

627
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,940
but it didn't ruin them.

628
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,940
They're fine.

629
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,940
They're doing fine.

630
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,460
Everything good and memorable about Hercules stems from the filmmakers taking risk.

631
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,980
And that is the essence of really great films.

632
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,980
It is a combination of risk and of cliché, of new and of safe.

633
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:35,220
The art is in how you weave the two together.

634
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,220
So now that's it.

635
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,460
We can finally put it to rest.

636
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:44,180
The long-standing mystery of what exactly made Hercules kind of meh in the eyes of the

637
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,420
public and Disney.

638
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:52,060
And to those of you who look down on me and people like me who just tried for so long

639
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:59,340
to do this Hercules dissection thing, to you I say, there are dozens of us.

640
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,020
Dozens!
