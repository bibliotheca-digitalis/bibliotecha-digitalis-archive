00:00.000 --> 00:04.300
Central to one of the most basic discussions in film studies is that of genre.

00:04.300 --> 00:06.400
Individual movies don't exist in a bubble,

00:06.400 --> 00:09.100
they all have one or more assigned genres,

00:09.100 --> 00:13.400
because humans like to organize and label all the little minutiae of existence.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.400
So what is genre?

00:15.400 --> 00:18.400
What genre does Transformers even fall into?

00:18.400 --> 00:21.400
And how has Transformers...

00:21.400 --> 00:25.400
transformed genre?

00:25.400 --> 00:27.200
I planned that.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.200
I don't play.

00:29.200 --> 00:31.200
I don't play.

00:31.200 --> 00:34.200
I don't play.

00:34.200 --> 00:38.700
So genre is both incredibly fluid and surprisingly rigid.

00:38.700 --> 00:42.200
Genres are being created, changed, and redefined all the time.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.200
A film might be produced and marketed as one genre,

00:45.200 --> 00:48.200
but then might be retrofitted by history as falling into another.

00:48.200 --> 00:50.700
An interesting example might be Frankenstein,

00:50.700 --> 00:53.200
which is widely considered to be the first science fiction novel,

00:53.200 --> 00:55.700
but when the novel came out, we didn't have a term for it.

00:55.700 --> 00:59.200
The term genre is also separate from the term genre film,

00:59.200 --> 01:02.200
which most would consider the Transformers franchise to fall into.

01:02.200 --> 01:06.200
The term genre film usually refers to speculative fiction,

01:06.200 --> 01:08.700
outside of traditional rooted adult dramas,

01:08.700 --> 01:12.700
and more in the vein of science fiction, fantasy, action, and adventure.

01:12.700 --> 01:17.200
Genre films are also kind of a subtle term for films that don't deserve awards.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.200
Hollywood.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.700
Genre, as a blueprint for audience expectation,

01:20.700 --> 01:23.200
can be considered a part of film language.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.200
According to film historian Bill Nichols,

01:25.200 --> 01:28.700
the rules and conventions of genre constitute a type of language, or code,

01:28.700 --> 01:34.200
by which filmmakers construct film whilst at the same time also operating as a language, or code,

01:34.200 --> 01:36.200
by which the audience reads film.

01:36.200 --> 01:39.200
In that sense, genre is the most basic element of film language,

01:39.200 --> 01:44.200
but these elements are more for marketing, for the filmmakers, and for the consumer,

01:44.200 --> 01:46.200
rather than being a part of text and framing.

01:46.200 --> 01:51.700
Elements for the genre of romantic comedy include fun, lighthearted tone,

01:51.700 --> 01:55.700
a focus on the formation of the couple, and a happy ending.

01:55.700 --> 01:59.700
Elements for the genre of horror include a perversion of domestic stability,

01:59.700 --> 02:02.700
gruesome elements inserted into some form of status quo,

02:02.700 --> 02:05.700
and psychological manipulation.

02:05.700 --> 02:10.200
Elements for the action genre include a fast pace and intense spectacle.

02:10.200 --> 02:13.700
Elements for the science fiction genre include the use of speculative elements

02:13.700 --> 02:18.700
to explore questions about technology, sociology, the future, and the nature of humanity.

02:19.700 --> 02:31.700
There are... debates as to whether or not Transformers can be considered science fiction.

02:34.700 --> 02:38.700
I did an informal poll on Twitter, and I got a pretty wild variation of what genre

02:38.700 --> 02:40.700
the Transformers movies even fell under.

02:40.700 --> 02:44.700
So how do we contextualize the genre of these films, or indeed, any film,

02:44.700 --> 02:48.700
and why do films even need to be contextualized in terms of genre

02:48.700 --> 02:50.700
outside of the demands of marketing?

02:50.700 --> 02:53.700
According to the most recent edition of AS Film Studies,

02:53.700 --> 02:56.700
we might recognize that each genre has its own iconography.

02:56.700 --> 03:00.700
That is to say, characteristic props, costumes, settings, and character types

03:00.700 --> 03:03.700
that act as visual signifiers alerting us to the appropriate category

03:03.700 --> 03:06.700
within which we can expect to pigeonhole any particular film.

03:06.700 --> 03:11.700
So perhaps the most obvious answer to where does Transformers belong is science fiction.

03:11.700 --> 03:14.700
There's a divide between so-called hard science fiction,

03:14.700 --> 03:17.700
that is science fiction based on technologies that are theoretically possible,

03:17.700 --> 03:22.700
and soft science fiction, anything that involves technologies that are theoretically impossible

03:22.700 --> 03:24.700
or where the technology isn't really explained.

03:24.700 --> 03:27.700
Given that Transformers isn't terribly concerned with realism,

03:27.700 --> 03:30.700
I think it's safe to say that it is not hard science fiction,

03:30.700 --> 03:34.700
perhaps soft science fiction, or even science fantasy.

03:34.700 --> 03:37.700
Or perhaps Transformers is just straight fantasy.

03:37.700 --> 03:40.700
In publishing, science fiction and fantasy tend to be lumped together,

03:40.700 --> 03:44.700
which kind of bugs me because they are generally quite different genres.

03:44.700 --> 03:46.700
Fantasy is more seeking to mythologize.

03:46.700 --> 03:49.700
Science fiction tends to look forward and explore anxieties and fears

03:49.700 --> 03:52.700
relating to our shared future and to technology.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.700
The Transformers movies fall much more on the mythologizing side of the spectrum

03:55.700 --> 03:57.700
than the forward-looking side.

03:57.700 --> 04:00.700
Hell, the fifth movie has King Arthur as a major plot point,

04:00.700 --> 04:03.700
so wouldn't that make them more fantastical?

04:03.700 --> 04:07.700
The films are much more concerned with ideas like destiny and honor, such as it were,

04:07.700 --> 04:11.700
and way less in how speculative elements affect our future and our shared humanity,

04:11.700 --> 04:15.700
similar to what you would see in a film like Arrival or Blade Runner.

04:15.700 --> 04:18.700
You could make the case for Transformers as science fantasy more in the vein of Star Wars,

04:18.700 --> 04:20.700
but that feels incomplete, too.

04:20.700 --> 04:24.700
Let's look at something like Universal's The Mummy, which is on its third major iteration.

04:24.700 --> 04:28.700
The first version of The Mummy, which starred Boris Karloff and was released in 1932,

04:28.700 --> 04:30.700
would now be classified as horror.

04:32.700 --> 04:36.700
But the 1999 remake, released in a wildly different time for a different market,

04:36.700 --> 04:40.700
retained little of the horror element and was more of a fantasy action comedy.

04:43.700 --> 04:47.700
And the new version would fall into the genre of...

04:47.700 --> 04:50.700
God, I honestly have no idea what they were going for,

04:50.700 --> 04:53.700
but I think the intent was more to lump it in with Transformers,

04:53.700 --> 04:59.700
into this nascent genre of big-budget nostalgia-based action fantasy camp.

04:59.700 --> 05:03.700
The b-b-nag-b-genre.

05:03.700 --> 05:05.700
I mean, you have a better name?

05:05.700 --> 05:07.700
You could also make the case that directors are a genre,

05:07.700 --> 05:10.700
because with certain directors come certain expectations.

05:10.700 --> 05:12.700
Michael Bay is almost a genre unto himself.

05:19.700 --> 05:23.700
And that helps people contextualize, or even excuse, the badness of his films.

05:23.700 --> 05:27.700
And I cannot tell you how many times I've heard that defense of Michael Bay,

05:27.700 --> 05:29.700
like, it's Michael Bay, it's not supposed to be good.

05:29.700 --> 05:32.700
It's like, would you say that about food?

05:33.700 --> 05:35.700
Like, some food's just not supposed to taste good, okay?

05:35.700 --> 05:36.700
Just eat it!

05:36.700 --> 05:41.700
Let's look at an example of director-as-genre working against a movie's favor.

05:41.700 --> 05:44.700
With Steven Spielberg's A.I., many people came away from the film

05:44.700 --> 05:46.700
feeling the ending to be almost saccharine.

05:46.700 --> 05:48.700
Typical Spielbergian.

05:48.700 --> 05:51.700
But would people look at it that way if they saw it as a Kubrick film?

05:51.700 --> 05:53.700
Which, really, it was.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.700
If you look at A.I. through the lens of Kubrick as auteur,

05:55.700 --> 05:59.700
the ending no longer seems so saccharine, the outlook no longer so optimistic.

05:59.700 --> 06:02.700
That shift in expectation and subversion of expectation alone

06:02.700 --> 06:04.700
completely shifts how the viewer frames the movie.

06:04.700 --> 06:09.700
All the problems seem to have disappeared from his mommy's mind.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.700
So without changing a single frame of the film,

06:11.700 --> 06:13.700
just looking at the film in the context of the Kubrick canon

06:13.700 --> 06:17.700
rather than the Spielberg canon changes how the audience perceives the movie.

06:17.700 --> 06:19.700
Movies with Mikey did a great in-depth look at this movie,

06:19.700 --> 06:21.700
and you should check it out for more on this dynamic.

06:21.700 --> 06:24.700
So genre is a part of film language because it helps the audience

06:24.700 --> 06:26.700
contextualize what they are seeing.

06:26.700 --> 06:28.700
A part of that context is expectation,

06:28.700 --> 06:31.700
but important also is the subversion of expectation.

06:31.700 --> 06:34.700
Genre films have to build on the language of previous genre films.

06:34.700 --> 06:38.700
Expand on its subverted audience expectations, but not too much.

06:38.700 --> 06:42.700
Without that subversion of genre, audiences will stop showing up

06:42.700 --> 06:45.700
because they've seen this all before, and it's starting to feel stale.

06:45.700 --> 06:48.700
This was basically what happened to Disney movies after the 90s renaissance.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.700
The films got too repetitive.

06:50.700 --> 06:52.700
But then when Disney tried to break from its mold and expand,

06:52.700 --> 06:55.700
it got alienating to their core audience.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.700
Genres also have a life cycle.

06:57.700 --> 07:01.700
In a recent episode of The Nerdwriter titled Logan, Superhero Movies Get Old,

07:01.700 --> 07:04.700
Nerdwriter cites an essay written by John G. Coelte,

07:04.700 --> 07:08.700
which uses Chinatown as its example of generic transformation in American film.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.700
You should also take the time to check that out if you haven't.

07:10.700 --> 07:14.700
But the basic takeaway here is that genre conventions eventually become so embedded

07:14.700 --> 07:16.700
that genres must change.

07:16.700 --> 07:19.700
Audiences either demand a greater complexity from the genre,

07:19.700 --> 07:21.700
or the genre fades away.

07:21.700 --> 07:22.700
Take Westerns, for example.

07:23.700 --> 07:26.700
The Western genre as it once was is dead.

07:26.700 --> 07:28.700
Sure, you get the occasional send-up or homage,

07:28.700 --> 07:32.700
but they do not fall into the genre of Western as it was once known.

07:32.700 --> 07:35.700
And Westerns as the genre was once known won't ever come back

07:35.700 --> 07:37.700
because America's relationship with its own identity,

07:37.700 --> 07:42.700
which at one point created an environment for Westerns to flourish, has changed.

07:42.700 --> 07:45.700
In the heyday of the Western, a generally whitewashed version of Manifest Destiny

07:45.700 --> 07:48.700
was what was known and accepted by most consumers.

07:48.700 --> 07:51.700
The genre as a whole romanticized the exploitation, degradation,

07:51.700 --> 07:53.700
and genocide of indigenous Americans.

07:53.700 --> 07:56.700
And you can cry foul at the PC police trying to brainwash

07:56.700 --> 07:58.700
your crymate river with your liberal tears

07:58.700 --> 08:00.700
to no flake I don't care about the plight of the Native Americans.

08:00.700 --> 08:03.700
They had to die so we could put, you know, like Cedar Point,

08:03.700 --> 08:06.700
and Applebee's, and a Buffalo Wild Wings,

08:06.700 --> 08:08.700
and a Cheesecake Factory on their ancestral homeland,

08:08.700 --> 08:11.700
and I'm gonna watch all the Westerns I want.

08:11.700 --> 08:14.700
But most audiences are not so eager to consume

08:14.700 --> 08:17.700
that particular interpretation of the Old West anymore.

08:17.700 --> 08:20.700
Audiences started to realize that there was something off

08:20.700 --> 08:22.700
about this romantic portrayal of the American West,

08:22.700 --> 08:24.700
just like they realize there's something off with

08:24.700 --> 08:27.700
Gone With the Wind's romantic portrayal of the American South

08:27.700 --> 08:29.700
after the Civil Rights Movement.

08:29.700 --> 08:32.700
Manifest Destiny and all of its evils are baked into the genre,

08:32.700 --> 08:35.700
and the genre lost its popularity when American expansionism

08:35.700 --> 08:37.700
lost its romance for audiences.

08:37.700 --> 08:39.700
Obviously, hashtag not all audiences,

08:39.700 --> 08:42.700
but enough to mean it was no longer financially lucrative.

08:42.700 --> 08:45.700
And that's part of what made Blazing Saddles so brilliant in its time.

08:45.700 --> 08:49.700
Yes, this is Blazing Saddles praise number 452,263 on this channel.

08:49.700 --> 08:50.700
Don't at me.

08:50.700 --> 08:54.700
Blazing Saddles not only touches on America's history of racial exploitation,

08:54.700 --> 08:56.700
that's what the movie is about.

08:56.700 --> 08:58.700
Well, boys, the break's over.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.700
Through what Coelty describes as burlesque,

09:00.700 --> 09:03.700
Blazing Saddles lovingly destroyed the magic surrounding the genre.

09:09.700 --> 09:12.700
Mel Brooks said that his Western parody came from a place of love,

09:12.700 --> 09:13.700
and that might be true,

09:13.700 --> 09:16.700
but Blazing Saddles definitely helped kill the Western.

09:22.700 --> 09:25.700
And obviously it wasn't only the loss of the romance of the Western that killed it.

09:25.700 --> 09:28.700
The genre began to be associated with old squares,

09:28.700 --> 09:32.700
newer science fiction actioners and police procedurals replaced it in popularity,

09:32.700 --> 09:36.700
a more global film market means the subject is less appealing to non-Americans.

09:36.700 --> 09:39.700
All of these things contribute to the birth and death of genres.

09:39.700 --> 09:42.700
That's why you don't really think of more recent films like

09:42.700 --> 09:47.700
There Will Be Blood and True Grit, itself a remake of a Western, as Westerns.

09:47.700 --> 09:48.700
They're more in the vein of historical fiction,

09:48.700 --> 09:51.700
and don't romanticize a bold, brave frontier history

09:51.700 --> 09:54.700
in the manner typically associated with the Western genre.

09:54.700 --> 09:58.700
So, Nerdwriter contends that Logan could be considered the product of exhaustion

09:58.700 --> 10:01.700
with superhero movies, and I think that's true.

10:01.700 --> 10:04.700
But this genre that we're starting to feel so exhausted by,

10:04.700 --> 10:08.700
I think it's bigger than superhero movies, and I think it's changing.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.700
The creation of shared cinematic universes

10:10.700 --> 10:12.700
is creating something of a saturation point.

10:12.700 --> 10:16.700
Superhero movies are moving away from herodom and more towards mythologizing.

10:16.700 --> 10:20.700
So this new Mummy remake, everything Marvel and DC is putting out,

10:20.700 --> 10:24.700
even Transformers, these movies all have much more in common with each other

10:24.700 --> 10:29.700
than with classic horror superheroes or the science fiction that may have inspired them.

10:29.700 --> 10:32.700
All of these are examples of generic transformation.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.700
Heh, get it, because it's Transformers.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.700
Or recontextualization.

10:36.700 --> 10:38.700
They may be inspired by niche genres,

10:38.700 --> 10:41.700
but I think what we're seeing instead is something new,

10:41.700 --> 10:45.700
something that history will contextualize as separate from the genres that inspired them.

10:45.700 --> 10:49.700
This new genre that's drawing elements from other, more niche genres

10:49.700 --> 10:53.700
to create this sort of mainstream hydra.

10:53.700 --> 10:56.700
And that's the thing about contextualization.

10:56.700 --> 10:58.700
Ultimately, that's history's job.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.700
So, film historians of the future will doubtless give a name

11:01.700 --> 11:05.700
to this current era we are living in of bibimbafak.

11:05.700 --> 11:09.700
Or, you know, like, film historian aliens that are trying to, like, piece together

11:09.700 --> 11:12.700
and figure out what our deal was as a civilization.

11:12.700 --> 11:17.700
And yes, I'm pretty sure that the aliens trying to cobble together the remnants of our civilization

11:17.700 --> 11:22.700
are gonna have, like, huge nerds that care very much what genre the Transformers films fell into.

11:22.700 --> 11:27.700
I am more sure that aliens have nerds than we will survive as a civilization.

11:27.700 --> 11:32.700
But as for what genre history will assign this period of film we are currently living through,

11:32.700 --> 11:34.700
only history will tell.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.700
Or alien nerds.
