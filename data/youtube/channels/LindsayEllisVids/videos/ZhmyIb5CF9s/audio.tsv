0	4300	Central to one of the most basic discussions in film studies is that of genre.
4300	6400	Individual movies don't exist in a bubble,
6400	9100	they all have one or more assigned genres,
9100	13400	because humans like to organize and label all the little minutiae of existence.
13400	15400	So what is genre?
15400	18400	What genre does Transformers even fall into?
18400	21400	And how has Transformers...
21400	25400	transformed genre?
25400	27200	I planned that.
27200	29200	I don't play.
29200	31200	I don't play.
31200	34200	I don't play.
34200	38700	So genre is both incredibly fluid and surprisingly rigid.
38700	42200	Genres are being created, changed, and redefined all the time.
42200	45200	A film might be produced and marketed as one genre,
45200	48200	but then might be retrofitted by history as falling into another.
48200	50700	An interesting example might be Frankenstein,
50700	53200	which is widely considered to be the first science fiction novel,
53200	55700	but when the novel came out, we didn't have a term for it.
55700	59200	The term genre is also separate from the term genre film,
59200	62200	which most would consider the Transformers franchise to fall into.
62200	66200	The term genre film usually refers to speculative fiction,
66200	68700	outside of traditional rooted adult dramas,
68700	72700	and more in the vein of science fiction, fantasy, action, and adventure.
72700	77200	Genre films are also kind of a subtle term for films that don't deserve awards.
77200	78200	Hollywood.
78200	80700	Genre, as a blueprint for audience expectation,
80700	83200	can be considered a part of film language.
83200	85200	According to film historian Bill Nichols,
85200	88700	the rules and conventions of genre constitute a type of language, or code,
88700	94200	by which filmmakers construct film whilst at the same time also operating as a language, or code,
94200	96200	by which the audience reads film.
96200	99200	In that sense, genre is the most basic element of film language,
99200	104200	but these elements are more for marketing, for the filmmakers, and for the consumer,
104200	106200	rather than being a part of text and framing.
106200	111700	Elements for the genre of romantic comedy include fun, lighthearted tone,
111700	115700	a focus on the formation of the couple, and a happy ending.
115700	119700	Elements for the genre of horror include a perversion of domestic stability,
119700	122700	gruesome elements inserted into some form of status quo,
122700	125700	and psychological manipulation.
125700	130200	Elements for the action genre include a fast pace and intense spectacle.
130200	133700	Elements for the science fiction genre include the use of speculative elements
133700	138700	to explore questions about technology, sociology, the future, and the nature of humanity.
139700	151700	There are... debates as to whether or not Transformers can be considered science fiction.
154700	158700	I did an informal poll on Twitter, and I got a pretty wild variation of what genre
158700	160700	the Transformers movies even fell under.
160700	164700	So how do we contextualize the genre of these films, or indeed, any film,
164700	168700	and why do films even need to be contextualized in terms of genre
168700	170700	outside of the demands of marketing?
170700	173700	According to the most recent edition of AS Film Studies,
173700	176700	we might recognize that each genre has its own iconography.
176700	180700	That is to say, characteristic props, costumes, settings, and character types
180700	183700	that act as visual signifiers alerting us to the appropriate category
183700	186700	within which we can expect to pigeonhole any particular film.
186700	191700	So perhaps the most obvious answer to where does Transformers belong is science fiction.
191700	194700	There's a divide between so-called hard science fiction,
194700	197700	that is science fiction based on technologies that are theoretically possible,
197700	202700	and soft science fiction, anything that involves technologies that are theoretically impossible
202700	204700	or where the technology isn't really explained.
204700	207700	Given that Transformers isn't terribly concerned with realism,
207700	210700	I think it's safe to say that it is not hard science fiction,
210700	214700	perhaps soft science fiction, or even science fantasy.
214700	217700	Or perhaps Transformers is just straight fantasy.
217700	220700	In publishing, science fiction and fantasy tend to be lumped together,
220700	224700	which kind of bugs me because they are generally quite different genres.
224700	226700	Fantasy is more seeking to mythologize.
226700	229700	Science fiction tends to look forward and explore anxieties and fears
229700	232700	relating to our shared future and to technology.
232700	235700	The Transformers movies fall much more on the mythologizing side of the spectrum
235700	237700	than the forward-looking side.
237700	240700	Hell, the fifth movie has King Arthur as a major plot point,
240700	243700	so wouldn't that make them more fantastical?
243700	247700	The films are much more concerned with ideas like destiny and honor, such as it were,
247700	251700	and way less in how speculative elements affect our future and our shared humanity,
251700	255700	similar to what you would see in a film like Arrival or Blade Runner.
255700	258700	You could make the case for Transformers as science fantasy more in the vein of Star Wars,
258700	260700	but that feels incomplete, too.
260700	264700	Let's look at something like Universal's The Mummy, which is on its third major iteration.
264700	268700	The first version of The Mummy, which starred Boris Karloff and was released in 1932,
268700	270700	would now be classified as horror.
272700	276700	But the 1999 remake, released in a wildly different time for a different market,
276700	280700	retained little of the horror element and was more of a fantasy action comedy.
283700	287700	And the new version would fall into the genre of...
287700	290700	God, I honestly have no idea what they were going for,
290700	293700	but I think the intent was more to lump it in with Transformers,
293700	299700	into this nascent genre of big-budget nostalgia-based action fantasy camp.
299700	303700	The b-b-nag-b-genre.
303700	305700	I mean, you have a better name?
305700	307700	You could also make the case that directors are a genre,
307700	310700	because with certain directors come certain expectations.
310700	312700	Michael Bay is almost a genre unto himself.
319700	323700	And that helps people contextualize, or even excuse, the badness of his films.
323700	327700	And I cannot tell you how many times I've heard that defense of Michael Bay,
327700	329700	like, it's Michael Bay, it's not supposed to be good.
329700	332700	It's like, would you say that about food?
333700	335700	Like, some food's just not supposed to taste good, okay?
335700	336700	Just eat it!
336700	341700	Let's look at an example of director-as-genre working against a movie's favor.
341700	344700	With Steven Spielberg's A.I., many people came away from the film
344700	346700	feeling the ending to be almost saccharine.
346700	348700	Typical Spielbergian.
348700	351700	But would people look at it that way if they saw it as a Kubrick film?
351700	353700	Which, really, it was.
353700	355700	If you look at A.I. through the lens of Kubrick as auteur,
355700	359700	the ending no longer seems so saccharine, the outlook no longer so optimistic.
359700	362700	That shift in expectation and subversion of expectation alone
362700	364700	completely shifts how the viewer frames the movie.
364700	369700	All the problems seem to have disappeared from his mommy's mind.
369700	371700	So without changing a single frame of the film,
371700	373700	just looking at the film in the context of the Kubrick canon
373700	377700	rather than the Spielberg canon changes how the audience perceives the movie.
377700	379700	Movies with Mikey did a great in-depth look at this movie,
379700	381700	and you should check it out for more on this dynamic.
381700	384700	So genre is a part of film language because it helps the audience
384700	386700	contextualize what they are seeing.
386700	388700	A part of that context is expectation,
388700	391700	but important also is the subversion of expectation.
391700	394700	Genre films have to build on the language of previous genre films.
394700	398700	Expand on its subverted audience expectations, but not too much.
398700	402700	Without that subversion of genre, audiences will stop showing up
402700	405700	because they've seen this all before, and it's starting to feel stale.
405700	408700	This was basically what happened to Disney movies after the 90s renaissance.
408700	410700	The films got too repetitive.
410700	412700	But then when Disney tried to break from its mold and expand,
412700	415700	it got alienating to their core audience.
415700	417700	Genres also have a life cycle.
417700	421700	In a recent episode of The Nerdwriter titled Logan, Superhero Movies Get Old,
421700	424700	Nerdwriter cites an essay written by John G. Coelte,
424700	428700	which uses Chinatown as its example of generic transformation in American film.
428700	430700	You should also take the time to check that out if you haven't.
430700	434700	But the basic takeaway here is that genre conventions eventually become so embedded
434700	436700	that genres must change.
436700	439700	Audiences either demand a greater complexity from the genre,
439700	441700	or the genre fades away.
441700	442700	Take Westerns, for example.
443700	446700	The Western genre as it once was is dead.
446700	448700	Sure, you get the occasional send-up or homage,
448700	452700	but they do not fall into the genre of Western as it was once known.
452700	455700	And Westerns as the genre was once known won't ever come back
455700	457700	because America's relationship with its own identity,
457700	462700	which at one point created an environment for Westerns to flourish, has changed.
462700	465700	In the heyday of the Western, a generally whitewashed version of Manifest Destiny
465700	468700	was what was known and accepted by most consumers.
468700	471700	The genre as a whole romanticized the exploitation, degradation,
471700	473700	and genocide of indigenous Americans.
473700	476700	And you can cry foul at the PC police trying to brainwash
476700	478700	your crymate river with your liberal tears
478700	480700	to no flake I don't care about the plight of the Native Americans.
480700	483700	They had to die so we could put, you know, like Cedar Point,
483700	486700	and Applebee's, and a Buffalo Wild Wings,
486700	488700	and a Cheesecake Factory on their ancestral homeland,
488700	491700	and I'm gonna watch all the Westerns I want.
491700	494700	But most audiences are not so eager to consume
494700	497700	that particular interpretation of the Old West anymore.
497700	500700	Audiences started to realize that there was something off
500700	502700	about this romantic portrayal of the American West,
502700	504700	just like they realize there's something off with
504700	507700	Gone With the Wind's romantic portrayal of the American South
507700	509700	after the Civil Rights Movement.
509700	512700	Manifest Destiny and all of its evils are baked into the genre,
512700	515700	and the genre lost its popularity when American expansionism
515700	517700	lost its romance for audiences.
517700	519700	Obviously, hashtag not all audiences,
519700	522700	but enough to mean it was no longer financially lucrative.
522700	525700	And that's part of what made Blazing Saddles so brilliant in its time.
525700	529700	Yes, this is Blazing Saddles praise number 452,263 on this channel.
529700	530700	Don't at me.
530700	534700	Blazing Saddles not only touches on America's history of racial exploitation,
534700	536700	that's what the movie is about.
536700	538700	Well, boys, the break's over.
538700	540700	Through what Coelty describes as burlesque,
540700	543700	Blazing Saddles lovingly destroyed the magic surrounding the genre.
549700	552700	Mel Brooks said that his Western parody came from a place of love,
552700	553700	and that might be true,
553700	556700	but Blazing Saddles definitely helped kill the Western.
562700	565700	And obviously it wasn't only the loss of the romance of the Western that killed it.
565700	568700	The genre began to be associated with old squares,
568700	572700	newer science fiction actioners and police procedurals replaced it in popularity,
572700	576700	a more global film market means the subject is less appealing to non-Americans.
576700	579700	All of these things contribute to the birth and death of genres.
579700	582700	That's why you don't really think of more recent films like
582700	587700	There Will Be Blood and True Grit, itself a remake of a Western, as Westerns.
587700	588700	They're more in the vein of historical fiction,
588700	591700	and don't romanticize a bold, brave frontier history
591700	594700	in the manner typically associated with the Western genre.
594700	598700	So, Nerdwriter contends that Logan could be considered the product of exhaustion
598700	601700	with superhero movies, and I think that's true.
601700	604700	But this genre that we're starting to feel so exhausted by,
604700	608700	I think it's bigger than superhero movies, and I think it's changing.
608700	610700	The creation of shared cinematic universes
610700	612700	is creating something of a saturation point.
612700	616700	Superhero movies are moving away from herodom and more towards mythologizing.
616700	620700	So this new Mummy remake, everything Marvel and DC is putting out,
620700	624700	even Transformers, these movies all have much more in common with each other
624700	629700	than with classic horror superheroes or the science fiction that may have inspired them.
629700	632700	All of these are examples of generic transformation.
632700	634700	Heh, get it, because it's Transformers.
634700	636700	Or recontextualization.
636700	638700	They may be inspired by niche genres,
638700	641700	but I think what we're seeing instead is something new,
641700	645700	something that history will contextualize as separate from the genres that inspired them.
645700	649700	This new genre that's drawing elements from other, more niche genres
649700	653700	to create this sort of mainstream hydra.
653700	656700	And that's the thing about contextualization.
656700	658700	Ultimately, that's history's job.
658700	661700	So, film historians of the future will doubtless give a name
661700	665700	to this current era we are living in of bibimbafak.
665700	669700	Or, you know, like, film historian aliens that are trying to, like, piece together
669700	672700	and figure out what our deal was as a civilization.
672700	677700	And yes, I'm pretty sure that the aliens trying to cobble together the remnants of our civilization
677700	682700	are gonna have, like, huge nerds that care very much what genre the Transformers films fell into.
682700	687700	I am more sure that aliens have nerds than we will survive as a civilization.
687700	692700	But as for what genre history will assign this period of film we are currently living through,
692700	694700	only history will tell.
695700	697700	Or alien nerds.
