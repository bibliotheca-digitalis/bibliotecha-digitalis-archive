1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
Central to one of the most basic discussions in film studies is that of genre.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,400
Individual movies don't exist in a bubble,

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,100
they all have one or more assigned genres,

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,400
because humans like to organize and label all the little minutiae of existence.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,400
So what is genre?

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,400
What genre does Transformers even fall into?

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,400
And how has Transformers...

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,400
transformed genre?

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,200
I planned that.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,200
I don't play.

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,200
I don't play.

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,200
I don't play.

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,700
So genre is both incredibly fluid and surprisingly rigid.

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,200
Genres are being created, changed, and redefined all the time.

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,200
A film might be produced and marketed as one genre,

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,200
but then might be retrofitted by history as falling into another.

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,700
An interesting example might be Frankenstein,

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,200
which is widely considered to be the first science fiction novel,

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,700
but when the novel came out, we didn't have a term for it.

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,200
The term genre is also separate from the term genre film,

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,200
which most would consider the Transformers franchise to fall into.

22
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,200
The term genre film usually refers to speculative fiction,

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,700
outside of traditional rooted adult dramas,

24
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,700
and more in the vein of science fiction, fantasy, action, and adventure.

25
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,200
Genre films are also kind of a subtle term for films that don't deserve awards.

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Hollywood.

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,700
Genre, as a blueprint for audience expectation,

28
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,200
can be considered a part of film language.

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
According to film historian Bill Nichols,

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,700
the rules and conventions of genre constitute a type of language, or code,

31
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:34,200
by which filmmakers construct film whilst at the same time also operating as a language, or code,

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,200
by which the audience reads film.

33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,200
In that sense, genre is the most basic element of film language,

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,200
but these elements are more for marketing, for the filmmakers, and for the consumer,

35
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,200
rather than being a part of text and framing.

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,700
Elements for the genre of romantic comedy include fun, lighthearted tone,

37
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,700
a focus on the formation of the couple, and a happy ending.

38
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,700
Elements for the genre of horror include a perversion of domestic stability,

39
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,700
gruesome elements inserted into some form of status quo,

40
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,700
and psychological manipulation.

41
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,200
Elements for the action genre include a fast pace and intense spectacle.

42
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,700
Elements for the science fiction genre include the use of speculative elements

43
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,700
to explore questions about technology, sociology, the future, and the nature of humanity.

44
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:31,700
There are... debates as to whether or not Transformers can be considered science fiction.

45
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,700
I did an informal poll on Twitter, and I got a pretty wild variation of what genre

46
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,700
the Transformers movies even fell under.

47
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,700
So how do we contextualize the genre of these films, or indeed, any film,

48
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,700
and why do films even need to be contextualized in terms of genre

49
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,700
outside of the demands of marketing?

50
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,700
According to the most recent edition of AS Film Studies,

51
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,700
we might recognize that each genre has its own iconography.

52
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,700
That is to say, characteristic props, costumes, settings, and character types

53
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,700
that act as visual signifiers alerting us to the appropriate category

54
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,700
within which we can expect to pigeonhole any particular film.

55
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,700
So perhaps the most obvious answer to where does Transformers belong is science fiction.

56
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,700
There's a divide between so-called hard science fiction,

57
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,700
that is science fiction based on technologies that are theoretically possible,

58
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,700
and soft science fiction, anything that involves technologies that are theoretically impossible

59
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,700
or where the technology isn't really explained.

60
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,700
Given that Transformers isn't terribly concerned with realism,

61
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,700
I think it's safe to say that it is not hard science fiction,

62
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,700
perhaps soft science fiction, or even science fantasy.

63
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,700
Or perhaps Transformers is just straight fantasy.

64
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,700
In publishing, science fiction and fantasy tend to be lumped together,

65
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,700
which kind of bugs me because they are generally quite different genres.

66
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,700
Fantasy is more seeking to mythologize.

67
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,700
Science fiction tends to look forward and explore anxieties and fears

68
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,700
relating to our shared future and to technology.

69
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,700
The Transformers movies fall much more on the mythologizing side of the spectrum

70
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,700
than the forward-looking side.

71
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,700
Hell, the fifth movie has King Arthur as a major plot point,

72
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,700
so wouldn't that make them more fantastical?

73
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,700
The films are much more concerned with ideas like destiny and honor, such as it were,

74
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,700
and way less in how speculative elements affect our future and our shared humanity,

75
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,700
similar to what you would see in a film like Arrival or Blade Runner.

76
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,700
You could make the case for Transformers as science fantasy more in the vein of Star Wars,

77
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,700
but that feels incomplete, too.

78
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,700
Let's look at something like Universal's The Mummy, which is on its third major iteration.

79
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,700
The first version of The Mummy, which starred Boris Karloff and was released in 1932,

80
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,700
would now be classified as horror.

81
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,700
But the 1999 remake, released in a wildly different time for a different market,

82
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,700
retained little of the horror element and was more of a fantasy action comedy.

83
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,700
And the new version would fall into the genre of...

84
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,700
God, I honestly have no idea what they were going for,

85
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,700
but I think the intent was more to lump it in with Transformers,

86
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:59,700
into this nascent genre of big-budget nostalgia-based action fantasy camp.

87
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,700
The b-b-nag-b-genre.

88
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,700
I mean, you have a better name?

89
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,700
You could also make the case that directors are a genre,

90
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,700
because with certain directors come certain expectations.

91
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,700
Michael Bay is almost a genre unto himself.

92
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,700
And that helps people contextualize, or even excuse, the badness of his films.

93
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,700
And I cannot tell you how many times I've heard that defense of Michael Bay,

94
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,700
like, it's Michael Bay, it's not supposed to be good.

95
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,700
It's like, would you say that about food?

96
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,700
Like, some food's just not supposed to taste good, okay?

97
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,700
Just eat it!

98
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,700
Let's look at an example of director-as-genre working against a movie's favor.

99
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,700
With Steven Spielberg's A.I., many people came away from the film

100
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,700
feeling the ending to be almost saccharine.

101
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,700
Typical Spielbergian.

102
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,700
But would people look at it that way if they saw it as a Kubrick film?

103
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,700
Which, really, it was.

104
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,700
If you look at A.I. through the lens of Kubrick as auteur,

105
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,700
the ending no longer seems so saccharine, the outlook no longer so optimistic.

106
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,700
That shift in expectation and subversion of expectation alone

107
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,700
completely shifts how the viewer frames the movie.

108
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:09,700
All the problems seem to have disappeared from his mommy's mind.

109
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,700
So without changing a single frame of the film,

110
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,700
just looking at the film in the context of the Kubrick canon

111
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,700
rather than the Spielberg canon changes how the audience perceives the movie.

112
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,700
Movies with Mikey did a great in-depth look at this movie,

113
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,700
and you should check it out for more on this dynamic.

114
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,700
So genre is a part of film language because it helps the audience

115
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,700
contextualize what they are seeing.

116
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,700
A part of that context is expectation,

117
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,700
but important also is the subversion of expectation.

118
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,700
Genre films have to build on the language of previous genre films.

119
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,700
Expand on its subverted audience expectations, but not too much.

120
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,700
Without that subversion of genre, audiences will stop showing up

121
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,700
because they've seen this all before, and it's starting to feel stale.

122
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,700
This was basically what happened to Disney movies after the 90s renaissance.

123
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,700
The films got too repetitive.

124
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,700
But then when Disney tried to break from its mold and expand,

125
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,700
it got alienating to their core audience.

126
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,700
Genres also have a life cycle.

127
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,700
In a recent episode of The Nerdwriter titled Logan, Superhero Movies Get Old,

128
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,700
Nerdwriter cites an essay written by John G. Coelte,

129
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,700
which uses Chinatown as its example of generic transformation in American film.

130
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,700
You should also take the time to check that out if you haven't.

131
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,700
But the basic takeaway here is that genre conventions eventually become so embedded

132
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,700
that genres must change.

133
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,700
Audiences either demand a greater complexity from the genre,

134
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,700
or the genre fades away.

135
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,700
Take Westerns, for example.

136
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,700
The Western genre as it once was is dead.

137
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,700
Sure, you get the occasional send-up or homage,

138
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,700
but they do not fall into the genre of Western as it was once known.

139
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,700
And Westerns as the genre was once known won't ever come back

140
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,700
because America's relationship with its own identity,

141
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,700
which at one point created an environment for Westerns to flourish, has changed.

142
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,700
In the heyday of the Western, a generally whitewashed version of Manifest Destiny

143
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,700
was what was known and accepted by most consumers.

144
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,700
The genre as a whole romanticized the exploitation, degradation,

145
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,700
and genocide of indigenous Americans.

146
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,700
And you can cry foul at the PC police trying to brainwash

147
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,700
your crymate river with your liberal tears

148
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,700
to no flake I don't care about the plight of the Native Americans.

149
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,700
They had to die so we could put, you know, like Cedar Point,

150
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,700
and Applebee's, and a Buffalo Wild Wings,

151
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,700
and a Cheesecake Factory on their ancestral homeland,

152
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,700
and I'm gonna watch all the Westerns I want.

153
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,700
But most audiences are not so eager to consume

154
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,700
that particular interpretation of the Old West anymore.

155
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,700
Audiences started to realize that there was something off

156
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,700
about this romantic portrayal of the American West,

157
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,700
just like they realize there's something off with

158
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,700
Gone With the Wind's romantic portrayal of the American South

159
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,700
after the Civil Rights Movement.

160
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,700
Manifest Destiny and all of its evils are baked into the genre,

161
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,700
and the genre lost its popularity when American expansionism

162
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,700
lost its romance for audiences.

163
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,700
Obviously, hashtag not all audiences,

164
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,700
but enough to mean it was no longer financially lucrative.

165
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,700
And that's part of what made Blazing Saddles so brilliant in its time.

166
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,700
Yes, this is Blazing Saddles praise number 452,263 on this channel.

167
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,700
Don't at me.

168
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,700
Blazing Saddles not only touches on America's history of racial exploitation,

169
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,700
that's what the movie is about.

170
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,700
Well, boys, the break's over.

171
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,700
Through what Coelty describes as burlesque,

172
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,700
Blazing Saddles lovingly destroyed the magic surrounding the genre.

173
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,700
Mel Brooks said that his Western parody came from a place of love,

174
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,700
and that might be true,

175
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,700
but Blazing Saddles definitely helped kill the Western.

176
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,700
And obviously it wasn't only the loss of the romance of the Western that killed it.

177
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,700
The genre began to be associated with old squares,

178
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,700
newer science fiction actioners and police procedurals replaced it in popularity,

179
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,700
a more global film market means the subject is less appealing to non-Americans.

180
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,700
All of these things contribute to the birth and death of genres.

181
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,700
That's why you don't really think of more recent films like

182
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,700
There Will Be Blood and True Grit, itself a remake of a Western, as Westerns.

183
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,700
They're more in the vein of historical fiction,

184
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,700
and don't romanticize a bold, brave frontier history

185
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,700
in the manner typically associated with the Western genre.

186
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,700
So, Nerdwriter contends that Logan could be considered the product of exhaustion

187
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,700
with superhero movies, and I think that's true.

188
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,700
But this genre that we're starting to feel so exhausted by,

189
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,700
I think it's bigger than superhero movies, and I think it's changing.

190
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,700
The creation of shared cinematic universes

191
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,700
is creating something of a saturation point.

192
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,700
Superhero movies are moving away from herodom and more towards mythologizing.

193
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,700
So this new Mummy remake, everything Marvel and DC is putting out,

194
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,700
even Transformers, these movies all have much more in common with each other

195
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,700
than with classic horror superheroes or the science fiction that may have inspired them.

196
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,700
All of these are examples of generic transformation.

197
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,700
Heh, get it, because it's Transformers.

198
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,700
Or recontextualization.

199
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,700
They may be inspired by niche genres,

200
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,700
but I think what we're seeing instead is something new,

201
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,700
something that history will contextualize as separate from the genres that inspired them.

202
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,700
This new genre that's drawing elements from other, more niche genres

203
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,700
to create this sort of mainstream hydra.

204
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,700
And that's the thing about contextualization.

205
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,700
Ultimately, that's history's job.

206
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,700
So, film historians of the future will doubtless give a name

207
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,700
to this current era we are living in of bibimbafak.

208
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,700
Or, you know, like, film historian aliens that are trying to, like, piece together

209
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,700
and figure out what our deal was as a civilization.

210
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,700
And yes, I'm pretty sure that the aliens trying to cobble together the remnants of our civilization

211
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,700
are gonna have, like, huge nerds that care very much what genre the Transformers films fell into.

212
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,700
I am more sure that aliens have nerds than we will survive as a civilization.

213
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,700
But as for what genre history will assign this period of film we are currently living through,

214
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,700
only history will tell.

215
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,700
Or alien nerds.
