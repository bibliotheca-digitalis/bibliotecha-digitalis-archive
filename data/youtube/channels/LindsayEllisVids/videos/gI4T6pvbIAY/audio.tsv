0	4000	Okay, so today we are drinking around the world at Epcot.
4000	7000	Because Epcot has roughly 12 countries.
7000	8000	It's like 11.
8000	9000	11.
9000	14000	The challenge is, there's 11 countries and you have to drink a thing from each of them.
14000	16000	My budget is $100. Can it be done?
17000	18000	Is it good?
28000	32000	You think you're an adult with a job, and a dog, and planning a wedding,
32000	35000	and then the next thing you know you aren't dressed up like Quasimodo.
35000	38000	Because you're like, hey, wouldn't it be fun to get drunk?
47000	49000	It's getting late.
49000	50000	So what have we got?
50000	53000	I got a jalapeno margarita.
54000	57000	I got some root beer with sugar on it.
57000	59000	I got the beet margarita.
59000	61000	Some kind of huevo thing.
61000	63000	I'm Penny Frenzel.
63000	66000	And this is your guide to drinking at the cheapest Disney World.
66000	71000	Okay, so Nella and Michael finally showed up.
71000	75000	They will get their drink and we can finally move on to the rest of the world.
76000	77000	Alright.
77000	80000	I got the minty pineapple margarita.
80000	82000	And I got the male shrimp margarita.
82000	84000	And it is good. It's very pineapple-y.
84000	85000	Woo!
85000	86000	Not very minty.
91000	93000	Aquavit here in Norway.
93000	97000	Black licorice flavored liquor that tastes like it's been sitting in a sink.
97000	101000	Normally I'd be here for this, but I'm totally not here for this.
101000	104000	When you make an alcohol entirely based on licorice?
104000	106000	Like, I just...
106000	108000	I'll do it. I'll soldier through.
119000	121000	Okay, so I got this Dragon Pearl.
121000	123000	Which, I don't know if you get what's in it.
123000	125000	But there's at least beer and honey and tapioca.
125000	128000	Which I think is a very Chinese flavor combination.
128000	130000	So I'm gonna see what this is all about.
132000	133000	Oh no.
133000	134000	Oh man, that's weird.
134000	135000	It's a texture thing.
135000	136000	Look at that, look at that.
136000	140000	See that? Tapioca, alcohol, tapioca, alcohol, tapioca.
140000	141000	I'm gonna...
141000	142000	Yeah, it's Capri Sun.
142000	144000	It's Capri Sun with alcohol.
146000	147000	Am I wrong?
147000	149000	No, my god. It tastes like fifth grade.
152000	153000	Wow.
153000	154000	Wow, it is Capri Sun.
154000	155000	It even has the same kick.
155000	158000	I feel like this is how you get kids drinking at an early age.
158000	159000	You just slip this in.
159000	160000	Yeah, and then...
161000	163000	Versus the Capri Sun plum wine.
163000	165000	Next thing you know, they're on gin.
171000	172000	How do you feel right now?
173000	174000	This is me.
174000	175000	Hit me.
176000	177000	Hit me.
177000	178000	Hi!
178000	180000	I've got some serious bloating issues.
181000	182000	Oh, me too.
182000	183000	You've got the hydrocephalus.
183000	188000	No, I've just been traveling and I've got a slight constipation.
188000	193000	I got the Francis Conner German beer, which was only $6.50.
193000	195000	So, a deal.
195000	197000	And it's quite delightful, too.
197000	199000	The Erdinger.
200000	202000	It's this very nice malty German beer.
204000	207000	No one hops, high in body, dark, and filling.
207000	209000	If I may directly refer to it, it's a very important duck.
210000	212000	I said it's an important duck.
212000	213000	Very important duck.
214000	219000	For $9, the wine cellar in the Germany Pavilion is the best value.
219000	221000	You can get a glass of wine for $6.
222000	223000	Okay, let's look at this.
226000	227000	We got it from Norma.
228000	229000	It's very good.
229000	230000	That's a nice one.
233000	234000	Post.
234000	235000	We need to get post.
235000	236000	Yeah.
239000	241000	So, I have gotten the All Bubbles All the Time,
241000	248000	which is a three variety flight of sparkling white wine.
248000	251000	In the words of Betty Murphy, to paraphrase,
251000	253000	my girl likes to party all the time.
254000	257000	My girl likes to All Bubbles All the Time.
259000	261000	I only feel a little sick.
261000	263000	I like that these are sweet.
263000	266000	They will make me feel less pukey than I already do.
266000	268000	What would you consider your drunkenness level?
269000	271000	I'm a very pleasant 5.
271000	277000	So, I feel like if 1 is nothing and 10 is blacking out,
277000	279000	I'd say I'm at about 6.
279000	280000	I'm at about 5.
280000	282000	I'm 6, pushing 7.
282000	283000	Here's where we're at.
283000	286000	The New York primary just happened and no one's brought up politics,
286000	287000	so I think we're doing pretty well.
287000	288000	Yes, exactly.
294000	296000	I think America might be the worst one.
296000	299000	There is acapella California dreaming.
300000	302000	Welcome to the Great American Experience.
302000	305000	We're in America, which is totally different from the place where we normally are.
305000	309000	I was going to be brave and get a Jack Daniels cherry slushy,
309000	312000	but I wussied out and got a California thing.
312000	314000	I'm going to be brave.
314000	315000	I'm going to be brave.
315000	316000	I'm going to be brave.
316000	317000	I'm going to be brave.
317000	318000	I'm going to be brave.
318000	319000	I'm going to be brave.
319000	320000	I'm going to be brave.
320000	321000	I'm going to be brave.
321000	322000	I'm going to be brave.
322000	323000	I'm going to be brave.
323000	324000	I'm going to be brave.
324000	325000	I'm going to be brave.
325000	326000	I'm going to be brave.
327000	329000	Mmm, that tastes like happy hour white.
329000	334000	I got a wonderful maple bacon stout.
334000	335000	Oh, you got the maple bacon stout.
335000	337000	It's for science.
337000	340000	It's half for science and it's half for me.
340000	342000	They're two things I really love.
342000	345000	I got the three daughters Ron Fender red ale.
345000	347000	I love a red ale.
347000	350000	It's a little weak, but still really smooth and lovely.
350000	356000	Although, it also got me to level 33 and untapped for Land of the Free.
356000	358000	I love my American Pie.
358000	360000	I did the American Pie.
360000	363000	I just paid $8 for a glass of Sutter Home.
363000	365000	$8 for a glass of Sutter Home.
365000	367000	God damn it.
367000	368000	I did it.
371000	373000	I took it like a shot.
377000	378000	I did it.
380000	383000	I am well past the forgetting things phase.
383000	388000	I am aware, but I'm a traditionalist, so I have some hot sake right here.
388000	389000	I got a Tokyo Sazen.
389000	391000	It's like a screwdriver but with sake, I think.
391000	393000	It's very astringent.
393000	395000	There's a lot of vinegarness to it.
395000	397000	I have to finish this apparently.
397000	398000	It's great. I love it.
398000	399000	Kawaii moto pro.
400000	402000	I need to capture this thing that I'm feeling,
402000	407000	which is that simply I would be enjoying the shit out of this
407000	409000	if it was the first thing I had.
409000	412000	Because it is like fundamentally delicious,
412000	414000	but right now it feels like a chore.
414000	416000	I am not going to puke.
416000	421000	Oh God, it's raining and we have like, I don't know,
421000	423000	between 5 and 20 left.
423000	428000	Morocco, Canada, France, question mark.
428000	431000	We got this. We got this.
431000	433000	I'm not going to puke.
434000	438000	Okay, we are in Morocco.
438000	442000	You know, that land of traditional,
442000	446000	alcoholic spirits.
446000	449000	And I've lost everyone else.
449000	452000	At least the ones that are not holding the camera.
452000	455000	And what have we got?
455000	457000	This is the coffee plus.
457000	459000	I'm trying to catch a little bit.
462000	465000	That tastes like a thing that should not be mixed with liquor.
466000	469000	So there was rain and the outdoor pavilion
469000	474000	for the special thing going on in Epcot was closed.
474000	477000	So I got a normal wine at Morocco,
477000	480000	but it's open again because the rain has passed.
480000	482000	And they have a sparkling white wine
482000	485000	with pomegranate liqueur on top and I want it.
485000	487000	And I am doing it.
487000	489000	Two drinks, one country.
489000	491000	Right now I have a red wine sangria,
491000	493000	which is a red wine,
493000	497000	typically a full-bodied, kind of chewy kind of wine,
497000	501000	which has been marinated in fruit or vice versa.
501000	503000	I've got mine.
503000	504000	Oh, goodness.
504000	506000	We did it.
506000	507000	We did it.
507000	509000	We did two drinks, one country.
509000	511000	But it's a really delightful, dry,
511000	514000	with a hint of pomegranate and sweetness,
514000	516000	but still really drinkable, really delightful.
516000	517000	I'm enjoying it.
517000	519000	This belongs in a brunch.
519000	520000	Dutch angle.
520000	521000	It wants to be brunch.
521000	523000	I had a sip and it was so much better
523000	526000	than the mistake I made in the form of coffee.
526000	527000	I mean, the thing is,
527000	530000	if you spend money on a drink in Epcot,
530000	532000	I feel like you're not really disappointed.
538000	539000	You're a monster.
539000	540000	Wait, say, I'm a monster.
540000	542000	I'm a monster, you know.
543000	545000	You are deformed.
545000	547000	And you are ugly.
547000	549000	I learned that you can trust in this whole Epcot.
549000	551000	You're my only friend.
551000	553000	I am your one defender.
553000	555000	Rum marie slushie.
555000	557000	Oh, God, it tastes like a dreamsicle.
557000	560000	Singing the song of angry men.
560000	563000	It is the music of a people
563000	565000	who will not be slaves again.
565000	567000	Somewhere beyond the man.
567000	570000	The 737 is the USS Kentucky.
570000	573000	So, if anyone watches this
573000	576000	and is currently serving on
576000	578000	or has served on
578000	580000	the USS Kentucky,
580000	581000	f*** you.
581000	583000	Beyond the barricade
583000	586000	is there a world you long to see?
586000	588000	You know,
588000	589000	but f*** you.
589000	591000	Well, where were you?
591000	593000	I was on the USS Kentucky.
593000	594000	Oh, okay, so that makes it okay.
594000	595000	The joy and the fright
595000	596000	that we give
596000	598000	is the right to be free.
598000	600000	God, this is awful.
600000	601000	Bad life decision.
601000	603000	I'm not angry,
603000	604000	but I'm quasi-nervous.
604000	606000	My sandwiches are awful.
606000	608000	I have not gone beyond
608000	609000	the tower.
609000	611000	Is this what alcohol tastes like?
611000	612000	Yeah, I was like, I brought you grapes
612000	614000	and you were like, oh.
614000	617000	I've been locked in a place for 20 years.
617000	619000	Wow, you found a way to make ice crystals?
619000	621000	That's amazing.
621000	624000	This is the worst thing in Epcot.
624000	625000	I've become deaf.
625000	627000	So now I have this from Florida
627000	628000	and this from France.
628000	629000	Two F's.
629000	631000	This would have failed me in school.
631000	633000	My parents would have been very disappointed.
633000	635000	They're very disappointed now.
635000	638000	Singing the song of angry men.
638000	640000	I just want to say
640000	643000	that thank you for this moment.
643000	646000	It is the music of the people
646000	649000	who will not be slaves again.
649000	651000	To consume all of this alcohol.
654000	655000	Thank you, Disney.
655000	658000	When the beating of your heart.
666000	668000	I've lost everyone else.
670000	673000	This is the thing that happens to me.
673000	675000	I do know that I sneeze after
675000	677000	X amount of alcohol.
677000	679000	Usually X amount is pretty low.
680000	682000	But right now my number...
683000	684000	30.
684000	686000	Only one country left.
687000	688000	Some of us.
690000	693000	I'm gonna have to sneeze our way to the finish line.
693000	694000	Hey, 10pm.
695000	696000	I found him.
697000	699000	And I got my something something ale.
699000	700000	Waddington.
700000	701000	It's garbage.
701000	702000	I mean, it's great.
702000	703000	I love it.
705000	706000	What is it?
706000	707000	God save the queen.
707000	708000	Honestly?
708000	711000	If you want me to be honest, I don't know.
711000	714000	It's probably the eating bad habits of some people.
714000	715000	God save the queen.
715000	718000	And I think the queen needs saving.
725000	727000	So here we are in Canada.
727000	728000	Three days later.
728000	733000	Because we didn't finish filming our thing.
733000	734000	But we did finish it.
734000	739000	And we finished with crown royal maple flavor.
740000	741000	It was just a shot.
741000	742000	Do you remember it?
742000	743000	I do.
743000	746000	I remember a maple essence hitting my palate.
746000	748000	Mixed well with the despair.
748000	751000	So what did we learn about the Epcot Challenge?
751000	752000	Eat.
752000	753000	If you must do it.
753000	755000	Remember to eat.
755000	757000	I saw it's almost 2 o'clock.
757000	760000	It's 2 o'clock right now and I saw some people just starting it.
760000	762000	Did you scream at them?
762000	764000	No, you need to eat.
764000	768000	You will forget to eat because you won't be hungry because you're drinking constantly.
769000	771000	And then by the time you get to Canada.
771000	774000	You'll be crying and not remembering anything.
774000	775000	No one cried.
775000	776000	That's the miracle.
776000	778000	We had 4 participants and no tears.
778000	779000	No tears.
779000	780000	There was some pouting.
780000	783000	There was a minor argument over a stupid thing.
785000	786000	No one cries.
786000	788000	No friendships were lost or broken.
788000	790000	No one vomited on the premises.
790000	792000	No one vomited on premises.
792000	794000	We waited until we got back to the resort.
794000	795000	Kept that all in.
795000	796000	Yeah, kept that in.
797000	798000	That's fairly successful.
798000	799000	Yeah.
799000	800000	That's pretty successful.
800000	802000	I did the Epcot Challenge once by myself and I didn't vote.
804000	806000	Okay, so the importance of electrolytes.
806000	811000	So I came prepared with potassium tablets and coconut water.
811000	813000	Which I forced down her throat.
813000	815000	Like a goose being fed for pate.
815000	817000	At the end of the night she was like forcing it.
817000	821000	Yeah, and you were like kind of gibberishing like some reason why I shouldn't.
821000	822000	Like, no I don't want it.
822000	823000	I was like, yes you do.
823000	825000	And no hangover the next day.
825000	826000	I felt great.
826000	827000	Yeah, that is the magic.
827000	831000	Like, if you don't want a hangover, because we're like either pushing 30 or in our 30s.
831000	835000	If you don't want a hangover, coconut water and potassium tablets.
835000	839000	Like, we have had no hangovers this whole trip, which is a minor miracle.
839000	840000	I know.
840000	842000	I mean, you don't want to waste your time at Disney World being hungover.
842000	843000	No.
843000	844000	So that's the thing I must impress the most.
844000	847000	Start early, eat, and remember coconut water.
847000	848000	And hydrate.
848000	849000	And hydrate.
849000	850000	Very important.
850000	853000	So I guess we'll see you next week?
853000	855000	Cheers.
