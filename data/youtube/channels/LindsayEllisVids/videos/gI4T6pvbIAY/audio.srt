1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, so today we are drinking around the world at Epcot.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Because Epcot has roughly 12 countries.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's like 11.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
11.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The challenge is, there's 11 countries and you have to drink a thing from each of them.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
My budget is $100. Can it be done?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Is it good?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You think you're an adult with a job, and a dog, and planning a wedding,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and then the next thing you know you aren't dressed up like Quasimodo.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Because you're like, hey, wouldn't it be fun to get drunk?

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's getting late.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So what have we got?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I got a jalapeno margarita.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I got some root beer with sugar on it.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I got the beet margarita.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Some kind of huevo thing.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm Penny Frenzel.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And this is your guide to drinking at the cheapest Disney World.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay, so Nella and Michael finally showed up.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
They will get their drink and we can finally move on to the rest of the world.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Alright.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I got the minty pineapple margarita.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And I got the male shrimp margarita.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And it is good. It's very pineapple-y.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Woo!

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Not very minty.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Aquavit here in Norway.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Black licorice flavored liquor that tastes like it's been sitting in a sink.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Normally I'd be here for this, but I'm totally not here for this.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
When you make an alcohol entirely based on licorice?

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Like, I just...

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'll do it. I'll soldier through.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Okay, so I got this Dragon Pearl.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Which, I don't know if you get what's in it.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But there's at least beer and honey and tapioca.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Which I think is a very Chinese flavor combination.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So I'm gonna see what this is all about.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh no.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh man, that's weird.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's a texture thing.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Look at that, look at that.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
See that? Tapioca, alcohol, tapioca, alcohol, tapioca.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm gonna...

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah, it's Capri Sun.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's Capri Sun with alcohol.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Am I wrong?

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No, my god. It tastes like fifth grade.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Wow.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Wow, it is Capri Sun.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It even has the same kick.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I feel like this is how you get kids drinking at an early age.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You just slip this in.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah, and then...

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Versus the Capri Sun plum wine.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Next thing you know, they're on gin.

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
How do you feel right now?

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This is me.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Hit me.

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hit me.

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Hi!

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I've got some serious bloating issues.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh, me too.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You've got the hydrocephalus.

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
No, I've just been traveling and I've got a slight constipation.

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I got the Francis Conner German beer, which was only $6.50.

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So, a deal.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And it's quite delightful, too.

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The Erdinger.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's this very nice malty German beer.

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No one hops, high in body, dark, and filling.

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If I may directly refer to it, it's a very important duck.

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I said it's an important duck.

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Very important duck.

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
For $9, the wine cellar in the Germany Pavilion is the best value.

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You can get a glass of wine for $6.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay, let's look at this.

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We got it from Norma.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's very good.

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's a nice one.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Post.

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
We need to get post.

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah.

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So, I have gotten the All Bubbles All the Time,

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
which is a three variety flight of sparkling white wine.

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
In the words of Betty Murphy, to paraphrase,

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
my girl likes to party all the time.

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
My girl likes to All Bubbles All the Time.

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I only feel a little sick.

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I like that these are sweet.

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
They will make me feel less pukey than I already do.

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What would you consider your drunkenness level?

92
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm a very pleasant 5.

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So, I feel like if 1 is nothing and 10 is blacking out,

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'd say I'm at about 6.

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm at about 5.

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm 6, pushing 7.

97
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Here's where we're at.

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The New York primary just happened and no one's brought up politics,

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
so I think we're doing pretty well.

100
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes, exactly.

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I think America might be the worst one.

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
There is acapella California dreaming.

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Welcome to the Great American Experience.

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We're in America, which is totally different from the place where we normally are.

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I was going to be brave and get a Jack Daniels cherry slushy,

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
but I wussied out and got a California thing.

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm going to be brave.

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm going to be brave.

109
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm going to be brave.

110
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm going to be brave.

111
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm going to be brave.

112
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm going to be brave.

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm going to be brave.

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm going to be brave.

115
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm going to be brave.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm going to be brave.

117
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm going to be brave.

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm going to be brave.

119
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm going to be brave.

120
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Mmm, that tastes like happy hour white.

121
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I got a wonderful maple bacon stout.

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Oh, you got the maple bacon stout.

123
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's for science.

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's half for science and it's half for me.

125
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
They're two things I really love.

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I got the three daughters Ron Fender red ale.

127
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I love a red ale.

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's a little weak, but still really smooth and lovely.

129
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Although, it also got me to level 33 and untapped for Land of the Free.

130
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I love my American Pie.

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I did the American Pie.

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I just paid $8 for a glass of Sutter Home.

133
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
$8 for a glass of Sutter Home.

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
God damn it.

135
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I did it.

136
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I took it like a shot.

137
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I did it.

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I am well past the forgetting things phase.

139
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I am aware, but I'm a traditionalist, so I have some hot sake right here.

140
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I got a Tokyo Sazen.

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's like a screwdriver but with sake, I think.

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's very astringent.

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
There's a lot of vinegarness to it.

144
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I have to finish this apparently.

145
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's great. I love it.

146
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Kawaii moto pro.

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I need to capture this thing that I'm feeling,

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
which is that simply I would be enjoying the shit out of this

149
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
if it was the first thing I had.

150
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Because it is like fundamentally delicious,

151
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
but right now it feels like a chore.

152
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I am not going to puke.

153
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Oh God, it's raining and we have like, I don't know,

154
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
between 5 and 20 left.

155
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Morocco, Canada, France, question mark.

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
We got this. We got this.

157
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm not going to puke.

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Okay, we are in Morocco.

159
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You know, that land of traditional,

160
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
alcoholic spirits.

161
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And I've lost everyone else.

162
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
At least the ones that are not holding the camera.

163
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And what have we got?

164
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This is the coffee plus.

165
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm trying to catch a little bit.

166
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That tastes like a thing that should not be mixed with liquor.

167
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So there was rain and the outdoor pavilion

168
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
for the special thing going on in Epcot was closed.

169
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So I got a normal wine at Morocco,

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
but it's open again because the rain has passed.

171
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And they have a sparkling white wine

172
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
with pomegranate liqueur on top and I want it.

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And I am doing it.

174
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Two drinks, one country.

175
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Right now I have a red wine sangria,

176
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
which is a red wine,

177
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
typically a full-bodied, kind of chewy kind of wine,

178
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
which has been marinated in fruit or vice versa.

179
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I've got mine.

180
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh, goodness.

181
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We did it.

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We did it.

183
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
We did two drinks, one country.

184
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But it's a really delightful, dry,

185
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
with a hint of pomegranate and sweetness,

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
but still really drinkable, really delightful.

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm enjoying it.

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
This belongs in a brunch.

189
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Dutch angle.

190
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It wants to be brunch.

191
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I had a sip and it was so much better

192
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
than the mistake I made in the form of coffee.

193
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I mean, the thing is,

194
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
if you spend money on a drink in Epcot,

195
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I feel like you're not really disappointed.

196
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You're a monster.

197
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Wait, say, I'm a monster.

198
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm a monster, you know.

199
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You are deformed.

200
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And you are ugly.

201
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I learned that you can trust in this whole Epcot.

202
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You're my only friend.

203
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I am your one defender.

204
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Rum marie slushie.

205
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh, God, it tastes like a dreamsicle.

206
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Singing the song of angry men.

207
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It is the music of a people

208
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
who will not be slaves again.

209
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Somewhere beyond the man.

210
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The 737 is the USS Kentucky.

211
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So, if anyone watches this

212
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and is currently serving on

213
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
or has served on

214
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
the USS Kentucky,

215
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
f*** you.

216
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Beyond the barricade

217
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
is there a world you long to see?

218
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You know,

219
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
but f*** you.

220
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Well, where were you?

221
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I was on the USS Kentucky.

222
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Oh, okay, so that makes it okay.

223
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The joy and the fright

224
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
that we give

225
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
is the right to be free.

226
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
God, this is awful.

227
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Bad life decision.

228
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm not angry,

229
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
but I'm quasi-nervous.

230
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
My sandwiches are awful.

231
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I have not gone beyond

232
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
the tower.

233
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Is this what alcohol tastes like?

234
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah, I was like, I brought you grapes

235
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and you were like, oh.

236
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I've been locked in a place for 20 years.

237
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Wow, you found a way to make ice crystals?

238
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That's amazing.

239
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
This is the worst thing in Epcot.

240
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I've become deaf.

241
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So now I have this from Florida

242
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and this from France.

243
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Two F's.

244
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This would have failed me in school.

245
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
My parents would have been very disappointed.

246
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
They're very disappointed now.

247
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Singing the song of angry men.

248
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I just want to say

249
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
that thank you for this moment.

250
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It is the music of the people

251
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
who will not be slaves again.

252
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
To consume all of this alcohol.

253
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Thank you, Disney.

254
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
When the beating of your heart.

255
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I've lost everyone else.

256
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
This is the thing that happens to me.

257
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I do know that I sneeze after

258
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
X amount of alcohol.

259
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Usually X amount is pretty low.

260
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But right now my number...

261
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
30.

262
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Only one country left.

263
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Some of us.

264
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm gonna have to sneeze our way to the finish line.

265
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Hey, 10pm.

266
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I found him.

267
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And I got my something something ale.

268
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Waddington.

269
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's garbage.

270
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I mean, it's great.

271
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I love it.

272
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What is it?

273
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
God save the queen.

274
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Honestly?

275
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
If you want me to be honest, I don't know.

276
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's probably the eating bad habits of some people.

277
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
God save the queen.

278
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And I think the queen needs saving.

279
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So here we are in Canada.

280
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Three days later.

281
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Because we didn't finish filming our thing.

282
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But we did finish it.

283
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And we finished with crown royal maple flavor.

284
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It was just a shot.

285
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Do you remember it?

286
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I do.

287
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I remember a maple essence hitting my palate.

288
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Mixed well with the despair.

289
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So what did we learn about the Epcot Challenge?

290
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Eat.

291
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
If you must do it.

292
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Remember to eat.

293
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I saw it's almost 2 o'clock.

294
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's 2 o'clock right now and I saw some people just starting it.

295
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Did you scream at them?

296
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
No, you need to eat.

297
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You will forget to eat because you won't be hungry because you're drinking constantly.

298
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And then by the time you get to Canada.

299
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You'll be crying and not remembering anything.

300
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
No one cried.

301
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That's the miracle.

302
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We had 4 participants and no tears.

303
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
No tears.

304
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
There was some pouting.

305
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
There was a minor argument over a stupid thing.

306
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
No one cries.

307
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
No friendships were lost or broken.

308
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
No one vomited on the premises.

309
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
No one vomited on premises.

310
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
We waited until we got back to the resort.

311
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Kept that all in.

312
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah, kept that in.

313
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That's fairly successful.

314
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah.

315
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
That's pretty successful.

316
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I did the Epcot Challenge once by myself and I didn't vote.

317
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Okay, so the importance of electrolytes.

318
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So I came prepared with potassium tablets and coconut water.

319
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Which I forced down her throat.

320
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Like a goose being fed for pate.

321
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
At the end of the night she was like forcing it.

322
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah, and you were like kind of gibberishing like some reason why I shouldn't.

323
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Like, no I don't want it.

324
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I was like, yes you do.

325
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And no hangover the next day.

326
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I felt great.

327
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah, that is the magic.

328
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Like, if you don't want a hangover, because we're like either pushing 30 or in our 30s.

329
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
If you don't want a hangover, coconut water and potassium tablets.

330
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Like, we have had no hangovers this whole trip, which is a minor miracle.

331
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I know.

332
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I mean, you don't want to waste your time at Disney World being hungover.

333
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
No.

334
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So that's the thing I must impress the most.

335
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Start early, eat, and remember coconut water.

336
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And hydrate.

337
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And hydrate.

338
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Very important.

339
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So I guess we'll see you next week?

340
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Cheers.
