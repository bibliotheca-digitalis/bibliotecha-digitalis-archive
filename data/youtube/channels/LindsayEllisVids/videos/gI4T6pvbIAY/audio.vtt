00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Okay, so today we are drinking around the world at Epcot.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
Because Epcot has roughly 12 countries.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
It's like 11.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
11.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
The challenge is, there's 11 countries and you have to drink a thing from each of them.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
My budget is $100. Can it be done?

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
Is it good?

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
You think you're an adult with a job, and a dog, and planning a wedding,

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
and then the next thing you know you aren't dressed up like Quasimodo.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
Because you're like, hey, wouldn't it be fun to get drunk?

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
It's getting late.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
So what have we got?

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
I got a jalapeno margarita.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
I got some root beer with sugar on it.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I got the beet margarita.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Some kind of huevo thing.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
I'm Penny Frenzel.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
And this is your guide to drinking at the cheapest Disney World.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
Okay, so Nella and Michael finally showed up.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
They will get their drink and we can finally move on to the rest of the world.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Alright.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
I got the minty pineapple margarita.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
And I got the male shrimp margarita.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
And it is good. It's very pineapple-y.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Woo!

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Not very minty.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Aquavit here in Norway.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
Black licorice flavored liquor that tastes like it's been sitting in a sink.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
Normally I'd be here for this, but I'm totally not here for this.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
When you make an alcohol entirely based on licorice?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Like, I just...

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
I'll do it. I'll soldier through.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Okay, so I got this Dragon Pearl.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Which, I don't know if you get what's in it.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
But there's at least beer and honey and tapioca.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Which I think is a very Chinese flavor combination.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
So I'm gonna see what this is all about.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Oh no.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Oh man, that's weird.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
It's a texture thing.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Look at that, look at that.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
See that? Tapioca, alcohol, tapioca, alcohol, tapioca.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
I'm gonna...

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah, it's Capri Sun.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
It's Capri Sun with alcohol.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Am I wrong?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
No, my god. It tastes like fifth grade.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Wow.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Wow, it is Capri Sun.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
It even has the same kick.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
I feel like this is how you get kids drinking at an early age.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
You just slip this in.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Yeah, and then...

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Versus the Capri Sun plum wine.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Next thing you know, they're on gin.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
How do you feel right now?

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
This is me.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Hit me.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Hit me.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Hi!

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
I've got some serious bloating issues.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Oh, me too.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
You've got the hydrocephalus.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
No, I've just been traveling and I've got a slight constipation.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
I got the Francis Conner German beer, which was only $6.50.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
So, a deal.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
And it's quite delightful, too.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
The Erdinger.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
It's this very nice malty German beer.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
No one hops, high in body, dark, and filling.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
If I may directly refer to it, it's a very important duck.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
I said it's an important duck.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Very important duck.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
For $9, the wine cellar in the Germany Pavilion is the best value.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
You can get a glass of wine for $6.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Okay, let's look at this.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
We got it from Norma.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
It's very good.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
That's a nice one.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Post.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
We need to get post.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Yeah.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
So, I have gotten the All Bubbles All the Time,

04:01.000 --> 04:08.000
which is a three variety flight of sparkling white wine.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
In the words of Betty Murphy, to paraphrase,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
my girl likes to party all the time.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
My girl likes to All Bubbles All the Time.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
I only feel a little sick.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
I like that these are sweet.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
They will make me feel less pukey than I already do.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
What would you consider your drunkenness level?

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
I'm a very pleasant 5.

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
So, I feel like if 1 is nothing and 10 is blacking out,

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
I'd say I'm at about 6.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I'm at about 5.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I'm 6, pushing 7.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Here's where we're at.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
The New York primary just happened and no one's brought up politics,

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
so I think we're doing pretty well.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Yes, exactly.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
I think America might be the worst one.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
There is acapella California dreaming.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Welcome to the Great American Experience.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
We're in America, which is totally different from the place where we normally are.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
I was going to be brave and get a Jack Daniels cherry slushy,

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
but I wussied out and got a California thing.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I'm going to be brave.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
I'm going to be brave.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
I'm going to be brave.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
I'm going to be brave.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
I'm going to be brave.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
I'm going to be brave.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
I'm going to be brave.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
I'm going to be brave.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
I'm going to be brave.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
I'm going to be brave.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
I'm going to be brave.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
I'm going to be brave.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
I'm going to be brave.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Mmm, that tastes like happy hour white.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
I got a wonderful maple bacon stout.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Oh, you got the maple bacon stout.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
It's for science.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
It's half for science and it's half for me.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
They're two things I really love.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
I got the three daughters Ron Fender red ale.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
I love a red ale.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
It's a little weak, but still really smooth and lovely.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
Although, it also got me to level 33 and untapped for Land of the Free.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
I love my American Pie.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
I did the American Pie.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
I just paid $8 for a glass of Sutter Home.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
$8 for a glass of Sutter Home.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
God damn it.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
I did it.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
I took it like a shot.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
I did it.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
I am well past the forgetting things phase.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
I am aware, but I'm a traditionalist, so I have some hot sake right here.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
I got a Tokyo Sazen.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
It's like a screwdriver but with sake, I think.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
It's very astringent.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
There's a lot of vinegarness to it.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
I have to finish this apparently.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
It's great. I love it.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Kawaii moto pro.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I need to capture this thing that I'm feeling,

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
which is that simply I would be enjoying the shit out of this

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
if it was the first thing I had.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
Because it is like fundamentally delicious,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
but right now it feels like a chore.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
I am not going to puke.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
Oh God, it's raining and we have like, I don't know,

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
between 5 and 20 left.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
Morocco, Canada, France, question mark.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
We got this. We got this.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
I'm not going to puke.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
Okay, we are in Morocco.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
You know, that land of traditional,

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
alcoholic spirits.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
And I've lost everyone else.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
At least the ones that are not holding the camera.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
And what have we got?

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
This is the coffee plus.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
I'm trying to catch a little bit.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
That tastes like a thing that should not be mixed with liquor.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
So there was rain and the outdoor pavilion

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
for the special thing going on in Epcot was closed.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
So I got a normal wine at Morocco,

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
but it's open again because the rain has passed.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
And they have a sparkling white wine

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
with pomegranate liqueur on top and I want it.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
And I am doing it.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Two drinks, one country.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Right now I have a red wine sangria,

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
which is a red wine,

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
typically a full-bodied, kind of chewy kind of wine,

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
which has been marinated in fruit or vice versa.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
I've got mine.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Oh, goodness.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
We did it.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
We did it.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
We did two drinks, one country.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
But it's a really delightful, dry,

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
with a hint of pomegranate and sweetness,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
but still really drinkable, really delightful.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
I'm enjoying it.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
This belongs in a brunch.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Dutch angle.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
It wants to be brunch.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
I had a sip and it was so much better

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
than the mistake I made in the form of coffee.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
I mean, the thing is,

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
if you spend money on a drink in Epcot,

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
I feel like you're not really disappointed.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
You're a monster.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Wait, say, I'm a monster.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
I'm a monster, you know.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
You are deformed.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
And you are ugly.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I learned that you can trust in this whole Epcot.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
You're my only friend.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I am your one defender.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Rum marie slushie.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Oh, God, it tastes like a dreamsicle.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Singing the song of angry men.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
It is the music of a people

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
who will not be slaves again.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Somewhere beyond the man.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
The 737 is the USS Kentucky.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
So, if anyone watches this

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
and is currently serving on

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
or has served on

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
the USS Kentucky,

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
f*** you.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Beyond the barricade

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
is there a world you long to see?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
You know,

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
but f*** you.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Well, where were you?

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
I was on the USS Kentucky.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Oh, okay, so that makes it okay.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
The joy and the fright

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
that we give

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
is the right to be free.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
God, this is awful.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Bad life decision.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
I'm not angry,

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
but I'm quasi-nervous.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
My sandwiches are awful.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
I have not gone beyond

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
the tower.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Is this what alcohol tastes like?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Yeah, I was like, I brought you grapes

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
and you were like, oh.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
I've been locked in a place for 20 years.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Wow, you found a way to make ice crystals?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
That's amazing.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
This is the worst thing in Epcot.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
I've become deaf.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
So now I have this from Florida

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
and this from France.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Two F's.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
This would have failed me in school.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
My parents would have been very disappointed.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
They're very disappointed now.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Singing the song of angry men.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I just want to say

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
that thank you for this moment.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
It is the music of the people

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
who will not be slaves again.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
To consume all of this alcohol.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Thank you, Disney.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
When the beating of your heart.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
I've lost everyone else.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
This is the thing that happens to me.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
I do know that I sneeze after

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
X amount of alcohol.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Usually X amount is pretty low.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
But right now my number...

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
30.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Only one country left.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Some of us.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
I'm gonna have to sneeze our way to the finish line.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Hey, 10pm.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
I found him.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
And I got my something something ale.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Waddington.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
It's garbage.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
I mean, it's great.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
I love it.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
What is it?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
God save the queen.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Honestly?

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
If you want me to be honest, I don't know.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
It's probably the eating bad habits of some people.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
God save the queen.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
And I think the queen needs saving.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
So here we are in Canada.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Three days later.

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
Because we didn't finish filming our thing.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
But we did finish it.

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
And we finished with crown royal maple flavor.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
It was just a shot.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Do you remember it?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
I do.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
I remember a maple essence hitting my palate.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Mixed well with the despair.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
So what did we learn about the Epcot Challenge?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Eat.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
If you must do it.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Remember to eat.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I saw it's almost 2 o'clock.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
It's 2 o'clock right now and I saw some people just starting it.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Did you scream at them?

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
No, you need to eat.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
You will forget to eat because you won't be hungry because you're drinking constantly.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
And then by the time you get to Canada.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
You'll be crying and not remembering anything.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
No one cried.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
That's the miracle.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
We had 4 participants and no tears.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
No tears.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
There was some pouting.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
There was a minor argument over a stupid thing.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
No one cries.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
No friendships were lost or broken.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
No one vomited on the premises.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
No one vomited on premises.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
We waited until we got back to the resort.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Kept that all in.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Yeah, kept that in.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
That's fairly successful.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Yeah.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
That's pretty successful.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
I did the Epcot Challenge once by myself and I didn't vote.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Okay, so the importance of electrolytes.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
So I came prepared with potassium tablets and coconut water.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Which I forced down her throat.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Like a goose being fed for pate.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
At the end of the night she was like forcing it.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
Yeah, and you were like kind of gibberishing like some reason why I shouldn't.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Like, no I don't want it.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
I was like, yes you do.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
And no hangover the next day.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
I felt great.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Yeah, that is the magic.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
Like, if you don't want a hangover, because we're like either pushing 30 or in our 30s.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
If you don't want a hangover, coconut water and potassium tablets.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
Like, we have had no hangovers this whole trip, which is a minor miracle.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
I know.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
I mean, you don't want to waste your time at Disney World being hungover.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
No.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
So that's the thing I must impress the most.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
Start early, eat, and remember coconut water.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
And hydrate.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
And hydrate.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Very important.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
So I guess we'll see you next week?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Cheers.
