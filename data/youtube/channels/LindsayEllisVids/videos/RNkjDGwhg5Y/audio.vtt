WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.960
So welcome back to Show of Almost Being Renamed. We're almost there, guys. We're almost there.

00:08.960 --> 00:15.560
We're almost there. I promise, I'm not. We'll keep dragging it out. Final episode. Never

00:15.560 --> 00:21.400
have to commit. No, no, no. We have to save it to episode 9. Yeah, that's when everything

00:21.400 --> 00:26.700
happens. Well, fuck Rubble. We're on 4 of season 2, so jesus. Yeah, this isn't really

00:26.700 --> 00:35.420
Tyrell-inspired, but I found it and it sounded good. Yeah. So it's got gin. It's got a lavender

00:35.420 --> 00:41.500
and sage-infused white vermouth. This is what we like to call an effort cocktail. It has

00:41.500 --> 00:46.140
gin in it. It's worth it. Yeah, it's gotta be worth it. It's got really, really expensive

00:46.140 --> 00:54.940
gin. But since this is a booze and books show, that expensive gin is a tax write-off. Cheers!

00:54.940 --> 00:57.660
So here's what happened last week, or the show that aired last week, which we shot like

00:57.660 --> 01:03.880
two weeks ago. We had decided on a title, which will be one of the finals we're about

01:03.880 --> 01:11.400
to mention, and after testing it with a few people, realized that these publishing terms

01:11.400 --> 01:19.760
that we throw around are not generally known to the populace, even writers, which surprised

01:19.760 --> 01:25.540
me quite a bit. So we decided maybe we don't have this in the bag, and we'll take it back

01:25.540 --> 01:30.160
to you! Yeah, we'll announce some finalists and see how it rolls. This one is not a finalist,

01:30.160 --> 01:36.820
but I thought it was funny. Winged Beast called it Hemingway Outsourcing, which is

01:36.820 --> 01:42.780
completely appropriate, because we do the drinking, you do the writing. Hey! Distended

01:42.780 --> 01:51.360
Livers. Odengo Otama offered Flask Fiction, which has a good alliterative ring to it.

01:51.360 --> 01:57.960
But again, it was like our focus group of one didn't get the pun. But the thing is,

01:57.960 --> 02:03.560
you don't have to get the pun to get that. It includes booze and fiction. That is absolutely

02:03.560 --> 02:09.240
true. So I like it. Which is in contrast to my personal favorite, courtesy of Ronka, which

02:09.240 --> 02:18.020
was The Lush Pile, which is of course a take on the term slush pile, which is, for those

02:18.020 --> 02:23.520
of you who don't know, because apparently most people don't, is just the term that they

02:23.520 --> 02:28.780
use for any group of unsolicited manuscripts. It's considered a slush pile. It doesn't mean

02:28.780 --> 02:34.460
they're being rejected, it just means they're unsolicited and probably unagented. So I like

02:34.460 --> 02:41.780
that a lot because it includes the word lush, and it's kind of funny. But people don't seem

02:41.780 --> 02:47.380
to know what a slush pile is, so that's a problem. Other finalists for the choosing

02:47.380 --> 02:55.380
was one from Morgan, Spirited Discussions. Yeah, that one gets to kind of the heart of

02:55.380 --> 03:02.940
the matter, but it's much more sedate. It's not very oomph-y. Despair suggested Cosmopolitan,

03:03.420 --> 03:10.540
and then boom. Like, done. I wrote it down because I think I liked the boom. I thought

03:10.540 --> 03:16.860
that you were just like, this is it. No, that was not my boom. Okay. Elliott Hochberg gave

03:16.860 --> 03:25.980
us 451 proof. Lachlan Cartland offered us first draft, which I really like. Spelled

03:25.980 --> 03:37.420
like, yeah, like, like, not, not, not, not, yeah, not, um, and I also offered pros and

03:37.420 --> 03:45.580
cons. Clever girl. Yeah, I like that first one, first draft. Becca M, she gave us top

03:45.580 --> 03:51.100
shelf, which I like a lot, except for I think that might be too classy. Yeah, that is really

03:51.660 --> 03:55.900
I mean, we make effort cocktails. Yeah, yeah, this is, this is like the rare time when we

03:55.900 --> 04:01.100
effort, but we ourselves are not classy. We say words like, like, fuck, and motherfucker,

04:01.100 --> 04:08.620
and this fucking sucks. Pabaradactyl suggested Booze Your Own Adventure, which might be the

04:08.620 --> 04:17.340
most appropriate. I know. In a way. I kind of really like that one. Yeah, so there you go. I

04:17.340 --> 04:23.900
mean, like, it might be a little too kitty, but at the same time, it totally works because that's

04:23.900 --> 04:29.580
exactly, that's, that's what we do. That is exactly what we do. So, uh, but once again,

04:29.580 --> 04:33.340
we look forward to your, uh, what you vote on.

04:39.660 --> 04:43.420
So basically we're going to do this every other week. We're going to do one episode talking about

04:43.420 --> 04:47.420
the Viridian saga, and another episode we'll do a review, so it'll be like one, two, one, two,

04:47.420 --> 04:50.620
and that's, you know, how we're going to do it for the foreseeable future. Shake it off. Yep.

04:50.620 --> 04:57.900
So the discussion about, uh, Awoken Book Two centered largely around, um, this idea of

04:57.900 --> 05:04.460
dystopia parody versus what our original idea was, which was more a parody of Tiger's Curse,

05:05.420 --> 05:11.820
because it inspired us so much. It just reached down the macadamals of my heart. It just reached

05:11.820 --> 05:17.340
down your throat. Squeeze and squeeze and said cry uncle and I said uncle uncle and it said I

05:17.340 --> 05:23.820
lied. So we wanted to do that because it was funny, but at the same time, since we are trying

05:23.820 --> 05:29.500
to do topical parodies, sort of, I think, you know, dystopia is much more of a thing than

05:30.140 --> 05:34.620
Tiger's Curse. Yeah. But that's not to say that, like, the idea of the white savior

05:35.500 --> 05:41.260
is not a thing, and we cannot, yeah, we might be able to marry these two, so that's what we're

05:41.260 --> 05:47.420
gonna, um, talk about today. We got entitled. Well, our original idea was going to be Awoken,

05:47.420 --> 05:51.820
Arisen, and Aliven. We're going to be the third one. I'm kind of wondering if, like, maybe,

05:52.540 --> 05:58.060
because I like the idea of another being the third one, like, another. Here's what I like about the

05:58.060 --> 06:02.860
idea of another being the second one, because it's the new moon, and it's, that's where, like,

06:02.860 --> 06:11.660
the triangle begins. So, another romantic interest. Glenn did point out that the title

06:11.660 --> 06:16.620
Another is kind of different stylistically, because Awoken is so what a YA book would be

06:16.620 --> 06:21.500
called, and Another is maybe too far, but we'll see. Although I really do like the idea of Aliven.

06:23.100 --> 06:26.540
I mean, I'm not married to it, but I kind of want to keep it in there somewhere. I'm just saying

06:26.540 --> 06:32.060
that. Awoken, Aliven, and Another. Sarah Jessness has always gave us a couple good ideas. Firstly,

06:32.060 --> 06:36.540
the idea that the bad parts of the dystopian society should be things that would relate

06:36.540 --> 06:41.580
directly to Sarah's personal life, rather than large political issues. Yeah. Well, because we

06:41.580 --> 06:48.300
have to completely miss the point of dystopian, totalitarian things. It can't be about grand,

06:48.300 --> 06:53.420
overarching destruction of society. No, it's about what affects me. I think that could be the build

06:53.420 --> 06:59.980
up for the dystopian matriarchy. The matriarchy? Yeah, run by Scarlet. I really like this idea of,

06:59.980 --> 07:05.660
like, the dystopian matriarchy run by Scarlet. No, it's like the Wonder Woman Amazons only,

07:05.660 --> 07:10.780
like, evil. Yeah, and really hot. And Sarah, of course. But they're not really hot. We find that

07:10.780 --> 07:16.780
out at the end of the second book, that Scarlet was ugly the whole time, just like in Cinder.

07:16.780 --> 07:21.660
Sorry, Cinder, you're getting parodied. Sorry. We still enjoyed you. Yeah, we liked you, but

07:21.900 --> 07:29.980
that Evil Queen, man. That Evil Queen. No, the veil hides her mustache. Baker JS.

07:30.860 --> 07:35.980
As a contrast, I really like the idea of a new law called the Available Healthcare Act.

07:39.340 --> 07:43.980
And Marianne Stein, who has nothing to do with Marianne Ellenson,

07:43.980 --> 07:49.340
that, yeah, we should maybe include that political everything, because Sarah, you know,

07:49.340 --> 07:56.460
is definitely going to have a but me attitude on how politics work. Also, this idea, like,

07:56.460 --> 08:02.540
the way Stephanie Meyer refers to herself as a feminist, or at least as pro-woman. Right. Which

08:02.540 --> 08:06.220
I find very interesting, and this is where it starts to take, like, it starts to dangerously

08:06.220 --> 08:13.180
tiptoe over into really condescending territory. Yeah. Because I think she means it, and I think

08:13.180 --> 08:20.620
she's trying to do right by women. She was just, you know, raised in this society and this culture

08:20.620 --> 08:28.300
where the idea of, like, what women should be and should do is just so not, like, our effete New

08:28.300 --> 08:34.780
York, you know, liberal, I need no man, you know, attitude. I think a lot of people who are raised

08:34.780 --> 08:39.340
in very conservative Christian backgrounds, or even just conservative backgrounds in general,

08:39.340 --> 08:45.900
struggle with that. And try to make a place for, I can be a powerful strong woman and still be a

08:45.900 --> 08:51.180
woman from, and what I was taught a woman is. Yeah. I think there, well, especially with young

08:51.180 --> 08:54.620
adult authors. Many of them come from that kind of background. Yeah, a lot of them come from a

08:54.620 --> 08:58.540
really strong religious background that they feel really attached to, and so they have this difficult

08:58.540 --> 09:05.580
time kind of reconciling this, you know, modern, I need no man, versus what it means to be a good

09:05.580 --> 09:13.580
woman, a moral woman, you know, what you would want your kids to look up to. Aryan Librarian says

09:13.580 --> 09:17.900
it's got to be religious freedom, right? That's got to be the thing. And also maybe love has been

09:17.900 --> 09:23.660
outlawed, which has been done in a book called Delirium, which I'm kind of afraid to read because

09:23.660 --> 09:27.580
that sounds like the dumbest thing ever. Well, I think we're gonna have to, though. If we end up

09:27.580 --> 09:32.700
going, like, oh no, not love. Well, think, I mean, but that can, that's the love and the eat, pray, love.

09:32.700 --> 09:43.340
Prayer has been outlawed. Eating has been... Organified. Oh no! Like, everyone's been sent to small

09:43.340 --> 09:49.180
communal farms. Yeah. Which is terrible. And love is... Like, I just want my fucking McDonald's. Maybe, yeah.

09:49.180 --> 09:54.300
I just want my fucking McDonald's. Why are you making me eat this, like, homegrown organic shit?

09:54.300 --> 09:59.340
What the fuck's a victory garden without my lawn? And love's been outlawed. Yeah, and also love's been

09:59.340 --> 10:04.460
outlawed because that's what happens. So we have to outsource to India. We keep saying, like, we gotta

10:04.460 --> 10:13.340
go to India, man. We have to go to India. So our original idea, after Awoken was done, was playing

10:13.340 --> 10:21.420
off of this idea of the Tiger's Curse parody. We were going to do, of course, New Moon, Riley Dumpster,

10:21.420 --> 10:29.500
again. But then a plot thing happens, and Uncle Neil is like, oh no, Vic, or Ethnic Third Wheel,

10:29.500 --> 10:37.260
he's the 10th Avatar of Vishnu. Whoopsie. And so then we go to India, and she has her big eat, pray,

10:37.260 --> 10:41.420
love journey where, you know, somehow or other we find out that she's the special because, you know,

10:41.420 --> 10:48.380
white women, we're all white women at. And at the end, I think we find out that he wasn't actually

10:48.380 --> 10:52.860
the 10th Avatar. He's not actually Kalki, the 10th Avatar of Vishnu. He was, like, something that

10:52.860 --> 10:58.220
Loki did, and we bring in, like, Loki, but it's, like, just Marvel. No, it's just Tom Hiddleston.

10:58.220 --> 11:03.580
It's just Tom Hiddleston. Like, he keeps quoting Avengers. He's always burdened with glorious

11:03.580 --> 11:12.220
something. And, you know, but then the world does end. But it's, it's, it's, it's not, it's reborn.

11:12.220 --> 11:16.460
Yeah, yeah. The old world ends, the new one's reborn, and then Uncle Neil shows up with, oh no,

11:16.460 --> 11:20.620
everything's okay. It's just we had to get rid of Thursday. Get rid of what? Oh, you see,

11:20.620 --> 11:24.220
he didn't even miss it. No one could get the hang of Thursday. Yeah, exactly. That was our original

11:24.220 --> 11:31.900
idea. So now it's, like, the question of, like, do we discard this all together, or do we try to

11:31.900 --> 11:38.540
marry this in some way with this dystopia? The white savior goes to India, and it's also a

11:38.540 --> 11:42.860
dystopia somehow. I mean, we figured out why Cthulhu goes to high school. I don't know. I don't

11:42.860 --> 11:48.060
see why we can't marry these two ideas. I'm up for the challenge. But, yeah, I'm really digging

11:48.060 --> 11:53.500
this idea of this Eat, Pray, Love actually referring to, like, eating spin-out-lot, praying

11:53.500 --> 11:58.860
spin-out-lot, love spin-out-lot. Hey, I know you like those big gulp sodas, but this is American

11:58.860 --> 12:09.660
now, buddy. We don't allow that no more. No, no! I poured it out, no! This is like prohibition all

12:09.820 --> 12:13.740
over again. It's like, and then they had, like, the soda just, like, a shot glass.

12:15.500 --> 12:21.500
You have the soda bootleggers. Like, the corner bars. The underground, and they're allowed to love

12:21.500 --> 12:26.780
and drink soda. I really like it. Okay, we gotta do the soda thing. Yeah, no, we have to do the soda

12:26.780 --> 12:32.380
thing. The totalitarian dystopia work. Because the matriarchy has to stay hot. That's why they

12:32.380 --> 12:36.860
have on soda. Yeah, because they only drink seltzer. I think the president should be

12:37.580 --> 12:49.100
McBlue Mixon. No, he's, like, Obam-Bloomburg. Obamberg. No, Bloombito. Bloombito.

12:49.100 --> 12:54.860
She's never even been to New York, but you know we're gonna, come on, we need to have Bloombito.

12:56.220 --> 13:02.460
President Bloombito. Somehow it's Vince Scarlet the whole time. That's the twist. She's the first

13:02.460 --> 13:09.740
lady. Yeah. She brainwashes him and marries him. Women. Because women am I right? Women, am I right?

13:09.740 --> 13:14.700
God. She's pretty much Robin, right? In House of Cards. Only she doesn't have Frank Underwood.

13:14.700 --> 13:20.220
Yeah, only, like, President Bloombito is just, like, whatever you say, hot wife. Yeah. Because

13:20.220 --> 13:24.380
that's how, that is how women accrue power, by being hot. So anyway, that's, that's our challenge

13:24.380 --> 13:29.660
for this week. Marrying this, like, white savior eat, pray, love thing, where we go to India and

13:29.660 --> 13:38.060
have to save the day, to the whole dystopia, trying to keep it within the whole topical parody

13:38.060 --> 13:42.060
thing. Next week, a week from now, you know how bad I am at keeping a schedule, but I'm trying to

13:42.060 --> 13:49.100
update on Mondays. We'll be doing Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs.

13:49.100 --> 13:54.780
In the meantime, please help us brainstorm at shayapocalypse.com in the comments. Make it easy.

13:54.780 --> 13:58.300
Make it easy for us in the comments. Just comment there. That's where we go.

13:58.940 --> 14:04.460
Trying to sort of collect comments from all other places. Yeah, that's hard. And of course,

14:04.460 --> 14:07.580
be our friend on Goodreads, where we will, you know, talk things, and you can also give

14:07.580 --> 14:15.900
us book recommendations there. I like this drink. Another! I would do the thing, but I'm pretty sure

14:15.900 --> 14:21.020
this is, like, maybe their last two of these styles, so. Oh, right, yeah. Another!
