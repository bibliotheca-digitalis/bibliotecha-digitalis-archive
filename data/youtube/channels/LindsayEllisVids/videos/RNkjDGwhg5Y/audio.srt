1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,960
So welcome back to Show of Almost Being Renamed. We're almost there, guys. We're almost there.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,560
We're almost there. I promise, I'm not. We'll keep dragging it out. Final episode. Never

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:21,400
have to commit. No, no, no. We have to save it to episode 9. Yeah, that's when everything

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,700
happens. Well, fuck Rubble. We're on 4 of season 2, so jesus. Yeah, this isn't really

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:35,420
Tyrell-inspired, but I found it and it sounded good. Yeah. So it's got gin. It's got a lavender

6
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:41,500
and sage-infused white vermouth. This is what we like to call an effort cocktail. It has

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,140
gin in it. It's worth it. Yeah, it's gotta be worth it. It's got really, really expensive

8
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:54,940
gin. But since this is a booze and books show, that expensive gin is a tax write-off. Cheers!

9
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,660
So here's what happened last week, or the show that aired last week, which we shot like

10
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:03,880
two weeks ago. We had decided on a title, which will be one of the finals we're about

11
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:11,400
to mention, and after testing it with a few people, realized that these publishing terms

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:19,760
that we throw around are not generally known to the populace, even writers, which surprised

13
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,540
me quite a bit. So we decided maybe we don't have this in the bag, and we'll take it back

14
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,160
to you! Yeah, we'll announce some finalists and see how it rolls. This one is not a finalist,

15
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:36,820
but I thought it was funny. Winged Beast called it Hemingway Outsourcing, which is

16
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:42,780
completely appropriate, because we do the drinking, you do the writing. Hey! Distended

17
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:51,360
Livers. Odengo Otama offered Flask Fiction, which has a good alliterative ring to it.

18
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,960
But again, it was like our focus group of one didn't get the pun. But the thing is,

19
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,560
you don't have to get the pun to get that. It includes booze and fiction. That is absolutely

20
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,240
true. So I like it. Which is in contrast to my personal favorite, courtesy of Ronka, which

21
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:18,020
was The Lush Pile, which is of course a take on the term slush pile, which is, for those

22
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,520
of you who don't know, because apparently most people don't, is just the term that they

23
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,780
use for any group of unsolicited manuscripts. It's considered a slush pile. It doesn't mean

24
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:34,460
they're being rejected, it just means they're unsolicited and probably unagented. So I like

25
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:41,780
that a lot because it includes the word lush, and it's kind of funny. But people don't seem

26
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,380
to know what a slush pile is, so that's a problem. Other finalists for the choosing

27
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:55,380
was one from Morgan, Spirited Discussions. Yeah, that one gets to kind of the heart of

28
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:02,940
the matter, but it's much more sedate. It's not very oomph-y. Despair suggested Cosmopolitan,

29
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:10,540
and then boom. Like, done. I wrote it down because I think I liked the boom. I thought

30
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,860
that you were just like, this is it. No, that was not my boom. Okay. Elliott Hochberg gave

31
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:25,980
us 451 proof. Lachlan Cartland offered us first draft, which I really like. Spelled

32
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:37,420
like, yeah, like, like, not, not, not, not, yeah, not, um, and I also offered pros and

33
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:45,580
cons. Clever girl. Yeah, I like that first one, first draft. Becca M, she gave us top

34
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:51,100
shelf, which I like a lot, except for I think that might be too classy. Yeah, that is really

35
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,900
I mean, we make effort cocktails. Yeah, yeah, this is, this is like the rare time when we

36
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:01,100
effort, but we ourselves are not classy. We say words like, like, fuck, and motherfucker,

37
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:08,620
and this fucking sucks. Pabaradactyl suggested Booze Your Own Adventure, which might be the

38
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:17,340
most appropriate. I know. In a way. I kind of really like that one. Yeah, so there you go. I

39
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:23,900
mean, like, it might be a little too kitty, but at the same time, it totally works because that's

40
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:29,580
exactly, that's, that's what we do. That is exactly what we do. So, uh, but once again,

41
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,340
we look forward to your, uh, what you vote on.

42
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,420
So basically we're going to do this every other week. We're going to do one episode talking about

43
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,420
the Viridian saga, and another episode we'll do a review, so it'll be like one, two, one, two,

44
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,620
and that's, you know, how we're going to do it for the foreseeable future. Shake it off. Yep.

45
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:57,900
So the discussion about, uh, Awoken Book Two centered largely around, um, this idea of

46
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:04,460
dystopia parody versus what our original idea was, which was more a parody of Tiger's Curse,

47
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:11,820
because it inspired us so much. It just reached down the macadamals of my heart. It just reached

48
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:17,340
down your throat. Squeeze and squeeze and said cry uncle and I said uncle uncle and it said I

49
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:23,820
lied. So we wanted to do that because it was funny, but at the same time, since we are trying

50
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,500
to do topical parodies, sort of, I think, you know, dystopia is much more of a thing than

51
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,620
Tiger's Curse. Yeah. But that's not to say that, like, the idea of the white savior

52
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:41,260
is not a thing, and we cannot, yeah, we might be able to marry these two, so that's what we're

53
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:47,420
gonna, um, talk about today. We got entitled. Well, our original idea was going to be Awoken,

54
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,820
Arisen, and Aliven. We're going to be the third one. I'm kind of wondering if, like, maybe,

55
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:58,060
because I like the idea of another being the third one, like, another. Here's what I like about the

56
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,860
idea of another being the second one, because it's the new moon, and it's, that's where, like,

57
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:11,660
the triangle begins. So, another romantic interest. Glenn did point out that the title

58
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,620
Another is kind of different stylistically, because Awoken is so what a YA book would be

59
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,500
called, and Another is maybe too far, but we'll see. Although I really do like the idea of Aliven.

60
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,540
I mean, I'm not married to it, but I kind of want to keep it in there somewhere. I'm just saying

61
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:32,060
that. Awoken, Aliven, and Another. Sarah Jessness has always gave us a couple good ideas. Firstly,

62
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,540
the idea that the bad parts of the dystopian society should be things that would relate

63
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,580
directly to Sarah's personal life, rather than large political issues. Yeah. Well, because we

64
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:48,300
have to completely miss the point of dystopian, totalitarian things. It can't be about grand,

65
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,420
overarching destruction of society. No, it's about what affects me. I think that could be the build

66
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:59,980
up for the dystopian matriarchy. The matriarchy? Yeah, run by Scarlet. I really like this idea of,

67
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:05,660
like, the dystopian matriarchy run by Scarlet. No, it's like the Wonder Woman Amazons only,

68
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,780
like, evil. Yeah, and really hot. And Sarah, of course. But they're not really hot. We find that

69
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:16,780
out at the end of the second book, that Scarlet was ugly the whole time, just like in Cinder.

70
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,660
Sorry, Cinder, you're getting parodied. Sorry. We still enjoyed you. Yeah, we liked you, but

71
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:29,980
that Evil Queen, man. That Evil Queen. No, the veil hides her mustache. Baker JS.

72
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,980
As a contrast, I really like the idea of a new law called the Available Healthcare Act.

73
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,980
And Marianne Stein, who has nothing to do with Marianne Ellenson,

74
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:49,340
that, yeah, we should maybe include that political everything, because Sarah, you know,

75
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:56,460
is definitely going to have a but me attitude on how politics work. Also, this idea, like,

76
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:02,540
the way Stephanie Meyer refers to herself as a feminist, or at least as pro-woman. Right. Which

77
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,220
I find very interesting, and this is where it starts to take, like, it starts to dangerously

78
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:13,180
tiptoe over into really condescending territory. Yeah. Because I think she means it, and I think

79
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:20,620
she's trying to do right by women. She was just, you know, raised in this society and this culture

80
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:28,300
where the idea of, like, what women should be and should do is just so not, like, our effete New

81
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:34,780
York, you know, liberal, I need no man, you know, attitude. I think a lot of people who are raised

82
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:39,340
in very conservative Christian backgrounds, or even just conservative backgrounds in general,

83
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:45,900
struggle with that. And try to make a place for, I can be a powerful strong woman and still be a

84
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:51,180
woman from, and what I was taught a woman is. Yeah. I think there, well, especially with young

85
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,620
adult authors. Many of them come from that kind of background. Yeah, a lot of them come from a

86
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,540
really strong religious background that they feel really attached to, and so they have this difficult

87
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:05,580
time kind of reconciling this, you know, modern, I need no man, versus what it means to be a good

88
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:13,580
woman, a moral woman, you know, what you would want your kids to look up to. Aryan Librarian says

89
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,900
it's got to be religious freedom, right? That's got to be the thing. And also maybe love has been

90
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:23,660
outlawed, which has been done in a book called Delirium, which I'm kind of afraid to read because

91
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,580
that sounds like the dumbest thing ever. Well, I think we're gonna have to, though. If we end up

92
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:32,700
going, like, oh no, not love. Well, think, I mean, but that can, that's the love and the eat, pray, love.

93
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:43,340
Prayer has been outlawed. Eating has been... Organified. Oh no! Like, everyone's been sent to small

94
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:49,180
communal farms. Yeah. Which is terrible. And love is... Like, I just want my fucking McDonald's. Maybe, yeah.

95
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:54,300
I just want my fucking McDonald's. Why are you making me eat this, like, homegrown organic shit?

96
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:59,340
What the fuck's a victory garden without my lawn? And love's been outlawed. Yeah, and also love's been

97
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:04,460
outlawed because that's what happens. So we have to outsource to India. We keep saying, like, we gotta

98
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:13,340
go to India, man. We have to go to India. So our original idea, after Awoken was done, was playing

99
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:21,420
off of this idea of the Tiger's Curse parody. We were going to do, of course, New Moon, Riley Dumpster,

100
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:29,500
again. But then a plot thing happens, and Uncle Neil is like, oh no, Vic, or Ethnic Third Wheel,

101
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:37,260
he's the 10th Avatar of Vishnu. Whoopsie. And so then we go to India, and she has her big eat, pray,

102
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,420
love journey where, you know, somehow or other we find out that she's the special because, you know,

103
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:48,380
white women, we're all white women at. And at the end, I think we find out that he wasn't actually

104
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,860
the 10th Avatar. He's not actually Kalki, the 10th Avatar of Vishnu. He was, like, something that

105
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:58,220
Loki did, and we bring in, like, Loki, but it's, like, just Marvel. No, it's just Tom Hiddleston.

106
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,580
It's just Tom Hiddleston. Like, he keeps quoting Avengers. He's always burdened with glorious

107
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:12,220
something. And, you know, but then the world does end. But it's, it's, it's, it's not, it's reborn.

108
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,460
Yeah, yeah. The old world ends, the new one's reborn, and then Uncle Neil shows up with, oh no,

109
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:20,620
everything's okay. It's just we had to get rid of Thursday. Get rid of what? Oh, you see,

110
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,220
he didn't even miss it. No one could get the hang of Thursday. Yeah, exactly. That was our original

111
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:31,900
idea. So now it's, like, the question of, like, do we discard this all together, or do we try to

112
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:38,540
marry this in some way with this dystopia? The white savior goes to India, and it's also a

113
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,860
dystopia somehow. I mean, we figured out why Cthulhu goes to high school. I don't know. I don't

114
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:48,060
see why we can't marry these two ideas. I'm up for the challenge. But, yeah, I'm really digging

115
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,500
this idea of this Eat, Pray, Love actually referring to, like, eating spin-out-lot, praying

116
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,860
spin-out-lot, love spin-out-lot. Hey, I know you like those big gulp sodas, but this is American

117
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:09,660
now, buddy. We don't allow that no more. No, no! I poured it out, no! This is like prohibition all

118
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,740
over again. It's like, and then they had, like, the soda just, like, a shot glass.

119
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:21,500
You have the soda bootleggers. Like, the corner bars. The underground, and they're allowed to love

120
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:26,780
and drink soda. I really like it. Okay, we gotta do the soda thing. Yeah, no, we have to do the soda

121
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:32,380
thing. The totalitarian dystopia work. Because the matriarchy has to stay hot. That's why they

122
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,860
have on soda. Yeah, because they only drink seltzer. I think the president should be

123
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:49,100
McBlue Mixon. No, he's, like, Obam-Bloomburg. Obamberg. No, Bloombito. Bloombito.

124
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,860
She's never even been to New York, but you know we're gonna, come on, we need to have Bloombito.

125
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:02,460
President Bloombito. Somehow it's Vince Scarlet the whole time. That's the twist. She's the first

126
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:09,740
lady. Yeah. She brainwashes him and marries him. Women. Because women am I right? Women, am I right?

127
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:14,700
God. She's pretty much Robin, right? In House of Cards. Only she doesn't have Frank Underwood.

128
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:20,220
Yeah, only, like, President Bloombito is just, like, whatever you say, hot wife. Yeah. Because

129
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,380
that's how, that is how women accrue power, by being hot. So anyway, that's, that's our challenge

130
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:29,660
for this week. Marrying this, like, white savior eat, pray, love thing, where we go to India and

131
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:38,060
have to save the day, to the whole dystopia, trying to keep it within the whole topical parody

132
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,060
thing. Next week, a week from now, you know how bad I am at keeping a schedule, but I'm trying to

133
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:49,100
update on Mondays. We'll be doing Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs.

134
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,780
In the meantime, please help us brainstorm at shayapocalypse.com in the comments. Make it easy.

135
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:58,300
Make it easy for us in the comments. Just comment there. That's where we go.
