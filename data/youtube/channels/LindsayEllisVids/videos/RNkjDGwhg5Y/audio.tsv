0	8960	So welcome back to Show of Almost Being Renamed. We're almost there, guys. We're almost there.
8960	15560	We're almost there. I promise, I'm not. We'll keep dragging it out. Final episode. Never
15560	21400	have to commit. No, no, no. We have to save it to episode 9. Yeah, that's when everything
21400	26700	happens. Well, fuck Rubble. We're on 4 of season 2, so jesus. Yeah, this isn't really
26700	35420	Tyrell-inspired, but I found it and it sounded good. Yeah. So it's got gin. It's got a lavender
35420	41500	and sage-infused white vermouth. This is what we like to call an effort cocktail. It has
41500	46140	gin in it. It's worth it. Yeah, it's gotta be worth it. It's got really, really expensive
46140	54940	gin. But since this is a booze and books show, that expensive gin is a tax write-off. Cheers!
54940	57660	So here's what happened last week, or the show that aired last week, which we shot like
57660	63880	two weeks ago. We had decided on a title, which will be one of the finals we're about
63880	71400	to mention, and after testing it with a few people, realized that these publishing terms
71400	79760	that we throw around are not generally known to the populace, even writers, which surprised
79760	85540	me quite a bit. So we decided maybe we don't have this in the bag, and we'll take it back
85540	90160	to you! Yeah, we'll announce some finalists and see how it rolls. This one is not a finalist,
90160	96820	but I thought it was funny. Winged Beast called it Hemingway Outsourcing, which is
96820	102780	completely appropriate, because we do the drinking, you do the writing. Hey! Distended
102780	111360	Livers. Odengo Otama offered Flask Fiction, which has a good alliterative ring to it.
111360	117960	But again, it was like our focus group of one didn't get the pun. But the thing is,
117960	123560	you don't have to get the pun to get that. It includes booze and fiction. That is absolutely
123560	129240	true. So I like it. Which is in contrast to my personal favorite, courtesy of Ronka, which
129240	138020	was The Lush Pile, which is of course a take on the term slush pile, which is, for those
138020	143520	of you who don't know, because apparently most people don't, is just the term that they
143520	148780	use for any group of unsolicited manuscripts. It's considered a slush pile. It doesn't mean
148780	154460	they're being rejected, it just means they're unsolicited and probably unagented. So I like
154460	161780	that a lot because it includes the word lush, and it's kind of funny. But people don't seem
161780	167380	to know what a slush pile is, so that's a problem. Other finalists for the choosing
167380	175380	was one from Morgan, Spirited Discussions. Yeah, that one gets to kind of the heart of
175380	182940	the matter, but it's much more sedate. It's not very oomph-y. Despair suggested Cosmopolitan,
183420	190540	and then boom. Like, done. I wrote it down because I think I liked the boom. I thought
190540	196860	that you were just like, this is it. No, that was not my boom. Okay. Elliott Hochberg gave
196860	205980	us 451 proof. Lachlan Cartland offered us first draft, which I really like. Spelled
205980	217420	like, yeah, like, like, not, not, not, not, yeah, not, um, and I also offered pros and
217420	225580	cons. Clever girl. Yeah, I like that first one, first draft. Becca M, she gave us top
225580	231100	shelf, which I like a lot, except for I think that might be too classy. Yeah, that is really
231660	235900	I mean, we make effort cocktails. Yeah, yeah, this is, this is like the rare time when we
235900	241100	effort, but we ourselves are not classy. We say words like, like, fuck, and motherfucker,
241100	248620	and this fucking sucks. Pabaradactyl suggested Booze Your Own Adventure, which might be the
248620	257340	most appropriate. I know. In a way. I kind of really like that one. Yeah, so there you go. I
257340	263900	mean, like, it might be a little too kitty, but at the same time, it totally works because that's
263900	269580	exactly, that's, that's what we do. That is exactly what we do. So, uh, but once again,
269580	273340	we look forward to your, uh, what you vote on.
279660	283420	So basically we're going to do this every other week. We're going to do one episode talking about
283420	287420	the Viridian saga, and another episode we'll do a review, so it'll be like one, two, one, two,
287420	290620	and that's, you know, how we're going to do it for the foreseeable future. Shake it off. Yep.
290620	297900	So the discussion about, uh, Awoken Book Two centered largely around, um, this idea of
297900	304460	dystopia parody versus what our original idea was, which was more a parody of Tiger's Curse,
305420	311820	because it inspired us so much. It just reached down the macadamals of my heart. It just reached
311820	317340	down your throat. Squeeze and squeeze and said cry uncle and I said uncle uncle and it said I
317340	323820	lied. So we wanted to do that because it was funny, but at the same time, since we are trying
323820	329500	to do topical parodies, sort of, I think, you know, dystopia is much more of a thing than
330140	334620	Tiger's Curse. Yeah. But that's not to say that, like, the idea of the white savior
335500	341260	is not a thing, and we cannot, yeah, we might be able to marry these two, so that's what we're
341260	347420	gonna, um, talk about today. We got entitled. Well, our original idea was going to be Awoken,
347420	351820	Arisen, and Aliven. We're going to be the third one. I'm kind of wondering if, like, maybe,
352540	358060	because I like the idea of another being the third one, like, another. Here's what I like about the
358060	362860	idea of another being the second one, because it's the new moon, and it's, that's where, like,
362860	371660	the triangle begins. So, another romantic interest. Glenn did point out that the title
371660	376620	Another is kind of different stylistically, because Awoken is so what a YA book would be
376620	381500	called, and Another is maybe too far, but we'll see. Although I really do like the idea of Aliven.
383100	386540	I mean, I'm not married to it, but I kind of want to keep it in there somewhere. I'm just saying
386540	392060	that. Awoken, Aliven, and Another. Sarah Jessness has always gave us a couple good ideas. Firstly,
392060	396540	the idea that the bad parts of the dystopian society should be things that would relate
396540	401580	directly to Sarah's personal life, rather than large political issues. Yeah. Well, because we
401580	408300	have to completely miss the point of dystopian, totalitarian things. It can't be about grand,
408300	413420	overarching destruction of society. No, it's about what affects me. I think that could be the build
413420	419980	up for the dystopian matriarchy. The matriarchy? Yeah, run by Scarlet. I really like this idea of,
419980	425660	like, the dystopian matriarchy run by Scarlet. No, it's like the Wonder Woman Amazons only,
425660	430780	like, evil. Yeah, and really hot. And Sarah, of course. But they're not really hot. We find that
430780	436780	out at the end of the second book, that Scarlet was ugly the whole time, just like in Cinder.
436780	441660	Sorry, Cinder, you're getting parodied. Sorry. We still enjoyed you. Yeah, we liked you, but
441900	449980	that Evil Queen, man. That Evil Queen. No, the veil hides her mustache. Baker JS.
450860	455980	As a contrast, I really like the idea of a new law called the Available Healthcare Act.
459340	463980	And Marianne Stein, who has nothing to do with Marianne Ellenson,
463980	469340	that, yeah, we should maybe include that political everything, because Sarah, you know,
469340	476460	is definitely going to have a but me attitude on how politics work. Also, this idea, like,
476460	482540	the way Stephanie Meyer refers to herself as a feminist, or at least as pro-woman. Right. Which
482540	486220	I find very interesting, and this is where it starts to take, like, it starts to dangerously
486220	493180	tiptoe over into really condescending territory. Yeah. Because I think she means it, and I think
493180	500620	she's trying to do right by women. She was just, you know, raised in this society and this culture
500620	508300	where the idea of, like, what women should be and should do is just so not, like, our effete New
508300	514780	York, you know, liberal, I need no man, you know, attitude. I think a lot of people who are raised
514780	519340	in very conservative Christian backgrounds, or even just conservative backgrounds in general,
519340	525900	struggle with that. And try to make a place for, I can be a powerful strong woman and still be a
525900	531180	woman from, and what I was taught a woman is. Yeah. I think there, well, especially with young
531180	534620	adult authors. Many of them come from that kind of background. Yeah, a lot of them come from a
534620	538540	really strong religious background that they feel really attached to, and so they have this difficult
538540	545580	time kind of reconciling this, you know, modern, I need no man, versus what it means to be a good
545580	553580	woman, a moral woman, you know, what you would want your kids to look up to. Aryan Librarian says
553580	557900	it's got to be religious freedom, right? That's got to be the thing. And also maybe love has been
557900	563660	outlawed, which has been done in a book called Delirium, which I'm kind of afraid to read because
563660	567580	that sounds like the dumbest thing ever. Well, I think we're gonna have to, though. If we end up
567580	572700	going, like, oh no, not love. Well, think, I mean, but that can, that's the love and the eat, pray, love.
572700	583340	Prayer has been outlawed. Eating has been... Organified. Oh no! Like, everyone's been sent to small
583340	589180	communal farms. Yeah. Which is terrible. And love is... Like, I just want my fucking McDonald's. Maybe, yeah.
589180	594300	I just want my fucking McDonald's. Why are you making me eat this, like, homegrown organic shit?
594300	599340	What the fuck's a victory garden without my lawn? And love's been outlawed. Yeah, and also love's been
599340	604460	outlawed because that's what happens. So we have to outsource to India. We keep saying, like, we gotta
604460	613340	go to India, man. We have to go to India. So our original idea, after Awoken was done, was playing
613340	621420	off of this idea of the Tiger's Curse parody. We were going to do, of course, New Moon, Riley Dumpster,
621420	629500	again. But then a plot thing happens, and Uncle Neil is like, oh no, Vic, or Ethnic Third Wheel,
629500	637260	he's the 10th Avatar of Vishnu. Whoopsie. And so then we go to India, and she has her big eat, pray,
637260	641420	love journey where, you know, somehow or other we find out that she's the special because, you know,
641420	648380	white women, we're all white women at. And at the end, I think we find out that he wasn't actually
648380	652860	the 10th Avatar. He's not actually Kalki, the 10th Avatar of Vishnu. He was, like, something that
652860	658220	Loki did, and we bring in, like, Loki, but it's, like, just Marvel. No, it's just Tom Hiddleston.
658220	663580	It's just Tom Hiddleston. Like, he keeps quoting Avengers. He's always burdened with glorious
663580	672220	something. And, you know, but then the world does end. But it's, it's, it's, it's not, it's reborn.
672220	676460	Yeah, yeah. The old world ends, the new one's reborn, and then Uncle Neil shows up with, oh no,
676460	680620	everything's okay. It's just we had to get rid of Thursday. Get rid of what? Oh, you see,
680620	684220	he didn't even miss it. No one could get the hang of Thursday. Yeah, exactly. That was our original
684220	691900	idea. So now it's, like, the question of, like, do we discard this all together, or do we try to
691900	698540	marry this in some way with this dystopia? The white savior goes to India, and it's also a
698540	702860	dystopia somehow. I mean, we figured out why Cthulhu goes to high school. I don't know. I don't
702860	708060	see why we can't marry these two ideas. I'm up for the challenge. But, yeah, I'm really digging
708060	713500	this idea of this Eat, Pray, Love actually referring to, like, eating spin-out-lot, praying
713500	718860	spin-out-lot, love spin-out-lot. Hey, I know you like those big gulp sodas, but this is American
718860	729660	now, buddy. We don't allow that no more. No, no! I poured it out, no! This is like prohibition all
729820	733740	over again. It's like, and then they had, like, the soda just, like, a shot glass.
735500	741500	You have the soda bootleggers. Like, the corner bars. The underground, and they're allowed to love
741500	746780	and drink soda. I really like it. Okay, we gotta do the soda thing. Yeah, no, we have to do the soda
746780	752380	thing. The totalitarian dystopia work. Because the matriarchy has to stay hot. That's why they
752380	756860	have on soda. Yeah, because they only drink seltzer. I think the president should be
757580	769100	McBlue Mixon. No, he's, like, Obam-Bloomburg. Obamberg. No, Bloombito. Bloombito.
769100	774860	She's never even been to New York, but you know we're gonna, come on, we need to have Bloombito.
776220	782460	President Bloombito. Somehow it's Vince Scarlet the whole time. That's the twist. She's the first
782460	789740	lady. Yeah. She brainwashes him and marries him. Women. Because women am I right? Women, am I right?
789740	794700	God. She's pretty much Robin, right? In House of Cards. Only she doesn't have Frank Underwood.
794700	800220	Yeah, only, like, President Bloombito is just, like, whatever you say, hot wife. Yeah. Because
800220	804380	that's how, that is how women accrue power, by being hot. So anyway, that's, that's our challenge
804380	809660	for this week. Marrying this, like, white savior eat, pray, love thing, where we go to India and
809660	818060	have to save the day, to the whole dystopia, trying to keep it within the whole topical parody
818060	822060	thing. Next week, a week from now, you know how bad I am at keeping a schedule, but I'm trying to
822060	829100	update on Mondays. We'll be doing Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs.
829100	834780	In the meantime, please help us brainstorm at shayapocalypse.com in the comments. Make it easy.
834780	838300	Make it easy for us in the comments. Just comment there. That's where we go.
838940	844460	Trying to sort of collect comments from all other places. Yeah, that's hard. And of course,
844460	847580	be our friend on Goodreads, where we will, you know, talk things, and you can also give
847580	855900	us book recommendations there. I like this drink. Another! I would do the thing, but I'm pretty sure
855900	861020	this is, like, maybe their last two of these styles, so. Oh, right, yeah. Another!
