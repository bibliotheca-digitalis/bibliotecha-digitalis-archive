11160	13960	lays the chromium nerves of plumbing raw.
13960	16480	Such poverty assaults the ego.

58400	63000	Cultural milestones come and go, but every now and then, we are privileged enough to
63000	71800	experience something so profound and important, it not only defines a generation, it changes
71800	72920	the world.
72920	77120	And right now, in the era of new media, creative for streaming, online video that is still
77120	86840	beginning to define its own identity, we can clearly pinpoint the apotheosis of generation
86840	94600	defining web series, which intersects altruism, accessibility, technical skill, and philosophy.
94600	101800	I'm talking, of course, about the YouTube series How to Cake It with Yolanda Gump.
101800	105280	During the course of an episode of How to Cake It, Yolanda challenges herself with the
105280	109980	creation of a novelty cake, usually in the shape of a real-life object, often a tie-in
109980	120520	with a relevant pop culture artifact that she has obviously never seen, and usually
120520	130520	draped in fondant, the most disgusting foodstuff man has yet cruelly devised.
130520	133320	A typical How to Cake It episode goes as follows.
133320	145840	First, Yolanda bakes her cake, usually double-digit pounds of it, then she soaks the cake in simple
145840	150000	syrup from her tool, which her commenters have named Sir Squeeze-A-Lot, Sir Squeeze
150000	151000	for short.
151000	153440	You can buy your very own Sir Squeeze at her website.
153440	160480	Then she begins to ice the cake, before promoting her paid service, Camp Cake, where you can
160480	163320	bake and decorate a cake with Yolanda in real time.
163320	168280	Then she carves the cake into the right shape, while asking a question for you to leave a
168280	171840	comment, which will up engagement and be more favorable to YouTube's algorithm.
171840	183940	Then she crumb coats and chills the cake, before mentioning her t-shirt club, asking
183940	188540	for shares, promoting her second channel, and then removing the chilled cake to do the
188540	190000	final icing.
190000	193520	Then she mentions her monthly sprinkle service, which you can subscribe to.
193520	197160	Then she drapes her cake in the horrible, horrible fondant, before then reminding you
197160	201560	to subscribe to the channel if you haven't, then the decoration begins.
201560	205160	After which she reminds you that you can buy more of her merchandise at her website.
205160	209720	And during the hours of meticulous decorating, she also reminds the viewer to buy her book.
209720	213560	A tactic which only a sucker would fall for.
213560	219360	As of August 2018, How to Cake It has amassed 3.8 million subscribers in about three years.
219360	223480	And in that three years, the show has grown from one or two calls to action within a given
223480	227440	episode to on average, eleven calls to action in an episode.
227440	231160	Your average episode of How to Cake It is almost more call to action than it is cake
231160	232440	making at this point.
232440	237200	For those of you who are not hep to the lingo, or who have never had a social media manager
237200	242040	of some sort, a call to action is where, in the content of a video, the host asks the
242040	247460	viewer to do engagement with the content, in a more active way than just sitting on
247460	249780	your ass for 11-17 minutes.
249780	259600	This can be as small as asking me for you to smash that like button, or to ask for shares,
259600	264600	or suggesting that you use my URL to go build your own beautiful Squarespace website.
264600	267320	Calls to action are somewhat unique to online media.
267320	272160	If you're hosting a cooking show on Food Network, you can't exactly ask someone to leave a comment
272160	274160	on their cable channel.
274160	277160	I mean, I guess you can, but...
277160	280360	But calls to action are not completely unique to online media.
280360	284600	One key to the popularity of RuPaul's Drag Race is their prevalence on social media,
284600	287880	which is not only encouraged by RuPaul soliciting calls to action,
287880	293080	I want to hear from you, the fans, who do you think deserves the crown?
293080	295720	Are you Team Aquaria?
295720	296720	Team Asia?
296720	300360	but by the structure of its show lending itself to easy sharing.
300360	301360	Not today, Satan.
301360	302360	I'll be thirsty, bitch.
302360	303360	Miss Vanjie.
303360	304360	Miss Vanjie.
304360	305360	Miss Vanjie.
305360	313120	The secret to Yolanda's success is not, of course, the calls to action.
313120	315800	Those gradually rose as her subscriber count did.
315800	319560	If you look at earlier episodes of How to Cake It, you see that there are very few calls
319560	324440	to action, and most of them are requests for likes and subscribes, with subscription services,
324440	328520	merchandise, and camp cake being gradually added through the years and months.
328520	331880	Early episodes are actually very conventional, and more in the vein of your typical Food
331880	332920	Network show.
332920	337320	But about five months after the channel launched, in the Flower Pot of Cake episode published
337320	341520	on May 5th, 2015, a new element is introduced.
341520	348400	Then I measure, then I measure the circumference, do I look tired?
348400	349400	No.
349400	350400	Circumference.
350400	355240	The giggle you hear is the voice of producer Jocelyn Mercer, and her presence in the series,
355240	360240	interacting with Yolanda from offscreen, only increases from here, to the point where now,
360240	361240	it's a feature of the show.
361240	362240	Why are they called gym leaders?
362240	367760	I guess they're actually like in gyms, and then so you work your way through the gym.
367760	370120	So it's a workout game.
370120	373460	This element proves engaging, and in the following months, there's a correlation
373460	377120	of increased interaction between the production crew and the host.
377120	380720	In effect, Yolanda breaks down the facade that is production.
380720	383360	She jokes with her producers, she jokes with her cameramen.
383360	388000	Are Americans going to get mad at this?
388000	391080	Sometimes she even jokes with her editor, who is not in the room.
391080	394720	The series went from the occasional fourth wall breaks, to fourth wall breaks being a
394720	395720	part of the show's identity.
395720	396720	Ooh, that's a good one, yo.
396720	403440	Just, if you could just pull that, yeah, yeah, perfect.
403440	407600	Yolanda and her producers have effectively figured out not only how to market a curated
407600	411840	version of her personality, but with how she interacts with her crew.
411840	416120	I don't think they're as technique as the finishers, but they definitely have pins.
416120	419160	And the interactions with the crew make the show feel more authentic.
419160	422560	You feel like you're just, you know, in the room, hanging out, laughing about this
422560	424680	elaborate cake that looks like a giant turkey.
424680	427760	Now pop your turkey cake in the fridge.
427760	429840	I'm doing way too much of this.
429840	433600	This falls into line with the appeal of YouTube in general, that it strips away the polished
433600	436560	facade of television to give you something more real.
436560	439240	We should send every rapper a newsletter without this info.
439240	440640	Just use the same word, guys.
440640	442560	Just use the same word.
442560	444920	Every sentence in the song ends with the same word.
444920	449440	Yolanda can get away with her 11,000 calls to action per episode, not in spite of this
449440	452240	fourth wall breaking format, but because of it.
452240	456720	Owning the fact that a polished production like this is in fact a group effort, this
456720	457720	isn't just a show.
457720	460400	You know, we're just hanging out, laughing about this cake.
460400	461680	We're just having fun.
461680	463840	You must chill this cake.
463840	465360	Thine must chill.
465360	469400	I don't know if it's thine.
469400	470400	I don't know.
470400	472040	To be clear, this is not a call out.
472040	476400	How to Cake It has a clear and effective business model, and Yolanda Gomp is both an engaging
476400	480280	personality and a talented artist with fondant.
480320	483880	I do find the calls to action distracting, but I loyally watch every episode of How to
483880	488720	Cake It, and yes, I own her goddamn book, and no, I have not attempted to make a single
488720	490600	one of these cakes.
490600	495400	But there is something special, innovative, dare I say, lucrative, in the style and format
495400	498000	Yolanda and her colleagues have devised.
498000	501280	And other companies have begun to take notice.
501280	517120	The medium is the message.
517120	522720	YouTube was founded in 2005 by three former PayPal employees, Chad Hurley, Steve Chen,
522720	524240	and Jawad Kareem.
524240	528400	The idea for YouTube in part was inspired by Jawad Kareem's difficulty in finding and
528400	532720	watching videos online of Janet Jackson having her tit exposed by Justin Timberlake during
532720	534520	the Super Bowl halftime show.
534520	540600	Based on a failed prior project, a video dating site called TuneInHookUp, by February of 2005,
540600	545280	the trio had agreed to set work on the YouTube project, with Chen and Kareem taking technical
545280	549080	duties and Hurley taking on a managerial-slash-administrative role.
549080	553840	In April of 2005, the very first video was uploaded to YouTube, a video of Jawad hanging
553840	554840	out at a zoo.
554840	562840	The cool thing about these guys is that they have really, really, really long trunks.
562840	566560	And no one ever wanted for videos of wardrobe malfunctions ever again.
566560	569240	And that's pretty much all there is to say.
569240	571840	So what does YouTube offer as a medium?
571840	576480	Arguably, YouTube offers anything you want, but the platform specializes in certain niches
576480	579960	that flourish on this platform more than they do elsewhere.
579960	590960	TV blogs, makeup tutorials, video games, Screamer, Adder, and DIY channels make up
590960	593280	a huge percentage of successful channels.
593280	597520	But the form that both originated and flourished on the format and remains the most popular
597520	599600	are the slice-of-life bloggers.
599600	604680	To this day, the biggest channels on the platform, with the likes of Logan Paul and PewDiePie,
604680	609040	even if they specialize in a subcategory like video games, are, in effect, slice-of-life
609040	610040	bloggers.
610040	614520	Fundamentally, YouTube lifts the barrier between the content creator and the viewer.
614520	618680	Decades prior, television had come into people's homes and given us the likes of news anchors
618680	622840	and late-night talk show hosts to provide a friendly public figure, a personality that
622840	627640	people find recognizable, relatable, and also a bridge to the world of celebrity.
627640	629760	But with YouTube, we strip away the artifice.
629760	633960	Indeed, even in the name of the platform, the person uploading the video controls what
633960	635760	goes on on their channel.
635760	638000	YouTube is the medium of authenticity.
638000	642160	Someone simply records a video, edits it as they please, and uploads it to their millions
642160	643160	of subscribers.
643160	644160	No middlemen.
644160	648240	YouTube is the response to the demand of a younger audience, hungry for what they consider
648240	650120	authentic.
650120	654040	And because of this perceived authenticity, audiences give a great deal more latitude
654040	655640	with the sale of certain things.
655640	659280	For instance, sprinkle services and t-shirt clubs.
659280	661800	This observation was brought to you by Squarespace.
661800	665400	With Squarespace, you can design a beautiful website designed by professionals that know
665400	666800	what they're doing.
666800	667800	Not like me.
667800	671520	But even from the beginning, there are blurred lines between slice-of-life daily vlogs and
671520	672920	authentic fiction.
672920	676800	One of the earliest breakthrough channels was LonelyGirl15, which launched in the summer
676800	681280	of 2006 and was, for a time, the most-subscribed channel on YouTube.
681280	688160	Anyway, so Daniel is really mad right now, and I don't know if he'll be allowed to come
688160	689160	over anymore.
689160	693960	The series initially presented as an authentic YouTube video diary, but gained even more notoriety
694160	698160	when it was outed as being completely fictional in September of the same year.
698160	702120	It is noteworthy that the big controversy around LonelyGirl15 was the revelation that
702120	707240	LonelyGirl15 was, in fact, an actress, and that her daily vlogs were fictional and completely
707240	708680	fabricated.
708680	712840	Part of the appeal of YouTube is its perceived authenticity, but even if there is no network
712840	717480	or middleman, everything that is uploaded to YouTube is cultivated by the creator.
717480	721120	And is it fair, therefore, to say that what LonelyGirl15 is trying to sell you is any
721120	724640	less authentic than Logan Paul?
728640	736000	I guess what I wanted to ask you was why you decided to be a YouTuber.
736000	738080	I didn't decide to be a YouTuber.
738080	739640	Does anyone?
739640	741920	I didn't decide to be a YouTuber.
741920	743400	It just called to you?
743400	746600	Well, there wasn't, no, there was, like, there were no YouTubers.
746600	747800	It was 2007.
747800	749760	There wasn't a such thing as a YouTuber.
749760	750760	So here's a question.
750760	756080	Do you, okay, so, like, the stuff you're supposed to do, like, calls to action, and do you ever
756080	759000	consciously, like, incorporate stuff like that, like stuff that's supposed to improve
759000	760000	metrics?
760000	761000	No.
761000	764960	I mean, the things that I do to improve metrics are, like, a good title and a good thumbnail,
764960	766280	and I don't think beyond that.
766280	771320	Like, the algorithm changes too much for my old man self to be trying to keep up with
771320	772320	it.
772320	776560	But no, I mean, I do calls to action because I want, when I want somebody to take an action.
776560	779920	I do calls to action when PBS tells me what to say.
779920	780920	Yeah.
780920	781920	Yeah.
781920	785120	And it's like, someone on Twitter actually, like, called me out on that.
785120	788720	They were like, it's weird hearing you do a call to action.
788720	789720	It's very not on-brand.
789720	793440	And I'm like, uh, yep, yeah, you're right, you're right.
793440	794440	Influencer culture.
794440	795440	I hate that term.
795440	796440	Yeah.
796440	797440	I hate everything about it.
797440	801040	Both of those words are, mean nothing.
801040	807160	I think that you could see Squarespace.com slash Dear Hank.
807160	811000	No, I, yeah, no, this, this video is going to be sponsored by Squarespace if they clear
811000	812000	it.
812000	813000	Okay.
813000	814000	This video where I'm highly critical of influencer culture.
814000	819560	Hey, I, like, if, if you're going to influence people to do something, like, you know, if
819560	824160	you're going to have a website, you might as well use Squarespace.
824160	825160	That's their, that's their new motto.
825160	826160	You know what?
826160	827160	Just fucking do it.
827160	828160	Just stop.
828160	829160	Squarespace.
829160	830520	Just fucking do it.
830520	833360	Don't try to be all fancy and shit.
833360	834360	You don't know what you're doing.
834360	835360	Just get a Squarespace.
835360	836360	Come on.
836360	839280	Um, it's good.
839280	840280	We're really good at this.
840280	843840	The medium is the message.
843840	848560	See, I forgot his first name, Marshall.
848560	850520	The medium is the message.
850520	852520	Marshall McLuhan, 1960.
852520	853520	What?
853520	854520	McLuhan.
854520	855520	McLuhan?
855520	856520	Yeah.
856520	866640	Around when Yolanda Gomp started using the joshing with producers gimmick, her sub started
866640	868440	going way, way up.
868440	871880	And by mid-2016, she's well past a million subscribers.
871880	877880	And around this time, on July 26, 2016, venture capital-funded startup Craftsy began publishing
877880	881320	the first episode of their own cake show.
881320	884680	Sometimes you need more than just to know how to cake it.
884680	888480	Sometimes you need a man about cake.
888480	891040	Hey guys, welcome to Man About Cake.
891040	895240	Craftsy was a startup service that specialized in hobby and lifestyle tutorials and craft
895240	899840	education that was launched in 2011 by a bunch of former eBay executives.
899840	903560	One of the contributors who featured in content behind this paywall was pastry chef and sugar
903560	905280	artist Joshua John Russell.
905280	909880	I want your stencil resting against your cake board to help make sure it doesn't shift around.
909880	913000	who began starring in content for Craftsy in 2012.
913000	917760	But in November of 2014, the company raised another $50 million in VC financing, and lo
917760	922160	and behold, they got their own fancy cake show, starring Joshua John Russell, featuring
922160	925660	drastically improved production values and a whole new format.
925660	929560	One that seems strangely familiar.
929560	931720	By the way, the milkman came today and dropped this on my door.
931720	934320	I don't know why I put it in this container.
934320	937440	Is it bad that I find that incredibly sexy?
937440	938440	It is sexy.
938520	940520	Sword baby is about to be born.
940520	941520	Boom!
941520	942520	It's a boy!
942520	943520	It's a boy!
943520	949440	Okay, so, if, like me, you're integrating a new cake show into your cake tube diet,
949440	954680	one that admittedly does have more polished production values than your old hat, it may
954680	956680	feel seamless at first.
956680	959920	And this sort of thing is perfect for you to put on in the background of whatever it
959920	962440	is that you're doing and not really paying attention to.
962440	967120	But if you watch enough Man About Cake, you start to notice something.
967120	969360	What bird did that come out of?
969360	970560	It's like a robin's egg.
970560	972560	No, robin's eggs are very, very pale.
972560	978160	Oh, hey, I'm the guy that makes novelty cake t-shirts and Joshua has all of them.
978160	979160	Our birthday.
979160	980680	It's our birthday.
980680	982360	It's for the viewers.
982360	983360	These guys are miked.
983360	985040	Uh, James, who's that guy?
985040	986040	That's Mike.
986040	987040	Say hi, Mike.
987040	988040	What's up, Mike?
988040	989040	Hello.
989040	990040	That's a lavalier mic.
990040	991040	Name the dragon.
991040	992040	Go ahead, Brandon.
992040	993560	Frank the Tank.
993560	997040	Like the sound cop from the producers on How to Cake It is either the on-board mic
997040	999120	or from Yolanda's lavalier mic.
999120	1001840	I'm a single mama, I'm a single mama.
1001840	1005800	But on Man About Cake, everyone on the set has a lavalier mic.
1005800	1007720	Like, this is a lavalier.
1007720	1008720	It's not.
1008720	1012400	It was a Thor joke.
1012400	1015720	And then you start to notice other things, like their use of props.
1015720	1016720	Dobby!
1016720	1017720	Celebrate!
1017720	1018720	Yay!
1018720	1019720	Whoa!
1019720	1022720	That was the best thing that ever happened to me.
1022880	1026680	Guys, I didn't notice there were balloons right above me.
1026680	1028880	Ah, balloons!
1028880	1030880	Or their use of sound effects.
1030880	1036320	I'm gonna, I'm gonna kill these balloons.
1036320	1038360	That pop was added in post.
1038360	1039360	You are fired.
1039360	1040360	You're fired.
1040360	1041680	Their use of relationships within the show.
1041680	1042680	Trim these corn.
1042680	1043680	You better watch that knife.
1043680	1045320	Do you see this shirt?
1045320	1046400	That does not say maybe.
1046400	1048000	I will cut you.
1048000	1052120	Yeah, you know, we're just some guys joshing around, just, you know, being bro-bros, making
1052120	1053960	some cake, as you do.
1053960	1058400	A weird and unnatural dynamic that Russell calls out in the very first episode of Man
1058400	1059400	About Cake.
1059400	1062920	Joining me is my all-male crew, which is not weird at all that four guys would just be
1062920	1065160	hanging out talking about cake, but that's what we do.
1065160	1070240	And when you spend hours watching this show, as I have, you start to realize that this
1070240	1074760	wasn't just a natural dynamic between the host and the crew that eventually got incorporated
1074760	1077360	into the show, like in How to Cake It.
1077360	1079480	This was part of the pitch.
1079480	1083800	The banner for their YouTube show isn't just the host, it's the host and these three
1083800	1085820	guys facing away from the camera.
1085820	1090720	You go onto their website and there are, like, bios for each of the camera guys, you know,
1090720	1095520	camera guys, but they don't have surnames or any defining attributes, and their eyes
1095520	1098700	are blacked out like they're in goddamn witness protection.
1098700	1103540	So it's like this entire show was built around this scaffolding of bros joshing with
1103540	1106240	each other while making a cake.
1106440	1108440	Let's do it!
1108440	1112440	Woo!
1112440	1114440	That was the best thing that ever happened to me.
1118040	1119720	Man About Cake?
1119720	1121800	More like Man About Fake!
1121800	1126080	The plan B's just like, we're done!
1126080	1130680	But a YouTube show can't be like the obvious way more fake genre of reality shows.
1130680	1135640	It instead has to embrace this manufactured authenticity, already pioneered by shows like
1135640	1136880	How to Cake It.
1136880	1140720	But here's the thing, How to Cake It has a really clear business model.
1140720	1144720	Obtrusive at this point, and honestly kind of distracting, but I get it.
1144720	1149680	I get why the show exists and what its business model is, and I can respect that.
1149680	1152920	But Man About Cake has hardly any calls to action.
1152920	1157960	Also on occasion they'll do, like, Q&As, they'll do Instagram-based contests, they'll
1157960	1160080	ask for comments, but that's it.
1160080	1165440	The vast, vast majority of the Man About Cake calls to action are all about building engagement.
1165440	1169360	And here's the thing, Man About Cake's channel doesn't have that many more subscribers
1169360	1173400	than I do, and I know what kind of money these numbers pull.
1173400	1176800	Ad revenue alone cannot pay for a show that looks this nice.
1176800	1177800	Mmm.
1177800	1180040	Tastes like a million subscribers.
1180040	1185320	And in 50-odd episodes, I still don't really understand what their business model is.
1185320	1188960	What are you trying to sell, man?
1188960	1189960	About cake?
1196440	1199320	You're just going to get a lot of footage of me looking sad.
1199320	1204720	I was hoping to get it from different angles, but...
1204720	1205720	It's genuine.
1211720	1216000	Literary critic Marie-Laurie Ryan states that we are more likely to be affected by what
1216000	1219480	happens to people we know than by the fate of strangers.
1219480	1222720	And YouTubers who have shared their lives with their subscribers for several years,
1223000	1228000	in hundreds, or in some cases, thousands of videos, can feel more familiar to some audiences
1228000	1229800	than real-life acquaintances.
1229800	1234600	As we see in reality shows, there is a viewer fascination with what Ryan calls higher cognitive
1234600	1238480	emotions, i.e. shame, excitement, sadness, embarrassment.
1238480	1242920	In 2007, vlogger Chris Crocker became one of the first YouTube stars with an emotional
1242920	1247080	appeal defending pop singer Britney Spears, who was at the time going through a variety
1247080	1250800	of personal crises and being hounded by the paparazzi and press.
1250880	1254880	You're lucky she even performed for you bastards!
1254880	1257880	Leave Britney alone!
1257880	1262680	Part of the viral appeal to this video is, in part, that the emotions are so extreme
1262680	1266600	and sincere that they push the viewer to a place of discomfort, and the best way to deal
1266600	1270880	with that discomfort is to make Crocker the target of ridicule, of parody.
1270880	1271880	Leave him alone!
1271880	1274880	Leave Chris Crocker alone!
1274880	1275880	Leave him alone!
1275960	1280960	But more to the point, that the emotions, over the top that they may be, read as sincere,
1280960	1285960	and in this new marketplace of YouTube, sincerity and authenticity are the valuable commodities.
1285960	1290960	Reality TV was hugely popular when YouTube came onto the scene, and remains hugely popular
1290960	1294960	even in a world with YouTube, but with reality TV, there is more of an understanding that
1294960	1297960	there is little real in what the viewer is watching.
1297960	1301960	With the medium of YouTube, the rules, that is to say, the understanding between the creator
1301960	1303960	and the viewer, are a little different.
1304040	1308040	The videos on your personal channel were, I guess, a little more stream-of-consciousness-y?
1308040	1309040	Yeah.
1309040	1314040	Yeah, just like my day at VidCon and stuff like that, whereas I guess the SciShow and
1314040	1318040	stuff is obviously the most scripted, and I think the interesting thing with the stuff
1318040	1324040	you do on the Vlogbrothers channel is you have a different cadence in the way that you
1324040	1330040	speak, and I've noticed this, even when I was doing a Q&A, I noticed myself slipping
1330120	1334120	into this cadence that I have developed, and I didn't even realize that I had developed
1334120	1337120	it over the course of how many years.
1340120	1345120	I have lots of friends who are YouTubers, and some of them, I'm like, you sound nothing
1345120	1349120	like your YouTube self, and they're like, I don't hear, I don't have any idea what
1349120	1352120	you're talking about, and it's just like, you have a different voice when you're
1352120	1353120	narrating a video.
1353120	1354120	It's just different.
1354120	1355120	It's completely different.
1355200	1361200	But some people sound exactly the same, and they make the same jokes, they make the same
1361200	1363200	facial expressions, nothing is different.
1363200	1369200	I think usually when people meet me, they're surprised that I'm short, and that I compulsively
1369200	1371200	apologize for existing.
1371200	1373200	Which you don't do in your videos.
1373200	1377200	No, no, because people kind of have, even my friends are like, wow, you just seem like
1377200	1378200	such a hard-ass.
1378200	1382200	Yeah, you're competitive in the videos, and in real life, you are not.
1382280	1385280	I don't know, I don't think I am competitive in videos.
1385280	1391280	I think it's just because I'm a woman, and speaking with any kind of confidence feels
1391280	1392280	aggressive.
1392280	1393280	That is true.
1393280	1395280	Yeah, no, you're not wrong.
1400280	1405280	The term emotional labor comes from Arlie Hochschild in her book, The Managed Heart,
1405280	1409280	and was her contribution to discussions of effective and immaterial labor.
1409360	1414360	According to Hochschild, emotional labor requires one to induce or suppress feeling in order
1414360	1418360	to sustain the outward countenance that produces the proper state of mind in others.
1418360	1423360	Her research found that in working with affect, managing one's emotions, can be physically
1423360	1428360	tiring in the same way that manual labor is, and that the commodification of emotion estranges
1428360	1430360	workers from their own feelings.
1430360	1434360	More attention has been paid in recent years to emotional labor in a context of intimate
1434440	1438440	relationships, i.e., the idea that romantic relationships, the onus falls more on women
1438440	1441440	to manage the emotions both of herself and of her partner.
1441440	1446440	But Hochschild was more interested in emotional labor as it pertains to a capitalist commodity.
1446440	1452440	In Hochschild's analysis, not only is seeming to love the job part of the job, but actually
1452440	1457440	trying to love it, and to enjoy the customers, helps the worker in this effort, as they are
1457440	1461440	not simply faking it, but they come to believe and internalize what they are doing for the
1461440	1462440	job.
1462520	1468520	What is critical to her analysis is when this is done for and guided by capital.
1468520	1470520	It's kind of strategic.
1470520	1474520	You want someone to have a reason to come back and watch your video?
1474520	1480520	I think a lot of content, you actually end up with it being a one-off viral video, and
1480520	1484520	I'm watching this because I like the video, like, because it's a good, funny video.
1484520	1485520	Yeah.
1485520	1486520	It had a puppy in it.
1486520	1490520	Yeah, and if you don't get connected to a personality, then, like, the chances that
1490600	1493600	you're going to come back for a second video is way, way down.
1493600	1498600	So, trying to figure out how to connect with a personality without connecting your whole
1498600	1502600	life experience, without sharing everything, is a really tricky balance.
1502600	1509600	How has your approach to selling a version of yourself changed since you started?
1509600	1512600	I, uh...
1515600	1516600	Is that too broad a question?
1516600	1517600	No, it's not.
1517680	1521680	It's just like I'm trying to come to terms with the version of myself that I am on the
1521680	1522680	internet.
1522680	1527680	I think that, ultimately, I think that it's really hard to have that version of myself
1527680	1530680	not also infect the real me.
1530680	1535680	And so, in this weird way, where I've been held accountable to being a better person
1535680	1541680	on the internet, I also just find that it is more comfortable for me to be a better
1541760	1547760	person in real life, and to be really thoughtful and careful, and aware of the impacts I'm
1547760	1548760	having on other people.
1548760	1553760	But there is no doubt that I am a different person on the internet than I am in real life,
1553760	1555760	and that I am very careful.
1555760	1557760	And I don't think that there's anything inauthentic about that.
1557760	1564760	I am the version of myself that I need to be for my own mental health, but also for
1564760	1567760	the impact that I'm going to have on the people who are watching.
1571760	1581760	Every job, to a certain extent, requires maintaining a certain affect.
1581760	1586760	But, there are a number of jobs in which maintaining a certain affect is a requirement of the position.
1586760	1590760	If you are a cast member who works at Disneyland, a requirement of the position is to maintain
1590760	1591760	a friendly affect.
1591760	1596240	It is in your job description to make the customer feel special, and to induce a feeling
1596240	1597240	of happiness.
1597240	1601440	Now, anyone who interacts with a waitress or a Disneyland cast member while they appreciate
1601440	1605920	and expect to receive this affect, don't actually believe that this affect is genuine
1605920	1607240	all of the time.
1607240	1610320	The bartender at the P.F. Chang's doesn't actually care about how you never see your
1610320	1614040	husband, and how YouTube comments are scary and overwhelming, and how you're pretty sure
1614040	1617520	that the guy who sends you these novel-length screeds about how feminists are ruining society
1617520	1621360	and he's going to kill himself and you and probably ten dozen other people, is probably
1621360	1624720	actually going to kill you someday.
1624720	1628280	YouTubers are selling more than a service, like the bartender or the cast member.
1628280	1632640	The product that YouTubers, Twitch streamers, and other influencers sell is almost exclusively
1632640	1636440	affect, and this is a form of emotional labor.
1636440	1641320	More and more discussion has turned to creator burnout, but most of that has focused on consistency,
1641320	1642320	maintaining a schedule.
1642320	1645680	Little of that discussion has focused on the emotional burden of maintaining the affect
1645680	1647920	associated with the creator's brand.
1647920	1651960	Over time, little tiny micro-traumas can build up as a result of a person behaving in a way
1651960	1656320	that does not reflect their emotional truth, but more importantly, that their livelihood
1656320	1657600	depends on.
1657600	1661560	And on some level, a part of burnout is the desire to rebel against this one-sided picture
1661560	1665040	of yourself that you have painted in the interest of consistency.
1665040	1669240	Some extreme examples of this are high-profile YouTubers and streamers letting racial slurs
1669240	1673440	slip into their speech, or going onto other people's streams to rant about how immigrants
1673440	1674600	are bad.
1674600	1678920	Or maybe they got drunk in public and had a run-in with the police.
1678920	1679920	It happens.
1679920	1684960	I don't mean to condone random acts of racial slurs that occur during heated gaming moments,
1685280	1689160	but rather suggest that a part of the burnout is a result not only of YouTube's algorithm
1689160	1694000	placing priority on creators who upload regularly and homogeneously, but also on the emotional
1694000	1697680	labor of only showing the side of yourself that your audience wants to buy.
1697680	1700840	We acknowledge that people working in the service industry don't always do it for the
1700840	1701840	love of the game.
1701840	1705360	A cast member at Disneyland probably works there in part because they like being nice
1705360	1706360	to people.
1706360	1710760	But we also accept that the affect is a part of their job, not necessarily their inner-lived
1710760	1711760	truth.
1711760	1716120	But there's very little sympathy for a high-profile creator who isn't 100% grateful for their
1716120	1718640	platform 100% of the time.
1718640	1722640	When the same basic idea for YouTubers comes up, that they sometimes are afraid of their
1722640	1727280	fans, that maintaining an on-brand affect becomes draining and exhausting, that the
1727280	1732520	expectation of constant availability can begin to do real harm, well, that becomes a breach
1732520	1734920	of trust that the creator had with his community.
1734920	1739200	A part of the platform of YouTube, what some would call influencer culture, is that it's
1739200	1743280	important for creators that their audience think they know you, and that your job depends
1743280	1747800	on maintaining that sense of accessibility and authenticity without going crazy.
1747800	1752620	The premium of authenticity is predicated on maintaining that the affect is convincing.
1752620	1756080	The challenge for creators is to maintain the illusion for their followers of feeling
1756080	1761000	like they do know this creator, when in reality, they only know the affect, the construct,
1761000	1764480	the side of the creator that the creator, most likely without their making a conscious
1764480	1769860	decision to do so, has decided it is most beneficial for you, the audience, to see.
1769860	1774280	It is impossible to have a personal connection to a giant, faceless mass of people who are,
1774280	1779680	in effect, your customers, and when the deception becomes clear, fans can get angry.
1779680	1784160	But lucky for me, I don't have to worry about you guys.
1784160	1786160	You're the good ones.
1786160	1799160	I remember this very brief conversation you and I had at VidCon, where you were talking
1799160	1805960	about making this video where you asked YouTubers kind of random trivia questions, and I was
1805960	1809320	like, oh man, I'm so sorry.
1809320	1812360	I hate that you had to do that while you're here, and you're like, no, I actually look
1812360	1813640	forward to it.
1813640	1822040	It's like my one creative outlet, and that kind of surprised me because I so see anything
1822040	1824320	that I put on YouTube as just work.
1824320	1828080	Sometimes it's gratifying work, but at the end of the day, it's just work to me.
1828080	1829080	Yeah.
1829080	1830080	No.
1830080	1837320	I mean, like, making a video is not, I mean, I don't know what work is.
1837320	1839360	I don't know what work is anymore.
1839360	1841460	I don't know what relaxing is.
1841460	1848060	I don't know, like, I don't, I don't, I don't really know, I don't know how to do it really
1848060	1849060	well.
1849060	1850060	Like, I have a hard time.
1850060	1854580	I sometimes have a hard time, like, being, like, going to just like a gathering of friends
1854580	1858820	and not, you know, thinking about how could my time be better spent.
1858820	1862900	So I, like, I do have that problem, but I do really like making YouTube videos.
1862900	1865100	Like, I love to edit video.
1865100	1867540	I love to, I love to be on camera.
1867540	1868540	I love to write.
1868540	1870420	I love the whole process coming together.
1870420	1872860	I love how fast it can happen.
1872860	1875700	I'm very glad that I have this thing that I get to do every week.
1875700	1876700	Yeah.
1876700	1880740	And in a perfect world, what would your positive impact be?
1880740	1886780	I want people to smile and be happy and, and, like, think that that was a fun experience.
1886780	1888340	One.
1888340	1893900	I want people to, like, get excited about the universe and the world and, like, how
1893900	1898980	cool and weird and, like, thinking critically and hard about stuff.
1898980	1908740	More and more, like, I want to foster some kind of better communication and among people
1908740	1914140	and, and also more and more, I feel like that that that needs to happen a lot more off of
1914140	1916060	the internet than is happening now.
1916060	1925780	I think that we need to have more physical connection or else we will continue to become
1925780	1926780	more lonely.
1926780	1932140	And we need to occupy the same physical space as other human beings.
1932140	1938220	So my hope is also that people find community and connection that can grow outside of and
1938220	1942180	be larger than just the internet.
1942180	1945220	And I don't really know how I'm trying to get that done right now, but it's something I
1945220	1946380	think about a lot.
1946380	1947540	No, Lindsay, I'm going to.
1947540	1949740	Gamify going outside like Pokemon Go.
1949740	1951660	It's like that, it's like that, except that I'm going to.
1951660	1952660	Gamify friendship.
1952660	1952940	Yeah.
1952940	1953340	No, no, no.
1953340	1954540	We got to gamify friendship.
1954540	1960140	It's like the Starbucks app that gamifies coffee, where it's like, you get a star every
1960140	1961140	day you get coffee.
1961140	1966860	So we could gamify it by like, you get a star every time you like, see a person in the real
1966860	1967060	world.
1967060	1968780	Say more than 10 words to them.
1968940	1969460	I like it.
1969460	1972580	The only the only problem I have with this idea is that it's a nonprofit.
1972580	1973980	We need to make money, Lindsay.
1973980	1975700	We need to get filthy rich.
1976140	1976540	You.
1980180	1983140	Now I'm going to cover the cake in white fondant and roll this to an eighth of an inch
1983180	1984580	thickness and a little bit of powdered sugar.
1984580	1986580	Snow, snow, snow.
1986580	1988580	So you love Florence and the Machine so much.
1988580	1993300	So obviously I'm coming at this discussion both from the angle of a creator and as a
1993300	1993820	viewer.
1993820	1997860	Part of the reason I focused on cake decorating YouTube is not only because, you know, that's
1997860	2003300	what I watch, but because there's something that happens in media where the scenes that
2003300	2007580	are supposed to be hidden, once you see them, it's kind of hard to unsee.
2008420	2011300	Asking what Man About Cake is selling is the wrong question.
2011540	2013740	Man About Cake isn't trying to sell anything.
2014020	2019940	It is instead the product to be bought, which it was after that influx of VC financing in
2019940	2022740	2014 and the launch of Man About Cake two years later.
2023180	2028540	That was all made with an eye towards acquisition, which they were by NBCUniversal earlier
2028540	2033860	this summer, rebranding Craftsy as Blueprint on July 17th, 2018.
2034700	2035580	All right, now we're all covered.
2035580	2037500	I'm going to make some paper drawings and lyrics.
2038420	2043340	Big corporations see the value in authenticity, even manufactured authenticity like Man About
2043340	2045540	Cake or this.
2046140	2050380	Old companies will pay a lot of money for brands that can successfully sell authenticity,
2050660	2054020	and entire newer corporations have molded their marketing strategy around the faith
2054020	2058220	viewers have in the authenticity of their favorite YouTuber or their favorite podcaster.
2058460	2061980	Companies like Casper, Audible, and of course, Squarespace.
2062300	2065900	Now, I hope this doesn't come across that I'm trying to make a grand sweeping statement
2065940	2070580	about how thing bad, even though that does tend to be the most effective way to get popular
2070580	2076660	on YouTube, but rather thing exists and thing is a part of a system that you may not even
2076660	2077580	be conscious of.
2077980	2080380	But all content is cultivated.
2080700	2084060	No one can portray a fully lived experience on this platform.
2084420	2089500	And to paraphrase the great Dolly Parton, it takes a lot of labor to appear this
2089500	2090100	authentic.
2090860	2093580	This video was brought to you by Squarespace.
2094420	2099940	Just like URL, Squarespace dot com slash Lindsay Ellis for a free trial.
2100260	2106700	And when you're ready to launch, use the offer code Lindsay Ellis, I guess, to save 10%
2106700	2109260	off your first purchase of a website or domain.
2109740	2114700	We bought this URL because we were having problems with Google AdSense and my tax ID
2114700	2116500	number for my new corporation.
2116500	2118100	And so we were really angry about it.
2118100	2122260	So we just made a website where we just complain about things we don't like, like this
2122260	2124660	dog, my new neighbor.
2126180	2131100	He's getting a blog entry, free and secure hosting, nothing to upgrade ever.
2131420	2137180	You can promote your business, announce events, powerful e-commerce functionality.
2137180	2138060	I should try that.
2138340	2140380	Nothing about your neighbor's dog, though.
2140700	2142980	Easily create a website, make a video about it.
2142980	2144660	Nothing about your neighbor's dog, though.
2145020	2147260	Easily create a website, make it stand out.
2147580	2148700	It's going to be beautiful.
2149540	2150660	The future is coming.
2150660	2153140	Make it brighter with Squarespace.
2155660	2157100	Squarespace is coming.
2157460	2158740	I'm coming for this dog.
