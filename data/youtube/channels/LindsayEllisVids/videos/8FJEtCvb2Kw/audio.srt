1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,160
The photographic chamber of the eye, records bare painted walls, while an electric light

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,960
lays the chromium nerves of plumbing raw.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,480
Such poverty assaults the ego.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,240
Caught naked in the merely actual room, the stranger in the lavatory mirror puts on a

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:28,440
public grin, repeats our name, but scrupulously reflects the usual terror.

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,880
Sylvia Plath, Tale of a Tub.

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,000
Cultural milestones come and go, but every now and then, we are privileged enough to

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,800
experience something so profound and important, it not only defines a generation, it changes

13
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,920
the world.

14
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,120
And right now, in the era of new media, creative for streaming, online video that is still

15
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:26,840
beginning to define its own identity, we can clearly pinpoint the apotheosis of generation

16
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:34,600
defining web series, which intersects altruism, accessibility, technical skill, and philosophy.

17
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:41,800
I'm talking, of course, about the YouTube series How to Cake It with Yolanda Gump.

18
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,280
During the course of an episode of How to Cake It, Yolanda challenges herself with the

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,980
creation of a novelty cake, usually in the shape of a real-life object, often a tie-in

20
00:01:49,980 --> 00:02:00,520
with a relevant pop culture artifact that she has obviously never seen, and usually

21
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:10,520
draped in fondant, the most disgusting foodstuff man has yet cruelly devised.

22
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,320
A typical How to Cake It episode goes as follows.

23
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:25,840
First, Yolanda bakes her cake, usually double-digit pounds of it, then she soaks the cake in simple

24
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,000
syrup from her tool, which her commenters have named Sir Squeeze-A-Lot, Sir Squeeze

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
for short.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,440
You can buy your very own Sir Squeeze at her website.

27
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:40,480
Then she begins to ice the cake, before promoting her paid service, Camp Cake, where you can

28
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,320
bake and decorate a cake with Yolanda in real time.

29
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,280
Then she carves the cake into the right shape, while asking a question for you to leave a

30
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,840
comment, which will up engagement and be more favorable to YouTube's algorithm.

31
00:02:51,840 --> 00:03:03,940
Then she crumb coats and chills the cake, before mentioning her t-shirt club, asking

32
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,540
for shares, promoting her second channel, and then removing the chilled cake to do the

33
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,000
final icing.

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,520
Then she mentions her monthly sprinkle service, which you can subscribe to.

35
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,160
Then she drapes her cake in the horrible, horrible fondant, before then reminding you

36
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,560
to subscribe to the channel if you haven't, then the decoration begins.

37
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,160
After which she reminds you that you can buy more of her merchandise at her website.

38
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,720
And during the hours of meticulous decorating, she also reminds the viewer to buy her book.

39
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,560
A tactic which only a sucker would fall for.

40
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,360
As of August 2018, How to Cake It has amassed 3.8 million subscribers in about three years.

41
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,480
And in that three years, the show has grown from one or two calls to action within a given

42
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,440
episode to on average, eleven calls to action in an episode.

43
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,160
Your average episode of How to Cake It is almost more call to action than it is cake

44
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,440
making at this point.

45
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,200
For those of you who are not hep to the lingo, or who have never had a social media manager

46
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,040
of some sort, a call to action is where, in the content of a video, the host asks the

47
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,460
viewer to do engagement with the content, in a more active way than just sitting on

48
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,780
your ass for 11-17 minutes.

49
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:19,600
This can be as small as asking me for you to smash that like button, or to ask for shares,

50
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,600
or suggesting that you use my URL to go build your own beautiful Squarespace website.

51
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,320
Calls to action are somewhat unique to online media.

52
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,160
If you're hosting a cooking show on Food Network, you can't exactly ask someone to leave a comment

53
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,160
on their cable channel.

54
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,160
I mean, I guess you can, but...

55
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,360
But calls to action are not completely unique to online media.

56
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,600
One key to the popularity of RuPaul's Drag Race is their prevalence on social media,

57
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,880
which is not only encouraged by RuPaul soliciting calls to action,

58
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,080
I want to hear from you, the fans, who do you think deserves the crown?

59
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,720
Are you Team Aquaria?

60
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
Team Asia?

61
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,360
but by the structure of its show lending itself to easy sharing.

62
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,360
Not today, Satan.

63
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
I'll be thirsty, bitch.

64
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Miss Vanjie.

65
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Miss Vanjie.

66
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
Miss Vanjie.

67
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:13,120
The secret to Yolanda's success is not, of course, the calls to action.

68
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,800
Those gradually rose as her subscriber count did.

69
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,560
If you look at earlier episodes of How to Cake It, you see that there are very few calls

70
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,440
to action, and most of them are requests for likes and subscribes, with subscription services,

71
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,520
merchandise, and camp cake being gradually added through the years and months.

72
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,880
Early episodes are actually very conventional, and more in the vein of your typical Food

73
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,920
Network show.

74
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,320
But about five months after the channel launched, in the Flower Pot of Cake episode published

75
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,520
on May 5th, 2015, a new element is introduced.

76
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,400
Then I measure, then I measure the circumference, do I look tired?

77
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
No.

78
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Circumference.

79
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,240
The giggle you hear is the voice of producer Jocelyn Mercer, and her presence in the series,

80
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,240
interacting with Yolanda from offscreen, only increases from here, to the point where now,

81
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,240
it's a feature of the show.

82
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,240
Why are they called gym leaders?

83
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,760
I guess they're actually like in gyms, and then so you work your way through the gym.

84
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,120
So it's a workout game.

85
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,460
This element proves engaging, and in the following months, there's a correlation

86
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,120
of increased interaction between the production crew and the host.

87
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,720
In effect, Yolanda breaks down the facade that is production.

88
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,360
She jokes with her producers, she jokes with her cameramen.

89
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,000
Are Americans going to get mad at this?

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,080
Sometimes she even jokes with her editor, who is not in the room.

91
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,720
The series went from the occasional fourth wall breaks, to fourth wall breaks being a

92
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
part of the show's identity.

93
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Ooh, that's a good one, yo.

94
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,440
Just, if you could just pull that, yeah, yeah, perfect.

95
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,600
Yolanda and her producers have effectively figured out not only how to market a curated

96
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,840
version of her personality, but with how she interacts with her crew.

97
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,120
I don't think they're as technique as the finishers, but they definitely have pins.

98
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,160
And the interactions with the crew make the show feel more authentic.

99
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,560
You feel like you're just, you know, in the room, hanging out, laughing about this

100
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,680
elaborate cake that looks like a giant turkey.

101
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,760
Now pop your turkey cake in the fridge.

102
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,840
I'm doing way too much of this.

103
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,600
This falls into line with the appeal of YouTube in general, that it strips away the polished

104
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,560
facade of television to give you something more real.

105
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,240
We should send every rapper a newsletter without this info.

106
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,640
Just use the same word, guys.

107
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,560
Just use the same word.

108
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,920
Every sentence in the song ends with the same word.

109
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,440
Yolanda can get away with her 11,000 calls to action per episode, not in spite of this

110
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,240
fourth wall breaking format, but because of it.

111
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,720
Owning the fact that a polished production like this is in fact a group effort, this

112
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
isn't just a show.

113
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,400
You know, we're just hanging out, laughing about this cake.

114
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,680
We're just having fun.

115
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,840
You must chill this cake.

116
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,360
Thine must chill.

117
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,400
I don't know if it's thine.

118
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
I don't know.

119
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,040
To be clear, this is not a call out.

120
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,400
How to Cake It has a clear and effective business model, and Yolanda Gomp is both an engaging

121
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,280
personality and a talented artist with fondant.

122
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,880
I do find the calls to action distracting, but I loyally watch every episode of How to

123
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,720
Cake It, and yes, I own her goddamn book, and no, I have not attempted to make a single

124
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,600
one of these cakes.

125
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,400
But there is something special, innovative, dare I say, lucrative, in the style and format

126
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,000
Yolanda and her colleagues have devised.

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,280
And other companies have begun to take notice.

128
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:37,120
The medium is the message.

129
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,720
YouTube was founded in 2005 by three former PayPal employees, Chad Hurley, Steve Chen,

130
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,240
and Jawad Kareem.

131
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,400
The idea for YouTube in part was inspired by Jawad Kareem's difficulty in finding and

132
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,720
watching videos online of Janet Jackson having her tit exposed by Justin Timberlake during

133
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,520
the Super Bowl halftime show.

134
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:00,600
Based on a failed prior project, a video dating site called TuneInHookUp, by February of 2005,

135
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,280
the trio had agreed to set work on the YouTube project, with Chen and Kareem taking technical

136
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,080
duties and Hurley taking on a managerial-slash-administrative role.

137
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,840
In April of 2005, the very first video was uploaded to YouTube, a video of Jawad hanging

138
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
out at a zoo.

139
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:22,840
The cool thing about these guys is that they have really, really, really long trunks.

140
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,560
And no one ever wanted for videos of wardrobe malfunctions ever again.

141
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,240
And that's pretty much all there is to say.

142
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,840
So what does YouTube offer as a medium?

143
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,480
Arguably, YouTube offers anything you want, but the platform specializes in certain niches

144
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,960
that flourish on this platform more than they do elsewhere.

145
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:50,960
TV blogs, makeup tutorials, video games, Screamer, Adder, and DIY channels make up

146
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,280
a huge percentage of successful channels.

147
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,520
But the form that both originated and flourished on the format and remains the most popular

148
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,600
are the slice-of-life bloggers.

149
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,680
To this day, the biggest channels on the platform, with the likes of Logan Paul and PewDiePie,

150
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,040
even if they specialize in a subcategory like video games, are, in effect, slice-of-life

151
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
bloggers.

152
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,520
Fundamentally, YouTube lifts the barrier between the content creator and the viewer.

153
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,680
Decades prior, television had come into people's homes and given us the likes of news anchors

154
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,840
and late-night talk show hosts to provide a friendly public figure, a personality that

155
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,640
people find recognizable, relatable, and also a bridge to the world of celebrity.

156
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,760
But with YouTube, we strip away the artifice.

157
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,960
Indeed, even in the name of the platform, the person uploading the video controls what

158
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,760
goes on on their channel.

159
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,000
YouTube is the medium of authenticity.

160
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,160
Someone simply records a video, edits it as they please, and uploads it to their millions

161
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,160
of subscribers.

162
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,160
No middlemen.

163
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,240
YouTube is the response to the demand of a younger audience, hungry for what they consider

164
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,120
authentic.

165
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,040
And because of this perceived authenticity, audiences give a great deal more latitude

166
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,640
with the sale of certain things.

167
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,280
For instance, sprinkle services and t-shirt clubs.

168
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,800
This observation was brought to you by Squarespace.

169
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,400
With Squarespace, you can design a beautiful website designed by professionals that know

170
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,800
what they're doing.

171
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
Not like me.

172
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,520
But even from the beginning, there are blurred lines between slice-of-life daily vlogs and

173
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,920
authentic fiction.

174
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,800
One of the earliest breakthrough channels was LonelyGirl15, which launched in the summer

175
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,280
of 2006 and was, for a time, the most-subscribed channel on YouTube.

176
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:28,160
Anyway, so Daniel is really mad right now, and I don't know if he'll be allowed to come

177
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,160
over anymore.

178
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,960
The series initially presented as an authentic YouTube video diary, but gained even more notoriety

179
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,160
when it was outed as being completely fictional in September of the same year.

180
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,120
It is noteworthy that the big controversy around LonelyGirl15 was the revelation that

181
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,240
LonelyGirl15 was, in fact, an actress, and that her daily vlogs were fictional and completely

182
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,680
fabricated.

183
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,840
Part of the appeal of YouTube is its perceived authenticity, but even if there is no network

184
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,480
or middleman, everything that is uploaded to YouTube is cultivated by the creator.

185
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,120
And is it fair, therefore, to say that what LonelyGirl15 is trying to sell you is any

186
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,640
less authentic than Logan Paul?

187
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:16,000
I guess what I wanted to ask you was why you decided to be a YouTuber.

188
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,080
I didn't decide to be a YouTuber.

189
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,640
Does anyone?

190
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,920
I didn't decide to be a YouTuber.

191
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,400
It just called to you?

192
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,600
Well, there wasn't, no, there was, like, there were no YouTubers.

193
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,800
It was 2007.

194
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,760
There wasn't a such thing as a YouTuber.

195
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,760
So here's a question.

196
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:36,080
Do you, okay, so, like, the stuff you're supposed to do, like, calls to action, and do you ever

197
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,000
consciously, like, incorporate stuff like that, like stuff that's supposed to improve

198
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
metrics?

199
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
No.

200
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,960
I mean, the things that I do to improve metrics are, like, a good title and a good thumbnail,

201
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,280
and I don't think beyond that.

202
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:51,320
Like, the algorithm changes too much for my old man self to be trying to keep up with

203
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,320
it.

204
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,560
But no, I mean, I do calls to action because I want, when I want somebody to take an action.

205
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,920
I do calls to action when PBS tells me what to say.

206
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
Yeah.

207
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
Yeah.

208
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,120
And it's like, someone on Twitter actually, like, called me out on that.

209
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,720
They were like, it's weird hearing you do a call to action.

210
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
It's very not on-brand.

211
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,440
And I'm like, uh, yep, yeah, you're right, you're right.

212
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,440
Influencer culture.

213
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,440
I hate that term.

214
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
Yeah.

215
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
I hate everything about it.

216
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,040
Both of those words are, mean nothing.

217
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:27,160
I think that you could see Squarespace.com slash Dear Hank.

218
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,000
No, I, yeah, no, this, this video is going to be sponsored by Squarespace if they clear

219
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
it.

220
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Okay.

221
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This video where I'm highly critical of influencer culture.

222
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,560
Hey, I, like, if, if you're going to influence people to do something, like, you know, if

223
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,160
you're going to have a website, you might as well use Squarespace.

224
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,160
That's their, that's their new motto.

225
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
You know what?

226
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
Just fucking do it.

227
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,160
Just stop.

228
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,160
Squarespace.

229
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,520
Just fucking do it.

230
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,360
Don't try to be all fancy and shit.

231
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,360
You don't know what you're doing.

232
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,360
Just get a Squarespace.

233
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,360
Come on.

234
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,280
Um, it's good.

235
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
We're really good at this.

236
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,840
The medium is the message.

237
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,560
See, I forgot his first name, Marshall.

238
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,520
The medium is the message.

239
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,520
Marshall McLuhan, 1960.

240
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
What?

241
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
McLuhan.

242
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,520
McLuhan?

243
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,520
Yeah.

244
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:26,640
Around when Yolanda Gomp started using the joshing with producers gimmick, her sub started

245
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,440
going way, way up.

246
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,880
And by mid-2016, she's well past a million subscribers.

247
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:37,880
And around this time, on July 26, 2016, venture capital-funded startup Craftsy began publishing

248
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,320
the first episode of their own cake show.

249
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,680
Sometimes you need more than just to know how to cake it.

250
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,480
Sometimes you need a man about cake.

251
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,040
Hey guys, welcome to Man About Cake.

252
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,240
Craftsy was a startup service that specialized in hobby and lifestyle tutorials and craft

253
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,840
education that was launched in 2011 by a bunch of former eBay executives.

254
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,560
One of the contributors who featured in content behind this paywall was pastry chef and sugar

255
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,280
artist Joshua John Russell.

256
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,880
I want your stencil resting against your cake board to help make sure it doesn't shift around.

257
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,000
who began starring in content for Craftsy in 2012.

258
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,760
But in November of 2014, the company raised another $50 million in VC financing, and lo

259
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,160
and behold, they got their own fancy cake show, starring Joshua John Russell, featuring

260
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,660
drastically improved production values and a whole new format.

261
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,560
One that seems strangely familiar.

262
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,720
By the way, the milkman came today and dropped this on my door.

263
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,320
I don't know why I put it in this container.

264
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,440
Is it bad that I find that incredibly sexy?

265
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
It is sexy.

266
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,520
Sword baby is about to be born.

267
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,520
Boom!

268
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,520
It's a boy!

269
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
It's a boy!

270
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:49,440
Okay, so, if, like me, you're integrating a new cake show into your cake tube diet,

271
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,680
one that admittedly does have more polished production values than your old hat, it may

272
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,680
feel seamless at first.

273
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,920
And this sort of thing is perfect for you to put on in the background of whatever it

274
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,440
is that you're doing and not really paying attention to.

275
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,120
But if you watch enough Man About Cake, you start to notice something.

276
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,360
What bird did that come out of?

277
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,560
It's like a robin's egg.

278
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,560
No, robin's eggs are very, very pale.

279
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,160
Oh, hey, I'm the guy that makes novelty cake t-shirts and Joshua has all of them.

280
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
Our birthday.

281
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,680
It's our birthday.

282
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,360
It's for the viewers.

283
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,360
These guys are miked.

284
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,040
Uh, James, who's that guy?

285
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
That's Mike.

286
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,040
Say hi, Mike.

287
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
What's up, Mike?

288
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Hello.

289
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
That's a lavalier mic.

290
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
Name the dragon.

291
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,040
Go ahead, Brandon.

292
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,560
Frank the Tank.

293
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,040
Like the sound cop from the producers on How to Cake It is either the on-board mic

294
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,120
or from Yolanda's lavalier mic.

295
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,840
I'm a single mama, I'm a single mama.

296
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,800
But on Man About Cake, everyone on the set has a lavalier mic.

297
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,720
Like, this is a lavalier.

298
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,720
It's not.

299
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,400
It was a Thor joke.

300
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,720
And then you start to notice other things, like their use of props.

301
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,720
Dobby!

302
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,720
Celebrate!

303
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,720
Yay!

304
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,720
Whoa!

305
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,720
That was the best thing that ever happened to me.

306
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,680
Guys, I didn't notice there were balloons right above me.

307
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,880
Ah, balloons!

308
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,880
Or their use of sound effects.

309
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,320
I'm gonna, I'm gonna kill these balloons.

310
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,360
That pop was added in post.

311
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,360
You are fired.

312
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,360
You're fired.

313
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,680
Their use of relationships within the show.

314
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,680
Trim these corn.

315
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,680
You better watch that knife.

316
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,320
Do you see this shirt?

317
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,400
That does not say maybe.

318
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,000
I will cut you.

319
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,120
Yeah, you know, we're just some guys joshing around, just, you know, being bro-bros, making

320
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,960
some cake, as you do.

321
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,400
A weird and unnatural dynamic that Russell calls out in the very first episode of Man

322
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
About Cake.

323
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,920
Joining me is my all-male crew, which is not weird at all that four guys would just be

324
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,160
hanging out talking about cake, but that's what we do.

325
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,240
And when you spend hours watching this show, as I have, you start to realize that this

326
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,760
wasn't just a natural dynamic between the host and the crew that eventually got incorporated

327
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,360
into the show, like in How to Cake It.

328
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,480
This was part of the pitch.

329
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,800
The banner for their YouTube show isn't just the host, it's the host and these three

330
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,820
guys facing away from the camera.

331
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,720
You go onto their website and there are, like, bios for each of the camera guys, you know,

332
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,520
camera guys, but they don't have surnames or any defining attributes, and their eyes

333
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,700
are blacked out like they're in goddamn witness protection.

334
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,540
So it's like this entire show was built around this scaffolding of bros joshing with

335
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,240
each other while making a cake.

336
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,440
Let's do it!

337
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,440
Woo!

338
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,440
That was the best thing that ever happened to me.

339
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,720
Man About Cake?

340
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,800
More like Man About Fake!

341
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,080
The plan B's just like, we're done!

342
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,680
But a YouTube show can't be like the obvious way more fake genre of reality shows.

343
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,640
It instead has to embrace this manufactured authenticity, already pioneered by shows like

344
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,880
How to Cake It.

345
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,720
But here's the thing, How to Cake It has a really clear business model.

346
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,720
Obtrusive at this point, and honestly kind of distracting, but I get it.

347
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,680
I get why the show exists and what its business model is, and I can respect that.

348
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,920
But Man About Cake has hardly any calls to action.

349
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,960
Also on occasion they'll do, like, Q&As, they'll do Instagram-based contests, they'll

350
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,080
ask for comments, but that's it.

351
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,440
The vast, vast majority of the Man About Cake calls to action are all about building engagement.

352
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,360
And here's the thing, Man About Cake's channel doesn't have that many more subscribers

353
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,400
than I do, and I know what kind of money these numbers pull.

354
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,800
Ad revenue alone cannot pay for a show that looks this nice.

355
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
Mmm.

356
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,040
Tastes like a million subscribers.

357
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:45,320
And in 50-odd episodes, I still don't really understand what their business model is.

358
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,960
What are you trying to sell, man?

359
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,960
About cake?

360
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,320
You're just going to get a lot of footage of me looking sad.

361
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:04,720
I was hoping to get it from different angles, but...

362
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,720
It's genuine.

363
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,000
Literary critic Marie-Laurie Ryan states that we are more likely to be affected by what

364
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,480
happens to people we know than by the fate of strangers.

365
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,720
And YouTubers who have shared their lives with their subscribers for several years,

366
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
in hundreds, or in some cases, thousands of videos, can feel more familiar to some audiences

367
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,800
than real-life acquaintances.

368
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,600
As we see in reality shows, there is a viewer fascination with what Ryan calls higher cognitive

369
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,480
emotions, i.e. shame, excitement, sadness, embarrassment.

370
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,920
In 2007, vlogger Chris Crocker became one of the first YouTube stars with an emotional

371
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,080
appeal defending pop singer Britney Spears, who was at the time going through a variety

372
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,800
of personal crises and being hounded by the paparazzi and press.

373
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,880
You're lucky she even performed for you bastards!

374
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,880
Leave Britney alone!

375
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,680
Part of the viral appeal to this video is, in part, that the emotions are so extreme

376
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,600
and sincere that they push the viewer to a place of discomfort, and the best way to deal

377
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,880
with that discomfort is to make Crocker the target of ridicule, of parody.

378
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
Leave him alone!

379
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,880
Leave Chris Crocker alone!

380
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,880
Leave him alone!

381
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,960
But more to the point, that the emotions, over the top that they may be, read as sincere,

382
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,960
and in this new marketplace of YouTube, sincerity and authenticity are the valuable commodities.

383
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,960
Reality TV was hugely popular when YouTube came onto the scene, and remains hugely popular

384
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,960
even in a world with YouTube, but with reality TV, there is more of an understanding that

385
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,960
there is little real in what the viewer is watching.

386
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,960
With the medium of YouTube, the rules, that is to say, the understanding between the creator

387
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,960
and the viewer, are a little different.

388
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,040
The videos on your personal channel were, I guess, a little more stream-of-consciousness-y?

389
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Yeah.

390
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:54,040
Yeah, just like my day at VidCon and stuff like that, whereas I guess the SciShow and

391
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,040
stuff is obviously the most scripted, and I think the interesting thing with the stuff

392
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:04,040
you do on the Vlogbrothers channel is you have a different cadence in the way that you

393
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:10,040
speak, and I've noticed this, even when I was doing a Q&A, I noticed myself slipping

394
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,120
into this cadence that I have developed, and I didn't even realize that I had developed

395
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,120
it over the course of how many years.

396
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:25,120
I have lots of friends who are YouTubers, and some of them, I'm like, you sound nothing

397
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,120
like your YouTube self, and they're like, I don't hear, I don't have any idea what

398
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,120
you're talking about, and it's just like, you have a different voice when you're

399
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,120
narrating a video.

400
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,120
It's just different.

401
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
It's completely different.

402
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,200
But some people sound exactly the same, and they make the same jokes, they make the same

403
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
facial expressions, nothing is different.

404
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,200
I think usually when people meet me, they're surprised that I'm short, and that I compulsively

405
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
apologize for existing.

406
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
Which you don't do in your videos.

407
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,200
No, no, because people kind of have, even my friends are like, wow, you just seem like

408
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
such a hard-ass.

409
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Yeah, you're competitive in the videos, and in real life, you are not.

410
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,280
I don't know, I don't think I am competitive in videos.

411
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:11,280
I think it's just because I'm a woman, and speaking with any kind of confidence feels

412
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,280
aggressive.

413
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,280
That is true.

414
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,280
Yeah, no, you're not wrong.

415
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:25,280
The term emotional labor comes from Arlie Hochschild in her book, The Managed Heart,

416
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,280
and was her contribution to discussions of effective and immaterial labor.

417
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,360
According to Hochschild, emotional labor requires one to induce or suppress feeling in order

418
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,360
to sustain the outward countenance that produces the proper state of mind in others.

419
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,360
Her research found that in working with affect, managing one's emotions, can be physically

420
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,360
tiring in the same way that manual labor is, and that the commodification of emotion estranges

421
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,360
workers from their own feelings.

422
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,360
More attention has been paid in recent years to emotional labor in a context of intimate

423
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,440
relationships, i.e., the idea that romantic relationships, the onus falls more on women

424
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,440
to manage the emotions both of herself and of her partner.

425
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,440
But Hochschild was more interested in emotional labor as it pertains to a capitalist commodity.

426
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:12,440
In Hochschild's analysis, not only is seeming to love the job part of the job, but actually

427
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:17,440
trying to love it, and to enjoy the customers, helps the worker in this effort, as they are

428
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,440
not simply faking it, but they come to believe and internalize what they are doing for the

429
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,440
job.

430
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:28,520
What is critical to her analysis is when this is done for and guided by capital.

431
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,520
It's kind of strategic.

432
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,520
You want someone to have a reason to come back and watch your video?

433
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:40,520
I think a lot of content, you actually end up with it being a one-off viral video, and

434
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,520
I'm watching this because I like the video, like, because it's a good, funny video.

435
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,520
Yeah.

436
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,520
It had a puppy in it.

437
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,520
Yeah, and if you don't get connected to a personality, then, like, the chances that

438
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,600
you're going to come back for a second video is way, way down.

439
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,600
So, trying to figure out how to connect with a personality without connecting your whole

440
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,600
life experience, without sharing everything, is a really tricky balance.

441
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:09,600
How has your approach to selling a version of yourself changed since you started?

442
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,600
I, uh...

443
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Is that too broad a question?

444
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
No, it's not.

445
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,680
It's just like I'm trying to come to terms with the version of myself that I am on the

446
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,680
internet.

447
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:27,680
I think that, ultimately, I think that it's really hard to have that version of myself

448
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,680
not also infect the real me.

449
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:35,680
And so, in this weird way, where I've been held accountable to being a better person

450
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:41,680
on the internet, I also just find that it is more comfortable for me to be a better

451
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,760
person in real life, and to be really thoughtful and careful, and aware of the impacts I'm

452
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,760
having on other people.

453
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:53,760
But there is no doubt that I am a different person on the internet than I am in real life,

454
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
and that I am very careful.

455
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,760
And I don't think that there's anything inauthentic about that.

456
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:04,760
I am the version of myself that I need to be for my own mental health, but also for

457
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,760
the impact that I'm going to have on the people who are watching.

458
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:21,760
Every job, to a certain extent, requires maintaining a certain affect.

459
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,760
But, there are a number of jobs in which maintaining a certain affect is a requirement of the position.

460
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,760
If you are a cast member who works at Disneyland, a requirement of the position is to maintain

461
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,760
a friendly affect.

462
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,240
It is in your job description to make the customer feel special, and to induce a feeling

463
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,240
of happiness.

464
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,440
Now, anyone who interacts with a waitress or a Disneyland cast member while they appreciate

465
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,920
and expect to receive this affect, don't actually believe that this affect is genuine

466
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,240
all of the time.

467
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,320
The bartender at the P.F. Chang's doesn't actually care about how you never see your

468
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,040
husband, and how YouTube comments are scary and overwhelming, and how you're pretty sure

469
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,520
that the guy who sends you these novel-length screeds about how feminists are ruining society

470
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,360
and he's going to kill himself and you and probably ten dozen other people, is probably

471
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,720
actually going to kill you someday.

472
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,280
YouTubers are selling more than a service, like the bartender or the cast member.

473
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:12,640
The product that YouTubers, Twitch streamers, and other influencers sell is almost exclusively

474
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,440
affect, and this is a form of emotional labor.

475
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,320
More and more discussion has turned to creator burnout, but most of that has focused on consistency,

476
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,320
maintaining a schedule.

477
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,680
Little of that discussion has focused on the emotional burden of maintaining the affect

478
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,920
associated with the creator's brand.

479
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,960
Over time, little tiny micro-traumas can build up as a result of a person behaving in a way

480
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,320
that does not reflect their emotional truth, but more importantly, that their livelihood

481
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,600
depends on.

482
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,560
And on some level, a part of burnout is the desire to rebel against this one-sided picture

483
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,040
of yourself that you have painted in the interest of consistency.

484
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,240
Some extreme examples of this are high-profile YouTubers and streamers letting racial slurs

485
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,440
slip into their speech, or going onto other people's streams to rant about how immigrants

486
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,600
are bad.

487
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,920
Or maybe they got drunk in public and had a run-in with the police.

488
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
It happens.

489
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,960
I don't mean to condone random acts of racial slurs that occur during heated gaming moments,

490
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,160
but rather suggest that a part of the burnout is a result not only of YouTube's algorithm

491
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,000
placing priority on creators who upload regularly and homogeneously, but also on the emotional

492
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,680
labor of only showing the side of yourself that your audience wants to buy.

493
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,840
We acknowledge that people working in the service industry don't always do it for the

494
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,840
love of the game.

495
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,360
A cast member at Disneyland probably works there in part because they like being nice

496
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,360
to people.

497
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,760
But we also accept that the affect is a part of their job, not necessarily their inner-lived

498
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,760
truth.

499
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,120
But there's very little sympathy for a high-profile creator who isn't 100% grateful for their

500
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,640
platform 100% of the time.

501
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,640
When the same basic idea for YouTubers comes up, that they sometimes are afraid of their

502
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,280
fans, that maintaining an on-brand affect becomes draining and exhausting, that the

503
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:52,520
expectation of constant availability can begin to do real harm, well, that becomes a breach

504
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,920
of trust that the creator had with his community.

505
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,200
A part of the platform of YouTube, what some would call influencer culture, is that it's

506
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,280
important for creators that their audience think they know you, and that your job depends

507
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,800
on maintaining that sense of accessibility and authenticity without going crazy.

508
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,620
The premium of authenticity is predicated on maintaining that the affect is convincing.

509
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,080
The challenge for creators is to maintain the illusion for their followers of feeling

510
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,000
like they do know this creator, when in reality, they only know the affect, the construct,

511
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,480
the side of the creator that the creator, most likely without their making a conscious

512
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,860
decision to do so, has decided it is most beneficial for you, the audience, to see.

513
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:34,280
It is impossible to have a personal connection to a giant, faceless mass of people who are,

514
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:39,680
in effect, your customers, and when the deception becomes clear, fans can get angry.

515
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,160
But lucky for me, I don't have to worry about you guys.

516
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,160
You're the good ones.

517
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:59,160
I remember this very brief conversation you and I had at VidCon, where you were talking

518
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:05,960
about making this video where you asked YouTubers kind of random trivia questions, and I was

519
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,320
like, oh man, I'm so sorry.

520
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,360
I hate that you had to do that while you're here, and you're like, no, I actually look

521
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,640
forward to it.

522
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:22,040
It's like my one creative outlet, and that kind of surprised me because I so see anything

523
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,320
that I put on YouTube as just work.

524
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,080
Sometimes it's gratifying work, but at the end of the day, it's just work to me.

525
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,080
Yeah.

526
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,080
No.

527
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:37,320
I mean, like, making a video is not, I mean, I don't know what work is.

528
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,360
I don't know what work is anymore.

529
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,460
I don't know what relaxing is.

530
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:48,060
I don't know, like, I don't, I don't, I don't really know, I don't know how to do it really

531
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,060
well.

532
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,060
Like, I have a hard time.

533
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:54,580
I sometimes have a hard time, like, being, like, going to just like a gathering of friends

534
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,820
and not, you know, thinking about how could my time be better spent.

535
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,900
So I, like, I do have that problem, but I do really like making YouTube videos.

536
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,100
Like, I love to edit video.

537
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,540
I love to, I love to be on camera.

538
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,540
I love to write.

539
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,420
I love the whole process coming together.

540
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,860
I love how fast it can happen.

541
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,700
I'm very glad that I have this thing that I get to do every week.

542
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,700
Yeah.

543
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,740
And in a perfect world, what would your positive impact be?

544
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:26,780
I want people to smile and be happy and, and, like, think that that was a fun experience.

545
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,340
One.

546
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:33,900
I want people to, like, get excited about the universe and the world and, like, how

547
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:38,980
cool and weird and, like, thinking critically and hard about stuff.

548
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:48,740
More and more, like, I want to foster some kind of better communication and among people

549
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:54,140
and, and also more and more, I feel like that that that needs to happen a lot more off of

550
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,060
the internet than is happening now.

551
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:05,780
I think that we need to have more physical connection or else we will continue to become

552
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,780
more lonely.

553
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:12,140
And we need to occupy the same physical space as other human beings.

554
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:18,220
So my hope is also that people find community and connection that can grow outside of and

555
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:22,180
be larger than just the internet.

556
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,220
And I don't really know how I'm trying to get that done right now, but it's something I

557
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,380
think about a lot.

558
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,540
No, Lindsay, I'm going to.

559
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,740
Gamify going outside like Pokemon Go.

560
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,660
It's like that, it's like that, except that I'm going to.

561
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,660
Gamify friendship.

562
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:32,940
Yeah.

563
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,340
No, no, no.

564
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,540
We got to gamify friendship.

565
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:40,140
It's like the Starbucks app that gamifies coffee, where it's like, you get a star every

566
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,140
day you get coffee.

567
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:46,860
So we could gamify it by like, you get a star every time you like, see a person in the real

568
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,060
world.

569
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,780
Say more than 10 words to them.

570
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,460
I like it.

571
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,580
The only the only problem I have with this idea is that it's a nonprofit.

572
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,980
We need to make money, Lindsay.

573
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,700
We need to get filthy rich.

574
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,540
You.

575
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:03,140
Now I'm going to cover the cake in white fondant and roll this to an eighth of an inch

576
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,580
thickness and a little bit of powdered sugar.

577
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,580
Snow, snow, snow.

578
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,580
So you love Florence and the Machine so much.

579
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:13,300
So obviously I'm coming at this discussion both from the angle of a creator and as a

580
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:13,820
viewer.

581
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,860
Part of the reason I focused on cake decorating YouTube is not only because, you know, that's

582
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:23,300
what I watch, but because there's something that happens in media where the scenes that

583
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:27,580
are supposed to be hidden, once you see them, it's kind of hard to unsee.

584
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:31,300
Asking what Man About Cake is selling is the wrong question.

585
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,740
Man About Cake isn't trying to sell anything.

586
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:39,940
It is instead the product to be bought, which it was after that influx of VC financing in

587
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,740
2014 and the launch of Man About Cake two years later.

588
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:48,540
That was all made with an eye towards acquisition, which they were by NBCUniversal earlier

589
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:53,860
this summer, rebranding Craftsy as Blueprint on July 17th, 2018.

590
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,580
All right, now we're all covered.

591
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,500
I'm going to make some paper drawings and lyrics.

592
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:03,340
Big corporations see the value in authenticity, even manufactured authenticity like Man About

593
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,540
Cake or this.

594
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,380
Old companies will pay a lot of money for brands that can successfully sell authenticity,

595
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:14,020
and entire newer corporations have molded their marketing strategy around the faith

596
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:18,220
viewers have in the authenticity of their favorite YouTuber or their favorite podcaster.

597
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,980
Companies like Casper, Audible, and of course, Squarespace.

598
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,900
Now, I hope this doesn't come across that I'm trying to make a grand sweeping statement

599
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:30,580
about how thing bad, even though that does tend to be the most effective way to get popular

600
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:36,660
on YouTube, but rather thing exists and thing is a part of a system that you may not even

601
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,580
be conscious of.

602
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,380
But all content is cultivated.

603
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,060
No one can portray a fully lived experience on this platform.

604
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:49,500
And to paraphrase the great Dolly Parton, it takes a lot of labor to appear this

605
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,100
authentic.

606
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,580
This video was brought to you by Squarespace.

607
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:59,940
Just like URL, Squarespace dot com slash Lindsay Ellis for a free trial.

608
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:06,700
And when you're ready to launch, use the offer code Lindsay Ellis, I guess, to save 10%

609
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,260
off your first purchase of a website or domain.

610
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:14,700
We bought this URL because we were having problems with Google AdSense and my tax ID

611
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,500
number for my new corporation.

612
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,100
And so we were really angry about it.

613
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,260
So we just made a website where we just complain about things we don't like, like this

614
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,660
dog, my new neighbor.

615
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:31,100
He's getting a blog entry, free and secure hosting, nothing to upgrade ever.

616
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:37,180
You can promote your business, announce events, powerful e-commerce functionality.

617
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,060
I should try that.

618
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,380
Nothing about your neighbor's dog, though.

619
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,980
Easily create a website, make a video about it.

620
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,660
Nothing about your neighbor's dog, though.

621
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,260
Easily create a website, make it stand out.

622
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,700
It's going to be beautiful.

623
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,660
The future is coming.

624
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,140
Make it brighter with Squarespace.

625
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,100
Squarespace is coming.

626
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,740
I'm coming for this dog.
