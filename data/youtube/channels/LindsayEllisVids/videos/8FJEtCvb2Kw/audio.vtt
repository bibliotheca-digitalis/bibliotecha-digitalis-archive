WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.160
The photographic chamber of the eye, records bare painted walls, while an electric light

00:11.160 --> 00:13.960
lays the chromium nerves of plumbing raw.

00:13.960 --> 00:16.480
Such poverty assaults the ego.

00:16.480 --> 00:21.240
Caught naked in the merely actual room, the stranger in the lavatory mirror puts on a

00:21.240 --> 00:28.440
public grin, repeats our name, but scrupulously reflects the usual terror.

00:28.440 --> 00:32.880
Sylvia Plath, Tale of a Tub.

sure you subscribe to my channel.

00:58.400 --> 01:03.000
Cultural milestones come and go, but every now and then, we are privileged enough to

01:03.000 --> 01:11.800
experience something so profound and important, it not only defines a generation, it changes

01:11.800 --> 01:12.920
the world.

01:12.920 --> 01:17.120
And right now, in the era of new media, creative for streaming, online video that is still

01:17.120 --> 01:26.840
beginning to define its own identity, we can clearly pinpoint the apotheosis of generation

01:26.840 --> 01:34.600
defining web series, which intersects altruism, accessibility, technical skill, and philosophy.

01:34.600 --> 01:41.800
I'm talking, of course, about the YouTube series How to Cake It with Yolanda Gump.

01:41.800 --> 01:45.280
During the course of an episode of How to Cake It, Yolanda challenges herself with the

01:45.280 --> 01:49.980
creation of a novelty cake, usually in the shape of a real-life object, often a tie-in

01:49.980 --> 02:00.520
with a relevant pop culture artifact that she has obviously never seen, and usually

02:00.520 --> 02:10.520
draped in fondant, the most disgusting foodstuff man has yet cruelly devised.

02:10.520 --> 02:13.320
A typical How to Cake It episode goes as follows.

02:13.320 --> 02:25.840
First, Yolanda bakes her cake, usually double-digit pounds of it, then she soaks the cake in simple

02:25.840 --> 02:30.000
syrup from her tool, which her commenters have named Sir Squeeze-A-Lot, Sir Squeeze

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
for short.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.440
You can buy your very own Sir Squeeze at her website.

02:33.440 --> 02:40.480
Then she begins to ice the cake, before promoting her paid service, Camp Cake, where you can

02:40.480 --> 02:43.320
bake and decorate a cake with Yolanda in real time.

02:43.320 --> 02:48.280
Then she carves the cake into the right shape, while asking a question for you to leave a

02:48.280 --> 02:51.840
comment, which will up engagement and be more favorable to YouTube's algorithm.

02:51.840 --> 03:03.940
Then she crumb coats and chills the cake, before mentioning her t-shirt club, asking

03:03.940 --> 03:08.540
for shares, promoting her second channel, and then removing the chilled cake to do the

03:08.540 --> 03:10.000
final icing.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.520
Then she mentions her monthly sprinkle service, which you can subscribe to.

03:13.520 --> 03:17.160
Then she drapes her cake in the horrible, horrible fondant, before then reminding you

03:17.160 --> 03:21.560
to subscribe to the channel if you haven't, then the decoration begins.

03:21.560 --> 03:25.160
After which she reminds you that you can buy more of her merchandise at her website.

03:25.160 --> 03:29.720
And during the hours of meticulous decorating, she also reminds the viewer to buy her book.

03:29.720 --> 03:33.560
A tactic which only a sucker would fall for.

03:33.560 --> 03:39.360
As of August 2018, How to Cake It has amassed 3.8 million subscribers in about three years.

03:39.360 --> 03:43.480
And in that three years, the show has grown from one or two calls to action within a given

03:43.480 --> 03:47.440
episode to on average, eleven calls to action in an episode.

03:47.440 --> 03:51.160
Your average episode of How to Cake It is almost more call to action than it is cake

03:51.160 --> 03:52.440
making at this point.

03:52.440 --> 03:57.200
For those of you who are not hep to the lingo, or who have never had a social media manager

03:57.200 --> 04:02.040
of some sort, a call to action is where, in the content of a video, the host asks the

04:02.040 --> 04:07.460
viewer to do engagement with the content, in a more active way than just sitting on

04:07.460 --> 04:09.780
your ass for 11-17 minutes.

04:09.780 --> 04:19.600
This can be as small as asking me for you to smash that like button, or to ask for shares,

04:19.600 --> 04:24.600
or suggesting that you use my URL to go build your own beautiful Squarespace website.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.320
Calls to action are somewhat unique to online media.

04:27.320 --> 04:32.160
If you're hosting a cooking show on Food Network, you can't exactly ask someone to leave a comment

04:32.160 --> 04:34.160
on their cable channel.

04:34.160 --> 04:37.160
I mean, I guess you can, but...

04:37.160 --> 04:40.360
But calls to action are not completely unique to online media.

04:40.360 --> 04:44.600
One key to the popularity of RuPaul's Drag Race is their prevalence on social media,

04:44.600 --> 04:47.880
which is not only encouraged by RuPaul soliciting calls to action,

04:47.880 --> 04:53.080
I want to hear from you, the fans, who do you think deserves the crown?

04:53.080 --> 04:55.720
Are you Team Aquaria?

04:55.720 --> 04:56.720
Team Asia?

04:56.720 --> 05:00.360
but by the structure of its show lending itself to easy sharing.

05:00.360 --> 05:01.360
Not today, Satan.

05:01.360 --> 05:02.360
I'll be thirsty, bitch.

05:02.360 --> 05:03.360
Miss Vanjie.

05:03.360 --> 05:04.360
Miss Vanjie.

05:04.360 --> 05:05.360
Miss Vanjie.

05:05.360 --> 05:13.120
The secret to Yolanda's success is not, of course, the calls to action.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.800
Those gradually rose as her subscriber count did.

05:15.800 --> 05:19.560
If you look at earlier episodes of How to Cake It, you see that there are very few calls

05:19.560 --> 05:24.440
to action, and most of them are requests for likes and subscribes, with subscription services,

05:24.440 --> 05:28.520
merchandise, and camp cake being gradually added through the years and months.

05:28.520 --> 05:31.880
Early episodes are actually very conventional, and more in the vein of your typical Food

05:31.880 --> 05:32.920
Network show.

05:32.920 --> 05:37.320
But about five months after the channel launched, in the Flower Pot of Cake episode published

05:37.320 --> 05:41.520
on May 5th, 2015, a new element is introduced.

05:41.520 --> 05:48.400
Then I measure, then I measure the circumference, do I look tired?

05:48.400 --> 05:49.400
No.

05:49.400 --> 05:50.400
Circumference.

05:50.400 --> 05:55.240
The giggle you hear is the voice of producer Jocelyn Mercer, and her presence in the series,

05:55.240 --> 06:00.240
interacting with Yolanda from offscreen, only increases from here, to the point where now,

06:00.240 --> 06:01.240
it's a feature of the show.

06:01.240 --> 06:02.240
Why are they called gym leaders?

06:02.240 --> 06:07.760
I guess they're actually like in gyms, and then so you work your way through the gym.

06:07.760 --> 06:10.120
So it's a workout game.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.460
This element proves engaging, and in the following months, there's a correlation

06:13.460 --> 06:17.120
of increased interaction between the production crew and the host.

06:17.120 --> 06:20.720
In effect, Yolanda breaks down the facade that is production.

06:20.720 --> 06:23.360
She jokes with her producers, she jokes with her cameramen.

06:23.360 --> 06:28.000
Are Americans going to get mad at this?

06:28.000 --> 06:31.080
Sometimes she even jokes with her editor, who is not in the room.

06:31.080 --> 06:34.720
The series went from the occasional fourth wall breaks, to fourth wall breaks being a

06:34.720 --> 06:35.720
part of the show's identity.

06:35.720 --> 06:36.720
Ooh, that's a good one, yo.

06:36.720 --> 06:43.440
Just, if you could just pull that, yeah, yeah, perfect.

06:43.440 --> 06:47.600
Yolanda and her producers have effectively figured out not only how to market a curated

06:47.600 --> 06:51.840
version of her personality, but with how she interacts with her crew.

06:51.840 --> 06:56.120
I don't think they're as technique as the finishers, but they definitely have pins.

06:56.120 --> 06:59.160
And the interactions with the crew make the show feel more authentic.

06:59.160 --> 07:02.560
You feel like you're just, you know, in the room, hanging out, laughing about this

07:02.560 --> 07:04.680
elaborate cake that looks like a giant turkey.

07:04.680 --> 07:07.760
Now pop your turkey cake in the fridge.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.840
I'm doing way too much of this.

07:09.840 --> 07:13.600
This falls into line with the appeal of YouTube in general, that it strips away the polished

07:13.600 --> 07:16.560
facade of television to give you something more real.

07:16.560 --> 07:19.240
We should send every rapper a newsletter without this info.

07:19.240 --> 07:20.640
Just use the same word, guys.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.560
Just use the same word.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.920
Every sentence in the song ends with the same word.

07:24.920 --> 07:29.440
Yolanda can get away with her 11,000 calls to action per episode, not in spite of this

07:29.440 --> 07:32.240
fourth wall breaking format, but because of it.

07:32.240 --> 07:36.720
Owning the fact that a polished production like this is in fact a group effort, this

07:36.720 --> 07:37.720
isn't just a show.

07:37.720 --> 07:40.400
You know, we're just hanging out, laughing about this cake.

07:40.400 --> 07:41.680
We're just having fun.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.840
You must chill this cake.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.360
Thine must chill.

07:45.360 --> 07:49.400
I don't know if it's thine.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.400
I don't know.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.040
To be clear, this is not a call out.

07:52.040 --> 07:56.400
How to Cake It has a clear and effective business model, and Yolanda Gomp is both an engaging

07:56.400 --> 08:00.280
personality and a talented artist with fondant.

08:00.320 --> 08:03.880
I do find the calls to action distracting, but I loyally watch every episode of How to

08:03.880 --> 08:08.720
Cake It, and yes, I own her goddamn book, and no, I have not attempted to make a single

08:08.720 --> 08:10.600
one of these cakes.

08:10.600 --> 08:15.400
But there is something special, innovative, dare I say, lucrative, in the style and format

08:15.400 --> 08:18.000
Yolanda and her colleagues have devised.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.280
And other companies have begun to take notice.

08:21.280 --> 08:37.120
The medium is the message.

08:37.120 --> 08:42.720
YouTube was founded in 2005 by three former PayPal employees, Chad Hurley, Steve Chen,

08:42.720 --> 08:44.240
and Jawad Kareem.

08:44.240 --> 08:48.400
The idea for YouTube in part was inspired by Jawad Kareem's difficulty in finding and

08:48.400 --> 08:52.720
watching videos online of Janet Jackson having her tit exposed by Justin Timberlake during

08:52.720 --> 08:54.520
the Super Bowl halftime show.

08:54.520 --> 09:00.600
Based on a failed prior project, a video dating site called TuneInHookUp, by February of 2005,

09:00.600 --> 09:05.280
the trio had agreed to set work on the YouTube project, with Chen and Kareem taking technical

09:05.280 --> 09:09.080
duties and Hurley taking on a managerial-slash-administrative role.

09:09.080 --> 09:13.840
In April of 2005, the very first video was uploaded to YouTube, a video of Jawad hanging

09:13.840 --> 09:14.840
out at a zoo.

09:14.840 --> 09:22.840
The cool thing about these guys is that they have really, really, really long trunks.

09:22.840 --> 09:26.560
And no one ever wanted for videos of wardrobe malfunctions ever again.

09:26.560 --> 09:29.240
And that's pretty much all there is to say.

09:29.240 --> 09:31.840
So what does YouTube offer as a medium?

09:31.840 --> 09:36.480
Arguably, YouTube offers anything you want, but the platform specializes in certain niches

09:36.480 --> 09:39.960
that flourish on this platform more than they do elsewhere.

09:39.960 --> 09:50.960
TV blogs, makeup tutorials, video games, Screamer, Adder, and DIY channels make up

09:50.960 --> 09:53.280
a huge percentage of successful channels.

09:53.280 --> 09:57.520
But the form that both originated and flourished on the format and remains the most popular

09:57.520 --> 09:59.600
are the slice-of-life bloggers.

09:59.600 --> 10:04.680
To this day, the biggest channels on the platform, with the likes of Logan Paul and PewDiePie,

10:04.680 --> 10:09.040
even if they specialize in a subcategory like video games, are, in effect, slice-of-life

10:09.040 --> 10:10.040
bloggers.

10:10.040 --> 10:14.520
Fundamentally, YouTube lifts the barrier between the content creator and the viewer.

10:14.520 --> 10:18.680
Decades prior, television had come into people's homes and given us the likes of news anchors

10:18.680 --> 10:22.840
and late-night talk show hosts to provide a friendly public figure, a personality that

10:22.840 --> 10:27.640
people find recognizable, relatable, and also a bridge to the world of celebrity.

10:27.640 --> 10:29.760
But with YouTube, we strip away the artifice.

10:29.760 --> 10:33.960
Indeed, even in the name of the platform, the person uploading the video controls what

10:33.960 --> 10:35.760
goes on on their channel.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.000
YouTube is the medium of authenticity.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.160
Someone simply records a video, edits it as they please, and uploads it to their millions

10:42.160 --> 10:43.160
of subscribers.

10:43.160 --> 10:44.160
No middlemen.

10:44.160 --> 10:48.240
YouTube is the response to the demand of a younger audience, hungry for what they consider

10:48.240 --> 10:50.120
authentic.

10:50.120 --> 10:54.040
And because of this perceived authenticity, audiences give a great deal more latitude

10:54.040 --> 10:55.640
with the sale of certain things.

10:55.640 --> 10:59.280
For instance, sprinkle services and t-shirt clubs.

10:59.280 --> 11:01.800
This observation was brought to you by Squarespace.

11:01.800 --> 11:05.400
With Squarespace, you can design a beautiful website designed by professionals that know

11:05.400 --> 11:06.800
what they're doing.

11:06.800 --> 11:07.800
Not like me.

11:07.800 --> 11:11.520
But even from the beginning, there are blurred lines between slice-of-life daily vlogs and

11:11.520 --> 11:12.920
authentic fiction.

11:12.920 --> 11:16.800
One of the earliest breakthrough channels was LonelyGirl15, which launched in the summer

11:16.800 --> 11:21.280
of 2006 and was, for a time, the most-subscribed channel on YouTube.

11:21.280 --> 11:28.160
Anyway, so Daniel is really mad right now, and I don't know if he'll be allowed to come

11:28.160 --> 11:29.160
over anymore.

11:29.160 --> 11:33.960
The series initially presented as an authentic YouTube video diary, but gained even more notoriety

11:34.160 --> 11:38.160
when it was outed as being completely fictional in September of the same year.

11:38.160 --> 11:42.120
It is noteworthy that the big controversy around LonelyGirl15 was the revelation that

11:42.120 --> 11:47.240
LonelyGirl15 was, in fact, an actress, and that her daily vlogs were fictional and completely

11:47.240 --> 11:48.680
fabricated.

11:48.680 --> 11:52.840
Part of the appeal of YouTube is its perceived authenticity, but even if there is no network

11:52.840 --> 11:57.480
or middleman, everything that is uploaded to YouTube is cultivated by the creator.

11:57.480 --> 12:01.120
And is it fair, therefore, to say that what LonelyGirl15 is trying to sell you is any

12:01.120 --> 12:04.640
less authentic than Logan Paul?

12:08.640 --> 12:16.000
I guess what I wanted to ask you was why you decided to be a YouTuber.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.080
I didn't decide to be a YouTuber.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.640
Does anyone?

12:19.640 --> 12:21.920
I didn't decide to be a YouTuber.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.400
It just called to you?

12:23.400 --> 12:26.600
Well, there wasn't, no, there was, like, there were no YouTubers.

12:26.600 --> 12:27.800
It was 2007.

12:27.800 --> 12:29.760
There wasn't a such thing as a YouTuber.

12:29.760 --> 12:30.760
So here's a question.

12:30.760 --> 12:36.080
Do you, okay, so, like, the stuff you're supposed to do, like, calls to action, and do you ever

12:36.080 --> 12:39.000
consciously, like, incorporate stuff like that, like stuff that's supposed to improve

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
metrics?

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
No.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.960
I mean, the things that I do to improve metrics are, like, a good title and a good thumbnail,

12:44.960 --> 12:46.280
and I don't think beyond that.

12:46.280 --> 12:51.320
Like, the algorithm changes too much for my old man self to be trying to keep up with

12:51.320 --> 12:52.320
it.

12:52.320 --> 12:56.560
But no, I mean, I do calls to action because I want, when I want somebody to take an action.

12:56.560 --> 12:59.920
I do calls to action when PBS tells me what to say.

12:59.920 --> 13:00.920
Yeah.

13:00.920 --> 13:01.920
Yeah.

13:01.920 --> 13:05.120
And it's like, someone on Twitter actually, like, called me out on that.

13:05.120 --> 13:08.720
They were like, it's weird hearing you do a call to action.

13:08.720 --> 13:09.720
It's very not on-brand.

13:09.720 --> 13:13.440
And I'm like, uh, yep, yeah, you're right, you're right.

13:13.440 --> 13:14.440
Influencer culture.

13:14.440 --> 13:15.440
I hate that term.

13:15.440 --> 13:16.440
Yeah.

13:16.440 --> 13:17.440
I hate everything about it.

13:17.440 --> 13:21.040
Both of those words are, mean nothing.

13:21.040 --> 13:27.160
I think that you could see Squarespace.com slash Dear Hank.

13:27.160 --> 13:31.000
No, I, yeah, no, this, this video is going to be sponsored by Squarespace if they clear

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
it.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Okay.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
This video where I'm highly critical of influencer culture.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.560
Hey, I, like, if, if you're going to influence people to do something, like, you know, if

13:39.560 --> 13:44.160
you're going to have a website, you might as well use Squarespace.

13:44.160 --> 13:45.160
That's their, that's their new motto.

13:45.160 --> 13:46.160
You know what?

13:46.160 --> 13:47.160
Just fucking do it.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.160
Just stop.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.160
Squarespace.

13:49.160 --> 13:50.520
Just fucking do it.

13:50.520 --> 13:53.360
Don't try to be all fancy and shit.

13:53.360 --> 13:54.360
You don't know what you're doing.

13:54.360 --> 13:55.360
Just get a Squarespace.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.360
Come on.

13:56.360 --> 13:59.280
Um, it's good.

13:59.280 --> 14:00.280
We're really good at this.

14:00.280 --> 14:03.840
The medium is the message.

14:03.840 --> 14:08.560
See, I forgot his first name, Marshall.

14:08.560 --> 14:10.520
The medium is the message.

14:10.520 --> 14:12.520
Marshall McLuhan, 1960.

14:12.520 --> 14:13.520
What?

14:13.520 --> 14:14.520
McLuhan.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.520
McLuhan?

14:15.520 --> 14:16.520
Yeah.

14:16.520 --> 14:26.640
Around when Yolanda Gomp started using the joshing with producers gimmick, her sub started

14:26.640 --> 14:28.440
going way, way up.

14:28.440 --> 14:31.880
And by mid-2016, she's well past a million subscribers.

14:31.880 --> 14:37.880
And around this time, on July 26, 2016, venture capital-funded startup Craftsy began publishing

14:37.880 --> 14:41.320
the first episode of their own cake show.

14:41.320 --> 14:44.680
Sometimes you need more than just to know how to cake it.

14:44.680 --> 14:48.480
Sometimes you need a man about cake.

14:48.480 --> 14:51.040
Hey guys, welcome to Man About Cake.

14:51.040 --> 14:55.240
Craftsy was a startup service that specialized in hobby and lifestyle tutorials and craft

14:55.240 --> 14:59.840
education that was launched in 2011 by a bunch of former eBay executives.

14:59.840 --> 15:03.560
One of the contributors who featured in content behind this paywall was pastry chef and sugar

15:03.560 --> 15:05.280
artist Joshua John Russell.

15:05.280 --> 15:09.880
I want your stencil resting against your cake board to help make sure it doesn't shift around.

15:09.880 --> 15:13.000
who began starring in content for Craftsy in 2012.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.760
But in November of 2014, the company raised another $50 million in VC financing, and lo

15:17.760 --> 15:22.160
and behold, they got their own fancy cake show, starring Joshua John Russell, featuring

15:22.160 --> 15:25.660
drastically improved production values and a whole new format.

15:25.660 --> 15:29.560
One that seems strangely familiar.

15:29.560 --> 15:31.720
By the way, the milkman came today and dropped this on my door.

15:31.720 --> 15:34.320
I don't know why I put it in this container.

15:34.320 --> 15:37.440
Is it bad that I find that incredibly sexy?

15:37.440 --> 15:38.440
It is sexy.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.520
Sword baby is about to be born.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.520
Boom!

15:41.520 --> 15:42.520
It's a boy!

15:42.520 --> 15:43.520
It's a boy!

15:43.520 --> 15:49.440
Okay, so, if, like me, you're integrating a new cake show into your cake tube diet,

15:49.440 --> 15:54.680
one that admittedly does have more polished production values than your old hat, it may

15:54.680 --> 15:56.680
feel seamless at first.

15:56.680 --> 15:59.920
And this sort of thing is perfect for you to put on in the background of whatever it

15:59.920 --> 16:02.440
is that you're doing and not really paying attention to.

16:02.440 --> 16:07.120
But if you watch enough Man About Cake, you start to notice something.

16:07.120 --> 16:09.360
What bird did that come out of?

16:09.360 --> 16:10.560
It's like a robin's egg.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.560
No, robin's eggs are very, very pale.

16:12.560 --> 16:18.160
Oh, hey, I'm the guy that makes novelty cake t-shirts and Joshua has all of them.

16:18.160 --> 16:19.160
Our birthday.

16:19.160 --> 16:20.680
It's our birthday.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.360
It's for the viewers.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.360
These guys are miked.

16:23.360 --> 16:25.040
Uh, James, who's that guy?

16:25.040 --> 16:26.040
That's Mike.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.040
Say hi, Mike.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.040
What's up, Mike?

16:28.040 --> 16:29.040
Hello.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.040
That's a lavalier mic.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.040
Name the dragon.

16:31.040 --> 16:32.040
Go ahead, Brandon.

16:32.040 --> 16:33.560
Frank the Tank.

16:33.560 --> 16:37.040
Like the sound cop from the producers on How to Cake It is either the on-board mic

16:37.040 --> 16:39.120
or from Yolanda's lavalier mic.

16:39.120 --> 16:41.840
I'm a single mama, I'm a single mama.

16:41.840 --> 16:45.800
But on Man About Cake, everyone on the set has a lavalier mic.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.720
Like, this is a lavalier.

16:47.720 --> 16:48.720
It's not.

16:48.720 --> 16:52.400
It was a Thor joke.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.720
And then you start to notice other things, like their use of props.

16:55.720 --> 16:56.720
Dobby!

16:56.720 --> 16:57.720
Celebrate!

16:57.720 --> 16:58.720
Yay!

16:58.720 --> 16:59.720
Whoa!

16:59.720 --> 17:02.720
That was the best thing that ever happened to me.

17:02.880 --> 17:06.680
Guys, I didn't notice there were balloons right above me.

17:06.680 --> 17:08.880
Ah, balloons!

17:08.880 --> 17:10.880
Or their use of sound effects.

17:10.880 --> 17:16.320
I'm gonna, I'm gonna kill these balloons.

17:16.320 --> 17:18.360
That pop was added in post.

17:18.360 --> 17:19.360
You are fired.

17:19.360 --> 17:20.360
You're fired.

17:20.360 --> 17:21.680
Their use of relationships within the show.

17:21.680 --> 17:22.680
Trim these corn.

17:22.680 --> 17:23.680
You better watch that knife.

17:23.680 --> 17:25.320
Do you see this shirt?

17:25.320 --> 17:26.400
That does not say maybe.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.000
I will cut you.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.120
Yeah, you know, we're just some guys joshing around, just, you know, being bro-bros, making

17:32.120 --> 17:33.960
some cake, as you do.

17:33.960 --> 17:38.400
A weird and unnatural dynamic that Russell calls out in the very first episode of Man

17:38.400 --> 17:39.400
About Cake.

17:39.400 --> 17:42.920
Joining me is my all-male crew, which is not weird at all that four guys would just be

17:42.920 --> 17:45.160
hanging out talking about cake, but that's what we do.

17:45.160 --> 17:50.240
And when you spend hours watching this show, as I have, you start to realize that this

17:50.240 --> 17:54.760
wasn't just a natural dynamic between the host and the crew that eventually got incorporated

17:54.760 --> 17:57.360
into the show, like in How to Cake It.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.480
This was part of the pitch.

17:59.480 --> 18:03.800
The banner for their YouTube show isn't just the host, it's the host and these three

18:03.800 --> 18:05.820
guys facing away from the camera.

18:05.820 --> 18:10.720
You go onto their website and there are, like, bios for each of the camera guys, you know,

18:10.720 --> 18:15.520
camera guys, but they don't have surnames or any defining attributes, and their eyes

18:15.520 --> 18:18.700
are blacked out like they're in goddamn witness protection.

18:18.700 --> 18:23.540
So it's like this entire show was built around this scaffolding of bros joshing with

18:23.540 --> 18:26.240
each other while making a cake.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.440
Let's do it!

18:28.440 --> 18:32.440
Woo!

18:32.440 --> 18:34.440
That was the best thing that ever happened to me.

18:38.040 --> 18:39.720
Man About Cake?

18:39.720 --> 18:41.800
More like Man About Fake!

18:41.800 --> 18:46.080
The plan B's just like, we're done!

18:46.080 --> 18:50.680
But a YouTube show can't be like the obvious way more fake genre of reality shows.

18:50.680 --> 18:55.640
It instead has to embrace this manufactured authenticity, already pioneered by shows like

18:55.640 --> 18:56.880
How to Cake It.

18:56.880 --> 19:00.720
But here's the thing, How to Cake It has a really clear business model.

19:00.720 --> 19:04.720
Obtrusive at this point, and honestly kind of distracting, but I get it.

19:04.720 --> 19:09.680
I get why the show exists and what its business model is, and I can respect that.

19:09.680 --> 19:12.920
But Man About Cake has hardly any calls to action.

19:12.920 --> 19:17.960
Also on occasion they'll do, like, Q&As, they'll do Instagram-based contests, they'll

19:17.960 --> 19:20.080
ask for comments, but that's it.

19:20.080 --> 19:25.440
The vast, vast majority of the Man About Cake calls to action are all about building engagement.

19:25.440 --> 19:29.360
And here's the thing, Man About Cake's channel doesn't have that many more subscribers

19:29.360 --> 19:33.400
than I do, and I know what kind of money these numbers pull.

19:33.400 --> 19:36.800
Ad revenue alone cannot pay for a show that looks this nice.

19:36.800 --> 19:37.800
Mmm.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.040
Tastes like a million subscribers.

19:40.040 --> 19:45.320
And in 50-odd episodes, I still don't really understand what their business model is.

19:45.320 --> 19:48.960
What are you trying to sell, man?

19:48.960 --> 19:49.960
About cake?

19:56.440 --> 19:59.320
You're just going to get a lot of footage of me looking sad.

19:59.320 --> 20:04.720
I was hoping to get it from different angles, but...

20:04.720 --> 20:05.720
It's genuine.

20:11.720 --> 20:16.000
Literary critic Marie-Laurie Ryan states that we are more likely to be affected by what

20:16.000 --> 20:19.480
happens to people we know than by the fate of strangers.

20:19.480 --> 20:22.720
And YouTubers who have shared their lives with their subscribers for several years,

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
in hundreds, or in some cases, thousands of videos, can feel more familiar to some audiences

20:28.000 --> 20:29.800
than real-life acquaintances.

20:29.800 --> 20:34.600
As we see in reality shows, there is a viewer fascination with what Ryan calls higher cognitive

20:34.600 --> 20:38.480
emotions, i.e. shame, excitement, sadness, embarrassment.

20:38.480 --> 20:42.920
In 2007, vlogger Chris Crocker became one of the first YouTube stars with an emotional

20:42.920 --> 20:47.080
appeal defending pop singer Britney Spears, who was at the time going through a variety

20:47.080 --> 20:50.800
of personal crises and being hounded by the paparazzi and press.

20:50.880 --> 20:54.880
You're lucky she even performed for you bastards!

20:54.880 --> 20:57.880
Leave Britney alone!

20:57.880 --> 21:02.680
Part of the viral appeal to this video is, in part, that the emotions are so extreme

21:02.680 --> 21:06.600
and sincere that they push the viewer to a place of discomfort, and the best way to deal

21:06.600 --> 21:10.880
with that discomfort is to make Crocker the target of ridicule, of parody.

21:10.880 --> 21:11.880
Leave him alone!

21:11.880 --> 21:14.880
Leave Chris Crocker alone!

21:14.880 --> 21:15.880
Leave him alone!

21:15.960 --> 21:20.960
But more to the point, that the emotions, over the top that they may be, read as sincere,

21:20.960 --> 21:25.960
and in this new marketplace of YouTube, sincerity and authenticity are the valuable commodities.

21:25.960 --> 21:30.960
Reality TV was hugely popular when YouTube came onto the scene, and remains hugely popular

21:30.960 --> 21:34.960
even in a world with YouTube, but with reality TV, there is more of an understanding that

21:34.960 --> 21:37.960
there is little real in what the viewer is watching.

21:37.960 --> 21:41.960
With the medium of YouTube, the rules, that is to say, the understanding between the creator

21:41.960 --> 21:43.960
and the viewer, are a little different.

21:44.040 --> 21:48.040
The videos on your personal channel were, I guess, a little more stream-of-consciousness-y?

21:48.040 --> 21:49.040
Yeah.

21:49.040 --> 21:54.040
Yeah, just like my day at VidCon and stuff like that, whereas I guess the SciShow and

21:54.040 --> 21:58.040
stuff is obviously the most scripted, and I think the interesting thing with the stuff

21:58.040 --> 22:04.040
you do on the Vlogbrothers channel is you have a different cadence in the way that you

22:04.040 --> 22:10.040
speak, and I've noticed this, even when I was doing a Q&A, I noticed myself slipping

22:10.120 --> 22:14.120
into this cadence that I have developed, and I didn't even realize that I had developed

22:14.120 --> 22:17.120
it over the course of how many years.

22:20.120 --> 22:25.120
I have lots of friends who are YouTubers, and some of them, I'm like, you sound nothing

22:25.120 --> 22:29.120
like your YouTube self, and they're like, I don't hear, I don't have any idea what

22:29.120 --> 22:32.120
you're talking about, and it's just like, you have a different voice when you're

22:32.120 --> 22:33.120
narrating a video.

22:33.120 --> 22:34.120
It's just different.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.120
It's completely different.

22:35.200 --> 22:41.200
But some people sound exactly the same, and they make the same jokes, they make the same

22:41.200 --> 22:43.200
facial expressions, nothing is different.

22:43.200 --> 22:49.200
I think usually when people meet me, they're surprised that I'm short, and that I compulsively

22:49.200 --> 22:51.200
apologize for existing.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.200
Which you don't do in your videos.

22:53.200 --> 22:57.200
No, no, because people kind of have, even my friends are like, wow, you just seem like

22:57.200 --> 22:58.200
such a hard-ass.

22:58.200 --> 23:02.200
Yeah, you're competitive in the videos, and in real life, you are not.

23:02.280 --> 23:05.280
I don't know, I don't think I am competitive in videos.

23:05.280 --> 23:11.280
I think it's just because I'm a woman, and speaking with any kind of confidence feels

23:11.280 --> 23:12.280
aggressive.

23:12.280 --> 23:13.280
That is true.

23:13.280 --> 23:15.280
Yeah, no, you're not wrong.

23:20.280 --> 23:25.280
The term emotional labor comes from Arlie Hochschild in her book, The Managed Heart,

23:25.280 --> 23:29.280
and was her contribution to discussions of effective and immaterial labor.

23:29.360 --> 23:34.360
According to Hochschild, emotional labor requires one to induce or suppress feeling in order

23:34.360 --> 23:38.360
to sustain the outward countenance that produces the proper state of mind in others.

23:38.360 --> 23:43.360
Her research found that in working with affect, managing one's emotions, can be physically

23:43.360 --> 23:48.360
tiring in the same way that manual labor is, and that the commodification of emotion estranges

23:48.360 --> 23:50.360
workers from their own feelings.

23:50.360 --> 23:54.360
More attention has been paid in recent years to emotional labor in a context of intimate

23:54.440 --> 23:58.440
relationships, i.e., the idea that romantic relationships, the onus falls more on women

23:58.440 --> 24:01.440
to manage the emotions both of herself and of her partner.

24:01.440 --> 24:06.440
But Hochschild was more interested in emotional labor as it pertains to a capitalist commodity.

24:06.440 --> 24:12.440
In Hochschild's analysis, not only is seeming to love the job part of the job, but actually

24:12.440 --> 24:17.440
trying to love it, and to enjoy the customers, helps the worker in this effort, as they are

24:17.440 --> 24:21.440
not simply faking it, but they come to believe and internalize what they are doing for the

24:21.440 --> 24:22.440
job.

24:22.520 --> 24:28.520
What is critical to her analysis is when this is done for and guided by capital.

24:28.520 --> 24:30.520
It's kind of strategic.

24:30.520 --> 24:34.520
You want someone to have a reason to come back and watch your video?

24:34.520 --> 24:40.520
I think a lot of content, you actually end up with it being a one-off viral video, and

24:40.520 --> 24:44.520
I'm watching this because I like the video, like, because it's a good, funny video.

24:44.520 --> 24:45.520
Yeah.

24:45.520 --> 24:46.520
It had a puppy in it.

24:46.520 --> 24:50.520
Yeah, and if you don't get connected to a personality, then, like, the chances that

24:50.600 --> 24:53.600
you're going to come back for a second video is way, way down.

24:53.600 --> 24:58.600
So, trying to figure out how to connect with a personality without connecting your whole

24:58.600 --> 25:02.600
life experience, without sharing everything, is a really tricky balance.

25:02.600 --> 25:09.600
How has your approach to selling a version of yourself changed since you started?

25:09.600 --> 25:12.600
I, uh...

25:15.600 --> 25:16.600
Is that too broad a question?

25:16.600 --> 25:17.600
No, it's not.

25:17.680 --> 25:21.680
It's just like I'm trying to come to terms with the version of myself that I am on the

25:21.680 --> 25:22.680
internet.

25:22.680 --> 25:27.680
I think that, ultimately, I think that it's really hard to have that version of myself

25:27.680 --> 25:30.680
not also infect the real me.

25:30.680 --> 25:35.680
And so, in this weird way, where I've been held accountable to being a better person

25:35.680 --> 25:41.680
on the internet, I also just find that it is more comfortable for me to be a better

25:41.760 --> 25:47.760
person in real life, and to be really thoughtful and careful, and aware of the impacts I'm

25:47.760 --> 25:48.760
having on other people.

25:48.760 --> 25:53.760
But there is no doubt that I am a different person on the internet than I am in real life,

25:53.760 --> 25:55.760
and that I am very careful.

25:55.760 --> 25:57.760
And I don't think that there's anything inauthentic about that.

25:57.760 --> 26:04.760
I am the version of myself that I need to be for my own mental health, but also for

26:04.760 --> 26:07.760
the impact that I'm going to have on the people who are watching.

26:11.760 --> 26:21.760
Every job, to a certain extent, requires maintaining a certain affect.

26:21.760 --> 26:26.760
But, there are a number of jobs in which maintaining a certain affect is a requirement of the position.

26:26.760 --> 26:30.760
If you are a cast member who works at Disneyland, a requirement of the position is to maintain

26:30.760 --> 26:31.760
a friendly affect.

26:31.760 --> 26:36.240
It is in your job description to make the customer feel special, and to induce a feeling

26:36.240 --> 26:37.240
of happiness.

26:37.240 --> 26:41.440
Now, anyone who interacts with a waitress or a Disneyland cast member while they appreciate

26:41.440 --> 26:45.920
and expect to receive this affect, don't actually believe that this affect is genuine

26:45.920 --> 26:47.240
all of the time.

26:47.240 --> 26:50.320
The bartender at the P.F. Chang's doesn't actually care about how you never see your

26:50.320 --> 26:54.040
husband, and how YouTube comments are scary and overwhelming, and how you're pretty sure

26:54.040 --> 26:57.520
that the guy who sends you these novel-length screeds about how feminists are ruining society

26:57.520 --> 27:01.360
and he's going to kill himself and you and probably ten dozen other people, is probably

27:01.360 --> 27:04.720
actually going to kill you someday.

27:04.720 --> 27:08.280
YouTubers are selling more than a service, like the bartender or the cast member.

27:08.280 --> 27:12.640
The product that YouTubers, Twitch streamers, and other influencers sell is almost exclusively

27:12.640 --> 27:16.440
affect, and this is a form of emotional labor.

27:16.440 --> 27:21.320
More and more discussion has turned to creator burnout, but most of that has focused on consistency,

27:21.320 --> 27:22.320
maintaining a schedule.

27:22.320 --> 27:25.680
Little of that discussion has focused on the emotional burden of maintaining the affect

27:25.680 --> 27:27.920
associated with the creator's brand.

27:27.920 --> 27:31.960
Over time, little tiny micro-traumas can build up as a result of a person behaving in a way

27:31.960 --> 27:36.320
that does not reflect their emotional truth, but more importantly, that their livelihood

27:36.320 --> 27:37.600
depends on.

27:37.600 --> 27:41.560
And on some level, a part of burnout is the desire to rebel against this one-sided picture

27:41.560 --> 27:45.040
of yourself that you have painted in the interest of consistency.

27:45.040 --> 27:49.240
Some extreme examples of this are high-profile YouTubers and streamers letting racial slurs

27:49.240 --> 27:53.440
slip into their speech, or going onto other people's streams to rant about how immigrants

27:53.440 --> 27:54.600
are bad.

27:54.600 --> 27:58.920
Or maybe they got drunk in public and had a run-in with the police.

27:58.920 --> 27:59.920
It happens.

27:59.920 --> 28:04.960
I don't mean to condone random acts of racial slurs that occur during heated gaming moments,

28:05.280 --> 28:09.160
but rather suggest that a part of the burnout is a result not only of YouTube's algorithm

28:09.160 --> 28:14.000
placing priority on creators who upload regularly and homogeneously, but also on the emotional

28:14.000 --> 28:17.680
labor of only showing the side of yourself that your audience wants to buy.

28:17.680 --> 28:20.840
We acknowledge that people working in the service industry don't always do it for the

28:20.840 --> 28:21.840
love of the game.

28:21.840 --> 28:25.360
A cast member at Disneyland probably works there in part because they like being nice

28:25.360 --> 28:26.360
to people.

28:26.360 --> 28:30.760
But we also accept that the affect is a part of their job, not necessarily their inner-lived

28:30.760 --> 28:31.760
truth.

28:31.760 --> 28:36.120
But there's very little sympathy for a high-profile creator who isn't 100% grateful for their

28:36.120 --> 28:38.640
platform 100% of the time.

28:38.640 --> 28:42.640
When the same basic idea for YouTubers comes up, that they sometimes are afraid of their

28:42.640 --> 28:47.280
fans, that maintaining an on-brand affect becomes draining and exhausting, that the

28:47.280 --> 28:52.520
expectation of constant availability can begin to do real harm, well, that becomes a breach

28:52.520 --> 28:54.920
of trust that the creator had with his community.

28:54.920 --> 28:59.200
A part of the platform of YouTube, what some would call influencer culture, is that it's

28:59.200 --> 29:03.280
important for creators that their audience think they know you, and that your job depends

29:03.280 --> 29:07.800
on maintaining that sense of accessibility and authenticity without going crazy.

29:07.800 --> 29:12.620
The premium of authenticity is predicated on maintaining that the affect is convincing.

29:12.620 --> 29:16.080
The challenge for creators is to maintain the illusion for their followers of feeling

29:16.080 --> 29:21.000
like they do know this creator, when in reality, they only know the affect, the construct,

29:21.000 --> 29:24.480
the side of the creator that the creator, most likely without their making a conscious

29:24.480 --> 29:29.860
decision to do so, has decided it is most beneficial for you, the audience, to see.

29:29.860 --> 29:34.280
It is impossible to have a personal connection to a giant, faceless mass of people who are,

29:34.280 --> 29:39.680
in effect, your customers, and when the deception becomes clear, fans can get angry.

29:39.680 --> 29:44.160
But lucky for me, I don't have to worry about you guys.

29:44.160 --> 29:46.160
You're the good ones.

29:46.160 --> 29:59.160
I remember this very brief conversation you and I had at VidCon, where you were talking

29:59.160 --> 30:05.960
about making this video where you asked YouTubers kind of random trivia questions, and I was

30:05.960 --> 30:09.320
like, oh man, I'm so sorry.

30:09.320 --> 30:12.360
I hate that you had to do that while you're here, and you're like, no, I actually look

30:12.360 --> 30:13.640
forward to it.

30:13.640 --> 30:22.040
It's like my one creative outlet, and that kind of surprised me because I so see anything

30:22.040 --> 30:24.320
that I put on YouTube as just work.

30:24.320 --> 30:28.080
Sometimes it's gratifying work, but at the end of the day, it's just work to me.

30:28.080 --> 30:29.080
Yeah.

30:29.080 --> 30:30.080
No.

30:30.080 --> 30:37.320
I mean, like, making a video is not, I mean, I don't know what work is.

30:37.320 --> 30:39.360
I don't know what work is anymore.

30:39.360 --> 30:41.460
I don't know what relaxing is.

30:41.460 --> 30:48.060
I don't know, like, I don't, I don't, I don't really know, I don't know how to do it really

30:48.060 --> 30:49.060
well.

30:49.060 --> 30:50.060
Like, I have a hard time.

30:50.060 --> 30:54.580
I sometimes have a hard time, like, being, like, going to just like a gathering of friends

30:54.580 --> 30:58.820
and not, you know, thinking about how could my time be better spent.

30:58.820 --> 31:02.900
So I, like, I do have that problem, but I do really like making YouTube videos.

31:02.900 --> 31:05.100
Like, I love to edit video.

31:05.100 --> 31:07.540
I love to, I love to be on camera.

31:07.540 --> 31:08.540
I love to write.

31:08.540 --> 31:10.420
I love the whole process coming together.

31:10.420 --> 31:12.860
I love how fast it can happen.

31:12.860 --> 31:15.700
I'm very glad that I have this thing that I get to do every week.

31:15.700 --> 31:16.700
Yeah.

31:16.700 --> 31:20.740
And in a perfect world, what would your positive impact be?

31:20.740 --> 31:26.780
I want people to smile and be happy and, and, like, think that that was a fun experience.

31:26.780 --> 31:28.340
One.

31:28.340 --> 31:33.900
I want people to, like, get excited about the universe and the world and, like, how

31:33.900 --> 31:38.980
cool and weird and, like, thinking critically and hard about stuff.

31:38.980 --> 31:48.740
More and more, like, I want to foster some kind of better communication and among people

31:48.740 --> 31:54.140
and, and also more and more, I feel like that that that needs to happen a lot more off of

31:54.140 --> 31:56.060
the internet than is happening now.

31:56.060 --> 32:05.780
I think that we need to have more physical connection or else we will continue to become

32:05.780 --> 32:06.780
more lonely.

32:06.780 --> 32:12.140
And we need to occupy the same physical space as other human beings.

32:12.140 --> 32:18.220
So my hope is also that people find community and connection that can grow outside of and

32:18.220 --> 32:22.180
be larger than just the internet.

32:22.180 --> 32:25.220
And I don't really know how I'm trying to get that done right now, but it's something I

32:25.220 --> 32:26.380
think about a lot.

32:26.380 --> 32:27.540
No, Lindsay, I'm going to.

32:27.540 --> 32:29.740
Gamify going outside like Pokemon Go.

32:29.740 --> 32:31.660
It's like that, it's like that, except that I'm going to.

32:31.660 --> 32:32.660
Gamify friendship.

32:32.660 --> 32:32.940
Yeah.

32:32.940 --> 32:33.340
No, no, no.

32:33.340 --> 32:34.540
We got to gamify friendship.

32:34.540 --> 32:40.140
It's like the Starbucks app that gamifies coffee, where it's like, you get a star every

32:40.140 --> 32:41.140
day you get coffee.

32:41.140 --> 32:46.860
So we could gamify it by like, you get a star every time you like, see a person in the real

32:46.860 --> 32:47.060
world.

32:47.060 --> 32:48.780
Say more than 10 words to them.

32:48.940 --> 32:49.460
I like it.

32:49.460 --> 32:52.580
The only the only problem I have with this idea is that it's a nonprofit.

32:52.580 --> 32:53.980
We need to make money, Lindsay.

32:53.980 --> 32:55.700
We need to get filthy rich.

32:56.140 --> 32:56.540
You.

33:00.180 --> 33:03.140
Now I'm going to cover the cake in white fondant and roll this to an eighth of an inch

33:03.180 --> 33:04.580
thickness and a little bit of powdered sugar.

33:04.580 --> 33:06.580
Snow, snow, snow.

33:06.580 --> 33:08.580
So you love Florence and the Machine so much.

33:08.580 --> 33:13.300
So obviously I'm coming at this discussion both from the angle of a creator and as a

33:13.300 --> 33:13.820
viewer.

33:13.820 --> 33:17.860
Part of the reason I focused on cake decorating YouTube is not only because, you know, that's

33:17.860 --> 33:23.300
what I watch, but because there's something that happens in media where the scenes that

33:23.300 --> 33:27.580
are supposed to be hidden, once you see them, it's kind of hard to unsee.

33:28.420 --> 33:31.300
Asking what Man About Cake is selling is the wrong question.

33:31.540 --> 33:33.740
Man About Cake isn't trying to sell anything.

33:34.020 --> 33:39.940
It is instead the product to be bought, which it was after that influx of VC financing in

33:39.940 --> 33:42.740
2014 and the launch of Man About Cake two years later.

33:43.180 --> 33:48.540
That was all made with an eye towards acquisition, which they were by NBCUniversal earlier

33:48.540 --> 33:53.860
this summer, rebranding Craftsy as Blueprint on July 17th, 2018.

33:54.700 --> 33:55.580
All right, now we're all covered.

33:55.580 --> 33:57.500
I'm going to make some paper drawings and lyrics.

33:58.420 --> 34:03.340
Big corporations see the value in authenticity, even manufactured authenticity like Man About

34:03.340 --> 34:05.540
Cake or this.

34:06.140 --> 34:10.380
Old companies will pay a lot of money for brands that can successfully sell authenticity,

34:10.660 --> 34:14.020
and entire newer corporations have molded their marketing strategy around the faith

34:14.020 --> 34:18.220
viewers have in the authenticity of their favorite YouTuber or their favorite podcaster.

34:18.460 --> 34:21.980
Companies like Casper, Audible, and of course, Squarespace.

34:22.300 --> 34:25.900
Now, I hope this doesn't come across that I'm trying to make a grand sweeping statement

34:25.940 --> 34:30.580
about how thing bad, even though that does tend to be the most effective way to get popular

34:30.580 --> 34:36.660
on YouTube, but rather thing exists and thing is a part of a system that you may not even

34:36.660 --> 34:37.580
be conscious of.

34:37.980 --> 34:40.380
But all content is cultivated.

34:40.700 --> 34:44.060
No one can portray a fully lived experience on this platform.

34:44.420 --> 34:49.500
And to paraphrase the great Dolly Parton, it takes a lot of labor to appear this

34:49.500 --> 34:50.100
authentic.

34:50.860 --> 34:53.580
This video was brought to you by Squarespace.

34:54.420 --> 34:59.940
Just like URL, Squarespace dot com slash Lindsay Ellis for a free trial.

35:00.260 --> 35:06.700
And when you're ready to launch, use the offer code Lindsay Ellis, I guess, to save 10%

35:06.700 --> 35:09.260
off your first purchase of a website or domain.

35:09.740 --> 35:14.700
We bought this URL because we were having problems with Google AdSense and my tax ID

35:14.700 --> 35:16.500
number for my new corporation.

35:16.500 --> 35:18.100
And so we were really angry about it.

35:18.100 --> 35:22.260
So we just made a website where we just complain about things we don't like, like this

35:22.260 --> 35:24.660
dog, my new neighbor.

35:26.180 --> 35:31.100
He's getting a blog entry, free and secure hosting, nothing to upgrade ever.

35:31.420 --> 35:37.180
You can promote your business, announce events, powerful e-commerce functionality.

35:37.180 --> 35:38.060
I should try that.

35:38.340 --> 35:40.380
Nothing about your neighbor's dog, though.

35:40.700 --> 35:42.980
Easily create a website, make a video about it.

35:42.980 --> 35:44.660
Nothing about your neighbor's dog, though.

35:45.020 --> 35:47.260
Easily create a website, make it stand out.

35:47.580 --> 35:48.700
It's going to be beautiful.

35:49.540 --> 35:50.660
The future is coming.

35:50.660 --> 35:53.140
Make it brighter with Squarespace.

35:55.660 --> 35:57.100
Squarespace is coming.

35:57.460 --> 35:58.740
I'm coming for this dog.
