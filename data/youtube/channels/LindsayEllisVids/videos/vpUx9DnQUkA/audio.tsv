0	5000	So, for some reason, I get more requests for this movie than for any other movie?
7000	8000	Okay!
8000	12000	Jean Cocteau's 1946 black and white classic, La Belle et la BÃªte,
12000	16000	famously opens with an appeal to viewers asking them to open their hearts and minds
16000	18000	to the innocent and magical worldview of a child,
18000	21000	to allow themselves to believe that castles can be enchanted,
21000	25000	and that, yes, the heart of a man can beat beneath the hide of a beast.
25000	29000	Well, I did some digging, and it turns out that the live-action Beauty and the Beast
29000	32000	originally had an homage to Cocteau's opening for their 2017 remake
32000	35000	of the original Disney animated classic.
35000	36000	It said,
36000	40000	We invite you to open your hearts and minds to the magical worldview of pedantic nitpickers
40000	45000	who point out plot holes and fairy tales, which we are now kowtowing to, apparently.
45000	48000	Here's a movie for you, guy who kept pointing out that, according to math,
48000	50000	the prince was only 11 when he got turned into a beast.
50000	52000	That's pretty messed up, right?
52000	53000	That's not logical.
53000	55000	Open your heart like the pedantic f*** who opines,
55000	57000	Now let the toon forget that the monarch had disappeared.
57000	59000	Plot hole ting!
60000	61000	Wow.
61000	62000	I hate it.
62000	66000	So apparently the intent with the remake of Disney's animated classic Beauty and the Beast
66000	69000	was to respond to every bad faith criticism lobbed at the original.
69000	72000	Like, well, why were the servants enchanted, too?
72000	73000	They didn't do anything wrong.
73000	75000	And Belle's not feminist enough.
75000	79000	Make that she reads an active, active transgression against the patriarchy.
79000	83000	Teaching another girl to read isn't one enough.
83000	86000	And give her an invention subplot that goes nowhere.
86000	89000	Effectively, Disney has gone and made a movie which differs in content
89000	93000	only in that it appears to exist to appease the pedantic f***s of YouTube
93000	95000	with their decades of bad faith criticism.
95000	98000	And for ever having enabled that atmosphere of pedantic f***ery
98000	101000	that led to the creation of a film that goes out of its way to address
101000	103000	the plot holes of the film that it is based on,
103000	106000	I will never cease my penance walk.
106000	110000	But I am going to complain about this movie for a really long time, so strap in.
111000	113000	It's important to contextualize this movie in the trend
113000	117000	that it is the current apotheosis of, that being, Disney live-action remakes.
117000	121000	And these live-action remakes seem to pose themselves not as simple remakes,
121000	124000	but as responses to criticisms of the films that they are remaking.
124000	127000	For Maleficent, it posits that Maleficent was misunderstood
127000	129000	and that the narrator of the original movie was unreliable.
129000	132000	For The Jungle Book, it posits that, hey, maybe Shere Khan had a point
132000	134000	and Mowgli is dangerous.
134000	137000	But for Beauty and the Beast, the response seems to be fixing plot holes
137000	139000	that weren't actually problems or plot holes to begin with,
139000	144000	and you may be asking yourself, is this really an overlong, nitpicky, complainy video
144000	147000	complaining about how overlong, nitpicky clickbait film criticism
147000	151000	has influenced the actual text in the current trend of live-action Disney remakes?
153000	154000	Yes.
163000	166000	We begin not with the bad bitch who got this party started Maleficent,
166000	168000	nor the original animated Beauty and the Beast,
168000	171000	nor even the evil genius current CEO of the Disney Company,
171000	174000	aka boringly competent daddy Bob Iger,
174000	177000	it starts with the Robert Moses of the Disney Company,
177000	179000	daddy of daddies Michael Eisner.
179000	182000	Because important to remember is that Michael Eisner was Bob Iger's mentor
182000	184000	in the 1990s and early 2000s,
184000	187000	and that the reason Iger had the opportunity to enjoy this long run
187000	190000	as CEO of the Disney Company was because of his unwavering
190000	194000	failty to the Regina, Georgia, Hollywood CEOs, Michael Eisner.
194000	197000	In a 1981 letter, Eisner wrote to Paramount executives
197000	200000	before he jumped ship to become CEO of the Disney Company,
200000	203000	he penned what is widely considered to be his ethos
203000	206000	and possibly the most 1980s thing ever written.
228000	231000	This was an ethos carried through to his time at Disney.
231000	235000	That said, Eisner was also super cognizant of the value of brand prestige,
235000	238000	and ironically in his earlier years he was super resistant
238000	241000	to the whole concept of releasing Disney classics onto VHS,
241000	245000	as this, he worried, would lower the prestige of the brand.
245000	248000	But boy did he change his tune when Pinocchio,
248000	252000	the first release to VHS because it was considered lower rung among the classics,
252000	254000	sold out of its first run.
254000	258000	Lesson learned here, repackaging Disney classics is a safe, lucrative bet.
258000	261000	This would reach its apotheosis with the downright parodic phase
261000	264000	of direct-to-video sequels, producing such classics as
264000	266000	The Hunchback of Notre Dame 2,
270000	272000	The Fox and the Hound 2,
272000	275000	and Cinderella 3, A Twist in Time.
275000	278000	The best one of this lot, yes I will stand by that,
278000	280000	I have seen them all because of the f***ing course I have.
285000	288000	During this era we also saw the expansion of Disney Renaissance properties
288000	292000	adapted for Broadway. This became a trend that continues to this day.
292000	295000	In the 90s we saw Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, and...
295000	296000	Aida?
296000	299000	Yeah, that was a Disney joint. Okay.
303000	305000	But the thing that we are presently living through
305000	308000	was not the first attempt at repackaging Disney classics for live action.
308000	313000	Seeing the success of properties like Beauty and the Beast on Broadway and VHS sales,
313000	316000	Eisner took an eye towards live action remakes of animated classics,
316000	319000	beginning with The Jungle Book in 1994.
319000	321000	This one had a sexy Mowgli.
321000	327000	But Eisner's real event was 101 Dalmatians in 1996 starring Glenn Close.
327000	329000	I've no use for babies.
330000	333000	Both of these movies did okay?
333000	336000	101 Dalmatians did really pretty well,
336000	339000	breaking in $136 million in domestic box office grosses
339000	342000	and unleashing an avalanche of plush dogs in other merchandise
342000	344000	and eventually garnering a sequel.
344000	347000	During this period there were also remakes of old live action movies
347000	349000	like The Parent Trap starring Lindsay Lohan,
349000	351000	which unexpectedly grossed $92 million,
351000	354000	proving that there was indeed a market for this sort of thing.
354000	356000	But these were not huge successes,
356000	360000	and after event movie Pearl Harbor was eviscerated by critics,
360000	364000	Eisner became much more bearish on the whole concept of event movies in general.
364000	369000	Movies like The Jungle Book 94 and 101 Dalmatians didn't really start a trend
369000	374000	where newer films like Maleficent and Cinderella of 2015 did.
374000	377000	The final element to the formation of this version of Beauty and the Beast
377000	379000	is one we can't really pin on Eisner,
379000	383000	and that is the recent trend for Disney movies to make metatextual commentary
383000	386000	on the Disney company and the Disney brand in general.
386000	387000	It's there in Moana.
387000	391000	If you wear a dress and you have an animal sidekick, you're a princess.
391000	395000	It's there in Enchanted, like the whole movie.
395000	397000	And Dear God, Frozen.
398000	400000	It's true love.
400000	403000	Audiences love it when Disney knowingly pokes fun at itself.
403000	405000	Do animals talk to you?
405000	406000	No.
406000	407000	Were you poisoned?
407000	408000	No.
408000	409000	Cursed?
409000	410000	No.
410000	411000	Kidnapped or enslaved?
411000	412000	No.
412000	413000	Are you guys okay?
413000	414000	Should I call the police?
414000	416000	And they really loved it with Beauty and the Beast, didn't they?
416000	417000	I'm talking to the candle.
417000	418000	Candelabra.
418000	419000	Thanks, I hate it.
419000	423000	Eisner's story as CEO of the Disney company is very much a mixed bag.
423000	425000	He oversaw the success of the Disney Renaissance, yes,
425000	429000	but he was also responsible for a string of acquisitions and bad ideas,
429000	433000	which could take up many, many, many episodes, but I'm not going into here.
433000	437000	Eisner certainly took to heart Eisner's wisdom of not being obligated to make art or history,
437000	440000	but to make money, which manifested as safe investments.
440000	445000	But Eisner invests safely, and much bigger than Eisner ever did.
445000	450000	As a result, Disney's stock has quadrupled in value since Eisner's departure in 2005.
450000	455000	Eisner in 2018 is able to execute Eisner's vision of repackaging Disney properties for live action
455000	460000	without making the brand feel cheap like Eisner eventually would with his reliance on direct-to-video sequels.
460000	466000	In effect, Eisner has mastered what the Disney company refers to internally as brand integrity.
466000	470000	And moreover, the Disney company under Eisner has figured out the secret ingredient.
470000	475000	It's not enough to just do a live-action remake of a beloved classic starring Glenn Close.
475000	479000	New live-action Disney needs to be metatextually responding to some criticism
479000	484000	of either the Disney company, the brand, or of the property it is remaking.
484000	488000	So now we know how we got here, let's take a look at what we got.
496000	500000	In my grand tradition of flaccid attempts to be balanced,
500000	504000	I'm going to first try to list the things I don't hate.
504000	506000	But I gotta be honest, there's not much here.
506000	509000	At least Phantom of the Opera had Patrick Wilson in Mini Driver.
509000	513000	Okay, I am going to find some stuff I don't hate. Let's see, there's gotta be some stuff.
513000	518000	Okay, Lumiere and Cogsworth have a different dynamic in the remake than they do in the original.
518000	522000	Rather than them squabbling and Cogsworth constantly trying to restrain Lumiere,
522000	527000	here they don't really fight and Cogsworth wants to stand up to the beast.
527000	529000	You can't talk to us like that, I forbid it.
529000	532000	And Lumiere's kind of trying to help him with that.
532000	538000	Of course, that doesn't really go anywhere. Cogsworth never does stand up to the beast,
538000	543000	so it's an arc that is added with no payoff. It's different.
543000	547000	I mean, it's not good, but I guess I don't hate it. But we still had to know homo.
553000	554000	God, this is hard.
554000	559000	Tooch and Audra McDonald love those two, don't love the characters,
559000	563000	they are superfluous and add nothing, but I always love me some Tooch.
563000	568000	And Audra McDonald should just be in more everything, so, sure.
568000	574000	Um, this owl? Damn, that is a sweet owl. Love that owl.
574000	578000	Oh, and Kevin Kline? Okay, this is actually one change I unambiguously like.
578000	583000	Like turning Maurice from an infantilized man-baby into a gentle, sensitive clockmaker.
583000	586000	And Kline sells it. That actually really, really works.
586000	587000	It's alright.
589000	591000	And... that's it.
595000	600000	The original DVD release of Beauty and the Beast in 1991 included a commentary track
600000	605000	in which directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale and producer Don Hahn were already audibly frustrated
605000	609000	with people trying to over-explain and outsmart the logic of an enchanted castle.
609000	612000	The most relevant bit that sticks out in my mind is where they try to explain,
612000	618000	or rather, kind of infer they shouldn't have to explain, the internal logic of Be Our Guest.
618000	623000	Every piece of flatware doesn't necessarily have a corresponding human equivalent,
623000	627000	but it was a lot more fun to have dancing flatware and dancing silverware.
627000	632000	Like, it's an enchanted castle. Ergo, the stuff in it is also enchanted.
632000	636000	That doesn't mean that everything that moves in the castle has a one-to-one human equivalent.
636000	640000	But because one of the selling points of this movie is the over-explanation of everything,
640000	642000	everything needs to be explained in the dialogue.
642000	644000	I'm talking to a candle.
644000	646000	Candelabra, please.
646000	649000	Yep, that's weird. Glad you pointed out how unlikely that is
649000	653000	so I can take off the million layers of logic armor in which I have adorned myself
653000	655000	so that I can suspend my disbelief.
655000	658000	We can't leave things to people's imaginations.
658000	660000	Then they might go make an internet about it.
660000	664000	See, it's stuff like this that legit sucks the magic out of parables and fairy tales.
664000	669000	But it needs to be explained to modern audiences that no, not every object in the castle has a human corollary.
669000	672000	Hello. What's your name?
672000	675000	That is a hairbrush.
675000	677000	Like Madame Craper, the helpful toilet.
677000	679000	Hello. What's your name?
679000	682000	My belt. Your dress, it is stuck in your belt.
682000	686000	Oh, don't worry. It happened to me all the time back when I had legs.
686000	690000	An even more frustrating addition is that the movie explains that, yeah,
690000	696000	the servants in the castle see themselves as kind of on the hook for the beast being a jerk.
696000	699000	You see, when the master lost his mother
699000	703000	and his cruel father took that sweet innocent lad
703000	708000	and twisted him up to be just like him, we did nothing.
708000	712000	Well, my dear, we were kind of enablers.
712000	716000	This is like victims of abuse saying they had it coming and it was their fault
716000	718000	because they shouldn't have made him mad.
718000	721000	We've made our bed and we must lie in it.
721000	726000	I understand that movie nitpicks.com has some complaints about us being punished
726000	730000	for the actions of a ten-year-old, but you see, my dear,
730000	734000	there's a perfectly logical explanation for that too.
734000	737000	This is another addition that gets dragged out
737000	741000	because there's also the added element that the beast's parents were neglectful and shitty
741000	744000	and the staff knew, but they didn't really do anything because it was, you know,
744000	747000	an absolute f***ing monarchy, but whatever.
747000	750000	They see themselves as kind of deserving of their punishment
750000	753000	because they didn't help the prince be better when they had a chance,
753000	755000	so we're clocks now.
755000	757000	Thanks, I hate it.
757000	763000	But the overwritten thing I hate the most is when the staff of the castle just explains the plot to Belle.
763000	765000	What happens when the last petal falls?
765000	770000	The master remains a beast forever and we become antiques.
770000	774000	Another major change in this version was adding more stakes to certain aspects of the plot,
774000	777000	which, you know, in theory, fine.
777000	781000	Instead of the rose falling apart, now the entire castle is falling apart.
781000	784000	It's not just the possibility of everyone remaining as they are for all time.
784000	788000	The staff are becoming more and more inanimate as they inch closer to Rose McGeddon,
788000	792000	which I grew three more feathers and I just plucked yesterday.
792000	796000	You know, again, fine. Not the worst thing ever as it adds clearer stakes.
796000	799000	But this adds to the problem as by adding these higher stakes,
799000	803000	they don't account for plot elements that they do keep from the original animated movie.
803000	808000	Namely, the punishment of basically condemning his entire castle of ceasing to exist
808000	811000	doesn't really jive with his decision to let Belle go.
811000	813000	I let her go.
813000	816000	What? Master, how could you do that?
816000	819000	Adding more stakes around the staff adds a whole host of problems.
819000	823000	Namely, turning the beast's lack of concern for his staff from anger management problems
823000	827000	and general immaturity into being actually morally reprehensible.
827000	829000	I set her free.
830000	833000	I'm sorry I couldn't do the same for all of you.
833000	837000	I guess. Boss of the year. Sorry, cave daddy.
837000	842000	So adding these higher stakes kind of zaps the meaning from the moment where he decides to let Belle go.
842000	846000	It turns the beast's decision from a moment of personal growth into a trolley problem.
846000	851000	Whose life matters more, Maurice or every living being in the goddamn castle?
851000	856000	In this version, the beast letting Belle go is no longer him placing Belle's needs in front of his own,
856000	861000	but instead deciding that Maurice's life is worth more than everyone in the castle, who he has now doomed to death.
861000	864000	Point being here that the movie wanted to up the stakes. Fine.
864000	868000	But it fundamentally changed what is supposed to be the emotional core of the story.
868000	872000	That being beast's growth as a person who can put other people's needs before his own.
872000	875000	Because this rubs up against the whole thrust of the story,
875000	880000	the higher stakes kind of necessitates that the enchanted objects explain their plight to Belle.
880000	882000	What happens when the last petal falls?
882000	887000	The master remains a beast forever, and we become antiques.
887000	892000	Yes, logically it would make sense for Lumiere Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts to do this,
892000	895000	but it diminishes what should be the emotional core of the story.
895000	899000	That Belle develops these feelings on her own terms, in her own time.
899000	901000	She doesn't do it because their fucking lives on the line.
901000	905000	She does it because she falls in love with him because he begins to live as his best self,
905000	911000	not because of a trolley problem, which she proceeds to ignore anyway because Maurice needs help.
911000	915000	And while we're here on the topic of terrible editing, what is this?
915000	919000	Chip! Have you seen Chip? He ran off!
919000	920000	Oh no.
920000	921000	Mom!
921000	924000	What was Chip jumping from?
924000	930000	Why is this happening? Was this scene really in need of more stakes out of nowhere?
930000	931000	Oh no.
931000	932000	Mom!
932000	935000	If I can't live as a cop, I'll die as a cop.
935000	939000	See, over-explaining everything in this case not only insults the intelligence of the audience,
939000	944000	which is perhaps deserved because there is a certain sect of film commentators who have built careers off of complaining
944000	947000	that their hands are not being held through the entire narrative,
947000	952000	it also diminishes what should be a fairly simple but powerful story about love, forgiveness, redemption,
952000	954000	and discovering your best self.
954000	958000	But it's really hard for the Beast to discover his best self in this movie.
958000	960000	Because there isn't one.
966000	971000	The Beast was a challenge in the original movie because he had to be scary, repulsive, a huge jerk,
971000	973000	and eventually, extremely likable.
973000	977000	Part of this is accomplished through the medium of animation, which with a skilled animator
977000	980000	is much better able to capture clear and complex emotions.
980000	985000	This shot early on in the film shows an inner conflict and complexity at a point in the narrative where he's still the bad guy,
985000	987000	and all with no dialogue.
987000	990000	The Beast's transformation is inspired by wanting to do right by Belle,
990000	993000	and Belle being kind to him in turn is earned.
993000	997000	She doesn't become his life coach, nor does she train him in the art of being nice,
997000	999000	but she does give credit where credit is due.
999000	1001000	2017 Beast is a massive prick.
1001000	1002000	Idiots!
1002000	1006000	And I don't mean like, he's an arrogant prick but then he learns the error of his ways,
1006000	1009000	like, I think this is supposed to be charming.
1009000	1011000	Actually, Romeo and Juliet's my favorite play.
1013000	1015000	Why is that not a surprise?
1016000	1017000	I'm sorry?
1017000	1023000	See, this is what is called a neg, popularized by Neil Strauss' 2005 book, The Game.
1024000	1026000	No, I don't have a copy of The Game lying around.
1026000	1029000	I want that heartache and pining and...
1029000	1032000	The Beast saves Belle from wolves, and while he's out cold,
1032000	1036000	Mrs. Potts explained that it's kind of the staff's fault he grew up to be a jerk,
1036000	1040000	and when he comes to and Belle professes her fondness for Romeo and Juliet...
1041000	1043000	Why is that not a surprise?
1043000	1044000	Classic neg.
1044000	1047000	When I enter the room, laughter dies.
1047000	1050000	Well, it might be because you abuse them and they're afraid of you.
1050000	1051000	Idiots!
1051000	1056000	See, this moment could have paid off by adding, like, one line where she explained that his staff is afraid of him,
1056000	1058000	and maybe it could be a growth moment.
1058000	1061000	When I enter the room, laughter dies.
1061000	1062000	But, nah.
1062000	1065000	There are a lot of small bewildering changes to the Beast's character
1065000	1067000	that I just... I don't understand why they're there.
1067000	1072000	Gone is this humanizing moment where the Beast realized his anger got the better of him and he made a huge mistake.
1072000	1075000	Get out!
1082000	1083000	Go!
1083000	1084000	Go!
1091000	1095000	So when he shows up to save Belle from wolves, it's kind of out of nowhere,
1095000	1099000	because he never has that emotional beat of realizing he made a mistake.
1099000	1103000	In this version, Belle doesn't have a deal with the Beast, so she can't renege on it.
1103000	1104000	Where are you going?
1104000	1107000	Promise or no promise, I can't stay here another minute.
1107000	1110000	Which not only begs the question of why she sticks around,
1110000	1113000	but also adds a particularly yikes dynamic to the scene where she's running away
1113000	1116000	and everyone in the castle is trying to imprison her.
1120000	1123000	Here he is beating her in the face with a giant snowball,
1123000	1125000	which he then laughs about.
1125000	1127000	Not even like an, oh shit!
1128000	1130000	Like, that she broke her nose!
1130000	1132000	Then followed by the change in the library scene.
1132000	1135000	In the original, it follows the Beast's change of heart.
1135000	1138000	He wants to do something for Belle that she will appreciate.
1138000	1140000	I've never felt this way about anyone.
1142000	1144000	I want to do something for her.
1144000	1147000	In the remake, it's just him showing off.
1147000	1149000	So many better things to read.
1150000	1151000	Like what?
1152000	1156000	Well, there are a couple of things in here you could start with.
1156000	1159000	Like, check out my library. It's pretty sweet.
1159000	1161000	You can look at it, I guess.
1161000	1163000	All of these small changes add up.
1163000	1165000	Beast doesn't earn Belle's affection,
1165000	1167000	so she's trying harder than he is
1167000	1169000	and ends up his f***ing life coach
1169000	1171000	like she was in Belle's Enchanted Christmas
1171000	1173000	and ends up doing all the f***ing work.
1174000	1176000	The Beast is just a mediocre man
1176000	1179000	who fails into success by possessing the right objects
1179000	1181000	despite never making any effort to rise to her needs
1181000	1183000	and figure out what she wants.
1183000	1185000	Fine, I guess I'll go down to your level.
1185000	1187000	And this scene doesn't read that way in the animated movie,
1187000	1190000	where the Beast actually makes an effort to use a spoon
1190000	1191000	but he physically cannot.
1191000	1195000	But the worst thing is that these two have no chemistry at all.
1195000	1197000	It's foolish, I suppose,
1198000	1204000	for a creature like me to hope that one day he might earn your affection.
1205000	1206000	Do you know?
1206000	1209000	But all the same, I never really buy that she grows to care for him.
1209000	1213000	It's honestly hilarious how quickly she ghosts him when he lets her go.
1213000	1215000	And then at the end when she's crying over him,
1215000	1217000	there's just no chemistry here.
1217000	1218000	I just don't buy it.
1218000	1221000	And this scene is super not helped by the freaking enchantress
1221000	1224000	barging in on what is supposed to be a private, intimate moment.
1224000	1226000	Thanks for that, Becky.
1226000	1229000	It would have been great if he nagged her after he turned back into a man.
1229000	1230000	Said something like,
1230000	1233000	Wow, your pores are much less noticeable now that I have human eyes.
1233000	1234000	And she's like,
1234000	1235000	It is you!
1241000	1243000	Movie needs to be longer!
1243000	1246000	So it pads us up with a bunch of crap that doesn't go anywhere.
1249000	1251000	Some of these additions are plot related.
1251000	1254000	A small example is the rose thing,
1254000	1256000	a plot element from the original story.
1256000	1259000	Belle's bitchy sisters ask their father for niceties,
1259000	1262000	where the virtuous, humble beauty asks only for a single rose.
1262000	1265000	In the original movie, the rose is a gift offered by the enchantress,
1265000	1267000	which then turns into the film's ticking clock.
1267000	1269000	The Seventeen remake decides,
1269000	1272000	Hey, why don't we have both?
1272000	1275000	So the new movie keeps the rose and adds a backup rose,
1275000	1278000	as in the original story, and this goes nowhere and I hate it.
1278000	1281000	Belle doesn't have bitchy sisters who ask for nicer things,
1281000	1283000	with the humble Belle asking only for a rose.
1283000	1285000	Here Belle asks for a rose because,
1285000	1287000	What can I bring you from the market?
1288000	1290000	A rose? Like the one in the painting?
1290000	1292000	I don't know, something to do with the mom.
1292000	1293000	We'll get to the mom.
1293000	1296000	Food and water is fine, but don't you dare touch my roses.
1296000	1300000	Apparently that's what happens around here when you pick a flower.
1300000	1303000	Oh, but it doesn't stop there, because we have to over explain everything.
1303000	1305000	The Beast is like traumatized by roses.
1305000	1307000	I received eternal damnation for one.
1307000	1309000	I'm merely locking him away.
1309000	1314000	He explains this with his words, and that is why he locks up Maurice.
1314000	1318000	Another truly bewildering change is Lumiere and Cogsworth going behind the Beast's back
1318000	1320000	rather than having that humanizing moment
1320000	1323000	and having it be his decision to put her in a nice room instead of the tower.
1323000	1325000	I'll show you to your room.
1325000	1328000	My room? But I thought...
1328000	1330000	You want to stay in the tower?
1330000	1331000	No.
1331000	1332000	Then follow me.
1332000	1335000	Therefore, it is Lumiere who told her not to go into the West Wing.
1335000	1338000	The castle is your home now, so feel free to go anywhere you like.
1338000	1343000	Except the West Wing, which we do not have.
1343000	1345000	Not the Beast.
1345000	1346000	What's in the West Wing?
1346000	1347000	It's forbidden.
1347000	1350000	So there is no tension and there is no betrayal in this scene
1350000	1353000	because the Beast never laid down that boundary, which she then crossed.
1353000	1355000	What are you doing here?
1355000	1356000	Why you mad, bro?
1356000	1360000	But some of the changes are character...
1360000	1362000	...depthening.
1362000	1366000	I think the intent here was to make the town sympathetic and redeemable,
1366000	1369000	which they weren't really in the original and that was kind of the point.
1369000	1372000	The original movie actually has a rather cynical opinion of the masses.
1379000	1382000	That people are easily duped in the face of things that are strange and foreign
1382000	1384000	and it doesn't pull its punches on that point.
1384000	1387000	But the 17 Remake does by making the town redeemable,
1387000	1390000	which isn't really earned, nor is there any emotional payoff
1390000	1394000	when, I don't know, Mrs. Potts reunites with Mr. Potts?
1394000	1397000	And Cogsworth is reunited with his apparent nag of a wife
1397000	1399000	and then begs to be turned back into a clock.
1399000	1401000	Turned back into a clock.
1401000	1403000	Turned back into a clock.
1403000	1404000	Thanks, I hate it.
1404000	1407000	So on the one hand, there's this bid to make Gaston kind of sympathetic
1407000	1412000	by implying that he has PTSD, a truly stupid and insulting change that adds nothing.
1412000	1414000	Look, Gaston doesn't need damage.
1414000	1416000	He is the high school jock everybody admires.
1416000	1417000	He's a hunter.
1417000	1419000	He doesn't need to be more than that.
1419000	1421000	He just needs to be a big handsome dummy everyone loves
1421000	1423000	because he's arrogant and good looking.
1423000	1425000	Because that tends to be how it happens in the real world
1425000	1427000	and that's kind of the point of the movie.
1427000	1431000	So the addition of Gaston was in the war is awful.
1431000	1433000	Not only does it add backstory that goes nowhere,
1433000	1436000	but as the film goes on, it's less he was in the war,
1436000	1439000	he's damaged so much as he's like a blood psychopath
1439000	1441000	that appears to be aroused by the mere thought of violence.
1442000	1443000	Make happy thoughts.
1443000	1444000	Go back to the war.
1444000	1448000	Blood, explosions, countless widows.
1448000	1449000	Widows.
1449000	1451000	The remake has Gaston giving Maurice the benefit of the doubt
1451000	1454000	and it seems to be going in the direction of making Gaston
1454000	1458000	kind of more reasonable and sympathetic, but then boom, blood rage.
1458000	1460000	So instead of Gaston being widely admired,
1460000	1463000	not only is his characterization inconsistent and splotchy,
1463000	1465000	Wonderful book you have there.
1465000	1467000	Have you read it?
1467000	1470000	Well, not that one, but you know, books.
1470000	1472000	The town is kind of skeptical towards him.
1472000	1475000	Gaston, did you try to kill Maurice?
1475000	1479000	So much that during Gaston, LeFou is paying people to sing.
1479000	1482000	Why add this?
1482000	1486000	Why can't Gaston be genuinely admired by a small town
1486000	1490000	who is taken in by a good looking guy who is secretly, internally monstrous?
1490000	1494000	Why do we need to make the town both more bigoted and more sympathetic?
1494000	1496000	They're a poor provincial town.
1496000	1497000	They're basic.
1497000	1502000	They take everything at face value, including Gaston, Belle, and the Beast.
1502000	1504000	That's the whole point. I hate it.
1504000	1510000	But the worst edition has got to be the Book of Teleportation.
1515000	1518000	Okay, so the Belle's plague mother backstory change is a suggestion
1518000	1521000	that should have been killed in the screenplay stage
1521000	1523000	because it is so, so pointless and adds nothing.
1523000	1526000	So Belle's mother was an artist and died of plague.
1526000	1529000	Maurice never tells Belle for some reason.
1529000	1532000	Please, just tell me one more thing about her.
1532000	1537000	But don't worry, Beast has, like, a book that not only transcends space, but also time.
1537000	1539000	So towards the end, they go to Paris.
1539000	1541000	Beast makes a tourism joke.
1541000	1545000	The Champs-ÃlysÃ©es. No, too touristy.
1545000	1547000	Belle talks about the Paris of my childhood.
1547000	1551000	This is the Paris of my childhood.
1551000	1552000	There's a plague mask.
1552000	1553000	A doctor's mask.
1553000	1555000	And Belle's like, I get it now.
1555000	1559000	And I guess they bond over their mother's dying young and tragic.
1559000	1561000	Then later in the scene in the padded wagon,
1561000	1563000	I know what happened to Maman.
1563000	1565000	I learned about tragic backstory, Papa.
1565000	1569000	And now we can resolve the conflict we didn't have and also has nothing to do with the story.
1569000	1573000	The addition of the space-time book begs the question of why they never used it later.
1573000	1578000	Hmm, if Maurice is in danger, it sure would be handy if we, I don't know,
1578000	1582000	had some sort of device that got us from point A to point B in an instant.
1582000	1586000	The worst aspect of this is that it adds inner conflict that doesn't really need to be resolved.
1586000	1588000	Belle wants to know her backstory.
1588000	1590000	What happened to Mom?
1590000	1591000	Fine.
1591000	1593000	What does that have to do with her learning to love the Beast?
1593000	1596000	What does that have to do with the Beast learning to put her needs before his own?
1596000	1599000	Hell, it doesn't even really drive a wedge between Belle and Maurice.
1599000	1602000	It's not driving a conflict between her and anyone.
1602000	1605000	It really has nothing to do with Gaston.
1605000	1609000	It's just jammed in there, and it feels like it's yet another metatextual response.
1609000	1611000	Where are all the Disney moms?
1611000	1613000	asks the clickbait sites.
1613000	1615000	Well, here's your answer. She dead.
1615000	1617000	Does it add anything to the story?
1617000	1619000	Does it enhance the characters?
1619000	1621000	Does it deepen any relationships? No.
1621000	1625000	But it does offer a response to the complaint that Disney princesses have largely absent mother figures,
1625000	1631000	which itself wasn't really a criticism of this story so much as a question of the broader trend in Disney movies.
1631000	1633000	Where are the moms?
1633000	1643000	Hey, did you know that this movie has the first gay?
1643000	1648000	When it was announced that LeFou would become the first out gay character in a Disney movie,
1648000	1656000	the L's, the G's, the B's, the T's, and of course all you filthy, filthy Q's responded with uproarious applause.
1656000	1668000	So yeah, the LGBT community responded overwhelmingly with,
1668000	1670000	F***ing really?
1670000	1673000	Which got upgraded to are you f***ing kidding me when we saw the final product
1673000	1678000	and the only out thing about LeFou that wasn't completely subtext was this shot.
1678000	1684000	Wow. Such gay. Very representation.
1684000	1691000	So a lot of people were very validly annoyed that this was the best that we could get for the first out gay in a Disney movie.
1691000	1695000	Well, I used to be on Gaston's side, but we are so in a bad place right now.
1695000	1697000	You're too good for him anyway.
1697000	1701000	The buffoon character whose name translates to the fool.
1701000	1703000	You're welcome gays.
1703000	1709000	But the worst offender on the front of cheap, safe Hollywood liberalism is Belle, feminist icon.
1709000	1716000	What on earth are you doing? Teaching another girl to read. Isn't one enough?
1716000	1718000	Introducing Beast for Sheen.
1718000	1726000	Feminism written by straight white men whose feminism appears to have pretty much began and ended with Disney feminism from the 90's.
1726000	1730000	I'm a fast learner.
1730000	1732000	A damsel in distress?
1732000	1738000	I'm a damsel. I'm in distress. I can handle this. Have a nice day.
1738000	1746000	Okay, and I honestly don't want to shit all over he for she. I think a lot of people in America and the UK miss that it's supposed to be a global thing.
1746000	1755000	This is not a dig on Emma Watson, who I honestly think is a net positive and I really respect that she uses her platform to advance a more globally oriented brand of feminism.
1755000	1757000	But!
1757000	1767000	Somewhere along the line Disney decided, hey, as long as we're using this movie to respond to every criticism lobbed against the original, we should probably go ahead and appease the feminists while we're here.
1767000	1771000	So Belle helps Maurice with his clocks.
1771000	1772000	Thank you.
1772000	1774000	Maurice calls her ahead of her time.
1774000	1779000	I was so ahead of her time. It was different.
1779000	1788000	She leans in. Belle attempts to escape the castle twice, which is so much more feminist than the original where she attempts to escape a mirror once.
1788000	1796000	Jesus Christ, I'm surprised that they didn't like have Belle like look directly into the camera and ask the audience if they thought she was developing Stockholm Syndrome.
1796000	1800000	The biggest and most egregious addition is, of course, Belle's goddamn washing machine.
1800000	1804000	A thing she invented while also promoting female literacy.
1804000	1807000	But oh no, here comes the patriarchy.
1807000	1814000	What on earth are you doing? Teaching another girl to read isn't one enough.
1814000	1821000	Wow, it sure will be satisfying later in the movie when this guy learns the error of his ways and that female literacy is important.
1821000	1828000	Oh wait, and then they smash her washing machine. Destroy it.
1828000	1831000	I mean at least you tried, Belle.
1831000	1834000	All I wanted was to teach a child to read.
1834000	1839000	Too bad that washing machine or your inventing skills will never be mentioned in the movie again.
1839000	1845000	And I honestly hate to point out historical accuracy issues in a Disney movie because I do not care.
1845000	1852000	I realize that this is a sticking point for a lot of people complaining about the accuracy of the era that inspired the film, but I don't care.
1852000	1857000	Boy, there's no depth to how much I don't care about that line of thinking.
1857000	1869000	However, since the movie decides to play up the historical aspect of the film and decides to definitively set the film in a period of French history that wasn't looking too bright for absolute f***ing monarchs.
1869000	1871000	After all, miss, this is France.
1871000	1877000	Female literacy was not a thing that was exactly frowned upon in this particular culture in this particular period in history.
1877000	1880000	There were lots of magazines specifically for young women.
1880000	1883000	The original Beauty and the Beast was even published in one of those magazines.
1883000	1885000	So this was not a thing.
1885000	1889000	And I hate this because not only was it not a thing, it doesn't go anywhere.
1889000	1897000	At no point does this guy or anyone in the town really ever have a come to Jesus moment and realize that like sexism is bad and literacy is good.
1897000	1900000	But hey, Beast for she.
1900000	1903000	Likewise, Belle being an inventor also never pays off.
1903000	1906000	She never like invents a thing that helps the Beast or the castle staff.
1906000	1909000	Hell, she doesn't even get them out of the padded wagon at the end.
1909000	1911000	In the original, Chip blasts them out.
1911000	1914000	You guys gotta try this thing.
1914000	1916000	In this version, Maurice does it.
1916000	1919000	But don't worry, he uses Belle's hairpin.
1919000	1920000	Lean in, Belle.
1920000	1924000	The worst thing about this is that the movie kind of implies that the bigotry of the town is
1924000	1926000	A. Partially enchantment induced.
1926000	1928000	Which, yuck.
1928000	1931000	B. A problem that can slash is solved.
1931000	1933000	All they need to do is get woke.
1933000	1935000	I remember! I do!
1935000	1941000	It adds all this crap about bigotry without understanding its underlying causes, which are neither rational nor enchantment.
1941000	1944000	The original movie was actually really good about this subtext.
1944000	1949000	It gets that the bigotry of the town is heavily emotion driven and not really dictated by logic.
1949000	1953000	That's kind of the point, and that's why Gaston is so easily able to manipulate them.
1953000	1955000	The Beast will make off with your children!
1955000	1957000	He'll come after them in the night!
1957000	1959000	The Beast will make off with your jobs!
1959000	1961000	He'll come crossing over the border at night!
1961000	1966000	Wow, these villagers sure do have a lot of socioeconomic anxiety.
1966000	1973000	Meanwhile, the New York Times is over here writing like 800 profiles on anti-Beast villagers and why they still follow Gaston.
1973000	1976000	But in the remake, the villagers see the error of their ways,
1976000	1979000	while not demonstrating that they have actually learned anything.
1979000	1983000	But don't worry, they won't be sexist or bigoted anymore.
1983000	1987000	And suddenly, he wasn't racist anymore.
1987000	1989000	Problem solved.
1989000	1992000	I'll be the racist!
1992000	1995000	Well, not anymore.
1995000	1998000	Dragon!
1998000	2001000	Boy, that was easy. Beast for she.
2002000	2008000	So it's not even that these common bad faith criticisms of the original movie exist and they're such popular talking points.
2008000	2011000	Yeah, that is kind of annoying and basic, but you know, whatever.
2011000	2015000	But the key to success under Eiger, where it never took off under Eisner,
2015000	2020000	is that these live action remakes have to add something to their originals, make meta commentary on them.
2020000	2023000	So here we have a film that fixes plot holes that don't need to be fixed,
2023000	2026000	adds dimension to characters that don't go anywhere,
2026000	2029000	tacks on weird plot crap that likewise does not go anywhere,
2029000	2033000	and shoves in some lazy hat tips to their version of progressivism.
2033000	2036000	But that this formula has proven so successful,
2036000	2040000	boy, I can't wait for Dumbo, now with more emotional support,
2040000	2045000	and Mulan, but not a musical, because China doesn't like musicals.
2045000	2049000	But the worst thing to me is how much this new approach doesn't feel like Disney.
2049000	2053000	And by Disney, I mean Walt, who, independent of Cocteau, had a similar approach to storytelling.
2053000	2055000	According to Walt Disney,
2059000	2062000	whether he be six or sixty, call the child innocence.
2062000	2065000	The worst of us is not without innocence, although buried deeply it might be.
2065000	2070000	In my work, I try to reach and speak to that innocence, showing it the fun and joy of living.
2070000	2073000	The original Beauty and the Beast feels in the spirit of both Walt and Cocteau,
2073000	2075000	but the new one is just cynical.
2075000	2078000	The merger with Fox Studios is another major element here.
2078000	2081000	That means fewer movies will be released in general,
2081000	2084000	and given how safe these live action remakes are,
2084000	2087000	more resources will be put into far fewer productions.
2087000	2091000	Again, to go back to that Eisner memo, we have no obligation to make art.
2091000	2093000	We have no obligation to make history.
2093000	2096000	We have no obligation to make a statement, but to make money.
2096000	2100000	It is often important to make history, to make art, or to make a significant statement.
2100000	2102000	In order to make money, we must always make entertaining movies,
2102000	2108000	and if we make entertaining movies, at time, we will reliably make history, art, a statement, or all three.
2108000	2111000	So, Disney under Eiger certainly makes money.
2111000	2112000	Congrats for that.
2112000	2114000	But they are no longer making history.
2114000	2119000	This is just safe regurgitation of brands we've already seen catering to a nostalgia-hungry market.
2119000	2121000	And that wouldn't be so bad,
2121000	2125000	but more and more, this comes at the cost of the creation of anything new.
2125000	2128000	And when Eiger saw the breadth of his domain, he wept,
2128000	2131000	for there were no more properties to remake.
