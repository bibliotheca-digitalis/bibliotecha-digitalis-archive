WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
So, for some reason, I get more requests for this movie than for any other movie?

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Okay!

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Jean Cocteau's 1946 black and white classic, La Belle et la BÃªte,

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
famously opens with an appeal to viewers asking them to open their hearts and minds

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
to the innocent and magical worldview of a child,

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
to allow themselves to believe that castles can be enchanted,

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
and that, yes, the heart of a man can beat beneath the hide of a beast.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
Well, I did some digging, and it turns out that the live-action Beauty and the Beast

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
originally had an homage to Cocteau's opening for their 2017 remake

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
of the original Disney animated classic.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
It said,

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
We invite you to open your hearts and minds to the magical worldview of pedantic nitpickers

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
who point out plot holes and fairy tales, which we are now kowtowing to, apparently.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Here's a movie for you, guy who kept pointing out that, according to math,

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
the prince was only 11 when he got turned into a beast.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
That's pretty messed up, right?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
That's not logical.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Open your heart like the pedantic f*** who opines,

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Now let the toon forget that the monarch had disappeared.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Plot hole ting!

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Wow.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I hate it.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
So apparently the intent with the remake of Disney's animated classic Beauty and the Beast

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
was to respond to every bad faith criticism lobbed at the original.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Like, well, why were the servants enchanted, too?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
They didn't do anything wrong.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
And Belle's not feminist enough.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Make that she reads an active, active transgression against the patriarchy.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Teaching another girl to read isn't one enough.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
And give her an invention subplot that goes nowhere.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Effectively, Disney has gone and made a movie which differs in content

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
only in that it appears to exist to appease the pedantic f***s of YouTube

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
with their decades of bad faith criticism.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
And for ever having enabled that atmosphere of pedantic f***ery

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
that led to the creation of a film that goes out of its way to address

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
the plot holes of the film that it is based on,

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
I will never cease my penance walk.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
But I am going to complain about this movie for a really long time, so strap in.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
It's important to contextualize this movie in the trend

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
that it is the current apotheosis of, that being, Disney live-action remakes.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
And these live-action remakes seem to pose themselves not as simple remakes,

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
but as responses to criticisms of the films that they are remaking.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
For Maleficent, it posits that Maleficent was misunderstood

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
and that the narrator of the original movie was unreliable.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
For The Jungle Book, it posits that, hey, maybe Shere Khan had a point

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
and Mowgli is dangerous.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
But for Beauty and the Beast, the response seems to be fixing plot holes

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
that weren't actually problems or plot holes to begin with,

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
and you may be asking yourself, is this really an overlong, nitpicky, complainy video

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
complaining about how overlong, nitpicky clickbait film criticism

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
has influenced the actual text in the current trend of live-action Disney remakes?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Yes.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
We begin not with the bad bitch who got this party started Maleficent,

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
nor the original animated Beauty and the Beast,

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
nor even the evil genius current CEO of the Disney Company,

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
aka boringly competent daddy Bob Iger,

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
it starts with the Robert Moses of the Disney Company,

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
daddy of daddies Michael Eisner.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Because important to remember is that Michael Eisner was Bob Iger's mentor

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
in the 1990s and early 2000s,

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
and that the reason Iger had the opportunity to enjoy this long run

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
as CEO of the Disney Company was because of his unwavering

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
failty to the Regina, Georgia, Hollywood CEOs, Michael Eisner.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
In a 1981 letter, Eisner wrote to Paramount executives

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
before he jumped ship to become CEO of the Disney Company,

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
he penned what is widely considered to be his ethos

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
and possibly the most 1980s thing ever written.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
This was an ethos carried through to his time at Disney.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
That said, Eisner was also super cognizant of the value of brand prestige,

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
and ironically in his earlier years he was super resistant

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
to the whole concept of releasing Disney classics onto VHS,

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
as this, he worried, would lower the prestige of the brand.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
But boy did he change his tune when Pinocchio,

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
the first release to VHS because it was considered lower rung among the classics,

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
sold out of its first run.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
Lesson learned here, repackaging Disney classics is a safe, lucrative bet.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
This would reach its apotheosis with the downright parodic phase

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
of direct-to-video sequels, producing such classics as

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
The Hunchback of Notre Dame 2,

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
The Fox and the Hound 2,

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
and Cinderella 3, A Twist in Time.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
The best one of this lot, yes I will stand by that,

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
I have seen them all because of the f***ing course I have.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
During this era we also saw the expansion of Disney Renaissance properties

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
adapted for Broadway. This became a trend that continues to this day.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
In the 90s we saw Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, and...

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Aida?

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Yeah, that was a Disney joint. Okay.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
But the thing that we are presently living through

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
was not the first attempt at repackaging Disney classics for live action.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
Seeing the success of properties like Beauty and the Beast on Broadway and VHS sales,

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Eisner took an eye towards live action remakes of animated classics,

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
beginning with The Jungle Book in 1994.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
This one had a sexy Mowgli.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
But Eisner's real event was 101 Dalmatians in 1996 starring Glenn Close.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
I've no use for babies.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
Both of these movies did okay?

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
101 Dalmatians did really pretty well,

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
breaking in $136 million in domestic box office grosses

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
and unleashing an avalanche of plush dogs in other merchandise

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
and eventually garnering a sequel.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
During this period there were also remakes of old live action movies

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
like The Parent Trap starring Lindsay Lohan,

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
which unexpectedly grossed $92 million,

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
proving that there was indeed a market for this sort of thing.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
But these were not huge successes,

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
and after event movie Pearl Harbor was eviscerated by critics,

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
Eisner became much more bearish on the whole concept of event movies in general.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
Movies like The Jungle Book 94 and 101 Dalmatians didn't really start a trend

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
where newer films like Maleficent and Cinderella of 2015 did.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
The final element to the formation of this version of Beauty and the Beast

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
is one we can't really pin on Eisner,

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
and that is the recent trend for Disney movies to make metatextual commentary

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
on the Disney company and the Disney brand in general.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
It's there in Moana.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
If you wear a dress and you have an animal sidekick, you're a princess.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
It's there in Enchanted, like the whole movie.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
And Dear God, Frozen.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
It's true love.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Audiences love it when Disney knowingly pokes fun at itself.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Do animals talk to you?

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
No.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Were you poisoned?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
No.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Cursed?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
No.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Kidnapped or enslaved?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
No.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Are you guys okay?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Should I call the police?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
And they really loved it with Beauty and the Beast, didn't they?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
I'm talking to the candle.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Candelabra.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Thanks, I hate it.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
Eisner's story as CEO of the Disney company is very much a mixed bag.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
He oversaw the success of the Disney Renaissance, yes,

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
but he was also responsible for a string of acquisitions and bad ideas,

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
which could take up many, many, many episodes, but I'm not going into here.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
Eisner certainly took to heart Eisner's wisdom of not being obligated to make art or history,

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
but to make money, which manifested as safe investments.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
But Eisner invests safely, and much bigger than Eisner ever did.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
As a result, Disney's stock has quadrupled in value since Eisner's departure in 2005.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
Eisner in 2018 is able to execute Eisner's vision of repackaging Disney properties for live action

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
without making the brand feel cheap like Eisner eventually would with his reliance on direct-to-video sequels.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
In effect, Eisner has mastered what the Disney company refers to internally as brand integrity.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
And moreover, the Disney company under Eisner has figured out the secret ingredient.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
It's not enough to just do a live-action remake of a beloved classic starring Glenn Close.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
New live-action Disney needs to be metatextually responding to some criticism

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
of either the Disney company, the brand, or of the property it is remaking.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
So now we know how we got here, let's take a look at what we got.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
In my grand tradition of flaccid attempts to be balanced,

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
I'm going to first try to list the things I don't hate.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
But I gotta be honest, there's not much here.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
At least Phantom of the Opera had Patrick Wilson in Mini Driver.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
Okay, I am going to find some stuff I don't hate. Let's see, there's gotta be some stuff.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
Okay, Lumiere and Cogsworth have a different dynamic in the remake than they do in the original.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
Rather than them squabbling and Cogsworth constantly trying to restrain Lumiere,

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
here they don't really fight and Cogsworth wants to stand up to the beast.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
You can't talk to us like that, I forbid it.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
And Lumiere's kind of trying to help him with that.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
Of course, that doesn't really go anywhere. Cogsworth never does stand up to the beast,

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
so it's an arc that is added with no payoff. It's different.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
I mean, it's not good, but I guess I don't hate it. But we still had to know homo.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
God, this is hard.

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
Tooch and Audra McDonald love those two, don't love the characters,

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
they are superfluous and add nothing, but I always love me some Tooch.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
And Audra McDonald should just be in more everything, so, sure.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
Um, this owl? Damn, that is a sweet owl. Love that owl.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
Oh, and Kevin Kline? Okay, this is actually one change I unambiguously like.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
Like turning Maurice from an infantilized man-baby into a gentle, sensitive clockmaker.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
And Kline sells it. That actually really, really works.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
It's alright.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
And... that's it.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
The original DVD release of Beauty and the Beast in 1991 included a commentary track

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
in which directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale and producer Don Hahn were already audibly frustrated

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
with people trying to over-explain and outsmart the logic of an enchanted castle.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
The most relevant bit that sticks out in my mind is where they try to explain,

10:12.000 --> 10:18.000
or rather, kind of infer they shouldn't have to explain, the internal logic of Be Our Guest.

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
Every piece of flatware doesn't necessarily have a corresponding human equivalent,

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
but it was a lot more fun to have dancing flatware and dancing silverware.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
Like, it's an enchanted castle. Ergo, the stuff in it is also enchanted.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
That doesn't mean that everything that moves in the castle has a one-to-one human equivalent.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
But because one of the selling points of this movie is the over-explanation of everything,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
everything needs to be explained in the dialogue.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
I'm talking to a candle.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Candelabra, please.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Yep, that's weird. Glad you pointed out how unlikely that is

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
so I can take off the million layers of logic armor in which I have adorned myself

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
so that I can suspend my disbelief.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
We can't leave things to people's imaginations.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Then they might go make an internet about it.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
See, it's stuff like this that legit sucks the magic out of parables and fairy tales.

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
But it needs to be explained to modern audiences that no, not every object in the castle has a human corollary.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Hello. What's your name?

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
That is a hairbrush.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Like Madame Craper, the helpful toilet.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Hello. What's your name?

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
My belt. Your dress, it is stuck in your belt.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
Oh, don't worry. It happened to me all the time back when I had legs.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
An even more frustrating addition is that the movie explains that, yeah,

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
the servants in the castle see themselves as kind of on the hook for the beast being a jerk.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
You see, when the master lost his mother

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
and his cruel father took that sweet innocent lad

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
and twisted him up to be just like him, we did nothing.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
Well, my dear, we were kind of enablers.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
This is like victims of abuse saying they had it coming and it was their fault

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
because they shouldn't have made him mad.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
We've made our bed and we must lie in it.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
I understand that movie nitpicks.com has some complaints about us being punished

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
for the actions of a ten-year-old, but you see, my dear,

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
there's a perfectly logical explanation for that too.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
This is another addition that gets dragged out

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
because there's also the added element that the beast's parents were neglectful and shitty

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
and the staff knew, but they didn't really do anything because it was, you know,

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
an absolute f***ing monarchy, but whatever.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
They see themselves as kind of deserving of their punishment

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
because they didn't help the prince be better when they had a chance,

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
so we're clocks now.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Thanks, I hate it.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
But the overwritten thing I hate the most is when the staff of the castle just explains the plot to Belle.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
What happens when the last petal falls?

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
The master remains a beast forever and we become antiques.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
Another major change in this version was adding more stakes to certain aspects of the plot,

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
which, you know, in theory, fine.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
Instead of the rose falling apart, now the entire castle is falling apart.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
It's not just the possibility of everyone remaining as they are for all time.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
The staff are becoming more and more inanimate as they inch closer to Rose McGeddon,

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
which I grew three more feathers and I just plucked yesterday.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
You know, again, fine. Not the worst thing ever as it adds clearer stakes.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
But this adds to the problem as by adding these higher stakes,

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
they don't account for plot elements that they do keep from the original animated movie.

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
Namely, the punishment of basically condemning his entire castle of ceasing to exist

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
doesn't really jive with his decision to let Belle go.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
I let her go.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
What? Master, how could you do that?

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
Adding more stakes around the staff adds a whole host of problems.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
Namely, turning the beast's lack of concern for his staff from anger management problems

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
and general immaturity into being actually morally reprehensible.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I set her free.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
I'm sorry I couldn't do the same for all of you.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
I guess. Boss of the year. Sorry, cave daddy.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
So adding these higher stakes kind of zaps the meaning from the moment where he decides to let Belle go.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
It turns the beast's decision from a moment of personal growth into a trolley problem.

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
Whose life matters more, Maurice or every living being in the goddamn castle?

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
In this version, the beast letting Belle go is no longer him placing Belle's needs in front of his own,

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
but instead deciding that Maurice's life is worth more than everyone in the castle, who he has now doomed to death.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
Point being here that the movie wanted to up the stakes. Fine.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
But it fundamentally changed what is supposed to be the emotional core of the story.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
That being beast's growth as a person who can put other people's needs before his own.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
Because this rubs up against the whole thrust of the story,

14:35.000 --> 14:40.000
the higher stakes kind of necessitates that the enchanted objects explain their plight to Belle.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
What happens when the last petal falls?

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
The master remains a beast forever, and we become antiques.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
Yes, logically it would make sense for Lumiere Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts to do this,

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
but it diminishes what should be the emotional core of the story.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
That Belle develops these feelings on her own terms, in her own time.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
She doesn't do it because their fucking lives on the line.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
She does it because she falls in love with him because he begins to live as his best self,

15:05.000 --> 15:11.000
not because of a trolley problem, which she proceeds to ignore anyway because Maurice needs help.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
And while we're here on the topic of terrible editing, what is this?

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
Chip! Have you seen Chip? He ran off!

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Oh no.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Mom!

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
What was Chip jumping from?

15:24.000 --> 15:30.000
Why is this happening? Was this scene really in need of more stakes out of nowhere?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Oh no.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Mom!

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
If I can't live as a cop, I'll die as a cop.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
See, over-explaining everything in this case not only insults the intelligence of the audience,

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
which is perhaps deserved because there is a certain sect of film commentators who have built careers off of complaining

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
that their hands are not being held through the entire narrative,

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
it also diminishes what should be a fairly simple but powerful story about love, forgiveness, redemption,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
and discovering your best self.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
But it's really hard for the Beast to discover his best self in this movie.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Because there isn't one.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
The Beast was a challenge in the original movie because he had to be scary, repulsive, a huge jerk,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
and eventually, extremely likable.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
Part of this is accomplished through the medium of animation, which with a skilled animator

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
is much better able to capture clear and complex emotions.

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
This shot early on in the film shows an inner conflict and complexity at a point in the narrative where he's still the bad guy,

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
and all with no dialogue.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
The Beast's transformation is inspired by wanting to do right by Belle,

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
and Belle being kind to him in turn is earned.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
She doesn't become his life coach, nor does she train him in the art of being nice,

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
but she does give credit where credit is due.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
2017 Beast is a massive prick.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Idiots!

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
And I don't mean like, he's an arrogant prick but then he learns the error of his ways,

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
like, I think this is supposed to be charming.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Actually, Romeo and Juliet's my favorite play.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Why is that not a surprise?

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
I'm sorry?

16:57.000 --> 17:03.000
See, this is what is called a neg, popularized by Neil Strauss' 2005 book, The Game.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
No, I don't have a copy of The Game lying around.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
I want that heartache and pining and...

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
The Beast saves Belle from wolves, and while he's out cold,

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
Mrs. Potts explained that it's kind of the staff's fault he grew up to be a jerk,

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
and when he comes to and Belle professes her fondness for Romeo and Juliet...

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Why is that not a surprise?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Classic neg.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
When I enter the room, laughter dies.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
Well, it might be because you abuse them and they're afraid of you.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Idiots!

17:31.000 --> 17:36.000
See, this moment could have paid off by adding, like, one line where she explained that his staff is afraid of him,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
and maybe it could be a growth moment.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
When I enter the room, laughter dies.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
But, nah.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
There are a lot of small bewildering changes to the Beast's character

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
that I just... I don't understand why they're there.

17:47.000 --> 17:52.000
Gone is this humanizing moment where the Beast realized his anger got the better of him and he made a huge mistake.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
Get out!

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Go!

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Go!

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
So when he shows up to save Belle from wolves, it's kind of out of nowhere,

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
because he never has that emotional beat of realizing he made a mistake.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
In this version, Belle doesn't have a deal with the Beast, so she can't renege on it.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Where are you going?

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
Promise or no promise, I can't stay here another minute.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Which not only begs the question of why she sticks around,

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
but also adds a particularly yikes dynamic to the scene where she's running away

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
and everyone in the castle is trying to imprison her.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
Here he is beating her in the face with a giant snowball,

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
which he then laughs about.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Not even like an, oh shit!

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Like, that she broke her nose!

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Then followed by the change in the library scene.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
In the original, it follows the Beast's change of heart.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
He wants to do something for Belle that she will appreciate.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
I've never felt this way about anyone.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
I want to do something for her.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
In the remake, it's just him showing off.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
So many better things to read.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Like what?

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
Well, there are a couple of things in here you could start with.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
Like, check out my library. It's pretty sweet.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
You can look at it, I guess.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
All of these small changes add up.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Beast doesn't earn Belle's affection,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
so she's trying harder than he is

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
and ends up his f***ing life coach

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
like she was in Belle's Enchanted Christmas

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
and ends up doing all the f***ing work.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
The Beast is just a mediocre man

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
who fails into success by possessing the right objects

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
despite never making any effort to rise to her needs

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
and figure out what she wants.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Fine, I guess I'll go down to your level.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
And this scene doesn't read that way in the animated movie,

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
where the Beast actually makes an effort to use a spoon

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
but he physically cannot.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
But the worst thing is that these two have no chemistry at all.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
It's foolish, I suppose,

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
for a creature like me to hope that one day he might earn your affection.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Do you know?

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
But all the same, I never really buy that she grows to care for him.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
It's honestly hilarious how quickly she ghosts him when he lets her go.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
And then at the end when she's crying over him,

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
there's just no chemistry here.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
I just don't buy it.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
And this scene is super not helped by the freaking enchantress

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
barging in on what is supposed to be a private, intimate moment.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Thanks for that, Becky.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
It would have been great if he nagged her after he turned back into a man.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Said something like,

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
Wow, your pores are much less noticeable now that I have human eyes.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
And she's like,

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
It is you!

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Movie needs to be longer!

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
So it pads us up with a bunch of crap that doesn't go anywhere.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Some of these additions are plot related.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
A small example is the rose thing,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
a plot element from the original story.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
Belle's bitchy sisters ask their father for niceties,

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
where the virtuous, humble beauty asks only for a single rose.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
In the original movie, the rose is a gift offered by the enchantress,

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
which then turns into the film's ticking clock.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
The Seventeen remake decides,

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Hey, why don't we have both?

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
So the new movie keeps the rose and adds a backup rose,

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
as in the original story, and this goes nowhere and I hate it.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
Belle doesn't have bitchy sisters who ask for nicer things,

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
with the humble Belle asking only for a rose.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Here Belle asks for a rose because,

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
What can I bring you from the market?

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
A rose? Like the one in the painting?

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I don't know, something to do with the mom.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
We'll get to the mom.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
Food and water is fine, but don't you dare touch my roses.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
Apparently that's what happens around here when you pick a flower.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
Oh, but it doesn't stop there, because we have to over explain everything.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
The Beast is like traumatized by roses.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
I received eternal damnation for one.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
I'm merely locking him away.

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
He explains this with his words, and that is why he locks up Maurice.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
Another truly bewildering change is Lumiere and Cogsworth going behind the Beast's back

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
rather than having that humanizing moment

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
and having it be his decision to put her in a nice room instead of the tower.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
I'll show you to your room.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
My room? But I thought...

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
You want to stay in the tower?

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
No.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
Then follow me.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
Therefore, it is Lumiere who told her not to go into the West Wing.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
The castle is your home now, so feel free to go anywhere you like.

22:18.000 --> 22:23.000
Except the West Wing, which we do not have.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Not the Beast.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
What's in the West Wing?

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
It's forbidden.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
So there is no tension and there is no betrayal in this scene

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
because the Beast never laid down that boundary, which she then crossed.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
What are you doing here?

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
Why you mad, bro?

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
But some of the changes are character...

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
...depthening.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
I think the intent here was to make the town sympathetic and redeemable,

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
which they weren't really in the original and that was kind of the point.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
The original movie actually has a rather cynical opinion of the masses.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
That people are easily duped in the face of things that are strange and foreign

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
and it doesn't pull its punches on that point.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
But the 17 Remake does by making the town redeemable,

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
which isn't really earned, nor is there any emotional payoff

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
when, I don't know, Mrs. Potts reunites with Mr. Potts?

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
And Cogsworth is reunited with his apparent nag of a wife

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
and then begs to be turned back into a clock.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Turned back into a clock.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Turned back into a clock.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Thanks, I hate it.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
So on the one hand, there's this bid to make Gaston kind of sympathetic

23:27.000 --> 23:32.000
by implying that he has PTSD, a truly stupid and insulting change that adds nothing.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Look, Gaston doesn't need damage.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
He is the high school jock everybody admires.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
He's a hunter.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
He doesn't need to be more than that.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
He just needs to be a big handsome dummy everyone loves

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
because he's arrogant and good looking.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Because that tends to be how it happens in the real world

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
and that's kind of the point of the movie.

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
So the addition of Gaston was in the war is awful.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Not only does it add backstory that goes nowhere,

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
but as the film goes on, it's less he was in the war,

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
he's damaged so much as he's like a blood psychopath

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
that appears to be aroused by the mere thought of violence.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Make happy thoughts.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Go back to the war.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
Blood, explosions, countless widows.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Widows.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
The remake has Gaston giving Maurice the benefit of the doubt

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
and it seems to be going in the direction of making Gaston

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
kind of more reasonable and sympathetic, but then boom, blood rage.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
So instead of Gaston being widely admired,

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
not only is his characterization inconsistent and splotchy,

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Wonderful book you have there.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Have you read it?

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
Well, not that one, but you know, books.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
The town is kind of skeptical towards him.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
Gaston, did you try to kill Maurice?

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
So much that during Gaston, LeFou is paying people to sing.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
Why add this?

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
Why can't Gaston be genuinely admired by a small town

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
who is taken in by a good looking guy who is secretly, internally monstrous?

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
Why do we need to make the town both more bigoted and more sympathetic?

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
They're a poor provincial town.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
They're basic.

24:57.000 --> 25:02.000
They take everything at face value, including Gaston, Belle, and the Beast.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
That's the whole point. I hate it.

25:04.000 --> 25:10.000
But the worst edition has got to be the Book of Teleportation.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
Okay, so the Belle's plague mother backstory change is a suggestion

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
that should have been killed in the screenplay stage

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
because it is so, so pointless and adds nothing.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
So Belle's mother was an artist and died of plague.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
Maurice never tells Belle for some reason.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
Please, just tell me one more thing about her.

25:32.000 --> 25:37.000
But don't worry, Beast has, like, a book that not only transcends space, but also time.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
So towards the end, they go to Paris.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Beast makes a tourism joke.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
The Champs-ÃlysÃ©es. No, too touristy.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Belle talks about the Paris of my childhood.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
This is the Paris of my childhood.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
There's a plague mask.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
A doctor's mask.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
And Belle's like, I get it now.

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
And I guess they bond over their mother's dying young and tragic.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Then later in the scene in the padded wagon,

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
I know what happened to Maman.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
I learned about tragic backstory, Papa.

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
And now we can resolve the conflict we didn't have and also has nothing to do with the story.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.000
The addition of the space-time book begs the question of why they never used it later.

26:13.000 --> 26:18.000
Hmm, if Maurice is in danger, it sure would be handy if we, I don't know,

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
had some sort of device that got us from point A to point B in an instant.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
The worst aspect of this is that it adds inner conflict that doesn't really need to be resolved.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Belle wants to know her backstory.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
What happened to Mom?

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Fine.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
What does that have to do with her learning to love the Beast?

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
What does that have to do with the Beast learning to put her needs before his own?

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
Hell, it doesn't even really drive a wedge between Belle and Maurice.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
It's not driving a conflict between her and anyone.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
It really has nothing to do with Gaston.

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
It's just jammed in there, and it feels like it's yet another metatextual response.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Where are all the Disney moms?

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
asks the clickbait sites.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Well, here's your answer. She dead.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Does it add anything to the story?

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Does it enhance the characters?

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Does it deepen any relationships? No.

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
But it does offer a response to the complaint that Disney princesses have largely absent mother figures,

27:05.000 --> 27:11.000
which itself wasn't really a criticism of this story so much as a question of the broader trend in Disney movies.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Where are the moms?

27:13.000 --> 27:23.000
Hey, did you know that this movie has the first gay?

27:23.000 --> 27:28.000
When it was announced that LeFou would become the first out gay character in a Disney movie,

27:28.000 --> 27:36.000
the L's, the G's, the B's, the T's, and of course all you filthy, filthy Q's responded with uproarious applause.

27:36.000 --> 27:48.000
So yeah, the LGBT community responded overwhelmingly with,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
F***ing really?

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
Which got upgraded to are you f***ing kidding me when we saw the final product

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
and the only out thing about LeFou that wasn't completely subtext was this shot.

27:58.000 --> 28:04.000
Wow. Such gay. Very representation.

28:04.000 --> 28:11.000
So a lot of people were very validly annoyed that this was the best that we could get for the first out gay in a Disney movie.

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
Well, I used to be on Gaston's side, but we are so in a bad place right now.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
You're too good for him anyway.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
The buffoon character whose name translates to the fool.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
You're welcome gays.

28:23.000 --> 28:29.000
But the worst offender on the front of cheap, safe Hollywood liberalism is Belle, feminist icon.

28:29.000 --> 28:36.000
What on earth are you doing? Teaching another girl to read. Isn't one enough?

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Introducing Beast for Sheen.

28:38.000 --> 28:46.000
Feminism written by straight white men whose feminism appears to have pretty much began and ended with Disney feminism from the 90's.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
I'm a fast learner.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
A damsel in distress?

28:52.000 --> 28:58.000
I'm a damsel. I'm in distress. I can handle this. Have a nice day.

28:58.000 --> 29:06.000
Okay, and I honestly don't want to shit all over he for she. I think a lot of people in America and the UK miss that it's supposed to be a global thing.

29:06.000 --> 29:15.000
This is not a dig on Emma Watson, who I honestly think is a net positive and I really respect that she uses her platform to advance a more globally oriented brand of feminism.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
But!

29:17.000 --> 29:27.000
Somewhere along the line Disney decided, hey, as long as we're using this movie to respond to every criticism lobbed against the original, we should probably go ahead and appease the feminists while we're here.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
So Belle helps Maurice with his clocks.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
Thank you.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Maurice calls her ahead of her time.

29:34.000 --> 29:39.000
I was so ahead of her time. It was different.

29:39.000 --> 29:48.000
She leans in. Belle attempts to escape the castle twice, which is so much more feminist than the original where she attempts to escape a mirror once.

29:48.000 --> 29:56.000
Jesus Christ, I'm surprised that they didn't like have Belle like look directly into the camera and ask the audience if they thought she was developing Stockholm Syndrome.

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
The biggest and most egregious addition is, of course, Belle's goddamn washing machine.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
A thing she invented while also promoting female literacy.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
But oh no, here comes the patriarchy.

30:07.000 --> 30:14.000
What on earth are you doing? Teaching another girl to read isn't one enough.

30:14.000 --> 30:21.000
Wow, it sure will be satisfying later in the movie when this guy learns the error of his ways and that female literacy is important.

30:21.000 --> 30:28.000
Oh wait, and then they smash her washing machine. Destroy it.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
I mean at least you tried, Belle.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
All I wanted was to teach a child to read.

30:34.000 --> 30:39.000
Too bad that washing machine or your inventing skills will never be mentioned in the movie again.

30:39.000 --> 30:45.000
And I honestly hate to point out historical accuracy issues in a Disney movie because I do not care.

30:45.000 --> 30:52.000
I realize that this is a sticking point for a lot of people complaining about the accuracy of the era that inspired the film, but I don't care.

30:52.000 --> 30:57.000
Boy, there's no depth to how much I don't care about that line of thinking.

30:57.000 --> 31:09.000
However, since the movie decides to play up the historical aspect of the film and decides to definitively set the film in a period of French history that wasn't looking too bright for absolute f***ing monarchs.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
After all, miss, this is France.

31:11.000 --> 31:17.000
Female literacy was not a thing that was exactly frowned upon in this particular culture in this particular period in history.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
There were lots of magazines specifically for young women.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
The original Beauty and the Beast was even published in one of those magazines.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
So this was not a thing.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
And I hate this because not only was it not a thing, it doesn't go anywhere.

31:29.000 --> 31:37.000
At no point does this guy or anyone in the town really ever have a come to Jesus moment and realize that like sexism is bad and literacy is good.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
But hey, Beast for she.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
Likewise, Belle being an inventor also never pays off.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
She never like invents a thing that helps the Beast or the castle staff.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
Hell, she doesn't even get them out of the padded wagon at the end.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
In the original, Chip blasts them out.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
You guys gotta try this thing.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
In this version, Maurice does it.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
But don't worry, he uses Belle's hairpin.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Lean in, Belle.

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
The worst thing about this is that the movie kind of implies that the bigotry of the town is

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
A. Partially enchantment induced.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Which, yuck.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
B. A problem that can slash is solved.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
All they need to do is get woke.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
I remember! I do!

32:15.000 --> 32:21.000
It adds all this crap about bigotry without understanding its underlying causes, which are neither rational nor enchantment.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
The original movie was actually really good about this subtext.

32:24.000 --> 32:29.000
It gets that the bigotry of the town is heavily emotion driven and not really dictated by logic.

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
That's kind of the point, and that's why Gaston is so easily able to manipulate them.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
The Beast will make off with your children!

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
He'll come after them in the night!

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
The Beast will make off with your jobs!

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
He'll come crossing over the border at night!

32:41.000 --> 32:46.000
Wow, these villagers sure do have a lot of socioeconomic anxiety.

32:46.000 --> 32:53.000
Meanwhile, the New York Times is over here writing like 800 profiles on anti-Beast villagers and why they still follow Gaston.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
But in the remake, the villagers see the error of their ways,

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
while not demonstrating that they have actually learned anything.

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
But don't worry, they won't be sexist or bigoted anymore.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.000
And suddenly, he wasn't racist anymore.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Problem solved.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
I'll be the racist!

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
Well, not anymore.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
Dragon!

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
Boy, that was easy. Beast for she.

33:22.000 --> 33:28.000
So it's not even that these common bad faith criticisms of the original movie exist and they're such popular talking points.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
Yeah, that is kind of annoying and basic, but you know, whatever.

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
But the key to success under Eiger, where it never took off under Eisner,

33:35.000 --> 33:40.000
is that these live action remakes have to add something to their originals, make meta commentary on them.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
So here we have a film that fixes plot holes that don't need to be fixed,

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
adds dimension to characters that don't go anywhere,

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
tacks on weird plot crap that likewise does not go anywhere,

33:49.000 --> 33:53.000
and shoves in some lazy hat tips to their version of progressivism.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
But that this formula has proven so successful,

33:56.000 --> 34:00.000
boy, I can't wait for Dumbo, now with more emotional support,

34:00.000 --> 34:05.000
and Mulan, but not a musical, because China doesn't like musicals.

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
But the worst thing to me is how much this new approach doesn't feel like Disney.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
And by Disney, I mean Walt, who, independent of Cocteau, had a similar approach to storytelling.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
According to Walt Disney,

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
whether he be six or sixty, call the child innocence.

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
The worst of us is not without innocence, although buried deeply it might be.

34:25.000 --> 34:30.000
In my work, I try to reach and speak to that innocence, showing it the fun and joy of living.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
The original Beauty and the Beast feels in the spirit of both Walt and Cocteau,

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
but the new one is just cynical.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
The merger with Fox Studios is another major element here.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
That means fewer movies will be released in general,

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
and given how safe these live action remakes are,

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
more resources will be put into far fewer productions.

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
Again, to go back to that Eisner memo, we have no obligation to make art.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
We have no obligation to make history.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
We have no obligation to make a statement, but to make money.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
It is often important to make history, to make art, or to make a significant statement.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
In order to make money, we must always make entertaining movies,

35:02.000 --> 35:08.000
and if we make entertaining movies, at time, we will reliably make history, art, a statement, or all three.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
So, Disney under Eiger certainly makes money.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Congrats for that.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
But they are no longer making history.

35:14.000 --> 35:19.000
This is just safe regurgitation of brands we've already seen catering to a nostalgia-hungry market.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
And that wouldn't be so bad,

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
but more and more, this comes at the cost of the creation of anything new.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
And when Eiger saw the breadth of his domain, he wept,

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
for there were no more properties to remake.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
Parts of this episode were inspired by reading James B. Stewart's book Disney War,

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
an audiobook I listened to while stuck in traffic.

35:41.000 --> 35:47.000
And I like to listen to really long non-fiction like this book while stuck in traffic.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
