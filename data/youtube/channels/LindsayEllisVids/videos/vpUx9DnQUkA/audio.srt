1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So, for some reason, I get more requests for this movie than for any other movie?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Okay!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Jean Cocteau's 1946 black and white classic, La Belle et la Bête,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
famously opens with an appeal to viewers asking them to open their hearts and minds

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
to the innocent and magical worldview of a child,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
to allow themselves to believe that castles can be enchanted,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and that, yes, the heart of a man can beat beneath the hide of a beast.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Well, I did some digging, and it turns out that the live-action Beauty and the Beast

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
originally had an homage to Cocteau's opening for their 2017 remake

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
of the original Disney animated classic.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It said,

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We invite you to open your hearts and minds to the magical worldview of pedantic nitpickers

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
who point out plot holes and fairy tales, which we are now kowtowing to, apparently.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Here's a movie for you, guy who kept pointing out that, according to math,

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
the prince was only 11 when he got turned into a beast.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's pretty messed up, right?

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That's not logical.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Open your heart like the pedantic f*** who opines,

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Now let the toon forget that the monarch had disappeared.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Plot hole ting!

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Wow.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I hate it.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So apparently the intent with the remake of Disney's animated classic Beauty and the Beast

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
was to respond to every bad faith criticism lobbed at the original.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Like, well, why were the servants enchanted, too?

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
They didn't do anything wrong.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And Belle's not feminist enough.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Make that she reads an active, active transgression against the patriarchy.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Teaching another girl to read isn't one enough.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And give her an invention subplot that goes nowhere.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Effectively, Disney has gone and made a movie which differs in content

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
only in that it appears to exist to appease the pedantic f***s of YouTube

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
with their decades of bad faith criticism.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And for ever having enabled that atmosphere of pedantic f***ery

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
that led to the creation of a film that goes out of its way to address

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
the plot holes of the film that it is based on,

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I will never cease my penance walk.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But I am going to complain about this movie for a really long time, so strap in.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's important to contextualize this movie in the trend

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
that it is the current apotheosis of, that being, Disney live-action remakes.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And these live-action remakes seem to pose themselves not as simple remakes,

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
but as responses to criticisms of the films that they are remaking.

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
For Maleficent, it posits that Maleficent was misunderstood

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and that the narrator of the original movie was unreliable.

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
For The Jungle Book, it posits that, hey, maybe Shere Khan had a point

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and Mowgli is dangerous.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But for Beauty and the Beast, the response seems to be fixing plot holes

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
that weren't actually problems or plot holes to begin with,

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and you may be asking yourself, is this really an overlong, nitpicky, complainy video

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
complaining about how overlong, nitpicky clickbait film criticism

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
has influenced the actual text in the current trend of live-action Disney remakes?

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yes.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We begin not with the bad bitch who got this party started Maleficent,

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
nor the original animated Beauty and the Beast,

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
nor even the evil genius current CEO of the Disney Company,

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
aka boringly competent daddy Bob Iger,

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
it starts with the Robert Moses of the Disney Company,

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
daddy of daddies Michael Eisner.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Because important to remember is that Michael Eisner was Bob Iger's mentor

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
in the 1990s and early 2000s,

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and that the reason Iger had the opportunity to enjoy this long run

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
as CEO of the Disney Company was because of his unwavering

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
failty to the Regina, Georgia, Hollywood CEOs, Michael Eisner.

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
In a 1981 letter, Eisner wrote to Paramount executives

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
before he jumped ship to become CEO of the Disney Company,

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
he penned what is widely considered to be his ethos

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and possibly the most 1980s thing ever written.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This was an ethos carried through to his time at Disney.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That said, Eisner was also super cognizant of the value of brand prestige,

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
and ironically in his earlier years he was super resistant

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
to the whole concept of releasing Disney classics onto VHS,

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
as this, he worried, would lower the prestige of the brand.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But boy did he change his tune when Pinocchio,

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
the first release to VHS because it was considered lower rung among the classics,

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
sold out of its first run.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Lesson learned here, repackaging Disney classics is a safe, lucrative bet.

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This would reach its apotheosis with the downright parodic phase

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
of direct-to-video sequels, producing such classics as

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The Hunchback of Notre Dame 2,

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The Fox and the Hound 2,

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and Cinderella 3, A Twist in Time.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The best one of this lot, yes I will stand by that,

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I have seen them all because of the f***ing course I have.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
During this era we also saw the expansion of Disney Renaissance properties

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
adapted for Broadway. This became a trend that continues to this day.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
In the 90s we saw Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, and...

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Aida?

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah, that was a Disney joint. Okay.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But the thing that we are presently living through

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
was not the first attempt at repackaging Disney classics for live action.

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Seeing the success of properties like Beauty and the Beast on Broadway and VHS sales,

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Eisner took an eye towards live action remakes of animated classics,

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
beginning with The Jungle Book in 1994.

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
This one had a sexy Mowgli.

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But Eisner's real event was 101 Dalmatians in 1996 starring Glenn Close.

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I've no use for babies.

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Both of these movies did okay?

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
101 Dalmatians did really pretty well,

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
breaking in $136 million in domestic box office grosses

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and unleashing an avalanche of plush dogs in other merchandise

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and eventually garnering a sequel.

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
During this period there were also remakes of old live action movies

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
like The Parent Trap starring Lindsay Lohan,

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
which unexpectedly grossed $92 million,

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
proving that there was indeed a market for this sort of thing.

106
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But these were not huge successes,

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and after event movie Pearl Harbor was eviscerated by critics,

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Eisner became much more bearish on the whole concept of event movies in general.

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Movies like The Jungle Book 94 and 101 Dalmatians didn't really start a trend

110
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
where newer films like Maleficent and Cinderella of 2015 did.

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The final element to the formation of this version of Beauty and the Beast

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
is one we can't really pin on Eisner,

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and that is the recent trend for Disney movies to make metatextual commentary

114
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
on the Disney company and the Disney brand in general.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's there in Moana.

116
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
If you wear a dress and you have an animal sidekick, you're a princess.

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's there in Enchanted, like the whole movie.

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And Dear God, Frozen.

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's true love.

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Audiences love it when Disney knowingly pokes fun at itself.

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Do animals talk to you?

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No.

123
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Were you poisoned?

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No.

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Cursed?

126
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
No.

127
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Kidnapped or enslaved?

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
No.

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Are you guys okay?

130
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Should I call the police?

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And they really loved it with Beauty and the Beast, didn't they?

132
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm talking to the candle.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Candelabra.

134
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Thanks, I hate it.

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Eisner's story as CEO of the Disney company is very much a mixed bag.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He oversaw the success of the Disney Renaissance, yes,

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
but he was also responsible for a string of acquisitions and bad ideas,

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
which could take up many, many, many episodes, but I'm not going into here.

139
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Eisner certainly took to heart Eisner's wisdom of not being obligated to make art or history,

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
but to make money, which manifested as safe investments.

141
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But Eisner invests safely, and much bigger than Eisner ever did.

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
As a result, Disney's stock has quadrupled in value since Eisner's departure in 2005.

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Eisner in 2018 is able to execute Eisner's vision of repackaging Disney properties for live action

144
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
without making the brand feel cheap like Eisner eventually would with his reliance on direct-to-video sequels.

145
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
In effect, Eisner has mastered what the Disney company refers to internally as brand integrity.

146
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And moreover, the Disney company under Eisner has figured out the secret ingredient.

147
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's not enough to just do a live-action remake of a beloved classic starring Glenn Close.

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
New live-action Disney needs to be metatextually responding to some criticism

149
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
of either the Disney company, the brand, or of the property it is remaking.

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So now we know how we got here, let's take a look at what we got.

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
In my grand tradition of flaccid attempts to be balanced,

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm going to first try to list the things I don't hate.

153
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But I gotta be honest, there's not much here.

154
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
At least Phantom of the Opera had Patrick Wilson in Mini Driver.

155
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Okay, I am going to find some stuff I don't hate. Let's see, there's gotta be some stuff.

156
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay, Lumiere and Cogsworth have a different dynamic in the remake than they do in the original.

157
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Rather than them squabbling and Cogsworth constantly trying to restrain Lumiere,

158
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
here they don't really fight and Cogsworth wants to stand up to the beast.

159
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You can't talk to us like that, I forbid it.

160
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And Lumiere's kind of trying to help him with that.

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Of course, that doesn't really go anywhere. Cogsworth never does stand up to the beast,

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
so it's an arc that is added with no payoff. It's different.

163
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I mean, it's not good, but I guess I don't hate it. But we still had to know homo.

164
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
God, this is hard.

165
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Tooch and Audra McDonald love those two, don't love the characters,

166
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
they are superfluous and add nothing, but I always love me some Tooch.

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And Audra McDonald should just be in more everything, so, sure.

168
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Um, this owl? Damn, that is a sweet owl. Love that owl.

169
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Oh, and Kevin Kline? Okay, this is actually one change I unambiguously like.

170
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Like turning Maurice from an infantilized man-baby into a gentle, sensitive clockmaker.

171
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And Kline sells it. That actually really, really works.

172
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's alright.

173
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And... that's it.

174
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The original DVD release of Beauty and the Beast in 1991 included a commentary track

175
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
in which directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale and producer Don Hahn were already audibly frustrated

176
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
with people trying to over-explain and outsmart the logic of an enchanted castle.

177
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The most relevant bit that sticks out in my mind is where they try to explain,

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
or rather, kind of infer they shouldn't have to explain, the internal logic of Be Our Guest.

179
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Every piece of flatware doesn't necessarily have a corresponding human equivalent,

180
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
but it was a lot more fun to have dancing flatware and dancing silverware.

181
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Like, it's an enchanted castle. Ergo, the stuff in it is also enchanted.

182
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That doesn't mean that everything that moves in the castle has a one-to-one human equivalent.

183
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But because one of the selling points of this movie is the over-explanation of everything,

184
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
everything needs to be explained in the dialogue.

185
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm talking to a candle.

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Candelabra, please.

187
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yep, that's weird. Glad you pointed out how unlikely that is

188
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
so I can take off the million layers of logic armor in which I have adorned myself

189
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
so that I can suspend my disbelief.

190
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
We can't leave things to people's imaginations.

191
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Then they might go make an internet about it.

192
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
See, it's stuff like this that legit sucks the magic out of parables and fairy tales.

193
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But it needs to be explained to modern audiences that no, not every object in the castle has a human corollary.

194
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Hello. What's your name?

195
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That is a hairbrush.

196
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Like Madame Craper, the helpful toilet.

197
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Hello. What's your name?

198
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
My belt. Your dress, it is stuck in your belt.

199
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Oh, don't worry. It happened to me all the time back when I had legs.

200
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
An even more frustrating addition is that the movie explains that, yeah,

201
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
the servants in the castle see themselves as kind of on the hook for the beast being a jerk.

202
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You see, when the master lost his mother

203
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and his cruel father took that sweet innocent lad

204
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and twisted him up to be just like him, we did nothing.

205
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Well, my dear, we were kind of enablers.

206
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
This is like victims of abuse saying they had it coming and it was their fault

207
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
because they shouldn't have made him mad.

208
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
We've made our bed and we must lie in it.

209
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I understand that movie nitpicks.com has some complaints about us being punished

210
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
for the actions of a ten-year-old, but you see, my dear,

211
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
there's a perfectly logical explanation for that too.

212
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
This is another addition that gets dragged out

213
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
because there's also the added element that the beast's parents were neglectful and shitty

214
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
and the staff knew, but they didn't really do anything because it was, you know,

215
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
an absolute f***ing monarchy, but whatever.

216
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
They see themselves as kind of deserving of their punishment

217
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
because they didn't help the prince be better when they had a chance,

218
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
so we're clocks now.

219
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Thanks, I hate it.

220
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But the overwritten thing I hate the most is when the staff of the castle just explains the plot to Belle.

221
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What happens when the last petal falls?

222
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The master remains a beast forever and we become antiques.

223
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Another major change in this version was adding more stakes to certain aspects of the plot,

224
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
which, you know, in theory, fine.

225
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Instead of the rose falling apart, now the entire castle is falling apart.

226
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's not just the possibility of everyone remaining as they are for all time.

227
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The staff are becoming more and more inanimate as they inch closer to Rose McGeddon,

228
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
which I grew three more feathers and I just plucked yesterday.

229
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You know, again, fine. Not the worst thing ever as it adds clearer stakes.

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But this adds to the problem as by adding these higher stakes,

231
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
they don't account for plot elements that they do keep from the original animated movie.

232
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Namely, the punishment of basically condemning his entire castle of ceasing to exist

233
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
doesn't really jive with his decision to let Belle go.

234
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I let her go.

235
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What? Master, how could you do that?

236
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Adding more stakes around the staff adds a whole host of problems.

237
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Namely, turning the beast's lack of concern for his staff from anger management problems

238
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and general immaturity into being actually morally reprehensible.

239
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I set her free.

240
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm sorry I couldn't do the same for all of you.

241
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I guess. Boss of the year. Sorry, cave daddy.

242
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So adding these higher stakes kind of zaps the meaning from the moment where he decides to let Belle go.

243
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It turns the beast's decision from a moment of personal growth into a trolley problem.

244
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Whose life matters more, Maurice or every living being in the goddamn castle?

245
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
In this version, the beast letting Belle go is no longer him placing Belle's needs in front of his own,

246
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
but instead deciding that Maurice's life is worth more than everyone in the castle, who he has now doomed to death.

247
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Point being here that the movie wanted to up the stakes. Fine.

248
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But it fundamentally changed what is supposed to be the emotional core of the story.

249
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That being beast's growth as a person who can put other people's needs before his own.

250
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Because this rubs up against the whole thrust of the story,

251
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
the higher stakes kind of necessitates that the enchanted objects explain their plight to Belle.

252
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What happens when the last petal falls?

253
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
The master remains a beast forever, and we become antiques.

254
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yes, logically it would make sense for Lumiere Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts to do this,

255
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
but it diminishes what should be the emotional core of the story.

256
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That Belle develops these feelings on her own terms, in her own time.

257
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
She doesn't do it because their fucking lives on the line.

258
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
She does it because she falls in love with him because he begins to live as his best self,

259
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
not because of a trolley problem, which she proceeds to ignore anyway because Maurice needs help.

260
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And while we're here on the topic of terrible editing, what is this?

261
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Chip! Have you seen Chip? He ran off!

262
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Oh no.

263
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Mom!

264
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What was Chip jumping from?

265
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Why is this happening? Was this scene really in need of more stakes out of nowhere?

266
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Oh no.

267
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Mom!

268
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
If I can't live as a cop, I'll die as a cop.

269
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
See, over-explaining everything in this case not only insults the intelligence of the audience,

270
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
which is perhaps deserved because there is a certain sect of film commentators who have built careers off of complaining

271
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
that their hands are not being held through the entire narrative,

272
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
it also diminishes what should be a fairly simple but powerful story about love, forgiveness, redemption,

273
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and discovering your best self.

274
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But it's really hard for the Beast to discover his best self in this movie.

275
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Because there isn't one.

276
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
The Beast was a challenge in the original movie because he had to be scary, repulsive, a huge jerk,

277
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
and eventually, extremely likable.

278
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Part of this is accomplished through the medium of animation, which with a skilled animator

279
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
is much better able to capture clear and complex emotions.

280
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
This shot early on in the film shows an inner conflict and complexity at a point in the narrative where he's still the bad guy,

281
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
and all with no dialogue.

282
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The Beast's transformation is inspired by wanting to do right by Belle,

283
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and Belle being kind to him in turn is earned.

284
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
She doesn't become his life coach, nor does she train him in the art of being nice,

285
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
but she does give credit where credit is due.

286
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
2017 Beast is a massive prick.

287
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Idiots!

288
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And I don't mean like, he's an arrogant prick but then he learns the error of his ways,

289
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
like, I think this is supposed to be charming.

290
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Actually, Romeo and Juliet's my favorite play.

291
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Why is that not a surprise?

292
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm sorry?

293
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
See, this is what is called a neg, popularized by Neil Strauss' 2005 book, The Game.

294
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
No, I don't have a copy of The Game lying around.

295
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I want that heartache and pining and...

296
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The Beast saves Belle from wolves, and while he's out cold,

297
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Mrs. Potts explained that it's kind of the staff's fault he grew up to be a jerk,

298
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
and when he comes to and Belle professes her fondness for Romeo and Juliet...

299
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Why is that not a surprise?

300
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Classic neg.

301
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
When I enter the room, laughter dies.

302
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Well, it might be because you abuse them and they're afraid of you.

303
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Idiots!

304
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
See, this moment could have paid off by adding, like, one line where she explained that his staff is afraid of him,

305
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and maybe it could be a growth moment.

306
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
When I enter the room, laughter dies.

307
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But, nah.

308
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
There are a lot of small bewildering changes to the Beast's character

309
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
that I just... I don't understand why they're there.

310
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Gone is this humanizing moment where the Beast realized his anger got the better of him and he made a huge mistake.

311
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Get out!

312
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Go!

313
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Go!

314
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So when he shows up to save Belle from wolves, it's kind of out of nowhere,

315
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
because he never has that emotional beat of realizing he made a mistake.

316
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
In this version, Belle doesn't have a deal with the Beast, so she can't renege on it.

317
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Where are you going?

318
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Promise or no promise, I can't stay here another minute.

319
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Which not only begs the question of why she sticks around,

320
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
but also adds a particularly yikes dynamic to the scene where she's running away

321
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
and everyone in the castle is trying to imprison her.

322
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Here he is beating her in the face with a giant snowball,

323
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
which he then laughs about.

324
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Not even like an, oh shit!

325
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Like, that she broke her nose!

326
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Then followed by the change in the library scene.

327
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
In the original, it follows the Beast's change of heart.

328
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
He wants to do something for Belle that she will appreciate.

329
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I've never felt this way about anyone.

330
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I want to do something for her.

331
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
In the remake, it's just him showing off.

332
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So many better things to read.

333
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Like what?

334
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Well, there are a couple of things in here you could start with.

335
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Like, check out my library. It's pretty sweet.

336
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You can look at it, I guess.

337
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
All of these small changes add up.

338
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Beast doesn't earn Belle's affection,

339
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
so she's trying harder than he is

340
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
and ends up his f***ing life coach

341
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
like she was in Belle's Enchanted Christmas

342
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
and ends up doing all the f***ing work.

343
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The Beast is just a mediocre man

344
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
who fails into success by possessing the right objects

345
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
despite never making any effort to rise to her needs

346
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
and figure out what she wants.

347
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Fine, I guess I'll go down to your level.

348
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And this scene doesn't read that way in the animated movie,

349
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
where the Beast actually makes an effort to use a spoon

350
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
but he physically cannot.

351
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
But the worst thing is that these two have no chemistry at all.

352
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's foolish, I suppose,

353
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
for a creature like me to hope that one day he might earn your affection.

354
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Do you know?

355
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
But all the same, I never really buy that she grows to care for him.

356
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's honestly hilarious how quickly she ghosts him when he lets her go.

357
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And then at the end when she's crying over him,

358
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
there's just no chemistry here.

359
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I just don't buy it.

360
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And this scene is super not helped by the freaking enchantress

361
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
barging in on what is supposed to be a private, intimate moment.

362
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Thanks for that, Becky.

363
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It would have been great if he nagged her after he turned back into a man.

364
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Said something like,

365
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Wow, your pores are much less noticeable now that I have human eyes.

366
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And she's like,

367
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It is you!

368
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Movie needs to be longer!

369
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So it pads us up with a bunch of crap that doesn't go anywhere.

370
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Some of these additions are plot related.

371
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
A small example is the rose thing,

372
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
a plot element from the original story.

373
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Belle's bitchy sisters ask their father for niceties,

374
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
where the virtuous, humble beauty asks only for a single rose.

375
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
In the original movie, the rose is a gift offered by the enchantress,

376
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
which then turns into the film's ticking clock.

377
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
The Seventeen remake decides,

378
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Hey, why don't we have both?

379
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
So the new movie keeps the rose and adds a backup rose,

380
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
as in the original story, and this goes nowhere and I hate it.

381
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Belle doesn't have bitchy sisters who ask for nicer things,

382
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
with the humble Belle asking only for a rose.

383
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Here Belle asks for a rose because,

384
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What can I bring you from the market?

385
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
A rose? Like the one in the painting?

386
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I don't know, something to do with the mom.

387
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
We'll get to the mom.

388
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Food and water is fine, but don't you dare touch my roses.

389
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Apparently that's what happens around here when you pick a flower.

390
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Oh, but it doesn't stop there, because we have to over explain everything.

391
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The Beast is like traumatized by roses.

392
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I received eternal damnation for one.

393
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm merely locking him away.

394
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
He explains this with his words, and that is why he locks up Maurice.

395
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Another truly bewildering change is Lumiere and Cogsworth going behind the Beast's back

396
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
rather than having that humanizing moment

397
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
and having it be his decision to put her in a nice room instead of the tower.

398
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'll show you to your room.

399
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
My room? But I thought...

400
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You want to stay in the tower?

401
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
No.

402
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Then follow me.

403
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Therefore, it is Lumiere who told her not to go into the West Wing.

404
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
The castle is your home now, so feel free to go anywhere you like.

405
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Except the West Wing, which we do not have.

406
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Not the Beast.

407
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
What's in the West Wing?

408
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's forbidden.

409
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So there is no tension and there is no betrayal in this scene

410
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
because the Beast never laid down that boundary, which she then crossed.

411
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
What are you doing here?

412
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Why you mad, bro?

413
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
But some of the changes are character...

414
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
...depthening.

415
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I think the intent here was to make the town sympathetic and redeemable,

416
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
which they weren't really in the original and that was kind of the point.

417
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The original movie actually has a rather cynical opinion of the masses.

418
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
That people are easily duped in the face of things that are strange and foreign

419
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
and it doesn't pull its punches on that point.

420
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
But the 17 Remake does by making the town redeemable,

421
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
which isn't really earned, nor is there any emotional payoff

422
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
when, I don't know, Mrs. Potts reunites with Mr. Potts?

423
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And Cogsworth is reunited with his apparent nag of a wife

424
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
and then begs to be turned back into a clock.

425
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Turned back into a clock.

426
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Turned back into a clock.

427
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Thanks, I hate it.

428
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
So on the one hand, there's this bid to make Gaston kind of sympathetic

429
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
by implying that he has PTSD, a truly stupid and insulting change that adds nothing.

430
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Look, Gaston doesn't need damage.

431
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
He is the high school jock everybody admires.

432
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
He's a hunter.

433
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
He doesn't need to be more than that.

434
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
He just needs to be a big handsome dummy everyone loves

435
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
because he's arrogant and good looking.

436
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Because that tends to be how it happens in the real world

437
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
and that's kind of the point of the movie.

438
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
So the addition of Gaston was in the war is awful.

439
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Not only does it add backstory that goes nowhere,

440
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
but as the film goes on, it's less he was in the war,

441
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
he's damaged so much as he's like a blood psychopath

442
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
that appears to be aroused by the mere thought of violence.

443
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Make happy thoughts.

444
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Go back to the war.

445
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Blood, explosions, countless widows.

446
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Widows.

447
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
The remake has Gaston giving Maurice the benefit of the doubt

448
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
and it seems to be going in the direction of making Gaston

449
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
kind of more reasonable and sympathetic, but then boom, blood rage.

450
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So instead of Gaston being widely admired,

451
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
not only is his characterization inconsistent and splotchy,

452
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Wonderful book you have there.

453
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Have you read it?

454
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Well, not that one, but you know, books.

455
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The town is kind of skeptical towards him.

456
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Gaston, did you try to kill Maurice?

457
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
So much that during Gaston, LeFou is paying people to sing.

458
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Why add this?

459
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Why can't Gaston be genuinely admired by a small town

460
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
who is taken in by a good looking guy who is secretly, internally monstrous?

461
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Why do we need to make the town both more bigoted and more sympathetic?

462
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
They're a poor provincial town.

463
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
They're basic.

464
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
They take everything at face value, including Gaston, Belle, and the Beast.

465
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
That's the whole point. I hate it.

466
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But the worst edition has got to be the Book of Teleportation.

467
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Okay, so the Belle's plague mother backstory change is a suggestion

468
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
that should have been killed in the screenplay stage

469
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
because it is so, so pointless and adds nothing.

470
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
So Belle's mother was an artist and died of plague.

471
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Maurice never tells Belle for some reason.

472
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Please, just tell me one more thing about her.

473
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
But don't worry, Beast has, like, a book that not only transcends space, but also time.

474
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
So towards the end, they go to Paris.

475
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Beast makes a tourism joke.

476
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
The Champs-Élysées. No, too touristy.

477
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Belle talks about the Paris of my childhood.

478
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
This is the Paris of my childhood.

479
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
There's a plague mask.

480
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
A doctor's mask.

481
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And Belle's like, I get it now.

482
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And I guess they bond over their mother's dying young and tragic.

483
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Then later in the scene in the padded wagon,

484
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I know what happened to Maman.

485
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I learned about tragic backstory, Papa.

486
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And now we can resolve the conflict we didn't have and also has nothing to do with the story.

487
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
The addition of the space-time book begs the question of why they never used it later.

488
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Hmm, if Maurice is in danger, it sure would be handy if we, I don't know,

489
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
had some sort of device that got us from point A to point B in an instant.

490
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
The worst aspect of this is that it adds inner conflict that doesn't really need to be resolved.

491
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Belle wants to know her backstory.

492
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
What happened to Mom?

493
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Fine.

494
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
What does that have to do with her learning to love the Beast?

495
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
What does that have to do with the Beast learning to put her needs before his own?

496
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Hell, it doesn't even really drive a wedge between Belle and Maurice.

497
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It's not driving a conflict between her and anyone.

498
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
It really has nothing to do with Gaston.

499
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It's just jammed in there, and it feels like it's yet another metatextual response.

500
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Where are all the Disney moms?

501
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
asks the clickbait sites.

502
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Well, here's your answer. She dead.

503
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Does it add anything to the story?

504
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Does it enhance the characters?

505
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Does it deepen any relationships? No.

506
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
But it does offer a response to the complaint that Disney princesses have largely absent mother figures,

507
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,000
which itself wasn't really a criticism of this story so much as a question of the broader trend in Disney movies.

508
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Where are the moms?

509
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Hey, did you know that this movie has the first gay?

510
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
When it was announced that LeFou would become the first out gay character in a Disney movie,

511
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:36,000
the L's, the G's, the B's, the T's, and of course all you filthy, filthy Q's responded with uproarious applause.

512
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:48,000
So yeah, the LGBT community responded overwhelmingly with,

513
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
F***ing really?

514
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Which got upgraded to are you f***ing kidding me when we saw the final product

515
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
and the only out thing about LeFou that wasn't completely subtext was this shot.

516
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Wow. Such gay. Very representation.

517
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So a lot of people were very validly annoyed that this was the best that we could get for the first out gay in a Disney movie.

518
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Well, I used to be on Gaston's side, but we are so in a bad place right now.

519
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
You're too good for him anyway.

520
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
The buffoon character whose name translates to the fool.

521
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You're welcome gays.

522
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
But the worst offender on the front of cheap, safe Hollywood liberalism is Belle, feminist icon.

523
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
What on earth are you doing? Teaching another girl to read. Isn't one enough?

524
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Introducing Beast for Sheen.

525
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Feminism written by straight white men whose feminism appears to have pretty much began and ended with Disney feminism from the 90's.

526
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I'm a fast learner.

527
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
A damsel in distress?

528
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm a damsel. I'm in distress. I can handle this. Have a nice day.

529
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Okay, and I honestly don't want to shit all over he for she. I think a lot of people in America and the UK miss that it's supposed to be a global thing.

530
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:15,000
This is not a dig on Emma Watson, who I honestly think is a net positive and I really respect that she uses her platform to advance a more globally oriented brand of feminism.

531
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
But!

532
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Somewhere along the line Disney decided, hey, as long as we're using this movie to respond to every criticism lobbed against the original, we should probably go ahead and appease the feminists while we're here.

533
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So Belle helps Maurice with his clocks.

534
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Thank you.

535
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Maurice calls her ahead of her time.

536
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I was so ahead of her time. It was different.

537
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:48,000
She leans in. Belle attempts to escape the castle twice, which is so much more feminist than the original where she attempts to escape a mirror once.

538
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Jesus Christ, I'm surprised that they didn't like have Belle like look directly into the camera and ask the audience if they thought she was developing Stockholm Syndrome.

539
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
The biggest and most egregious addition is, of course, Belle's goddamn washing machine.

540
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
A thing she invented while also promoting female literacy.

541
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
But oh no, here comes the patriarchy.

542
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,000
What on earth are you doing? Teaching another girl to read isn't one enough.

543
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Wow, it sure will be satisfying later in the movie when this guy learns the error of his ways and that female literacy is important.

544
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Oh wait, and then they smash her washing machine. Destroy it.

545
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I mean at least you tried, Belle.

546
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
All I wanted was to teach a child to read.

547
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Too bad that washing machine or your inventing skills will never be mentioned in the movie again.

548
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And I honestly hate to point out historical accuracy issues in a Disney movie because I do not care.

549
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I realize that this is a sticking point for a lot of people complaining about the accuracy of the era that inspired the film, but I don't care.

550
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Boy, there's no depth to how much I don't care about that line of thinking.

551
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:09,000
However, since the movie decides to play up the historical aspect of the film and decides to definitively set the film in a period of French history that wasn't looking too bright for absolute f***ing monarchs.

552
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
After all, miss, this is France.

553
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Female literacy was not a thing that was exactly frowned upon in this particular culture in this particular period in history.

554
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
There were lots of magazines specifically for young women.

555
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
The original Beauty and the Beast was even published in one of those magazines.

556
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
So this was not a thing.

557
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And I hate this because not only was it not a thing, it doesn't go anywhere.

558
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:37,000
At no point does this guy or anyone in the town really ever have a come to Jesus moment and realize that like sexism is bad and literacy is good.

559
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
But hey, Beast for she.

560
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Likewise, Belle being an inventor also never pays off.

561
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
She never like invents a thing that helps the Beast or the castle staff.

562
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Hell, she doesn't even get them out of the padded wagon at the end.

563
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
In the original, Chip blasts them out.

564
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
You guys gotta try this thing.

565
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
In this version, Maurice does it.

566
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
But don't worry, he uses Belle's hairpin.

567
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Lean in, Belle.

568
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
The worst thing about this is that the movie kind of implies that the bigotry of the town is

569
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
A. Partially enchantment induced.

570
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Which, yuck.

571
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
B. A problem that can slash is solved.

572
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
All they need to do is get woke.

573
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I remember! I do!

574
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,000
It adds all this crap about bigotry without understanding its underlying causes, which are neither rational nor enchantment.

575
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
The original movie was actually really good about this subtext.

576
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
It gets that the bigotry of the town is heavily emotion driven and not really dictated by logic.

577
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
That's kind of the point, and that's why Gaston is so easily able to manipulate them.

578
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
The Beast will make off with your children!

579
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
He'll come after them in the night!

580
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
The Beast will make off with your jobs!

581
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
He'll come crossing over the border at night!

582
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Wow, these villagers sure do have a lot of socioeconomic anxiety.

583
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Meanwhile, the New York Times is over here writing like 800 profiles on anti-Beast villagers and why they still follow Gaston.

584
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
But in the remake, the villagers see the error of their ways,

585
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
while not demonstrating that they have actually learned anything.

586
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
But don't worry, they won't be sexist or bigoted anymore.

587
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And suddenly, he wasn't racist anymore.

588
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Problem solved.

589
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I'll be the racist!

590
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Well, not anymore.

591
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Dragon!

592
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Boy, that was easy. Beast for she.

593
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
So it's not even that these common bad faith criticisms of the original movie exist and they're such popular talking points.

594
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Yeah, that is kind of annoying and basic, but you know, whatever.

595
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
But the key to success under Eiger, where it never took off under Eisner,

596
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
is that these live action remakes have to add something to their originals, make meta commentary on them.

597
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
So here we have a film that fixes plot holes that don't need to be fixed,

598
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
adds dimension to characters that don't go anywhere,

599
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
tacks on weird plot crap that likewise does not go anywhere,

600
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
and shoves in some lazy hat tips to their version of progressivism.

601
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
But that this formula has proven so successful,

602
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
boy, I can't wait for Dumbo, now with more emotional support,

603
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
and Mulan, but not a musical, because China doesn't like musicals.

604
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
But the worst thing to me is how much this new approach doesn't feel like Disney.

605
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And by Disney, I mean Walt, who, independent of Cocteau, had a similar approach to storytelling.

606
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
According to Walt Disney,

607
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
whether he be six or sixty, call the child innocence.

608
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
The worst of us is not without innocence, although buried deeply it might be.

609
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
In my work, I try to reach and speak to that innocence, showing it the fun and joy of living.

610
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
The original Beauty and the Beast feels in the spirit of both Walt and Cocteau,

611
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
but the new one is just cynical.

612
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
The merger with Fox Studios is another major element here.

613
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
That means fewer movies will be released in general,

614
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
and given how safe these live action remakes are,

615
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
more resources will be put into far fewer productions.

616
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Again, to go back to that Eisner memo, we have no obligation to make art.

617
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
We have no obligation to make history.

618
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
We have no obligation to make a statement, but to make money.

619
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It is often important to make history, to make art, or to make a significant statement.

620
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
In order to make money, we must always make entertaining movies,

621
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
and if we make entertaining movies, at time, we will reliably make history, art, a statement, or all three.

622
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
So, Disney under Eiger certainly makes money.

623
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Congrats for that.

624
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
But they are no longer making history.

625
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
This is just safe regurgitation of brands we've already seen catering to a nostalgia-hungry market.

626
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And that wouldn't be so bad,

627
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
but more and more, this comes at the cost of the creation of anything new.

628
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And when Eiger saw the breadth of his domain, he wept,

629
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
for there were no more properties to remake.

630
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Parts of this episode were inspired by reading James B. Stewart's book Disney War,

631
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
an audiobook I listened to while stuck in traffic.

632
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And I like to listen to really long non-fiction like this book while stuck in traffic.

633
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
This episode was sponsored in part by Audible.

634
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Audible has the largest selection of audiobooks on the planet,

635
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
and there is a lot of really great long non-fiction that is perfect for your otherwise wasted hours stuck in traffic.

636
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Audible members get a credit every month good for any audiobook in their store,

637
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
regardless of price, and unused credits roll over to the next month.

638
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
If you don't like an audiobook, you can exchange it with no hassle,

639
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
plus your audiobooks are yours to keep forever even if you cancel.

640
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
You can go to audible.com slash Lindsay Ellis.

641
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Yes, it's just audible.com slash my legal given name to get started.

642
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
