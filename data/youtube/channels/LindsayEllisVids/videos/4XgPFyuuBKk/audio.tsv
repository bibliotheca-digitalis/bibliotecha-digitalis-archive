0	11000	Aren't you happy Game of Thrones is back?
11000	12000	Yay!
12000	15320	I thought us up a George RR Martini.
15320	18000	It involves fire and- No.
18000	19000	Fire.
19000	20000	No.
20000	27400	According to my Game of Thrones house things, I should be Tyrell.
27400	29880	This is- Oh god, I can smell it from here.
29880	39880	This is sriracha, because all my house quizzes tell me I'm a Targaryen, so cheers!
39880	43880	Just wait until I make a, you know, fire gun.
43880	45880	Oh, I will hate that.
45880	47880	You know how I hate tasty things.
47880	52160	So before we talk about Cinder, let's talk about some of the ideas people threw at us
52160	59480	regarding Arisen, and the dystopia discussion that we had last week.
60080	65880	While we were kind of poo-pooing dystopia as an idea for the sequel, Emily Hopkins suggested
65880	70720	that it would be like New Moon meets dystopia, Riley leaves her and it's like the end of
70720	74080	the world, and then it is literally the end of the world, but she's too depressed to even
74080	75480	care or notice.
75480	79640	Hey, that would definitely- And then like, you know, because our idea was instead of
79640	83880	like in New Moon where it's like November, it was just going to be ellipses for like
83880	88480	45 minutes, and then at the end of it there's like a totalitarian government.
89480	94480	We were fitted for our uniforms today, but I don't care.
94480	102480	Guest said, remember when a matriarchal society in a sci-fi post-apocalyptic setting was written
102480	105480	as if it was mind-blowing and terrifying?
105480	108480	Would Sarah Ellenson accidentally write something like that?
108480	109480	I think she would.
109480	110480	I think she would, yeah.
110480	112480	In fact, I think that's how we bring Scarlett back into this.
112480	115480	Yeah, she's like the leader of the matriarchy.
115480	118480	And all the women are scorned.
118480	119480	Everyone's scorned.
119480	122480	It's like they scorned us so we will destroy them.
122480	123480	So they just have their meetings.
123480	126480	They never talk about their scorn, and they were like, we will have revenge.
126480	129480	Oh, one of my favorite was- I didn't write this one down.
129480	131480	Whoever said this.
131480	136480	I think we finally had a winner in the race to complete Arisen.
136480	137480	Oh yeah.
137480	141480	And that was simply another.
141480	142480	We need it.
142480	144480	I like this title, another.
144480	145480	I was like, another.
147480	153480	So I feel like, you know, we want to take it in a funnier direction and more, yeah.
153480	157480	And so I think, rather than Arisen, which I think a YA book would actually be called,
157480	158480	I like another.
158480	159480	Yeah.
159480	164480	Lauren Kate suggests that book two, there tends to be a big undercurrent in YA these
164480	170480	days, to borrow the idea from the Lego movie of this special.
170480	171480	I think we could play that up.
171480	173480	Although that was definitely there in the first one.
173480	175480	I haven't seen the Lego movie yet.
177480	178480	Don't talk to me.
178480	183480	Lauren Kate's also said that, you know, even the worst of YA dystopias are at least, you
183480	187480	know, a little bit of a metaphor, which, you know, Divergent isn't really.
187480	191480	And they might be paper thin and obvious, but, you know, it's there.
191480	194480	And Sarah doesn't exactly get layers.
194480	198480	So if you're going to do dystopia, whatever would normally be presented as a metaphor
198480	203480	needs to be, like, 100% on the nose.
203480	205480	I wonder what that could be, though.
205480	207480	So they take their guns away or something.
207480	211480	No, like there's a health care system called Shmo-shmama-shmare.
214480	218480	And they're like, no, but I want to visit my doctor.
219480	221480	They raise the minimum wage.
221480	222480	No!
222480	223480	No!
224480	227480	And the moochers, like, crawl out.
227480	229480	They're like the Morlocks.
233480	234480	Review in time.
234480	240480	We decided next week we're going to go with Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children
240480	242480	based on popularity of suggestion.
242480	247480	Before we start talking about Cinder, so we're going to do this one in two weeks.
247480	248480	So we have two weeks to read it.
248480	249480	Another library copy.
249480	250480	Thank you, Queens Library.
250480	251480	You are awesome.
251480	256480	We picked this one because we presumed it wasn't focused on romance.
256480	257480	We could be wrong.
257480	258480	Yeah.
258480	262480	For the next one, I say give us something adult, reasonably popular,
262480	265480	within the last five years, little or no romance.
265480	270480	So we can focus less on romance, even though that is relevant to our Cthulhu love.
270480	272480	We still have to read that Ypres love.
272480	275480	Yeah, at some point we've got to read Ypres love.
275480	276480	Or just keep pushing up.
276480	277480	Yeah, it was like next year.
278480	286480	Cinder, speaking of romance, the Cyborg Cinderella retelling for our modern age by Marissa Meyer.
286480	290480	We read that, and it did indeed have a cyborg foot.
290480	291480	Yes.
291480	293480	Nella, what did you think of Cinder?
293480	299480	Reading Cinder, I was struck by how well the plot moved along.
299480	306480	It definitely kept up its pace and definitely got straight to the cliffhanger ending.
307480	308480	It was a snappy one.
308480	309480	It's a series.
311480	313480	But yeah, it was very snappy.
313480	315480	I did really like the main character.
315480	318480	You know, with Cinderella stories, yes, we want to see her go to the ball.
318480	320480	We want to see her be triumphant.
320480	324480	This definitely took that and didn't want to do that.
324480	325480	I mean, it hit the ball thing.
325480	329480	It hit some of the things you consider vital to a Cinderella story.
329480	330480	It hit the class thing.
330480	335480	But those were just the background noise of what this book is actually about,
335480	336480	which is...
336480	337480	Revolution.
337480	338480	Revolution.
338480	339480	Imagine that.
339480	340480	And, you know, a tyrant.
340480	341480	Yeah.
341480	342480	Invasion.
347480	351480	The tyrant is basically a completely unironic version of Scarlet.
351480	352480	I know.
352480	354480	She has auburn hair and everything.
354480	355480	I know.
355480	357480	She's like walking all sexy.
357480	358480	Like the evil queen.
358480	362480	Well, it's funny because she shows up and everyone's like,
363480	365480	Oh, the evil queen is here.
365480	366480	I know.
366480	367480	That's the thing.
367480	369480	It's like not even at some point is someone like,
369480	370480	Oh, she's not that bad.
370480	371480	No, everyone's like,
371480	374480	Well, the evil queen's in town.
374480	376480	She sure is evil.
376480	379480	She mind controlling, baby killing.
379480	380480	Yep.
380480	381480	Kills babies.
381480	382480	Evil queen.
382480	383480	Boy, she's evil.
383480	384480	Doesn't like mirrors.
384480	385480	Sure is hot.
385480	386480	Oh, boy, she hot.
386480	388480	That's the worst thing about the evil queen.
389480	393480	She might look pretty, but the truth is she ugly.
393480	394480	Oh, she ugly.
394480	395480	She ugly.
395480	396480	She ugly.
396480	397480	That's the worst thing a woman can be.
397480	399480	She shows up and she's all like,
404480	407480	That's what she's hiding under the veil she always wears.
407480	408480	Her mustache.
409480	411480	That she's true.
414480	416480	That's half the book read like,
416480	417480	And everyone's like,
417480	418480	God, she's evil.
418480	421480	But talking about evil characters, there's another character.
421480	424480	There's a doctor character who shows up and you think,
424480	425480	Oh, now Cinder's going to get it.
425480	427480	Like, this guy is no good.
427480	429480	He seems to have an obsession with young girls.
430480	431480	Literally.
431480	433480	Literally a thing about young girls.
433480	435480	And it's super creepy.
435480	438480	Well, he's kind of set up like this Dr. Mingel,
438480	444480	like doing literal, literal Auschwitz experiments on cyborgs.
444480	447480	But no, then he turns out to be an ally.
447480	450480	And we never go back to examine,
450480	454480	so 27 cyborgs have died by your hand.
454480	456480	He's a Dr. Fungal.
458480	461480	It is just completely accepted in this universe
461480	464480	that cyborgs are second class citizens.
464480	466480	And it is never explained.
466480	468480	They're just like, they're people.
468480	471480	They're humans that have like, you know, artificial hearts
471480	473480	or, you know, bionic arms or whatever.
473480	476480	Or there's the one guy that gets listed as a cyborg
476480	477480	who's just missing a foot.
477480	478480	Yeah.
478480	481480	He's got like a peg leg that happens to have like a little robot.
483480	485480	I want to know what happened in this world
485480	487480	to turn people so against prosthetics.
487480	488480	Yeah.
488480	490480	I mean, if you get a titanium hip replacement,
490480	492480	does that make you count as a cyborg now?
492480	494480	Yeah, this world is incredibly...
494480	496480	Was there the cyborg wars?
496480	499480	Yeah, was that World War IV that they mentioned?
499480	500480	This world is incredibly ableist.
500480	502480	I mean, is it like Star Trek where like,
502480	504480	oh no, not eugenics, the eugenics war.
504480	506480	But they never mention it.
506480	508480	Okay, granted, this is book one of three,
508480	510480	so maybe it gets mentioned.
510480	513480	But as it is, it's never even alluded to
513480	516480	why cyborgs are so shat upon.
516480	519480	They're like, basically, literally slaves.
519480	523480	Like, can be owned and sold for no reason
523480	525480	other than they have prosthetic foot.
525480	527480	Which of course is our Cinderella thing.
527480	529480	Her foot comes off.
529480	530480	Which I thought was clever.
530480	532480	I feel like, it depends on what you like.
532480	535480	It felt on the younger end of YA to me.
535480	537480	Because it was A, really short.
537480	539480	Compared to something like
539480	540480	Daughter of Smoke and Bone series,
540480	542480	or even Twilight, or The Fifth Wave.
542480	545480	It was really short and super predictable.
545480	548480	Like, the twist at the end is like,
548480	550480	it was so obvious, it's like, it can't be that.
550480	551480	It's gonna be a bait and switch.
551480	552480	It has to be a bait and switch.
552480	553480	No, I knew it was gonna be that.
553480	554480	No, it wasn't.
554480	556480	The characters are not super deep,
556480	559480	but it was like, all concept.
559480	560480	But the concept I thought worked.
560480	561480	But it was fun.
561480	562480	Yeah, it was fun.
562480	563480	It was a fun concept.
563480	566480	And I would definitely wanna read the next three books.
566480	567480	Yeah, no, I'm on board.
567480	569480	I'm like, I wanna see what happens to Cinder.
569480	570480	Yeah.
570480	572480	I wanna find out about the lunar...
572480	575480	So there's a nation on the moon
575480	577480	that's been there for hundreds of years
577480	579480	and supposedly they're really wealthy
579480	581480	and self-sustainable on the moon.
581480	584480	I really wanna know how that happened.
584480	586480	I hope they go into that.
586480	587480	I do.
587480	588480	Because I'm kinda like,
588480	590480	Mars has the ice cap?
590480	591480	Yeah.
592480	594480	The moon's got a whole lot of nothing.
594480	596480	So anyway, Marissa Meyer,
596480	597480	someone in the comments pointed out
597480	600480	that she was apparently a former fan fiction author.
602480	604480	Which is apparently for like,
604480	606480	Sailor Moon, which I think
606480	608480	really makes a lot of sense
608480	610480	considering the four books.
610480	612480	It's like, Sailor Cinder.
614480	615480	Sailor Scarlet.
615480	617480	Sailor Winter.
617480	620480	I mean, this isn't like Fifty Shades of Grey
620480	622480	where it's just like, I'm taking my, you know...
622480	624480	No, this is an example of someone
624480	627480	who wrote fan fiction who did a good job with it.
627480	628480	Well, I mean, I think it's like
628480	630480	she took the things she liked about the fandom
630480	631480	that she was in and reapplied it
631480	633480	to a completely different thing.
633480	635480	Which I can totally dig.
635480	637480	I really, I can't express how little
637480	640480	I cared about the romance and also didn't buy it.
640480	642480	Well, also, I just really felt like
642480	644480	they both just needed a puppy.
644480	645480	There are so many larger things at stake
645480	646480	and she keeps going,
646480	647480	he's not gonna like me.
647480	649480	And I get that that's the thing
649480	650480	that teenagers will relate to,
650480	651480	does he like me?
651480	652480	Yeah.
652480	654480	But in this case, I didn't buy it
654480	656480	because the stakes were so high.
656480	658480	It's like, get your shit together.
658480	659480	Yeah.
659480	660480	Come on, focus.
660480	661480	I realize you're 16,
661480	663480	but you're framed as smarter than that.
663480	664480	Yeah.
664480	665480	Someone in the comments asked
665480	667480	if there is a Tiger's Curse comparison
667480	669480	because this does take place in New Beijing,
669480	671480	which is like a thousand-ish years
671480	673480	in the future or something.
673480	674480	No.
674480	675480	No.
675480	676480	No.
676480	678480	Because Tiger's Curse at least tries
678480	681480	to incorporate the culture.
681480	683480	This one does not at all.
683480	684480	Someone alluded to,
684480	685480	someone's wearing a kimono
685480	687480	or maybe there's a Buddha in the corner
687480	688480	or something,
688480	690480	but it really has fuck all to do with China.
690480	691480	Yeah.
691480	693480	And it's very much about a,
693480	696480	all the continents have pretty much
696480	698480	been divvied up into commonwealths.
698480	700480	Europe is Europe.
700480	703480	Africa is United Africa or something.
704480	706480	South America has apparently been
706480	707480	bombed into obliteration.
707480	708480	Yeah.
708480	709480	Because they're never,
709480	710480	Australia is still its own thing.
710480	711480	Hey, well.
711480	713480	But it was a part of an interesting point.
713480	714480	I wanted to bring this one up.
714480	717480	This is called The Summer Prince,
717480	722480	which is a considerably less well-known YA book.
722480	726480	This one is on the much, much more adult,
726480	728480	like older YA.
728480	729480	It's a lot more heady.
729480	730480	It's a lot more conceptual.
730480	731480	It's a lot more sci-fi.
731480	734480	This one takes place in a science fiction future Brazil.
734480	736480	But I wanted to bring this one up
736480	740480	because it definitely brings in the culture
740480	744480	and applies it to this potential future.
744480	748480	It is very grounded in the culture of Brazil.
748480	750480	And honestly, I feel like,
750480	751480	this is YA technically,
751480	754480	but I feel like it would appeal more to adults
754480	757480	than teenagers because it is not very,
757480	758480	does he like me?
758480	760480	It's very the opposite of that.
760480	761480	Well, at least Cinder.
761480	763480	I mean, because it's implied like,
763480	764480	she's from Europe.
764480	766480	Yeah, Cinder's kind of implied white.
766480	767480	Yeah.
767480	768480	It's kind of a shame.
768480	769480	Yeah.
769480	771480	She never explicitly said white,
771480	772480	but she's like,
772480	773480	are you from Europe?
773480	774480	Like, who?
774480	775480	All right, so that's Cinder.
775480	778480	Great if you like concept and fast, snappy reads.
778480	779480	Yeah.
779480	781480	And just, you know, a fun and easy thing.
781480	782480	I mean, we're coming into summer,
782480	784480	so definitely I'd say it's a beach book.
784480	785480	Yeah, this is a beach book.
785480	786480	Definitely.
786480	787480	Kill it two, three hours.
787480	788480	Two weeks from now, this one,
788480	790480	made into a movie by Tim Burton.
790480	791480	Really?
791480	793480	I don't know how I feel about that.
793480	794480	Well, I won't know how I feel about that
794480	795480	until I read it.
795480	797480	Well, I guess I have to drink this, don't I?
797480	798480	Yep.
798480	799480	Look, well,
799480	801480	you can take a, like, shot.
803480	805480	I'm just gonna smell.
805480	807480	I do not like sriracha.
807480	808480	You don't like sriracha?
808480	810480	I must be the only asshole in this entire
810480	812480	fucking city that doesn't like sriracha.
812480	813480	Sriracha's, like,
814480	815480	life.
816480	817480	Fire and blood.
818480	819480	Yep, that's, um,
822480	823480	it's a cocktail.
824480	826480	It's good.
826480	827480	Honest.
827480	828480	I just, I don't like spicy.
828480	830480	Mmm-mmm!
830480	831480	Lindsay.
831480	834480	Well, Nella doesn't get to do her rose thing next week,
834480	835480	so, give us something.
835480	836480	You mixologists in there,
836480	837480	and then we'll do it next,
837480	838480	in two weeks from now.
838480	840480	Even if it has something peculiar about it.
840480	841480	Something, something peculiar.
841480	842480	Give us something peculiar.
842480	843480	We'll tie it into this.
844480	845480	Oh right, Goodreads.

854480	855480	I log in sometimes,
855480	856480	and it logs me out of my Facebook.
856480	857480	Pain in the ass.
857480	858480	It is.
858480	859480	It totally is.
859480	860480	While we will read this in two weeks,
860480	861480	we will be back next week
861480	866480	to talk explicitly about another slash Arisen.
