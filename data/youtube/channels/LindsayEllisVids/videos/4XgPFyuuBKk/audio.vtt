WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
Aren't you happy Game of Thrones is back?

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Yay!

00:12.000 --> 00:15.320
I thought us up a George RR Martini.

00:15.320 --> 00:18.000
It involves fire and- No.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
Fire.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
No.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.400
According to my Game of Thrones house things, I should be Tyrell.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.880
This is- Oh god, I can smell it from here.

00:29.880 --> 00:39.880
This is sriracha, because all my house quizzes tell me I'm a Targaryen, so cheers!

00:39.880 --> 00:43.880
Just wait until I make a, you know, fire gun.

00:43.880 --> 00:45.880
Oh, I will hate that.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.880
You know how I hate tasty things.

00:47.880 --> 00:52.160
So before we talk about Cinder, let's talk about some of the ideas people threw at us

00:52.160 --> 00:59.480
regarding Arisen, and the dystopia discussion that we had last week.

01:00.080 --> 01:05.880
While we were kind of poo-pooing dystopia as an idea for the sequel, Emily Hopkins suggested

01:05.880 --> 01:10.720
that it would be like New Moon meets dystopia, Riley leaves her and it's like the end of

01:10.720 --> 01:14.080
the world, and then it is literally the end of the world, but she's too depressed to even

01:14.080 --> 01:15.480
care or notice.

01:15.480 --> 01:19.640
Hey, that would definitely- And then like, you know, because our idea was instead of

01:19.640 --> 01:23.880
like in New Moon where it's like November, it was just going to be ellipses for like

01:23.880 --> 01:28.480
45 minutes, and then at the end of it there's like a totalitarian government.

01:29.480 --> 01:34.480
We were fitted for our uniforms today, but I don't care.

01:34.480 --> 01:42.480
Guest said, remember when a matriarchal society in a sci-fi post-apocalyptic setting was written

01:42.480 --> 01:45.480
as if it was mind-blowing and terrifying?

01:45.480 --> 01:48.480
Would Sarah Ellenson accidentally write something like that?

01:48.480 --> 01:49.480
I think she would.

01:49.480 --> 01:50.480
I think she would, yeah.

01:50.480 --> 01:52.480
In fact, I think that's how we bring Scarlett back into this.

01:52.480 --> 01:55.480
Yeah, she's like the leader of the matriarchy.

01:55.480 --> 01:58.480
And all the women are scorned.

01:58.480 --> 01:59.480
Everyone's scorned.

01:59.480 --> 02:02.480
It's like they scorned us so we will destroy them.

02:02.480 --> 02:03.480
So they just have their meetings.

02:03.480 --> 02:06.480
They never talk about their scorn, and they were like, we will have revenge.

02:06.480 --> 02:09.480
Oh, one of my favorite was- I didn't write this one down.

02:09.480 --> 02:11.480
Whoever said this.

02:11.480 --> 02:16.480
I think we finally had a winner in the race to complete Arisen.

02:16.480 --> 02:17.480
Oh yeah.

02:17.480 --> 02:21.480
And that was simply another.

02:21.480 --> 02:22.480
We need it.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.480
I like this title, another.

02:24.480 --> 02:25.480
I was like, another.

02:27.480 --> 02:33.480
So I feel like, you know, we want to take it in a funnier direction and more, yeah.

02:33.480 --> 02:37.480
And so I think, rather than Arisen, which I think a YA book would actually be called,

02:37.480 --> 02:38.480
I like another.

02:38.480 --> 02:39.480
Yeah.

02:39.480 --> 02:44.480
Lauren Kate suggests that book two, there tends to be a big undercurrent in YA these

02:44.480 --> 02:50.480
days, to borrow the idea from the Lego movie of this special.

02:50.480 --> 02:51.480
I think we could play that up.

02:51.480 --> 02:53.480
Although that was definitely there in the first one.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.480
I haven't seen the Lego movie yet.

02:57.480 --> 02:58.480
Don't talk to me.

02:58.480 --> 03:03.480
Lauren Kate's also said that, you know, even the worst of YA dystopias are at least, you

03:03.480 --> 03:07.480
know, a little bit of a metaphor, which, you know, Divergent isn't really.

03:07.480 --> 03:11.480
And they might be paper thin and obvious, but, you know, it's there.

03:11.480 --> 03:14.480
And Sarah doesn't exactly get layers.

03:14.480 --> 03:18.480
So if you're going to do dystopia, whatever would normally be presented as a metaphor

03:18.480 --> 03:23.480
needs to be, like, 100% on the nose.

03:23.480 --> 03:25.480
I wonder what that could be, though.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.480
So they take their guns away or something.

03:27.480 --> 03:31.480
No, like there's a health care system called Shmo-shmama-shmare.

03:34.480 --> 03:38.480
And they're like, no, but I want to visit my doctor.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.480
They raise the minimum wage.

03:41.480 --> 03:42.480
No!

03:42.480 --> 03:43.480
No!

03:44.480 --> 03:47.480
And the moochers, like, crawl out.

03:47.480 --> 03:49.480
They're like the Morlocks.

03:53.480 --> 03:54.480
Review in time.

03:54.480 --> 04:00.480
We decided next week we're going to go with Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

04:00.480 --> 04:02.480
based on popularity of suggestion.

04:02.480 --> 04:07.480
Before we start talking about Cinder, so we're going to do this one in two weeks.

04:07.480 --> 04:08.480
So we have two weeks to read it.

04:08.480 --> 04:09.480
Another library copy.

04:09.480 --> 04:10.480
Thank you, Queens Library.

04:10.480 --> 04:11.480
You are awesome.

04:11.480 --> 04:16.480
We picked this one because we presumed it wasn't focused on romance.

04:16.480 --> 04:17.480
We could be wrong.

04:17.480 --> 04:18.480
Yeah.

04:18.480 --> 04:22.480
For the next one, I say give us something adult, reasonably popular,

04:22.480 --> 04:25.480
within the last five years, little or no romance.

04:25.480 --> 04:30.480
So we can focus less on romance, even though that is relevant to our Cthulhu love.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.480
We still have to read that Ypres love.

04:32.480 --> 04:35.480
Yeah, at some point we've got to read Ypres love.

04:35.480 --> 04:36.480
Or just keep pushing up.

04:36.480 --> 04:37.480
Yeah, it was like next year.

04:38.480 --> 04:46.480
Cinder, speaking of romance, the Cyborg Cinderella retelling for our modern age by Marissa Meyer.

04:46.480 --> 04:50.480
We read that, and it did indeed have a cyborg foot.

04:50.480 --> 04:51.480
Yes.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.480
Nella, what did you think of Cinder?

04:53.480 --> 04:59.480
Reading Cinder, I was struck by how well the plot moved along.

04:59.480 --> 05:06.480
It definitely kept up its pace and definitely got straight to the cliffhanger ending.

05:07.480 --> 05:08.480
It was a snappy one.

05:08.480 --> 05:09.480
It's a series.

05:11.480 --> 05:13.480
But yeah, it was very snappy.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.480
I did really like the main character.

05:15.480 --> 05:18.480
You know, with Cinderella stories, yes, we want to see her go to the ball.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.480
We want to see her be triumphant.

05:20.480 --> 05:24.480
This definitely took that and didn't want to do that.

05:24.480 --> 05:25.480
I mean, it hit the ball thing.

05:25.480 --> 05:29.480
It hit some of the things you consider vital to a Cinderella story.

05:29.480 --> 05:30.480
It hit the class thing.

05:30.480 --> 05:35.480
But those were just the background noise of what this book is actually about,

05:35.480 --> 05:36.480
which is...

05:36.480 --> 05:37.480
Revolution.

05:37.480 --> 05:38.480
Revolution.

05:38.480 --> 05:39.480
Imagine that.

05:39.480 --> 05:40.480
And, you know, a tyrant.

05:40.480 --> 05:41.480
Yeah.

05:41.480 --> 05:42.480
Invasion.

05:47.480 --> 05:51.480
The tyrant is basically a completely unironic version of Scarlet.

05:51.480 --> 05:52.480
I know.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.480
She has auburn hair and everything.

05:54.480 --> 05:55.480
I know.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.480
She's like walking all sexy.

05:57.480 --> 05:58.480
Like the evil queen.

05:58.480 --> 06:02.480
Well, it's funny because she shows up and everyone's like,

06:03.480 --> 06:05.480
Oh, the evil queen is here.

06:05.480 --> 06:06.480
I know.

06:06.480 --> 06:07.480
That's the thing.

06:07.480 --> 06:09.480
It's like not even at some point is someone like,

06:09.480 --> 06:10.480
Oh, she's not that bad.

06:10.480 --> 06:11.480
No, everyone's like,

06:11.480 --> 06:14.480
Well, the evil queen's in town.

06:14.480 --> 06:16.480
She sure is evil.

06:16.480 --> 06:19.480
She mind controlling, baby killing.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.480
Yep.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.480
Kills babies.

06:21.480 --> 06:22.480
Evil queen.

06:22.480 --> 06:23.480
Boy, she's evil.

06:23.480 --> 06:24.480
Doesn't like mirrors.

06:24.480 --> 06:25.480
Sure is hot.

06:25.480 --> 06:26.480
Oh, boy, she hot.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.480
That's the worst thing about the evil queen.

06:29.480 --> 06:33.480
She might look pretty, but the truth is she ugly.

06:33.480 --> 06:34.480
Oh, she ugly.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.480
She ugly.

06:35.480 --> 06:36.480
She ugly.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.480
That's the worst thing a woman can be.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.480
She shows up and she's all like,

06:44.480 --> 06:47.480
That's what she's hiding under the veil she always wears.

06:47.480 --> 06:48.480
Her mustache.

06:49.480 --> 06:51.480
That she's true.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.480
That's half the book read like,

06:56.480 --> 06:57.480
And everyone's like,

06:57.480 --> 06:58.480
God, she's evil.

06:58.480 --> 07:01.480
But talking about evil characters, there's another character.

07:01.480 --> 07:04.480
There's a doctor character who shows up and you think,

07:04.480 --> 07:05.480
Oh, now Cinder's going to get it.

07:05.480 --> 07:07.480
Like, this guy is no good.

07:07.480 --> 07:09.480
He seems to have an obsession with young girls.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.480
Literally.

07:11.480 --> 07:13.480
Literally a thing about young girls.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.480
And it's super creepy.

07:15.480 --> 07:18.480
Well, he's kind of set up like this Dr. Mingel,

07:18.480 --> 07:24.480
like doing literal, literal Auschwitz experiments on cyborgs.

07:24.480 --> 07:27.480
But no, then he turns out to be an ally.

07:27.480 --> 07:30.480
And we never go back to examine,

07:30.480 --> 07:34.480
so 27 cyborgs have died by your hand.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.480
He's a Dr. Fungal.

07:38.480 --> 07:41.480
It is just completely accepted in this universe

07:41.480 --> 07:44.480
that cyborgs are second class citizens.

07:44.480 --> 07:46.480
And it is never explained.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.480
They're just like, they're people.

07:48.480 --> 07:51.480
They're humans that have like, you know, artificial hearts

07:51.480 --> 07:53.480
or, you know, bionic arms or whatever.

07:53.480 --> 07:56.480
Or there's the one guy that gets listed as a cyborg

07:56.480 --> 07:57.480
who's just missing a foot.

07:57.480 --> 07:58.480
Yeah.

07:58.480 --> 08:01.480
He's got like a peg leg that happens to have like a little robot.

08:03.480 --> 08:05.480
I want to know what happened in this world

08:05.480 --> 08:07.480
to turn people so against prosthetics.

08:07.480 --> 08:08.480
Yeah.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.480
I mean, if you get a titanium hip replacement,

08:10.480 --> 08:12.480
does that make you count as a cyborg now?

08:12.480 --> 08:14.480
Yeah, this world is incredibly...

08:14.480 --> 08:16.480
Was there the cyborg wars?

08:16.480 --> 08:19.480
Yeah, was that World War IV that they mentioned?

08:19.480 --> 08:20.480
This world is incredibly ableist.

08:20.480 --> 08:22.480
I mean, is it like Star Trek where like,

08:22.480 --> 08:24.480
oh no, not eugenics, the eugenics war.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.480
But they never mention it.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.480
Okay, granted, this is book one of three,

08:28.480 --> 08:30.480
so maybe it gets mentioned.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.480
But as it is, it's never even alluded to

08:33.480 --> 08:36.480
why cyborgs are so shat upon.

08:36.480 --> 08:39.480
They're like, basically, literally slaves.

08:39.480 --> 08:43.480
Like, can be owned and sold for no reason

08:43.480 --> 08:45.480
other than they have prosthetic foot.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.480
Which of course is our Cinderella thing.

08:47.480 --> 08:49.480
Her foot comes off.

08:49.480 --> 08:50.480
Which I thought was clever.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.480
I feel like, it depends on what you like.

08:52.480 --> 08:55.480
It felt on the younger end of YA to me.

08:55.480 --> 08:57.480
Because it was A, really short.

08:57.480 --> 08:59.480
Compared to something like

08:59.480 --> 09:00.480
Daughter of Smoke and Bone series,

09:00.480 --> 09:02.480
or even Twilight, or The Fifth Wave.

09:02.480 --> 09:05.480
It was really short and super predictable.

09:05.480 --> 09:08.480
Like, the twist at the end is like,

09:08.480 --> 09:10.480
it was so obvious, it's like, it can't be that.

09:10.480 --> 09:11.480
It's gonna be a bait and switch.

09:11.480 --> 09:12.480
It has to be a bait and switch.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.480
No, I knew it was gonna be that.

09:13.480 --> 09:14.480
No, it wasn't.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.480
The characters are not super deep,

09:16.480 --> 09:19.480
but it was like, all concept.

09:19.480 --> 09:20.480
But the concept I thought worked.

09:20.480 --> 09:21.480
But it was fun.

09:21.480 --> 09:22.480
Yeah, it was fun.

09:22.480 --> 09:23.480
It was a fun concept.

09:23.480 --> 09:26.480
And I would definitely wanna read the next three books.

09:26.480 --> 09:27.480
Yeah, no, I'm on board.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.480
I'm like, I wanna see what happens to Cinder.

09:29.480 --> 09:30.480
Yeah.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.480
I wanna find out about the lunar...

09:32.480 --> 09:35.480
So there's a nation on the moon

09:35.480 --> 09:37.480
that's been there for hundreds of years

09:37.480 --> 09:39.480
and supposedly they're really wealthy

09:39.480 --> 09:41.480
and self-sustainable on the moon.

09:41.480 --> 09:44.480
I really wanna know how that happened.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.480
I hope they go into that.

09:46.480 --> 09:47.480
I do.

09:47.480 --> 09:48.480
Because I'm kinda like,

09:48.480 --> 09:50.480
Mars has the ice cap?

09:50.480 --> 09:51.480
Yeah.

09:52.480 --> 09:54.480
The moon's got a whole lot of nothing.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.480
So anyway, Marissa Meyer,

09:56.480 --> 09:57.480
someone in the comments pointed out

09:57.480 --> 10:00.480
that she was apparently a former fan fiction author.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.480
Which is apparently for like,

10:04.480 --> 10:06.480
Sailor Moon, which I think

10:06.480 --> 10:08.480
really makes a lot of sense

10:08.480 --> 10:10.480
considering the four books.

10:10.480 --> 10:12.480
It's like, Sailor Cinder.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.480
Sailor Scarlet.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.480
Sailor Winter.

10:17.480 --> 10:20.480
I mean, this isn't like Fifty Shades of Grey

10:20.480 --> 10:22.480
where it's just like, I'm taking my, you know...

10:22.480 --> 10:24.480
No, this is an example of someone

10:24.480 --> 10:27.480
who wrote fan fiction who did a good job with it.

10:27.480 --> 10:28.480
Well, I mean, I think it's like

10:28.480 --> 10:30.480
she took the things she liked about the fandom

10:30.480 --> 10:31.480
that she was in and reapplied it

10:31.480 --> 10:33.480
to a completely different thing.

10:33.480 --> 10:35.480
Which I can totally dig.

10:35.480 --> 10:37.480
I really, I can't express how little

10:37.480 --> 10:40.480
I cared about the romance and also didn't buy it.

10:40.480 --> 10:42.480
Well, also, I just really felt like

10:42.480 --> 10:44.480
they both just needed a puppy.

10:44.480 --> 10:45.480
There are so many larger things at stake

10:45.480 --> 10:46.480
and she keeps going,

10:46.480 --> 10:47.480
he's not gonna like me.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.480
And I get that that's the thing

10:49.480 --> 10:50.480
that teenagers will relate to,

10:50.480 --> 10:51.480
does he like me?

10:51.480 --> 10:52.480
Yeah.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.480
But in this case, I didn't buy it

10:54.480 --> 10:56.480
because the stakes were so high.

10:56.480 --> 10:58.480
It's like, get your shit together.

10:58.480 --> 10:59.480
Yeah.

10:59.480 --> 11:00.480
Come on, focus.

11:00.480 --> 11:01.480
I realize you're 16,

11:01.480 --> 11:03.480
but you're framed as smarter than that.

11:03.480 --> 11:04.480
Yeah.

11:04.480 --> 11:05.480
Someone in the comments asked

11:05.480 --> 11:07.480
if there is a Tiger's Curse comparison

11:07.480 --> 11:09.480
because this does take place in New Beijing,

11:09.480 --> 11:11.480
which is like a thousand-ish years

11:11.480 --> 11:13.480
in the future or something.

11:13.480 --> 11:14.480
No.

11:14.480 --> 11:15.480
No.

11:15.480 --> 11:16.480
No.

11:16.480 --> 11:18.480
Because Tiger's Curse at least tries

11:18.480 --> 11:21.480
to incorporate the culture.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.480
This one does not at all.

11:23.480 --> 11:24.480
Someone alluded to,

11:24.480 --> 11:25.480
someone's wearing a kimono

11:25.480 --> 11:27.480
or maybe there's a Buddha in the corner

11:27.480 --> 11:28.480
or something,

11:28.480 --> 11:30.480
but it really has fuck all to do with China.

11:30.480 --> 11:31.480
Yeah.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.480
And it's very much about a,

11:33.480 --> 11:36.480
all the continents have pretty much

11:36.480 --> 11:38.480
been divvied up into commonwealths.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.480
Europe is Europe.

11:40.480 --> 11:43.480
Africa is United Africa or something.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.480
South America has apparently been

11:46.480 --> 11:47.480
bombed into obliteration.

11:47.480 --> 11:48.480
Yeah.

11:48.480 --> 11:49.480
Because they're never,

11:49.480 --> 11:50.480
Australia is still its own thing.

11:50.480 --> 11:51.480
Hey, well.

11:51.480 --> 11:53.480
But it was a part of an interesting point.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.480
I wanted to bring this one up.

11:54.480 --> 11:57.480
This is called The Summer Prince,

11:57.480 --> 12:02.480
which is a considerably less well-known YA book.

12:02.480 --> 12:06.480
This one is on the much, much more adult,

12:06.480 --> 12:08.480
like older YA.

12:08.480 --> 12:09.480
It's a lot more heady.

12:09.480 --> 12:10.480
It's a lot more conceptual.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.480
It's a lot more sci-fi.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.480
This one takes place in a science fiction future Brazil.

12:14.480 --> 12:16.480
But I wanted to bring this one up

12:16.480 --> 12:20.480
because it definitely brings in the culture

12:20.480 --> 12:24.480
and applies it to this potential future.

12:24.480 --> 12:28.480
It is very grounded in the culture of Brazil.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.480
And honestly, I feel like,

12:30.480 --> 12:31.480
this is YA technically,

12:31.480 --> 12:34.480
but I feel like it would appeal more to adults

12:34.480 --> 12:37.480
than teenagers because it is not very,

12:37.480 --> 12:38.480
does he like me?

12:38.480 --> 12:40.480
It's very the opposite of that.

12:40.480 --> 12:41.480
Well, at least Cinder.

12:41.480 --> 12:43.480
I mean, because it's implied like,

12:43.480 --> 12:44.480
she's from Europe.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.480
Yeah, Cinder's kind of implied white.

12:46.480 --> 12:47.480
Yeah.

12:47.480 --> 12:48.480
It's kind of a shame.

12:48.480 --> 12:49.480
Yeah.

12:49.480 --> 12:51.480
She never explicitly said white,

12:51.480 --> 12:52.480
but she's like,

12:52.480 --> 12:53.480
are you from Europe?

12:53.480 --> 12:54.480
Like, who?

12:54.480 --> 12:55.480
All right, so that's Cinder.

12:55.480 --> 12:58.480
Great if you like concept and fast, snappy reads.

12:58.480 --> 12:59.480
Yeah.

12:59.480 --> 13:01.480
And just, you know, a fun and easy thing.

13:01.480 --> 13:02.480
I mean, we're coming into summer,

13:02.480 --> 13:04.480
so definitely I'd say it's a beach book.

13:04.480 --> 13:05.480
Yeah, this is a beach book.

13:05.480 --> 13:06.480
Definitely.

13:06.480 --> 13:07.480
Kill it two, three hours.

13:07.480 --> 13:08.480
Two weeks from now, this one,

13:08.480 --> 13:10.480
made into a movie by Tim Burton.

13:10.480 --> 13:11.480
Really?

13:11.480 --> 13:13.480
I don't know how I feel about that.

13:13.480 --> 13:14.480
Well, I won't know how I feel about that

13:14.480 --> 13:15.480
until I read it.

13:15.480 --> 13:17.480
Well, I guess I have to drink this, don't I?

13:17.480 --> 13:18.480
Yep.

13:18.480 --> 13:19.480
Look, well,

13:19.480 --> 13:21.480
you can take a, like, shot.

13:23.480 --> 13:25.480
I'm just gonna smell.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.480
I do not like sriracha.

13:27.480 --> 13:28.480
You don't like sriracha?

13:28.480 --> 13:30.480
I must be the only asshole in this entire

13:30.480 --> 13:32.480
fucking city that doesn't like sriracha.

13:32.480 --> 13:33.480
Sriracha's, like,

13:34.480 --> 13:35.480
life.

13:36.480 --> 13:37.480
Fire and blood.

13:38.480 --> 13:39.480
Yep, that's, um,

13:42.480 --> 13:43.480
it's a cocktail.

13:44.480 --> 13:46.480
It's good.

13:46.480 --> 13:47.480
Honest.

13:47.480 --> 13:48.480
I just, I don't like spicy.

13:48.480 --> 13:50.480
Mmm-mmm!

13:50.480 --> 13:51.480
Lindsay.

13:51.480 --> 13:54.480
Well, Nella doesn't get to do her rose thing next week,

13:54.480 --> 13:55.480
so, give us something.

13:55.480 --> 13:56.480
You mixologists in there,

13:56.480 --> 13:57.480
and then we'll do it next,

13:57.480 --> 13:58.480
in two weeks from now.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.480
Even if it has something peculiar about it.

14:00.480 --> 14:01.480
Something, something peculiar.

14:01.480 --> 14:02.480
Give us something peculiar.

14:02.480 --> 14:03.480
We'll tie it into this.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.480
Oh right, Goodreads.

14:05.480 --> 14:06.480
Be our friend on Goodreads.

14:06.480 --> 14:07.480
Yeah.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.480
Shayapocalypse?

14:08.480 --> 14:09.480
Uh, yeah.

14:09.480 --> 14:10.480
Goodreads.com slash shayapocalypse.

14:11.480 --> 14:12.480
Be our friend.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.480
You can comment.

14:13.480 --> 14:14.480
We can talk.

14:14.480 --> 14:15.480
I log in sometimes,

14:15.480 --> 14:16.480
and it logs me out of my Facebook.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.480
Pain in the ass.

14:17.480 --> 14:18.480
It is.

14:18.480 --> 14:19.480
It totally is.

14:19.480 --> 14:20.480
While we will read this in two weeks,

14:20.480 --> 14:21.480
we will be back next week

14:21.480 --> 14:26.480
to talk explicitly about another slash Arisen.

14:26.480 --> 14:27.480
Because we really need to start writing that.

14:27.480 --> 14:28.480
Yeah.

14:28.480 --> 14:29.480
Here, you can have this one.

14:29.480 --> 14:30.480
Oh.

14:37.480 --> 14:38.480
Bye.

14:38.480 --> 14:39.480
Bye.

14:39.480 --> 14:40.480
Bye.
