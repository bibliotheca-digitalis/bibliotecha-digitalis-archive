1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Aren't you happy Game of Thrones is back?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yay!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,320
I thought us up a George RR Martini.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,000
It involves fire and- No.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Fire.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
No.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,400
According to my Game of Thrones house things, I should be Tyrell.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,880
This is- Oh god, I can smell it from here.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:39,880
This is sriracha, because all my house quizzes tell me I'm a Targaryen, so cheers!

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,880
Just wait until I make a, you know, fire gun.

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,880
Oh, I will hate that.

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,880
You know how I hate tasty things.

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,160
So before we talk about Cinder, let's talk about some of the ideas people threw at us

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,480
regarding Arisen, and the dystopia discussion that we had last week.

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,880
While we were kind of poo-pooing dystopia as an idea for the sequel, Emily Hopkins suggested

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,720
that it would be like New Moon meets dystopia, Riley leaves her and it's like the end of

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,080
the world, and then it is literally the end of the world, but she's too depressed to even

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,480
care or notice.

19
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,640
Hey, that would definitely- And then like, you know, because our idea was instead of

20
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,880
like in New Moon where it's like November, it was just going to be ellipses for like

21
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,480
45 minutes, and then at the end of it there's like a totalitarian government.

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,480
We were fitted for our uniforms today, but I don't care.

23
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:42,480
Guest said, remember when a matriarchal society in a sci-fi post-apocalyptic setting was written

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,480
as if it was mind-blowing and terrifying?

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,480
Would Sarah Ellenson accidentally write something like that?

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,480
I think she would.

27
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,480
I think she would, yeah.

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,480
In fact, I think that's how we bring Scarlett back into this.

29
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,480
Yeah, she's like the leader of the matriarchy.

30
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,480
And all the women are scorned.

31
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
Everyone's scorned.

32
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,480
It's like they scorned us so we will destroy them.

33
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,480
So they just have their meetings.

34
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,480
They never talk about their scorn, and they were like, we will have revenge.

35
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,480
Oh, one of my favorite was- I didn't write this one down.

36
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,480
Whoever said this.

37
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,480
I think we finally had a winner in the race to complete Arisen.

38
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,480
Oh yeah.

39
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,480
And that was simply another.

40
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,480
We need it.

41
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,480
I like this title, another.

42
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,480
I was like, another.

43
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,480
So I feel like, you know, we want to take it in a funnier direction and more, yeah.

44
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,480
And so I think, rather than Arisen, which I think a YA book would actually be called,

45
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
I like another.

46
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
Yeah.

47
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,480
Lauren Kate suggests that book two, there tends to be a big undercurrent in YA these

48
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,480
days, to borrow the idea from the Lego movie of this special.

49
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,480
I think we could play that up.

50
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,480
Although that was definitely there in the first one.

51
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,480
I haven't seen the Lego movie yet.

52
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,480
Don't talk to me.

53
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,480
Lauren Kate's also said that, you know, even the worst of YA dystopias are at least, you

54
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,480
know, a little bit of a metaphor, which, you know, Divergent isn't really.

55
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,480
And they might be paper thin and obvious, but, you know, it's there.

56
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,480
And Sarah doesn't exactly get layers.

57
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,480
So if you're going to do dystopia, whatever would normally be presented as a metaphor

58
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,480
needs to be, like, 100% on the nose.

59
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,480
I wonder what that could be, though.

60
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,480
So they take their guns away or something.

61
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,480
No, like there's a health care system called Shmo-shmama-shmare.

62
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,480
And they're like, no, but I want to visit my doctor.

63
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,480
They raise the minimum wage.

64
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,480
No!

65
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,480
No!

66
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,480
And the moochers, like, crawl out.

67
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,480
They're like the Morlocks.

68
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
Review in time.

69
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,480
We decided next week we're going to go with Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

70
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,480
based on popularity of suggestion.

71
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,480
Before we start talking about Cinder, so we're going to do this one in two weeks.

72
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,480
So we have two weeks to read it.

73
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,480
Another library copy.

74
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,480
Thank you, Queens Library.

75
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,480
You are awesome.

76
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,480
We picked this one because we presumed it wasn't focused on romance.

77
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
We could be wrong.

78
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
Yeah.

79
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,480
For the next one, I say give us something adult, reasonably popular,

80
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,480
within the last five years, little or no romance.

81
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,480
So we can focus less on romance, even though that is relevant to our Cthulhu love.

82
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,480
We still have to read that Ypres love.

83
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,480
Yeah, at some point we've got to read Ypres love.

84
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,480
Or just keep pushing up.

85
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,480
Yeah, it was like next year.

86
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:46,480
Cinder, speaking of romance, the Cyborg Cinderella retelling for our modern age by Marissa Meyer.

87
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,480
We read that, and it did indeed have a cyborg foot.

88
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,480
Yes.

89
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,480
Nella, what did you think of Cinder?

90
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:59,480
Reading Cinder, I was struck by how well the plot moved along.

91
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:06,480
It definitely kept up its pace and definitely got straight to the cliffhanger ending.

92
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
It was a snappy one.

93
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,480
It's a series.

94
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,480
But yeah, it was very snappy.

95
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,480
I did really like the main character.

96
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,480
You know, with Cinderella stories, yes, we want to see her go to the ball.

97
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,480
We want to see her be triumphant.

98
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,480
This definitely took that and didn't want to do that.

99
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,480
I mean, it hit the ball thing.

100
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,480
It hit some of the things you consider vital to a Cinderella story.

101
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
It hit the class thing.

102
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,480
But those were just the background noise of what this book is actually about,

103
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,480
which is...

104
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Revolution.

105
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
Revolution.

106
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
Imagine that.

107
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,480
And, you know, a tyrant.

108
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
Yeah.

109
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,480
Invasion.

110
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,480
The tyrant is basically a completely unironic version of Scarlet.

111
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
I know.

112
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,480
She has auburn hair and everything.

113
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,480
I know.

114
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,480
She's like walking all sexy.

115
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,480
Like the evil queen.

116
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,480
Well, it's funny because she shows up and everyone's like,

117
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
Oh, the evil queen is here.

118
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,480
I know.

119
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,480
That's the thing.

120
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,480
It's like not even at some point is someone like,

121
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,480
Oh, she's not that bad.

122
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,480
No, everyone's like,

123
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,480
Well, the evil queen's in town.

124
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,480
She sure is evil.

125
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,480
She mind controlling, baby killing.

126
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Yep.

127
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
Kills babies.

128
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,480
Evil queen.

129
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,480
Boy, she's evil.

130
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
Doesn't like mirrors.

131
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Sure is hot.

132
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
Oh, boy, she hot.

133
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,480
That's the worst thing about the evil queen.

134
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,480
She might look pretty, but the truth is she ugly.

135
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,480
Oh, she ugly.

136
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,480
She ugly.

137
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
She ugly.

138
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
That's the worst thing a woman can be.

139
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,480
She shows up and she's all like,

140
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,480
That's what she's hiding under the veil she always wears.

141
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,480
Her mustache.

142
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,480
That she's true.

143
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,480
That's half the book read like,

144
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
And everyone's like,

145
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
God, she's evil.

146
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,480
But talking about evil characters, there's another character.

147
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,480
There's a doctor character who shows up and you think,

148
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
Oh, now Cinder's going to get it.

149
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Like, this guy is no good.

150
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,480
He seems to have an obsession with young girls.

151
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
Literally.

152
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,480
Literally a thing about young girls.

153
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,480
And it's super creepy.

154
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,480
Well, he's kind of set up like this Dr. Mingel,

155
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:24,480
like doing literal, literal Auschwitz experiments on cyborgs.

156
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,480
But no, then he turns out to be an ally.

157
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,480
And we never go back to examine,

158
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,480
so 27 cyborgs have died by your hand.

159
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,480
He's a Dr. Fungal.

160
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,480
It is just completely accepted in this universe

161
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,480
that cyborgs are second class citizens.

162
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,480
And it is never explained.

163
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
They're just like, they're people.

164
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,480
They're humans that have like, you know, artificial hearts

165
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,480
or, you know, bionic arms or whatever.

166
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,480
Or there's the one guy that gets listed as a cyborg

167
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,480
who's just missing a foot.

168
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,480
Yeah.

169
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,480
He's got like a peg leg that happens to have like a little robot.

170
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,480
I want to know what happened in this world

171
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,480
to turn people so against prosthetics.

172
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
Yeah.

173
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,480
I mean, if you get a titanium hip replacement,

174
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,480
does that make you count as a cyborg now?

175
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Yeah, this world is incredibly...

176
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,480
Was there the cyborg wars?

177
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,480
Yeah, was that World War IV that they mentioned?

178
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
This world is incredibly ableist.

179
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,480
I mean, is it like Star Trek where like,

180
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,480
oh no, not eugenics, the eugenics war.

181
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,480
But they never mention it.

182
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,480
Okay, granted, this is book one of three,

183
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,480
so maybe it gets mentioned.

184
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,480
But as it is, it's never even alluded to

185
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,480
why cyborgs are so shat upon.

186
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,480
They're like, basically, literally slaves.

187
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,480
Like, can be owned and sold for no reason

188
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,480
other than they have prosthetic foot.

189
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,480
Which of course is our Cinderella thing.

190
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,480
Her foot comes off.

191
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,480
Which I thought was clever.

192
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,480
I feel like, it depends on what you like.

193
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,480
It felt on the younger end of YA to me.

194
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,480
Because it was A, really short.

195
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,480
Compared to something like

196
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,480
Daughter of Smoke and Bone series,

197
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
or even Twilight, or The Fifth Wave.

198
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,480
It was really short and super predictable.

199
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,480
Like, the twist at the end is like,

200
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
it was so obvious, it's like, it can't be that.

201
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,480
It's gonna be a bait and switch.

202
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,480
It has to be a bait and switch.

203
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
No, I knew it was gonna be that.

204
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,480
No, it wasn't.

205
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
The characters are not super deep,

206
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,480
but it was like, all concept.

207
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
But the concept I thought worked.

208
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
But it was fun.

209
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,480
Yeah, it was fun.

210
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
It was a fun concept.

211
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,480
And I would definitely wanna read the next three books.

212
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Yeah, no, I'm on board.

213
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,480
I'm like, I wanna see what happens to Cinder.

214
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
Yeah.

215
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,480
I wanna find out about the lunar...

216
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,480
So there's a nation on the moon

217
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,480
that's been there for hundreds of years

218
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,480
and supposedly they're really wealthy

219
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,480
and self-sustainable on the moon.

220
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,480
I really wanna know how that happened.

221
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,480
I hope they go into that.

222
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,480
I do.

223
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
Because I'm kinda like,

224
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
Mars has the ice cap?

225
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Yeah.

226
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,480
The moon's got a whole lot of nothing.

227
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,480
So anyway, Marissa Meyer,

228
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
someone in the comments pointed out

229
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,480
that she was apparently a former fan fiction author.

230
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
Which is apparently for like,

231
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,480
Sailor Moon, which I think

232
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
really makes a lot of sense

233
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,480
considering the four books.

234
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,480
It's like, Sailor Cinder.

235
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
Sailor Scarlet.

236
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,480
Sailor Winter.

237
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,480
I mean, this isn't like Fifty Shades of Grey

238
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
where it's just like, I'm taking my, you know...

239
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,480
No, this is an example of someone

240
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,480
who wrote fan fiction who did a good job with it.

241
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,480
Well, I mean, I think it's like

242
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,480
she took the things she liked about the fandom

243
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,480
that she was in and reapplied it

244
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,480
to a completely different thing.

245
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,480
Which I can totally dig.

246
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,480
I really, I can't express how little

247
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,480
I cared about the romance and also didn't buy it.

248
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,480
Well, also, I just really felt like

249
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,480
they both just needed a puppy.

250
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
There are so many larger things at stake

251
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,480
and she keeps going,

252
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,480
he's not gonna like me.

253
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,480
And I get that that's the thing

254
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,480
that teenagers will relate to,

255
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
does he like me?

256
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,480
Yeah.

257
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,480
But in this case, I didn't buy it

258
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,480
because the stakes were so high.

259
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,480
It's like, get your shit together.

260
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
Yeah.

261
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
Come on, focus.

262
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,480
I realize you're 16,

263
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,480
but you're framed as smarter than that.

264
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,480
Yeah.

265
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,480
Someone in the comments asked

266
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,480
if there is a Tiger's Curse comparison

267
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,480
because this does take place in New Beijing,

268
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,480
which is like a thousand-ish years

269
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,480
in the future or something.

270
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,480
No.

271
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
No.

272
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
No.

273
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,480
Because Tiger's Curse at least tries

274
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,480
to incorporate the culture.

275
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,480
This one does not at all.

276
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,480
Someone alluded to,

277
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
someone's wearing a kimono

278
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,480
or maybe there's a Buddha in the corner

279
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,480
or something,

280
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,480
but it really has fuck all to do with China.

281
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,480
Yeah.

282
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,480
And it's very much about a,

283
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,480
all the continents have pretty much

284
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
been divvied up into commonwealths.

285
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
Europe is Europe.

286
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,480
Africa is United Africa or something.

287
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
South America has apparently been

288
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
bombed into obliteration.

289
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
Yeah.

290
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
Because they're never,

291
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
Australia is still its own thing.

292
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,480
Hey, well.

293
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,480
But it was a part of an interesting point.

294
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,480
I wanted to bring this one up.

295
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,480
This is called The Summer Prince,

296
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,480
which is a considerably less well-known YA book.

297
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,480
This one is on the much, much more adult,

298
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,480
like older YA.

299
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480
It's a lot more heady.

300
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,480
It's a lot more conceptual.

301
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
It's a lot more sci-fi.

302
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,480
This one takes place in a science fiction future Brazil.

303
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,480
But I wanted to bring this one up

304
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,480
because it definitely brings in the culture

305
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,480
and applies it to this potential future.

306
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,480
It is very grounded in the culture of Brazil.

307
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
And honestly, I feel like,

308
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
this is YA technically,

309
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,480
but I feel like it would appeal more to adults

310
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,480
than teenagers because it is not very,

311
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,480
does he like me?

312
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,480
It's very the opposite of that.

313
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
Well, at least Cinder.

314
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,480
I mean, because it's implied like,

315
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,480
she's from Europe.

316
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,480
Yeah, Cinder's kind of implied white.

317
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,480
Yeah.

318
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,480
It's kind of a shame.

319
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,480
Yeah.

320
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,480
She never explicitly said white,

321
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,480
but she's like,

322
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,480
are you from Europe?

323
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,480
Like, who?

324
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,480
All right, so that's Cinder.

325
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,480
Great if you like concept and fast, snappy reads.

326
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,480
Yeah.

327
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,480
And just, you know, a fun and easy thing.

328
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,480
I mean, we're coming into summer,

329
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,480
so definitely I'd say it's a beach book.

330
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,480
Yeah, this is a beach book.

331
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,480
Definitely.

332
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,480
Kill it two, three hours.

333
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
Two weeks from now, this one,

334
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
made into a movie by Tim Burton.

335
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,480
Really?

336
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,480
I don't know how I feel about that.

337
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
Well, I won't know how I feel about that

338
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,480
until I read it.

339
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,480
Well, I guess I have to drink this, don't I?

340
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,480
Yep.

341
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,480
Look, well,

342
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,480
you can take a, like, shot.

343
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,480
I'm just gonna smell.

344
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,480
I do not like sriracha.

345
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
You don't like sriracha?

346
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
I must be the only asshole in this entire

347
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,480
fucking city that doesn't like sriracha.

348
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,480
Sriracha's, like,

349
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,480
life.

350
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,480
Fire and blood.

351
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
Yep, that's, um,

352
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,480
it's a cocktail.

353
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
It's good.

354
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,480
Honest.

355
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,480
I just, I don't like spicy.

356
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,480
Mmm-mmm!

357
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,480
Lindsay.

358
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,480
Well, Nella doesn't get to do her rose thing next week,

359
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,480
so, give us something.

360
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
You mixologists in there,

361
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,480
and then we'll do it next,

362
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
in two weeks from now.

363
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,480
Even if it has something peculiar about it.

364
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,480
Something, something peculiar.

365
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
Give us something peculiar.

366
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
We'll tie it into this.

367
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,480
Oh right, Goodreads.

368
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,480
Be our friend on Goodreads.

369
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
Yeah.

370
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,480
Shayapocalypse?

371
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,480
Uh, yeah.

372
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Goodreads.com slash shayapocalypse.

373
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,480
Be our friend.

374
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,480
You can comment.

375
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
We can talk.

376
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,480
I log in sometimes,

377
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,480
and it logs me out of my Facebook.

378
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,480
Pain in the ass.

379
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,480
It is.

380
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,480
It totally is.

381
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,480
While we will read this in two weeks,

382
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
we will be back next week

383
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,480
to talk explicitly about another slash Arisen.

384
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,480
Because we really need to start writing that.

385
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,480
Yeah.

386
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,480
Here, you can have this one.

387
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,480
Oh.

388
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,480
Bye.

389
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,480
Bye.

390
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,480
Bye.
