0	6240	break out the parade floats and whatever it is we do to celebrate now because my book,
6240	12080	my first book has been out for more than a year and the paperback has just come out. So for all
12080	19200	of you people who said, I'm going to wait for the paperback, your time has come. Cheers.
21120	27360	This was gifted to me six years ago, seven years ago by the very person who deletes all your
27360	32640	comments. This video has been brought to you by the official drink of the last 18 months.
34080	39600	Get it? Cause it's beer. Okay. So what are the most common things you get as an author is less
39600	47120	about your own work so much as the process and how this can be applied to aspiring writers.
47120	54240	Now that said, I don't know how helpful this will be because I definitely came in, uh,
54240	59440	deliberately. So with a large platform, because that's kind of, I don't want to say how it's done
59440	65440	now, but it definitely doesn't hurt. The title of this video is also a little bit of false
65440	71040	advertising. It would probably be more honest to say some things I wish I knew before I published
71040	78560	my first book. And also some things I kind of suspected, but hoped weren't true, but totally
78560	84800	were. I do kind of wish I could make these more like optimistic and inspirational than they are,
84800	88560	because I feel like every time I do a writing video, like half the comments are like, wow,
89760	93920	I give up. And I'm like, I don't know what to tell you, man. It's hard. I don't want to blow
93920	98640	smoke up your ass. When my mother yells at this, it's because she loves me. I was rooting for you.
98640	102320	We were all rooting for you. Yeah. It's harder than you think it is. If you think it's going
102320	106320	to be hard, it's, it's harder than that. So I'm going to make a promise to myself that I'm not
106320	111520	going to try to be a total downer. Keyword try. Okay. Number one, getting published is harder now
111520	118160	than it ever has been. I mean, it is what it is. So I think the paradox of self publishing,
118160	125040	becoming free and creating more access is that it also created more demand because a lot of people
125040	132320	who read a lot of books, they tend to read like mystery and romance and erotica. And those genres
132320	136960	do really well in self publishing and people who read those genres tend to read a lot. And then,
136960	141120	and then a lot of these people who spend a lot of time in like self published stuff do tend
141120	146800	sometimes to wade into traditionally published fiction. So why is it harder now than it's ever
146800	152960	been? Well, believe it or not, demand is actually higher now, less because of the print side, so
152960	158400	much as the audio book side, which is the fastest growing part of the publishing industry right now.
158400	164960	And believe it or not, it is not a conflict of interest for me to use Audible as a sponsor.
166080	171120	I was surprised about that too. So if there's more demand and self publishing is kind of siphoning
171120	178480	off people that maybe don't belong in traditional publishing, why is it harder now? Well, I can
178480	184160	only kind of speculate, but I kind of suspect it's harder now for the same reason, uh, getting a movie
184160	189440	made, uh, at least a, you know, traditional Hollywood movie is harder now. Basically more
189440	196080	and more resources go to fewer and fewer projects. I have seen a lot of people say that the mid list
196080	201680	is dying. I'm considered a mid list author. Basically publishers will kind of go all in on
201680	207360	a few titles per year, usually by authors you've heard of, but sometimes by debuts, especially in,
207360	214000	uh, genre fiction, NYA fiction, and that kind of leaves fewer slots available. I think there's
214000	220960	also just more supply. A lot more people are trying to get published and really the hardest
220960	227360	steps, the getting the agent and then actually getting published. Um, those two steps are again,
227360	232400	higher than they've ever been because there are fewer slots available and more and more people
232400	237920	trying to get in. Number two, getting published does not mean you've made it. I mean, it means
237920	242800	you've been published, but like that doesn't guarantee you a career. And I feel like a lot
242800	247920	of people have this misconception that like, if you get a book published once you're in the club
247920	254960	and you're going to be fine. And it's not true. Uh, being an author is a constant, constant
254960	263040	struggle. And I know very few authors where that's their only job. And the ones I do know are like,
263040	268720	you know, John Scalzi, literal millionaires who published like 500 books. What does happen is
268720	272880	you might get published, you might have a lot of friends and contacts in the industry,
272880	279600	but then for whatever reason, um, maybe tastes change. The genre you write in isn't like hot
279600	285360	anymore. Uh, just because you sold a book before to a major publisher doesn't mean you'll have an
285360	295440	easy time from here on out. So no head. Number three, if you want something done, you've got to
295440	302000	do it yourself because your publisher won't do it for you. What I mean by this is if you need
302000	309040	research, if you need a lot of editorial assistance, if you need inspiration, they're
309040	314960	not going to do it for you. This really does depend on the editor. I've known of editors who,
314960	321440	um, are very hands-on and arguably take on more than they can handle both like emotionally and
321440	326400	in terms of workload. And they spend a lot of time with their authors, just like brainstorming
326400	334880	and workshopping. That was not my experience at all. I get like two emails a year with like,
334880	339120	you know, a list of six things to change. And then otherwise like, let me know when you're
339120	343520	further along. And then that's it. My editor is just very hands-off. At first, I was kind
343520	348960	of surprised by that because I guess I did expect to be like handheld, you know, because it's like,
348960	355600	I'm a debut. I don't know what I'm doing. And they're like, you know, turns out they don't
355600	360800	really treat debuts any different than anybody else. And so the journey of my second book was
360800	366800	very different from the first one, because I sought a lot more outside help. I hired outside
366800	371200	editors. I hired sensitivity readers. And I don't want to say like, that's a big regret I have with
371200	378000	the first book, because I guess that was sort of a lesson you kind of have to learn. Um, but I feel
378000	384240	like it really shows, like from book one to book two, like just sort of like the flow of the story
384240	390960	and the quality of the prose. I think it shows that I had a lot more input for book two than I
390960	396960	did book one. Which brings us to number four. It's really not a solo effort. I used to wonder why are
396960	402320	acknowledgments so long at the back of books? Because you need help. And I know that's not
402320	407360	like, I guess there's like, you know, those unicorns out there that like just push out a draft
407360	411840	and then it's done, and then they don't really need much help. But also, I don't think they're
411840	415600	trying to write the great American novel. You know, they're just trying to have a career,
415600	420960	like book, moving on, next book, moving on. And yeah, but it's just like, it is it's okay to ask
420960	425120	for help, even though like, you're going to get shot down, especially if you're like researching
425120	431040	and, you know, you need to like reach out to someone who's an expert in something, which I
431040	436160	didn't do very much in the first book, like hardly at all. But I did a lot in the second book,
436160	439680	because, you know, especially like for science fiction, it's kind of embarrassing be like,
440240	450080	yeah, hi, lawyer friend. Mind if I use your degree that you spent many years acquiring,
450800	456480	walking through the thought experiment of what giving, I don't know what the legal question of
456480	461040	aliens in America might look like. I don't know, just, just throwing it out there. Beta readers
461680	469440	I had one of my closest friends slash, you know, namesake for the character was my sort of cultural
469440	474400	attache for the second protagonist in the second book. And at first I was like, it doesn't matter.
474400	480960	But honestly, like, I cannot imagine what it would have been like now writing this character without,
480960	486160	you know, knowing someone really well and being comfortable enough with them to like message them
486160	492720	at all hours of the night like, hey, do Persians take their shoes off in the house? The answer is
492720	499200	yes. Turns out it's weird that, you know, Anglo Americans don't like most, most of the world looks
499200	505440	down on us for that. But by that same token, beware of too many cooks. I have definitely seen
505440	511360	people with books that especially like if they're kind of early on in their career, you can kind of
511360	516960	see where there's a lot of hands on it. So it's kind of a balance. And the only person who can
516960	523840	figure it out is you. Number five, this industry is full of jealous bitches. It's like a disease.
523840	531120	And I do not consider myself exempt from this. Coming from YouTube, I don't see a lot of gel.
531120	535440	Okay, I do see a lot of jealousy, but not like with people I'm friends with. There are definitely
535440	541520	some some jealous haters out there. But like the people I've known and worked with for a lot of
541520	549280	years, it's rare that you see like, oh, so and so has overtaken me in subs. That means I suck. Or,
549280	553600	wow, I wish I could have done that. Like, I definitely see that. And it always kind of pings
553600	559600	my like, you know, tiny red flags when people kind of go into, you know, a semi collaborative
559600	565280	medium with that mindset. But for the most part, I feel like at least in my little enclave of YouTube,
565440	572800	people are pretty good at not seeing other people's successes as reflective of their own
572800	578080	failure or lack of success. That is not always true. I have definitely known people who were
578080	585200	just pathologically incapable of being happy for other people in the YouTube community.
585200	590640	Why can't you just be happy for me and then go home and talk behind my back later like a normal
590640	595680	person? Every success someone else had was a reflection of their failure. But for the most
595680	604320	part, you don't see that a lot on YouTube. But in publishing, I don't. It's completely different.
604320	611600	Everybody is jealous all the time. And everyone is trying so hard to pretend like that is not the
611600	616960	case. I think it's because most people know it's kind of wrong to be, I'm sorry, envious.
617680	623280	Whereas envy is offensive. It's resentment over what someone else has that you lack.
623280	630080	Like everyone kind of knows that what does and does not take off or who does and doesn't get
630080	637760	published or who does and does not get X numbers. It isn't really a meritocracy. I would say that's
637760	643200	way more true in publishing than in YouTube. Because again, like bestsellers do tend to
643280	648640	have a lot of marketing money behind them. Or an influencer with a YouTube channel.
648640	653200	And again, this doesn't apply to everybody. I definitely know some authors that like,
653200	661120	either are just so, let's say confident that they don't experience envy, or they hide it really,
661120	666880	really well. Someone can be like a huge bestseller and still struggle with like, oh, you have the
666880	673600	respect of your X peers, or you have X fan base, or you have more fan art, or someone with very
673600	680320	little sales, but a lot of networking connections. People who are more on the commercial side of
680320	687520	things can be like, why don't I get awards nominated? Or why don't I get a lot of attention
687520	692160	on Twitter from people within the industry? It's like no matter how successful you are,
692160	696800	or well keyed in you are, everyone is jealous of everyone else. And I, you know, I am no
696800	702400	exception. Like I'll see someone like that I know, and I really enjoy and I really support,
702400	708160	like right out the gate, they get a review in the New York Times. And I'm like, so happy for you.
709280	715760	I'm really happy. And I don't know why this is more in publishing than YouTube. I think part of
715760	721200	it is, you know, because those really obvious metrics, like getting a solid recommendation
721200	730560	from a peer, or a review in a major outlet, are like really obvious signifiers of success,
730560	736160	as opposed to like on YouTube, where it's just a numbers game. But also like on YouTube, it's just
736160	742400	it like it's a numbers game in many ways. Like, yeah, you might pull in X many views, and everybody
742400	746080	can see it. But also just like, okay, I put out a video on to the next one on to the next one,
746080	751600	you're never going to work on a YouTube video as hard as you would on a novel. I take that back.
751600	756880	I know some people who absolutely have worked on YouTube videos as hard as they have, or would
756880	761840	have on a novel. And I think and I think the key here is to know this about themselves. And most
761840	767200	people do. And, you know, push through it. Because I think the only way to, you know, healthfully
767200	773440	live with envy is to know that's what's going on in your head. And just get over it. Because there
773520	780640	is absolutely no harm in being happy for other people. Number six, you need more practice than
780640	784640	you think you do. I mean, that's just basically what it says on the header. I don't know if I
784640	790320	need to clarify that. I see way too many people, you know, myself, you know, six years ago included
790320	795200	that, you know, no, they're not gonna knock it out of the park on the first try, but kind of
795760	802720	hope they will. And I don't really understand where this impulse or expectation from others
802720	808240	comes from. In my case, I did see a bunch of people coming in with this expectation that
808240	815600	because they respect my work so much on YouTube, I was going to automatically be perfect as a
815600	824400	novelist. And I'm like, I have been doing this for 13 years, I have had a long time to kind of
824960	833120	refine like my timing and my voice and like the way I construct arguments and narratives
833120	838480	and editing. And also it's nonfiction. It's completely different. Oh, I kind of, you know,
838480	845840	I expected better from you. And it's like, whenever I see people who, you know, just become
845840	851840	so obsessed with this idea that their first novel has to be perfect. I get it because people are
851840	859520	like, weirdly judgmental in their expectations of like, what a debut novel looks like. Like,
859520	864640	you don't expect someone's first YouTube video to like be on the level with their 20th. Why would
864640	869040	you feel the same about a book? And yet people think that way. And I think it's really inhibits
869040	874320	people. You know, in hindsight, I wish I had given myself more slack to not be perfect. But I think
874320	881520	in general, like, I think more people need to stop trying to be perfect and just accept it's
881600	885520	your first try. I mean, no book is going to ever be perfect, but your first one,
886240	893200	it's still your first one. Cut yourself some slack. Number seven, review bombing. I hoped I
893200	899760	was being paranoid. I hoped people wouldn't actually do this. But you know, jealous haters,
899760	904640	they absolutely did. So when I say review bombing, I don't mean negative reviews. I mean, like,
904640	912800	basically, like, pettily one-starring a book because they hate me personally. And I really
912800	921600	only started to notice this after someone released a video stating that the only reason I had ever
921600	929920	made content criticizing JK Rowling was to promote my own book. And then a bunch of his goblins,
929920	937120	sorry, fans, then went on to places like Goodreads to, you know, mass one-star the book.
937120	940960	And I don't want to make it sound like it was like hundreds of people. It's hundreds of them
940960	947040	here on YouTube, maybe like a few dozen on like over Goodreads and Amazon. The rationale being
947040	959840	that I don't disagree with JK Rowling because of a specific and I would say, very highly articulated
959840	967600	disagreement I have with her political views, which she has many times unambiguously made clear
967600	978960	in public. But because I'm clout chasing, I'm riding the wave of JKR hate to promote my own work.
980240	985600	Which tells you an awful lot about how Carl thinks. So yeah, the point of review bombing is
985920	992800	definitely to bring down the property value of your brand, but mostly it's just to hurt you.
993360	999120	It's just to be cruel, be catty. And I don't want to make it sound like it was just Carl
999120	1006560	and his followers. There was definitely some review bombing after the incident in March,
1006560	1013600	where for a month it was popular on lefty Twitter to, you know, go after me. Weird how they got
1013600	1018720	over that. It's weird. It's weird how I don't get like threatening messages from those people
1018720	1026480	anymore. You're all flops. I am the earth mother and you are all flops. The review bombing on the
1026480	1033440	first book didn't really surprise me. What did surprise me is that they kept doing it into the
1033440	1037600	second book. Like arguably there was more review bombing on the second book than there was on the
1037600	1042560	first. And that really did surprise me because I kind of figured that like the first one was going
1042560	1047840	to be emblematic of like all of the stuff that I, you know, unfairly accrued that I didn't deserve.
1047840	1053200	And then by book two, they would have gotten bored and moved on. But hang on my face. So and so the
1053200	1059200	result of this, I don't want to imply that like it's knocked like an entire star off my cumulative,
1060160	1066960	you know, Goodreads score or Amazon score. I, you know, it might have affected it a little bit,
1066960	1072480	but probably it hasn't. But again, like this isn't meant to really change the consumer's
1072480	1078720	mind because, you know, if someone leaves a one star review that like attacks me personally,
1079440	1083680	you know, I think that's not really going to dissuade someone from buying it. But since
1084240	1091360	Carl of Swindon has like literally just uploaded another video about me, like right before I
1091440	1103440	started recording this, you know, I guess his not at all creepy obsession with me is, you know,
1103440	1110000	I clearly he's trying to get my attention. So let me just address that. Carl,
1112160	1116720	I'm married. I'm flattered, you know, and I and I get that you've been trying really,
1116720	1121920	really hard to get my attention, you know, for obvious reasons. But again, I'm married.
1122960	1126880	I don't think it would really work out between us. You know, honestly, you're a little old for me.
1126880	1131760	But again, I'm flattered. And I really, really, really hope that Joanne gives you the attention
1131760	1137360	that you are so desperately, desperately craving. And as for Carl's fans, I'm very,
1137360	1143520	very sorry. I called you goblins. You're not goblins. You're trash pandas.
1144320	1149680	Number eight, imposter syndrome. It's funny because I can say like I still experience envy,
1150480	1157200	but I don't have imposter syndrome anywhere near on the level than I did like a year ago or even
1157200	1162800	six months ago. And I don't really know why, because it was like for the first few months,
1162800	1167840	like any positive feedback would just bounce right off me and any negative feedback was like,
1167840	1172240	whatever hurts is true. I'm garbage. I'm a terrible writer. You know, everyone who's
1172240	1177120	saying something nice is lying to me. And all of the mean things are the true thing.
1177120	1181040	And then I just kind of got over it. I don't know, like, again, like, I don't mean this to be a
1181040	1186400	humblebrag, but I think part of it definitely was like, you know, making it on a few best of the
1186400	1192000	year lists and then being nominated for a few awards and still nominated for an award. Just
1192000	1197840	glad to be nominated. Thank you. I know that comes across as a humblebrag. But the truth is that like,
1197840	1204800	yeah, honestly, like validation from like, you know, institutions did kind of help me,
1204800	1209520	you know, get over it. But honestly, the thing that really made me get over it was like finishing
1209520	1215760	the second book and just kind of like feeling secure unto myself. Like I was like, you know,
1215760	1220080	I know some people aren't going to like the direction that I went with it, especially
1220080	1224880	people who liked the first book. The tone is very different. The characters are pretty different.
1225120	1227680	I've seen people compare it to Uncut Gems.
1228560	1231200	Holy shit, I'm gonna f**k them.
1231200	1234960	You know, I think it's like people say it's a lot darker, but I also think it's a lot funnier.
1234960	1240160	Like, I think it's both. I think it's a better book all around. And I've seen people already who
1240160	1244080	do not agree. But where a year ago, the imposter syndrome would be like, oh, yes,
1244080	1248800	clearly I am trash. Now I'm like, whatever. You know, they're entitled to their opinion.
1248800	1252320	I disagree with them. And I think the truth is like, I don't really feel imposter syndrome on
1252320	1257120	YouTube either. Like whenever people are mean on YouTube, like I can either disagree with them or
1257120	1261760	see their points. Like, you know, I've seen people be like, I can't stand your affect. I can't stand
1261760	1266240	like this so like wine mom above it all. I'm so tired of everything. I'm like, well, yeah,
1266240	1270480	that is my brand. And if that doesn't interest you, then I can totally see why you don't like
1270480	1275280	my channel. But the thing about imposter syndrome is I do think external validation can help,
1275280	1280160	but that can't fix it. I think the only thing that can fix it is knowing what you're about
1280160	1284720	and just kind of creating a product that you feel secure in. And if you do that,
1284720	1291920	then it won't be miserable. Because as long as you're just like, doused in imposter syndrome,
1291920	1295920	then it's just not gonna be fun. And like, what is the point of all this if like,
1295920	1303440	you're not having a little bit of fun. Number eight, Goodreads is garbage. And by garbage,
1303440	1310080	I mean, don't go on Goodreads. Like, here's the thing. Goodreads is not for authors. It is not
1310080	1316000	for you. It is for readers. And so unless it's like a q&a or something, this is a conversation
1316720	1322880	that you were not invited to, you know, because people have the right to have their extremely,
1322880	1329840	extremely hyperbolic opinions in one direction or the other and without you like getting involved
1329840	1333600	with them. And because it's really, really easy to get obsessed with. And I learned really,
1333600	1336960	really early on, like before the first book even came out, like when it was still in like,
1336960	1340640	the arc phase that I'm just like, look, for my own mental health, I have to stay off Goodreads.
1341760	1349600	So stay off Goodreads. Anyway, I think it did a really good job at not making this a downer.
1349600	1356000	Glad we at least we still have Corona. Oh, sad. So anyway, in the US, the paperback of Axiom's
1356000	1362720	End is out now. In the UK, it's been out. But they just released the hardcover in the UK,
1362720	1367840	just to make things extra confusing. For truth of the divine, the hardcover will be in both the US
1367840	1376640	and the UK at the same time. And for all you ferners out there, maybe one day someone will
1376640	1383200	buy some foreign language rights. Again, I have no power over that at all. No, you cannot translate
1383200	1389120	it. Publisher has to buy it first, then you can translate it. You can work for them. Good luck out
1389120	1392080	there, all you aspiring novelists, you.
