1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
break out the parade floats and whatever it is we do to celebrate now because my book,

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,080
my first book has been out for more than a year and the paperback has just come out. So for all

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:19,200
of you people who said, I'm going to wait for the paperback, your time has come. Cheers.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:27,360
This was gifted to me six years ago, seven years ago by the very person who deletes all your

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,640
comments. This video has been brought to you by the official drink of the last 18 months.

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,600
Get it? Cause it's beer. Okay. So what are the most common things you get as an author is less

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:47,120
about your own work so much as the process and how this can be applied to aspiring writers.

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:54,240
Now that said, I don't know how helpful this will be because I definitely came in, uh,

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,440
deliberately. So with a large platform, because that's kind of, I don't want to say how it's done

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,440
now, but it definitely doesn't hurt. The title of this video is also a little bit of false

11
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,040
advertising. It would probably be more honest to say some things I wish I knew before I published

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,560
my first book. And also some things I kind of suspected, but hoped weren't true, but totally

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,800
were. I do kind of wish I could make these more like optimistic and inspirational than they are,

14
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,560
because I feel like every time I do a writing video, like half the comments are like, wow,

15
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,920
I give up. And I'm like, I don't know what to tell you, man. It's hard. I don't want to blow

16
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,640
smoke up your ass. When my mother yells at this, it's because she loves me. I was rooting for you.

17
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,320
We were all rooting for you. Yeah. It's harder than you think it is. If you think it's going

18
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,320
to be hard, it's, it's harder than that. So I'm going to make a promise to myself that I'm not

19
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,520
going to try to be a total downer. Keyword try. Okay. Number one, getting published is harder now

20
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:58,160
than it ever has been. I mean, it is what it is. So I think the paradox of self publishing,

21
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:05,040
becoming free and creating more access is that it also created more demand because a lot of people

22
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:12,320
who read a lot of books, they tend to read like mystery and romance and erotica. And those genres

23
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,960
do really well in self publishing and people who read those genres tend to read a lot. And then,

24
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,120
and then a lot of these people who spend a lot of time in like self published stuff do tend

25
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,800
sometimes to wade into traditionally published fiction. So why is it harder now than it's ever

26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,960
been? Well, believe it or not, demand is actually higher now, less because of the print side, so

27
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,400
much as the audio book side, which is the fastest growing part of the publishing industry right now.

28
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,960
And believe it or not, it is not a conflict of interest for me to use Audible as a sponsor.

29
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,120
I was surprised about that too. So if there's more demand and self publishing is kind of siphoning

30
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:58,480
off people that maybe don't belong in traditional publishing, why is it harder now? Well, I can

31
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,160
only kind of speculate, but I kind of suspect it's harder now for the same reason, uh, getting a movie

32
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,440
made, uh, at least a, you know, traditional Hollywood movie is harder now. Basically more

33
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:16,080
and more resources go to fewer and fewer projects. I have seen a lot of people say that the mid list

34
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,680
is dying. I'm considered a mid list author. Basically publishers will kind of go all in on

35
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,360
a few titles per year, usually by authors you've heard of, but sometimes by debuts, especially in,

36
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,000
uh, genre fiction, NYA fiction, and that kind of leaves fewer slots available. I think there's

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,960
also just more supply. A lot more people are trying to get published and really the hardest

38
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:47,360
steps, the getting the agent and then actually getting published. Um, those two steps are again,

39
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,400
higher than they've ever been because there are fewer slots available and more and more people

40
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,920
trying to get in. Number two, getting published does not mean you've made it. I mean, it means

41
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,800
you've been published, but like that doesn't guarantee you a career. And I feel like a lot

42
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,920
of people have this misconception that like, if you get a book published once you're in the club

43
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,960
and you're going to be fine. And it's not true. Uh, being an author is a constant, constant

44
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:23,040
struggle. And I know very few authors where that's their only job. And the ones I do know are like,

45
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,720
you know, John Scalzi, literal millionaires who published like 500 books. What does happen is

46
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,880
you might get published, you might have a lot of friends and contacts in the industry,

47
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,600
but then for whatever reason, um, maybe tastes change. The genre you write in isn't like hot

48
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,360
anymore. Uh, just because you sold a book before to a major publisher doesn't mean you'll have an

49
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:55,440
easy time from here on out. So no head. Number three, if you want something done, you've got to

50
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,000
do it yourself because your publisher won't do it for you. What I mean by this is if you need

51
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,040
research, if you need a lot of editorial assistance, if you need inspiration, they're

52
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,960
not going to do it for you. This really does depend on the editor. I've known of editors who,

53
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,440
um, are very hands-on and arguably take on more than they can handle both like emotionally and

54
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,400
in terms of workload. And they spend a lot of time with their authors, just like brainstorming

55
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:34,880
and workshopping. That was not my experience at all. I get like two emails a year with like,

56
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,120
you know, a list of six things to change. And then otherwise like, let me know when you're

57
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,520
further along. And then that's it. My editor is just very hands-off. At first, I was kind

58
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,960
of surprised by that because I guess I did expect to be like handheld, you know, because it's like,

59
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,600
I'm a debut. I don't know what I'm doing. And they're like, you know, turns out they don't

60
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,800
really treat debuts any different than anybody else. And so the journey of my second book was

61
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,800
very different from the first one, because I sought a lot more outside help. I hired outside

62
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,200
editors. I hired sensitivity readers. And I don't want to say like, that's a big regret I have with

63
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:18,000
the first book, because I guess that was sort of a lesson you kind of have to learn. Um, but I feel

64
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,240
like it really shows, like from book one to book two, like just sort of like the flow of the story

65
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,960
and the quality of the prose. I think it shows that I had a lot more input for book two than I

66
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,960
did book one. Which brings us to number four. It's really not a solo effort. I used to wonder why are

67
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,320
acknowledgments so long at the back of books? Because you need help. And I know that's not

68
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,360
like, I guess there's like, you know, those unicorns out there that like just push out a draft

69
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,840
and then it's done, and then they don't really need much help. But also, I don't think they're

70
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,600
trying to write the great American novel. You know, they're just trying to have a career,

71
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,960
like book, moving on, next book, moving on. And yeah, but it's just like, it is it's okay to ask

72
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,120
for help, even though like, you're going to get shot down, especially if you're like researching

73
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,040
and, you know, you need to like reach out to someone who's an expert in something, which I

74
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,160
didn't do very much in the first book, like hardly at all. But I did a lot in the second book,

75
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,680
because, you know, especially like for science fiction, it's kind of embarrassing be like,

76
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:30,080
yeah, hi, lawyer friend. Mind if I use your degree that you spent many years acquiring,

77
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,480
walking through the thought experiment of what giving, I don't know what the legal question of

78
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,040
aliens in America might look like. I don't know, just, just throwing it out there. Beta readers

79
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:49,440
I had one of my closest friends slash, you know, namesake for the character was my sort of cultural

80
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,400
attache for the second protagonist in the second book. And at first I was like, it doesn't matter.

81
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,960
But honestly, like, I cannot imagine what it would have been like now writing this character without,

82
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,160
you know, knowing someone really well and being comfortable enough with them to like message them

83
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,720
at all hours of the night like, hey, do Persians take their shoes off in the house? The answer is

84
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,200
yes. Turns out it's weird that, you know, Anglo Americans don't like most, most of the world looks

85
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:25,440
down on us for that. But by that same token, beware of too many cooks. I have definitely seen

86
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,360
people with books that especially like if they're kind of early on in their career, you can kind of

87
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,960
see where there's a lot of hands on it. So it's kind of a balance. And the only person who can

88
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:43,840
figure it out is you. Number five, this industry is full of jealous bitches. It's like a disease.

89
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:51,120
And I do not consider myself exempt from this. Coming from YouTube, I don't see a lot of gel.

90
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,440
Okay, I do see a lot of jealousy, but not like with people I'm friends with. There are definitely

91
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,520
some some jealous haters out there. But like the people I've known and worked with for a lot of

92
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:09,280
years, it's rare that you see like, oh, so and so has overtaken me in subs. That means I suck. Or,

93
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,600
wow, I wish I could have done that. Like, I definitely see that. And it always kind of pings

94
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,600
my like, you know, tiny red flags when people kind of go into, you know, a semi collaborative

95
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,280
medium with that mindset. But for the most part, I feel like at least in my little enclave of YouTube,

96
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,800
people are pretty good at not seeing other people's successes as reflective of their own

97
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,080
failure or lack of success. That is not always true. I have definitely known people who were

98
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:45,200
just pathologically incapable of being happy for other people in the YouTube community.

99
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,640
Why can't you just be happy for me and then go home and talk behind my back later like a normal

100
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,680
person? Every success someone else had was a reflection of their failure. But for the most

101
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:04,320
part, you don't see that a lot on YouTube. But in publishing, I don't. It's completely different.

102
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:11,600
Everybody is jealous all the time. And everyone is trying so hard to pretend like that is not the

103
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,960
case. I think it's because most people know it's kind of wrong to be, I'm sorry, envious.

104
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,280
Whereas envy is offensive. It's resentment over what someone else has that you lack.

105
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:30,080
Like everyone kind of knows that what does and does not take off or who does and doesn't get

106
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:37,760
published or who does and does not get X numbers. It isn't really a meritocracy. I would say that's

107
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,200
way more true in publishing than in YouTube. Because again, like bestsellers do tend to

108
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,640
have a lot of marketing money behind them. Or an influencer with a YouTube channel.

109
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,200
And again, this doesn't apply to everybody. I definitely know some authors that like,

110
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:01,120
either are just so, let's say confident that they don't experience envy, or they hide it really,

111
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,880
really well. Someone can be like a huge bestseller and still struggle with like, oh, you have the

112
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:13,600
respect of your X peers, or you have X fan base, or you have more fan art, or someone with very

113
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:20,320
little sales, but a lot of networking connections. People who are more on the commercial side of

114
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:27,520
things can be like, why don't I get awards nominated? Or why don't I get a lot of attention

115
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,160
on Twitter from people within the industry? It's like no matter how successful you are,

116
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,800
or well keyed in you are, everyone is jealous of everyone else. And I, you know, I am no

117
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,400
exception. Like I'll see someone like that I know, and I really enjoy and I really support,

118
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:48,160
like right out the gate, they get a review in the New York Times. And I'm like, so happy for you.

119
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:55,760
I'm really happy. And I don't know why this is more in publishing than YouTube. I think part of

120
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,200
it is, you know, because those really obvious metrics, like getting a solid recommendation

121
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:10,560
from a peer, or a review in a major outlet, are like really obvious signifiers of success,

122
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,160
as opposed to like on YouTube, where it's just a numbers game. But also like on YouTube, it's just

123
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,400
it like it's a numbers game in many ways. Like, yeah, you might pull in X many views, and everybody

124
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,080
can see it. But also just like, okay, I put out a video on to the next one on to the next one,

125
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:31,600
you're never going to work on a YouTube video as hard as you would on a novel. I take that back.

126
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,880
I know some people who absolutely have worked on YouTube videos as hard as they have, or would

127
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,840
have on a novel. And I think and I think the key here is to know this about themselves. And most

128
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:47,200
people do. And, you know, push through it. Because I think the only way to, you know, healthfully

129
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,440
live with envy is to know that's what's going on in your head. And just get over it. Because there

130
00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:00,640
is absolutely no harm in being happy for other people. Number six, you need more practice than

131
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,640
you think you do. I mean, that's just basically what it says on the header. I don't know if I

132
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,320
need to clarify that. I see way too many people, you know, myself, you know, six years ago included

133
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,200
that, you know, no, they're not gonna knock it out of the park on the first try, but kind of

134
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,720
hope they will. And I don't really understand where this impulse or expectation from others

135
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,240
comes from. In my case, I did see a bunch of people coming in with this expectation that

136
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:35,600
because they respect my work so much on YouTube, I was going to automatically be perfect as a

137
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:44,400
novelist. And I'm like, I have been doing this for 13 years, I have had a long time to kind of

138
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:53,120
refine like my timing and my voice and like the way I construct arguments and narratives

139
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,480
and editing. And also it's nonfiction. It's completely different. Oh, I kind of, you know,

140
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:05,840
I expected better from you. And it's like, whenever I see people who, you know, just become

141
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,840
so obsessed with this idea that their first novel has to be perfect. I get it because people are

142
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:19,520
like, weirdly judgmental in their expectations of like, what a debut novel looks like. Like,

143
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,640
you don't expect someone's first YouTube video to like be on the level with their 20th. Why would

144
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,040
you feel the same about a book? And yet people think that way. And I think it's really inhibits

145
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,320
people. You know, in hindsight, I wish I had given myself more slack to not be perfect. But I think

146
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:41,520
in general, like, I think more people need to stop trying to be perfect and just accept it's

147
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,520
your first try. I mean, no book is going to ever be perfect, but your first one,

148
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:53,200
it's still your first one. Cut yourself some slack. Number seven, review bombing. I hoped I

149
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:59,760
was being paranoid. I hoped people wouldn't actually do this. But you know, jealous haters,

150
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,640
they absolutely did. So when I say review bombing, I don't mean negative reviews. I mean, like,

151
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:12,800
basically, like, pettily one-starring a book because they hate me personally. And I really

152
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:21,600
only started to notice this after someone released a video stating that the only reason I had ever

153
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:29,920
made content criticizing JK Rowling was to promote my own book. And then a bunch of his goblins,

154
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:37,120
sorry, fans, then went on to places like Goodreads to, you know, mass one-star the book.

155
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,960
And I don't want to make it sound like it was like hundreds of people. It's hundreds of them

156
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:47,040
here on YouTube, maybe like a few dozen on like over Goodreads and Amazon. The rationale being

157
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:59,840
that I don't disagree with JK Rowling because of a specific and I would say, very highly articulated

158
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:07,600
disagreement I have with her political views, which she has many times unambiguously made clear

159
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:18,960
in public. But because I'm clout chasing, I'm riding the wave of JKR hate to promote my own work.

160
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,600
Which tells you an awful lot about how Carl thinks. So yeah, the point of review bombing is

161
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,800
definitely to bring down the property value of your brand, but mostly it's just to hurt you.

162
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,120
It's just to be cruel, be catty. And I don't want to make it sound like it was just Carl

163
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:46,560
and his followers. There was definitely some review bombing after the incident in March,

164
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:53,600
where for a month it was popular on lefty Twitter to, you know, go after me. Weird how they got

165
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,720
over that. It's weird. It's weird how I don't get like threatening messages from those people

166
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:06,480
anymore. You're all flops. I am the earth mother and you are all flops. The review bombing on the

167
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:13,440
first book didn't really surprise me. What did surprise me is that they kept doing it into the

168
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,600
second book. Like arguably there was more review bombing on the second book than there was on the

169
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,560
first. And that really did surprise me because I kind of figured that like the first one was going

170
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,840
to be emblematic of like all of the stuff that I, you know, unfairly accrued that I didn't deserve.

171
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:33,200
And then by book two, they would have gotten bored and moved on. But hang on my face. So and so the

172
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,200
result of this, I don't want to imply that like it's knocked like an entire star off my cumulative,

173
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,960
you know, Goodreads score or Amazon score. I, you know, it might have affected it a little bit,

174
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,480
but probably it hasn't. But again, like this isn't meant to really change the consumer's

175
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,720
mind because, you know, if someone leaves a one star review that like attacks me personally,

176
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,680
you know, I think that's not really going to dissuade someone from buying it. But since

177
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:11,360
Carl of Swindon has like literally just uploaded another video about me, like right before I

178
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:23,440
started recording this, you know, I guess his not at all creepy obsession with me is, you know,

179
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:30,000
I clearly he's trying to get my attention. So let me just address that. Carl,

180
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,720
I'm married. I'm flattered, you know, and I and I get that you've been trying really,

181
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,920
really hard to get my attention, you know, for obvious reasons. But again, I'm married.

182
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,880
I don't think it would really work out between us. You know, honestly, you're a little old for me.

183
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,760
But again, I'm flattered. And I really, really, really hope that Joanne gives you the attention

184
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,360
that you are so desperately, desperately craving. And as for Carl's fans, I'm very,

185
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,520
very sorry. I called you goblins. You're not goblins. You're trash pandas.

186
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,680
Number eight, imposter syndrome. It's funny because I can say like I still experience envy,

187
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:17,200
but I don't have imposter syndrome anywhere near on the level than I did like a year ago or even

188
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,800
six months ago. And I don't really know why, because it was like for the first few months,

189
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,840
like any positive feedback would just bounce right off me and any negative feedback was like,

190
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,240
whatever hurts is true. I'm garbage. I'm a terrible writer. You know, everyone who's

191
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,120
saying something nice is lying to me. And all of the mean things are the true thing.

192
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,040
And then I just kind of got over it. I don't know, like, again, like, I don't mean this to be a

193
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,400
humblebrag, but I think part of it definitely was like, you know, making it on a few best of the

194
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,000
year lists and then being nominated for a few awards and still nominated for an award. Just

195
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,840
glad to be nominated. Thank you. I know that comes across as a humblebrag. But the truth is that like,

196
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:04,800
yeah, honestly, like validation from like, you know, institutions did kind of help me,

197
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,520
you know, get over it. But honestly, the thing that really made me get over it was like finishing

198
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,760
the second book and just kind of like feeling secure unto myself. Like I was like, you know,

199
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,080
I know some people aren't going to like the direction that I went with it, especially

200
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,880
people who liked the first book. The tone is very different. The characters are pretty different.

201
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,680
I've seen people compare it to Uncut Gems.

202
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,200
Holy shit, I'm gonna f**k them.

203
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,960
You know, I think it's like people say it's a lot darker, but I also think it's a lot funnier.

204
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,160
Like, I think it's both. I think it's a better book all around. And I've seen people already who

205
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,080
do not agree. But where a year ago, the imposter syndrome would be like, oh, yes,

206
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,800
clearly I am trash. Now I'm like, whatever. You know, they're entitled to their opinion.

207
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,320
I disagree with them. And I think the truth is like, I don't really feel imposter syndrome on

208
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,120
YouTube either. Like whenever people are mean on YouTube, like I can either disagree with them or

209
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,760
see their points. Like, you know, I've seen people be like, I can't stand your affect. I can't stand

210
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,240
like this so like wine mom above it all. I'm so tired of everything. I'm like, well, yeah,

211
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,480
that is my brand. And if that doesn't interest you, then I can totally see why you don't like

212
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,280
my channel. But the thing about imposter syndrome is I do think external validation can help,

213
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,160
but that can't fix it. I think the only thing that can fix it is knowing what you're about

214
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,720
and just kind of creating a product that you feel secure in. And if you do that,

215
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:31,920
then it won't be miserable. Because as long as you're just like, doused in imposter syndrome,

216
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,920
then it's just not gonna be fun. And like, what is the point of all this if like,

217
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:43,440
you're not having a little bit of fun. Number eight, Goodreads is garbage. And by garbage,

218
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:50,080
I mean, don't go on Goodreads. Like, here's the thing. Goodreads is not for authors. It is not

219
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,000
for you. It is for readers. And so unless it's like a q&a or something, this is a conversation

220
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,880
that you were not invited to, you know, because people have the right to have their extremely,

221
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:09,840
extremely hyperbolic opinions in one direction or the other and without you like getting involved

222
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,600
with them. And because it's really, really easy to get obsessed with. And I learned really,

223
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,960
really early on, like before the first book even came out, like when it was still in like,

224
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,640
the arc phase that I'm just like, look, for my own mental health, I have to stay off Goodreads.

225
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:29,600
So stay off Goodreads. Anyway, I think it did a really good job at not making this a downer.

226
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:36,000
Glad we at least we still have Corona. Oh, sad. So anyway, in the US, the paperback of Axiom's

227
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,720
End is out now. In the UK, it's been out. But they just released the hardcover in the UK,

228
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,840
just to make things extra confusing. For truth of the divine, the hardcover will be in both the US

229
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:56,640
and the UK at the same time. And for all you ferners out there, maybe one day someone will

230
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:03,200
buy some foreign language rights. Again, I have no power over that at all. No, you cannot translate

231
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,120
it. Publisher has to buy it first, then you can translate it. You can work for them. Good luck out

232
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,080
there, all you aspiring novelists, you.
