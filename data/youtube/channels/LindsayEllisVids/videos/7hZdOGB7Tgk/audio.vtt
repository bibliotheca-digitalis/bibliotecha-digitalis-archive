WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.240
break out the parade floats and whatever it is we do to celebrate now because my book,

00:06.240 --> 00:12.080
my first book has been out for more than a year and the paperback has just come out. So for all

00:12.080 --> 00:19.200
of you people who said, I'm going to wait for the paperback, your time has come. Cheers.

00:21.120 --> 00:27.360
This was gifted to me six years ago, seven years ago by the very person who deletes all your

00:27.360 --> 00:32.640
comments. This video has been brought to you by the official drink of the last 18 months.

00:34.080 --> 00:39.600
Get it? Cause it's beer. Okay. So what are the most common things you get as an author is less

00:39.600 --> 00:47.120
about your own work so much as the process and how this can be applied to aspiring writers.

00:47.120 --> 00:54.240
Now that said, I don't know how helpful this will be because I definitely came in, uh,

00:54.240 --> 00:59.440
deliberately. So with a large platform, because that's kind of, I don't want to say how it's done

00:59.440 --> 01:05.440
now, but it definitely doesn't hurt. The title of this video is also a little bit of false

01:05.440 --> 01:11.040
advertising. It would probably be more honest to say some things I wish I knew before I published

01:11.040 --> 01:18.560
my first book. And also some things I kind of suspected, but hoped weren't true, but totally

01:18.560 --> 01:24.800
were. I do kind of wish I could make these more like optimistic and inspirational than they are,

01:24.800 --> 01:28.560
because I feel like every time I do a writing video, like half the comments are like, wow,

01:29.760 --> 01:33.920
I give up. And I'm like, I don't know what to tell you, man. It's hard. I don't want to blow

01:33.920 --> 01:38.640
smoke up your ass. When my mother yells at this, it's because she loves me. I was rooting for you.

01:38.640 --> 01:42.320
We were all rooting for you. Yeah. It's harder than you think it is. If you think it's going

01:42.320 --> 01:46.320
to be hard, it's, it's harder than that. So I'm going to make a promise to myself that I'm not

01:46.320 --> 01:51.520
going to try to be a total downer. Keyword try. Okay. Number one, getting published is harder now

01:51.520 --> 01:58.160
than it ever has been. I mean, it is what it is. So I think the paradox of self publishing,

01:58.160 --> 02:05.040
becoming free and creating more access is that it also created more demand because a lot of people

02:05.040 --> 02:12.320
who read a lot of books, they tend to read like mystery and romance and erotica. And those genres

02:12.320 --> 02:16.960
do really well in self publishing and people who read those genres tend to read a lot. And then,

02:16.960 --> 02:21.120
and then a lot of these people who spend a lot of time in like self published stuff do tend

02:21.120 --> 02:26.800
sometimes to wade into traditionally published fiction. So why is it harder now than it's ever

02:26.800 --> 02:32.960
been? Well, believe it or not, demand is actually higher now, less because of the print side, so

02:32.960 --> 02:38.400
much as the audio book side, which is the fastest growing part of the publishing industry right now.

02:38.400 --> 02:44.960
And believe it or not, it is not a conflict of interest for me to use Audible as a sponsor.

02:46.080 --> 02:51.120
I was surprised about that too. So if there's more demand and self publishing is kind of siphoning

02:51.120 --> 02:58.480
off people that maybe don't belong in traditional publishing, why is it harder now? Well, I can

02:58.480 --> 03:04.160
only kind of speculate, but I kind of suspect it's harder now for the same reason, uh, getting a movie

03:04.160 --> 03:09.440
made, uh, at least a, you know, traditional Hollywood movie is harder now. Basically more

03:09.440 --> 03:16.080
and more resources go to fewer and fewer projects. I have seen a lot of people say that the mid list

03:16.080 --> 03:21.680
is dying. I'm considered a mid list author. Basically publishers will kind of go all in on

03:21.680 --> 03:27.360
a few titles per year, usually by authors you've heard of, but sometimes by debuts, especially in,

03:27.360 --> 03:34.000
uh, genre fiction, NYA fiction, and that kind of leaves fewer slots available. I think there's

03:34.000 --> 03:40.960
also just more supply. A lot more people are trying to get published and really the hardest

03:40.960 --> 03:47.360
steps, the getting the agent and then actually getting published. Um, those two steps are again,

03:47.360 --> 03:52.400
higher than they've ever been because there are fewer slots available and more and more people

03:52.400 --> 03:57.920
trying to get in. Number two, getting published does not mean you've made it. I mean, it means

03:57.920 --> 04:02.800
you've been published, but like that doesn't guarantee you a career. And I feel like a lot

04:02.800 --> 04:07.920
of people have this misconception that like, if you get a book published once you're in the club

04:07.920 --> 04:14.960
and you're going to be fine. And it's not true. Uh, being an author is a constant, constant

04:14.960 --> 04:23.040
struggle. And I know very few authors where that's their only job. And the ones I do know are like,

04:23.040 --> 04:28.720
you know, John Scalzi, literal millionaires who published like 500 books. What does happen is

04:28.720 --> 04:32.880
you might get published, you might have a lot of friends and contacts in the industry,

04:32.880 --> 04:39.600
but then for whatever reason, um, maybe tastes change. The genre you write in isn't like hot

04:39.600 --> 04:45.360
anymore. Uh, just because you sold a book before to a major publisher doesn't mean you'll have an

04:45.360 --> 04:55.440
easy time from here on out. So no head. Number three, if you want something done, you've got to

04:55.440 --> 05:02.000
do it yourself because your publisher won't do it for you. What I mean by this is if you need

05:02.000 --> 05:09.040
research, if you need a lot of editorial assistance, if you need inspiration, they're

05:09.040 --> 05:14.960
not going to do it for you. This really does depend on the editor. I've known of editors who,

05:14.960 --> 05:21.440
um, are very hands-on and arguably take on more than they can handle both like emotionally and

05:21.440 --> 05:26.400
in terms of workload. And they spend a lot of time with their authors, just like brainstorming

05:26.400 --> 05:34.880
and workshopping. That was not my experience at all. I get like two emails a year with like,

05:34.880 --> 05:39.120
you know, a list of six things to change. And then otherwise like, let me know when you're

05:39.120 --> 05:43.520
further along. And then that's it. My editor is just very hands-off. At first, I was kind

05:43.520 --> 05:48.960
of surprised by that because I guess I did expect to be like handheld, you know, because it's like,

05:48.960 --> 05:55.600
I'm a debut. I don't know what I'm doing. And they're like, you know, turns out they don't

05:55.600 --> 06:00.800
really treat debuts any different than anybody else. And so the journey of my second book was

06:00.800 --> 06:06.800
very different from the first one, because I sought a lot more outside help. I hired outside

06:06.800 --> 06:11.200
editors. I hired sensitivity readers. And I don't want to say like, that's a big regret I have with

06:11.200 --> 06:18.000
the first book, because I guess that was sort of a lesson you kind of have to learn. Um, but I feel

06:18.000 --> 06:24.240
like it really shows, like from book one to book two, like just sort of like the flow of the story

06:24.240 --> 06:30.960
and the quality of the prose. I think it shows that I had a lot more input for book two than I

06:30.960 --> 06:36.960
did book one. Which brings us to number four. It's really not a solo effort. I used to wonder why are

06:36.960 --> 06:42.320
acknowledgments so long at the back of books? Because you need help. And I know that's not

06:42.320 --> 06:47.360
like, I guess there's like, you know, those unicorns out there that like just push out a draft

06:47.360 --> 06:51.840
and then it's done, and then they don't really need much help. But also, I don't think they're

06:51.840 --> 06:55.600
trying to write the great American novel. You know, they're just trying to have a career,

06:55.600 --> 07:00.960
like book, moving on, next book, moving on. And yeah, but it's just like, it is it's okay to ask

07:00.960 --> 07:05.120
for help, even though like, you're going to get shot down, especially if you're like researching

07:05.120 --> 07:11.040
and, you know, you need to like reach out to someone who's an expert in something, which I

07:11.040 --> 07:16.160
didn't do very much in the first book, like hardly at all. But I did a lot in the second book,

07:16.160 --> 07:19.680
because, you know, especially like for science fiction, it's kind of embarrassing be like,

07:20.240 --> 07:30.080
yeah, hi, lawyer friend. Mind if I use your degree that you spent many years acquiring,

07:30.800 --> 07:36.480
walking through the thought experiment of what giving, I don't know what the legal question of

07:36.480 --> 07:41.040
aliens in America might look like. I don't know, just, just throwing it out there. Beta readers

07:41.680 --> 07:49.440
I had one of my closest friends slash, you know, namesake for the character was my sort of cultural

07:49.440 --> 07:54.400
attache for the second protagonist in the second book. And at first I was like, it doesn't matter.

07:54.400 --> 08:00.960
But honestly, like, I cannot imagine what it would have been like now writing this character without,

08:00.960 --> 08:06.160
you know, knowing someone really well and being comfortable enough with them to like message them

08:06.160 --> 08:12.720
at all hours of the night like, hey, do Persians take their shoes off in the house? The answer is

08:12.720 --> 08:19.200
yes. Turns out it's weird that, you know, Anglo Americans don't like most, most of the world looks

08:19.200 --> 08:25.440
down on us for that. But by that same token, beware of too many cooks. I have definitely seen

08:25.440 --> 08:31.360
people with books that especially like if they're kind of early on in their career, you can kind of

08:31.360 --> 08:36.960
see where there's a lot of hands on it. So it's kind of a balance. And the only person who can

08:36.960 --> 08:43.840
figure it out is you. Number five, this industry is full of jealous bitches. It's like a disease.

08:43.840 --> 08:51.120
And I do not consider myself exempt from this. Coming from YouTube, I don't see a lot of gel.

08:51.120 --> 08:55.440
Okay, I do see a lot of jealousy, but not like with people I'm friends with. There are definitely

08:55.440 --> 09:01.520
some some jealous haters out there. But like the people I've known and worked with for a lot of

09:01.520 --> 09:09.280
years, it's rare that you see like, oh, so and so has overtaken me in subs. That means I suck. Or,

09:09.280 --> 09:13.600
wow, I wish I could have done that. Like, I definitely see that. And it always kind of pings

09:13.600 --> 09:19.600
my like, you know, tiny red flags when people kind of go into, you know, a semi collaborative

09:19.600 --> 09:25.280
medium with that mindset. But for the most part, I feel like at least in my little enclave of YouTube,

09:25.440 --> 09:32.800
people are pretty good at not seeing other people's successes as reflective of their own

09:32.800 --> 09:38.080
failure or lack of success. That is not always true. I have definitely known people who were

09:38.080 --> 09:45.200
just pathologically incapable of being happy for other people in the YouTube community.

09:45.200 --> 09:50.640
Why can't you just be happy for me and then go home and talk behind my back later like a normal

09:50.640 --> 09:55.680
person? Every success someone else had was a reflection of their failure. But for the most

09:55.680 --> 10:04.320
part, you don't see that a lot on YouTube. But in publishing, I don't. It's completely different.

10:04.320 --> 10:11.600
Everybody is jealous all the time. And everyone is trying so hard to pretend like that is not the

10:11.600 --> 10:16.960
case. I think it's because most people know it's kind of wrong to be, I'm sorry, envious.

10:17.680 --> 10:23.280
Whereas envy is offensive. It's resentment over what someone else has that you lack.

10:23.280 --> 10:30.080
Like everyone kind of knows that what does and does not take off or who does and doesn't get

10:30.080 --> 10:37.760
published or who does and does not get X numbers. It isn't really a meritocracy. I would say that's

10:37.760 --> 10:43.200
way more true in publishing than in YouTube. Because again, like bestsellers do tend to

10:43.280 --> 10:48.640
have a lot of marketing money behind them. Or an influencer with a YouTube channel.

10:48.640 --> 10:53.200
And again, this doesn't apply to everybody. I definitely know some authors that like,

10:53.200 --> 11:01.120
either are just so, let's say confident that they don't experience envy, or they hide it really,

11:01.120 --> 11:06.880
really well. Someone can be like a huge bestseller and still struggle with like, oh, you have the

11:06.880 --> 11:13.600
respect of your X peers, or you have X fan base, or you have more fan art, or someone with very

11:13.600 --> 11:20.320
little sales, but a lot of networking connections. People who are more on the commercial side of

11:20.320 --> 11:27.520
things can be like, why don't I get awards nominated? Or why don't I get a lot of attention

11:27.520 --> 11:32.160
on Twitter from people within the industry? It's like no matter how successful you are,

11:32.160 --> 11:36.800
or well keyed in you are, everyone is jealous of everyone else. And I, you know, I am no

11:36.800 --> 11:42.400
exception. Like I'll see someone like that I know, and I really enjoy and I really support,

11:42.400 --> 11:48.160
like right out the gate, they get a review in the New York Times. And I'm like, so happy for you.

11:49.280 --> 11:55.760
I'm really happy. And I don't know why this is more in publishing than YouTube. I think part of

11:55.760 --> 12:01.200
it is, you know, because those really obvious metrics, like getting a solid recommendation

12:01.200 --> 12:10.560
from a peer, or a review in a major outlet, are like really obvious signifiers of success,

12:10.560 --> 12:16.160
as opposed to like on YouTube, where it's just a numbers game. But also like on YouTube, it's just

12:16.160 --> 12:22.400
it like it's a numbers game in many ways. Like, yeah, you might pull in X many views, and everybody

12:22.400 --> 12:26.080
can see it. But also just like, okay, I put out a video on to the next one on to the next one,

12:26.080 --> 12:31.600
you're never going to work on a YouTube video as hard as you would on a novel. I take that back.

12:31.600 --> 12:36.880
I know some people who absolutely have worked on YouTube videos as hard as they have, or would

12:36.880 --> 12:41.840
have on a novel. And I think and I think the key here is to know this about themselves. And most

12:41.840 --> 12:47.200
people do. And, you know, push through it. Because I think the only way to, you know, healthfully

12:47.200 --> 12:53.440
live with envy is to know that's what's going on in your head. And just get over it. Because there

12:53.520 --> 13:00.640
is absolutely no harm in being happy for other people. Number six, you need more practice than

13:00.640 --> 13:04.640
you think you do. I mean, that's just basically what it says on the header. I don't know if I

13:04.640 --> 13:10.320
need to clarify that. I see way too many people, you know, myself, you know, six years ago included

13:10.320 --> 13:15.200
that, you know, no, they're not gonna knock it out of the park on the first try, but kind of

13:15.760 --> 13:22.720
hope they will. And I don't really understand where this impulse or expectation from others

13:22.720 --> 13:28.240
comes from. In my case, I did see a bunch of people coming in with this expectation that

13:28.240 --> 13:35.600
because they respect my work so much on YouTube, I was going to automatically be perfect as a

13:35.600 --> 13:44.400
novelist. And I'm like, I have been doing this for 13 years, I have had a long time to kind of

13:44.960 --> 13:53.120
refine like my timing and my voice and like the way I construct arguments and narratives

13:53.120 --> 13:58.480
and editing. And also it's nonfiction. It's completely different. Oh, I kind of, you know,

13:58.480 --> 14:05.840
I expected better from you. And it's like, whenever I see people who, you know, just become

14:05.840 --> 14:11.840
so obsessed with this idea that their first novel has to be perfect. I get it because people are

14:11.840 --> 14:19.520
like, weirdly judgmental in their expectations of like, what a debut novel looks like. Like,

14:19.520 --> 14:24.640
you don't expect someone's first YouTube video to like be on the level with their 20th. Why would

14:24.640 --> 14:29.040
you feel the same about a book? And yet people think that way. And I think it's really inhibits

14:29.040 --> 14:34.320
people. You know, in hindsight, I wish I had given myself more slack to not be perfect. But I think

14:34.320 --> 14:41.520
in general, like, I think more people need to stop trying to be perfect and just accept it's

14:41.600 --> 14:45.520
your first try. I mean, no book is going to ever be perfect, but your first one,

14:46.240 --> 14:53.200
it's still your first one. Cut yourself some slack. Number seven, review bombing. I hoped I

14:53.200 --> 14:59.760
was being paranoid. I hoped people wouldn't actually do this. But you know, jealous haters,

14:59.760 --> 15:04.640
they absolutely did. So when I say review bombing, I don't mean negative reviews. I mean, like,

15:04.640 --> 15:12.800
basically, like, pettily one-starring a book because they hate me personally. And I really

15:12.800 --> 15:21.600
only started to notice this after someone released a video stating that the only reason I had ever

15:21.600 --> 15:29.920
made content criticizing JK Rowling was to promote my own book. And then a bunch of his goblins,

15:29.920 --> 15:37.120
sorry, fans, then went on to places like Goodreads to, you know, mass one-star the book.

15:37.120 --> 15:40.960
And I don't want to make it sound like it was like hundreds of people. It's hundreds of them

15:40.960 --> 15:47.040
here on YouTube, maybe like a few dozen on like over Goodreads and Amazon. The rationale being

15:47.040 --> 15:59.840
that I don't disagree with JK Rowling because of a specific and I would say, very highly articulated

15:59.840 --> 16:07.600
disagreement I have with her political views, which she has many times unambiguously made clear

16:07.600 --> 16:18.960
in public. But because I'm clout chasing, I'm riding the wave of JKR hate to promote my own work.

16:20.240 --> 16:25.600
Which tells you an awful lot about how Carl thinks. So yeah, the point of review bombing is

16:25.920 --> 16:32.800
definitely to bring down the property value of your brand, but mostly it's just to hurt you.

16:33.360 --> 16:39.120
It's just to be cruel, be catty. And I don't want to make it sound like it was just Carl

16:39.120 --> 16:46.560
and his followers. There was definitely some review bombing after the incident in March,

16:46.560 --> 16:53.600
where for a month it was popular on lefty Twitter to, you know, go after me. Weird how they got

16:53.600 --> 16:58.720
over that. It's weird. It's weird how I don't get like threatening messages from those people

16:58.720 --> 17:06.480
anymore. You're all flops. I am the earth mother and you are all flops. The review bombing on the

17:06.480 --> 17:13.440
first book didn't really surprise me. What did surprise me is that they kept doing it into the

17:13.440 --> 17:17.600
second book. Like arguably there was more review bombing on the second book than there was on the

17:17.600 --> 17:22.560
first. And that really did surprise me because I kind of figured that like the first one was going

17:22.560 --> 17:27.840
to be emblematic of like all of the stuff that I, you know, unfairly accrued that I didn't deserve.

17:27.840 --> 17:33.200
And then by book two, they would have gotten bored and moved on. But hang on my face. So and so the

17:33.200 --> 17:39.200
result of this, I don't want to imply that like it's knocked like an entire star off my cumulative,

17:40.160 --> 17:46.960
you know, Goodreads score or Amazon score. I, you know, it might have affected it a little bit,

17:46.960 --> 17:52.480
but probably it hasn't. But again, like this isn't meant to really change the consumer's

17:52.480 --> 17:58.720
mind because, you know, if someone leaves a one star review that like attacks me personally,

17:59.440 --> 18:03.680
you know, I think that's not really going to dissuade someone from buying it. But since

18:04.240 --> 18:11.360
Carl of Swindon has like literally just uploaded another video about me, like right before I

18:11.440 --> 18:23.440
started recording this, you know, I guess his not at all creepy obsession with me is, you know,

18:23.440 --> 18:30.000
I clearly he's trying to get my attention. So let me just address that. Carl,

18:32.160 --> 18:36.720
I'm married. I'm flattered, you know, and I and I get that you've been trying really,

18:36.720 --> 18:41.920
really hard to get my attention, you know, for obvious reasons. But again, I'm married.

18:42.960 --> 18:46.880
I don't think it would really work out between us. You know, honestly, you're a little old for me.

18:46.880 --> 18:51.760
But again, I'm flattered. And I really, really, really hope that Joanne gives you the attention

18:51.760 --> 18:57.360
that you are so desperately, desperately craving. And as for Carl's fans, I'm very,

18:57.360 --> 19:03.520
very sorry. I called you goblins. You're not goblins. You're trash pandas.

19:04.320 --> 19:09.680
Number eight, imposter syndrome. It's funny because I can say like I still experience envy,

19:10.480 --> 19:17.200
but I don't have imposter syndrome anywhere near on the level than I did like a year ago or even

19:17.200 --> 19:22.800
six months ago. And I don't really know why, because it was like for the first few months,

19:22.800 --> 19:27.840
like any positive feedback would just bounce right off me and any negative feedback was like,

19:27.840 --> 19:32.240
whatever hurts is true. I'm garbage. I'm a terrible writer. You know, everyone who's

19:32.240 --> 19:37.120
saying something nice is lying to me. And all of the mean things are the true thing.

19:37.120 --> 19:41.040
And then I just kind of got over it. I don't know, like, again, like, I don't mean this to be a

19:41.040 --> 19:46.400
humblebrag, but I think part of it definitely was like, you know, making it on a few best of the

19:46.400 --> 19:52.000
year lists and then being nominated for a few awards and still nominated for an award. Just

19:52.000 --> 19:57.840
glad to be nominated. Thank you. I know that comes across as a humblebrag. But the truth is that like,

19:57.840 --> 20:04.800
yeah, honestly, like validation from like, you know, institutions did kind of help me,

20:04.800 --> 20:09.520
you know, get over it. But honestly, the thing that really made me get over it was like finishing

20:09.520 --> 20:15.760
the second book and just kind of like feeling secure unto myself. Like I was like, you know,

20:15.760 --> 20:20.080
I know some people aren't going to like the direction that I went with it, especially

20:20.080 --> 20:24.880
people who liked the first book. The tone is very different. The characters are pretty different.

20:25.120 --> 20:27.680
I've seen people compare it to Uncut Gems.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.200
Holy shit, I'm gonna f**k them.

20:31.200 --> 20:34.960
You know, I think it's like people say it's a lot darker, but I also think it's a lot funnier.

20:34.960 --> 20:40.160
Like, I think it's both. I think it's a better book all around. And I've seen people already who

20:40.160 --> 20:44.080
do not agree. But where a year ago, the imposter syndrome would be like, oh, yes,

20:44.080 --> 20:48.800
clearly I am trash. Now I'm like, whatever. You know, they're entitled to their opinion.

20:48.800 --> 20:52.320
I disagree with them. And I think the truth is like, I don't really feel imposter syndrome on

20:52.320 --> 20:57.120
YouTube either. Like whenever people are mean on YouTube, like I can either disagree with them or

20:57.120 --> 21:01.760
see their points. Like, you know, I've seen people be like, I can't stand your affect. I can't stand

21:01.760 --> 21:06.240
like this so like wine mom above it all. I'm so tired of everything. I'm like, well, yeah,

21:06.240 --> 21:10.480
that is my brand. And if that doesn't interest you, then I can totally see why you don't like

21:10.480 --> 21:15.280
my channel. But the thing about imposter syndrome is I do think external validation can help,

21:15.280 --> 21:20.160
but that can't fix it. I think the only thing that can fix it is knowing what you're about

21:20.160 --> 21:24.720
and just kind of creating a product that you feel secure in. And if you do that,

21:24.720 --> 21:31.920
then it won't be miserable. Because as long as you're just like, doused in imposter syndrome,

21:31.920 --> 21:35.920
then it's just not gonna be fun. And like, what is the point of all this if like,

21:35.920 --> 21:43.440
you're not having a little bit of fun. Number eight, Goodreads is garbage. And by garbage,

21:43.440 --> 21:50.080
I mean, don't go on Goodreads. Like, here's the thing. Goodreads is not for authors. It is not

21:50.080 --> 21:56.000
for you. It is for readers. And so unless it's like a q&a or something, this is a conversation

21:56.720 --> 22:02.880
that you were not invited to, you know, because people have the right to have their extremely,

22:02.880 --> 22:09.840
extremely hyperbolic opinions in one direction or the other and without you like getting involved

22:09.840 --> 22:13.600
with them. And because it's really, really easy to get obsessed with. And I learned really,

22:13.600 --> 22:16.960
really early on, like before the first book even came out, like when it was still in like,

22:16.960 --> 22:20.640
the arc phase that I'm just like, look, for my own mental health, I have to stay off Goodreads.

22:21.760 --> 22:29.600
So stay off Goodreads. Anyway, I think it did a really good job at not making this a downer.

22:29.600 --> 22:36.000
Glad we at least we still have Corona. Oh, sad. So anyway, in the US, the paperback of Axiom's

22:36.000 --> 22:42.720
End is out now. In the UK, it's been out. But they just released the hardcover in the UK,

22:42.720 --> 22:47.840
just to make things extra confusing. For truth of the divine, the hardcover will be in both the US

22:47.840 --> 22:56.640
and the UK at the same time. And for all you ferners out there, maybe one day someone will

22:56.640 --> 23:03.200
buy some foreign language rights. Again, I have no power over that at all. No, you cannot translate

23:03.200 --> 23:09.120
it. Publisher has to buy it first, then you can translate it. You can work for them. Good luck out

23:09.120 --> 23:12.080
there, all you aspiring novelists, you.
