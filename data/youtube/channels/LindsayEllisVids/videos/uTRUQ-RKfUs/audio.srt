1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,720
In mid-2015, less than a year before her death, author Harper Lee published her second novel,

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,480
Go Set a Watchman, a sequel to her first and only other published novel, 1960's To Kill

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,480
a Mockingbird.

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,920
Though the book was published 55 years after To Kill a Mockingbird, it is generally accepted

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,640
now that Go Set a Watchman was actually written concurrent to or even before To Kill a Mockingbird,

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,200
and in the process of writing To Kill a Mockingbird, rather than encouraging her to create the

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,680
entire omnibus, the publisher urged Lee to focus on the childhood aspect, and not on

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,740
Scout becoming an adult and growing into a more complete understanding of who her father,

9
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,280
Atticus Finch, was.

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,500
Generations of people had grown up with Atticus Finch, played with such power and pathos by

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:53,100
Gregory Peck in the 1962 film adaptation, only to then have the author swoop in 55 years

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,760
later and remove the halo adorning Atticus Finch.

13
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,920
There is some debate as to whether or not the publisher took advantage of Harper Lee

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,640
given her age and the fact that she may not have been in possession of her full faculties

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,880
when Go Set a Watchman was published, but it is kind of out there now that Go Set a

16
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,600
Watchman was always kind of a part of her authorial intent.

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,220
To Kill a Mockingbird was written from the point of view of an adult reflecting the understanding

18
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,400
of a child, but Go Set a Watchman changed the framing of Atticus, allowing for a more

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,480
complete picture of the worldview of white landowners in the South, even the nicest ones.

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,120
Atticus wasn't an activist, he wasn't terribly concerned with the plight of black Americans

21
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,560
in the Jim Crow South.

22
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,960
He was just a really good lawyer who got appointed this guy's public defender, and he didn't

23
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,840
want to lose a case.

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,000
That Go Set a Watchman brought Atticus Finch, the moral pillar of American literature, down

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,920
to the level of flawed human was heresy to some.

26
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,600
Atticus was integral to the childhoods of so many.

27
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Why?

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,880
Why add this unasked-for perspective?

29
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,160
Why did you ruin Atticus, Harper Lee?

30
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,240
Why did you do it?

31
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,220
And I get that you're wondering why in an episode about The Hobbit the intro is about

32
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,380
Harper Lee and Go Set a Watchman.

33
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,220
Well, we'll get to that.

34
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,220
But first...

35
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:10,500
The Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship of the Ring is so good it makes me angry.

36
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,540
I am a certain to the secret fire, wielder of the flame of our door.

37
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,580
Like this was lightning in a bottle.

38
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,180
We will never see anything like this again.

39
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,340
This was back when franchises were a gamble, and Fellowship had a massive gun to its head

40
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,540
to do well or sink not only the rest of the franchise but also everyone involved's career.

41
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,100
It had to be great.

42
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,480
And the result was so tight and streamlined that not only did it become one of the most

43
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,940
lucrative trilogies in film history, it changed film itself.

44
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:50,300
Eleven years passed, and the Lord of the Rings film still elicited positive feelings, mostly.

45
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:57,320
In came The Hobbit trilogy.

46
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,620
At the time, consensus was that these movies were, at best, a mediocre bloated mess with

47
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,980
some enjoyable moments.

48
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,140
Having as intimate a knowledge as I did with the source material and the first film trilogy,

49
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,700
I was pretty disillusioned from the get-go, bored to death by the first one and by that

50
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,700
point already tapped out, seeing the second one in theaters only out of a morbid sense

51
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,420
of obligation and not bothering at all with the third film.

52
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,620
But The Lord of the Rings came out at a particularly formative time in my development.

53
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,540
I said back in 2012 that it was the first film trilogy that got me actively interested

54
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,980
in filmmaking, and that is true, but that in itself is a form of bias.

55
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,460
I wanted The Hobbit to make me feel like The Lord of the Rings did when I was a kid, and

56
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,100
it didn't, so I hated it.

57
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,460
Why does it hurt so much?

58
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,460
Because it was real.

59
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,660
It's been nearly seventeen years since Fellowship and six years since the release of the first

60
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,900
Hobbit film.

61
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,780
So maybe now is the time to re-examine The Hobbit.

62
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,220
You cannot disentangle it from The Lord of the Rings.

63
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,260
The film itself doesn't want you to.

64
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,220
But maybe I was judging The Hobbit for what it wasn't, rather than what it was.

65
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,080
So let's re-examine The Hobbit.

66
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,660
Let's try and give it a fair shake.

67
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07,020
Darr, why are there dwarves climbing out of our toilet?

68
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,020
You are a coward.

69
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,020
Cowards?

70
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,220
Not every man's brave enough to wear a coal seat.

71
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:21,660
If that's even possible.

72
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,300
The Hobbit trilogy was released between 2012 and 2014 under the subtitles An Unexpected

73
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,980
Journey, The Desolation of Smaug, and The Battle of Five Armies.

74
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,500
The creative team behind The Hobbit is almost uniformly the same as that from The Lord of

75
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,100
the Rings, with one curious addition.

76
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:42,320
For better or worse, you're as known for the movie you didn't do, The Hobbit, as the

77
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,460
ones that you did.

78
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,460
We'll get to that.

79
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,700
A huge chunk of the cast return to reprise their roles from Lord of the Rings, most notably

80
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:54,140
Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Andy Serkis as Gollum, and Hugo Weaving as Elrond, and adding in

81
00:04:54,140 --> 00:05:00,060
not-in-the-Hobbit-rings characters such as Legolas, Saruman, Galadriel, and even Frodo.

82
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,440
And Radagast is here, too.

83
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,140
But that is not to imply that none of the new elements for The Hobbit were bad.

84
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,380
Far from it, some of them were inspired.

85
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,420
Martin Freeman as Bilbo is pitch-perfect casting.

86
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,420
Incineration.

87
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,700
Freeman has spent much of his entire career since the original Office playing the put-upon

88
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:25,660
everyman and that layer of wit combined with his innate sincerity works really well here.

89
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,820
The opening scene with Gandalf and Bilbo, after roughly 20 minutes of prologue anyway,

90
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,660
is almost verbatim from the book.

91
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,920
McKellen perfectly bridges the whimsical, mercurial, difficult Gandalf of The Hobbit

92
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,860
with the serious business Gandalf of rings.

93
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,100
You know my name, although you don't remember I belong to it.

94
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,100
I'm Gandalf.

95
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,100
And Gandalf means...

96
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,100
me.

97
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,900
There are also some story changes that improve the overall film.

98
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,780
For instance, having the choice to go on the adventure would be Bilbo's idea, rather than

99
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,900
Gandalf effectively forcing him into it.

100
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,340
I'm going on an adventure!

101
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,340
Benedict Cumberbatch's Smaug is honestly one of his career highlights.

102
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,340
I smell you.

103
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,340
I hear your breath.

104
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:16,340
And I wish I had as much fun at anything in my life as Cumberbatch does playing Smaug.

105
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,140
How do you choose to die?

106
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,740
The scene where Bilbo and Smaug talk for the first time, at least until it starts going

107
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,340
on for way too long, ranks alongside any of the best scenes from Rings.

108
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,940
And do you now?

109
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,340
Adding in small details like Smaug being able to see Bilbo, which he couldn't in the book,

110
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,740
is another positive change that just adds more drama to the scene.

111
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,020
Even Lee Pace as Thranduil brings a sort of otherworldly dimension to a character in the

112
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,220
book who is just, you know, some greedy jerk.

113
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,780
It was also necessary to develop Bard as a character before he kills Smaug.

114
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,660
In the book he's just an ascended extra with no lines before he shows up with his bow to

115
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,660
kill the dragon.

116
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,740
There are dozens more great details I could go into.

117
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,660
The elves only eating, like, kale, the dwarves being horrified by that.

118
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,660
Try it.

119
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,660
Just a mouthful.

120
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,440
I don't like green food.

121
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,980
Even Gimli's gratuitous cameo doesn't bother me.

122
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,220
It is this horrid creature, the goblin mutant.

123
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,180
That's my wee lad, Gimli.

124
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,140
The problem with The Hobbit isn't the absence of good.

125
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,780
Good in it exists.

126
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,840
It is more the whole weighing less than the sum of its parts.

127
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,620
These positive elements are often used as refutations of criticism of The Hobbit.

128
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:36,140
But to say that the presence of good outweighs the pacing issues, the unnecessary plot cul-de-sacs,

129
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,340
the terrible visual effects, the clumsy integration of irrelevant plot points...

130
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,340
Sorry.

131
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:47,340
Yeah, I, uh, I'm starting to remember why these movies frustrated me so much.

132
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,660
The Hobbit was published 20 years before The Lord of the Rings was published, and itself

133
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,340
had to be reissued to fit with the new version of Middle-earth Tolkien created, and even

134
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,940
still is tonally a completely different animal from The Lord of the Rings.

135
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,880
Meanwhile, The Hobbit movies have the opposite problem, billed as prequels to movies that

136
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,660
had come out a decade prior.

137
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,060
Add into this the popularity of all parties involved.

138
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,220
The Hobbit is one of the best-selling books of all time, at over 100 million copies, shy

139
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,620
of Lord of the Rings' 150-odd million copies.

140
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,960
So on the one hand, the filmmakers are tasked with creating faithful adaptations of one

141
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,940
of the best-selling books of all time.

142
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,320
On the other hand, the filmmakers are tasked with creating prequels to one of the best-selling

143
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,860
film trilogies of all time.

144
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,940
So roadblock number one, The Lord of the Rings was written as a sequel to The Hobbit.

145
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,320
The Hobbit was not written as a prequel to Lord of the Rings.

146
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,660
And we have to be faithful to both, but in publication order, the prequel was not a prequel.

147
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,860
It wasn't even originally planned to have any sequels, and as a consequence, the central

148
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,620
conflict of The Hobbit, dwarves finding a treasure and then a bunch of people fighting

149
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,460
over it, has nothing to do with the central conflict of The Lord of the Rings, which is

150
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,660
that the magic ring Bilbo found on his adventure oops it's evil and will destroy the world.

151
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,220
Compare this with the Star Wars prequels, which, love them or hate them,

152
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,180
YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE!

153
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,780
their central conflicts do directly set up the plots of the original Star Wars trilogy.

154
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:13,620
How the Empire formed, how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader, what the Clone Wars were,

155
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,620
the gang's all here.

156
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,040
The Hobbit doesn't really work as a prequel to The Lord of the Rings because neither the

157
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,180
conflict nor the tone flow into it.

158
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,560
If they really wanted to do a prequel to The Lord of the Rings, one that set up the universe,

159
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,560
how the magic rings worked, how they came into existence, who Sauron is and where he

160
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,360
came from, why he had control over the rings of power, the real prequel to The Lord of

161
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,760
the Rings with a similar epic tone was The Silmarillion.

162
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,560
Said Tolkien himself of The Lord of the Rings in a letter to his publisher, it's not really

163
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,540
a sequel to The Hobbit, but to The Silmarillion.

164
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,200
But that wasn't The Lord of the Rings prequel anyone wanted.

165
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,400
We ain't gonna adapt no dense, myth-heavy Silmarillion with its paltry less than a million

166
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
copies sold.

167
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,060
Oh no, precious.

168
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:00,440
We wanted The Hobbit.

169
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,040
The truth is, The Hobbit existing in the same universe and having to logically progress

170
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,040
into The Lord of the Rings presented huge problems for Tolkien, and a lot of what we

171
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,320
know as The Hobbit wasn't there in the original publication.

172
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,960
Tolkien made dozens of tiny changes for the 1951 reissue of The Hobbit preceding the original

173
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,580
printing of The Lord of the Rings, but the biggest change was an almost total rewrite

174
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,780
of Riddles in the Dark.

175
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,640
In the original version, Gollum was a much more quirky, less sinister character, and

176
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,380
he gave Bilbo the Ring as a gift when Bilbo won the riddle contest.

177
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,340
The One Ring was not yet The One Ring, it was just a magic ring that would be really

178
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,340
useful.

179
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,460
A nice magic ring, but there was no intent to flow into something more epic.

180
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,680
The necromancer that Gandalf uses as an excuse to leave the dwarves at Mirkwood, we find

181
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,120
out in The Lord of the Rings that that was Sauron the whole time, and oh boy oh boy do

182
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,900
they play that up in The Hobbit movies.

183
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,200
This character, of course, was not originally intended to be Sauron.

184
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,160
The necromancer, according to Tolkien, was hardly more than to provide a reason for Gandalf

185
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,920
going away and leaving Bilbo and the dwarves to fend for themselves, which was necessary

186
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,120
for the tale.

187
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,940
So I get why people defend that decision on the part of the filmmakers to include Sauron,

188
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:13,720
but to state that that was Tolkien's original intent, that's pretty disingenuous.

189
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,520
But the biggest problem was in keeping the same plot while making The Hobbit, also a

190
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,740
tonal prequel to The Lord of the Rings.

191
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,860
The Hobbit, the novel, has a wildly different tone from The Lord of the Rings.

192
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,520
The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings take place in the same universe, but only nominally.

193
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,700
Many if not most of the details of the history of Middle Earth existed only in sketch form,

194
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,320
and Tolkien's beloved Silmarillion, which, yes, he'd started even before The Hobbit

195
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,760
was published, would change dramatically as Tolkien developed The Lord of the Rings.

196
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,320
But when The Hobbit was a success and Tolkien's publisher asked for a sequel, Tolkien didn't

197
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,080
really know where he wanted to go with it.

198
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,340
It took him several years to realize that the world of The Hobbit had effectively grown

199
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:52,680
up when his children did, and he wanted to write an epic fantasy for adults.

200
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,480
Because The Lord of the Rings both didn't hit the original target audience, children,

201
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,160
but then again it did.

202
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,000
Part of the reason why The Lord of the Rings feels more grown up is because his kids, and

203
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,440
by extension the original kids who read it when it was published, were growing up with

204
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,480
the stories, and Tolkien's oldest son Christopher was integral to the creation of the book.

205
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,000
The Hobbit was a children's story written before any serious publisher would dare entertain

206
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,440
the idea of epic fantasy literature for adults.

207
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,560
It was published at a time where fantasy was either Le Petit Prance or Beowulf, and The

208
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,520
Lord of the Rings, even twenty years later, was kind of a huge gamble, one that paid off

209
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,480
right away and has never been out of print since.

210
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,440
Tolkien wrote to a fan in 1955,

211
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,600
It remains an unfailing delight to me to find my own belief justified, that the fairy story

212
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,900
is really an adult genre, and one for which a starving audience exists.

213
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,120
Both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were stories for Tolkien's children, but

214
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,400
at different stages of life.

215
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,960
So, you can either make a faithful adaptation of The Hobbit, one that is fun and clever

216
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,340
and matches the child-like tone of the books, which were designed to be read aloud at storytime

217
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:56,120
and even include quick asides for the reader, or you can make three three-hour prequels

218
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,320
to Lord of the Rings that match the tone and epic scope of The Lord of the Rings.

219
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,080
But they can't be the same thing.

220
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,860
The Hobbit is about 95,000 words long, about 5,000 words shorter than the first Hunger

221
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,860
Games book, and about 12,000 words longer than the first Harry Potter book.

222
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,200
To compare, the Fellowship of the Ring alone is nearly twice that length at 177,000 words,

223
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,840
with the entirety of The Lord of the Rings cashing in at about 1.5 Games of Thrones,

224
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,680
and that doesn't even include the appendices.

225
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,720
This is not to say that The Hobbit needed to be the same length as the first Hunger

226
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,000
Games movie in order not to feel flabby.

227
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,640
The Hobbit has an extremely minimalistic style for all that goes down in it, compared with

228
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,760
the florid Lord of the Rings with its extreme attention to detail.

229
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,260
Adapting The Hobbit as it is without adding any pauses for character development or pacing

230
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,120
or worldbuilding would have made a film that felt incredibly rushed.

231
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,500
Even though the book is Hunger Games short, a lot more goes down in it, and it would feel

232
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,580
way too rushed as a 90-minute movie, or even one three-hour movie.

233
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,600
So I think the initial pitch of two two-hour movies directed by Guillermo del Toro could

234
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,080
have led to the creation of a great, original, memorable product, both in the spirit of the

235
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,440
original novel, yet distinct from the Lord of the Rings film trilogy.

236
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,960
Why does it hurt so much?

237
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:14,280
Because it was real.

238
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:22,160
Maybe they got that version of the Berenstain universe.

239
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,060
To explore the challenges of adapting The Hobbit, first we must examine the structure.

240
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,480
It has a beginning, middle, and end, kinda.

241
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,720
But it doesn't really have the structure of a Hollywood screenplay, let alone three

242
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,740
Hollywood screenplays.

243
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,880
Compared to The Fellowship of the Ring, the book doesn't really have a three-act structure,

244
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,360
per se, but without changing much, the film gets rid of the Tom Bombadil stuff.

245
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,360
Good call, that.

246
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,120
Has the end of Act 1 as Frodo leaving the Shire, and also has a really long Act 2, with

247
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,720
the midpoint being Frodo taking the ring to Mordor, and Act 3 comprising a big action

248
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,560
scene where Frodo escapes while Aragorn and the others fight the Uruk-hai, and Boromir

249
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,220
gets a much more emotional death than he does in the book.

250
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,120
Not a whole lot of rearranging needed to turn this into a three-act Hollywood structure.

251
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,960
But The Hobbit is way more episodic, with the individual adventures rarely changing

252
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,960
the quest.

253
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,480
The book pulls a great deal from English folktales, fairy stories, epics, and Norse poems like

254
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,840
Beowulf, so it includes elements that might otherwise feel out of place in a novel because

255
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,400
of the story's basis.

256
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,200
The points that feel out of nowhere are anticlimactic, like ascended extra bard killing the dragon

257
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,240
instead of Bilbo or the dwarves, or Smaug having one weakness is very rooted in mythology

258
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,320
and folk stories, Fafnir, Beowulf, Odysseus.

259
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,080
And as it ends up in the movies, boy is it anticlimactic.

260
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,700
This did not need to be so hideously anticlimactic, except for the way that they structured it.

261
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,880
The third movie begins with the burning of Laketown, and Smaug dies before the opening

262
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
title.

263
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,540
This, like so many things, is a consequence of restructuring.

264
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:59,760
Smaug's death should have been the midpoint of the second film, not the, um, prologue

265
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,760
to the third?

266
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,340
The structure of The Hobbit is episodic and meandering, not a lot of build like we see

267
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,660
in The Lord of the Rings.

268
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,020
Each chapter is a mini-adventure in which Bilbo either learns something, gets something,

269
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,180
or earns respect.

270
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,620
It is effectively designed to be read by adults, two children, one chapter per night.

271
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,340
Leonard Nimoy's Ode to Bilbo Bagginsong captures this pretty well.

272
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,660
The decision to split this book into three makes this into even more of a problem because

273
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:39,180
we need to split this tiny book into Act 1, Act 2, and Act 3 three times.

274
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,860
This results in adding mini-climaxes that don't go anywhere, character moments that

275
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,940
come either too early or too late, and several elements that just don't translate.

276
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,380
Bilbo has nothing to do during the Battle of Five Armies and is unconscious for most

277
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,380
of it.

278
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,940
This isn't so much a problem in the book as the Battle of Five Armies takes up all

279
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,580
of like half a chapter, but they went and made it take two hours of a two-hour-and-forty-four-minute

280
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,780
movie that relegates Bilbo into a minor role and most of the dwarves as glorified extras.

281
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,060
But the worst problems don't arise because the book was a challenge to adapt.

282
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,460
There was a good movie in this mess, if you edit out, like, half of it.

283
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,860
It's the horrible structure problems that arise from the decision to split two films

284
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:18,020
into three a matter of months before the first film was set to be released.

285
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,100
So character beats need to be shuffled around not only according to the needs of adaptation,

286
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,940
but according to the needs of film structures.

287
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:28,140
So this moment, where Thorin finally respects Bilbo, happens here.

288
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,260
I have never been so wrong in all my life.

289
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,460
Rather than after Bilbo frees the dwarves in the barrels, where it was likely originally

290
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,860
intended to have happened and where it makes more sense to have happened, because Bilbo

291
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,080
had repeatedly proven himself to Thorin by that point.

292
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,900
But in the final version, where Thorin has to respect Bilbo before the eagles rescue

293
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,540
them, the one action Bilbo gets is to bum-rush an orc.

294
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,220
Like a linebacker.

295
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,340
And it makes that plot point weaker because Bilbo freeing the dwarves through his cunning

296
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,180
and magic ring is what makes him valuable to the party.

297
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,900
He doesn't think like them, and his wits are his greatest asset.

298
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,700
So his prove-myself-to-Thorin moment being, like, a football tackle just makes a rushed

299
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,340
moment all the weaker.

300
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,140
Bilbo's not a linebacker.

301
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,460
He's a hobbit.

302
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,640
He's THE hobbit.

303
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,940
And now Bilbo and Thorin's relationship has zero development throughout movie two.

304
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,340
It's just kind of at a par, and then they have their falling out in three.

305
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:27,460
When you decided to make three instead of two movies, isn't it hard to split in story

306
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,740
arc from two into three?

307
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,980
Well, it was actually better.

308
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,140
I mean, we made that decision because it was going to be, we felt it was going to be a

309
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,140
better shape.

310
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,140
I mean, it was our decision.

311
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,140
It wasn't a studio decision.

312
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,140
Really?

313
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,140
Really?

314
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,380
I find that very hard to believe.

315
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:50,020
The original first film was set to end once the party got to either Erebor or Laketown.

316
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:54,240
Part two would have been getting into Erebor, everything with Smaug, and then Five Armies.

317
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,660
So the nonsense climaxes of movies one and two, which involves so much...

318
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,660
What?

319
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,660
What?

320
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:06,180
Our dwarves' heat was...

321
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,220
Middle doesn't...

322
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,220
What?

323
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,220
What?

324
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,900
The need for these contrived climaxes that add nothing to the overall narrative directly

325
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,020
trace back to that 11th hour decision to turn two movies into three, because all movies

326
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,020
are trilogies now.

327
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,020
Is this two or three?

328
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,020
Oh, it's three.

329
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,020
Is this three?

330
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,020
Yeah.

331
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,020
It's three.

332
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,020
There you go.

333
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,340
It's that easy to be confused.

334
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,420
And then there was the stuff they added.

335
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,420
Oh, and the stuff they added.

336
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,660
Aren't you going to search me?

337
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,660
I could have anything down my trousers.

338
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,860
Again, to compare to The Lord of the Rings, because we have to, they cut just as much

339
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,260
out of the novels as they added into the films, and most of what they added was some expansion

340
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,940
on material from the appendices, most notably Aragorn and Arwen.

341
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,140
At the front, when Arwen rescues Frodo, is more of a change rather than an addition,

342
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,060
and again a positive one in my opinion.

343
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:01,180
In the book, Frodo is rescued by a character who never appears again, so making it Aragorn's

344
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,140
one true love makes that plot point stronger.

345
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,100
In The Two Towers, they also added a warg battle and Aragorn getting separated, and

346
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,260
a bunch of scenes with Arwen and Arwen leaving and then coming back.

347
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,900
Frodo and Sam have a tiff in The Return of the King, which, you know, I'm not a fan of,

348
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,780
but I guess I get why they got it.

349
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,920
Gollum framing Sam, which is kind of dumb, but okay.

350
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,100
And then there's the scene at Asgiliath at the end of Two Towers that gives Frodo and

351
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,940
Sam a climax in the second movie, and those are kind of like the only major additions.

352
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,620
They cut out a few chapters, like Tom Bombadil and The Scouring of the Shire entirely, but

353
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,540
they didn't add that much in the grand scheme.

354
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,500
Here's some of the stuff they added to The Hobbit.

355
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:50,780
The White Council, this orc mini-boss who's in all three films, fighting dragon priests,

356
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:57,140
Evangeline Lily, Legolas fighting, that endlessly long barrel-reverchase scene between orcs

357
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:02,980
and elves, and we're fighting, Kili is hot and he's in love, Gandalf and Galadriel...

358
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,980
huh?

359
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,980
Kill me, kill me, Ronin.

360
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:16,440
Legolas fighting, Radagast the Brown, he's got poop on his head, useless framing device,

361
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:22,220
the entire climax of Desolation, Evangeline Lily is in a love triangle, Legolas is sooooo

362
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,980
cool, wow this framing device sure is going on forever, Bilbo linebacker, did they fuck?

363
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:33,340
Side quest to Angmar that goes nowhere, Stephen Fry's horrible henchmen, what is happening?

364
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:38,320
On-screen White Council scene, God, Alfred is awful, look at Legolas go, Bard the Bowman

365
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:45,220
has a family now, Bjorn needed a bare chase scene, come with me, my lady, Gandalf, she's

366
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:51,780
married, gratuitous Elijah Wood cameo, true love, and that's like not even half of it.

367
00:21:51,780 --> 00:22:00,260
This ties in with other adaptational problems, namely the problem of The Hobbit being so

368
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:05,340
different and more childlike, read cartoonish, in tone than the more gritty adult Lord of

369
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,340
the Rings.

370
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,480
First, the Battle of Five Armies, just all of it.

371
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,140
It takes up about half a chapter and Bilbo is unconscious, so of course this needed to

372
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,200
be expanded, but the result is longer than the Battle of Helm's Deep, which itself started

373
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
to drag in the run-up.

374
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,780
I do not trust a hope.

375
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,780
There is no hope.

376
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,860
There is still hope.

377
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,860
We get it.

378
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,780
They say that it is hopeless.

379
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,120
We get it.

380
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,860
Another consequence of splitting two movies into three is that movie two needs a climax

381
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:35,580
now, and that is how we got the escape from Smaug scene and the heat-resistant dwarves.

382
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,500
It adds a gratuitous action scene that goes on forever, but adds absolutely nothing to

383
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,500
the narrative plot-wise.

384
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,380
Smaug was going to go destroy Lake Town either way, so this action scene is bereft of tension

385
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,680
in every regard.

386
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,080
This is a problem in a lot of recent films.

387
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,000
Studio will mandate X number of action scenes, but these action scenes either have no tension,

388
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,600
either in the macro sense of how they advance the plot, or in the momentary sense of whether

389
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,600
the characters get through or not, and whether we, the audience, care.

390
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,520
This is particularly problematic in that the dwarves seem utterly resistant to dragon fire

391
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,240
and to heat in general.

392
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,360
So there is no physical danger to them, so...

393
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,360
Why...

394
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,360
Thorin?

395
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,080
Thorin, you know metal is a conductor, right?

396
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,440
There is a similar problem in the scene where the dwarves escape the elves.

397
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,040
It has a plot-related tension of escape, but the action is so absurd that you can't really

398
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,680
feel for these guys.

399
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,700
They appear to be made of rubber.

400
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,960
They don't seem to have any mortality.

401
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,080
Healy gets shot by an arrow, and that's sad and hurts him.

402
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:41,680
But meanwhile, this is happening.

403
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,000
The cartoons barrel boing boing, all in the same scene.

404
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,920
Are these guys impervious or not?

405
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,880
And if they are impervious, then where's the tension?

406
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,920
And then there was the storm giants.

407
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,400
This is no thunderstorm.

408
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,320
It's a thunder battle.

409
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,160
Oh, the storm giants.

410
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,880
So like Five Armies takes up about half a chapter, the storm giants, a five minute scene,

411
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,240
takes up about half a sentence.

412
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,460
Here's the sentence.

413
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,340
And according to The Annotated Hobbit, most Tolkien scholars don't think of storm giants

414
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:16,740
as like, alternate fantasy creatures that we haven't seen yet.

415
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,400
They're, you know, they're just trolls.

416
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,260
Cave trolls, troll trolls, trolls that like to play in the rain and throw rocks.

417
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:28,580
You know, the fun kind of troll, not the internet kind.

418
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,900
But speaking of cave troll, there is a scene in Fellowship that this reminds me of.

419
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,700
We're in the mines of Moria, we've just found out how Balin and all of the dwarves there

420
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,700
died.

421
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:44,340
And then Pippin inadvertently causes an extended action scene that goes on for about 20 minutes

422
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,620
and ends with Gandalf's death.

423
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,460
You see what I mean about action scenes should advance the plot?

424
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,060
Anyway.

425
00:24:51,060 --> 00:25:04,620
Before this scene, we've set up the Mithril armor, which Bilbo got from Thorin and the

426
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,460
Hobbit and Gibbs to Frodo.

427
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,740
During the scene, Frodo gets stabbed by the troll.

428
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:15,080
Everyone's like, oh no, he dead, but ah wait, remember that Mithril armor.

429
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,940
So with the storm giant scene, again we're straining believability by oscillating between

430
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:24,020
the mortal, Bilbo hanging from a ledge and needing a rescue, and the cartoonish, literally

431
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:30,940
everything else in the scene.

432
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,480
It culminates in this moment, they're on the knee of a giant who ostensibly smashes

433
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,800
them into the side of a cliff, but no, they're fine.

434
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:48,940
See they're fine, whatever, let's go.

435
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,620
Unlike the troll scene in Fellowship, where Frodo reveals the Mithril armor, there is

436
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,800
no payoff here.

437
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,160
No one's skill that had been set up in an earlier scene saves them, it's just a wildly

438
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,840
unlikely coincidence that they survive.

439
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,200
Action that goes nowhere and advances nothing.

440
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,360
So unlike with Rings, where we have a constant sense of mortality and the physical pain these

441
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:13,000
characters are going through, in The Hobbit it's like action figures being smashed together.

442
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,040
There's never any real sense of danger.

443
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,620
When they get caught by goblins, Gandalf shows up and they cut through them like butter.

444
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,000
And to be clear, this is not about knowing what the outcome of the scene is just because

445
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,040
you've read the book.

446
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,100
You can still feel tension as an audience member, even if you already know what the

447
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,920
outcome of the scene is.

448
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,000
And there's nothing wrong with a playful cartoony tone in and of itself, but it's

449
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,200
really hard to include that in a narrative that also has these dramatic moments of physical

450
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,360
danger.

451
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:44,440
If this doesn't kill them, and that doesn't kill them, and that doesn't kill them, then

452
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,380
what would?

453
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,080
In order to maintain tension, the rules of the universe have to be consistent, and we

454
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,700
need to believe that these characters are in danger.

455
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,720
It goes without saying Bilbo and Gandalf surviving, for instance, is a foregone conclusion that

456
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,840
can't be helped.

457
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,040
But there are ways to build tension in an already popular story.

458
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,000
Fellowship of the Ring takes a character like Boromir, and it fleshes him out with an understandable

459
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,960
personal conflict and friendship with the hobbits, so that when he does die, it feels

460
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,320
way more upsetting and meaningful and, well, human than it did in the book.

461
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,640
Tolkien didn't really care about Boromir as a character, but Jackson and his co-writers

462
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,000
keyed into his humanity, and the result is one of the strongest, most memorable performances

463
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,540
in all three films.

464
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:28,340
The entire character of Boromir is an excellent example of the way movies can improve upon

465
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,340
their source material.

466
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,100
Believe it.

467
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,700
It is over.

468
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,100
But these are all style choices.

469
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,460
To me, the biggest issue with the hobbit movies was instead of letting the movies be The Hobbit,

470
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,900
the biggest mess in all three films is the attempt to make the central conflict in The

471
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,420
Hobbit directly tied in with the central conflict of The Lord of the Rings.

472
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:54,540
Because it just isn't, except maybe in that really, really distant Silmarillion way where

473
00:27:54,540 --> 00:28:00,380
all bad things like dragons and orcs, et cetera, all originate from the same bad one dude.

474
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:04,940
By the way, if you want to go down a fun rabbit hole, Google image search Sauron Melkor fan

475
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,940
art.

476
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,940
It is a trip.

477
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,580
Even in Tolkien's awkward retrofit where we find out that the necromancer was Sauron

478
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:13,580
the whole time, it's almost completely irrelevant to the conflict in The Hobbit.

479
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:17,300
Gandalf mentions that Sauron is over here somewhere in the Fellowship of the Ring, but

480
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,940
it doesn't really mean anything to either narrative except for helping Gandalf put two

481
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,420
and two together when Bilbo starts acting weird.

482
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:30,580
So their solution was to double down on what was, even to Tolkien, kind of a contrived

483
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:37,140
throwaway line to get Gandalf out of the picture.

484
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,440
It works in a children's story, but when you take a plot device to get Gandalf away

485
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:49,700
from the party and then try to develop it into this lush world building, still there

486
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,140
had to be a better way to make this work.

487
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,700
Ultimately, there is a rising darkness in the form of the goblins and the dragons and

488
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,500
the whole thrust of the battle at the end is everyone fighting each other over a petty

489
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,860
treasure when there is a real existential threat to all of them.

490
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:09,340
See, the reveal of the necromancer's identity doesn't actually matter in this story because

491
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,700
he doesn't really do anything.

492
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,320
This only matters to the audience who recognizes this character from Lord of the Rings.

493
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,240
What it is in the book is Gandalf's discovery of the orc army, which we later find out is

494
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,960
commanded by Sauron.

495
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,680
If we wanted to keep Sauron here, sure, have it be that angle.

496
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:30,160
But the problem is they're already being pursued by orcs from the minute go, way before

497
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,400
we learn that the necromancer is Sauron.

498
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,080
A different orc army, not to be confused with this orc army, you know, the one with the

499
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,860
worms of Arrakis.

500
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,440
But as it is in the final product, the reveal of Sauron is completely meaningless.

501
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,200
But it could have flown in better thematically into the Lord of the Rings.

502
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,880
Darkness rising, stop fighting over stupid shit y'all, it's only gonna get worse.

503
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,300
More focus is placed on shoehorning in these plot elements and characters from rings, which

504
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,040
makes it just feel flabby and awkward.

505
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,960
There's one bit in the appendices with Christopher Lee that breaks my heart a little bit.

506
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:07,900
If it means something in the story, and it's what the director wants.

507
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,880
So you're using the staff in the hand like, so yep, yep, perfect.

508
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:17,800
And the audience remembers it, that's what it's all about.

509
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,600
Lee and Jackson kind of parted on bad terms after the Lord of the Rings, since Sauron's

510
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,120
conclusion was cut from Return of the King in the theatrical cut.

511
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,920
But he is here for this.

512
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,320
And he's excited to be here.

513
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,640
And he loves this idea of playing pre-corruption Sauron and going after Sauron.

514
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,280
Leave Sauron to me.

515
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,320
One of the very few good moments in the Battle of Five Armies.

516
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:44,200
Leave Sauron to me.

517
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,200
And he means it.

518
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,960
And this just makes me sad.

519
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:53,280
Because that idea, that angle, that passion that Lee has, in a scene that on the whole

520
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:59,960
is so unnecessary and confusing and goofy and Gandalf and Galadriel, what are you doing?

521
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,720
Perhaps in another life, if only wizards and elves could procreate.

522
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,680
It's just wasted here.

523
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,480
And that, I think, is the essence of these movies.

524
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,940
Moments of brilliance wasted in a product that, on the whole, tries to have it all ways

525
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,260
and in the process just pulls itself apart at the seams.

526
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:21,460
But there's one element in particular, a small one, but to me it encapsulates the clumsily

527
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,060
slapped together new ending to movie one.

528
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:27,660
It's not the Bilbo bum rush, but this right here.

529
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,100
Did you catch it?

530
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,100
Here, I'll play it again.

531
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:49,540
That's...

532
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,620
That's the Ringwraith theme.

533
00:31:52,620 --> 00:32:06,740
Like, you know, things mean things.

534
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,140
Musical motifs especially mean things.

535
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,940
That wasn't Sauron's theme, it wasn't Gollum's theme.

536
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,620
That was, specifically, the Ringwraith theme from Fellowship.

537
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:20,620
I know you know this, Howard Shore, Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens, all of whom put

538
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,080
so much thought and effort into The Lord of the Rings.

539
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,740
You explained it to me back in 2001.

540
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:29,840
Revelation of the Ringwraiths is a poem that Philippa Boyens wrote, because in the case

541
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:40,220
of this it was translated into Andunaic, which was the ancient speech of man.

542
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,260
And here you are, just slapping on whatever ominous-sounding music, because you decided

543
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:48,060
it should be three films in October, and it's being released in December, and Howard Shore

544
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:54,020
didn't have time to compose something new.

545
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,980
I get that they didn't have the time that they had for Rings, and Jackson didn't really

546
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,980
want to direct, and he was tapped out and exhausted the whole time.

547
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,740
But it really shows.

548
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:06,380
So maybe it isn't just my nostalgia that it didn't do it for me the way The Lord of the

549
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,380
Rings did.

550
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:11,980
There's just so much that doesn't work here, and it's pretty easy to pinpoint.

551
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,260
The question is, why?

552
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,260
It isn't like some outside studio hack swooped in and took over.

553
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:21,220
The Hobbit has almost entirely the same creative team and the same cast as The Lord of the

554
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,220
Rings.

555
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:27,980
We are very much going to be the same storytellers making this sort of six series story, six

556
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,980
six film series.

557
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:33,640
There are some genuinely great creative choices unique to this trilogy, and the new cast is

558
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,960
both brilliant and distinct from the cast of The Lord of the Rings, when they aren't

559
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,560
characters from The Lord of the Rings that are awkwardly shoehorned in, anyway.

560
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,000
And yet, I kind of long for death.

561
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,920
I recall looking back at the extended DVDs of The Lord of the Rings, how watching all

562
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:52,520
those extras inspired interest and passion in the filmmaking process and added an extra

563
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:57,040
layer of enjoyment to the films themselves, seeing how by no means no, the making of The

564
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,840
Lord of the Rings was not easy, but everyone was here for it.

565
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,000
And that passion comes through in the final product.

566
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,760
And I look at The Hobbit and I'm just, I'm just tired.

567
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,520
Like I see these extra features, the care and pain taken to create what was brought

568
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:17,580
to the screen, that each movie has ten hours of extras, and I'm just like, I don't care.

569
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:21,360
And I find myself struggling to remember what moved me so deeply about The Lord of the Rings

570
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,020
in the first place if so many of the elements are going to affect the same.

571
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,220
These movies just, they make me feel drained.

572
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:31,380
I don't hate them, I just, I feel nothing.

573
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:35,460
And I find myself unable to remember why I was so passionate about The Lord of the Rings

574
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,700
and the works of Tolkien in the first place.

575
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:47,620
Is there a way to un-grow up, be like young Scout Finch, see through that naive worldview

576
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:52,540
where we can look up to the things that we loved as kids and absolutes?

577
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,540
Can you ever really go home again?

578
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:59,020
Or must we all, like Frodo, eventually go into the West?

579
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:11,500
The reason why some of us respond so emotionally to media is because media helped shape us as kids.

580
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,220
We all have a first love in movies, and The Lord of the Rings was one of mine.

581
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:20,580
So no matter how, quote, mature, end quote, you become in your consumption of media, there's

582
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,380
always going to be some part of you that desires not to see your childhood passions

583
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:29,700
through the eyes of an adult, but instead to recapture what ignited our passions as kids.

584
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:35,700
But maybe, now that I'm an adult with an expendable income, I can make a journey to find the answers

585
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,700
to my questions, and see if perhaps that magic can be recaptured.

586
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,700
Lindsay, wait!

587
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:59,580
Go back, Nilla!

588
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:02,580
I'm going to New Zealand alone!

589
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,580
Of course you are!

590
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,580
And I'm coming with you!

591
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,580
Thanks for watching!
