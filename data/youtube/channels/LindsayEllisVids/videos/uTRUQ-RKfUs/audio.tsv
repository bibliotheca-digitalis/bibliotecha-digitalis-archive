0	13720	In mid-2015, less than a year before her death, author Harper Lee published her second novel,
13720	18480	Go Set a Watchman, a sequel to her first and only other published novel, 1960's To Kill
18480	19480	a Mockingbird.
19480	23920	Though the book was published 55 years after To Kill a Mockingbird, it is generally accepted
23920	29640	now that Go Set a Watchman was actually written concurrent to or even before To Kill a Mockingbird,
29640	33200	and in the process of writing To Kill a Mockingbird, rather than encouraging her to create the
33200	37680	entire omnibus, the publisher urged Lee to focus on the childhood aspect, and not on
37680	41740	Scout becoming an adult and growing into a more complete understanding of who her father,
41740	43280	Atticus Finch, was.
43280	47500	Generations of people had grown up with Atticus Finch, played with such power and pathos by
47500	53100	Gregory Peck in the 1962 film adaptation, only to then have the author swoop in 55 years
53100	56760	later and remove the halo adorning Atticus Finch.
56760	59920	There is some debate as to whether or not the publisher took advantage of Harper Lee
59920	63640	given her age and the fact that she may not have been in possession of her full faculties
63640	66880	when Go Set a Watchman was published, but it is kind of out there now that Go Set a
66880	69600	Watchman was always kind of a part of her authorial intent.
69600	73220	To Kill a Mockingbird was written from the point of view of an adult reflecting the understanding
73220	77400	of a child, but Go Set a Watchman changed the framing of Atticus, allowing for a more
77400	82480	complete picture of the worldview of white landowners in the South, even the nicest ones.
82480	86120	Atticus wasn't an activist, he wasn't terribly concerned with the plight of black Americans
86120	87560	in the Jim Crow South.
87560	91960	He was just a really good lawyer who got appointed this guy's public defender, and he didn't
91960	93840	want to lose a case.
93840	98000	That Go Set a Watchman brought Atticus Finch, the moral pillar of American literature, down
98000	100920	to the level of flawed human was heresy to some.
100920	103600	Atticus was integral to the childhoods of so many.
103600	104600	Why?
104600	106880	Why add this unasked-for perspective?
106880	109160	Why did you ruin Atticus, Harper Lee?
109160	112240	Why did you do it?
112240	115220	And I get that you're wondering why in an episode about The Hobbit the intro is about
115220	117380	Harper Lee and Go Set a Watchman.
117380	120220	Well, we'll get to that.
120220	121220	But first...
121220	130500	The Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship of the Ring is so good it makes me angry.
130500	136540	I am a certain to the secret fire, wielder of the flame of our door.
136540	138580	Like this was lightning in a bottle.
138580	141180	We will never see anything like this again.
141180	145340	This was back when franchises were a gamble, and Fellowship had a massive gun to its head
145340	150540	to do well or sink not only the rest of the franchise but also everyone involved's career.
150540	152100	It had to be great.
152100	155480	And the result was so tight and streamlined that not only did it become one of the most
155480	159940	lucrative trilogies in film history, it changed film itself.
159940	170300	Eleven years passed, and the Lord of the Rings film still elicited positive feelings, mostly.
170300	177320	In came The Hobbit trilogy.
177320	181620	At the time, consensus was that these movies were, at best, a mediocre bloated mess with
181620	182980	some enjoyable moments.
182980	187140	Having as intimate a knowledge as I did with the source material and the first film trilogy,
187140	191700	I was pretty disillusioned from the get-go, bored to death by the first one and by that
191700	195700	point already tapped out, seeing the second one in theaters only out of a morbid sense
195700	198420	of obligation and not bothering at all with the third film.
198420	202620	But The Lord of the Rings came out at a particularly formative time in my development.
202620	206540	I said back in 2012 that it was the first film trilogy that got me actively interested
206540	210980	in filmmaking, and that is true, but that in itself is a form of bias.
210980	214460	I wanted The Hobbit to make me feel like The Lord of the Rings did when I was a kid, and
214460	216100	it didn't, so I hated it.
216100	220460	Why does it hurt so much?
220460	221460	Because it was real.
221460	225660	It's been nearly seventeen years since Fellowship and six years since the release of the first
225660	226900	Hobbit film.
226900	229780	So maybe now is the time to re-examine The Hobbit.
229780	232220	You cannot disentangle it from The Lord of the Rings.
232220	234260	The film itself doesn't want you to.
234260	239220	But maybe I was judging The Hobbit for what it wasn't, rather than what it was.
239220	241080	So let's re-examine The Hobbit.
241080	242660	Let's try and give it a fair shake.
242660	247020	Darr, why are there dwarves climbing out of our toilet?
247020	248020	You are a coward.
248020	249020	Cowards?
249020	252220	Not every man's brave enough to wear a coal seat.
252220	261660	If that's even possible.
261660	266300	The Hobbit trilogy was released between 2012 and 2014 under the subtitles An Unexpected
266300	269980	Journey, The Desolation of Smaug, and The Battle of Five Armies.
269980	273500	The creative team behind The Hobbit is almost uniformly the same as that from The Lord of
273500	276100	the Rings, with one curious addition.
276100	282320	For better or worse, you're as known for the movie you didn't do, The Hobbit, as the
282320	283460	ones that you did.
283460	284460	We'll get to that.
284460	288700	A huge chunk of the cast return to reprise their roles from Lord of the Rings, most notably
288700	294140	Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Andy Serkis as Gollum, and Hugo Weaving as Elrond, and adding in
294140	300060	not-in-the-Hobbit-rings characters such as Legolas, Saruman, Galadriel, and even Frodo.
300060	301440	And Radagast is here, too.
301440	305140	But that is not to imply that none of the new elements for The Hobbit were bad.
305180	307380	Far from it, some of them were inspired.
307380	310420	Martin Freeman as Bilbo is pitch-perfect casting.
310420	311420	Incineration.
311420	315700	Freeman has spent much of his entire career since the original Office playing the put-upon
315700	325660	everyman and that layer of wit combined with his innate sincerity works really well here.
325660	330820	The opening scene with Gandalf and Bilbo, after roughly 20 minutes of prologue anyway,
330820	332660	is almost verbatim from the book.
332660	336920	McKellen perfectly bridges the whimsical, mercurial, difficult Gandalf of The Hobbit
336920	338860	with the serious business Gandalf of rings.
338860	342100	You know my name, although you don't remember I belong to it.
342100	343100	I'm Gandalf.
344100	346100	And Gandalf means...
348100	349100	me.
349100	352900	There are also some story changes that improve the overall film.
352900	356780	For instance, having the choice to go on the adventure would be Bilbo's idea, rather than
356780	358900	Gandalf effectively forcing him into it.
358900	361340	I'm going on an adventure!
361340	364340	Benedict Cumberbatch's Smaug is honestly one of his career highlights.
364340	368340	I smell you.
368340	372340	I hear your breath.
372340	376340	And I wish I had as much fun at anything in my life as Cumberbatch does playing Smaug.
376340	380140	How do you choose to die?
380140	383740	The scene where Bilbo and Smaug talk for the first time, at least until it starts going
383740	388340	on for way too long, ranks alongside any of the best scenes from Rings.
388340	392940	And do you now?
392940	397340	Adding in small details like Smaug being able to see Bilbo, which he couldn't in the book,
397340	400740	is another positive change that just adds more drama to the scene.
400740	405020	Even Lee Pace as Thranduil brings a sort of otherworldly dimension to a character in the
405020	407220	book who is just, you know, some greedy jerk.
407220	411780	It was also necessary to develop Bard as a character before he kills Smaug.
411780	415660	In the book he's just an ascended extra with no lines before he shows up with his bow to
415660	416660	kill the dragon.
416660	419740	There are dozens more great details I could go into.
419740	424660	The elves only eating, like, kale, the dwarves being horrified by that.
424660	425660	Try it.
425660	426660	Just a mouthful.
426660	429440	I don't like green food.
429440	431980	Even Gimli's gratuitous cameo doesn't bother me.
431980	436220	It is this horrid creature, the goblin mutant.
436220	439180	That's my wee lad, Gimli.
439180	442140	The problem with The Hobbit isn't the absence of good.
442140	443780	Good in it exists.
443780	446840	It is more the whole weighing less than the sum of its parts.
446840	450620	These positive elements are often used as refutations of criticism of The Hobbit.
450620	456140	But to say that the presence of good outweighs the pacing issues, the unnecessary plot cul-de-sacs,
456140	460340	the terrible visual effects, the clumsy integration of irrelevant plot points...
460340	461340	Sorry.
461340	467340	Yeah, I, uh, I'm starting to remember why these movies frustrated me so much.
474340	477660	The Hobbit was published 20 years before The Lord of the Rings was published, and itself
477660	481340	had to be reissued to fit with the new version of Middle-earth Tolkien created, and even
481340	484940	still is tonally a completely different animal from The Lord of the Rings.
484940	488880	Meanwhile, The Hobbit movies have the opposite problem, billed as prequels to movies that
488880	490660	had come out a decade prior.
490660	493060	Add into this the popularity of all parties involved.
493060	497220	The Hobbit is one of the best-selling books of all time, at over 100 million copies, shy
497220	500620	of Lord of the Rings' 150-odd million copies.
500620	503960	So on the one hand, the filmmakers are tasked with creating faithful adaptations of one
503960	505940	of the best-selling books of all time.
505940	509320	On the other hand, the filmmakers are tasked with creating prequels to one of the best-selling
509320	510860	film trilogies of all time.
510860	514940	So roadblock number one, The Lord of the Rings was written as a sequel to The Hobbit.
514940	518320	The Hobbit was not written as a prequel to Lord of the Rings.
518320	522660	And we have to be faithful to both, but in publication order, the prequel was not a prequel.
522660	525860	It wasn't even originally planned to have any sequels, and as a consequence, the central
525860	529620	conflict of The Hobbit, dwarves finding a treasure and then a bunch of people fighting
529620	533460	over it, has nothing to do with the central conflict of The Lord of the Rings, which is
533460	537660	that the magic ring Bilbo found on his adventure oops it's evil and will destroy the world.
537660	541220	Compare this with the Star Wars prequels, which, love them or hate them,
541220	543180	YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE!
543180	547780	their central conflicts do directly set up the plots of the original Star Wars trilogy.
547780	553620	How the Empire formed, how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader, what the Clone Wars were,
553620	554620	the gang's all here.
554620	558040	The Hobbit doesn't really work as a prequel to The Lord of the Rings because neither the
558040	560180	conflict nor the tone flow into it.
560180	564560	If they really wanted to do a prequel to The Lord of the Rings, one that set up the universe,
564560	569560	how the magic rings worked, how they came into existence, who Sauron is and where he
569560	574360	came from, why he had control over the rings of power, the real prequel to The Lord of
574360	577760	the Rings with a similar epic tone was The Silmarillion.
577760	581560	Said Tolkien himself of The Lord of the Rings in a letter to his publisher, it's not really
581560	584540	a sequel to The Hobbit, but to The Silmarillion.
584540	587200	But that wasn't The Lord of the Rings prequel anyone wanted.
587200	592400	We ain't gonna adapt no dense, myth-heavy Silmarillion with its paltry less than a million
592400	593400	copies sold.
593400	595060	Oh no, precious.
595060	600440	We wanted The Hobbit.
600440	604040	The truth is, The Hobbit existing in the same universe and having to logically progress
604040	608040	into The Lord of the Rings presented huge problems for Tolkien, and a lot of what we
608040	611320	know as The Hobbit wasn't there in the original publication.
611320	615960	Tolkien made dozens of tiny changes for the 1951 reissue of The Hobbit preceding the original
615960	619580	printing of The Lord of the Rings, but the biggest change was an almost total rewrite
619580	620780	of Riddles in the Dark.
620780	624640	In the original version, Gollum was a much more quirky, less sinister character, and
624640	628380	he gave Bilbo the Ring as a gift when Bilbo won the riddle contest.
628380	633340	The One Ring was not yet The One Ring, it was just a magic ring that would be really
633340	634340	useful.
634340	637460	A nice magic ring, but there was no intent to flow into something more epic.
637460	641680	The necromancer that Gandalf uses as an excuse to leave the dwarves at Mirkwood, we find
641680	645120	out in The Lord of the Rings that that was Sauron the whole time, and oh boy oh boy do
645120	650900	they play that up in The Hobbit movies.
650900	654200	This character, of course, was not originally intended to be Sauron.
654200	658160	The necromancer, according to Tolkien, was hardly more than to provide a reason for Gandalf
658160	661920	going away and leaving Bilbo and the dwarves to fend for themselves, which was necessary
661920	663120	for the tale.
663120	667940	So I get why people defend that decision on the part of the filmmakers to include Sauron,
667940	673720	but to state that that was Tolkien's original intent, that's pretty disingenuous.
673720	677520	But the biggest problem was in keeping the same plot while making The Hobbit, also a
677520	679740	tonal prequel to The Lord of the Rings.
679740	683860	The Hobbit, the novel, has a wildly different tone from The Lord of the Rings.
683860	687520	The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings take place in the same universe, but only nominally.
687520	691700	Many if not most of the details of the history of Middle Earth existed only in sketch form,
691700	695320	and Tolkien's beloved Silmarillion, which, yes, he'd started even before The Hobbit
695320	699760	was published, would change dramatically as Tolkien developed The Lord of the Rings.
699760	703320	But when The Hobbit was a success and Tolkien's publisher asked for a sequel, Tolkien didn't
703320	705080	really know where he wanted to go with it.
705080	708340	It took him several years to realize that the world of The Hobbit had effectively grown
708340	712680	up when his children did, and he wanted to write an epic fantasy for adults.
712680	716480	Because The Lord of the Rings both didn't hit the original target audience, children,
716480	718160	but then again it did.
718160	722000	Part of the reason why The Lord of the Rings feels more grown up is because his kids, and
722000	725440	by extension the original kids who read it when it was published, were growing up with
725440	729480	the stories, and Tolkien's oldest son Christopher was integral to the creation of the book.
729480	733000	The Hobbit was a children's story written before any serious publisher would dare entertain
733000	735440	the idea of epic fantasy literature for adults.
735440	739560	It was published at a time where fantasy was either Le Petit Prance or Beowulf, and The
739560	743520	Lord of the Rings, even twenty years later, was kind of a huge gamble, one that paid off
743520	746480	right away and has never been out of print since.
746480	748440	Tolkien wrote to a fan in 1955,
748440	752600	It remains an unfailing delight to me to find my own belief justified, that the fairy story
752600	756900	is really an adult genre, and one for which a starving audience exists.
756900	760120	Both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were stories for Tolkien's children, but
760120	762400	at different stages of life.
762400	766960	So, you can either make a faithful adaptation of The Hobbit, one that is fun and clever
766960	771340	and matches the child-like tone of the books, which were designed to be read aloud at storytime
771340	776120	and even include quick asides for the reader, or you can make three three-hour prequels
776120	780320	to Lord of the Rings that match the tone and epic scope of The Lord of the Rings.
780320	782080	But they can't be the same thing.
782080	786860	The Hobbit is about 95,000 words long, about 5,000 words shorter than the first Hunger
786860	790860	Games book, and about 12,000 words longer than the first Harry Potter book.
790860	796200	To compare, the Fellowship of the Ring alone is nearly twice that length at 177,000 words,
796200	800840	with the entirety of The Lord of the Rings cashing in at about 1.5 Games of Thrones,
800840	802680	and that doesn't even include the appendices.
802680	805720	This is not to say that The Hobbit needed to be the same length as the first Hunger
805720	808000	Games movie in order not to feel flabby.
808000	811640	The Hobbit has an extremely minimalistic style for all that goes down in it, compared with
811640	814760	the florid Lord of the Rings with its extreme attention to detail.
814760	819260	Adapting The Hobbit as it is without adding any pauses for character development or pacing
819260	823120	or worldbuilding would have made a film that felt incredibly rushed.
823120	826500	Even though the book is Hunger Games short, a lot more goes down in it, and it would feel
826500	830580	way too rushed as a 90-minute movie, or even one three-hour movie.
830580	834600	So I think the initial pitch of two two-hour movies directed by Guillermo del Toro could
834600	839080	have led to the creation of a great, original, memorable product, both in the spirit of the
839080	842440	original novel, yet distinct from the Lord of the Rings film trilogy.
842440	846960	Why does it hurt so much?
846960	854280	Because it was real.
854280	862160	Maybe they got that version of the Berenstain universe.
862160	866060	To explore the challenges of adapting The Hobbit, first we must examine the structure.
866060	868480	It has a beginning, middle, and end, kinda.
868480	871720	But it doesn't really have the structure of a Hollywood screenplay, let alone three
871720	873740	Hollywood screenplays.
873740	876880	Compared to The Fellowship of the Ring, the book doesn't really have a three-act structure,
876880	881360	per se, but without changing much, the film gets rid of the Tom Bombadil stuff.
881360	882360	Good call, that.
882360	886120	Has the end of Act 1 as Frodo leaving the Shire, and also has a really long Act 2, with
886120	891720	the midpoint being Frodo taking the ring to Mordor, and Act 3 comprising a big action
891720	895560	scene where Frodo escapes while Aragorn and the others fight the Uruk-hai, and Boromir
895560	898220	gets a much more emotional death than he does in the book.
898220	902120	Not a whole lot of rearranging needed to turn this into a three-act Hollywood structure.
902120	907960	But The Hobbit is way more episodic, with the individual adventures rarely changing
907960	908960	the quest.
908960	913480	The book pulls a great deal from English folktales, fairy stories, epics, and Norse poems like
913480	917840	Beowulf, so it includes elements that might otherwise feel out of place in a novel because
917840	919400	of the story's basis.
919440	924200	The points that feel out of nowhere are anticlimactic, like ascended extra bard killing the dragon
924200	929240	instead of Bilbo or the dwarves, or Smaug having one weakness is very rooted in mythology
929240	932320	and folk stories, Fafnir, Beowulf, Odysseus.
932320	936080	And as it ends up in the movies, boy is it anticlimactic.
941360	945700	This did not need to be so hideously anticlimactic, except for the way that they structured it.
945700	950880	The third movie begins with the burning of Laketown, and Smaug dies before the opening
950880	951880	title.
951880	954540	This, like so many things, is a consequence of restructuring.
954540	959760	Smaug's death should have been the midpoint of the second film, not the, um, prologue
959760	960760	to the third?
960760	964340	The structure of The Hobbit is episodic and meandering, not a lot of build like we see
964340	965660	in The Lord of the Rings.
965660	970020	Each chapter is a mini-adventure in which Bilbo either learns something, gets something,
970020	971180	or earns respect.
971180	975620	It is effectively designed to be read by adults, two children, one chapter per night.
975620	979340	Leonard Nimoy's Ode to Bilbo Bagginsong captures this pretty well.
989740	993660	The decision to split this book into three makes this into even more of a problem because
993660	999180	we need to split this tiny book into Act 1, Act 2, and Act 3 three times.
999180	1002860	This results in adding mini-climaxes that don't go anywhere, character moments that
1002860	1006940	come either too early or too late, and several elements that just don't translate.
1006940	1010380	Bilbo has nothing to do during the Battle of Five Armies and is unconscious for most
1010380	1011380	of it.
1011380	1013940	This isn't so much a problem in the book as the Battle of Five Armies takes up all
1013940	1018580	of like half a chapter, but they went and made it take two hours of a two-hour-and-forty-four-minute
1018580	1023780	movie that relegates Bilbo into a minor role and most of the dwarves as glorified extras.
1023780	1027060	But the worst problems don't arise because the book was a challenge to adapt.
1027060	1030460	There was a good movie in this mess, if you edit out, like, half of it.
1030460	1033860	It's the horrible structure problems that arise from the decision to split two films
1033860	1038020	into three a matter of months before the first film was set to be released.
1038020	1042100	So character beats need to be shuffled around not only according to the needs of adaptation,
1042100	1043940	but according to the needs of film structures.
1043940	1048140	So this moment, where Thorin finally respects Bilbo, happens here.
1048140	1052260	I have never been so wrong in all my life.
1052260	1055460	Rather than after Bilbo frees the dwarves in the barrels, where it was likely originally
1055460	1058860	intended to have happened and where it makes more sense to have happened, because Bilbo
1058860	1062080	had repeatedly proven himself to Thorin by that point.
1062080	1065900	But in the final version, where Thorin has to respect Bilbo before the eagles rescue
1065900	1070540	them, the one action Bilbo gets is to bum-rush an orc.
1070540	1073220	Like a linebacker.
1073220	1076340	And it makes that plot point weaker because Bilbo freeing the dwarves through his cunning
1076340	1079180	and magic ring is what makes him valuable to the party.
1079180	1081900	He doesn't think like them, and his wits are his greatest asset.
1081900	1086700	So his prove-myself-to-Thorin moment being, like, a football tackle just makes a rushed
1086700	1088340	moment all the weaker.
1088340	1090140	Bilbo's not a linebacker.
1090140	1091460	He's a hobbit.
1091460	1094640	He's THE hobbit.
1094640	1098940	And now Bilbo and Thorin's relationship has zero development throughout movie two.
1098940	1102340	It's just kind of at a par, and then they have their falling out in three.
1102340	1107460	When you decided to make three instead of two movies, isn't it hard to split in story
1107460	1109740	arc from two into three?
1109740	1110980	Well, it was actually better.
1110980	1115140	I mean, we made that decision because it was going to be, we felt it was going to be a
1115140	1116140	better shape.
1116140	1117140	I mean, it was our decision.
1117140	1119140	It wasn't a studio decision.
1119140	1120140	Really?
1120140	1121140	Really?
1121140	1125380	I find that very hard to believe.
1125380	1130020	The original first film was set to end once the party got to either Erebor or Laketown.
1130020	1134240	Part two would have been getting into Erebor, everything with Smaug, and then Five Armies.
1134240	1139660	So the nonsense climaxes of movies one and two, which involves so much...
1139660	1140660	What?
1140660	1141660	What?
1141660	1146180	Our dwarves' heat was...
1146220	1148220	Middle doesn't...
1148220	1150220	What?
1150220	1152220	What?
1152220	1155900	The need for these contrived climaxes that add nothing to the overall narrative directly
1155900	1160020	trace back to that 11th hour decision to turn two movies into three, because all movies
1160020	1161020	are trilogies now.
1161020	1163020	Is this two or three?
1163020	1164020	Oh, it's three.
1164020	1165020	Is this three?
1165020	1166020	Yeah.
1166020	1167020	It's three.
1167020	1168020	There you go.
1168020	1170340	It's that easy to be confused.
1170340	1172420	And then there was the stuff they added.
1172420	1174420	Oh, and the stuff they added.
1174660	1177660	Aren't you going to search me?
1177660	1179660	I could have anything down my trousers.
1179660	1182860	Again, to compare to The Lord of the Rings, because we have to, they cut just as much
1182860	1187260	out of the novels as they added into the films, and most of what they added was some expansion
1187260	1190940	on material from the appendices, most notably Aragorn and Arwen.
1190940	1195140	At the front, when Arwen rescues Frodo, is more of a change rather than an addition,
1195140	1197060	and again a positive one in my opinion.
1197060	1201180	In the book, Frodo is rescued by a character who never appears again, so making it Aragorn's
1201180	1204140	one true love makes that plot point stronger.
1204140	1209100	In The Two Towers, they also added a warg battle and Aragorn getting separated, and
1209100	1213260	a bunch of scenes with Arwen and Arwen leaving and then coming back.
1213260	1216900	Frodo and Sam have a tiff in The Return of the King, which, you know, I'm not a fan of,
1216900	1219780	but I guess I get why they got it.
1219780	1222920	Gollum framing Sam, which is kind of dumb, but okay.
1222920	1226100	And then there's the scene at Asgiliath at the end of Two Towers that gives Frodo and
1226100	1230940	Sam a climax in the second movie, and those are kind of like the only major additions.
1230940	1235620	They cut out a few chapters, like Tom Bombadil and The Scouring of the Shire entirely, but
1235620	1238540	they didn't add that much in the grand scheme.
1238540	1242500	Here's some of the stuff they added to The Hobbit.
1242500	1250780	The White Council, this orc mini-boss who's in all three films, fighting dragon priests,
1250780	1257140	Evangeline Lily, Legolas fighting, that endlessly long barrel-reverchase scene between orcs
1257140	1262980	and elves, and we're fighting, Kili is hot and he's in love, Gandalf and Galadriel...
1262980	1263980	huh?
1263980	1268980	Kill me, kill me, Ronin.
1268980	1276440	Legolas fighting, Radagast the Brown, he's got poop on his head, useless framing device,
1276440	1282220	the entire climax of Desolation, Evangeline Lily is in a love triangle, Legolas is sooooo
1282220	1286980	cool, wow this framing device sure is going on forever, Bilbo linebacker, did they fuck?
1287020	1293340	Side quest to Angmar that goes nowhere, Stephen Fry's horrible henchmen, what is happening?
1293340	1298320	On-screen White Council scene, God, Alfred is awful, look at Legolas go, Bard the Bowman
1298320	1305220	has a family now, Bjorn needed a bare chase scene, come with me, my lady, Gandalf, she's
1305220	1311780	married, gratuitous Elijah Wood cameo, true love, and that's like not even half of it.
1311780	1320260	This ties in with other adaptational problems, namely the problem of The Hobbit being so
1320260	1325340	different and more childlike, read cartoonish, in tone than the more gritty adult Lord of
1325340	1326340	the Rings.
1326340	1329480	First, the Battle of Five Armies, just all of it.
1329480	1333140	It takes up about half a chapter and Bilbo is unconscious, so of course this needed to
1333140	1337200	be expanded, but the result is longer than the Battle of Helm's Deep, which itself started
1337200	1338200	to drag in the run-up.
1338200	1339780	I do not trust a hope.
1339780	1340780	There is no hope.
1340780	1342860	There is still hope.
1342860	1343860	We get it.
1343860	1345780	They say that it is hopeless.
1345780	1347120	We get it.
1347120	1350860	Another consequence of splitting two movies into three is that movie two needs a climax
1350860	1355580	now, and that is how we got the escape from Smaug scene and the heat-resistant dwarves.
1355580	1359500	It adds a gratuitous action scene that goes on forever, but adds absolutely nothing to
1359500	1360500	the narrative plot-wise.
1360500	1365380	Smaug was going to go destroy Lake Town either way, so this action scene is bereft of tension
1365380	1366680	in every regard.
1366680	1369080	This is a problem in a lot of recent films.
1369080	1373000	Studio will mandate X number of action scenes, but these action scenes either have no tension,
1373000	1376600	either in the macro sense of how they advance the plot, or in the momentary sense of whether
1376600	1380600	the characters get through or not, and whether we, the audience, care.
1380600	1384520	This is particularly problematic in that the dwarves seem utterly resistant to dragon fire
1384520	1386240	and to heat in general.
1386240	1390360	So there is no physical danger to them, so...
1390360	1391360	Why...
1391360	1392360	Thorin?
1393040	1397080	Thorin, you know metal is a conductor, right?
1397080	1400440	There is a similar problem in the scene where the dwarves escape the elves.
1400440	1405040	It has a plot-related tension of escape, but the action is so absurd that you can't really
1405040	1406680	feel for these guys.
1406680	1408700	They appear to be made of rubber.
1408700	1410960	They don't seem to have any mortality.
1410960	1414080	Healy gets shot by an arrow, and that's sad and hurts him.
1414080	1421680	But meanwhile, this is happening.
1421680	1425000	The cartoons barrel boing boing, all in the same scene.
1425000	1426920	Are these guys impervious or not?
1426920	1429880	And if they are impervious, then where's the tension?
1429880	1431920	And then there was the storm giants.
1431920	1434400	This is no thunderstorm.
1434400	1436320	It's a thunder battle.
1436320	1439160	Oh, the storm giants.
1439160	1443880	So like Five Armies takes up about half a chapter, the storm giants, a five minute scene,
1443880	1446240	takes up about half a sentence.
1446240	1448460	Here's the sentence.
1448460	1452340	And according to The Annotated Hobbit, most Tolkien scholars don't think of storm giants
1452340	1456740	as like, alternate fantasy creatures that we haven't seen yet.
1456740	1459400	They're, you know, they're just trolls.
1459400	1463260	Cave trolls, troll trolls, trolls that like to play in the rain and throw rocks.
1463260	1468580	You know, the fun kind of troll, not the internet kind.
1468580	1471900	But speaking of cave troll, there is a scene in Fellowship that this reminds me of.
1471900	1475700	We're in the mines of Moria, we've just found out how Balin and all of the dwarves there
1475700	1476700	died.
1476700	1484340	And then Pippin inadvertently causes an extended action scene that goes on for about 20 minutes
1484340	1485620	and ends with Gandalf's death.
1485620	1489460	You see what I mean about action scenes should advance the plot?
1489460	1491060	Anyway.
1491060	1504620	Before this scene, we've set up the Mithril armor, which Bilbo got from Thorin and the
1504620	1506460	Hobbit and Gibbs to Frodo.
1506460	1508740	During the scene, Frodo gets stabbed by the troll.
1508740	1515080	Everyone's like, oh no, he dead, but ah wait, remember that Mithril armor.
1515080	1518940	So with the storm giant scene, again we're straining believability by oscillating between
1518940	1524020	the mortal, Bilbo hanging from a ledge and needing a rescue, and the cartoonish, literally
1524020	1530940	everything else in the scene.
1530940	1535480	It culminates in this moment, they're on the knee of a giant who ostensibly smashes
1535480	1541800	them into the side of a cliff, but no, they're fine.
1541800	1548940	See they're fine, whatever, let's go.
1548940	1552620	Unlike the troll scene in Fellowship, where Frodo reveals the Mithril armor, there is
1552620	1553800	no payoff here.
1553800	1558160	No one's skill that had been set up in an earlier scene saves them, it's just a wildly
1558160	1560840	unlikely coincidence that they survive.
1560840	1563200	Action that goes nowhere and advances nothing.
1563200	1567360	So unlike with Rings, where we have a constant sense of mortality and the physical pain these
1567360	1573000	characters are going through, in The Hobbit it's like action figures being smashed together.
1573000	1575040	There's never any real sense of danger.
1575040	1578620	When they get caught by goblins, Gandalf shows up and they cut through them like butter.
1578620	1582000	And to be clear, this is not about knowing what the outcome of the scene is just because
1582000	1583040	you've read the book.
1583040	1587100	You can still feel tension as an audience member, even if you already know what the
1587100	1588920	outcome of the scene is.
1588920	1593000	And there's nothing wrong with a playful cartoony tone in and of itself, but it's
1593000	1597200	really hard to include that in a narrative that also has these dramatic moments of physical
1597200	1598360	danger.
1598360	1604440	If this doesn't kill them, and that doesn't kill them, and that doesn't kill them, then
1604440	1606380	what would?
1606380	1610080	In order to maintain tension, the rules of the universe have to be consistent, and we
1610080	1612700	need to believe that these characters are in danger.
1612700	1616720	It goes without saying Bilbo and Gandalf surviving, for instance, is a foregone conclusion that
1616720	1617840	can't be helped.
1617840	1621040	But there are ways to build tension in an already popular story.
1621080	1625000	Fellowship of the Ring takes a character like Boromir, and it fleshes him out with an understandable
1625000	1628960	personal conflict and friendship with the hobbits, so that when he does die, it feels
1628960	1633320	way more upsetting and meaningful and, well, human than it did in the book.
1633320	1637640	Tolkien didn't really care about Boromir as a character, but Jackson and his co-writers
1637640	1642000	keyed into his humanity, and the result is one of the strongest, most memorable performances
1642000	1643540	in all three films.
1643540	1648340	The entire character of Boromir is an excellent example of the way movies can improve upon
1648340	1649340	their source material.
1650100	1651100	Believe it.
1651100	1652700	It is over.
1652700	1654100	But these are all style choices.
1654100	1658460	To me, the biggest issue with the hobbit movies was instead of letting the movies be The Hobbit,
1664060	1666900	the biggest mess in all three films is the attempt to make the central conflict in The
1666900	1670420	Hobbit directly tied in with the central conflict of The Lord of the Rings.
1670420	1674540	Because it just isn't, except maybe in that really, really distant Silmarillion way where
1674540	1680380	all bad things like dragons and orcs, et cetera, all originate from the same bad one dude.
1680380	1684940	By the way, if you want to go down a fun rabbit hole, Google image search Sauron Melkor fan
1684940	1685940	art.
1685940	1686940	It is a trip.
1686940	1689580	Even in Tolkien's awkward retrofit where we find out that the necromancer was Sauron
1689580	1693580	the whole time, it's almost completely irrelevant to the conflict in The Hobbit.
1693580	1697300	Gandalf mentions that Sauron is over here somewhere in the Fellowship of the Ring, but
1697300	1700940	it doesn't really mean anything to either narrative except for helping Gandalf put two
1700940	1703420	and two together when Bilbo starts acting weird.
1705540	1710580	So their solution was to double down on what was, even to Tolkien, kind of a contrived
1710580	1717140	throwaway line to get Gandalf out of the picture.
1717140	1720440	It works in a children's story, but when you take a plot device to get Gandalf away
1720440	1729700	from the party and then try to develop it into this lush world building, still there
1729700	1732140	had to be a better way to make this work.
1732740	1736700	Ultimately, there is a rising darkness in the form of the goblins and the dragons and
1736700	1740500	the whole thrust of the battle at the end is everyone fighting each other over a petty
1740500	1743860	treasure when there is a real existential threat to all of them.
1743860	1749340	See, the reveal of the necromancer's identity doesn't actually matter in this story because
1749340	1751700	he doesn't really do anything.
1751700	1756320	This only matters to the audience who recognizes this character from Lord of the Rings.
1756320	1760240	What it is in the book is Gandalf's discovery of the orc army, which we later find out is
1760240	1761960	commanded by Sauron.
1761960	1765680	If we wanted to keep Sauron here, sure, have it be that angle.
1765680	1770160	But the problem is they're already being pursued by orcs from the minute go, way before
1770160	1772400	we learn that the necromancer is Sauron.
1772400	1777080	A different orc army, not to be confused with this orc army, you know, the one with the
1777080	1778860	worms of Arrakis.
1778860	1782440	But as it is in the final product, the reveal of Sauron is completely meaningless.
1782440	1786200	But it could have flown in better thematically into the Lord of the Rings.
1786200	1790880	Darkness rising, stop fighting over stupid shit y'all, it's only gonna get worse.
1791200	1795300	More focus is placed on shoehorning in these plot elements and characters from rings, which
1795300	1798040	makes it just feel flabby and awkward.
1798040	1801960	There's one bit in the appendices with Christopher Lee that breaks my heart a little bit.
1801960	1807900	If it means something in the story, and it's what the director wants.
1807900	1811880	So you're using the staff in the hand like, so yep, yep, perfect.
1811880	1817800	And the audience remembers it, that's what it's all about.
1817800	1821600	Lee and Jackson kind of parted on bad terms after the Lord of the Rings, since Sauron's
1821600	1825120	conclusion was cut from Return of the King in the theatrical cut.
1825120	1826920	But he is here for this.
1826920	1828320	And he's excited to be here.
1828320	1832640	And he loves this idea of playing pre-corruption Sauron and going after Sauron.
1832640	1835280	Leave Sauron to me.
1835280	1839320	One of the very few good moments in the Battle of Five Armies.
1839320	1844200	Leave Sauron to me.
1844200	1845200	And he means it.
1845600	1847960	And this just makes me sad.
1847960	1853280	Because that idea, that angle, that passion that Lee has, in a scene that on the whole
1853280	1859960	is so unnecessary and confusing and goofy and Gandalf and Galadriel, what are you doing?
1859960	1864720	Perhaps in another life, if only wizards and elves could procreate.
1864720	1866680	It's just wasted here.
1866680	1869480	And that, I think, is the essence of these movies.
1869480	1873940	Moments of brilliance wasted in a product that, on the whole, tries to have it all ways
1873940	1877260	and in the process just pulls itself apart at the seams.
1877260	1881460	But there's one element in particular, a small one, but to me it encapsulates the clumsily
1881460	1884060	slapped together new ending to movie one.
1884060	1887660	It's not the Bilbo bum rush, but this right here.
1893100	1894100	Did you catch it?
1894100	1895100	Here, I'll play it again.
1903940	1909540	That's...
1909540	1912620	That's the Ringwraith theme.
1912620	1926740	Like, you know, things mean things.
1926740	1929140	Musical motifs especially mean things.
1929140	1932940	That wasn't Sauron's theme, it wasn't Gollum's theme.
1932940	1936620	That was, specifically, the Ringwraith theme from Fellowship.
1936620	1940620	I know you know this, Howard Shore, Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens, all of whom put
1940620	1943080	so much thought and effort into The Lord of the Rings.
1943080	1945740	You explained it to me back in 2001.
1945740	1949840	Revelation of the Ringwraiths is a poem that Philippa Boyens wrote, because in the case
1949840	1960220	of this it was translated into Andunaic, which was the ancient speech of man.
1960220	1964260	And here you are, just slapping on whatever ominous-sounding music, because you decided
1964260	1968060	it should be three films in October, and it's being released in December, and Howard Shore
1968060	1974020	didn't have time to compose something new.
1974020	1976980	I get that they didn't have the time that they had for Rings, and Jackson didn't really
1976980	1980980	want to direct, and he was tapped out and exhausted the whole time.
1980980	1982740	But it really shows.
1982740	1986380	So maybe it isn't just my nostalgia that it didn't do it for me the way The Lord of the
1986380	1987380	Rings did.
1987660	1991980	There's just so much that doesn't work here, and it's pretty easy to pinpoint.
1991980	1994260	The question is, why?
1994260	1997260	It isn't like some outside studio hack swooped in and took over.
1997260	2001220	The Hobbit has almost entirely the same creative team and the same cast as The Lord of the
2001220	2002220	Rings.
2002220	2007980	We are very much going to be the same storytellers making this sort of six series story, six
2007980	2008980	six film series.
2008980	2013640	There are some genuinely great creative choices unique to this trilogy, and the new cast is
2013640	2016960	both brilliant and distinct from the cast of The Lord of the Rings, when they aren't
2016960	2020560	characters from The Lord of the Rings that are awkwardly shoehorned in, anyway.
2020560	2024000	And yet, I kind of long for death.
2024000	2027920	I recall looking back at the extended DVDs of The Lord of the Rings, how watching all
2027920	2032520	those extras inspired interest and passion in the filmmaking process and added an extra
2032520	2037040	layer of enjoyment to the films themselves, seeing how by no means no, the making of The
2037040	2040840	Lord of the Rings was not easy, but everyone was here for it.
2040840	2044000	And that passion comes through in the final product.
2044000	2047760	And I look at The Hobbit and I'm just, I'm just tired.
2047760	2051520	Like I see these extra features, the care and pain taken to create what was brought
2051520	2057580	to the screen, that each movie has ten hours of extras, and I'm just like, I don't care.
2057580	2061360	And I find myself struggling to remember what moved me so deeply about The Lord of the Rings
2061360	2065020	in the first place if so many of the elements are going to affect the same.
2065020	2067220	These movies just, they make me feel drained.
2067220	2071380	I don't hate them, I just, I feel nothing.
2071380	2075460	And I find myself unable to remember why I was so passionate about The Lord of the Rings
2075460	2077700	and the works of Tolkien in the first place.
2081840	2087620	Is there a way to un-grow up, be like young Scout Finch, see through that naive worldview
2087620	2092540	where we can look up to the things that we loved as kids and absolutes?
2092540	2094540	Can you ever really go home again?
2095020	2099020	Or must we all, like Frodo, eventually go into the West?
2105420	2111500	The reason why some of us respond so emotionally to media is because media helped shape us as kids.
2111500	2115220	We all have a first love in movies, and The Lord of the Rings was one of mine.
2115220	2120580	So no matter how, quote, mature, end quote, you become in your consumption of media, there's
2120580	2124380	always going to be some part of you that desires not to see your childhood passions
2124380	2129700	through the eyes of an adult, but instead to recapture what ignited our passions as kids.
2129700	2135700	But maybe, now that I'm an adult with an expendable income, I can make a journey to find the answers
2135700	2140700	to my questions, and see if perhaps that magic can be recaptured.
2142700	2143700	Lindsay, wait!
2150580	2159580	Go back, Nilla!
2159580	2162580	I'm going to New Zealand alone!
2162580	2164580	Of course you are!
2164580	2166580	And I'm coming with you!
2180580	2182580	Thanks for watching!
