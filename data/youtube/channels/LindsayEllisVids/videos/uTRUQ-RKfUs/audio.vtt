00:00.000 --> 00:13.720
In mid-2015, less than a year before her death, author Harper Lee published her second novel,

00:13.720 --> 00:18.480
Go Set a Watchman, a sequel to her first and only other published novel, 1960's To Kill

00:18.480 --> 00:19.480
a Mockingbird.

00:19.480 --> 00:23.920
Though the book was published 55 years after To Kill a Mockingbird, it is generally accepted

00:23.920 --> 00:29.640
now that Go Set a Watchman was actually written concurrent to or even before To Kill a Mockingbird,

00:29.640 --> 00:33.200
and in the process of writing To Kill a Mockingbird, rather than encouraging her to create the

00:33.200 --> 00:37.680
entire omnibus, the publisher urged Lee to focus on the childhood aspect, and not on

00:37.680 --> 00:41.740
Scout becoming an adult and growing into a more complete understanding of who her father,

00:41.740 --> 00:43.280
Atticus Finch, was.

00:43.280 --> 00:47.500
Generations of people had grown up with Atticus Finch, played with such power and pathos by

00:47.500 --> 00:53.100
Gregory Peck in the 1962 film adaptation, only to then have the author swoop in 55 years

00:53.100 --> 00:56.760
later and remove the halo adorning Atticus Finch.

00:56.760 --> 00:59.920
There is some debate as to whether or not the publisher took advantage of Harper Lee

00:59.920 --> 01:03.640
given her age and the fact that she may not have been in possession of her full faculties

01:03.640 --> 01:06.880
when Go Set a Watchman was published, but it is kind of out there now that Go Set a

01:06.880 --> 01:09.600
Watchman was always kind of a part of her authorial intent.

01:09.600 --> 01:13.220
To Kill a Mockingbird was written from the point of view of an adult reflecting the understanding

01:13.220 --> 01:17.400
of a child, but Go Set a Watchman changed the framing of Atticus, allowing for a more

01:17.400 --> 01:22.480
complete picture of the worldview of white landowners in the South, even the nicest ones.

01:22.480 --> 01:26.120
Atticus wasn't an activist, he wasn't terribly concerned with the plight of black Americans

01:26.120 --> 01:27.560
in the Jim Crow South.

01:27.560 --> 01:31.960
He was just a really good lawyer who got appointed this guy's public defender, and he didn't

01:31.960 --> 01:33.840
want to lose a case.

01:33.840 --> 01:38.000
That Go Set a Watchman brought Atticus Finch, the moral pillar of American literature, down

01:38.000 --> 01:40.920
to the level of flawed human was heresy to some.

01:40.920 --> 01:43.600
Atticus was integral to the childhoods of so many.

01:43.600 --> 01:44.600
Why?

01:44.600 --> 01:46.880
Why add this unasked-for perspective?

01:46.880 --> 01:49.160
Why did you ruin Atticus, Harper Lee?

01:49.160 --> 01:52.240
Why did you do it?

01:52.240 --> 01:55.220
And I get that you're wondering why in an episode about The Hobbit the intro is about

01:55.220 --> 01:57.380
Harper Lee and Go Set a Watchman.

01:57.380 --> 02:00.220
Well, we'll get to that.

02:00.220 --> 02:01.220
But first...

02:01.220 --> 02:10.500
The Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship of the Ring is so good it makes me angry.

02:10.500 --> 02:16.540
I am a certain to the secret fire, wielder of the flame of our door.

02:16.540 --> 02:18.580
Like this was lightning in a bottle.

02:18.580 --> 02:21.180
We will never see anything like this again.

02:21.180 --> 02:25.340
This was back when franchises were a gamble, and Fellowship had a massive gun to its head

02:25.340 --> 02:30.540
to do well or sink not only the rest of the franchise but also everyone involved's career.

02:30.540 --> 02:32.100
It had to be great.

02:32.100 --> 02:35.480
And the result was so tight and streamlined that not only did it become one of the most

02:35.480 --> 02:39.940
lucrative trilogies in film history, it changed film itself.

02:39.940 --> 02:50.300
Eleven years passed, and the Lord of the Rings film still elicited positive feelings, mostly.

02:50.300 --> 02:57.320
In came The Hobbit trilogy.

02:57.320 --> 03:01.620
At the time, consensus was that these movies were, at best, a mediocre bloated mess with

03:01.620 --> 03:02.980
some enjoyable moments.

03:02.980 --> 03:07.140
Having as intimate a knowledge as I did with the source material and the first film trilogy,

03:07.140 --> 03:11.700
I was pretty disillusioned from the get-go, bored to death by the first one and by that

03:11.700 --> 03:15.700
point already tapped out, seeing the second one in theaters only out of a morbid sense

03:15.700 --> 03:18.420
of obligation and not bothering at all with the third film.

03:18.420 --> 03:22.620
But The Lord of the Rings came out at a particularly formative time in my development.

03:22.620 --> 03:26.540
I said back in 2012 that it was the first film trilogy that got me actively interested

03:26.540 --> 03:30.980
in filmmaking, and that is true, but that in itself is a form of bias.

03:30.980 --> 03:34.460
I wanted The Hobbit to make me feel like The Lord of the Rings did when I was a kid, and

03:34.460 --> 03:36.100
it didn't, so I hated it.

03:36.100 --> 03:40.460
Why does it hurt so much?

03:40.460 --> 03:41.460
Because it was real.

03:41.460 --> 03:45.660
It's been nearly seventeen years since Fellowship and six years since the release of the first

03:45.660 --> 03:46.900
Hobbit film.

03:46.900 --> 03:49.780
So maybe now is the time to re-examine The Hobbit.

03:49.780 --> 03:52.220
You cannot disentangle it from The Lord of the Rings.

03:52.220 --> 03:54.260
The film itself doesn't want you to.

03:54.260 --> 03:59.220
But maybe I was judging The Hobbit for what it wasn't, rather than what it was.

03:59.220 --> 04:01.080
So let's re-examine The Hobbit.

04:01.080 --> 04:02.660
Let's try and give it a fair shake.

04:02.660 --> 04:07.020
Darr, why are there dwarves climbing out of our toilet?

04:07.020 --> 04:08.020
You are a coward.

04:08.020 --> 04:09.020
Cowards?

04:09.020 --> 04:12.220
Not every man's brave enough to wear a coal seat.

04:12.220 --> 04:21.660
If that's even possible.

04:21.660 --> 04:26.300
The Hobbit trilogy was released between 2012 and 2014 under the subtitles An Unexpected

04:26.300 --> 04:29.980
Journey, The Desolation of Smaug, and The Battle of Five Armies.

04:29.980 --> 04:33.500
The creative team behind The Hobbit is almost uniformly the same as that from The Lord of

04:33.500 --> 04:36.100
the Rings, with one curious addition.

04:36.100 --> 04:42.320
For better or worse, you're as known for the movie you didn't do, The Hobbit, as the

04:42.320 --> 04:43.460
ones that you did.

04:43.460 --> 04:44.460
We'll get to that.

04:44.460 --> 04:48.700
A huge chunk of the cast return to reprise their roles from Lord of the Rings, most notably

04:48.700 --> 04:54.140
Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Andy Serkis as Gollum, and Hugo Weaving as Elrond, and adding in

04:54.140 --> 05:00.060
not-in-the-Hobbit-rings characters such as Legolas, Saruman, Galadriel, and even Frodo.

05:00.060 --> 05:01.440
And Radagast is here, too.

05:01.440 --> 05:05.140
But that is not to imply that none of the new elements for The Hobbit were bad.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.380
Far from it, some of them were inspired.

05:07.380 --> 05:10.420
Martin Freeman as Bilbo is pitch-perfect casting.

05:10.420 --> 05:11.420
Incineration.

05:11.420 --> 05:15.700
Freeman has spent much of his entire career since the original Office playing the put-upon

05:15.700 --> 05:25.660
everyman and that layer of wit combined with his innate sincerity works really well here.

05:25.660 --> 05:30.820
The opening scene with Gandalf and Bilbo, after roughly 20 minutes of prologue anyway,

05:30.820 --> 05:32.660
is almost verbatim from the book.

05:32.660 --> 05:36.920
McKellen perfectly bridges the whimsical, mercurial, difficult Gandalf of The Hobbit

05:36.920 --> 05:38.860
with the serious business Gandalf of rings.

05:38.860 --> 05:42.100
You know my name, although you don't remember I belong to it.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.100
I'm Gandalf.

05:44.100 --> 05:46.100
And Gandalf means...

05:48.100 --> 05:49.100
me.

05:49.100 --> 05:52.900
There are also some story changes that improve the overall film.

05:52.900 --> 05:56.780
For instance, having the choice to go on the adventure would be Bilbo's idea, rather than

05:56.780 --> 05:58.900
Gandalf effectively forcing him into it.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.340
I'm going on an adventure!

06:01.340 --> 06:04.340
Benedict Cumberbatch's Smaug is honestly one of his career highlights.

06:04.340 --> 06:08.340
I smell you.

06:08.340 --> 06:12.340
I hear your breath.

06:12.340 --> 06:16.340
And I wish I had as much fun at anything in my life as Cumberbatch does playing Smaug.

06:16.340 --> 06:20.140
How do you choose to die?

06:20.140 --> 06:23.740
The scene where Bilbo and Smaug talk for the first time, at least until it starts going

06:23.740 --> 06:28.340
on for way too long, ranks alongside any of the best scenes from Rings.

06:28.340 --> 06:32.940
And do you now?

06:32.940 --> 06:37.340
Adding in small details like Smaug being able to see Bilbo, which he couldn't in the book,

06:37.340 --> 06:40.740
is another positive change that just adds more drama to the scene.

06:40.740 --> 06:45.020
Even Lee Pace as Thranduil brings a sort of otherworldly dimension to a character in the

06:45.020 --> 06:47.220
book who is just, you know, some greedy jerk.

06:47.220 --> 06:51.780
It was also necessary to develop Bard as a character before he kills Smaug.

06:51.780 --> 06:55.660
In the book he's just an ascended extra with no lines before he shows up with his bow to

06:55.660 --> 06:56.660
kill the dragon.

06:56.660 --> 06:59.740
There are dozens more great details I could go into.

06:59.740 --> 07:04.660
The elves only eating, like, kale, the dwarves being horrified by that.

07:04.660 --> 07:05.660
Try it.

07:05.660 --> 07:06.660
Just a mouthful.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.440
I don't like green food.

07:09.440 --> 07:11.980
Even Gimli's gratuitous cameo doesn't bother me.

07:11.980 --> 07:16.220
It is this horrid creature, the goblin mutant.

07:16.220 --> 07:19.180
That's my wee lad, Gimli.

07:19.180 --> 07:22.140
The problem with The Hobbit isn't the absence of good.

07:22.140 --> 07:23.780
Good in it exists.

07:23.780 --> 07:26.840
It is more the whole weighing less than the sum of its parts.

07:26.840 --> 07:30.620
These positive elements are often used as refutations of criticism of The Hobbit.

07:30.620 --> 07:36.140
But to say that the presence of good outweighs the pacing issues, the unnecessary plot cul-de-sacs,

07:36.140 --> 07:40.340
the terrible visual effects, the clumsy integration of irrelevant plot points...

07:40.340 --> 07:41.340
Sorry.

07:41.340 --> 07:47.340
Yeah, I, uh, I'm starting to remember why these movies frustrated me so much.

07:54.340 --> 07:57.660
The Hobbit was published 20 years before The Lord of the Rings was published, and itself

07:57.660 --> 08:01.340
had to be reissued to fit with the new version of Middle-earth Tolkien created, and even

08:01.340 --> 08:04.940
still is tonally a completely different animal from The Lord of the Rings.

08:04.940 --> 08:08.880
Meanwhile, The Hobbit movies have the opposite problem, billed as prequels to movies that

08:08.880 --> 08:10.660
had come out a decade prior.

08:10.660 --> 08:13.060
Add into this the popularity of all parties involved.

08:13.060 --> 08:17.220
The Hobbit is one of the best-selling books of all time, at over 100 million copies, shy

08:17.220 --> 08:20.620
of Lord of the Rings' 150-odd million copies.

08:20.620 --> 08:23.960
So on the one hand, the filmmakers are tasked with creating faithful adaptations of one

08:23.960 --> 08:25.940
of the best-selling books of all time.

08:25.940 --> 08:29.320
On the other hand, the filmmakers are tasked with creating prequels to one of the best-selling

08:29.320 --> 08:30.860
film trilogies of all time.

08:30.860 --> 08:34.940
So roadblock number one, The Lord of the Rings was written as a sequel to The Hobbit.

08:34.940 --> 08:38.320
The Hobbit was not written as a prequel to Lord of the Rings.

08:38.320 --> 08:42.660
And we have to be faithful to both, but in publication order, the prequel was not a prequel.

08:42.660 --> 08:45.860
It wasn't even originally planned to have any sequels, and as a consequence, the central

08:45.860 --> 08:49.620
conflict of The Hobbit, dwarves finding a treasure and then a bunch of people fighting

08:49.620 --> 08:53.460
over it, has nothing to do with the central conflict of The Lord of the Rings, which is

08:53.460 --> 08:57.660
that the magic ring Bilbo found on his adventure oops it's evil and will destroy the world.

08:57.660 --> 09:01.220
Compare this with the Star Wars prequels, which, love them or hate them,

09:01.220 --> 09:03.180
YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE!

09:03.180 --> 09:07.780
their central conflicts do directly set up the plots of the original Star Wars trilogy.

09:07.780 --> 09:13.620
How the Empire formed, how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader, what the Clone Wars were,

09:13.620 --> 09:14.620
the gang's all here.

09:14.620 --> 09:18.040
The Hobbit doesn't really work as a prequel to The Lord of the Rings because neither the

09:18.040 --> 09:20.180
conflict nor the tone flow into it.

09:20.180 --> 09:24.560
If they really wanted to do a prequel to The Lord of the Rings, one that set up the universe,

09:24.560 --> 09:29.560
how the magic rings worked, how they came into existence, who Sauron is and where he

09:29.560 --> 09:34.360
came from, why he had control over the rings of power, the real prequel to The Lord of

09:34.360 --> 09:37.760
the Rings with a similar epic tone was The Silmarillion.

09:37.760 --> 09:41.560
Said Tolkien himself of The Lord of the Rings in a letter to his publisher, it's not really

09:41.560 --> 09:44.540
a sequel to The Hobbit, but to The Silmarillion.

09:44.540 --> 09:47.200
But that wasn't The Lord of the Rings prequel anyone wanted.

09:47.200 --> 09:52.400
We ain't gonna adapt no dense, myth-heavy Silmarillion with its paltry less than a million

09:52.400 --> 09:53.400
copies sold.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.060
Oh no, precious.

09:55.060 --> 10:00.440
We wanted The Hobbit.

10:00.440 --> 10:04.040
The truth is, The Hobbit existing in the same universe and having to logically progress

10:04.040 --> 10:08.040
into The Lord of the Rings presented huge problems for Tolkien, and a lot of what we

10:08.040 --> 10:11.320
know as The Hobbit wasn't there in the original publication.

10:11.320 --> 10:15.960
Tolkien made dozens of tiny changes for the 1951 reissue of The Hobbit preceding the original

10:15.960 --> 10:19.580
printing of The Lord of the Rings, but the biggest change was an almost total rewrite

10:19.580 --> 10:20.780
of Riddles in the Dark.

10:20.780 --> 10:24.640
In the original version, Gollum was a much more quirky, less sinister character, and

10:24.640 --> 10:28.380
he gave Bilbo the Ring as a gift when Bilbo won the riddle contest.

10:28.380 --> 10:33.340
The One Ring was not yet The One Ring, it was just a magic ring that would be really

10:33.340 --> 10:34.340
useful.

10:34.340 --> 10:37.460
A nice magic ring, but there was no intent to flow into something more epic.

10:37.460 --> 10:41.680
The necromancer that Gandalf uses as an excuse to leave the dwarves at Mirkwood, we find

10:41.680 --> 10:45.120
out in The Lord of the Rings that that was Sauron the whole time, and oh boy oh boy do

10:45.120 --> 10:50.900
they play that up in The Hobbit movies.

10:50.900 --> 10:54.200
This character, of course, was not originally intended to be Sauron.

10:54.200 --> 10:58.160
The necromancer, according to Tolkien, was hardly more than to provide a reason for Gandalf

10:58.160 --> 11:01.920
going away and leaving Bilbo and the dwarves to fend for themselves, which was necessary

11:01.920 --> 11:03.120
for the tale.

11:03.120 --> 11:07.940
So I get why people defend that decision on the part of the filmmakers to include Sauron,

11:07.940 --> 11:13.720
but to state that that was Tolkien's original intent, that's pretty disingenuous.

11:13.720 --> 11:17.520
But the biggest problem was in keeping the same plot while making The Hobbit, also a

11:17.520 --> 11:19.740
tonal prequel to The Lord of the Rings.

11:19.740 --> 11:23.860
The Hobbit, the novel, has a wildly different tone from The Lord of the Rings.

11:23.860 --> 11:27.520
The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings take place in the same universe, but only nominally.

11:27.520 --> 11:31.700
Many if not most of the details of the history of Middle Earth existed only in sketch form,

11:31.700 --> 11:35.320
and Tolkien's beloved Silmarillion, which, yes, he'd started even before The Hobbit

11:35.320 --> 11:39.760
was published, would change dramatically as Tolkien developed The Lord of the Rings.

11:39.760 --> 11:43.320
But when The Hobbit was a success and Tolkien's publisher asked for a sequel, Tolkien didn't

11:43.320 --> 11:45.080
really know where he wanted to go with it.

11:45.080 --> 11:48.340
It took him several years to realize that the world of The Hobbit had effectively grown

11:48.340 --> 11:52.680
up when his children did, and he wanted to write an epic fantasy for adults.

11:52.680 --> 11:56.480
Because The Lord of the Rings both didn't hit the original target audience, children,

11:56.480 --> 11:58.160
but then again it did.

11:58.160 --> 12:02.000
Part of the reason why The Lord of the Rings feels more grown up is because his kids, and

12:02.000 --> 12:05.440
by extension the original kids who read it when it was published, were growing up with

12:05.440 --> 12:09.480
the stories, and Tolkien's oldest son Christopher was integral to the creation of the book.

12:09.480 --> 12:13.000
The Hobbit was a children's story written before any serious publisher would dare entertain

12:13.000 --> 12:15.440
the idea of epic fantasy literature for adults.

12:15.440 --> 12:19.560
It was published at a time where fantasy was either Le Petit Prance or Beowulf, and The

12:19.560 --> 12:23.520
Lord of the Rings, even twenty years later, was kind of a huge gamble, one that paid off

12:23.520 --> 12:26.480
right away and has never been out of print since.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.440
Tolkien wrote to a fan in 1955,

12:28.440 --> 12:32.600
It remains an unfailing delight to me to find my own belief justified, that the fairy story

12:32.600 --> 12:36.900
is really an adult genre, and one for which a starving audience exists.

12:36.900 --> 12:40.120
Both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were stories for Tolkien's children, but

12:40.120 --> 12:42.400
at different stages of life.

12:42.400 --> 12:46.960
So, you can either make a faithful adaptation of The Hobbit, one that is fun and clever

12:46.960 --> 12:51.340
and matches the child-like tone of the books, which were designed to be read aloud at storytime

12:51.340 --> 12:56.120
and even include quick asides for the reader, or you can make three three-hour prequels

12:56.120 --> 13:00.320
to Lord of the Rings that match the tone and epic scope of The Lord of the Rings.

13:00.320 --> 13:02.080
But they can't be the same thing.

13:02.080 --> 13:06.860
The Hobbit is about 95,000 words long, about 5,000 words shorter than the first Hunger

13:06.860 --> 13:10.860
Games book, and about 12,000 words longer than the first Harry Potter book.

13:10.860 --> 13:16.200
To compare, the Fellowship of the Ring alone is nearly twice that length at 177,000 words,

13:16.200 --> 13:20.840
with the entirety of The Lord of the Rings cashing in at about 1.5 Games of Thrones,

13:20.840 --> 13:22.680
and that doesn't even include the appendices.

13:22.680 --> 13:25.720
This is not to say that The Hobbit needed to be the same length as the first Hunger

13:25.720 --> 13:28.000
Games movie in order not to feel flabby.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.640
The Hobbit has an extremely minimalistic style for all that goes down in it, compared with

13:31.640 --> 13:34.760
the florid Lord of the Rings with its extreme attention to detail.

13:34.760 --> 13:39.260
Adapting The Hobbit as it is without adding any pauses for character development or pacing

13:39.260 --> 13:43.120
or worldbuilding would have made a film that felt incredibly rushed.

13:43.120 --> 13:46.500
Even though the book is Hunger Games short, a lot more goes down in it, and it would feel

13:46.500 --> 13:50.580
way too rushed as a 90-minute movie, or even one three-hour movie.

13:50.580 --> 13:54.600
So I think the initial pitch of two two-hour movies directed by Guillermo del Toro could

13:54.600 --> 13:59.080
have led to the creation of a great, original, memorable product, both in the spirit of the

13:59.080 --> 14:02.440
original novel, yet distinct from the Lord of the Rings film trilogy.

14:02.440 --> 14:06.960
Why does it hurt so much?

14:06.960 --> 14:14.280
Because it was real.

14:14.280 --> 14:22.160
Maybe they got that version of the Berenstain universe.

14:22.160 --> 14:26.060
To explore the challenges of adapting The Hobbit, first we must examine the structure.

14:26.060 --> 14:28.480
It has a beginning, middle, and end, kinda.

14:28.480 --> 14:31.720
But it doesn't really have the structure of a Hollywood screenplay, let alone three

14:31.720 --> 14:33.740
Hollywood screenplays.

14:33.740 --> 14:36.880
Compared to The Fellowship of the Ring, the book doesn't really have a three-act structure,

14:36.880 --> 14:41.360
per se, but without changing much, the film gets rid of the Tom Bombadil stuff.

14:41.360 --> 14:42.360
Good call, that.

14:42.360 --> 14:46.120
Has the end of Act 1 as Frodo leaving the Shire, and also has a really long Act 2, with

14:46.120 --> 14:51.720
the midpoint being Frodo taking the ring to Mordor, and Act 3 comprising a big action

14:51.720 --> 14:55.560
scene where Frodo escapes while Aragorn and the others fight the Uruk-hai, and Boromir

14:55.560 --> 14:58.220
gets a much more emotional death than he does in the book.

14:58.220 --> 15:02.120
Not a whole lot of rearranging needed to turn this into a three-act Hollywood structure.

15:02.120 --> 15:07.960
But The Hobbit is way more episodic, with the individual adventures rarely changing

15:07.960 --> 15:08.960
the quest.

15:08.960 --> 15:13.480
The book pulls a great deal from English folktales, fairy stories, epics, and Norse poems like

15:13.480 --> 15:17.840
Beowulf, so it includes elements that might otherwise feel out of place in a novel because

15:17.840 --> 15:19.400
of the story's basis.

15:19.440 --> 15:24.200
The points that feel out of nowhere are anticlimactic, like ascended extra bard killing the dragon

15:24.200 --> 15:29.240
instead of Bilbo or the dwarves, or Smaug having one weakness is very rooted in mythology

15:29.240 --> 15:32.320
and folk stories, Fafnir, Beowulf, Odysseus.

15:32.320 --> 15:36.080
And as it ends up in the movies, boy is it anticlimactic.

15:41.360 --> 15:45.700
This did not need to be so hideously anticlimactic, except for the way that they structured it.

15:45.700 --> 15:50.880
The third movie begins with the burning of Laketown, and Smaug dies before the opening

15:50.880 --> 15:51.880
title.

15:51.880 --> 15:54.540
This, like so many things, is a consequence of restructuring.

15:54.540 --> 15:59.760
Smaug's death should have been the midpoint of the second film, not the, um, prologue

15:59.760 --> 16:00.760
to the third?

16:00.760 --> 16:04.340
The structure of The Hobbit is episodic and meandering, not a lot of build like we see

16:04.340 --> 16:05.660
in The Lord of the Rings.

16:05.660 --> 16:10.020
Each chapter is a mini-adventure in which Bilbo either learns something, gets something,

16:10.020 --> 16:11.180
or earns respect.

16:11.180 --> 16:15.620
It is effectively designed to be read by adults, two children, one chapter per night.

16:15.620 --> 16:19.340
Leonard Nimoy's Ode to Bilbo Bagginsong captures this pretty well.

16:29.740 --> 16:33.660
The decision to split this book into three makes this into even more of a problem because

16:33.660 --> 16:39.180
we need to split this tiny book into Act 1, Act 2, and Act 3 three times.

16:39.180 --> 16:42.860
This results in adding mini-climaxes that don't go anywhere, character moments that

16:42.860 --> 16:46.940
come either too early or too late, and several elements that just don't translate.

16:46.940 --> 16:50.380
Bilbo has nothing to do during the Battle of Five Armies and is unconscious for most

16:50.380 --> 16:51.380
of it.

16:51.380 --> 16:53.940
This isn't so much a problem in the book as the Battle of Five Armies takes up all

16:53.940 --> 16:58.580
of like half a chapter, but they went and made it take two hours of a two-hour-and-forty-four-minute

16:58.580 --> 17:03.780
movie that relegates Bilbo into a minor role and most of the dwarves as glorified extras.

17:03.780 --> 17:07.060
But the worst problems don't arise because the book was a challenge to adapt.

17:07.060 --> 17:10.460
There was a good movie in this mess, if you edit out, like, half of it.

17:10.460 --> 17:13.860
It's the horrible structure problems that arise from the decision to split two films

17:13.860 --> 17:18.020
into three a matter of months before the first film was set to be released.

17:18.020 --> 17:22.100
So character beats need to be shuffled around not only according to the needs of adaptation,

17:22.100 --> 17:23.940
but according to the needs of film structures.

17:23.940 --> 17:28.140
So this moment, where Thorin finally respects Bilbo, happens here.

17:28.140 --> 17:32.260
I have never been so wrong in all my life.

17:32.260 --> 17:35.460
Rather than after Bilbo frees the dwarves in the barrels, where it was likely originally

17:35.460 --> 17:38.860
intended to have happened and where it makes more sense to have happened, because Bilbo

17:38.860 --> 17:42.080
had repeatedly proven himself to Thorin by that point.

17:42.080 --> 17:45.900
But in the final version, where Thorin has to respect Bilbo before the eagles rescue

17:45.900 --> 17:50.540
them, the one action Bilbo gets is to bum-rush an orc.

17:50.540 --> 17:53.220
Like a linebacker.

17:53.220 --> 17:56.340
And it makes that plot point weaker because Bilbo freeing the dwarves through his cunning

17:56.340 --> 17:59.180
and magic ring is what makes him valuable to the party.

17:59.180 --> 18:01.900
He doesn't think like them, and his wits are his greatest asset.

18:01.900 --> 18:06.700
So his prove-myself-to-Thorin moment being, like, a football tackle just makes a rushed

18:06.700 --> 18:08.340
moment all the weaker.

18:08.340 --> 18:10.140
Bilbo's not a linebacker.

18:10.140 --> 18:11.460
He's a hobbit.

18:11.460 --> 18:14.640
He's THE hobbit.

18:14.640 --> 18:18.940
And now Bilbo and Thorin's relationship has zero development throughout movie two.

18:18.940 --> 18:22.340
It's just kind of at a par, and then they have their falling out in three.

18:22.340 --> 18:27.460
When you decided to make three instead of two movies, isn't it hard to split in story

18:27.460 --> 18:29.740
arc from two into three?

18:29.740 --> 18:30.980
Well, it was actually better.

18:30.980 --> 18:35.140
I mean, we made that decision because it was going to be, we felt it was going to be a

18:35.140 --> 18:36.140
better shape.

18:36.140 --> 18:37.140
I mean, it was our decision.

18:37.140 --> 18:39.140
It wasn't a studio decision.

18:39.140 --> 18:40.140
Really?

18:40.140 --> 18:41.140
Really?

18:41.140 --> 18:45.380
I find that very hard to believe.

18:45.380 --> 18:50.020
The original first film was set to end once the party got to either Erebor or Laketown.

18:50.020 --> 18:54.240
Part two would have been getting into Erebor, everything with Smaug, and then Five Armies.

18:54.240 --> 18:59.660
So the nonsense climaxes of movies one and two, which involves so much...

18:59.660 --> 19:00.660
What?

19:00.660 --> 19:01.660
What?

19:01.660 --> 19:06.180
Our dwarves' heat was...

19:06.220 --> 19:08.220
Middle doesn't...

19:08.220 --> 19:10.220
What?

19:10.220 --> 19:12.220
What?

19:12.220 --> 19:15.900
The need for these contrived climaxes that add nothing to the overall narrative directly

19:15.900 --> 19:20.020
trace back to that 11th hour decision to turn two movies into three, because all movies

19:20.020 --> 19:21.020
are trilogies now.

19:21.020 --> 19:23.020
Is this two or three?

19:23.020 --> 19:24.020
Oh, it's three.

19:24.020 --> 19:25.020
Is this three?

19:25.020 --> 19:26.020
Yeah.

19:26.020 --> 19:27.020
It's three.

19:27.020 --> 19:28.020
There you go.

19:28.020 --> 19:30.340
It's that easy to be confused.

19:30.340 --> 19:32.420
And then there was the stuff they added.

19:32.420 --> 19:34.420
Oh, and the stuff they added.

19:34.660 --> 19:37.660
Aren't you going to search me?

19:37.660 --> 19:39.660
I could have anything down my trousers.

19:39.660 --> 19:42.860
Again, to compare to The Lord of the Rings, because we have to, they cut just as much

19:42.860 --> 19:47.260
out of the novels as they added into the films, and most of what they added was some expansion

19:47.260 --> 19:50.940
on material from the appendices, most notably Aragorn and Arwen.

19:50.940 --> 19:55.140
At the front, when Arwen rescues Frodo, is more of a change rather than an addition,

19:55.140 --> 19:57.060
and again a positive one in my opinion.

19:57.060 --> 20:01.180
In the book, Frodo is rescued by a character who never appears again, so making it Aragorn's

20:01.180 --> 20:04.140
one true love makes that plot point stronger.

20:04.140 --> 20:09.100
In The Two Towers, they also added a warg battle and Aragorn getting separated, and

20:09.100 --> 20:13.260
a bunch of scenes with Arwen and Arwen leaving and then coming back.

20:13.260 --> 20:16.900
Frodo and Sam have a tiff in The Return of the King, which, you know, I'm not a fan of,

20:16.900 --> 20:19.780
but I guess I get why they got it.

20:19.780 --> 20:22.920
Gollum framing Sam, which is kind of dumb, but okay.

20:22.920 --> 20:26.100
And then there's the scene at Asgiliath at the end of Two Towers that gives Frodo and

20:26.100 --> 20:30.940
Sam a climax in the second movie, and those are kind of like the only major additions.

20:30.940 --> 20:35.620
They cut out a few chapters, like Tom Bombadil and The Scouring of the Shire entirely, but

20:35.620 --> 20:38.540
they didn't add that much in the grand scheme.

20:38.540 --> 20:42.500
Here's some of the stuff they added to The Hobbit.

20:42.500 --> 20:50.780
The White Council, this orc mini-boss who's in all three films, fighting dragon priests,

20:50.780 --> 20:57.140
Evangeline Lily, Legolas fighting, that endlessly long barrel-reverchase scene between orcs

20:57.140 --> 21:02.980
and elves, and we're fighting, Kili is hot and he's in love, Gandalf and Galadriel...

21:02.980 --> 21:03.980
huh?

21:03.980 --> 21:08.980
Kill me, kill me, Ronin.

21:08.980 --> 21:16.440
Legolas fighting, Radagast the Brown, he's got poop on his head, useless framing device,

21:16.440 --> 21:22.220
the entire climax of Desolation, Evangeline Lily is in a love triangle, Legolas is sooooo

21:22.220 --> 21:26.980
cool, wow this framing device sure is going on forever, Bilbo linebacker, did they fuck?

21:27.020 --> 21:33.340
Side quest to Angmar that goes nowhere, Stephen Fry's horrible henchmen, what is happening?

21:33.340 --> 21:38.320
On-screen White Council scene, God, Alfred is awful, look at Legolas go, Bard the Bowman

21:38.320 --> 21:45.220
has a family now, Bjorn needed a bare chase scene, come with me, my lady, Gandalf, she's

21:45.220 --> 21:51.780
married, gratuitous Elijah Wood cameo, true love, and that's like not even half of it.

21:51.780 --> 22:00.260
This ties in with other adaptational problems, namely the problem of The Hobbit being so

22:00.260 --> 22:05.340
different and more childlike, read cartoonish, in tone than the more gritty adult Lord of

22:05.340 --> 22:06.340
the Rings.

22:06.340 --> 22:09.480
First, the Battle of Five Armies, just all of it.

22:09.480 --> 22:13.140
It takes up about half a chapter and Bilbo is unconscious, so of course this needed to

22:13.140 --> 22:17.200
be expanded, but the result is longer than the Battle of Helm's Deep, which itself started

22:17.200 --> 22:18.200
to drag in the run-up.

22:18.200 --> 22:19.780
I do not trust a hope.

22:19.780 --> 22:20.780
There is no hope.

22:20.780 --> 22:22.860
There is still hope.

22:22.860 --> 22:23.860
We get it.

22:23.860 --> 22:25.780
They say that it is hopeless.

22:25.780 --> 22:27.120
We get it.

22:27.120 --> 22:30.860
Another consequence of splitting two movies into three is that movie two needs a climax

22:30.860 --> 22:35.580
now, and that is how we got the escape from Smaug scene and the heat-resistant dwarves.

22:35.580 --> 22:39.500
It adds a gratuitous action scene that goes on forever, but adds absolutely nothing to

22:39.500 --> 22:40.500
the narrative plot-wise.

22:40.500 --> 22:45.380
Smaug was going to go destroy Lake Town either way, so this action scene is bereft of tension

22:45.380 --> 22:46.680
in every regard.

22:46.680 --> 22:49.080
This is a problem in a lot of recent films.

22:49.080 --> 22:53.000
Studio will mandate X number of action scenes, but these action scenes either have no tension,

22:53.000 --> 22:56.600
either in the macro sense of how they advance the plot, or in the momentary sense of whether

22:56.600 --> 23:00.600
the characters get through or not, and whether we, the audience, care.

23:00.600 --> 23:04.520
This is particularly problematic in that the dwarves seem utterly resistant to dragon fire

23:04.520 --> 23:06.240
and to heat in general.

23:06.240 --> 23:10.360
So there is no physical danger to them, so...

23:10.360 --> 23:11.360
Why...

23:11.360 --> 23:12.360
Thorin?

23:13.040 --> 23:17.080
Thorin, you know metal is a conductor, right?

23:17.080 --> 23:20.440
There is a similar problem in the scene where the dwarves escape the elves.

23:20.440 --> 23:25.040
It has a plot-related tension of escape, but the action is so absurd that you can't really

23:25.040 --> 23:26.680
feel for these guys.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.700
They appear to be made of rubber.

23:28.700 --> 23:30.960
They don't seem to have any mortality.

23:30.960 --> 23:34.080
Healy gets shot by an arrow, and that's sad and hurts him.

23:34.080 --> 23:41.680
But meanwhile, this is happening.

23:41.680 --> 23:45.000
The cartoons barrel boing boing, all in the same scene.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.920
Are these guys impervious or not?

23:46.920 --> 23:49.880
And if they are impervious, then where's the tension?

23:49.880 --> 23:51.920
And then there was the storm giants.

23:51.920 --> 23:54.400
This is no thunderstorm.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.320
It's a thunder battle.

23:56.320 --> 23:59.160
Oh, the storm giants.

23:59.160 --> 24:03.880
So like Five Armies takes up about half a chapter, the storm giants, a five minute scene,

24:03.880 --> 24:06.240
takes up about half a sentence.

24:06.240 --> 24:08.460
Here's the sentence.

24:08.460 --> 24:12.340
And according to The Annotated Hobbit, most Tolkien scholars don't think of storm giants

24:12.340 --> 24:16.740
as like, alternate fantasy creatures that we haven't seen yet.

24:16.740 --> 24:19.400
They're, you know, they're just trolls.

24:19.400 --> 24:23.260
Cave trolls, troll trolls, trolls that like to play in the rain and throw rocks.

24:23.260 --> 24:28.580
You know, the fun kind of troll, not the internet kind.

24:28.580 --> 24:31.900
But speaking of cave troll, there is a scene in Fellowship that this reminds me of.

24:31.900 --> 24:35.700
We're in the mines of Moria, we've just found out how Balin and all of the dwarves there

24:35.700 --> 24:36.700
died.

24:36.700 --> 24:44.340
And then Pippin inadvertently causes an extended action scene that goes on for about 20 minutes

24:44.340 --> 24:45.620
and ends with Gandalf's death.

24:45.620 --> 24:49.460
You see what I mean about action scenes should advance the plot?

24:49.460 --> 24:51.060
Anyway.

24:51.060 --> 25:04.620
Before this scene, we've set up the Mithril armor, which Bilbo got from Thorin and the

25:04.620 --> 25:06.460
Hobbit and Gibbs to Frodo.

25:06.460 --> 25:08.740
During the scene, Frodo gets stabbed by the troll.

25:08.740 --> 25:15.080
Everyone's like, oh no, he dead, but ah wait, remember that Mithril armor.

25:15.080 --> 25:18.940
So with the storm giant scene, again we're straining believability by oscillating between

25:18.940 --> 25:24.020
the mortal, Bilbo hanging from a ledge and needing a rescue, and the cartoonish, literally

25:24.020 --> 25:30.940
everything else in the scene.

25:30.940 --> 25:35.480
It culminates in this moment, they're on the knee of a giant who ostensibly smashes

25:35.480 --> 25:41.800
them into the side of a cliff, but no, they're fine.

25:41.800 --> 25:48.940
See they're fine, whatever, let's go.

25:48.940 --> 25:52.620
Unlike the troll scene in Fellowship, where Frodo reveals the Mithril armor, there is

25:52.620 --> 25:53.800
no payoff here.

25:53.800 --> 25:58.160
No one's skill that had been set up in an earlier scene saves them, it's just a wildly

25:58.160 --> 26:00.840
unlikely coincidence that they survive.

26:00.840 --> 26:03.200
Action that goes nowhere and advances nothing.

26:03.200 --> 26:07.360
So unlike with Rings, where we have a constant sense of mortality and the physical pain these

26:07.360 --> 26:13.000
characters are going through, in The Hobbit it's like action figures being smashed together.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.040
There's never any real sense of danger.

26:15.040 --> 26:18.620
When they get caught by goblins, Gandalf shows up and they cut through them like butter.

26:18.620 --> 26:22.000
And to be clear, this is not about knowing what the outcome of the scene is just because

26:22.000 --> 26:23.040
you've read the book.

26:23.040 --> 26:27.100
You can still feel tension as an audience member, even if you already know what the

26:27.100 --> 26:28.920
outcome of the scene is.

26:28.920 --> 26:33.000
And there's nothing wrong with a playful cartoony tone in and of itself, but it's

26:33.000 --> 26:37.200
really hard to include that in a narrative that also has these dramatic moments of physical

26:37.200 --> 26:38.360
danger.

26:38.360 --> 26:44.440
If this doesn't kill them, and that doesn't kill them, and that doesn't kill them, then

26:44.440 --> 26:46.380
what would?

26:46.380 --> 26:50.080
In order to maintain tension, the rules of the universe have to be consistent, and we

26:50.080 --> 26:52.700
need to believe that these characters are in danger.

26:52.700 --> 26:56.720
It goes without saying Bilbo and Gandalf surviving, for instance, is a foregone conclusion that

26:56.720 --> 26:57.840
can't be helped.

26:57.840 --> 27:01.040
But there are ways to build tension in an already popular story.

27:01.080 --> 27:05.000
Fellowship of the Ring takes a character like Boromir, and it fleshes him out with an understandable

27:05.000 --> 27:08.960
personal conflict and friendship with the hobbits, so that when he does die, it feels

27:08.960 --> 27:13.320
way more upsetting and meaningful and, well, human than it did in the book.

27:13.320 --> 27:17.640
Tolkien didn't really care about Boromir as a character, but Jackson and his co-writers

27:17.640 --> 27:22.000
keyed into his humanity, and the result is one of the strongest, most memorable performances

27:22.000 --> 27:23.540
in all three films.

27:23.540 --> 27:28.340
The entire character of Boromir is an excellent example of the way movies can improve upon

27:28.340 --> 27:29.340
their source material.

27:30.100 --> 27:31.100
Believe it.

27:31.100 --> 27:32.700
It is over.

27:32.700 --> 27:34.100
But these are all style choices.

27:34.100 --> 27:38.460
To me, the biggest issue with the hobbit movies was instead of letting the movies be The Hobbit,

27:44.060 --> 27:46.900
the biggest mess in all three films is the attempt to make the central conflict in The

27:46.900 --> 27:50.420
Hobbit directly tied in with the central conflict of The Lord of the Rings.

27:50.420 --> 27:54.540
Because it just isn't, except maybe in that really, really distant Silmarillion way where

27:54.540 --> 28:00.380
all bad things like dragons and orcs, et cetera, all originate from the same bad one dude.

28:00.380 --> 28:04.940
By the way, if you want to go down a fun rabbit hole, Google image search Sauron Melkor fan

28:04.940 --> 28:05.940
art.

28:05.940 --> 28:06.940
It is a trip.

28:06.940 --> 28:09.580
Even in Tolkien's awkward retrofit where we find out that the necromancer was Sauron

28:09.580 --> 28:13.580
the whole time, it's almost completely irrelevant to the conflict in The Hobbit.

28:13.580 --> 28:17.300
Gandalf mentions that Sauron is over here somewhere in the Fellowship of the Ring, but

28:17.300 --> 28:20.940
it doesn't really mean anything to either narrative except for helping Gandalf put two

28:20.940 --> 28:23.420
and two together when Bilbo starts acting weird.

28:25.540 --> 28:30.580
So their solution was to double down on what was, even to Tolkien, kind of a contrived

28:30.580 --> 28:37.140
throwaway line to get Gandalf out of the picture.

28:37.140 --> 28:40.440
It works in a children's story, but when you take a plot device to get Gandalf away

28:40.440 --> 28:49.700
from the party and then try to develop it into this lush world building, still there

28:49.700 --> 28:52.140
had to be a better way to make this work.

28:52.740 --> 28:56.700
Ultimately, there is a rising darkness in the form of the goblins and the dragons and

28:56.700 --> 29:00.500
the whole thrust of the battle at the end is everyone fighting each other over a petty

29:00.500 --> 29:03.860
treasure when there is a real existential threat to all of them.

29:03.860 --> 29:09.340
See, the reveal of the necromancer's identity doesn't actually matter in this story because

29:09.340 --> 29:11.700
he doesn't really do anything.

29:11.700 --> 29:16.320
This only matters to the audience who recognizes this character from Lord of the Rings.

29:16.320 --> 29:20.240
What it is in the book is Gandalf's discovery of the orc army, which we later find out is

29:20.240 --> 29:21.960
commanded by Sauron.

29:21.960 --> 29:25.680
If we wanted to keep Sauron here, sure, have it be that angle.

29:25.680 --> 29:30.160
But the problem is they're already being pursued by orcs from the minute go, way before

29:30.160 --> 29:32.400
we learn that the necromancer is Sauron.

29:32.400 --> 29:37.080
A different orc army, not to be confused with this orc army, you know, the one with the

29:37.080 --> 29:38.860
worms of Arrakis.

29:38.860 --> 29:42.440
But as it is in the final product, the reveal of Sauron is completely meaningless.

29:42.440 --> 29:46.200
But it could have flown in better thematically into the Lord of the Rings.

29:46.200 --> 29:50.880
Darkness rising, stop fighting over stupid shit y'all, it's only gonna get worse.

29:51.200 --> 29:55.300
More focus is placed on shoehorning in these plot elements and characters from rings, which

29:55.300 --> 29:58.040
makes it just feel flabby and awkward.

29:58.040 --> 30:01.960
There's one bit in the appendices with Christopher Lee that breaks my heart a little bit.

30:01.960 --> 30:07.900
If it means something in the story, and it's what the director wants.

30:07.900 --> 30:11.880
So you're using the staff in the hand like, so yep, yep, perfect.

30:11.880 --> 30:17.800
And the audience remembers it, that's what it's all about.

30:17.800 --> 30:21.600
Lee and Jackson kind of parted on bad terms after the Lord of the Rings, since Sauron's

30:21.600 --> 30:25.120
conclusion was cut from Return of the King in the theatrical cut.

30:25.120 --> 30:26.920
But he is here for this.

30:26.920 --> 30:28.320
And he's excited to be here.

30:28.320 --> 30:32.640
And he loves this idea of playing pre-corruption Sauron and going after Sauron.

30:32.640 --> 30:35.280
Leave Sauron to me.

30:35.280 --> 30:39.320
One of the very few good moments in the Battle of Five Armies.

30:39.320 --> 30:44.200
Leave Sauron to me.

30:44.200 --> 30:45.200
And he means it.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.960
And this just makes me sad.

30:47.960 --> 30:53.280
Because that idea, that angle, that passion that Lee has, in a scene that on the whole

30:53.280 --> 30:59.960
is so unnecessary and confusing and goofy and Gandalf and Galadriel, what are you doing?

30:59.960 --> 31:04.720
Perhaps in another life, if only wizards and elves could procreate.

31:04.720 --> 31:06.680
It's just wasted here.

31:06.680 --> 31:09.480
And that, I think, is the essence of these movies.

31:09.480 --> 31:13.940
Moments of brilliance wasted in a product that, on the whole, tries to have it all ways

31:13.940 --> 31:17.260
and in the process just pulls itself apart at the seams.

31:17.260 --> 31:21.460
But there's one element in particular, a small one, but to me it encapsulates the clumsily

31:21.460 --> 31:24.060
slapped together new ending to movie one.

31:24.060 --> 31:27.660
It's not the Bilbo bum rush, but this right here.

31:33.100 --> 31:34.100
Did you catch it?

31:34.100 --> 31:35.100
Here, I'll play it again.

31:43.940 --> 31:49.540
That's...

31:49.540 --> 31:52.620
That's the Ringwraith theme.

31:52.620 --> 32:06.740
Like, you know, things mean things.

32:06.740 --> 32:09.140
Musical motifs especially mean things.

32:09.140 --> 32:12.940
That wasn't Sauron's theme, it wasn't Gollum's theme.

32:12.940 --> 32:16.620
That was, specifically, the Ringwraith theme from Fellowship.

32:16.620 --> 32:20.620
I know you know this, Howard Shore, Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens, all of whom put

32:20.620 --> 32:23.080
so much thought and effort into The Lord of the Rings.

32:23.080 --> 32:25.740
You explained it to me back in 2001.

32:25.740 --> 32:29.840
Revelation of the Ringwraiths is a poem that Philippa Boyens wrote, because in the case

32:29.840 --> 32:40.220
of this it was translated into Andunaic, which was the ancient speech of man.

32:40.220 --> 32:44.260
And here you are, just slapping on whatever ominous-sounding music, because you decided

32:44.260 --> 32:48.060
it should be three films in October, and it's being released in December, and Howard Shore

32:48.060 --> 32:54.020
didn't have time to compose something new.

32:54.020 --> 32:56.980
I get that they didn't have the time that they had for Rings, and Jackson didn't really

32:56.980 --> 33:00.980
want to direct, and he was tapped out and exhausted the whole time.

33:00.980 --> 33:02.740
But it really shows.

33:02.740 --> 33:06.380
So maybe it isn't just my nostalgia that it didn't do it for me the way The Lord of the

33:06.380 --> 33:07.380
Rings did.

33:07.660 --> 33:11.980
There's just so much that doesn't work here, and it's pretty easy to pinpoint.

33:11.980 --> 33:14.260
The question is, why?

33:14.260 --> 33:17.260
It isn't like some outside studio hack swooped in and took over.

33:17.260 --> 33:21.220
The Hobbit has almost entirely the same creative team and the same cast as The Lord of the

33:21.220 --> 33:22.220
Rings.

33:22.220 --> 33:27.980
We are very much going to be the same storytellers making this sort of six series story, six

33:27.980 --> 33:28.980
six film series.

33:28.980 --> 33:33.640
There are some genuinely great creative choices unique to this trilogy, and the new cast is

33:33.640 --> 33:36.960
both brilliant and distinct from the cast of The Lord of the Rings, when they aren't

33:36.960 --> 33:40.560
characters from The Lord of the Rings that are awkwardly shoehorned in, anyway.

33:40.560 --> 33:44.000
And yet, I kind of long for death.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.920
I recall looking back at the extended DVDs of The Lord of the Rings, how watching all

33:47.920 --> 33:52.520
those extras inspired interest and passion in the filmmaking process and added an extra

33:52.520 --> 33:57.040
layer of enjoyment to the films themselves, seeing how by no means no, the making of The

33:57.040 --> 34:00.840
Lord of the Rings was not easy, but everyone was here for it.

34:00.840 --> 34:04.000
And that passion comes through in the final product.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.760
And I look at The Hobbit and I'm just, I'm just tired.

34:07.760 --> 34:11.520
Like I see these extra features, the care and pain taken to create what was brought

34:11.520 --> 34:17.580
to the screen, that each movie has ten hours of extras, and I'm just like, I don't care.

34:17.580 --> 34:21.360
And I find myself struggling to remember what moved me so deeply about The Lord of the Rings

34:21.360 --> 34:25.020
in the first place if so many of the elements are going to affect the same.

34:25.020 --> 34:27.220
These movies just, they make me feel drained.

34:27.220 --> 34:31.380
I don't hate them, I just, I feel nothing.

34:31.380 --> 34:35.460
And I find myself unable to remember why I was so passionate about The Lord of the Rings

34:35.460 --> 34:37.700
and the works of Tolkien in the first place.

34:41.840 --> 34:47.620
Is there a way to un-grow up, be like young Scout Finch, see through that naive worldview

34:47.620 --> 34:52.540
where we can look up to the things that we loved as kids and absolutes?

34:52.540 --> 34:54.540
Can you ever really go home again?

34:55.020 --> 34:59.020
Or must we all, like Frodo, eventually go into the West?

35:05.420 --> 35:11.500
The reason why some of us respond so emotionally to media is because media helped shape us as kids.

35:11.500 --> 35:15.220
We all have a first love in movies, and The Lord of the Rings was one of mine.

35:15.220 --> 35:20.580
So no matter how, quote, mature, end quote, you become in your consumption of media, there's

35:20.580 --> 35:24.380
always going to be some part of you that desires not to see your childhood passions

35:24.380 --> 35:29.700
through the eyes of an adult, but instead to recapture what ignited our passions as kids.

35:29.700 --> 35:35.700
But maybe, now that I'm an adult with an expendable income, I can make a journey to find the answers

35:35.700 --> 35:40.700
to my questions, and see if perhaps that magic can be recaptured.

35:42.700 --> 35:43.700
Lindsay, wait!

35:50.580 --> 35:59.580
Go back, Nilla!

35:59.580 --> 36:02.580
I'm going to New Zealand alone!

36:02.580 --> 36:04.580
Of course you are!

36:04.580 --> 36:06.580
And I'm coming with you!

36:20.580 --> 36:22.580
Thanks for watching!
