00:00.000 --> 00:06.720
Hey, everybody! It seems like it is time for X-Men movie number 11-D or so.

00:06.720 --> 00:12.120
So I thought this was a good opportunity to run through one of the most famous attributes of the X-Men,

00:12.120 --> 00:14.320
dying and coming back to life.

00:14.320 --> 00:17.320
So, this is going to be a quick rundown of that history,

00:17.320 --> 00:20.480
sticking mostly to the Marvel 616 universe.

00:20.480 --> 00:21.920
May it rest in peace.

00:21.920 --> 00:25.200
One of the first oopsie-daisy not-deads was Professor X himself,

00:25.200 --> 00:28.720
who dies in an explosion during battle.

00:28.720 --> 00:34.520
But, uh, no, it turns out the professor had arranged for a shape-shifting mutant named Changeling to impersonate him.

00:34.520 --> 00:36.640
So it was actually Changeling that died.

00:36.640 --> 00:40.120
During House of M, the Scarlet Witch basically wishes him out of existence,

00:40.120 --> 00:41.880
and obviously that didn't stick.

00:41.880 --> 00:44.440
And during the Avengers vs. X-Men storyline,

00:44.440 --> 00:48.000
Xavier goes into battle with a V-Phoenix, Cyclops, and Emma Frost,

00:48.000 --> 00:50.080
dying in the ensuing Phoenix Flames.

00:50.080 --> 00:53.920
We even see him in the afterlife later when the X-Men go into it to rescue Nightcrawler.

00:53.960 --> 00:58.840
So he's dead, but also part of his psyche is lodged into the Red Skull, so only sort of.

00:58.840 --> 01:01.520
And then, of course, there is my bae, Nightcrawler.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.320
Oh my god, I just said bae and I'm in my thirties.

01:03.320 --> 01:04.680
Well, anyway, he only died once.

01:04.680 --> 01:07.920
So there's this mutant named Hope, who may or may not be some kind of

01:07.920 --> 01:10.880
Jean Grey Daughter clone, whatever.

01:10.880 --> 01:15.440
Anyway, she's important, so during the Second Coming event, Nightcrawler dies to save her.

01:15.440 --> 01:18.960
He's still helped out while dead because he is the best.

01:18.960 --> 01:23.120
When Wolverine is possessed by a demon called the Hellverine...

01:24.640 --> 01:25.120
Yeah.

01:25.120 --> 01:29.120
Nightcrawler enters his friend's mind from beyond to help him drive out the invader.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.680
But was it him or a figment of Wolverine's imagination?

01:31.680 --> 01:33.760
We don't know, but probably it was him.

01:33.760 --> 01:37.440
But when Azazel invades the afterlife, Nightcrawler gets bored of being dead,

01:37.440 --> 01:41.760
picks up a pirate hat and sword, and takes control of a ghost pirate ship.

01:41.760 --> 01:43.760
It's actually pretty awesome.

01:43.760 --> 01:49.200
And comes back to life by creating a body out of smushed together demon parts,

01:49.200 --> 01:50.960
who are also his minions now.

01:50.960 --> 01:54.000
Unlike Nightcrawler, who only has one death and resurrection under his belt,

01:54.000 --> 01:55.440
Psylocke has several.

01:55.440 --> 01:57.920
Psylocke, who was born a British white lady,

01:57.920 --> 02:01.200
had a body switch with a Japanese ninja named Kwannon,

02:01.200 --> 02:04.320
and her original white lady body died of this legacy virus.

02:04.320 --> 02:09.200
And that is why she is a Japanese body with a white lady's soul in it.

02:09.200 --> 02:14.720
And also, she took the name Lady Mandarin, despite being Japanese.

02:14.720 --> 02:17.760
There was also an incident where she very nearly died because of Sabretooth,

02:17.760 --> 02:20.880
but we're not going to count that one because she didn't quite die.

02:20.880 --> 02:22.000
She just almost died.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.160
She died yet again while protecting Rogue and Beast from a villain named Vargas,

02:26.160 --> 02:29.280
only to be resurrected a year later by her brother Jamie,

02:29.280 --> 02:33.040
who reached back in time and prevented her spirit from entering the afterlife.

02:33.040 --> 02:35.200
So that's like a technical almost not-death anyway.

02:35.200 --> 02:40.960
The legacy virus was Marvel's 90s HIV allegory, for better or worse.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.520
Another casualty of the legacy virus was Colossus,

02:43.520 --> 02:47.680
who sacrificed himself nobly to release the cure for the legacy virus into the air,

02:47.680 --> 02:52.080
which could only be made airborne with the death of its first user into the world.

02:52.080 --> 02:52.880
Such noble.

02:52.880 --> 02:53.680
So that's that.

02:53.680 --> 02:54.800
Actually, no!

02:54.800 --> 02:58.000
Joss Whedon wanted Colossus back for his Astonishing X-Men series,

02:58.000 --> 03:02.160
so it turns out that this evil alien named Ord had stolen Colossus's body

03:02.160 --> 03:04.560
right after his death, replaced it with a duplicate body,

03:04.560 --> 03:06.560
and that was cremated in his place.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.320
And then he resurrected the real deal.

03:08.320 --> 03:13.280
As for Magneto, we gotta go way back, all the way back to the Asteroid M incident.

03:13.280 --> 03:16.320
He appears to be dead here, but nope, he survived that,

03:16.320 --> 03:20.400
and he popped up months later, having been encased in a protective shell.

03:20.400 --> 03:24.320
Years later, we see him die as the mutant nation of Genosha was laid to waste,

03:24.320 --> 03:26.000
so then he's gone for a while.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.360
Turns out, nope, he used that as an opportunity to infiltrate the X-Men

03:29.360 --> 03:31.920
by assuming the identity of a guy named Zorn,

03:31.920 --> 03:34.320
and after revealing himself and killing Jean Grey,

03:34.320 --> 03:36.480
he himself is killed again.

03:36.480 --> 03:37.600
But no!

03:37.600 --> 03:40.080
Marvel was not thrilled with the direction this book was taking

03:40.080 --> 03:41.920
and reversed it basically immediately.

03:41.920 --> 03:44.960
Turns out that wasn't Magneto, but actually a guy named Zorn

03:44.960 --> 03:46.480
who thought he was Magneto,

03:46.480 --> 03:48.800
except that there is also a real guy named Zorn,

03:48.800 --> 03:51.200
who is this Zorn's brother,

03:51.200 --> 03:55.360
and he was also being held captive somewhere to Zorns.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.320
Which is two Zorns more than we need.

03:59.120 --> 03:59.840
You know what? Forget it.

03:59.840 --> 04:00.560
Magneto's fine.

04:00.560 --> 04:03.200
He started a new mutant group back on the ruins of Genosha

04:03.200 --> 04:04.640
with his old buddy Xavier.

04:04.640 --> 04:09.120
Because the real Magneto would never genocide anyone.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.840
Storm died in a plane crash,

04:11.840 --> 04:16.160
only nope, her death was faked by villains named Nanny and Orphan Maker.

04:16.160 --> 04:19.840
They happened to have on hand a high-tech android replica of Storm's corpse,

04:19.840 --> 04:21.760
and it was also designed by Tony Stark?

04:22.640 --> 04:23.360
Okay.

04:23.360 --> 04:27.680
This was all done with the intention of regressing Storm to childhood, BT-dubs.

04:27.680 --> 04:30.160
Anyway, the real deal pops up a couple issues later.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.520
Now, plus amnesia!

04:31.520 --> 04:34.800
Storm died again when they all died!

04:34.800 --> 04:38.400
Dazzler, Longshot, Wolverine, Storm, Colossus, Psylocke, Rogue, Havoc,

04:38.400 --> 04:41.680
and Madeline Pryor, who was originally her own person,

04:41.680 --> 04:44.320
but then it turns out she was like a clone of Jean Grey-

04:44.320 --> 04:45.520
You know what? We're just not gonna go there.

04:45.520 --> 04:48.720
All died during the battle in Dallas versus the Adversary.

04:48.720 --> 04:52.000
They had to sacrifice their souls to stop the thing.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.600
But then an ally named Roma used magic and brought them back because she could.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.520
But they all have to pretend to be dead for a while.

04:57.520 --> 04:58.640
Hashtag reasons.

04:58.640 --> 05:01.760
But everyone, namely Kitty Pryde and Nightcrawler, thought that they were dead,

05:01.760 --> 05:05.680
and so those two went off and formed Excalibur, which was awesome.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.760
That was one of the times that Wolverine died,

05:07.840 --> 05:10.080
and if you've watched the Daredevil TV series,

05:10.080 --> 05:13.840
you know that the hand is like a mysterious group of ninjas

05:13.840 --> 05:17.440
that returns people from the dead, but evil.

05:18.320 --> 05:19.680
That is a thing in the comics.

05:19.680 --> 05:23.120
They did this to both Wolverine and Northstar, but they both got better.

05:23.120 --> 05:26.000
And like Xavier, Wolverine is dead presently.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.320
His death even got its own miniseries.

05:28.320 --> 05:32.480
Prior to death of Wolverine, a virus turned off Wolverine's healing factor.

05:32.480 --> 05:35.520
So after having been healing factor-less for a while,

05:35.520 --> 05:36.880
he self-sacrificially...

05:36.880 --> 05:38.240
Are we sensing a theme here?

05:38.240 --> 05:42.000
Dies from being covered in adamantium and then suffocating from it.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.800
Self-sacrifice and a beautiful metaphor sunset.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.080
I'm sure he won't be back.

05:46.640 --> 05:49.360
And of course, cliche of cliches, Phoenix.

05:49.360 --> 05:52.880
Jean Grey was originally Marvel Girl until the day she sacrifices herself

05:52.880 --> 05:54.560
for the lives of the other X-Men,

05:54.560 --> 05:57.680
ostensibly dying but then immediately returning as Phoenix

05:57.680 --> 06:00.400
with a new sexy outfit and fabulous voluminous hair.

06:01.040 --> 06:04.160
That was fun, but some of the Marvel heads felt she was too powerful.

06:04.160 --> 06:06.880
So along comes the world-destroying Dark Phoenix,

06:06.880 --> 06:08.480
who once again has to die,

06:08.480 --> 06:11.760
so she sacrifices herself more for permanent this time.

06:11.760 --> 06:14.800
So aside from some Jean-alikes, she's gone for more than a decade,

06:14.800 --> 06:17.360
but it turns out that this wasn't Jean.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.840
The Phoenix Force actually placed Jean in a protective cocoon

06:19.840 --> 06:21.040
on the bottom of Jamaica Bay,

06:21.040 --> 06:23.280
and that Phoenix was actually a Phoenix Force,

06:23.280 --> 06:26.640
hearing Jean's cry and her feelings and her passion and love for her friends,

06:26.640 --> 06:29.120
and it wanted to see what this whole being human thing was about,

06:29.120 --> 06:36.160
so it put the original Jean into a pod at the bottom of Jamaica Bay,

06:36.160 --> 06:39.440
so Dark Phoenix was a clone, duplicate.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.280
Like, it was Jean, and it wasn't...

06:41.280 --> 06:45.200
So it's more accurate to say that Jean didn't get resurrected so much

06:45.200 --> 06:47.760
as there were two, and one died, and one didn't,

06:47.760 --> 06:50.400
and also inherited Copy A's memories.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.840
During Grant Morrison's new X-Men,

06:51.840 --> 06:53.840
she assumes again the powers of the Phoenix Force,

06:53.840 --> 06:55.520
now under her complete control,

06:55.520 --> 06:57.280
only to be killed by Magneto,

06:57.280 --> 06:59.520
who actually wasn't Magneto, as we discussed,

06:59.520 --> 07:01.520
and who was then beheaded by Wolverine.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.040
That wasn't quite the end of it.

07:03.040 --> 07:04.480
In X-Men Phoenix End Song,

07:04.480 --> 07:07.440
the Phoenix resurrects Jean for one hot second again,

07:07.440 --> 07:08.640
but it doesn't quite stick,

07:08.640 --> 07:10.560
and she moves on to a higher plane of existence

07:10.560 --> 07:14.080
and is generally self-sacrificing some more.

07:14.080 --> 07:15.600
And that is definitely our big theme

07:15.600 --> 07:18.320
with the whole X-Men dying and then coming back to life thing.

07:18.320 --> 07:22.000
Self-sacrifice means you're Jesus, so it's not permanent.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.720
X-Men continuity is convoluted and hack and slash and bendy

07:26.720 --> 07:29.280
and timey-wimey because there's so many characters

07:29.280 --> 07:31.200
and so many creators butting heads

07:31.200 --> 07:33.120
as to who should go in what direction.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.560
Are there any X-Men characters

07:34.560 --> 07:35.760
that I didn't mention in the episode?

07:35.760 --> 07:37.360
Feel free to list them in the comments,

07:37.360 --> 07:40.320
and we will see you next time with a full episode.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.040
Be careful about your self-sacrifice.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.240
Good night and good luck.
