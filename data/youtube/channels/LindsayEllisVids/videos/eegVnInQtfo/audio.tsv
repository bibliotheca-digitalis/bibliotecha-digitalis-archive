0	6720	Hey, everybody! It seems like it is time for X-Men movie number 11-D or so.
6720	12120	So I thought this was a good opportunity to run through one of the most famous attributes of the X-Men,
12120	14320	dying and coming back to life.
14320	17320	So, this is going to be a quick rundown of that history,
17320	20480	sticking mostly to the Marvel 616 universe.
20480	21920	May it rest in peace.
21920	25200	One of the first oopsie-daisy not-deads was Professor X himself,
25200	28720	who dies in an explosion during battle.
28720	34520	But, uh, no, it turns out the professor had arranged for a shape-shifting mutant named Changeling to impersonate him.
34520	36640	So it was actually Changeling that died.
36640	40120	During House of M, the Scarlet Witch basically wishes him out of existence,
40120	41880	and obviously that didn't stick.
41880	44440	And during the Avengers vs. X-Men storyline,
44440	48000	Xavier goes into battle with a V-Phoenix, Cyclops, and Emma Frost,
48000	50080	dying in the ensuing Phoenix Flames.
50080	53920	We even see him in the afterlife later when the X-Men go into it to rescue Nightcrawler.
53960	58840	So he's dead, but also part of his psyche is lodged into the Red Skull, so only sort of.
58840	61520	And then, of course, there is my bae, Nightcrawler.
61520	63320	Oh my god, I just said bae and I'm in my thirties.
63320	64680	Well, anyway, he only died once.
64680	67920	So there's this mutant named Hope, who may or may not be some kind of
67920	70880	Jean Grey Daughter clone, whatever.
70880	75440	Anyway, she's important, so during the Second Coming event, Nightcrawler dies to save her.
75440	78960	He's still helped out while dead because he is the best.
78960	83120	When Wolverine is possessed by a demon called the Hellverine...
84640	85120	Yeah.
85120	89120	Nightcrawler enters his friend's mind from beyond to help him drive out the invader.
89120	91680	But was it him or a figment of Wolverine's imagination?
91680	93760	We don't know, but probably it was him.
93760	97440	But when Azazel invades the afterlife, Nightcrawler gets bored of being dead,
97440	101760	picks up a pirate hat and sword, and takes control of a ghost pirate ship.
101760	103760	It's actually pretty awesome.
103760	109200	And comes back to life by creating a body out of smushed together demon parts,
109200	110960	who are also his minions now.
110960	114000	Unlike Nightcrawler, who only has one death and resurrection under his belt,
114000	115440	Psylocke has several.
115440	117920	Psylocke, who was born a British white lady,
117920	121200	had a body switch with a Japanese ninja named Kwannon,
121200	124320	and her original white lady body died of this legacy virus.
124320	129200	And that is why she is a Japanese body with a white lady's soul in it.
129200	134720	And also, she took the name Lady Mandarin, despite being Japanese.
134720	137760	There was also an incident where she very nearly died because of Sabretooth,
137760	140880	but we're not going to count that one because she didn't quite die.
140880	142000	She just almost died.
142000	146160	She died yet again while protecting Rogue and Beast from a villain named Vargas,
146160	149280	only to be resurrected a year later by her brother Jamie,
149280	153040	who reached back in time and prevented her spirit from entering the afterlife.
153040	155200	So that's like a technical almost not-death anyway.
155200	160960	The legacy virus was Marvel's 90s HIV allegory, for better or worse.
160960	163520	Another casualty of the legacy virus was Colossus,
163520	167680	who sacrificed himself nobly to release the cure for the legacy virus into the air,
167680	172080	which could only be made airborne with the death of its first user into the world.
172080	172880	Such noble.
172880	173680	So that's that.
173680	174800	Actually, no!
174800	178000	Joss Whedon wanted Colossus back for his Astonishing X-Men series,
178000	182160	so it turns out that this evil alien named Ord had stolen Colossus's body
182160	184560	right after his death, replaced it with a duplicate body,
184560	186560	and that was cremated in his place.
186560	188320	And then he resurrected the real deal.
188320	193280	As for Magneto, we gotta go way back, all the way back to the Asteroid M incident.
193280	196320	He appears to be dead here, but nope, he survived that,
196320	200400	and he popped up months later, having been encased in a protective shell.
200400	204320	Years later, we see him die as the mutant nation of Genosha was laid to waste,
204320	206000	so then he's gone for a while.
206000	209360	Turns out, nope, he used that as an opportunity to infiltrate the X-Men
209360	211920	by assuming the identity of a guy named Zorn,
211920	214320	and after revealing himself and killing Jean Grey,
214320	216480	he himself is killed again.
216480	217600	But no!
217600	220080	Marvel was not thrilled with the direction this book was taking
220080	221920	and reversed it basically immediately.
221920	224960	Turns out that wasn't Magneto, but actually a guy named Zorn
224960	226480	who thought he was Magneto,
226480	228800	except that there is also a real guy named Zorn,
228800	231200	who is this Zorn's brother,
231200	235360	and he was also being held captive somewhere to Zorns.
236800	238320	Which is two Zorns more than we need.
239120	239840	You know what? Forget it.
239840	240560	Magneto's fine.
240560	243200	He started a new mutant group back on the ruins of Genosha
243200	244640	with his old buddy Xavier.
244640	249120	Because the real Magneto would never genocide anyone.
250080	251840	Storm died in a plane crash,
251840	256160	only nope, her death was faked by villains named Nanny and Orphan Maker.
256160	259840	They happened to have on hand a high-tech android replica of Storm's corpse,
259840	261760	and it was also designed by Tony Stark?
262640	263360	Okay.
263360	267680	This was all done with the intention of regressing Storm to childhood, BT-dubs.
267680	270160	Anyway, the real deal pops up a couple issues later.
270160	271520	Now, plus amnesia!
271520	274800	Storm died again when they all died!
274800	278400	Dazzler, Longshot, Wolverine, Storm, Colossus, Psylocke, Rogue, Havoc,
278400	281680	and Madeline Pryor, who was originally her own person,
281680	284320	but then it turns out she was like a clone of Jean Grey-
284320	285520	You know what? We're just not gonna go there.
285520	288720	All died during the battle in Dallas versus the Adversary.
288720	292000	They had to sacrifice their souls to stop the thing.
292000	295600	But then an ally named Roma used magic and brought them back because she could.
295600	297520	But they all have to pretend to be dead for a while.
297520	298640	Hashtag reasons.
298640	301760	But everyone, namely Kitty Pryde and Nightcrawler, thought that they were dead,
301760	305680	and so those two went off and formed Excalibur, which was awesome.
305680	307760	That was one of the times that Wolverine died,
307840	310080	and if you've watched the Daredevil TV series,
310080	313840	you know that the hand is like a mysterious group of ninjas
313840	317440	that returns people from the dead, but evil.
318320	319680	That is a thing in the comics.
319680	323120	They did this to both Wolverine and Northstar, but they both got better.
323120	326000	And like Xavier, Wolverine is dead presently.
326000	328320	His death even got its own miniseries.
328320	332480	Prior to death of Wolverine, a virus turned off Wolverine's healing factor.
332480	335520	So after having been healing factor-less for a while,
335520	336880	he self-sacrificially...
336880	338240	Are we sensing a theme here?
338240	342000	Dies from being covered in adamantium and then suffocating from it.
342000	344800	Self-sacrifice and a beautiful metaphor sunset.
344800	346080	I'm sure he won't be back.
346640	349360	And of course, cliche of cliches, Phoenix.
349360	352880	Jean Grey was originally Marvel Girl until the day she sacrifices herself
352880	354560	for the lives of the other X-Men,
354560	357680	ostensibly dying but then immediately returning as Phoenix
357680	360400	with a new sexy outfit and fabulous voluminous hair.
361040	364160	That was fun, but some of the Marvel heads felt she was too powerful.
364160	366880	So along comes the world-destroying Dark Phoenix,
366880	368480	who once again has to die,
368480	371760	so she sacrifices herself more for permanent this time.
371760	374800	So aside from some Jean-alikes, she's gone for more than a decade,
374800	377360	but it turns out that this wasn't Jean.
377360	379840	The Phoenix Force actually placed Jean in a protective cocoon
379840	381040	on the bottom of Jamaica Bay,
381040	383280	and that Phoenix was actually a Phoenix Force,
383280	386640	hearing Jean's cry and her feelings and her passion and love for her friends,
386640	389120	and it wanted to see what this whole being human thing was about,
389120	396160	so it put the original Jean into a pod at the bottom of Jamaica Bay,
396160	399440	so Dark Phoenix was a clone, duplicate.
399440	401280	Like, it was Jean, and it wasn't...
401280	405200	So it's more accurate to say that Jean didn't get resurrected so much
405200	407760	as there were two, and one died, and one didn't,
407760	410400	and also inherited Copy A's memories.
410400	411840	During Grant Morrison's new X-Men,
411840	413840	she assumes again the powers of the Phoenix Force,
413840	415520	now under her complete control,
415520	417280	only to be killed by Magneto,
417280	419520	who actually wasn't Magneto, as we discussed,
419520	421520	and who was then beheaded by Wolverine.
421520	423040	That wasn't quite the end of it.
423040	424480	In X-Men Phoenix End Song,
424480	427440	the Phoenix resurrects Jean for one hot second again,
427440	428640	but it doesn't quite stick,
428640	430560	and she moves on to a higher plane of existence
430560	434080	and is generally self-sacrificing some more.
434080	435600	And that is definitely our big theme
435600	438320	with the whole X-Men dying and then coming back to life thing.
438320	442000	Self-sacrifice means you're Jesus, so it's not permanent.
442000	446720	X-Men continuity is convoluted and hack and slash and bendy
446720	449280	and timey-wimey because there's so many characters
449280	451200	and so many creators butting heads
451200	453120	as to who should go in what direction.
453120	454560	Are there any X-Men characters
454560	455760	that I didn't mention in the episode?
455760	457360	Feel free to list them in the comments,
457360	460320	and we will see you next time with a full episode.
460960	463040	Be careful about your self-sacrifice.
463040	464240	Good night and good luck.
