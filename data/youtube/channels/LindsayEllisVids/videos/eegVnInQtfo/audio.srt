1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
Hey, everybody! It seems like it is time for X-Men movie number 11-D or so.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,120
So I thought this was a good opportunity to run through one of the most famous attributes of the X-Men,

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,320
dying and coming back to life.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,320
So, this is going to be a quick rundown of that history,

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,480
sticking mostly to the Marvel 616 universe.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,920
May it rest in peace.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,200
One of the first oopsie-daisy not-deads was Professor X himself,

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,720
who dies in an explosion during battle.

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,520
But, uh, no, it turns out the professor had arranged for a shape-shifting mutant named Changeling to impersonate him.

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,640
So it was actually Changeling that died.

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,120
During House of M, the Scarlet Witch basically wishes him out of existence,

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,880
and obviously that didn't stick.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,440
And during the Avengers vs. X-Men storyline,

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,000
Xavier goes into battle with a V-Phoenix, Cyclops, and Emma Frost,

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,080
dying in the ensuing Phoenix Flames.

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,920
We even see him in the afterlife later when the X-Men go into it to rescue Nightcrawler.

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,840
So he's dead, but also part of his psyche is lodged into the Red Skull, so only sort of.

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,520
And then, of course, there is my bae, Nightcrawler.

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,320
Oh my god, I just said bae and I'm in my thirties.

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,680
Well, anyway, he only died once.

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,920
So there's this mutant named Hope, who may or may not be some kind of

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,880
Jean Grey Daughter clone, whatever.

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,440
Anyway, she's important, so during the Second Coming event, Nightcrawler dies to save her.

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,960
He's still helped out while dead because he is the best.

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,120
When Wolverine is possessed by a demon called the Hellverine...

26
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,120
Yeah.

27
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,120
Nightcrawler enters his friend's mind from beyond to help him drive out the invader.

28
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,680
But was it him or a figment of Wolverine's imagination?

29
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,760
We don't know, but probably it was him.

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,440
But when Azazel invades the afterlife, Nightcrawler gets bored of being dead,

31
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,760
picks up a pirate hat and sword, and takes control of a ghost pirate ship.

32
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,760
It's actually pretty awesome.

33
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:49,200
And comes back to life by creating a body out of smushed together demon parts,

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,960
who are also his minions now.

35
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,000
Unlike Nightcrawler, who only has one death and resurrection under his belt,

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,440
Psylocke has several.

37
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,920
Psylocke, who was born a British white lady,

38
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,200
had a body switch with a Japanese ninja named Kwannon,

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,320
and her original white lady body died of this legacy virus.

40
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,200
And that is why she is a Japanese body with a white lady's soul in it.

41
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,720
And also, she took the name Lady Mandarin, despite being Japanese.

42
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,760
There was also an incident where she very nearly died because of Sabretooth,

43
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,880
but we're not going to count that one because she didn't quite die.

44
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,000
She just almost died.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,160
She died yet again while protecting Rogue and Beast from a villain named Vargas,

46
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,280
only to be resurrected a year later by her brother Jamie,

47
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,040
who reached back in time and prevented her spirit from entering the afterlife.

48
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,200
So that's like a technical almost not-death anyway.

49
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,960
The legacy virus was Marvel's 90s HIV allegory, for better or worse.

50
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,520
Another casualty of the legacy virus was Colossus,

51
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,680
who sacrificed himself nobly to release the cure for the legacy virus into the air,

52
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,080
which could only be made airborne with the death of its first user into the world.

53
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,880
Such noble.

54
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,680
So that's that.

55
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,800
Actually, no!

56
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,000
Joss Whedon wanted Colossus back for his Astonishing X-Men series,

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,160
so it turns out that this evil alien named Ord had stolen Colossus's body

58
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,560
right after his death, replaced it with a duplicate body,

59
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,560
and that was cremated in his place.

60
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,320
And then he resurrected the real deal.

61
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,280
As for Magneto, we gotta go way back, all the way back to the Asteroid M incident.

62
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,320
He appears to be dead here, but nope, he survived that,

63
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,400
and he popped up months later, having been encased in a protective shell.

64
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,320
Years later, we see him die as the mutant nation of Genosha was laid to waste,

65
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,000
so then he's gone for a while.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,360
Turns out, nope, he used that as an opportunity to infiltrate the X-Men

67
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,920
by assuming the identity of a guy named Zorn,

68
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,320
and after revealing himself and killing Jean Grey,

69
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,480
he himself is killed again.

70
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,600
But no!

71
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,080
Marvel was not thrilled with the direction this book was taking

72
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,920
and reversed it basically immediately.

73
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,960
Turns out that wasn't Magneto, but actually a guy named Zorn

74
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,480
who thought he was Magneto,

75
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,800
except that there is also a real guy named Zorn,

76
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,200
who is this Zorn's brother,

77
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,360
and he was also being held captive somewhere to Zorns.

78
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,320
Which is two Zorns more than we need.

79
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,840
You know what? Forget it.

80
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,560
Magneto's fine.

81
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,200
He started a new mutant group back on the ruins of Genosha

82
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,640
with his old buddy Xavier.

83
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,120
Because the real Magneto would never genocide anyone.

84
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,840
Storm died in a plane crash,

85
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,160
only nope, her death was faked by villains named Nanny and Orphan Maker.

86
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,840
They happened to have on hand a high-tech android replica of Storm's corpse,

87
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,760
and it was also designed by Tony Stark?

88
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,360
Okay.

89
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,680
This was all done with the intention of regressing Storm to childhood, BT-dubs.

90
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,160
Anyway, the real deal pops up a couple issues later.

91
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,520
Now, plus amnesia!

92
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,800
Storm died again when they all died!

93
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,400
Dazzler, Longshot, Wolverine, Storm, Colossus, Psylocke, Rogue, Havoc,

94
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,680
and Madeline Pryor, who was originally her own person,

95
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,320
but then it turns out she was like a clone of Jean Grey-

96
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,520
You know what? We're just not gonna go there.

97
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,720
All died during the battle in Dallas versus the Adversary.

98
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,000
They had to sacrifice their souls to stop the thing.

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,600
But then an ally named Roma used magic and brought them back because she could.

100
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,520
But they all have to pretend to be dead for a while.

101
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,640
Hashtag reasons.

102
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,760
But everyone, namely Kitty Pryde and Nightcrawler, thought that they were dead,

103
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,680
and so those two went off and formed Excalibur, which was awesome.

104
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,760
That was one of the times that Wolverine died,

105
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,080
and if you've watched the Daredevil TV series,

106
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,840
you know that the hand is like a mysterious group of ninjas

107
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,440
that returns people from the dead, but evil.

108
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,680
That is a thing in the comics.

109
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,120
They did this to both Wolverine and Northstar, but they both got better.

110
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,000
And like Xavier, Wolverine is dead presently.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,320
His death even got its own miniseries.

112
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,480
Prior to death of Wolverine, a virus turned off Wolverine's healing factor.

113
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,520
So after having been healing factor-less for a while,

114
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,880
he self-sacrificially...

115
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,240
Are we sensing a theme here?

116
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,000
Dies from being covered in adamantium and then suffocating from it.

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,800
Self-sacrifice and a beautiful metaphor sunset.

118
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,080
I'm sure he won't be back.

119
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,360
And of course, cliche of cliches, Phoenix.

120
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,880
Jean Grey was originally Marvel Girl until the day she sacrifices herself

121
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,560
for the lives of the other X-Men,

122
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,680
ostensibly dying but then immediately returning as Phoenix

123
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,400
with a new sexy outfit and fabulous voluminous hair.

124
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,160
That was fun, but some of the Marvel heads felt she was too powerful.

125
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,880
So along comes the world-destroying Dark Phoenix,

126
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,480
who once again has to die,

127
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,760
so she sacrifices herself more for permanent this time.

128
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,800
So aside from some Jean-alikes, she's gone for more than a decade,

129
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,360
but it turns out that this wasn't Jean.

130
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,840
The Phoenix Force actually placed Jean in a protective cocoon

131
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,040
on the bottom of Jamaica Bay,

132
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,280
and that Phoenix was actually a Phoenix Force,

133
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,640
hearing Jean's cry and her feelings and her passion and love for her friends,

134
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,120
and it wanted to see what this whole being human thing was about,

135
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:36,160
so it put the original Jean into a pod at the bottom of Jamaica Bay,

136
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,440
so Dark Phoenix was a clone, duplicate.

137
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,280
Like, it was Jean, and it wasn't...

138
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,200
So it's more accurate to say that Jean didn't get resurrected so much

139
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,760
as there were two, and one died, and one didn't,

140
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,400
and also inherited Copy A's memories.

141
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,840
During Grant Morrison's new X-Men,

142
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
she assumes again the powers of the Phoenix Force,

143
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,520
now under her complete control,

144
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,280
only to be killed by Magneto,

145
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,520
who actually wasn't Magneto, as we discussed,

146
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,520
and who was then beheaded by Wolverine.

147
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,040
That wasn't quite the end of it.

148
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,480
In X-Men Phoenix End Song,

149
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,440
the Phoenix resurrects Jean for one hot second again,

150
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,640
but it doesn't quite stick,

151
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,560
and she moves on to a higher plane of existence

152
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,080
and is generally self-sacrificing some more.

153
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,600
And that is definitely our big theme

154
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,320
with the whole X-Men dying and then coming back to life thing.

155
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,000
Self-sacrifice means you're Jesus, so it's not permanent.

156
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,720
X-Men continuity is convoluted and hack and slash and bendy

157
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,280
and timey-wimey because there's so many characters

158
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,200
and so many creators butting heads

159
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,120
as to who should go in what direction.

160
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,560
Are there any X-Men characters

161
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,760
that I didn't mention in the episode?

162
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,360
Feel free to list them in the comments,

163
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,320
and we will see you next time with a full episode.

164
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,040
Be careful about your self-sacrifice.

165
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,240
Good night and good luck.
