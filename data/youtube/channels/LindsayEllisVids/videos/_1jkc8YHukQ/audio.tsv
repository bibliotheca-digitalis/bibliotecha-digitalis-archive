0	10040	So this week it's we begin to talk about plot and then we start tiptoeing into characters.
10040	13880	We have a lot of comments to go through and you guys gave us our homework.
13880	19520	To everyone who commented, thank you so much, you kept me sane while I was at work.
19520	24680	If we don't read your stuff on the air, we're sorry, we kind of have to go through a highlights
24680	25680	reel.
25680	30160	Before playing the home game, we might not really understand the Lovecraft environment
30160	32000	or universe.
32000	36240	Alan Smith gave a really good quick rundown of what the deal is, just in case you were
36240	38640	there wondering what the deuces was all about.
38640	44040	The short idea of the universe is that all our everyday stuff is a small lacuna of stability
44040	47600	in what is otherwise a really strange and malevolent universe.
47600	51600	The central conflict of most of the stories is some poor schmuck who breaks out of the
51600	56640	insulated world we all live in to discover the actual truth, trademarked, and what happens
56640	57640	to them.
57640	61520	So, I don't know about you, but that sounds like perfect romance paranormal material for
61520	62520	me.
62520	67000	There you go, only she can handle the absolute truth.
67000	71840	There was a little pushback on that though, Yvonne pointed out that we might want to consider
71840	81240	that having a Lovecraft theme would be an audience alienating premise.
82240	86920	That also does kind of lean into some copyright concerns that people have brought up.
86920	90760	And I just want to say, don't worry about it.
90760	95080	If there's one thing that Fifty Shades of Grey has taught us, it's that we can just
95080	98480	search replace the shit out of whatever we want.
98480	100080	Search replaces your friend.
100080	106040	It's odd to me because this was kind of the original crowdsourced universe that Lovecraft
106040	111960	started it and then his colleagues and all these people kind of built on this universe
111960	115800	that he created and it just kind of built and built and built so it is odd that people
115800	116800	have that on lockdown.
116800	117800	But don't worry about it.
117800	121120	Worst case scenario, it's Lovecraft inspired.
121120	126640	Joshua Pelfrey points out that Lovecraft stuff was really racist so we probably want to include
126640	128680	smoke or racism.
128680	130680	Can do.
130680	137560	So as you remember, our question last week was what is the driving force behind our romantic
137560	139880	couple getting together?
139880	144720	And of the comments we received, I have to say I like that we kept running with the dream
144720	145720	thing.
145720	146720	Yeah.
146720	150120	Like love dreams enter a huge part of the Lovecraft mythos.
150120	152120	Narla Hottup Bonaparte.
152120	157600	Guys, I'm going to be butchering a lot of names.
157600	158600	You've been warned.
158920	165360	But Bonaparte and Bonaparte pointed out that in Call of Cthulhu, when Cthulhu is about
165360	169600	to wake up, a lot of artistic minded people start to feel the presence of the old one.
169600	172480	So they kind of felt moved to make drawings and sculptures of the creature.
172480	173480	We got to start with a dream.
173480	174480	Yeah.
174480	175760	Definitely got to start with a dream.
175760	178040	But that's how she starts imagining him.
178040	181840	One person, and this is kind of troubling to me because I can't find the comment, it's
181840	183640	a person, whoever you are, sorry.
183640	187360	Yeah, your comment was great and that's why we're saying it now.
187360	191920	Someone suggested that the basic overarching plot is what is the contrived nonsense that
191920	195280	drives Cthulhu to take a human form and go to high school?
195280	204880	It's that there's some prophecy that this girl is going to stop him ending the world.
204880	211880	And it turns out that prophecy is totally true, but she stops him ending the world because
211880	214120	he falls in love with her.
214120	215120	That's right.
215280	218400	Fulfilling prophecy, motherfuckers.
218400	222280	And then he doesn't want to destroy humanity because he's learned about our love.
222280	226160	It's like in the Day of the Earth, still the remake, not the original.
226160	229280	I support going ahead with this 100%.
229280	231000	I think that's a good starting point.
231000	232000	I didn't know you had love.
232000	233000	Oh god, I have no idea you had love.
233000	234000	I have no idea about love.
234000	235000	Love is awesome.
235000	238920	V. Voltaire strikes again.
238920	242200	They touch each other and then bam, soul bonding.
242240	245160	Bitches love soul bonding.
245160	248320	They share dreams and this is kind of how they get to know each other.
248320	253200	He's like hunting her in her dreams, but he's really falling in love with her as he does.
253200	256160	She's really threatened by this and also really turned on.
256160	261680	Jacob Littleton Post mentioned that what we could do was while the old ones were sleeping,
261680	264960	they were tapping into the unconscious minds of humanity near them.
264960	271000	So when Cthulhu is finally brought back through a botch summoning, or in our case, to stop
271040	275520	the person who would stop the end of the world, he's stuck with the most compelling image
275520	280360	crafted by the strongest desires of these minds, aka the young female desires for the
280360	281360	perfect boy.
281360	283520	So hence why he's a hottie.
283520	290280	There are quite a few where she writes poetry to her elder abomination, which I enjoyed
290280	291280	a lot.
291280	296760	I won't read them here, but there were quite a few poems which were very enjoyable to read.
296760	302360	Here's one scene by Michael Witry that I think captured what we're going for very well.
302360	306880	Do you, will you always believe me, even when every one of your senses, every one of your
306880	309480	memories is telling you that I'm lying?
309480	313040	What could I say, she thought, always.
313040	314040	That's actually kind of perfect.
314040	315040	Yeah, that's great.
315040	316440	I might have to copy that one word for word.
316440	321600	That makes me feel like this one line that Carlos Ernesto McReynolds offered where he
321600	327760	feels that the phrase, the most merciful thing in protagonist's world is the inability
327760	335640	of her mind to correlate all its contents.
335640	338760	Let's look at our friend Bella here.
338760	343840	What I find most remarkable about Bella, and this by Stephanie Meyer's own admission, is
343840	350680	that she is so blank slate that like literally any woman, white woman, white woman.
350680	351880	And you, white woman.
351880	357000	Can slip into her shoes and be her.
357000	360800	Her only thing that she does is read.
360800	362280	And cook for her father.
362280	364800	Yeah, but mostly it's reading.
364800	369520	And I think reading is interesting because it's a very passive activity.
369520	370520	Oh yeah.
370520	377240	The thing about the reading aspect, which I find the most interesting about the character
377240	383000	Bella is when she says she's reading, it's all class reading.
383000	386520	But it's also some stuff she's read before for class.
386520	390720	Yes, she's a reader and she can reference all these things, but it's not from her own
390720	391800	pleasure of it.
391800	396080	It's because I've done it before for something else that I had to do.
396080	401480	So I, you know, reading it, I never even really got the sense that she actually enjoys reading.
401480	404920	It's just something she's actually able to do without hurting herself.
404920	411960	So I would say the major difference between Bella and her copy, Anastasia, down the road
411960	418040	is that Anastasia is a distillation of everything that's really obnoxious about Bella.
418040	424800	She's not as socially awkward as Anastasia, but Anastasia has more hatred of other people.
424800	425800	See Bella just sort of-
425800	427200	She's a lot more threatened by other women.
427200	428200	Exactly.
428200	430400	Like Bella is just kind of dismissive of everybody.
430400	435000	Bella is never active in friendships.
435000	437520	People come to her to be friends with her.
437520	439000	People are obsessed with Bella.
439000	442000	Like they're trying to crack her, like she's this big project.
442000	443000	Yeah.
443000	444560	And it's like, no.
444560	447640	So we have our Bella.
447640	451800	She goes from point A to point B, and we'll discuss location later.
451800	455920	She has to be, I think it's most important that she is leaving her mother to live with
455920	456920	her father.
456920	457920	A lot of the Twilights.
457920	458920	Yeah.
458920	459920	Like a lot of the knockoffs do.
460920	465640	The thing I have found is that the mother is a child.
465640	470680	And there's this implication that the Bella character has always taken care of her child
470680	471680	mother.
471680	476320	Well this is something, this is a recurring thing I see pop up in Stephanie Meyer's writing
476320	478640	is that her teenagers are not teenagers, they're mothers.
478640	483440	They're 36 year old mothers that are taking care of everyone and they have like this giant
483440	489280	martyr complex and they just cannot wait until they can sacrifice themselves for someone
489280	490280	else.
490280	494280	Like that's one of the very, like hell this is the first Twilight, that's how it begins.
494280	497520	Like oh man, I'm so glad I'm dying for someone that I love.
497520	498520	Right?
498520	499520	Yeah.
499520	500520	They're so okay.
500520	501920	Women love martyrs when they are martyrs.
501920	502920	Yes.
502920	503920	They love men that are martyrs.
503920	509480	It was like my theory that I just developed yesterday that Edward is basically the Phantom,
509480	510480	but hot.
510480	511480	Oh.
511480	512480	Yeah.
512520	513520	Because he's obsessive.
513520	514520	Yeah.
514520	515520	And possessive.
515520	516520	Mm-hmm.
516520	522480	And Bella is the honest with herself fangirl who loves this shit.
522480	526160	You know, whereas in reality you'd probably be a little freaked out unless there's something
526160	529720	wrong with you, which is the real problem with their relationship.
529720	532440	He just does them and she just happens to like them.
532440	535560	And I feel like there's that weird honesty with Fifty Shades of Grey where she's kind
535560	541760	of aware that this is like incredibly messed up, whereas in Twilight it's just like, nope.
542040	543040	No.
543040	544040	In one way.
544040	545040	Whee!
545040	551880	And also, I really hate these books and their fetishization of the one.
551880	553840	You're my first boyfriend.
553840	556200	You're my very first one.
556200	559560	No, I have never even looked at another man.
559560	565880	I have never even felt the kindling of the slightest bit of want in my heart.
565880	571600	Like Anna who's 22 and has never had an orgasm, never been attracted to another man.
572440	573440	Never touched herself.
573440	574440	Yeah.
574440	576440	That I really don't buy.
576440	577440	Yeah.
577440	578440	Nothing.
578440	579440	She has had...
579440	580440	It's the ultimate like purity.
580440	581440	It's just like, it's supposed to prove something.
581440	582440	And it makes me feel so good.
582440	588720	And I don't understand why people relate to that, because it's like, that's no one.
588720	593960	I think people identify with it, not because they have lived it, but because they do, deep
593960	596760	down inside, believe that it's the ideal.
596760	597760	Yeah.
597760	598760	That's how it should be.
598760	599760	Yeah.
599920	600920	Yeah.
600920	601920	She'll feel nothing until the one comes along.
601920	602920	Yeah.
602920	603920	Because you're only given one.
603920	604920	Yeah.
604920	605920	You're only given one.
605920	606920	So we're going to do that.
606920	607920	Yeah.
607920	608920	Yeah.
608920	609920	She feels nothing until the one comes along.
609920	610920	Yeah.
610920	611920	So we need a father.
611920	612920	We need a mother.
612920	613920	We need...
613920	614920	Yeah.
614920	615920	Maybe a bitchy best friend.
615920	616920	We need, you know, Cthulhu.
616920	617920	Who's his family?
617920	618920	Yeah.
618920	619920	And we also need some like really interesting backstories for all of them, so we can just
619920	620920	kind of allude to them and they completely ignore them.
620920	621920	Yeah.
621920	622920	Because...
622920	623920	They don't play into the plot at all.
623920	628120	Because remember, we're not here to write a great book.
628120	633600	We're here to write a romance paranormal novel, which means we can have all manner and allude
633600	638440	to all manner of interesting things in the background and then we'll just breeze right
638440	639440	by them.
639440	640440	Yeah.
640440	641440	Wee!
641440	642440	Nyarlathotep.
642440	643440	Nyarlathotep.
643440	645360	I really want him to be like the Carlisle.
645360	646920	I'm just throwing it out here.
646920	650640	I want him to be the Carlisle who like understands humans the most because he's the one that's
650640	652600	traveled the longest among us.
652600	653600	Yeah.
653600	654600	He's like dad Weasley.
654600	655600	He's not the one that's been like sleeping.
655600	656600	Yeah.
656600	657600	Yeah.
658080	659080	Weasley.
659080	660080	Little Carlisle.
660080	661080	Tell us.
661080	662800	Who are our fellow characters going to be?
662800	666840	Remember, we have female characters with a blank slate, we have a flighty mother, the
666840	670320	absent emotionally father.
670320	673080	Since we're a little bit more sophisticated than Stephanie Meyer, we can also start thinking
673080	674080	about our antagonist.
674080	675080	Mm.
675080	676080	Because why not?
676080	679440	I mean, I feel like he's going to choose not to end the world, so he's going to piss
679440	680440	somebody off.
680440	683000	So the someone who gets pissed off is the one we have to save the day from.
683000	684000	Yeah.
684000	686560	So who does he piss off by not following his orders?
686560	696120	How can we make him as shh, or her, as thin, as little motivation, as boring?
696120	699120	What's his or her vested interest in seeing the world end?
699120	703120	Hey Vishnu, we can start over again, right?
703120	704120	Yeah, Vishnu.
704120	705120	Oh, that's where Vishnu comes in.
705120	706120	Oh yeah.
706120	707120	We're going to start over.
707120	708120	Don't worry.
708120	709120	We're going to start over.
709120	710120	Don't worry about it.
710120	711120	We're going to start over again.
711120	712120	It turns out the new world is just like the old one.
712120	713120	Bullet, dodge.
