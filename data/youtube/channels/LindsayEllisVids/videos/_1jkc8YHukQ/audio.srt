1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040
So this week it's we begin to talk about plot and then we start tiptoeing into characters.

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,880
We have a lot of comments to go through and you guys gave us our homework.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,520
To everyone who commented, thank you so much, you kept me sane while I was at work.

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,680
If we don't read your stuff on the air, we're sorry, we kind of have to go through a highlights

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,680
reel.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,160
Before playing the home game, we might not really understand the Lovecraft environment

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,000
or universe.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,240
Alan Smith gave a really good quick rundown of what the deal is, just in case you were

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,640
there wondering what the deuces was all about.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,040
The short idea of the universe is that all our everyday stuff is a small lacuna of stability

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,600
in what is otherwise a really strange and malevolent universe.

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,600
The central conflict of most of the stories is some poor schmuck who breaks out of the

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,640
insulated world we all live in to discover the actual truth, trademarked, and what happens

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,640
to them.

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,520
So, I don't know about you, but that sounds like perfect romance paranormal material for

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520
me.

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,000
There you go, only she can handle the absolute truth.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,840
There was a little pushback on that though, Yvonne pointed out that we might want to consider

19
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:21,240
that having a Lovecraft theme would be an audience alienating premise.

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,920
That also does kind of lean into some copyright concerns that people have brought up.

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,760
And I just want to say, don't worry about it.

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,080
If there's one thing that Fifty Shades of Grey has taught us, it's that we can just

23
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,480
search replace the shit out of whatever we want.

24
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,080
Search replaces your friend.

25
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:46,040
It's odd to me because this was kind of the original crowdsourced universe that Lovecraft

26
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,960
started it and then his colleagues and all these people kind of built on this universe

27
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,800
that he created and it just kind of built and built and built so it is odd that people

28
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,800
have that on lockdown.

29
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,800
But don't worry about it.

30
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,120
Worst case scenario, it's Lovecraft inspired.

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,640
Joshua Pelfrey points out that Lovecraft stuff was really racist so we probably want to include

32
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,680
smoke or racism.

33
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,680
Can do.

34
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:17,560
So as you remember, our question last week was what is the driving force behind our romantic

35
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,880
couple getting together?

36
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,720
And of the comments we received, I have to say I like that we kept running with the dream

37
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,720
thing.

38
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Yeah.

39
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,120
Like love dreams enter a huge part of the Lovecraft mythos.

40
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,120
Narla Hottup Bonaparte.

41
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,600
Guys, I'm going to be butchering a lot of names.

42
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
You've been warned.

43
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,360
But Bonaparte and Bonaparte pointed out that in Call of Cthulhu, when Cthulhu is about

44
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,600
to wake up, a lot of artistic minded people start to feel the presence of the old one.

45
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,480
So they kind of felt moved to make drawings and sculptures of the creature.

46
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,480
We got to start with a dream.

47
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,480
Yeah.

48
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,760
Definitely got to start with a dream.

49
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,040
But that's how she starts imagining him.

50
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,840
One person, and this is kind of troubling to me because I can't find the comment, it's

51
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,640
a person, whoever you are, sorry.

52
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,360
Yeah, your comment was great and that's why we're saying it now.

53
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,920
Someone suggested that the basic overarching plot is what is the contrived nonsense that

54
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,280
drives Cthulhu to take a human form and go to high school?

55
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:24,880
It's that there's some prophecy that this girl is going to stop him ending the world.

56
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:31,880
And it turns out that prophecy is totally true, but she stops him ending the world because

57
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,120
he falls in love with her.

58
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,120
That's right.

59
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,400
Fulfilling prophecy, motherfuckers.

60
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,280
And then he doesn't want to destroy humanity because he's learned about our love.

61
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,160
It's like in the Day of the Earth, still the remake, not the original.

62
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,280
I support going ahead with this 100%.

63
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,000
I think that's a good starting point.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I didn't know you had love.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh god, I have no idea you had love.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I have no idea about love.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Love is awesome.

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,920
V. Voltaire strikes again.

69
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,200
They touch each other and then bam, soul bonding.

70
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,160
Bitches love soul bonding.

71
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,320
They share dreams and this is kind of how they get to know each other.

72
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,200
He's like hunting her in her dreams, but he's really falling in love with her as he does.

73
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,160
She's really threatened by this and also really turned on.

74
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,680
Jacob Littleton Post mentioned that what we could do was while the old ones were sleeping,

75
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,960
they were tapping into the unconscious minds of humanity near them.

76
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,000
So when Cthulhu is finally brought back through a botch summoning, or in our case, to stop

77
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,520
the person who would stop the end of the world, he's stuck with the most compelling image

78
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,360
crafted by the strongest desires of these minds, aka the young female desires for the

79
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,360
perfect boy.

80
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,520
So hence why he's a hottie.

81
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,280
There are quite a few where she writes poetry to her elder abomination, which I enjoyed

82
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
a lot.

83
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,760
I won't read them here, but there were quite a few poems which were very enjoyable to read.

84
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:02,360
Here's one scene by Michael Witry that I think captured what we're going for very well.

85
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,880
Do you, will you always believe me, even when every one of your senses, every one of your

86
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,480
memories is telling you that I'm lying?

87
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,040
What could I say, she thought, always.

88
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
That's actually kind of perfect.

89
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Yeah, that's great.

90
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,440
I might have to copy that one word for word.

91
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,600
That makes me feel like this one line that Carlos Ernesto McReynolds offered where he

92
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,760
feels that the phrase, the most merciful thing in protagonist's world is the inability

93
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:35,640
of her mind to correlate all its contents.

94
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,760
Let's look at our friend Bella here.

95
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,840
What I find most remarkable about Bella, and this by Stephanie Meyer's own admission, is

96
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,680
that she is so blank slate that like literally any woman, white woman, white woman.

97
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,880
And you, white woman.

98
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,000
Can slip into her shoes and be her.

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,800
Her only thing that she does is read.

100
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,280
And cook for her father.

101
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,800
Yeah, but mostly it's reading.

102
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,520
And I think reading is interesting because it's a very passive activity.

103
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,520
Oh yeah.

104
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:17,240
The thing about the reading aspect, which I find the most interesting about the character

105
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:23,000
Bella is when she says she's reading, it's all class reading.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,520
But it's also some stuff she's read before for class.

107
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,720
Yes, she's a reader and she can reference all these things, but it's not from her own

108
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,800
pleasure of it.

109
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,080
It's because I've done it before for something else that I had to do.

110
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,480
So I, you know, reading it, I never even really got the sense that she actually enjoys reading.

111
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,920
It's just something she's actually able to do without hurting herself.

112
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:51,960
So I would say the major difference between Bella and her copy, Anastasia, down the road

113
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:58,040
is that Anastasia is a distillation of everything that's really obnoxious about Bella.

114
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:04,800
She's not as socially awkward as Anastasia, but Anastasia has more hatred of other people.

115
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
See Bella just sort of-

116
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,200
She's a lot more threatened by other women.

117
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
Exactly.

118
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,400
Like Bella is just kind of dismissive of everybody.

119
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,000
Bella is never active in friendships.

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,520
People come to her to be friends with her.

121
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,000
People are obsessed with Bella.

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Like they're trying to crack her, like she's this big project.

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yeah.

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,560
And it's like, no.

125
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,640
So we have our Bella.

126
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,800
She goes from point A to point B, and we'll discuss location later.

127
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,920
She has to be, I think it's most important that she is leaving her mother to live with

128
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,920
her father.

129
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
A lot of the Twilights.

130
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
Yeah.

131
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
Like a lot of the knockoffs do.

132
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,640
The thing I have found is that the mother is a child.

133
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,680
And there's this implication that the Bella character has always taken care of her child

134
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,680
mother.

135
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,320
Well this is something, this is a recurring thing I see pop up in Stephanie Meyer's writing

136
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,640
is that her teenagers are not teenagers, they're mothers.

137
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,440
They're 36 year old mothers that are taking care of everyone and they have like this giant

138
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,280
martyr complex and they just cannot wait until they can sacrifice themselves for someone

139
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,280
else.

140
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,280
Like that's one of the very, like hell this is the first Twilight, that's how it begins.

141
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,520
Like oh man, I'm so glad I'm dying for someone that I love.

142
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,520
Right?

143
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,520
Yeah.

144
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
They're so okay.

145
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,920
Women love martyrs when they are martyrs.

146
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
Yes.

147
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
They love men that are martyrs.

148
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,480
It was like my theory that I just developed yesterday that Edward is basically the Phantom,

149
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
but hot.

150
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
Oh.

151
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
Yeah.

152
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
Because he's obsessive.

153
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Yeah.

154
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,520
And possessive.

155
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Mm-hmm.

156
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:42,480
And Bella is the honest with herself fangirl who loves this shit.

157
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,160
You know, whereas in reality you'd probably be a little freaked out unless there's something

158
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,720
wrong with you, which is the real problem with their relationship.

159
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,440
He just does them and she just happens to like them.

160
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,560
And I feel like there's that weird honesty with Fifty Shades of Grey where she's kind

161
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:01,760
of aware that this is like incredibly messed up, whereas in Twilight it's just like, nope.

162
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
No.

163
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,040
In one way.

164
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,040
Whee!

165
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,880
And also, I really hate these books and their fetishization of the one.

166
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,840
You're my first boyfriend.

167
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,200
You're my very first one.

168
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,560
No, I have never even looked at another man.

169
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,880
I have never even felt the kindling of the slightest bit of want in my heart.

170
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:31,600
Like Anna who's 22 and has never had an orgasm, never been attracted to another man.

171
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
Never touched herself.

172
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,440
Yeah.

173
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,440
That I really don't buy.

174
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
Yeah.

175
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
Nothing.

176
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
She has had...

177
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
It's the ultimate like purity.

178
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
It's just like, it's supposed to prove something.

179
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
And it makes me feel so good.

180
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,720
And I don't understand why people relate to that, because it's like, that's no one.

181
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,960
I think people identify with it, not because they have lived it, but because they do, deep

182
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,760
down inside, believe that it's the ideal.

183
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
Yeah.

184
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,760
That's how it should be.

185
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
Yeah.

186
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
Yeah.

187
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
She'll feel nothing until the one comes along.

188
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,920
Yeah.

189
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
Because you're only given one.

190
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,920
Yeah.

191
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
You're only given one.

192
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
So we're going to do that.

193
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,920
Yeah.

194
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,920
Yeah.

195
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
She feels nothing until the one comes along.

196
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
Yeah.

197
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,920
So we need a father.

198
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
We need a mother.

199
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
We need...

200
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,920
Yeah.

201
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,920
Maybe a bitchy best friend.

202
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
We need, you know, Cthulhu.

203
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,920
Who's his family?

204
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
Yeah.

205
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
And we also need some like really interesting backstories for all of them, so we can just

206
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,920
kind of allude to them and they completely ignore them.

207
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,920
Yeah.

208
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Because...

209
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
They don't play into the plot at all.

210
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,120
Because remember, we're not here to write a great book.

211
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,600
We're here to write a romance paranormal novel, which means we can have all manner and allude

212
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,440
to all manner of interesting things in the background and then we'll just breeze right

213
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
by them.

214
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
Yeah.

215
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,440
Wee!

216
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
Nyarlathotep.

217
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
Nyarlathotep.

218
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,360
I really want him to be like the Carlisle.

219
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,920
I'm just throwing it out here.

220
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,640
I want him to be the Carlisle who like understands humans the most because he's the one that's

221
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,600
traveled the longest among us.

222
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Yeah.

223
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
He's like dad Weasley.

224
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
He's not the one that's been like sleeping.

225
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
Yeah.

226
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Yeah.

227
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,080
Weasley.

228
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,080
Little Carlisle.

229
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,080
Tell us.

230
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,800
Who are our fellow characters going to be?

231
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,840
Remember, we have female characters with a blank slate, we have a flighty mother, the

232
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,320
absent emotionally father.

233
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,080
Since we're a little bit more sophisticated than Stephanie Meyer, we can also start thinking

234
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
about our antagonist.

235
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,080
Mm.

236
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
Because why not?

237
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,440
I mean, I feel like he's going to choose not to end the world, so he's going to piss

238
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
somebody off.

239
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,000
So the someone who gets pissed off is the one we have to save the day from.

240
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah.

241
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,560
So who does he piss off by not following his orders?

242
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:36,120
How can we make him as shh, or her, as thin, as little motivation, as boring?

243
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,120
What's his or her vested interest in seeing the world end?

244
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,120
Hey Vishnu, we can start over again, right?

245
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
Yeah, Vishnu.

246
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
Oh, that's where Vishnu comes in.

247
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,120
Oh yeah.

248
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
We're going to start over.

249
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,120
Don't worry.

250
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
We're going to start over.

251
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
Don't worry about it.

252
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,120
We're going to start over again.

253
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,120
It turns out the new world is just like the old one.

254
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
Bullet, dodge.
