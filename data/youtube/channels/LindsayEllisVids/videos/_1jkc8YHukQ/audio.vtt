WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.040
So this week it's we begin to talk about plot and then we start tiptoeing into characters.

00:10.040 --> 00:13.880
We have a lot of comments to go through and you guys gave us our homework.

00:13.880 --> 00:19.520
To everyone who commented, thank you so much, you kept me sane while I was at work.

00:19.520 --> 00:24.680
If we don't read your stuff on the air, we're sorry, we kind of have to go through a highlights

00:24.680 --> 00:25.680
reel.

00:25.680 --> 00:30.160
Before playing the home game, we might not really understand the Lovecraft environment

00:30.160 --> 00:32.000
or universe.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.240
Alan Smith gave a really good quick rundown of what the deal is, just in case you were

00:36.240 --> 00:38.640
there wondering what the deuces was all about.

00:38.640 --> 00:44.040
The short idea of the universe is that all our everyday stuff is a small lacuna of stability

00:44.040 --> 00:47.600
in what is otherwise a really strange and malevolent universe.

00:47.600 --> 00:51.600
The central conflict of most of the stories is some poor schmuck who breaks out of the

00:51.600 --> 00:56.640
insulated world we all live in to discover the actual truth, trademarked, and what happens

00:56.640 --> 00:57.640
to them.

00:57.640 --> 01:01.520
So, I don't know about you, but that sounds like perfect romance paranormal material for

01:01.520 --> 01:02.520
me.

01:02.520 --> 01:07.000
There you go, only she can handle the absolute truth.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.840
There was a little pushback on that though, Yvonne pointed out that we might want to consider

01:11.840 --> 01:21.240
that having a Lovecraft theme would be an audience alienating premise.

01:22.240 --> 01:26.920
That also does kind of lean into some copyright concerns that people have brought up.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.760
And I just want to say, don't worry about it.

01:30.760 --> 01:35.080
If there's one thing that Fifty Shades of Grey has taught us, it's that we can just

01:35.080 --> 01:38.480
search replace the shit out of whatever we want.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.080
Search replaces your friend.

01:40.080 --> 01:46.040
It's odd to me because this was kind of the original crowdsourced universe that Lovecraft

01:46.040 --> 01:51.960
started it and then his colleagues and all these people kind of built on this universe

01:51.960 --> 01:55.800
that he created and it just kind of built and built and built so it is odd that people

01:55.800 --> 01:56.800
have that on lockdown.

01:56.800 --> 01:57.800
But don't worry about it.

01:57.800 --> 02:01.120
Worst case scenario, it's Lovecraft inspired.

02:01.120 --> 02:06.640
Joshua Pelfrey points out that Lovecraft stuff was really racist so we probably want to include

02:06.640 --> 02:08.680
smoke or racism.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.680
Can do.

02:10.680 --> 02:17.560
So as you remember, our question last week was what is the driving force behind our romantic

02:17.560 --> 02:19.880
couple getting together?

02:19.880 --> 02:24.720
And of the comments we received, I have to say I like that we kept running with the dream

02:24.720 --> 02:25.720
thing.

02:25.720 --> 02:26.720
Yeah.

02:26.720 --> 02:30.120
Like love dreams enter a huge part of the Lovecraft mythos.

02:30.120 --> 02:32.120
Narla Hottup Bonaparte.

02:32.120 --> 02:37.600
Guys, I'm going to be butchering a lot of names.

02:37.600 --> 02:38.600
You've been warned.

02:38.920 --> 02:45.360
But Bonaparte and Bonaparte pointed out that in Call of Cthulhu, when Cthulhu is about

02:45.360 --> 02:49.600
to wake up, a lot of artistic minded people start to feel the presence of the old one.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.480
So they kind of felt moved to make drawings and sculptures of the creature.

02:52.480 --> 02:53.480
We got to start with a dream.

02:53.480 --> 02:54.480
Yeah.

02:54.480 --> 02:55.760
Definitely got to start with a dream.

02:55.760 --> 02:58.040
But that's how she starts imagining him.

02:58.040 --> 03:01.840
One person, and this is kind of troubling to me because I can't find the comment, it's

03:01.840 --> 03:03.640
a person, whoever you are, sorry.

03:03.640 --> 03:07.360
Yeah, your comment was great and that's why we're saying it now.

03:07.360 --> 03:11.920
Someone suggested that the basic overarching plot is what is the contrived nonsense that

03:11.920 --> 03:15.280
drives Cthulhu to take a human form and go to high school?

03:15.280 --> 03:24.880
It's that there's some prophecy that this girl is going to stop him ending the world.

03:24.880 --> 03:31.880
And it turns out that prophecy is totally true, but she stops him ending the world because

03:31.880 --> 03:34.120
he falls in love with her.

03:34.120 --> 03:35.120
That's right.

03:35.280 --> 03:38.400
Fulfilling prophecy, motherfuckers.

03:38.400 --> 03:42.280
And then he doesn't want to destroy humanity because he's learned about our love.

03:42.280 --> 03:46.160
It's like in the Day of the Earth, still the remake, not the original.

03:46.160 --> 03:49.280
I support going ahead with this 100%.

03:49.280 --> 03:51.000
I think that's a good starting point.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
I didn't know you had love.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Oh god, I have no idea you had love.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
I have no idea about love.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Love is awesome.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.920
V. Voltaire strikes again.

03:58.920 --> 04:02.200
They touch each other and then bam, soul bonding.

04:02.240 --> 04:05.160
Bitches love soul bonding.

04:05.160 --> 04:08.320
They share dreams and this is kind of how they get to know each other.

04:08.320 --> 04:13.200
He's like hunting her in her dreams, but he's really falling in love with her as he does.

04:13.200 --> 04:16.160
She's really threatened by this and also really turned on.

04:16.160 --> 04:21.680
Jacob Littleton Post mentioned that what we could do was while the old ones were sleeping,

04:21.680 --> 04:24.960
they were tapping into the unconscious minds of humanity near them.

04:24.960 --> 04:31.000
So when Cthulhu is finally brought back through a botch summoning, or in our case, to stop

04:31.040 --> 04:35.520
the person who would stop the end of the world, he's stuck with the most compelling image

04:35.520 --> 04:40.360
crafted by the strongest desires of these minds, aka the young female desires for the

04:40.360 --> 04:41.360
perfect boy.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.520
So hence why he's a hottie.

04:43.520 --> 04:50.280
There are quite a few where she writes poetry to her elder abomination, which I enjoyed

04:50.280 --> 04:51.280
a lot.

04:51.280 --> 04:56.760
I won't read them here, but there were quite a few poems which were very enjoyable to read.

04:56.760 --> 05:02.360
Here's one scene by Michael Witry that I think captured what we're going for very well.

05:02.360 --> 05:06.880
Do you, will you always believe me, even when every one of your senses, every one of your

05:06.880 --> 05:09.480
memories is telling you that I'm lying?

05:09.480 --> 05:13.040
What could I say, she thought, always.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.040
That's actually kind of perfect.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.040
Yeah, that's great.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.440
I might have to copy that one word for word.

05:16.440 --> 05:21.600
That makes me feel like this one line that Carlos Ernesto McReynolds offered where he

05:21.600 --> 05:27.760
feels that the phrase, the most merciful thing in protagonist's world is the inability

05:27.760 --> 05:35.640
of her mind to correlate all its contents.

05:35.640 --> 05:38.760
Let's look at our friend Bella here.

05:38.760 --> 05:43.840
What I find most remarkable about Bella, and this by Stephanie Meyer's own admission, is

05:43.840 --> 05:50.680
that she is so blank slate that like literally any woman, white woman, white woman.

05:50.680 --> 05:51.880
And you, white woman.

05:51.880 --> 05:57.000
Can slip into her shoes and be her.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.800
Her only thing that she does is read.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.280
And cook for her father.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.800
Yeah, but mostly it's reading.

06:04.800 --> 06:09.520
And I think reading is interesting because it's a very passive activity.

06:09.520 --> 06:10.520
Oh yeah.

06:10.520 --> 06:17.240
The thing about the reading aspect, which I find the most interesting about the character

06:17.240 --> 06:23.000
Bella is when she says she's reading, it's all class reading.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.520
But it's also some stuff she's read before for class.

06:26.520 --> 06:30.720
Yes, she's a reader and she can reference all these things, but it's not from her own

06:30.720 --> 06:31.800
pleasure of it.

06:31.800 --> 06:36.080
It's because I've done it before for something else that I had to do.

06:36.080 --> 06:41.480
So I, you know, reading it, I never even really got the sense that she actually enjoys reading.

06:41.480 --> 06:44.920
It's just something she's actually able to do without hurting herself.

06:44.920 --> 06:51.960
So I would say the major difference between Bella and her copy, Anastasia, down the road

06:51.960 --> 06:58.040
is that Anastasia is a distillation of everything that's really obnoxious about Bella.

06:58.040 --> 07:04.800
She's not as socially awkward as Anastasia, but Anastasia has more hatred of other people.

07:04.800 --> 07:05.800
See Bella just sort of-

07:05.800 --> 07:07.200
She's a lot more threatened by other women.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.200
Exactly.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.400
Like Bella is just kind of dismissive of everybody.

07:10.400 --> 07:15.000
Bella is never active in friendships.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.520
People come to her to be friends with her.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.000
People are obsessed with Bella.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
Like they're trying to crack her, like she's this big project.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Yeah.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.560
And it's like, no.

07:24.560 --> 07:27.640
So we have our Bella.

07:27.640 --> 07:31.800
She goes from point A to point B, and we'll discuss location later.

07:31.800 --> 07:35.920
She has to be, I think it's most important that she is leaving her mother to live with

07:35.920 --> 07:36.920
her father.

07:36.920 --> 07:37.920
A lot of the Twilights.

07:37.920 --> 07:38.920
Yeah.

07:38.920 --> 07:39.920
Like a lot of the knockoffs do.

07:40.920 --> 07:45.640
The thing I have found is that the mother is a child.

07:45.640 --> 07:50.680
And there's this implication that the Bella character has always taken care of her child

07:50.680 --> 07:51.680
mother.

07:51.680 --> 07:56.320
Well this is something, this is a recurring thing I see pop up in Stephanie Meyer's writing

07:56.320 --> 07:58.640
is that her teenagers are not teenagers, they're mothers.

07:58.640 --> 08:03.440
They're 36 year old mothers that are taking care of everyone and they have like this giant

08:03.440 --> 08:09.280
martyr complex and they just cannot wait until they can sacrifice themselves for someone

08:09.280 --> 08:10.280
else.

08:10.280 --> 08:14.280
Like that's one of the very, like hell this is the first Twilight, that's how it begins.

08:14.280 --> 08:17.520
Like oh man, I'm so glad I'm dying for someone that I love.

08:17.520 --> 08:18.520
Right?

08:18.520 --> 08:19.520
Yeah.

08:19.520 --> 08:20.520
They're so okay.

08:20.520 --> 08:21.920
Women love martyrs when they are martyrs.

08:21.920 --> 08:22.920
Yes.

08:22.920 --> 08:23.920
They love men that are martyrs.

08:23.920 --> 08:29.480
It was like my theory that I just developed yesterday that Edward is basically the Phantom,

08:29.480 --> 08:30.480
but hot.

08:30.480 --> 08:31.480
Oh.

08:31.480 --> 08:32.480
Yeah.

08:32.520 --> 08:33.520
Because he's obsessive.

08:33.520 --> 08:34.520
Yeah.

08:34.520 --> 08:35.520
And possessive.

08:35.520 --> 08:36.520
Mm-hmm.

08:36.520 --> 08:42.480
And Bella is the honest with herself fangirl who loves this shit.

08:42.480 --> 08:46.160
You know, whereas in reality you'd probably be a little freaked out unless there's something

08:46.160 --> 08:49.720
wrong with you, which is the real problem with their relationship.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.440
He just does them and she just happens to like them.

08:52.440 --> 08:55.560
And I feel like there's that weird honesty with Fifty Shades of Grey where she's kind

08:55.560 --> 09:01.760
of aware that this is like incredibly messed up, whereas in Twilight it's just like, nope.

09:02.040 --> 09:03.040
No.

09:03.040 --> 09:04.040
In one way.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.040
Whee!

09:05.040 --> 09:11.880
And also, I really hate these books and their fetishization of the one.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.840
You're my first boyfriend.

09:13.840 --> 09:16.200
You're my very first one.

09:16.200 --> 09:19.560
No, I have never even looked at another man.

09:19.560 --> 09:25.880
I have never even felt the kindling of the slightest bit of want in my heart.

09:25.880 --> 09:31.600
Like Anna who's 22 and has never had an orgasm, never been attracted to another man.

09:32.440 --> 09:33.440
Never touched herself.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.440
Yeah.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.440
That I really don't buy.

09:36.440 --> 09:37.440
Yeah.

09:37.440 --> 09:38.440
Nothing.

09:38.440 --> 09:39.440
She has had...

09:39.440 --> 09:40.440
It's the ultimate like purity.

09:40.440 --> 09:41.440
It's just like, it's supposed to prove something.

09:41.440 --> 09:42.440
And it makes me feel so good.

09:42.440 --> 09:48.720
And I don't understand why people relate to that, because it's like, that's no one.

09:48.720 --> 09:53.960
I think people identify with it, not because they have lived it, but because they do, deep

09:53.960 --> 09:56.760
down inside, believe that it's the ideal.

09:56.760 --> 09:57.760
Yeah.

09:57.760 --> 09:58.760
That's how it should be.

09:58.760 --> 09:59.760
Yeah.

09:59.920 --> 10:00.920
Yeah.

10:00.920 --> 10:01.920
She'll feel nothing until the one comes along.

10:01.920 --> 10:02.920
Yeah.

10:02.920 --> 10:03.920
Because you're only given one.

10:03.920 --> 10:04.920
Yeah.

10:04.920 --> 10:05.920
You're only given one.

10:05.920 --> 10:06.920
So we're going to do that.

10:06.920 --> 10:07.920
Yeah.

10:07.920 --> 10:08.920
Yeah.

10:08.920 --> 10:09.920
She feels nothing until the one comes along.

10:09.920 --> 10:10.920
Yeah.

10:10.920 --> 10:11.920
So we need a father.

10:11.920 --> 10:12.920
We need a mother.

10:12.920 --> 10:13.920
We need...

10:13.920 --> 10:14.920
Yeah.

10:14.920 --> 10:15.920
Maybe a bitchy best friend.

10:15.920 --> 10:16.920
We need, you know, Cthulhu.

10:16.920 --> 10:17.920
Who's his family?

10:17.920 --> 10:18.920
Yeah.

10:18.920 --> 10:19.920
And we also need some like really interesting backstories for all of them, so we can just

10:19.920 --> 10:20.920
kind of allude to them and they completely ignore them.

10:20.920 --> 10:21.920
Yeah.

10:21.920 --> 10:22.920
Because...

10:22.920 --> 10:23.920
They don't play into the plot at all.

10:23.920 --> 10:28.120
Because remember, we're not here to write a great book.

10:28.120 --> 10:33.600
We're here to write a romance paranormal novel, which means we can have all manner and allude

10:33.600 --> 10:38.440
to all manner of interesting things in the background and then we'll just breeze right

10:38.440 --> 10:39.440
by them.

10:39.440 --> 10:40.440
Yeah.

10:40.440 --> 10:41.440
Wee!

10:41.440 --> 10:42.440
Nyarlathotep.

10:42.440 --> 10:43.440
Nyarlathotep.

10:43.440 --> 10:45.360
I really want him to be like the Carlisle.

10:45.360 --> 10:46.920
I'm just throwing it out here.

10:46.920 --> 10:50.640
I want him to be the Carlisle who like understands humans the most because he's the one that's

10:50.640 --> 10:52.600
traveled the longest among us.

10:52.600 --> 10:53.600
Yeah.

10:53.600 --> 10:54.600
He's like dad Weasley.

10:54.600 --> 10:55.600
He's not the one that's been like sleeping.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.600
Yeah.

10:56.600 --> 10:57.600
Yeah.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.080
Weasley.

10:59.080 --> 11:00.080
Little Carlisle.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.080
Tell us.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.800
Who are our fellow characters going to be?

11:02.800 --> 11:06.840
Remember, we have female characters with a blank slate, we have a flighty mother, the

11:06.840 --> 11:10.320
absent emotionally father.

11:10.320 --> 11:13.080
Since we're a little bit more sophisticated than Stephanie Meyer, we can also start thinking

11:13.080 --> 11:14.080
about our antagonist.

11:14.080 --> 11:15.080
Mm.

11:15.080 --> 11:16.080
Because why not?

11:16.080 --> 11:19.440
I mean, I feel like he's going to choose not to end the world, so he's going to piss

11:19.440 --> 11:20.440
somebody off.

11:20.440 --> 11:23.000
So the someone who gets pissed off is the one we have to save the day from.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Yeah.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.560
So who does he piss off by not following his orders?

11:26.560 --> 11:36.120
How can we make him as shh, or her, as thin, as little motivation, as boring?

11:36.120 --> 11:39.120
What's his or her vested interest in seeing the world end?

11:39.120 --> 11:43.120
Hey Vishnu, we can start over again, right?

11:43.120 --> 11:44.120
Yeah, Vishnu.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.120
Oh, that's where Vishnu comes in.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.120
Oh yeah.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.120
We're going to start over.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.120
Don't worry.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.120
We're going to start over.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.120
Don't worry about it.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.120
We're going to start over again.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.120
It turns out the new world is just like the old one.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.120
Bullet, dodge.
