0	5000	Vampires and werewolves used to be scary, lead characters in Halloween tales,
5000	12000	not heartthrobs in love stories that make teenage girls everywhere pine for interspecies romance.
12000	18000	It has been 13 years since Twilight sparkled its way into the pop culture conversation in 2005.
18000	22000	However, the franchise didn't really blow up, nor did the discourse around it start to turn into
22000	27000	why it was the worst thing that ever happened to Western civilization, until around 2008.
27000	28000	You're beautiful.
28000	33000	The discourse around Twilight went from teenagers in TwiMoms liking a thing
33000	35000	Get Edward out of the way!
35000	38000	TwilightMoms.com, we have our own Twilight Moms here.
38000	44000	to the rest of the internet deciding that the popularity of Twilight was the last herald of the end times in about five minutes.
44000	49000	But as a 22-year-old way too into Transformers college grad with a night job working for the Nielsen Company,
49000	53000	I didn't really have it in me to give a shit about this particular culture war,
53000	59000	except for this one thing that really rubbed me the wrong way about Stephanie Meyer.
59000	65000	It came from an article on Cracked.com by forum contributor Okami Spirit on August 19th, 2009,
65000	68000	alleging all sorts of things about Meyer, not just as an author,
68000	72000	but as a person that someone who doesn't like Twilight would obviously take as gospel,
72000	79000	describing Meyer as a self-obsessed, narcissistic, hypocritical, and infantile woman.
79000	85000	Most egregious, according to Okami Spirit, was Stephanie using her brother, Seth, as a shield for criticism.
85000	87000	He runs her site and also comes off as arrogant.
87000	91000	He does not allow any emails to reach his sister that say anything short of
103000	107000	The article goes on to exhoriate Meyer and her brother Seth for filtering Meyer's fan mail,
107000	111000	particularly his decision not to forward a particularly entitled, missive,
111000	115000	demanding an explanation for certain creative decisions Meyer took in Breaking Dawn.
115000	120000	Okami Spirit then paints Seth as completely unreasonable for declining to forward this letter to Stephanie,
120000	123000	and then explaining why he declined to do so to this aggrieved group of fans.
123000	127000	And here's the thing. At the time, I actually sided with the fans.
127000	134000	If you are in the public eye, and you are not able to consider and respond to every ounce of criticism
134000	139000	that is thrown your way, valid or not, then you don't deserve to be there, right?
139000	146000	After all, the discourse around Twilight in 2008 and 2009 was totally reasonable, right?
146000	150000	Well, it's been ten years, and with a hopefully more mature hindsight,
150000	154000	I feel like there isn't really much of a conversation in the discourse re-examining
154000	158000	not only how we treated Twilight, but how we treated Meyer herself.
158000	161000	So, I guess I'll be the one to get this ball rolling.
161000	163000	Dear Stephanie Meyer,
163000	166000	I am sorry.
170000	175000	Twilight is a 2005 paranormal romance novel about a teenage girl who moves to a new town
175000	179000	and immediately falls in love with a hot, sad boy who turns out to be a vampire.
179000	182000	He is obsessed with her, and he wants to love her forever, and she's super into it.
182000	186000	This goes on for four books, and there's also a love triangle with a cute werewolf.
186000	191000	I didn't read Twilight until 2013 when we were developing the Twilight parody Awoken
191000	193000	for our book-themed show, Booze Your Own Adventure.
193000	197000	So even in writing this episode, I have rediscovered the fact that I was apparently
197000	201000	one of those shit garbage people who rated Twilight one star back in 2009,
201000	203000	despite having not even read it.
203000	205000	I gave it two stars after I actually did read it,
205000	208000	though in hindsight, I'd probably be a little more charitable,
208000	212000	because even in 2013, I was mindlessly going along with the groupthink narrative
212000	214000	that Twilight was a blight upon literacy.
214000	217000	But I'm going to admit here and now, and I want you to bear with me,
217000	220000	Twilight, it isn't that bad.
224000	226000	I know, I know, heresy.
226000	228000	I'm not saying it should have won the Booker Prize or anything,
228000	233000	and it might be because I had Twilight as a chaser for books like Cinder and Divergent,
233000	235000	which I genuinely thought were way worse,
235000	238000	but Twilight reads like perfectly passable commercial fiction.
238000	241000	It is emotion-driven rather than prose or plot-driven,
241000	245000	but that's true of a lot of contemporary young adult fiction, and especially of romance novels.
245000	247000	I wasn't going to go recommending it to anyone,
247000	251000	but I didn't have any problem getting through it, unlike certain derivatives.
251000	253000	When I say commercial fiction, by design,
253000	257000	it has to have a lower barrier of entry because more people are reading it,
257000	261000	and YA fiction even more so because its target audience is 14-year-olds.
261000	263000	Whether or not a book is marketed as commercial fiction
263000	266000	has more to do with marketability than of quality,
266000	268000	which itself is somewhat subjective.
268000	271000	That said, in recent days, other works of commercial fiction
271000	276000	are being re-examined for perhaps being not good.
276000	280000	Dan Brown is fascinated with puzzles and logic, and that's what made him famous,
280000	283000	but calling his characters even two-dimensional would be charitable,
283000	285000	and his prose is bad to the point of parody.
285000	288000	Same for Ready Player One, premised solely on the idea
288000	291000	that there is a meaningful reward in life for tying one's personal identity
291000	295000	to the mindless consumption and regurgitation of pop culture artifacts.
295000	297000	Also, it's bad.
297000	304000	Fincher, Kubrick, Lucas, Spielberg, Del Toro, Tarantino, and of course, Kevin Smith.
304000	308000	I studied Monty Python, and not just Holy Grail either.
308000	311000	Everyone became calling them the Sixers.
311000	316000	These days, most gunters refer to them as the Sucksors, because they sucked.
316000	318000	She leaned over and kissed me.
318000	321000	It felt just like all those songs and poems had promised it would.
321000	324000	It felt wonderful, like being struck by lightning.
325000	328000	I am not saying that Twilight deserves to be re-evaluated
328000	330000	because it was secretly good the whole time,
330000	335000	but rather that the level of virulent bile that came to define it and Meyer herself
335000	338000	was actually not in proportion to Twilight's badness,
338000	340000	or anything Stephanie Meyer herself did.
340000	343000	Melissa Rosenberg, who wrote the screenplay for Twilight,
343000	345000	said in a 2012 interview with IndieWire,
345000	348000	When you start to read the criticism of Twilight, it's just vitriol.
348000	351000	It's intense, the contempt, from critics, both men and women.
351000	353000	We've seen more than our fair share of bad action movies,
353000	356000	bad movies geared towards men or 13-year-old boys.
356000	358000	And, you know, the reviews are like,
358000	360000	OK, it was crappy, but it was a fun ride.
360000	361000	But no one says,
361000	364000	Oh my God, if you go see this movie, you're a complete f***ing idiot.
364000	367000	And that's the tone with which people attack Twilight.
367000	372000	The backlash around Twilight that began in the late aughts came on three main fronts.
372000	375000	One, bad prose and story structure problems.
375000	378000	Namely, that there is no plot up until the last 50 pages of the book.
378000	380000	Nothing's gonna happen.
380000	382000	There's seven of us, and there's two of them.
382000	384000	This is the most difficult to dispute.
384000	387000	The first two-thirds of the book are just Edward and Bella mooning over each other,
387000	390000	and then all of a sudden a bad guy shows up, and he wants to eat her.
390000	392000	But then they kill him, and then that's that.
392000	394000	Two, pure baseline, thinly-veiled misogyny
394000	397000	that looks down on everything marketed towards teenage girls.
397000	399000	And as long as I'm committing heresy,
399000	403000	I know I may get blowback for stating what is kind of the obvious to everyone of all stripes,
403000	406000	but we, and by we I mean our culture,
406000	408000	we kind of hate teenage girls.
409000	411000	Whoa!
411000	413000	We hate their music.
416000	418000	We hate their insipid backstabbing.
418000	420000	We hate their vanity.
420000	421000	We hate their selfie sticks.
421000	422000	We hate their makeup.
422000	426000	We hate their stupid books and the stupid sexy actors they made famous
426000	428000	and their stupid sparkly vampires.
428000	432000	Hey girls, let's go get ready to look so good!
432000	433000	Word, word, word.
433000	436000	And then we wonder why so many girls are eager to distance themselves
436000	438000	from being the object of societal contempt.
438000	442000	Are most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs?
442000	444000	John Q, flowers in her hair.
444000	446000	Most girls are idiots.
446000	449000	Hell, there's a reason why in 1999 I went hard on the new metal
449000	452000	while openly broadcasting my disdain for the boy bands
452000	456000	that other, lesser, more woman-y girls voted for on TRL.
456000	459000	Now I know y'all be loving this right here!
459000	461000	L-I-M-P, Biscuit is right here!
461000	463000	Phew, boy did I bet on the wrong horse.
463000	466000	Cause if you don't care, then we don't care!
466000	468000	Again, according to Melissa Rosenberg,
468000	471000	it's also because it's female it's worthy of contempt.
471000	473000	Because it feels female.
473000	474000	It is less than.
474000	477000	So it wasn't just that Twilight was popular.
477000	479000	It's who Twilight was popular with.
479000	480000	Teenage girls.
480000	482000	And the mothers of teenage girls.
482000	485000	And the vast majority of the virulent hatred towards Twilight
485000	487000	didn't really come from grown men,
487000	489000	but from other girls and women who were more than eager
489000	493000	to distance themselves from something so unapologetically female.
493000	496000	And as an aside, not only do I think we done wrong by Stephanie Meyer,
496000	498000	we done wrong by teenage girls too.
498000	500000	Like, being a teenager is hard enough,
500000	503000	but there's something damaging about being made to feel shame
503000	506000	because you relate more to Bella than some other feminist-approved
506000	509000	strong female character who don't need no man to rescue her.
509000	512000	And I'm not saying that trope doesn't have toxic elements
512000	513000	or warrant discussion,
513000	516000	but I also don't think it speaks to some character deficit
516000	519000	if your fantasy is being rescued by a sparkly vampire prince.
519000	523000	Yes, being saved from implied gang rape is lazy and cliched writing,
523000	525000	but it's also popular for a reason.
525000	528000	And you're not stupid if that's your fantasy.
528000	531000	I described three fronts when, really, these are often interconnected.
531000	536000	That, yes, your pop-feminist hot takes can have elements of internalized misogyny.
536000	540000	Namely, the visceral aversion to a thing that women and teenage girls like
540000	542000	while giving a pass to or ignoring altogether
542000	545000	other equally high-profile media of the day.
545000	547000	Hey! Hey!
547000	551000	Bumblebee, stop lubricating the bags.
551000	555000	That has the moral benefit of not needing to provide strong role models
555000	557000	for teenage girls.
557000	559000	So I think that they're both really good people,
559000	562000	but I still think you should be using fictional characters as role models.
562000	565000	Which leads me to the third front of attack,
565000	567000	and what has become the most popular,
567000	572000	that which focuses on the problematic elements of the story.
572000	575000	Bella is 17, and Edward is over 100.
575000	577000	He saves her from attempted gang rape by randos,
577000	579000	which is lame and fanfic-y,
579000	581000	but I totally wrote that fanfic when I was 16,
581000	583000	so stones, glass houses.
583000	586000	Bella is annoyed by her perfectly loving family.
586000	589000	Bella has no interests outside of her vampire boyfriend.
589000	591000	There's this.
591000	593000	I like watching you sleep.
593000	596000	But Twilight is far from unique in any of those regards.
596000	598000	Sometimes I'll see some other piece of media
598000	600000	that hits some of the same beats as the original Twilight novel
600000	603000	spark little or no outrage or even discussion.
603000	605000	What room are you in?
605000	606000	I'm not telling you that.
606000	608000	I see you were in room 625.
608000	610000	Room 625, thank you.
610000	612000	Unless that person is me,
612000	614000	because I'm the only person left in the world who cares about family.
614000	617000	Buffy the Vampire Slayer has the ancient vampire hooking up with a minor,
617000	619000	but you rarely see that treated with anything
619000	622000	resembling the moral outrage over Twilight doing the same.
622000	625000	The Game of Thrones books have much more iffy age difference dynamics
625000	626000	than in the show.
626000	628000	Daenerys is 14 when she gets pregnant,
628000	631000	and yet the sex with her older husband called Drogo
631000	633000	is way more consensual than in the show.
633000	636000	Martin meant this to be a reflection of how young people in medieval Europe,
636000	639000	the time period on which A Song of Ice and Fire is based,
639000	640000	got married.
640000	642000	But you see more pushback against the TV series
642000	644000	for taking what are in the book consensual acts
644000	646000	and turning them non-consensual,
646000	648000	while kind of ignoring the fact that,
648000	649000	in this day and age,
649000	652000	it is generally agreed upon that 13 year olds,
652000	654000	even 13 year olds in 1463,
654000	657000	can't consent to sex with a grown ass man.
657000	660000	More recently, there's the anime The Ancient Magus' Bride,
660000	663000	which hits a lot of the same beats that people take Eshu with in Twilight,
663000	665000	but, um...
665000	666000	more?
674000	677000	The protagonist is 15 instead of 17,
677000	679000	sells herself into slavery,
679000	680000	and is then bought by this guy,
680000	682000	who is considerably more than 100.
682000	686000	He creates a situation in which she is utterly dependent on him.
686000	687000	This happens.
696000	698000	Oh yeah, and he also kind of wants to eat her.
698000	699000	That's there.
699000	700000	Oh, and also this.
713000	714000	Well then.
714000	717000	And yes, we could talk about different cultural standards
717000	719000	and what constitutes a yikes in what country
719000	722000	and what context and when teenagers can even consent,
722000	724000	but, you know, that's its own rabbit hole,
724000	726000	and, you know, I'm gonna not.
738000	740000	Their relationship isn't overtly sexual,
740000	743000	but I wouldn't necessarily call it asexual either.
743000	746000	It exists in this sort of non-committal middle ground,
746000	747000	like Twilight did.
747000	750000	And the not-quite-sexual nature speaks to the appeal of both
750000	754000	when you're a teenage girl who is still in the process of figuring out her sexuality.
754000	757000	The general response as to why the above examples are acceptable
757000	759000	where Twilight is not
759000	761000	is that they contain appropriate levels of
761000	763000	deconstruction.
763000	764000	Hmm.
772000	774000	Which, I guess, sure.
774000	777000	Magespride and Buffy are much more consciously deconstructive
777000	779000	about the tropes they utilize.
788000	791000	But it's not like Twilight is completely without internal examination.
791000	793000	That's Edward Cullen.
793000	796000	He's totally gorgeous, obviously.
796000	799000	But apparently nobody here is good enough for him.
800000	802000	Like I care, you know?
802000	805000	There are quotes in Twilight that are often taken out of context,
805000	807000	like, do I dazzle you?
807000	809000	Which brings to mind a sparkly Fabio,
809000	812000	but in the book is actually kind of more played as like a cutesy joke.
812000	814000	Maybe not a good joke,
814000	816000	but Twilight is not completely lacking in self-awareness
816000	818000	as it is so often assumed to be.
818000	821000	Yes, Jacob imprinting on an infant is creepy,
821000	823000	and the in-universe explanation is, eh?
830000	833000	But it's not like that creepiness goes unremarked upon in the text.
839000	842000	I'm not saying that all criticism of Twilight was disingenuous,
842000	845000	but after a while, the it's problematic argument
845000	848000	starts to feel like a lazy excuse to hate on a popular thing teenage girls liked
848000	850000	rather than good faith criticism.
850000	852000	When I see the bile that was generated
852000	856000	because a mother of three started to write a wish-fulfillment young adult novel
856000	858000	about a cute, sparkly vampire,
858000	861000	and was then expected both by her fans and her detractors
861000	863000	to personally bear the burden of every angry brain fart
863000	866000	some half-educated internet randos had about it
866000	869000	when her book series unexpectedly sold 120 million copies,
869000	872000	it's like, guys, come on.
873000	875000	Imagine getting this constant deluge of feedback,
875000	877000	be it either you change my life for the better
877000	880000	and I'm building a shrine to you in my hometown of Oshkosh, Nebraska
880000	883000	and I will kill myself if you don't come see it by this weekend,
883000	886000	or you are the anti-feminist, anti-Christ, and I hope you burn in hell,
886000	889000	hundreds, maybe even thousands of messages every day,
889000	892000	and then being vilified for not bowing to every possible criticism?
892000	895000	Why was Stephanie Meyer so loathed?
895000	897000	She didn't do anything.
897000	899000	She wrote a wish-fulfillment book.
899000	901000	It's not great, but it is far from the worst of its genre.
901000	904000	And yeah, it is goofy, and parodying it is fun,
904000	907000	and I'm also not saying I'm sorry for Awoken,
907000	910000	which I am still pretty fond of and I don't consider a mean-spirited parody,
910000	913000	or for our fake YA author Sarah Ellenson,
913000	915000	who wasn't so much a critique of Stephanie Meyer
915000	917000	but of the type of thin-skinned YA author
917000	920000	who started fights with people who leave bad reviews on Goodreads,
920000	922000	which Meyer was not.
922000	925000	Considering just how much E.L. James infringed on Meyer's copyright,
925000	927000	outright stole her ideas,
927000	930000	imagine if Stephanie Meyer was the vindictive narcissist
930000	933000	that the 2009 internet made her out to be,
933000	935000	and actually had gone after E.L. James
935000	937000	for what basically amounts to copyright infringement.
937000	940000	Like, what if she had been, like, an Anne Rice type,
940000	943000	and the whole Fifty Shades debacle ended up getting litigated in court?
943000	945000	That probably would have ended up
945000	948000	with the legality of fanfiction in general getting litigated.
948000	950000	And nobody wants that.
950000	953000	So, Meyer had to take the high road.
953000	957000	And, you know, it's fine.
957000	959000	She's fine.
959000	960000	It's fine.
960000	962000	She's, you know, she's fine.
962000	964000	This is fine.
964000	966000	Fifty Shades of Grey?
966000	967000	It's fine.
967000	968000	It's fine.
968000	969000	She's fine.
969000	971000	It's fine.
971000	972000	This is fine.
972000	973000	It's fine.
973000	976000	I don't make love.
976000	977000	I f***.
977000	979000	Yes, Twilight is silly.
979000	981000	You better hold on tight, spider monkey.
981000	983000	A lot of pop culture is silly.
983000	986000	Imagine the same level of vitriol being leveled
986000	989000	equally silly fast in the Furious franchise.
992000	994000	Both franchises are dumb cheese,
994000	996000	but they are dumb cheese targeting different markets.
996000	999000	So why is one dumb cheese the object of so much pearl-clutching
999000	1002000	over who's a good role model for teenage girls,
1002000	1005000	and the other, you know, it's fine?
1005000	1010000	Everyone, this is yours.
1010000	1013000	The backlash to Twilight just wasn't in proportion
1013000	1015000	to what it or its author had done wrong.
1015000	1018000	And I think by now a lot of us have forgotten just how bad it got.
1018000	1021000	Stephanie Meyer just kind of dared to live her bliss
1021000	1024000	in that Tommy Wiseau kind of way that's just a little too personal,
1024000	1026000	a little too revealing.
1026000	1028000	Especially when she says it was based on her dream,
1028000	1031000	and it's like, oh, I had this dream about this really sexy guy,
1031000	1033000	and she just writes this book about it.
1033000	1035000	And like some things about Edward are so specific,
1035000	1037000	and it's like, I was just convinced that,
1037000	1039000	it's like, this woman is mad.
1039000	1043000	She's completely mad, and she's in love with her own fictional creation.
1043000	1046000	But said bliss ended up blowing up into a huge success.
1046000	1049000	She couldn't just be a normal Mormon mom who made it big.
1049000	1051000	There had to be a narrative about Stephanie Meyer,
1051000	1053000	bad person, who wrote a deeply problematic book,
1053000	1057000	and her fans are too stupid to realize what a bad person she is.
1057000	1061000	Honestly, that Stephanie Meyer has gone into that long post-Twilight goodnight
1061000	1063000	without so much as a well-deserved and hearty
1063000	1067000	f*** you to E.L. James and the garbage-entitled portion of her fanbase
1067000	1069000	is downright gracious, and says more about her
1069000	1072000	than any of the mean and downright misogynist projection
1072000	1074000	the world at large did.
1074000	1078000	How does it make you feel that E.L. James took something that you sort of created
1078000	1081000	and used it as inspiration for something that's pretty raunchy
1081000	1083000	and that made her a lot of money?
1083000	1088000	I'm glad that she is doing well and succeeding, and that's cool.
1088000	1091000	The raunchy part, I wish that wasn't attached to Twilight,
1091000	1093000	just because I don't like to think of it that way,
1093000	1096000	but, you know, it doesn't hurt Twilight.
1096000	1099000	Twilight is its own thing, and it's separate, and it's fine.
1100000	1104000	So, Twilight fans, you know your franchise is not beyond reproach,
1104000	1107000	but you should not be made to feel shame for what is ultimately
1107000	1109000	just cheesy romance with sparkly vampires.
1109000	1113000	And Stephanie Meyer, I'm not saying you're some underappreciated genius,
1113000	1116000	but you did not deserve the haranguing and entitlement and hatred
1116000	1119000	that was lobbed at you, and forever buying into it.
1119000	1122000	For that, I am sorry.
1129000	1135000	Okay, this is pedophilia advocacy for Lindsay, take one.
