00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Vampires and werewolves used to be scary, lead characters in Halloween tales,

00:05.000 --> 00:12.000
not heartthrobs in love stories that make teenage girls everywhere pine for interspecies romance.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
It has been 13 years since Twilight sparkled its way into the pop culture conversation in 2005.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
However, the franchise didn't really blow up, nor did the discourse around it start to turn into

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
why it was the worst thing that ever happened to Western civilization, until around 2008.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
You're beautiful.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
The discourse around Twilight went from teenagers in TwiMoms liking a thing

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Get Edward out of the way!

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
TwilightMoms.com, we have our own Twilight Moms here.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
to the rest of the internet deciding that the popularity of Twilight was the last herald of the end times in about five minutes.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
But as a 22-year-old way too into Transformers college grad with a night job working for the Nielsen Company,

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
I didn't really have it in me to give a shit about this particular culture war,

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
except for this one thing that really rubbed me the wrong way about Stephanie Meyer.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
It came from an article on Cracked.com by forum contributor Okami Spirit on August 19th, 2009,

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
alleging all sorts of things about Meyer, not just as an author,

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
but as a person that someone who doesn't like Twilight would obviously take as gospel,

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
describing Meyer as a self-obsessed, narcissistic, hypocritical, and infantile woman.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
Most egregious, according to Okami Spirit, was Stephanie using her brother, Seth, as a shield for criticism.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
He runs her site and also comes off as arrogant.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
He does not allow any emails to reach his sister that say anything short of

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
The article goes on to exhoriate Meyer and her brother Seth for filtering Meyer's fan mail,

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
particularly his decision not to forward a particularly entitled, missive,

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
demanding an explanation for certain creative decisions Meyer took in Breaking Dawn.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
Okami Spirit then paints Seth as completely unreasonable for declining to forward this letter to Stephanie,

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
and then explaining why he declined to do so to this aggrieved group of fans.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
And here's the thing. At the time, I actually sided with the fans.

02:07.000 --> 02:14.000
If you are in the public eye, and you are not able to consider and respond to every ounce of criticism

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
that is thrown your way, valid or not, then you don't deserve to be there, right?

02:19.000 --> 02:26.000
After all, the discourse around Twilight in 2008 and 2009 was totally reasonable, right?

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
Well, it's been ten years, and with a hopefully more mature hindsight,

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
I feel like there isn't really much of a conversation in the discourse re-examining

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
not only how we treated Twilight, but how we treated Meyer herself.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
So, I guess I'll be the one to get this ball rolling.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Dear Stephanie Meyer,

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
I am sorry.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
Twilight is a 2005 paranormal romance novel about a teenage girl who moves to a new town

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
and immediately falls in love with a hot, sad boy who turns out to be a vampire.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
He is obsessed with her, and he wants to love her forever, and she's super into it.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
This goes on for four books, and there's also a love triangle with a cute werewolf.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.000
I didn't read Twilight until 2013 when we were developing the Twilight parody Awoken

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
for our book-themed show, Booze Your Own Adventure.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
So even in writing this episode, I have rediscovered the fact that I was apparently

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
one of those shit garbage people who rated Twilight one star back in 2009,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
despite having not even read it.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
I gave it two stars after I actually did read it,

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
though in hindsight, I'd probably be a little more charitable,

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
because even in 2013, I was mindlessly going along with the groupthink narrative

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
that Twilight was a blight upon literacy.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
But I'm going to admit here and now, and I want you to bear with me,

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Twilight, it isn't that bad.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
I know, I know, heresy.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
I'm not saying it should have won the Booker Prize or anything,

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
and it might be because I had Twilight as a chaser for books like Cinder and Divergent,

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
which I genuinely thought were way worse,

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
but Twilight reads like perfectly passable commercial fiction.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
It is emotion-driven rather than prose or plot-driven,

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
but that's true of a lot of contemporary young adult fiction, and especially of romance novels.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
I wasn't going to go recommending it to anyone,

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
but I didn't have any problem getting through it, unlike certain derivatives.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
When I say commercial fiction, by design,

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
it has to have a lower barrier of entry because more people are reading it,

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
and YA fiction even more so because its target audience is 14-year-olds.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Whether or not a book is marketed as commercial fiction

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
has more to do with marketability than of quality,

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
which itself is somewhat subjective.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
That said, in recent days, other works of commercial fiction

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
are being re-examined for perhaps being not good.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
Dan Brown is fascinated with puzzles and logic, and that's what made him famous,

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
but calling his characters even two-dimensional would be charitable,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
and his prose is bad to the point of parody.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Same for Ready Player One, premised solely on the idea

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
that there is a meaningful reward in life for tying one's personal identity

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
to the mindless consumption and regurgitation of pop culture artifacts.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Also, it's bad.

04:57.000 --> 05:04.000
Fincher, Kubrick, Lucas, Spielberg, Del Toro, Tarantino, and of course, Kevin Smith.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
I studied Monty Python, and not just Holy Grail either.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
Everyone became calling them the Sixers.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
These days, most gunters refer to them as the Sucksors, because they sucked.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
She leaned over and kissed me.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
It felt just like all those songs and poems had promised it would.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
It felt wonderful, like being struck by lightning.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
I am not saying that Twilight deserves to be re-evaluated

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
because it was secretly good the whole time,

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
but rather that the level of virulent bile that came to define it and Meyer herself

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
was actually not in proportion to Twilight's badness,

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
or anything Stephanie Meyer herself did.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Melissa Rosenberg, who wrote the screenplay for Twilight,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
said in a 2012 interview with IndieWire,

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
When you start to read the criticism of Twilight, it's just vitriol.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
It's intense, the contempt, from critics, both men and women.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
We've seen more than our fair share of bad action movies,

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
bad movies geared towards men or 13-year-old boys.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
And, you know, the reviews are like,

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
OK, it was crappy, but it was a fun ride.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
But no one says,

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Oh my God, if you go see this movie, you're a complete f***ing idiot.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
And that's the tone with which people attack Twilight.

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
The backlash around Twilight that began in the late aughts came on three main fronts.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
One, bad prose and story structure problems.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Namely, that there is no plot up until the last 50 pages of the book.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Nothing's gonna happen.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
There's seven of us, and there's two of them.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
This is the most difficult to dispute.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
The first two-thirds of the book are just Edward and Bella mooning over each other,

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
and then all of a sudden a bad guy shows up, and he wants to eat her.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
But then they kill him, and then that's that.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Two, pure baseline, thinly-veiled misogyny

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
that looks down on everything marketed towards teenage girls.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
And as long as I'm committing heresy,

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
I know I may get blowback for stating what is kind of the obvious to everyone of all stripes,

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
but we, and by we I mean our culture,

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
we kind of hate teenage girls.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Whoa!

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
We hate their music.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
We hate their insipid backstabbing.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
We hate their vanity.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
We hate their selfie sticks.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
We hate their makeup.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
We hate their stupid books and the stupid sexy actors they made famous

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
and their stupid sparkly vampires.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
Hey girls, let's go get ready to look so good!

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Word, word, word.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
And then we wonder why so many girls are eager to distance themselves

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
from being the object of societal contempt.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
Are most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
John Q, flowers in her hair.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Most girls are idiots.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Hell, there's a reason why in 1999 I went hard on the new metal

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
while openly broadcasting my disdain for the boy bands

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
that other, lesser, more woman-y girls voted for on TRL.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Now I know y'all be loving this right here!

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
L-I-M-P, Biscuit is right here!

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Phew, boy did I bet on the wrong horse.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Cause if you don't care, then we don't care!

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Again, according to Melissa Rosenberg,

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
it's also because it's female it's worthy of contempt.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Because it feels female.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
It is less than.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
So it wasn't just that Twilight was popular.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
It's who Twilight was popular with.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Teenage girls.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
And the mothers of teenage girls.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
And the vast majority of the virulent hatred towards Twilight

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
didn't really come from grown men,

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
but from other girls and women who were more than eager

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
to distance themselves from something so unapologetically female.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
And as an aside, not only do I think we done wrong by Stephanie Meyer,

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
we done wrong by teenage girls too.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Like, being a teenager is hard enough,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
but there's something damaging about being made to feel shame

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
because you relate more to Bella than some other feminist-approved

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
strong female character who don't need no man to rescue her.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
And I'm not saying that trope doesn't have toxic elements

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
or warrant discussion,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
but I also don't think it speaks to some character deficit

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
if your fantasy is being rescued by a sparkly vampire prince.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
Yes, being saved from implied gang rape is lazy and cliched writing,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
but it's also popular for a reason.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
And you're not stupid if that's your fantasy.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
I described three fronts when, really, these are often interconnected.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
That, yes, your pop-feminist hot takes can have elements of internalized misogyny.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
Namely, the visceral aversion to a thing that women and teenage girls like

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
while giving a pass to or ignoring altogether

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
other equally high-profile media of the day.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Hey! Hey!

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
Bumblebee, stop lubricating the bags.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
That has the moral benefit of not needing to provide strong role models

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
for teenage girls.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
So I think that they're both really good people,

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
but I still think you should be using fictional characters as role models.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Which leads me to the third front of attack,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
and what has become the most popular,

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
that which focuses on the problematic elements of the story.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Bella is 17, and Edward is over 100.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
He saves her from attempted gang rape by randos,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
which is lame and fanfic-y,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
but I totally wrote that fanfic when I was 16,

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
so stones, glass houses.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Bella is annoyed by her perfectly loving family.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Bella has no interests outside of her vampire boyfriend.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
There's this.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
I like watching you sleep.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
But Twilight is far from unique in any of those regards.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Sometimes I'll see some other piece of media

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
that hits some of the same beats as the original Twilight novel

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
spark little or no outrage or even discussion.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
What room are you in?

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
I'm not telling you that.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
I see you were in room 625.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Room 625, thank you.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Unless that person is me,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
because I'm the only person left in the world who cares about family.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
Buffy the Vampire Slayer has the ancient vampire hooking up with a minor,

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
but you rarely see that treated with anything

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
resembling the moral outrage over Twilight doing the same.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
The Game of Thrones books have much more iffy age difference dynamics

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
than in the show.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Daenerys is 14 when she gets pregnant,

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
and yet the sex with her older husband called Drogo

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
is way more consensual than in the show.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Martin meant this to be a reflection of how young people in medieval Europe,

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
the time period on which A Song of Ice and Fire is based,

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
got married.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
But you see more pushback against the TV series

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
for taking what are in the book consensual acts

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
and turning them non-consensual,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
while kind of ignoring the fact that,

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
in this day and age,

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
it is generally agreed upon that 13 year olds,

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
even 13 year olds in 1463,

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
can't consent to sex with a grown ass man.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
More recently, there's the anime The Ancient Magus' Bride,

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
which hits a lot of the same beats that people take Eshu with in Twilight,

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
but, um...

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
more?

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
The protagonist is 15 instead of 17,

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
sells herself into slavery,

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
and is then bought by this guy,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
who is considerably more than 100.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
He creates a situation in which she is utterly dependent on him.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
This happens.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Oh yeah, and he also kind of wants to eat her.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
That's there.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Oh, and also this.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Well then.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
And yes, we could talk about different cultural standards

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
and what constitutes a yikes in what country

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
and what context and when teenagers can even consent,

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
but, you know, that's its own rabbit hole,

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
and, you know, I'm gonna not.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Their relationship isn't overtly sexual,

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
but I wouldn't necessarily call it asexual either.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
It exists in this sort of non-committal middle ground,

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
like Twilight did.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
And the not-quite-sexual nature speaks to the appeal of both

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
when you're a teenage girl who is still in the process of figuring out her sexuality.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
The general response as to why the above examples are acceptable

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
where Twilight is not

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
is that they contain appropriate levels of

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
deconstruction.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Hmm.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Which, I guess, sure.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
Magespride and Buffy are much more consciously deconstructive

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
about the tropes they utilize.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
But it's not like Twilight is completely without internal examination.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
That's Edward Cullen.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
He's totally gorgeous, obviously.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
But apparently nobody here is good enough for him.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Like I care, you know?

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
There are quotes in Twilight that are often taken out of context,

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
like, do I dazzle you?

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Which brings to mind a sparkly Fabio,

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
but in the book is actually kind of more played as like a cutesy joke.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Maybe not a good joke,

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
but Twilight is not completely lacking in self-awareness

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
as it is so often assumed to be.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
Yes, Jacob imprinting on an infant is creepy,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
and the in-universe explanation is, eh?

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
But it's not like that creepiness goes unremarked upon in the text.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
I'm not saying that all criticism of Twilight was disingenuous,

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
but after a while, the it's problematic argument

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
starts to feel like a lazy excuse to hate on a popular thing teenage girls liked

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
rather than good faith criticism.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
When I see the bile that was generated

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
because a mother of three started to write a wish-fulfillment young adult novel

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
about a cute, sparkly vampire,

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
and was then expected both by her fans and her detractors

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
to personally bear the burden of every angry brain fart

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
some half-educated internet randos had about it

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
when her book series unexpectedly sold 120 million copies,

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
it's like, guys, come on.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Imagine getting this constant deluge of feedback,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
be it either you change my life for the better

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
and I'm building a shrine to you in my hometown of Oshkosh, Nebraska

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
and I will kill myself if you don't come see it by this weekend,

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
or you are the anti-feminist, anti-Christ, and I hope you burn in hell,

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
hundreds, maybe even thousands of messages every day,

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
and then being vilified for not bowing to every possible criticism?

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
Why was Stephanie Meyer so loathed?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
She didn't do anything.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
She wrote a wish-fulfillment book.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
It's not great, but it is far from the worst of its genre.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
And yeah, it is goofy, and parodying it is fun,

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
and I'm also not saying I'm sorry for Awoken,

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
which I am still pretty fond of and I don't consider a mean-spirited parody,

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
or for our fake YA author Sarah Ellenson,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
who wasn't so much a critique of Stephanie Meyer

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
but of the type of thin-skinned YA author

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
who started fights with people who leave bad reviews on Goodreads,

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
which Meyer was not.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
Considering just how much E.L. James infringed on Meyer's copyright,

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
outright stole her ideas,

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
imagine if Stephanie Meyer was the vindictive narcissist

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
that the 2009 internet made her out to be,

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
and actually had gone after E.L. James

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
for what basically amounts to copyright infringement.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
Like, what if she had been, like, an Anne Rice type,

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
and the whole Fifty Shades debacle ended up getting litigated in court?

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
That probably would have ended up

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
with the legality of fanfiction in general getting litigated.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
And nobody wants that.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
So, Meyer had to take the high road.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
And, you know, it's fine.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
She's fine.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
It's fine.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
She's, you know, she's fine.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
This is fine.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Fifty Shades of Grey?

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
It's fine.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
It's fine.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
She's fine.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
It's fine.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
This is fine.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
It's fine.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
I don't make love.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
I f***.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Yes, Twilight is silly.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
You better hold on tight, spider monkey.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
A lot of pop culture is silly.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
Imagine the same level of vitriol being leveled

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
equally silly fast in the Furious franchise.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Both franchises are dumb cheese,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
but they are dumb cheese targeting different markets.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
So why is one dumb cheese the object of so much pearl-clutching

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
over who's a good role model for teenage girls,

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
and the other, you know, it's fine?

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
Everyone, this is yours.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
The backlash to Twilight just wasn't in proportion

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
to what it or its author had done wrong.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
And I think by now a lot of us have forgotten just how bad it got.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
Stephanie Meyer just kind of dared to live her bliss

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
in that Tommy Wiseau kind of way that's just a little too personal,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
a little too revealing.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Especially when she says it was based on her dream,

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
and it's like, oh, I had this dream about this really sexy guy,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
and she just writes this book about it.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
And like some things about Edward are so specific,

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
and it's like, I was just convinced that,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
it's like, this woman is mad.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
She's completely mad, and she's in love with her own fictional creation.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
But said bliss ended up blowing up into a huge success.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
She couldn't just be a normal Mormon mom who made it big.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
There had to be a narrative about Stephanie Meyer,

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
bad person, who wrote a deeply problematic book,

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
and her fans are too stupid to realize what a bad person she is.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
Honestly, that Stephanie Meyer has gone into that long post-Twilight goodnight

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
without so much as a well-deserved and hearty

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
f*** you to E.L. James and the garbage-entitled portion of her fanbase

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
is downright gracious, and says more about her

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
than any of the mean and downright misogynist projection

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
the world at large did.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
How does it make you feel that E.L. James took something that you sort of created

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
and used it as inspiration for something that's pretty raunchy

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
and that made her a lot of money?

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
I'm glad that she is doing well and succeeding, and that's cool.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
The raunchy part, I wish that wasn't attached to Twilight,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
just because I don't like to think of it that way,

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
but, you know, it doesn't hurt Twilight.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
Twilight is its own thing, and it's separate, and it's fine.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
So, Twilight fans, you know your franchise is not beyond reproach,

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
but you should not be made to feel shame for what is ultimately

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
just cheesy romance with sparkly vampires.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
And Stephanie Meyer, I'm not saying you're some underappreciated genius,

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
but you did not deserve the haranguing and entitlement and hatred

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
that was lobbed at you, and forever buying into it.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
For that, I am sorry.

18:49.000 --> 18:55.000
Okay, this is pedophilia advocacy for Lindsay, take one.
