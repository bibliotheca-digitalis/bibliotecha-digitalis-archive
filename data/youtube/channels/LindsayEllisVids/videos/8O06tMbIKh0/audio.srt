1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Vampires and werewolves used to be scary, lead characters in Halloween tales,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
not heartthrobs in love stories that make teenage girls everywhere pine for interspecies romance.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It has been 13 years since Twilight sparkled its way into the pop culture conversation in 2005.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
However, the franchise didn't really blow up, nor did the discourse around it start to turn into

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
why it was the worst thing that ever happened to Western civilization, until around 2008.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You're beautiful.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The discourse around Twilight went from teenagers in TwiMoms liking a thing

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Get Edward out of the way!

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
TwilightMoms.com, we have our own Twilight Moms here.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
to the rest of the internet deciding that the popularity of Twilight was the last herald of the end times in about five minutes.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But as a 22-year-old way too into Transformers college grad with a night job working for the Nielsen Company,

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I didn't really have it in me to give a shit about this particular culture war,

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
except for this one thing that really rubbed me the wrong way about Stephanie Meyer.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It came from an article on Cracked.com by forum contributor Okami Spirit on August 19th, 2009,

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
alleging all sorts of things about Meyer, not just as an author,

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
but as a person that someone who doesn't like Twilight would obviously take as gospel,

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
describing Meyer as a self-obsessed, narcissistic, hypocritical, and infantile woman.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Most egregious, according to Okami Spirit, was Stephanie using her brother, Seth, as a shield for criticism.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He runs her site and also comes off as arrogant.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
He does not allow any emails to reach his sister that say anything short of

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The article goes on to exhoriate Meyer and her brother Seth for filtering Meyer's fan mail,

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
particularly his decision not to forward a particularly entitled, missive,

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
demanding an explanation for certain creative decisions Meyer took in Breaking Dawn.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Okami Spirit then paints Seth as completely unreasonable for declining to forward this letter to Stephanie,

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and then explaining why he declined to do so to this aggrieved group of fans.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And here's the thing. At the time, I actually sided with the fans.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If you are in the public eye, and you are not able to consider and respond to every ounce of criticism

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
that is thrown your way, valid or not, then you don't deserve to be there, right?

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
After all, the discourse around Twilight in 2008 and 2009 was totally reasonable, right?

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well, it's been ten years, and with a hopefully more mature hindsight,

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I feel like there isn't really much of a conversation in the discourse re-examining

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
not only how we treated Twilight, but how we treated Meyer herself.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So, I guess I'll be the one to get this ball rolling.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Dear Stephanie Meyer,

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I am sorry.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Twilight is a 2005 paranormal romance novel about a teenage girl who moves to a new town

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and immediately falls in love with a hot, sad boy who turns out to be a vampire.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He is obsessed with her, and he wants to love her forever, and she's super into it.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This goes on for four books, and there's also a love triangle with a cute werewolf.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I didn't read Twilight until 2013 when we were developing the Twilight parody Awoken

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
for our book-themed show, Booze Your Own Adventure.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So even in writing this episode, I have rediscovered the fact that I was apparently

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
one of those shit garbage people who rated Twilight one star back in 2009,

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
despite having not even read it.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I gave it two stars after I actually did read it,

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
though in hindsight, I'd probably be a little more charitable,

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
because even in 2013, I was mindlessly going along with the groupthink narrative

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
that Twilight was a blight upon literacy.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But I'm going to admit here and now, and I want you to bear with me,

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Twilight, it isn't that bad.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I know, I know, heresy.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm not saying it should have won the Booker Prize or anything,

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and it might be because I had Twilight as a chaser for books like Cinder and Divergent,

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
which I genuinely thought were way worse,

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
but Twilight reads like perfectly passable commercial fiction.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It is emotion-driven rather than prose or plot-driven,

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
but that's true of a lot of contemporary young adult fiction, and especially of romance novels.

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I wasn't going to go recommending it to anyone,

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
but I didn't have any problem getting through it, unlike certain derivatives.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
When I say commercial fiction, by design,

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
it has to have a lower barrier of entry because more people are reading it,

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
and YA fiction even more so because its target audience is 14-year-olds.

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Whether or not a book is marketed as commercial fiction

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
has more to do with marketability than of quality,

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
which itself is somewhat subjective.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That said, in recent days, other works of commercial fiction

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
are being re-examined for perhaps being not good.

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Dan Brown is fascinated with puzzles and logic, and that's what made him famous,

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
but calling his characters even two-dimensional would be charitable,

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and his prose is bad to the point of parody.

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Same for Ready Player One, premised solely on the idea

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
that there is a meaningful reward in life for tying one's personal identity

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
to the mindless consumption and regurgitation of pop culture artifacts.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Also, it's bad.

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Fincher, Kubrick, Lucas, Spielberg, Del Toro, Tarantino, and of course, Kevin Smith.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I studied Monty Python, and not just Holy Grail either.

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Everyone became calling them the Sixers.

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
These days, most gunters refer to them as the Sucksors, because they sucked.

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
She leaned over and kissed me.

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It felt just like all those songs and poems had promised it would.

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It felt wonderful, like being struck by lightning.

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I am not saying that Twilight deserves to be re-evaluated

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
because it was secretly good the whole time,

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
but rather that the level of virulent bile that came to define it and Meyer herself

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
was actually not in proportion to Twilight's badness,

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
or anything Stephanie Meyer herself did.

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Melissa Rosenberg, who wrote the screenplay for Twilight,

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
said in a 2012 interview with IndieWire,

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
When you start to read the criticism of Twilight, it's just vitriol.

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's intense, the contempt, from critics, both men and women.

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
We've seen more than our fair share of bad action movies,

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
bad movies geared towards men or 13-year-old boys.

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And, you know, the reviews are like,

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
OK, it was crappy, but it was a fun ride.

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But no one says,

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh my God, if you go see this movie, you're a complete f***ing idiot.

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And that's the tone with which people attack Twilight.

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The backlash around Twilight that began in the late aughts came on three main fronts.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
One, bad prose and story structure problems.

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Namely, that there is no plot up until the last 50 pages of the book.

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Nothing's gonna happen.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
There's seven of us, and there's two of them.

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
This is the most difficult to dispute.

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The first two-thirds of the book are just Edward and Bella mooning over each other,

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and then all of a sudden a bad guy shows up, and he wants to eat her.

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But then they kill him, and then that's that.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Two, pure baseline, thinly-veiled misogyny

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
that looks down on everything marketed towards teenage girls.

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And as long as I'm committing heresy,

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I know I may get blowback for stating what is kind of the obvious to everyone of all stripes,

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
but we, and by we I mean our culture,

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
we kind of hate teenage girls.

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Whoa!

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We hate their music.

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We hate their insipid backstabbing.

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We hate their vanity.

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We hate their selfie sticks.

118
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We hate their makeup.

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We hate their stupid books and the stupid sexy actors they made famous

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and their stupid sparkly vampires.

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Hey girls, let's go get ready to look so good!

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Word, word, word.

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And then we wonder why so many girls are eager to distance themselves

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
from being the object of societal contempt.

125
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Are most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs?

126
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
John Q, flowers in her hair.

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Most girls are idiots.

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Hell, there's a reason why in 1999 I went hard on the new metal

129
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
while openly broadcasting my disdain for the boy bands

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
that other, lesser, more woman-y girls voted for on TRL.

131
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Now I know y'all be loving this right here!

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
L-I-M-P, Biscuit is right here!

133
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Phew, boy did I bet on the wrong horse.

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Cause if you don't care, then we don't care!

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Again, according to Melissa Rosenberg,

136
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
it's also because it's female it's worthy of contempt.

137
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Because it feels female.

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It is less than.

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So it wasn't just that Twilight was popular.

140
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's who Twilight was popular with.

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Teenage girls.

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And the mothers of teenage girls.

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And the vast majority of the virulent hatred towards Twilight

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
didn't really come from grown men,

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
but from other girls and women who were more than eager

146
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
to distance themselves from something so unapologetically female.

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And as an aside, not only do I think we done wrong by Stephanie Meyer,

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
we done wrong by teenage girls too.

149
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Like, being a teenager is hard enough,

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
but there's something damaging about being made to feel shame

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
because you relate more to Bella than some other feminist-approved

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
strong female character who don't need no man to rescue her.

153
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And I'm not saying that trope doesn't have toxic elements

154
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
or warrant discussion,

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
but I also don't think it speaks to some character deficit

156
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
if your fantasy is being rescued by a sparkly vampire prince.

157
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yes, being saved from implied gang rape is lazy and cliched writing,

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
but it's also popular for a reason.

159
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And you're not stupid if that's your fantasy.

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I described three fronts when, really, these are often interconnected.

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That, yes, your pop-feminist hot takes can have elements of internalized misogyny.

162
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Namely, the visceral aversion to a thing that women and teenage girls like

163
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
while giving a pass to or ignoring altogether

164
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
other equally high-profile media of the day.

165
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Hey! Hey!

166
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Bumblebee, stop lubricating the bags.

167
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That has the moral benefit of not needing to provide strong role models

168
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
for teenage girls.

169
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So I think that they're both really good people,

170
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
but I still think you should be using fictional characters as role models.

171
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Which leads me to the third front of attack,

172
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and what has become the most popular,

173
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
that which focuses on the problematic elements of the story.

174
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Bella is 17, and Edward is over 100.

175
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
He saves her from attempted gang rape by randos,

176
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
which is lame and fanfic-y,

177
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
but I totally wrote that fanfic when I was 16,

178
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
so stones, glass houses.

179
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Bella is annoyed by her perfectly loving family.

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Bella has no interests outside of her vampire boyfriend.

181
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
There's this.

182
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I like watching you sleep.

183
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But Twilight is far from unique in any of those regards.

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Sometimes I'll see some other piece of media

185
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
that hits some of the same beats as the original Twilight novel

186
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
spark little or no outrage or even discussion.

187
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What room are you in?

188
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm not telling you that.

189
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I see you were in room 625.

190
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Room 625, thank you.

191
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Unless that person is me,

192
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
because I'm the only person left in the world who cares about family.

193
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Buffy the Vampire Slayer has the ancient vampire hooking up with a minor,

194
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
but you rarely see that treated with anything

195
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
resembling the moral outrage over Twilight doing the same.

196
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The Game of Thrones books have much more iffy age difference dynamics

197
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
than in the show.

198
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Daenerys is 14 when she gets pregnant,

199
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and yet the sex with her older husband called Drogo

200
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
is way more consensual than in the show.

201
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Martin meant this to be a reflection of how young people in medieval Europe,

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
the time period on which A Song of Ice and Fire is based,

203
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
got married.

204
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But you see more pushback against the TV series

205
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
for taking what are in the book consensual acts

206
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and turning them non-consensual,

207
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
while kind of ignoring the fact that,

208
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
in this day and age,

209
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
it is generally agreed upon that 13 year olds,

210
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
even 13 year olds in 1463,

211
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
can't consent to sex with a grown ass man.

212
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
More recently, there's the anime The Ancient Magus' Bride,

213
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
which hits a lot of the same beats that people take Eshu with in Twilight,

214
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
but, um...

215
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
more?

216
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The protagonist is 15 instead of 17,

217
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
sells herself into slavery,

218
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and is then bought by this guy,

219
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
who is considerably more than 100.

220
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
He creates a situation in which she is utterly dependent on him.

221
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
This happens.

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Oh yeah, and he also kind of wants to eat her.

223
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That's there.

224
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Oh, and also this.

225
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Well then.

226
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And yes, we could talk about different cultural standards

227
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
and what constitutes a yikes in what country

228
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and what context and when teenagers can even consent,

229
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
but, you know, that's its own rabbit hole,

230
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and, you know, I'm gonna not.

231
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Their relationship isn't overtly sexual,

232
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
but I wouldn't necessarily call it asexual either.

233
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It exists in this sort of non-committal middle ground,

234
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
like Twilight did.

235
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And the not-quite-sexual nature speaks to the appeal of both

236
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
when you're a teenage girl who is still in the process of figuring out her sexuality.

237
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The general response as to why the above examples are acceptable

238
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
where Twilight is not

239
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
is that they contain appropriate levels of

240
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
deconstruction.

241
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Hmm.

242
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Which, I guess, sure.

243
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Magespride and Buffy are much more consciously deconstructive

244
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
about the tropes they utilize.

245
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But it's not like Twilight is completely without internal examination.

246
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That's Edward Cullen.

247
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
He's totally gorgeous, obviously.

248
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But apparently nobody here is good enough for him.

249
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Like I care, you know?

250
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
There are quotes in Twilight that are often taken out of context,

251
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
like, do I dazzle you?

252
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Which brings to mind a sparkly Fabio,

253
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
but in the book is actually kind of more played as like a cutesy joke.

254
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Maybe not a good joke,

255
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
but Twilight is not completely lacking in self-awareness

256
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
as it is so often assumed to be.

257
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yes, Jacob imprinting on an infant is creepy,

258
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
and the in-universe explanation is, eh?

259
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But it's not like that creepiness goes unremarked upon in the text.

260
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm not saying that all criticism of Twilight was disingenuous,

261
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
but after a while, the it's problematic argument

262
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
starts to feel like a lazy excuse to hate on a popular thing teenage girls liked

263
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
rather than good faith criticism.

264
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
When I see the bile that was generated

265
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
because a mother of three started to write a wish-fulfillment young adult novel

266
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
about a cute, sparkly vampire,

267
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and was then expected both by her fans and her detractors

268
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
to personally bear the burden of every angry brain fart

269
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
some half-educated internet randos had about it

270
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
when her book series unexpectedly sold 120 million copies,

271
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
it's like, guys, come on.

272
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Imagine getting this constant deluge of feedback,

273
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
be it either you change my life for the better

274
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and I'm building a shrine to you in my hometown of Oshkosh, Nebraska

275
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
and I will kill myself if you don't come see it by this weekend,

276
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
or you are the anti-feminist, anti-Christ, and I hope you burn in hell,

277
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
hundreds, maybe even thousands of messages every day,

278
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
and then being vilified for not bowing to every possible criticism?

279
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Why was Stephanie Meyer so loathed?

280
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
She didn't do anything.

281
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
She wrote a wish-fulfillment book.

282
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's not great, but it is far from the worst of its genre.

283
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And yeah, it is goofy, and parodying it is fun,

284
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
and I'm also not saying I'm sorry for Awoken,

285
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
which I am still pretty fond of and I don't consider a mean-spirited parody,

286
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
or for our fake YA author Sarah Ellenson,

287
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
who wasn't so much a critique of Stephanie Meyer

288
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
but of the type of thin-skinned YA author

289
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
who started fights with people who leave bad reviews on Goodreads,

290
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
which Meyer was not.

291
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Considering just how much E.L. James infringed on Meyer's copyright,

292
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
outright stole her ideas,

293
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
imagine if Stephanie Meyer was the vindictive narcissist

294
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
that the 2009 internet made her out to be,

295
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and actually had gone after E.L. James

296
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
for what basically amounts to copyright infringement.

297
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Like, what if she had been, like, an Anne Rice type,

298
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
and the whole Fifty Shades debacle ended up getting litigated in court?

299
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
That probably would have ended up

300
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
with the legality of fanfiction in general getting litigated.

301
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And nobody wants that.

302
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So, Meyer had to take the high road.

303
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And, you know, it's fine.

304
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
She's fine.

305
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's fine.

306
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
She's, you know, she's fine.

307
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
This is fine.

308
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Fifty Shades of Grey?

309
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's fine.

310
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's fine.

311
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
She's fine.

312
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's fine.

313
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
This is fine.

314
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's fine.

315
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I don't make love.

316
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I f***.

317
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yes, Twilight is silly.

318
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You better hold on tight, spider monkey.

319
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
A lot of pop culture is silly.

320
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Imagine the same level of vitriol being leveled

321
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
equally silly fast in the Furious franchise.

322
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Both franchises are dumb cheese,

323
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
but they are dumb cheese targeting different markets.

324
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So why is one dumb cheese the object of so much pearl-clutching

325
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
over who's a good role model for teenage girls,

326
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
and the other, you know, it's fine?

327
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Everyone, this is yours.

328
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The backlash to Twilight just wasn't in proportion

329
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
to what it or its author had done wrong.

330
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And I think by now a lot of us have forgotten just how bad it got.

331
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Stephanie Meyer just kind of dared to live her bliss

332
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
in that Tommy Wiseau kind of way that's just a little too personal,

333
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
a little too revealing.

334
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Especially when she says it was based on her dream,

335
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
and it's like, oh, I had this dream about this really sexy guy,

336
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
and she just writes this book about it.

337
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And like some things about Edward are so specific,

338
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and it's like, I was just convinced that,

339
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
it's like, this woman is mad.

340
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
She's completely mad, and she's in love with her own fictional creation.

341
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But said bliss ended up blowing up into a huge success.

342
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
She couldn't just be a normal Mormon mom who made it big.

343
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
There had to be a narrative about Stephanie Meyer,

344
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
bad person, who wrote a deeply problematic book,

345
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
and her fans are too stupid to realize what a bad person she is.

346
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Honestly, that Stephanie Meyer has gone into that long post-Twilight goodnight

347
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
without so much as a well-deserved and hearty

348
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
f*** you to E.L. James and the garbage-entitled portion of her fanbase

349
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
is downright gracious, and says more about her

350
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
than any of the mean and downright misogynist projection

351
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
the world at large did.

352
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
How does it make you feel that E.L. James took something that you sort of created

353
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
and used it as inspiration for something that's pretty raunchy

354
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
and that made her a lot of money?

355
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm glad that she is doing well and succeeding, and that's cool.

356
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The raunchy part, I wish that wasn't attached to Twilight,

357
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
just because I don't like to think of it that way,

358
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
but, you know, it doesn't hurt Twilight.

359
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Twilight is its own thing, and it's separate, and it's fine.

360
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So, Twilight fans, you know your franchise is not beyond reproach,

361
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
but you should not be made to feel shame for what is ultimately

362
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
just cheesy romance with sparkly vampires.

363
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And Stephanie Meyer, I'm not saying you're some underappreciated genius,

364
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
but you did not deserve the haranguing and entitlement and hatred

365
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
that was lobbed at you, and forever buying into it.

366
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
For that, I am sorry.

367
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Okay, this is pedophilia advocacy for Lindsay, take one.
