00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
There is a scene in Michael Bay's 2003 film, Bad Boys 2, in which Marcus, played by Martin Lawrence,

00:05.800 --> 00:09.600
has had enough of the tension between he and his partner Mike, played by Will Smith,

00:09.600 --> 00:13.000
who had earlier accidentally shot him in the backside during a shootout.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.900
Unbeknownst to the pair, their conversation is being filmed on a camera that has been left on a stand in the room,

00:17.900 --> 00:20.500
and is being broadcast live to an adjacent store.

00:20.500 --> 00:23.300
Oh, I did your ass.

00:23.300 --> 00:28.100
When you pop me from behind, I think you damaged some nerves.

00:28.100 --> 00:30.600
My ass still hurts.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.400
From what you did to it the other night?

00:33.400 --> 00:35.000
Oh, my lord.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.200
To the store customers, who don't have the benefit of context the narrative has provided to us,

00:39.200 --> 00:44.600
Mike and Marcus' conversation sounds like a frank conversation between two gay lovers about their sex life.

00:44.600 --> 00:48.200
That poor man is pouring out his heart.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.800
I'm still flaccid.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.600
Um, okay.

00:51.600 --> 00:55.800
I mean, we got caught up in the moment, shit got crazy.

00:55.800 --> 01:01.100
You know how I get. From now on, you can't say the word flaccid to me.

01:01.100 --> 01:03.900
He's a mean fuck.

01:03.900 --> 01:06.000
Welcome back to The Whole Plate.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.300
This is Queer Theory.

01:07.300 --> 01:14.600
I hate the whole plate.

01:14.600 --> 01:19.200
Yeah, that's right. We're back and piggybacking off of last season.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.400
That's what we're gonna call it.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.900
Slipping it under the wire for Pride Month, it's time to talk about Queer Theory.

01:23.900 --> 01:29.100
And if you're wondering, really, you're going to try to use Transformers to explain Queer Theory?

01:29.100 --> 01:34.600
Well, yeah, I mean, A, that's kind of the point, but B, you can queer anything.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.100
I am directly below.

01:37.100 --> 01:38.200
Enemy scrotum.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.300
Anything.

01:40.300 --> 01:43.300
Bumblebee, stop lubricating the mat.

01:43.300 --> 01:48.200
So Queer Theory is a relative newcomer to other frameworks like, for instance, feminist film theory,

01:48.200 --> 01:53.000
which itself is also kind of a newcomer, itself only about 50 years old in film studies.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.900
Queer Theory really only began to get mainstream academic attention some 20-odd years after that,

01:57.900 --> 02:00.300
in no small part thanks to the AIDS crisis.

02:00.300 --> 02:05.100
And like all of these theoretical frameworks, does not necessarily have the same nomenclature everywhere.

02:05.100 --> 02:08.000
There are plenty of people who do not like the term Queer Theory

02:08.000 --> 02:12.600
because it is, in effect, an academic term that appropriates a reclaimed slur.

02:12.600 --> 02:16.900
But Queer Theory is the most broad and common term in academia, so that's the one I'm using.

02:16.900 --> 02:18.600
So what is the point of Queer Theory?

02:18.600 --> 02:26.200
Well, like feminist theory, the ultimate point is sort of to de-center the assumed default perspective of culture makers.

02:26.200 --> 02:32.000
In this case, straight people, specifically straight, cis, white men, as the sole arbiters of culture.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.300
It uses this framework to study queer identity, depictions of queer identity, and also to reframe a queer perspective.

02:38.300 --> 02:43.200
So yeah, there's actually a lot more to it than just, you know, analyzing Brokeback Mountain over and over again.

02:43.200 --> 02:48.300
This type of framework is necessary because historically, queer populations and perspectives have been marginalized,

02:48.300 --> 02:54.000
and just as often, pathologized, and still are in many places in the world.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.700
Happy Pride!

02:56.700 --> 03:04.700
According to author Frederick Green, politically, Queer Theory may be described as the theoretical wing of the gay and lesbian liberation-slash-civil-rights struggle,

03:04.700 --> 03:08.000
a struggle which comprehends more than just the sphere of sexuality.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.400
Queer Theory argues that there is beauty, power, and truth, even magic,

03:11.400 --> 03:15.900
where dominant culture and its authorized language posits only ugliness, impotence, and falsehood.

03:16.000 --> 03:24.600
Queer Theory's emphatic pluralizing of sexuality resists the normative dualistic economy that limits erotic activity and coerces identity into deadening confines.

03:24.600 --> 03:27.000
Though fairly new, Queer Theory is quite broad.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.900
It isn't just interpreting queer texts.

03:28.900 --> 03:34.200
A lot of it is also interpreting and contextualizing queer coding, made by the straights.

03:35.600 --> 03:42.800
I talked at much greater length about the difference between allegory and coding in our video about Bright and why Bright is a bad movie.

03:42.800 --> 03:48.300
But in short, coding uses stereotyping and shorthand in order to get across a certain thing.

03:48.300 --> 03:53.500
If you, for instance, want, like, effete villainy, queer coding's your boy.

03:53.500 --> 03:54.700
Hmm, hello.

03:56.100 --> 03:57.600
Ooh, lovely.

03:57.600 --> 04:01.800
Coding appropriates stereotyping and shorthand in order to get a point across.

04:01.800 --> 04:08.400
And queer coding has been a popular mainstream shorthand in film because the degenerates are bad and you don't want to like them.

04:08.400 --> 04:12.300
A common example of queer coding often comes in the form of villainy.

04:12.300 --> 04:17.800
Peter Lorre's villainous Joel Cairo in The Maltese Falcon has become a sort of ur-example of this.

04:17.800 --> 04:21.100
He is effeminate, he's delicate, he's conniving.

04:21.100 --> 04:23.100
He's a little too into you.

04:23.100 --> 04:25.100
You stupid fathead, you!

04:27.800 --> 04:31.300
Similarly, we have the original Invisible Man, starring Claude Rains,

04:31.300 --> 04:35.900
who spurns his fiancÃ©e, becomes invisible, tries to find a male partner in crime...

04:35.900 --> 04:37.900
I must have a partner, Kemp.

04:37.900 --> 04:41.100
...and then becomes visible only after he is killed by the police.

04:41.100 --> 04:43.900
Queer coding in villains is not just limited to the 40s.

04:43.900 --> 04:46.900
In fact, this sort of coding would only get more explicit over time.

04:46.900 --> 04:49.800
Examples contemporary to the original Transformers cartoon,

04:49.800 --> 04:53.100
in which the villain was either an explicit or implied homosexual,

04:53.100 --> 04:58.500
include Dressed to Kill, Commando, and Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior.

04:58.500 --> 05:01.600
Again, you have made me unleash my dogs of war.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.100
And then, of course, there are the Disney villains.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.000
Uncle Scar.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.200
Oh, I shall practice my curse.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.500
Governor Ratcliffe.

05:10.500 --> 05:11.900
You see how I treat her.

05:11.900 --> 05:14.500
Professor Rattigan and Basil, Bitter Exes.

05:15.300 --> 05:19.500
Though frankly, I expected you 15 minutes earlier.

05:20.500 --> 05:23.700
Trouble with the chemistry set, old boy.

05:23.700 --> 05:26.800
And, of course, Ursula, the Sea Witch.

05:26.800 --> 05:33.000
And don't underestimate the importance of body language.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.300
Whose design was actually based on Drag Queen Divine.

05:36.300 --> 05:38.500
I'd like to set fire to this dump.

05:38.500 --> 05:42.700
Now, while queer-coded villains can definitely have negative real-world repercussions,

05:42.700 --> 05:45.100
that doesn't mean that it's always negative.

05:45.100 --> 05:49.800
Queer communities have often embraced queer-coded villains as a sort of reclamation of power.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.200
Like, yeah, these are my people.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.900
It's also handy for questioning traditional power structures,

05:53.900 --> 05:56.100
which your typical Hollywood hero represents.

05:56.100 --> 05:58.900
There is a reason why those queers do so love their Disney villains.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.300
You see how I treat her.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.600
Oh, I shall practice my curtsy.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.300
Body language.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.500
But queer-coding is not limited to villains.

06:07.500 --> 06:12.500
Superhero movies, which the Transformers movies are, kind of, arguably,

06:12.500 --> 06:14.700
also have elements of queer-coding.

06:14.700 --> 06:18.000
Often the acquisition of superpowers, most notably with Spider-Man,

06:18.000 --> 06:19.400
occurs during adolescence.

06:19.400 --> 06:24.300
And what you do with said powers can read as an analog for coming to terms with personal identity.

06:24.300 --> 06:28.200
Superhero movies have been known to have a certain aesthetic.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.900
Thor Ragnarok is an amazing recent example.

06:30.900 --> 06:34.800
What? Grandmaster uses it for his good times, orgies and stuff.

06:34.900 --> 06:37.400
Did you just say that Grandmaster used it for orgies?

06:37.400 --> 06:39.700
Yeah. Don't touch anything.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.800
And was recently named by Vulture the gayest Marvel movie.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.900
It's my birthday!

06:44.900 --> 06:46.900
It's my birthday!

06:46.900 --> 06:48.900
It's my birthday!

06:48.900 --> 06:51.600
Superhero movies are often coming-out narratives.

06:51.600 --> 06:56.500
The X-Men films, particularly X2, are very on-the-nose with this.

06:56.500 --> 07:00.600
Have you tried not being a mutant?

07:00.700 --> 07:04.700
A class of people, focusing on teenagers, who get their powers during adolescence,

07:04.700 --> 07:09.000
are shunned by society, and their narrative is about figuring out their place in the world.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.700
Now, to call the Transformers superhero films, which they kind of are, kind of,

07:13.700 --> 07:17.700
or at least I think Hasbro wanted them to be before Michael Bay just pumped them with so much hate,

07:17.700 --> 07:22.700
but on paper, a lot of what makes superhero films queer-coded has to do with

07:22.700 --> 07:27.500
the narrative arc, the villain, and where we come into it in the narrative.

07:27.600 --> 07:31.400
And in theory, the Transformers are, well, they're well past adolescence.

07:31.400 --> 07:34.400
There's definite queer-coding in this idea that we have to hide our identity,

07:34.400 --> 07:38.400
but the movies do not bother with this at all.

07:38.400 --> 07:43.100
So as it is, since the movies for the most part kind of ignore the whole robots-in-disguise thing,

07:43.100 --> 07:46.400
to me, the whole Transformers concept would read more as an immigrant narrative

07:46.400 --> 07:50.400
than a queer coming-out narrative, which the movies kind of lean into.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.100
Kind of.

07:51.100 --> 07:53.400
I'm kicking the Autobots out.

07:53.400 --> 07:54.900
Can you believe this is happening?

07:54.900 --> 07:57.100
Kind of. Oh God, it's so bad.

07:57.100 --> 07:58.800
I don't know what truck you're talking about.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.800
Kind of cost American lives.

08:00.800 --> 08:05.300
But that doesn't mean that there's nothing here to work with.

08:05.300 --> 08:09.100
According to film historian Lisa Peirce in her book Contemporary Action Cinema,

08:09.100 --> 08:11.500
action cinema is traditionally masculinist,

08:11.500 --> 08:15.600
heavily invested in reinforcing dominant constructions of masculinity as active,

08:15.600 --> 08:18.000
physically strong, rational, and powerful,

08:18.000 --> 08:23.300
values which, as we have seen, are predominantly embodied in the figure of the white heterosexual male.

08:23.300 --> 08:25.500
There are no openly gay action heroes.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.500
Two exceptions might be asserted.

08:27.500 --> 08:31.400
The detective thriller Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and historical epic Alexander.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.800
But despite the dominant narrative of most action movies,

08:33.800 --> 08:37.500
there is not to say that there is no queer coding or undertones in action movies.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.900
A lot of Michael Bay movies lend themselves to queer readings

08:39.900 --> 08:43.100
as male-male relationships tend to be the focus in his films.

08:43.100 --> 08:46.000
Again, see the example of Bad Boys and Bad Boys 2.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.200
According to Peirce, with regard to this scene,

08:48.200 --> 08:51.900
the two heterosexual male heroes are momentarily misrecognized as gay

08:51.900 --> 08:56.000
and unwittingly perform homosexuality to the watching store customers.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.800
The scene's comic free zone derives not simply from the fact

08:58.800 --> 09:03.500
that it is a variation on the long-standing comic trope of a straight man playing gay,

09:03.500 --> 09:08.000
but also the film's assumption of the impossibility of an openly gay action hero.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
Why don't you just give it a little kiss, man? You know, so it'll feel better.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.700
Hey, just pretend like we're not even here.

09:12.700 --> 09:14.600
Isn't Ricky Martin having a concert?

09:14.600 --> 09:17.500
In effect, when Michael Bay does recognize queer identities,

09:17.500 --> 09:19.700
it is to use them as a comic prop,

09:19.700 --> 09:23.200
to reassert the absurdity of a queer action hero.

09:23.800 --> 09:26.800
Losers always whine about their best.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.800
Winners go home and fuck the prom queen.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.500
And, of course, there is Pain and Gain,

09:32.500 --> 09:38.300
a film which is deeply interested in threats to traditional masculinity.

09:38.300 --> 09:39.800
Oh, Pain and Gain.

09:39.800 --> 09:40.800
I'm hot!

09:42.300 --> 09:43.000
I'm big!

09:43.000 --> 09:45.100
Pain and Gain.

09:45.100 --> 09:47.300
You want to be a monument to physical perfection?

09:47.300 --> 09:48.500
You want to be a shrine?

09:50.000 --> 09:50.800
You should be.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.800
But here is the problem with queer readings in the Transformers movies.

09:53.800 --> 09:57.100
The juvenile no-homo humor is... there.

09:57.100 --> 09:58.600
I've had a hell of a day!

09:59.600 --> 10:02.100
Why don't you get a haircut with your bitch ass?

10:02.100 --> 10:03.300
Go whine to your boyfriend.

10:03.300 --> 10:05.700
Why would alien robots say that?

10:05.700 --> 10:07.800
Oh, look who came sashaying back.

10:07.800 --> 10:11.200
But despite there being lots of potential for queer readings in this franchise,

10:11.200 --> 10:14.100
again, robots in disguise, fam.

10:14.100 --> 10:16.400
Bay has scrubbed away that potential.

10:16.400 --> 10:19.200
Most movies and television shows popular with queer readings

10:19.200 --> 10:22.700
tend to have characters that, you know, like each other.

10:22.700 --> 10:24.500
Or at least grow to like each other.

10:24.500 --> 10:28.500
In action movies, the homoerotic subtext, especially in buddy action movies,

10:28.500 --> 10:30.300
is often acknowledged and refuted.

10:30.300 --> 10:32.400
Michael Bay loves doing this.

10:32.400 --> 10:36.700
From now on, you can't say the word flaccid to me.

10:36.700 --> 10:38.600
He's a mean fuck.

10:38.600 --> 10:42.600
But the Transformers movies are characterized by people not liking each other.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.000
Is there a car?

10:44.000 --> 10:45.100
Huh?

10:45.100 --> 10:47.500
Like, sure, on paper they do, but in practice...

10:47.600 --> 10:50.500
I adore you.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.700
That's not the word that I want to hear.

10:52.700 --> 10:55.000
You'd get your ass kicked in Ireland for saying that.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.200
Oh, we're not in Ireland. Lucky Charms, we're in Texas.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.500
So he drives? What do you mean he drives? Like for a living?

10:59.500 --> 11:01.000
Yeah.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.200
Yes, he makes a living.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.600
There are no buddies to be buddy cops.

11:04.600 --> 11:08.800
Everyone makes constant reference to their loathing for everyone else.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.200
Even the robots.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.800
Especially the robots.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.400
What you get for taking a yellow bugger,

11:14.400 --> 11:16.000
you need a leader out there.

11:16.900 --> 11:17.900
Shut up!

11:17.900 --> 11:20.400
Cut the crap before I drop a grenade down your throat.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.500
Oh, look, we can't sashay him back.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.100
Hair growing like a chia pet, look.

11:24.100 --> 11:29.200
Even the male-female relationships are characterized by distrust, insecurity, and possessiveness.

11:29.200 --> 11:33.200
The male-male interactions are that, minus the pretense of trying to, quote,

11:33.200 --> 11:35.300
make things work, end quote.

11:35.300 --> 11:40.300
Mark Wahlberg competing with all of the boys to be the most masculine in the room got two whole movies.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.100
I've been happy to give you a tour. I'll show you three other bars I got buried up back then.

11:43.100 --> 11:44.600
I'll crack your head open like an egg!

11:44.700 --> 11:46.700
That is how no-homo he is.

11:46.700 --> 11:51.100
The Transformers themselves should naturally take on these roles of buddy cop,

11:51.100 --> 11:53.900
and do in most other Transformers media,

11:53.900 --> 11:59.100
but Bay doesn't seem to know how to frame these human-robot relationships other than object-owner.

11:59.100 --> 12:05.300
Sam is allowed to love Bumblebee in the way that one loves one's property,

12:05.300 --> 12:08.400
because Sam treats Bumblebee like his dog or his object.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.100
Just break down. Just go in the garage quietly.

12:10.100 --> 12:11.800
I'm sorry.

12:11.800 --> 12:16.600
There is no need for the requisite Bay-ian no-homo, because Bumblebee is effectively an animal,

12:16.600 --> 12:19.100
and Sam's relationship with Optimus is utterly sterile,

12:19.100 --> 12:22.300
because Optimus functions basically as a military general.

12:22.300 --> 12:26.000
Aside from one attempt at sincerity in Transformers 1...

12:26.000 --> 12:29.900
You risked your life to protect the cube.

12:29.900 --> 12:33.400
No sacrifice. No victory.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.100
Bay got bored of that pretty quick.

12:35.100 --> 12:37.500
The closest we get to an actual camaraderie of partners

12:37.600 --> 12:42.100
is the Cogman-Anthony Hopkins relationship in Transformers 5.

12:42.100 --> 12:43.600
And speaking of queer-coding...

12:51.600 --> 12:53.900
Ah, there it is.

12:53.900 --> 12:58.800
It took us five movies to finally get a bitchy C-3PO ripoff, but here we are.

12:58.800 --> 13:02.300
Leprechauns are tiny, green, and Irish, and that is offensive.

13:02.300 --> 13:03.900
He's British. He's a manservant.

13:03.900 --> 13:07.200
He appears to be Anthony Hopkins's live-in partner.

13:07.300 --> 13:10.000
It was making the moment more epic.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.100
Just be quiet. What's the matter with you?

13:13.100 --> 13:15.500
If I could find his neck, I'd strangle him.

13:15.500 --> 13:19.300
You know, if you don't stop it, I will send you back to Cybertron in a little tiny box.

13:19.300 --> 13:20.400
Oh, scary.

13:20.400 --> 13:24.500
And he even makes a lovely sushi dinner for you loathsome straights.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.900
No canoodling.

13:25.900 --> 13:29.900
So there it is. Cogman. The queerest thing in the Transformers movies.

13:29.900 --> 13:32.600
And just as hate-filled as everything else.

13:32.600 --> 13:36.100
And no doubt a solid 70% of you have already written a novel-length screed

13:36.100 --> 13:39.900
in the comments that I am not going to read about what did you expect?

13:39.900 --> 13:44.400
Why would you ever think you're going to get some queer readings in Transformers media?

13:44.400 --> 13:48.900
Ah, yes, and that is the sound of the 30% of you who have read the IDW comics.

13:48.900 --> 13:51.600
And yes, you know exactly where we're going with this.

13:51.600 --> 13:56.000
The recent trend in the IDW comics is not only to suggest that gender is a thing,

13:56.000 --> 13:58.100
but not offer an explanation for it.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.600
Which, honestly, thank God.

13:59.600 --> 14:04.600
Because feeling compelled to explain the existence of why females might exist is tiresome.

14:04.600 --> 14:08.300
But also that, sure, why wouldn't the Transformers pair-bond?

14:08.300 --> 14:13.000
And why would heteronormativity even be a thing for a race of asexual robots?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.900
So in the comics, there is pair-bonding.

14:14.900 --> 14:16.600
There are different forms of pair-bonding.

14:16.600 --> 14:20.100
There are male robots, female robots, non-binary robots.

14:20.100 --> 14:23.000
Even robots that were made one gender and then later decided,

14:23.000 --> 14:24.900
wait, I'm actually a different gender.

14:24.900 --> 14:28.500
They still fight and turn into cars and have relationships and get married.

14:28.500 --> 14:31.500
Well, they don't call it getting married, but gender doesn't really come into play.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.000
Because why would it?

14:33.000 --> 14:37.100
The Transformers universe is kind of like Star Wars, one with infinite possibilities.

14:37.100 --> 14:41.300
So why not play with what gender and relationships would look like to alien robots?

14:41.300 --> 14:44.700
Honestly, given the franchise's potential, the Michael Bay oeuvre,

14:44.700 --> 14:47.900
and the way he loves stereotyping,

14:47.900 --> 14:51.800
it's surprising that there isn't more deliberate queer coding here to work with.

14:51.800 --> 14:56.900
So what does this say about any emotional investment that Michael Bay has in these characters?

14:58.900 --> 15:02.500
Michael Bay's better films are also much more openly no-homo.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.700
Because his better films tend to be framed around a sort of relationship,

15:05.700 --> 15:07.800
usually a male-male relationship.

15:07.800 --> 15:11.900
But Bay also knows to speak to the insecurities that men have around these sort of relationships,

15:11.900 --> 15:14.000
which is in itself extremely telling.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.100
In movies where people are allowed to like each other, by which I mean the male leads,

15:18.100 --> 15:21.700
we have to take the time to acknowledge the inherent comedy of homoeroticism.

15:21.700 --> 15:25.300
But in the Transformers movies, a franchise in which everyone hates each other

15:25.300 --> 15:27.700
and are just kind of screaming at each other constantly,

15:27.700 --> 15:31.900
there is no need to acknowledge, mock, or refute any inferred homoeroticism.

15:31.900 --> 15:36.100
Because Bay doesn't even bother making the pretense that these characters can grow to like each other.

15:37.100 --> 15:42.500
On an unrelated note, I'm going to spend the rest of this year trying not to get my hopes up about Bumblebee,

15:42.500 --> 15:47.000
a movie which Michael Bay has almost nothing to do with.

15:48.500 --> 15:49.900
Happy Pride!

16:01.900 --> 16:03.900
You
