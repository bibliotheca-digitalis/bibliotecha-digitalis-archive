1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
There is a scene in Michael Bay's 2003 film, Bad Boys 2, in which Marcus, played by Martin Lawrence,

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,600
has had enough of the tension between he and his partner Mike, played by Will Smith,

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,000
who had earlier accidentally shot him in the backside during a shootout.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,900
Unbeknownst to the pair, their conversation is being filmed on a camera that has been left on a stand in the room,

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,500
and is being broadcast live to an adjacent store.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,300
Oh, I did your ass.

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,100
When you pop me from behind, I think you damaged some nerves.

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,600
My ass still hurts.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,400
From what you did to it the other night?

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,000
Oh, my lord.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,200
To the store customers, who don't have the benefit of context the narrative has provided to us,

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,600
Mike and Marcus' conversation sounds like a frank conversation between two gay lovers about their sex life.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,200
That poor man is pouring out his heart.

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,800
I'm still flaccid.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,600
Um, okay.

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,800
I mean, we got caught up in the moment, shit got crazy.

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,100
You know how I get. From now on, you can't say the word flaccid to me.

18
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,900
He's a mean fuck.

19
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,000
Welcome back to The Whole Plate.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,300
This is Queer Theory.

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:14,600
I hate the whole plate.

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,200
Yeah, that's right. We're back and piggybacking off of last season.

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,400
That's what we're gonna call it.

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,900
Slipping it under the wire for Pride Month, it's time to talk about Queer Theory.

25
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:29,100
And if you're wondering, really, you're going to try to use Transformers to explain Queer Theory?

26
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,600
Well, yeah, I mean, A, that's kind of the point, but B, you can queer anything.

27
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,100
I am directly below.

28
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,200
Enemy scrotum.

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,300
Anything.

30
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,300
Bumblebee, stop lubricating the mat.

31
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:48,200
So Queer Theory is a relative newcomer to other frameworks like, for instance, feminist film theory,

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,000
which itself is also kind of a newcomer, itself only about 50 years old in film studies.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,900
Queer Theory really only began to get mainstream academic attention some 20-odd years after that,

34
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,300
in no small part thanks to the AIDS crisis.

35
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:05,100
And like all of these theoretical frameworks, does not necessarily have the same nomenclature everywhere.

36
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,000
There are plenty of people who do not like the term Queer Theory

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,600
because it is, in effect, an academic term that appropriates a reclaimed slur.

38
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,900
But Queer Theory is the most broad and common term in academia, so that's the one I'm using.

39
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,600
So what is the point of Queer Theory?

40
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:26,200
Well, like feminist theory, the ultimate point is sort of to de-center the assumed default perspective of culture makers.

41
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:32,000
In this case, straight people, specifically straight, cis, white men, as the sole arbiters of culture.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,300
It uses this framework to study queer identity, depictions of queer identity, and also to reframe a queer perspective.

43
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:43,200
So yeah, there's actually a lot more to it than just, you know, analyzing Brokeback Mountain over and over again.

44
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,300
This type of framework is necessary because historically, queer populations and perspectives have been marginalized,

45
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:54,000
and just as often, pathologized, and still are in many places in the world.

46
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,700
Happy Pride!

47
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:04,700
According to author Frederick Green, politically, Queer Theory may be described as the theoretical wing of the gay and lesbian liberation-slash-civil-rights struggle,

48
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,000
a struggle which comprehends more than just the sphere of sexuality.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,400
Queer Theory argues that there is beauty, power, and truth, even magic,

50
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,900
where dominant culture and its authorized language posits only ugliness, impotence, and falsehood.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,600
Queer Theory's emphatic pluralizing of sexuality resists the normative dualistic economy that limits erotic activity and coerces identity into deadening confines.

52
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,000
Though fairly new, Queer Theory is quite broad.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,900
It isn't just interpreting queer texts.

54
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,200
A lot of it is also interpreting and contextualizing queer coding, made by the straights.

55
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:42,800
I talked at much greater length about the difference between allegory and coding in our video about Bright and why Bright is a bad movie.

56
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,300
But in short, coding uses stereotyping and shorthand in order to get across a certain thing.

57
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,500
If you, for instance, want, like, effete villainy, queer coding's your boy.

58
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,700
Hmm, hello.

59
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,600
Ooh, lovely.

60
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,800
Coding appropriates stereotyping and shorthand in order to get a point across.

61
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:08,400
And queer coding has been a popular mainstream shorthand in film because the degenerates are bad and you don't want to like them.

62
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,300
A common example of queer coding often comes in the form of villainy.

63
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,800
Peter Lorre's villainous Joel Cairo in The Maltese Falcon has become a sort of ur-example of this.

64
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,100
He is effeminate, he's delicate, he's conniving.

65
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,100
He's a little too into you.

66
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,100
You stupid fathead, you!

67
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,300
Similarly, we have the original Invisible Man, starring Claude Rains,

68
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,900
who spurns his fiancÃ©e, becomes invisible, tries to find a male partner in crime...

69
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,900
I must have a partner, Kemp.

70
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,100
...and then becomes visible only after he is killed by the police.

71
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,900
Queer coding in villains is not just limited to the 40s.

72
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,900
In fact, this sort of coding would only get more explicit over time.

73
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,800
Examples contemporary to the original Transformers cartoon,

74
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,100
in which the villain was either an explicit or implied homosexual,

75
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,500
include Dressed to Kill, Commando, and Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior.

76
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,600
Again, you have made me unleash my dogs of war.

77
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,100
And then, of course, there are the Disney villains.

78
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,000
Uncle Scar.

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,200
Oh, I shall practice my curse.

80
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,500
Governor Ratcliffe.

81
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,900
You see how I treat her.

82
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,500
Professor Rattigan and Basil, Bitter Exes.

83
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,500
Though frankly, I expected you 15 minutes earlier.

84
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,700
Trouble with the chemistry set, old boy.

85
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,800
And, of course, Ursula, the Sea Witch.

86
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,000
And don't underestimate the importance of body language.

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,300
Whose design was actually based on Drag Queen Divine.

88
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,500
I'd like to set fire to this dump.

89
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,700
Now, while queer-coded villains can definitely have negative real-world repercussions,

90
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,100
that doesn't mean that it's always negative.

91
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,800
Queer communities have often embraced queer-coded villains as a sort of reclamation of power.

92
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,200
Like, yeah, these are my people.

93
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,900
It's also handy for questioning traditional power structures,

94
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,100
which your typical Hollywood hero represents.

95
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,900
There is a reason why those queers do so love their Disney villains.

96
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,300
You see how I treat her.

97
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,600
Oh, I shall practice my curtsy.

98
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,300
Body language.

99
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,500
But queer-coding is not limited to villains.

100
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Superhero movies, which the Transformers movies are, kind of, arguably,

101
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,700
also have elements of queer-coding.

102
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,000
Often the acquisition of superpowers, most notably with Spider-Man,

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,400
occurs during adolescence.

104
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,300
And what you do with said powers can read as an analog for coming to terms with personal identity.

105
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,200
Superhero movies have been known to have a certain aesthetic.

106
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,900
Thor Ragnarok is an amazing recent example.

107
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,800
What? Grandmaster uses it for his good times, orgies and stuff.

108
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,400
Did you just say that Grandmaster used it for orgies?

109
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,700
Yeah. Don't touch anything.

110
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,800
And was recently named by Vulture the gayest Marvel movie.

111
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,900
It's my birthday!

112
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,900
It's my birthday!

113
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,900
It's my birthday!

114
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,600
Superhero movies are often coming-out narratives.

115
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,500
The X-Men films, particularly X2, are very on-the-nose with this.

116
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,600
Have you tried not being a mutant?

117
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,700
A class of people, focusing on teenagers, who get their powers during adolescence,

118
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,000
are shunned by society, and their narrative is about figuring out their place in the world.

119
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,700
Now, to call the Transformers superhero films, which they kind of are, kind of,

120
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,700
or at least I think Hasbro wanted them to be before Michael Bay just pumped them with so much hate,

121
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,700
but on paper, a lot of what makes superhero films queer-coded has to do with

122
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,500
the narrative arc, the villain, and where we come into it in the narrative.

123
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,400
And in theory, the Transformers are, well, they're well past adolescence.

124
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,400
There's definite queer-coding in this idea that we have to hide our identity,

125
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,400
but the movies do not bother with this at all.

126
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,100
So as it is, since the movies for the most part kind of ignore the whole robots-in-disguise thing,

127
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,400
to me, the whole Transformers concept would read more as an immigrant narrative

128
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,400
than a queer coming-out narrative, which the movies kind of lean into.

129
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,100
Kind of.

130
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,400
I'm kicking the Autobots out.

131
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,900
Can you believe this is happening?

132
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,100
Kind of. Oh God, it's so bad.

133
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,800
I don't know what truck you're talking about.

134
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
Kind of cost American lives.

135
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,300
But that doesn't mean that there's nothing here to work with.

136
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,100
According to film historian Lisa Peirce in her book Contemporary Action Cinema,

137
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,500
action cinema is traditionally masculinist,

138
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,600
heavily invested in reinforcing dominant constructions of masculinity as active,

139
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,000
physically strong, rational, and powerful,

140
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,300
values which, as we have seen, are predominantly embodied in the figure of the white heterosexual male.

141
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,500
There are no openly gay action heroes.

142
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
Two exceptions might be asserted.

143
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,400
The detective thriller Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and historical epic Alexander.

144
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,800
But despite the dominant narrative of most action movies,

145
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,500
there is not to say that there is no queer coding or undertones in action movies.

146
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,900
A lot of Michael Bay movies lend themselves to queer readings

147
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,100
as male-male relationships tend to be the focus in his films.

148
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,000
Again, see the example of Bad Boys and Bad Boys 2.

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,200
According to Peirce, with regard to this scene,

150
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,900
the two heterosexual male heroes are momentarily misrecognized as gay

151
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,000
and unwittingly perform homosexuality to the watching store customers.

152
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,800
The scene's comic free zone derives not simply from the fact

153
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,500
that it is a variation on the long-standing comic trope of a straight man playing gay,

154
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,000
but also the film's assumption of the impossibility of an openly gay action hero.

155
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Why don't you just give it a little kiss, man? You know, so it'll feel better.

156
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,700
Hey, just pretend like we're not even here.

157
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,600
Isn't Ricky Martin having a concert?

158
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,500
In effect, when Michael Bay does recognize queer identities,

159
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,700
it is to use them as a comic prop,

160
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,200
to reassert the absurdity of a queer action hero.

161
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,800
Losers always whine about their best.

162
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Winners go home and fuck the prom queen.

163
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,500
And, of course, there is Pain and Gain,

164
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:38,300
a film which is deeply interested in threats to traditional masculinity.

165
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,800
Oh, Pain and Gain.

166
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
I'm hot!

167
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm big!

168
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,100
Pain and Gain.

169
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,300
You want to be a monument to physical perfection?

170
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,500
You want to be a shrine?

171
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,800
You should be.

172
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,800
But here is the problem with queer readings in the Transformers movies.

173
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,100
The juvenile no-homo humor is... there.

174
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,600
I've had a hell of a day!

175
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,100
Why don't you get a haircut with your bitch ass?

176
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,300
Go whine to your boyfriend.

177
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,700
Why would alien robots say that?

178
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,800
Oh, look who came sashaying back.

179
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,200
But despite there being lots of potential for queer readings in this franchise,

180
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,100
again, robots in disguise, fam.

181
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,400
Bay has scrubbed away that potential.

182
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,200
Most movies and television shows popular with queer readings

183
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,700
tend to have characters that, you know, like each other.

184
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,500
Or at least grow to like each other.

185
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,500
In action movies, the homoerotic subtext, especially in buddy action movies,

186
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,300
is often acknowledged and refuted.

187
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,400
Michael Bay loves doing this.

188
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,700
From now on, you can't say the word flaccid to me.

189
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,600
He's a mean fuck.

190
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,600
But the Transformers movies are characterized by people not liking each other.

191
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,000
Is there a car?

192
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,100
Huh?

193
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,500
Like, sure, on paper they do, but in practice...

194
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,500
I adore you.

195
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,700
That's not the word that I want to hear.

196
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,000
You'd get your ass kicked in Ireland for saying that.

197
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,200
Oh, we're not in Ireland. Lucky Charms, we're in Texas.

198
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,500
So he drives? What do you mean he drives? Like for a living?

199
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah.

200
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,200
Yes, he makes a living.

201
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,600
There are no buddies to be buddy cops.

202
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,800
Everyone makes constant reference to their loathing for everyone else.

203
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,200
Even the robots.

204
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,800
Especially the robots.

205
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,400
What you get for taking a yellow bugger,

206
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,000
you need a leader out there.

207
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,900
Shut up!

208
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,400
Cut the crap before I drop a grenade down your throat.

209
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,500
Oh, look, we can't sashay him back.

210
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,100
Hair growing like a chia pet, look.

211
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,200
Even the male-female relationships are characterized by distrust, insecurity, and possessiveness.

212
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,200
The male-male interactions are that, minus the pretense of trying to, quote,

213
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,300
make things work, end quote.

214
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:40,300
Mark Wahlberg competing with all of the boys to be the most masculine in the room got two whole movies.

215
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,100
I've been happy to give you a tour. I'll show you three other bars I got buried up back then.

216
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,600
I'll crack your head open like an egg!

217
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,700
That is how no-homo he is.

218
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:51,100
The Transformers themselves should naturally take on these roles of buddy cop,

219
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,900
and do in most other Transformers media,

220
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:59,100
but Bay doesn't seem to know how to frame these human-robot relationships other than object-owner.

221
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:05,300
Sam is allowed to love Bumblebee in the way that one loves one's property,

222
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,400
because Sam treats Bumblebee like his dog or his object.

223
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,100
Just break down. Just go in the garage quietly.

224
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,800
I'm sorry.

225
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,600
There is no need for the requisite Bay-ian no-homo, because Bumblebee is effectively an animal,

226
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,100
and Sam's relationship with Optimus is utterly sterile,

227
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,300
because Optimus functions basically as a military general.

228
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,000
Aside from one attempt at sincerity in Transformers 1...

229
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,900
You risked your life to protect the cube.

230
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,400
No sacrifice. No victory.

231
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,100
Bay got bored of that pretty quick.

232
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,500
The closest we get to an actual camaraderie of partners

233
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,100
is the Cogman-Anthony Hopkins relationship in Transformers 5.

234
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,600
And speaking of queer-coding...

235
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,900
Ah, there it is.

236
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:58,800
It took us five movies to finally get a bitchy C-3PO ripoff, but here we are.

237
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,300
Leprechauns are tiny, green, and Irish, and that is offensive.

238
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,900
He's British. He's a manservant.

239
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,200
He appears to be Anthony Hopkins's live-in partner.

240
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,000
It was making the moment more epic.

241
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,100
Just be quiet. What's the matter with you?

242
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,500
If I could find his neck, I'd strangle him.

243
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,300
You know, if you don't stop it, I will send you back to Cybertron in a little tiny box.

244
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,400
Oh, scary.

245
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,500
And he even makes a lovely sushi dinner for you loathsome straights.

246
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,900
No canoodling.

247
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,900
So there it is. Cogman. The queerest thing in the Transformers movies.

248
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,600
And just as hate-filled as everything else.

249
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,100
And no doubt a solid 70% of you have already written a novel-length screed

250
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,900
in the comments that I am not going to read about what did you expect?

251
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:44,400
Why would you ever think you're going to get some queer readings in Transformers media?

252
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,900
Ah, yes, and that is the sound of the 30% of you who have read the IDW comics.

253
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,600
And yes, you know exactly where we're going with this.

254
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,000
The recent trend in the IDW comics is not only to suggest that gender is a thing,

255
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,100
but not offer an explanation for it.

256
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,600
Which, honestly, thank God.

257
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Because feeling compelled to explain the existence of why females might exist is tiresome.

258
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,300
But also that, sure, why wouldn't the Transformers pair-bond?

259
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:13,000
And why would heteronormativity even be a thing for a race of asexual robots?

260
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,900
So in the comics, there is pair-bonding.

261
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,600
There are different forms of pair-bonding.

262
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,100
There are male robots, female robots, non-binary robots.

263
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,000
Even robots that were made one gender and then later decided,

264
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,900
wait, I'm actually a different gender.

265
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,500
They still fight and turn into cars and have relationships and get married.

266
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Well, they don't call it getting married, but gender doesn't really come into play.

267
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,000
Because why would it?

268
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,100
The Transformers universe is kind of like Star Wars, one with infinite possibilities.

269
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,300
So why not play with what gender and relationships would look like to alien robots?

270
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,700
Honestly, given the franchise's potential, the Michael Bay oeuvre,

271
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,900
and the way he loves stereotyping,

272
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,800
it's surprising that there isn't more deliberate queer coding here to work with.

273
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,900
So what does this say about any emotional investment that Michael Bay has in these characters?

274
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,500
Michael Bay's better films are also much more openly no-homo.

275
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,700
Because his better films tend to be framed around a sort of relationship,

276
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,800
usually a male-male relationship.

277
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,900
But Bay also knows to speak to the insecurities that men have around these sort of relationships,

278
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,000
which is in itself extremely telling.

279
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,100
In movies where people are allowed to like each other, by which I mean the male leads,

280
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,700
we have to take the time to acknowledge the inherent comedy of homoeroticism.

281
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,300
But in the Transformers movies, a franchise in which everyone hates each other

282
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,700
and are just kind of screaming at each other constantly,

283
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,900
there is no need to acknowledge, mock, or refute any inferred homoeroticism.

284
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,100
Because Bay doesn't even bother making the pretense that these characters can grow to like each other.

285
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:42,500
On an unrelated note, I'm going to spend the rest of this year trying not to get my hopes up about Bumblebee,

286
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,000
a movie which Michael Bay has almost nothing to do with.

287
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,900
Happy Pride!

288
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,900
You
