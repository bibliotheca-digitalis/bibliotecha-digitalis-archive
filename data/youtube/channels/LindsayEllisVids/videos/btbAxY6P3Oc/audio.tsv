0	5800	There is a scene in Michael Bay's 2003 film, Bad Boys 2, in which Marcus, played by Martin Lawrence,
5800	9600	has had enough of the tension between he and his partner Mike, played by Will Smith,
9600	13000	who had earlier accidentally shot him in the backside during a shootout.
13000	17900	Unbeknownst to the pair, their conversation is being filmed on a camera that has been left on a stand in the room,
17900	20500	and is being broadcast live to an adjacent store.
20500	23300	Oh, I did your ass.
23300	28100	When you pop me from behind, I think you damaged some nerves.
28100	30600	My ass still hurts.
30600	33400	From what you did to it the other night?
33400	35000	Oh, my lord.
35000	39200	To the store customers, who don't have the benefit of context the narrative has provided to us,
39200	44600	Mike and Marcus' conversation sounds like a frank conversation between two gay lovers about their sex life.
44600	48200	That poor man is pouring out his heart.
48200	49800	I'm still flaccid.
49800	51600	Um, okay.
51600	55800	I mean, we got caught up in the moment, shit got crazy.
55800	61100	You know how I get. From now on, you can't say the word flaccid to me.
61100	63900	He's a mean fuck.
63900	66000	Welcome back to The Whole Plate.
66000	67300	This is Queer Theory.
67300	74600	I hate the whole plate.
74600	79200	Yeah, that's right. We're back and piggybacking off of last season.
79200	80400	That's what we're gonna call it.
80400	83900	Slipping it under the wire for Pride Month, it's time to talk about Queer Theory.
83900	89100	And if you're wondering, really, you're going to try to use Transformers to explain Queer Theory?
89100	94600	Well, yeah, I mean, A, that's kind of the point, but B, you can queer anything.
94600	97100	I am directly below.
97100	98200	Enemy scrotum.
98200	100300	Anything.
100300	103300	Bumblebee, stop lubricating the mat.
103300	108200	So Queer Theory is a relative newcomer to other frameworks like, for instance, feminist film theory,
108200	113000	which itself is also kind of a newcomer, itself only about 50 years old in film studies.
113000	117900	Queer Theory really only began to get mainstream academic attention some 20-odd years after that,
117900	120300	in no small part thanks to the AIDS crisis.
120300	125100	And like all of these theoretical frameworks, does not necessarily have the same nomenclature everywhere.
125100	128000	There are plenty of people who do not like the term Queer Theory
128000	132600	because it is, in effect, an academic term that appropriates a reclaimed slur.
132600	136900	But Queer Theory is the most broad and common term in academia, so that's the one I'm using.
136900	138600	So what is the point of Queer Theory?
138600	146200	Well, like feminist theory, the ultimate point is sort of to de-center the assumed default perspective of culture makers.
146200	152000	In this case, straight people, specifically straight, cis, white men, as the sole arbiters of culture.
152000	158300	It uses this framework to study queer identity, depictions of queer identity, and also to reframe a queer perspective.
158300	163200	So yeah, there's actually a lot more to it than just, you know, analyzing Brokeback Mountain over and over again.
163200	168300	This type of framework is necessary because historically, queer populations and perspectives have been marginalized,
168300	174000	and just as often, pathologized, and still are in many places in the world.
175200	176700	Happy Pride!
176700	184700	According to author Frederick Green, politically, Queer Theory may be described as the theoretical wing of the gay and lesbian liberation-slash-civil-rights struggle,
184700	188000	a struggle which comprehends more than just the sphere of sexuality.
188000	191400	Queer Theory argues that there is beauty, power, and truth, even magic,
191400	195900	where dominant culture and its authorized language posits only ugliness, impotence, and falsehood.
196000	204600	Queer Theory's emphatic pluralizing of sexuality resists the normative dualistic economy that limits erotic activity and coerces identity into deadening confines.
204600	207000	Though fairly new, Queer Theory is quite broad.
207000	208900	It isn't just interpreting queer texts.
208900	214200	A lot of it is also interpreting and contextualizing queer coding, made by the straights.
215600	222800	I talked at much greater length about the difference between allegory and coding in our video about Bright and why Bright is a bad movie.
222800	228300	But in short, coding uses stereotyping and shorthand in order to get across a certain thing.
228300	233500	If you, for instance, want, like, effete villainy, queer coding's your boy.
233500	234700	Hmm, hello.
236100	237600	Ooh, lovely.
237600	241800	Coding appropriates stereotyping and shorthand in order to get a point across.
241800	248400	And queer coding has been a popular mainstream shorthand in film because the degenerates are bad and you don't want to like them.
248400	252300	A common example of queer coding often comes in the form of villainy.
252300	257800	Peter Lorre's villainous Joel Cairo in The Maltese Falcon has become a sort of ur-example of this.
257800	261100	He is effeminate, he's delicate, he's conniving.
261100	263100	He's a little too into you.
263100	265100	You stupid fathead, you!
267800	271300	Similarly, we have the original Invisible Man, starring Claude Rains,
271300	275900	who spurns his fianc√©e, becomes invisible, tries to find a male partner in crime...
275900	277900	I must have a partner, Kemp.
277900	281100	...and then becomes visible only after he is killed by the police.
281100	283900	Queer coding in villains is not just limited to the 40s.
283900	286900	In fact, this sort of coding would only get more explicit over time.
286900	289800	Examples contemporary to the original Transformers cartoon,
289800	293100	in which the villain was either an explicit or implied homosexual,
293100	298500	include Dressed to Kill, Commando, and Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior.
298500	301600	Again, you have made me unleash my dogs of war.
301600	304100	And then, of course, there are the Disney villains.
305900	307000	Uncle Scar.
307000	309200	Oh, I shall practice my curse.
309200	310500	Governor Ratcliffe.
310500	311900	You see how I treat her.
311900	314500	Professor Rattigan and Basil, Bitter Exes.
315300	319500	Though frankly, I expected you 15 minutes earlier.
320500	323700	Trouble with the chemistry set, old boy.
323700	326800	And, of course, Ursula, the Sea Witch.
326800	333000	And don't underestimate the importance of body language.
333000	336300	Whose design was actually based on Drag Queen Divine.
336300	338500	I'd like to set fire to this dump.
338500	342700	Now, while queer-coded villains can definitely have negative real-world repercussions,
342700	345100	that doesn't mean that it's always negative.
345100	349800	Queer communities have often embraced queer-coded villains as a sort of reclamation of power.
349800	351200	Like, yeah, these are my people.
351200	353900	It's also handy for questioning traditional power structures,
353900	356100	which your typical Hollywood hero represents.
356100	358900	There is a reason why those queers do so love their Disney villains.
358900	360300	You see how I treat her.
360300	362600	Oh, I shall practice my curtsy.
362600	365300	Body language.
365300	367500	But queer-coding is not limited to villains.
367500	372500	Superhero movies, which the Transformers movies are, kind of, arguably,
372500	374700	also have elements of queer-coding.
374700	378000	Often the acquisition of superpowers, most notably with Spider-Man,
378000	379400	occurs during adolescence.
379400	384300	And what you do with said powers can read as an analog for coming to terms with personal identity.
384300	388200	Superhero movies have been known to have a certain aesthetic.
388200	390900	Thor Ragnarok is an amazing recent example.
390900	394800	What? Grandmaster uses it for his good times, orgies and stuff.
394900	397400	Did you just say that Grandmaster used it for orgies?
397400	399700	Yeah. Don't touch anything.
399700	402800	And was recently named by Vulture the gayest Marvel movie.
403500	404900	It's my birthday!
404900	406900	It's my birthday!
406900	408900	It's my birthday!
408900	411600	Superhero movies are often coming-out narratives.
411600	416500	The X-Men films, particularly X2, are very on-the-nose with this.
416500	420600	Have you tried not being a mutant?
420700	424700	A class of people, focusing on teenagers, who get their powers during adolescence,
424700	429000	are shunned by society, and their narrative is about figuring out their place in the world.
429000	433700	Now, to call the Transformers superhero films, which they kind of are, kind of,
433700	437700	or at least I think Hasbro wanted them to be before Michael Bay just pumped them with so much hate,
437700	442700	but on paper, a lot of what makes superhero films queer-coded has to do with
442700	447500	the narrative arc, the villain, and where we come into it in the narrative.
447600	451400	And in theory, the Transformers are, well, they're well past adolescence.
451400	454400	There's definite queer-coding in this idea that we have to hide our identity,
454400	458400	but the movies do not bother with this at all.
458400	463100	So as it is, since the movies for the most part kind of ignore the whole robots-in-disguise thing,
463100	466400	to me, the whole Transformers concept would read more as an immigrant narrative
466400	470400	than a queer coming-out narrative, which the movies kind of lean into.
470400	471100	Kind of.
471100	473400	I'm kicking the Autobots out.
473400	474900	Can you believe this is happening?
474900	477100	Kind of. Oh God, it's so bad.
477100	478800	I don't know what truck you're talking about.
478800	480800	Kind of cost American lives.
480800	485300	But that doesn't mean that there's nothing here to work with.
485300	489100	According to film historian Lisa Peirce in her book Contemporary Action Cinema,
489100	491500	action cinema is traditionally masculinist,
491500	495600	heavily invested in reinforcing dominant constructions of masculinity as active,
495600	498000	physically strong, rational, and powerful,
498000	503300	values which, as we have seen, are predominantly embodied in the figure of the white heterosexual male.
503300	505500	There are no openly gay action heroes.
505500	507500	Two exceptions might be asserted.
507500	511400	The detective thriller Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and historical epic Alexander.
511400	513800	But despite the dominant narrative of most action movies,
513800	517500	there is not to say that there is no queer coding or undertones in action movies.
517500	519900	A lot of Michael Bay movies lend themselves to queer readings
519900	523100	as male-male relationships tend to be the focus in his films.
523100	526000	Again, see the example of Bad Boys and Bad Boys 2.
526000	528200	According to Peirce, with regard to this scene,
528200	531900	the two heterosexual male heroes are momentarily misrecognized as gay
531900	536000	and unwittingly perform homosexuality to the watching store customers.
536000	538800	The scene's comic free zone derives not simply from the fact
538800	543500	that it is a variation on the long-standing comic trope of a straight man playing gay,
543500	548000	but also the film's assumption of the impossibility of an openly gay action hero.
548000	551000	Why don't you just give it a little kiss, man? You know, so it'll feel better.
551000	552700	Hey, just pretend like we're not even here.
552700	554600	Isn't Ricky Martin having a concert?
554600	557500	In effect, when Michael Bay does recognize queer identities,
557500	559700	it is to use them as a comic prop,
559700	563200	to reassert the absurdity of a queer action hero.
563800	566800	Losers always whine about their best.
567800	570800	Winners go home and fuck the prom queen.
570800	572500	And, of course, there is Pain and Gain,
572500	578300	a film which is deeply interested in threats to traditional masculinity.
578300	579800	Oh, Pain and Gain.
579800	580800	I'm hot!
582300	583000	I'm big!
583000	585100	Pain and Gain.
585100	587300	You want to be a monument to physical perfection?
587300	588500	You want to be a shrine?
590000	590800	You should be.
590800	593800	But here is the problem with queer readings in the Transformers movies.
593800	597100	The juvenile no-homo humor is... there.
597100	598600	I've had a hell of a day!
599600	602100	Why don't you get a haircut with your bitch ass?
602100	603300	Go whine to your boyfriend.
603300	605700	Why would alien robots say that?
605700	607800	Oh, look who came sashaying back.
607800	611200	But despite there being lots of potential for queer readings in this franchise,
611200	614100	again, robots in disguise, fam.
614100	616400	Bay has scrubbed away that potential.
616400	619200	Most movies and television shows popular with queer readings
619200	622700	tend to have characters that, you know, like each other.
622700	624500	Or at least grow to like each other.
624500	628500	In action movies, the homoerotic subtext, especially in buddy action movies,
628500	630300	is often acknowledged and refuted.
630300	632400	Michael Bay loves doing this.
632400	636700	From now on, you can't say the word flaccid to me.
636700	638600	He's a mean fuck.
638600	642600	But the Transformers movies are characterized by people not liking each other.
642600	644000	Is there a car?
644000	645100	Huh?
645100	647500	Like, sure, on paper they do, but in practice...
647600	650500	I adore you.
650500	652700	That's not the word that I want to hear.
652700	655000	You'd get your ass kicked in Ireland for saying that.
655000	657200	Oh, we're not in Ireland. Lucky Charms, we're in Texas.
657200	659500	So he drives? What do you mean he drives? Like for a living?
659500	661000	Yeah.
661000	662200	Yes, he makes a living.
662200	664600	There are no buddies to be buddy cops.
664600	668800	Everyone makes constant reference to their loathing for everyone else.
668800	670200	Even the robots.
670200	671800	Especially the robots.
671800	674400	What you get for taking a yellow bugger,
674400	676000	you need a leader out there.
676900	677900	Shut up!
677900	680400	Cut the crap before I drop a grenade down your throat.
680400	682500	Oh, look, we can't sashay him back.
682500	684100	Hair growing like a chia pet, look.
684100	689200	Even the male-female relationships are characterized by distrust, insecurity, and possessiveness.
689200	693200	The male-male interactions are that, minus the pretense of trying to, quote,
693200	695300	make things work, end quote.
695300	700300	Mark Wahlberg competing with all of the boys to be the most masculine in the room got two whole movies.
700300	703100	I've been happy to give you a tour. I'll show you three other bars I got buried up back then.
703100	704600	I'll crack your head open like an egg!
704700	706700	That is how no-homo he is.
706700	711100	The Transformers themselves should naturally take on these roles of buddy cop,
711100	713900	and do in most other Transformers media,
713900	719100	but Bay doesn't seem to know how to frame these human-robot relationships other than object-owner.
719100	725300	Sam is allowed to love Bumblebee in the way that one loves one's property,
725300	728400	because Sam treats Bumblebee like his dog or his object.
728400	730100	Just break down. Just go in the garage quietly.
730100	731800	I'm sorry.
731800	736600	There is no need for the requisite Bay-ian no-homo, because Bumblebee is effectively an animal,
736600	739100	and Sam's relationship with Optimus is utterly sterile,
739100	742300	because Optimus functions basically as a military general.
742300	746000	Aside from one attempt at sincerity in Transformers 1...
746000	749900	You risked your life to protect the cube.
749900	753400	No sacrifice. No victory.
753400	755100	Bay got bored of that pretty quick.
755100	757500	The closest we get to an actual camaraderie of partners
757600	762100	is the Cogman-Anthony Hopkins relationship in Transformers 5.
762100	763600	And speaking of queer-coding...
771600	773900	Ah, there it is.
773900	778800	It took us five movies to finally get a bitchy C-3PO ripoff, but here we are.
778800	782300	Leprechauns are tiny, green, and Irish, and that is offensive.
782300	783900	He's British. He's a manservant.
783900	787200	He appears to be Anthony Hopkins's live-in partner.
787300	790000	It was making the moment more epic.
790000	793100	Just be quiet. What's the matter with you?
793100	795500	If I could find his neck, I'd strangle him.
795500	799300	You know, if you don't stop it, I will send you back to Cybertron in a little tiny box.
799300	800400	Oh, scary.
800400	804500	And he even makes a lovely sushi dinner for you loathsome straights.
804500	805900	No canoodling.
805900	809900	So there it is. Cogman. The queerest thing in the Transformers movies.
809900	812600	And just as hate-filled as everything else.
812600	816100	And no doubt a solid 70% of you have already written a novel-length screed
816100	819900	in the comments that I am not going to read about what did you expect?
819900	824400	Why would you ever think you're going to get some queer readings in Transformers media?
824400	828900	Ah, yes, and that is the sound of the 30% of you who have read the IDW comics.
828900	831600	And yes, you know exactly where we're going with this.
831600	836000	The recent trend in the IDW comics is not only to suggest that gender is a thing,
836000	838100	but not offer an explanation for it.
838100	839600	Which, honestly, thank God.
839600	844600	Because feeling compelled to explain the existence of why females might exist is tiresome.
844600	848300	But also that, sure, why wouldn't the Transformers pair-bond?
848300	853000	And why would heteronormativity even be a thing for a race of asexual robots?
853000	854900	So in the comics, there is pair-bonding.
854900	856600	There are different forms of pair-bonding.
856600	860100	There are male robots, female robots, non-binary robots.
860100	863000	Even robots that were made one gender and then later decided,
863000	864900	wait, I'm actually a different gender.
864900	868500	They still fight and turn into cars and have relationships and get married.
868500	871500	Well, they don't call it getting married, but gender doesn't really come into play.
871500	873000	Because why would it?
873000	877100	The Transformers universe is kind of like Star Wars, one with infinite possibilities.
877100	881300	So why not play with what gender and relationships would look like to alien robots?
881300	884700	Honestly, given the franchise's potential, the Michael Bay oeuvre,
884700	887900	and the way he loves stereotyping,
887900	891800	it's surprising that there isn't more deliberate queer coding here to work with.
891800	896900	So what does this say about any emotional investment that Michael Bay has in these characters?
898900	902500	Michael Bay's better films are also much more openly no-homo.
902500	905700	Because his better films tend to be framed around a sort of relationship,
905700	907800	usually a male-male relationship.
907800	911900	But Bay also knows to speak to the insecurities that men have around these sort of relationships,
911900	914000	which is in itself extremely telling.
914000	918100	In movies where people are allowed to like each other, by which I mean the male leads,
918100	921700	we have to take the time to acknowledge the inherent comedy of homoeroticism.
921700	925300	But in the Transformers movies, a franchise in which everyone hates each other
925300	927700	and are just kind of screaming at each other constantly,
927700	931900	there is no need to acknowledge, mock, or refute any inferred homoeroticism.
931900	936100	Because Bay doesn't even bother making the pretense that these characters can grow to like each other.
937100	942500	On an unrelated note, I'm going to spend the rest of this year trying not to get my hopes up about Bumblebee,
942500	947000	a movie which Michael Bay has almost nothing to do with.
948500	949900	Happy Pride!
961900	963900	You
