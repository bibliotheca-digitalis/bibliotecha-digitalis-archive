WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.080
So a couple months ago, I used YouTube's post feature to announce by way of a screen cap,

00:06.080 --> 00:09.360
because it had to be a screen cap because the announcement was behind a paywall,

00:09.360 --> 00:15.680
that I sold a novel to commercial fiction publisher St. Martin's Press,

00:17.200 --> 00:26.160
Axioms, and a Stranger Things meets Arrival story set in an alternate 2000s about a young woman who

00:26.160 --> 00:31.120
becomes the sole point of communication between humanity and a hostile alien civilization.

00:31.120 --> 00:35.920
Okay, and so for you smartasses who are bagging on this, I did not write this. I honestly don't

00:35.920 --> 00:40.560
know where they got Stranger Things. It doesn't take place in the 80s. It's not even like,

00:40.560 --> 00:48.640
you know, magical metaphysical stuff. Is it on brand? Yes. Is it too long? Probably.

00:48.640 --> 00:55.040
Can I pre-order it? Actually, you can. They got right on the ball. And I know what you're thinking,

00:55.040 --> 01:00.880
like, oh, another one of those, you know? Here I have been slaving away at the great American

01:00.880 --> 01:06.240
novel for decades, and another one of these YouTubers just has a book deal like foisted

01:06.240 --> 01:13.040
upon them. The influencers sit recumbent on the chaise lounge and receive the offers.

01:13.680 --> 01:20.320
When in reality, I have been working at this for 10 fucking years. Well, no, I don't mean literally

01:20.320 --> 01:24.640
the same book for 10 years. It did not take me 10 years to write this. Well, I mean, sort of. Anyway,

01:24.640 --> 01:29.040
we'll get to that. And the truth is, yes, it is a lot easier for some people with bigger platforms

01:29.040 --> 01:33.840
to get book deals than others, but that also depends on the type of book that they are writing.

01:33.840 --> 01:38.400
In the case of YouTubers and influencers, what publishers usually want is like, you know,

01:38.400 --> 01:44.880
my life as a girl boss the book, or hi, I'm an Instagram model the book. But I was like, no,

01:44.880 --> 01:51.920
I like suffering. I want to write novels. Better yet, of the science fiction variety.

01:51.920 --> 01:58.880
You know, science fiction, that, that biggest piece of the publishing pie. Everybody loves it,

01:58.880 --> 02:04.160
so in demand. It's not. So today I'm doing something a little different in discussing

02:04.160 --> 02:10.640
how does one actually go about publishing a novel. I'm going to demystify the process.

02:10.640 --> 02:14.880
Because I know a lot of people that subscribe to this channel are either creatives or aspiring

02:14.880 --> 02:21.360
creatives themselves. You need to know what holy hell you're getting into and decide, can I handle

02:21.360 --> 02:26.560
that many rejection letters? So how it works. If it's your first time, fiction and nonfiction

02:26.560 --> 02:30.560
are handled generally quite differently. Nonfiction is generally sold on proposal,

02:30.560 --> 02:34.320
meaning there will be between one and three chapters of the book written, and also you'll

02:34.320 --> 02:38.720
have like a bio and then like some stuff about your platform and an outline of the book and,

02:38.720 --> 02:43.280
you know, a section saying why I am the expert that should be writing this book. And with fiction,

02:43.280 --> 02:49.200
again for debut authors that aren't famous, it needs to be done. The book needs to be 100%

02:49.200 --> 02:54.480
written. Debut novels are very, very rarely sold on proposal. Outliers to the point of

02:54.480 --> 02:58.880
should not be counted. Yes, I know it happens, but it doesn't happen very often. I mean a debut novel

02:58.880 --> 03:05.040
might be sold on proposal if it's by like a celebrity or, you know, it's like a YA adventure

03:05.040 --> 03:10.400
about like beating the system written by a YouTuber with more than 10 million subs, but,

03:10.400 --> 03:15.280
you know, if that's the case, they're probably hiring a ghostwriter anyway. I am obsessed with

03:15.280 --> 03:20.320
this shirt I got by the by Pantages the other day. The Cats trailer has sent me spiraling into

03:20.320 --> 03:25.520
a severe Andrew Lloyd Webber relapse this fall. Anyway, yes, there are famous people exceptions,

03:25.520 --> 03:30.000
but in general, debut novels are not sold on proposal. It needs to be done, and by done,

03:30.000 --> 03:34.160
I mean it needs to be edited, it needs to be polished, it needs to have gone through several

03:34.160 --> 03:40.240
drafts, and by the time you think you are ready to go, you are wrong. Put that thing back in the

03:40.240 --> 03:44.640
drawer, take it around the block a few more times, it still needs work. Trust me. You have to be able

03:44.640 --> 03:49.440
to look at this thing and go, yes, I could see this going to print tomorrow. This is the level

03:49.440 --> 03:55.200
that we're at. The thing about writing, especially something as like sprawling as a novel, is that

03:55.200 --> 04:00.800
writers are actually not very good at judging the merits of their own work. Shock, I know.

04:00.800 --> 04:05.680
When the truth is, nine times out of ten, authors think they are ready to go before they are ready

04:05.680 --> 04:11.360
to go. I know I was. We'll get to that. But now that you have written the thing, it is time for

04:11.360 --> 04:18.320
step two. Get a literary agent. Arguably the hardest step, because this is the part in which

04:18.320 --> 04:23.200
the odds are least in your favor. So you've submitted your query, you are now in the slush

04:23.200 --> 04:29.040
pile, which is a very uncharitable name for unsolicited material, because most of it is

04:29.040 --> 04:34.000
detritus. Yes, there was a time when authors submitted directly to publishers and they did

04:34.000 --> 04:39.520
not need a literary agent. We call those times the 1970s. Yes, there are some exceptions, but for

04:39.520 --> 04:45.360
your purposes, if you want to get published with a major publisher, and most small presses, and a

04:45.920 --> 04:50.160
huge chunk of indie presses too, you need a literary agent. They won't even look at you if

04:50.160 --> 04:55.120
you don't have one. And while we are here, no, you do not pay your literary agent before you sell

04:55.120 --> 04:59.840
your book. They take a cut after they sell your book. If there is an agent saying that you need

04:59.840 --> 05:04.320
to pay them up front, they're not an agent, they're lying. It's a scam. Run away. So what does a

05:04.320 --> 05:10.640
literary agent do? Are they anything other than a glorified filter that exists to separate the

05:10.640 --> 05:16.160
rabble from the publisher so the publisher doesn't have to waste their precious time and resources

05:16.160 --> 05:23.840
anymore? Well... See, here's the thing. You are a special flower, an artiste floating along on the

05:23.840 --> 05:31.360
winds of inspiration. You don't understand contracts. The publishing industry is labyrinthine

05:31.360 --> 05:36.960
and complicated, and it has a culture that you do not understand. I know I don't. On top of that,

05:36.960 --> 05:42.400
contracts have gotten a lot more complicated since the 1970s. Mine, for instance, was pretty

05:42.400 --> 05:49.120
boilerplate, and it still took two months between selling the book and signing the thing. That was

05:49.120 --> 05:54.320
a pretty quick turnaround. On top of that, agents also negotiate royalty rates and advances for you,

05:54.320 --> 05:59.280
and also advise on what you should ask for in your contract, because they know what is standard

05:59.280 --> 06:04.080
and what is reasonable to ask for, and you don't. But there is a creative element, too. A lot of

06:04.080 --> 06:09.360
literary agents will actually do a pass, do some edits with you before you actually go on submission

06:09.360 --> 06:14.320
to publishers. They also act as sort of a go-between between you and the publisher, you know,

06:14.320 --> 06:20.400
so they can, like, soak up the emotions if you have too many, because it turns out you're not

06:20.400 --> 06:24.480
supposed to yell at your publisher. They ask you how you are and you just have to say that you're

06:24.480 --> 06:28.000
fine when you're not really fine, but you just can't get into it because they wouldn't have run.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.560
So why are the odds not in your favor at this stage? Well, it's because of volume. It's hard

06:32.560 --> 06:38.560
to find exact stats on this, how many submissions any given literary agent gets per day. My agent

06:38.560 --> 06:43.680
gets between 15 and 20 per day. So depending on the size of the agency, a literary agent is going

06:43.680 --> 06:49.680
to get anywhere from several hundred to several thousand queries per year, and depending on how

06:49.680 --> 06:56.400
much they are trying to build their list, they may only take on half a dozen or less. So I'm not

06:56.400 --> 07:00.880
saying you have less than one in a thousand odds for your basic midlist literary agent.

07:03.120 --> 07:07.120
Actually, I am saying that. That brings us to step 2.5, the query letter.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
Okay, so if you're a novelist, you're probably not very good at being concise,

07:14.000 --> 07:20.960
but the query letter is basically a two paragraph less than 250 word pitch. It's basically the copy

07:20.960 --> 07:24.640
you would read on the back of the book. It is designed to make the person reading it be like,

07:24.640 --> 07:30.960
oh yeah, I want to throw down my 2795 MSRP for that. It's not a summary. You should not

07:30.960 --> 07:37.680
summarize. It is a pitch, and it's actually really hard to do well. A bard, a mage, and a rogue meet

07:37.680 --> 07:44.320
in a tavern, and then they hear of a quest. There's a business centaur that owns a company,

07:44.880 --> 07:50.000
and he's just, he's living his life until one day a plucky young virgin

07:50.000 --> 07:57.680
becomes his secretary or something. And then, oh, the past. Yeah, see, I'm really good at that.

07:57.680 --> 08:04.160
So each literary agency operates differently, but in general the steps will be query letter leads to

08:04.800 --> 08:08.320
partial request, which means part of your manuscript, like first five chapters or

08:08.320 --> 08:13.040
something. If they like that, then they'll ask for the whole manuscript, and if they like that,

08:13.040 --> 08:18.880
then they will offer you representation. Generally, this process will be protracted

08:18.880 --> 08:23.840
over several months, unless you're just that amazing. Sometimes it can be really fast,

08:23.840 --> 08:29.680
but usually it's not. Wow, you have an agent now. Good for her. Hopefully your agent will help you

08:29.680 --> 08:34.400
out on the creative front too, because presumably they took on your project not just because they

08:34.400 --> 08:38.160
thought they could sell it, but you know, because they like it. And the level to which they will

08:38.160 --> 08:44.000
help you before you go on submission to publishers varies a lot. Like, it could be just like an email

08:44.000 --> 08:48.640
with like, hey, maybe you should like brush this up, or like, you know, you use the word

08:48.640 --> 08:52.880
basically too much. Or they could do like an entire line edit through your manuscripts.

08:52.880 --> 08:59.200
Depends on the agent. Next top book deal? Well, not so fast. First we got to talk about who we

08:59.200 --> 09:04.480
are submitting to. Generally, an agent will want to start with big five publishers, because they

09:04.480 --> 09:08.880
are the ones with the money, and they are the ones with the best marketing and the widest distribution.

09:08.880 --> 09:13.200
So what do I mean when I say big five? Well, basically they're the biggest five, but also

09:13.200 --> 09:19.280
they are umbrella corporations effectively for many, many, many publishers. The big five are

09:19.280 --> 09:27.680
Penguin Random House, Simon & Schuster, Hachette, Macmillan, which is mine, and HarperCollins.

09:27.680 --> 09:31.600
The way it works is at the top we have the publishing house, then you have the publisher,

09:32.160 --> 09:35.440
then you have the imprint. And the imprint is where the editor works. They are the one

09:35.440 --> 09:40.800
that specialize in whatever it is you are trying to sell. For instance, my imprint is

09:40.800 --> 09:49.040
Saint Martin's Press, which is an imprint of Saint Martin's Press, which is owned by Macmillan.

09:49.040 --> 09:54.240
Imprints specialize in different things, so for instance you'll have Tor Forge, which specializes

09:54.240 --> 10:00.000
in sci-fi and fantasy. Love Swept will be HarperCollins. Is it HarperCollins? No, it's

10:00.000 --> 10:04.720
Random House. Well anyway, it's a romance imprint. Saint Martin's Press specializes in commercial

10:04.720 --> 10:11.920
fiction, which obviously can mean genre fiction, but you know, a certain type. Let's just say I was

10:11.920 --> 10:18.880
rejected for more than one genre imprint for not being sci-fi enough. It's a rival meets changer

10:18.880 --> 10:23.200
thing. So big five publishers are desirable not just because they are able to pay advances,

10:23.200 --> 10:28.080
sometimes very big ones, but also because they have much wider distribution. Generally you'll go

10:28.080 --> 10:33.200
on a round of submission. You'll see how that goes. Maybe it'll sell on the first round, but if it

10:33.200 --> 10:37.600
doesn't, you probably want to do some revisions before you go on round two, and then when you go

10:37.600 --> 10:41.920
on round two and it doesn't sell then, then maybe you want to start seriously considering smaller

10:41.920 --> 10:47.840
presses or indie presses or self-publishing or trunking it, and we'll get to that. Okay, so let's

10:47.840 --> 10:52.880
say you are on submission. If there is more than one offer, then it goes to auction, and auctions

10:52.880 --> 10:57.120
are great. They make you feel really popular, but most of the time for debut authors, especially if

10:57.120 --> 11:02.000
they don't have a big platform, this process will be protracted over a period of several months.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.080
So while on the one hand there are an ever-increasing number of options to get your

11:06.080 --> 11:11.920
book out there, traditional publishing is actually more competitive than it has ever ever been.

11:13.200 --> 11:18.880
Yeah, especially for fiction. And that leads us to my monstrosity. Ten years, huh?

11:23.680 --> 11:26.000
That seems, like, sad.

11:26.240 --> 11:32.560
There is this expectation when you work in a new media that people think that you're gonna be like,

11:32.560 --> 11:37.200
you know what? I'm bucking the system. Screw you, gatekeepers. I gotta do me.

11:38.960 --> 11:44.160
But no, no, that is not what I wanted to do. So this is a story about traditional publishing

11:44.160 --> 11:52.400
and rejection and all sorts of fun things, and why I never talked about it. Till now.

11:52.400 --> 11:58.240
So let's get this out of the way first. There's this sort of wrong-ish idea I see floating around

11:58.240 --> 12:04.320
that if you have a platform of, you know, decently sized, that you're pretty much guaranteed a book

12:04.320 --> 12:09.840
deal. And, uh, you know, wow. You know, that's not true. And I will find that people that even

12:09.840 --> 12:14.480
work in the industry are surprised that, like, my platform didn't get me something much sooner.

12:14.480 --> 12:18.560
Which inevitably leads to these dipshits on Reddit surmising that, like, well if you can't

12:18.640 --> 12:24.960
get a book deal despite those YouTube subs, well, woof. Which just kind of reveals that these people

12:24.960 --> 12:29.520
don't know how anything works, and that's fine. That's why I'm here. Fundamentally,

12:29.520 --> 12:35.760
quality is secondary to where the market is and what they think they can sell. Especially for

12:35.760 --> 12:41.040
fiction, a thing no one should write. Okay, so what did I mean by that? When I said this whole

12:41.040 --> 12:47.760
big nonsense thing took 10 years, what I mean is it was about 10 years between my conscious decision

12:47.760 --> 12:53.200
of, yes, I am going to pursue this thing. By this thing, I mean traditional publishing with a Big

12:53.200 --> 13:00.560
Five publisher, and it actually happening. Was the novel I sold the first novel I wrote? No.

13:01.440 --> 13:05.440
I'd argue that it wasn't even the second, but it was also kind of the first. I said it was the

13:05.440 --> 13:10.240
first and, well, anyway. So I joke a lot about fanfic, but the truth is fanfic is actually

13:10.240 --> 13:14.240
really good practice and a good way to decide if that is something that you want to pursue.

13:14.240 --> 13:17.920
And I joke about it a lot, especially with the Phantom stuff, but the truth is I was not

13:17.920 --> 13:24.240
terribly prolific until I was in college because I had this narrative about myself that, you know,

13:24.960 --> 13:30.480
I just don't finish things. I'm just, I just, I don't have the attention span. Too bad for me.

13:30.480 --> 13:35.600
I guess I'm just gonna work in data collection for the rest of my life because I'm 22 and I don't

13:35.600 --> 13:39.680
know anything. But then, thanks to the wonderful world of fanfiction, I actually did start

13:39.680 --> 13:45.760
finishing some stuff. You know, it wasn't good, but I finished it. So, again, this was around

13:45.760 --> 13:51.360
the time that the, you know, economy crashed and I went to grad school. So going into film

13:51.360 --> 13:56.240
and television, of course, that's where we're going to start making serious attempts. Because,

13:56.240 --> 14:02.160
after all, there was no way in hell I was going to go into a creative writing MFA on the strength

14:02.160 --> 14:09.360
of a few overlong fanfics. No. Going into debt at one of the most expensive film schools in the world

14:09.360 --> 14:16.480
during the worst recession in living memory is a much better idea. So, yeah, we're at film school.

14:16.480 --> 14:23.280
It's 2009. Part of the curriculum is let's come up with some story ideas. There's a class called

14:23.280 --> 14:32.160
ideation. We have fun. So the first non-fanfic thing I wrote was this sad sack attempt at a

14:32.720 --> 14:38.880
Christian romance novel because I knew someone who worked at the harlequin imprint for Christian

14:38.880 --> 14:44.640
romance called Love Inspired and this imprint was one of the only imprints that was taking

14:44.640 --> 14:51.680
unagented authors and I, in my infinite hubris, was like, anyone can do that! At least I got some

14:51.680 --> 14:57.040
practice in. I did also write a full-length screenplay while I was at USC for a class. No,

14:57.040 --> 15:01.680
it will never see the light of day because it was quite bad. But then I got an idea in 2012

15:02.480 --> 15:06.080
that was rooted in some items that were in the news at the time.

15:07.680 --> 15:13.360
How about that but with aliens? But no, I did not start writing it then. That did not happen until

15:13.360 --> 15:20.480
2013 and I wrote the first draft in two months. It was one twilight long because I measure everything

15:20.480 --> 15:27.040
in units of twilight. This is a twilight. This book actually has really big print. It's not that long.

15:27.040 --> 15:32.480
That first draft was described by one person that I no longer speak to at the time as

15:34.240 --> 15:39.200
publishable, which is probably a little bit of a red flag when the people in your life don't

15:39.200 --> 15:43.760
really have the heart to tell you that your word baby is a bit of a yike. But I, in my infinite

15:43.760 --> 15:49.600
arrogance, was like, we're off to the races. I very wrongly assumed that my platform, which

15:49.600 --> 15:55.600
was much smaller than it is now, would make me a catch. So even if the book wasn't all that great

15:55.600 --> 16:01.760
and sure as hell was not ready, it didn't matter. They'd help me fix it. I've got 20,000 Twitter

16:01.760 --> 16:08.480
followers. I think I might have done like one very minor revision before I sent it to, um,

16:08.480 --> 16:13.680
actually like not very many agents. I only think I only sent it to a few and one of whom I knew

16:13.680 --> 16:19.840
personally. 5,000 words to very nicely say yikes. Which was good because it finally brought me down

16:19.840 --> 16:25.200
to reality and realized that like, oh, I actually maybe should take this a little more seriously. So

16:25.200 --> 16:30.640
I spent a few months on revisions and now armed with, you know, a little bit of perspective,

16:30.640 --> 16:36.560
uh, we tried round two. This time I actually queried pretty widely. I got interest from about

16:36.560 --> 16:42.640
30% of the agents I queried and then actually it happened rather quickly. I got an offer of

16:42.640 --> 16:50.000
representation after about two, three months and then I had an agent. We did it. I hopped the

16:50.000 --> 16:58.240
hardest turtle, right? So what now? Well, we revise it again substantially before we go on

16:58.240 --> 17:04.000
submission. Submission round one, mostly big five and a couple of smaller publishers like Quirk

17:04.000 --> 17:12.640
Books. Generally a round of submission will be between maybe 10 and 15 editors and, uh, wow,

17:12.640 --> 17:17.600
that was a lot of rejection. Like I got rejected so hard I don't think I got like a detailed

17:17.600 --> 17:23.520
rejection letter from anyone. And that whole rigmarole from start to final no thank was about

17:23.520 --> 17:30.640
four months. So, uh, yeah. So what now? Well, we revise again. Let's try to figure out what was

17:30.640 --> 17:36.080
wrong. Another round of submissions. This time it was, I think, a few more, maybe 15. And this time,

17:37.440 --> 17:45.520
well, I got one or two rejections that were quite detailed. See? Progress. One or two felt it wasn't

17:45.520 --> 17:51.120
commercial enough. The guy at HarperCollins thought I was whip smart. But most people just

17:51.120 --> 17:55.520
didn't connect with the voice, which is, of course, industry to speak for. I think you're

17:55.520 --> 18:01.200
a shitty writer. And here we are at the end of 2014. Two years of work and nothing to show for

18:01.200 --> 18:07.840
it. What now? You can go downstream to smaller presses which, you know, might give you less money

18:07.840 --> 18:14.400
up front but will still distribute as widely as any of the larger ones. Or you can go indie

18:14.400 --> 18:19.920
or you can self-publish. I mean, that kind of makes sense. If you have a platform already,

18:19.920 --> 18:24.640
self-publishing does mean you get to keep a much bigger cut of the money that comes in for you.

18:24.640 --> 18:32.960
But there is a third option. We got us a trunk novel. The trunk novel. Everyone has one. They

18:32.960 --> 18:38.400
don't. So, yeah, I could have self-published. Even now I get a lot of people asking me why I didn't

18:38.400 --> 18:42.880
because, like, you know, hey, there's no shame in it. And also you'd make a lot more money with your

18:42.880 --> 18:48.320
platform. And, well, okay. First of all, I don't know about that. I'm gonna, I'm gonna have to

18:48.320 --> 18:54.720
disagree with you there, Bard. And secondly, I did not want to self-publish. Like, I'd self-publish

18:54.720 --> 18:59.920
right here. Like, this is what I'm doing. That's what YouTube is. All I do is self-publish. But

18:59.920 --> 19:03.920
ultimately the reason that I trunked it was because I felt that the reason it wasn't selling

19:03.920 --> 19:09.760
wasn't because the market was necessarily hostile to that sort of thing, which it totally was, but

19:09.760 --> 19:15.840
because it wasn't ready. And, by extension, I was not ready. I had not put in the work. I had not

19:15.840 --> 19:20.160
done the hours. And there are many people who would call this flawed thinking. After all, publishing

19:20.160 --> 19:26.000
is very fickle and they always play it safe. And most of the time, whenever you get a no from an

19:26.000 --> 19:29.680
agent or publisher, it isn't because they don't like it. It's because they don't think they can

19:29.680 --> 19:34.320
sell it. They don't think it will move copies. Yeah, after my book comes out, we will, we can talk about

19:34.320 --> 19:41.280
the why. It was a hard sell, but the TLDR is it doesn't really fit with any kind of publishing

19:41.280 --> 19:45.920
trends right now. That's it. That was actually simple. But at the end of the day, in my heart

19:45.920 --> 19:51.040
of hearts, I knew trunk novel had major problems. Like, you know, there were definitely some

19:51.040 --> 19:56.400
contrivances. Some of it was really half-assed. It read like a debut novel, which it was. So I put the

19:56.400 --> 20:04.640
book away. The book has been trunked. Time to move on. Round two, 2015-2016. We have moved on completely.

20:04.640 --> 20:10.240
I get an idea for a new novel, wholly unrelated to the first one, same genre, doesn't have aliens in

20:10.240 --> 20:15.600
it. I very naively thought that this one would be more commercial, despite the fact that it was still

20:15.600 --> 20:21.040
genre fiction, a thing that no one should ever write. I very naively gave it the working title

20:21.040 --> 20:26.560
commercial as fuck, because I thought it would be. So I broke up with the first literary agent,

20:26.560 --> 20:32.720
No Hard Feelings, because surely I will have no problem getting a literary agent that is more,

20:32.720 --> 20:42.400
I don't know, suited to what I'm going for. I'm me. Huh. Looks like the lighting and setup has slightly

20:42.400 --> 20:47.680
changed. It's not totally because I filmed this on a different day. I still have two copies of

20:47.680 --> 20:53.600
John Scalzi's The Consuming Fire, though. This one says happy birthday. So I start writing commercial

20:53.600 --> 21:00.880
as fuck over late 2016, early 2017, and then I start querying commercial as fuck around mid-2017,

21:00.880 --> 21:09.680
and this one gets even less interesting the last time. Fucking really? This is supposed to be

21:09.680 --> 21:14.720
commercial as fuck. So yeah, I got a bunch of partial requests and a bunch of full requests, but

21:14.720 --> 21:20.160
ultimately no offers, asterisk. And a lot of the times it would get rejected for reasons that would

21:20.160 --> 21:25.200
be like totally fixable, like, you know, location or something, and it would be like, oh well, I could

21:25.200 --> 21:31.840
revise that. Okay. And while we are here, the truth is these days, if your book needs a lot of revision

21:31.840 --> 21:36.560
or even not that much revision, agents probably aren't going to be interested in walking you

21:36.560 --> 21:41.200
through it, although it does depend on the agent. Your mileage may vary. But I did find one agent

21:41.200 --> 21:45.120
that was willing to work with it and was really interested in fixing it, you know, like the

21:45.120 --> 21:52.240
characters, like the premise, but the ending is a little too bleak. And I'm like, look, it's 2017.

21:52.240 --> 21:56.160
My heroes are dead and my enemies are in power. What do you want? But point taken. So she is willing

21:56.160 --> 22:01.120
to talk representation if I am able to revise the thing in a way that she thinks can sell, but the

22:01.120 --> 22:06.000
problem is I don't really know how I want to revise it. This is just where I'm at. So despite

22:06.000 --> 22:10.720
the extensive feedback that this agent gives me, I sit on this thing for many months, not quite

22:10.720 --> 22:16.320
knowing how to fix it. But it is at this point in early 2018, a full three years after our trunk

22:16.320 --> 22:21.840
novel has been trunked, that I go ahead and dig that one out, maybe thinking that will inspire me,

22:21.840 --> 22:26.160
and it is at this point that I remember what interested me so much in that story in the first

22:26.160 --> 22:30.160
place. But it is also at this point that the problems that had been plaguing the thing basically

22:30.160 --> 22:36.800
since its inception become wildly obvious to me. Why is it so expository in the first five chapters?

22:36.800 --> 22:42.160
Why is the entire third act like that? Why did I not do a motivation better? And so trunk novel is

22:42.160 --> 22:47.360
where my inspiration goes, not commercial as fuck, so I start working on that instead. And what was

22:47.360 --> 22:52.080
supposed to be a fairly modest rewrite, with the intention of I guess, you know, getting the

22:52.080 --> 22:57.520
creative juices flowing for the other one, ends up being like a complete overhaul. And by the end of

22:57.520 --> 23:02.640
this rewrite, I have deleted about 60,000 words and written another 70,000. And so by the time

23:02.640 --> 23:06.640
I'm done with this, and this would have been about a month after the Hobbit videos came out,

23:06.640 --> 23:12.880
I was like, hey look, a thing. I guess I have two projects again, sort of. And as far as I can see,

23:12.880 --> 23:18.800
trunk novel is the more polished of the two, so why don't we just tepidly see if there's any

23:18.800 --> 23:25.280
interest there? So once again, I very tepidly send out like, I don't know, maybe 10 query letters and

23:26.800 --> 23:27.840
noes across the board.

23:27.840 --> 23:36.800
Okay, fine, this is clearly not meant to be. Fine. And the flavors of the no are pretty much

23:36.800 --> 23:42.000
all variations on, I don't think I can sell that. But here's the thing, that revision actually

23:42.000 --> 23:47.040
did do the thing it was intended to do, and it helped me figure out how I wanted to fix the bleak

23:47.040 --> 23:51.680
ending of commercial as fuck. So you know what, working on trunk novel wasn't a total wash,

23:51.680 --> 23:56.160
so I'm working on that, and then I get an email from this agent telling me that she is leaving

23:56.160 --> 24:07.600
the agenting industry. Jesus Christ. All right, fine. Fine. I give up. I give up. The end. Oh,

24:07.600 --> 24:14.000
wait, no, this is about like triumph or something. Never give up, except for I totally gave up.

24:14.000 --> 24:19.760
And this is where my hashtag privilege comes in. So it was almost around this exact time that this

24:19.760 --> 24:26.640
rando in Brooklyn emails me like, hey, I'm a literary agent. Do you have one? And this was

24:26.640 --> 24:32.080
not the only thing that was going on in my life. Like, if you watch the talk I did for XOXO 2019,

24:32.080 --> 24:37.760
which is on their YouTube channel, this was around that time. So, you know, my heroes are dead, my

24:37.760 --> 24:42.400
enemies are in power. Not a great time. So he asked me if I have anything that I'd be willing

24:42.400 --> 24:46.400
to share, and I'm like, okay, which one do you want? Do you want commercial as fuck or do you

24:46.400 --> 24:52.640
want trunk novel? And he says whichever one is more done. So trunk novel it is. So basically,

24:52.640 --> 24:58.080
in very short order, he does pinpoint the issue with why agents thought that they could not sell

24:58.080 --> 25:03.840
this. And one of these days I might talk about the issue. And no, it wasn't about like problematic

25:03.840 --> 25:09.360
content or gender or anything, but it was very small and ultimately very fixable. It was kind

25:09.360 --> 25:16.800
of on the level of like, hey, this takes place in Santa Monica. What if it took place in San Diego

25:16.800 --> 25:21.680
instead? We'll talk about it one day. So this dude, his name is Christopher Hermelin, and he

25:21.680 --> 25:26.640
is part of a boutique agency in Brooklyn. He signs me up, we do a round or two of revisions,

25:26.640 --> 25:32.320
and then we go on submission the first week of January. That was on a Monday. I get my first

25:32.320 --> 25:37.360
phone call from an editor on a Friday, and then after talking to a few more, ultimately it's sold

25:37.360 --> 25:46.480
in less than two weeks. Yep. Okay, so ultimately we come again full circle with that question of

25:46.480 --> 25:51.040
why is my thing not selling? What is wrong with my manuscript? Is it my manuscript that's the

25:51.040 --> 25:55.280
problem or the market? And in my case, it's a little difficult to answer since I ultimately did

25:55.840 --> 26:00.400
sell to a commercial imprint, and the book itself doesn't really fall in line with any publishing

26:00.400 --> 26:05.520
trends right now. So it does kind of remain to be seen just how much, if at all, Saint Martin's

26:05.520 --> 26:10.560
gamble will pay off. Because that is kind of the reason that agents are so bearish, and they want

26:10.560 --> 26:14.960
things that are comparable to things that have already sold well. This, for the record, was mine.

26:15.520 --> 26:22.880
Thank you. Thanks for debuting at number one. Readers are creatures of habit. They want things

26:22.880 --> 26:28.000
that are like the thing that they've already read. So if I'm to come to a publisher with this book

26:28.000 --> 26:34.480
and they're like, okay, what is it about? And I'm like, I don't know, it's Independence Day meets

26:34.480 --> 26:40.560
the big short. Mary Doria Russell's Invader Zim. I guess it's kind of fair for them to be like,

26:40.560 --> 26:45.200
I don't really care if it's any good or not, I don't know if I can sell that. The point here being

26:45.200 --> 26:51.600
is that it is honestly really difficult to tell where the line in the sand is. Your work is not

26:51.600 --> 26:58.960
good enough, and the publisher slash agent doesn't think there is a market for it. So in conclusion,

26:58.960 --> 27:03.920
something, something, follow your dreams. I think it would have been just as easy for me to be like,

27:03.920 --> 27:09.680
yeah, I wrote a thing and it's out now, and then not, you know, cop to the 10 years of,

27:10.400 --> 27:14.640
I guess failure is a strong word, struggle. And then people will be like, wow, I guess you just

27:14.640 --> 27:21.120
magically did it on the first try when in reality, no. Because it doesn't do anyone any favors to act

27:21.120 --> 27:27.920
like, even in a position like mine where I have a relatively large online platform, I didn't have to

27:27.920 --> 27:32.880
put in the work and go through a lot of rejection. But here is what I have learned from the thing.

27:32.880 --> 27:37.120
Learning to write, learning to be a novelist, and the publishing industry in general is

27:37.120 --> 27:43.520
incredibly, incredibly slow going. So you have to be incredibly patient. And looking back,

27:43.520 --> 27:48.320
the best choice I made in the whole thing was choosing to trunk that novel in 2014.

27:48.320 --> 27:53.440
So the fact that I was able to get in another five years of writing experience actually helped

27:53.440 --> 27:58.960
the thing get to a level where it could sell to a major publisher and hopefully will be, you know,

27:59.520 --> 28:05.840
not hated by a plurality of you. So in some ways, I think fiction is more difficult to publish than

28:05.840 --> 28:12.080
nonfiction because it's harder to really gauge demand for. But that is not to say that nonfiction

28:12.080 --> 28:20.240
is easier. It's just different. But a lot of people's success really is owed to luck and timing.

28:20.240 --> 28:25.360
These people that you hear of that get these like debut novels with six-figure advances and, you

28:25.440 --> 28:31.920
know, they tend to be YA, um, they hit at the right point in the right genre, but they also

28:31.920 --> 28:38.640
tend to be outliers. For instance, if you were querying a YA dystopia in 2009, you're probably

28:38.640 --> 28:43.440
going to get different results from querying the same book in 2019. A few years ago, author

28:43.440 --> 28:48.480
Jim C. Heinz did a survey of traditionally published authors to see how long it actually

28:48.480 --> 28:55.120
took them to get published, and the average length of time was, drumroll, 11 years. So what

28:55.120 --> 29:00.480
does that mean for this channel? Is this going to turn into this shameless self-promotion channel?

29:00.480 --> 29:07.440
Well, no, not yet. I mean, six months it will. But I do imagine that this has shed some light on

29:08.480 --> 29:13.760
why this channel hasn't been as prolific as it has been in years past. And one more thing with

29:13.760 --> 29:18.720
regard to pre-orders, and this applies to pretty much all traditionally published authors, is if

29:18.720 --> 29:23.840
you want to support an author and you plan on buying the book anyway, pre-orders are a great way

29:23.840 --> 29:28.000
to do that because it helps the publisher decide where they are going to end up, you know,

29:28.640 --> 29:32.400
spending their resources. Who gets the marketing? Who gets to go on a book tour?

29:32.400 --> 29:37.360
Pre-orders are basically their barometer to, you know, who gives a shit. So if you want to pre-order

29:37.360 --> 29:43.120
American Three-Body Problem for Girls, the link is in the description. It is available in hardcover

29:43.120 --> 29:47.280
and Kindle right now. I guess the paperback will be like, I don't know, six months or a year after that.

29:47.280 --> 29:52.800
And yeah, this won't be the last video of this kind. I will probably be doing a lot more process

29:52.800 --> 29:57.760
slash publishing industry type stuff in the months and years to come. Although yes, don't worry,

29:57.760 --> 30:04.720
we will still be doing traditional video essay type stuff too. So yeah, so yeah, I know everybody

30:04.720 --> 30:09.840
can't wait for this YouTuber book. This should be, this should be an interesting journey that we can

30:09.840 --> 30:15.040
all go on together. Hope this was some help, and if it wasn't, well, hope at least it was

30:15.040 --> 30:22.000
entertaining to watch. This is gonna be a long year. Happy end of the decade, everybody!
