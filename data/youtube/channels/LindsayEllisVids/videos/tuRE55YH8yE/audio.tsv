0	6080	So a couple months ago, I used YouTube's post feature to announce by way of a screen cap,
6080	9360	because it had to be a screen cap because the announcement was behind a paywall,
9360	15680	that I sold a novel to commercial fiction publisher St. Martin's Press,
17200	26160	Axioms, and a Stranger Things meets Arrival story set in an alternate 2000s about a young woman who
26160	31120	becomes the sole point of communication between humanity and a hostile alien civilization.
31120	35920	Okay, and so for you smartasses who are bagging on this, I did not write this. I honestly don't
35920	40560	know where they got Stranger Things. It doesn't take place in the 80s. It's not even like,
40560	48640	you know, magical metaphysical stuff. Is it on brand? Yes. Is it too long? Probably.
48640	55040	Can I pre-order it? Actually, you can. They got right on the ball. And I know what you're thinking,
55040	60880	like, oh, another one of those, you know? Here I have been slaving away at the great American
60880	66240	novel for decades, and another one of these YouTubers just has a book deal like foisted
66240	73040	upon them. The influencers sit recumbent on the chaise lounge and receive the offers.
73680	80320	When in reality, I have been working at this for 10 fucking years. Well, no, I don't mean literally
80320	84640	the same book for 10 years. It did not take me 10 years to write this. Well, I mean, sort of. Anyway,
84640	89040	we'll get to that. And the truth is, yes, it is a lot easier for some people with bigger platforms
89040	93840	to get book deals than others, but that also depends on the type of book that they are writing.
93840	98400	In the case of YouTubers and influencers, what publishers usually want is like, you know,
98400	104880	my life as a girl boss the book, or hi, I'm an Instagram model the book. But I was like, no,
104880	111920	I like suffering. I want to write novels. Better yet, of the science fiction variety.
111920	118880	You know, science fiction, that, that biggest piece of the publishing pie. Everybody loves it,
118880	124160	so in demand. It's not. So today I'm doing something a little different in discussing
124160	130640	how does one actually go about publishing a novel. I'm going to demystify the process.
130640	134880	Because I know a lot of people that subscribe to this channel are either creatives or aspiring
134880	141360	creatives themselves. You need to know what holy hell you're getting into and decide, can I handle
141360	146560	that many rejection letters? So how it works. If it's your first time, fiction and nonfiction
146560	150560	are handled generally quite differently. Nonfiction is generally sold on proposal,
150560	154320	meaning there will be between one and three chapters of the book written, and also you'll
154320	158720	have like a bio and then like some stuff about your platform and an outline of the book and,
158720	163280	you know, a section saying why I am the expert that should be writing this book. And with fiction,
163280	169200	again for debut authors that aren't famous, it needs to be done. The book needs to be 100%
169200	174480	written. Debut novels are very, very rarely sold on proposal. Outliers to the point of
174480	178880	should not be counted. Yes, I know it happens, but it doesn't happen very often. I mean a debut novel
178880	185040	might be sold on proposal if it's by like a celebrity or, you know, it's like a YA adventure
185040	190400	about like beating the system written by a YouTuber with more than 10 million subs, but,
190400	195280	you know, if that's the case, they're probably hiring a ghostwriter anyway. I am obsessed with
195280	200320	this shirt I got by the by Pantages the other day. The Cats trailer has sent me spiraling into
200320	205520	a severe Andrew Lloyd Webber relapse this fall. Anyway, yes, there are famous people exceptions,
205520	210000	but in general, debut novels are not sold on proposal. It needs to be done, and by done,
210000	214160	I mean it needs to be edited, it needs to be polished, it needs to have gone through several
214160	220240	drafts, and by the time you think you are ready to go, you are wrong. Put that thing back in the
220240	224640	drawer, take it around the block a few more times, it still needs work. Trust me. You have to be able
224640	229440	to look at this thing and go, yes, I could see this going to print tomorrow. This is the level
229440	235200	that we're at. The thing about writing, especially something as like sprawling as a novel, is that
235200	240800	writers are actually not very good at judging the merits of their own work. Shock, I know.
240800	245680	When the truth is, nine times out of ten, authors think they are ready to go before they are ready
245680	251360	to go. I know I was. We'll get to that. But now that you have written the thing, it is time for
251360	258320	step two. Get a literary agent. Arguably the hardest step, because this is the part in which
258320	263200	the odds are least in your favor. So you've submitted your query, you are now in the slush
263200	269040	pile, which is a very uncharitable name for unsolicited material, because most of it is
269040	274000	detritus. Yes, there was a time when authors submitted directly to publishers and they did
274000	279520	not need a literary agent. We call those times the 1970s. Yes, there are some exceptions, but for
279520	285360	your purposes, if you want to get published with a major publisher, and most small presses, and a
285920	290160	huge chunk of indie presses too, you need a literary agent. They won't even look at you if
290160	295120	you don't have one. And while we are here, no, you do not pay your literary agent before you sell
295120	299840	your book. They take a cut after they sell your book. If there is an agent saying that you need
299840	304320	to pay them up front, they're not an agent, they're lying. It's a scam. Run away. So what does a
304320	310640	literary agent do? Are they anything other than a glorified filter that exists to separate the
310640	316160	rabble from the publisher so the publisher doesn't have to waste their precious time and resources
316160	323840	anymore? Well... See, here's the thing. You are a special flower, an artiste floating along on the
323840	331360	winds of inspiration. You don't understand contracts. The publishing industry is labyrinthine
331360	336960	and complicated, and it has a culture that you do not understand. I know I don't. On top of that,
336960	342400	contracts have gotten a lot more complicated since the 1970s. Mine, for instance, was pretty
342400	349120	boilerplate, and it still took two months between selling the book and signing the thing. That was
349120	354320	a pretty quick turnaround. On top of that, agents also negotiate royalty rates and advances for you,
354320	359280	and also advise on what you should ask for in your contract, because they know what is standard
359280	364080	and what is reasonable to ask for, and you don't. But there is a creative element, too. A lot of
364080	369360	literary agents will actually do a pass, do some edits with you before you actually go on submission
369360	374320	to publishers. They also act as sort of a go-between between you and the publisher, you know,
374320	380400	so they can, like, soak up the emotions if you have too many, because it turns out you're not
380400	384480	supposed to yell at your publisher. They ask you how you are and you just have to say that you're
384480	388000	fine when you're not really fine, but you just can't get into it because they wouldn't have run.
388000	392560	So why are the odds not in your favor at this stage? Well, it's because of volume. It's hard
392560	398560	to find exact stats on this, how many submissions any given literary agent gets per day. My agent
398560	403680	gets between 15 and 20 per day. So depending on the size of the agency, a literary agent is going
403680	409680	to get anywhere from several hundred to several thousand queries per year, and depending on how
409680	416400	much they are trying to build their list, they may only take on half a dozen or less. So I'm not
416400	420880	saying you have less than one in a thousand odds for your basic midlist literary agent.
423120	427120	Actually, I am saying that. That brings us to step 2.5, the query letter.
430000	434000	Okay, so if you're a novelist, you're probably not very good at being concise,
434000	440960	but the query letter is basically a two paragraph less than 250 word pitch. It's basically the copy
440960	444640	you would read on the back of the book. It is designed to make the person reading it be like,
444640	450960	oh yeah, I want to throw down my 2795 MSRP for that. It's not a summary. You should not
450960	457680	summarize. It is a pitch, and it's actually really hard to do well. A bard, a mage, and a rogue meet
457680	464320	in a tavern, and then they hear of a quest. There's a business centaur that owns a company,
464880	470000	and he's just, he's living his life until one day a plucky young virgin
470000	477680	becomes his secretary or something. And then, oh, the past. Yeah, see, I'm really good at that.
477680	484160	So each literary agency operates differently, but in general the steps will be query letter leads to
484800	488320	partial request, which means part of your manuscript, like first five chapters or
488320	493040	something. If they like that, then they'll ask for the whole manuscript, and if they like that,
493040	498880	then they will offer you representation. Generally, this process will be protracted
498880	503840	over several months, unless you're just that amazing. Sometimes it can be really fast,
503840	509680	but usually it's not. Wow, you have an agent now. Good for her. Hopefully your agent will help you
509680	514400	out on the creative front too, because presumably they took on your project not just because they
514400	518160	thought they could sell it, but you know, because they like it. And the level to which they will
518160	524000	help you before you go on submission to publishers varies a lot. Like, it could be just like an email
524000	528640	with like, hey, maybe you should like brush this up, or like, you know, you use the word
528640	532880	basically too much. Or they could do like an entire line edit through your manuscripts.
532880	539200	Depends on the agent. Next top book deal? Well, not so fast. First we got to talk about who we
539200	544480	are submitting to. Generally, an agent will want to start with big five publishers, because they
544480	548880	are the ones with the money, and they are the ones with the best marketing and the widest distribution.
548880	553200	So what do I mean when I say big five? Well, basically they're the biggest five, but also
553200	559280	they are umbrella corporations effectively for many, many, many publishers. The big five are
559280	567680	Penguin Random House, Simon & Schuster, Hachette, Macmillan, which is mine, and HarperCollins.
567680	571600	The way it works is at the top we have the publishing house, then you have the publisher,
572160	575440	then you have the imprint. And the imprint is where the editor works. They are the one
575440	580800	that specialize in whatever it is you are trying to sell. For instance, my imprint is
580800	589040	Saint Martin's Press, which is an imprint of Saint Martin's Press, which is owned by Macmillan.
589040	594240	Imprints specialize in different things, so for instance you'll have Tor Forge, which specializes
594240	600000	in sci-fi and fantasy. Love Swept will be HarperCollins. Is it HarperCollins? No, it's
600000	604720	Random House. Well anyway, it's a romance imprint. Saint Martin's Press specializes in commercial
604720	611920	fiction, which obviously can mean genre fiction, but you know, a certain type. Let's just say I was
611920	618880	rejected for more than one genre imprint for not being sci-fi enough. It's a rival meets changer
618880	623200	thing. So big five publishers are desirable not just because they are able to pay advances,
623200	628080	sometimes very big ones, but also because they have much wider distribution. Generally you'll go
628080	633200	on a round of submission. You'll see how that goes. Maybe it'll sell on the first round, but if it
633200	637600	doesn't, you probably want to do some revisions before you go on round two, and then when you go
637600	641920	on round two and it doesn't sell then, then maybe you want to start seriously considering smaller
641920	647840	presses or indie presses or self-publishing or trunking it, and we'll get to that. Okay, so let's
647840	652880	say you are on submission. If there is more than one offer, then it goes to auction, and auctions
652880	657120	are great. They make you feel really popular, but most of the time for debut authors, especially if
657120	662000	they don't have a big platform, this process will be protracted over a period of several months.
662000	666080	So while on the one hand there are an ever-increasing number of options to get your
666080	671920	book out there, traditional publishing is actually more competitive than it has ever ever been.
673200	678880	Yeah, especially for fiction. And that leads us to my monstrosity. Ten years, huh?
683680	686000	That seems, like, sad.
686240	692560	There is this expectation when you work in a new media that people think that you're gonna be like,
692560	697200	you know what? I'm bucking the system. Screw you, gatekeepers. I gotta do me.
698960	704160	But no, no, that is not what I wanted to do. So this is a story about traditional publishing
704160	712400	and rejection and all sorts of fun things, and why I never talked about it. Till now.
712400	718240	So let's get this out of the way first. There's this sort of wrong-ish idea I see floating around
718240	724320	that if you have a platform of, you know, decently sized, that you're pretty much guaranteed a book
724320	729840	deal. And, uh, you know, wow. You know, that's not true. And I will find that people that even
729840	734480	work in the industry are surprised that, like, my platform didn't get me something much sooner.
734480	738560	Which inevitably leads to these dipshits on Reddit surmising that, like, well if you can't
738640	744960	get a book deal despite those YouTube subs, well, woof. Which just kind of reveals that these people
744960	749520	don't know how anything works, and that's fine. That's why I'm here. Fundamentally,
749520	755760	quality is secondary to where the market is and what they think they can sell. Especially for
755760	761040	fiction, a thing no one should write. Okay, so what did I mean by that? When I said this whole
761040	767760	big nonsense thing took 10 years, what I mean is it was about 10 years between my conscious decision
767760	773200	of, yes, I am going to pursue this thing. By this thing, I mean traditional publishing with a Big
773200	780560	Five publisher, and it actually happening. Was the novel I sold the first novel I wrote? No.
781440	785440	I'd argue that it wasn't even the second, but it was also kind of the first. I said it was the
785440	790240	first and, well, anyway. So I joke a lot about fanfic, but the truth is fanfic is actually
790240	794240	really good practice and a good way to decide if that is something that you want to pursue.
794240	797920	And I joke about it a lot, especially with the Phantom stuff, but the truth is I was not
797920	804240	terribly prolific until I was in college because I had this narrative about myself that, you know,
804960	810480	I just don't finish things. I'm just, I just, I don't have the attention span. Too bad for me.
810480	815600	I guess I'm just gonna work in data collection for the rest of my life because I'm 22 and I don't
815600	819680	know anything. But then, thanks to the wonderful world of fanfiction, I actually did start
819680	825760	finishing some stuff. You know, it wasn't good, but I finished it. So, again, this was around
825760	831360	the time that the, you know, economy crashed and I went to grad school. So going into film
831360	836240	and television, of course, that's where we're going to start making serious attempts. Because,
836240	842160	after all, there was no way in hell I was going to go into a creative writing MFA on the strength
842160	849360	of a few overlong fanfics. No. Going into debt at one of the most expensive film schools in the world
849360	856480	during the worst recession in living memory is a much better idea. So, yeah, we're at film school.
856480	863280	It's 2009. Part of the curriculum is let's come up with some story ideas. There's a class called
863280	872160	ideation. We have fun. So the first non-fanfic thing I wrote was this sad sack attempt at a
872720	878880	Christian romance novel because I knew someone who worked at the harlequin imprint for Christian
878880	884640	romance called Love Inspired and this imprint was one of the only imprints that was taking
884640	891680	unagented authors and I, in my infinite hubris, was like, anyone can do that! At least I got some
891680	897040	practice in. I did also write a full-length screenplay while I was at USC for a class. No,
897040	901680	it will never see the light of day because it was quite bad. But then I got an idea in 2012
902480	906080	that was rooted in some items that were in the news at the time.
907680	913360	How about that but with aliens? But no, I did not start writing it then. That did not happen until
913360	920480	2013 and I wrote the first draft in two months. It was one twilight long because I measure everything
920480	927040	in units of twilight. This is a twilight. This book actually has really big print. It's not that long.
927040	932480	That first draft was described by one person that I no longer speak to at the time as
934240	939200	publishable, which is probably a little bit of a red flag when the people in your life don't
939200	943760	really have the heart to tell you that your word baby is a bit of a yike. But I, in my infinite
943760	949600	arrogance, was like, we're off to the races. I very wrongly assumed that my platform, which
949600	955600	was much smaller than it is now, would make me a catch. So even if the book wasn't all that great
955600	961760	and sure as hell was not ready, it didn't matter. They'd help me fix it. I've got 20,000 Twitter
961760	968480	followers. I think I might have done like one very minor revision before I sent it to, um,
968480	973680	actually like not very many agents. I only think I only sent it to a few and one of whom I knew
973680	979840	personally. 5,000 words to very nicely say yikes. Which was good because it finally brought me down
979840	985200	to reality and realized that like, oh, I actually maybe should take this a little more seriously. So
985200	990640	I spent a few months on revisions and now armed with, you know, a little bit of perspective,
990640	996560	uh, we tried round two. This time I actually queried pretty widely. I got interest from about
996560	1002640	30% of the agents I queried and then actually it happened rather quickly. I got an offer of
1002640	1010000	representation after about two, three months and then I had an agent. We did it. I hopped the
1010000	1018240	hardest turtle, right? So what now? Well, we revise it again substantially before we go on
1018240	1024000	submission. Submission round one, mostly big five and a couple of smaller publishers like Quirk
1024000	1032640	Books. Generally a round of submission will be between maybe 10 and 15 editors and, uh, wow,
1032640	1037600	that was a lot of rejection. Like I got rejected so hard I don't think I got like a detailed
1037600	1043520	rejection letter from anyone. And that whole rigmarole from start to final no thank was about
1043520	1050640	four months. So, uh, yeah. So what now? Well, we revise again. Let's try to figure out what was
1050640	1056080	wrong. Another round of submissions. This time it was, I think, a few more, maybe 15. And this time,
1057440	1065520	well, I got one or two rejections that were quite detailed. See? Progress. One or two felt it wasn't
1065520	1071120	commercial enough. The guy at HarperCollins thought I was whip smart. But most people just
1071120	1075520	didn't connect with the voice, which is, of course, industry to speak for. I think you're
1075520	1081200	a shitty writer. And here we are at the end of 2014. Two years of work and nothing to show for
1081200	1087840	it. What now? You can go downstream to smaller presses which, you know, might give you less money
1087840	1094400	up front but will still distribute as widely as any of the larger ones. Or you can go indie
1094400	1099920	or you can self-publish. I mean, that kind of makes sense. If you have a platform already,
1099920	1104640	self-publishing does mean you get to keep a much bigger cut of the money that comes in for you.
1104640	1112960	But there is a third option. We got us a trunk novel. The trunk novel. Everyone has one. They
1112960	1118400	don't. So, yeah, I could have self-published. Even now I get a lot of people asking me why I didn't
1118400	1122880	because, like, you know, hey, there's no shame in it. And also you'd make a lot more money with your
1122880	1128320	platform. And, well, okay. First of all, I don't know about that. I'm gonna, I'm gonna have to
1128320	1134720	disagree with you there, Bard. And secondly, I did not want to self-publish. Like, I'd self-publish
1134720	1139920	right here. Like, this is what I'm doing. That's what YouTube is. All I do is self-publish. But
1139920	1143920	ultimately the reason that I trunked it was because I felt that the reason it wasn't selling
1143920	1149760	wasn't because the market was necessarily hostile to that sort of thing, which it totally was, but
1149760	1155840	because it wasn't ready. And, by extension, I was not ready. I had not put in the work. I had not
1155840	1160160	done the hours. And there are many people who would call this flawed thinking. After all, publishing
1160160	1166000	is very fickle and they always play it safe. And most of the time, whenever you get a no from an
1166000	1169680	agent or publisher, it isn't because they don't like it. It's because they don't think they can
1169680	1174320	sell it. They don't think it will move copies. Yeah, after my book comes out, we will, we can talk about
1174320	1181280	the why. It was a hard sell, but the TLDR is it doesn't really fit with any kind of publishing
1181280	1185920	trends right now. That's it. That was actually simple. But at the end of the day, in my heart
1185920	1191040	of hearts, I knew trunk novel had major problems. Like, you know, there were definitely some
1191040	1196400	contrivances. Some of it was really half-assed. It read like a debut novel, which it was. So I put the
1196400	1204640	book away. The book has been trunked. Time to move on. Round two, 2015-2016. We have moved on completely.
1204640	1210240	I get an idea for a new novel, wholly unrelated to the first one, same genre, doesn't have aliens in
1210240	1215600	it. I very naively thought that this one would be more commercial, despite the fact that it was still
1215600	1221040	genre fiction, a thing that no one should ever write. I very naively gave it the working title
1221040	1226560	commercial as fuck, because I thought it would be. So I broke up with the first literary agent,
1226560	1232720	No Hard Feelings, because surely I will have no problem getting a literary agent that is more,
1232720	1242400	I don't know, suited to what I'm going for. I'm me. Huh. Looks like the lighting and setup has slightly
1242400	1247680	changed. It's not totally because I filmed this on a different day. I still have two copies of
1247680	1253600	John Scalzi's The Consuming Fire, though. This one says happy birthday. So I start writing commercial
1253600	1260880	as fuck over late 2016, early 2017, and then I start querying commercial as fuck around mid-2017,
1260880	1269680	and this one gets even less interesting the last time. Fucking really? This is supposed to be
1269680	1274720	commercial as fuck. So yeah, I got a bunch of partial requests and a bunch of full requests, but
1274720	1280160	ultimately no offers, asterisk. And a lot of the times it would get rejected for reasons that would
1280160	1285200	be like totally fixable, like, you know, location or something, and it would be like, oh well, I could
1285200	1291840	revise that. Okay. And while we are here, the truth is these days, if your book needs a lot of revision
1291840	1296560	or even not that much revision, agents probably aren't going to be interested in walking you
1296560	1301200	through it, although it does depend on the agent. Your mileage may vary. But I did find one agent
1301200	1305120	that was willing to work with it and was really interested in fixing it, you know, like the
1305120	1312240	characters, like the premise, but the ending is a little too bleak. And I'm like, look, it's 2017.
1312240	1316160	My heroes are dead and my enemies are in power. What do you want? But point taken. So she is willing
1316160	1321120	to talk representation if I am able to revise the thing in a way that she thinks can sell, but the
1321120	1326000	problem is I don't really know how I want to revise it. This is just where I'm at. So despite
1326000	1330720	the extensive feedback that this agent gives me, I sit on this thing for many months, not quite
1330720	1336320	knowing how to fix it. But it is at this point in early 2018, a full three years after our trunk
1336320	1341840	novel has been trunked, that I go ahead and dig that one out, maybe thinking that will inspire me,
1341840	1346160	and it is at this point that I remember what interested me so much in that story in the first
1346160	1350160	place. But it is also at this point that the problems that had been plaguing the thing basically
1350160	1356800	since its inception become wildly obvious to me. Why is it so expository in the first five chapters?
1356800	1362160	Why is the entire third act like that? Why did I not do a motivation better? And so trunk novel is
1362160	1367360	where my inspiration goes, not commercial as fuck, so I start working on that instead. And what was
1367360	1372080	supposed to be a fairly modest rewrite, with the intention of I guess, you know, getting the
1372080	1377520	creative juices flowing for the other one, ends up being like a complete overhaul. And by the end of
1377520	1382640	this rewrite, I have deleted about 60,000 words and written another 70,000. And so by the time
1382640	1386640	I'm done with this, and this would have been about a month after the Hobbit videos came out,
1386640	1392880	I was like, hey look, a thing. I guess I have two projects again, sort of. And as far as I can see,
1392880	1398800	trunk novel is the more polished of the two, so why don't we just tepidly see if there's any
1398800	1405280	interest there? So once again, I very tepidly send out like, I don't know, maybe 10 query letters and
1406800	1407840	noes across the board.
1407840	1416800	Okay, fine, this is clearly not meant to be. Fine. And the flavors of the no are pretty much
1416800	1422000	all variations on, I don't think I can sell that. But here's the thing, that revision actually
1422000	1427040	did do the thing it was intended to do, and it helped me figure out how I wanted to fix the bleak
1427040	1431680	ending of commercial as fuck. So you know what, working on trunk novel wasn't a total wash,
1431680	1436160	so I'm working on that, and then I get an email from this agent telling me that she is leaving
1436160	1447600	the agenting industry. Jesus Christ. All right, fine. Fine. I give up. I give up. The end. Oh,
1447600	1454000	wait, no, this is about like triumph or something. Never give up, except for I totally gave up.
1454000	1459760	And this is where my hashtag privilege comes in. So it was almost around this exact time that this
1459760	1466640	rando in Brooklyn emails me like, hey, I'm a literary agent. Do you have one? And this was
1466640	1472080	not the only thing that was going on in my life. Like, if you watch the talk I did for XOXO 2019,
1472080	1477760	which is on their YouTube channel, this was around that time. So, you know, my heroes are dead, my
1477760	1482400	enemies are in power. Not a great time. So he asked me if I have anything that I'd be willing
1482400	1486400	to share, and I'm like, okay, which one do you want? Do you want commercial as fuck or do you
1486400	1492640	want trunk novel? And he says whichever one is more done. So trunk novel it is. So basically,
1492640	1498080	in very short order, he does pinpoint the issue with why agents thought that they could not sell
1498080	1503840	this. And one of these days I might talk about the issue. And no, it wasn't about like problematic
1503840	1509360	content or gender or anything, but it was very small and ultimately very fixable. It was kind
1509360	1516800	of on the level of like, hey, this takes place in Santa Monica. What if it took place in San Diego
1516800	1521680	instead? We'll talk about it one day. So this dude, his name is Christopher Hermelin, and he
1521680	1526640	is part of a boutique agency in Brooklyn. He signs me up, we do a round or two of revisions,
1526640	1532320	and then we go on submission the first week of January. That was on a Monday. I get my first
1532320	1537360	phone call from an editor on a Friday, and then after talking to a few more, ultimately it's sold
1537360	1546480	in less than two weeks. Yep. Okay, so ultimately we come again full circle with that question of
1546480	1551040	why is my thing not selling? What is wrong with my manuscript? Is it my manuscript that's the
1551040	1555280	problem or the market? And in my case, it's a little difficult to answer since I ultimately did
1555840	1560400	sell to a commercial imprint, and the book itself doesn't really fall in line with any publishing
1560400	1565520	trends right now. So it does kind of remain to be seen just how much, if at all, Saint Martin's
1565520	1570560	gamble will pay off. Because that is kind of the reason that agents are so bearish, and they want
1570560	1574960	things that are comparable to things that have already sold well. This, for the record, was mine.
1575520	1582880	Thank you. Thanks for debuting at number one. Readers are creatures of habit. They want things
1582880	1588000	that are like the thing that they've already read. So if I'm to come to a publisher with this book
1588000	1594480	and they're like, okay, what is it about? And I'm like, I don't know, it's Independence Day meets
1594480	1600560	the big short. Mary Doria Russell's Invader Zim. I guess it's kind of fair for them to be like,
1600560	1605200	I don't really care if it's any good or not, I don't know if I can sell that. The point here being
1605200	1611600	is that it is honestly really difficult to tell where the line in the sand is. Your work is not
1611600	1618960	good enough, and the publisher slash agent doesn't think there is a market for it. So in conclusion,
1618960	1623920	something, something, follow your dreams. I think it would have been just as easy for me to be like,
1623920	1629680	yeah, I wrote a thing and it's out now, and then not, you know, cop to the 10 years of,
1630400	1634640	I guess failure is a strong word, struggle. And then people will be like, wow, I guess you just
1634640	1641120	magically did it on the first try when in reality, no. Because it doesn't do anyone any favors to act
1641120	1647920	like, even in a position like mine where I have a relatively large online platform, I didn't have to
1647920	1652880	put in the work and go through a lot of rejection. But here is what I have learned from the thing.
1652880	1657120	Learning to write, learning to be a novelist, and the publishing industry in general is
1657120	1663520	incredibly, incredibly slow going. So you have to be incredibly patient. And looking back,
1663520	1668320	the best choice I made in the whole thing was choosing to trunk that novel in 2014.
1668320	1673440	So the fact that I was able to get in another five years of writing experience actually helped
1673440	1678960	the thing get to a level where it could sell to a major publisher and hopefully will be, you know,
1679520	1685840	not hated by a plurality of you. So in some ways, I think fiction is more difficult to publish than
1685840	1692080	nonfiction because it's harder to really gauge demand for. But that is not to say that nonfiction
1692080	1700240	is easier. It's just different. But a lot of people's success really is owed to luck and timing.
1700240	1705360	These people that you hear of that get these like debut novels with six-figure advances and, you
1705440	1711920	know, they tend to be YA, um, they hit at the right point in the right genre, but they also
1711920	1718640	tend to be outliers. For instance, if you were querying a YA dystopia in 2009, you're probably
1718640	1723440	going to get different results from querying the same book in 2019. A few years ago, author
1723440	1728480	Jim C. Heinz did a survey of traditionally published authors to see how long it actually
1728480	1735120	took them to get published, and the average length of time was, drumroll, 11 years. So what
1735120	1740480	does that mean for this channel? Is this going to turn into this shameless self-promotion channel?
1740480	1747440	Well, no, not yet. I mean, six months it will. But I do imagine that this has shed some light on
1748480	1753760	why this channel hasn't been as prolific as it has been in years past. And one more thing with
1753760	1758720	regard to pre-orders, and this applies to pretty much all traditionally published authors, is if
1758720	1763840	you want to support an author and you plan on buying the book anyway, pre-orders are a great way
1763840	1768000	to do that because it helps the publisher decide where they are going to end up, you know,
1768640	1772400	spending their resources. Who gets the marketing? Who gets to go on a book tour?
1772400	1777360	Pre-orders are basically their barometer to, you know, who gives a shit. So if you want to pre-order
1777360	1783120	American Three-Body Problem for Girls, the link is in the description. It is available in hardcover
1783120	1787280	and Kindle right now. I guess the paperback will be like, I don't know, six months or a year after that.
1787280	1792800	And yeah, this won't be the last video of this kind. I will probably be doing a lot more process
1792800	1797760	slash publishing industry type stuff in the months and years to come. Although yes, don't worry,
1797760	1804720	we will still be doing traditional video essay type stuff too. So yeah, so yeah, I know everybody
1804720	1809840	can't wait for this YouTuber book. This should be, this should be an interesting journey that we can
1809840	1815040	all go on together. Hope this was some help, and if it wasn't, well, hope at least it was
1815040	1822000	entertaining to watch. This is gonna be a long year. Happy end of the decade, everybody!
