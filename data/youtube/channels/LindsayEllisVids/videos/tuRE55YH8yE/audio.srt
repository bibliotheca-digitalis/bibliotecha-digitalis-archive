1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
So a couple months ago, I used YouTube's post feature to announce by way of a screen cap,

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,360
because it had to be a screen cap because the announcement was behind a paywall,

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,680
that I sold a novel to commercial fiction publisher St. Martin's Press,

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:26,160
Axioms, and a Stranger Things meets Arrival story set in an alternate 2000s about a young woman who

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,120
becomes the sole point of communication between humanity and a hostile alien civilization.

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,920
Okay, and so for you smartasses who are bagging on this, I did not write this. I honestly don't

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,560
know where they got Stranger Things. It doesn't take place in the 80s. It's not even like,

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:48,640
you know, magical metaphysical stuff. Is it on brand? Yes. Is it too long? Probably.

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,040
Can I pre-order it? Actually, you can. They got right on the ball. And I know what you're thinking,

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,880
like, oh, another one of those, you know? Here I have been slaving away at the great American

11
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:06,240
novel for decades, and another one of these YouTubers just has a book deal like foisted

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,040
upon them. The influencers sit recumbent on the chaise lounge and receive the offers.

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,320
When in reality, I have been working at this for 10 fucking years. Well, no, I don't mean literally

14
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,640
the same book for 10 years. It did not take me 10 years to write this. Well, I mean, sort of. Anyway,

15
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,040
we'll get to that. And the truth is, yes, it is a lot easier for some people with bigger platforms

16
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,840
to get book deals than others, but that also depends on the type of book that they are writing.

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,400
In the case of YouTubers and influencers, what publishers usually want is like, you know,

18
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,880
my life as a girl boss the book, or hi, I'm an Instagram model the book. But I was like, no,

19
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,920
I like suffering. I want to write novels. Better yet, of the science fiction variety.

20
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,880
You know, science fiction, that, that biggest piece of the publishing pie. Everybody loves it,

21
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,160
so in demand. It's not. So today I'm doing something a little different in discussing

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,640
how does one actually go about publishing a novel. I'm going to demystify the process.

23
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,880
Because I know a lot of people that subscribe to this channel are either creatives or aspiring

24
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:21,360
creatives themselves. You need to know what holy hell you're getting into and decide, can I handle

25
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,560
that many rejection letters? So how it works. If it's your first time, fiction and nonfiction

26
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,560
are handled generally quite differently. Nonfiction is generally sold on proposal,

27
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,320
meaning there will be between one and three chapters of the book written, and also you'll

28
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,720
have like a bio and then like some stuff about your platform and an outline of the book and,

29
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,280
you know, a section saying why I am the expert that should be writing this book. And with fiction,

30
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,200
again for debut authors that aren't famous, it needs to be done. The book needs to be 100%

31
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,480
written. Debut novels are very, very rarely sold on proposal. Outliers to the point of

32
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,880
should not be counted. Yes, I know it happens, but it doesn't happen very often. I mean a debut novel

33
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:05,040
might be sold on proposal if it's by like a celebrity or, you know, it's like a YA adventure

34
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,400
about like beating the system written by a YouTuber with more than 10 million subs, but,

35
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,280
you know, if that's the case, they're probably hiring a ghostwriter anyway. I am obsessed with

36
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,320
this shirt I got by the by Pantages the other day. The Cats trailer has sent me spiraling into

37
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,520
a severe Andrew Lloyd Webber relapse this fall. Anyway, yes, there are famous people exceptions,

38
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,000
but in general, debut novels are not sold on proposal. It needs to be done, and by done,

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,160
I mean it needs to be edited, it needs to be polished, it needs to have gone through several

40
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:40,240
drafts, and by the time you think you are ready to go, you are wrong. Put that thing back in the

41
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,640
drawer, take it around the block a few more times, it still needs work. Trust me. You have to be able

42
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,440
to look at this thing and go, yes, I could see this going to print tomorrow. This is the level

43
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,200
that we're at. The thing about writing, especially something as like sprawling as a novel, is that

44
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,800
writers are actually not very good at judging the merits of their own work. Shock, I know.

45
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,680
When the truth is, nine times out of ten, authors think they are ready to go before they are ready

46
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,360
to go. I know I was. We'll get to that. But now that you have written the thing, it is time for

47
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,320
step two. Get a literary agent. Arguably the hardest step, because this is the part in which

48
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,200
the odds are least in your favor. So you've submitted your query, you are now in the slush

49
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,040
pile, which is a very uncharitable name for unsolicited material, because most of it is

50
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,000
detritus. Yes, there was a time when authors submitted directly to publishers and they did

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,520
not need a literary agent. We call those times the 1970s. Yes, there are some exceptions, but for

52
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,360
your purposes, if you want to get published with a major publisher, and most small presses, and a

53
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,160
huge chunk of indie presses too, you need a literary agent. They won't even look at you if

54
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,120
you don't have one. And while we are here, no, you do not pay your literary agent before you sell

55
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,840
your book. They take a cut after they sell your book. If there is an agent saying that you need

56
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,320
to pay them up front, they're not an agent, they're lying. It's a scam. Run away. So what does a

57
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,640
literary agent do? Are they anything other than a glorified filter that exists to separate the

58
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:16,160
rabble from the publisher so the publisher doesn't have to waste their precious time and resources

59
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:23,840
anymore? Well... See, here's the thing. You are a special flower, an artiste floating along on the

60
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:31,360
winds of inspiration. You don't understand contracts. The publishing industry is labyrinthine

61
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,960
and complicated, and it has a culture that you do not understand. I know I don't. On top of that,

62
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,400
contracts have gotten a lot more complicated since the 1970s. Mine, for instance, was pretty

63
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,120
boilerplate, and it still took two months between selling the book and signing the thing. That was

64
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,320
a pretty quick turnaround. On top of that, agents also negotiate royalty rates and advances for you,

65
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,280
and also advise on what you should ask for in your contract, because they know what is standard

66
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,080
and what is reasonable to ask for, and you don't. But there is a creative element, too. A lot of

67
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,360
literary agents will actually do a pass, do some edits with you before you actually go on submission

68
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,320
to publishers. They also act as sort of a go-between between you and the publisher, you know,

69
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,400
so they can, like, soak up the emotions if you have too many, because it turns out you're not

70
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,480
supposed to yell at your publisher. They ask you how you are and you just have to say that you're

71
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,000
fine when you're not really fine, but you just can't get into it because they wouldn't have run.

72
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,560
So why are the odds not in your favor at this stage? Well, it's because of volume. It's hard

73
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,560
to find exact stats on this, how many submissions any given literary agent gets per day. My agent

74
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,680
gets between 15 and 20 per day. So depending on the size of the agency, a literary agent is going

75
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,680
to get anywhere from several hundred to several thousand queries per year, and depending on how

76
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,400
much they are trying to build their list, they may only take on half a dozen or less. So I'm not

77
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,880
saying you have less than one in a thousand odds for your basic midlist literary agent.

78
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,120
Actually, I am saying that. That brings us to step 2.5, the query letter.

79
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay, so if you're a novelist, you're probably not very good at being concise,

80
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,960
but the query letter is basically a two paragraph less than 250 word pitch. It's basically the copy

81
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,640
you would read on the back of the book. It is designed to make the person reading it be like,

82
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:30,960
oh yeah, I want to throw down my 2795 MSRP for that. It's not a summary. You should not

83
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,680
summarize. It is a pitch, and it's actually really hard to do well. A bard, a mage, and a rogue meet

84
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,320
in a tavern, and then they hear of a quest. There's a business centaur that owns a company,

85
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,000
and he's just, he's living his life until one day a plucky young virgin

86
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,680
becomes his secretary or something. And then, oh, the past. Yeah, see, I'm really good at that.

87
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,160
So each literary agency operates differently, but in general the steps will be query letter leads to

88
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,320
partial request, which means part of your manuscript, like first five chapters or

89
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,040
something. If they like that, then they'll ask for the whole manuscript, and if they like that,

90
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:18,880
then they will offer you representation. Generally, this process will be protracted

91
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,840
over several months, unless you're just that amazing. Sometimes it can be really fast,

92
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,680
but usually it's not. Wow, you have an agent now. Good for her. Hopefully your agent will help you

93
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,400
out on the creative front too, because presumably they took on your project not just because they

94
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,160
thought they could sell it, but you know, because they like it. And the level to which they will

95
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:44,000
help you before you go on submission to publishers varies a lot. Like, it could be just like an email

96
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,640
with like, hey, maybe you should like brush this up, or like, you know, you use the word

97
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,880
basically too much. Or they could do like an entire line edit through your manuscripts.

98
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:59,200
Depends on the agent. Next top book deal? Well, not so fast. First we got to talk about who we

99
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,480
are submitting to. Generally, an agent will want to start with big five publishers, because they

100
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,880
are the ones with the money, and they are the ones with the best marketing and the widest distribution.

101
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,200
So what do I mean when I say big five? Well, basically they're the biggest five, but also

102
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,280
they are umbrella corporations effectively for many, many, many publishers. The big five are

103
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:27,680
Penguin Random House, Simon & Schuster, Hachette, Macmillan, which is mine, and HarperCollins.

104
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,600
The way it works is at the top we have the publishing house, then you have the publisher,

105
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,440
then you have the imprint. And the imprint is where the editor works. They are the one

106
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,800
that specialize in whatever it is you are trying to sell. For instance, my imprint is

107
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:49,040
Saint Martin's Press, which is an imprint of Saint Martin's Press, which is owned by Macmillan.

108
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,240
Imprints specialize in different things, so for instance you'll have Tor Forge, which specializes

109
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,000
in sci-fi and fantasy. Love Swept will be HarperCollins. Is it HarperCollins? No, it's

110
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,720
Random House. Well anyway, it's a romance imprint. Saint Martin's Press specializes in commercial

111
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:11,920
fiction, which obviously can mean genre fiction, but you know, a certain type. Let's just say I was

112
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,880
rejected for more than one genre imprint for not being sci-fi enough. It's a rival meets changer

113
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,200
thing. So big five publishers are desirable not just because they are able to pay advances,

114
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,080
sometimes very big ones, but also because they have much wider distribution. Generally you'll go

115
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,200
on a round of submission. You'll see how that goes. Maybe it'll sell on the first round, but if it

116
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,600
doesn't, you probably want to do some revisions before you go on round two, and then when you go

117
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,920
on round two and it doesn't sell then, then maybe you want to start seriously considering smaller

118
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,840
presses or indie presses or self-publishing or trunking it, and we'll get to that. Okay, so let's

119
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,880
say you are on submission. If there is more than one offer, then it goes to auction, and auctions

120
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,120
are great. They make you feel really popular, but most of the time for debut authors, especially if

121
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,000
they don't have a big platform, this process will be protracted over a period of several months.

122
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,080
So while on the one hand there are an ever-increasing number of options to get your

123
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,920
book out there, traditional publishing is actually more competitive than it has ever ever been.

124
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,880
Yeah, especially for fiction. And that leads us to my monstrosity. Ten years, huh?

125
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,000
That seems, like, sad.

126
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,560
There is this expectation when you work in a new media that people think that you're gonna be like,

127
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,200
you know what? I'm bucking the system. Screw you, gatekeepers. I gotta do me.

128
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:44,160
But no, no, that is not what I wanted to do. So this is a story about traditional publishing

129
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:52,400
and rejection and all sorts of fun things, and why I never talked about it. Till now.

130
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:58,240
So let's get this out of the way first. There's this sort of wrong-ish idea I see floating around

131
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,320
that if you have a platform of, you know, decently sized, that you're pretty much guaranteed a book

132
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,840
deal. And, uh, you know, wow. You know, that's not true. And I will find that people that even

133
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,480
work in the industry are surprised that, like, my platform didn't get me something much sooner.

134
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,560
Which inevitably leads to these dipshits on Reddit surmising that, like, well if you can't

135
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:24,960
get a book deal despite those YouTube subs, well, woof. Which just kind of reveals that these people

136
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,520
don't know how anything works, and that's fine. That's why I'm here. Fundamentally,

137
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:35,760
quality is secondary to where the market is and what they think they can sell. Especially for

138
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,040
fiction, a thing no one should write. Okay, so what did I mean by that? When I said this whole

139
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:47,760
big nonsense thing took 10 years, what I mean is it was about 10 years between my conscious decision

140
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,200
of, yes, I am going to pursue this thing. By this thing, I mean traditional publishing with a Big

141
00:12:53,200 --> 00:13:00,560
Five publisher, and it actually happening. Was the novel I sold the first novel I wrote? No.

142
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,440
I'd argue that it wasn't even the second, but it was also kind of the first. I said it was the

143
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,240
first and, well, anyway. So I joke a lot about fanfic, but the truth is fanfic is actually

144
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,240
really good practice and a good way to decide if that is something that you want to pursue.

145
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,920
And I joke about it a lot, especially with the Phantom stuff, but the truth is I was not

146
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:24,240
terribly prolific until I was in college because I had this narrative about myself that, you know,

147
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,480
I just don't finish things. I'm just, I just, I don't have the attention span. Too bad for me.

148
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,600
I guess I'm just gonna work in data collection for the rest of my life because I'm 22 and I don't

149
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,680
know anything. But then, thanks to the wonderful world of fanfiction, I actually did start

150
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,760
finishing some stuff. You know, it wasn't good, but I finished it. So, again, this was around

151
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,360
the time that the, you know, economy crashed and I went to grad school. So going into film

152
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,240
and television, of course, that's where we're going to start making serious attempts. Because,

153
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,160
after all, there was no way in hell I was going to go into a creative writing MFA on the strength

154
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:09,360
of a few overlong fanfics. No. Going into debt at one of the most expensive film schools in the world

155
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:16,480
during the worst recession in living memory is a much better idea. So, yeah, we're at film school.

156
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:23,280
It's 2009. Part of the curriculum is let's come up with some story ideas. There's a class called

157
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:32,160
ideation. We have fun. So the first non-fanfic thing I wrote was this sad sack attempt at a

158
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,880
Christian romance novel because I knew someone who worked at the harlequin imprint for Christian

159
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,640
romance called Love Inspired and this imprint was one of the only imprints that was taking

160
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:51,680
unagented authors and I, in my infinite hubris, was like, anyone can do that! At least I got some

161
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,040
practice in. I did also write a full-length screenplay while I was at USC for a class. No,

162
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,680
it will never see the light of day because it was quite bad. But then I got an idea in 2012

163
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,080
that was rooted in some items that were in the news at the time.

164
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,360
How about that but with aliens? But no, I did not start writing it then. That did not happen until

165
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:20,480
2013 and I wrote the first draft in two months. It was one twilight long because I measure everything

166
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:27,040
in units of twilight. This is a twilight. This book actually has really big print. It's not that long.

167
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,480
That first draft was described by one person that I no longer speak to at the time as

168
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,200
publishable, which is probably a little bit of a red flag when the people in your life don't

169
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,760
really have the heart to tell you that your word baby is a bit of a yike. But I, in my infinite

170
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:49,600
arrogance, was like, we're off to the races. I very wrongly assumed that my platform, which

171
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,600
was much smaller than it is now, would make me a catch. So even if the book wasn't all that great

172
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,760
and sure as hell was not ready, it didn't matter. They'd help me fix it. I've got 20,000 Twitter

173
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:08,480
followers. I think I might have done like one very minor revision before I sent it to, um,

174
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,680
actually like not very many agents. I only think I only sent it to a few and one of whom I knew

175
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,840
personally. 5,000 words to very nicely say yikes. Which was good because it finally brought me down

176
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:25,200
to reality and realized that like, oh, I actually maybe should take this a little more seriously. So

177
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,640
I spent a few months on revisions and now armed with, you know, a little bit of perspective,

178
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:36,560
uh, we tried round two. This time I actually queried pretty widely. I got interest from about

179
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,640
30% of the agents I queried and then actually it happened rather quickly. I got an offer of

180
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:50,000
representation after about two, three months and then I had an agent. We did it. I hopped the

181
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:58,240
hardest turtle, right? So what now? Well, we revise it again substantially before we go on

182
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,000
submission. Submission round one, mostly big five and a couple of smaller publishers like Quirk

183
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:12,640
Books. Generally a round of submission will be between maybe 10 and 15 editors and, uh, wow,

184
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,600
that was a lot of rejection. Like I got rejected so hard I don't think I got like a detailed

185
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,520
rejection letter from anyone. And that whole rigmarole from start to final no thank was about

186
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:30,640
four months. So, uh, yeah. So what now? Well, we revise again. Let's try to figure out what was

187
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,080
wrong. Another round of submissions. This time it was, I think, a few more, maybe 15. And this time,

188
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:45,520
well, I got one or two rejections that were quite detailed. See? Progress. One or two felt it wasn't

189
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,120
commercial enough. The guy at HarperCollins thought I was whip smart. But most people just

190
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,520
didn't connect with the voice, which is, of course, industry to speak for. I think you're

191
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,200
a shitty writer. And here we are at the end of 2014. Two years of work and nothing to show for

192
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,840
it. What now? You can go downstream to smaller presses which, you know, might give you less money

193
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:14,400
up front but will still distribute as widely as any of the larger ones. Or you can go indie

194
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,920
or you can self-publish. I mean, that kind of makes sense. If you have a platform already,

195
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,640
self-publishing does mean you get to keep a much bigger cut of the money that comes in for you.

196
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:32,960
But there is a third option. We got us a trunk novel. The trunk novel. Everyone has one. They

197
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,400
don't. So, yeah, I could have self-published. Even now I get a lot of people asking me why I didn't

198
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,880
because, like, you know, hey, there's no shame in it. And also you'd make a lot more money with your

199
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,320
platform. And, well, okay. First of all, I don't know about that. I'm gonna, I'm gonna have to

200
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,720
disagree with you there, Bard. And secondly, I did not want to self-publish. Like, I'd self-publish

201
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,920
right here. Like, this is what I'm doing. That's what YouTube is. All I do is self-publish. But

202
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,920
ultimately the reason that I trunked it was because I felt that the reason it wasn't selling

203
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:09,760
wasn't because the market was necessarily hostile to that sort of thing, which it totally was, but

204
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,840
because it wasn't ready. And, by extension, I was not ready. I had not put in the work. I had not

205
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,160
done the hours. And there are many people who would call this flawed thinking. After all, publishing

206
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,000
is very fickle and they always play it safe. And most of the time, whenever you get a no from an

207
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,680
agent or publisher, it isn't because they don't like it. It's because they don't think they can

208
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,320
sell it. They don't think it will move copies. Yeah, after my book comes out, we will, we can talk about

209
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:41,280
the why. It was a hard sell, but the TLDR is it doesn't really fit with any kind of publishing

210
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,920
trends right now. That's it. That was actually simple. But at the end of the day, in my heart

211
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:51,040
of hearts, I knew trunk novel had major problems. Like, you know, there were definitely some

212
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:56,400
contrivances. Some of it was really half-assed. It read like a debut novel, which it was. So I put the

213
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:04,640
book away. The book has been trunked. Time to move on. Round two, 2015-2016. We have moved on completely.

214
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,240
I get an idea for a new novel, wholly unrelated to the first one, same genre, doesn't have aliens in

215
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,600
it. I very naively thought that this one would be more commercial, despite the fact that it was still

216
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,040
genre fiction, a thing that no one should ever write. I very naively gave it the working title

217
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:26,560
commercial as fuck, because I thought it would be. So I broke up with the first literary agent,

218
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:32,720
No Hard Feelings, because surely I will have no problem getting a literary agent that is more,

219
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:42,400
I don't know, suited to what I'm going for. I'm me. Huh. Looks like the lighting and setup has slightly

220
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,680
changed. It's not totally because I filmed this on a different day. I still have two copies of

221
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:53,600
John Scalzi's The Consuming Fire, though. This one says happy birthday. So I start writing commercial

222
00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:00,880
as fuck over late 2016, early 2017, and then I start querying commercial as fuck around mid-2017,

223
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:09,680
and this one gets even less interesting the last time. Fucking really? This is supposed to be

224
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,720
commercial as fuck. So yeah, I got a bunch of partial requests and a bunch of full requests, but

225
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,160
ultimately no offers, asterisk. And a lot of the times it would get rejected for reasons that would

226
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,200
be like totally fixable, like, you know, location or something, and it would be like, oh well, I could

227
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,840
revise that. Okay. And while we are here, the truth is these days, if your book needs a lot of revision

228
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,560
or even not that much revision, agents probably aren't going to be interested in walking you

229
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,200
through it, although it does depend on the agent. Your mileage may vary. But I did find one agent

230
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,120
that was willing to work with it and was really interested in fixing it, you know, like the

231
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:52,240
characters, like the premise, but the ending is a little too bleak. And I'm like, look, it's 2017.

232
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,160
My heroes are dead and my enemies are in power. What do you want? But point taken. So she is willing

233
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,120
to talk representation if I am able to revise the thing in a way that she thinks can sell, but the

234
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,000
problem is I don't really know how I want to revise it. This is just where I'm at. So despite

235
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,720
the extensive feedback that this agent gives me, I sit on this thing for many months, not quite

236
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,320
knowing how to fix it. But it is at this point in early 2018, a full three years after our trunk

237
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,840
novel has been trunked, that I go ahead and dig that one out, maybe thinking that will inspire me,

238
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,160
and it is at this point that I remember what interested me so much in that story in the first

239
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,160
place. But it is also at this point that the problems that had been plaguing the thing basically

240
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:36,800
since its inception become wildly obvious to me. Why is it so expository in the first five chapters?

241
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,160
Why is the entire third act like that? Why did I not do a motivation better? And so trunk novel is

242
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,360
where my inspiration goes, not commercial as fuck, so I start working on that instead. And what was

243
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,080
supposed to be a fairly modest rewrite, with the intention of I guess, you know, getting the

244
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,520
creative juices flowing for the other one, ends up being like a complete overhaul. And by the end of

245
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,640
this rewrite, I have deleted about 60,000 words and written another 70,000. And so by the time

246
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,640
I'm done with this, and this would have been about a month after the Hobbit videos came out,

247
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,880
I was like, hey look, a thing. I guess I have two projects again, sort of. And as far as I can see,

248
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,800
trunk novel is the more polished of the two, so why don't we just tepidly see if there's any

249
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:25,280
interest there? So once again, I very tepidly send out like, I don't know, maybe 10 query letters and

250
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,840
noes across the board.

251
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:36,800
Okay, fine, this is clearly not meant to be. Fine. And the flavors of the no are pretty much

252
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,000
all variations on, I don't think I can sell that. But here's the thing, that revision actually

253
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,040
did do the thing it was intended to do, and it helped me figure out how I wanted to fix the bleak

254
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,680
ending of commercial as fuck. So you know what, working on trunk novel wasn't a total wash,

255
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,160
so I'm working on that, and then I get an email from this agent telling me that she is leaving

256
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:07,600
the agenting industry. Jesus Christ. All right, fine. Fine. I give up. I give up. The end. Oh,

257
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:14,000
wait, no, this is about like triumph or something. Never give up, except for I totally gave up.

258
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,760
And this is where my hashtag privilege comes in. So it was almost around this exact time that this

259
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:26,640
rando in Brooklyn emails me like, hey, I'm a literary agent. Do you have one? And this was

260
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,080
not the only thing that was going on in my life. Like, if you watch the talk I did for XOXO 2019,

261
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,760
which is on their YouTube channel, this was around that time. So, you know, my heroes are dead, my

262
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,400
enemies are in power. Not a great time. So he asked me if I have anything that I'd be willing

263
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,400
to share, and I'm like, okay, which one do you want? Do you want commercial as fuck or do you

264
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,640
want trunk novel? And he says whichever one is more done. So trunk novel it is. So basically,

265
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:58,080
in very short order, he does pinpoint the issue with why agents thought that they could not sell

266
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,840
this. And one of these days I might talk about the issue. And no, it wasn't about like problematic

267
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,360
content or gender or anything, but it was very small and ultimately very fixable. It was kind

268
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:16,800
of on the level of like, hey, this takes place in Santa Monica. What if it took place in San Diego

269
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,680
instead? We'll talk about it one day. So this dude, his name is Christopher Hermelin, and he

270
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,640
is part of a boutique agency in Brooklyn. He signs me up, we do a round or two of revisions,

271
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,320
and then we go on submission the first week of January. That was on a Monday. I get my first

272
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,360
phone call from an editor on a Friday, and then after talking to a few more, ultimately it's sold

273
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:46,480
in less than two weeks. Yep. Okay, so ultimately we come again full circle with that question of

274
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,040
why is my thing not selling? What is wrong with my manuscript? Is it my manuscript that's the

275
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,280
problem or the market? And in my case, it's a little difficult to answer since I ultimately did

276
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,400
sell to a commercial imprint, and the book itself doesn't really fall in line with any publishing

277
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,520
trends right now. So it does kind of remain to be seen just how much, if at all, Saint Martin's

278
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,560
gamble will pay off. Because that is kind of the reason that agents are so bearish, and they want

279
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,960
things that are comparable to things that have already sold well. This, for the record, was mine.

280
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:22,880
Thank you. Thanks for debuting at number one. Readers are creatures of habit. They want things

281
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,000
that are like the thing that they've already read. So if I'm to come to a publisher with this book

282
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,480
and they're like, okay, what is it about? And I'm like, I don't know, it's Independence Day meets

283
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,560
the big short. Mary Doria Russell's Invader Zim. I guess it's kind of fair for them to be like,

284
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:45,200
I don't really care if it's any good or not, I don't know if I can sell that. The point here being

285
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:51,600
is that it is honestly really difficult to tell where the line in the sand is. Your work is not

286
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:58,960
good enough, and the publisher slash agent doesn't think there is a market for it. So in conclusion,

287
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,920
something, something, follow your dreams. I think it would have been just as easy for me to be like,

288
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:09,680
yeah, I wrote a thing and it's out now, and then not, you know, cop to the 10 years of,

289
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,640
I guess failure is a strong word, struggle. And then people will be like, wow, I guess you just

290
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:21,120
magically did it on the first try when in reality, no. Because it doesn't do anyone any favors to act

291
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,920
like, even in a position like mine where I have a relatively large online platform, I didn't have to

292
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:32,880
put in the work and go through a lot of rejection. But here is what I have learned from the thing.

293
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,120
Learning to write, learning to be a novelist, and the publishing industry in general is

294
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:43,520
incredibly, incredibly slow going. So you have to be incredibly patient. And looking back,

295
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,320
the best choice I made in the whole thing was choosing to trunk that novel in 2014.

296
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,440
So the fact that I was able to get in another five years of writing experience actually helped

297
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,960
the thing get to a level where it could sell to a major publisher and hopefully will be, you know,

298
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:05,840
not hated by a plurality of you. So in some ways, I think fiction is more difficult to publish than

299
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:12,080
nonfiction because it's harder to really gauge demand for. But that is not to say that nonfiction

300
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:20,240
is easier. It's just different. But a lot of people's success really is owed to luck and timing.

301
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,360
These people that you hear of that get these like debut novels with six-figure advances and, you

302
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,920
know, they tend to be YA, um, they hit at the right point in the right genre, but they also

303
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:38,640
tend to be outliers. For instance, if you were querying a YA dystopia in 2009, you're probably

304
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,440
going to get different results from querying the same book in 2019. A few years ago, author

305
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,480
Jim C. Heinz did a survey of traditionally published authors to see how long it actually

306
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:55,120
took them to get published, and the average length of time was, drumroll, 11 years. So what

307
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,480
does that mean for this channel? Is this going to turn into this shameless self-promotion channel?

308
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:07,440
Well, no, not yet. I mean, six months it will. But I do imagine that this has shed some light on

309
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,760
why this channel hasn't been as prolific as it has been in years past. And one more thing with

310
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,720
regard to pre-orders, and this applies to pretty much all traditionally published authors, is if

311
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,840
you want to support an author and you plan on buying the book anyway, pre-orders are a great way

312
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,000
to do that because it helps the publisher decide where they are going to end up, you know,

313
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,400
spending their resources. Who gets the marketing? Who gets to go on a book tour?

314
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,360
Pre-orders are basically their barometer to, you know, who gives a shit. So if you want to pre-order

315
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,120
American Three-Body Problem for Girls, the link is in the description. It is available in hardcover

316
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,280
and Kindle right now. I guess the paperback will be like, I don't know, six months or a year after that.

317
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:52,800
And yeah, this won't be the last video of this kind. I will probably be doing a lot more process

318
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,760
slash publishing industry type stuff in the months and years to come. Although yes, don't worry,

319
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:04,720
we will still be doing traditional video essay type stuff too. So yeah, so yeah, I know everybody

320
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,840
can't wait for this YouTuber book. This should be, this should be an interesting journey that we can

321
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,040
all go on together. Hope this was some help, and if it wasn't, well, hope at least it was

322
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:22,000
entertaining to watch. This is gonna be a long year. Happy end of the decade, everybody!
