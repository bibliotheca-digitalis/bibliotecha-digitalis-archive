00:00.000 --> 00:13.200
So, um, I've been seeing, um, a lot of people recently using Mel Brooks as a sort of blanket defense of any kind of, you know, satire that transgresses societal taboos.

00:13.200 --> 00:20.000
Um, and, you know, this is nothing new. I've been seeing, uh, Mel Brooks used in this way for decades.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
You couldn't make a Mel Brooks movie today

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Cause I saw Blazing Saddles yesterday

00:30.000 --> 00:38.000
But the, um, the problem with that line of thinking is, uh, it misunderstands what made Mel Brooks great.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
What makes him resonate. So today, we're gonna talk about Mel Brooks.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
The year was 2004.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Are you gonna eat your tots?

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
The United States had just invaded Iraq. The Black Eyed Peas were getting retarded in here.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Let's get retarded. Let's get retarded in here.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Zach Braff was at his artistic peak.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Blah blah blah blah blah.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
And The Producers was still one of the hottest tickets on Broadway.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
Stand alone, stand behind me.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick had returned to the roles which they had originated, which had netted a then record-breaking 12 Tonys.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
Student Rush tickets were really cheap back then, so I was seeing every musical that I could on Broadway.

01:19.000 --> 01:27.000
But to this day, I have never laughed harder at any stage production than at that original cast of Mel Brooks' The Producers in 2004.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
Come on Germans, go into your dance.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
And if you've only seen the movie adaptation of the stage musical, you might be wondering, really?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Work, work, work. Work, work, work.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
And, yes.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
I can't even really explain what was lost in translation in the movie adaptation of the musical.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
It's functionally identical.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
Perhaps too identical, because everything that made it work on stage, it just doesn't work on film.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
They come here, they all come here.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
How do they find me?

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
That the aesthetics of breaking the fourth wall on film are just different than on stage.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Why bloom go so far, camera right?

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
The stage musical is also a big love letter to the heydays of the 40s and 50s musical pageantry,

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
and the world of the stage in general.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
We all love this thing called the theater.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
The movie version either did not know how to capture this, or did not care to capture this on film.

02:23.000 --> 02:31.000
But maybe it's just being in the same room with these world-class trained showgirls tap dancing in stormtrooper outfits is just hilarious.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
We're on screen, it's like, it just feels tired.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
It feels like we've been here before.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
That is why they call me Rolf.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Don't be stupid, be a smarty, come and join the Nazi party.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
So if you guys want to talk about Mel Brooks and where, when, and how he was a comedy innovator,

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
then let's talk about Mel Brooks.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Mel Brooks was born Melvin Kaminsky in Brooklyn, New York in 1926.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
His father died when he was two, and the youngest of four boys, he was a small sickly kid who got picked on a lot.

03:07.000 --> 03:14.000
Brooks would later go on to say that this was where he learned to use comedy as a defense mechanism, to cloak his pain in humor.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
I want to thank Hitler for being such a funny guy on stage.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Mel Brooks would also like you to know that he is a Jew.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
Jews in space!

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
Behind me you see a phalanx, an avalanche of Jews who have come with their...

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
We're Jews out in space.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
We're zooming along, protecting the Hebrew race.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
I don't like the way you're walking.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
You've been into the sacramental wine again.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
Then go and attack us.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
We'll give them a smack, we'll slap them right back in the face.

03:54.000 --> 04:01.000
After serving as a corporal in World War II in Germany, engaging in such operations as defusing landmines,

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Brooks was hired by Sid Caesar to be a television comedy writer.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
It was during this period as a television writer that Brooks developed his comedy ethos,

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
which is basically throw everything at the wall and see what sticks.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Halt!

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
Du hast gespritzt eine General?

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
You see this in his most popular movies. It's just joke after joke after joke.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
If there is a dud, there is hardly time for it to land before the next joke starts.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Well, that's the end of this suit.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
So while Brooks definitely had an ethos, biases, and a point of view in his comedy,

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
the rapid-fire nature of it kind of make it clear that he didn't think through the implications of a lot of it.

04:40.000 --> 04:47.000
You've just entered the territory of Robin Hood and his merry men.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Fagolith?

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
No, no, no. We're straight. Just merry.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Some of Brooks' comedy, with gay characters in particular, has aged poorly.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
While Brooks was certainly not averse to physical comedy and slapstick,

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
Fag! Fag! Fagol! Fagol!

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
his bread-and-butter tended to rest more on transgression of societal taboos.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Some of it has aged well.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Come on. How about a good ol' motherfucker work song?

05:12.000 --> 05:20.000
I get no kick from champagne.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Some of it has not.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Watch me faggot!

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
And here's why that doesn't bother me personally as a viewer.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
Comedy is the quickest to age and the most likely to age poorly.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
Yes, some of it, even a lot of it, is problematic.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Yes, you can still enjoy it. I do.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
His 1974 film Blazing Saddles is one of the great transgressive comedies of all time.

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
Here we take the good time and trouble to slaughter every last Indian in the West, and for what?

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
So they can appoint a sheriff that's blacker than any Indian.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
From top to bottom, Blazing Saddles is a razor-sharp skewering of the absurdity of racism.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
These are people of the land.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
The common clay of the New West.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
You know.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Morons.

06:14.000 --> 06:22.000
And this is part of what makes Brooks so fondly remembered today, where the likes of, say, David Zucker are kind of sad.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
Well, people still think airplane is funny, so there's that.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
As an outgrowth from his difficult childhood, Brooks wasn't just about comedy for comedy's sake.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Comedy could be a weapon.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
And one of Brooks' favorite targets happened to be history's greatest monster.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Hitler on ice!

06:45.000 --> 06:52.000
Brooks saw comedy not just as a weapon of ridicule, but as a way of robbing Hitler of his posthumous power.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
Brooks' approach of reducto ad absurdum to Nazis was a catharsis for Jewish identity.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
And this hardly started with Brooks.

06:59.000 --> 07:06.000
Yiddish folklore is full of these trickster, Bugs Bunny-style characters who confront corrupt and unjust power structures using nothing but their wits,

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Herschel Vostropol being one of the most well-known.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
The Inquisition!

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Look out, Sam!

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
We have a mission to convert the Jews!

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Brooks' subjects also weren't limited to Nazi violence against the Jews.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
Take one of the more famous scenes from History of the World, Part 1.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
It's better to lose your skullcap than your skull!

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Or your guvalt!

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
There you have Brooks' own filmmaking light of a period of history that, while nowhere near the Holocaust in terms of scale,

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
still openly targeted Jewish citizens.

07:36.000 --> 07:43.000
And it's debatable how mining Jewish suffering, even if you are Jewish, for comedy in the Spanish Inquisition differs from the Holocaust,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
which Brooks has always avoided depicting directly.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
But he has also gone on record as saying that the root of a lot of his humor is anger,

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
specifically anger at anti-Semitism.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
The problem with this kind of media, created by a Jew as an expression of Jewish identity,

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
to be consumed largely, however, by a Gentile audience is that

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
the Goliath will always watch you, watch you, watch you, watch you, watch you, watch you.

08:09.000 --> 08:21.000
And there's a little bit of troubling history of things that Jews say and do being misrepresented and used against them.

08:21.000 --> 08:33.000
Let's go back now, way back, back before Brooks, to what laid the groundwork for Springtime for Hitler,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
to even survive and thrive in the first place.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Yes, let's go back to the big H in question.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
Film about World War II was box office gold before the United States even entered the war,

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
and most everything that came out during that time glorified the war machine just as much as anything Germany was sharting out.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
Film and literature about the war were used to boost a narrative of American exceptionalism and greatness.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
According to Thomas Doherty,

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
But while this American ascendancy was fueled by images of the machine of war,

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
little confronted the actual ideology of fascism or the true horrors perpetrated in the name of Hitler's Reich.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
One of the earliest and most well-known examples of satirizing Hitler's brand of fascism

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
came in the form of Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
A huge chunk of The Great Dictator is a very surreal watch today.

09:31.000 --> 09:38.000
It consists of cute, wacky hijinks in the Jewish ghetto in the fictional country of Thomania.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
See, concentration camps were certainly a thing in 1940, and it was a thing Americans knew about.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
But the scope of it was not the scope we know today.

09:56.000 --> 10:04.000
The Great Dictator was made in a time when Hitler's death machine was only a possibility and not a historical reality.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
The Great Dictator is unique not only in that it confronts Hitler's ideology,

10:08.000 --> 10:20.000
But that it also puts Hitler's biggest targets, the Jews, at the forefront.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
But Chaplin gives neither Hitler nor the Nazis even the dignity of being named.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
The German analog Adnoid Hinkel is not even given a language.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
The Great Dictator dictates in gibberish.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
But the Jews are given a name.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
The Great Dictator does not pussyfoot around about who, exactly, Adnoid Hinkel intends to exterminate.

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
The Jews are given a name and an identity, where Hitler is only alluded to.

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
A less well-known WWII-era comedy following in Chaplin's footsteps was Ernst Lubitsch's To Be or Not to Be,

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
which follows the exploits of Jews in occupied Warsaw.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
Mel Brooks loved this movie so much that he remade it in the 80s,

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
and that did not go over as well as the producers or Blazing Saddles.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
While The Great Dictator was a success, it was not without controversy,

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
with resistance against the film coming from isolationist Americans and fascist sympathizers.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
Despite the success of The Great Dictator, few in Hollywood dared follow in Chaplin's footsteps

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
by openly addressing Hitler's ideology.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
But this did not go on to start a trend of films that were terribly concerned with the plight of the Jews in Germany

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
and the rest of Europe because, believe it or not,

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
Americans weren't terribly sympathetic to the plight of the Jews in 1940.

11:55.000 --> 12:01.000
To put it in perspective, Americans are more receptive to the idea of welcoming Syrian refugees into America today

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
than they were Jewish refugees in 1939.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
There was a lot of WWII-themed media during and after the war,

12:08.000 --> 12:12.000
but not a whole lot followed in Chaplin's footsteps.

12:18.000 --> 12:24.000
In 1963, political theorist Hannah Arendt, herself a German Jew who fled the Reich during Hitler's rise to power,

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
reported on Adolf Eichmann's trial in Jerusalem in a series of essays for The New Yorker called

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Eichmann in Jerusalem, a report on the banality of evil.

12:32.000 --> 12:39.000
Eichmann, who was on trial for Nazi war crimes, showed no remorse and claimed no responsibility for what he had taken part in.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
He was remarkable for his unremarkability.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
The Israeli government sent no fewer than six psychologists to examine Eichmann,

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
none of whom found any trace of mental illness.

12:49.000 --> 12:55.000
Arendt's essays discredited the idea that Nazi criminals were psychopathic or different from normal people.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
As Eichmann saw it, he was just doing his job.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
He not only obeyed orders, he also obeyed the law.

13:03.000 --> 13:13.000
And then I maintain, in regard to the words discussed verbally, there was no place for discussions. These were orders.

13:13.000 --> 13:21.000
Eichmann proved that you do not have to be a born and bred monster to do monstrous things, that anyone was capable of this.

13:21.000 --> 13:27.000
Arendt's report, in addition to a wider cultural understanding in America of the breadth and scope of Hitler's atrocities,

13:27.000 --> 13:33.000
began to cause a shift in the American relationship with the mere idea of war, especially with the looming threat in Vietnam.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
Where earlier films about World War II seemed heroic and necessary,

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
this shift began to see such films' omissions of Hitler's atrocities as unpalatable.

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
There was a need to reconcile the humanity of the Nazis with their actions in order to continue making media about them.

13:47.000 --> 13:53.000
But the reality that evil is really quite banal did not make for compelling Hollywood cinema.

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
According to Barlow, the nature of evil itself, argues Hannah Arendt, is thought-defying,

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
because thought tries to reach some depth, to go to the roots, and the moment it concerns itself with evil,

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
it is frustrated because there is nothing. That is its banality.

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
In the two decades following the end of the war, a changing understanding of Hitler's atrocities

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
and their relationship to the American identity would shape the way that Nazis were portrayed in film.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
With regard to depicting the German Nazis seen by American film and culture,

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
Aaron Barlow outlines two phases, an initial one generated by the needs of war,

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
and a later one reacting to that earlier version.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
A major characteristic of that later phase reacting to that earlier phase

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
was the attempt to grapple with the unthinkable evil encompassed by the Holocaust.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
What about the rest of the world?

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
Did you not know the intentions of the Third Reich?

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
Did you not hear the words of Hitler's broadcast all over the world?

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
But an increasingly complex understanding of World War II, moving away from the machine of war

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
and moving towards the tragedy of the Holocaust,

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
begin to dampen American desires to see World War II portrayed on screen.

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
There's just no real glory in conquest when you know what those soldiers are going to discover

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
on the other side of those woods.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
So exit Best Years of Our Lives and Sands of Iwo Jima,

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
enter The Diary of Anne Frank, The Pawnbroker, and Judgment at Nuremberg.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
Where's the responsibility of the world leader Winston Churchill,

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
who said in an open letter to the London Times in 1938,

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
1938!

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Your Honor!

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Were England to suffer a national disaster,

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
I should pray to God to send a man of the strength of mind and will of an Adolf Hitler.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Are we now to find Winston Churchill guilty?

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
Part of the problem with attempts to come to terms with the unbelievable horrors of the Holocaust

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
also came to be an unwillingness to delve too deeply into the commonality of evil

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
that shows real negotiation with the American people's own culpability.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
Where's the responsibility of those American industrialists

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
who helped Hitler to rebuild his armaments

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
and profited by that rebuilding?

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
Aaron Barlow contends that Americans began to push away the questions raised,

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
turning the perpetrators into unhuman villains,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
into parodies of villainy,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
into something that we can live with,

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
for it becomes absolutely removed from us.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Hollywood's later approach would escalate to the likes of Steven Spielberg

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
adding literal supernatural element to a seemingly supernatural evil

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
in films like Raiders of the Lost Ark.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
We see this perhaps most explicitly with Captain America and Hydra,

16:28.000 --> 16:33.000
where the Red Skull is posed as making the Nazis look like the lesser evil compared to Hydra,

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
even though from their look to their occult inspiration,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
to their goals, to their goofy salute,

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
they are functionally identical to the Nazis.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Hang! Glider!

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Also, Holocaust won't Holocaust.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
But in the 1960s, at this still early stage in American identity

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
reconciling its relationship to the Holocaust,

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
the horrors were still too fresh for the kind of direct representation

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
we would see in the 90s and 2000s with the likes of Schindler's List,

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
The Pianist,

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
and Life is Beautiful.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Buongiorno, principessa!

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
Last night, I dreamt about you all night!

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Ugh.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Finding a way to keep World War II narratives relevant and sympathetic

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
was proving increasingly difficult in light of the new cultural concerns,

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
and as the war receded even further and further into the past,

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
and possibilities for spectacle reached their limit.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
Which is to say nothing about that other cloud hanging over the world at the time.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
That mushroom cloud.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
Doctor Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
according to Pauline Kael, opened a new movie era.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
Indeed, Strangelove seems to be where the switch flipped,

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
both in the wider culture's relationship to its past and to its doomed present,

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
in the film's own subtitle, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
And boy, you had to stop worrying and love the bomb in the 1960s just to live.

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
Like, today, we do not appreciate just how close we came several times to total nuclear war.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
It's kind of a miracle we still exist.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
The Nazi presence in Strangelove is more subtext than text,

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
with the titular Strangelove an implied former Nazi war criminal

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
who now works for the global nuclear war machine.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
Strangelove can store all the information about the war.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
The evil of the Nazi is almost trivial

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
when pitted against Cold War era global nuclear annihilation.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
The effect of this was not to trivialize Nazism,

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
but to give filmmakers new tools with which to explore the horrors both of their past,

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
their present, and an increasingly unlikely future.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
And if dark comedy and satire were used as a tool,

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
it would be a tool to make the world a better place.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
It would be a tool to make the world a better place.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
It would be a tool to make the world a better place.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
And if dark comedy and satire were used to come to terms with

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
the sort of Damocles hanging over the head of every American and Russian

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
and, well, everyone during the Cold War,

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
then so too could dark comedy be used to come to terms with

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
and explore the horrors of Hitler's Reich.

19:09.000 --> 19:14.000
If he opens his big mouth again, it's lampshade time!

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Shut up!

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
What? You written a book?

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
Yeah, it's like all my thoughts and stuff.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
It's called I'm Can.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Andrew Gross and Suzanne Rohr describe the problem of comedy

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
tackling heavy subject matters as a perception of comedy being

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
generally considered less sophisticated, read, incapable,

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
than the more so-called noble genres such as tragedy or conventional historical drama.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
Part of what makes a societal taboo a taboo is the presumption

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
that it should not be touched or discussed, even by higher arts,

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
much less lower arts like comedy.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
All right, Jay, it's time to show these people what black power is all about.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
You better put your hood on.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
This, of course, does not give comedy, particularly black comedy, its due credit.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
Black comedy is sometimes the best means for challenging

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
harmful societal constructs and mores.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
According to Aaron Barlow, comedy is most persuasive,

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
which is perhaps to say instructive,

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
when put in the morally realistic context of tragic potential.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
Thus, much of what is called black humor and its attendant obscenity

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
derives from the recognition that the truest fiction requires

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
fusion of the tragic and the comic.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
What do you think of Mr. Hilton's policies?

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
Well, I don't like the sound of these here boncentration bamps.

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
Well, I gave him my baby to kiss and he bit it.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
Farce allows obscenity to succeed or at least be dealt with.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
In situations where otherwise, audiences would be offended and even non-existent.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
Life's a piece of shit when you look at it.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
It could be argued that farce was not only inevitable,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
but necessary in order to prime audiences

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
for dealing with more realistic, somber portrayals in Holocaust fiction.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
When used smartly, comedy puts the unspeakable

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
into understandable symbols through absurdism,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
without dragging marginalized groups through the mud.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Through farce, the problems that were arising

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
within filmic presentations of the Nazi,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
problems arising from new recognition

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
that the simplistic diversions into good and bad

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
that had been useful for the war effort,

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
but that were of little real validity,

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
could be sidestepped.

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
Prima facie evil, the Nazi could always be insulted and abused.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
Or, turned around, the Nazi can lose without sympathy.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
This turn to farce allowed World War II film to survive,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
even as aspects of it that now seemed troubling

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
began to fade from the genre.

21:31.000 --> 21:38.000
The late 1960s also saw a rise in films

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
that took a more farcical bent to approaching Hitler's regime,

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
including The Dirty Dozen, Hogan's Heroes, Catch-22,

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
and, of course, The Producers.

21:48.000 --> 21:57.000
And now it's springtime for Hitler and Germany.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
The Producers tells the story of Max Bialystock,

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
played by Zero Mostel,

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
a washed-up hack Broadway producer

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
who talks Leopold Blum, played by Gene Wilder,

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
a mousy, emasculated accountant who seeks comfort in his blanket

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
You're making me extremely nervous.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
into creating an intentional Broadway flop

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
in order to ride off the business losses

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
and steal the money from the financiers.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
But when the worst show they can find,

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
springtime for Hitler,

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
a gay romp with Adolf and Eva through Burt Scott,

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
becomes an unexpected success,

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
the two end up in prison.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
One of the studios Brooks initially approached

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
said that they would make The Producers

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
if and only if Brooks changed it to springtime for Mussolini.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Why was it universal?

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
Because they said Hitler is too strong, too menacing.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
How about springtime for Mussolini?

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Given that Mussolini's depiction in American media

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
in comparison to Hitler

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
seemed mostly to be about making fun of fascism

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
and being BFFs with Hitler,

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
while not having to get our hands dirty

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
with that whole Holocaust thing.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
And when we talk about The Producers now,

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
especially as a defense of a joke about...

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
whatever,

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
one facet of the gestation of The Producers

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
is that it was actually pretty controversial

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
upon initial release.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Time has been kinder to The Producers

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
than critics were in 1968.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
The Busby Berkeley musical centerpiece

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Springtime for Hitler

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
caused considerable offense,

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
prompting numerous, mostly Jewish, walkouts

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
during the film's initial release.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
In Brooks' own words,

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
the Jews were horrified.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I received resentful letters of protest

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
saying things like,

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
how can you make jokes about Hitler?

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
The man murdered six million Jews.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
It was only after Peter Sellers

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
gave the film a glowing public endorsement in Variety

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
that the film gradually built up a cult audience

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
and Brooks eventually won an Academy Award

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
for Best Original Screenplay for The Producers.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
But while the joke in the film

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
is that Bialystock had found

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
the most offensive musical possible,

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
guaranteeing a flop in his mind...

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
It's practically a love letter to Hitler.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
This won't run a week.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
A week? Are you kidding?

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
This play has got to close on page four.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Brooks' use of Hitler as its subject

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
was not arbitrary.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
In Brooks' own words,

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
of course it is impossible to take revenge

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
for six million murdered Jews,

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
but by using the medium of comedy,

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
we can try to rob Hitler of his posthumous power and myth.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
Hitler must have had a magnetic, attractive force.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Like a rock star,

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
he used his voice to spellbind umpteen thousands of listeners,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
so it's only fitting when comic actors

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
make him the limelight hog of world history.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
We take away from him the holy seriousness

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
that always surrounded him

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
and protected him like a cordon.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Brooks later stated in an interview at 60 Minutes,

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
there is only one way to get even with Hitler.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
You have to bring him down with ridicule.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Though The Producers was initially met with mixed reviews,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
the film has since become celebrated

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
for the way it ridicules fascism

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
in the same vein as Chaplin's The Great Dictator,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
particularly Springtime for Hitler.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Film historian Robert Reimer celebrates springtime

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
as a triumph of anti-fascist satire.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Susan Gubar interprets this parody of fascism

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
as racial camp mocking the shoddy theatricality of fascism.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Both Gubar and Reimer side with Brooks

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
in their interpretation of the springtime number.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
That ridicule of Nazi propaganda methods

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
does rob Hitler of some of his posthumous power.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
But again, this praise of The Producers is not universal.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Film historian Petra Rau

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
takes a much colder view on The Producers.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
In addition to finding many of the comedic elements

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
thoughtless and hypocritical,

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Talk about bad taste!

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Like, what did these people expect

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
in a musical called Springtime for Hitler?

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
She particularly takes issue with Brooks' appropriation

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
of fascist imagery.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
There is one frame during the Springtime for Hitler number

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
wherein the dancers move to form a swastika on the stage,

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
a direct reference to Leni Riefenstahl

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
doing the same in Nazi propaganda.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Rau argues that the tools of fascist theatricality

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
are not shoddy, as Brooks describes,

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
and are rather highly effective propaganda tools.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
That's why they worked.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Merely recreating the tools of fascism

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
in a heightened, cartoonish state

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
is not enough to create satisfying satire.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
And in that way, Brooks' use of Hitler

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
can feel almost incidental.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
Really, making a play about the most offensive thing imaginable

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
could have been about anything,

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
since the butt of the joke is really Bialystock and Bloom

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
underestimating the audience, not Hitler himself.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
So the question then becomes,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
where does satire cross the line

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
from being a valid, transgressive art

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
that challenges harmful societal constructs

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
to too subtle and perhaps in danger

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
of people missing the point entirely?

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
And that's the problem.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
There isn't a line.

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
This is a journey into money.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Loads of money.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
There is an episode of Malcolm Gladwell's podcast,

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
Revisionist History, which is called The Satire Paradox,

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
which, with apologies, I will borrow from a great deal here.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
Oi, you! Shut your mouth and look at my wad!

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
The episode begins with a discussion on Harry Enfield,

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
a well-known comedian in Britain

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
and also an avowed leftist who hated Margaret Thatcher.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
No, Nigel, no. Bad dog, Nigel.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Enfield and his partner Paul Whitehouse

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
dreamt up a character to embody Thatcher's England.

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
And it sort of just became this sort of thing, really,

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
where we'd just go loads of money about everything, you know.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
His name was Loads of Money.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
He was a construction worker

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
who was subjected to sudden delirious wealth

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
by the 80s building boom.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
So we sort of did it the other way,

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
which is just to go, look at me, aren't I great?

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
Isn't money great? Everything else is rubbish.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Only money is good.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
But the lesson Enfield took from the whole thing was,

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
despite the clear derision with which Loads of Money was framed,

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
people only took it as it was intended

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
if they already were aligned with Enfield politically.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
You know, I mean, it's great fun to do,

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
but generally, you know, it's just about questioning what's there

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
because we're allowed to question what's there, so we do.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
But it doesn't ever change anyone's mind.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Same with Stephen Colbert.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
The real Colbert has never made a secret

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
of the fact that he holds liberal political views in real life.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
Everybody's been saying, has America lost its mind?

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
And the answer is, evidently, back off, buddy.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
We got 300 million guns and we're kind of stressed right now.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
But conservative viewers of The Colbert Report

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
don't see his character the same way liberal viewers do.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
Yes, obviously, the Colbert of The Colbert Report was a character,

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
but where the left-leaning viewer sees a character to be mocked...

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
I'm sorry, I've never been a fan of books.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
I don't trust them.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
...the conservative-leaning viewer

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
sees a funny man speaking truth to power.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
I think I would have made a fabulous press secretary.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
I have nothing but contempt for these people.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
So essentially, they saw what they wanted to see.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
So the big takeaway here of this study was

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
that this is what we would call

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
motivated cognition, or biased perception.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
See also Tina Fey's Sarah Palin.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
I can see Russia from my house.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
LAUGHTER

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
This character might have been made by and for liberals,

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
but Palin was just so darn likable

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
that conservatives who supported Palin

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
were endeared to it too.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Tina Fey even went on to make an episode of 30 Rock

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
about this very paradox.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
I'm gonna have to take a moment here.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
I sat on my testicles earlier

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
and the heft of my body smashed them to smithereens.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
OK, start working on the wig.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
The in-universe show's parody

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
of a dangerously inept political candidate

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
ends up making him more endearing.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Because it's making him likable.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
He's actually very mean.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
But with Tracy Jordan playing him...

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
He's a lovable buffoon.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
...they're just talking about how funny Tracy is.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
And Fey's character, Liz Lemon, is faced with the dilemma

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
of what to do with this.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
But these are all examples of deliberate satire.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
The issue gets even more thorny

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
when you look at representation that is not satire.

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
The white man marches on!

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
American History X is a great example

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
of the satire paradox for something that is not satire.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
The text of the film

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
is explicitly anti-fascist.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
A cautionary tale that unmistakably

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
condemns white supremacy.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
But you know what group loves the imagery

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
in American History X?

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Neo-Nazis.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Neo-Nazis love the imagery in this movie.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
The text shows neo-nazism

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
and white supremacy is bad.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Isn't it also kind of badass?

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Isn't it kind of cool

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
the way he's framed?

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Isn't Edward Norton a badass when he's an

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
uncucked neo-nazi alpha?

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
And then there's Hans Landa

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
from Inglourious Basterds

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
who has become more of a symbol for fun

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
and charm and charisma

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
than of evil.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Ooh, that's a bingo!

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
And you might argue that

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
that's the point.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
But what is that point if what people remember most

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
about the movie is how fun the evil nazi was?

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Audiences might have lost the thread

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
of the intended point.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
And then there's Tomorrow Belongs to Me

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
a chilling moment from the film version of Cabaret

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
which has recently been adopted by some white nationalists

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
as an anthem.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
But do you know what hasn't?

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
So we have explicitly anti-fascist dramas

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
where the text has been appropriated

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
by white supremacists,

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
but in this case the comedy,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
which satirically praises Hitler,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
has not.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Which lends credence to Brooks' notion that

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
highlighting the absurdism of fascist theatricality

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
actually does rob Hitler of his posthumous power.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
But just because you can't help

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
what the world will do with your representation,

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
be it satirical or non-satirical,

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
it doesn't mean that satire

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
is free from criticism.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Satire needs intent,

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
it needs logic,

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
it needs to be making a statement

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
about the thing it is satirizing,

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
or else it's bad satire.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Brooks describes this as satire

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
of the shoddy theatrics of fascism.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
To Rao's credit, the theatrical techniques

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
of fascism were highly effective,

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
but they were also extremely fragile,

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
which is why the police state

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
maintained such a stranglehold on the press.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
You weren't allowed to ridicule fascism in Nazi Germany

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
because its theatricality, at its core,

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
could not survive ridicule.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
This is what hyper-nationalism looks like.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Women dressed as pretzels and beer.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
This is what Nazi theatricality looks like.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Tap-dancing stormtroopers

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
and marching in swastika formation.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
That image is lifted directly from Nazi propaganda,

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
and it doesn't take a lot of modification

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
to make it look ridiculous.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
See, this particular scene is all about lens.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
The Nazi vision in the producers

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
is a text written by a literal Nazi,

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
produced through a Jewish lens

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
for a Gentile audience.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
The story, the framing,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
and who is telling the story

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
is all relevant.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
So this isn't just Hitler for Hitler's sake.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
It's a theatricality that unmistakably showcases

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
the absurdity of ethno-nationalism.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Which is why white nationalists

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
tend not to like it in the way

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
that they like American history acts.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
You can't make it not absurd.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
So the idea that Brooks wanted to make a musical

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
out of the most offensive thing

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
and just kind of picked Nazis at random is false.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Brooks had something to say about the Nazis,

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
about the way they viewed themselves,

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
and the way they presented themselves to the world.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
But this also rubs up against that satire paradox.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Perhaps the intended target of the satire

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
goes missed by a large portion of the audience.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Man, you know, I kind of miss the days

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
when it was, like, taken as a given

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
by most people that a joke

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
at the expense of Hitler

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
isn't the same as a joke

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
at the expense of millions of murdered Jews.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
But, you know,

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
the times, they are a-changin',

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
and that's a discussion that needs to be had.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Hail Trump! Hail our people!

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Hail victory!

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Given the rise of far-right movements,

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
fascism, and neo-Nazism in the last two years

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
all over the Western world,

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
much debate has arisen as to the ethical concerns

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
of laughing at the devil, as Brooks has done.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Do films like the producers rob Nazis of their power,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
or do they create an atmosphere

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
that encourages audiences not to take

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
a serious issue seriously?

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
It is fallacious to say

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
that the answer to that question

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
is either or. It's a little of

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
column A, and a little of column B.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
The seriousness of the Holocaust

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
was not lost on Brooks, and according to Brooks,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
all comedy must have limits

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
and intent. In the Spiegel interview,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Brooks says,

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
The philosophy of the film is,

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
people can get over anything.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
No, they can't.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
They can't get over a concentration camp.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
So where does Brooks draw the line?

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
In 1974,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
I produced the Western parody

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Blazing Saddles, he continues,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
in which the N-word was used constantly.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
I've got it!

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
I've got it!

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
I've got it!

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
The N-word was used constantly.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I've gotta talk to you. Come here.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Have you gone berserk? Can't you see that that man

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
is a n Gerot!

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
But I would never have thought of the

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
idea of showing how a black was lynched.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
It's only funny when he escapes

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
getting sent to the gallows.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Oh baby.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
You are so talented.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
And they are so dumb.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
And there's been a lot of debate

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
as to whether or not Brooks' liberal use

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
of the N-word in Blazing Saddles is helpful

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
or harmful, and I'm not going to go into that today.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Good morning, ma'am.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
And isn't it a lovely

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
morning?

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Up your a**.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
But the point here is

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Brooks believes that not all

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
comedic targets are created equal.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Ah, prairie shit.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Everybody.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Comedy is by its very nature

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
transgressive, and borders and norms do

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
need to be challenged, even surrounding

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
such sensitive topics as the Holocaust.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
But in order to be effective,

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
that transgression must be used

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
carefully and with intent.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
The offense bar is also

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
much higher now, unlike with the original film

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
which caused a flurry of controversy,

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
when the Broadway show and subsequently

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
the adaptation of the musical got released,

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
these barely got an indifferent shrug on the issue

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
of depiction of Nazis. By this point,

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
even moms don't find it edgy.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
We're in a post-South Park world,

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
a post-Family Guy world,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
a post-Downfall meme world.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
So perhaps Hitler

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
is too powerless, and when people

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
express concerns about literal Nazis

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
or Nazi-adjacent useful idiots,

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
applause

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
The responses

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
become, why do you have to call

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
everyone you disagree with a Nazi?

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
But this cartoonization of Nazism

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
is also a sign of changing times,

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
just like The Producers was a sign of

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
changing times in 1967.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
And I'm not even saying that that's

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
a bad thing, but it is

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
having an effect on the way that we treat our

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
history. Media like South Park

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
reinforces a worldview where nothing really

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
matters and everything is fair game.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
And South Park has historically gotten away with this

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
because the message and intent is clear.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
But South Park's imitators seem not to understand

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
why South Park gets away with transgressive humor

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
with relatively little blowback,

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
and they don't. How is

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
your representation framed? Is it

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
romantic? Or is it derisive?

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Or is it comedic?

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
And most importantly, at whose

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
expense is the joke?

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
All humor

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
is based on some form of transgression.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Even a pie in the

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
face is a very

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
tiny, tiny societal transgression.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
I'm not saying don't

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
transgress, and I'm not saying

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
societal mores and constructs

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
don't need to be challenged. However,

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
if you are going to make a

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
joke at the expense of a

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
historically shat upon group that is not

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
your own, you need to accept also

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
that there might be consequences, and

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
people might not think you're funny.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
1. There is no such thing as

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
equal opportunity offensive because not

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
all groups exist on equal footing.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Maybe one day. Probably never.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
But right now, we are nowhere

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
near that. Brooks cited the near lynching of

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Bart in Blazing Saddles as a line he would not

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
cross. There is nothing funny about the image

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
of a black man being lynched, and Brooks owns

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
the fact that he, a white Jewish comedian,

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
has no business depicting the

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
image of a black man being lynched used for

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
comedy. 2. Brooks is

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
not down with Gentiles appropriating Jewish

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
suffering and genocide, let alone

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
shocking for shocking's sake. And ridiculing

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Hitler's theatricality is not the

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
same thing as making a joke about Jewish

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
genocide. It's just

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
not. Mel Brooks is a 91

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
year old man. He spends a lot of time

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
these days going on tour and jumping

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
around on stage doing interviews talking about what

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
a great guy Gene Wilder was, and

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
I hope he keeps doing that.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
It was such a wonderful part of my life.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
I hope he spends his twilight years

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
reflecting on his successes and doesn't

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
find out that a very large portion of the

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Gentile internet is using him as a defense

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
for why Gentiles making anti-Semitic jokes

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
is really okay because all

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
satire is created equal.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Look at the producers, even if you only

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
call it satire after the fact because your joke

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
didn't land. So yeah, you can totally

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
joke about whatever. For the time being,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
free speech is the law of the land.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
But if you're looking for a defense for your edgelord

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
satire, maybe the Jewish man who

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
served in Germany during World War II

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
who has publicly spoken out against media

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
that trivializes the suffering of the Holocaust

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
who has stated several times

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
that there are lines that should not be crossed

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
out of respect for oppressed groups

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
who has maintained that comedy is a weapon

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
and even owing to the fact that you will fuck up

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
its targets should be considered

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
with caution and care and never with the intent

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
of upholding unjust power structures

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
rather than dismantling them.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Maybe this guy

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
this guy is not

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
your best defense.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
You gotta know

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
is everything

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
is showbiz

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
I'll myself

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
watch

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
my show

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
I'm the German Ethel Merman, don't you know

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
We are crossing

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
borders, the New World Order

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
is here
