0	13200	So, um, I've been seeing, um, a lot of people recently using Mel Brooks as a sort of blanket defense of any kind of, you know, satire that transgresses societal taboos.
13200	20000	Um, and, you know, this is nothing new. I've been seeing, uh, Mel Brooks used in this way for decades.
20000	26000	You couldn't make a Mel Brooks movie today
26000	30000	Cause I saw Blazing Saddles yesterday
30000	38000	But the, um, the problem with that line of thinking is, uh, it misunderstands what made Mel Brooks great.
38000	42000	What makes him resonate. So today, we're gonna talk about Mel Brooks.
42000	44000	The year was 2004.
44000	46000	Are you gonna eat your tots?
46000	52000	The United States had just invaded Iraq. The Black Eyed Peas were getting retarded in here.
52000	56000	Let's get retarded. Let's get retarded in here.
56000	58000	Zach Braff was at his artistic peak.
58000	61000	Blah blah blah blah blah.
61000	64000	And The Producers was still one of the hottest tickets on Broadway.
64000	68000	Stand alone, stand behind me.
68000	74000	Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick had returned to the roles which they had originated, which had netted a then record-breaking 12 Tonys.
74000	79000	Student Rush tickets were really cheap back then, so I was seeing every musical that I could on Broadway.
79000	87000	But to this day, I have never laughed harder at any stage production than at that original cast of Mel Brooks' The Producers in 2004.
87000	94000	Come on Germans, go into your dance.
94000	100000	And if you've only seen the movie adaptation of the stage musical, you might be wondering, really?
100000	102000	Work, work, work. Work, work, work.
102000	104000	And, yes.
104000	108000	I can't even really explain what was lost in translation in the movie adaptation of the musical.
108000	110000	It's functionally identical.
110000	116000	Perhaps too identical, because everything that made it work on stage, it just doesn't work on film.
116000	119000	They come here, they all come here.
119000	122000	How do they find me?
122000	126000	That the aesthetics of breaking the fourth wall on film are just different than on stage.
126000	129000	Why bloom go so far, camera right?
129000	134000	The stage musical is also a big love letter to the heydays of the 40s and 50s musical pageantry,
134000	136000	and the world of the stage in general.
136000	138000	We all love this thing called the theater.
138000	143000	The movie version either did not know how to capture this, or did not care to capture this on film.
143000	151000	But maybe it's just being in the same room with these world-class trained showgirls tap dancing in stormtrooper outfits is just hilarious.
151000	155000	We're on screen, it's like, it just feels tired.
155000	158000	It feels like we've been here before.
159000	161000	That is why they call me Rolf.
163000	166000	Don't be stupid, be a smarty, come and join the Nazi party.
166000	171000	So if you guys want to talk about Mel Brooks and where, when, and how he was a comedy innovator,
171000	174000	then let's talk about Mel Brooks.
178000	182000	Mel Brooks was born Melvin Kaminsky in Brooklyn, New York in 1926.
182000	187000	His father died when he was two, and the youngest of four boys, he was a small sickly kid who got picked on a lot.
187000	194000	Brooks would later go on to say that this was where he learned to use comedy as a defense mechanism, to cloak his pain in humor.
194000	200000	I want to thank Hitler for being such a funny guy on stage.
200000	203000	Mel Brooks would also like you to know that he is a Jew.
203000	207000	Jews in space!
207000	213000	Behind me you see a phalanx, an avalanche of Jews who have come with their...
213000	217000	We're Jews out in space.
217000	221000	We're zooming along, protecting the Hebrew race.
221000	223000	I don't like the way you're walking.
223000	226000	You've been into the sacramental wine again.
226000	230000	Then go and attack us.
230000	233000	We'll give them a smack, we'll slap them right back in the face.
234000	241000	After serving as a corporal in World War II in Germany, engaging in such operations as defusing landmines,
241000	244000	Brooks was hired by Sid Caesar to be a television comedy writer.
244000	248000	It was during this period as a television writer that Brooks developed his comedy ethos,
248000	252000	which is basically throw everything at the wall and see what sticks.
252000	255000	Halt!
255000	259000	Du hast gespritzt eine General?
259000	263000	You see this in his most popular movies. It's just joke after joke after joke.
263000	267000	If there is a dud, there is hardly time for it to land before the next joke starts.
267000	269000	Well, that's the end of this suit.
269000	274000	So while Brooks definitely had an ethos, biases, and a point of view in his comedy,
274000	280000	the rapid-fire nature of it kind of make it clear that he didn't think through the implications of a lot of it.
280000	287000	You've just entered the territory of Robin Hood and his merry men.
287000	290000	Fagolith?
290000	293000	No, no, no. We're straight. Just merry.
293000	296000	Some of Brooks' comedy, with gay characters in particular, has aged poorly.
296000	299000	While Brooks was certainly not averse to physical comedy and slapstick,
299000	303000	Fag! Fag! Fagol! Fagol!
303000	307000	his bread-and-butter tended to rest more on transgression of societal taboos.
307000	309000	Some of it has aged well.
309000	312000	Come on. How about a good ol' motherfucker work song?
312000	320000	I get no kick from champagne.
320000	321000	Some of it has not.
321000	324000	Watch me faggot!
324000	328000	And here's why that doesn't bother me personally as a viewer.
328000	333000	Comedy is the quickest to age and the most likely to age poorly.
333000	337000	Yes, some of it, even a lot of it, is problematic.
337000	340000	Yes, you can still enjoy it. I do.
340000	345000	His 1974 film Blazing Saddles is one of the great transgressive comedies of all time.
345000	351000	Here we take the good time and trouble to slaughter every last Indian in the West, and for what?
351000	356000	So they can appoint a sheriff that's blacker than any Indian.
356000	361000	From top to bottom, Blazing Saddles is a razor-sharp skewering of the absurdity of racism.
361000	364000	These are people of the land.
364000	369000	The common clay of the New West.
369000	372000	You know.
372000	374000	Morons.
374000	382000	And this is part of what makes Brooks so fondly remembered today, where the likes of, say, David Zucker are kind of sad.
382000	386000	Well, people still think airplane is funny, so there's that.
386000	388000	I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.
388000	393000	As an outgrowth from his difficult childhood, Brooks wasn't just about comedy for comedy's sake.
393000	395000	Comedy could be a weapon.
395000	399000	And one of Brooks' favorite targets happened to be history's greatest monster.
399000	401000	Hitler on ice!
405000	412000	Brooks saw comedy not just as a weapon of ridicule, but as a way of robbing Hitler of his posthumous power.
412000	417000	Brooks' approach of reducto ad absurdum to Nazis was a catharsis for Jewish identity.
417000	419000	And this hardly started with Brooks.
419000	426000	Yiddish folklore is full of these trickster, Bugs Bunny-style characters who confront corrupt and unjust power structures using nothing but their wits,
426000	429000	Herschel Vostropol being one of the most well-known.
429000	430000	The Inquisition!
430000	431000	Look out, Sam!
431000	436000	We have a mission to convert the Jews!
436000	439000	Brooks' subjects also weren't limited to Nazi violence against the Jews.
439000	442000	Take one of the more famous scenes from History of the World, Part 1.
442000	446000	It's better to lose your skullcap than your skull!
446000	447000	Or your guvalt!
447000	453000	There you have Brooks' own filmmaking light of a period of history that, while nowhere near the Holocaust in terms of scale,
453000	456000	still openly targeted Jewish citizens.
456000	463000	And it's debatable how mining Jewish suffering, even if you are Jewish, for comedy in the Spanish Inquisition differs from the Holocaust,
463000	465000	which Brooks has always avoided depicting directly.
465000	469000	But he has also gone on record as saying that the root of a lot of his humor is anger,
469000	471000	specifically anger at anti-Semitism.
473000	478000	The problem with this kind of media, created by a Jew as an expression of Jewish identity,
478000	483000	to be consumed largely, however, by a Gentile audience is that
483000	489000	the Goliath will always watch you, watch you, watch you, watch you, watch you, watch you.
489000	501000	And there's a little bit of troubling history of things that Jews say and do being misrepresented and used against them.
501000	513000	Let's go back now, way back, back before Brooks, to what laid the groundwork for Springtime for Hitler,
513000	516000	to even survive and thrive in the first place.
516000	520000	Yes, let's go back to the big H in question.
523000	528000	Film about World War II was box office gold before the United States even entered the war,
528000	534000	and most everything that came out during that time glorified the war machine just as much as anything Germany was sharting out.
534000	539000	Film and literature about the war were used to boost a narrative of American exceptionalism and greatness.
539000	540000	According to Thomas Doherty,
549000	553000	But while this American ascendancy was fueled by images of the machine of war,
553000	559000	little confronted the actual ideology of fascism or the true horrors perpetrated in the name of Hitler's Reich.
559000	563000	One of the earliest and most well-known examples of satirizing Hitler's brand of fascism
563000	566000	came in the form of Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator.
566000	571000	A huge chunk of The Great Dictator is a very surreal watch today.
571000	578000	It consists of cute, wacky hijinks in the Jewish ghetto in the fictional country of Thomania.
578000	584000	See, concentration camps were certainly a thing in 1940, and it was a thing Americans knew about.
593000	596000	But the scope of it was not the scope we know today.
596000	604000	The Great Dictator was made in a time when Hitler's death machine was only a possibility and not a historical reality.
604000	607000	The Great Dictator is unique not only in that it confronts Hitler's ideology,
608000	620000	But that it also puts Hitler's biggest targets, the Jews, at the forefront.
628000	634000	But Chaplin gives neither Hitler nor the Nazis even the dignity of being named.
634000	638000	The German analog Adnoid Hinkel is not even given a language.
638000	642000	The Great Dictator dictates in gibberish.
649000	651000	But the Jews are given a name.
651000	656000	The Great Dictator does not pussyfoot around about who, exactly, Adnoid Hinkel intends to exterminate.
656000	661000	The Jews are given a name and an identity, where Hitler is only alluded to.
665000	671000	A less well-known WWII-era comedy following in Chaplin's footsteps was Ernst Lubitsch's To Be or Not to Be,
671000	674000	which follows the exploits of Jews in occupied Warsaw.
674000	677000	Mel Brooks loved this movie so much that he remade it in the 80s,
677000	681000	and that did not go over as well as the producers or Blazing Saddles.
686000	689000	While The Great Dictator was a success, it was not without controversy,
690000	694000	with resistance against the film coming from isolationist Americans and fascist sympathizers.
694000	699000	Despite the success of The Great Dictator, few in Hollywood dared follow in Chaplin's footsteps
699000	701000	by openly addressing Hitler's ideology.
701000	706000	But this did not go on to start a trend of films that were terribly concerned with the plight of the Jews in Germany
706000	710000	and the rest of Europe because, believe it or not,
710000	715000	Americans weren't terribly sympathetic to the plight of the Jews in 1940.
715000	721000	To put it in perspective, Americans are more receptive to the idea of welcoming Syrian refugees into America today
721000	724000	than they were Jewish refugees in 1939.
724000	728000	There was a lot of WWII-themed media during and after the war,
728000	732000	but not a whole lot followed in Chaplin's footsteps.
738000	744000	In 1963, political theorist Hannah Arendt, herself a German Jew who fled the Reich during Hitler's rise to power,
744000	749000	reported on Adolf Eichmann's trial in Jerusalem in a series of essays for The New Yorker called
749000	752000	Eichmann in Jerusalem, a report on the banality of evil.
752000	759000	Eichmann, who was on trial for Nazi war crimes, showed no remorse and claimed no responsibility for what he had taken part in.
759000	762000	He was remarkable for his unremarkability.
762000	766000	The Israeli government sent no fewer than six psychologists to examine Eichmann,
766000	769000	none of whom found any trace of mental illness.
769000	775000	Arendt's essays discredited the idea that Nazi criminals were psychopathic or different from normal people.
775000	778000	As Eichmann saw it, he was just doing his job.
778000	782000	He not only obeyed orders, he also obeyed the law.
783000	793000	And then I maintain, in regard to the words discussed verbally, there was no place for discussions. These were orders.
793000	801000	Eichmann proved that you do not have to be a born and bred monster to do monstrous things, that anyone was capable of this.
801000	807000	Arendt's report, in addition to a wider cultural understanding in America of the breadth and scope of Hitler's atrocities,
807000	813000	began to cause a shift in the American relationship with the mere idea of war, especially with the looming threat in Vietnam.
813000	817000	Where earlier films about World War II seemed heroic and necessary,
817000	822000	this shift began to see such films' omissions of Hitler's atrocities as unpalatable.
822000	827000	There was a need to reconcile the humanity of the Nazis with their actions in order to continue making media about them.
827000	833000	But the reality that evil is really quite banal did not make for compelling Hollywood cinema.
833000	838000	According to Barlow, the nature of evil itself, argues Hannah Arendt, is thought-defying,
838000	844000	because thought tries to reach some depth, to go to the roots, and the moment it concerns itself with evil,
844000	849000	it is frustrated because there is nothing. That is its banality.
849000	854000	In the two decades following the end of the war, a changing understanding of Hitler's atrocities
854000	859000	and their relationship to the American identity would shape the way that Nazis were portrayed in film.
859000	862000	With regard to depicting the German Nazis seen by American film and culture,
862000	867000	Aaron Barlow outlines two phases, an initial one generated by the needs of war,
867000	870000	and a later one reacting to that earlier version.
872000	876000	A major characteristic of that later phase reacting to that earlier phase
876000	880000	was the attempt to grapple with the unthinkable evil encompassed by the Holocaust.
880000	882000	What about the rest of the world?
884000	887000	Did you not know the intentions of the Third Reich?
888000	892000	Did you not hear the words of Hitler's broadcast all over the world?
892000	896000	But an increasingly complex understanding of World War II, moving away from the machine of war
896000	899000	and moving towards the tragedy of the Holocaust,
899000	903000	begin to dampen American desires to see World War II portrayed on screen.
903000	908000	There's just no real glory in conquest when you know what those soldiers are going to discover
908000	910000	on the other side of those woods.
910000	913000	So exit Best Years of Our Lives and Sands of Iwo Jima,
913000	918000	enter The Diary of Anne Frank, The Pawnbroker, and Judgment at Nuremberg.
918000	921000	Where's the responsibility of the world leader Winston Churchill,
921000	925000	who said in an open letter to the London Times in 1938,
925000	928000	1938!
928000	930000	Your Honor!
930000	932000	Were England to suffer a national disaster,
932000	937000	I should pray to God to send a man of the strength of mind and will of an Adolf Hitler.
938000	940000	Are we now to find Winston Churchill guilty?
940000	944000	Part of the problem with attempts to come to terms with the unbelievable horrors of the Holocaust
944000	949000	also came to be an unwillingness to delve too deeply into the commonality of evil
949000	953000	that shows real negotiation with the American people's own culpability.
953000	956000	Where's the responsibility of those American industrialists
956000	959000	who helped Hitler to rebuild his armaments
959000	961000	and profited by that rebuilding?
961000	965000	Aaron Barlow contends that Americans began to push away the questions raised,
966000	968000	turning the perpetrators into unhuman villains,
968000	970000	into parodies of villainy,
970000	972000	into something that we can live with,
972000	975000	for it becomes absolutely removed from us.
975000	978000	Hollywood's later approach would escalate to the likes of Steven Spielberg
978000	982000	adding literal supernatural element to a seemingly supernatural evil
982000	984000	in films like Raiders of the Lost Ark.
984000	988000	We see this perhaps most explicitly with Captain America and Hydra,
988000	993000	where the Red Skull is posed as making the Nazis look like the lesser evil compared to Hydra,
993000	996000	even though from their look to their occult inspiration,
996000	998000	to their goals, to their goofy salute,
998000	1000000	they are functionally identical to the Nazis.
1002000	1003000	Hang! Glider!
1003000	1005000	Also, Holocaust won't Holocaust.
1005000	1008000	But in the 1960s, at this still early stage in American identity
1008000	1010000	reconciling its relationship to the Holocaust,
1010000	1014000	the horrors were still too fresh for the kind of direct representation
1014000	1017000	we would see in the 90s and 2000s with the likes of Schindler's List,
1021000	1022000	The Pianist,
1024000	1027000	and Life is Beautiful.
1027000	1029000	Buongiorno, principessa!
1029000	1033000	Last night, I dreamt about you all night!
1033000	1034000	Ugh.
1034000	1037000	Finding a way to keep World War II narratives relevant and sympathetic
1037000	1041000	was proving increasingly difficult in light of the new cultural concerns,
1041000	1044000	and as the war receded even further and further into the past,
1044000	1047000	and possibilities for spectacle reached their limit.
1047000	1051000	Which is to say nothing about that other cloud hanging over the world at the time.
1051000	1053000	That mushroom cloud.
1058000	1062000	Doctor Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,
1062000	1065000	according to Pauline Kael, opened a new movie era.
1065000	1068000	Indeed, Strangelove seems to be where the switch flipped,
1068000	1073000	both in the wider culture's relationship to its past and to its doomed present,
1073000	1077000	in the film's own subtitle, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.
1078000	1083000	And boy, you had to stop worrying and love the bomb in the 1960s just to live.
1083000	1089000	Like, today, we do not appreciate just how close we came several times to total nuclear war.
1089000	1091000	It's kind of a miracle we still exist.
1091000	1094000	The Nazi presence in Strangelove is more subtext than text,
1094000	1097000	with the titular Strangelove an implied former Nazi war criminal
1097000	1100000	who now works for the global nuclear war machine.
1100000	1104000	Strangelove can store all the information about the war.
1105000	1107000	The evil of the Nazi is almost trivial
1107000	1110000	when pitted against Cold War era global nuclear annihilation.
1110000	1113000	The effect of this was not to trivialize Nazism,
1113000	1117000	but to give filmmakers new tools with which to explore the horrors both of their past,
1117000	1120000	their present, and an increasingly unlikely future.
1120000	1123000	And if dark comedy and satire were used as a tool,
1123000	1126000	it would be a tool to make the world a better place.
1126000	1129000	It would be a tool to make the world a better place.
1129000	1132000	It would be a tool to make the world a better place.
1132000	1135000	And if dark comedy and satire were used to come to terms with
1135000	1138000	the sort of Damocles hanging over the head of every American and Russian
1138000	1141000	and, well, everyone during the Cold War,
1143000	1146000	then so too could dark comedy be used to come to terms with
1146000	1149000	and explore the horrors of Hitler's Reich.
1149000	1154000	If he opens his big mouth again, it's lampshade time!
1154000	1155000	Shut up!
1160000	1162000	What? You written a book?
1162000	1165000	Yeah, it's like all my thoughts and stuff.
1165000	1167000	It's called I'm Can.
1167000	1170000	Andrew Gross and Suzanne Rohr describe the problem of comedy
1170000	1173000	tackling heavy subject matters as a perception of comedy being
1173000	1177000	generally considered less sophisticated, read, incapable,
1177000	1182000	than the more so-called noble genres such as tragedy or conventional historical drama.
1182000	1185000	Part of what makes a societal taboo a taboo is the presumption
1185000	1189000	that it should not be touched or discussed, even by higher arts,
1189000	1192000	much less lower arts like comedy.
1192000	1196000	All right, Jay, it's time to show these people what black power is all about.
1196000	1198000	You better put your hood on.
1198000	1202000	This, of course, does not give comedy, particularly black comedy, its due credit.
1202000	1205000	Black comedy is sometimes the best means for challenging
1205000	1208000	harmful societal constructs and mores.
1208000	1211000	According to Aaron Barlow, comedy is most persuasive,
1211000	1213000	which is perhaps to say instructive,
1213000	1216000	when put in the morally realistic context of tragic potential.
1216000	1220000	Thus, much of what is called black humor and its attendant obscenity
1220000	1223000	derives from the recognition that the truest fiction requires
1223000	1225000	fusion of the tragic and the comic.
1225000	1227000	What do you think of Mr. Hilton's policies?
1227000	1231000	Well, I don't like the sound of these here boncentration bamps.
1231000	1236000	Well, I gave him my baby to kiss and he bit it.
1236000	1240000	Farce allows obscenity to succeed or at least be dealt with.
1240000	1244000	In situations where otherwise, audiences would be offended and even non-existent.
1244000	1248000	Life's a piece of shit when you look at it.
1248000	1251000	It could be argued that farce was not only inevitable,
1251000	1253000	but necessary in order to prime audiences
1253000	1257000	for dealing with more realistic, somber portrayals in Holocaust fiction.
1257000	1259000	When used smartly, comedy puts the unspeakable
1259000	1262000	into understandable symbols through absurdism,
1262000	1264000	without dragging marginalized groups through the mud.
1264000	1266000	Through farce, the problems that were arising
1266000	1268000	within filmic presentations of the Nazi,
1268000	1270000	problems arising from new recognition
1270000	1272000	that the simplistic diversions into good and bad
1272000	1274000	that had been useful for the war effort,
1274000	1276000	but that were of little real validity,
1276000	1277000	could be sidestepped.
1277000	1281000	Prima facie evil, the Nazi could always be insulted and abused.
1281000	1284000	Or, turned around, the Nazi can lose without sympathy.
1284000	1287000	This turn to farce allowed World War II film to survive,
1287000	1289000	even as aspects of it that now seemed troubling
1289000	1291000	began to fade from the genre.
1291000	1298000	The late 1960s also saw a rise in films
1298000	1301000	that took a more farcical bent to approaching Hitler's regime,
1301000	1305000	including The Dirty Dozen, Hogan's Heroes, Catch-22,
1305000	1308000	and, of course, The Producers.
1308000	1317000	And now it's springtime for Hitler and Germany.
1322000	1326000	The Producers tells the story of Max Bialystock,
1326000	1327000	played by Zero Mostel,
1327000	1329000	a washed-up hack Broadway producer
1329000	1332000	who talks Leopold Blum, played by Gene Wilder,
1332000	1335000	a mousy, emasculated accountant who seeks comfort in his blanket
1335000	1337000	You're making me extremely nervous.
1337000	1339000	into creating an intentional Broadway flop
1339000	1341000	in order to ride off the business losses
1341000	1343000	and steal the money from the financiers.
1343000	1345000	But when the worst show they can find,
1345000	1346000	springtime for Hitler,
1346000	1349000	a gay romp with Adolf and Eva through Burt Scott,
1349000	1350000	becomes an unexpected success,
1350000	1352000	the two end up in prison.
1352000	1354000	One of the studios Brooks initially approached
1354000	1356000	said that they would make The Producers
1356000	1359000	if and only if Brooks changed it to springtime for Mussolini.
1359000	1361000	Why was it universal?
1361000	1366000	Because they said Hitler is too strong, too menacing.
1366000	1369000	How about springtime for Mussolini?
1369000	1371000	Given that Mussolini's depiction in American media
1371000	1372000	in comparison to Hitler
1372000	1375000	seemed mostly to be about making fun of fascism
1375000	1377000	and being BFFs with Hitler,
1377000	1378000	while not having to get our hands dirty
1378000	1379000	with that whole Holocaust thing.
1379000	1381000	And when we talk about The Producers now,
1381000	1384000	especially as a defense of a joke about...
1384000	1385000	whatever,
1385000	1387000	one facet of the gestation of The Producers
1387000	1389000	is that it was actually pretty controversial
1389000	1390000	upon initial release.
1390000	1392000	Time has been kinder to The Producers
1392000	1394000	than critics were in 1968.
1394000	1396000	The Busby Berkeley musical centerpiece
1396000	1397000	Springtime for Hitler
1397000	1399000	caused considerable offense,
1399000	1401000	prompting numerous, mostly Jewish, walkouts
1401000	1403000	during the film's initial release.
1403000	1404000	In Brooks' own words,
1404000	1406000	the Jews were horrified.
1406000	1408000	I received resentful letters of protest
1408000	1409000	saying things like,
1409000	1411000	how can you make jokes about Hitler?
1411000	1413000	The man murdered six million Jews.
1413000	1414000	It was only after Peter Sellers
1414000	1417000	gave the film a glowing public endorsement in Variety
1417000	1419000	that the film gradually built up a cult audience
1419000	1421000	and Brooks eventually won an Academy Award
1421000	1424000	for Best Original Screenplay for The Producers.
1424000	1425000	But while the joke in the film
1425000	1427000	is that Bialystock had found
1427000	1429000	the most offensive musical possible,
1429000	1431000	guaranteeing a flop in his mind...
1431000	1433000	It's practically a love letter to Hitler.
1433000	1435000	This won't run a week.
1435000	1436000	A week? Are you kidding?
1436000	1439000	This play has got to close on page four.
1439000	1441000	Brooks' use of Hitler as its subject
1441000	1442000	was not arbitrary.
1442000	1443000	In Brooks' own words,
1443000	1445000	of course it is impossible to take revenge
1445000	1447000	for six million murdered Jews,
1447000	1448000	but by using the medium of comedy,
1448000	1451000	we can try to rob Hitler of his posthumous power and myth.
1451000	1454000	Hitler must have had a magnetic, attractive force.
1454000	1455000	Like a rock star,
1455000	1458000	he used his voice to spellbind umpteen thousands of listeners,
1458000	1460000	so it's only fitting when comic actors
1460000	1462000	make him the limelight hog of world history.
1462000	1464000	We take away from him the holy seriousness
1464000	1465000	that always surrounded him
1465000	1467000	and protected him like a cordon.
1467000	1469000	Brooks later stated in an interview at 60 Minutes,
1469000	1471000	there is only one way to get even with Hitler.
1471000	1473000	You have to bring him down with ridicule.
1476000	1478000	Though The Producers was initially met with mixed reviews,
1478000	1480000	the film has since become celebrated
1480000	1482000	for the way it ridicules fascism
1482000	1484000	in the same vein as Chaplin's The Great Dictator,
1484000	1486000	particularly Springtime for Hitler.
1486000	1488000	Film historian Robert Reimer celebrates springtime
1488000	1490000	as a triumph of anti-fascist satire.
1490000	1492000	Susan Gubar interprets this parody of fascism
1493000	1496000	as racial camp mocking the shoddy theatricality of fascism.
1496000	1498000	Both Gubar and Reimer side with Brooks
1498000	1500000	in their interpretation of the springtime number.
1500000	1502000	That ridicule of Nazi propaganda methods
1502000	1505000	does rob Hitler of some of his posthumous power.
1512000	1515000	But again, this praise of The Producers is not universal.
1515000	1516000	Film historian Petra Rau
1516000	1518000	takes a much colder view on The Producers.
1518000	1520000	In addition to finding many of the comedic elements
1520000	1521000	thoughtless and hypocritical,
1523000	1525000	Talk about bad taste!
1525000	1527000	Like, what did these people expect
1527000	1529000	in a musical called Springtime for Hitler?
1529000	1532000	She particularly takes issue with Brooks' appropriation
1532000	1533000	of fascist imagery.
1533000	1535000	There is one frame during the Springtime for Hitler number
1535000	1538000	wherein the dancers move to form a swastika on the stage,
1538000	1540000	a direct reference to Leni Riefenstahl
1540000	1542000	doing the same in Nazi propaganda.
1542000	1544000	Rau argues that the tools of fascist theatricality
1544000	1546000	are not shoddy, as Brooks describes,
1546000	1549000	and are rather highly effective propaganda tools.
1549000	1551000	That's why they worked.
1551000	1553000	Merely recreating the tools of fascism
1553000	1554000	in a heightened, cartoonish state
1554000	1557000	is not enough to create satisfying satire.
1557000	1559000	And in that way, Brooks' use of Hitler
1559000	1560000	can feel almost incidental.
1560000	1563000	Really, making a play about the most offensive thing imaginable
1563000	1565000	could have been about anything,
1565000	1567000	since the butt of the joke is really Bialystock and Bloom
1567000	1570000	underestimating the audience, not Hitler himself.
1570000	1571000	So the question then becomes,
1571000	1573000	where does satire cross the line
1573000	1576000	from being a valid, transgressive art
1576000	1578000	that challenges harmful societal constructs
1578000	1581000	to too subtle and perhaps in danger
1581000	1584000	of people missing the point entirely?
1584000	1586000	And that's the problem.
1586000	1588000	There isn't a line.
1588000	1592000	This is a journey into money.
1592000	1594000	Loads of money.
1594000	1596000	There is an episode of Malcolm Gladwell's podcast,
1596000	1599000	Revisionist History, which is called The Satire Paradox,
1599000	1603000	which, with apologies, I will borrow from a great deal here.
1603000	1606000	Oi, you! Shut your mouth and look at my wad!
1607000	1609000	The episode begins with a discussion on Harry Enfield,
1609000	1611000	a well-known comedian in Britain
1611000	1615000	and also an avowed leftist who hated Margaret Thatcher.
1615000	1618000	No, Nigel, no. Bad dog, Nigel.
1618000	1620000	Enfield and his partner Paul Whitehouse
1620000	1623000	dreamt up a character to embody Thatcher's England.
1623000	1627000	And it sort of just became this sort of thing, really,
1627000	1630000	where we'd just go loads of money about everything, you know.
1630000	1632000	His name was Loads of Money.
1632000	1634000	He was a construction worker
1634000	1636000	who was subjected to sudden delirious wealth
1636000	1638000	by the 80s building boom.
1638000	1640000	So we sort of did it the other way,
1640000	1642000	which is just to go, look at me, aren't I great?
1642000	1645000	Isn't money great? Everything else is rubbish.
1645000	1647000	Only money is good.
1651000	1654000	But the lesson Enfield took from the whole thing was,
1654000	1657000	despite the clear derision with which Loads of Money was framed,
1657000	1659000	people only took it as it was intended
1659000	1662000	if they already were aligned with Enfield politically.
1662000	1664000	You know, I mean, it's great fun to do,
1664000	1667000	but generally, you know, it's just about questioning what's there
1667000	1670000	because we're allowed to question what's there, so we do.
1670000	1672000	But it doesn't ever change anyone's mind.
1672000	1674000	Same with Stephen Colbert.
1674000	1676000	The real Colbert has never made a secret
1676000	1678000	of the fact that he holds liberal political views in real life.
1678000	1681000	Everybody's been saying, has America lost its mind?
1681000	1684000	And the answer is, evidently, back off, buddy.
1684000	1687000	We got 300 million guns and we're kind of stressed right now.
1687000	1689000	But conservative viewers of The Colbert Report
1689000	1692000	don't see his character the same way liberal viewers do.
1692000	1695000	Yes, obviously, the Colbert of The Colbert Report was a character,
1695000	1698000	but where the left-leaning viewer sees a character to be mocked...
1698000	1700000	I'm sorry, I've never been a fan of books.
1700000	1702000	I don't trust them.
1702000	1704000	...the conservative-leaning viewer
1704000	1706000	sees a funny man speaking truth to power.
1706000	1708000	I think I would have made a fabulous press secretary.
1708000	1710000	I have nothing but contempt for these people.
1710000	1712000	So essentially, they saw what they wanted to see.
1712000	1714000	So the big takeaway here of this study was
1714000	1716000	that this is what we would call
1716000	1719000	motivated cognition, or biased perception.
1719000	1721000	See also Tina Fey's Sarah Palin.
1721000	1723000	I can see Russia from my house.
1723000	1725000	LAUGHTER
1725000	1727000	This character might have been made by and for liberals,
1727000	1729000	but Palin was just so darn likable
1729000	1731000	that conservatives who supported Palin
1731000	1733000	were endeared to it too.
1733000	1735000	Tina Fey even went on to make an episode of 30 Rock
1735000	1737000	about this very paradox.
1737000	1739000	I'm gonna have to take a moment here.
1739000	1741000	I sat on my testicles earlier
1741000	1744000	and the heft of my body smashed them to smithereens.
1744000	1746000	OK, start working on the wig.
1746000	1748000	The in-universe show's parody
1748000	1750000	of a dangerously inept political candidate
1750000	1752000	ends up making him more endearing.
1752000	1754000	Because it's making him likable.
1754000	1756000	He's actually very mean.
1756000	1758000	But with Tracy Jordan playing him...
1758000	1760000	He's a lovable buffoon.
1760000	1762000	...they're just talking about how funny Tracy is.
1762000	1764000	And Fey's character, Liz Lemon, is faced with the dilemma
1764000	1766000	of what to do with this.
1766000	1768000	But these are all examples of deliberate satire.
1768000	1770000	The issue gets even more thorny
1770000	1772000	when you look at representation that is not satire.
1772000	1776000	The white man marches on!
1776000	1778000	American History X is a great example
1778000	1780000	of the satire paradox for something that is not satire.
1780000	1782000	The text of the film
1782000	1784000	is explicitly anti-fascist.
1784000	1786000	A cautionary tale that unmistakably
1786000	1788000	condemns white supremacy.
1788000	1790000	But you know what group loves the imagery
1790000	1792000	in American History X?
1792000	1794000	Neo-Nazis.
1794000	1796000	Neo-Nazis love the imagery in this movie.
1796000	1798000	The text shows neo-nazism
1798000	1800000	and white supremacy is bad.
1800000	1802000	Isn't it also kind of badass?
1802000	1804000	Isn't it kind of cool
1804000	1806000	the way he's framed?
1806000	1808000	Isn't Edward Norton a badass when he's an
1808000	1810000	uncucked neo-nazi alpha?
1810000	1812000	And then there's Hans Landa
1812000	1814000	from Inglourious Basterds
1814000	1816000	who has become more of a symbol for fun
1816000	1818000	and charm and charisma
1818000	1820000	than of evil.
1820000	1822000	Ooh, that's a bingo!
1824000	1826000	And you might argue that
1826000	1828000	that's the point.
1828000	1830000	But what is that point if what people remember most
1830000	1832000	about the movie is how fun the evil nazi was?
1832000	1834000	Audiences might have lost the thread
1834000	1836000	of the intended point.
1836000	1838000	And then there's Tomorrow Belongs to Me
1838000	1840000	a chilling moment from the film version of Cabaret
1848000	1850000	which has recently been adopted by some white nationalists
1850000	1852000	as an anthem.
1852000	1854000	But do you know what hasn't?
1854000	1856000	So we have explicitly anti-fascist dramas
1856000	1858000	where the text has been appropriated
1858000	1860000	by white supremacists,
1860000	1862000	but in this case the comedy,
1862000	1864000	which satirically praises Hitler,
1864000	1866000	has not.
1866000	1868000	Which lends credence to Brooks' notion that
1868000	1870000	highlighting the absurdism of fascist theatricality
1870000	1872000	actually does rob Hitler of his posthumous power.
1872000	1874000	But just because you can't help
1874000	1876000	what the world will do with your representation,
1876000	1878000	be it satirical or non-satirical,
1878000	1880000	it doesn't mean that satire
1880000	1882000	is free from criticism.
1882000	1884000	Satire needs intent,
1884000	1886000	it needs logic,
1886000	1888000	it needs to be making a statement
1888000	1890000	about the thing it is satirizing,
1890000	1892000	or else it's bad satire.
1898000	1900000	Brooks describes this as satire
1900000	1902000	of the shoddy theatrics of fascism.
1902000	1904000	To Rao's credit, the theatrical techniques
1904000	1906000	of fascism were highly effective,
1906000	1908000	but they were also extremely fragile,
1908000	1910000	which is why the police state
1910000	1912000	maintained such a stranglehold on the press.
1912000	1914000	You weren't allowed to ridicule fascism in Nazi Germany
1914000	1916000	because its theatricality, at its core,
1916000	1918000	could not survive ridicule.
1926000	1928000	This is what hyper-nationalism looks like.
1928000	1930000	Women dressed as pretzels and beer.
1930000	1932000	This is what Nazi theatricality looks like.
1932000	1934000	Tap-dancing stormtroopers
1934000	1936000	and marching in swastika formation.
1936000	1938000	That image is lifted directly from Nazi propaganda,
1938000	1940000	and it doesn't take a lot of modification
1940000	1942000	to make it look ridiculous.
1942000	1944000	See, this particular scene is all about lens.
1944000	1946000	The Nazi vision in the producers
1946000	1948000	is a text written by a literal Nazi,
1950000	1952000	produced through a Jewish lens
1952000	1954000	for a Gentile audience.
1958000	1960000	The story, the framing,
1960000	1962000	and who is telling the story
1962000	1964000	is all relevant.
1964000	1966000	So this isn't just Hitler for Hitler's sake.
1966000	1968000	It's a theatricality that unmistakably showcases
1968000	1970000	the absurdity of ethno-nationalism.
1974000	1976000	Which is why white nationalists
1976000	1978000	tend not to like it in the way
1978000	1980000	that they like American history acts.
1980000	1982000	You can't make it not absurd.
1988000	1990000	So the idea that Brooks wanted to make a musical
1990000	1992000	out of the most offensive thing
1992000	1994000	and just kind of picked Nazis at random is false.
1994000	1996000	Brooks had something to say about the Nazis,
1996000	1998000	about the way they viewed themselves,
1998000	2000000	and the way they presented themselves to the world.
2000000	2002000	But this also rubs up against that satire paradox.
2002000	2004000	Perhaps the intended target of the satire
2004000	2006000	goes missed by a large portion of the audience.
2006000	2008000	Man, you know, I kind of miss the days
2008000	2010000	when it was, like, taken as a given
2010000	2012000	by most people that a joke
2012000	2014000	at the expense of Hitler
2014000	2016000	isn't the same as a joke
2016000	2018000	at the expense of millions of murdered Jews.
2018000	2020000	But, you know,
2020000	2022000	the times, they are a-changin',
2022000	2024000	and that's a discussion that needs to be had.
2030000	2032000	Hail Trump! Hail our people!
2032000	2034000	Hail victory!
2036000	2038000	Given the rise of far-right movements,
2038000	2040000	fascism, and neo-Nazism in the last two years
2040000	2042000	all over the Western world,
2042000	2044000	much debate has arisen as to the ethical concerns
2044000	2046000	of laughing at the devil, as Brooks has done.
2046000	2048000	Do films like the producers rob Nazis of their power,
2048000	2050000	or do they create an atmosphere
2050000	2052000	that encourages audiences not to take
2052000	2054000	a serious issue seriously?
2058000	2060000	It is fallacious to say
2060000	2062000	that the answer to that question
2062000	2064000	is either or. It's a little of
2064000	2066000	column A, and a little of column B.
2066000	2068000	The seriousness of the Holocaust
2068000	2070000	was not lost on Brooks, and according to Brooks,
2070000	2072000	all comedy must have limits
2072000	2074000	and intent. In the Spiegel interview,
2074000	2076000	Brooks says,
2080000	2082000	The philosophy of the film is,
2082000	2084000	people can get over anything.
2084000	2086000	No, they can't.
2086000	2088000	They can't get over a concentration camp.
2088000	2090000	So where does Brooks draw the line?
2094000	2096000	In 1974,
2096000	2098000	I produced the Western parody
2098000	2100000	Blazing Saddles, he continues,
2100000	2102000	in which the N-word was used constantly.
2102000	2104000	I've got it!
2104000	2106000	I've got it!
2106000	2108000	I've got it!
2108000	2110000	The N-word was used constantly.
2110000	2112000	I've gotta talk to you. Come here.
2112000	2114000	Have you gone berserk? Can't you see that that man
2114000	2116000	is a n Gerot!
2116000	2118000	But I would never have thought of the
2118000	2120000	idea of showing how a black was lynched.
2120000	2122000	It's only funny when he escapes
2122000	2124000	getting sent to the gallows.
2124000	2126000	Oh baby.
2126000	2128000	You are so talented.
2128000	2130000	And they are so dumb.
2130000	2132000	And there's been a lot of debate
2132000	2134000	as to whether or not Brooks' liberal use
2134000	2136000	of the N-word in Blazing Saddles is helpful
2136000	2138000	or harmful, and I'm not going to go into that today.
2138000	2140000	Good morning, ma'am.
2140000	2142000	And isn't it a lovely
2142000	2144000	morning?
2144000	2146000	Up your a**.
2146000	2148000	But the point here is
2148000	2150000	Brooks believes that not all
2150000	2152000	comedic targets are created equal.
2152000	2154000	Ah, prairie shit.
2154000	2156000	Everybody.
2158000	2160000	Comedy is by its very nature
2160000	2162000	transgressive, and borders and norms do
2162000	2164000	need to be challenged, even surrounding
2164000	2166000	such sensitive topics as the Holocaust.
2166000	2168000	But in order to be effective,
2168000	2170000	that transgression must be used
2170000	2172000	carefully and with intent.
2174000	2176000	The offense bar is also
2176000	2178000	much higher now, unlike with the original film
2178000	2180000	which caused a flurry of controversy,
2180000	2182000	when the Broadway show and subsequently
2182000	2184000	the adaptation of the musical got released,
2184000	2186000	these barely got an indifferent shrug on the issue
2186000	2188000	of depiction of Nazis. By this point,
2188000	2190000	even moms don't find it edgy.
2190000	2192000	We're in a post-South Park world,
2192000	2194000	a post-Family Guy world,
2194000	2196000	a post-Downfall meme world.
2204000	2206000	So perhaps Hitler
2206000	2208000	is too powerless, and when people
2208000	2210000	express concerns about literal Nazis
2210000	2212000	or Nazi-adjacent useful idiots,
2222000	2224000	applause
2226000	2228000	The responses
2228000	2230000	become, why do you have to call
2230000	2232000	everyone you disagree with a Nazi?
2232000	2234000	But this cartoonization of Nazism
2234000	2236000	is also a sign of changing times,
2236000	2238000	just like The Producers was a sign of
2238000	2240000	changing times in 1967.
2240000	2242000	And I'm not even saying that that's
2242000	2244000	a bad thing, but it is
2244000	2246000	having an effect on the way that we treat our
2246000	2248000	history. Media like South Park
2248000	2250000	reinforces a worldview where nothing really
2250000	2252000	matters and everything is fair game.
2254000	2256000	And South Park has historically gotten away with this
2256000	2258000	because the message and intent is clear.
2260000	2262000	But South Park's imitators seem not to understand
2262000	2264000	why South Park gets away with transgressive humor
2264000	2266000	with relatively little blowback,
2266000	2268000	and they don't. How is
2268000	2270000	your representation framed? Is it
2270000	2272000	romantic? Or is it derisive?
2272000	2274000	Or is it comedic?
2274000	2276000	And most importantly, at whose
2276000	2278000	expense is the joke?
2280000	2282000	All humor
2282000	2284000	is based on some form of transgression.
2284000	2286000	Even a pie in the
2286000	2288000	face is a very
2288000	2290000	tiny, tiny societal transgression.
2290000	2292000	I'm not saying don't
2292000	2294000	transgress, and I'm not saying
2294000	2296000	societal mores and constructs
2296000	2298000	don't need to be challenged. However,
2298000	2300000	if you are going to make a
2300000	2302000	joke at the expense of a
2302000	2304000	historically shat upon group that is not
2304000	2306000	your own, you need to accept also
2306000	2308000	that there might be consequences, and
2308000	2310000	people might not think you're funny.
2310000	2312000	1. There is no such thing as
2312000	2314000	equal opportunity offensive because not
2314000	2316000	all groups exist on equal footing.
2316000	2318000	Maybe one day. Probably never.
2318000	2320000	But right now, we are nowhere
2320000	2322000	near that. Brooks cited the near lynching of
2322000	2324000	Bart in Blazing Saddles as a line he would not
2324000	2326000	cross. There is nothing funny about the image
2326000	2328000	of a black man being lynched, and Brooks owns
2328000	2330000	the fact that he, a white Jewish comedian,
2330000	2332000	has no business depicting the
2332000	2334000	image of a black man being lynched used for
2334000	2336000	comedy. 2. Brooks is
2336000	2338000	not down with Gentiles appropriating Jewish
2338000	2340000	suffering and genocide, let alone
2340000	2342000	shocking for shocking's sake. And ridiculing
2342000	2344000	Hitler's theatricality is not the
2344000	2346000	same thing as making a joke about Jewish
2346000	2348000	genocide. It's just
2348000	2350000	not. Mel Brooks is a 91
2350000	2352000	year old man. He spends a lot of time
2352000	2354000	these days going on tour and jumping
2354000	2356000	around on stage doing interviews talking about what
2356000	2358000	a great guy Gene Wilder was, and
2358000	2360000	I hope he keeps doing that.
2360000	2362000	It was such a wonderful part of my life.
2362000	2364000	I hope he spends his twilight years
2364000	2366000	reflecting on his successes and doesn't
2366000	2368000	find out that a very large portion of the
2368000	2370000	Gentile internet is using him as a defense
2370000	2372000	for why Gentiles making anti-Semitic jokes
2372000	2374000	is really okay because all
2374000	2376000	satire is created equal.
2376000	2378000	Look at the producers, even if you only
2378000	2380000	call it satire after the fact because your joke
2380000	2382000	didn't land. So yeah, you can totally
2382000	2384000	joke about whatever. For the time being,
2384000	2386000	free speech is the law of the land.
2386000	2388000	But if you're looking for a defense for your edgelord
2388000	2390000	satire, maybe the Jewish man who
2390000	2392000	served in Germany during World War II
2392000	2394000	who has publicly spoken out against media
2394000	2396000	that trivializes the suffering of the Holocaust
2396000	2398000	who has stated several times
2398000	2400000	that there are lines that should not be crossed
2400000	2402000	out of respect for oppressed groups
2402000	2404000	who has maintained that comedy is a weapon
2404000	2406000	and even owing to the fact that you will fuck up
2406000	2408000	its targets should be considered
2408000	2410000	with caution and care and never with the intent
2410000	2412000	of upholding unjust power structures
2412000	2414000	rather than dismantling them.
2414000	2416000	Maybe this guy
2416000	2418000	this guy is not
2418000	2420000	your best defense.
2422000	2424000	You gotta know
2424000	2426000	is everything
2426000	2428000	is showbiz
2430000	2432000	I'll myself
2432000	2434000	watch
2434000	2436000	my show
2436000	2438000	I'm the German Ethel Merman, don't you know
2438000	2440000	We are crossing
2440000	2442000	borders, the New World Order
2442000	2444000	is here
