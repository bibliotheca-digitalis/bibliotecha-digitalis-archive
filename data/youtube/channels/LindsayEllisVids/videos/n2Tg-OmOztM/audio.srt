CuriosityStream is a subscription streaming service

with thousands of documentaries and nonfiction titles.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,820
Interested in the science of how personality

8
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,240
and mental disorders develop over a lifetime?

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,840
Curious Minds Brain Health teams up with neurologists

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,600
and neuroscientists to explore how recent advancements

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,440
in technology have helped medical professionals diagnose,

12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,520
describe, and treat some of the common disorders

13
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,720
discussed in this video.

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,400
CuriosityStream is normally 1990 year,

15
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,440
but if you go to curiositystream.com slash Lindsey

16
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,440
and use the code Lindsey, it's only 1479 for the year,

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,760
and you get access to our streaming service, Nebula.

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,460
So go to curiositystream.com slash Lindsey,

19
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,940
use the code, which is also just my name,

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,480
and in the meantime, Loki.

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,560
I'm asking for safe passage through the anus.

22
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,360
So the MCU's hop to TV show has been preoccupied

23
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,260
with mental health, huh?

24
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,920
James, why does Sam aggravate you?

25
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,520
And don't say something childish.

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,620
First we had trauma as manifested

27
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,520
by sci-fi magic and WandaVision.

28
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,200
Look, we've all been there, right?

29
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,780
Letting our fear and anger get the best of us,

30
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,600
intentionally expanding the borders

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,360
of the false world we created.

32
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,200
Ahh!

33
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,440
Then we had PTSD and more trauma and lots of therapy

34
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,100
with Falcon and the Winter Soldier.

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,020
Look, you've got to nurture friendships.

36
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,000
I am the only person you have called all week.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,240
That is so sad.

38
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,880
But then we took an interesting turn

39
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,520
into a mental disorder that is extremely popular

40
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,960
as a character trait, but rarely discussed in fiction

41
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,900
with Loki.

42
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,800
I'm a narcissist.

43
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,420
And then of course there was all this discourse

44
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,100
reacting to the text of the show.

45
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,320
Is Loki a narcissist?

46
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,140
What a incredible seismic narcissist.

47
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,940
Narcissism or narcissistic personality disorders

48
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,360
is one of the more common personality disorders.

49
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,620
So it is kind of surprising

50
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,400
that it is so widely misunderstood,

51
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,280
especially in light of other mental illnesses

52
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,640
like bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder

53
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,100
or PTSD, gaining much wider awareness

54
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,560
in the last two decades.

55
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,600
Most people don't seem to have a lot of interest in it

56
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,480
outside of demonizing it.

57
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,320
Usually because they know a narcissist or several

58
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,280
and the perception of what NPD is

59
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,180
is basically that of a psychopath

60
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,200
with particularly high self-esteem.

61
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,840
Narcissists are primarily defined by their lack of empathy.

62
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,760
You know what happens when someone upsets me.

63
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,160
See how I do it.

64
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,760
So there are so many fictional narcissists in media.

65
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,840
Narcissists make great antagonists

66
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,840
and often sometimes even fun protagonists.

67
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,660
This perfect world begins and ends with me.

68
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,540
It's fun to watch characters who are blind

69
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,760
to their own faults and lack self-awareness.

70
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,040
Something less conspicuous.

71
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,040
Processing, processing.

72
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,160
Why am I so amazing?

73
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,080
In comedies, narcissists are, well, comedy gold

74
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,900
because we get to enjoy the juxtaposition

75
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,700
of how they see themselves

76
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,100
versus the reality of how other people see them.

77
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,520
You know, desire smells like that to some people.

78
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,360
What is that?

79
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,260
It smells like a turd covered in burnt hair.

80
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,720
The MCU has several prominent characters

81
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,280
to which the word narcissist has been applied.

82
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,060
Obviously, Loki is up there.

83
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,940
Then of course there's Thanos.

84
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,580
Thanos exercises power to wipe out half the universe

85
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,540
because he believes he is the only one

86
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,540
with the right solution to what he sees as a sickness.

87
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,900
And of course he sees his children

88
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,860
as an extension of himself and loves them.

89
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,440
If you're saying I play favorites, you're wrong.

90
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,320
I love all my children equally.

91
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,300
I don't care for Nebula.

92
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,980
Loves them extremely conditionally.

93
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,860
In order to take the stone,

94
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,380
you must lose that which you love.

95
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,260
You failed because you love nothing.

96
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,120
No one.

97
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,460
["You Will Be In My Heart"]

98
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,080
Hell, one of the main characters of the MCU, Tony Stark,

99
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,400
debatably tiptoes up to the line

100
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,520
of qualifying for the disorder.

101
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,200
It is one thing to question the official story

102
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,540
and another thing entirely to make wild accusations

103
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,620
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

104
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,280
I never said you were a superhero.

105
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,120
Didn't?

106
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,940
Mm-mm.

107
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,760
Well, good, because that would be outlandish and fantastic.

108
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,000
In order to better understand what the disorder is,

109
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,020
before we get into Loki,

110
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,360
let's walk through what might qualify someone

111
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,360
for having NPD using everyone's favorite

112
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,120
narcissistic mother, Lucille Bluth.

113
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,280
Everything I do is so dramatic and flamboyant.

114
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,680
It just makes me wanna set myself on fire.

115
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,540
Narcissistic personality disorder is defined

116
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,160
by the presence of at least five

117
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,200
of the following nine criteria,

118
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,360
a grandiose sense of self-importance.

119
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,200
What the hell was I supposed to do?

120
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,840
Michael Moore confronted me in front of the whole country.

121
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,680
First of all, it wasn't Michael Moore.

122
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,000
It was a Michael Moore lookalike,

123
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,720
and it wasn't in front of the whole country.

124
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,700
It was for a bit when Jimmy came alive.

125
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,120
I don't know who that is, and I don't care to find out.

126
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,520
A preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success,

127
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,080
power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love.

128
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,280
Tell me the truth, okay?

129
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,640
Because there's been a lot of lying in this family.

130
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,320
And a lot of love.

131
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,640
A belief that he or she is special and unique

132
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,000
and can only be understood by or should associate

133
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,520
with other special or high-status people or institutions.

134
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,480
Are you aware that we've been downgraded

135
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,120
to being just pool members at the club now?

136
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah, it's a real shame what's going on with this family.

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,920
You're stuck by the pool,

138
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,840
and Dad's getting picked last for softball.

139
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,280
A need for excessive admiration.

140
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,520
It's not just Mother Boy.

141
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,780
It's Mother Boy 30.

142
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,320
And I think with you, I've got a shot.

143
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,200
A sense of entitlement.

144
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,360
What's Spanish for?

145
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,680
I know you speak English.

146
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,840
Interpersonally exploitative behavior.

147
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,280
Did you and Dad adopt a child?

148
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
He must have forged my signature.

149
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,960
Well, then maybe I'll get a son

150
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,680
who will finish his cottage cheese.

151
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,520
A lack of empathy.

152
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,240
I want to cry so bad,

153
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,720
I don't think I can spare the moisture.

154
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,480
One lousy cigar rip.

155
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,360
Oh, honey, they're just heels.

156
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,920
They can only support so much weight.

157
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,440
Envy of others or a belief

158
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,960
that others are envious of him or her.

159
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,080
She's trying to prove

160
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,360
that she's closer to my children than I am,

161
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,200
but the joke's on her

162
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,960
because she doesn't know how little I care for Joe.

163
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,560
A demonstration of arrogant

164
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,000
and haughty behaviors or attitudes.

165
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,200
Take it back.

166
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,120
If I wanted something your thumb touched,

167
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,840
I'd eat the inside of your ear.

168
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,000
So these are just the DSM criteria,

169
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,520
but there are many more behaviors and symptoms

170
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,760
associated with the disorder.

171
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,840
I know when I'm not wanted.

172
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,600
Narcissists don't feel responsible for their own conduct,

173
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,360
but they will always hold others accountable

174
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,640
for any transgression, real or imagined.

175
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,920
Narcissists have an almost comically short memory

176
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,200
for their own behaviors

177
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,880
and will frequently rewrite history

178
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,240
to suit their own narrative.

179
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,400
I put the fires out.

180
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,480
You made them worse.

181
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,400
Worse or better?

182
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,520
Narcissists are also perpetual victims.

183
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,640
They often use the language of social justice

184
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,600
to reassure others that their victimhood is quite real.

185
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,280
That palace you live in, up there on that hill.

186
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,000
I gave my life to my children on a silver platter.

187
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,280
The admiration of others is a salve to shield them

188
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,880
from the perception of vulnerability.

189
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,640
It's important to remember that victimhood

190
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,480
and vulnerability are not the same thing.

191
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,760
I was the world's nicest guy

192
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,560
and they ruined my life for no reason.

193
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,000
See, just like I said, I'm the victim here.

194
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,720
But while narcissists frequently frame themselves

195
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,240
as the victims of injustice,

196
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,120
they tend to be outraged when other people claim victimhood,

197
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,520
especially when it counters their own narrative.

198
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,800
You are fake crying.

199
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,120
That is not real.

200
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,040
As a victim of abuse myself.

201
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,800
Oh my God.

202
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,640
You are so manipulative.

203
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,120
God, oh my God.

204
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,040
I was molested.

205
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,840
I have been, oh my gosh.

206
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,560
I've learned I am an empath, right?

207
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,560
Narcissists also aren't capable of love

208
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,720
in the way that neurotypical people are,

209
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,000
which is why it's so hard for the children of narcissists

210
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,520
to admit that their parents are in fact narcissists

211
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,800
because it's difficult to accept

212
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,360
that your parent doesn't really love you

213
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,000
in a way that a parent should

214
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,200
because narcissistic parents don't see their children

215
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,560
as autonomous people, but as extensions of themselves.

216
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,640
I see a strong, confident, beautiful young lady.

217
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,080
Oh look, you're here too.

218
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,880
I'm just teasing.

219
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,160
Stop taking everything so seriously.

220
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,960
Narcissists seek affection and approval,

221
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,040
but remain indifferent to any harm they themselves cause.

222
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,360
Interpersonal boundaries to a narcissist

223
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,920
are a form of abuse.

224
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,720
After everything I've done for you.

225
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,040
That I didn't ask for.

226
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,040
Do you have any idea of the work you're undoing?

227
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,880
Love to a narcissist isn't caring

228
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,480
for another person's emotional needs, but controlling them.

229
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,480
Suddenly he's too much of a big shot to brush mother's hair.

230
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,320
Well, I'm not.

231
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,600
Now with all that said,

232
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,240
there are a lot of common misconceptions of narcissism.

233
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,840
The first is that all narcissists

234
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,240
are extremely self-confident.

235
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,240
They're all so beautiful.

236
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,560
Why don't I have three heads?

237
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,360
Oh, this is funny.

238
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,200
This is not true.

239
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,800
What appears as confidence is often a thin veneer,

240
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,840
hiding feelings of shame, self-doubt and self-hatred.

241
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,320
Obsessive self-loathing is a form of narcissism.

242
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,880
Narcissists are usually oblivious to hurt they cause others.

243
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,120
Often hurtful behavior is just collateral damage

244
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,840
to having their emotional needs met.

245
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,240
I do everything I can to help you.

246
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,320
And all you can do is drink and talk nonsense

247
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,120
and frighten me.

248
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,920
Go back to bed.

249
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,560
Narcissists are evil.

250
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,800
I told Dwight that there is honor in losing,

251
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,960
which as we all know is completely ridiculous,

252
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,320
but there is however honor in making a loser feel better,

253
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,480
which is what I just did for Dwight.

254
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,240
The reality is that narcissists may behave

255
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,880
in hurtful ways, but they are not inherently evil.

256
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,520
Would I rather be feared or loved?

257
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,640
Easy, both.

258
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,400
I want people to be afraid of how much they love me.

259
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,760
Narcissistic personality disorder does not implicate

260
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,040
any kind of off-kilter moral barometer.

261
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,480
There's nothing wrong with a narcissist's impulse control

262
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,480
or their ability to tell right from wrong.

263
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,840
Quite the opposite in some ways.

264
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,800
Narcissists are not only able to discern right from wrong,

265
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
they for the most part want to do right,

266
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,040
again, because they want to be liked.

267
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,680
For me to be attracted to a woman,

268
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,280
she has to be as intelligent or slightly less intelligent

269
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,560
than me, and she is, you know.

270
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,200
Narcissists all come from a background of privilege.

271
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,840
People have a very specific idea

272
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,000
that narcissists come from a certain background.

273
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,520
They are privileged, they come from wealth and power,

274
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,440
and that is sometimes true,

275
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,240
but anyone from any background can develop the disorder.

276
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,320
Although there is no one cause for narcissism,

277
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,640
it rarely emerges in people

278
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,720
who come from stable, loving families.

279
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,200
I'd rather smother them with a pillow

280
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,800
than take them to Nevada!

281
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,560
Always with the drama!

282
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,000
It is often the result of trauma or emotional neglect,

283
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,800
and for those who perceive wealth and power,

284
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,920
the wealth and power is used

285
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,160
to shield an incredibly fragile ego.

286
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,880
You clearly don't know who you're talking to,

287
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,520
so let me clue you in.

288
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,760
I am not in danger, Skyler.

289
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,600
I am the danger.

290
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,240
A guy opens his door and gets shot,

291
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,720
and you think that of me?

292
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,880
No.

293
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,680
I am the one who knocks!

294
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,360
But one of the more common misconceptions

295
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,000
is the conflation of narcissism with psychopathy,

296
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
this idea that narcissists don't experience hurt or pain

297
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,480
or even their own, you know, version of love.

298
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,920
When you leave my heart

299
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,320
narcissists, especially female narcissists,

300
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,760
actually live in a constant state of anxiety,

301
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,520
and boy, do they want you to know that.

302
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,280
Hope you have children of your own

303
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,560
and they treat you like this.

304
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,960
They gave my life to my children on a silver platter.

305
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,920
This is bullshit.

306
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,160
So here's why narcissists aren't just psychopaths

307
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,280
with high self-esteem.

308
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,360
Psychopaths don't really care

309
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,440
what other people think of them.

310
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,040
They don't care about their lives

311
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,560
and they don't experience empathy,

312
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,120
where a narcissist is defined by a preoccupation

313
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,760
with what other people think of them.

314
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,440
They are constantly reshaping themselves

315
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,280
to fit whatever mold they think will serve them best.

316
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,440
I'm Prison Mike.

317
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,120
You know why they call me Prison Mike?

318
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,520
Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else?

319
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,920
Do you really expect me to not push you up

320
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,400
against the wall, beotch?

321
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,560
Some narcissists do this by being charming.

322
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,840
I am a writer, a doctor, a nuclear physicist,

323
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,440
a theoretical philosopher.

324
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,240
But above all, I am a man.

325
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,960
You're a hopelessly inquisitive man, just like you.

326
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,680
Some by being manipulative.

327
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,120
Tears aren't a woman's only weapon.

328
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,480
Some by being controlling and some downright authoritarian.

329
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,840
It's the unspoken truth of humanity

330
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,600
that you crave subjugation.

331
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,440
But a true narcissist doesn't live

332
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,520
in a state of cold self-assuredness.

333
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,560
Rather, they live in a constant state of anxiety

334
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,680
and hypervigilance.

335
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,120
You don't know what goes through this mind of mine.

336
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,640
Well, that's for fucking sure.

337
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,320
But narcissism in itself is not unhealthy.

338
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,200
There is what is called healthy narcissism

339
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,320
and it is healthy to exhibit some narcissistic traits.

340
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,360
You do actually need some narcissism

341
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,040
for a healthy functioning psyche.

342
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,840
And that is the sort of thing that lets you stand up

343
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,320
for yourself when you're being treated unfairly.

344
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,840
I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki.

345
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,840
The next time you raise a hand to me

346
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,440
will be the last time you have hands.

347
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,960
So with all that groundwork out of the way,

348
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,160
the big question, is Loki a narcissist?

349
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,160
Sorry about that time I turned you into a frog.

350
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,760
It was a wonderful joke.

351
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,240
Was indeed hilarious.

352
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,160
Well, depends on which Loki.

353
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,080
The most lovable version of Loki,

354
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,800
the Loki from Thor Ragnarok.

355
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,960
I have been falling for 30 minutes.

356
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,040
Is probably the most narcissistic.

357
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,400
The movie begins with him watching a plague

358
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,120
glorifying his part in the previous film.

359
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,040
I'm sorry about that thing with the Tesseract.

360
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,920
I just couldn't help myself.

361
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,760
I'm a trickster.

362
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,600
This is so mischievous.

363
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,200
He spends the entire movie

364
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,480
caring not at all about Thor

365
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,520
or whatever is going on in Sakaar.

366
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,080
Feels no empathy for Thor

367
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,680
when he's getting the shit kicked out of him.

368
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,680
In fact, enjoys it as a form of retribution.

369
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,280
That's how it feels.

370
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,920
I'm just a huge fan of the sport.

371
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,040
And in the end, any altruistic action he takes

372
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,960
is ultimately because it's the best action for him.

373
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,280
Suddenly you're overcome with an urge to do the right thing.

374
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,480
Heavens no.

375
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,120
I ran out of faith with the Grandmaster

376
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,160
and in exchange for codes and access to a ship,

377
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,320
I'm asking for safe passage through the anus.

378
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,840
And sure, he saves the day at the end,

379
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,800
but not out of a sense of empathy,

380
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,880
but out of the correct sense that this path

381
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,280
is the one that will get him the most adulation.

382
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,560
Your savior is here!

383
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,760
Contrast this with the Loki in Loki.

384
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,640
He displays narcissistic traits,

385
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,120
but basically completely falls short

386
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,280
of having the disorder in the very first episode.

387
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,280
I don't enjoy hurting people.

388
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,120
I do it because I have to,

389
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,520
because I've had to.

390
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,240
It's the cruel, elaborate trick

391
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,320
counted by the weak to inspire fear.

392
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,560
A desperate play for control.

393
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,440
He loves his mother, not as an extension of himself,

394
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,960
but for her own sake and is protective of her safety.

395
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,800
Where is he?

396
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,880
Now why don't you tell me,

397
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,120
do you enjoy hurting people?

398
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,960
I don't believe you.

399
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,800
Do you enjoy killing?

400
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,640
I'll kill you.

401
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,240
What, like you did your mother?

402
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,440
Sylvie is self-taught, but Loki.

403
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,080
Someone taught you fairly decent magic.

404
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
My mother.

405
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,560
Then there's the interaction with Sif

406
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,960
where he comes to a conclusion

407
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,200
about his personal failings on his own.

408
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,560
I crave attention because I'm,

409
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,920
I'm a narcissist.

410
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,040
It's because I'm scared of being alone.

411
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,320
A true narcissist would continue to deflect blame

412
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,120
when confronted with all of the timeline stuff

413
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,400
he had in store for him.

414
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,960
He wouldn't accept responsibility,

415
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,400
and he certainly wouldn't have an honest come to Jesus moment

416
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,360
after being punched in the head 400 times

417
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,680
by the same person.

418
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,320
I'm a narcissist.

419
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,800
He might say something manipulative

420
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,480
to get her to stop hitting,

421
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,280
but the Sif time loop would not bring about

422
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,240
an honest moment of self-reflection in a true narcissist.

423
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,840
Again, narcissists are eternal victims.

424
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,320
They are pathologically incapable of self-reflection

425
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,040
if it doesn't come from an outside source

426
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,240
that they care about.

427
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,840
Also, vulnerability is anathema to a narcissist,

428
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,160
but Loki allows himself to be vulnerable several times.

429
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,640
Most relevant to the discussion in The Discourse,

430
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,320
and indeed in the show itself,

431
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,520
is what he sees in Sylvie, his alternate universe self,

432
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,480
specifically in the moments before he thinks

433
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,840
they're both about to die.

434
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,000
You were just a child when the TVA took you,

435
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,760
but you nearly took down the organization

436
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,040
that claims to govern the order of time.

437
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,120
You did it on your own.

438
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,480
You had rings around them.

439
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,400
You're amazing.

440
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,880
Clearly there are elements of him looking at her

441
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,520
and seeing aspects of what he could have been,

442
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,360
but ultimately the virtues that he appreciates in Sylvie

443
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,960
aren't really virtues that he shares.

444
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,640
A common tactic when narcissists compliment other people

445
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,360
is that they are really complimenting themselves,

446
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,200
but Loki isn't doing that here.

447
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,480
Like, they're variations on the same person,

448
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,480
but they are still two completely different people.

449
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,680
The contradiction of Loki as a show

450
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,360
is that much of the tension

451
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,000
comes from Loki's history of narcissism.

452
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,640
His history of narcissism

453
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,600
is what makes him the most likely in the room

454
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,840
to betray anyone at any given point.

455
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,160
You're really good at doing awful things

456
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,360
and then just getting away.

457
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,200
What can I say?

458
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,080
I'm a mischievous scamp.

459
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,920
While at the same time,

460
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,080
Loki is most likely to do whatever it takes

461
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,960
to be liked or gain power.

462
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,640
There's this constant tension of will he betray Mobius?

463
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,320
Will he betray Sylvie?

464
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,480
Mobius, come on.

465
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,880
What could possibly go wrong?

466
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,600
We gotta properly test this theory.

467
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,080
Well, here's a fun theory.

468
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,400
You lure me out into the field

469
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,840
and then you stab me in the back,

470
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,720
and that's a theory I don't wanna test.

471
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,560
I can't sleep in a place like this.

472
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,840
You can't sleep on a train?

473
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,680
No, I can't sleep around untrustworthy people.

474
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,520
But in the end,

475
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,160
aside from a couple of very justified moments

476
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,400
of self-preservation,

477
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,280
the Loki in the TV show betrays nobody.

478
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,520
Six episodes, nary a betrayal that wasn't earned.

479
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,360
I'm staying.

480
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,760
Which is why the ending,

481
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,320
Sylvie's assumption that he intends to betray her

482
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,400
while the rando at the end of time chews the scenery,

483
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,440
makes the conclusion of the show ring kind of hollow.

484
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,760
You want the throne.

485
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,680
No.

486
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,400
No, Sylvie, this does not comport

487
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,320
with the person that you have been interacting with

488
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,520
during this series.

489
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,960
That's what you think of me.

490
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,240
After all this time.

491
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,360
Sure, why not?

492
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,040
Evil Loki's master plan comes together.

493
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,320
Because the Loki you have been interacting with

494
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,440
never acted like a self-serving narcissist.

495
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
He's actually pretty self-sacrificial.

496
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,200
You've both risked your life for each other

497
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,240
several times by now.

498
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,040
Loki, I don't even know if this is gonna work.

499
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,680
You go, I go.

500
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,680
It's almost like you've been watching all the movies

501
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,400
we saw before this.

502
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,880
So from movie to movie to TV show,

503
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,720
I think it's fair to say

504
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,920
that Loki's writing is inconsistent.

505
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,440
NPD is not a disorder

506
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,600
that you can character arc your way out of.

507
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,440
By definition, it is incurable.

508
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,240
So if you want to incorporate the Loki of Disney plus Loki

509
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,920
into Loki's greater journey,

510
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,880
but I don't think he's badly written,

511
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,640
but he's not an honest portrayal of a narcissist.

512
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,160
Ten is a true narcissist.

513
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,320
I give him a seven, maybe an eight.

514
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,040
Absolutely not.

515
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,120
This is fine and guardian leather.

516
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,000
But this is not to say that the MCU

517
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,680
doesn't have anything meaningful to say about narcissism.

518
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,400
The best, most honest portrayal in the MCU of a narcissist

519
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,320
is not Loki, nor is it Thanos, but...

520
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,720
My name is Ego,

521
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,280
and I'm your dad, Peter.

522
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,840
Uh-oh, have we found an excuse

523
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,800
to fawn over Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 again?

524
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,920
Yes, yes, yes, yes, we have.

525
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,160
I thought Yondu was your father.

526
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,560
You look exactly alike.

527
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,920
One's blue.

528
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,480
So in a lot of ways,

529
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,040
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the rare movie

530
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,680
that makes the first one better in retrospect.

531
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,040
A lot of the boomer nostalgia from the first movie

532
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,760
that just felt kind of random and atmospheric

533
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,120
and maybe a little pandery.

534
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,320
Ooh, child, things will get brighter.

535
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,760
Then bring it down hard.

536
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,680
Now, with the context of the second movie,

537
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,120
feels a lot more thoughtful.

538
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,880
Take, for instance, the soundtracks

539
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,640
and the song in Guardians 2

540
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,400
that serves as a through line.

541
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,160
You know Brandy by Looking Glass?

542
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,920
On first blush when we first meet

543
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,520
CGIDH Kurt Russell in Peter's Mom,

544
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,120
you're like, yeah, that's a fun 70s love song.

545
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,040
How quaint.

546
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,920
I will take one nostalgia, please.

547
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,120
This is brandy, such a motherland.

548
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,360
But as the movie unfolds,

549
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,960
the ugly undertones become more and more apparent.

550
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,520
You know, Peter, you and I, we're the sailor in that song.

551
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,440
The sailor in the song doesn't care about Brandy at all.

552
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,880
He's all about his own pleasure, his own goals,

553
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,880
and he frames it like it's a good, fun thing.

554
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,440
See calls upon him as history calls upon great men.

555
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,360
There is zero remorse in the song,

556
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,960
which is why we're here today.

557
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,040
We're going to be together for a long time.

558
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,960
We're going to be together for a long time.

559
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,200
We're going to be together for a long time.

560
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,560
There is zero remorse in the song,

561
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,560
which is why Ego is drawn to it,

562
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,080
and to a certain extent, Peter.

563
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,120
It was one of Earth's greatest musical compositions.

564
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,120
Perhaps it's very greatest.

565
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,280
Yeah, yes.

566
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,040
Guardians 2 is about family, what makes one,

567
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,040
but largely it's also about how Ego

568
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,920
negatively affects relationships,

569
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,760
both the literal character ego

570
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,920
and the concept of narcissism itself.

571
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,000
They told me you people were conceited douchebags,

572
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,040
but that isn't true at all.

573
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,480
Rocket steals batteries

574
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,640
because the Sovereign offended his ego.

575
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,880
The Sovereign's motivation for revenge

576
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,240
throughout the entire movie is ego.

577
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,840
Our concern is they're slight against our people.

578
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,920
Peter and Rocket nearly kill everybody

579
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,600
trying to prove that they are the superior pilot, Ego.

580
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,680
Gator, we almost died because of your arrogance.

581
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,800
So Ego operates as the perfect portrait of a narcissist.

582
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,840
He can't understand other people's motivations

583
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,360
that don't directly serve him.

584
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,480
But instead of returning you,

585
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,320
Yondu kept you.

586
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,600
I have no clue as to why.

587
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,400
And challenging questions that center other people's needs.

588
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,360
Why didn't you come back?

589
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,360
Why did you send Yondu, a criminal of all people, to come?

590
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,920
Well, we're just gonna change the subject.

591
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,880
I've made many mistakes, Peter,

592
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,880
but you're not one of them.

593
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,880
There's so much that I need to teach you about this planet.

594
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,480
But at the same time, Ego is also good at charming people.

595
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,000
And with Peter, he's good at giving Peter validation

596
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,560
that feels like validation,

597
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,360
but really it's just Ego complimenting himself.

598
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,440
Who the hell are you?

599
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,480
Figured my rugged good looks would make that obvious.

600
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,920
I can explain your very special heritage.

601
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,680
Out of all my spawn,

602
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,680
only you carry the connection to the light.

603
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,520
But most of all,

604
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,440
he sees everyone as either an extension of himself

605
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,400
or a potential extension of himself.

606
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,800
Peter is valuable to him

607
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,080
when Peter is willing to perform that role,

608
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,240
but the second he behaves autonomously.

609
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,080
You really need to grow up.

610
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,200
But like Ego, Peter is also extremely narcissistic.

611
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,800
That's why he nearly falls for Ego's plan.

612
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,680
Well, it's because that place was real

613
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,840
and this is a fantasy.

614
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,680
I get it.

615
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,960
You're jealous because I'm part God

616
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,280
and you like when I'm the weak one.

617
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,160
Ego tells him he is special, he's powerful.

618
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,320
And without the planet that is Ego,

619
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,160
he's not special anymore.

620
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,360
You are a God.

621
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,920
If you kill me, you'll be just like everybody else.

622
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,400
Peter's narcissism is the main thing

623
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,320
getting in the way with his relationship with Gamora

624
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,720
because, well,

625
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,560
she's already lived through escaping one narcissist

626
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,400
in her life.

627
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,920
So her hesitation is very understandable.

628
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,080
This is why I hate Infinity War.

629
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,760
Anyway, this line, for instance.

630
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,600
You know what?

631
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,240
This is not Cheers after all.

632
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,400
I don't know what Cheers is!

633
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,000
It's played for laughs, but it's very revealing.

634
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,840
He's whining about his needs and he doesn't even care

635
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,800
that she doesn't know what he's talking about.

636
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,800
My life, my love, my lady is the sea.

637
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,240
There's a lot of heavy stuff in this movie

638
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,920
that is couched in comedy.

639
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,800
Arguably by necessity, because if you seriously mull

640
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,760
on what's happening in certain scenes.

641
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,880
Yondu is the guy who abducted me, kicked the crap out of me

642
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,160
so I could learn to fight and kept me in terror

643
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,560
by threatening to eat me.

644
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,400
It's actually pretty disturbing.

645
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,120
You said you were gonna eat me.

646
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,440
That was being funny, not to me!

647
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,200
But the other side of the coin to the effects

648
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,360
of the narcissistic parent is Mantis,

649
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,640
who is functionally also Ego's child.

650
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,600
He raised me by hand and kept me as his own.

651
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,760
So you're a pet.

652
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,200
I suppose.

653
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,560
Mantis is an empath.

654
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,760
You're empathic, so an empath.

655
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,600
I've heard that before.

656
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,200
I've learned I am an empath, right?

657
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,960
No, Shane, like a real one.

658
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,800
Empaths feel feelings.

659
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
Particularly relevant because narcissists

660
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,560
prey on other people's empathy.

661
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,640
Children of narcissistic parents frequently learn

662
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,640
to shape-shift as a survival mechanism.

663
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,400
The first thing Mantis does in the film

664
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,560
is laugh at Drax's practical joke,

665
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,440
even though she clearly hates it.

666
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,320
That is called a practical joke.

667
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,880
He likes it very much.

668
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,520
It's not too boring to say that you're fine

669
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,560
and you're not really fine,

670
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,320
but you just can't get into it because they would-

671
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,160
Children of narcissists tend to either be

672
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,040
pathological pleasers or very cold.

673
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,080
They either exhaust themselves in a lifetime

674
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,760
of trying to please the unpleasable.

675
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,640
A child my father would have Gamora in me

676
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,160
bow to one another in training.

677
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,040
Every time my sister prevailed,

678
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,520
my father would replace a piece of me with machinery.

679
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,240
Or they stonewall everyone they enter

680
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,600
an intimate relationship with

681
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,760
every time there's conflict.

682
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,600
So a lot of Mantis' scenes are couched in comedy

683
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,640
because she is deeply traumatized.

684
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,160
So a lot of the expression of her trauma

685
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,360
is framed for laughs because-

686
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,720
This gross bug lady is my new friend.

687
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,000
I'm learning many things like I'm a pet and ugly.

688
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,880
Otherwise it would be a bit too heavy in a movie like this.

689
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,720
I'm very popular, y'all!

690
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,400
So given the way the MCU utilizes narcissists

691
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,840
slash protagonists who, while not being narcissistic

692
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,520
to the point of disorder, are extremely narcissistic,

693
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,880
there is a success here.

694
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,080
We love narcissistic characters.

695
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,040
We see the narcissism of the protagonist in ourselves

696
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,000
and the narcissism of the villains is just fun to watch.

697
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,040
They are memorable.

698
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,800
I am a god, you dull creature!

699
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,360
And I will not be bullied by-

700
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,880
So it's interesting to me

701
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,880
that we hate IRL narcissists so much.

702
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,000
Why is that?

703
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,480
In some ways, it's the same reason

704
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,600
why addicts loathe alcoholics

705
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,240
or why people with anger issues loathe domestic abusers.

706
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,600
We hate the most in others

707
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,320
the thing we fear the most in ourselves.

708
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,440
So the funny thing about Loki is

709
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,560
we loved Loki, the narcissist,

710
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,920
as long as the word narcissist wasn't trotted out,

711
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,680
because the moment it is trotted out-

712
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,600
What a incredible seismic narcissist!

713
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,760
He has to stop being a narcissist

714
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,320
in order to remain likable.

715
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
And then suddenly he's Mr. Empathy.

716
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,240
His behavior is no longer disordered but relatable.

717
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,960
He's no longer a narcissist,

718
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,040
but wrestling with his own narcissism.

719
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,440
This isn't about you.

720
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,160
That said, it's really common for people

721
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,240
to talk about having been in relationships

722
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,480
with people with other personality disorders

723
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,360
and maybe it was extremely difficult,

724
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,800
but they don't talk about those people

725
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,160
in terms of a condition that must be fundamentally avoided.

726
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,280
It's framed as a mental illness.

727
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,280
So why don't we talk about narcissists in the same way?

728
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,360
Why are narcissists always spiders

729
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,040
who capture people in their web

730
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,160
rather than people with behavioral disorders

731
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,800
that don't have the tools to manage their disorder?

732
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,320
The worst thing about narcissists

733
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,840
isn't that they're narcissists.

734
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,680
Most of them want to be good people.

735
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,000
They thrive off validation.

736
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,240
The worst thing about narcissists

737
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,400
is they never seek treatment for their condition,

738
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,720
because they don't want the stigma of being a narcissist.

739
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,560
So therefore, they never admit that they are

740
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,160
and they never stop hurting the people

741
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,560
that they care about, you know, in their way.

742
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,640
This is especially true

743
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,080
for narcissistic parents of adult children.

744
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,560
Why did you adopt me?

745
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,560
Because I wanted someone to love.

746
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,920
Don't you act for me.

747
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,400
Again, this is a really common thing

748
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,760
children of narcissists will notice about their parents.

749
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,040
They believe they're good people doing the right thing

750
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,680
and they just don't understand

751
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,200
why their children don't want to talk to them,

752
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,200
no matter how many times their children have explained it.

753
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,760
Both Yondu and Ego were shit parents.

754
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,960
Ego, the narcissist,

755
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,080
and Yondu, the abusive and neglectful adoptive father.

756
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,840
But in the end, one of them was able to see their child

757
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,320
as more than just an extension of themselves.

758
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,840
And that is what sets him apart as a parent.

759
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,840
I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.

760
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,040
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

761
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,440
So fictional narcissists occupy an interesting space

762
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,120
with regard to the way we engage with real life narcissists.

763
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,120
Frost giants and mad titans and living planets aren't real.

764
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,480
But people with narcissistic personality disorder are.

765
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,240
And according to some studies,

766
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:04,240
up to 5% of all humans have narcissistic personality disorder.

767
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,960
A lot of people claim to have narcissistic parents,

768
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,520
not because it's trendy,

769
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,600
well, not just because it's trendy,

770
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,360
but also just because it's a really common disorder.

771
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,680
So what have we learned from these fictional examples

772
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,040
of how to deal with narcissists?

773
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:22,480
Well, either they character arc their way into a cure

774
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,400
or we kill them.

775
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,800
A narcissist can't cure their condition

776
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,440
in the same way that someone

777
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,200
with less stigmatized disorders like major depression

778
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,120
or borderline personality disorder

779
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,200
or bipolar disorder can't cure theirs.

780
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,080
But that doesn't mean they can't evolve

781
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,840
or improve as people.

782
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,440
It's not curable, but it is treatable.

783
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,200
And the hardest hurdle here is usually

784
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,480
to get the narcissist to want treatment in the first place.

785
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,640
So aside from a pretty disappointing last episode,

786
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,480
I really did enjoy Loki

787
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,280
and I don't want to imply that the show is a failure

788
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,040
because it made him less narcissistic

789
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,240
in the service of making him more likable.

790
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,560
I just think that the result is a show

791
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,840
that doesn't have a lot to say about narcissism

792
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,520
despite trying to.

793
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,440
And it leaves me wondering,

794
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,560
is it even possible

795
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,640
to destigmatize narcissistic personality disorder

796
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,680
in the way that things like bipolar disorder

797
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,280
or major depression have lost their stigma

798
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,760
in the last few decades?

799
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,160
And if so, what would that look like?

800
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,960
Disney is an evil mega hydra

801
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,480
that is rapidly covering the land in darkness.

802
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,400
But there is something to be said for the fact

803
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,480
that not only do they feel safe making these narratives,

804
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,480
but that they've turned them

805
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,440
into some of the most popular television

806
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,440
of the streaming era so far.

807
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,520
I didn't really touch on the Falcon and the Winter Soldier

808
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,560
because, honestly, I thought it was pretty boring.

809
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,840
But I do think it's worth mentioning

810
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,360
that this is the only one of these series

811
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,480
that integrates any discussion on therapy

812
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,720
or how to live with mental illness,

813
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,320
which Loki doesn't because, you know,

814
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,640
it's not that kind of show.

815
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,360
Aah!

816
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,600
Aah!

817
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,440
Not every piece of media that deals with mental illness

818
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,160
needs to integrate some portion

819
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,640
about like medication or therapy or whatever.

820
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,240
Are you still having nightmares?

821
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,120
But if you look at these three

822
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,960
and how they all take such different approaches

823
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,160
to exploring mental illness through fiction,

824
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,720
it's interesting that this is such a through line

825
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,120
with the new direction Marvel is going.

826
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,280
Ask your doctor about Nexus,

827
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,960
a unique antidepressant that works to anchor you

828
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,040
back to your reality or the reality of your choice.

829
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,440
Side effects include feeling your feelings,

830
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,640
confronting your truth, seizing your destiny,

831
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,600
and possibly more depression.

832
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,000
Right now, it's less here is the conflict

833
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,280
and more how did the conflict shape these characters?

834
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,120
Which does kind of become a problem

835
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,800
with shows like WandaVision where in the end,

836
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,400
we still kind of have to punch our way out of the conflict.

837
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,920
But whatever, it's been nominated for like 80 Emmys.

838
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,680
Clearly they're doing something right.

839
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,680
And I killed Sparky too.

840
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,160
So I don't want to give Disney too much credit here,

841
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,160
but I think there is some value

842
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,360
to these pop culture artifacts

843
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,160
designed for mass consumption

844
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,160
normalizing these discussions,

845
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,720
because I've seen it help a lot of people

846
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,240
find the language for their own traumas

847
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,560
or even in the case of Loki,

848
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,000
their own relationship to their own narcissism

849
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,920
that maybe they haven't really processed yet.

850
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,160
And I can only surmise that you guys are hungry

851
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,160
for more content about toxic narcissistic parents.

852
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,440
So smooth.

853
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,280
My bad.

854
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,640
So my first book, Axiom's End,

855
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,880
is a Kindle deal of the month.

856
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,920
It's only $2.99 on Amazon

857
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,800
for the entire months of September.

858
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,600
It also just came out in paperback.

859
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,600
There's paperback.

860
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,960
Treat my books very well.

861
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,840
And if you want to know how this ties in

862
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,320
with the theme of narcissistic parents,

863
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,960
well, I guess you'll just have to read it to find out.

864
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,840
And if you're into exploring trauma

865
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,880
using science fiction and aliens and stuff,

866
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,480
my second book comes out on October 12th.

867
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,640
This is not the final version,

868
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,200
so I'm allowed to have used this one.

869
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,440
This is an advanced reader copy.

870
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,800
They throw these in their cycling

871
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,200
once the real book comes out.

872
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,400
Anyway, you can pre-order signed copies of that

873
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,320
in the link below, but maybe you're just not satisfied.

874
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,360
You need more content.

875
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,120
You're insatiable.

876
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,640
And maybe you're wondering,

877
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,120
where do I keep all my videos

878
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,480
that are too spicy for YouTube?

879
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,880
Well, that's where Nebula comes in.

880
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,160
I have several video essays

881
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,840
that you can only watch on Nebula.

882
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,440
The Streamy Award-nominated Nebula,

883
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,440
try saying that five times fast,

884
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,000
is a video streaming platform built for

885
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,840
and by creators like Sarah Z, Maggie Mae Fish,

886
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,280
Big Joel, myself, but not ContraPoints.

887
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,320
And if you want access to my hot takes

888
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,320
that are too spicy for YouTube,

889
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,160
you get access to our streaming service, Nebula,

890
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,560
when you go to curiositystream.com slash Lindsay

891
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,920
and use the code, which is also my name,

892
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,440
and you get access to several Nebula original videos

893
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,760
that I've already made,

894
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,960
exploring topics like Tropic Thunder, comma,

895
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,240
all the trends it destroyed through parody

896
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,360
that were tried too.

897
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,640
And could Blazing Saddles be made today?

898
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,360
God damn it, why are people still asking this?

899
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,680
Excuse me while I whip this out.

900
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,520
Aah!

901
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,280
So thank you for watching.

902
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,440
Thank you for support.

903
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,400
And I'll see you next time.

904
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,680
And suddenly you're overcome with an urge

905
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,520
to do the right thing.

906
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,720
Heavens no.

907
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,360
I ran out of faith with the Grandmaster

908
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,440
and in exchange for codes and access to a ship,

909
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,920
I'm asking for safe passage through the anus.

910
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,760
Through the anus.

911
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,520
Through the anus.

912
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,400
Through the anus.

913
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,960
Why the hell is there an alligator in here?

914
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,760
Through the anus.

915
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,800
Through the anus.

916
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,760
Anus.

917
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,720
I was a king.

918
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,600
The rightful king of-

919
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,440
Anus.

920
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,160
Through the anus.

921
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,840
I still need that anus.

922
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,760
I've come too far for anything else.

923
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,760
Anus.

924
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,760
I am Loki,

925
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,760
the V Asgard.

926
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,160
And I am burdened with glorious anus.

927
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,000
Anus.

928
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,840
Through the anus.

929
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,680
The anus.

930
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,480
That's why I need to get out of here.

931
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,880
The anus.

932
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,720
My army,

933
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,560
my anus.

934
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,800
I have to get off this planet.

935
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,640
Anus.
