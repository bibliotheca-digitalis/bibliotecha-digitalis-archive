00:11.800 --> 00:14.840

00:14.840 --> 00:16.820
Interested in the science of how personality

00:16.820 --> 00:19.240
and mental disorders develop over a lifetime?

00:19.240 --> 00:21.840
Curious Minds Brain Health teams up with neurologists

00:21.840 --> 00:24.600
and neuroscientists to explore how recent advancements

00:24.600 --> 00:27.440
in technology have helped medical professionals diagnose,

00:27.440 --> 00:29.520
describe, and treat some of the common disorders

00:29.520 --> 00:30.720
discussed in this video.

00:30.720 --> 00:33.400
CuriosityStream is normally 1990 year,

00:33.400 --> 00:36.440
but if you go to curiositystream.com slash Lindsey

00:36.440 --> 00:41.440
and use the code Lindsey, it's only 1479 for the year,

00:41.840 --> 00:45.760
and you get access to our streaming service, Nebula.

00:45.760 --> 00:48.460
So go to curiositystream.com slash Lindsey,

00:48.460 --> 00:50.940
use the code, which is also just my name,

00:50.940 --> 00:54.480
and in the meantime, Loki.

00:54.480 --> 00:57.560
I'm asking for safe passage through the anus.

00:57.560 --> 01:01.360
So the MCU's hop to TV show has been preoccupied

01:01.360 --> 01:03.260
with mental health, huh?

01:03.260 --> 01:06.920
James, why does Sam aggravate you?

01:06.920 --> 01:09.520
And don't say something childish.

01:09.520 --> 01:11.620
First we had trauma as manifested

01:11.620 --> 01:14.520
by sci-fi magic and WandaVision.

01:14.520 --> 01:17.200
Look, we've all been there, right?

01:17.200 --> 01:19.780
Letting our fear and anger get the best of us,

01:19.780 --> 01:21.600
intentionally expanding the borders

01:21.600 --> 01:23.360
of the false world we created.

01:23.360 --> 01:24.200
Ahh!

01:32.040 --> 01:36.440
Then we had PTSD and more trauma and lots of therapy

01:36.440 --> 01:38.100
with Falcon and the Winter Soldier.

01:38.100 --> 01:40.020
Look, you've got to nurture friendships.

01:40.020 --> 01:43.000
I am the only person you have called all week.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.240
That is so sad.

01:46.060 --> 01:47.880
But then we took an interesting turn

01:47.880 --> 01:50.520
into a mental disorder that is extremely popular

01:50.520 --> 01:53.960
as a character trait, but rarely discussed in fiction

01:53.960 --> 01:55.900
with Loki.

01:58.240 --> 01:59.800
I'm a narcissist.

01:59.800 --> 02:01.420
And then of course there was all this discourse

02:01.420 --> 02:04.100
reacting to the text of the show.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.320
Is Loki a narcissist?

02:06.320 --> 02:10.140
What a incredible seismic narcissist.

02:10.140 --> 02:12.940
Narcissism or narcissistic personality disorders

02:12.940 --> 02:15.360
is one of the more common personality disorders.

02:15.360 --> 02:16.620
So it is kind of surprising

02:16.620 --> 02:18.400
that it is so widely misunderstood,

02:18.400 --> 02:20.280
especially in light of other mental illnesses

02:20.880 --> 02:23.640
like bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder

02:23.640 --> 02:26.100
or PTSD, gaining much wider awareness

02:26.100 --> 02:27.560
in the last two decades.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.600
Most people don't seem to have a lot of interest in it

02:29.600 --> 02:31.480
outside of demonizing it.

02:31.480 --> 02:35.320
Usually because they know a narcissist or several

02:35.320 --> 02:37.280
and the perception of what NPD is

02:37.280 --> 02:39.180
is basically that of a psychopath

02:39.180 --> 02:41.200
with particularly high self-esteem.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.840
Narcissists are primarily defined by their lack of empathy.

02:43.840 --> 02:47.760
You know what happens when someone upsets me.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.160
See how I do it.

02:49.160 --> 02:51.760
So there are so many fictional narcissists in media.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.840
Narcissists make great antagonists

02:53.840 --> 02:56.840
and often sometimes even fun protagonists.

02:56.840 --> 02:59.660
This perfect world begins and ends with me.

02:59.660 --> 03:01.540
It's fun to watch characters who are blind

03:01.540 --> 03:03.760
to their own faults and lack self-awareness.

03:03.760 --> 03:06.040
Something less conspicuous.

03:06.040 --> 03:08.040
Processing, processing.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.160
Why am I so amazing?

03:12.160 --> 03:15.080
In comedies, narcissists are, well, comedy gold

03:15.080 --> 03:16.900
because we get to enjoy the juxtaposition

03:16.900 --> 03:18.700
of how they see themselves

03:18.700 --> 03:21.100
versus the reality of how other people see them.

03:21.100 --> 03:23.520
You know, desire smells like that to some people.

03:23.520 --> 03:24.360
What is that?

03:24.360 --> 03:27.260
It smells like a turd covered in burnt hair.

03:27.260 --> 03:29.720
The MCU has several prominent characters

03:29.720 --> 03:32.280
to which the word narcissist has been applied.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.060
Obviously, Loki is up there.

03:34.060 --> 03:35.940
Then of course there's Thanos.

03:35.940 --> 03:38.580
Thanos exercises power to wipe out half the universe

03:38.580 --> 03:40.540
because he believes he is the only one

03:40.540 --> 03:43.540
with the right solution to what he sees as a sickness.

03:43.540 --> 03:44.900
And of course he sees his children

03:44.900 --> 03:47.860
as an extension of himself and loves them.

03:47.860 --> 03:50.440
If you're saying I play favorites, you're wrong.

03:50.440 --> 03:52.320
I love all my children equally.

03:53.540 --> 03:55.300
I don't care for Nebula.

03:56.740 --> 03:58.980
Loves them extremely conditionally.

03:58.980 --> 04:00.860
In order to take the stone,

04:00.860 --> 04:03.380
you must lose that which you love.

04:03.380 --> 04:06.260
You failed because you love nothing.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.120
No one.

04:08.960 --> 04:12.460
["You Will Be In My Heart"]

04:15.500 --> 04:19.080
Hell, one of the main characters of the MCU, Tony Stark,

04:19.080 --> 04:21.400
debatably tiptoes up to the line

04:21.400 --> 04:23.520
of qualifying for the disorder.

04:23.520 --> 04:26.200
It is one thing to question the official story

04:26.200 --> 04:28.540
and another thing entirely to make wild accusations

04:28.540 --> 04:30.620
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

04:30.620 --> 04:32.280
I never said you were a superhero.

04:32.280 --> 04:33.120
Didn't?

04:33.120 --> 04:33.940
Mm-mm.

04:33.940 --> 04:37.760
Well, good, because that would be outlandish and fantastic.

04:37.760 --> 04:40.000
In order to better understand what the disorder is,

04:40.000 --> 04:42.020
before we get into Loki,

04:42.020 --> 04:44.360
let's walk through what might qualify someone

04:44.360 --> 04:47.360
for having NPD using everyone's favorite

04:47.360 --> 04:50.120
narcissistic mother, Lucille Bluth.

04:50.120 --> 04:53.280
Everything I do is so dramatic and flamboyant.

04:53.280 --> 04:56.680
It just makes me wanna set myself on fire.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.540
Narcissistic personality disorder is defined

04:59.540 --> 05:01.160
by the presence of at least five

05:01.160 --> 05:03.200
of the following nine criteria,

05:03.200 --> 05:05.360
a grandiose sense of self-importance.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.200
What the hell was I supposed to do?

05:07.200 --> 05:09.840
Michael Moore confronted me in front of the whole country.

05:09.840 --> 05:10.680
First of all, it wasn't Michael Moore.

05:10.680 --> 05:12.000
It was a Michael Moore lookalike,

05:12.000 --> 05:13.720
and it wasn't in front of the whole country.

05:13.720 --> 05:15.700
It was for a bit when Jimmy came alive.

05:16.640 --> 05:19.120
I don't know who that is, and I don't care to find out.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.520
A preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success,

05:21.520 --> 05:24.080
power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.280
Tell me the truth, okay?

05:25.280 --> 05:27.640
Because there's been a lot of lying in this family.

05:27.640 --> 05:29.320
And a lot of love.

05:29.320 --> 05:31.640
A belief that he or she is special and unique

05:31.640 --> 05:34.000
and can only be understood by or should associate

05:34.000 --> 05:37.520
with other special or high-status people or institutions.

05:37.520 --> 05:39.480
Are you aware that we've been downgraded

05:39.480 --> 05:42.120
to being just pool members at the club now?

05:42.120 --> 05:44.000
Yeah, it's a real shame what's going on with this family.

05:44.000 --> 05:44.920
You're stuck by the pool,

05:44.920 --> 05:46.840
and Dad's getting picked last for softball.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.280
A need for excessive admiration.

05:49.280 --> 05:50.520
It's not just Mother Boy.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.780
It's Mother Boy 30.

05:52.780 --> 05:55.320
And I think with you, I've got a shot.

05:55.320 --> 05:57.200
A sense of entitlement.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.360
What's Spanish for?

05:58.360 --> 05:59.680
I know you speak English.

05:59.680 --> 06:02.840
Interpersonally exploitative behavior.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.280
Did you and Dad adopt a child?

06:05.280 --> 06:07.280
He must have forged my signature.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.960
Well, then maybe I'll get a son

06:08.960 --> 06:11.680
who will finish his cottage cheese.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.520
A lack of empathy.

06:13.520 --> 06:15.240
I want to cry so bad,

06:16.480 --> 06:18.720
I don't think I can spare the moisture.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.480
One lousy cigar rip.

06:20.480 --> 06:24.360
Oh, honey, they're just heels.

06:24.360 --> 06:26.920
They can only support so much weight.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.440
Envy of others or a belief

06:28.440 --> 06:30.960
that others are envious of him or her.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.080
She's trying to prove

06:32.080 --> 06:34.360
that she's closer to my children than I am,

06:34.360 --> 06:35.200
but the joke's on her

06:35.200 --> 06:37.960
because she doesn't know how little I care for Joe.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.560
A demonstration of arrogant

06:39.560 --> 06:42.000
and haughty behaviors or attitudes.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.200
Take it back.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.120
If I wanted something your thumb touched,

06:45.120 --> 06:46.840
I'd eat the inside of your ear.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.000
So these are just the DSM criteria,

06:49.000 --> 06:51.520
but there are many more behaviors and symptoms

06:51.520 --> 06:53.760
associated with the disorder.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.840
I know when I'm not wanted.

06:55.840 --> 06:58.600
Narcissists don't feel responsible for their own conduct,

06:58.600 --> 07:00.360
but they will always hold others accountable

07:00.360 --> 07:02.640
for any transgression, real or imagined.

07:02.640 --> 07:04.920
Narcissists have an almost comically short memory

07:04.920 --> 07:06.200
for their own behaviors

07:06.200 --> 07:07.880
and will frequently rewrite history

07:07.880 --> 07:09.240
to suit their own narrative.

07:09.240 --> 07:11.400
I put the fires out.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.480
You made them worse.

07:13.480 --> 07:16.400
Worse or better?

07:17.280 --> 07:19.520
Narcissists are also perpetual victims.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.640
They often use the language of social justice

07:21.640 --> 07:24.600
to reassure others that their victimhood is quite real.

07:24.600 --> 07:28.280
That palace you live in, up there on that hill.

07:28.280 --> 07:32.000
I gave my life to my children on a silver platter.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.280
The admiration of others is a salve to shield them

07:34.280 --> 07:35.880
from the perception of vulnerability.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.640
It's important to remember that victimhood

07:37.640 --> 07:40.480
and vulnerability are not the same thing.

07:40.480 --> 07:41.760
I was the world's nicest guy

07:41.760 --> 07:43.560
and they ruined my life for no reason.

07:43.560 --> 07:46.000
See, just like I said, I'm the victim here.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.720
But while narcissists frequently frame themselves

07:48.720 --> 07:50.240
as the victims of injustice,

07:50.240 --> 07:53.120
they tend to be outraged when other people claim victimhood,

07:53.120 --> 07:55.520
especially when it counters their own narrative.

07:55.520 --> 07:56.800
You are fake crying.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.120
That is not real.

07:58.120 --> 08:00.040
As a victim of abuse myself.

08:00.040 --> 08:01.800
Oh my God.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.640
You are so manipulative.

08:03.640 --> 08:05.120
God, oh my God.

08:05.120 --> 08:06.040
I was molested.

08:06.040 --> 08:07.840
I have been, oh my gosh.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.560
I've learned I am an empath, right?

08:09.560 --> 08:11.560
Narcissists also aren't capable of love

08:11.560 --> 08:13.720
in the way that neurotypical people are,

08:13.720 --> 08:16.000
which is why it's so hard for the children of narcissists

08:16.000 --> 08:18.520
to admit that their parents are in fact narcissists

08:18.520 --> 08:19.800
because it's difficult to accept

08:19.800 --> 08:21.360
that your parent doesn't really love you

08:21.360 --> 08:23.000
in a way that a parent should

08:23.000 --> 08:25.200
because narcissistic parents don't see their children

08:25.240 --> 08:28.560
as autonomous people, but as extensions of themselves.

08:28.560 --> 08:32.640
I see a strong, confident, beautiful young lady.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.080
Oh look, you're here too.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.880
I'm just teasing.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.160
Stop taking everything so seriously.

08:39.160 --> 08:40.960
Narcissists seek affection and approval,

08:40.960 --> 08:44.040
but remain indifferent to any harm they themselves cause.

08:44.040 --> 08:46.360
Interpersonal boundaries to a narcissist

08:46.360 --> 08:47.920
are a form of abuse.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.720
After everything I've done for you.

08:50.720 --> 08:53.040
That I didn't ask for.

08:53.040 --> 08:57.040
Do you have any idea of the work you're undoing?

08:57.040 --> 08:58.880
Love to a narcissist isn't caring

08:58.880 --> 09:02.480
for another person's emotional needs, but controlling them.

09:02.480 --> 09:05.480
Suddenly he's too much of a big shot to brush mother's hair.

09:05.480 --> 09:06.320
Well, I'm not.

09:09.680 --> 09:10.600
Now with all that said,

09:10.600 --> 09:14.240
there are a lot of common misconceptions of narcissism.

09:14.240 --> 09:15.840
The first is that all narcissists

09:15.840 --> 09:17.240
are extremely self-confident.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.240
They're all so beautiful.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.560
Why don't I have three heads?

09:22.560 --> 09:24.360
Oh, this is funny.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.200
This is not true.

09:26.200 --> 09:28.800
What appears as confidence is often a thin veneer,

09:28.800 --> 09:31.840
hiding feelings of shame, self-doubt and self-hatred.

09:31.840 --> 09:35.320
Obsessive self-loathing is a form of narcissism.

09:35.320 --> 09:37.880
Narcissists are usually oblivious to hurt they cause others.

09:37.880 --> 09:40.120
Often hurtful behavior is just collateral damage

09:40.120 --> 09:41.840
to having their emotional needs met.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.240
I do everything I can to help you.

09:45.560 --> 09:48.320
And all you can do is drink and talk nonsense

09:48.320 --> 09:50.120
and frighten me.

09:50.120 --> 09:51.920
Go back to bed.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.560
Narcissists are evil.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.800
I told Dwight that there is honor in losing,

09:56.800 --> 09:58.960
which as we all know is completely ridiculous,

09:58.960 --> 10:03.320
but there is however honor in making a loser feel better,

10:03.320 --> 10:05.480
which is what I just did for Dwight.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.240
The reality is that narcissists may behave

10:07.240 --> 10:09.880
in hurtful ways, but they are not inherently evil.

10:09.880 --> 10:12.520
Would I rather be feared or loved?

10:13.680 --> 10:14.640
Easy, both.

10:15.480 --> 10:18.400
I want people to be afraid of how much they love me.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.760
Narcissistic personality disorder does not implicate

10:20.760 --> 10:23.040
any kind of off-kilter moral barometer.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.480
There's nothing wrong with a narcissist's impulse control

10:25.480 --> 10:27.480
or their ability to tell right from wrong.

10:27.480 --> 10:28.840
Quite the opposite in some ways.

10:28.840 --> 10:31.800
Narcissists are not only able to discern right from wrong,

10:31.800 --> 10:33.800
they for the most part want to do right,

10:33.800 --> 10:36.040
again, because they want to be liked.

10:36.040 --> 10:38.680
For me to be attracted to a woman,

10:38.680 --> 10:41.280
she has to be as intelligent or slightly less intelligent

10:41.280 --> 10:43.560
than me, and she is, you know.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.200
Narcissists all come from a background of privilege.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.840
People have a very specific idea

10:47.840 --> 10:50.000
that narcissists come from a certain background.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.520
They are privileged, they come from wealth and power,

10:52.520 --> 10:54.440
and that is sometimes true,

10:54.440 --> 10:57.240
but anyone from any background can develop the disorder.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.320
Although there is no one cause for narcissism,

10:59.320 --> 11:00.640
it rarely emerges in people

11:00.640 --> 11:02.720
who come from stable, loving families.

11:02.720 --> 11:05.200
I'd rather smother them with a pillow

11:05.200 --> 11:06.800
than take them to Nevada!

11:06.800 --> 11:08.560
Always with the drama!

11:08.560 --> 11:11.000
It is often the result of trauma or emotional neglect,

11:11.000 --> 11:12.800
and for those who perceive wealth and power,

11:12.800 --> 11:13.920
the wealth and power is used

11:13.920 --> 11:16.160
to shield an incredibly fragile ego.

11:16.160 --> 11:18.880
You clearly don't know who you're talking to,

11:18.880 --> 11:20.520
so let me clue you in.

11:20.520 --> 11:22.760
I am not in danger, Skyler.

11:22.760 --> 11:24.600
I am the danger.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.240
A guy opens his door and gets shot,

11:26.240 --> 11:27.720
and you think that of me?

11:27.720 --> 11:28.880
No.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.680
I am the one who knocks!

11:30.680 --> 11:32.360
But one of the more common misconceptions

11:32.360 --> 11:35.000
is the conflation of narcissism with psychopathy,

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
this idea that narcissists don't experience hurt or pain

11:38.000 --> 11:40.480
or even their own, you know, version of love.

11:40.480 --> 11:44.920
When you leave my heart

11:44.920 --> 11:47.320
narcissists, especially female narcissists,

11:47.320 --> 11:49.760
actually live in a constant state of anxiety,

11:49.760 --> 11:51.520
and boy, do they want you to know that.

11:51.520 --> 11:54.280
Hope you have children of your own

11:54.280 --> 11:56.560
and they treat you like this.

11:56.560 --> 11:59.960
They gave my life to my children on a silver platter.

11:59.960 --> 12:00.920
This is bullshit.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.160
So here's why narcissists aren't just psychopaths

12:03.160 --> 12:04.280
with high self-esteem.

12:04.280 --> 12:05.360
Psychopaths don't really care

12:05.360 --> 12:06.440
what other people think of them.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.040
They don't care about their lives

12:08.040 --> 12:09.560
and they don't experience empathy,

12:09.560 --> 12:12.120
where a narcissist is defined by a preoccupation

12:12.120 --> 12:13.760
with what other people think of them.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.440
They are constantly reshaping themselves

12:15.440 --> 12:18.280
to fit whatever mold they think will serve them best.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.440
I'm Prison Mike.

12:20.960 --> 12:23.120
You know why they call me Prison Mike?

12:23.120 --> 12:25.520
Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else?

12:25.520 --> 12:27.920
Do you really expect me to not push you up

12:27.920 --> 12:29.400
against the wall, beotch?

12:29.400 --> 12:31.560
Some narcissists do this by being charming.

12:31.560 --> 12:34.840
I am a writer, a doctor, a nuclear physicist,

12:34.840 --> 12:36.440
a theoretical philosopher.

12:38.480 --> 12:40.240
But above all, I am a man.

12:40.240 --> 12:44.960
You're a hopelessly inquisitive man, just like you.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.680
Some by being manipulative.

12:46.680 --> 12:49.120
Tears aren't a woman's only weapon.

12:50.800 --> 12:54.480
Some by being controlling and some downright authoritarian.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.840
It's the unspoken truth of humanity

12:57.840 --> 13:00.600
that you crave subjugation.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.440
But a true narcissist doesn't live

13:02.440 --> 13:04.520
in a state of cold self-assuredness.

13:04.520 --> 13:06.560
Rather, they live in a constant state of anxiety

13:06.560 --> 13:07.680
and hypervigilance.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.120
You don't know what goes through this mind of mine.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.640
Well, that's for fucking sure.

13:11.640 --> 13:14.320
But narcissism in itself is not unhealthy.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.200
There is what is called healthy narcissism

13:16.200 --> 13:19.320
and it is healthy to exhibit some narcissistic traits.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.360
You do actually need some narcissism

13:21.360 --> 13:23.040
for a healthy functioning psyche.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.840
And that is the sort of thing that lets you stand up

13:24.840 --> 13:27.320
for yourself when you're being treated unfairly.

13:27.320 --> 13:30.840
I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki.

13:30.840 --> 13:34.840
The next time you raise a hand to me

13:34.840 --> 13:37.440
will be the last time you have hands.

13:37.440 --> 13:39.960
So with all that groundwork out of the way,

13:40.800 --> 13:44.160
the big question, is Loki a narcissist?

13:44.160 --> 13:47.160
Sorry about that time I turned you into a frog.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.760
It was a wonderful joke.

13:48.760 --> 13:51.240
Was indeed hilarious.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.160
Well, depends on which Loki.

13:53.160 --> 13:55.080
The most lovable version of Loki,

13:55.080 --> 13:56.800
the Loki from Thor Ragnarok.

13:56.800 --> 13:59.960
I have been falling for 30 minutes.

13:59.960 --> 14:02.040
Is probably the most narcissistic.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.400
The movie begins with him watching a plague

14:04.400 --> 14:07.120
glorifying his part in the previous film.

14:07.160 --> 14:10.040
I'm sorry about that thing with the Tesseract.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.920
I just couldn't help myself.

14:11.920 --> 14:12.760
I'm a trickster.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.600
This is so mischievous.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.200
He spends the entire movie

14:16.200 --> 14:18.480
caring not at all about Thor

14:18.480 --> 14:21.520
or whatever is going on in Sakaar.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.080
Feels no empathy for Thor

14:23.080 --> 14:24.680
when he's getting the shit kicked out of him.

14:24.680 --> 14:27.680
In fact, enjoys it as a form of retribution.

14:28.920 --> 14:31.280
That's how it feels.

14:31.280 --> 14:32.920
I'm just a huge fan of the sport.

14:32.920 --> 14:36.040
And in the end, any altruistic action he takes

14:36.040 --> 14:39.960
is ultimately because it's the best action for him.

14:39.960 --> 14:42.280
Suddenly you're overcome with an urge to do the right thing.

14:42.280 --> 14:43.480
Heavens no.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.120
I ran out of faith with the Grandmaster

14:45.120 --> 14:47.160
and in exchange for codes and access to a ship,

14:47.160 --> 14:50.320
I'm asking for safe passage through the anus.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.840
And sure, he saves the day at the end,

14:51.840 --> 14:53.800
but not out of a sense of empathy,

14:53.800 --> 14:56.880
but out of the correct sense that this path

14:56.880 --> 14:59.280
is the one that will get him the most adulation.

14:59.280 --> 15:03.560
Your savior is here!

15:03.560 --> 15:06.760
Contrast this with the Loki in Loki.

15:06.760 --> 15:08.640
He displays narcissistic traits,

15:08.640 --> 15:11.120
but basically completely falls short

15:11.120 --> 15:14.280
of having the disorder in the very first episode.

15:14.280 --> 15:17.280
I don't enjoy hurting people.

15:18.280 --> 15:22.120
I do it because I have to,

15:22.120 --> 15:23.520
because I've had to.

15:23.520 --> 15:26.240
It's the cruel, elaborate trick

15:26.240 --> 15:29.320
counted by the weak to inspire fear.

15:29.320 --> 15:31.560
A desperate play for control.

15:31.600 --> 15:34.440
He loves his mother, not as an extension of himself,

15:34.440 --> 15:37.960
but for her own sake and is protective of her safety.

15:37.960 --> 15:38.800
Where is he?

15:38.800 --> 15:39.880
Now why don't you tell me,

15:39.880 --> 15:42.120
do you enjoy hurting people?

15:42.120 --> 15:42.960
I don't believe you.

15:42.960 --> 15:43.800
Do you enjoy killing?

15:43.800 --> 15:44.640
I'll kill you.

15:44.640 --> 15:46.240
What, like you did your mother?

15:48.240 --> 15:50.440
Sylvie is self-taught, but Loki.

15:50.440 --> 15:53.080
Someone taught you fairly decent magic.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.080
My mother.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.560
Then there's the interaction with Sif

15:55.560 --> 15:56.960
where he comes to a conclusion

15:56.960 --> 15:59.200
about his personal failings on his own.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.560
I crave attention because I'm,

16:04.840 --> 16:06.920
I'm a narcissist.

16:06.920 --> 16:09.040
It's because I'm scared of being alone.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.320
A true narcissist would continue to deflect blame

16:11.320 --> 16:13.120
when confronted with all of the timeline stuff

16:13.120 --> 16:14.400
he had in store for him.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.960
He wouldn't accept responsibility,

16:15.960 --> 16:18.400
and he certainly wouldn't have an honest come to Jesus moment

16:18.400 --> 16:20.360
after being punched in the head 400 times

16:20.360 --> 16:21.680
by the same person.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.320
I'm a narcissist.

16:23.320 --> 16:24.800
He might say something manipulative

16:24.800 --> 16:26.480
to get her to stop hitting,

16:26.480 --> 16:28.280
but the Sif time loop would not bring about

16:28.320 --> 16:31.240
an honest moment of self-reflection in a true narcissist.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.840
Again, narcissists are eternal victims.

16:33.840 --> 16:36.320
They are pathologically incapable of self-reflection

16:36.320 --> 16:38.040
if it doesn't come from an outside source

16:38.040 --> 16:39.240
that they care about.

16:39.240 --> 16:41.840
Also, vulnerability is anathema to a narcissist,

16:41.840 --> 16:45.160
but Loki allows himself to be vulnerable several times.

16:45.160 --> 16:47.640
Most relevant to the discussion in The Discourse,

16:47.640 --> 16:49.320
and indeed in the show itself,

16:49.320 --> 16:53.520
is what he sees in Sylvie, his alternate universe self,

16:53.520 --> 16:55.480
specifically in the moments before he thinks

16:55.480 --> 16:56.840
they're both about to die.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.000
You were just a child when the TVA took you,

16:59.000 --> 17:00.760
but you nearly took down the organization

17:00.760 --> 17:03.040
that claims to govern the order of time.

17:03.040 --> 17:04.120
You did it on your own.

17:04.120 --> 17:05.480
You had rings around them.

17:05.480 --> 17:06.400
You're amazing.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.880
Clearly there are elements of him looking at her

17:09.880 --> 17:12.520
and seeing aspects of what he could have been,

17:12.520 --> 17:15.360
but ultimately the virtues that he appreciates in Sylvie

17:15.360 --> 17:17.960
aren't really virtues that he shares.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.640
A common tactic when narcissists compliment other people

17:20.640 --> 17:23.360
is that they are really complimenting themselves,

17:23.360 --> 17:25.200
but Loki isn't doing that here.

17:25.200 --> 17:28.480
Like, they're variations on the same person,

17:28.480 --> 17:31.480
but they are still two completely different people.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.680
The contradiction of Loki as a show

17:33.680 --> 17:35.360
is that much of the tension

17:35.360 --> 17:38.000
comes from Loki's history of narcissism.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.640
His history of narcissism

17:39.640 --> 17:41.600
is what makes him the most likely in the room

17:41.600 --> 17:43.840
to betray anyone at any given point.

17:43.840 --> 17:46.160
You're really good at doing awful things

17:46.160 --> 17:48.360
and then just getting away.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.200
What can I say?

17:49.200 --> 17:51.080
I'm a mischievous scamp.

17:51.080 --> 17:51.920
While at the same time,

17:51.960 --> 17:54.080
Loki is most likely to do whatever it takes

17:54.080 --> 17:55.960
to be liked or gain power.

17:55.960 --> 17:58.640
There's this constant tension of will he betray Mobius?

17:58.640 --> 18:00.320
Will he betray Sylvie?

18:00.320 --> 18:01.480
Mobius, come on.

18:01.480 --> 18:02.880
What could possibly go wrong?

18:02.880 --> 18:04.600
We gotta properly test this theory.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.080
Well, here's a fun theory.

18:06.080 --> 18:07.400
You lure me out into the field

18:07.400 --> 18:08.840
and then you stab me in the back,

18:08.840 --> 18:10.720
and that's a theory I don't wanna test.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.560
I can't sleep in a place like this.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.840
You can't sleep on a train?

18:14.840 --> 18:17.680
No, I can't sleep around untrustworthy people.

18:17.680 --> 18:18.520
But in the end,

18:18.520 --> 18:20.160
aside from a couple of very justified moments

18:20.160 --> 18:21.400
of self-preservation,

18:21.400 --> 18:24.280
the Loki in the TV show betrays nobody.

18:24.280 --> 18:28.520
Six episodes, nary a betrayal that wasn't earned.

18:28.520 --> 18:29.360
I'm staying.

18:32.560 --> 18:33.760
Which is why the ending,

18:33.760 --> 18:36.320
Sylvie's assumption that he intends to betray her

18:36.320 --> 18:39.400
while the rando at the end of time chews the scenery,

18:39.400 --> 18:42.440
makes the conclusion of the show ring kind of hollow.

18:45.600 --> 18:46.760
You want the throne.

18:47.760 --> 18:48.680
No.

18:48.680 --> 18:50.400
No, Sylvie, this does not comport

18:50.440 --> 18:52.320
with the person that you have been interacting with

18:52.320 --> 18:53.520
during this series.

18:53.520 --> 18:54.960
That's what you think of me.

18:56.520 --> 18:58.240
After all this time.

18:58.240 --> 18:59.360
Sure, why not?

19:00.960 --> 19:03.040
Evil Loki's master plan comes together.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.320
Because the Loki you have been interacting with

19:05.320 --> 19:07.440
never acted like a self-serving narcissist.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.440
He's actually pretty self-sacrificial.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.200
You've both risked your life for each other

19:11.200 --> 19:13.240
several times by now.

19:13.240 --> 19:15.040
Loki, I don't even know if this is gonna work.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.680
You go, I go.

19:17.680 --> 19:19.680
It's almost like you've been watching all the movies

19:19.680 --> 19:21.400
we saw before this.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.880
So from movie to movie to TV show,

19:22.880 --> 19:23.720
I think it's fair to say

19:23.720 --> 19:25.920
that Loki's writing is inconsistent.

19:25.920 --> 19:27.440
NPD is not a disorder

19:27.440 --> 19:29.600
that you can character arc your way out of.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.440
By definition, it is incurable.

19:31.440 --> 19:34.240
So if you want to incorporate the Loki of Disney plus Loki

19:34.240 --> 19:35.920
into Loki's greater journey,

19:35.920 --> 19:37.880
but I don't think he's badly written,

19:37.880 --> 19:40.640
but he's not an honest portrayal of a narcissist.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.160
Ten is a true narcissist.

19:42.160 --> 19:44.320
I give him a seven, maybe an eight.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.040
Absolutely not.

19:46.040 --> 19:48.120
This is fine and guardian leather.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.000
But this is not to say that the MCU

19:50.000 --> 19:52.680
doesn't have anything meaningful to say about narcissism.

19:52.680 --> 19:55.400
The best, most honest portrayal in the MCU of a narcissist

19:55.400 --> 19:59.320
is not Loki, nor is it Thanos, but...

19:59.320 --> 20:00.720
My name is Ego,

20:02.720 --> 20:04.280
and I'm your dad, Peter.

20:06.280 --> 20:07.840
Uh-oh, have we found an excuse

20:07.840 --> 20:10.800
to fawn over Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 again?

20:10.800 --> 20:12.920
Yes, yes, yes, yes, we have.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.160
I thought Yondu was your father.

20:15.160 --> 20:16.560
You look exactly alike.

20:16.560 --> 20:17.920
One's blue.

20:20.240 --> 20:21.480
So in a lot of ways,

20:21.480 --> 20:24.040
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the rare movie

20:24.040 --> 20:26.680
that makes the first one better in retrospect.

20:26.680 --> 20:29.040
A lot of the boomer nostalgia from the first movie

20:29.040 --> 20:31.760
that just felt kind of random and atmospheric

20:31.760 --> 20:34.120
and maybe a little pandery.

20:34.120 --> 20:37.320
Ooh, child, things will get brighter.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.760
Then bring it down hard.

20:38.760 --> 20:40.680
Now, with the context of the second movie,

20:40.680 --> 20:42.120
feels a lot more thoughtful.

20:42.120 --> 20:43.880
Take, for instance, the soundtracks

20:43.880 --> 20:45.640
and the song in Guardians 2

20:45.640 --> 20:47.400
that serves as a through line.

20:51.240 --> 20:54.160
You know Brandy by Looking Glass?

20:54.160 --> 20:55.920
On first blush when we first meet

20:55.920 --> 20:58.520
CGIDH Kurt Russell in Peter's Mom,

20:58.520 --> 21:01.120
you're like, yeah, that's a fun 70s love song.

21:01.120 --> 21:02.040
How quaint.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.920
I will take one nostalgia, please.

21:03.920 --> 21:08.120
This is brandy, such a motherland.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.360
But as the movie unfolds,

21:09.360 --> 21:11.960
the ugly undertones become more and more apparent.

21:16.640 --> 21:20.520
You know, Peter, you and I, we're the sailor in that song.

21:20.520 --> 21:23.440
The sailor in the song doesn't care about Brandy at all.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.880
He's all about his own pleasure, his own goals,

21:25.880 --> 21:28.880
and he frames it like it's a good, fun thing.

21:28.880 --> 21:33.440
See calls upon him as history calls upon great men.

21:33.440 --> 21:35.360
There is zero remorse in the song,

21:35.360 --> 21:36.960
which is why we're here today.

21:36.960 --> 21:39.040
We're going to be together for a long time.

21:39.040 --> 21:40.960
We're going to be together for a long time.

21:40.960 --> 21:43.200
We're going to be together for a long time.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.560
There is zero remorse in the song,

21:45.560 --> 21:47.560
which is why Ego is drawn to it,

21:47.560 --> 21:49.080
and to a certain extent, Peter.

21:49.080 --> 21:52.120
It was one of Earth's greatest musical compositions.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.120
Perhaps it's very greatest.

21:54.120 --> 21:55.280
Yeah, yes.

21:55.280 --> 21:58.040
Guardians 2 is about family, what makes one,

21:58.040 --> 22:00.040
but largely it's also about how Ego

22:00.040 --> 22:01.920
negatively affects relationships,

22:01.920 --> 22:03.760
both the literal character ego

22:03.760 --> 22:05.920
and the concept of narcissism itself.

22:05.920 --> 22:09.000
They told me you people were conceited douchebags,

22:09.000 --> 22:11.040
but that isn't true at all.

22:11.040 --> 22:12.480
Rocket steals batteries

22:12.480 --> 22:14.640
because the Sovereign offended his ego.

22:14.640 --> 22:16.880
The Sovereign's motivation for revenge

22:16.880 --> 22:19.240
throughout the entire movie is ego.

22:19.240 --> 22:21.840
Our concern is they're slight against our people.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.920
Peter and Rocket nearly kill everybody

22:23.920 --> 22:27.600
trying to prove that they are the superior pilot, Ego.

22:27.600 --> 22:30.680
Gator, we almost died because of your arrogance.

22:30.680 --> 22:33.800
So Ego operates as the perfect portrait of a narcissist.

22:33.800 --> 22:35.840
He can't understand other people's motivations

22:35.840 --> 22:37.360
that don't directly serve him.

22:37.360 --> 22:39.480
But instead of returning you,

22:39.520 --> 22:41.320
Yondu kept you.

22:41.320 --> 22:43.600
I have no clue as to why.

22:43.600 --> 22:46.400
And challenging questions that center other people's needs.

22:46.400 --> 22:47.360
Why didn't you come back?

22:47.360 --> 22:50.360
Why did you send Yondu, a criminal of all people, to come?

22:50.360 --> 22:51.920
Well, we're just gonna change the subject.

22:51.920 --> 22:53.880
I've made many mistakes, Peter,

22:55.120 --> 22:56.880
but you're not one of them.

22:56.880 --> 23:01.880
There's so much that I need to teach you about this planet.

23:01.880 --> 23:04.480
But at the same time, Ego is also good at charming people.

23:04.480 --> 23:07.000
And with Peter, he's good at giving Peter validation

23:07.000 --> 23:08.560
that feels like validation,

23:08.560 --> 23:11.360
but really it's just Ego complimenting himself.

23:11.360 --> 23:12.440
Who the hell are you?

23:13.760 --> 23:16.480
Figured my rugged good looks would make that obvious.

23:16.480 --> 23:20.920
I can explain your very special heritage.

23:20.920 --> 23:22.680
Out of all my spawn,

23:23.640 --> 23:27.680
only you carry the connection to the light.

23:27.680 --> 23:28.520
But most of all,

23:28.520 --> 23:31.440
he sees everyone as either an extension of himself

23:31.440 --> 23:33.400
or a potential extension of himself.

23:33.400 --> 23:34.800
Peter is valuable to him

23:34.800 --> 23:37.080
when Peter is willing to perform that role,

23:37.080 --> 23:39.240
but the second he behaves autonomously.

23:39.240 --> 23:42.080
You really need to grow up.

23:46.400 --> 23:49.200
But like Ego, Peter is also extremely narcissistic.

23:49.200 --> 23:51.800
That's why he nearly falls for Ego's plan.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.680
Well, it's because that place was real

23:53.680 --> 23:54.840
and this is a fantasy.

23:54.840 --> 23:55.680
I get it.

23:55.680 --> 23:57.960
You're jealous because I'm part God

23:57.960 --> 23:59.280
and you like when I'm the weak one.

23:59.280 --> 24:02.160
Ego tells him he is special, he's powerful.

24:02.160 --> 24:04.320
And without the planet that is Ego,

24:04.320 --> 24:06.160
he's not special anymore.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.360
You are a God.

24:08.760 --> 24:12.920
If you kill me, you'll be just like everybody else.

24:12.920 --> 24:14.400
Peter's narcissism is the main thing

24:14.400 --> 24:16.320
getting in the way with his relationship with Gamora

24:16.320 --> 24:17.720
because, well,

24:21.040 --> 24:23.560
she's already lived through escaping one narcissist

24:23.560 --> 24:24.400
in her life.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.920
So her hesitation is very understandable.

24:26.920 --> 24:29.080
This is why I hate Infinity War.

24:29.080 --> 24:30.760
Anyway, this line, for instance.

24:30.760 --> 24:31.600
You know what?

24:31.600 --> 24:33.240
This is not Cheers after all.

24:33.240 --> 24:35.400
I don't know what Cheers is!

24:35.400 --> 24:38.000
It's played for laughs, but it's very revealing.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.840
He's whining about his needs and he doesn't even care

24:40.840 --> 24:42.800
that she doesn't know what he's talking about.

24:42.800 --> 24:47.800
My life, my love, my lady is the sea.

24:48.760 --> 24:50.240
There's a lot of heavy stuff in this movie

24:50.240 --> 24:51.920
that is couched in comedy.

24:51.920 --> 24:54.800
Arguably by necessity, because if you seriously mull

24:54.800 --> 24:56.760
on what's happening in certain scenes.

24:56.760 --> 24:59.880
Yondu is the guy who abducted me, kicked the crap out of me

24:59.880 --> 25:02.160
so I could learn to fight and kept me in terror

25:02.160 --> 25:03.560
by threatening to eat me.

25:03.560 --> 25:05.400
It's actually pretty disturbing.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.120
You said you were gonna eat me.

25:07.120 --> 25:10.440
That was being funny, not to me!

25:10.440 --> 25:12.200
But the other side of the coin to the effects

25:12.200 --> 25:14.360
of the narcissistic parent is Mantis,

25:14.360 --> 25:16.640
who is functionally also Ego's child.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.600
He raised me by hand and kept me as his own.

25:20.720 --> 25:21.760
So you're a pet.

25:23.240 --> 25:24.200
I suppose.

25:24.200 --> 25:25.560
Mantis is an empath.

25:25.560 --> 25:27.760
You're empathic, so an empath.

25:27.760 --> 25:28.600
I've heard that before.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.200
I've learned I am an empath, right?

25:30.200 --> 25:31.960
No, Shane, like a real one.

25:31.960 --> 25:33.800
Empaths feel feelings.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.800
Particularly relevant because narcissists

25:35.800 --> 25:37.560
prey on other people's empathy.

25:37.560 --> 25:39.640
Children of narcissistic parents frequently learn

25:39.640 --> 25:41.640
to shape-shift as a survival mechanism.

25:41.640 --> 25:43.400
The first thing Mantis does in the film

25:43.400 --> 25:45.560
is laugh at Drax's practical joke,

25:45.560 --> 25:47.440
even though she clearly hates it.

25:51.440 --> 25:54.320
That is called a practical joke.

25:57.320 --> 25:58.880
He likes it very much.

25:58.880 --> 26:01.520
It's not too boring to say that you're fine

26:01.520 --> 26:02.560
and you're not really fine,

26:02.560 --> 26:04.320
but you just can't get into it because they would-

26:04.320 --> 26:06.160
Children of narcissists tend to either be

26:06.160 --> 26:09.040
pathological pleasers or very cold.

26:09.040 --> 26:11.080
They either exhaust themselves in a lifetime

26:11.080 --> 26:12.760
of trying to please the unpleasable.

26:12.760 --> 26:14.640
A child my father would have Gamora in me

26:14.640 --> 26:16.160
bow to one another in training.

26:17.560 --> 26:20.040
Every time my sister prevailed,

26:20.040 --> 26:22.520
my father would replace a piece of me with machinery.

26:22.520 --> 26:24.240
Or they stonewall everyone they enter

26:24.240 --> 26:25.600
an intimate relationship with

26:25.600 --> 26:26.760
every time there's conflict.

26:26.760 --> 26:29.600
So a lot of Mantis' scenes are couched in comedy

26:29.640 --> 26:31.640
because she is deeply traumatized.

26:31.640 --> 26:33.160
So a lot of the expression of her trauma

26:33.160 --> 26:35.360
is framed for laughs because-

26:35.360 --> 26:37.720
This gross bug lady is my new friend.

26:37.720 --> 26:41.000
I'm learning many things like I'm a pet and ugly.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.880
Otherwise it would be a bit too heavy in a movie like this.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.720
I'm very popular, y'all!

26:45.720 --> 26:49.400
So given the way the MCU utilizes narcissists

26:49.400 --> 26:52.840
slash protagonists who, while not being narcissistic

26:52.840 --> 26:55.520
to the point of disorder, are extremely narcissistic,

26:55.520 --> 26:56.880
there is a success here.

26:56.880 --> 26:59.080
We love narcissistic characters.

26:59.080 --> 27:02.040
We see the narcissism of the protagonist in ourselves

27:02.040 --> 27:05.000
and the narcissism of the villains is just fun to watch.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.040
They are memorable.

27:06.040 --> 27:08.800
I am a god, you dull creature!

27:08.800 --> 27:10.360
And I will not be bullied by-

27:12.760 --> 27:13.880
So it's interesting to me

27:13.880 --> 27:16.880
that we hate IRL narcissists so much.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.000
Why is that?

27:18.000 --> 27:19.480
In some ways, it's the same reason

27:19.480 --> 27:21.600
why addicts loathe alcoholics

27:21.600 --> 27:25.240
or why people with anger issues loathe domestic abusers.

27:25.240 --> 27:26.600
We hate the most in others

27:26.600 --> 27:29.320
the thing we fear the most in ourselves.

27:29.320 --> 27:31.440
So the funny thing about Loki is

27:31.440 --> 27:33.560
we loved Loki, the narcissist,

27:33.560 --> 27:36.920
as long as the word narcissist wasn't trotted out,

27:36.920 --> 27:38.680
because the moment it is trotted out-

27:38.680 --> 27:42.600
What a incredible seismic narcissist!

27:42.600 --> 27:44.760
He has to stop being a narcissist

27:44.760 --> 27:46.320
in order to remain likable.

27:46.320 --> 27:48.320
And then suddenly he's Mr. Empathy.

27:48.320 --> 27:51.240
His behavior is no longer disordered but relatable.

27:51.240 --> 27:52.960
He's no longer a narcissist,

27:52.960 --> 27:55.040
but wrestling with his own narcissism.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.440
This isn't about you.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.160
That said, it's really common for people

28:01.160 --> 28:03.240
to talk about having been in relationships

28:03.240 --> 28:05.480
with people with other personality disorders

28:05.480 --> 28:07.360
and maybe it was extremely difficult,

28:07.360 --> 28:08.800
but they don't talk about those people

28:08.800 --> 28:12.160
in terms of a condition that must be fundamentally avoided.

28:12.160 --> 28:14.280
It's framed as a mental illness.

28:14.280 --> 28:17.280
So why don't we talk about narcissists in the same way?

28:17.280 --> 28:19.360
Why are narcissists always spiders

28:19.360 --> 28:21.040
who capture people in their web

28:21.040 --> 28:23.160
rather than people with behavioral disorders

28:23.160 --> 28:25.800
that don't have the tools to manage their disorder?

28:25.840 --> 28:27.320
The worst thing about narcissists

28:27.320 --> 28:28.840
isn't that they're narcissists.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.680
Most of them want to be good people.

28:30.680 --> 28:32.000
They thrive off validation.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.240
The worst thing about narcissists

28:33.240 --> 28:35.400
is they never seek treatment for their condition,

28:35.400 --> 28:38.720
because they don't want the stigma of being a narcissist.

28:38.720 --> 28:40.560
So therefore, they never admit that they are

28:40.560 --> 28:42.160
and they never stop hurting the people

28:42.160 --> 28:45.560
that they care about, you know, in their way.

28:47.640 --> 28:48.640
This is especially true

28:48.640 --> 28:51.080
for narcissistic parents of adult children.

28:51.080 --> 28:53.560
Why did you adopt me?

28:53.600 --> 28:55.560
Because I wanted someone to love.

28:56.400 --> 28:59.920
Don't you act for me.

28:59.920 --> 29:01.400
Again, this is a really common thing

29:01.400 --> 29:03.760
children of narcissists will notice about their parents.

29:03.760 --> 29:06.040
They believe they're good people doing the right thing

29:06.040 --> 29:07.680
and they just don't understand

29:07.680 --> 29:10.200
why their children don't want to talk to them,

29:10.200 --> 29:13.200
no matter how many times their children have explained it.

29:18.960 --> 29:21.760
Both Yondu and Ego were shit parents.

29:21.800 --> 29:22.960
Ego, the narcissist,

29:22.960 --> 29:26.080
and Yondu, the abusive and neglectful adoptive father.

29:26.080 --> 29:28.840
But in the end, one of them was able to see their child

29:28.840 --> 29:32.320
as more than just an extension of themselves.

29:32.320 --> 29:34.840
And that is what sets him apart as a parent.

29:35.840 --> 29:37.840
I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.

29:39.160 --> 29:41.040
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

29:41.040 --> 29:44.440
So fictional narcissists occupy an interesting space

29:44.440 --> 29:49.120
with regard to the way we engage with real life narcissists.

29:49.120 --> 29:54.120
Frost giants and mad titans and living planets aren't real.

29:54.480 --> 29:57.480
But people with narcissistic personality disorder are.

29:57.480 --> 29:59.240
And according to some studies,

29:59.240 --> 30:04.240
up to 5% of all humans have narcissistic personality disorder.

30:04.320 --> 30:06.960
A lot of people claim to have narcissistic parents,

30:06.960 --> 30:08.520
not because it's trendy,

30:08.520 --> 30:10.600
well, not just because it's trendy,

30:10.600 --> 30:13.360
but also just because it's a really common disorder.

30:13.360 --> 30:15.680
So what have we learned from these fictional examples

30:15.680 --> 30:18.040
of how to deal with narcissists?

30:18.040 --> 30:22.480
Well, either they character arc their way into a cure

30:22.480 --> 30:24.400
or we kill them.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.800
A narcissist can't cure their condition

30:26.800 --> 30:28.440
in the same way that someone

30:28.440 --> 30:32.200
with less stigmatized disorders like major depression

30:32.200 --> 30:34.120
or borderline personality disorder

30:34.120 --> 30:37.200
or bipolar disorder can't cure theirs.

30:37.200 --> 30:40.080
But that doesn't mean they can't evolve

30:40.080 --> 30:41.840
or improve as people.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.440
It's not curable, but it is treatable.

30:44.440 --> 30:47.200
And the hardest hurdle here is usually

30:47.240 --> 30:51.480
to get the narcissist to want treatment in the first place.

30:51.480 --> 30:54.640
So aside from a pretty disappointing last episode,

30:54.640 --> 30:56.480
I really did enjoy Loki

30:56.480 --> 31:00.280
and I don't want to imply that the show is a failure

31:00.280 --> 31:03.040
because it made him less narcissistic

31:03.040 --> 31:06.240
in the service of making him more likable.

31:06.240 --> 31:08.560
I just think that the result is a show

31:08.560 --> 31:11.840
that doesn't have a lot to say about narcissism

31:11.840 --> 31:13.520
despite trying to.

31:13.520 --> 31:15.440
And it leaves me wondering,

31:15.440 --> 31:16.560
is it even possible

31:16.560 --> 31:19.640
to destigmatize narcissistic personality disorder

31:19.640 --> 31:22.680
in the way that things like bipolar disorder

31:22.680 --> 31:25.280
or major depression have lost their stigma

31:25.280 --> 31:26.760
in the last few decades?

31:26.760 --> 31:30.160
And if so, what would that look like?

31:30.160 --> 31:31.960
Disney is an evil mega hydra

31:31.960 --> 31:34.480
that is rapidly covering the land in darkness.

31:34.480 --> 31:36.400
But there is something to be said for the fact

31:36.400 --> 31:39.480
that not only do they feel safe making these narratives,

31:39.480 --> 31:40.480
but that they've turned them

31:40.480 --> 31:42.440
into some of the most popular television

31:42.440 --> 31:44.440
of the streaming era so far.

31:44.440 --> 31:46.520
I didn't really touch on the Falcon and the Winter Soldier

31:46.520 --> 31:49.560
because, honestly, I thought it was pretty boring.

31:49.560 --> 31:50.840
But I do think it's worth mentioning

31:50.840 --> 31:52.360
that this is the only one of these series

31:52.360 --> 31:54.480
that integrates any discussion on therapy

31:54.480 --> 31:56.720
or how to live with mental illness,

31:56.720 --> 31:58.320
which Loki doesn't because, you know,

31:58.320 --> 31:59.640
it's not that kind of show.

31:59.640 --> 32:01.360
Aah!

32:01.360 --> 32:02.600
Aah!

32:02.600 --> 32:05.440
Not every piece of media that deals with mental illness

32:05.440 --> 32:07.160
needs to integrate some portion

32:07.160 --> 32:09.640
about like medication or therapy or whatever.

32:09.640 --> 32:11.240
Are you still having nightmares?

32:15.120 --> 32:16.120
But if you look at these three

32:16.120 --> 32:17.960
and how they all take such different approaches

32:17.960 --> 32:20.160
to exploring mental illness through fiction,

32:20.160 --> 32:22.720
it's interesting that this is such a through line

32:22.720 --> 32:25.120
with the new direction Marvel is going.

32:25.120 --> 32:28.280
Ask your doctor about Nexus,

32:28.280 --> 32:30.960
a unique antidepressant that works to anchor you

32:30.960 --> 32:35.040
back to your reality or the reality of your choice.

32:36.160 --> 32:38.440
Side effects include feeling your feelings,

32:38.440 --> 32:40.640
confronting your truth, seizing your destiny,

32:40.640 --> 32:42.600
and possibly more depression.

32:42.600 --> 32:45.000
Right now, it's less here is the conflict

32:45.000 --> 32:48.280
and more how did the conflict shape these characters?

32:48.280 --> 32:50.120
Which does kind of become a problem

32:50.120 --> 32:52.800
with shows like WandaVision where in the end,

32:52.800 --> 32:55.400
we still kind of have to punch our way out of the conflict.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.920
But whatever, it's been nominated for like 80 Emmys.

32:57.920 --> 32:59.680
Clearly they're doing something right.

32:59.680 --> 33:01.680
And I killed Sparky too.

33:04.320 --> 33:06.160
So I don't want to give Disney too much credit here,

33:06.160 --> 33:08.160
but I think there is some value

33:08.160 --> 33:10.360
to these pop culture artifacts

33:10.360 --> 33:12.160
designed for mass consumption

33:12.160 --> 33:14.160
normalizing these discussions,

33:14.160 --> 33:16.720
because I've seen it help a lot of people

33:16.720 --> 33:19.240
find the language for their own traumas

33:19.240 --> 33:21.560
or even in the case of Loki,

33:21.560 --> 33:24.000
their own relationship to their own narcissism

33:24.000 --> 33:26.920
that maybe they haven't really processed yet.

33:26.920 --> 33:29.160
And I can only surmise that you guys are hungry

33:29.160 --> 33:34.160
for more content about toxic narcissistic parents.

33:34.160 --> 33:36.440
So smooth.

33:36.440 --> 33:37.280
My bad.

33:37.280 --> 33:38.640
So my first book, Axiom's End,

33:38.640 --> 33:40.880
is a Kindle deal of the month.

33:40.880 --> 33:42.920
It's only $2.99 on Amazon

33:42.920 --> 33:44.800
for the entire months of September.

33:44.800 --> 33:46.600
It also just came out in paperback.

33:46.600 --> 33:47.600
There's paperback.

33:48.800 --> 33:49.960
Treat my books very well.

33:49.960 --> 33:51.840
And if you want to know how this ties in

33:51.840 --> 33:53.320
with the theme of narcissistic parents,

33:53.320 --> 33:55.960
well, I guess you'll just have to read it to find out.

33:55.960 --> 33:57.840
And if you're into exploring trauma

33:57.840 --> 34:00.880
using science fiction and aliens and stuff,

34:00.880 --> 34:03.480
my second book comes out on October 12th.

34:03.480 --> 34:05.640
This is not the final version,

34:05.640 --> 34:07.200
so I'm allowed to have used this one.

34:07.200 --> 34:08.440
This is an advanced reader copy.

34:08.440 --> 34:09.800
They throw these in their cycling

34:09.800 --> 34:11.200
once the real book comes out.

34:11.200 --> 34:13.400
Anyway, you can pre-order signed copies of that

34:13.400 --> 34:16.320
in the link below, but maybe you're just not satisfied.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.360
You need more content.

34:18.360 --> 34:20.120
You're insatiable.

34:20.120 --> 34:21.640
And maybe you're wondering,

34:21.640 --> 34:24.120
where do I keep all my videos

34:24.120 --> 34:26.480
that are too spicy for YouTube?

34:26.480 --> 34:28.880
Well, that's where Nebula comes in.

34:28.880 --> 34:30.160
I have several video essays

34:30.160 --> 34:31.840
that you can only watch on Nebula.

34:31.840 --> 34:34.440
The Streamy Award-nominated Nebula,

34:34.440 --> 34:36.440
try saying that five times fast,

34:36.440 --> 34:39.000
is a video streaming platform built for

34:39.040 --> 34:42.840
and by creators like Sarah Z, Maggie Mae Fish,

34:42.840 --> 34:46.280
Big Joel, myself, but not ContraPoints.

34:46.280 --> 34:48.320
And if you want access to my hot takes

34:48.320 --> 34:50.320
that are too spicy for YouTube,

34:50.320 --> 34:53.160
you get access to our streaming service, Nebula,

34:53.160 --> 34:56.560
when you go to curiositystream.com slash Lindsay

34:56.560 --> 34:58.920
and use the code, which is also my name,

34:58.920 --> 35:01.440
and you get access to several Nebula original videos

35:01.440 --> 35:02.760
that I've already made,

35:02.760 --> 35:05.960
exploring topics like Tropic Thunder, comma,

35:05.960 --> 35:08.240
all the trends it destroyed through parody

35:08.240 --> 35:09.360
that were tried too.

35:09.360 --> 35:12.640
And could Blazing Saddles be made today?

35:12.640 --> 35:15.360
God damn it, why are people still asking this?

35:15.360 --> 35:17.680
Excuse me while I whip this out.

35:17.680 --> 35:18.520
Aah!

35:20.240 --> 35:21.280
So thank you for watching.

35:21.280 --> 35:22.440
Thank you for support.

35:22.440 --> 35:24.400
And I'll see you next time.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.680
And suddenly you're overcome with an urge

35:27.680 --> 35:28.520
to do the right thing.

35:28.520 --> 35:29.720
Heavens no.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.360
I ran out of faith with the Grandmaster

35:31.360 --> 35:33.440
and in exchange for codes and access to a ship,

35:33.440 --> 35:36.920
I'm asking for safe passage through the anus.

35:36.920 --> 35:37.760
Through the anus.

35:39.560 --> 35:40.520
Through the anus.

35:42.400 --> 35:43.400
Through the anus.

35:45.160 --> 35:46.960
Why the hell is there an alligator in here?

35:46.960 --> 35:48.760
Through the anus.

35:48.760 --> 35:49.800
Through the anus.

35:50.920 --> 35:51.760
Anus.

35:51.760 --> 35:52.720
I was a king.

35:53.760 --> 35:54.600
The rightful king of-

35:54.600 --> 35:55.440
Anus.

35:58.120 --> 35:59.160
Through the anus.

36:00.680 --> 36:02.840
I still need that anus.

36:02.840 --> 36:04.760
I've come too far for anything else.

36:05.760 --> 36:06.760
Anus.

36:06.760 --> 36:08.760
I am Loki,

36:08.760 --> 36:09.760
the V Asgard.

36:11.240 --> 36:14.160
And I am burdened with glorious anus.

36:14.160 --> 36:15.000
Anus.

36:15.000 --> 36:15.840
Through the anus.

36:15.840 --> 36:16.680
The anus.

36:16.680 --> 36:18.480
That's why I need to get out of here.

36:18.480 --> 36:19.880
The anus.

36:19.880 --> 36:21.720
My army,

36:21.720 --> 36:22.560
my anus.

36:27.280 --> 36:28.800
I have to get off this planet.

36:28.800 --> 36:29.640
Anus.
