14840	16820	Interested in the science of how personality
16820	19240	and mental disorders develop over a lifetime?
19240	21840	Curious Minds Brain Health teams up with neurologists
21840	24600	and neuroscientists to explore how recent advancements
24600	27440	in technology have helped medical professionals diagnose,
27440	29520	describe, and treat some of the common disorders
29520	30720	discussed in this video.
30720	33400	CuriosityStream is normally 1990 year,
33400	36440	but if you go to curiositystream.com slash Lindsey
36440	41440	and use the code Lindsey, it's only 1479 for the year,
41840	45760	and you get access to our streaming service, Nebula.
45760	48460	So go to curiositystream.com slash Lindsey,
48460	50940	use the code, which is also just my name,
50940	54480	and in the meantime, Loki.
54480	57560	I'm asking for safe passage through the anus.
57560	61360	So the MCU's hop to TV show has been preoccupied
61360	63260	with mental health, huh?
63260	66920	James, why does Sam aggravate you?
66920	69520	And don't say something childish.
69520	71620	First we had trauma as manifested
71620	74520	by sci-fi magic and WandaVision.
74520	77200	Look, we've all been there, right?
77200	79780	Letting our fear and anger get the best of us,
79780	81600	intentionally expanding the borders
81600	83360	of the false world we created.
83360	84200	Ahh!
92040	96440	Then we had PTSD and more trauma and lots of therapy
96440	98100	with Falcon and the Winter Soldier.
98100	100020	Look, you've got to nurture friendships.
100020	103000	I am the only person you have called all week.
103000	104240	That is so sad.
106060	107880	But then we took an interesting turn
107880	110520	into a mental disorder that is extremely popular
110520	113960	as a character trait, but rarely discussed in fiction
113960	115900	with Loki.
118240	119800	I'm a narcissist.
119800	121420	And then of course there was all this discourse
121420	124100	reacting to the text of the show.
124100	126320	Is Loki a narcissist?
126320	130140	What a incredible seismic narcissist.
130140	132940	Narcissism or narcissistic personality disorders
132940	135360	is one of the more common personality disorders.
135360	136620	So it is kind of surprising
136620	138400	that it is so widely misunderstood,
138400	140280	especially in light of other mental illnesses
140880	143640	like bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder
143640	146100	or PTSD, gaining much wider awareness
146100	147560	in the last two decades.
147560	149600	Most people don't seem to have a lot of interest in it
149600	151480	outside of demonizing it.
151480	155320	Usually because they know a narcissist or several
155320	157280	and the perception of what NPD is
157280	159180	is basically that of a psychopath
159180	161200	with particularly high self-esteem.
161200	163840	Narcissists are primarily defined by their lack of empathy.
163840	167760	You know what happens when someone upsets me.
167760	169160	See how I do it.
169160	171760	So there are so many fictional narcissists in media.
171760	173840	Narcissists make great antagonists
173840	176840	and often sometimes even fun protagonists.
176840	179660	This perfect world begins and ends with me.
179660	181540	It's fun to watch characters who are blind
181540	183760	to their own faults and lack self-awareness.
183760	186040	Something less conspicuous.
186040	188040	Processing, processing.
189440	192160	Why am I so amazing?
192160	195080	In comedies, narcissists are, well, comedy gold
195080	196900	because we get to enjoy the juxtaposition
196900	198700	of how they see themselves
198700	201100	versus the reality of how other people see them.
201100	203520	You know, desire smells like that to some people.
203520	204360	What is that?
204360	207260	It smells like a turd covered in burnt hair.
207260	209720	The MCU has several prominent characters
209720	212280	to which the word narcissist has been applied.
212280	214060	Obviously, Loki is up there.
214060	215940	Then of course there's Thanos.
215940	218580	Thanos exercises power to wipe out half the universe
218580	220540	because he believes he is the only one
220540	223540	with the right solution to what he sees as a sickness.
223540	224900	And of course he sees his children
224900	227860	as an extension of himself and loves them.
227860	230440	If you're saying I play favorites, you're wrong.
230440	232320	I love all my children equally.
233540	235300	I don't care for Nebula.
236740	238980	Loves them extremely conditionally.
238980	240860	In order to take the stone,
240860	243380	you must lose that which you love.
243380	246260	You failed because you love nothing.
247280	248120	No one.
248960	252460	["You Will Be In My Heart"]
255500	259080	Hell, one of the main characters of the MCU, Tony Stark,
259080	261400	debatably tiptoes up to the line
261400	263520	of qualifying for the disorder.
263520	266200	It is one thing to question the official story
266200	268540	and another thing entirely to make wild accusations
268540	270620	or insinuate that I'm a superhero.
270620	272280	I never said you were a superhero.
272280	273120	Didn't?
273120	273940	Mm-mm.
273940	277760	Well, good, because that would be outlandish and fantastic.
277760	280000	In order to better understand what the disorder is,
280000	282020	before we get into Loki,
282020	284360	let's walk through what might qualify someone
284360	287360	for having NPD using everyone's favorite
287360	290120	narcissistic mother, Lucille Bluth.
290120	293280	Everything I do is so dramatic and flamboyant.
293280	296680	It just makes me wanna set myself on fire.
296680	299540	Narcissistic personality disorder is defined
299540	301160	by the presence of at least five
301160	303200	of the following nine criteria,
303200	305360	a grandiose sense of self-importance.
305360	307200	What the hell was I supposed to do?
307200	309840	Michael Moore confronted me in front of the whole country.
309840	310680	First of all, it wasn't Michael Moore.
310680	312000	It was a Michael Moore lookalike,
312000	313720	and it wasn't in front of the whole country.
313720	315700	It was for a bit when Jimmy came alive.
316640	319120	I don't know who that is, and I don't care to find out.
319120	321520	A preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success,
321520	324080	power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love.
324080	325280	Tell me the truth, okay?
325280	327640	Because there's been a lot of lying in this family.
327640	329320	And a lot of love.
329320	331640	A belief that he or she is special and unique
331640	334000	and can only be understood by or should associate
334000	337520	with other special or high-status people or institutions.
337520	339480	Are you aware that we've been downgraded
339480	342120	to being just pool members at the club now?
342120	344000	Yeah, it's a real shame what's going on with this family.
344000	344920	You're stuck by the pool,
344920	346840	and Dad's getting picked last for softball.
346840	349280	A need for excessive admiration.
349280	350520	It's not just Mother Boy.
350520	352780	It's Mother Boy 30.
352780	355320	And I think with you, I've got a shot.
355320	357200	A sense of entitlement.
357200	358360	What's Spanish for?
358360	359680	I know you speak English.
359680	362840	Interpersonally exploitative behavior.
362840	365280	Did you and Dad adopt a child?
365280	367280	He must have forged my signature.
367280	368960	Well, then maybe I'll get a son
368960	371680	who will finish his cottage cheese.
371680	373520	A lack of empathy.
373520	375240	I want to cry so bad,
376480	378720	I don't think I can spare the moisture.
378720	380480	One lousy cigar rip.
380480	384360	Oh, honey, they're just heels.
384360	386920	They can only support so much weight.
386920	388440	Envy of others or a belief
388440	390960	that others are envious of him or her.
390960	392080	She's trying to prove
392080	394360	that she's closer to my children than I am,
394360	395200	but the joke's on her
395200	397960	because she doesn't know how little I care for Joe.
397960	399560	A demonstration of arrogant
399560	402000	and haughty behaviors or attitudes.
402000	403200	Take it back.
403200	405120	If I wanted something your thumb touched,
405120	406840	I'd eat the inside of your ear.
406840	409000	So these are just the DSM criteria,
409000	411520	but there are many more behaviors and symptoms
411520	413760	associated with the disorder.
413760	415840	I know when I'm not wanted.
415840	418600	Narcissists don't feel responsible for their own conduct,
418600	420360	but they will always hold others accountable
420360	422640	for any transgression, real or imagined.
422640	424920	Narcissists have an almost comically short memory
424920	426200	for their own behaviors
426200	427880	and will frequently rewrite history
427880	429240	to suit their own narrative.
429240	431400	I put the fires out.
431400	433480	You made them worse.
433480	436400	Worse or better?
437280	439520	Narcissists are also perpetual victims.
439520	441640	They often use the language of social justice
441640	444600	to reassure others that their victimhood is quite real.
444600	448280	That palace you live in, up there on that hill.
448280	452000	I gave my life to my children on a silver platter.
452000	454280	The admiration of others is a salve to shield them
454280	455880	from the perception of vulnerability.
455880	457640	It's important to remember that victimhood
457640	460480	and vulnerability are not the same thing.
460480	461760	I was the world's nicest guy
461760	463560	and they ruined my life for no reason.
463560	466000	See, just like I said, I'm the victim here.
466000	468720	But while narcissists frequently frame themselves
468720	470240	as the victims of injustice,
470240	473120	they tend to be outraged when other people claim victimhood,
473120	475520	especially when it counters their own narrative.
475520	476800	You are fake crying.
476800	478120	That is not real.
478120	480040	As a victim of abuse myself.
480040	481800	Oh my God.
481800	483640	You are so manipulative.
483640	485120	God, oh my God.
485120	486040	I was molested.
486040	487840	I have been, oh my gosh.
487840	489560	I've learned I am an empath, right?
489560	491560	Narcissists also aren't capable of love
491560	493720	in the way that neurotypical people are,
493720	496000	which is why it's so hard for the children of narcissists
496000	498520	to admit that their parents are in fact narcissists
498520	499800	because it's difficult to accept
499800	501360	that your parent doesn't really love you
501360	503000	in a way that a parent should
503000	505200	because narcissistic parents don't see their children
505240	508560	as autonomous people, but as extensions of themselves.
508560	512640	I see a strong, confident, beautiful young lady.
513760	515080	Oh look, you're here too.
515080	516880	I'm just teasing.
516880	519160	Stop taking everything so seriously.
519160	520960	Narcissists seek affection and approval,
520960	524040	but remain indifferent to any harm they themselves cause.
524040	526360	Interpersonal boundaries to a narcissist
526360	527920	are a form of abuse.
527920	530720	After everything I've done for you.
530720	533040	That I didn't ask for.
533040	537040	Do you have any idea of the work you're undoing?
537040	538880	Love to a narcissist isn't caring
538880	542480	for another person's emotional needs, but controlling them.
542480	545480	Suddenly he's too much of a big shot to brush mother's hair.
545480	546320	Well, I'm not.
549680	550600	Now with all that said,
550600	554240	there are a lot of common misconceptions of narcissism.
554240	555840	The first is that all narcissists
555840	557240	are extremely self-confident.
557240	559240	They're all so beautiful.
559240	561560	Why don't I have three heads?
562560	564360	Oh, this is funny.
565360	566200	This is not true.
566200	568800	What appears as confidence is often a thin veneer,
568800	571840	hiding feelings of shame, self-doubt and self-hatred.
571840	575320	Obsessive self-loathing is a form of narcissism.
575320	577880	Narcissists are usually oblivious to hurt they cause others.
577880	580120	Often hurtful behavior is just collateral damage
580120	581840	to having their emotional needs met.
581840	584240	I do everything I can to help you.
585560	588320	And all you can do is drink and talk nonsense
588320	590120	and frighten me.
590120	591920	Go back to bed.
591920	593560	Narcissists are evil.
593560	596800	I told Dwight that there is honor in losing,
596800	598960	which as we all know is completely ridiculous,
598960	603320	but there is however honor in making a loser feel better,
603320	605480	which is what I just did for Dwight.
605480	607240	The reality is that narcissists may behave
607240	609880	in hurtful ways, but they are not inherently evil.
609880	612520	Would I rather be feared or loved?
613680	614640	Easy, both.
615480	618400	I want people to be afraid of how much they love me.
618400	620760	Narcissistic personality disorder does not implicate
620760	623040	any kind of off-kilter moral barometer.
623040	625480	There's nothing wrong with a narcissist's impulse control
625480	627480	or their ability to tell right from wrong.
627480	628840	Quite the opposite in some ways.
628840	631800	Narcissists are not only able to discern right from wrong,
631800	633800	they for the most part want to do right,
633800	636040	again, because they want to be liked.
636040	638680	For me to be attracted to a woman,
638680	641280	she has to be as intelligent or slightly less intelligent
641280	643560	than me, and she is, you know.
643560	646200	Narcissists all come from a background of privilege.
646200	647840	People have a very specific idea
647840	650000	that narcissists come from a certain background.
650000	652520	They are privileged, they come from wealth and power,
652520	654440	and that is sometimes true,
654440	657240	but anyone from any background can develop the disorder.
657240	659320	Although there is no one cause for narcissism,
659320	660640	it rarely emerges in people
660640	662720	who come from stable, loving families.
662720	665200	I'd rather smother them with a pillow
665200	666800	than take them to Nevada!
666800	668560	Always with the drama!
668560	671000	It is often the result of trauma or emotional neglect,
671000	672800	and for those who perceive wealth and power,
672800	673920	the wealth and power is used
673920	676160	to shield an incredibly fragile ego.
676160	678880	You clearly don't know who you're talking to,
678880	680520	so let me clue you in.
680520	682760	I am not in danger, Skyler.
682760	684600	I am the danger.
684600	686240	A guy opens his door and gets shot,
686240	687720	and you think that of me?
687720	688880	No.
688880	690680	I am the one who knocks!
690680	692360	But one of the more common misconceptions
692360	695000	is the conflation of narcissism with psychopathy,
695000	698000	this idea that narcissists don't experience hurt or pain
698000	700480	or even their own, you know, version of love.
700480	704920	When you leave my heart
704920	707320	narcissists, especially female narcissists,
707320	709760	actually live in a constant state of anxiety,
709760	711520	and boy, do they want you to know that.
711520	714280	Hope you have children of your own
714280	716560	and they treat you like this.
716560	719960	They gave my life to my children on a silver platter.
719960	720920	This is bullshit.
720920	723160	So here's why narcissists aren't just psychopaths
723160	724280	with high self-esteem.
724280	725360	Psychopaths don't really care
725360	726440	what other people think of them.
726440	728040	They don't care about their lives
728040	729560	and they don't experience empathy,
729560	732120	where a narcissist is defined by a preoccupation
732120	733760	with what other people think of them.
733760	735440	They are constantly reshaping themselves
735440	738280	to fit whatever mold they think will serve them best.
738280	739440	I'm Prison Mike.
740960	743120	You know why they call me Prison Mike?
743120	745520	Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else?
745520	747920	Do you really expect me to not push you up
747920	749400	against the wall, beotch?
749400	751560	Some narcissists do this by being charming.
751560	754840	I am a writer, a doctor, a nuclear physicist,
754840	756440	a theoretical philosopher.
758480	760240	But above all, I am a man.
760240	764960	You're a hopelessly inquisitive man, just like you.
764960	766680	Some by being manipulative.
766680	769120	Tears aren't a woman's only weapon.
770800	774480	Some by being controlling and some downright authoritarian.
774480	776840	It's the unspoken truth of humanity
777840	780600	that you crave subjugation.
780600	782440	But a true narcissist doesn't live
782440	784520	in a state of cold self-assuredness.
784520	786560	Rather, they live in a constant state of anxiety
786560	787680	and hypervigilance.
787680	790120	You don't know what goes through this mind of mine.
790120	791640	Well, that's for fucking sure.
791640	794320	But narcissism in itself is not unhealthy.
794320	796200	There is what is called healthy narcissism
796200	799320	and it is healthy to exhibit some narcissistic traits.
799320	801360	You do actually need some narcissism
801360	803040	for a healthy functioning psyche.
803040	804840	And that is the sort of thing that lets you stand up
804840	807320	for yourself when you're being treated unfairly.
807320	810840	I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki.
810840	814840	The next time you raise a hand to me
814840	817440	will be the last time you have hands.
817440	819960	So with all that groundwork out of the way,
820800	824160	the big question, is Loki a narcissist?
824160	827160	Sorry about that time I turned you into a frog.
827160	828760	It was a wonderful joke.
828760	831240	Was indeed hilarious.
831240	833160	Well, depends on which Loki.
833160	835080	The most lovable version of Loki,
835080	836800	the Loki from Thor Ragnarok.
836800	839960	I have been falling for 30 minutes.
839960	842040	Is probably the most narcissistic.
842040	844400	The movie begins with him watching a plague
844400	847120	glorifying his part in the previous film.
847160	850040	I'm sorry about that thing with the Tesseract.
850040	851920	I just couldn't help myself.
851920	852760	I'm a trickster.
852760	854600	This is so mischievous.
854600	856200	He spends the entire movie
856200	858480	caring not at all about Thor
858480	861520	or whatever is going on in Sakaar.
861520	863080	Feels no empathy for Thor
863080	864680	when he's getting the shit kicked out of him.
864680	867680	In fact, enjoys it as a form of retribution.
868920	871280	That's how it feels.
871280	872920	I'm just a huge fan of the sport.
872920	876040	And in the end, any altruistic action he takes
876040	879960	is ultimately because it's the best action for him.
879960	882280	Suddenly you're overcome with an urge to do the right thing.
882280	883480	Heavens no.
883480	885120	I ran out of faith with the Grandmaster
885120	887160	and in exchange for codes and access to a ship,
887160	890320	I'm asking for safe passage through the anus.
890320	891840	And sure, he saves the day at the end,
891840	893800	but not out of a sense of empathy,
893800	896880	but out of the correct sense that this path
896880	899280	is the one that will get him the most adulation.
899280	903560	Your savior is here!
903560	906760	Contrast this with the Loki in Loki.
906760	908640	He displays narcissistic traits,
908640	911120	but basically completely falls short
911120	914280	of having the disorder in the very first episode.
914280	917280	I don't enjoy hurting people.
918280	922120	I do it because I have to,
922120	923520	because I've had to.
923520	926240	It's the cruel, elaborate trick
926240	929320	counted by the weak to inspire fear.
929320	931560	A desperate play for control.
931600	934440	He loves his mother, not as an extension of himself,
934440	937960	but for her own sake and is protective of her safety.
937960	938800	Where is he?
938800	939880	Now why don't you tell me,
939880	942120	do you enjoy hurting people?
942120	942960	I don't believe you.
942960	943800	Do you enjoy killing?
943800	944640	I'll kill you.
944640	946240	What, like you did your mother?
948240	950440	Sylvie is self-taught, but Loki.
950440	953080	Someone taught you fairly decent magic.
953080	954080	My mother.
954080	955560	Then there's the interaction with Sif
955560	956960	where he comes to a conclusion
956960	959200	about his personal failings on his own.
960200	962560	I crave attention because I'm,
964840	966920	I'm a narcissist.
966920	969040	It's because I'm scared of being alone.
969040	971320	A true narcissist would continue to deflect blame
971320	973120	when confronted with all of the timeline stuff
973120	974400	he had in store for him.
974400	975960	He wouldn't accept responsibility,
975960	978400	and he certainly wouldn't have an honest come to Jesus moment
978400	980360	after being punched in the head 400 times
980360	981680	by the same person.
981680	983320	I'm a narcissist.
983320	984800	He might say something manipulative
984800	986480	to get her to stop hitting,
986480	988280	but the Sif time loop would not bring about
988320	991240	an honest moment of self-reflection in a true narcissist.
991240	993840	Again, narcissists are eternal victims.
993840	996320	They are pathologically incapable of self-reflection
996320	998040	if it doesn't come from an outside source
998040	999240	that they care about.
999240	1001840	Also, vulnerability is anathema to a narcissist,
1001840	1005160	but Loki allows himself to be vulnerable several times.
1005160	1007640	Most relevant to the discussion in The Discourse,
1007640	1009320	and indeed in the show itself,
1009320	1013520	is what he sees in Sylvie, his alternate universe self,
1013520	1015480	specifically in the moments before he thinks
1015480	1016840	they're both about to die.
1017040	1019000	You were just a child when the TVA took you,
1019000	1020760	but you nearly took down the organization
1020760	1023040	that claims to govern the order of time.
1023040	1024120	You did it on your own.
1024120	1025480	You had rings around them.
1025480	1026400	You're amazing.
1027760	1029880	Clearly there are elements of him looking at her
1029880	1032520	and seeing aspects of what he could have been,
1032520	1035360	but ultimately the virtues that he appreciates in Sylvie
1035360	1037960	aren't really virtues that he shares.
1037960	1040640	A common tactic when narcissists compliment other people
1040640	1043360	is that they are really complimenting themselves,
1043360	1045200	but Loki isn't doing that here.
1045200	1048480	Like, they're variations on the same person,
1048480	1051480	but they are still two completely different people.
1051480	1053680	The contradiction of Loki as a show
1053680	1055360	is that much of the tension
1055360	1058000	comes from Loki's history of narcissism.
1058000	1059640	His history of narcissism
1059640	1061600	is what makes him the most likely in the room
1061600	1063840	to betray anyone at any given point.
1063840	1066160	You're really good at doing awful things
1066160	1068360	and then just getting away.
1068360	1069200	What can I say?
1069200	1071080	I'm a mischievous scamp.
1071080	1071920	While at the same time,
1071960	1074080	Loki is most likely to do whatever it takes
1074080	1075960	to be liked or gain power.
1075960	1078640	There's this constant tension of will he betray Mobius?
1078640	1080320	Will he betray Sylvie?
1080320	1081480	Mobius, come on.
1081480	1082880	What could possibly go wrong?
1082880	1084600	We gotta properly test this theory.
1084600	1086080	Well, here's a fun theory.
1086080	1087400	You lure me out into the field
1087400	1088840	and then you stab me in the back,
1088840	1090720	and that's a theory I don't wanna test.
1090720	1092560	I can't sleep in a place like this.
1093440	1094840	You can't sleep on a train?
1094840	1097680	No, I can't sleep around untrustworthy people.
1097680	1098520	But in the end,
1098520	1100160	aside from a couple of very justified moments
1100160	1101400	of self-preservation,
1101400	1104280	the Loki in the TV show betrays nobody.
1104280	1108520	Six episodes, nary a betrayal that wasn't earned.
1108520	1109360	I'm staying.
1112560	1113760	Which is why the ending,
1113760	1116320	Sylvie's assumption that he intends to betray her
1116320	1119400	while the rando at the end of time chews the scenery,
1119400	1122440	makes the conclusion of the show ring kind of hollow.
1125600	1126760	You want the throne.
1127760	1128680	No.
1128680	1130400	No, Sylvie, this does not comport
1130440	1132320	with the person that you have been interacting with
1132320	1133520	during this series.
1133520	1134960	That's what you think of me.
1136520	1138240	After all this time.
1138240	1139360	Sure, why not?
1140960	1143040	Evil Loki's master plan comes together.
1143040	1145320	Because the Loki you have been interacting with
1145320	1147440	never acted like a self-serving narcissist.
1147440	1149440	He's actually pretty self-sacrificial.
1149440	1151200	You've both risked your life for each other
1151200	1153240	several times by now.
1153240	1155040	Loki, I don't even know if this is gonna work.
1155040	1157680	You go, I go.
1157680	1159680	It's almost like you've been watching all the movies
1159680	1161400	we saw before this.
1161400	1162880	So from movie to movie to TV show,
1162880	1163720	I think it's fair to say
1163720	1165920	that Loki's writing is inconsistent.
1165920	1167440	NPD is not a disorder
1167440	1169600	that you can character arc your way out of.
1169600	1171440	By definition, it is incurable.
1171440	1174240	So if you want to incorporate the Loki of Disney plus Loki
1174240	1175920	into Loki's greater journey,
1175920	1177880	but I don't think he's badly written,
1177880	1180640	but he's not an honest portrayal of a narcissist.
1180640	1182160	Ten is a true narcissist.
1182160	1184320	I give him a seven, maybe an eight.
1184320	1186040	Absolutely not.
1186040	1188120	This is fine and guardian leather.
1188120	1190000	But this is not to say that the MCU
1190000	1192680	doesn't have anything meaningful to say about narcissism.
1192680	1195400	The best, most honest portrayal in the MCU of a narcissist
1195400	1199320	is not Loki, nor is it Thanos, but...
1199320	1200720	My name is Ego,
1202720	1204280	and I'm your dad, Peter.
1206280	1207840	Uh-oh, have we found an excuse
1207840	1210800	to fawn over Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 again?
1210800	1212920	Yes, yes, yes, yes, we have.
1212920	1215160	I thought Yondu was your father.
1215160	1216560	You look exactly alike.
1216560	1217920	One's blue.
1220240	1221480	So in a lot of ways,
1221480	1224040	Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the rare movie
1224040	1226680	that makes the first one better in retrospect.
1226680	1229040	A lot of the boomer nostalgia from the first movie
1229040	1231760	that just felt kind of random and atmospheric
1231760	1234120	and maybe a little pandery.
1234120	1237320	Ooh, child, things will get brighter.
1237320	1238760	Then bring it down hard.
1238760	1240680	Now, with the context of the second movie,
1240680	1242120	feels a lot more thoughtful.
1242120	1243880	Take, for instance, the soundtracks
1243880	1245640	and the song in Guardians 2
1245640	1247400	that serves as a through line.
1251240	1254160	You know Brandy by Looking Glass?
1254160	1255920	On first blush when we first meet
1255920	1258520	CGIDH Kurt Russell in Peter's Mom,
1258520	1261120	you're like, yeah, that's a fun 70s love song.
1261120	1262040	How quaint.
1262040	1263920	I will take one nostalgia, please.
1263920	1268120	This is brandy, such a motherland.
1268120	1269360	But as the movie unfolds,
1269360	1271960	the ugly undertones become more and more apparent.
1276640	1280520	You know, Peter, you and I, we're the sailor in that song.
1280520	1283440	The sailor in the song doesn't care about Brandy at all.
1283440	1285880	He's all about his own pleasure, his own goals,
1285880	1288880	and he frames it like it's a good, fun thing.
1288880	1293440	See calls upon him as history calls upon great men.
1293440	1295360	There is zero remorse in the song,
1295360	1296960	which is why we're here today.
1296960	1299040	We're going to be together for a long time.
1299040	1300960	We're going to be together for a long time.
1300960	1303200	We're going to be together for a long time.
1303600	1305560	There is zero remorse in the song,
1305560	1307560	which is why Ego is drawn to it,
1307560	1309080	and to a certain extent, Peter.
1309080	1312120	It was one of Earth's greatest musical compositions.
1312120	1314120	Perhaps it's very greatest.
1314120	1315280	Yeah, yes.
1315280	1318040	Guardians 2 is about family, what makes one,
1318040	1320040	but largely it's also about how Ego
1320040	1321920	negatively affects relationships,
1321920	1323760	both the literal character ego
1323760	1325920	and the concept of narcissism itself.
1325920	1329000	They told me you people were conceited douchebags,
1329000	1331040	but that isn't true at all.
1331040	1332480	Rocket steals batteries
1332480	1334640	because the Sovereign offended his ego.
1334640	1336880	The Sovereign's motivation for revenge
1336880	1339240	throughout the entire movie is ego.
1339240	1341840	Our concern is they're slight against our people.
1341840	1343920	Peter and Rocket nearly kill everybody
1343920	1347600	trying to prove that they are the superior pilot, Ego.
1347600	1350680	Gator, we almost died because of your arrogance.
1350680	1353800	So Ego operates as the perfect portrait of a narcissist.
1353800	1355840	He can't understand other people's motivations
1355840	1357360	that don't directly serve him.
1357360	1359480	But instead of returning you,
1359520	1361320	Yondu kept you.
1361320	1363600	I have no clue as to why.
1363600	1366400	And challenging questions that center other people's needs.
1366400	1367360	Why didn't you come back?
1367360	1370360	Why did you send Yondu, a criminal of all people, to come?
1370360	1371920	Well, we're just gonna change the subject.
1371920	1373880	I've made many mistakes, Peter,
1375120	1376880	but you're not one of them.
1376880	1381880	There's so much that I need to teach you about this planet.
1381880	1384480	But at the same time, Ego is also good at charming people.
1384480	1387000	And with Peter, he's good at giving Peter validation
1387000	1388560	that feels like validation,
1388560	1391360	but really it's just Ego complimenting himself.
1391360	1392440	Who the hell are you?
1393760	1396480	Figured my rugged good looks would make that obvious.
1396480	1400920	I can explain your very special heritage.
1400920	1402680	Out of all my spawn,
1403640	1407680	only you carry the connection to the light.
1407680	1408520	But most of all,
1408520	1411440	he sees everyone as either an extension of himself
1411440	1413400	or a potential extension of himself.
1413400	1414800	Peter is valuable to him
1414800	1417080	when Peter is willing to perform that role,
1417080	1419240	but the second he behaves autonomously.
1419240	1422080	You really need to grow up.
1426400	1429200	But like Ego, Peter is also extremely narcissistic.
1429200	1431800	That's why he nearly falls for Ego's plan.
1431800	1433680	Well, it's because that place was real
1433680	1434840	and this is a fantasy.
1434840	1435680	I get it.
1435680	1437960	You're jealous because I'm part God
1437960	1439280	and you like when I'm the weak one.
1439280	1442160	Ego tells him he is special, he's powerful.
1442160	1444320	And without the planet that is Ego,
1444320	1446160	he's not special anymore.
1446160	1447360	You are a God.
1448760	1452920	If you kill me, you'll be just like everybody else.
1452920	1454400	Peter's narcissism is the main thing
1454400	1456320	getting in the way with his relationship with Gamora
1456320	1457720	because, well,
1461040	1463560	she's already lived through escaping one narcissist
1463560	1464400	in her life.
1464400	1466920	So her hesitation is very understandable.
1466920	1469080	This is why I hate Infinity War.
1469080	1470760	Anyway, this line, for instance.
1470760	1471600	You know what?
1471600	1473240	This is not Cheers after all.
1473240	1475400	I don't know what Cheers is!
1475400	1478000	It's played for laughs, but it's very revealing.
1478000	1480840	He's whining about his needs and he doesn't even care
1480840	1482800	that she doesn't know what he's talking about.
1482800	1487800	My life, my love, my lady is the sea.
1488760	1490240	There's a lot of heavy stuff in this movie
1490240	1491920	that is couched in comedy.
1491920	1494800	Arguably by necessity, because if you seriously mull
1494800	1496760	on what's happening in certain scenes.
1496760	1499880	Yondu is the guy who abducted me, kicked the crap out of me
1499880	1502160	so I could learn to fight and kept me in terror
1502160	1503560	by threatening to eat me.
1503560	1505400	It's actually pretty disturbing.
1505400	1507120	You said you were gonna eat me.
1507120	1510440	That was being funny, not to me!
1510440	1512200	But the other side of the coin to the effects
1512200	1514360	of the narcissistic parent is Mantis,
1514360	1516640	who is functionally also Ego's child.
1516640	1519600	He raised me by hand and kept me as his own.
1520720	1521760	So you're a pet.
1523240	1524200	I suppose.
1524200	1525560	Mantis is an empath.
1525560	1527760	You're empathic, so an empath.
1527760	1528600	I've heard that before.
1528600	1530200	I've learned I am an empath, right?
1530200	1531960	No, Shane, like a real one.
1531960	1533800	Empaths feel feelings.
1533800	1535800	Particularly relevant because narcissists
1535800	1537560	prey on other people's empathy.
1537560	1539640	Children of narcissistic parents frequently learn
1539640	1541640	to shape-shift as a survival mechanism.
1541640	1543400	The first thing Mantis does in the film
1543400	1545560	is laugh at Drax's practical joke,
1545560	1547440	even though she clearly hates it.
1551440	1554320	That is called a practical joke.
1557320	1558880	He likes it very much.
1558880	1561520	It's not too boring to say that you're fine
1561520	1562560	and you're not really fine,
1562560	1564320	but you just can't get into it because they would-
1564320	1566160	Children of narcissists tend to either be
1566160	1569040	pathological pleasers or very cold.
1569040	1571080	They either exhaust themselves in a lifetime
1571080	1572760	of trying to please the unpleasable.
1572760	1574640	A child my father would have Gamora in me
1574640	1576160	bow to one another in training.
1577560	1580040	Every time my sister prevailed,
1580040	1582520	my father would replace a piece of me with machinery.
1582520	1584240	Or they stonewall everyone they enter
1584240	1585600	an intimate relationship with
1585600	1586760	every time there's conflict.
1586760	1589600	So a lot of Mantis' scenes are couched in comedy
1589640	1591640	because she is deeply traumatized.
1591640	1593160	So a lot of the expression of her trauma
1593160	1595360	is framed for laughs because-
1595360	1597720	This gross bug lady is my new friend.
1597720	1601000	I'm learning many things like I'm a pet and ugly.
1601000	1603880	Otherwise it would be a bit too heavy in a movie like this.
1603880	1605720	I'm very popular, y'all!
1605720	1609400	So given the way the MCU utilizes narcissists
1609400	1612840	slash protagonists who, while not being narcissistic
1612840	1615520	to the point of disorder, are extremely narcissistic,
1615520	1616880	there is a success here.
1616880	1619080	We love narcissistic characters.
1619080	1622040	We see the narcissism of the protagonist in ourselves
1622040	1625000	and the narcissism of the villains is just fun to watch.
1625000	1626040	They are memorable.
1626040	1628800	I am a god, you dull creature!
1628800	1630360	And I will not be bullied by-
1632760	1633880	So it's interesting to me
1633880	1636880	that we hate IRL narcissists so much.
1636880	1638000	Why is that?
1638000	1639480	In some ways, it's the same reason
1639480	1641600	why addicts loathe alcoholics
1641600	1645240	or why people with anger issues loathe domestic abusers.
1645240	1646600	We hate the most in others
1646600	1649320	the thing we fear the most in ourselves.
1649320	1651440	So the funny thing about Loki is
1651440	1653560	we loved Loki, the narcissist,
1653560	1656920	as long as the word narcissist wasn't trotted out,
1656920	1658680	because the moment it is trotted out-
1658680	1662600	What a incredible seismic narcissist!
1662600	1664760	He has to stop being a narcissist
1664760	1666320	in order to remain likable.
1666320	1668320	And then suddenly he's Mr. Empathy.
1668320	1671240	His behavior is no longer disordered but relatable.
1671240	1672960	He's no longer a narcissist,
1672960	1675040	but wrestling with his own narcissism.
1677600	1679440	This isn't about you.
1679440	1681160	That said, it's really common for people
1681160	1683240	to talk about having been in relationships
1683240	1685480	with people with other personality disorders
1685480	1687360	and maybe it was extremely difficult,
1687360	1688800	but they don't talk about those people
1688800	1692160	in terms of a condition that must be fundamentally avoided.
1692160	1694280	It's framed as a mental illness.
1694280	1697280	So why don't we talk about narcissists in the same way?
1697280	1699360	Why are narcissists always spiders
1699360	1701040	who capture people in their web
1701040	1703160	rather than people with behavioral disorders
1703160	1705800	that don't have the tools to manage their disorder?
1705840	1707320	The worst thing about narcissists
1707320	1708840	isn't that they're narcissists.
1708840	1710680	Most of them want to be good people.
1710680	1712000	They thrive off validation.
1712000	1713240	The worst thing about narcissists
1713240	1715400	is they never seek treatment for their condition,
1715400	1718720	because they don't want the stigma of being a narcissist.
1718720	1720560	So therefore, they never admit that they are
1720560	1722160	and they never stop hurting the people
1722160	1725560	that they care about, you know, in their way.
1727640	1728640	This is especially true
1728640	1731080	for narcissistic parents of adult children.
1731080	1733560	Why did you adopt me?
1733600	1735560	Because I wanted someone to love.
1736400	1739920	Don't you act for me.
1739920	1741400	Again, this is a really common thing
1741400	1743760	children of narcissists will notice about their parents.
1743760	1746040	They believe they're good people doing the right thing
1746040	1747680	and they just don't understand
1747680	1750200	why their children don't want to talk to them,
1750200	1753200	no matter how many times their children have explained it.
1758960	1761760	Both Yondu and Ego were shit parents.
1761800	1762960	Ego, the narcissist,
1762960	1766080	and Yondu, the abusive and neglectful adoptive father.
1766080	1768840	But in the end, one of them was able to see their child
1768840	1772320	as more than just an extension of themselves.
1772320	1774840	And that is what sets him apart as a parent.
1775840	1777840	I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.
1779160	1781040	I'm damn lucky you're my boy.
1781040	1784440	So fictional narcissists occupy an interesting space
1784440	1789120	with regard to the way we engage with real life narcissists.
1789120	1794120	Frost giants and mad titans and living planets aren't real.
1794480	1797480	But people with narcissistic personality disorder are.
1797480	1799240	And according to some studies,
1799240	1804240	up to 5% of all humans have narcissistic personality disorder.
1804320	1806960	A lot of people claim to have narcissistic parents,
1806960	1808520	not because it's trendy,
1808520	1810600	well, not just because it's trendy,
1810600	1813360	but also just because it's a really common disorder.
1813360	1815680	So what have we learned from these fictional examples
1815680	1818040	of how to deal with narcissists?
1818040	1822480	Well, either they character arc their way into a cure
1822480	1824400	or we kill them.
1824400	1826800	A narcissist can't cure their condition
1826800	1828440	in the same way that someone
1828440	1832200	with less stigmatized disorders like major depression
1832200	1834120	or borderline personality disorder
1834120	1837200	or bipolar disorder can't cure theirs.
1837200	1840080	But that doesn't mean they can't evolve
1840080	1841840	or improve as people.
1841840	1844440	It's not curable, but it is treatable.
1844440	1847200	And the hardest hurdle here is usually
1847240	1851480	to get the narcissist to want treatment in the first place.
1851480	1854640	So aside from a pretty disappointing last episode,
1854640	1856480	I really did enjoy Loki
1856480	1860280	and I don't want to imply that the show is a failure
1860280	1863040	because it made him less narcissistic
1863040	1866240	in the service of making him more likable.
1866240	1868560	I just think that the result is a show
1868560	1871840	that doesn't have a lot to say about narcissism
1871840	1873520	despite trying to.
1873520	1875440	And it leaves me wondering,
1875440	1876560	is it even possible
1876560	1879640	to destigmatize narcissistic personality disorder
1879640	1882680	in the way that things like bipolar disorder
1882680	1885280	or major depression have lost their stigma
1885280	1886760	in the last few decades?
1886760	1890160	And if so, what would that look like?
1890160	1891960	Disney is an evil mega hydra
1891960	1894480	that is rapidly covering the land in darkness.
1894480	1896400	But there is something to be said for the fact
1896400	1899480	that not only do they feel safe making these narratives,
1899480	1900480	but that they've turned them
1900480	1902440	into some of the most popular television
1902440	1904440	of the streaming era so far.
1904440	1906520	I didn't really touch on the Falcon and the Winter Soldier
1906520	1909560	because, honestly, I thought it was pretty boring.
1909560	1910840	But I do think it's worth mentioning
1910840	1912360	that this is the only one of these series
1912360	1914480	that integrates any discussion on therapy
1914480	1916720	or how to live with mental illness,
1916720	1918320	which Loki doesn't because, you know,
1918320	1919640	it's not that kind of show.
1919640	1921360	Aah!
1921360	1922600	Aah!
1922600	1925440	Not every piece of media that deals with mental illness
1925440	1927160	needs to integrate some portion
1927160	1929640	about like medication or therapy or whatever.
1929640	1931240	Are you still having nightmares?
1935120	1936120	But if you look at these three
1936120	1937960	and how they all take such different approaches
1937960	1940160	to exploring mental illness through fiction,
1940160	1942720	it's interesting that this is such a through line
1942720	1945120	with the new direction Marvel is going.
1945120	1948280	Ask your doctor about Nexus,
1948280	1950960	a unique antidepressant that works to anchor you
1950960	1955040	back to your reality or the reality of your choice.
1956160	1958440	Side effects include feeling your feelings,
1958440	1960640	confronting your truth, seizing your destiny,
1960640	1962600	and possibly more depression.
1962600	1965000	Right now, it's less here is the conflict
1965000	1968280	and more how did the conflict shape these characters?
1968280	1970120	Which does kind of become a problem
1970120	1972800	with shows like WandaVision where in the end,
1972800	1975400	we still kind of have to punch our way out of the conflict.
1975400	1977920	But whatever, it's been nominated for like 80 Emmys.
1977920	1979680	Clearly they're doing something right.
1979680	1981680	And I killed Sparky too.
1984320	1986160	So I don't want to give Disney too much credit here,
1986160	1988160	but I think there is some value
1988160	1990360	to these pop culture artifacts
1990360	1992160	designed for mass consumption
1992160	1994160	normalizing these discussions,
1994160	1996720	because I've seen it help a lot of people
1996720	1999240	find the language for their own traumas
1999240	2001560	or even in the case of Loki,
2001560	2004000	their own relationship to their own narcissism
2004000	2006920	that maybe they haven't really processed yet.
2006920	2009160	And I can only surmise that you guys are hungry
2009160	2014160	for more content about toxic narcissistic parents.
2014160	2016440	So smooth.
2016440	2017280	My bad.
2017280	2018640	So my first book, Axiom's End,
2018640	2020880	is a Kindle deal of the month.
2020880	2022920	It's only $2.99 on Amazon
2022920	2024800	for the entire months of September.
2024800	2026600	It also just came out in paperback.
2026600	2027600	There's paperback.
2028800	2029960	Treat my books very well.
2029960	2031840	And if you want to know how this ties in
2031840	2033320	with the theme of narcissistic parents,
2033320	2035960	well, I guess you'll just have to read it to find out.
2035960	2037840	And if you're into exploring trauma
2037840	2040880	using science fiction and aliens and stuff,
2040880	2043480	my second book comes out on October 12th.
2043480	2045640	This is not the final version,
2045640	2047200	so I'm allowed to have used this one.
2047200	2048440	This is an advanced reader copy.
2048440	2049800	They throw these in their cycling
2049800	2051200	once the real book comes out.
2051200	2053400	Anyway, you can pre-order signed copies of that
2053400	2056320	in the link below, but maybe you're just not satisfied.
2056320	2058360	You need more content.
2058360	2060120	You're insatiable.
2060120	2061640	And maybe you're wondering,
2061640	2064120	where do I keep all my videos
2064120	2066480	that are too spicy for YouTube?
2066480	2068880	Well, that's where Nebula comes in.
2068880	2070160	I have several video essays
2070160	2071840	that you can only watch on Nebula.
2071840	2074440	The Streamy Award-nominated Nebula,
2074440	2076440	try saying that five times fast,
2076440	2079000	is a video streaming platform built for
2079040	2082840	and by creators like Sarah Z, Maggie Mae Fish,
2082840	2086280	Big Joel, myself, but not ContraPoints.
2086280	2088320	And if you want access to my hot takes
2088320	2090320	that are too spicy for YouTube,
2090320	2093160	you get access to our streaming service, Nebula,
2093160	2096560	when you go to curiositystream.com slash Lindsay
2096560	2098920	and use the code, which is also my name,
2098920	2101440	and you get access to several Nebula original videos
2101440	2102760	that I've already made,
2102760	2105960	exploring topics like Tropic Thunder, comma,
2105960	2108240	all the trends it destroyed through parody
2108240	2109360	that were tried too.
2109360	2112640	And could Blazing Saddles be made today?
2112640	2115360	God damn it, why are people still asking this?
2115360	2117680	Excuse me while I whip this out.
2117680	2118520	Aah!
2120240	2121280	So thank you for watching.
2121280	2122440	Thank you for support.
2122440	2124400	And I'll see you next time.
2126080	2127680	And suddenly you're overcome with an urge
2127680	2128520	to do the right thing.
2128520	2129720	Heavens no.
2129720	2131360	I ran out of faith with the Grandmaster
2131360	2133440	and in exchange for codes and access to a ship,
2133440	2136920	I'm asking for safe passage through the anus.
2136920	2137760	Through the anus.
2139560	2140520	Through the anus.
2142400	2143400	Through the anus.
2145160	2146960	Why the hell is there an alligator in here?
2146960	2148760	Through the anus.
2148760	2149800	Through the anus.
2150920	2151760	Anus.
2151760	2152720	I was a king.
2153760	2154600	The rightful king of-
2154600	2155440	Anus.
2158120	2159160	Through the anus.
2160680	2162840	I still need that anus.
2162840	2164760	I've come too far for anything else.
2165760	2166760	Anus.
2166760	2168760	I am Loki,
2168760	2169760	the V Asgard.
2171240	2174160	And I am burdened with glorious anus.
