1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Whew. I don't know about you, but to me, Tom Green is pretty nostalgic.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Like, how did this happen, America?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tom Green was very flash in the pan, and for those of you who don't remember,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tom Green came to international fame through his MTV talk show.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Here's a guy who was funny only to 13-year-old idiots.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Unfortunately, there are a lot of 13-year-old idiots.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And the Tom Green show's popularity skyrocketed,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
featuring such cutting-edge documentary-style stories as breaking shit in stores,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
painting graphic porn on your parents' car,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
torturing your friends,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and shoving shit in people's faces.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Basically, Tom Green's brand of comedy was to annoy the hell out of all unfortunates in his path.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And what else could bring a man that degree of popularity that quickly?

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But in order to do an episode on Tom Green, I'd have to look at the entire Tom Green catalog,

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and I don't think I have enough brain juice for that.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Hey, didn't Tom Green make a movie?

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You're right. He did.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Given the obvious trajectory, for anyone who gets even the smallest modicum of fame ever,

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
as Kevin Smith once put it, failing upward,

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Tom Green made the leap from MTV's sensation of annoying to silver screen phenomenon

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
that he might annoy even more people,

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
to the point that in a mere two years since his debut on MTV,

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Green's star had risen so high that Regency and 20th Century Fox said,

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
here, have 15 million dollars.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Write and direct a movie.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Freddy Got Fingered is a surprisingly traditional story,

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
the tale of an aspiring animator who can't catch a break.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It deals mainly with Gord, played by Green, and his daddy issues.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Widely considered to be one of the very worst films ever made,

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
it was panned at the time of its release, winning five Razzies in the process.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Even Roger Ebert, who likes everything, wrote in his review,

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This movie isn't the bottom of the barrel.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This movie isn't below the bottom of the barrel.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This movie doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Ebert went on to say that while the day would never, ever, ever come

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
that the film could be considered funny,

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
the day might come where it might be considered a masterpiece of neo-surrealist dadaist cinema.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
In fact, the film has gained something of a cult following

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and has a little bit of a renaissance based on the

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I-can't-tell-if-they're-being-hipster-ironic belief

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
that this film is a countercultural art piece.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Not so bad it's good, so bad it's art.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So, one little ol' 90 minute movie instead of an entire television series.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That will keep it short.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah, this'll be much easier.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
How bad could it be?

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
AHHHHH

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
AHHHH

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's mostly worn off for me.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
AHHHH

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I think I've reached words again.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I can't finish this, but I'm contractually obligated to finish it.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Damn Channel Awesome and its contractual obligations.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I mean, I could push it on someone else.

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What about those people who think it's an art film?

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Hello, Kyle, the new art film critic guy.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah, you want to review Freddy Got Fingered With Me, the neo-surrealist art film?

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
No, no, no, you don't need to come here. We'll meet you halfway.

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Bye.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This is it.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay, well.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Kyle, did you watch the movie yet?

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Kyle?

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
My God.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Ew.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Is that what I think it...

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Oh my God!

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Kyle!

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Oh Kyle!

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh my God!

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Oh God!

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh God, wake up, wake up!

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Oh God.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh, oh God.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Quick, sing something from Les Mis.

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
There's a grief that can't be spoken.

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Oh God.

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
He's there.

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
There's a pain goes on and on.

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's enough.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Empty chairs and empty...

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Kyle!

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh God.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Alright.

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Alright.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Wow, you're taller than I remember.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Next musical review for realsies, I promise.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So anyway, tell us how this is a Dadaist master...

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This cannot be Dada!

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's too normal to be Dada!

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's too shit to be anything else!

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Use your smart mouth words.

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay.

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let me go towel off.

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Have at it.

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Have at it.

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Dada.

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
A movement begun in Zurich by the likes of Hugo Ball, Tristan Tzara, and Hans Richter

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
that flourished in the decade immediately after the end of World War I.

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It was started out of cynicism.

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
They believed that any culture that could have produced such a horrible and human bloodbath

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
like the First World War had no intrinsic value.

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So, Dada was set up as anti-art.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Art that aims to destroy all other art.

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
In order to be called a Dadaist piece, there would have to be no plot at all.

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Not even the sad facsimile of plot, which resembles more that of early Adam Sandler comedies.

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But honestly, the things Green does in this film don't stray far from the usual things one would have seen

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
in the most highly regarded performance art of the last 20 years.

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I would like to remind people that the most highly regarded performance art of the last 20 years

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
included a theatrical piece where a woman stripped naked and bathed herself in honey

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
while reciting a monologue about Winnie the Pooh doing BDSM.

112
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And before you ask, I'm not making a word of that up.

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Talk about the whole Tom Green oeuvre.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I can't talk about the Tom Green oeuvre.

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Well, why not?

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I don't know anything about the Tom Green oeuvre.

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Well, I do.

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I gotta get the pooh off my bum! Pooh, pooh!

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The original Canadian rapper-slash-actor, the Orson Welles of our time, Tom Green.

120
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
As someone who may or may not have been addicted to MTV at the height of the whole Tom Green thing,

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and may or may not have voted for the Bum Bum song on TRO and watched all of his first series, I get it.

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This film was, however, realistically the only film the studio could have expected to get for their money.

123
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Tom Green is scared and confused in a directionless sort of way.

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I can't think of anything to draw because I'm so stupid!

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He hates society. He hates Adam Sandler movies, apparently.

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But his hate is aimless. His goals are unclear and unrefined, and therefore lack poignancy.

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So his targets are amorphous, but what about his actual creative body of work?

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Well...

129
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Finally gave up on those stupid doodles.

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
They're not stupid. They're not stupid.

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
No, Tom, they quite are.

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He's got a bag of eyes on the other end with the baboon eyes.

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
See, film students, you want your auteur theory? It's right the f*** here.

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Fellini's 8 1⁄2. Boudin's Contempt. Green's Freddy Got Fingered.

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
All shocking insights into the souls of their creators.

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Ding dong! Ding dong! Ding dong!

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What? At least I'm trying.

138
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This scene, for instance...

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You really want to be an animator? Get inside the walls.

140
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Earlier in what I think is the second act. Raw human idiocy.

141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Raw human idiocy.

142
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And you may be wondering if this thing comes back into the movie in any way, shape, or form.

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Huh.

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I wasn't expecting that to happen.

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Knowing what I remember about Green, the way he treats his friend, and especially his poor parents on his TV show,

146
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
this film makes a creepy amount of sense as to how Tom Green sees the world.

147
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
A world full of people telling him to shut up.

148
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Shut up! Shut up! Just shut the f*** up!

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's particularly fascinating in that people don't get what he wants,

150
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and he, under the delusion that he does know what he wants, well...

151
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Daddy, would you like some sausage?

152
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Daddy, would you like some sausages?

153
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Daddy, would you like some sausage?

154
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Daddy, would you like some sausage indeed?

155
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Well, if we are going to humor the auteur notion,

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
then Tom Green, like most two-year-olds, is very fascinated with his dingle-dangle.

157
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Interpret that.

158
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Horses represent maturity, as owning a horse meant the onset of adulthood, freedom of mobility.

159
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
When he strokes the horse's penis, he calls out,

160
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He calls out,

161
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
As if trying to impress his father.

162
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Perhaps the exaggerated phallus could mean the onset of manhood?

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And this interpretation...

164
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Extracted directly from my anus, yes.

165
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You know it's art, because this scene is neither mentioned nor referred to again.

166
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Well, it was motif-wise.

167
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Green wields a giant sausage in the cheese sandwich factory, yet another phallic object,

168
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
again in the apartment of the love interest,

169
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
who insists repeatedly upon her enjoyment of filleting him.

170
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
She has an obsession with long, hard rockets,

171
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and when indulging her oral fixation,

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
she stops when she realizes that he's taped an umbilical cord to his stomach.

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's my umbilical cord.

174
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
See, look, motifs! It's getting more and more artsy every agonizing minute.

175
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Uh, is there anything we can say about this love interest?

176
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
She exists.

177
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Besides the fact that she exists?

178
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
She has a nice place.

179
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Not played by Green's then-girlfriend and future ex-wife Drew Barrymore,

180
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
who does appear in the film briefly to scream and be abused,

181
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
the poor, maligned love interest is played by, uh, poor man's Tara Reid.

182
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And Tara Reid is the poor man's Tara Reid.

183
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
She has a strange fixation on performing fellatio,

184
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
and in a role reversal, it is he who is put off by her strangeness,

185
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
longing for normalcy despite his own taped-on umbilical cord.

186
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's my umbilical cord.

187
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And there's that hardly subtle pan from the beginning of fellatio

188
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
to a photo montage of the Eiffel Tower being built.

189
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And the love interest does have an unhealthy obsession with rockets.

190
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And I like rockets, because they're hot and hard and long.

191
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And the parade of dongs just marches on.

192
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
This movie is 70% phallic symbol.

193
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The love interest is fascinating,

194
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
partially because she seems very pervertedly designed

195
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
to appeal to people with a virgin whore complex.

196
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
How so?

197
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Well, she's obsessed with fellatio,

198
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
so she can appeal to men who want a demon in the sack.

199
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm gonna give you a blowjob.

200
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
However, she's also virginal because they don't have sex.

201
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
He simply whacks her paraplegic legs with a bamboo stick,

202
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
and that gets her off.

203
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
She's also a nurse, and therefore a perfect caregiver.

204
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But she's wheelchair-bound, so she needs someone to care for her.

205
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
She's like a twisted parody of every market-tested universal love interest

206
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
in rom-com history.

207
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's a bit sickening.

208
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And worst of all, she gives us an excuse to get into the hospital.

209
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And this is bad, because...

210
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Quick, think of a joke!

211
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
That was the second worst thing I've ever seen on film

212
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
involving a newborn baby.

213
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The worst thing is, of course, this.

214
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The biggest crux of the plot, if you look hard enough,

215
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
is Gord's relationship to his father, played by Rip Torn.

216
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Played by Rip Torn as less of a human

217
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and more like a warthog who learned English.

218
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And the whole film is essentially Gord trying to win the affection of his father,

219
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
leading to endless scenes of Green and Torn yelling at each other like orangutans.

220
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Though it's tough not to empathize with Torn, considering Green's antics.

221
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
A whole room full of dangling phallic symbols.

222
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The main source of tension between them is the fact that

223
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Green is a psychotic, unemployed adult child

224
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
who stages idiotic stunts like this.

225
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What the fuck is going on?

226
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm underwater! Look, I found a treasure!

227
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And he has this bizarre habit of repeating words and phrases ad nauseum.

228
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm gonna make you proud, Daddy.

229
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You're gonna be so proud?

230
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Proud.

231
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Look at me, Daddy! I'm a farmer!

232
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Look at me, Daddy! I'm a farmer!

233
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm a farmer, Daddy!

234
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Any idea what that's about?

235
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm leaning towards an absurdist interpretation,

236
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
like the repetition is him trying to emulate Eugene Ionesco.

237
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Name drop.

238
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Although absurdism was usually meant to illustrate something deeply wrong with society.

239
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Humanity, whatever.

240
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
This only seems to be taking issue with other comedy movies.

241
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's like an exaggeration of other schlock.

242
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yes, like that scene in the restaurant where they do the cliche

243
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
classical music plays while hijinks ensue bit.

244
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And he draws attention to how bad the joke essentially is.

245
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Well, I know none of you are wondering,

246
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
how does Gord's story pay off?

247
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
First, with him getting his wish,

248
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
despite his talent level for his art of choice being deeply in the red.

249
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
With that kind of creativity,

250
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm completely comfortable greenlighting this fucking project.

251
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Well, that explains how this movie got greenlit.

252
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And this is the project that Anthony Michael Hall got for his millions.

253
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Hear the funny sound?

254
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Hear the funny sound?

255
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's my hooves!

256
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's my hooves!

257
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
My hooves!

258
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
My hooves!

259
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Zebra in America!

260
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Some poor Claude had to animate this shit.

261
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Although, to be fair, he did accurately predict

262
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
about 70 to 80% of the content of Adult Swim in YouTube.

263
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
With this unrealistically giant check he gets for this cartoon,

264
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
he takes the money, spends half on jewels for his lady love.

265
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I don't care about jewels.

266
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I just want to suck your cock.

267
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I guess this is green's measure of a winner.

268
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And he spends the rest of the movie in a large elaborate revenge fantasy

269
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
where he transports his father to Pakistan

270
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
and sprays him with elephant semen.

271
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Um, parallel with the horse penis before,

272
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
continuation of the phallic motif.

273
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Nah, I give up.

274
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's planting and payoff.

275
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What? It is!

276
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Like, in the beginning of the film,

277
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
he learns the art of jerking off large mammals,

278
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
which is then paid off at the end of the film

279
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
when he successfully jerks off the elephant

280
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and torpedoes his own father into the stomach

281
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
with gallons and gallons of elephant bunk.

282
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's art!

283
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
God, green's an idiot.

284
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah, the whole semen thing is really kind of like...

285
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
No, this scene takes place on the Indian subcontinent

286
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
and that is clearly an African elephant.

287
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Idiot!

288
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And he comes back to America and is greeted as a hero.

289
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And there's an American flag hastily superimposed on the green's face,

290
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
even though he's Canadian.

291
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And by this point,

292
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
the whole movie basically coalesces into a morass of...

293
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Why?

294
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Why?

295
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Oh, dear Jesus God, why?

296
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
No, see, he's okay.

297
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The movie said so.

298
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And they didn't jam that into the last second

299
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
to avoid an NC-17 rating at all.

300
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Though one important question remains.

301
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What the hell did Drew Barrymore see in him?

302
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Not that one.

303
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Why is this called Freddy Got Fingered?

304
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
At a point somewhere between the 6th and 8th hour of the film,

305
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Gord lies about how his father sexually abused his brother,

306
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
who is barely in the film at all.

307
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Then, while Tom Green's cancer special plays on Freddy's TV,

308
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
the state comes and takes him to a children's home

309
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
where Freddy stays for the duration of the film.

310
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You may wonder, if Freddy was actually fingered,

311
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
as an adult, wouldn't he just be suggested therapy

312
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
and not simply sent to a home?

313
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Wouldn't that be against the law for an adult?

314
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But then you'd also have to wonder why Green wasn't arrested for this...

315
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
or this...

316
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
or fired for this...

317
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
and a thousand other tiny things.

318
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And that...

319
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
would simply drive you mad.

320
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I don't hate it.

321
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I can't.

322
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
See, I prefer to review movies that try and engage you.

323
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
This...

324
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
doesn't even try.

325
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Like, this might cause pain, but

326
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I cannot hate it because it cannot fail

327
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
because it does not try.

328
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Then again, it does not try, but succeeds in not trying.

329
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Its goal is not to engage the audience, but alienate it.

330
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's a shock anti-comedy.

331
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Taking a formula common to comedies at the time,

332
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
a down-on-his-luck creative young adult must overcome his family

333
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
and make it big in comedy, rock, music, animation, whatever's cool at the moment,

334
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
and warping it into a bittersweet against lowbrow comedy

335
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
churned out by the Farrelly's and the Wayans and the Sandler's of Hollywood.

336
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
This might mean that Freddy got fingered as to comedy

337
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
what a Serbian film is to horror.

338
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I feel like Tom Green somehow punked the whole world for a few years

339
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
by being popular.

340
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Everyone in this movie is too good for this.

341
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Even Rip Torn.

342
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Even Shaq.

343
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
His then-girlfriend, who he happily abuses on screen.

344
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Everyone.

345
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And there's a place for that.

346
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
There's a place for transgression in art.

347
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Some boundaries need to be pushed,

348
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
and some societal norms need to be challenged.

349
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
But you could call anything art.

350
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Betty told me this is what I need to do in order to become an artist.

351
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You could call trolling art.

352
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
This entire film is analogous to the internet trollface meme.

353
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It does not worsen or intensify in pain upon watching this image

354
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
for the same length of time.

355
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So what you're saying is...

356
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Canada must be punished.

357
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
But we are but two internet reviewers.

358
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
We are so impotent.

359
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So powerless.

360
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Not entirely impotent.

361
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
This is for Pickleback!

362
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Sorry.

363
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
This is for burning down the White House!

364
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Why are you doing this?
