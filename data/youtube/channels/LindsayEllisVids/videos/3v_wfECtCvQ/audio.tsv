0	5000	Whew. I don't know about you, but to me, Tom Green is pretty nostalgic.
10000	12000	Like, how did this happen, America?
12000	16000	Tom Green was very flash in the pan, and for those of you who don't remember,
16000	19000	Tom Green came to international fame through his MTV talk show.
19000	22000	Here's a guy who was funny only to 13-year-old idiots.
22000	25000	Unfortunately, there are a lot of 13-year-old idiots.
25000	28000	And the Tom Green show's popularity skyrocketed,
28000	32000	featuring such cutting-edge documentary-style stories as breaking shit in stores,
34000	36000	painting graphic porn on your parents' car,
36000	38000	torturing your friends,
38000	40000	and shoving shit in people's faces.
43000	48000	Basically, Tom Green's brand of comedy was to annoy the hell out of all unfortunates in his path.
48000	51000	And what else could bring a man that degree of popularity that quickly?
51000	58000	But in order to do an episode on Tom Green, I'd have to look at the entire Tom Green catalog,
58000	61000	and I don't think I have enough brain juice for that.
61000	63000	Hey, didn't Tom Green make a movie?
63000	67000	You're right. He did.
67000	72000	Given the obvious trajectory, for anyone who gets even the smallest modicum of fame ever,
72000	75000	as Kevin Smith once put it, failing upward,
75000	79000	Tom Green made the leap from MTV's sensation of annoying to silver screen phenomenon
80000	82000	that he might annoy even more people,
82000	85000	to the point that in a mere two years since his debut on MTV,
85000	89000	Green's star had risen so high that Regency and 20th Century Fox said,
89000	92000	here, have 15 million dollars.
92000	94000	Write and direct a movie.
94000	97000	Freddy Got Fingered is a surprisingly traditional story,
97000	100000	the tale of an aspiring animator who can't catch a break.
100000	104000	It deals mainly with Gord, played by Green, and his daddy issues.
104000	107000	Widely considered to be one of the very worst films ever made,
107000	111000	it was panned at the time of its release, winning five Razzies in the process.
111000	114000	Even Roger Ebert, who likes everything, wrote in his review,
114000	118000	This movie isn't the bottom of the barrel.
118000	122000	This movie isn't below the bottom of the barrel.
122000	129000	This movie doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels.
129000	132000	Ebert went on to say that while the day would never, ever, ever come
132000	134000	that the film could be considered funny,
134000	139000	the day might come where it might be considered a masterpiece of neo-surrealist dadaist cinema.
139000	142000	In fact, the film has gained something of a cult following
142000	144000	and has a little bit of a renaissance based on the
144000	147000	I-can't-tell-if-they're-being-hipster-ironic belief
147000	150000	that this film is a countercultural art piece.
150000	154000	Not so bad it's good, so bad it's art.
154000	158000	So, one little ol' 90 minute movie instead of an entire television series.
158000	159000	That will keep it short.
159000	162000	Yeah, this'll be much easier.
162000	164000	How bad could it be?
193000	195000	AHHHHH
206000	207000	AHHHH
208000	211000	It's mostly worn off for me.
211000	212000	AHHHH
214000	217000	I think I've reached words again.
217000	221000	I can't finish this, but I'm contractually obligated to finish it.
221000	225000	Damn Channel Awesome and its contractual obligations.
225000	228000	I mean, I could push it on someone else.
228000	231000	What about those people who think it's an art film?
235000	238000	Hello, Kyle, the new art film critic guy.
238000	243000	Yeah, you want to review Freddy Got Fingered With Me, the neo-surrealist art film?
243000	247000	No, no, no, you don't need to come here. We'll meet you halfway.
248000	249000	Bye.
252000	255000	This is it.
255000	256000	Okay, well.
256000	259000	Kyle, did you watch the movie yet?
260000	261000	Kyle?
270000	271000	My God.
273000	274000	Ew.
274000	276000	Is that what I think it...
277000	278000	Oh my God!
278000	279000	Kyle!
280000	281000	Oh Kyle!
281000	282000	Oh my God!
282000	283000	Oh God!
283000	285000	Oh God, wake up, wake up!
285000	286000	Oh God.
286000	288000	Oh, oh God.
289000	292000	Quick, sing something from Les Mis.
293000	296000	There's a grief that can't be spoken.
296000	297000	Oh God.
297000	298000	He's there.
298000	300000	There's a pain goes on and on.
300000	301000	That's enough.
301000	303000	Empty chairs and empty...
303000	304000	Kyle!
305000	306000	Oh God.
306000	307000	Alright.
307000	308000	Alright.
308000	309000	Wow, you're taller than I remember.
309000	311000	Next musical review for realsies, I promise.
311000	313000	So anyway, tell us how this is a Dadaist master...
313000	315000	This cannot be Dada!
316000	318000	It's too normal to be Dada!
318000	320000	It's too shit to be anything else!
321000	324000	Use your smart mouth words.
325000	326000	Okay.
326000	328000	Let me go towel off.
331000	332000	Have at it.
332000	333000	Have at it.
337000	338000	Dada.
340000	344000	A movement begun in Zurich by the likes of Hugo Ball, Tristan Tzara, and Hans Richter
344000	347000	that flourished in the decade immediately after the end of World War I.
347000	349000	It was started out of cynicism.
349000	352000	They believed that any culture that could have produced such a horrible and human bloodbath
352000	355000	like the First World War had no intrinsic value.
355000	358000	So, Dada was set up as anti-art.
358000	361000	Art that aims to destroy all other art.
363000	368000	In order to be called a Dadaist piece, there would have to be no plot at all.
368000	373000	Not even the sad facsimile of plot, which resembles more that of early Adam Sandler comedies.
373000	377000	But honestly, the things Green does in this film don't stray far from the usual things one would have seen
377000	380000	in the most highly regarded performance art of the last 20 years.
380000	384000	I would like to remind people that the most highly regarded performance art of the last 20 years
384000	389000	included a theatrical piece where a woman stripped naked and bathed herself in honey
389000	393000	while reciting a monologue about Winnie the Pooh doing BDSM.
393000	396000	And before you ask, I'm not making a word of that up.
397000	400000	Talk about the whole Tom Green oeuvre.
400000	403000	I can't talk about the Tom Green oeuvre.
403000	404000	Well, why not?
404000	407000	I don't know anything about the Tom Green oeuvre.
412000	413000	Well, I do.
413000	416000	I gotta get the pooh off my bum! Pooh, pooh!
416000	422000	The original Canadian rapper-slash-actor, the Orson Welles of our time, Tom Green.
422000	427000	As someone who may or may not have been addicted to MTV at the height of the whole Tom Green thing,
427000	433000	and may or may not have voted for the Bum Bum song on TRO and watched all of his first series, I get it.
433000	438000	This film was, however, realistically the only film the studio could have expected to get for their money.
438000	442000	Tom Green is scared and confused in a directionless sort of way.
442000	445000	I can't think of anything to draw because I'm so stupid!
445000	449000	He hates society. He hates Adam Sandler movies, apparently.
449000	453000	But his hate is aimless. His goals are unclear and unrefined, and therefore lack poignancy.
453000	457000	So his targets are amorphous, but what about his actual creative body of work?
457000	459000	Well...
459000	462000	Finally gave up on those stupid doodles.
462000	464000	They're not stupid. They're not stupid.
464000	465000	No, Tom, they quite are.
465000	469000	He's got a bag of eyes on the other end with the baboon eyes.
470000	473000	See, film students, you want your auteur theory? It's right the f*** here.
473000	478000	Fellini's 8 1‚ÅÑ2. Boudin's Contempt. Green's Freddy Got Fingered.
478000	481000	All shocking insights into the souls of their creators.
481000	485000	Ding dong! Ding dong! Ding dong!
485000	488000	What? At least I'm trying.
488000	489000	This scene, for instance...
489000	493000	You really want to be an animator? Get inside the walls.
493000	497000	Earlier in what I think is the second act. Raw human idiocy.
497000	498000	Raw human idiocy.
504000	508000	And you may be wondering if this thing comes back into the movie in any way, shape, or form.
509000	510000	Huh.
510000	514000	I wasn't expecting that to happen.
514000	520000	Knowing what I remember about Green, the way he treats his friend, and especially his poor parents on his TV show,
520000	524000	this film makes a creepy amount of sense as to how Tom Green sees the world.
524000	527000	A world full of people telling him to shut up.
527000	530000	Shut up! Shut up! Just shut the f*** up!
530000	534000	It's particularly fascinating in that people don't get what he wants,
534000	539000	and he, under the delusion that he does know what he wants, well...
539000	541000	Daddy, would you like some sausage?
541000	543000	Daddy, would you like some sausages?
543000	545000	Daddy, would you like some sausage?
545000	548000	Daddy, would you like some sausage indeed?
548000	550000	Well, if we are going to humor the auteur notion,
550000	555000	then Tom Green, like most two-year-olds, is very fascinated with his dingle-dangle.
565000	566000	Interpret that.
567000	573000	Horses represent maturity, as owning a horse meant the onset of adulthood, freedom of mobility.
573000	575000	When he strokes the horse's penis, he calls out,
575000	576000	He calls out,
578000	580000	As if trying to impress his father.
580000	584000	Perhaps the exaggerated phallus could mean the onset of manhood?
584000	586000	And this interpretation...
586000	588000	Extracted directly from my anus, yes.
588000	592000	You know it's art, because this scene is neither mentioned nor referred to again.
592000	594000	Well, it was motif-wise.
594000	598000	Green wields a giant sausage in the cheese sandwich factory, yet another phallic object,
598000	600000	again in the apartment of the love interest,
600000	603000	who insists repeatedly upon her enjoyment of filleting him.
603000	605000	She has an obsession with long, hard rockets,
605000	607000	and when indulging her oral fixation,
607000	611000	she stops when she realizes that he's taped an umbilical cord to his stomach.
611000	613000	That's my umbilical cord.
613000	618000	See, look, motifs! It's getting more and more artsy every agonizing minute.
618000	622000	Uh, is there anything we can say about this love interest?
622000	623000	She exists.
623000	625000	Besides the fact that she exists?
627000	629000	She has a nice place.
629000	634000	Not played by Green's then-girlfriend and future ex-wife Drew Barrymore,
634000	637000	who does appear in the film briefly to scream and be abused,
637000	642000	the poor, maligned love interest is played by, uh, poor man's Tara Reid.
642000	644000	And Tara Reid is the poor man's Tara Reid.
644000	647000	She has a strange fixation on performing fellatio,
647000	650000	and in a role reversal, it is he who is put off by her strangeness,
650000	654000	longing for normalcy despite his own taped-on umbilical cord.
654000	656000	That's my umbilical cord.
656000	658000	And there's that hardly subtle pan from the beginning of fellatio
658000	661000	to a photo montage of the Eiffel Tower being built.
661000	665000	And the love interest does have an unhealthy obsession with rockets.
665000	670000	And I like rockets, because they're hot and hard and long.
670000	673000	And the parade of dongs just marches on.
673000	675000	This movie is 70% phallic symbol.
675000	677000	The love interest is fascinating,
677000	679000	partially because she seems very pervertedly designed
679000	682000	to appeal to people with a virgin whore complex.
682000	683000	How so?
683000	685000	Well, she's obsessed with fellatio,
685000	688000	so she can appeal to men who want a demon in the sack.
688000	690000	I'm gonna give you a blowjob.
690000	694000	However, she's also virginal because they don't have sex.
694000	697000	He simply whacks her paraplegic legs with a bamboo stick,
697000	698000	and that gets her off.
698000	701000	She's also a nurse, and therefore a perfect caregiver.
701000	705000	But she's wheelchair-bound, so she needs someone to care for her.
705000	709000	She's like a twisted parody of every market-tested universal love interest
709000	710000	in rom-com history.
710000	712000	That's a bit sickening.
712000	716000	And worst of all, she gives us an excuse to get into the hospital.
716000	718000	And this is bad, because...
733000	735000	Quick, think of a joke!
735000	738000	That was the second worst thing I've ever seen on film
738000	741000	involving a newborn baby.
741000	743000	The worst thing is, of course, this.
748000	750000	The biggest crux of the plot, if you look hard enough,
750000	754000	is Gord's relationship to his father, played by Rip Torn.
754000	756000	Played by Rip Torn as less of a human
756000	758000	and more like a warthog who learned English.
762000	765000	And the whole film is essentially Gord trying to win the affection of his father,
765000	769000	leading to endless scenes of Green and Torn yelling at each other like orangutans.
769000	772000	Though it's tough not to empathize with Torn, considering Green's antics.
779000	782000	A whole room full of dangling phallic symbols.
782000	784000	The main source of tension between them is the fact that
784000	787000	Green is a psychotic, unemployed adult child
787000	789000	who stages idiotic stunts like this.
790000	792000	What the fuck is going on?
792000	795000	I'm underwater! Look, I found a treasure!
796000	800000	And he has this bizarre habit of repeating words and phrases ad nauseum.
800000	801000	I'm gonna make you proud, Daddy.
801000	802000	You're gonna be so proud?
802000	803000	Proud.
803000	805000	Look at me, Daddy! I'm a farmer!
805000	807000	Look at me, Daddy! I'm a farmer!
807000	809000	I'm a farmer, Daddy!
809000	811000	Any idea what that's about?
811000	814000	I'm leaning towards an absurdist interpretation,
814000	817000	like the repetition is him trying to emulate Eugene Ionesco.
818000	819000	Name drop.
819000	823000	Although absurdism was usually meant to illustrate something deeply wrong with society.
823000	825000	Humanity, whatever.
825000	828000	This only seems to be taking issue with other comedy movies.
828000	830000	It's like an exaggeration of other schlock.
830000	833000	Yes, like that scene in the restaurant where they do the cliche
833000	836000	classical music plays while hijinks ensue bit.
836000	839000	And he draws attention to how bad the joke essentially is.
843000	845000	Well, I know none of you are wondering,
845000	847000	how does Gord's story pay off?
847000	849000	First, with him getting his wish,
849000	852000	despite his talent level for his art of choice being deeply in the red.
852000	854000	With that kind of creativity,
854000	857000	I'm completely comfortable greenlighting this fucking project.
857000	859000	Well, that explains how this movie got greenlit.
859000	862000	And this is the project that Anthony Michael Hall got for his millions.
862000	864000	Hear the funny sound?
864000	865000	Hear the funny sound?
865000	867000	It's my hooves!
867000	868000	It's my hooves!
868000	869000	My hooves!
869000	870000	My hooves!
870000	873000	Zebra in America!
874000	877000	Some poor Claude had to animate this shit.
877000	880000	Although, to be fair, he did accurately predict
880000	884000	about 70 to 80% of the content of Adult Swim in YouTube.
884000	887000	With this unrealistically giant check he gets for this cartoon,
887000	891000	he takes the money, spends half on jewels for his lady love.
892000	894000	I don't care about jewels.
894000	897000	I just want to suck your cock.
897000	900000	I guess this is green's measure of a winner.
900000	903000	And he spends the rest of the movie in a large elaborate revenge fantasy
903000	905000	where he transports his father to Pakistan
905000	908000	and sprays him with elephant semen.
910000	913000	Um, parallel with the horse penis before,
913000	915000	continuation of the phallic motif.
915000	916000	Nah, I give up.
916000	918000	It's planting and payoff.
918000	920000	What? It is!
920000	922000	Like, in the beginning of the film,
922000	925000	he learns the art of jerking off large mammals,
925000	927000	which is then paid off at the end of the film
927000	929000	when he successfully jerks off the elephant
929000	932000	and torpedoes his own father into the stomach
932000	935000	with gallons and gallons of elephant bunk.
935000	936000	It's art!
936000	938000	God, green's an idiot.
938000	940000	Yeah, the whole semen thing is really kind of like...
940000	942000	No, this scene takes place on the Indian subcontinent
942000	945000	and that is clearly an African elephant.
945000	947000	Idiot!
947000	950000	And he comes back to America and is greeted as a hero.
950000	953000	And there's an American flag hastily superimposed on the green's face,
953000	954000	even though he's Canadian.
954000	955000	And by this point,
955000	958000	the whole movie basically coalesces into a morass of...
958000	960000	Why?
960000	961000	Why?
965000	967000	Oh, dear Jesus God, why?
971000	972000	No, see, he's okay.
972000	974000	The movie said so.
974000	976000	And they didn't jam that into the last second
976000	979000	to avoid an NC-17 rating at all.
979000	981000	Though one important question remains.
982000	984000	What the hell did Drew Barrymore see in him?
984000	986000	Not that one.
986000	989000	Why is this called Freddy Got Fingered?
989000	992000	At a point somewhere between the 6th and 8th hour of the film,
992000	995000	Gord lies about how his father sexually abused his brother,
995000	997000	who is barely in the film at all.
997000	1001000	Then, while Tom Green's cancer special plays on Freddy's TV,
1001000	1004000	the state comes and takes him to a children's home
1004000	1007000	where Freddy stays for the duration of the film.
1007000	1010000	You may wonder, if Freddy was actually fingered,
1010000	1012000	as an adult, wouldn't he just be suggested therapy
1012000	1014000	and not simply sent to a home?
1014000	1016000	Wouldn't that be against the law for an adult?
1016000	1020000	But then you'd also have to wonder why Green wasn't arrested for this...
1022000	1023000	or this...
1027000	1029000	or fired for this...
1031000	1034000	and a thousand other tiny things.
1034000	1036000	And that...
1036000	1039000	would simply drive you mad.
1039000	1041000	I don't hate it.
1041000	1042000	I can't.
1042000	1046000	See, I prefer to review movies that try and engage you.
1046000	1048000	This...
1048000	1049000	doesn't even try.
1049000	1052000	Like, this might cause pain, but
1052000	1054000	I cannot hate it because it cannot fail
1054000	1056000	because it does not try.
1056000	1060000	Then again, it does not try, but succeeds in not trying.
1060000	1063000	Its goal is not to engage the audience, but alienate it.
1063000	1065000	It's a shock anti-comedy.
1065000	1067000	Taking a formula common to comedies at the time,
1067000	1070000	a down-on-his-luck creative young adult must overcome his family
1070000	1073000	and make it big in comedy, rock, music, animation, whatever's cool at the moment,
1073000	1076000	and warping it into a bittersweet against lowbrow comedy
1076000	1080000	churned out by the Farrelly's and the Wayans and the Sandler's of Hollywood.
1080000	1082000	This might mean that Freddy got fingered as to comedy
1082000	1085000	what a Serbian film is to horror.
1085000	1089000	I feel like Tom Green somehow punked the whole world for a few years
1089000	1091000	by being popular.
1091000	1094000	Everyone in this movie is too good for this.
1094000	1096000	Even Rip Torn.
1096000	1098000	Even Shaq.
1102000	1106000	His then-girlfriend, who he happily abuses on screen.
1106000	1108000	Everyone.
1108000	1110000	And there's a place for that.
1110000	1112000	There's a place for transgression in art.
1112000	1114000	Some boundaries need to be pushed,
1114000	1117000	and some societal norms need to be challenged.
1117000	1119000	But you could call anything art.
1119000	1122000	Betty told me this is what I need to do in order to become an artist.
1122000	1124000	You could call trolling art.
1124000	1127000	This entire film is analogous to the internet trollface meme.
1127000	1130000	It does not worsen or intensify in pain upon watching this image
1130000	1132000	for the same length of time.
1132000	1134000	So what you're saying is...
1134000	1136000	Canada must be punished.
1136000	1138000	But we are but two internet reviewers.
1138000	1140000	We are so impotent.
1140000	1143000	So powerless.
1143000	1146000	Not entirely impotent.
1151000	1153000	This is for Pickleback!
1153000	1154000	Sorry.
1154000	1156000	This is for burning down the White House!
1158000	1160000	Why are you doing this?
