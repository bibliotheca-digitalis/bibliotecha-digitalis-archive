00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Whew. I don't know about you, but to me, Tom Green is pretty nostalgic.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Like, how did this happen, America?

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
Tom Green was very flash in the pan, and for those of you who don't remember,

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Tom Green came to international fame through his MTV talk show.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Here's a guy who was funny only to 13-year-old idiots.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Unfortunately, there are a lot of 13-year-old idiots.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
And the Tom Green show's popularity skyrocketed,

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
featuring such cutting-edge documentary-style stories as breaking shit in stores,

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
painting graphic porn on your parents' car,

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
torturing your friends,

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
and shoving shit in people's faces.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
Basically, Tom Green's brand of comedy was to annoy the hell out of all unfortunates in his path.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
And what else could bring a man that degree of popularity that quickly?

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
But in order to do an episode on Tom Green, I'd have to look at the entire Tom Green catalog,

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
and I don't think I have enough brain juice for that.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Hey, didn't Tom Green make a movie?

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
You're right. He did.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
Given the obvious trajectory, for anyone who gets even the smallest modicum of fame ever,

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
as Kevin Smith once put it, failing upward,

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Tom Green made the leap from MTV's sensation of annoying to silver screen phenomenon

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
that he might annoy even more people,

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
to the point that in a mere two years since his debut on MTV,

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Green's star had risen so high that Regency and 20th Century Fox said,

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
here, have 15 million dollars.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Write and direct a movie.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
Freddy Got Fingered is a surprisingly traditional story,

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
the tale of an aspiring animator who can't catch a break.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
It deals mainly with Gord, played by Green, and his daddy issues.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Widely considered to be one of the very worst films ever made,

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
it was panned at the time of its release, winning five Razzies in the process.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Even Roger Ebert, who likes everything, wrote in his review,

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
This movie isn't the bottom of the barrel.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
This movie isn't below the bottom of the barrel.

02:02.000 --> 02:09.000
This movie doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Ebert went on to say that while the day would never, ever, ever come

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
that the film could be considered funny,

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
the day might come where it might be considered a masterpiece of neo-surrealist dadaist cinema.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
In fact, the film has gained something of a cult following

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
and has a little bit of a renaissance based on the

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
I-can't-tell-if-they're-being-hipster-ironic belief

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
that this film is a countercultural art piece.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
Not so bad it's good, so bad it's art.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
So, one little ol' 90 minute movie instead of an entire television series.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
That will keep it short.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
Yeah, this'll be much easier.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
How bad could it be?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
AHHHHH

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
AHHHH

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
It's mostly worn off for me.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
AHHHH

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
I think I've reached words again.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
I can't finish this, but I'm contractually obligated to finish it.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
Damn Channel Awesome and its contractual obligations.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
I mean, I could push it on someone else.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
What about those people who think it's an art film?

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Hello, Kyle, the new art film critic guy.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
Yeah, you want to review Freddy Got Fingered With Me, the neo-surrealist art film?

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
No, no, no, you don't need to come here. We'll meet you halfway.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Bye.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
This is it.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Okay, well.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Kyle, did you watch the movie yet?

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Kyle?

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
My God.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Ew.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Is that what I think it...

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Oh my God!

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Kyle!

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Oh Kyle!

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Oh my God!

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Oh God!

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Oh God, wake up, wake up!

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Oh God.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Oh, oh God.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Quick, sing something from Les Mis.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
There's a grief that can't be spoken.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Oh God.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
He's there.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
There's a pain goes on and on.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
That's enough.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Empty chairs and empty...

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Kyle!

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Oh God.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Alright.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Alright.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Wow, you're taller than I remember.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Next musical review for realsies, I promise.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
So anyway, tell us how this is a Dadaist master...

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
This cannot be Dada!

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
It's too normal to be Dada!

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
It's too shit to be anything else!

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Use your smart mouth words.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Okay.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Let me go towel off.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Have at it.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Have at it.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Dada.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
A movement begun in Zurich by the likes of Hugo Ball, Tristan Tzara, and Hans Richter

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
that flourished in the decade immediately after the end of World War I.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
It was started out of cynicism.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
They believed that any culture that could have produced such a horrible and human bloodbath

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
like the First World War had no intrinsic value.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
So, Dada was set up as anti-art.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Art that aims to destroy all other art.

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
In order to be called a Dadaist piece, there would have to be no plot at all.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
Not even the sad facsimile of plot, which resembles more that of early Adam Sandler comedies.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
But honestly, the things Green does in this film don't stray far from the usual things one would have seen

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
in the most highly regarded performance art of the last 20 years.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
I would like to remind people that the most highly regarded performance art of the last 20 years

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
included a theatrical piece where a woman stripped naked and bathed herself in honey

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
while reciting a monologue about Winnie the Pooh doing BDSM.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
And before you ask, I'm not making a word of that up.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Talk about the whole Tom Green oeuvre.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
I can't talk about the Tom Green oeuvre.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Well, why not?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
I don't know anything about the Tom Green oeuvre.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Well, I do.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
I gotta get the pooh off my bum! Pooh, pooh!

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
The original Canadian rapper-slash-actor, the Orson Welles of our time, Tom Green.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
As someone who may or may not have been addicted to MTV at the height of the whole Tom Green thing,

07:07.000 --> 07:13.000
and may or may not have voted for the Bum Bum song on TRO and watched all of his first series, I get it.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
This film was, however, realistically the only film the studio could have expected to get for their money.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
Tom Green is scared and confused in a directionless sort of way.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
I can't think of anything to draw because I'm so stupid!

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
He hates society. He hates Adam Sandler movies, apparently.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
But his hate is aimless. His goals are unclear and unrefined, and therefore lack poignancy.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
So his targets are amorphous, but what about his actual creative body of work?

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Well...

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Finally gave up on those stupid doodles.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
They're not stupid. They're not stupid.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
No, Tom, they quite are.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
He's got a bag of eyes on the other end with the baboon eyes.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
See, film students, you want your auteur theory? It's right the f*** here.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
Fellini's 8 1⁄2. Boudin's Contempt. Green's Freddy Got Fingered.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
All shocking insights into the souls of their creators.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
Ding dong! Ding dong! Ding dong!

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
What? At least I'm trying.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
This scene, for instance...

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
You really want to be an animator? Get inside the walls.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
Earlier in what I think is the second act. Raw human idiocy.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Raw human idiocy.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
And you may be wondering if this thing comes back into the movie in any way, shape, or form.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Huh.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
I wasn't expecting that to happen.

08:34.000 --> 08:40.000
Knowing what I remember about Green, the way he treats his friend, and especially his poor parents on his TV show,

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
this film makes a creepy amount of sense as to how Tom Green sees the world.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
A world full of people telling him to shut up.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Shut up! Shut up! Just shut the f*** up!

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
It's particularly fascinating in that people don't get what he wants,

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
and he, under the delusion that he does know what he wants, well...

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Daddy, would you like some sausage?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Daddy, would you like some sausages?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Daddy, would you like some sausage?

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Daddy, would you like some sausage indeed?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Well, if we are going to humor the auteur notion,

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
then Tom Green, like most two-year-olds, is very fascinated with his dingle-dangle.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Interpret that.

09:27.000 --> 09:33.000
Horses represent maturity, as owning a horse meant the onset of adulthood, freedom of mobility.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
When he strokes the horse's penis, he calls out,

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
He calls out,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
As if trying to impress his father.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
Perhaps the exaggerated phallus could mean the onset of manhood?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
And this interpretation...

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Extracted directly from my anus, yes.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
You know it's art, because this scene is neither mentioned nor referred to again.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Well, it was motif-wise.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
Green wields a giant sausage in the cheese sandwich factory, yet another phallic object,

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
again in the apartment of the love interest,

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
who insists repeatedly upon her enjoyment of filleting him.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
She has an obsession with long, hard rockets,

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
and when indulging her oral fixation,

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
she stops when she realizes that he's taped an umbilical cord to his stomach.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
That's my umbilical cord.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.000
See, look, motifs! It's getting more and more artsy every agonizing minute.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
Uh, is there anything we can say about this love interest?

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
She exists.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Besides the fact that she exists?

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
She has a nice place.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
Not played by Green's then-girlfriend and future ex-wife Drew Barrymore,

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
who does appear in the film briefly to scream and be abused,

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
the poor, maligned love interest is played by, uh, poor man's Tara Reid.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
And Tara Reid is the poor man's Tara Reid.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
She has a strange fixation on performing fellatio,

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
and in a role reversal, it is he who is put off by her strangeness,

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
longing for normalcy despite his own taped-on umbilical cord.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
That's my umbilical cord.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
And there's that hardly subtle pan from the beginning of fellatio

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
to a photo montage of the Eiffel Tower being built.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
And the love interest does have an unhealthy obsession with rockets.

11:05.000 --> 11:10.000
And I like rockets, because they're hot and hard and long.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
And the parade of dongs just marches on.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
This movie is 70% phallic symbol.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
The love interest is fascinating,

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
partially because she seems very pervertedly designed

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
to appeal to people with a virgin whore complex.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
How so?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Well, she's obsessed with fellatio,

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
so she can appeal to men who want a demon in the sack.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
I'm gonna give you a blowjob.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
However, she's also virginal because they don't have sex.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
He simply whacks her paraplegic legs with a bamboo stick,

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
and that gets her off.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
She's also a nurse, and therefore a perfect caregiver.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
But she's wheelchair-bound, so she needs someone to care for her.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
She's like a twisted parody of every market-tested universal love interest

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
in rom-com history.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
That's a bit sickening.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
And worst of all, she gives us an excuse to get into the hospital.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
And this is bad, because...

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Quick, think of a joke!

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
That was the second worst thing I've ever seen on film

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
involving a newborn baby.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
The worst thing is, of course, this.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
The biggest crux of the plot, if you look hard enough,

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
is Gord's relationship to his father, played by Rip Torn.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Played by Rip Torn as less of a human

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
and more like a warthog who learned English.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
And the whole film is essentially Gord trying to win the affection of his father,

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
leading to endless scenes of Green and Torn yelling at each other like orangutans.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
Though it's tough not to empathize with Torn, considering Green's antics.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
A whole room full of dangling phallic symbols.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
The main source of tension between them is the fact that

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Green is a psychotic, unemployed adult child

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
who stages idiotic stunts like this.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
What the fuck is going on?

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
I'm underwater! Look, I found a treasure!

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
And he has this bizarre habit of repeating words and phrases ad nauseum.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
I'm gonna make you proud, Daddy.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
You're gonna be so proud?

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Proud.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Look at me, Daddy! I'm a farmer!

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Look at me, Daddy! I'm a farmer!

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
I'm a farmer, Daddy!

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Any idea what that's about?

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
I'm leaning towards an absurdist interpretation,

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
like the repetition is him trying to emulate Eugene Ionesco.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Name drop.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
Although absurdism was usually meant to illustrate something deeply wrong with society.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Humanity, whatever.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
This only seems to be taking issue with other comedy movies.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
It's like an exaggeration of other schlock.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
Yes, like that scene in the restaurant where they do the cliche

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
classical music plays while hijinks ensue bit.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
And he draws attention to how bad the joke essentially is.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Well, I know none of you are wondering,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
how does Gord's story pay off?

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
First, with him getting his wish,

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
despite his talent level for his art of choice being deeply in the red.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
With that kind of creativity,

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
I'm completely comfortable greenlighting this fucking project.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Well, that explains how this movie got greenlit.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
And this is the project that Anthony Michael Hall got for his millions.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Hear the funny sound?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Hear the funny sound?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
It's my hooves!

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
It's my hooves!

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
My hooves!

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
My hooves!

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Zebra in America!

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
Some poor Claude had to animate this shit.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
Although, to be fair, he did accurately predict

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
about 70 to 80% of the content of Adult Swim in YouTube.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
With this unrealistically giant check he gets for this cartoon,

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
he takes the money, spends half on jewels for his lady love.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
I don't care about jewels.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
I just want to suck your cock.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
I guess this is green's measure of a winner.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
And he spends the rest of the movie in a large elaborate revenge fantasy

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
where he transports his father to Pakistan

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
and sprays him with elephant semen.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
Um, parallel with the horse penis before,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
continuation of the phallic motif.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Nah, I give up.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
It's planting and payoff.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
What? It is!

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Like, in the beginning of the film,

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
he learns the art of jerking off large mammals,

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
which is then paid off at the end of the film

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
when he successfully jerks off the elephant

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
and torpedoes his own father into the stomach

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
with gallons and gallons of elephant bunk.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
It's art!

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
God, green's an idiot.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Yeah, the whole semen thing is really kind of like...

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
No, this scene takes place on the Indian subcontinent

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
and that is clearly an African elephant.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Idiot!

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
And he comes back to America and is greeted as a hero.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
And there's an American flag hastily superimposed on the green's face,

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
even though he's Canadian.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
And by this point,

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
the whole movie basically coalesces into a morass of...

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Why?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Why?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Oh, dear Jesus God, why?

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
No, see, he's okay.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
The movie said so.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
And they didn't jam that into the last second

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
to avoid an NC-17 rating at all.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Though one important question remains.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
What the hell did Drew Barrymore see in him?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Not that one.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
Why is this called Freddy Got Fingered?

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
At a point somewhere between the 6th and 8th hour of the film,

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
Gord lies about how his father sexually abused his brother,

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
who is barely in the film at all.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
Then, while Tom Green's cancer special plays on Freddy's TV,

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
the state comes and takes him to a children's home

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
where Freddy stays for the duration of the film.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
You may wonder, if Freddy was actually fingered,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
as an adult, wouldn't he just be suggested therapy

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
and not simply sent to a home?

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Wouldn't that be against the law for an adult?

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
But then you'd also have to wonder why Green wasn't arrested for this...

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
or this...

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
or fired for this...

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
and a thousand other tiny things.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
And that...

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
would simply drive you mad.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
I don't hate it.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
I can't.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
See, I prefer to review movies that try and engage you.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
This...

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
doesn't even try.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
Like, this might cause pain, but

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I cannot hate it because it cannot fail

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
because it does not try.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
Then again, it does not try, but succeeds in not trying.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
Its goal is not to engage the audience, but alienate it.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
It's a shock anti-comedy.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Taking a formula common to comedies at the time,

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
a down-on-his-luck creative young adult must overcome his family

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
and make it big in comedy, rock, music, animation, whatever's cool at the moment,

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
and warping it into a bittersweet against lowbrow comedy

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
churned out by the Farrelly's and the Wayans and the Sandler's of Hollywood.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
This might mean that Freddy got fingered as to comedy

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
what a Serbian film is to horror.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
I feel like Tom Green somehow punked the whole world for a few years

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
by being popular.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
Everyone in this movie is too good for this.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Even Rip Torn.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Even Shaq.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
His then-girlfriend, who he happily abuses on screen.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Everyone.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
And there's a place for that.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
There's a place for transgression in art.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Some boundaries need to be pushed,

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
and some societal norms need to be challenged.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
But you could call anything art.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
Betty told me this is what I need to do in order to become an artist.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
You could call trolling art.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
This entire film is analogous to the internet trollface meme.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
It does not worsen or intensify in pain upon watching this image

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
for the same length of time.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
So what you're saying is...

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Canada must be punished.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
But we are but two internet reviewers.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
We are so impotent.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
So powerless.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
Not entirely impotent.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
This is for Pickleback!

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Sorry.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
This is for burning down the White House!

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Why are you doing this?
