WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
God, this year has sucked.

00:05.460 --> 00:07.160
You remember at the beginning of the year

00:07.160 --> 00:10.080
when David Bowie died and we were all joking

00:10.080 --> 00:13.560
how much this year sucked and we had no idea?

00:13.560 --> 00:14.800
No idea.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.680
I know that on this channel I generally keep it

00:16.680 --> 00:21.680
to media related stuff and even then it's mostly theory

00:22.880 --> 00:26.840
and I know we're all kind of doing a little bit

00:26.840 --> 00:29.560
of soul searching right now and right now

00:29.560 --> 00:33.880
I know we're all kind of ranging from stressed

00:33.880 --> 00:38.780
to pants shittingly terrified and this is not made awesome

00:38.780 --> 00:40.720
by the fact that Thanksgiving is coming up

00:40.720 --> 00:44.840
and a lot of people are not looking forward

00:44.840 --> 00:46.880
to spending time with their families.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.520
Fortunately, my family's pretty cool

00:48.520 --> 00:53.040
so this is, of my many worries, this isn't one of them

00:53.040 --> 00:56.200
but in my pants shitting terror,

00:56.200 --> 00:59.000
part of what I've been doing is going to community meetings

00:59.040 --> 01:02.440
and rallies, learning coping strategies

01:02.440 --> 01:05.200
and also organization strategies going forward

01:05.200 --> 01:08.640
and so I wanted to share some of the stuff I have learned

01:08.640 --> 01:12.440
hoping that it might help you not only better deal

01:12.440 --> 01:15.280
with your family but also help begin the process

01:15.280 --> 01:18.680
of healing the divide, politically speaking.

01:18.680 --> 01:21.600
Like these are scary times but with the exception

01:21.600 --> 01:24.200
of the extreme right, you know, the literal Nazis

01:24.200 --> 01:27.560
and the massive assholes, most people I think

01:27.560 --> 01:29.840
are still receptive to change

01:29.840 --> 01:31.640
and I think a lot of us young white people

01:31.640 --> 01:35.240
on the more progressive side have really dropped the ball

01:35.240 --> 01:37.600
in terms of hermetically sealing ourselves

01:37.600 --> 01:41.400
into this bubble of everyone agrees with us

01:41.400 --> 01:44.680
and we have avoided having some difficult conversations.

01:44.680 --> 01:46.520
So first of all, your mileage may vary,

01:46.520 --> 01:49.920
these are just suggestions but while enduring family members

01:49.920 --> 01:52.800
that might be smug or don't wanna talk about it

01:52.800 --> 01:55.800
or might be really insensitive to your feelings,

01:55.800 --> 01:57.480
think in the long term.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.520
While it is possible that we might be headed

01:59.520 --> 02:02.160
into a fascist America in World War III,

02:02.160 --> 02:05.320
let's assume that we're not and that the best thing

02:05.320 --> 02:07.540
we can do when we spend time with our families

02:07.540 --> 02:10.360
is getting them to be concerned with the plight

02:10.360 --> 02:14.240
of people who are not them and this is really difficult

02:14.240 --> 02:16.640
and I think whenever you're talking to your family,

02:16.640 --> 02:18.160
you need to keep this at the back of your mind

02:18.160 --> 02:20.760
that humans are naturally just innately

02:20.760 --> 02:24.120
really, really tribal and lately the tribe

02:24.120 --> 02:27.060
has become political as well as racial

02:27.060 --> 02:29.560
and this has been what motivated a lot of voters,

02:29.560 --> 02:32.060
especially Trump voters, they see the world

02:32.060 --> 02:33.920
in terms of us versus them.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.680
So try to think in terms of long term strategies,

02:36.680 --> 02:38.760
both in introducing your families to ideas

02:38.760 --> 02:40.080
that they might not have considered

02:40.080 --> 02:43.520
and also to help preserve your long term relationship.

02:43.520 --> 02:45.680
If you are feeling up to having a dialogue,

02:45.680 --> 02:49.000
come in with an objective and do not come in

02:49.000 --> 02:51.800
to argue or to trap them, you will fail

02:51.800 --> 02:54.240
and you will change no minds or perspectives.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.680
The most important thing to remember

02:55.680 --> 03:00.160
when engaging in any dialogue is you have no influence

03:00.160 --> 03:03.760
over someone for whom you show an underlying contempt

03:03.760 --> 03:05.200
and this applies both ways.

03:05.200 --> 03:06.880
Think of how you feel whenever someone

03:06.880 --> 03:08.400
is dismissive of your opinion.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.960
So remember, if your plan is to change minds

03:10.960 --> 03:14.120
in the long run, you need to leave the contempt at home

03:14.120 --> 03:17.520
and if you can't do that, you're not gonna help anything

03:17.520 --> 03:19.920
and it's probably best just to keep your mouth shut.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.480
Secondly, do not expect immediate results.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.080
These things take time.

03:24.080 --> 03:26.200
Right now, what you need to be focusing on

03:26.200 --> 03:28.680
is instead introducing them to new ideas

03:28.680 --> 03:30.800
and empathizing with how you feel.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.280
Change in perspective absolutely does happen.

03:33.280 --> 03:36.840
Look at support for the Iraq war since 2003.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.280
People do change their minds

03:38.280 --> 03:41.040
but these things do take time, be patient.

03:41.040 --> 03:43.320
This might seem obvious, do not yell.

03:43.320 --> 03:46.000
Third, do not appeal to facts, people don't care.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.720
What you should instead be appealing to

03:47.720 --> 03:49.360
is their sense of empathy.

03:49.400 --> 03:53.400
It does not matter how backed up by empirical study you are

03:53.400 --> 03:55.080
and how backed up they are solely

03:55.080 --> 03:57.160
by whatever Facebook meme they shared.

03:57.160 --> 03:58.760
You insisting how right you are

03:58.760 --> 04:00.160
is not gonna change anyone's mind

04:00.160 --> 04:04.120
so don't focus on trying to persuade people with facts.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.000
They don't care.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.560
Getting people to see outside of their own sphere

04:08.560 --> 04:12.400
is a difficult, painful process

04:12.400 --> 04:14.160
and it is absolutely possible

04:14.160 --> 04:16.600
but again, these things do take time.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.200
Right now, the best you can hope for

04:18.200 --> 04:21.040
is to introduce them to these concepts

04:21.040 --> 04:24.400
like I'm worried about the literal Nazis.

04:28.280 --> 04:30.680
Shaming does not work.

04:30.680 --> 04:34.680
Do not frame any dialogue in terms of look at what you did.

04:34.680 --> 04:38.360
Do not blame people, do not say this is your fault

04:38.360 --> 04:40.640
no matter how much you might be feeling that.

04:40.640 --> 04:43.120
That's not gonna help anything in the long term.

04:43.120 --> 04:46.200
Also, listen, no matter how terrible and loathsome

04:46.200 --> 04:50.840
your relative's ideas might be on say race or gender,

04:50.840 --> 04:52.200
try and listen to them

04:52.200 --> 04:55.560
and try to understand the basis for their concerns.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.040
You can't expect them to listen to you

04:57.040 --> 04:59.200
if you will not afford them the same courtesy.

04:59.200 --> 05:01.640
Again, do not appeal to people's logic.

05:01.640 --> 05:03.960
Frame things rather in empathetic terms.

05:03.960 --> 05:05.280
If this is your family,

05:05.280 --> 05:07.440
they should be able to feel empathy

05:07.440 --> 05:09.320
with you and your concerns.

05:09.320 --> 05:12.640
Try to make your concerns as subjective as you can.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.400
Instead of talking obliquely

05:14.400 --> 05:16.360
about groups you are afraid for

05:16.360 --> 05:18.880
or freedoms you are afraid you might lose,

05:18.880 --> 05:21.000
try to keep things very specific.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.120
For instance, if you had a friend who was harassed

05:24.120 --> 05:27.960
by a white supremacist in the wake of the election,

05:27.960 --> 05:30.960
try to keep your sphere as small as possible

05:30.960 --> 05:32.920
whenever you're expressing your concerns.

05:32.920 --> 05:35.040
That makes them a lot more difficult to dismiss

05:35.040 --> 05:36.760
if you can make them subjective

05:36.760 --> 05:38.960
and about you or people you know.

05:38.960 --> 05:42.520
Do not deny the importance of their perceived issues

05:42.560 --> 05:46.000
unless their issues are literal white supremacy,

05:46.000 --> 05:47.840
in which case they're a lost cause, don't bother.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.560
Try to find some common ground.

05:49.560 --> 05:51.240
Don't play into their narrative

05:51.240 --> 05:53.160
that you are the one who doesn't listen.

05:53.160 --> 05:54.640
If you have a gloater in the family,

05:54.640 --> 05:57.880
someone who is going to come in spoiling for a fight

05:57.880 --> 06:00.560
and so happy about your liberal tears,

06:00.560 --> 06:02.720
do not let them rile you up.

06:02.720 --> 06:06.320
Their empathy is at about a zero right now.

06:06.320 --> 06:07.440
The best you can hope for

06:07.440 --> 06:10.880
is to reignite their sense of empathy.

06:10.880 --> 06:12.240
Again, humans are tribal.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.040
You might be in a different tribe politically,

06:14.040 --> 06:16.920
but you're still in the same tribe familially.

06:16.920 --> 06:17.760
Is that a word?

06:17.760 --> 06:20.080
If this gloater is not a lost cause,

06:20.080 --> 06:23.360
try to appeal to their common human empathy.

06:23.360 --> 06:26.320
Try to get them not to see you as a political rival,

06:26.320 --> 06:29.480
but as a family member who is deeply scared and concerned

06:29.480 --> 06:31.200
for the way the country is going,

06:31.200 --> 06:33.160
for the spike in hate crimes,

06:33.160 --> 06:35.560
for their friends who might be losing their rights

06:35.560 --> 06:38.000
or who might themselves be victims of hate crimes.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.600
Do not be afraid to frame things

06:39.600 --> 06:41.480
in terms of, you're hurting me

06:41.480 --> 06:43.160
when you say things like this.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.960
If they try to rile you up, don't get angry.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.560
Tell them that it hurts you.

06:47.560 --> 06:50.200
They need to see that there is a real human cost

06:50.200 --> 06:52.080
to being so insensitive.

06:52.080 --> 06:54.240
You do not owe it to your family

06:54.240 --> 06:57.720
to hide your concern, your anger, your fear.

06:57.720 --> 07:00.600
You do not owe it to them to make them feel comfortable.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.160
And you don't have to sugarcoat it.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.280
You don't owe it to them right now.

07:04.280 --> 07:06.360
And if you are not yet at a place

07:06.360 --> 07:08.200
where you think you can talk about those issues,

07:08.200 --> 07:10.080
and I know emotions are still really raw

07:10.080 --> 07:12.160
and there are a lot of you who can't,

07:12.160 --> 07:14.400
then you need to be focusing on your self-care

07:14.400 --> 07:17.360
and maybe worry about changing minds later.

07:17.360 --> 07:20.720
First of all, and I'm gonna go ahead and use this term,

07:20.720 --> 07:22.440
make sure you have a safe space

07:22.440 --> 07:24.440
in whatever house you are in

07:24.440 --> 07:27.960
that you can go and hide whenever you feel overwhelmed.

07:27.960 --> 07:30.520
Go out to the woods, go to the bathroom.

07:30.520 --> 07:33.360
Your family can't tell you you can't go to the bathroom

07:33.360 --> 07:35.960
if someone has said something that has upset you

07:35.960 --> 07:37.200
or if a subject has broached

07:37.200 --> 07:38.560
that you do not wanna hear.

07:38.560 --> 07:40.760
Secondly, have a phone a friend.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.040
Coordinate with someone ahead of time

07:42.040 --> 07:43.680
that you can text or call

07:43.680 --> 07:45.040
in case you feel overwhelmed,

07:45.040 --> 07:46.960
someone that you can vent at.

07:46.960 --> 07:49.800
And again, you do not owe it to your family

07:49.800 --> 07:52.240
if they are being shitty to you right now

07:52.240 --> 07:53.960
to make them feel comfortable.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.440
You can protest silently.

07:55.440 --> 07:58.080
You do not have to explain your grievances to them,

07:58.080 --> 07:59.920
but you also do not owe it to them

07:59.920 --> 08:03.280
to make them feel okay with the way things are going.

08:03.280 --> 08:06.240
If they don't respect your feelings, you can cut and run.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.400
If you can't cut and run, you can hide until you can.

08:09.400 --> 08:10.800
It is really scary right now

08:10.800 --> 08:12.960
that we are basically having to protect ourselves

08:12.960 --> 08:14.360
from our own families,

08:14.360 --> 08:16.920
but we also need to be thinking in the long term

08:16.920 --> 08:20.200
to hopefully maybe this will not always be the case.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.840
And part of that is both sides

08:22.840 --> 08:25.400
breaking out of their hermetically sealed bubble

08:25.400 --> 08:27.480
and trying to find some common ground.

08:27.480 --> 08:30.440
Fighting the literal Nazis might be a good one.

08:30.440 --> 08:34.080
Hey mom, I'm really worried about the literal Nazis.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.320
They call themselves that.

08:37.320 --> 08:39.320
Don't call them alt-right, they're Nazis.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.000
And the most important thing to consider

08:41.000 --> 08:44.840
is stress makes time feel expanded.

08:44.840 --> 08:46.960
It's part of the human brain's process

08:46.960 --> 08:50.120
of taking in all of this god-awful new horror

08:50.120 --> 08:51.960
we are exposed to every day.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.280
So do not forget to take care of yourself.

08:54.280 --> 08:57.640
If you feel overwhelmed by all the horrors of the world,

08:57.640 --> 08:58.880
you're not helping anyone

08:58.880 --> 09:00.760
by letting yourself get ground down

09:00.760 --> 09:04.160
until you are basically incapable of doing any action.

09:04.160 --> 09:05.840
Take care of yourself.

09:05.840 --> 09:08.840
This is gonna be a really long slog.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.400
And part of that long slog

09:10.400 --> 09:13.280
is not cutting off half the country,

09:13.280 --> 09:14.680
especially white people.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.280
If you have friends and families who are moderate

09:17.280 --> 09:20.160
or wishy-washy or even on the conservative side

09:20.160 --> 09:21.720
but at least give a shit about you,

09:21.720 --> 09:24.600
try to get them to listen and empathize with your concerns

09:24.600 --> 09:26.400
and also listen to them.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.760
You have no influence over anyone

09:28.800 --> 09:30.920
for whom you show an underlying contempt.

09:30.920 --> 09:32.760
And the same flies both ways.

09:32.760 --> 09:34.160
There is no one solution to this.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.960
And part of the process of the next few years

09:35.960 --> 09:38.280
is going to be strategizing and organizing

09:38.280 --> 09:39.960
and figuring out what to do.

09:39.960 --> 09:42.400
And the most important thing that you need to remember

09:42.400 --> 09:44.880
is that you are not alone.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.800
Even if you are alone within your own family,

09:47.800 --> 09:50.920
we are all terrified.

09:50.920 --> 09:52.760
We in the United States are terrified

09:52.760 --> 09:55.560
and the rest of the world is shitting their pants too.

09:55.560 --> 09:56.600
We're all scared.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.440
This is a really stressful time.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.880
If you are having a difficult time managing your stress,

10:01.880 --> 10:03.000
you're not alone.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.200
And if you need some time to cope, that is okay.

10:06.200 --> 10:07.680
And if now is not the time to talk

10:07.680 --> 10:11.000
to your conservative Trumpy family, that's okay too.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.320
That time can come later.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.960
Right now, you need to take care of yourself first

10:14.960 --> 10:19.840
because we are going to need a lot of strength

10:19.840 --> 10:22.600
in the coming months and years.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.000
Happy Thanksgiving.
