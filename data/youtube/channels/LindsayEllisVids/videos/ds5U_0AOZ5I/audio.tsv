0	5000	God, this year has sucked.
5460	7160	You remember at the beginning of the year
7160	10080	when David Bowie died and we were all joking
10080	13560	how much this year sucked and we had no idea?
13560	14800	No idea.
14800	16680	I know that on this channel I generally keep it
16680	21680	to media related stuff and even then it's mostly theory
22880	26840	and I know we're all kind of doing a little bit
26840	29560	of soul searching right now and right now
29560	33880	I know we're all kind of ranging from stressed
33880	38780	to pants shittingly terrified and this is not made awesome
38780	40720	by the fact that Thanksgiving is coming up
40720	44840	and a lot of people are not looking forward
44840	46880	to spending time with their families.
46880	48520	Fortunately, my family's pretty cool
48520	53040	so this is, of my many worries, this isn't one of them
53040	56200	but in my pants shitting terror,
56200	59000	part of what I've been doing is going to community meetings
59040	62440	and rallies, learning coping strategies
62440	65200	and also organization strategies going forward
65200	68640	and so I wanted to share some of the stuff I have learned
68640	72440	hoping that it might help you not only better deal
72440	75280	with your family but also help begin the process
75280	78680	of healing the divide, politically speaking.
78680	81600	Like these are scary times but with the exception
81600	84200	of the extreme right, you know, the literal Nazis
84200	87560	and the massive assholes, most people I think
87560	89840	are still receptive to change
89840	91640	and I think a lot of us young white people
91640	95240	on the more progressive side have really dropped the ball
95240	97600	in terms of hermetically sealing ourselves
97600	101400	into this bubble of everyone agrees with us
101400	104680	and we have avoided having some difficult conversations.
104680	106520	So first of all, your mileage may vary,
106520	109920	these are just suggestions but while enduring family members
109920	112800	that might be smug or don't wanna talk about it
112800	115800	or might be really insensitive to your feelings,
115800	117480	think in the long term.
117480	119520	While it is possible that we might be headed
119520	122160	into a fascist America in World War III,
122160	125320	let's assume that we're not and that the best thing
125320	127540	we can do when we spend time with our families
127540	130360	is getting them to be concerned with the plight
130360	134240	of people who are not them and this is really difficult
134240	136640	and I think whenever you're talking to your family,
136640	138160	you need to keep this at the back of your mind
138160	140760	that humans are naturally just innately
140760	144120	really, really tribal and lately the tribe
144120	147060	has become political as well as racial
147060	149560	and this has been what motivated a lot of voters,
149560	152060	especially Trump voters, they see the world
152060	153920	in terms of us versus them.
153920	156680	So try to think in terms of long term strategies,
156680	158760	both in introducing your families to ideas
158760	160080	that they might not have considered
160080	163520	and also to help preserve your long term relationship.
163520	165680	If you are feeling up to having a dialogue,
165680	169000	come in with an objective and do not come in
169000	171800	to argue or to trap them, you will fail
171800	174240	and you will change no minds or perspectives.
174240	175680	The most important thing to remember
175680	180160	when engaging in any dialogue is you have no influence
180160	183760	over someone for whom you show an underlying contempt
183760	185200	and this applies both ways.
185200	186880	Think of how you feel whenever someone
186880	188400	is dismissive of your opinion.
188400	190960	So remember, if your plan is to change minds
190960	194120	in the long run, you need to leave the contempt at home
194120	197520	and if you can't do that, you're not gonna help anything
197520	199920	and it's probably best just to keep your mouth shut.
199920	202480	Secondly, do not expect immediate results.
202480	204080	These things take time.
204080	206200	Right now, what you need to be focusing on
206200	208680	is instead introducing them to new ideas
208680	210800	and empathizing with how you feel.
210800	213280	Change in perspective absolutely does happen.
213280	216840	Look at support for the Iraq war since 2003.
216840	218280	People do change their minds
218280	221040	but these things do take time, be patient.
221040	223320	This might seem obvious, do not yell.
223320	226000	Third, do not appeal to facts, people don't care.
226000	227720	What you should instead be appealing to
227720	229360	is their sense of empathy.
229400	233400	It does not matter how backed up by empirical study you are
233400	235080	and how backed up they are solely
235080	237160	by whatever Facebook meme they shared.
237160	238760	You insisting how right you are
238760	240160	is not gonna change anyone's mind
240160	244120	so don't focus on trying to persuade people with facts.
244120	245000	They don't care.
245000	248560	Getting people to see outside of their own sphere
248560	252400	is a difficult, painful process
252400	254160	and it is absolutely possible
254160	256600	but again, these things do take time.
256600	258200	Right now, the best you can hope for
258200	261040	is to introduce them to these concepts
261040	264400	like I'm worried about the literal Nazis.
268280	270680	Shaming does not work.
270680	274680	Do not frame any dialogue in terms of look at what you did.
274680	278360	Do not blame people, do not say this is your fault
278360	280640	no matter how much you might be feeling that.
280640	283120	That's not gonna help anything in the long term.
283120	286200	Also, listen, no matter how terrible and loathsome
286200	290840	your relative's ideas might be on say race or gender,
290840	292200	try and listen to them
292200	295560	and try to understand the basis for their concerns.
295560	297040	You can't expect them to listen to you
297040	299200	if you will not afford them the same courtesy.
299200	301640	Again, do not appeal to people's logic.
301640	303960	Frame things rather in empathetic terms.
303960	305280	If this is your family,
305280	307440	they should be able to feel empathy
307440	309320	with you and your concerns.
309320	312640	Try to make your concerns as subjective as you can.
312640	314400	Instead of talking obliquely
314400	316360	about groups you are afraid for
316360	318880	or freedoms you are afraid you might lose,
318880	321000	try to keep things very specific.
321000	324120	For instance, if you had a friend who was harassed
324120	327960	by a white supremacist in the wake of the election,
327960	330960	try to keep your sphere as small as possible
330960	332920	whenever you're expressing your concerns.
332920	335040	That makes them a lot more difficult to dismiss
335040	336760	if you can make them subjective
336760	338960	and about you or people you know.
338960	342520	Do not deny the importance of their perceived issues
342560	346000	unless their issues are literal white supremacy,
346000	347840	in which case they're a lost cause, don't bother.
347840	349560	Try to find some common ground.
349560	351240	Don't play into their narrative
351240	353160	that you are the one who doesn't listen.
353160	354640	If you have a gloater in the family,
354640	357880	someone who is going to come in spoiling for a fight
357880	360560	and so happy about your liberal tears,
360560	362720	do not let them rile you up.
362720	366320	Their empathy is at about a zero right now.
366320	367440	The best you can hope for
367440	370880	is to reignite their sense of empathy.
370880	372240	Again, humans are tribal.
372920	374040	You might be in a different tribe politically,
374040	376920	but you're still in the same tribe familially.
376920	377760	Is that a word?
377760	380080	If this gloater is not a lost cause,
380080	383360	try to appeal to their common human empathy.
383360	386320	Try to get them not to see you as a political rival,
386320	389480	but as a family member who is deeply scared and concerned
389480	391200	for the way the country is going,
391200	393160	for the spike in hate crimes,
393160	395560	for their friends who might be losing their rights
395560	398000	or who might themselves be victims of hate crimes.
398000	399600	Do not be afraid to frame things
399600	401480	in terms of, you're hurting me
401480	403160	when you say things like this.
403160	405960	If they try to rile you up, don't get angry.
405960	407560	Tell them that it hurts you.
407560	410200	They need to see that there is a real human cost
410200	412080	to being so insensitive.
412080	414240	You do not owe it to your family
414240	417720	to hide your concern, your anger, your fear.
417720	420600	You do not owe it to them to make them feel comfortable.
420600	422160	And you don't have to sugarcoat it.
422160	424280	You don't owe it to them right now.
424280	426360	And if you are not yet at a place
426360	428200	where you think you can talk about those issues,
428200	430080	and I know emotions are still really raw
430080	432160	and there are a lot of you who can't,
432160	434400	then you need to be focusing on your self-care
434400	437360	and maybe worry about changing minds later.
437360	440720	First of all, and I'm gonna go ahead and use this term,
440720	442440	make sure you have a safe space
442440	444440	in whatever house you are in
444440	447960	that you can go and hide whenever you feel overwhelmed.
447960	450520	Go out to the woods, go to the bathroom.
450520	453360	Your family can't tell you you can't go to the bathroom
453360	455960	if someone has said something that has upset you
455960	457200	or if a subject has broached
457200	458560	that you do not wanna hear.
458560	460760	Secondly, have a phone a friend.
460760	462040	Coordinate with someone ahead of time
462040	463680	that you can text or call
463680	465040	in case you feel overwhelmed,
465040	466960	someone that you can vent at.
466960	469800	And again, you do not owe it to your family
469800	472240	if they are being shitty to you right now
472240	473960	to make them feel comfortable.
473960	475440	You can protest silently.
475440	478080	You do not have to explain your grievances to them,
478080	479920	but you also do not owe it to them
479920	483280	to make them feel okay with the way things are going.
483280	486240	If they don't respect your feelings, you can cut and run.
486240	489400	If you can't cut and run, you can hide until you can.
489400	490800	It is really scary right now
490800	492960	that we are basically having to protect ourselves
492960	494360	from our own families,
494360	496920	but we also need to be thinking in the long term
496920	500200	to hopefully maybe this will not always be the case.
500200	502840	And part of that is both sides
502840	505400	breaking out of their hermetically sealed bubble
505400	507480	and trying to find some common ground.
507480	510440	Fighting the literal Nazis might be a good one.
510440	514080	Hey mom, I'm really worried about the literal Nazis.
515000	517320	They call themselves that.
517320	519320	Don't call them alt-right, they're Nazis.
519320	521000	And the most important thing to consider
521000	524840	is stress makes time feel expanded.
524840	526960	It's part of the human brain's process
526960	530120	of taking in all of this god-awful new horror
530120	531960	we are exposed to every day.
531960	534280	So do not forget to take care of yourself.
534280	537640	If you feel overwhelmed by all the horrors of the world,
537640	538880	you're not helping anyone
538880	540760	by letting yourself get ground down
540760	544160	until you are basically incapable of doing any action.
544160	545840	Take care of yourself.
545840	548840	This is gonna be a really long slog.
548840	550400	And part of that long slog
550400	553280	is not cutting off half the country,
553280	554680	especially white people.
554680	557280	If you have friends and families who are moderate
557280	560160	or wishy-washy or even on the conservative side
560160	561720	but at least give a shit about you,
561720	564600	try to get them to listen and empathize with your concerns
564600	566400	and also listen to them.
566400	568760	You have no influence over anyone
568800	570920	for whom you show an underlying contempt.
570920	572760	And the same flies both ways.
572760	574160	There is no one solution to this.
574160	575960	And part of the process of the next few years
575960	578280	is going to be strategizing and organizing
578280	579960	and figuring out what to do.
579960	582400	And the most important thing that you need to remember
582400	584880	is that you are not alone.
584880	587800	Even if you are alone within your own family,
587800	590920	we are all terrified.
590920	592760	We in the United States are terrified
592760	595560	and the rest of the world is shitting their pants too.
595560	596600	We're all scared.
596600	598440	This is a really stressful time.
599120	601880	If you are having a difficult time managing your stress,
601880	603000	you're not alone.
603000	606200	And if you need some time to cope, that is okay.
606200	607680	And if now is not the time to talk
607680	611000	to your conservative Trumpy family, that's okay too.
611000	612320	That time can come later.
612320	614960	Right now, you need to take care of yourself first
614960	619840	because we are going to need a lot of strength
619840	622600	in the coming months and years.
623800	625000	Happy Thanksgiving.
