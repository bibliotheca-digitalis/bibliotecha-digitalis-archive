1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
God, this year has sucked.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,160
You remember at the beginning of the year

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,080
when David Bowie died and we were all joking

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,560
how much this year sucked and we had no idea?

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,800
No idea.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,680
I know that on this channel I generally keep it

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,680
to media related stuff and even then it's mostly theory

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,840
and I know we're all kind of doing a little bit

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,560
of soul searching right now and right now

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,880
I know we're all kind of ranging from stressed

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,780
to pants shittingly terrified and this is not made awesome

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,720
by the fact that Thanksgiving is coming up

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,840
and a lot of people are not looking forward

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,880
to spending time with their families.

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,520
Fortunately, my family's pretty cool

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,040
so this is, of my many worries, this isn't one of them

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,200
but in my pants shitting terror,

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,000
part of what I've been doing is going to community meetings

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,440
and rallies, learning coping strategies

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,200
and also organization strategies going forward

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,640
and so I wanted to share some of the stuff I have learned

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,440
hoping that it might help you not only better deal

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,280
with your family but also help begin the process

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,680
of healing the divide, politically speaking.

25
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,600
Like these are scary times but with the exception

26
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,200
of the extreme right, you know, the literal Nazis

27
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,560
and the massive assholes, most people I think

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,840
are still receptive to change

29
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,640
and I think a lot of us young white people

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,240
on the more progressive side have really dropped the ball

31
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,600
in terms of hermetically sealing ourselves

32
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,400
into this bubble of everyone agrees with us

33
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,680
and we have avoided having some difficult conversations.

34
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,520
So first of all, your mileage may vary,

35
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,920
these are just suggestions but while enduring family members

36
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,800
that might be smug or don't wanna talk about it

37
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,800
or might be really insensitive to your feelings,

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,480
think in the long term.

39
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,520
While it is possible that we might be headed

40
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,160
into a fascist America in World War III,

41
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,320
let's assume that we're not and that the best thing

42
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,540
we can do when we spend time with our families

43
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,360
is getting them to be concerned with the plight

44
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,240
of people who are not them and this is really difficult

45
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,640
and I think whenever you're talking to your family,

46
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,160
you need to keep this at the back of your mind

47
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,760
that humans are naturally just innately

48
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,120
really, really tribal and lately the tribe

49
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,060
has become political as well as racial

50
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,560
and this has been what motivated a lot of voters,

51
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,060
especially Trump voters, they see the world

52
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,920
in terms of us versus them.

53
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,680
So try to think in terms of long term strategies,

54
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,760
both in introducing your families to ideas

55
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,080
that they might not have considered

56
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,520
and also to help preserve your long term relationship.

57
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,680
If you are feeling up to having a dialogue,

58
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,000
come in with an objective and do not come in

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,800
to argue or to trap them, you will fail

60
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,240
and you will change no minds or perspectives.

61
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,680
The most important thing to remember

62
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,160
when engaging in any dialogue is you have no influence

63
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,760
over someone for whom you show an underlying contempt

64
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,200
and this applies both ways.

65
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,880
Think of how you feel whenever someone

66
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,400
is dismissive of your opinion.

67
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,960
So remember, if your plan is to change minds

68
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,120
in the long run, you need to leave the contempt at home

69
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,520
and if you can't do that, you're not gonna help anything

70
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,920
and it's probably best just to keep your mouth shut.

71
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,480
Secondly, do not expect immediate results.

72
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,080
These things take time.

73
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,200
Right now, what you need to be focusing on

74
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,680
is instead introducing them to new ideas

75
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,800
and empathizing with how you feel.

76
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,280
Change in perspective absolutely does happen.

77
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,840
Look at support for the Iraq war since 2003.

78
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,280
People do change their minds

79
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,040
but these things do take time, be patient.

80
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,320
This might seem obvious, do not yell.

81
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,000
Third, do not appeal to facts, people don't care.

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,720
What you should instead be appealing to

83
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,360
is their sense of empathy.

84
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,400
It does not matter how backed up by empirical study you are

85
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,080
and how backed up they are solely

86
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,160
by whatever Facebook meme they shared.

87
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,760
You insisting how right you are

88
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,160
is not gonna change anyone's mind

89
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,120
so don't focus on trying to persuade people with facts.

90
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,000
They don't care.

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,560
Getting people to see outside of their own sphere

92
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,400
is a difficult, painful process

93
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,160
and it is absolutely possible

94
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,600
but again, these things do take time.

95
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,200
Right now, the best you can hope for

96
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,040
is to introduce them to these concepts

97
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,400
like I'm worried about the literal Nazis.

98
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,680
Shaming does not work.

99
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Do not frame any dialogue in terms of look at what you did.

100
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,360
Do not blame people, do not say this is your fault

101
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,640
no matter how much you might be feeling that.

102
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,120
That's not gonna help anything in the long term.

103
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,200
Also, listen, no matter how terrible and loathsome

104
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,840
your relative's ideas might be on say race or gender,

105
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,200
try and listen to them

106
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,560
and try to understand the basis for their concerns.

107
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,040
You can't expect them to listen to you

108
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,200
if you will not afford them the same courtesy.

109
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,640
Again, do not appeal to people's logic.

110
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,960
Frame things rather in empathetic terms.

111
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,280
If this is your family,

112
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,440
they should be able to feel empathy

113
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,320
with you and your concerns.

114
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,640
Try to make your concerns as subjective as you can.

115
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,400
Instead of talking obliquely

116
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,360
about groups you are afraid for

117
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,880
or freedoms you are afraid you might lose,

118
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,000
try to keep things very specific.

119
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,120
For instance, if you had a friend who was harassed

120
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,960
by a white supremacist in the wake of the election,

121
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,960
try to keep your sphere as small as possible

122
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,920
whenever you're expressing your concerns.

123
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,040
That makes them a lot more difficult to dismiss

124
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,760
if you can make them subjective

125
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,960
and about you or people you know.

126
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,520
Do not deny the importance of their perceived issues

127
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,000
unless their issues are literal white supremacy,

128
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,840
in which case they're a lost cause, don't bother.

129
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,560
Try to find some common ground.

130
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,240
Don't play into their narrative

131
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,160
that you are the one who doesn't listen.

132
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,640
If you have a gloater in the family,

133
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,880
someone who is going to come in spoiling for a fight

134
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,560
and so happy about your liberal tears,

135
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,720
do not let them rile you up.

136
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,320
Their empathy is at about a zero right now.

137
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,440
The best you can hope for

138
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,880
is to reignite their sense of empathy.

139
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,240
Again, humans are tribal.

140
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,040
You might be in a different tribe politically,

141
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,920
but you're still in the same tribe familially.

142
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,760
Is that a word?

143
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,080
If this gloater is not a lost cause,

144
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,360
try to appeal to their common human empathy.

145
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,320
Try to get them not to see you as a political rival,

146
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,480
but as a family member who is deeply scared and concerned

147
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,200
for the way the country is going,

148
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,160
for the spike in hate crimes,

149
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,560
for their friends who might be losing their rights

150
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,000
or who might themselves be victims of hate crimes.

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,600
Do not be afraid to frame things

152
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,480
in terms of, you're hurting me

153
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,160
when you say things like this.

154
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,960
If they try to rile you up, don't get angry.

155
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,560
Tell them that it hurts you.

156
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,200
They need to see that there is a real human cost

157
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,080
to being so insensitive.

158
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,240
You do not owe it to your family

159
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,720
to hide your concern, your anger, your fear.

160
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,600
You do not owe it to them to make them feel comfortable.

161
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,160
And you don't have to sugarcoat it.

162
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,280
You don't owe it to them right now.

163
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,360
And if you are not yet at a place

164
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,200
where you think you can talk about those issues,

165
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,080
and I know emotions are still really raw

166
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,160
and there are a lot of you who can't,

167
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,400
then you need to be focusing on your self-care

168
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,360
and maybe worry about changing minds later.

169
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,720
First of all, and I'm gonna go ahead and use this term,

170
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,440
make sure you have a safe space

171
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,440
in whatever house you are in

172
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,960
that you can go and hide whenever you feel overwhelmed.

173
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,520
Go out to the woods, go to the bathroom.

174
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,360
Your family can't tell you you can't go to the bathroom

175
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,960
if someone has said something that has upset you

176
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,200
or if a subject has broached

177
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,560
that you do not wanna hear.

178
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,760
Secondly, have a phone a friend.

179
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,040
Coordinate with someone ahead of time

180
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,680
that you can text or call

181
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,040
in case you feel overwhelmed,

182
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,960
someone that you can vent at.

183
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,800
And again, you do not owe it to your family

184
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,240
if they are being shitty to you right now

185
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,960
to make them feel comfortable.

186
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,440
You can protest silently.

187
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,080
You do not have to explain your grievances to them,

188
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,920
but you also do not owe it to them

189
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,280
to make them feel okay with the way things are going.

190
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,240
If they don't respect your feelings, you can cut and run.

191
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,400
If you can't cut and run, you can hide until you can.

192
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,800
It is really scary right now

193
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,960
that we are basically having to protect ourselves

194
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,360
from our own families,

195
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,920
but we also need to be thinking in the long term

196
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,200
to hopefully maybe this will not always be the case.

197
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,840
And part of that is both sides

198
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,400
breaking out of their hermetically sealed bubble

199
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,480
and trying to find some common ground.

200
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,440
Fighting the literal Nazis might be a good one.

201
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,080
Hey mom, I'm really worried about the literal Nazis.

202
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,320
They call themselves that.

203
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,320
Don't call them alt-right, they're Nazis.

204
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,000
And the most important thing to consider

205
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,840
is stress makes time feel expanded.

206
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,960
It's part of the human brain's process

207
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,120
of taking in all of this god-awful new horror

208
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,960
we are exposed to every day.

209
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,280
So do not forget to take care of yourself.

210
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,640
If you feel overwhelmed by all the horrors of the world,

211
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,880
you're not helping anyone

212
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,760
by letting yourself get ground down

213
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,160
until you are basically incapable of doing any action.

214
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,840
Take care of yourself.

215
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,840
This is gonna be a really long slog.

216
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,400
And part of that long slog

217
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,280
is not cutting off half the country,

218
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,680
especially white people.

219
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,280
If you have friends and families who are moderate

220
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,160
or wishy-washy or even on the conservative side

221
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,720
but at least give a shit about you,

222
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,600
try to get them to listen and empathize with your concerns

223
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,400
and also listen to them.

224
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,760
You have no influence over anyone

225
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,920
for whom you show an underlying contempt.

226
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,760
And the same flies both ways.

227
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,160
There is no one solution to this.

228
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,960
And part of the process of the next few years

229
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,280
is going to be strategizing and organizing

230
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,960
and figuring out what to do.

231
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,400
And the most important thing that you need to remember

232
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,880
is that you are not alone.

233
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,800
Even if you are alone within your own family,

234
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,920
we are all terrified.

235
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,760
We in the United States are terrified

236
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,560
and the rest of the world is shitting their pants too.

237
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,600
We're all scared.

238
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,440
This is a really stressful time.

239
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,880
If you are having a difficult time managing your stress,

240
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,000
you're not alone.

241
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,200
And if you need some time to cope, that is okay.

242
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,680
And if now is not the time to talk

243
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,000
to your conservative Trumpy family, that's okay too.

244
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,320
That time can come later.

245
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,960
Right now, you need to take care of yourself first

246
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,840
because we are going to need a lot of strength

247
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,600
in the coming months and years.

248
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,000
Happy Thanksgiving.
