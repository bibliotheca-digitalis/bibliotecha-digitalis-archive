0	5600	So, here's a question. When did animated movies start selling themselves on their bankable
5600	6600	celebrity talent?
6600	7600	Jim Carrey.
7600	9320	There are people on this spectrum.
9320	10320	Jerry Seinfeld.
10320	11320	Renee Zellweger.
11320	12320	Just show those sharks who's boss.
12320	13320	Here I come. Ta-da!
13320	14320	I tell you what's what.
14320	15320	And what?
15320	16320	Steve Carell.
16320	17320	Dr. LaRue?
17320	25360	Because it wasn't always like this. For most of the life of feature film animation, it
25360	29980	was more analogous to how anime dubs are done in America today. Career voice talent and
29980	34060	non-celebrities and character actors provided the voices and animated features were sold
34060	37740	on pretty much every facet but their celebrity voice talent.
37740	38740	And then came
38740	39740	SOMEBODY
39740	45660	and in a post-Shrek celebrity-driven animated feature world, well, it's not all there
45660	49260	is, but in terms of sheer volume, it's most of it.
49260	53580	Horrible turn of events. Horrible.
53580	57980	But you know where this is going. Shrek might have codified the thing, but it did not kick
57980	61380	off the thing. That dubious honor goes to…
61380	62380	ALADDIN!
62380	66300	Hello Aladdin, nice to have you on the show. Can we call you Al? Or maybe just Din?
66300	70180	But here's the thing. The big celebrity on whose back Aladdin was marketed did not
70180	75340	want this to happen. This current hellscape of James Corden playing Peter Rabbit and Patrick
75340	77540	Stewart as the poop emoji?
77540	78540	Just doing my duty.
78540	82940	This is a hellish Mirror House version of what went down with Williams' experience
82940	87260	with Disney. Williams did not want to be the celebrity off of which Aladdin was marketed.
87540	89580	It's all part and parcel, the whole genie gig.
89580	93700	His name being used to market the movie and its tie-in merchandise at all created a massive
93700	98300	rift between himself and the Walt Disney Company that lasted for years. All because Disney
98300	102900	just couldn't resist ignoring this man's request not to be used as a marketing tool
102900	103900	for Aladdin.
103900	104900	I am your master now.
104900	106980	I wasn't afraid of that.
106980	109420	This is the story.
109420	115260	Now I'm the king of the swingers, oh.
115260	118620	With the Disney renaissance of the 1990s and the prestige value that came with being
118620	122340	in one of its movies, animated films were rarely the playground of A-list actors and
122340	127300	more the territory of relatively unknown character actors and voice actors, with the occasional
127300	130300	B-lister and C-lister thrown in.
130300	134580	For instance, Ralph Bakshi's Lord of the Rings had… John Hurt.
134580	137420	Well, you have put your foot in it this time.
137420	138920	Who are you?
138920	142020	The Rescuers snagged Bob Newhart and Ava Gabor.
142340	145460	Oh Bernard, adventure.
145460	148380	Gotta rope in that Green Acres crowd.
148380	151940	I get allergic smelling hay.
151940	155180	The Fox and the Hound had… Kurt Russell?
155180	156180	The same year as-
156180	158620	I don't give a fuck about your war.
158620	160500	We're your president.
160500	161500	Okay.
161500	165060	Point being that voice casting for animated films was less of a star-studded affair and
165060	168860	more of a people-you-might-see-on-nick-at-night sort of deal.
169180	172900	I don't have to ask you what business you're in.
172900	177220	Then comes 1986's The Great Mouse Detective, which was the first animated feature where
177220	181260	Eisner and Katzenberg oversaw most of the production and the distribution, and while
181260	185220	Mouse Detective had Vincent Price as the world's most extra-bitter ex-boyfriend-
185220	188780	Trouble with the chemistry set, old boy.
188780	191500	It wasn't what one would call a star vehicle.
191500	195140	It did, however, turn enough of a profit to convince its new studio heads that there was
195140	197940	still money to be made from Disney's animation division.
198020	202380	Enter Oliver and Company, whose cast not only had way more considerable star power, but
202380	206580	whose marketing also heavily relied on pushing said cast as a feature of the film.
206580	210580	That's Midler, Huey Lewis, and Billy Joel.
210580	213580	Why should I worry?
213580	216580	Why should I care?
216580	220700	Oliver and Company's $31 million budget was double that of Mouse Detective, presumably
220700	224980	because of that voice cast, but it also earned twice what Great Mouse Detective did.
225020	229620	The big takeaway here for Eisner and Katzenberg, star power gets attention, especially from
229620	234620	adult moviegoers.
234620	238140	Howard Ashman, one of the lyricists on Oliver and Rising Star in the Stage World with Little
238140	242740	Shop of Horrors, is hired to work on Disney's next two movies, The Little Mermaid and Beauty
242740	243980	and the Beast.
243980	248260	And while these films are obviously financial and critical successes for Disney, a lot of
248260	252700	their charm comes from being much more traditional book musicals that are appropriately cast
252700	254300	with stage actors.
254300	257700	The biggest star in Little Mermaid is, I guess, Buddy Hackett?
257700	263300	It's a dinglehopper, a penile implant, which means a stick in your dick.
263300	268700	And Beauty and the Beast's big Broadway gets are Angela Lansbury and Jerry Orbach.
268700	272300	He's not whole without a soul to wait upon.
272300	277060	Can't believe they got Mrs. Lovett and Baby's Dad from Dirty Dancing.
277060	279060	But then came Aladdin.
279060	284060	Ten thousand years will give you such a crick in the neck.
284060	285060	Damn.
285060	288060	A little sip of Perrier here.
288060	291180	I had to stop drinking alcohol because I used to wake up nude and go to my car with my keys
291180	292180	in my ass.
292180	297700	Robin Williams became famous through his stand-up career, particularly as an improv comedian
297700	300340	and his starring role in televisions Mork and Mindy.
300340	305580	Fly, be free!
305580	308700	But he initially struggled to translate that success into film.
308700	313820	His first major starring role, Robert Altman's 1980 flop Popeye, which was partially produced
313820	327700	by the Walt Disney Company, was a disaster, which led to a film career slump that lasted
327700	329420	throughout the early 80s for Williams.
329420	333540	But right around the time of the Eisner ascendancy at Disney came two opportunities for Robin
333540	342980	Williams, produced under the Disney umbrella, his darling passion project Good Morning Vietnam
342980	347540	and The Dead Poets Society, both of which garnered him Oscar nominations.
347540	352320	And then came Hook a couple years later, which finally cemented Robin Williams as an A-list
352320	353500	bankable star.
353500	356860	But none of these films are so relevant to the story of Aladdin as a charming little
356860	370900	polemic by the name of…
370900	374340	While it seems on paper that this should be the cheap knock-off that was capitalizing
374340	378440	on Williams' popularity as the genie, Fern Gully was actually a labor of love that had
378440	381460	been in development for years before Aladdin.
381460	384780	But it only really got off the ground after Robin Williams was cast in the role of pop
384780	397380	culture-referencing, bigoted-against-humans, rapping PTSD bat, Batty Kota.
397380	400700	And believe it or not, Williams was signed on for Fern Gully before he had even been
400700	402340	approached for Aladdin.
402340	405700	Fern Gully's screenwriter, Jim Cox, who had coincidentally worked on the first two
405700	409080	screen treatments of Beauty and the Beast, had seen Williams performing at open mics
409080	413780	in LA comedy clubs between his two Oscar nods, and wrote the role of Batty specifically around
413780	415340	Williams' frenetic energy.
415340	419080	Williams agreed to do it, according to Young, because he felt strongly about the actionable
419080	429020	green message.
429020	433300	So while Fern Gully is going into production, by pure happenstance we have a nearly mirror
433300	436460	situation over at Disney with the film Aladdin.
436460	439700	Williams' involvement did not originate with the studio cynically wanting an A-list
440700	445620	adult audiences, Williams had a very cartoony persona, and he was inspiring to more than
445620	463500	one animation studio at the same time.
463500	467100	Not only was the part written for him, but they had pitched Aladdin as a Robin Williams
467100	470140	vehicle before the actor had even been approached.
470140	471140	Said Musker,
471140	473300	Yeah, we wrote this part with Robin in mind.
473300	474660	We didn't know if he would do it.
474660	476500	We were totally walking down the plank.
476500	480620	If he said no, we were gonna be in big trouble because the whole concept for Aladdin was
480620	484700	built around Robin.
484700	488300	Williams was hesitant, but was convinced to sign on when Musker and Clements had supervising
488300	492140	animator Eric Goldberg create a sample reel of the genie set to one of Williams' old
492620	499820	stand-up routines.
499820	504060	Williams is said to have laughed his ass off, and then signed up immediately.
504060	514540	According to Goldberg,
514540	518460	And so, a deal was struck between Disney and Williams, who agreed to do the voice of the
518460	526300	genie at SAG pay scale, about $70,000, with the following caveat.
526300	531480	He specifically requested that Disney use his name in 25% or less of the promotional
531480	533380	and marketing material for the movie.
533380	536240	Part of the reason behind this was because Williams was worried that this would cannibalize
536240	540780	the audience for his upcoming film and passion project, Toys, set to be released a few months
540780	545340	after Aladdin, which arguably is what happened.
545340	548180	But more important for Williams was something of an ethical bent.
548180	552220	He also did not want his voice being used to sell merchandise.
552220	553220	Said Williams,
553220	556260	I love animation, and Disney is the Rolls-Royce of animation.
556260	559260	But I told them, don't use my voice to sell merchandise.
559260	560460	And they agreed to that.
560460	563980	When Disney went ahead and used his voice in the marketing, Williams said, he felt,
563980	567060	it was a violation of trust.
567060	571060	Williams said, don't merchandise my character.
571060	573260	To Disney.
574260	578740	Initially, Disney stuck to their agreement, albeit in a roundabout way.
578740	583900	Here's the initial teaser poster, and there's no mention of Williams or the genie in sight,
583900	586620	just this classy backlit lamp.
586620	593100	But Disney quickly found a, ahem, clever interpretation of this 25% of the marketing caveat that really
593100	598700	pushed its limits while still being technically, eh, within reason.
598700	601060	But that was nothing of a broach and agreement compared to
601060	620180	We can only surmise why Disney went back on its promise with Williams, but suffice
620180	626100	to say that it probably had a lot to do with the fact that he did not back out of being
626100	627100	in Fern Gully.
628100	631900	I know I am, I know I am.
631900	635980	Studio president Jeffrey Katzenberg, petty asshole, legit thought Williams would drop
635980	639300	out of Fern Gully to be in the bigger, more prestigious Aladdin.
639300	643500	So Katzenberg, petty asshole, actively sabotaged Fern Gully.
643500	645380	Said Fern Gully writer Diana Young,
645380	648700	Twice we rented facilities and they gazumped us by paying more.
648700	651860	When we found space in the brewery, Disney tried to buy it.
651860	655800	One day Katzenberg, and eight or so others, marched through to inspect the premises.
655800	659840	We scrambled to cover everything up, but it was also really about Robin.
659840	665240	According to Jim Cox, Fern Gully's screenwriter, Robin was steaming, like, it's my voice,
665240	666480	you can't stop me.
666480	671000	It also didn't help that Williams' own response to Katzenberg's ire was like, fuck
671000	679000	you, Fern Gully signed me first, I'm rapping the baddie rap.
679000	683280	So Disney's like, well fuck you right back, we are going to renege on our promise.
683320	687520	And thus began the now infamous feud between Williams and the Walt Disney Company, in which
687520	691440	Williams was more than happy to start shitting publicly on Disney while they continued to
691440	693000	use the genie to make money.
693000	696960	Moreover, the moral implications of what his work was being used for irked him.
696960	700520	The one thing I said was I will do the voice, I'm doing it basically because I want to
700520	704160	be part of this animation tradition, I want something for my children.
704160	707040	One deal is, I just don't want to sell anything.
707040	709880	As in Burger King, as in toys, as in stuff.
709880	713680	Not only did they use my voice, they took a character I did and overdubbed it to sell
713680	714680	stuff.
714680	717040	That was the one thing I said, I don't do that.
717040	718840	That was the one thing where they crossed the line.
718840	723080	A Disney spokesperson lobbed back that they had played completely fair game with Williams,
723080	727440	and that they had reputably ran every piece of marketing material across him and his then-wife,
727440	728440	Martha Marsha.
728440	732220	Said the spokesperson, we did not use his voice in any way that he did not contractually
732220	733220	agree to.
733220	736400	He agreed to the deal, and then he made the movie, and then when the movie turned out
736400	739680	to be a big hit, he didn't like the deal he had made.
739680	740960	After all, you've lied to everyone else.
740960	742560	Hey, I was beginning to feel left out.
742560	746200	The bridge had been burned, that when even the Golden Globes gave Williams a special
746200	751400	award for playing the genie, he gave a three-minute acceptance speech where he mostly faffed around
751400	756080	and mentioned the Disney company not one time, although he did throw some shade at the petty
756080	757080	asshole.
757080	760920	I'd like to thank Jeffrey Katzenberg.
760920	766960	Eisner attempted to mend bridges with Williams by sending him a Picasso painting, but Williams,
767040	769840	asserting some big dick energy, remained unmoved.
776160	779640	So of course, the real dramatic irony here is not that Williams' involvement in Aladdin
779640	783920	started the trend of celebrity voice acting as a marketing strategy, which it totally
783920	788360	did, but that the fallout was the last thing the man would have wanted.
788360	793520	However, for better or worse, lessons were learned from the success of Aladdin.
793520	795840	Cynical, cheap lessons.
797120	801960	We saw it begin to some degree with The Lion King, and then more with Pocahontas.
801960	805040	Mel Gibson was one of the biggest stars in the world at the time.
805040	808800	But then after that, starting with the ones that were seriously in production after Aladdin
808800	813960	was released, every Disney movie had a genie knockoff featuring some extremely bankable
813960	814960	comedic talent.
814960	819960	Okay everybody, move aside, out of my way, best friend coming through.
819960	824560	Remember like a few years ago, every other boy was named Jason and the girls were all
824560	825560	named Brittany?
826560	832560	But of course, the most shameless, egregious example comes from
834560	837960	But these examples are just from the Disney side of things.
837960	841640	Let us not forget all of the other haters and losers out in the non-Disney animation
841640	844200	world who were quick to jump on the same formula.
844200	851160	Don Bluth saw not a lot of success in the 90s until Anastasia, which is not only a bald-faced,
851160	856080	shameless rip-off of the Disney story formula, but also in how much it crammed in its miscast
856080	860360	A and B-listers and marketed the shit out of it.
860360	865160	Meg Ryan is hideously miscast as a plucky 18-year-old amnesiac.
865160	866160	What?
866160	867160	What?
867160	868160	Are you circling me?
868160	869160	What were you, a vulture in another life?
869160	871160	Hank Azaria is our genie, I guess.
871160	873160	Yeah, ain't that a kick in the head?
873160	875160	I guess a curse just ain't what it used to be, huh, sir?
875160	876160	And Christopher Lloyd.
876160	880160	I have no feelings whatsoever.
880160	883160	Ooh, yeah, that'll be a yikes for me, dawg.
883160	887160	But the apogee of this trend of capturing adult interest in children's entertainment
887160	891160	by way of celebrity voice talent comes to us at the hands of...
891160	892160	SOMEBODY.
892160	897160	Jeffrey Katzenberg, petty asshole, finds his biggest post-Disney successes by sniping Disney
897160	902160	ideas and being, well, an extremely petty asshole, with his first shameless rip-off
902160	908160	of a Disney project, ANTS, featuring uncanny valley nightmare versions of Woody Allen,
908160	911160	Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone.
911160	917160	Wow, those are some hot tickets in 1998, but mom and dad sure do know who they are.
917160	922160	Call me crazy, but I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.
922160	927160	Not only was it rumored that Katzenberg had decided to lift inspiration from the Pixar
927160	933160	project then titled Bugs, but also that he browbeat the animation team at PDI to do everything
933160	936160	they could to make sure it hit theaters before A Bug's Life did.
936160	937160	Petty asshole.
940160	945160	Right after that we had The Prince of Egypt, aka pulling a favor from every famous person
945160	946160	in Hollywood.
946160	949160	Wow, Hal Kilmer is just... he really loves playing Moses.
949160	953160	How can this be? How can this be?
953160	954160	And then...
954160	955160	SOMEBODY.
955160	960160	Yeah, I get that you love Shrek, but it is an extremely petty asshole movie.
960160	962160	From its cheap, shallow digs at Disney...
962160	965160	Too long is a perfect place.
966160	971160	...to its totally-not-Michael-Eisner-inspired villain to its shameless pop culture references...
977160	982160	...to a celebrity-driven marketing campaign that makes Aladdin look downright subtle.
982160	985160	And joining DreamWorks were the knockoffs, which haunt us to this day.
996160	997160	Woof.
997160	1000160	Of course there's Illumination Animation...
1007160	1012160	...and even further down the totem pole, Sony Pictures Animation, with even cheaper, shittier
1012160	1013160	movies.
1013160	1015160	Most of the time, yeah, they have the one exception.
1015160	1016160	Like, incredibly cheap.
1016160	1019160	Probably more than half the budget goes to the voice actors.
1019160	1021160	Like, what the hell is this stu-
1026160	1034160	What? How did that get Oprah?
1034160	1038160	By the time Lilo and Stitch rolled around, there seemed to be a return to form in which
1038160	1042160	Disney was casting based on roles, as opposed to writing roles for a celebrity.
1042160	1046160	And ever since Disney's animation studio got back on track, let's say starting with
1046160	1050160	Tangled, the company's more or less fallen back into the spirit it originally started
1050160	1051160	from.
1051160	1054160	Both Disney's animation studio and Pixar produce roughly one film a year, and while
1054160	1057160	they don't necessarily want for lack of well-known talent...
1060160	1063160	...casting is less of a gimmick to get asses in seats, and more of a creative choice that
1063160	1067160	plays to the strength of the character and the actor inhabiting the role, whether they're
1067160	1069160	super famous or not.
1069160	1071160	And may I add, I love your dress, it's adorable.
1071160	1073160	Oh, this old thing? Thank you so much. I love the way it twirls.
1073160	1074160	Oh, thank you, Joy. Thank you, Joy.
1074160	1079160	But hey, Disney now totally owns Blue Sky Animation after the 20th Century Fox merger.
1079160	1086160	So they own shit, like, epic now, with its Aziz Ansari slug.
1086160	1090160	Boom! Right here. Biggest in the merch.
1090160	1093160	Hey, if you can't beat him, buy him.
1093160	1096160	But hey, I think we're forgetting the most important question.
1096160	1099160	What about Return of Jafar?
1100160	1102160	Ooh, she dances.
1102160	1107160	Was the big feud the reason Williams was not in beloved direct-to-video classic, The Return
1107160	1109160	of Jafar? Yeah, it was. Pretty much.
1109160	1112160	You saw the whole world already?
1112160	1115160	It's a small world after all.
1115160	1120160	Williams declined to reprise the role of the genie in the not-good-and-quite-bad direct-to-video
1120160	1125160	sequel, itself the spark for another long, sad trend that would last more than a decade
1125160	1127160	and we're not going to get into right now.
1127160	1132160	This is no angel. It's the shadow of a monster.
1132160	1137160	Not because he thought a sequel was necessarily beneath him, but because he was still furious
1137160	1139160	about the way that Disney handled Aladdin.
1139160	1143160	So Disney went ahead and made it and replaced Robin Williams with Homer Simpson.
1143160	1147160	He's big! He's blue! He's back!
1147160	1151160	That was probably also the reason why they didn't bother giving that movie a budget
1151160	1154160	or making it look like not-ass.
1154160	1159160	Steal from us again and your squirmy body will be dinner for the jackal!
1159160	1165160	But in the end, the feud was mended not by money or Picassos, but by sincerity, or at least
1165160	1168160	the public performance of sincerity.
1168160	1170160	And of course by firing the petty asshole.
1170160	1174160	Joe Roth, Jeffrey Katzenberg's successor as studio chief, issued a public heartfelt
1174160	1176160	apology on the debacle, saying,
1190160	1192160	They are simply about principle.
1192160	1196160	And with peace reinstated, Williams went on to voice the Genie in other projects.
1196160	1201160	Oh come on, enough of this dark past. Let's roll out something a little new.
1201160	1204160	Including the slightly less shitty threequel.
1204160	1206160	And boy, did Disney want you to know that he was back.
1206160	1208160	I'm back!
1208160	1212160	Including the Genie, brought to life again by the one and only Robin Williams.
1212160	1215160	It's a kinder, gentler Genie. Look at it!
1216160	1220160	I mean, of course they did. Williams was decidedly not paid scale this time around,
1220160	1223160	netting a cool one million for reprising his role.
1223160	1227160	After that, Williams did reprise the role of the Genie a smattering of times,
1227160	1229160	but only in educational content.
1229160	1232160	Great minds think for themselves!
1232160	1235160	Especially when it comes to Jackie Robinson.
1235160	1241160	Along with starring in other Disney produced films such as Jack and Bicentennial Man.
1241160	1244160	It's scary. It's not scary, it's stupid.
1244160	1248160	Well, it was through a Disney subsidiary that he did eventually get his Oscar for Good Will Hunting
1248160	1251160	through Disney-owned Miramax, which of course was owned by Bob and Harvey.
1251160	1253160	What? God damn it.
1253160	1256160	You could argue that Disney's attempts to replicate the success of the Genie,
1256160	1258160	while they might have been lucrative for the company,
1258160	1261160	were hollow imitations that missed what worked about the part.
1261160	1263160	I'm losing to a bird!
1263160	1266160	That it was molded for Robin, that the role and the actor shaped one another,
1266160	1269160	and that a magical entity was the perfect animated vehicle
1269160	1272160	for his frenetic, pop-culture-laden stand-up style.
1272160	1276160	So Danny DeVito as a satyr saying he has a fur wedgie,
1276160	1278160	I got a fur wedgie!
1278160	1281160	or Jason Alexander losing to a bird,
1281160	1283160	I'm losing to a bird!
1283160	1285160	It just doesn't jive in the same way.
1285160	1290160	Having Jason Alexander do bad 14th century improv about how he wants to f**k a goat
1290160	1293160	is just such a shoddy attempt to recapture the magic of the Genie.
1293160	1297160	Because it misses what made the Genie work in the first place.
1297160	1301160	Al, all joking aside, you really ought to be yourself.
1301160	1304160	Musker and Clemens wanted Williams not because he was famous,
1304160	1307160	but because his persona was the inspiration for the part.
1307160	1309160	And on some level with art,
1309160	1313160	people can tell when inspiration comes from a genuine place of sincerity,
1313160	1315160	rather than a place of corporate cynicism.
1315160	1316160	And Oprah Winfrey.
1316160	1319160	And while that's not to say that Disney has never been able to replicate
1319160	1322160	that kind of performance with an A-list celebrity since,
1322160	1325160	there is a reason why Robin Williams' turn as the Genie
1325160	1328160	still sticks with us after almost 30 years,
1328160	1333160	and will most likely remain untarnished by a legacy of soulless, cash-grabbing messes.
1333160	1336160	Genie isn't beloved because Aladdin was successful.
1336160	1338160	It wasn't about money.
1338160	1340160	It wasn't about pop culture references.
1340160	1342160	And it wasn't because our animal brains go,
1342160	1344160	oh hey, wow, it's Mork.
1345160	1347160	It's heart.
1347160	1350160	Animation is something so wonderful about a cartoon
1350160	1353160	that you can sit with your child and just laugh like crazy.
1353160	1356160	Especially like the old Warner Brothers cartoons,
1356160	1357160	and that's what Aladdin was,
1357160	1360160	it's basically a Warner Brothers cartoon in Disney drag.
1360160	1362160	Let's make some magic!
1362160	1364160	But you think in 100 years, 200 years time,
1364160	1367160	that your great-great-grandchildren are going to be watching that movie.
1367160	1370160	But I want to do interesting films, work with interesting people,
1370160	1373160	and you know, it's something that has an effect,
1373160	1376160	and you know, kind of has a half-life.
1376160	1379160	I'm free. I'm free.
1379160	1380160	Because you get to a certain point and you say,
1380160	1381160	what are you leaving behind?
1381160	1383160	And if it's movies like this, I say great.
1383160	1387160	Genie, I'm going to miss you.
1387160	1389160	Me too, Al.
1391160	1393160	No matter what anybody says.
1394160	1396160	You'll always be a prince to me.
1413160	1415160	You'll always be a prince to me.
