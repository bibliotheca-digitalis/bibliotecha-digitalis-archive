00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
So, here's a question. When did animated movies start selling themselves on their bankable

00:05.600 --> 00:06.600
celebrity talent?

00:06.600 --> 00:07.600
Jim Carrey.

00:07.600 --> 00:09.320
There are people on this spectrum.

00:09.320 --> 00:10.320
Jerry Seinfeld.

00:10.320 --> 00:11.320
Renee Zellweger.

00:11.320 --> 00:12.320
Just show those sharks who's boss.

00:12.320 --> 00:13.320
Here I come. Ta-da!

00:13.320 --> 00:14.320
I tell you what's what.

00:14.320 --> 00:15.320
And what?

00:15.320 --> 00:16.320
Steve Carell.

00:16.320 --> 00:17.320
Dr. LaRue?

00:17.320 --> 00:25.360
Because it wasn't always like this. For most of the life of feature film animation, it

00:25.360 --> 00:29.980
was more analogous to how anime dubs are done in America today. Career voice talent and

00:29.980 --> 00:34.060
non-celebrities and character actors provided the voices and animated features were sold

00:34.060 --> 00:37.740
on pretty much every facet but their celebrity voice talent.

00:37.740 --> 00:38.740
And then came

00:38.740 --> 00:39.740
SOMEBODY

00:39.740 --> 00:45.660
and in a post-Shrek celebrity-driven animated feature world, well, it's not all there

00:45.660 --> 00:49.260
is, but in terms of sheer volume, it's most of it.

00:49.260 --> 00:53.580
Horrible turn of events. Horrible.

00:53.580 --> 00:57.980
But you know where this is going. Shrek might have codified the thing, but it did not kick

00:57.980 --> 01:01.380
off the thing. That dubious honor goes to…

01:01.380 --> 01:02.380
ALADDIN!

01:02.380 --> 01:06.300
Hello Aladdin, nice to have you on the show. Can we call you Al? Or maybe just Din?

01:06.300 --> 01:10.180
But here's the thing. The big celebrity on whose back Aladdin was marketed did not

01:10.180 --> 01:15.340
want this to happen. This current hellscape of James Corden playing Peter Rabbit and Patrick

01:15.340 --> 01:17.540
Stewart as the poop emoji?

01:17.540 --> 01:18.540
Just doing my duty.

01:18.540 --> 01:22.940
This is a hellish Mirror House version of what went down with Williams' experience

01:22.940 --> 01:27.260
with Disney. Williams did not want to be the celebrity off of which Aladdin was marketed.

01:27.540 --> 01:29.580
It's all part and parcel, the whole genie gig.

01:29.580 --> 01:33.700
His name being used to market the movie and its tie-in merchandise at all created a massive

01:33.700 --> 01:38.300
rift between himself and the Walt Disney Company that lasted for years. All because Disney

01:38.300 --> 01:42.900
just couldn't resist ignoring this man's request not to be used as a marketing tool

01:42.900 --> 01:43.900
for Aladdin.

01:43.900 --> 01:44.900
I am your master now.

01:44.900 --> 01:46.980
I wasn't afraid of that.

01:46.980 --> 01:49.420
This is the story.

01:49.420 --> 01:55.260
Now I'm the king of the swingers, oh.

01:55.260 --> 01:58.620
With the Disney renaissance of the 1990s and the prestige value that came with being

01:58.620 --> 02:02.340
in one of its movies, animated films were rarely the playground of A-list actors and

02:02.340 --> 02:07.300
more the territory of relatively unknown character actors and voice actors, with the occasional

02:07.300 --> 02:10.300
B-lister and C-lister thrown in.

02:10.300 --> 02:14.580
For instance, Ralph Bakshi's Lord of the Rings had… John Hurt.

02:14.580 --> 02:17.420
Well, you have put your foot in it this time.

02:17.420 --> 02:18.920
Who are you?

02:18.920 --> 02:22.020
The Rescuers snagged Bob Newhart and Ava Gabor.

02:22.340 --> 02:25.460
Oh Bernard, adventure.

02:25.460 --> 02:28.380
Gotta rope in that Green Acres crowd.

02:28.380 --> 02:31.940
I get allergic smelling hay.

02:31.940 --> 02:35.180
The Fox and the Hound had… Kurt Russell?

02:35.180 --> 02:36.180
The same year as-

02:36.180 --> 02:38.620
I don't give a fuck about your war.

02:38.620 --> 02:40.500
We're your president.

02:40.500 --> 02:41.500
Okay.

02:41.500 --> 02:45.060
Point being that voice casting for animated films was less of a star-studded affair and

02:45.060 --> 02:48.860
more of a people-you-might-see-on-nick-at-night sort of deal.

02:49.180 --> 02:52.900
I don't have to ask you what business you're in.

02:52.900 --> 02:57.220
Then comes 1986's The Great Mouse Detective, which was the first animated feature where

02:57.220 --> 03:01.260
Eisner and Katzenberg oversaw most of the production and the distribution, and while

03:01.260 --> 03:05.220
Mouse Detective had Vincent Price as the world's most extra-bitter ex-boyfriend-

03:05.220 --> 03:08.780
Trouble with the chemistry set, old boy.

03:08.780 --> 03:11.500
It wasn't what one would call a star vehicle.

03:11.500 --> 03:15.140
It did, however, turn enough of a profit to convince its new studio heads that there was

03:15.140 --> 03:17.940
still money to be made from Disney's animation division.

03:18.020 --> 03:22.380
Enter Oliver and Company, whose cast not only had way more considerable star power, but

03:22.380 --> 03:26.580
whose marketing also heavily relied on pushing said cast as a feature of the film.

03:26.580 --> 03:30.580
That's Midler, Huey Lewis, and Billy Joel.

03:30.580 --> 03:33.580
Why should I worry?

03:33.580 --> 03:36.580
Why should I care?

03:36.580 --> 03:40.700
Oliver and Company's $31 million budget was double that of Mouse Detective, presumably

03:40.700 --> 03:44.980
because of that voice cast, but it also earned twice what Great Mouse Detective did.

03:45.020 --> 03:49.620
The big takeaway here for Eisner and Katzenberg, star power gets attention, especially from

03:49.620 --> 03:54.620
adult moviegoers.

03:54.620 --> 03:58.140
Howard Ashman, one of the lyricists on Oliver and Rising Star in the Stage World with Little

03:58.140 --> 04:02.740
Shop of Horrors, is hired to work on Disney's next two movies, The Little Mermaid and Beauty

04:02.740 --> 04:03.980
and the Beast.

04:03.980 --> 04:08.260
And while these films are obviously financial and critical successes for Disney, a lot of

04:08.260 --> 04:12.700
their charm comes from being much more traditional book musicals that are appropriately cast

04:12.700 --> 04:14.300
with stage actors.

04:14.300 --> 04:17.700
The biggest star in Little Mermaid is, I guess, Buddy Hackett?

04:17.700 --> 04:23.300
It's a dinglehopper, a penile implant, which means a stick in your dick.

04:23.300 --> 04:28.700
And Beauty and the Beast's big Broadway gets are Angela Lansbury and Jerry Orbach.

04:28.700 --> 04:32.300
He's not whole without a soul to wait upon.

04:32.300 --> 04:37.060
Can't believe they got Mrs. Lovett and Baby's Dad from Dirty Dancing.

04:37.060 --> 04:39.060
But then came Aladdin.

04:39.060 --> 04:44.060
Ten thousand years will give you such a crick in the neck.

04:44.060 --> 04:45.060
Damn.

04:45.060 --> 04:48.060
A little sip of Perrier here.

04:48.060 --> 04:51.180
I had to stop drinking alcohol because I used to wake up nude and go to my car with my keys

04:51.180 --> 04:52.180
in my ass.

04:52.180 --> 04:57.700
Robin Williams became famous through his stand-up career, particularly as an improv comedian

04:57.700 --> 05:00.340
and his starring role in televisions Mork and Mindy.

05:00.340 --> 05:05.580
Fly, be free!

05:05.580 --> 05:08.700
But he initially struggled to translate that success into film.

05:08.700 --> 05:13.820
His first major starring role, Robert Altman's 1980 flop Popeye, which was partially produced

05:13.820 --> 05:27.700
by the Walt Disney Company, was a disaster, which led to a film career slump that lasted

05:27.700 --> 05:29.420
throughout the early 80s for Williams.

05:29.420 --> 05:33.540
But right around the time of the Eisner ascendancy at Disney came two opportunities for Robin

05:33.540 --> 05:42.980
Williams, produced under the Disney umbrella, his darling passion project Good Morning Vietnam

05:42.980 --> 05:47.540
and The Dead Poets Society, both of which garnered him Oscar nominations.

05:47.540 --> 05:52.320
And then came Hook a couple years later, which finally cemented Robin Williams as an A-list

05:52.320 --> 05:53.500
bankable star.

05:53.500 --> 05:56.860
But none of these films are so relevant to the story of Aladdin as a charming little

05:56.860 --> 06:10.900
polemic by the name of…

06:10.900 --> 06:14.340
While it seems on paper that this should be the cheap knock-off that was capitalizing

06:14.340 --> 06:18.440
on Williams' popularity as the genie, Fern Gully was actually a labor of love that had

06:18.440 --> 06:21.460
been in development for years before Aladdin.

06:21.460 --> 06:24.780
But it only really got off the ground after Robin Williams was cast in the role of pop

06:24.780 --> 06:37.380
culture-referencing, bigoted-against-humans, rapping PTSD bat, Batty Kota.

06:37.380 --> 06:40.700
And believe it or not, Williams was signed on for Fern Gully before he had even been

06:40.700 --> 06:42.340
approached for Aladdin.

06:42.340 --> 06:45.700
Fern Gully's screenwriter, Jim Cox, who had coincidentally worked on the first two

06:45.700 --> 06:49.080
screen treatments of Beauty and the Beast, had seen Williams performing at open mics

06:49.080 --> 06:53.780
in LA comedy clubs between his two Oscar nods, and wrote the role of Batty specifically around

06:53.780 --> 06:55.340
Williams' frenetic energy.

06:55.340 --> 06:59.080
Williams agreed to do it, according to Young, because he felt strongly about the actionable

06:59.080 --> 07:09.020
green message.

07:09.020 --> 07:13.300
So while Fern Gully is going into production, by pure happenstance we have a nearly mirror

07:13.300 --> 07:16.460
situation over at Disney with the film Aladdin.

07:16.460 --> 07:19.700
Williams' involvement did not originate with the studio cynically wanting an A-list

07:20.700 --> 07:25.620
adult audiences, Williams had a very cartoony persona, and he was inspiring to more than

07:25.620 --> 07:43.500
one animation studio at the same time.

07:43.500 --> 07:47.100
Not only was the part written for him, but they had pitched Aladdin as a Robin Williams

07:47.100 --> 07:50.140
vehicle before the actor had even been approached.

07:50.140 --> 07:51.140
Said Musker,

07:51.140 --> 07:53.300
Yeah, we wrote this part with Robin in mind.

07:53.300 --> 07:54.660
We didn't know if he would do it.

07:54.660 --> 07:56.500
We were totally walking down the plank.

07:56.500 --> 08:00.620
If he said no, we were gonna be in big trouble because the whole concept for Aladdin was

08:00.620 --> 08:04.700
built around Robin.

08:04.700 --> 08:08.300
Williams was hesitant, but was convinced to sign on when Musker and Clements had supervising

08:08.300 --> 08:12.140
animator Eric Goldberg create a sample reel of the genie set to one of Williams' old

08:12.620 --> 08:19.820
stand-up routines.

08:19.820 --> 08:24.060
Williams is said to have laughed his ass off, and then signed up immediately.

08:24.060 --> 08:34.540
According to Goldberg,

08:34.540 --> 08:38.460
And so, a deal was struck between Disney and Williams, who agreed to do the voice of the

08:38.460 --> 08:46.300
genie at SAG pay scale, about $70,000, with the following caveat.

08:46.300 --> 08:51.480
He specifically requested that Disney use his name in 25% or less of the promotional

08:51.480 --> 08:53.380
and marketing material for the movie.

08:53.380 --> 08:56.240
Part of the reason behind this was because Williams was worried that this would cannibalize

08:56.240 --> 09:00.780
the audience for his upcoming film and passion project, Toys, set to be released a few months

09:00.780 --> 09:05.340
after Aladdin, which arguably is what happened.

09:05.340 --> 09:08.180
But more important for Williams was something of an ethical bent.

09:08.180 --> 09:12.220
He also did not want his voice being used to sell merchandise.

09:12.220 --> 09:13.220
Said Williams,

09:13.220 --> 09:16.260
I love animation, and Disney is the Rolls-Royce of animation.

09:16.260 --> 09:19.260
But I told them, don't use my voice to sell merchandise.

09:19.260 --> 09:20.460
And they agreed to that.

09:20.460 --> 09:23.980
When Disney went ahead and used his voice in the marketing, Williams said, he felt,

09:23.980 --> 09:27.060
it was a violation of trust.

09:27.060 --> 09:31.060
Williams said, don't merchandise my character.

09:31.060 --> 09:33.260
To Disney.

09:34.260 --> 09:38.740
Initially, Disney stuck to their agreement, albeit in a roundabout way.

09:38.740 --> 09:43.900
Here's the initial teaser poster, and there's no mention of Williams or the genie in sight,

09:43.900 --> 09:46.620
just this classy backlit lamp.

09:46.620 --> 09:53.100
But Disney quickly found a, ahem, clever interpretation of this 25% of the marketing caveat that really

09:53.100 --> 09:58.700
pushed its limits while still being technically, eh, within reason.

09:58.700 --> 10:01.060
But that was nothing of a broach and agreement compared to

10:01.060 --> 10:20.180
We can only surmise why Disney went back on its promise with Williams, but suffice

10:20.180 --> 10:26.100
to say that it probably had a lot to do with the fact that he did not back out of being

10:26.100 --> 10:27.100
in Fern Gully.

10:28.100 --> 10:31.900
I know I am, I know I am.

10:31.900 --> 10:35.980
Studio president Jeffrey Katzenberg, petty asshole, legit thought Williams would drop

10:35.980 --> 10:39.300
out of Fern Gully to be in the bigger, more prestigious Aladdin.

10:39.300 --> 10:43.500
So Katzenberg, petty asshole, actively sabotaged Fern Gully.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.380
Said Fern Gully writer Diana Young,

10:45.380 --> 10:48.700
Twice we rented facilities and they gazumped us by paying more.

10:48.700 --> 10:51.860
When we found space in the brewery, Disney tried to buy it.

10:51.860 --> 10:55.800
One day Katzenberg, and eight or so others, marched through to inspect the premises.

10:55.800 --> 10:59.840
We scrambled to cover everything up, but it was also really about Robin.

10:59.840 --> 11:05.240
According to Jim Cox, Fern Gully's screenwriter, Robin was steaming, like, it's my voice,

11:05.240 --> 11:06.480
you can't stop me.

11:06.480 --> 11:11.000
It also didn't help that Williams' own response to Katzenberg's ire was like, fuck

11:11.000 --> 11:19.000
you, Fern Gully signed me first, I'm rapping the baddie rap.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.280
So Disney's like, well fuck you right back, we are going to renege on our promise.

11:23.320 --> 11:27.520
And thus began the now infamous feud between Williams and the Walt Disney Company, in which

11:27.520 --> 11:31.440
Williams was more than happy to start shitting publicly on Disney while they continued to

11:31.440 --> 11:33.000
use the genie to make money.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.960
Moreover, the moral implications of what his work was being used for irked him.

11:36.960 --> 11:40.520
The one thing I said was I will do the voice, I'm doing it basically because I want to

11:40.520 --> 11:44.160
be part of this animation tradition, I want something for my children.

11:44.160 --> 11:47.040
One deal is, I just don't want to sell anything.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.880
As in Burger King, as in toys, as in stuff.

11:49.880 --> 11:53.680
Not only did they use my voice, they took a character I did and overdubbed it to sell

11:53.680 --> 11:54.680
stuff.

11:54.680 --> 11:57.040
That was the one thing I said, I don't do that.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.840
That was the one thing where they crossed the line.

11:58.840 --> 12:03.080
A Disney spokesperson lobbed back that they had played completely fair game with Williams,

12:03.080 --> 12:07.440
and that they had reputably ran every piece of marketing material across him and his then-wife,

12:07.440 --> 12:08.440
Martha Marsha.

12:08.440 --> 12:12.220
Said the spokesperson, we did not use his voice in any way that he did not contractually

12:12.220 --> 12:13.220
agree to.

12:13.220 --> 12:16.400
He agreed to the deal, and then he made the movie, and then when the movie turned out

12:16.400 --> 12:19.680
to be a big hit, he didn't like the deal he had made.

12:19.680 --> 12:20.960
After all, you've lied to everyone else.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.560
Hey, I was beginning to feel left out.

12:22.560 --> 12:26.200
The bridge had been burned, that when even the Golden Globes gave Williams a special

12:26.200 --> 12:31.400
award for playing the genie, he gave a three-minute acceptance speech where he mostly faffed around

12:31.400 --> 12:36.080
and mentioned the Disney company not one time, although he did throw some shade at the petty

12:36.080 --> 12:37.080
asshole.

12:37.080 --> 12:40.920
I'd like to thank Jeffrey Katzenberg.

12:40.920 --> 12:46.960
Eisner attempted to mend bridges with Williams by sending him a Picasso painting, but Williams,

12:47.040 --> 12:49.840
asserting some big dick energy, remained unmoved.

12:56.160 --> 12:59.640
So of course, the real dramatic irony here is not that Williams' involvement in Aladdin

12:59.640 --> 13:03.920
started the trend of celebrity voice acting as a marketing strategy, which it totally

13:03.920 --> 13:08.360
did, but that the fallout was the last thing the man would have wanted.

13:08.360 --> 13:13.520
However, for better or worse, lessons were learned from the success of Aladdin.

13:13.520 --> 13:15.840
Cynical, cheap lessons.

13:17.120 --> 13:21.960
We saw it begin to some degree with The Lion King, and then more with Pocahontas.

13:21.960 --> 13:25.040
Mel Gibson was one of the biggest stars in the world at the time.

13:25.040 --> 13:28.800
But then after that, starting with the ones that were seriously in production after Aladdin

13:28.800 --> 13:33.960
was released, every Disney movie had a genie knockoff featuring some extremely bankable

13:33.960 --> 13:34.960
comedic talent.

13:34.960 --> 13:39.960
Okay everybody, move aside, out of my way, best friend coming through.

13:39.960 --> 13:44.560
Remember like a few years ago, every other boy was named Jason and the girls were all

13:44.560 --> 13:45.560
named Brittany?

13:46.560 --> 13:52.560
But of course, the most shameless, egregious example comes from

13:54.560 --> 13:57.960
But these examples are just from the Disney side of things.

13:57.960 --> 14:01.640
Let us not forget all of the other haters and losers out in the non-Disney animation

14:01.640 --> 14:04.200
world who were quick to jump on the same formula.

14:04.200 --> 14:11.160
Don Bluth saw not a lot of success in the 90s until Anastasia, which is not only a bald-faced,

14:11.160 --> 14:16.080
shameless rip-off of the Disney story formula, but also in how much it crammed in its miscast

14:16.080 --> 14:20.360
A and B-listers and marketed the shit out of it.

14:20.360 --> 14:25.160
Meg Ryan is hideously miscast as a plucky 18-year-old amnesiac.

14:25.160 --> 14:26.160
What?

14:26.160 --> 14:27.160
What?

14:27.160 --> 14:28.160
Are you circling me?

14:28.160 --> 14:29.160
What were you, a vulture in another life?

14:29.160 --> 14:31.160
Hank Azaria is our genie, I guess.

14:31.160 --> 14:33.160
Yeah, ain't that a kick in the head?

14:33.160 --> 14:35.160
I guess a curse just ain't what it used to be, huh, sir?

14:35.160 --> 14:36.160
And Christopher Lloyd.

14:36.160 --> 14:40.160
I have no feelings whatsoever.

14:40.160 --> 14:43.160
Ooh, yeah, that'll be a yikes for me, dawg.

14:43.160 --> 14:47.160
But the apogee of this trend of capturing adult interest in children's entertainment

14:47.160 --> 14:51.160
by way of celebrity voice talent comes to us at the hands of...

14:51.160 --> 14:52.160
SOMEBODY.

14:52.160 --> 14:57.160
Jeffrey Katzenberg, petty asshole, finds his biggest post-Disney successes by sniping Disney

14:57.160 --> 15:02.160
ideas and being, well, an extremely petty asshole, with his first shameless rip-off

15:02.160 --> 15:08.160
of a Disney project, ANTS, featuring uncanny valley nightmare versions of Woody Allen,

15:08.160 --> 15:11.160
Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone.

15:11.160 --> 15:17.160
Wow, those are some hot tickets in 1998, but mom and dad sure do know who they are.

15:17.160 --> 15:22.160
Call me crazy, but I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.

15:22.160 --> 15:27.160
Not only was it rumored that Katzenberg had decided to lift inspiration from the Pixar

15:27.160 --> 15:33.160
project then titled Bugs, but also that he browbeat the animation team at PDI to do everything

15:33.160 --> 15:36.160
they could to make sure it hit theaters before A Bug's Life did.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.160
Petty asshole.

15:40.160 --> 15:45.160
Right after that we had The Prince of Egypt, aka pulling a favor from every famous person

15:45.160 --> 15:46.160
in Hollywood.

15:46.160 --> 15:49.160
Wow, Hal Kilmer is just... he really loves playing Moses.

15:49.160 --> 15:53.160
How can this be? How can this be?

15:53.160 --> 15:54.160
And then...

15:54.160 --> 15:55.160
SOMEBODY.

15:55.160 --> 16:00.160
Yeah, I get that you love Shrek, but it is an extremely petty asshole movie.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.160
From its cheap, shallow digs at Disney...

16:02.160 --> 16:05.160
Too long is a perfect place.

16:06.160 --> 16:11.160
...to its totally-not-Michael-Eisner-inspired villain to its shameless pop culture references...

16:17.160 --> 16:22.160
...to a celebrity-driven marketing campaign that makes Aladdin look downright subtle.

16:22.160 --> 16:25.160
And joining DreamWorks were the knockoffs, which haunt us to this day.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.160
Woof.

16:37.160 --> 16:40.160
Of course there's Illumination Animation...

16:47.160 --> 16:52.160
...and even further down the totem pole, Sony Pictures Animation, with even cheaper, shittier

16:52.160 --> 16:53.160
movies.

16:53.160 --> 16:55.160
Most of the time, yeah, they have the one exception.

16:55.160 --> 16:56.160
Like, incredibly cheap.

16:56.160 --> 16:59.160
Probably more than half the budget goes to the voice actors.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.160
Like, what the hell is this stu-

17:06.160 --> 17:14.160
What? How did that get Oprah?

17:14.160 --> 17:18.160
By the time Lilo and Stitch rolled around, there seemed to be a return to form in which

17:18.160 --> 17:22.160
Disney was casting based on roles, as opposed to writing roles for a celebrity.

17:22.160 --> 17:26.160
And ever since Disney's animation studio got back on track, let's say starting with

17:26.160 --> 17:30.160
Tangled, the company's more or less fallen back into the spirit it originally started

17:30.160 --> 17:31.160
from.

17:31.160 --> 17:34.160
Both Disney's animation studio and Pixar produce roughly one film a year, and while

17:34.160 --> 17:37.160
they don't necessarily want for lack of well-known talent...

17:40.160 --> 17:43.160
...casting is less of a gimmick to get asses in seats, and more of a creative choice that

17:43.160 --> 17:47.160
plays to the strength of the character and the actor inhabiting the role, whether they're

17:47.160 --> 17:49.160
super famous or not.

17:49.160 --> 17:51.160
And may I add, I love your dress, it's adorable.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.160
Oh, this old thing? Thank you so much. I love the way it twirls.

17:53.160 --> 17:54.160
Oh, thank you, Joy. Thank you, Joy.

17:54.160 --> 17:59.160
But hey, Disney now totally owns Blue Sky Animation after the 20th Century Fox merger.

17:59.160 --> 18:06.160
So they own shit, like, epic now, with its Aziz Ansari slug.

18:06.160 --> 18:10.160
Boom! Right here. Biggest in the merch.

18:10.160 --> 18:13.160
Hey, if you can't beat him, buy him.

18:13.160 --> 18:16.160
But hey, I think we're forgetting the most important question.

18:16.160 --> 18:19.160
What about Return of Jafar?

18:20.160 --> 18:22.160
Ooh, she dances.

18:22.160 --> 18:27.160
Was the big feud the reason Williams was not in beloved direct-to-video classic, The Return

18:27.160 --> 18:29.160
of Jafar? Yeah, it was. Pretty much.

18:29.160 --> 18:32.160
You saw the whole world already?

18:32.160 --> 18:35.160
It's a small world after all.

18:35.160 --> 18:40.160
Williams declined to reprise the role of the genie in the not-good-and-quite-bad direct-to-video

18:40.160 --> 18:45.160
sequel, itself the spark for another long, sad trend that would last more than a decade

18:45.160 --> 18:47.160
and we're not going to get into right now.

18:47.160 --> 18:52.160
This is no angel. It's the shadow of a monster.

18:52.160 --> 18:57.160
Not because he thought a sequel was necessarily beneath him, but because he was still furious

18:57.160 --> 18:59.160
about the way that Disney handled Aladdin.

18:59.160 --> 19:03.160
So Disney went ahead and made it and replaced Robin Williams with Homer Simpson.

19:03.160 --> 19:07.160
He's big! He's blue! He's back!

19:07.160 --> 19:11.160
That was probably also the reason why they didn't bother giving that movie a budget

19:11.160 --> 19:14.160
or making it look like not-ass.

19:14.160 --> 19:19.160
Steal from us again and your squirmy body will be dinner for the jackal!

19:19.160 --> 19:25.160
But in the end, the feud was mended not by money or Picassos, but by sincerity, or at least

19:25.160 --> 19:28.160
the public performance of sincerity.

19:28.160 --> 19:30.160
And of course by firing the petty asshole.

19:30.160 --> 19:34.160
Joe Roth, Jeffrey Katzenberg's successor as studio chief, issued a public heartfelt

19:34.160 --> 19:36.160
apology on the debacle, saying,

19:50.160 --> 19:52.160
They are simply about principle.

19:52.160 --> 19:56.160
And with peace reinstated, Williams went on to voice the Genie in other projects.

19:56.160 --> 20:01.160
Oh come on, enough of this dark past. Let's roll out something a little new.

20:01.160 --> 20:04.160
Including the slightly less shitty threequel.

20:04.160 --> 20:06.160
And boy, did Disney want you to know that he was back.

20:06.160 --> 20:08.160
I'm back!

20:08.160 --> 20:12.160
Including the Genie, brought to life again by the one and only Robin Williams.

20:12.160 --> 20:15.160
It's a kinder, gentler Genie. Look at it!

20:16.160 --> 20:20.160
I mean, of course they did. Williams was decidedly not paid scale this time around,

20:20.160 --> 20:23.160
netting a cool one million for reprising his role.

20:23.160 --> 20:27.160
After that, Williams did reprise the role of the Genie a smattering of times,

20:27.160 --> 20:29.160
but only in educational content.

20:29.160 --> 20:32.160
Great minds think for themselves!

20:32.160 --> 20:35.160
Especially when it comes to Jackie Robinson.

20:35.160 --> 20:41.160
Along with starring in other Disney produced films such as Jack and Bicentennial Man.

20:41.160 --> 20:44.160
It's scary. It's not scary, it's stupid.

20:44.160 --> 20:48.160
Well, it was through a Disney subsidiary that he did eventually get his Oscar for Good Will Hunting

20:48.160 --> 20:51.160
through Disney-owned Miramax, which of course was owned by Bob and Harvey.

20:51.160 --> 20:53.160
What? God damn it.

20:53.160 --> 20:56.160
You could argue that Disney's attempts to replicate the success of the Genie,

20:56.160 --> 20:58.160
while they might have been lucrative for the company,

20:58.160 --> 21:01.160
were hollow imitations that missed what worked about the part.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.160
I'm losing to a bird!

21:03.160 --> 21:06.160
That it was molded for Robin, that the role and the actor shaped one another,

21:06.160 --> 21:09.160
and that a magical entity was the perfect animated vehicle

21:09.160 --> 21:12.160
for his frenetic, pop-culture-laden stand-up style.

21:12.160 --> 21:16.160
So Danny DeVito as a satyr saying he has a fur wedgie,

21:16.160 --> 21:18.160
I got a fur wedgie!

21:18.160 --> 21:21.160
or Jason Alexander losing to a bird,

21:21.160 --> 21:23.160
I'm losing to a bird!

21:23.160 --> 21:25.160
It just doesn't jive in the same way.

21:25.160 --> 21:30.160
Having Jason Alexander do bad 14th century improv about how he wants to f**k a goat

21:30.160 --> 21:33.160
is just such a shoddy attempt to recapture the magic of the Genie.

21:33.160 --> 21:37.160
Because it misses what made the Genie work in the first place.

21:37.160 --> 21:41.160
Al, all joking aside, you really ought to be yourself.

21:41.160 --> 21:44.160
Musker and Clemens wanted Williams not because he was famous,

21:44.160 --> 21:47.160
but because his persona was the inspiration for the part.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.160
And on some level with art,

21:49.160 --> 21:53.160
people can tell when inspiration comes from a genuine place of sincerity,

21:53.160 --> 21:55.160
rather than a place of corporate cynicism.

21:55.160 --> 21:56.160
And Oprah Winfrey.

21:56.160 --> 21:59.160
And while that's not to say that Disney has never been able to replicate

21:59.160 --> 22:02.160
that kind of performance with an A-list celebrity since,

22:02.160 --> 22:05.160
there is a reason why Robin Williams' turn as the Genie

22:05.160 --> 22:08.160
still sticks with us after almost 30 years,

22:08.160 --> 22:13.160
and will most likely remain untarnished by a legacy of soulless, cash-grabbing messes.

22:13.160 --> 22:16.160
Genie isn't beloved because Aladdin was successful.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.160
It wasn't about money.

22:18.160 --> 22:20.160
It wasn't about pop culture references.

22:20.160 --> 22:22.160
And it wasn't because our animal brains go,

22:22.160 --> 22:24.160
oh hey, wow, it's Mork.

22:25.160 --> 22:27.160
It's heart.

22:27.160 --> 22:30.160
Animation is something so wonderful about a cartoon

22:30.160 --> 22:33.160
that you can sit with your child and just laugh like crazy.

22:33.160 --> 22:36.160
Especially like the old Warner Brothers cartoons,

22:36.160 --> 22:37.160
and that's what Aladdin was,

22:37.160 --> 22:40.160
it's basically a Warner Brothers cartoon in Disney drag.

22:40.160 --> 22:42.160
Let's make some magic!

22:42.160 --> 22:44.160
But you think in 100 years, 200 years time,

22:44.160 --> 22:47.160
that your great-great-grandchildren are going to be watching that movie.

22:47.160 --> 22:50.160
But I want to do interesting films, work with interesting people,

22:50.160 --> 22:53.160
and you know, it's something that has an effect,

22:53.160 --> 22:56.160
and you know, kind of has a half-life.

22:56.160 --> 22:59.160
I'm free. I'm free.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.160
Because you get to a certain point and you say,

23:00.160 --> 23:01.160
what are you leaving behind?

23:01.160 --> 23:03.160
And if it's movies like this, I say great.

23:03.160 --> 23:07.160
Genie, I'm going to miss you.

23:07.160 --> 23:09.160
Me too, Al.

23:11.160 --> 23:13.160
No matter what anybody says.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.160
You'll always be a prince to me.

23:33.160 --> 23:35.160
You'll always be a prince to me.
