1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
So, here's a question. When did animated movies start selling themselves on their bankable

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,600
celebrity talent?

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,600
Jim Carrey.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,320
There are people on this spectrum.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,320
Jerry Seinfeld.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,320
Renee Zellweger.

7
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,320
Just show those sharks who's boss.

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,320
Here I come. Ta-da!

9
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,320
I tell you what's what.

10
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,320
And what?

11
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,320
Steve Carell.

12
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,320
Dr. LaRue?

13
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:25,360
Because it wasn't always like this. For most of the life of feature film animation, it

14
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,980
was more analogous to how anime dubs are done in America today. Career voice talent and

15
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,060
non-celebrities and character actors provided the voices and animated features were sold

16
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,740
on pretty much every facet but their celebrity voice talent.

17
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,740
And then came

18
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,740
SOMEBODY

19
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:45,660
and in a post-Shrek celebrity-driven animated feature world, well, it's not all there

20
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,260
is, but in terms of sheer volume, it's most of it.

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,580
Horrible turn of events. Horrible.

22
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,980
But you know where this is going. Shrek might have codified the thing, but it did not kick

23
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,380
off the thing. That dubious honor goes to…

24
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,380
ALADDIN!

25
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,300
Hello Aladdin, nice to have you on the show. Can we call you Al? Or maybe just Din?

26
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,180
But here's the thing. The big celebrity on whose back Aladdin was marketed did not

27
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,340
want this to happen. This current hellscape of James Corden playing Peter Rabbit and Patrick

28
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,540
Stewart as the poop emoji?

29
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,540
Just doing my duty.

30
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,940
This is a hellish Mirror House version of what went down with Williams' experience

31
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,260
with Disney. Williams did not want to be the celebrity off of which Aladdin was marketed.

32
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,580
It's all part and parcel, the whole genie gig.

33
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,700
His name being used to market the movie and its tie-in merchandise at all created a massive

34
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,300
rift between himself and the Walt Disney Company that lasted for years. All because Disney

35
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,900
just couldn't resist ignoring this man's request not to be used as a marketing tool

36
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,900
for Aladdin.

37
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,900
I am your master now.

38
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,980
I wasn't afraid of that.

39
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,420
This is the story.

40
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:55,260
Now I'm the king of the swingers, oh.

41
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,620
With the Disney renaissance of the 1990s and the prestige value that came with being

42
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,340
in one of its movies, animated films were rarely the playground of A-list actors and

43
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,300
more the territory of relatively unknown character actors and voice actors, with the occasional

44
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,300
B-lister and C-lister thrown in.

45
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,580
For instance, Ralph Bakshi's Lord of the Rings had… John Hurt.

46
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,420
Well, you have put your foot in it this time.

47
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,920
Who are you?

48
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,020
The Rescuers snagged Bob Newhart and Ava Gabor.

49
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,460
Oh Bernard, adventure.

50
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,380
Gotta rope in that Green Acres crowd.

51
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,940
I get allergic smelling hay.

52
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,180
The Fox and the Hound had… Kurt Russell?

53
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,180
The same year as-

54
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,620
I don't give a fuck about your war.

55
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,500
We're your president.

56
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,500
Okay.

57
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,060
Point being that voice casting for animated films was less of a star-studded affair and

58
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,860
more of a people-you-might-see-on-nick-at-night sort of deal.

59
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,900
I don't have to ask you what business you're in.

60
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,220
Then comes 1986's The Great Mouse Detective, which was the first animated feature where

61
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,260
Eisner and Katzenberg oversaw most of the production and the distribution, and while

62
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,220
Mouse Detective had Vincent Price as the world's most extra-bitter ex-boyfriend-

63
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,780
Trouble with the chemistry set, old boy.

64
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,500
It wasn't what one would call a star vehicle.

65
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,140
It did, however, turn enough of a profit to convince its new studio heads that there was

66
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,940
still money to be made from Disney's animation division.

67
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,380
Enter Oliver and Company, whose cast not only had way more considerable star power, but

68
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,580
whose marketing also heavily relied on pushing said cast as a feature of the film.

69
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,580
That's Midler, Huey Lewis, and Billy Joel.

70
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,580
Why should I worry?

71
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,580
Why should I care?

72
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,700
Oliver and Company's $31 million budget was double that of Mouse Detective, presumably

73
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,980
because of that voice cast, but it also earned twice what Great Mouse Detective did.

74
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,620
The big takeaway here for Eisner and Katzenberg, star power gets attention, especially from

75
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,620
adult moviegoers.

76
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,140
Howard Ashman, one of the lyricists on Oliver and Rising Star in the Stage World with Little

77
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,740
Shop of Horrors, is hired to work on Disney's next two movies, The Little Mermaid and Beauty

78
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,980
and the Beast.

79
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,260
And while these films are obviously financial and critical successes for Disney, a lot of

80
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,700
their charm comes from being much more traditional book musicals that are appropriately cast

81
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,300
with stage actors.

82
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,700
The biggest star in Little Mermaid is, I guess, Buddy Hackett?

83
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:23,300
It's a dinglehopper, a penile implant, which means a stick in your dick.

84
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,700
And Beauty and the Beast's big Broadway gets are Angela Lansbury and Jerry Orbach.

85
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,300
He's not whole without a soul to wait upon.

86
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,060
Can't believe they got Mrs. Lovett and Baby's Dad from Dirty Dancing.

87
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,060
But then came Aladdin.

88
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,060
Ten thousand years will give you such a crick in the neck.

89
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,060
Damn.

90
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,060
A little sip of Perrier here.

91
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,180
I had to stop drinking alcohol because I used to wake up nude and go to my car with my keys

92
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,180
in my ass.

93
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,700
Robin Williams became famous through his stand-up career, particularly as an improv comedian

94
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,340
and his starring role in televisions Mork and Mindy.

95
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:05,580
Fly, be free!

96
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,700
But he initially struggled to translate that success into film.

97
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,820
His first major starring role, Robert Altman's 1980 flop Popeye, which was partially produced

98
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:27,700
by the Walt Disney Company, was a disaster, which led to a film career slump that lasted

99
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,420
throughout the early 80s for Williams.

100
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,540
But right around the time of the Eisner ascendancy at Disney came two opportunities for Robin

101
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:42,980
Williams, produced under the Disney umbrella, his darling passion project Good Morning Vietnam

102
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,540
and The Dead Poets Society, both of which garnered him Oscar nominations.

103
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,320
And then came Hook a couple years later, which finally cemented Robin Williams as an A-list

104
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,500
bankable star.

105
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,860
But none of these films are so relevant to the story of Aladdin as a charming little

106
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:10,900
polemic by the name of…

107
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,340
While it seems on paper that this should be the cheap knock-off that was capitalizing

108
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,440
on Williams' popularity as the genie, Fern Gully was actually a labor of love that had

109
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,460
been in development for years before Aladdin.

110
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,780
But it only really got off the ground after Robin Williams was cast in the role of pop

111
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:37,380
culture-referencing, bigoted-against-humans, rapping PTSD bat, Batty Kota.

112
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,700
And believe it or not, Williams was signed on for Fern Gully before he had even been

113
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,340
approached for Aladdin.

114
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,700
Fern Gully's screenwriter, Jim Cox, who had coincidentally worked on the first two

115
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,080
screen treatments of Beauty and the Beast, had seen Williams performing at open mics

116
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,780
in LA comedy clubs between his two Oscar nods, and wrote the role of Batty specifically around

117
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,340
Williams' frenetic energy.

118
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,080
Williams agreed to do it, according to Young, because he felt strongly about the actionable

119
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:09,020
green message.

120
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,300
So while Fern Gully is going into production, by pure happenstance we have a nearly mirror

121
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,460
situation over at Disney with the film Aladdin.

122
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,700
Williams' involvement did not originate with the studio cynically wanting an A-list

123
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,620
adult audiences, Williams had a very cartoony persona, and he was inspiring to more than

124
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:43,500
one animation studio at the same time.

125
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,100
Not only was the part written for him, but they had pitched Aladdin as a Robin Williams

126
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,140
vehicle before the actor had even been approached.

127
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,140
Said Musker,

128
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,300
Yeah, we wrote this part with Robin in mind.

129
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,660
We didn't know if he would do it.

130
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,500
We were totally walking down the plank.

131
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,620
If he said no, we were gonna be in big trouble because the whole concept for Aladdin was

132
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,700
built around Robin.

133
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,300
Williams was hesitant, but was convinced to sign on when Musker and Clements had supervising

134
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,140
animator Eric Goldberg create a sample reel of the genie set to one of Williams' old

135
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:19,820
stand-up routines.

136
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,060
Williams is said to have laughed his ass off, and then signed up immediately.

137
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:34,540
According to Goldberg,

138
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:38,460
And so, a deal was struck between Disney and Williams, who agreed to do the voice of the

139
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:46,300
genie at SAG pay scale, about $70,000, with the following caveat.

140
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,480
He specifically requested that Disney use his name in 25% or less of the promotional

141
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,380
and marketing material for the movie.

142
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,240
Part of the reason behind this was because Williams was worried that this would cannibalize

143
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,780
the audience for his upcoming film and passion project, Toys, set to be released a few months

144
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,340
after Aladdin, which arguably is what happened.

145
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,180
But more important for Williams was something of an ethical bent.

146
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,220
He also did not want his voice being used to sell merchandise.

147
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,220
Said Williams,

148
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,260
I love animation, and Disney is the Rolls-Royce of animation.

149
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,260
But I told them, don't use my voice to sell merchandise.

150
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,460
And they agreed to that.

151
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,980
When Disney went ahead and used his voice in the marketing, Williams said, he felt,

152
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,060
it was a violation of trust.

153
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,060
Williams said, don't merchandise my character.

154
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,260
To Disney.

155
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,740
Initially, Disney stuck to their agreement, albeit in a roundabout way.

156
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,900
Here's the initial teaser poster, and there's no mention of Williams or the genie in sight,

157
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,620
just this classy backlit lamp.

158
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:53,100
But Disney quickly found a, ahem, clever interpretation of this 25% of the marketing caveat that really

159
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,700
pushed its limits while still being technically, eh, within reason.

160
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,060
But that was nothing of a broach and agreement compared to

161
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:20,180
We can only surmise why Disney went back on its promise with Williams, but suffice

162
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:26,100
to say that it probably had a lot to do with the fact that he did not back out of being

163
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,100
in Fern Gully.

164
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,900
I know I am, I know I am.

165
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,980
Studio president Jeffrey Katzenberg, petty asshole, legit thought Williams would drop

166
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,300
out of Fern Gully to be in the bigger, more prestigious Aladdin.

167
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,500
So Katzenberg, petty asshole, actively sabotaged Fern Gully.

168
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,380
Said Fern Gully writer Diana Young,

169
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,700
Twice we rented facilities and they gazumped us by paying more.

170
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,860
When we found space in the brewery, Disney tried to buy it.

171
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,800
One day Katzenberg, and eight or so others, marched through to inspect the premises.

172
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,840
We scrambled to cover everything up, but it was also really about Robin.

173
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:05,240
According to Jim Cox, Fern Gully's screenwriter, Robin was steaming, like, it's my voice,

174
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,480
you can't stop me.

175
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,000
It also didn't help that Williams' own response to Katzenberg's ire was like, fuck

176
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:19,000
you, Fern Gully signed me first, I'm rapping the baddie rap.

177
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,280
So Disney's like, well fuck you right back, we are going to renege on our promise.

178
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,520
And thus began the now infamous feud between Williams and the Walt Disney Company, in which

179
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,440
Williams was more than happy to start shitting publicly on Disney while they continued to

180
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,000
use the genie to make money.

181
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,960
Moreover, the moral implications of what his work was being used for irked him.

182
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,520
The one thing I said was I will do the voice, I'm doing it basically because I want to

183
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,160
be part of this animation tradition, I want something for my children.

184
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,040
One deal is, I just don't want to sell anything.

185
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,880
As in Burger King, as in toys, as in stuff.

186
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,680
Not only did they use my voice, they took a character I did and overdubbed it to sell

187
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,680
stuff.

188
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,040
That was the one thing I said, I don't do that.

189
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,840
That was the one thing where they crossed the line.

190
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,080
A Disney spokesperson lobbed back that they had played completely fair game with Williams,

191
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,440
and that they had reputably ran every piece of marketing material across him and his then-wife,

192
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,440
Martha Marsha.

193
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,220
Said the spokesperson, we did not use his voice in any way that he did not contractually

194
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,220
agree to.

195
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,400
He agreed to the deal, and then he made the movie, and then when the movie turned out

196
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,680
to be a big hit, he didn't like the deal he had made.

197
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,960
After all, you've lied to everyone else.

198
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,560
Hey, I was beginning to feel left out.

199
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,200
The bridge had been burned, that when even the Golden Globes gave Williams a special

200
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,400
award for playing the genie, he gave a three-minute acceptance speech where he mostly faffed around

201
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,080
and mentioned the Disney company not one time, although he did throw some shade at the petty

202
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
asshole.

203
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,920
I'd like to thank Jeffrey Katzenberg.

204
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,960
Eisner attempted to mend bridges with Williams by sending him a Picasso painting, but Williams,

205
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,840
asserting some big dick energy, remained unmoved.

206
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,640
So of course, the real dramatic irony here is not that Williams' involvement in Aladdin

207
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,920
started the trend of celebrity voice acting as a marketing strategy, which it totally

208
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,360
did, but that the fallout was the last thing the man would have wanted.

209
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,520
However, for better or worse, lessons were learned from the success of Aladdin.

210
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,840
Cynical, cheap lessons.

211
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,960
We saw it begin to some degree with The Lion King, and then more with Pocahontas.

212
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,040
Mel Gibson was one of the biggest stars in the world at the time.

213
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,800
But then after that, starting with the ones that were seriously in production after Aladdin

214
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,960
was released, every Disney movie had a genie knockoff featuring some extremely bankable

215
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,960
comedic talent.

216
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,960
Okay everybody, move aside, out of my way, best friend coming through.

217
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,560
Remember like a few years ago, every other boy was named Jason and the girls were all

218
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
named Brittany?

219
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,560
But of course, the most shameless, egregious example comes from

220
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,960
But these examples are just from the Disney side of things.

221
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,640
Let us not forget all of the other haters and losers out in the non-Disney animation

222
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,200
world who were quick to jump on the same formula.

223
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:11,160
Don Bluth saw not a lot of success in the 90s until Anastasia, which is not only a bald-faced,

224
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,080
shameless rip-off of the Disney story formula, but also in how much it crammed in its miscast

225
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,360
A and B-listers and marketed the shit out of it.

226
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,160
Meg Ryan is hideously miscast as a plucky 18-year-old amnesiac.

227
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
What?

228
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
What?

229
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,160
Are you circling me?

230
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,160
What were you, a vulture in another life?

231
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,160
Hank Azaria is our genie, I guess.

232
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,160
Yeah, ain't that a kick in the head?

233
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,160
I guess a curse just ain't what it used to be, huh, sir?

234
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
And Christopher Lloyd.

235
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,160
I have no feelings whatsoever.

236
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,160
Ooh, yeah, that'll be a yikes for me, dawg.

237
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,160
But the apogee of this trend of capturing adult interest in children's entertainment

238
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,160
by way of celebrity voice talent comes to us at the hands of...

239
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,160
SOMEBODY.

240
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,160
Jeffrey Katzenberg, petty asshole, finds his biggest post-Disney successes by sniping Disney

241
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,160
ideas and being, well, an extremely petty asshole, with his first shameless rip-off

242
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:08,160
of a Disney project, ANTS, featuring uncanny valley nightmare versions of Woody Allen,

243
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,160
Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone.

244
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:17,160
Wow, those are some hot tickets in 1998, but mom and dad sure do know who they are.

245
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:22,160
Call me crazy, but I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.

246
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,160
Not only was it rumored that Katzenberg had decided to lift inspiration from the Pixar

247
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:33,160
project then titled Bugs, but also that he browbeat the animation team at PDI to do everything

248
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,160
they could to make sure it hit theaters before A Bug's Life did.

249
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,160
Petty asshole.

250
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,160
Right after that we had The Prince of Egypt, aka pulling a favor from every famous person

251
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
in Hollywood.

252
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,160
Wow, Hal Kilmer is just... he really loves playing Moses.

253
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,160
How can this be? How can this be?

254
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,160
And then...

255
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,160
SOMEBODY.

256
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:00,160
Yeah, I get that you love Shrek, but it is an extremely petty asshole movie.

257
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
From its cheap, shallow digs at Disney...

258
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,160
Too long is a perfect place.

259
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,160
...to its totally-not-Michael-Eisner-inspired villain to its shameless pop culture references...

260
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,160
...to a celebrity-driven marketing campaign that makes Aladdin look downright subtle.

261
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,160
And joining DreamWorks were the knockoffs, which haunt us to this day.

262
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
Woof.

263
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,160
Of course there's Illumination Animation...

264
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,160
...and even further down the totem pole, Sony Pictures Animation, with even cheaper, shittier

265
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,160
movies.

266
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,160
Most of the time, yeah, they have the one exception.

267
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,160
Like, incredibly cheap.

268
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,160
Probably more than half the budget goes to the voice actors.

269
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,160
Like, what the hell is this stu-

270
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:14,160
What? How did that get Oprah?

271
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,160
By the time Lilo and Stitch rolled around, there seemed to be a return to form in which

272
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,160
Disney was casting based on roles, as opposed to writing roles for a celebrity.

273
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,160
And ever since Disney's animation studio got back on track, let's say starting with

274
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,160
Tangled, the company's more or less fallen back into the spirit it originally started

275
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
from.

276
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,160
Both Disney's animation studio and Pixar produce roughly one film a year, and while

277
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,160
they don't necessarily want for lack of well-known talent...

278
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,160
...casting is less of a gimmick to get asses in seats, and more of a creative choice that

279
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,160
plays to the strength of the character and the actor inhabiting the role, whether they're

280
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,160
super famous or not.

281
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,160
And may I add, I love your dress, it's adorable.

282
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,160
Oh, this old thing? Thank you so much. I love the way it twirls.

283
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
Oh, thank you, Joy. Thank you, Joy.

284
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,160
But hey, Disney now totally owns Blue Sky Animation after the 20th Century Fox merger.

285
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:06,160
So they own shit, like, epic now, with its Aziz Ansari slug.

286
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,160
Boom! Right here. Biggest in the merch.

287
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,160
Hey, if you can't beat him, buy him.

288
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,160
But hey, I think we're forgetting the most important question.

289
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,160
What about Return of Jafar?

290
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
Ooh, she dances.

291
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,160
Was the big feud the reason Williams was not in beloved direct-to-video classic, The Return

292
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,160
of Jafar? Yeah, it was. Pretty much.

293
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,160
You saw the whole world already?

294
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,160
It's a small world after all.

295
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,160
Williams declined to reprise the role of the genie in the not-good-and-quite-bad direct-to-video

296
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,160
sequel, itself the spark for another long, sad trend that would last more than a decade

297
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,160
and we're not going to get into right now.

298
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,160
This is no angel. It's the shadow of a monster.

299
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,160
Not because he thought a sequel was necessarily beneath him, but because he was still furious

300
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,160
about the way that Disney handled Aladdin.

301
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,160
So Disney went ahead and made it and replaced Robin Williams with Homer Simpson.

302
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,160
He's big! He's blue! He's back!

303
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,160
That was probably also the reason why they didn't bother giving that movie a budget

304
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,160
or making it look like not-ass.

305
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,160
Steal from us again and your squirmy body will be dinner for the jackal!

306
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:25,160
But in the end, the feud was mended not by money or Picassos, but by sincerity, or at least

307
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,160
the public performance of sincerity.

308
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
And of course by firing the petty asshole.

309
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,160
Joe Roth, Jeffrey Katzenberg's successor as studio chief, issued a public heartfelt

310
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
apology on the debacle, saying,

311
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
They are simply about principle.

312
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,160
And with peace reinstated, Williams went on to voice the Genie in other projects.

313
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,160
Oh come on, enough of this dark past. Let's roll out something a little new.

314
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,160
Including the slightly less shitty threequel.

315
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,160
And boy, did Disney want you to know that he was back.

316
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,160
I'm back!

317
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,160
Including the Genie, brought to life again by the one and only Robin Williams.

318
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,160
It's a kinder, gentler Genie. Look at it!

319
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,160
I mean, of course they did. Williams was decidedly not paid scale this time around,

320
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,160
netting a cool one million for reprising his role.

321
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,160
After that, Williams did reprise the role of the Genie a smattering of times,

322
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,160
but only in educational content.

323
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,160
Great minds think for themselves!

324
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,160
Especially when it comes to Jackie Robinson.

325
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:41,160
Along with starring in other Disney produced films such as Jack and Bicentennial Man.

326
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,160
It's scary. It's not scary, it's stupid.

327
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,160
Well, it was through a Disney subsidiary that he did eventually get his Oscar for Good Will Hunting

328
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,160
through Disney-owned Miramax, which of course was owned by Bob and Harvey.

329
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,160
What? God damn it.

330
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,160
You could argue that Disney's attempts to replicate the success of the Genie,

331
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,160
while they might have been lucrative for the company,

332
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,160
were hollow imitations that missed what worked about the part.

333
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,160
I'm losing to a bird!

334
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,160
That it was molded for Robin, that the role and the actor shaped one another,

335
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,160
and that a magical entity was the perfect animated vehicle

336
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,160
for his frenetic, pop-culture-laden stand-up style.

337
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,160
So Danny DeVito as a satyr saying he has a fur wedgie,

338
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,160
I got a fur wedgie!

339
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,160
or Jason Alexander losing to a bird,

340
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,160
I'm losing to a bird!

341
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,160
It just doesn't jive in the same way.

342
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,160
Having Jason Alexander do bad 14th century improv about how he wants to f**k a goat

343
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,160
is just such a shoddy attempt to recapture the magic of the Genie.

344
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,160
Because it misses what made the Genie work in the first place.

345
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,160
Al, all joking aside, you really ought to be yourself.

346
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,160
Musker and Clemens wanted Williams not because he was famous,

347
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,160
but because his persona was the inspiration for the part.

348
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,160
And on some level with art,

349
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,160
people can tell when inspiration comes from a genuine place of sincerity,

350
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,160
rather than a place of corporate cynicism.

351
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,160
And Oprah Winfrey.

352
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,160
And while that's not to say that Disney has never been able to replicate

353
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,160
that kind of performance with an A-list celebrity since,

354
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,160
there is a reason why Robin Williams' turn as the Genie

355
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,160
still sticks with us after almost 30 years,

356
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:13,160
and will most likely remain untarnished by a legacy of soulless, cash-grabbing messes.

357
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,160
Genie isn't beloved because Aladdin was successful.

358
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,160
It wasn't about money.

359
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,160
It wasn't about pop culture references.

360
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,160
And it wasn't because our animal brains go,

361
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,160
oh hey, wow, it's Mork.

362
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,160
It's heart.

363
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,160
Animation is something so wonderful about a cartoon

364
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,160
that you can sit with your child and just laugh like crazy.

365
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,160
Especially like the old Warner Brothers cartoons,

366
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,160
and that's what Aladdin was,

367
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,160
it's basically a Warner Brothers cartoon in Disney drag.

368
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,160
Let's make some magic!

369
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,160
But you think in 100 years, 200 years time,

370
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,160
that your great-great-grandchildren are going to be watching that movie.

371
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,160
But I want to do interesting films, work with interesting people,

372
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,160
and you know, it's something that has an effect,

373
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,160
and you know, kind of has a half-life.

374
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,160
I'm free. I'm free.

375
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,160
Because you get to a certain point and you say,

376
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,160
what are you leaving behind?

377
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,160
And if it's movies like this, I say great.

378
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,160
Genie, I'm going to miss you.

379
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,160
Me too, Al.

380
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,160
No matter what anybody says.

381
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,160
You'll always be a prince to me.

382
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,160
You'll always be a prince to me.
