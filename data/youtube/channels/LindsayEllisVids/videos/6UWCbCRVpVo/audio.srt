1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Why is this hard?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
To lift.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Like...

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Physically.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
No, I think I have to undo this first.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Okay, and then...

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yay!

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I blame Lindsay for this.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, um...

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I... yeah.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is all her fault.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This came about a few months ago

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
when on Twitter one day I decided

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I was going to

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
write my own romance novel.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Only it was going to be...

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Since there was Twilight with everything.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And this is a really not surprising thing

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
in young adult literature right now.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The fact that there's

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
the next big thing, it's Twilight with witches.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And I saw several Twilight with angels.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Fallen angels.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
They're always fallen.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Twilight with fairies, right?

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Twilight with fairies.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm waiting for Twilight with Loch Ness Monsters.

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I definitely saw Twilight with werewolves.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Like, where the werewolves were the...

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The vampires?

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But the thing is, it's many

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
flavors of the same story

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
in different gimmicky

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
paranormal...

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah, so I feel like what we've

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
learned from this

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
explosion of romance novels

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and their popularity

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
is that you gotta

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
have a gimmick

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and we want in.

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yeah, we want in.

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So what is Fifty Shades of Green?

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We are crowdsourcing

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
the next worst

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
blockbuster paranormal romance novel

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and you're gonna help.

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I mean, we could probably do it without you, but what would be

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
the fun in that? Because if we've

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
gotta do this for the shits and giggles

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
of it, we wanna document it.

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We want to see what

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
it takes to write the next

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Twilight. And it doesn't have to be Twilight

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
with aliens.

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But I want it to be Twilight.

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I want it to be Twilight.

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I want Twilight with aliens, but if the crowd

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
wills it so and we find a better idea, then...

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But this is the point of

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
this. We want

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
to go on a journey of

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
self-discovery

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
in the Lovecraftian sense

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and we want you

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
to come with us and we want you to be

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
our guides. Journey to the

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
belly of the beast. This is absolutely going

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
to be a collaborative process.

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You, the viewer, gets to vote

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
on what we're doing and how

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
we're doing it. So I feel like this

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
is a good way for us to celebrate our love

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
of books by imitating

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
books that we hate.

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So how's this gonna work?

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The goal here is to actually

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
crowdsource with the help of

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
writers like

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
you

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
an actual book which we

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
will then actually shop around

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
to agents and actually get rejected

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and then

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
probably actually self-publish.

87
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But, you know, it's gonna be...

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So you can see the fruits of your labor.

89
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah, we're gonna see the fruits of our labor.

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The goal is not to make a deliberately

91
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
bad book. The goal is to make

92
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
a book that will sell

93
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
in a

94
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
bad way.

95
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
If that makes sense. That doesn't mean it can't

96
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
be funny, though. No. It can actually be

97
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
ridiculous and hilarious, but you have to

98
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
believe it. You have to believe

99
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
in the book itself.

100
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The badness will be organic.

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I feel like crowdsourcing is just as

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
viable a method of writing than, say,

103
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
publishing your fan fiction with

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
search-to-replace names.

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
For the next few weeks, we're going to

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
talk about different topics

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
within the

108
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
romance genre that has

109
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
taken over the world.

110
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And these books that are so inexplicably

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
popular. We'll definitely be discussing

112
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
things like why the characters

113
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
are as they are. Plot. What plot?

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Genre. Life begins at man.

115
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Life begins at man.

116
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Mousy, woefully

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
pale. Thin me.

118
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Woefully skinny me.

119
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
My porcelain

120
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
skin makes me strange

121
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
to others.

122
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You can really divvy this process up into

123
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
three parts. Part one is the discussion.

124
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Part two is the actual writing. And then part three

125
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
is going to be the road to

126
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
what is probably going to be self-publication.

127
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But it's the

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
journey that is important.

129
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We'll definitely be trying

130
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
to sell this.

131
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So we're going to start on this next week

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
where we are going to

133
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
talk about genre. We're going to make

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
some decisions.

135
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What is our gimmick? What is our genre?

136
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And

137
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
that's where you'll come in.

138
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
We're going to have all sorts of

139
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
experimental ways for people to interact.

140
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's called Twitter.

141
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's experimental.

142
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The tweet.

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So you can of course leave comments

144
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
on our website at

145
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
ChezApocalypse.com and on our Blip page,

146
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
50 Shades of Green. You can also tweet

147
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
at us at ChezApocalypse or if you want to

148
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
find my old Twitter that I will probably

149
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
revive for this project.

150
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Sexy Alien Book.

151
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Which is exactly

152
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
what it sounds like.

153
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And we will start making our

154
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
decisions.

155
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And we will make

156
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
a terrible awesome

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
or awesomely terrible project.

158
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And remember, the road to madness

159
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
is only fun when you bring a friend

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
down with you. And alcohol.

161
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And alcohol.

162
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Or weed.
