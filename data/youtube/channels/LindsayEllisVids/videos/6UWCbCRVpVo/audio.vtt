WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Okay.

00:02.000 --> 00:06.000
Why is this hard?

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
To lift.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Like...

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Physically.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
No, I think I have to undo this first.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Okay, and then...

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Yay!

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
I blame Lindsay for this.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Well, um...

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
I... yeah.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
This is all her fault.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
This came about a few months ago

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
when on Twitter one day I decided

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
I was going to

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
write my own romance novel.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Only it was going to be...

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Since there was Twilight with everything.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
And this is a really not surprising thing

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
in young adult literature right now.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
The fact that there's

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
the next big thing, it's Twilight with witches.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
And I saw several Twilight with angels.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Fallen angels.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
They're always fallen.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Twilight with fairies, right?

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Twilight with fairies.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm waiting for Twilight with Loch Ness Monsters.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I definitely saw Twilight with werewolves.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Like, where the werewolves were the...

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
The vampires?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
But the thing is, it's many

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
flavors of the same story

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
in different gimmicky

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
paranormal...

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Yeah, so I feel like what we've

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
learned from this

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
explosion of romance novels

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
and their popularity

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
is that you gotta

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
have a gimmick

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
and we want in.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Yeah, we want in.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
So what is Fifty Shades of Green?

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
We are crowdsourcing

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
the next worst

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
blockbuster paranormal romance novel

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
and you're gonna help.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
I mean, we could probably do it without you, but what would be

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
the fun in that? Because if we've

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
gotta do this for the shits and giggles

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
of it, we wanna document it.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
We want to see what

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
it takes to write the next

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Twilight. And it doesn't have to be Twilight

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
with aliens.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
But I want it to be Twilight.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
I want it to be Twilight.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
I want Twilight with aliens, but if the crowd

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
wills it so and we find a better idea, then...

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
But this is the point of

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
this. We want

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
to go on a journey of

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
self-discovery

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
in the Lovecraftian sense

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
and we want you

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
to come with us and we want you to be

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
our guides. Journey to the

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
belly of the beast. This is absolutely going

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
to be a collaborative process.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
You, the viewer, gets to vote

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
on what we're doing and how

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
we're doing it. So I feel like this

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
is a good way for us to celebrate our love

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
of books by imitating

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
books that we hate.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
So how's this gonna work?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
The goal here is to actually

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
crowdsource with the help of

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
writers like

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
you

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
an actual book which we

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
will then actually shop around

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
to agents and actually get rejected

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
and then

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
probably actually self-publish.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
But, you know, it's gonna be...

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
So you can see the fruits of your labor.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Yeah, we're gonna see the fruits of our labor.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
The goal is not to make a deliberately

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
bad book. The goal is to make

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
a book that will sell

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
in a

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
bad way.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
If that makes sense. That doesn't mean it can't

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
be funny, though. No. It can actually be

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
ridiculous and hilarious, but you have to

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
believe it. You have to believe

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
in the book itself.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
The badness will be organic.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
I feel like crowdsourcing is just as

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
viable a method of writing than, say,

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
publishing your fan fiction with

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
search-to-replace names.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
For the next few weeks, we're going to

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
talk about different topics

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
within the

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
romance genre that has

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
taken over the world.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
And these books that are so inexplicably

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
popular. We'll definitely be discussing

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
things like why the characters

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
are as they are. Plot. What plot?

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Genre. Life begins at man.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Life begins at man.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Mousy, woefully

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
pale. Thin me.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Woefully skinny me.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
My porcelain

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
skin makes me strange

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
to others.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
You can really divvy this process up into

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
three parts. Part one is the discussion.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Part two is the actual writing. And then part three

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
is going to be the road to

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
what is probably going to be self-publication.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
But it's the

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
journey that is important.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
We'll definitely be trying

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
to sell this.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
So we're going to start on this next week

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
where we are going to

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
talk about genre. We're going to make

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
some decisions.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
What is our gimmick? What is our genre?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
And

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
that's where you'll come in.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
We're going to have all sorts of

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
experimental ways for people to interact.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
It's called Twitter.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
It's experimental.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
The tweet.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
So you can of course leave comments

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
on our website at

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
ChezApocalypse.com and on our Blip page,

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
50 Shades of Green. You can also tweet

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
at us at ChezApocalypse or if you want to

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
find my old Twitter that I will probably

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
revive for this project.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Sexy Alien Book.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Which is exactly

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
what it sounds like.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
And we will start making our

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
decisions.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
And we will make

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
a terrible awesome

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
or awesomely terrible project.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
And remember, the road to madness

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
is only fun when you bring a friend

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
down with you. And alcohol.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
And alcohol.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Or weed.
