0	2000	Okay.
2000	6000	Why is this hard?
6000	8000	To lift.
8000	10000	Like...
10000	12000	Physically.
12000	14000	No, I think I have to undo this first.
14000	16000	Okay, and then...
16000	18000	Yay!
22000	24000	I blame Lindsay for this.
24000	26000	Well, um...
26000	28000	I... yeah.
28000	30000	This is all her fault.
30000	32000	This came about a few months ago
32000	34000	when on Twitter one day I decided
34000	36000	I was going to
36000	38000	write my own romance novel.
38000	40000	Only it was going to be...
40000	42000	Since there was Twilight with everything.
42000	44000	And this is a really not surprising thing
44000	46000	in young adult literature right now.
46000	48000	The fact that there's
48000	50000	the next big thing, it's Twilight with witches.
50000	52000	And I saw several Twilight with angels.
52000	54000	Fallen angels.
54000	56000	They're always fallen.
56000	58000	Twilight with fairies, right?
58000	60000	Twilight with fairies.
60000	62000	I'm waiting for Twilight with Loch Ness Monsters.
62000	64000	I definitely saw Twilight with werewolves.
64000	66000	Like, where the werewolves were the...
66000	68000	The vampires?
68000	70000	But the thing is, it's many
70000	72000	flavors of the same story
72000	74000	in different gimmicky
74000	76000	paranormal...
76000	78000	Yeah, so I feel like what we've
78000	80000	learned from this
80000	82000	explosion of romance novels
82000	84000	and their popularity
84000	86000	is that you gotta
86000	88000	have a gimmick
88000	90000	and we want in.
90000	92000	Yeah, we want in.
94000	96000	So what is Fifty Shades of Green?
96000	98000	We are crowdsourcing
98000	100000	the next worst
100000	102000	blockbuster paranormal romance novel
102000	104000	and you're gonna help.
104000	106000	I mean, we could probably do it without you, but what would be
106000	108000	the fun in that? Because if we've
108000	110000	gotta do this for the shits and giggles
110000	112000	of it, we wanna document it.
112000	114000	We want to see what
114000	116000	it takes to write the next
116000	118000	Twilight. And it doesn't have to be Twilight
118000	120000	with aliens.
120000	122000	But I want it to be Twilight.
122000	124000	I want it to be Twilight.
124000	126000	I want Twilight with aliens, but if the crowd
126000	128000	wills it so and we find a better idea, then...
128000	130000	But this is the point of
130000	132000	this. We want
132000	134000	to go on a journey of
134000	136000	self-discovery
136000	138000	in the Lovecraftian sense
138000	140000	and we want you
140000	142000	to come with us and we want you to be
142000	144000	our guides. Journey to the
144000	146000	belly of the beast. This is absolutely going
146000	148000	to be a collaborative process.
148000	150000	You, the viewer, gets to vote
150000	152000	on what we're doing and how
152000	154000	we're doing it. So I feel like this
154000	156000	is a good way for us to celebrate our love
156000	158000	of books by imitating
158000	160000	books that we hate.
162000	164000	So how's this gonna work?
164000	166000	The goal here is to actually
166000	168000	crowdsource with the help of
168000	170000	writers like
170000	172000	you
172000	174000	an actual book which we
174000	176000	will then actually shop around
176000	178000	to agents and actually get rejected
178000	180000	and then
180000	182000	probably actually self-publish.
182000	184000	But, you know, it's gonna be...
184000	186000	So you can see the fruits of your labor.
186000	188000	Yeah, we're gonna see the fruits of our labor.
188000	190000	The goal is not to make a deliberately
190000	192000	bad book. The goal is to make
192000	194000	a book that will sell
194000	196000	in a
196000	198000	bad way.
198000	200000	If that makes sense. That doesn't mean it can't
200000	202000	be funny, though. No. It can actually be
202000	204000	ridiculous and hilarious, but you have to
204000	206000	believe it. You have to believe
206000	208000	in the book itself.
208000	210000	The badness will be organic.
210000	212000	I feel like crowdsourcing is just as
212000	214000	viable a method of writing than, say,
214000	216000	publishing your fan fiction with
216000	218000	search-to-replace names.
222000	224000	For the next few weeks, we're going to
224000	226000	talk about different topics
226000	228000	within the
228000	230000	romance genre that has
230000	232000	taken over the world.
232000	234000	And these books that are so inexplicably
234000	236000	popular. We'll definitely be discussing
236000	238000	things like why the characters
238000	240000	are as they are. Plot. What plot?
242000	244000	Genre. Life begins at man.
244000	246000	Life begins at man.
246000	248000	Mousy, woefully
248000	250000	pale. Thin me.
250000	252000	Woefully skinny me.
252000	254000	My porcelain
254000	256000	skin makes me strange
256000	258000	to others.
258000	260000	You can really divvy this process up into
260000	262000	three parts. Part one is the discussion.
262000	264000	Part two is the actual writing. And then part three
264000	266000	is going to be the road to
266000	268000	what is probably going to be self-publication.
268000	270000	But it's the
270000	272000	journey that is important.
272000	274000	We'll definitely be trying
274000	276000	to sell this.
276000	278000	So we're going to start on this next week
278000	280000	where we are going to
280000	282000	talk about genre. We're going to make
282000	284000	some decisions.
284000	286000	What is our gimmick? What is our genre?
286000	288000	And
288000	290000	that's where you'll come in.
290000	292000	We're going to have all sorts of
292000	294000	experimental ways for people to interact.
294000	296000	It's called Twitter.
296000	298000	It's experimental.
298000	300000	The tweet.
300000	302000	So you can of course leave comments
302000	304000	on our website at
304000	306000	ChezApocalypse.com and on our Blip page,
306000	308000	50 Shades of Green. You can also tweet
308000	310000	at us at ChezApocalypse or if you want to
310000	312000	find my old Twitter that I will probably
312000	314000	revive for this project.
314000	316000	Sexy Alien Book.
316000	318000	Which is exactly
318000	320000	what it sounds like.
320000	322000	And we will start making our
322000	324000	decisions.
324000	326000	And we will make
326000	328000	a terrible awesome
328000	330000	or awesomely terrible project.
330000	332000	And remember, the road to madness
332000	334000	is only fun when you bring a friend
334000	336000	down with you. And alcohol.
336000	338000	And alcohol.
338000	340000	Or weed.
