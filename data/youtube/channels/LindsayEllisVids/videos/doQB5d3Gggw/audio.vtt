00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
So if you follow me on Twitter, then you know that when I'm not being cranky, or angry, or sad at the state of the world,

00:09.000 --> 00:16.000
or ceaselessly disappointed in James Woods, or cranky...

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
You know, I really did love Moana.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
There's no need to pray, it's okay, you're welcome.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Moana was probably my favorite movie to come out of Disney Animation Studios since the 90s.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
It was, you know, simple movie, buddy comedy, but, you know, tight, and well done, and I loved it.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
And you know what else I love? Disney villains.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
You know, that thing Moana didn't really have?

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Well, Terminator hasn't always been this glam.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
I mean, it kinda did, but not in that, like, classic Disney villain kinda way.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
Thinking you could defeat me? Me! The mistress of all evil!

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
Disney villains are probably my favorite aspect to all of Disney animated canon.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
And I'm not alone. Disney has noticed this.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
I went to Disney World last year, and probably my favorite thing I did was this new thing called Club Villain,

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
and it was great, it was hosted by Dr. Facilier, and we got to chill and hang out with all these classic villains,

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
and they brought out their A-team, as far as the villains were concerned.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Only complaint is that it wasn't long enough.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
Unfortunately, just gone and left most of my villain merchandise in a different state.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
I have a bunch of pins, though.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
Like, yes, I have fallen down the deep, deep well of Disney pin trading.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
And yes, the vast majority of my pins are villain pins.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
This one was Halloween 2016.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
It's one of my favorites because it was an exclusive to Disney Visa card holders,

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
and I had just gotten one, and I was like, well, I have to.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
It's an exclusive.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
There's Maleficent.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Yzma.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Kronk.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Gaston.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
This one is one of my absolute favorites.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Here is Radigan coveting an ice cream sundae.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
I try to grab Hades whenever I can.

01:53.000 --> 02:00.000
And Hades is actually the only Disney villain who is voiced by an actual heartless person.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
This one's another one of my favorites because they're such ex-boyfriends.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
More of the bitter ex-boyfriends.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.000
Villains are a branded thing in the same way that princesses are a branded thing, and fuck yes.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Only thing is, they're making new princesses.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
They aren't really making new villains.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
I mean, considering the ones that we've gotten the last five years,

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
would we add to the ranks of, you know, the Evil Queen and Maleficent,

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
the likes of Hans or, you know, Assistant Mayor Bellweather,

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
or even Toma Toa, who I think is the closest we've seen to a classic Disney villain in a while,

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
but, you know, he's only in the movie for like five minutes.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
The thing about Disney villains and movie villains in general,

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
as opposed to, say, real world villains, is that we like Disney villains.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
That's kind of the point.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Disney villains are fun.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
They're designed to hold your attention, to keep you engaged,

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
but they aren't designed to be repulsive.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Like, sure, they're bad, and maybe they want to own this lady,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
but, hey, at least they gave her a choice in the matter.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Choose me or the fire.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Or maybe they kill the brother, but, you know, they're not that bad.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
They wouldn't kill a kid.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
They'd outsource that.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
You know, they let the hyenas do it.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Kill him.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Or the crocodiles do it.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Or their, well-meaning, lunkhead assistant do it.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Or, okay, maybe they do kill a kid.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
But it's only implied and offscreen, and, hey, it was war, China.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
The little girl will be missing her doll.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Really, the worst we've seen from the Disney villain

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
is that time that Dr. Facilier squished Jim Cummings' fly.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Oh, movie.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
You wanted this to be such a moment.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Disney villains are getting a bit of a makeover.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Here's an entire spinoff dedicated to the complex in our lives

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
of the children of Disney villains.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Shere Khan has this tragic backstory.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
Maleficent is no longer a one-dimensional, spiteful mistress of all evil,

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
but a misunderstood justice fairy who's the victim of a rape allegory.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Ah!

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
And Beauty and the Beast isn't out yet,

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
but I think we can probably safely assume

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
that Gaston isn't going to get much of a makeover or a tragic backstory.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
But even then, Gaston is more of a villain in the vein of Hans

04:02.000 --> 04:09.000
than the likes of, say, Ursula or the Evil Queen or George C. Scott.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
And despite being a total villain, Stan,

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
or hell, maybe even because of it, I actually like Maleficent.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Like, yes, it was hot garbage, but, you know, it was my hot garbage.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Point is, I'm not opposed to this trend.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
You know, that's all it really is.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
It's a trend.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
You know, black and white villains are out,

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
and dimensionality and tragic backstories are in.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
But what I've noticed is that

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
we don't really see the clear-coded, brandable villain anymore

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
so much as plot twists.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
When it comes to nostalgia,

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Disney will always have their catalog to fall back on,

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
just like it always trots out its older films.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
But what about going forward?

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Are Disney villains going extinct?

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
So classic Disney movies, with some exceptions like Pinocchio and Alice in Wonderland,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
have a very simple story.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
A young princess, some sort of villain who hates her for some reason,

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
and then we meet a prince, and love conquers all the end.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
When Eisner and Katzenberg were hearing pitches from their animators in the mid-'80s,

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
part of the reason why they were more keen on The Little Mermaid

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
than Treasure Island in space...

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
besides the fact where it sounded kind of stupid.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Little Mermaid harkened back to the classic Disney staples

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
that were still huge draws to the theme parks.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
A beautiful princess, good versus evil, love conquers all.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
These were the elements that built the old Disney movies.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
But when Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
took charge of the company and studio respectively,

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
they added one crucial element that has superseded the original

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
and persists to this day,

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
and that is the search for identity.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.000
When will my reflection show

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
Who I am inside

05:51.000 --> 05:59.000
There's so much more to me

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
To find where I belong

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Give me one day out there

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
All I ask is one

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
This brought the basic conflict from external to internal.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Classic Disney protagonists, again with the exception of Pinocchio,

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
were pretty passive.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Things just kind of happened to them.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
And they weren't searching for anything at the outset

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
other than maybe their one true love,

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
and also, I guess not being a slave would be nice.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Renaissance Disney protagonists, on the other hand,

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
might have been looking for their one true love, sure,

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
but usually the true love thing was incidental,

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
and what they really wanted was a coming-of-age sense of identity.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
They wanted to figure out their place in the world.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
So how do Disney villains tie in?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Did your granny say listen to your heart

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Be who you are on the inside

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
I need three words to tear her argument apart

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Your granny lied

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Making a conflict about self-identity

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
rather than a simple battle of good versus evil

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
makes the story more complex.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
A one-dimensional villain can exist in a more complex story.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
Scar's manipulations work really well as a contrast

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
to Simba's insecurity in The Lion King,

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
but it can also hamper a story, too.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
Take the inclusion of Governor Ratcliffe in Pocahontas.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Easily the worst thing in an already not-that-great movie.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Let me see how I do it

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
See, we get this history of fear, violence, bigotry, and genocide.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Eh, let's just pin it on this one guy

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
who was easily disposed of.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Eh, this problem's solved.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
And Pocahontas never even meets the guy.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Just loading the last bit of cargo.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
A strong narrative ties its elements in neatly.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
The Lion King is a strong narrative with a flat villain

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
because the villain's motivation ties in directly

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
with the hero's internal conflict.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Same with Hunchback of Notre Dame,

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
only here the villain has a slightly more dimension.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Slightly.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Frollo felt a twinge of fear

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
for his immortal soul

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
What must I do?

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Quasimodo spends his entire life being gaslit by Frollo

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
into believing that he cannot survive in the outside world.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Villain's villainy directly ties in to heroes' internal conflict

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
as well as their external conflict.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Now, compare this to Hercules.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Hades applies to Hercules' external conflict

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
but not at all to his internal conflict.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Hades doesn't care about Hercules except as an obstacle,

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
foretold by prophecy.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Hercules doesn't even know that Hades exists.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
And Hades doesn't even meet Hercules until the end of the movie.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Like, they try to force this thing.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
Now you know how it feels to be just like everybody else.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Isn't it just peachy?

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
But it doesn't make sense that Hades cares at all

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
about Hercules wanting to find his place in the world

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
because they don't know each other.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
The villain is also one of the weakest elements

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
in The Princess and the Frog.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Dr. Facilier is motivated by greed

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
and has no connection to Tiana

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
except through her love interest, Prince Naveen.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
So this mandatory villain formula

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
that worked so well during the early Renaissance

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
and it became basically mandatory

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
by the time Pocahontas rolled around

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
started to make the movies feel stale

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
when it felt like we were just watching the same movie

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
over and over again.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
Because Disney villains are a brand unto themselves,

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
an element which can be decoupled from its property

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
and sold as its own entity.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
So up until Tangled, sometimes villains were just jammed in

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
because that's what you do.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
And once or twice we have a movie

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
where the villain is the best part of the movie

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
while also weakening the movie as a whole.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Hades is the best part of Hercules

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
but his evil plan is contrived and stupid.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Dr. Facilier is fun and he has a great villain song

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
but his motivation is weak

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
and his connection to the plot is tenuous.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Or Governor Ratcliffe. See, he's greedy.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
And he is the only greedy.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
But if you get rid of the greedy,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
then everyone gets along.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Colonialism solved.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
But in this newer era of Disney movies,

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
audiences respond to

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
more complex narratives

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
that are less about good versus evil

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
and more about

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
character development.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Look at The Great Mouse Detective,

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
which is a good little movie, but simple.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
The central conflict of The Great Mouse Detective

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
is Basil versus Radigan.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Good guy, bad guy.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
They know each other, they hate each other.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
We don't really know why. We don't need to know.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
The central conflict in Wreck-It Ralph is

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Ralph versus society's expectation

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
for his prescribed role

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
which he wants to break out of

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
in society.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
I mean, there's a character who's the embodiment of that,

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
but I don't remember his name either.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
This new era of Disney started with the success of Tangled

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
and with Tangled we got the last real Disney villain

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
and not a well-loved one at that.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Like sometimes I'll get a Mother Gothel in my pins

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
like in one of the villain pin bags

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
and you better believe she's the first thing that gets traded.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Wreck-It Ralph breaks away from the renaissance Disney mold

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
even further by not only having an older protagonist

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
but by actively subverting

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
these villain tropes.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Examining villainous motivations and creating a scenario

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
wherein, with the right incentive, the villain

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
becomes the hero. Big Hero 6 follows

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
a more Marvel mold than a Disney mold

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
with the villain now allowed to have a tragic backstory

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
with a family and everything.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
It is not automatically clear that this character will be the villain

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
when we meet him. But by that point

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
that was already a thing.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
And the whole thing culminates with

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Lord of All

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Frozen.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Frozen takes a page from Enchanted

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
and also subverts a lot of old Disney tropes

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
a major plot point being Anna's

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
eagerness to get married.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
In the earliest drafts, Elsa was the villain

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
but in one of the more brilliant branding moves

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
of all time, they decide

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
hey, let's make Elsa the heroine's sister

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
making a story about sisterhood

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
and reconnecting with family.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Hey, Thief Park Tyant, put your Disney World vacation

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
to the day. Reconnect with that family.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Yeah, I'll see you guys Labor Day weekend.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
As always, thanks for watching.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Yeah, I'll see you guys Labor Day weekend.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
And also we have a love interest that turns out to be the villain.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Hans is a bait and switch villain

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
that will also become a thing.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Similar to Gaston, yeah sort of, but look at how

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Gaston is introduced. His first action

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
in the movie is killing an animal

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
and he is introduced with his sinister

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
dominating visage in shadow.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
In Frozen, it isn't

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
until the end of Act 2 that

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
If only there was someone out there

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
who loved you.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Snap.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Zootopia does this too, and we see Disney

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
moving even further away from

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
the Disney villain formula as the story

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
in Conflict of Zootopia is almost entirely

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
between Judy and Nick. It's a buddy

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
cop movie where the villain really doesn't matter

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
and the villain ends up being like

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
an Alex Jones fever dream

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
false flag sheep.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Prey fears predator and you stay in power?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Yeah, pretty much.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
We've reached something of a culmination to the

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
bait and switch villain with the resolution to Moana

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
wherein the evil

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
lava monster we have to defeat at the end

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
it turns out is basically under an evil enchantment

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
after Maui stole the MacGuffin

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
from her. And I honestly think this

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
resolution works really well without

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
being predictable. Let her come to me.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
The resolution

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
to Moana is directly tied in

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
to Moana's quest to figure out who she

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
is. She spends the entire movie trying

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
to figure out why the ocean chose her for

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
this quest and the bait and switch bad guy

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
at the end directly ties into that.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Moana's compassion for the monster

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
makes her unique. So the two villains for

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
2016 were false flag sheep and

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
red herring lava monster. This also

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
ties in with a new but important marketing

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
move. The need for strong male and

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
female leads. And the result

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
is that these movies just don't

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
really have room for Disney villains.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
But who knows what remains to be seen.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
In 2018 we're going to see a Jack and the Beanstalk

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
adaptation called

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Gigantic.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Disney we really need to have a sit down

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
about these titles because they're getting kind of silly.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
So you can't have Jack and the Beanstalk without a

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
giant and that should lay

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
the groundwork for a traditional

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Disney villain. Although I'm giving

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
this an 80-90% chance that it's

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
going to be some BFG

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
style. Like

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
the giant is misunderstood

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
and there's an entire

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
giant economy up there and then

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
there's a good giant and

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
it's going to be about overthrowing

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
the blood

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
of an Englishman based

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
economy or something.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Just saying, Disney's

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
been real big on the whole subversion thing

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
lately. Maybe a little

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
too big. You only

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
got so many trips to subvert,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
you're going to have to get back to just

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
making stories that aren't, you know,

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
meta. If you start

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
singing, I'm going to throw up.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
So now we're living in an age of

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
plots that are less predictable than

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
earlier Disney movies. So new Disney

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
movies are almost fighting

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
against the studio's past as

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
much as they are building on it. And

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
I kind of wonder how quickly

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
people are going to get tired

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
of this the same way they got tired of

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
the villain versus coming of age teenager

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
narrative as they did in the 90s.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I mean, look at how quickly

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
people got sick of M. Night Shyamalan

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
in the early 2000s doing more or less

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
the same thing. So

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
I guess Disney villains, you know,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
they'll continue to be a

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
brandable, associated

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
property. They aren't

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
necessarily going extinct,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
but they could be

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
an endangered species.
