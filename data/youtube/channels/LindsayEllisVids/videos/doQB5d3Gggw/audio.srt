1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So if you follow me on Twitter, then you know that when I'm not being cranky, or angry, or sad at the state of the world,

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
or ceaselessly disappointed in James Woods, or cranky...

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You know, I really did love Moana.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
There's no need to pray, it's okay, you're welcome.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Moana was probably my favorite movie to come out of Disney Animation Studios since the 90s.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It was, you know, simple movie, buddy comedy, but, you know, tight, and well done, and I loved it.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And you know what else I love? Disney villains.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You know, that thing Moana didn't really have?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, Terminator hasn't always been this glam.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I mean, it kinda did, but not in that, like, classic Disney villain kinda way.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Thinking you could defeat me? Me! The mistress of all evil!

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Disney villains are probably my favorite aspect to all of Disney animated canon.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And I'm not alone. Disney has noticed this.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I went to Disney World last year, and probably my favorite thing I did was this new thing called Club Villain,

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and it was great, it was hosted by Dr. Facilier, and we got to chill and hang out with all these classic villains,

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and they brought out their A-team, as far as the villains were concerned.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Only complaint is that it wasn't long enough.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Unfortunately, just gone and left most of my villain merchandise in a different state.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I have a bunch of pins, though.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Like, yes, I have fallen down the deep, deep well of Disney pin trading.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And yes, the vast majority of my pins are villain pins.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
This one was Halloween 2016.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's one of my favorites because it was an exclusive to Disney Visa card holders,

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and I had just gotten one, and I was like, well, I have to.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's an exclusive.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
There's Maleficent.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yzma.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Kronk.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Gaston.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This one is one of my absolute favorites.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Here is Radigan coveting an ice cream sundae.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I try to grab Hades whenever I can.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And Hades is actually the only Disney villain who is voiced by an actual heartless person.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This one's another one of my favorites because they're such ex-boyfriends.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
More of the bitter ex-boyfriends.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Villains are a branded thing in the same way that princesses are a branded thing, and fuck yes.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Only thing is, they're making new princesses.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
They aren't really making new villains.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I mean, considering the ones that we've gotten the last five years,

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
would we add to the ranks of, you know, the Evil Queen and Maleficent,

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
the likes of Hans or, you know, Assistant Mayor Bellweather,

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
or even Toma Toa, who I think is the closest we've seen to a classic Disney villain in a while,

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
but, you know, he's only in the movie for like five minutes.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The thing about Disney villains and movie villains in general,

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
as opposed to, say, real world villains, is that we like Disney villains.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's kind of the point.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Disney villains are fun.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
They're designed to hold your attention, to keep you engaged,

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
but they aren't designed to be repulsive.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Like, sure, they're bad, and maybe they want to own this lady,

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
but, hey, at least they gave her a choice in the matter.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Choose me or the fire.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Or maybe they kill the brother, but, you know, they're not that bad.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
They wouldn't kill a kid.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
They'd outsource that.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You know, they let the hyenas do it.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Kill him.

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Or the crocodiles do it.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Or their, well-meaning, lunkhead assistant do it.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Or, okay, maybe they do kill a kid.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But it's only implied and offscreen, and, hey, it was war, China.

62
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The little girl will be missing her doll.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Really, the worst we've seen from the Disney villain

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
is that time that Dr. Facilier squished Jim Cummings' fly.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Oh, movie.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You wanted this to be such a moment.

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Disney villains are getting a bit of a makeover.

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Here's an entire spinoff dedicated to the complex in our lives

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
of the children of Disney villains.

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Shere Khan has this tragic backstory.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Maleficent is no longer a one-dimensional, spiteful mistress of all evil,

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
but a misunderstood justice fairy who's the victim of a rape allegory.

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Ah!

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And Beauty and the Beast isn't out yet,

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
but I think we can probably safely assume

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
that Gaston isn't going to get much of a makeover or a tragic backstory.

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But even then, Gaston is more of a villain in the vein of Hans

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
than the likes of, say, Ursula or the Evil Queen or George C. Scott.

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And despite being a total villain, Stan,

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
or hell, maybe even because of it, I actually like Maleficent.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Like, yes, it was hot garbage, but, you know, it was my hot garbage.

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Point is, I'm not opposed to this trend.

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You know, that's all it really is.

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's a trend.

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You know, black and white villains are out,

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and dimensionality and tragic backstories are in.

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But what I've noticed is that

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
we don't really see the clear-coded, brandable villain anymore

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
so much as plot twists.

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
When it comes to nostalgia,

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Disney will always have their catalog to fall back on,

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
just like it always trots out its older films.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But what about going forward?

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Are Disney villains going extinct?

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So classic Disney movies, with some exceptions like Pinocchio and Alice in Wonderland,

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
have a very simple story.

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
A young princess, some sort of villain who hates her for some reason,

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and then we meet a prince, and love conquers all the end.

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
When Eisner and Katzenberg were hearing pitches from their animators in the mid-'80s,

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
part of the reason why they were more keen on The Little Mermaid

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
than Treasure Island in space...

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
besides the fact where it sounded kind of stupid.

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Little Mermaid harkened back to the classic Disney staples

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
that were still huge draws to the theme parks.

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
A beautiful princess, good versus evil, love conquers all.

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
These were the elements that built the old Disney movies.

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But when Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
took charge of the company and studio respectively,

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
they added one crucial element that has superseded the original

110
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and persists to this day,

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and that is the search for identity.

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
When will my reflection show

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Who I am inside

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
There's so much more to me

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
To find where I belong

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Give me one day out there

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
All I ask is one

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This brought the basic conflict from external to internal.

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Classic Disney protagonists, again with the exception of Pinocchio,

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
were pretty passive.

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Things just kind of happened to them.

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And they weren't searching for anything at the outset

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
other than maybe their one true love,

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and also, I guess not being a slave would be nice.

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Renaissance Disney protagonists, on the other hand,

126
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
might have been looking for their one true love, sure,

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
but usually the true love thing was incidental,

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and what they really wanted was a coming-of-age sense of identity.

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
They wanted to figure out their place in the world.

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So how do Disney villains tie in?

131
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Did your granny say listen to your heart

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Be who you are on the inside

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I need three words to tear her argument apart

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Your granny lied

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Making a conflict about self-identity

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
rather than a simple battle of good versus evil

137
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
makes the story more complex.

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
A one-dimensional villain can exist in a more complex story.

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Scar's manipulations work really well as a contrast

140
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
to Simba's insecurity in The Lion King,

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
but it can also hamper a story, too.

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Take the inclusion of Governor Ratcliffe in Pocahontas.

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Easily the worst thing in an already not-that-great movie.

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Let me see how I do it

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
See, we get this history of fear, violence, bigotry, and genocide.

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Eh, let's just pin it on this one guy

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
who was easily disposed of.

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Eh, this problem's solved.

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And Pocahontas never even meets the guy.

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Just loading the last bit of cargo.

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
A strong narrative ties its elements in neatly.

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The Lion King is a strong narrative with a flat villain

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
because the villain's motivation ties in directly

154
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
with the hero's internal conflict.

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Same with Hunchback of Notre Dame,

156
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
only here the villain has a slightly more dimension.

157
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Slightly.

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Frollo felt a twinge of fear

159
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
for his immortal soul

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What must I do?

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Quasimodo spends his entire life being gaslit by Frollo

162
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
into believing that he cannot survive in the outside world.

163
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Villain's villainy directly ties in to heroes' internal conflict

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
as well as their external conflict.

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Now, compare this to Hercules.

166
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Hades applies to Hercules' external conflict

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
but not at all to his internal conflict.

168
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Hades doesn't care about Hercules except as an obstacle,

169
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
foretold by prophecy.

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Hercules doesn't even know that Hades exists.

171
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And Hades doesn't even meet Hercules until the end of the movie.

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Like, they try to force this thing.

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Now you know how it feels to be just like everybody else.

174
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Isn't it just peachy?

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But it doesn't make sense that Hades cares at all

176
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
about Hercules wanting to find his place in the world

177
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
because they don't know each other.

178
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The villain is also one of the weakest elements

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
in The Princess and the Frog.

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Dr. Facilier is motivated by greed

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
and has no connection to Tiana

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
except through her love interest, Prince Naveen.

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So this mandatory villain formula

184
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
that worked so well during the early Renaissance

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and it became basically mandatory

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
by the time Pocahontas rolled around

187
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
started to make the movies feel stale

188
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
when it felt like we were just watching the same movie

189
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
over and over again.

190
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Because Disney villains are a brand unto themselves,

191
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
an element which can be decoupled from its property

192
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and sold as its own entity.

193
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So up until Tangled, sometimes villains were just jammed in

194
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
because that's what you do.

195
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And once or twice we have a movie

196
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
where the villain is the best part of the movie

197
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
while also weakening the movie as a whole.

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Hades is the best part of Hercules

199
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
but his evil plan is contrived and stupid.

200
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Dr. Facilier is fun and he has a great villain song

201
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
but his motivation is weak

202
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
and his connection to the plot is tenuous.

203
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Or Governor Ratcliffe. See, he's greedy.

204
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And he is the only greedy.

205
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But if you get rid of the greedy,

206
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
then everyone gets along.

207
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Colonialism solved.

208
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But in this newer era of Disney movies,

209
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
audiences respond to

210
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
more complex narratives

211
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
that are less about good versus evil

212
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and more about

213
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
character development.

214
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Look at The Great Mouse Detective,

215
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
which is a good little movie, but simple.

216
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The central conflict of The Great Mouse Detective

217
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
is Basil versus Radigan.

218
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Good guy, bad guy.

219
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
They know each other, they hate each other.

220
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We don't really know why. We don't need to know.

221
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The central conflict in Wreck-It Ralph is

222
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Ralph versus society's expectation

223
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
for his prescribed role

224
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
which he wants to break out of

225
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
in society.

226
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I mean, there's a character who's the embodiment of that,

227
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
but I don't remember his name either.

228
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
This new era of Disney started with the success of Tangled

229
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
and with Tangled we got the last real Disney villain

230
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and not a well-loved one at that.

231
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Like sometimes I'll get a Mother Gothel in my pins

232
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
like in one of the villain pin bags

233
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
and you better believe she's the first thing that gets traded.

234
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Wreck-It Ralph breaks away from the renaissance Disney mold

235
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
even further by not only having an older protagonist

236
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
but by actively subverting

237
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
these villain tropes.

238
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Examining villainous motivations and creating a scenario

239
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
wherein, with the right incentive, the villain

240
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
becomes the hero. Big Hero 6 follows

241
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
a more Marvel mold than a Disney mold

242
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
with the villain now allowed to have a tragic backstory

243
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
with a family and everything.

244
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It is not automatically clear that this character will be the villain

245
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
when we meet him. But by that point

246
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
that was already a thing.

247
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And the whole thing culminates with

248
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Lord of All

249
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Frozen.

250
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Frozen takes a page from Enchanted

251
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
and also subverts a lot of old Disney tropes

252
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
a major plot point being Anna's

253
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
eagerness to get married.

254
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
In the earliest drafts, Elsa was the villain

255
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
but in one of the more brilliant branding moves

256
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
of all time, they decide

257
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
hey, let's make Elsa the heroine's sister

258
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
making a story about sisterhood

259
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and reconnecting with family.

260
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Hey, Thief Park Tyant, put your Disney World vacation

261
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
to the day. Reconnect with that family.

262
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yeah, I'll see you guys Labor Day weekend.

263
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
As always, thanks for watching.

264
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah, I'll see you guys Labor Day weekend.

265
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And also we have a love interest that turns out to be the villain.

266
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Hans is a bait and switch villain

267
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
that will also become a thing.

268
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Similar to Gaston, yeah sort of, but look at how

269
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Gaston is introduced. His first action

270
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
in the movie is killing an animal

271
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
and he is introduced with his sinister

272
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
dominating visage in shadow.

273
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
In Frozen, it isn't

274
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
until the end of Act 2 that

275
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
If only there was someone out there

276
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
who loved you.

277
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Snap.

278
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Zootopia does this too, and we see Disney

279
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
moving even further away from

280
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
the Disney villain formula as the story

281
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
in Conflict of Zootopia is almost entirely

282
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
between Judy and Nick. It's a buddy

283
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
cop movie where the villain really doesn't matter

284
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
and the villain ends up being like

285
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
an Alex Jones fever dream

286
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
false flag sheep.

287
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Prey fears predator and you stay in power?

288
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yeah, pretty much.

289
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
We've reached something of a culmination to the

290
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
bait and switch villain with the resolution to Moana

291
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
wherein the evil

292
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
lava monster we have to defeat at the end

293
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
it turns out is basically under an evil enchantment

294
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
after Maui stole the MacGuffin

295
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
from her. And I honestly think this

296
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
resolution works really well without

297
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
being predictable. Let her come to me.

298
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The resolution

299
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
to Moana is directly tied in

300
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
to Moana's quest to figure out who she

301
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
is. She spends the entire movie trying

302
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
to figure out why the ocean chose her for

303
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
this quest and the bait and switch bad guy

304
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
at the end directly ties into that.

305
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Moana's compassion for the monster

306
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
makes her unique. So the two villains for

307
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
2016 were false flag sheep and

308
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
red herring lava monster. This also

309
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
ties in with a new but important marketing

310
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
move. The need for strong male and

311
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
female leads. And the result

312
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
is that these movies just don't

313
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
really have room for Disney villains.

314
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But who knows what remains to be seen.

315
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
In 2018 we're going to see a Jack and the Beanstalk

316
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
adaptation called

317
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Gigantic.

318
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Disney we really need to have a sit down

319
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
about these titles because they're getting kind of silly.

320
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So you can't have Jack and the Beanstalk without a

321
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
giant and that should lay

322
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
the groundwork for a traditional

323
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Disney villain. Although I'm giving

324
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
this an 80-90% chance that it's

325
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
going to be some BFG

326
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
style. Like

327
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
the giant is misunderstood

328
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and there's an entire

329
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
giant economy up there and then

330
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
there's a good giant and

331
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
it's going to be about overthrowing

332
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
the blood

333
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
of an Englishman based

334
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
economy or something.

335
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Just saying, Disney's

336
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
been real big on the whole subversion thing

337
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
lately. Maybe a little

338
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
too big. You only

339
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
got so many trips to subvert,

340
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
you're going to have to get back to just

341
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
making stories that aren't, you know,

342
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
meta. If you start

343
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
singing, I'm going to throw up.

344
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So now we're living in an age of

345
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
plots that are less predictable than

346
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
earlier Disney movies. So new Disney

347
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
movies are almost fighting

348
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
against the studio's past as

349
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
much as they are building on it. And

350
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I kind of wonder how quickly

351
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
people are going to get tired

352
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
of this the same way they got tired of

353
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
the villain versus coming of age teenager

354
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
narrative as they did in the 90s.

355
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I mean, look at how quickly

356
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
people got sick of M. Night Shyamalan

357
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
in the early 2000s doing more or less

358
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
the same thing. So

359
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I guess Disney villains, you know,

360
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
they'll continue to be a

361
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
brandable, associated

362
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
property. They aren't

363
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
necessarily going extinct,

364
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
but they could be

365
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
an endangered species.
