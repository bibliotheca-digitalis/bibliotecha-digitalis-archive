0	9000	So if you follow me on Twitter, then you know that when I'm not being cranky, or angry, or sad at the state of the world,
9000	16000	or ceaselessly disappointed in James Woods, or cranky...
16000	19000	You know, I really did love Moana.
19000	23000	There's no need to pray, it's okay, you're welcome.
23000	27000	Moana was probably my favorite movie to come out of Disney Animation Studios since the 90s.
27000	32000	It was, you know, simple movie, buddy comedy, but, you know, tight, and well done, and I loved it.
32000	35000	And you know what else I love? Disney villains.
35000	38000	You know, that thing Moana didn't really have?
38000	42000	Well, Terminator hasn't always been this glam.
42000	46000	I mean, it kinda did, but not in that, like, classic Disney villain kinda way.
46000	52000	Thinking you could defeat me? Me! The mistress of all evil!
52000	56000	Disney villains are probably my favorite aspect to all of Disney animated canon.
56000	59000	And I'm not alone. Disney has noticed this.
59000	64000	I went to Disney World last year, and probably my favorite thing I did was this new thing called Club Villain,
64000	69000	and it was great, it was hosted by Dr. Facilier, and we got to chill and hang out with all these classic villains,
69000	72000	and they brought out their A-team, as far as the villains were concerned.
72000	74000	Only complaint is that it wasn't long enough.
74000	79000	Unfortunately, just gone and left most of my villain merchandise in a different state.
79000	80000	I have a bunch of pins, though.
80000	85000	Like, yes, I have fallen down the deep, deep well of Disney pin trading.
85000	89000	And yes, the vast majority of my pins are villain pins.
89000	91000	This one was Halloween 2016.
91000	95000	It's one of my favorites because it was an exclusive to Disney Visa card holders,
95000	98000	and I had just gotten one, and I was like, well, I have to.
99000	100000	It's an exclusive.
100000	101000	There's Maleficent.
101000	102000	Yzma.
102000	103000	Kronk.
103000	104000	Gaston.
104000	107000	This one is one of my absolute favorites.
107000	111000	Here is Radigan coveting an ice cream sundae.
111000	113000	I try to grab Hades whenever I can.
113000	120000	And Hades is actually the only Disney villain who is voiced by an actual heartless person.
120000	125000	This one's another one of my favorites because they're such ex-boyfriends.
125000	127000	More of the bitter ex-boyfriends.
127000	133000	Villains are a branded thing in the same way that princesses are a branded thing, and fuck yes.
133000	136000	Only thing is, they're making new princesses.
136000	138000	They aren't really making new villains.
138000	142000	I mean, considering the ones that we've gotten the last five years,
142000	146000	would we add to the ranks of, you know, the Evil Queen and Maleficent,
146000	152000	the likes of Hans or, you know, Assistant Mayor Bellweather,
152000	156000	or even Toma Toa, who I think is the closest we've seen to a classic Disney villain in a while,
156000	159000	but, you know, he's only in the movie for like five minutes.
159000	161000	The thing about Disney villains and movie villains in general,
161000	165000	as opposed to, say, real world villains, is that we like Disney villains.
165000	166000	That's kind of the point.
166000	167000	Disney villains are fun.
167000	170000	They're designed to hold your attention, to keep you engaged,
170000	172000	but they aren't designed to be repulsive.
172000	175000	Like, sure, they're bad, and maybe they want to own this lady,
175000	177000	but, hey, at least they gave her a choice in the matter.
177000	180000	Choose me or the fire.
180000	183000	Or maybe they kill the brother, but, you know, they're not that bad.
183000	184000	They wouldn't kill a kid.
184000	185000	They'd outsource that.
185000	187000	You know, they let the hyenas do it.
187000	188000	Kill him.
188000	189000	Or the crocodiles do it.
189000	192000	Or their, well-meaning, lunkhead assistant do it.
192000	194000	Or, okay, maybe they do kill a kid.
194000	197000	But it's only implied and offscreen, and, hey, it was war, China.
197000	200000	The little girl will be missing her doll.
200000	202000	Really, the worst we've seen from the Disney villain
202000	205000	is that time that Dr. Facilier squished Jim Cummings' fly.
205000	206000	Oh, movie.
206000	209000	You wanted this to be such a moment.
209000	211000	Disney villains are getting a bit of a makeover.
211000	214000	Here's an entire spinoff dedicated to the complex in our lives
214000	217000	of the children of Disney villains.
217000	219000	Shere Khan has this tragic backstory.
219000	223000	Maleficent is no longer a one-dimensional, spiteful mistress of all evil,
223000	227000	but a misunderstood justice fairy who's the victim of a rape allegory.
227000	229000	Ah!
229000	231000	And Beauty and the Beast isn't out yet,
231000	234000	but I think we can probably safely assume
234000	238000	that Gaston isn't going to get much of a makeover or a tragic backstory.
238000	242000	But even then, Gaston is more of a villain in the vein of Hans
242000	249000	than the likes of, say, Ursula or the Evil Queen or George C. Scott.
249000	251000	And despite being a total villain, Stan,
251000	254000	or hell, maybe even because of it, I actually like Maleficent.
254000	257000	Like, yes, it was hot garbage, but, you know, it was my hot garbage.
257000	259000	Point is, I'm not opposed to this trend.
259000	261000	You know, that's all it really is.
261000	262000	It's a trend.
262000	264000	You know, black and white villains are out,
264000	269000	and dimensionality and tragic backstories are in.
269000	271000	But what I've noticed is that
271000	275000	we don't really see the clear-coded, brandable villain anymore
275000	278000	so much as plot twists.
278000	279000	When it comes to nostalgia,
279000	281000	Disney will always have their catalog to fall back on,
281000	284000	just like it always trots out its older films.
284000	286000	But what about going forward?
286000	289000	Are Disney villains going extinct?
289000	293000	So classic Disney movies, with some exceptions like Pinocchio and Alice in Wonderland,
293000	295000	have a very simple story.
295000	299000	A young princess, some sort of villain who hates her for some reason,
299000	303000	and then we meet a prince, and love conquers all the end.
303000	307000	When Eisner and Katzenberg were hearing pitches from their animators in the mid-'80s,
307000	309000	part of the reason why they were more keen on The Little Mermaid
309000	313000	than Treasure Island in space...
313000	315000	besides the fact where it sounded kind of stupid.
315000	317000	Little Mermaid harkened back to the classic Disney staples
317000	319000	that were still huge draws to the theme parks.
319000	322000	A beautiful princess, good versus evil, love conquers all.
322000	325000	These were the elements that built the old Disney movies.
325000	327000	But when Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg
327000	329000	took charge of the company and studio respectively,
329000	334000	they added one crucial element that has superseded the original
334000	336000	and persists to this day,
336000	339000	and that is the search for identity.
339000	345000	When will my reflection show
345000	351000	Who I am inside
351000	359000	There's so much more to me
359000	364000	To find where I belong
364000	367000	Give me one day out there
367000	370000	All I ask is one
370000	374000	This brought the basic conflict from external to internal.
374000	377000	Classic Disney protagonists, again with the exception of Pinocchio,
377000	379000	were pretty passive.
379000	381000	Things just kind of happened to them.
381000	384000	And they weren't searching for anything at the outset
384000	386000	other than maybe their one true love,
386000	389000	and also, I guess not being a slave would be nice.
389000	391000	Renaissance Disney protagonists, on the other hand,
391000	393000	might have been looking for their one true love, sure,
393000	395000	but usually the true love thing was incidental,
395000	398000	and what they really wanted was a coming-of-age sense of identity.
398000	401000	They wanted to figure out their place in the world.
401000	404000	So how do Disney villains tie in?
404000	407000	Did your granny say listen to your heart
407000	410000	Be who you are on the inside
410000	413000	I need three words to tear her argument apart
413000	415000	Your granny lied
415000	417000	Making a conflict about self-identity
417000	419000	rather than a simple battle of good versus evil
419000	421000	makes the story more complex.
421000	424000	A one-dimensional villain can exist in a more complex story.
424000	427000	Scar's manipulations work really well as a contrast
427000	429000	to Simba's insecurity in The Lion King,
429000	431000	but it can also hamper a story, too.
431000	434000	Take the inclusion of Governor Ratcliffe in Pocahontas.
434000	437000	Easily the worst thing in an already not-that-great movie.
437000	439000	Let me see how I do it
439000	443000	See, we get this history of fear, violence, bigotry, and genocide.
443000	445000	Eh, let's just pin it on this one guy
445000	447000	who was easily disposed of.
447000	449000	Eh, this problem's solved.
449000	451000	And Pocahontas never even meets the guy.
451000	454000	Just loading the last bit of cargo.
456000	459000	A strong narrative ties its elements in neatly.
459000	461000	The Lion King is a strong narrative with a flat villain
461000	463000	because the villain's motivation ties in directly
463000	465000	with the hero's internal conflict.
465000	467000	Same with Hunchback of Notre Dame,
467000	470000	only here the villain has a slightly more dimension.
470000	471000	Slightly.
471000	474000	Frollo felt a twinge of fear
474000	477000	for his immortal soul
477000	478000	What must I do?
478000	481000	Quasimodo spends his entire life being gaslit by Frollo
481000	484000	into believing that he cannot survive in the outside world.
484000	487000	Villain's villainy directly ties in to heroes' internal conflict
487000	489000	as well as their external conflict.
489000	491000	Now, compare this to Hercules.
491000	493000	Hades applies to Hercules' external conflict
493000	496000	but not at all to his internal conflict.
496000	498000	Hades doesn't care about Hercules except as an obstacle,
498000	500000	foretold by prophecy.
500000	502000	Hercules doesn't even know that Hades exists.
502000	504000	And Hades doesn't even meet Hercules until the end of the movie.
504000	507000	Like, they try to force this thing.
507000	511000	Now you know how it feels to be just like everybody else.
511000	514000	Isn't it just peachy?
514000	517000	But it doesn't make sense that Hades cares at all
517000	520000	about Hercules wanting to find his place in the world
520000	521000	because they don't know each other.
521000	523000	The villain is also one of the weakest elements
523000	525000	in The Princess and the Frog.
525000	527000	Dr. Facilier is motivated by greed
527000	529000	and has no connection to Tiana
529000	531000	except through her love interest, Prince Naveen.
531000	533000	So this mandatory villain formula
533000	535000	that worked so well during the early Renaissance
535000	537000	and it became basically mandatory
537000	539000	by the time Pocahontas rolled around
539000	541000	started to make the movies feel stale
541000	543000	when it felt like we were just watching the same movie
543000	544000	over and over again.
544000	547000	Because Disney villains are a brand unto themselves,
547000	549000	an element which can be decoupled from its property
549000	551000	and sold as its own entity.
551000	553000	So up until Tangled, sometimes villains were just jammed in
553000	555000	because that's what you do.
555000	557000	And once or twice we have a movie
557000	559000	where the villain is the best part of the movie
559000	561000	while also weakening the movie as a whole.
561000	563000	Hades is the best part of Hercules
563000	565000	but his evil plan is contrived and stupid.
565000	567000	Dr. Facilier is fun and he has a great villain song
567000	569000	but his motivation is weak
569000	571000	and his connection to the plot is tenuous.
571000	573000	Or Governor Ratcliffe. See, he's greedy.
573000	575000	And he is the only greedy.
575000	577000	But if you get rid of the greedy,
577000	579000	then everyone gets along.
579000	581000	Colonialism solved.
581000	583000	But in this newer era of Disney movies,
583000	585000	audiences respond to
585000	589000	more complex narratives
589000	591000	that are less about good versus evil
591000	593000	and more about
593000	595000	character development.
595000	597000	Look at The Great Mouse Detective,
597000	599000	which is a good little movie, but simple.
599000	601000	The central conflict of The Great Mouse Detective
601000	603000	is Basil versus Radigan.
603000	605000	Good guy, bad guy.
605000	607000	They know each other, they hate each other.
607000	609000	We don't really know why. We don't need to know.
609000	611000	The central conflict in Wreck-It Ralph is
611000	613000	Ralph versus society's expectation
613000	617000	for his prescribed role
617000	619000	which he wants to break out of
619000	621000	in society.
621000	623000	I mean, there's a character who's the embodiment of that,
623000	625000	but I don't remember his name either.
625000	627000	This new era of Disney started with the success of Tangled
627000	629000	and with Tangled we got the last real Disney villain
629000	631000	and not a well-loved one at that.
631000	633000	Like sometimes I'll get a Mother Gothel in my pins
633000	635000	like in one of the villain pin bags
635000	637000	and you better believe she's the first thing that gets traded.
637000	639000	Wreck-It Ralph breaks away from the renaissance Disney mold
639000	641000	even further by not only having an older protagonist
641000	643000	but by actively subverting
643000	645000	these villain tropes.
645000	647000	Examining villainous motivations and creating a scenario
647000	649000	wherein, with the right incentive, the villain
649000	651000	becomes the hero. Big Hero 6 follows
651000	653000	a more Marvel mold than a Disney mold
653000	655000	with the villain now allowed to have a tragic backstory
655000	657000	with a family and everything.
657000	659000	It is not automatically clear that this character will be the villain
659000	661000	when we meet him. But by that point
661000	663000	that was already a thing.
663000	665000	And the whole thing culminates with
665000	667000	Lord of All
667000	669000	Frozen.
669000	671000	Frozen takes a page from Enchanted
671000	673000	and also subverts a lot of old Disney tropes
673000	675000	a major plot point being Anna's
675000	677000	eagerness to get married.
677000	679000	In the earliest drafts, Elsa was the villain
679000	681000	but in one of the more brilliant branding moves
681000	683000	of all time, they decide
683000	685000	hey, let's make Elsa the heroine's sister
685000	687000	making a story about sisterhood
687000	689000	and reconnecting with family.
689000	691000	Hey, Thief Park Tyant, put your Disney World vacation
691000	693000	to the day. Reconnect with that family.
693000	695000	Yeah, I'll see you guys Labor Day weekend.
695000	697000	As always, thanks for watching.
697000	699000	Yeah, I'll see you guys Labor Day weekend.
699000	701000	And also we have a love interest that turns out to be the villain.
701000	703000	Hans is a bait and switch villain
703000	705000	that will also become a thing.
705000	707000	Similar to Gaston, yeah sort of, but look at how
707000	709000	Gaston is introduced. His first action
709000	711000	in the movie is killing an animal
711000	713000	and he is introduced with his sinister
713000	715000	dominating visage in shadow.
715000	717000	In Frozen, it isn't
717000	719000	until the end of Act 2 that
719000	721000	If only there was someone out there
721000	723000	who loved you.
723000	725000	Snap.
725000	727000	Zootopia does this too, and we see Disney
727000	729000	moving even further away from
729000	731000	the Disney villain formula as the story
731000	733000	in Conflict of Zootopia is almost entirely
733000	735000	between Judy and Nick. It's a buddy
735000	737000	cop movie where the villain really doesn't matter
737000	739000	and the villain ends up being like
739000	741000	an Alex Jones fever dream
741000	743000	false flag sheep.
743000	745000	Prey fears predator and you stay in power?
745000	747000	Yeah, pretty much.
747000	749000	We've reached something of a culmination to the
749000	751000	bait and switch villain with the resolution to Moana
751000	753000	wherein the evil
753000	755000	lava monster we have to defeat at the end
755000	757000	it turns out is basically under an evil enchantment
757000	759000	after Maui stole the MacGuffin
759000	761000	from her. And I honestly think this
761000	763000	resolution works really well without
763000	765000	being predictable. Let her come to me.
765000	767000	The resolution
767000	769000	to Moana is directly tied in
769000	771000	to Moana's quest to figure out who she
771000	773000	is. She spends the entire movie trying
773000	775000	to figure out why the ocean chose her for
775000	777000	this quest and the bait and switch bad guy
777000	779000	at the end directly ties into that.
779000	781000	Moana's compassion for the monster
781000	783000	makes her unique. So the two villains for
783000	785000	2016 were false flag sheep and
785000	787000	red herring lava monster. This also
787000	789000	ties in with a new but important marketing
789000	791000	move. The need for strong male and
791000	793000	female leads. And the result
793000	795000	is that these movies just don't
795000	797000	really have room for Disney villains.
797000	799000	But who knows what remains to be seen.
799000	801000	In 2018 we're going to see a Jack and the Beanstalk
801000	803000	adaptation called
803000	805000	Gigantic.
805000	807000	Disney we really need to have a sit down
807000	809000	about these titles because they're getting kind of silly.
809000	811000	So you can't have Jack and the Beanstalk without a
811000	813000	giant and that should lay
813000	815000	the groundwork for a traditional
815000	817000	Disney villain. Although I'm giving
817000	819000	this an 80-90% chance that it's
819000	821000	going to be some BFG
821000	823000	style. Like
823000	825000	the giant is misunderstood
825000	827000	and there's an entire
827000	829000	giant economy up there and then
829000	831000	there's a good giant and
831000	833000	it's going to be about overthrowing
833000	835000	the blood
835000	837000	of an Englishman based
837000	839000	economy or something.
841000	843000	Just saying, Disney's
843000	845000	been real big on the whole subversion thing
845000	847000	lately. Maybe a little
847000	849000	too big. You only
849000	851000	got so many trips to subvert,
851000	853000	you're going to have to get back to just
853000	855000	making stories that aren't, you know,
855000	857000	meta. If you start
857000	859000	singing, I'm going to throw up.
859000	861000	So now we're living in an age of
861000	863000	plots that are less predictable than
863000	865000	earlier Disney movies. So new Disney
865000	867000	movies are almost fighting
867000	869000	against the studio's past as
869000	871000	much as they are building on it. And
871000	873000	I kind of wonder how quickly
873000	875000	people are going to get tired
875000	877000	of this the same way they got tired of
877000	879000	the villain versus coming of age teenager
879000	881000	narrative as they did in the 90s.
881000	883000	I mean, look at how quickly
883000	885000	people got sick of M. Night Shyamalan
885000	887000	in the early 2000s doing more or less
887000	889000	the same thing. So
889000	891000	I guess Disney villains, you know,
891000	893000	they'll continue to be a
893000	895000	brandable, associated
895000	897000	property. They aren't
897000	899000	necessarily going extinct,
899000	901000	but they could be
901000	903000	an endangered species.
