0	10520	That's good. I've never had this book. Good. Wow, that is good. Good luck with our t-shirts.
10520	16260	Wait, where is it? Writers Tears. Tears of Laughter. Yeah, because so many tears were
16260	23960	shed. Oh, I cried. So many tears were shed reading the books that led to this project.
23960	28560	Ours is awesome. I should know because I've read it eight times by now. Because you've
28560	34280	done most of the work on it. Yes, I homogenized. I took all eight of our writing and tried
34280	40520	to make it sound like Stephenie Meyer. And by Stephenie Meyer, I mean Sarah Ellenson.
40520	48560	Sarah Ellenson, yes, our author. So the way that I homogenized it mostly was looking for
48560	53640	repeated phrases that people were using for a protagonist's voice. For instance, I noticed
53640	61640	that Nella had her say, oh crap, a lot. Which is rather Fifty Shades. Well. So I went back
61640	67600	and added a lot of crap to the other chapters. Literally. I looked for places that needed
67600	71840	crap and I put that crap right in there. It wasn't as hard as I thought it was going to
71840	76560	be. It didn't take me two solid weeks of doing absolutely nothing. It was time consuming,
76560	82440	but otherwise not like mentally straining. It was enjoyable work. I don't know, I think
82440	86880	everyone has a worst thing, but I think for a lot of people's worst thing is the querying
86880	92960	process. Yes. Where you actually have to court industry professionals to like your product
92960	101640	and want you and your product and your ideas and that's terrible and awful and I hate it.
101640	109200	To do a query, there's a process to, you know, a standard formula that most people use is
109200	113800	you write a query letter, you look up agents that are interested in the kind of book you're
113800	118520	writing. So we would look for agents that are seeking young adult paranormal romance.
118520	122680	So basically no one in the world anymore. And if you're seeking that, then we would
122680	127400	read their submission guidelines, which will say either send us a letter and a summary
127400	132960	or a letter and a full manuscript or a first three chapters. But each agent is different.
132960	135800	You want to make sure you're sending the right thing if you want to make a good impression,
135800	142800	which I'm not sure we do. But Lisa, I'm Sarah Ellenson. I don't understand why I need an
142800	152640	agent. Doesn't my work speak for itself? Well, Sarah, publishers don't really do the slush
152640	158360	pile thing anymore. Mostly for copyright reasons, as I understand it. A slush pile is a giant
158360	163280	pile of bad writing. No, it's a giant pile of any writing. Yeah, it's mostly bad, but
163280	168040	that's just sturgeon's law. Anyone who sends in a thing they've written to someone who
168040	172280	they want to buy it, it ends up in the slush pile. So these people will get these submissions
172280	176960	and because there's so many of them, they call it the slush pile. And it's mostly bad,
176960	182200	but that's just sturgeon's law. Your stuff is probably brilliant. Your stuff is great.
182200	188560	But it will end up in the slush pile, just like our stuff, which is brilliant. Genius.
188560	196280	It's brilliant. You'll love it. So what does a query consist of? It's basically the back
196280	200840	of a book blurb. It doesn't even have to have a hi, how are you, but the most important
200840	206920	thing is the back of a book blurb. She was running from her past. This is the one sentence
206920	212280	right here. The one sentence hook, which says, I am intrigued. This interests me. And Hunger
212280	216720	Games is a good example because it's a good book. In the ruins of a place once known as
216720	226040	North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining capital surrounded by 12 outlying
226040	233060	districts. I already want to know more. Something's happened to North America. The first line
233060	237800	of your book is supposed to be a hook. The first line of your back of the book summary,
237800	242320	your query letter. If this was your query letter to an agent, you'd be on the right
242320	248460	track. Here's my favorite 50 shades of gray. And our first line here is when literature
248460	253920	student Anastasia Steele goes to interview young entrepreneur Christian Gray, she encounters
253920	261880	a man who is beautiful, brilliant, and intimidating. That sure is what happens. Who cares? That's
261880	269220	not getting my interest. I'm not like, I must know more. The world was. If you ask, go on.
269220	274700	It's not out of actual interest because no, really what happens then? And you're going
274700	281660	nowhere. Little did she know about the bodies in the basement. The only thing remotely interesting
281660	286100	about this is beautiful, brilliant, and intimidating. But how is that different from anything else?
286100	290500	How does that set this apart? It doesn't from bad to worse. Yeah. Okay. This, okay. I don't
290500	295060	actually physically have the copy of this cause we have the ebook version. This book
295060	304220	Tiger's Curse is literally the worst book I have ever read. It is the worst. Yeah. It's
304220	310140	the worst book that was actually professionally published by actually publishing the worst
310140	316460	book I've ever read. And here's the as per Goodreads blurb. And it's also the worst blurb
316460	330500	I've ever read. Oh God. Okay. Passion, fate, loyalty. Oh, well, okay. All right. That makes
330500	335900	me want to read this book. Notebooks have that. Yeah. Okay. All right. And then again,
335900	340120	it starts over. Like apparently that, okay. And then it's, would you risk it all to change
340120	344860	your destiny? Oh, well I'm just like, okay. You know, you read those like never do this
344860	348540	about queries. And I feel like that that's, that's not up there. It's like the, would
348540	354500	you rhetorical question. And then the only thing worse than that is the last thing Kelsey
354500	359240	Hayes thought she'd be doing this summer was trying to break a 300 year old Indian curse.
359240	365340	And it's like, okay, the last thing Lego brick thought that they'd be doing was going on
365340	370120	an epic adventure. Like that is the worst book. Oh God. And it just goes on from there.
370120	377320	It's terrible. It's, it's a terrible, terrible blurb for a terrible, terrible book. It's
377320	382320	really bad. There are other ways to go about it. For instance, Twilight takes a slightly
382320	387240	different approach and Twilight being, you know, the spark of all of these. Hold my whiskey
387240	393860	please. All right. It starts off. It has a quote on the back. A very famous quote about
393860	397840	three things. I was absolutely positive. First, Edward was a vampire. Second, there was a
397840	402360	part of him that didn't know how dominant that part might be. That thirsted for my blood.
402360	405520	It's intriguing. It's interesting. It's a quote straight out of the book. Didn't have
405520	409060	to put any extra thought in that. I mean, if we have a quote that's actually interesting
409060	414760	in our book, we can talk about it. Third. And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably
414760	419240	in love with him. I mean, it's got romance. It's got danger. It's got blood. This is much
419240	423440	better than the previous two. Yeah. Like, you know, I guess that's kind of all you need
423440	427400	to know. And then, you know, and bear in mind, these are not query letters. This was a professionally
427400	431920	published book. It was always professionally published, unlike Fifty Shades and Tiger's
431920	437960	Socks. Well, okay, there's also this one. All right. Ireland has been blessed with great
437960	442920	poets and playwrights down through the centuries. However, most, if not all, of our great writers
442920	448000	suffered from writer's block. That's pretty good. That's one book at a time. Many sought
448000	453600	comfort and inspiration from the water of life. Whiskey. That's not a book at all. It's
453600	460480	got a book blurb on it, though. Better than Tiger's. It's much better than the Tiger book.
460480	465280	It's also more delicious. Yeah, it's also, it's better in every possible way. You're
465280	471640	not paying us, we swear. Yeah, no. Writer's Tears, a delicious, quality Irish pot still
471640	476280	whiskey. Available only in Ireland. You don't know what hell I went through to get this,
476280	480100	by the way, that I could find a whiskey called Writer's Tears. Thank you. And bring it back
480100	484000	to New York. And bring it back to New York and write it off on my text. It says, I traded
484000	491220	my tomorrows to remain in yesterday. Whiskey tears are falling now. Each one cries another
491220	500220	day. Still better than Twilight. Still a better low story than Twilight. Me and my tears.
500220	507260	So our query letter, our back of the book blurb. Yeah, what is our hook? We can't say
507260	511280	Twilight with Cthulhu. Yeah, but I feel like that is the hook. Would you like to read a
511280	515260	paranormal teenage romance with Cthulhu? Yes, romance has to be in there. It has to be about
515260	520180	love. It has to be about her being the chosen one, being the only one prophecy that can
520180	525260	save the world. We should do the thing that the Tiger book does where it's like, you know,
525260	530260	would you? Terrible rhetorical question. Yeah. Well, we have to say something about a mysterious
530260	537180	beautiful boy who hates her at first. Yeah. And she's like, why does he hate me? I think
537180	542620	that's our book. That's what's going to get people to want to read this. Then we just
542620	548180	like sprinkle hints about like, you know, immortality and having the key to destroy.
548180	554460	Yeah. I think it needs to be like only she has the key to stopping him, but not in the
554460	558540	way he ever dreamed. And the word dream has to be in there. Of course. Yeah. Lots and
558540	561940	lots about dreaming. Yeah. And that might be the title of our book. Yeah. We're still
561940	565460	working on that. We're still trying to figure out the title. Yeah. Give us titles. Yeah.
565460	571900	Right now the best one we've got so far is dream colors. I'm really not kidding. There's
571900	577500	dreams and there's calls. It's a little weak. Yeah. Too bad we can't go like, I mean, Stephanie
577500	588620	Meyers wanted to name it Forks. Forks, which forking sucks. So now we're up to the serious
588620	592780	business point. We're actually having to figure out where to send this and how to send it.
592780	600340	So, since everyone is now in on the joke and we start having our Facebook page, which
600340	607660	you can, you can like our author here. And the photos are, we paid for the photos. They're
607660	612260	licensed stock images of a lady. Just so you know, like it was that lady, like she's a
612260	619540	professional model and we paid for them. Yeah. Now is the point where, you know, you're in
619540	626740	on the joke, play it straight. You're in on this solemn venture with us. It is an experiment.
626740	630060	Especially for other readers who aren't you. Like I feel like that's where it's really
630060	635580	interesting. We're not looking to trick anyone. We just want to see what we can do. We're
635580	639180	not out to hurt anyone's feelings. We're just, we're, we're, we're trying to make, we want
639180	646300	to see what sells. Yeah. Naked came the stranger. Naked came the salute. I've always wanted
646300	650980	to be a little bit of an Andy Kaufman. Yeah, exactly. So, so it's like when you like the
650980	655940	Facebook page, it's not us, it's actually the lady. If you follow her on Twitter, which
655940	660980	is here, tweet her like she's an actual human. When you, when it comes to that, you know,
660980	665540	when it's on Goodreads, you leave actual reviews, like either good reviews, you know, or bad
665540	669180	reviews like, yeah, you could say it sucks, but treat it like it's a real book. Treat
669180	674620	it like it's legit. Like from now on, it's like, from now on, you are our actors in this
674620	680540	grand experiment. As always, follow us on Twitter at Shay Apocalypse and tweet at the
680540	686580	silly book, sexy alien book for the silly stuff and leave your comments, suggestions
686580	693260	for the query and our title, which we still don't have, and all that fun stuff down there
693260	700340	and you know, watch us on blip.tv and sorry you missed out on these incredibly sexy shirts.
700340	705340	They're so cute. Look at his eyes, they have sparkles. I missed the memo. I say he got
705340	712260	the ice cream from Uncle Neil. Yay! And as always, if you live in Ireland, I'm jealous.
712260	715940	For many reasons, but yeah. Well, think of how much they have to pay tax-wise for this
715940	719340	stuff. Duty-free! Yeah, duty-free! Cheers!
