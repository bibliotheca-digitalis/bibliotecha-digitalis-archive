1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,520
That's good. I've never had this book. Good. Wow, that is good. Good luck with our t-shirts.

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:16,260
Wait, where is it? Writers Tears. Tears of Laughter. Yeah, because so many tears were

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,960
shed. Oh, I cried. So many tears were shed reading the books that led to this project.

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,560
Ours is awesome. I should know because I've read it eight times by now. Because you've

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,280
done most of the work on it. Yes, I homogenized. I took all eight of our writing and tried

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,520
to make it sound like Stephenie Meyer. And by Stephenie Meyer, I mean Sarah Ellenson.

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:48,560
Sarah Ellenson, yes, our author. So the way that I homogenized it mostly was looking for

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,640
repeated phrases that people were using for a protagonist's voice. For instance, I noticed

9
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:01,640
that Nella had her say, oh crap, a lot. Which is rather Fifty Shades. Well. So I went back

10
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,600
and added a lot of crap to the other chapters. Literally. I looked for places that needed

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,840
crap and I put that crap right in there. It wasn't as hard as I thought it was going to

12
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,560
be. It didn't take me two solid weeks of doing absolutely nothing. It was time consuming,

13
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,440
but otherwise not like mentally straining. It was enjoyable work. I don't know, I think

14
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,880
everyone has a worst thing, but I think for a lot of people's worst thing is the querying

15
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,960
process. Yes. Where you actually have to court industry professionals to like your product

16
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:41,640
and want you and your product and your ideas and that's terrible and awful and I hate it.

17
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:49,200
To do a query, there's a process to, you know, a standard formula that most people use is

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,800
you write a query letter, you look up agents that are interested in the kind of book you're

19
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,520
writing. So we would look for agents that are seeking young adult paranormal romance.

20
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,680
So basically no one in the world anymore. And if you're seeking that, then we would

21
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,400
read their submission guidelines, which will say either send us a letter and a summary

22
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,960
or a letter and a full manuscript or a first three chapters. But each agent is different.

23
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,800
You want to make sure you're sending the right thing if you want to make a good impression,

24
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:22,800
which I'm not sure we do. But Lisa, I'm Sarah Ellenson. I don't understand why I need an

25
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:32,640
agent. Doesn't my work speak for itself? Well, Sarah, publishers don't really do the slush

26
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,360
pile thing anymore. Mostly for copyright reasons, as I understand it. A slush pile is a giant

27
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,280
pile of bad writing. No, it's a giant pile of any writing. Yeah, it's mostly bad, but

28
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,040
that's just sturgeon's law. Anyone who sends in a thing they've written to someone who

29
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,280
they want to buy it, it ends up in the slush pile. So these people will get these submissions

30
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,960
and because there's so many of them, they call it the slush pile. And it's mostly bad,

31
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,200
but that's just sturgeon's law. Your stuff is probably brilliant. Your stuff is great.

32
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:08,560
But it will end up in the slush pile, just like our stuff, which is brilliant. Genius.

33
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:16,280
It's brilliant. You'll love it. So what does a query consist of? It's basically the back

34
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,840
of a book blurb. It doesn't even have to have a hi, how are you, but the most important

35
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,920
thing is the back of a book blurb. She was running from her past. This is the one sentence

36
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:32,280
right here. The one sentence hook, which says, I am intrigued. This interests me. And Hunger

37
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,720
Games is a good example because it's a good book. In the ruins of a place once known as

38
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:46,040
North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining capital surrounded by 12 outlying

39
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:53,060
districts. I already want to know more. Something's happened to North America. The first line

40
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,800
of your book is supposed to be a hook. The first line of your back of the book summary,

41
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,320
your query letter. If this was your query letter to an agent, you'd be on the right

42
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:08,460
track. Here's my favorite 50 shades of gray. And our first line here is when literature

43
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:13,920
student Anastasia Steele goes to interview young entrepreneur Christian Gray, she encounters

44
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:21,880
a man who is beautiful, brilliant, and intimidating. That sure is what happens. Who cares? That's

45
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:29,220
not getting my interest. I'm not like, I must know more. The world was. If you ask, go on.

46
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,700
It's not out of actual interest because no, really what happens then? And you're going

47
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:41,660
nowhere. Little did she know about the bodies in the basement. The only thing remotely interesting

48
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,100
about this is beautiful, brilliant, and intimidating. But how is that different from anything else?

49
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,500
How does that set this apart? It doesn't from bad to worse. Yeah. Okay. This, okay. I don't

50
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,060
actually physically have the copy of this cause we have the ebook version. This book

51
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:04,220
Tiger's Curse is literally the worst book I have ever read. It is the worst. Yeah. It's

52
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:10,140
the worst book that was actually professionally published by actually publishing the worst

53
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:16,460
book I've ever read. And here's the as per Goodreads blurb. And it's also the worst blurb

54
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:30,500
I've ever read. Oh God. Okay. Passion, fate, loyalty. Oh, well, okay. All right. That makes

55
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,900
me want to read this book. Notebooks have that. Yeah. Okay. All right. And then again,

56
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,120
it starts over. Like apparently that, okay. And then it's, would you risk it all to change

57
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,860
your destiny? Oh, well I'm just like, okay. You know, you read those like never do this

58
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,540
about queries. And I feel like that that's, that's not up there. It's like the, would

59
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:54,500
you rhetorical question. And then the only thing worse than that is the last thing Kelsey

60
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,240
Hayes thought she'd be doing this summer was trying to break a 300 year old Indian curse.

61
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:05,340
And it's like, okay, the last thing Lego brick thought that they'd be doing was going on

62
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:10,120
an epic adventure. Like that is the worst book. Oh God. And it just goes on from there.

63
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:17,320
It's terrible. It's, it's a terrible, terrible blurb for a terrible, terrible book. It's

64
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,320
really bad. There are other ways to go about it. For instance, Twilight takes a slightly

65
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,240
different approach and Twilight being, you know, the spark of all of these. Hold my whiskey

66
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:33,860
please. All right. It starts off. It has a quote on the back. A very famous quote about

67
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,840
three things. I was absolutely positive. First, Edward was a vampire. Second, there was a

68
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,360
part of him that didn't know how dominant that part might be. That thirsted for my blood.

69
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,520
It's intriguing. It's interesting. It's a quote straight out of the book. Didn't have

70
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,060
to put any extra thought in that. I mean, if we have a quote that's actually interesting

71
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:54,760
in our book, we can talk about it. Third. And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably

72
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,240
in love with him. I mean, it's got romance. It's got danger. It's got blood. This is much

73
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,440
better than the previous two. Yeah. Like, you know, I guess that's kind of all you need

74
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,400
to know. And then, you know, and bear in mind, these are not query letters. This was a professionally

75
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,920
published book. It was always professionally published, unlike Fifty Shades and Tiger's

76
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:17,960
Socks. Well, okay, there's also this one. All right. Ireland has been blessed with great

77
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,920
poets and playwrights down through the centuries. However, most, if not all, of our great writers

78
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:28,000
suffered from writer's block. That's pretty good. That's one book at a time. Many sought

79
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,600
comfort and inspiration from the water of life. Whiskey. That's not a book at all. It's

80
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:40,480
got a book blurb on it, though. Better than Tiger's. It's much better than the Tiger book.

81
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,280
It's also more delicious. Yeah, it's also, it's better in every possible way. You're

82
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,640
not paying us, we swear. Yeah, no. Writer's Tears, a delicious, quality Irish pot still

83
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,280
whiskey. Available only in Ireland. You don't know what hell I went through to get this,

84
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,100
by the way, that I could find a whiskey called Writer's Tears. Thank you. And bring it back

85
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,000
to New York. And bring it back to New York and write it off on my text. It says, I traded

86
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,220
my tomorrows to remain in yesterday. Whiskey tears are falling now. Each one cries another

87
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:20,220
day. Still better than Twilight. Still a better low story than Twilight. Me and my tears.

88
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:27,260
So our query letter, our back of the book blurb. Yeah, what is our hook? We can't say

89
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,280
Twilight with Cthulhu. Yeah, but I feel like that is the hook. Would you like to read a

90
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,260
paranormal teenage romance with Cthulhu? Yes, romance has to be in there. It has to be about

91
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:40,180
love. It has to be about her being the chosen one, being the only one prophecy that can

92
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:45,260
save the world. We should do the thing that the Tiger book does where it's like, you know,

93
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:50,260
would you? Terrible rhetorical question. Yeah. Well, we have to say something about a mysterious

94
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:57,180
beautiful boy who hates her at first. Yeah. And she's like, why does he hate me? I think

95
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,620
that's our book. That's what's going to get people to want to read this. Then we just

96
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:08,180
like sprinkle hints about like, you know, immortality and having the key to destroy.

97
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:14,460
Yeah. I think it needs to be like only she has the key to stopping him, but not in the

98
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,540
way he ever dreamed. And the word dream has to be in there. Of course. Yeah. Lots and

99
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,940
lots about dreaming. Yeah. And that might be the title of our book. Yeah. We're still

100
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,460
working on that. We're still trying to figure out the title. Yeah. Give us titles. Yeah.

101
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:31,900
Right now the best one we've got so far is dream colors. I'm really not kidding. There's

102
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:37,500
dreams and there's calls. It's a little weak. Yeah. Too bad we can't go like, I mean, Stephanie

103
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:48,620
Meyers wanted to name it Forks. Forks, which forking sucks. So now we're up to the serious

104
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,780
business point. We're actually having to figure out where to send this and how to send it.

105
00:09:52,780 --> 00:10:00,340
So, since everyone is now in on the joke and we start having our Facebook page, which

106
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:07,660
you can, you can like our author here. And the photos are, we paid for the photos. They're

107
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,260
licensed stock images of a lady. Just so you know, like it was that lady, like she's a

108
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:19,540
professional model and we paid for them. Yeah. Now is the point where, you know, you're in

109
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:26,740
on the joke, play it straight. You're in on this solemn venture with us. It is an experiment.

110
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,060
Especially for other readers who aren't you. Like I feel like that's where it's really

111
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:35,580
interesting. We're not looking to trick anyone. We just want to see what we can do. We're

112
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,180
not out to hurt anyone's feelings. We're just, we're, we're, we're trying to make, we want

113
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:46,300
to see what sells. Yeah. Naked came the stranger. Naked came the salute. I've always wanted

114
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,980
to be a little bit of an Andy Kaufman. Yeah, exactly. So, so it's like when you like the

115
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,940
Facebook page, it's not us, it's actually the lady. If you follow her on Twitter, which

116
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,980
is here, tweet her like she's an actual human. When you, when it comes to that, you know,

117
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,540
when it's on Goodreads, you leave actual reviews, like either good reviews, you know, or bad

118
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,180
reviews like, yeah, you could say it sucks, but treat it like it's a real book. Treat

119
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:14,620
it like it's legit. Like from now on, it's like, from now on, you are our actors in this

120
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:20,540
grand experiment. As always, follow us on Twitter at Shay Apocalypse and tweet at the

121
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:26,580
silly book, sexy alien book for the silly stuff and leave your comments, suggestions

122
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:33,260
for the query and our title, which we still don't have, and all that fun stuff down there

123
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:40,340
and you know, watch us on blip.tv and sorry you missed out on these incredibly sexy shirts.

124
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:45,340
They're so cute. Look at his eyes, they have sparkles. I missed the memo. I say he got

125
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:52,260
the ice cream from Uncle Neil. Yay! And as always, if you live in Ireland, I'm jealous.

126
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,940
For many reasons, but yeah. Well, think of how much they have to pay tax-wise for this

127
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,340
stuff. Duty-free! Yeah, duty-free! Cheers!
