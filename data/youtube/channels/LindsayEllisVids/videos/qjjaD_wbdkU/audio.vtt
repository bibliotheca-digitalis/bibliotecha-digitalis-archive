00:00.000 --> 00:10.520
That's good. I've never had this book. Good. Wow, that is good. Good luck with our t-shirts.

00:10.520 --> 00:16.260
Wait, where is it? Writers Tears. Tears of Laughter. Yeah, because so many tears were

00:16.260 --> 00:23.960
shed. Oh, I cried. So many tears were shed reading the books that led to this project.

00:23.960 --> 00:28.560
Ours is awesome. I should know because I've read it eight times by now. Because you've

00:28.560 --> 00:34.280
done most of the work on it. Yes, I homogenized. I took all eight of our writing and tried

00:34.280 --> 00:40.520
to make it sound like Stephenie Meyer. And by Stephenie Meyer, I mean Sarah Ellenson.

00:40.520 --> 00:48.560
Sarah Ellenson, yes, our author. So the way that I homogenized it mostly was looking for

00:48.560 --> 00:53.640
repeated phrases that people were using for a protagonist's voice. For instance, I noticed

00:53.640 --> 01:01.640
that Nella had her say, oh crap, a lot. Which is rather Fifty Shades. Well. So I went back

01:01.640 --> 01:07.600
and added a lot of crap to the other chapters. Literally. I looked for places that needed

01:07.600 --> 01:11.840
crap and I put that crap right in there. It wasn't as hard as I thought it was going to

01:11.840 --> 01:16.560
be. It didn't take me two solid weeks of doing absolutely nothing. It was time consuming,

01:16.560 --> 01:22.440
but otherwise not like mentally straining. It was enjoyable work. I don't know, I think

01:22.440 --> 01:26.880
everyone has a worst thing, but I think for a lot of people's worst thing is the querying

01:26.880 --> 01:32.960
process. Yes. Where you actually have to court industry professionals to like your product

01:32.960 --> 01:41.640
and want you and your product and your ideas and that's terrible and awful and I hate it.

01:41.640 --> 01:49.200
To do a query, there's a process to, you know, a standard formula that most people use is

01:49.200 --> 01:53.800
you write a query letter, you look up agents that are interested in the kind of book you're

01:53.800 --> 01:58.520
writing. So we would look for agents that are seeking young adult paranormal romance.

01:58.520 --> 02:02.680
So basically no one in the world anymore. And if you're seeking that, then we would

02:02.680 --> 02:07.400
read their submission guidelines, which will say either send us a letter and a summary

02:07.400 --> 02:12.960
or a letter and a full manuscript or a first three chapters. But each agent is different.

02:12.960 --> 02:15.800
You want to make sure you're sending the right thing if you want to make a good impression,

02:15.800 --> 02:22.800
which I'm not sure we do. But Lisa, I'm Sarah Ellenson. I don't understand why I need an

02:22.800 --> 02:32.640
agent. Doesn't my work speak for itself? Well, Sarah, publishers don't really do the slush

02:32.640 --> 02:38.360
pile thing anymore. Mostly for copyright reasons, as I understand it. A slush pile is a giant

02:38.360 --> 02:43.280
pile of bad writing. No, it's a giant pile of any writing. Yeah, it's mostly bad, but

02:43.280 --> 02:48.040
that's just sturgeon's law. Anyone who sends in a thing they've written to someone who

02:48.040 --> 02:52.280
they want to buy it, it ends up in the slush pile. So these people will get these submissions

02:52.280 --> 02:56.960
and because there's so many of them, they call it the slush pile. And it's mostly bad,

02:56.960 --> 03:02.200
but that's just sturgeon's law. Your stuff is probably brilliant. Your stuff is great.

03:02.200 --> 03:08.560
But it will end up in the slush pile, just like our stuff, which is brilliant. Genius.

03:08.560 --> 03:16.280
It's brilliant. You'll love it. So what does a query consist of? It's basically the back

03:16.280 --> 03:20.840
of a book blurb. It doesn't even have to have a hi, how are you, but the most important

03:20.840 --> 03:26.920
thing is the back of a book blurb. She was running from her past. This is the one sentence

03:26.920 --> 03:32.280
right here. The one sentence hook, which says, I am intrigued. This interests me. And Hunger

03:32.280 --> 03:36.720
Games is a good example because it's a good book. In the ruins of a place once known as

03:36.720 --> 03:46.040
North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining capital surrounded by 12 outlying

03:46.040 --> 03:53.060
districts. I already want to know more. Something's happened to North America. The first line

03:53.060 --> 03:57.800
of your book is supposed to be a hook. The first line of your back of the book summary,

03:57.800 --> 04:02.320
your query letter. If this was your query letter to an agent, you'd be on the right

04:02.320 --> 04:08.460
track. Here's my favorite 50 shades of gray. And our first line here is when literature

04:08.460 --> 04:13.920
student Anastasia Steele goes to interview young entrepreneur Christian Gray, she encounters

04:13.920 --> 04:21.880
a man who is beautiful, brilliant, and intimidating. That sure is what happens. Who cares? That's

04:21.880 --> 04:29.220
not getting my interest. I'm not like, I must know more. The world was. If you ask, go on.

04:29.220 --> 04:34.700
It's not out of actual interest because no, really what happens then? And you're going

04:34.700 --> 04:41.660
nowhere. Little did she know about the bodies in the basement. The only thing remotely interesting

04:41.660 --> 04:46.100
about this is beautiful, brilliant, and intimidating. But how is that different from anything else?

04:46.100 --> 04:50.500
How does that set this apart? It doesn't from bad to worse. Yeah. Okay. This, okay. I don't

04:50.500 --> 04:55.060
actually physically have the copy of this cause we have the ebook version. This book

04:55.060 --> 05:04.220
Tiger's Curse is literally the worst book I have ever read. It is the worst. Yeah. It's

05:04.220 --> 05:10.140
the worst book that was actually professionally published by actually publishing the worst

05:10.140 --> 05:16.460
book I've ever read. And here's the as per Goodreads blurb. And it's also the worst blurb

05:16.460 --> 05:30.500
I've ever read. Oh God. Okay. Passion, fate, loyalty. Oh, well, okay. All right. That makes

05:30.500 --> 05:35.900
me want to read this book. Notebooks have that. Yeah. Okay. All right. And then again,

05:35.900 --> 05:40.120
it starts over. Like apparently that, okay. And then it's, would you risk it all to change

05:40.120 --> 05:44.860
your destiny? Oh, well I'm just like, okay. You know, you read those like never do this

05:44.860 --> 05:48.540
about queries. And I feel like that that's, that's not up there. It's like the, would

05:48.540 --> 05:54.500
you rhetorical question. And then the only thing worse than that is the last thing Kelsey

05:54.500 --> 05:59.240
Hayes thought she'd be doing this summer was trying to break a 300 year old Indian curse.

05:59.240 --> 06:05.340
And it's like, okay, the last thing Lego brick thought that they'd be doing was going on

06:05.340 --> 06:10.120
an epic adventure. Like that is the worst book. Oh God. And it just goes on from there.

06:10.120 --> 06:17.320
It's terrible. It's, it's a terrible, terrible blurb for a terrible, terrible book. It's

06:17.320 --> 06:22.320
really bad. There are other ways to go about it. For instance, Twilight takes a slightly

06:22.320 --> 06:27.240
different approach and Twilight being, you know, the spark of all of these. Hold my whiskey

06:27.240 --> 06:33.860
please. All right. It starts off. It has a quote on the back. A very famous quote about

06:33.860 --> 06:37.840
three things. I was absolutely positive. First, Edward was a vampire. Second, there was a

06:37.840 --> 06:42.360
part of him that didn't know how dominant that part might be. That thirsted for my blood.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.520
It's intriguing. It's interesting. It's a quote straight out of the book. Didn't have

06:45.520 --> 06:49.060
to put any extra thought in that. I mean, if we have a quote that's actually interesting

06:49.060 --> 06:54.760
in our book, we can talk about it. Third. And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably

06:54.760 --> 06:59.240
in love with him. I mean, it's got romance. It's got danger. It's got blood. This is much

06:59.240 --> 07:03.440
better than the previous two. Yeah. Like, you know, I guess that's kind of all you need

07:03.440 --> 07:07.400
to know. And then, you know, and bear in mind, these are not query letters. This was a professionally

07:07.400 --> 07:11.920
published book. It was always professionally published, unlike Fifty Shades and Tiger's

07:11.920 --> 07:17.960
Socks. Well, okay, there's also this one. All right. Ireland has been blessed with great

07:17.960 --> 07:22.920
poets and playwrights down through the centuries. However, most, if not all, of our great writers

07:22.920 --> 07:28.000
suffered from writer's block. That's pretty good. That's one book at a time. Many sought

07:28.000 --> 07:33.600
comfort and inspiration from the water of life. Whiskey. That's not a book at all. It's

07:33.600 --> 07:40.480
got a book blurb on it, though. Better than Tiger's. It's much better than the Tiger book.

07:40.480 --> 07:45.280
It's also more delicious. Yeah, it's also, it's better in every possible way. You're

07:45.280 --> 07:51.640
not paying us, we swear. Yeah, no. Writer's Tears, a delicious, quality Irish pot still

07:51.640 --> 07:56.280
whiskey. Available only in Ireland. You don't know what hell I went through to get this,

07:56.280 --> 08:00.100
by the way, that I could find a whiskey called Writer's Tears. Thank you. And bring it back

08:00.100 --> 08:04.000
to New York. And bring it back to New York and write it off on my text. It says, I traded

08:04.000 --> 08:11.220
my tomorrows to remain in yesterday. Whiskey tears are falling now. Each one cries another

08:11.220 --> 08:20.220
day. Still better than Twilight. Still a better low story than Twilight. Me and my tears.

08:20.220 --> 08:27.260
So our query letter, our back of the book blurb. Yeah, what is our hook? We can't say

08:27.260 --> 08:31.280
Twilight with Cthulhu. Yeah, but I feel like that is the hook. Would you like to read a

08:31.280 --> 08:35.260
paranormal teenage romance with Cthulhu? Yes, romance has to be in there. It has to be about

08:35.260 --> 08:40.180
love. It has to be about her being the chosen one, being the only one prophecy that can

08:40.180 --> 08:45.260
save the world. We should do the thing that the Tiger book does where it's like, you know,

08:45.260 --> 08:50.260
would you? Terrible rhetorical question. Yeah. Well, we have to say something about a mysterious

08:50.260 --> 08:57.180
beautiful boy who hates her at first. Yeah. And she's like, why does he hate me? I think

08:57.180 --> 09:02.620
that's our book. That's what's going to get people to want to read this. Then we just

09:02.620 --> 09:08.180
like sprinkle hints about like, you know, immortality and having the key to destroy.

09:08.180 --> 09:14.460
Yeah. I think it needs to be like only she has the key to stopping him, but not in the

09:14.460 --> 09:18.540
way he ever dreamed. And the word dream has to be in there. Of course. Yeah. Lots and

09:18.540 --> 09:21.940
lots about dreaming. Yeah. And that might be the title of our book. Yeah. We're still

09:21.940 --> 09:25.460
working on that. We're still trying to figure out the title. Yeah. Give us titles. Yeah.

09:25.460 --> 09:31.900
Right now the best one we've got so far is dream colors. I'm really not kidding. There's

09:31.900 --> 09:37.500
dreams and there's calls. It's a little weak. Yeah. Too bad we can't go like, I mean, Stephanie

09:37.500 --> 09:48.620
Meyers wanted to name it Forks. Forks, which forking sucks. So now we're up to the serious

09:48.620 --> 09:52.780
business point. We're actually having to figure out where to send this and how to send it.

09:52.780 --> 10:00.340
So, since everyone is now in on the joke and we start having our Facebook page, which

10:00.340 --> 10:07.660
you can, you can like our author here. And the photos are, we paid for the photos. They're

10:07.660 --> 10:12.260
licensed stock images of a lady. Just so you know, like it was that lady, like she's a

10:12.260 --> 10:19.540
professional model and we paid for them. Yeah. Now is the point where, you know, you're in

10:19.540 --> 10:26.740
on the joke, play it straight. You're in on this solemn venture with us. It is an experiment.

10:26.740 --> 10:30.060
Especially for other readers who aren't you. Like I feel like that's where it's really

10:30.060 --> 10:35.580
interesting. We're not looking to trick anyone. We just want to see what we can do. We're

10:35.580 --> 10:39.180
not out to hurt anyone's feelings. We're just, we're, we're, we're trying to make, we want

10:39.180 --> 10:46.300
to see what sells. Yeah. Naked came the stranger. Naked came the salute. I've always wanted

10:46.300 --> 10:50.980
to be a little bit of an Andy Kaufman. Yeah, exactly. So, so it's like when you like the

10:50.980 --> 10:55.940
Facebook page, it's not us, it's actually the lady. If you follow her on Twitter, which

10:55.940 --> 11:00.980
is here, tweet her like she's an actual human. When you, when it comes to that, you know,

11:00.980 --> 11:05.540
when it's on Goodreads, you leave actual reviews, like either good reviews, you know, or bad

11:05.540 --> 11:09.180
reviews like, yeah, you could say it sucks, but treat it like it's a real book. Treat

11:09.180 --> 11:14.620
it like it's legit. Like from now on, it's like, from now on, you are our actors in this

11:14.620 --> 11:20.540
grand experiment. As always, follow us on Twitter at Shay Apocalypse and tweet at the

11:20.540 --> 11:26.580
silly book, sexy alien book for the silly stuff and leave your comments, suggestions

11:26.580 --> 11:33.260
for the query and our title, which we still don't have, and all that fun stuff down there

11:33.260 --> 11:40.340
and you know, watch us on blip.tv and sorry you missed out on these incredibly sexy shirts.

11:40.340 --> 11:45.340
They're so cute. Look at his eyes, they have sparkles. I missed the memo. I say he got

11:45.340 --> 11:52.260
the ice cream from Uncle Neil. Yay! And as always, if you live in Ireland, I'm jealous.

11:52.260 --> 11:55.940
For many reasons, but yeah. Well, think of how much they have to pay tax-wise for this

11:55.940 --> 11:59.340
stuff. Duty-free! Yeah, duty-free! Cheers!
