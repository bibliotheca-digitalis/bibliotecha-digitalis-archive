00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
Good afternoon! I hope everyone is having a lovely war on Christmas.

00:04.480 --> 00:08.400
If you're anything like me, you're all dressed up with nowhere to go.

00:08.400 --> 00:11.840
Literally the first Christmas where I don't get to see my family

00:11.840 --> 00:20.160
in all of my 36 years on this earth. Yeah, I'm fine with that.

00:20.160 --> 00:24.880
This episode was brought to you by my publisher asking

00:24.880 --> 00:28.640
when I'm going to do a content of promoting my book before Christmas.

00:28.640 --> 00:34.080
Just under the wire. You can see it right here along with some other

00:34.080 --> 00:40.480
gift ideas for the SFF fan in your life. It's only mostly

00:40.480 --> 00:44.880
extremely nepotistic. I had a run-in with the oven if you're

00:44.880 --> 00:47.680
wondering. So I wanted to do a Q&A for a while but

00:47.680 --> 00:50.880
the thing about books is they take a lot longer to get through than

00:50.880 --> 00:53.440
movies and generally when they're released it's not like everybody reads

00:53.440 --> 00:55.600
it all in the same week. It's a very slow burn.

00:55.600 --> 00:58.640
But it's been about five months so I figured I can

00:58.640 --> 01:03.920
break this down into a no spoiler discussion or at least what I

01:03.920 --> 01:06.720
consider no spoilers. Like if it's if it's in the

01:06.720 --> 01:10.960
you know blurb on the jacket then it doesn't count as spoilers.

01:10.960 --> 01:14.960
Spoilers section where I actually talk about the content of the book in a

01:14.960 --> 01:18.720
spoilery way. Finally sequel stuff at the end and I

01:18.720 --> 01:21.520
don't want to say it'll be spoilery but it would be like on the level of stuff

01:21.520 --> 01:25.200
that you read like on the jacket blurb which incidentally has not been written

01:25.200 --> 01:27.040
yet. So the way I did this was through

01:27.040 --> 01:31.520
Twitter because that required the least amount of effort on my part.

01:37.520 --> 01:41.280
What software did you use to write slash organize all the world building going on?

01:41.280 --> 01:44.720
Is it a bunch of Google Docs? More specialized things with Scrivener?

01:44.720 --> 01:49.360
Both. I use Google Docs for a lot of it like especially keeping track of like

01:49.360 --> 01:52.560
timelines. Like there's like I guess sort of the

01:52.560 --> 01:56.720
macro timeline of um you know alien civilization and when

01:56.720 --> 02:01.520
we hit what milestone like becoming spacefaring becoming interstellar

02:01.520 --> 02:05.760
you know becoming post-natural and then there's the micro timelines like

02:05.760 --> 02:10.480
you know the human family trees and when so and so was born and what year they

02:10.480 --> 02:12.560
were born and when they went to school and how they met.

02:12.560 --> 02:16.400
But mainly I use Scrivener. I just have to have a really clear road map before I

02:16.400 --> 02:18.960
actually do it and I use Scrivener for that and I find

02:18.960 --> 02:22.720
Scrivener very good for organizing massive projects especially one

02:22.720 --> 02:27.600
like this that is like a combination of epistolary novel and

02:27.600 --> 02:31.600
uh regular prose novel because I have to categorize the different sections

02:31.600 --> 02:35.280
especially in the sequel which has multiple points of view. In your video

02:35.280 --> 02:37.680
talking about your book deal you mentioned reasons why it didn't sell in

02:37.680 --> 02:41.440
it having to do with publishing trends. Would it be a spoiler for the sequel if

02:41.440 --> 02:44.880
you went into those reasons now? No. But generally when we talk about

02:44.880 --> 02:47.680
publishing trends publishers want something that is

02:47.680 --> 02:50.880
similar to something that has already done well

02:50.880 --> 02:54.880
because like Hank Green's book uh An Absolutely Remarkable Thing was like

02:54.880 --> 02:58.720
the only comp we had when we had on submission. Besides his book there

02:58.720 --> 03:03.120
weren't really any other you know best-selling sci-fi

03:03.120 --> 03:05.360
novels that were also sort of contemporary

03:05.360 --> 03:09.760
real world grounded type stuff. Publishers want to buy things that are

03:09.760 --> 03:12.320
similar to things that have done well within the

03:12.400 --> 03:16.880
last five years and um in terms of like commercial

03:16.880 --> 03:19.360
science fiction there weren't a lot that were similar.

03:19.360 --> 03:22.400
Did you deliberately set out to write basically the book Transformer should

03:22.400 --> 03:25.040
have been? I mean if you're talking about the movie

03:25.040 --> 03:32.560
uh maybe. I feel like so much of my adult life has

03:32.560 --> 03:36.320
been shaped by frustration with Michael Bay and I

03:36.320 --> 03:40.160
think like one of the things that like I kind of got obsessed with with the first

03:40.160 --> 03:43.040
Transformers movie after it came out was that

03:43.040 --> 03:46.960
it did kind of set up a really interesting premise which was that

03:46.960 --> 03:50.400
okay aliens show up but the world doesn't end what now?

03:50.400 --> 03:54.320
Especially after the second one um the the worst one

03:54.320 --> 03:57.600
arguably no actually I think maybe they're all really bad but like the

03:57.600 --> 04:00.960
second one ends with like the fallen being like we're here we're

04:00.960 --> 04:04.320
queer we're gonna kill you but then you know the world doesn't end

04:04.320 --> 04:08.960
so like what then and they kind of they kind of tiptoe up to like doing

04:08.960 --> 04:12.160
something interesting with it like how in the third movie there's like

04:12.160 --> 04:16.720
you know John Turturro hanging out with Transformer refugees in Cuba.

04:16.720 --> 04:21.360
Buy my book! Buy my book! I think it is also very fair to say that

04:21.360 --> 04:26.480
uh a lot of it was shaped by frustration with Mr. Bay's Transformers franchise.

04:26.480 --> 04:29.680
When describing Korra's outfits did you try to create an iconic look

04:29.680 --> 04:34.080
for a potential adaptation? Yeah sort of what I thought were the most

04:34.080 --> 04:38.160
visually I don't know 50s b-movie scenes. I keep

04:38.160 --> 04:40.880
describing this uh tiered chiffon maxi dress from the

04:40.880 --> 04:45.040
1970s and um I don't know why I decided to go with

04:45.040 --> 04:50.080
that and not something more like you know 1950s um

04:50.080 --> 04:53.600
but I think it was just it was kind of like a janky

04:53.600 --> 04:58.720
like a janky version of that um you know something white and flowing and damsel

04:58.720 --> 05:01.920
but also like cheap and polyester in 70s. When will

05:01.920 --> 05:05.040
you write an omegaverse novel? I don't think I need to someone already

05:05.040 --> 05:09.680
wrote an omegaverse axioms in fanfic. It's on AO3. No I haven't read it I'm

05:09.680 --> 05:12.720
not allowed. In regards to Korra's experience with linguistics in college

05:12.720 --> 05:14.720
have you ever taken any linguistics courses?

05:14.720 --> 05:19.120
Yes at NYU I had what they call a um concentration

05:19.120 --> 05:22.800
which is what it is when you don't have enough credits for a

05:22.800 --> 05:27.280
minor but you had enough where they're like

05:27.280 --> 05:31.360
ah we could put that on the degree somewhere whatever. Axioms in ready read

05:31.360 --> 05:34.720
very much like the natural disaster films of the 90s. How much of this was

05:34.720 --> 05:37.280
intentional? I didn't really set out to do that but I guess

05:37.280 --> 05:40.480
some of that was inevitable because so much of like the plot and the structure

05:40.480 --> 05:45.040
and the character dynamics was very much inspired by movies like that

05:45.040 --> 05:48.320
and like towards the end of the process like after the book sold and while we

05:48.320 --> 05:51.200
were in revisions like I kind of allowed myself license to

05:51.200 --> 05:55.120
just like go all in on it. I've seen Independence Day probably more times

05:55.120 --> 06:01.440
than I've seen any other movie. Let's just own it you know and it's like

06:01.440 --> 06:04.080
there's a lot of Men in Black in there um

06:04.080 --> 06:07.680
there's a lot of Invader Zim in there it's sort of like which is which is

06:07.680 --> 06:10.560
funny because I saw that Jonan Vasquez posted like

06:10.560 --> 06:13.840
check out my book haul and that was in it and I was like oh no

06:13.840 --> 06:18.000
Pathetic humans fleeing in terror at the sight of Zim!

06:18.000 --> 06:21.920
Nobody even looking at you! It's a show of respect!

06:21.920 --> 06:25.840
Their stupid eyes can't handle all these!

06:25.840 --> 06:29.040
Because I was watching the new Invader Zim movie uh

06:29.040 --> 06:33.200
Enter the Florpus and as I was watching it I was like holy shit I forgot

06:33.200 --> 06:38.880
how much Invader Zim um kind of crept into like the world

06:38.880 --> 06:43.600
building it's almost sort of like uh Invader Zim played straight like

06:43.600 --> 06:46.400
which I'm sure Jonan Vasquez would be horrified by

06:46.400 --> 06:50.240
like even even uh Kaylee Donaldson of Pajiba pointed this out

06:50.240 --> 06:53.840
it's sort of like ampersand is almost like a if Invader Zim

06:53.840 --> 06:58.480
was competent but where are the flames I can't rule the world without cool

06:58.480 --> 07:01.920
flames shooting up behind me

07:10.000 --> 07:12.720
now that it's out can you talk about what it was like watching bumblebee with

07:12.720 --> 07:17.600
this in your pocket bumblebee came out right before

07:17.600 --> 07:21.280
the book went on submission I loved bumblebee because it was you know

07:21.280 --> 07:24.480
the Transformers movie so the only good Transformers movie but it had a lot of

07:24.480 --> 07:28.160
similarities and when I was watching it with uh Lisa for the first

07:28.160 --> 07:30.880
time this one um she we were in the movie

07:30.880 --> 07:33.760
theater and she just kind of like whispers to me like

07:33.760 --> 07:37.520
this is a lot like your book and I'm like oh it's

07:37.520 --> 07:40.640
they stole my idea not the other way around but the but the really funny

07:40.640 --> 07:44.640
thing was uh when we were um the first blurb

07:44.640 --> 07:47.920
Saint Martin's Press sent me that was like the cover copy

07:47.920 --> 07:51.520
this thing it basically like it read it read

07:51.520 --> 07:55.680
like the plot of bumblebee so much that it included things that were

07:55.680 --> 07:59.600
in the movie bumblebee but were not in my book

07:59.600 --> 08:03.120
for instance like we are being pursued by

08:03.120 --> 08:07.360
like evil John Cena it's like but no that's not the plot that's not what

08:07.360 --> 08:10.320
happens oh my god if the Axiom Zen series was adapted for

08:10.320 --> 08:13.280
tv would you rather see it made into live action or animated

08:13.280 --> 08:16.800
I don't know it depends on who's making it if it was animated I feel like it

08:16.800 --> 08:20.160
would have to be like either anime or anime style you know

08:20.160 --> 08:22.960
because it should feel a little aged up but yeah I

08:22.960 --> 08:25.680
don't know I think I think that really depends on who's at the helm

08:25.680 --> 08:30.080
and what the budget is because I think the thing is like if it was animated

08:30.080 --> 08:33.680
for the content that it is it would probably be cheaper than live action

08:33.680 --> 08:37.040
because like geez I I kind of doubt we're ever going to see

08:37.040 --> 08:40.640
a live action version what language slang phrase do you use often that was

08:40.640 --> 08:43.040
off limits due to the period setting that you chose

08:43.040 --> 08:47.840
the truth is um I was a lot more careful about that for the sequel like I have an

08:47.840 --> 08:51.680
entire thread that was neologisms that I started to write but had to cut

08:51.680 --> 08:54.960
and I guess they would tend to be like internet thing like

08:54.960 --> 09:00.640
uh you know like we can't use doge like much alien very invasion or stuff

09:00.640 --> 09:02.960
like that even though that's already dated I also

09:02.960 --> 09:06.480
kind of had a problem of like sort of in the opposite direction of like language

09:06.480 --> 09:10.400
that was a really common then um but is like considered super

09:10.400 --> 09:14.960
problematic now like as a for instance um like I think I had a

09:14.960 --> 09:19.760
uh a scene where Felix Cora's brother calls something gay

09:19.760 --> 09:24.160
in like a derogatory way which you know a 13 year old in 2007

09:24.160 --> 09:27.200
absolutely would have um but like you know

09:27.200 --> 09:30.640
we had these conversations about like do we want to be true to the period or keep

09:30.640 --> 09:34.320
in mind who's reading it now and you know defaulted to the who's reading

09:34.320 --> 09:38.000
it now even though it is accurate that doesn't mean it needs to be there

09:38.000 --> 09:41.280
do you think your history of doing video essays will influence more folks to make

09:41.280 --> 09:44.720
video essays analyzing your work is that an exciting prospect or a

09:44.720 --> 09:49.360
dreadful one I mean I guess it's not really relevant to me because I

09:49.360 --> 09:51.360
wouldn't watch it I don't I don't think it's

09:51.360 --> 09:55.040
fair I get that not all authors are like that but I think just from an ethical

09:55.040 --> 09:58.480
standpoint I shouldn't engage with stuff like that

09:58.480 --> 10:01.680
like that's not for me that's for other people to have

10:01.680 --> 10:03.520
discussions that said I think it would be more

10:03.520 --> 10:08.640
likely for me if only because the type of viewer I have and the type of

10:08.640 --> 10:11.120
audience I have is more likely to be interested

10:11.120 --> 10:15.200
in video essays how much of your theories did you have done before it

10:15.200 --> 10:18.720
queried I mean I had definitely had it mapped out by the time it sold

10:18.720 --> 10:22.960
and we pitched them five and they bought one and they bought two more after the

10:22.960 --> 10:25.200
pre-sale numbers for the first one came in so

10:25.200 --> 10:28.880
thanks for that so basically three out of five are under contract and whether I

10:28.880 --> 10:32.880
get to finish it I guess is contingent on how well the first three

10:32.880 --> 10:36.080
do so a question for everyone else who has

10:36.080 --> 10:39.600
read the book does everyone envision Lindsay as Cora while reading this

10:39.600 --> 10:43.280
and if so what is Lindsay's opinion of this that sucks honestly

10:43.280 --> 10:46.480
you know this is like something that most authors don't have to deal with

10:46.480 --> 10:49.520
so I guess as an author I would like to die I would

10:49.520 --> 10:55.440
like for people not to be thinking of me and other things that I've done

10:55.440 --> 10:58.720
while they're reading it but obviously like you know like I say death of the

10:58.720 --> 11:02.800
author for the most part is not a very applicable to the real world

11:02.960 --> 11:06.160
theory that's just not realistic where do we send fan letters

11:06.160 --> 11:10.160
um here this is my business email super early but what's your dream cast and

11:10.160 --> 11:13.680
director for an adaptation Christian Slater would make a great

11:13.680 --> 11:16.800
Nels oh yeah that would be I never thought of that yeah he'd be

11:16.800 --> 11:20.480
perfect the only casting that I thought was kind of a good idea was

11:20.480 --> 11:24.800
Pedro Pascal as Nels but you know we probably couldn't afford him

11:24.800 --> 11:28.400
what build is Cora and Oblivion dark elf

11:28.400 --> 11:32.000
uh mage but also she doesn't really like Oblivion because Oblivion sucks she

11:32.000 --> 11:47.520
prefers Morrowind because it's better

11:47.520 --> 11:51.520
should I read Axiom's end no it depends on what you're into

11:51.520 --> 11:54.400
in your how to get a book deal video you said your agent pinpointed the issue

11:54.400 --> 11:56.800
with why agents thought they could not sell this

11:56.800 --> 11:59.520
and you fixed and suggested that you might share one day are you ready to

11:59.520 --> 12:02.880
share it now are you ready one weird trick that

12:02.880 --> 12:07.200
was keeping me from getting a literary agent was

12:07.200 --> 12:13.120
Cora's age in the original draft she was 19 not 21 and you might be

12:13.120 --> 12:17.200
thinking oh well really what

12:17.200 --> 12:21.120
so the first chapter in the final version she's at work she's a temp

12:21.120 --> 12:25.280
uh and she's dropped out of college but in the first draft she was in school she

12:25.280 --> 12:27.600
was like it you know in college rather than

12:27.600 --> 12:33.520
at work and so that first chapter felt a little too ya curious so it's not

12:33.520 --> 12:38.160
really a deal breaker for like character age in genre fiction

12:38.160 --> 12:42.480
it's more just like how it's presented and so the fact that she was

12:42.480 --> 12:46.560
a little she was young and the first chapter was at school

12:46.560 --> 12:49.920
felt a little too ya curious and so we aged her up

12:49.920 --> 12:53.040
and that was it adding two years to her age

12:53.040 --> 12:56.640
what advice would you give to beginner slash novice writers

12:56.640 --> 12:59.920
for one thing don't make my mistake and over revise

12:59.920 --> 13:03.600
i think another is um once you get to the editorial phase

13:03.600 --> 13:08.320
except that most editorial notes are suggestions they're not mandatory

13:08.320 --> 13:11.840
and editors don't expect you to incorporate

13:11.840 --> 13:15.360
all of them let alone even most of them depending on the notes would you agree

13:15.360 --> 13:18.480
that axiom sin falls within the horse girl genre

13:18.480 --> 13:21.840
yeah since the setting is irl does that mean that lindsay ellis exists in the

13:21.840 --> 13:26.000
universe of the setting you know i'm gonna go with no i'm just

13:26.000 --> 13:28.720
gonna keep it simple no i was never born in this universe

13:28.720 --> 13:32.480
the green brothers exist though what part of axiom sins were you unsure about

13:32.480 --> 13:36.320
but you found turned out really well i guess sort of the dynamic between the

13:36.320 --> 13:39.600
two leads i didn't know if people would buy into it

13:39.600 --> 13:41.440
and that was kind of another reason why i was so

13:41.440 --> 13:44.880
squirrelly about the actual content of the book um

13:44.880 --> 13:50.000
because i didn't want to market it on almost sort of like this

13:50.000 --> 13:54.880
borderline romance because publishing be sexist and i

13:54.880 --> 13:58.000
but you know by that same token it's not for everybody

13:58.000 --> 14:01.040
like it is a hard definitely not for everybody

14:01.040 --> 14:04.560
and so i think the result is that a lot of people read it based on this sort of

14:04.560 --> 14:07.200
like government conspiracy thriller blurb

14:07.200 --> 14:11.200
that probably would not have if they knew that the

14:11.200 --> 14:15.120
main substance of the book is not that and i guess the people that

14:15.120 --> 14:19.680
did like it you know responded to it in the way that i was hoping so

14:19.680 --> 14:22.960
i guess that but by that same token again

14:23.040 --> 14:27.440
not for everybody the physicality of the aliens feels very vivid and visceral

14:27.440 --> 14:30.240
while thinking of their anatomy what kind of visual and material references

14:30.240 --> 14:32.880
did you make for yourself did you settle on their general shape

14:32.880 --> 14:34.880
from the start or was it a longer process

14:34.880 --> 14:38.160
it was kind of both because it's like i always had an idea of the

14:38.160 --> 14:42.080
general shape that was always there from the very beginning but the details

14:42.080 --> 14:45.760
um changed a lot and kind of only really settled towards the end

14:45.760 --> 14:48.560
with the various characters having different opinions on the truth is a

14:48.560 --> 14:52.080
human right debate where on that spectrum do you fall

14:52.080 --> 14:55.760
uh regrettably i think i'm probably a centrist

14:55.760 --> 15:03.200
what i think is what is true matters not as much as how the truth is

15:03.200 --> 15:07.120
framed because any truth can be weaponized

15:07.120 --> 15:10.880
but on the whole i think like it's it's more complicated than just

15:10.880 --> 15:14.560
full transparency because you know again any true thing

15:14.560 --> 15:20.960
can be framed in a way that ultimately furthers a uh completely

15:20.960 --> 15:25.040
unrelated political agenda are you a pantser plotter or in between

15:25.040 --> 15:30.080
hard plotter um outlined a lot do you naturally write in third person

15:30.080 --> 15:32.960
or was this a choice made specifically for this book

15:32.960 --> 15:36.880
was first person ever considered no i don't know i think in a weird way

15:36.880 --> 15:41.440
first person feels more stylistic to me than third person for some reason

15:41.440 --> 15:45.600
i guess if it's if it's in in my head anyway if it's in first person i feel

15:45.600 --> 15:49.040
like there needs to be a narrative reason

15:49.040 --> 15:53.520
like who is this person telling this story to and why

15:53.520 --> 15:56.560
and i know logically that doesn't make any sense like third person is

15:56.560 --> 16:00.240
just as much of a stylistic choice but i guess if i was going to write in first

16:00.240 --> 16:04.080
person i would need there to be a reason like a narrative reason of like why this

16:04.080 --> 16:06.720
person is telling their story how do you think your experience in

16:06.720 --> 16:09.920
screenwriting influenced the novel well i feel like it has a very

16:09.920 --> 16:15.040
screenwriting style i i feel like my prose is very utilitarian

16:15.040 --> 16:18.960
and you know that's just a taste thing some people like that some people don't

16:18.960 --> 16:22.000
um also just like in terms of structuring it

16:22.000 --> 16:25.680
i think more than anything the structure like basically like

16:25.680 --> 16:29.120
um points of attack inciting incidents act breaks

16:29.120 --> 16:32.880
um different sequences taking place in different things and having different

16:32.880 --> 16:37.200
tensions um framing it like that was very

16:37.200 --> 16:39.600
influenced by screenwriting and apparently that is

16:39.600 --> 16:43.280
becoming increasingly common what would you change about the first book

16:43.280 --> 16:46.080
and how will you be adapting what you learned in the second book there were

16:46.160 --> 16:49.120
times when i i kind of deferred to um

16:49.120 --> 16:53.120
editorial um i think maybe to the book's detriment where

16:53.120 --> 16:56.560
you know they'd ask for certain things and i'm not gonna say what they are

16:56.560 --> 16:58.320
because then you're gonna be like oh where is it

16:58.320 --> 17:02.160
but like i do it and then i you know in hindsight would realize like this feels

17:02.160 --> 17:03.840
kind of forced but then i'd kind of leave it

17:03.840 --> 17:07.600
i think the other thing is reading it too much like reading

17:07.600 --> 17:10.640
it too many times and revising it too many times i think

17:10.640 --> 17:14.880
that is i think that's definitely a trap first time authors

17:14.880 --> 17:17.920
fall into whereas you know it's your first time and you want it to be perfect

17:17.920 --> 17:21.840
but then like uh the result is you read over the same

17:21.840 --> 17:24.560
sentences over and over and over and then they just start to lose meaning and

17:24.560 --> 17:27.760
then you stop being able to contrast construct a sentence that

17:27.760 --> 17:32.640
um you know is is flows well i noticed a lot of criticism

17:32.640 --> 17:35.600
about like the writing style especially like in the first

17:35.600 --> 17:41.440
third um and i think part of the reason it does feel kind of clunky is because

17:41.440 --> 17:45.360
i read it too many times and i revised it too many times

17:45.360 --> 17:50.160
and the result was that like you know the the words just stop

17:50.160 --> 17:53.360
carrying meaning so for the sequel for the most part when i finished a draft i

17:53.360 --> 17:57.040
would just put it away and do not look at it until it came

17:57.040 --> 18:00.160
back from editorial with like here's what you need to do

18:00.160 --> 18:03.280
the thing is like when you're doing revisions if you've looked at the

18:03.280 --> 18:06.480
sentences too many times each time you look at it it becomes

18:06.480 --> 18:10.240
harder and harder to restructure it into something that like

18:10.240 --> 18:19.440
flows better or sounds better

18:19.440 --> 18:22.800
what was the biggest most surprising change from your original draft book one

18:22.800 --> 18:25.760
i guess it depends on what you consider the original draft

18:25.760 --> 18:29.200
when i compare the trunked version to the final version

18:29.200 --> 18:33.200
a the trunked version was like way too chicken shit about the you know primary

18:33.200 --> 18:35.440
relationship therefore it was very sterile

18:35.520 --> 18:40.240
and very no emotions allowed and the other biggie was where the

18:40.240 --> 18:43.920
exposition happened and um there would be like these big

18:43.920 --> 18:47.600
exposition dumps towards the beginning um which i you

18:47.600 --> 18:49.840
know upon reflection i was like holy shit this

18:49.840 --> 18:53.760
you know it works so much better if like when she meets ampersand she knows

18:53.760 --> 18:55.920
nothing you know and so she kind of has it's a

18:55.920 --> 18:59.360
journey of discovery rather than having all the information ahead of time

18:59.360 --> 19:02.800
but i guess also like in in those super early drafts

19:02.800 --> 19:07.360
what kind of ended up being the meat of the book wasn't really there at all

19:07.360 --> 19:10.640
so like all these sort of getting to know you chapters that happen like in

19:10.640 --> 19:14.560
the middle and in the bunker just did not exist like

19:14.560 --> 19:17.760
even a little with regards to the ending when

19:17.760 --> 19:21.680
ampersand goes but i'm not human i was like smiley face and then frowny face

19:21.680 --> 19:25.040
can't decide which feeling to have how do you view it

19:25.040 --> 19:28.320
i think that's correct that's the correct response to have

19:28.320 --> 19:32.480
did ampersand lie about the known number of space faring species

19:32.480 --> 19:35.840
no but absolutely take everything he says with a grain of salt he obviously

19:35.840 --> 19:40.000
tends to omit truths if not outright lie and there are definitely some things in

19:40.000 --> 19:45.120
the first book that he lied about stop fucking lying our amygdalins and

19:45.120 --> 19:49.040
their super organism the great filter no ampersand was

19:49.040 --> 19:51.440
telling the truth about that there's a lot of talk in the first book

19:51.440 --> 19:57.120
about like the great filter and why in a sort of statistical likelihood

19:57.120 --> 20:00.640
standpoint this other intelligent civilization

20:00.640 --> 20:05.200
popped up relatively close to earth like only about 100 light years away which

20:05.200 --> 20:08.640
you know in the grand scheme is like really unlikely

20:08.640 --> 20:12.160
but no he was telling the truth about that the superorganism is not the great

20:12.160 --> 20:15.600
filter although that will be elaborated on considerably in the sequel i remember

20:15.600 --> 20:19.840
that ampersand said he had two sim files was that chefo and obelisk or was he not

20:19.840 --> 20:23.680
including chefo because he's dead uh that was not

20:23.680 --> 20:27.360
including chefo because he's dead he has two one is obelisk the other

20:27.360 --> 20:30.480
that is a really good catch of a throwaway line because it is a

20:30.480 --> 20:35.040
very important throwaway line and yes that will be explored considerably

20:35.040 --> 20:38.800
what were the amygdalins evolutionary ancestors like and how do they get their

20:38.800 --> 20:42.560
energy since they don't eat um well they do eat a little

20:42.560 --> 20:46.080
christopher pauline's new book talks about this concept of like a

20:46.080 --> 20:49.520
a human shit mind which is basically like a brain that is

20:49.520 --> 20:52.880
you know kind of fed nutrients constantly

20:52.880 --> 20:56.800
um and in this case they can kind of almost have like a star trek replicator

20:56.800 --> 21:00.400
inside their own bodies so it's kind of like that basically like

21:00.720 --> 21:04.400
similar or those that exist in the bodies of a similar get their energy

21:04.400 --> 21:07.840
differently from everybody else because like you know espress and all the other

21:07.840 --> 21:13.600
ones they don't have like these grand superpowers then that's basically

21:13.600 --> 21:17.200
uh because they uh have a different form of energy

21:17.200 --> 21:20.720
but it's it's kind of same ish and the simple answer is

21:20.720 --> 21:24.960
i went with uh matter antimatter fusion and as for their ancestors

21:24.960 --> 21:28.480
um i don't know if i'll ever really get the opportunity to go into this because

21:28.560 --> 21:32.960
i have this whole like you know what kind of star did there's

21:32.960 --> 21:35.600
planet well not because like in my mind it was like a moon that

21:35.600 --> 21:41.440
ordered like a gas giant around like a um like a like a k-type star a red giant

21:41.440 --> 21:44.560
um so the atmosphere would look very different and the greenhouse effect

21:44.560 --> 21:46.960
would be very different the air pressure would be different

21:46.960 --> 21:52.000
um and that's sort of being like why our sun is very like yeah you know it's just

21:52.000 --> 21:54.880
like way brighter than they were evolved for

21:54.880 --> 21:57.040
and that's part of why their eyes are so big

21:57.040 --> 22:01.200
um that and that and big eyes is cute and alien

22:01.200 --> 22:04.080
i guess it's like kind of a complicated question that i always kind of have in

22:04.080 --> 22:07.200
the back of my mind while writing but i don't know if it'll ever actually make

22:07.200 --> 22:10.000
it to the page because it may never be relevant to

22:10.000 --> 22:13.040
the actual prose but the simple answer is like

22:13.040 --> 22:17.120
you know ampersand mentions that it like the social group

22:17.120 --> 22:21.520
being very more similar to gorillas than like monogamous humans

22:21.520 --> 22:24.880
and their ancestors were also like strictly herbivorous which is part of

22:24.880 --> 22:28.800
why humans are so like ah okay just like i kind of imagine like

22:28.800 --> 22:33.280
if humans had evolved as like strict natural vegetarians and then

22:33.280 --> 22:36.640
coming in contact with aliens that ate animals that would just

22:36.640 --> 22:40.240
be like oh my god that's awful but i guess that's more subtext than

22:40.240 --> 22:43.600
anything at the beginning of part four korra mentioned she can hear better

22:43.600 --> 22:47.200
infliction even a slight accent with ampersand's voice

22:47.200 --> 22:51.440
uh why does she hear it clearer before the bond i think that's just because

22:51.920 --> 22:57.200
that doesn't really have anything to do with bonding that's just he improved the

22:57.200 --> 23:00.640
the text to talk speech to sound more natural

23:00.640 --> 23:04.480
he did not create that software that's just mac and talk and he figured out how

23:04.480 --> 23:08.320
to like you know apply it to an earbud that he made but

23:08.320 --> 23:11.040
really it's just over the course of the novel he improves his serie that

23:11.040 --> 23:15.440
doesn't really have anything to do with uh any mystical et soul bonds

23:15.440 --> 23:18.320
having gotten to the end and read the special thanks i have to ask is this

23:18.320 --> 23:22.480
novel a low-key starscream fanfic i get that a lot and it's kind of a

23:22.480 --> 23:27.360
weird question to me because i think on a personality level ampersand and

23:27.360 --> 23:33.120
starscream have nothing in common i'm stupid i'm stupid

23:33.120 --> 23:36.320
i guess they are both kind of jerks but like they're you know they're very

23:36.320 --> 23:39.360
different characters um ampersand was not in any way

23:39.360 --> 23:42.880
inspired by starscream i'd say obelisk was a little though there is a hidden

23:42.880 --> 23:45.120
starscream in there i've seen one person catch it

23:45.120 --> 23:48.160
how much of you is in korra and what other sources did you draw inspiration

23:48.160 --> 23:50.880
from her personality i guess off the top of my head not a lot

23:50.880 --> 23:54.400
to be honest like i guess we're roughly the same age

23:54.400 --> 23:58.480
but her mid-2000s experience was very different from mine

23:58.480 --> 24:01.920
and and like the way she handled things was very different from mine like she

24:01.920 --> 24:05.120
was very unambitious her family is nothing like mine

24:05.120 --> 24:09.040
i was extremely ambitious and like honestly

24:09.040 --> 24:13.920
borderline entitled like i did not know how to deal with failure like i still

24:13.920 --> 24:16.960
don't i also i also like to think i'm a lot funnier than she is

24:16.960 --> 24:20.480
like i'm more witty than she is i guess in a weird way i think

24:20.480 --> 24:25.040
i have more in common with ampersand and this sort of combination of being

24:25.040 --> 24:29.920
really controlling really emotionally unavailable and borderline authoritarian

24:29.920 --> 24:34.320
it in a weird way it's easier to pick out your similarities with an alien

24:34.320 --> 24:38.000
character because he is representing something more

24:38.000 --> 24:41.600
symbolic than just like a human character who has a regular

24:41.600 --> 24:44.800
human personality and that can be a little more difficult to suss out

24:44.800 --> 24:48.000
did you base nils off of any whistleblower in particular

24:48.000 --> 24:52.880
yes it's julian Assange he was like i could try to be like oh you know he's

24:52.880 --> 24:55.040
a combination nah it's julian Assange sorry

24:55.040 --> 24:59.520
let me backpedal that a little bit his function in the world as celebrity

24:59.520 --> 25:01.840
whistleblower is based on julian Assange his

25:01.840 --> 25:05.440
personality is not or at least it wasn't intentional whenever i was

25:05.440 --> 25:09.040
writing it way back in the day i like went way out of my way to

25:09.040 --> 25:12.640
not research just on his life or i didn't want to read any interviews he'd

25:12.640 --> 25:16.160
done i didn't want to know about him as a person because i didn't want

25:16.160 --> 25:19.680
nils's personality to be based off of julian Assange

25:19.680 --> 25:22.880
but inadvertently they definitely ended up having a lot in common

25:22.880 --> 25:27.280
bless you for not killing the dogs and also for letting us know they were safe

25:27.280 --> 25:33.440
i'll say this i will never kill a dog in a book that is the lindsey ellis

25:33.440 --> 25:38.560
promise did you intentionally starve korra so she had to eat the whole plate

25:38.560 --> 25:42.720
i ate the whole plate someone on twitter was like if there's no whole plate joke

25:42.720 --> 25:44.880
in there i'm gonna be really disappointed and i just kind of was

25:44.880 --> 25:48.800
like oh yeah that'd be funny so i just push it put it in there on a whim i

25:48.800 --> 25:52.560
didn't really think about it and so now half of my twitter mentions are about

25:52.560 --> 25:58.000
how you put the whole plate in there the whole plate the whole plate

25:58.000 --> 26:01.280
what was the inspiration for ampersand's appearance would you ever consider

26:01.280 --> 26:04.240
official art getting made i keep wanting to the inspiration is

26:04.240 --> 26:08.080
sort of like this combination of um like just things i like to look at

26:08.080 --> 26:11.440
things i find inherently like appealing not necessarily beautiful like

26:11.440 --> 26:14.960
just striking i guess like i really like spiders

26:14.960 --> 26:19.040
um i really like praying mantises we have a bunch of pet spiders and mantises

26:19.040 --> 26:22.640
and also this sort of like hypothetical evolutionary ancestor of like

26:22.640 --> 26:26.080
what does a bipedal herbivore look like because um

26:26.080 --> 26:29.280
and maybe you'll have things like kangaroos or iguanodons

26:29.280 --> 26:33.440
so i guess like structurally it's sort of a combination of like an iguanodon

26:33.440 --> 26:36.640
and a dragon also because i just i like dragons

26:36.640 --> 26:39.680
like if there's a dragon in a book there's a dragon in a thing

26:39.680 --> 26:44.000
i'm here i'm here for that dragon is the is it a good dragon is it a bad dragon

26:44.000 --> 26:48.560
is is it are we dragon shifters or are we are we riding dragons are we fighting

26:48.560 --> 26:52.080
dragons i don't care i'm i'm i'm here for those dragons that's

26:52.080 --> 26:54.400
part of why there's there's something a little draconian

26:54.400 --> 26:57.760
in the way that they look not draconian dragon like

26:57.760 --> 27:01.600
that was another word i got dinged for like no that's not what draconian means

27:01.600 --> 27:05.120
and there was also incorporating like insectoid and arachnoid

27:05.120 --> 27:08.480
characteristics not because they felt alien well yeah because they felt alien

27:08.480 --> 27:12.320
but also just because i i i like them like they are appealing to

27:12.320 --> 27:15.840
me personally but i got a mantis in my panties

27:15.840 --> 27:19.680
okay from what i can tell korra is kind of a self-insert so in what ways is

27:19.680 --> 27:21.920
korra different from you besides her dad of course

27:21.920 --> 27:25.520
do male authors get this question i don't think she's a self-insert any more

27:25.520 --> 27:29.440
than any like everyman style protagonist is i guess as

27:29.440 --> 27:32.480
i mentioned earlier i don't really have much in common with her

27:32.480 --> 27:36.880
personality at all like she's good with kids i am not you

27:36.880 --> 27:40.320
know despite being an oldest her way of coping with the world is to kind of fade

27:40.320 --> 27:43.760
into the background you know she's a she's more of a water

27:43.760 --> 27:47.200
sign i guess she's kind of conflict averse i am very

27:47.200 --> 27:51.920
confrontational i guess she's she's latina i'm not she's

27:51.920 --> 27:56.160
catholic i'm not um never had any problems you know

27:56.160 --> 28:00.080
supporting myself never had to move back in with my family

28:00.080 --> 28:02.960
never had this sort of contentious relationship with my parents

28:02.960 --> 28:06.640
certainly never called them by their first name

28:06.640 --> 28:09.520
like you have everyman characters that are kind of a fish out of water because

28:09.520 --> 28:11.920
like they need the world explained to them

28:11.920 --> 28:16.080
some of the time and you know that is a really common thing especially in genre

28:16.080 --> 28:17.680
fiction you know but that doesn't mean they're

28:17.680 --> 28:21.280
self-insert it just just means that the reader needs an entry point and i guess

28:21.280 --> 28:25.440
i kind of wonder like if if if if korra in commercial

28:25.440 --> 28:30.000
fiction is considered a blank slate what wouldn't be how many dicks does

28:30.000 --> 28:32.720
ampersand have

28:34.560 --> 28:42.800
that's a complicated question um bex living in a post natural body and

28:42.800 --> 28:49.360
being born sterile um he doesn't have any um reproductive organs but if he

28:49.360 --> 28:52.640
did he wouldn't have a penis it would be a novapositor

28:52.640 --> 28:56.160
but i guess the corollary to that is uh he does have some limited

28:56.160 --> 29:00.320
shape-shifting ability obviously so i guess it depends on how

29:00.320 --> 29:04.400
creative he wants to get he could have infinite well not

29:04.400 --> 29:07.280
infinite but as many as you can fit did i imagine a parallel between the

29:07.280 --> 29:09.360
hospital scene at the end of axiom's end and

29:09.360 --> 29:13.040
the end of twilight well i mean you can make all the parallels you want

29:13.040 --> 29:17.440
like you know and i have seen this a lot it wasn't intentional but i guess the

29:17.440 --> 29:22.960
other thing i would say about that is uh you know convalescent scenes are pretty

29:22.960 --> 29:27.680
common at the end of thrillers um because you know if someone gets hurt

29:27.680 --> 29:30.800
a lot of times the denouement will take place in a hospital

29:30.800 --> 29:34.480
um like you know even bright ends in a hospital

29:34.480 --> 29:40.080
uh like uh the prequel to this uh futuristic violence and fancy suits

29:40.080 --> 29:44.400
ends with a very similar convalescent scenes like very actually

29:44.400 --> 29:47.200
similar um so i just say like yeah but i would

29:47.200 --> 29:50.480
also argue that ending thrillers in hospitals is not at

29:50.480 --> 29:53.120
all uncommon was it always the plan to end the first

29:53.120 --> 29:56.080
book in the way that you did i thought the last line was fantastic and it left

29:56.080 --> 29:59.040
a really strong impression you know that's funny because i get

29:59.040 --> 30:01.920
really mixed reactions on the on the ending

30:01.920 --> 30:05.680
i i was kind of surprised by that because i yes the ending was always

30:05.680 --> 30:10.240
exactly what it was like there there was always a bondy moment at the

30:10.240 --> 30:14.640
end of act two beginning of act three and this conversation that they have in

30:14.640 --> 30:18.560
the convalescent stage in the hospital basically you know

30:18.560 --> 30:23.280
where normally you know et leaves at the end of the book he decides to stay

30:23.280 --> 30:27.360
and yes that was even from like super early first draft that was always the

30:27.360 --> 30:29.840
ending um and i guess the thing that surprised

30:29.840 --> 30:32.400
me is like some people really were like yes

30:32.400 --> 30:36.000
what a great ending and some people were like wow that was so abrupt that just

30:36.000 --> 30:41.360
ended and i was like yeah i guess i you know i was i was kind of surprised by

30:41.360 --> 30:45.200
the people who thought it was abrupt because i in my mind i was like

30:45.200 --> 30:46.880
it was very very set up

30:50.000 --> 30:56.240
my friend's ex-boyfriend's roommate had a pug named monster truck and i

30:56.240 --> 30:57.200
thought that was funny

31:01.040 --> 31:04.800
sort of so a civilian is not going to travel

31:04.800 --> 31:08.160
your friend or group is kind of an outlier and should not be counted

31:08.160 --> 31:11.680
generally similars or in emperor stan's case an individual that is

31:11.680 --> 31:16.000
stolen from basically the body of a similar are the ones that

31:16.000 --> 31:19.280
explore because those are the bodies that are built to

31:19.280 --> 31:23.040
withstand different planetary like gravities and air pressure and stuff

31:23.040 --> 31:25.760
like that but being these sort of cyborg things

31:25.760 --> 31:29.920
they don't need a lot of room they can just kind of go into stasis for you know

31:29.920 --> 31:33.520
years and decades on end so yes they do have starships but they

31:33.520 --> 31:37.600
kind of would more look like you know an apollo capsule like they're

31:37.600 --> 31:41.280
really really small means that you know requires less thrust

31:41.280 --> 31:45.440
to get up to light speed and and that is its whole own complicated thing if you

31:45.440 --> 31:48.640
want to talk about like you know thrust and energy and getting up to

31:48.640 --> 31:52.400
light speed and why that is impossible and why that would need so much energy

31:52.400 --> 31:54.480
after a certain point so yeah despite the fact that their

31:54.480 --> 31:56.400
bodies are pretty big their starships are

31:56.400 --> 32:00.880
pretty small the majority of the mass is going to be

32:00.880 --> 32:04.240
devoted to uh energy and energy production

32:04.240 --> 32:07.280
the actual living spaces are really really small but the ones that are here

32:07.280 --> 32:10.960
are not on earth they are safely away in orbit where humans cannot fuck with them

32:10.960 --> 32:14.320
aside from ampersand who is your favorite monster boyfriend

32:14.320 --> 32:20.960
i mean come on it's the beast he fell and i landed on my ampersand was

32:20.960 --> 32:23.840
surprised at the speed humans had advanced in a few hundred years

32:23.840 --> 32:27.920
was the precursor species to amygdala slower than humans in that regard

32:27.920 --> 32:31.280
they were definitely slower they were way slower and uh

32:31.280 --> 32:34.480
part of that is sort of like nature related

32:34.480 --> 32:38.800
one of the sort of dynamics is uh ampersand being really surprised that

32:38.800 --> 32:44.400
we go to space not because we have to do it to survive which is what

32:44.400 --> 32:49.840
their ancestors did they only kind of started exploring um space as a as a

32:49.840 --> 32:53.520
need for survival um meanwhile humans do it because it's

32:53.520 --> 32:56.560
there you know because and that's just very like why would you

32:56.560 --> 33:00.000
do something so dangerous if you didn't absolutely have to

33:00.000 --> 33:03.360
and they're also kind of like naturally less competitive they're much more

33:03.360 --> 33:08.640
risk averse you know meanwhile humans are just so dumb like

33:09.520 --> 33:12.480
so it's not necessarily that they were less

33:12.480 --> 33:16.080
problem-solving but like the things that make humans

33:16.080 --> 33:19.120
the things that made our technology turbocharged like

33:19.120 --> 33:23.200
being really competitive and being really risk-takey

33:23.200 --> 33:26.240
um they didn't really have so that's part of why

33:26.240 --> 33:30.880
they were a lot slower uh advancing wise why they would have

33:30.880 --> 33:36.160
advanced over a period of like from developing writing to you know

33:36.160 --> 33:43.120
cracking the space barrier would be like 20 30 000 years as opposed to our

33:43.120 --> 33:47.520
six-ish five six thousand years was the genome's fake plan from the start or did

33:47.520 --> 33:52.640
you side on it later yes uh very first draft genome died

33:52.640 --> 33:56.160
do you have an era appropriate song for your couple ship i don't know

33:56.160 --> 34:00.160
my instinct is like some cheesy 80s song like

34:00.560 --> 34:05.040
this who funds nils or does he sell merch like

34:05.040 --> 34:08.960
gay frog pills um he's not to the gay frog pills

34:08.960 --> 34:12.960
stage of his career yet i wouldn't put it past him but right now he's funded by

34:12.960 --> 34:16.400
donations i'm curious about the moment ampersand and korra's feelings changed i

34:16.400 --> 34:19.760
have a solid idea for korra but less solid for ampersand

34:19.760 --> 34:24.320
was it realizing she was also afraid of her own government yeah

34:24.320 --> 34:27.840
actually i think yeah because i think that is like uh the most

34:27.840 --> 34:31.760
traumatizing thing that ever happened to him was like being expelled from the

34:31.760 --> 34:35.840
body politic you devoted your life to how do you feel about fan fiction and

34:35.840 --> 34:38.720
fan art of your work which fan art has been most like your

34:38.720 --> 34:43.280
vision um i feel positively about it i support it but i also feel like i

34:43.280 --> 34:47.120
shouldn't comment on it because um you know i don't want to be like this

34:47.120 --> 34:51.840
person is correct but you you know i think whatever you have in

34:51.840 --> 34:55.600
your head is valid like you know your vision of the thing

34:55.600 --> 34:59.040
that i wrote is it's not wrong although i guess my main

34:59.040 --> 35:02.000
differentiation from in the fan art that i've seen it's like

35:02.000 --> 35:06.480
the little i've seen of obelisk has him darker than um the rest of them like no

35:06.480 --> 35:09.600
they're all the same color they're all kind of this silvery white thing

35:09.600 --> 35:14.400
um and uh ampersand has a really big head

35:14.400 --> 35:17.920
relative to like the rest of his body who are some of korra's favorite music

35:17.920 --> 35:21.200
artists and songs um which of them would ampersand find

35:21.200 --> 35:25.200
interesting or intriguing well to the latter half of the question

35:25.200 --> 35:28.480
none of them they'd all kind of sound the same to him but for korra's favorites

35:28.480 --> 35:31.600
i actually have a playlist for that and i'll link it in the description is

35:31.600 --> 35:35.200
the similarity in concept between awoken and axioms and coincidental

35:35.200 --> 35:38.400
did you find that your experience writing a human girl eldritch horror

35:38.400 --> 35:42.960
romance translated well i get yeah i guess it's sort of like

35:42.960 --> 35:46.960
awoken was the i was when you do an ironic version of a thing you kind of

35:46.960 --> 35:49.920
want to take seriously and not just me because i think like

35:49.920 --> 35:53.440
you know lisa's book is has similar to mine in a lot of ways

35:53.440 --> 35:57.840
especially with its relation to awoken we had a jokey joke version of a

35:57.840 --> 36:00.320
thing where we eventually wrote a book that

36:00.320 --> 36:11.920
took a similar concept and took it seriously

36:11.920 --> 36:15.440
would you like to write a meeting between korra and her dad

36:15.440 --> 36:18.640
they will meet eventually will a member of either of the two absent

36:18.640 --> 36:22.240
space-faring species sister species species x appear in the sequel

36:22.240 --> 36:26.080
and will we acquire names for those species yes and yes

36:26.080 --> 36:29.040
well they'll appear in this series let's leave it at that

36:29.040 --> 36:31.680
will korra's linguist skills become relevant in the sequel it seems a little

36:31.680 --> 36:34.640
odd that the protagonist is a linguist and yet she never has to do any of the

36:34.640 --> 36:37.440
translating thanks to ampersand's auto translator

36:37.440 --> 36:41.040
well a linguist is not a translator first of all those are two

36:41.040 --> 36:44.480
very different things but the main reason i had her

36:44.480 --> 36:48.320
like have a very rudimentary understanding of linguistics is i wanted

36:48.320 --> 36:52.160
her to be able to put words to just how

36:52.160 --> 36:56.000
little we understood and how for the most part

36:56.000 --> 37:00.480
the study of human linguistics doesn't really apply to alien linguistics like

37:00.480 --> 37:03.200
for instance a huge component of human linguistics is

37:03.200 --> 37:09.040
just mouth sounds and um the way uh words are constructed or syntax so it

37:09.040 --> 37:13.440
was it was less about her having a skill set that she could apply

37:13.440 --> 37:16.640
so much as her being able to put words to

37:16.640 --> 37:19.760
the sheer limitations of being able to apply

37:19.760 --> 37:22.880
human language to this hypothetical alien language

37:22.880 --> 37:26.400
i had the pleasure of experiencing your novel through the excellent audiobook

37:26.400 --> 37:29.840
reading performed by stephanie willis and oliver thorn will they be reprising

37:29.840 --> 37:33.760
their roles in the sequel um probably although the sequel will

37:33.760 --> 37:37.920
have uh three readers i hope i think is there anything you had

37:37.920 --> 37:40.240
to cut from axiom's and that will be in the sequel

37:40.240 --> 37:43.600
um it's mostly world building stuff there was some stuff in earlier drafts

37:43.680 --> 37:47.520
that was a reveal in the first book but i realized would be a more powerful

37:47.520 --> 37:50.160
reveal in later books and then there's just some like world

37:50.160 --> 37:53.120
building stuff like the conversation on gender

37:53.120 --> 37:56.240
got shunted into later books so yeah i mean

37:56.240 --> 37:59.680
not a whole lot it was mostly world building is there smut in book two or

37:59.680 --> 38:04.240
are you going to make us wait longer yes

38:04.560 --> 38:07.840
but whatever you're thinking you're probably wrong

38:07.840 --> 38:11.040
since bush resigned who's the next president going to be

38:11.040 --> 38:14.480
well it's dick cheney it was kind of surreal because i had to

38:14.480 --> 38:20.640
type the words president cheney like at least a dozen times would irl kaveh get

38:20.640 --> 38:25.360
along with book kaveh um yes uh but

38:25.360 --> 38:30.640
mostly because both iterations uh kind of get along with everybody joke

38:30.640 --> 38:34.800
question when is korra gonna get it in already

38:35.600 --> 38:41.600
so let me just say of like the uh beta readers editors and agents who

38:41.600 --> 38:45.120
have read the sequel um eyebrows have been raised is it

38:45.120 --> 38:48.080
easier to write a sequel having established a core cast and

38:48.080 --> 38:51.520
concept are the answers to narrative questions or problems more obvious

38:51.520 --> 38:57.360
in my experience it was so much easier part of that was because i kind of came

38:57.360 --> 39:00.640
up with the concept for the sequel before i came up

39:00.640 --> 39:04.720
were really nailed the concept for the first one because in my mind

39:04.800 --> 39:09.920
the first one is mostly set up to me um i know i know like the meet cute people

39:09.920 --> 39:13.120
will always kind of like that the most but like really the

39:13.120 --> 39:15.920
first one was like set up for where i wanted to go

39:15.920 --> 39:19.120
the sequel has two point of view characters instead of one

39:19.120 --> 39:22.560
and um i for some reason found that made it

39:22.560 --> 39:26.160
so much easier like being able to hop from different points of view and also

39:26.160 --> 39:29.200
just having done it before you have a much better idea of your process

39:29.200 --> 39:33.040
so yeah i found the sequel so much easier to write than the first one

39:33.040 --> 39:36.880
will sloop john b make an actual appearance in the future

39:36.880 --> 39:40.880
yes could we expect a sequel to follow korra and ampersand or some new

39:40.880 --> 39:43.920
characters both straightforward question are we

39:43.920 --> 39:46.560
looking at a time skip between books if so how long

39:46.560 --> 39:50.560
yes small time skip uh about three months when did you start planning

39:50.560 --> 39:54.080
and writing the sequel to axiom's end again before the first book was even

39:54.080 --> 39:56.880
written and i guess after the second one comes

39:56.880 --> 40:01.200
out i guess i could talk about like what it was because primarily it was like it

40:01.200 --> 40:04.960
was a character dynamic thing but mainly it was just this sort of

40:04.960 --> 40:08.640
like broad premise idea of how does society cope

40:08.640 --> 40:16.000
with this first contact scenario um where the world doesn't end but also

40:16.000 --> 40:20.160
nobody really has any information like how does society cope with that and i

40:20.160 --> 40:22.240
guess that was the thing that interested me more

40:22.240 --> 40:26.160
than um anything that's really in the first book are we going to be seeing

40:26.160 --> 40:31.120
more of that asshole journalist kave uh

40:31.120 --> 40:35.680
i guess yeah here's the biggest spoiler of all yes

40:35.680 --> 40:41.840
um kave is not only a major character in the second book he is also the second

40:41.840 --> 40:46.240
point of view character and that's my big reveal and yeah and

40:46.240 --> 40:48.640
so i guess for those of you who listens to my podcast

40:48.640 --> 40:52.880

40:52.880 --> 40:55.680
