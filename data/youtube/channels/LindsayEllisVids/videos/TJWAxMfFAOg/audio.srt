00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Good afternoon! I hope everyone is having a lovely war on Christmas.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,400
If you're anything like me, you're all dressed up with nowhere to go.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,840
Literally the first Christmas where I don't get to see my family

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:20,160
in all of my 36 years on this earth. Yeah, I'm fine with that.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,880
This episode was brought to you by my publisher asking

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,640
when I'm going to do a content of promoting my book before Christmas.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,080
Just under the wire. You can see it right here along with some other

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:40,480
gift ideas for the SFF fan in your life. It's only mostly

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,880
extremely nepotistic. I had a run-in with the oven if you're

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,680
wondering. So I wanted to do a Q&A for a while but

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,880
the thing about books is they take a lot longer to get through than

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,440
movies and generally when they're released it's not like everybody reads

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,600
it all in the same week. It's a very slow burn.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,640
But it's been about five months so I figured I can

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,920
break this down into a no spoiler discussion or at least what I

16
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,720
consider no spoilers. Like if it's if it's in the

17
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,960
you know blurb on the jacket then it doesn't count as spoilers.

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,960
Spoilers section where I actually talk about the content of the book in a

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,720
spoilery way. Finally sequel stuff at the end and I

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,520
don't want to say it'll be spoilery but it would be like on the level of stuff

21
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,200
that you read like on the jacket blurb which incidentally has not been written

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,040
yet. So the way I did this was through

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,520
Twitter because that required the least amount of effort on my part.

24
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,280
What software did you use to write slash organize all the world building going on?

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,720
Is it a bunch of Google Docs? More specialized things with Scrivener?

26
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,360
Both. I use Google Docs for a lot of it like especially keeping track of like

27
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,560
timelines. Like there's like I guess sort of the

28
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,720
macro timeline of um you know alien civilization and when

29
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,520
we hit what milestone like becoming spacefaring becoming interstellar

30
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,760
you know becoming post-natural and then there's the micro timelines like

31
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,480
you know the human family trees and when so and so was born and what year they

32
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,560
were born and when they went to school and how they met.

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,400
But mainly I use Scrivener. I just have to have a really clear road map before I

34
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,960
actually do it and I use Scrivener for that and I find

35
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,720
Scrivener very good for organizing massive projects especially one

36
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,600
like this that is like a combination of epistolary novel and

37
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,600
uh regular prose novel because I have to categorize the different sections

38
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,280
especially in the sequel which has multiple points of view. In your video

39
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,680
talking about your book deal you mentioned reasons why it didn't sell in

40
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,440
it having to do with publishing trends. Would it be a spoiler for the sequel if

41
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,880
you went into those reasons now? No. But generally when we talk about

42
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,680
publishing trends publishers want something that is

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,880
similar to something that has already done well

44
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,880
because like Hank Green's book uh An Absolutely Remarkable Thing was like

45
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,720
the only comp we had when we had on submission. Besides his book there

46
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,120
weren't really any other you know best-selling sci-fi

47
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,360
novels that were also sort of contemporary

48
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,760
real world grounded type stuff. Publishers want to buy things that are

49
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,320
similar to things that have done well within the

50
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,880
last five years and um in terms of like commercial

51
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,360
science fiction there weren't a lot that were similar.

52
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,400
Did you deliberately set out to write basically the book Transformer should

53
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,040
have been? I mean if you're talking about the movie

54
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:32,560
uh maybe. I feel like so much of my adult life has

55
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,320
been shaped by frustration with Michael Bay and I

56
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,160
think like one of the things that like I kind of got obsessed with with the first

57
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,040
Transformers movie after it came out was that

58
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,960
it did kind of set up a really interesting premise which was that

59
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,400
okay aliens show up but the world doesn't end what now?

60
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,320
Especially after the second one um the the worst one

61
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,600
arguably no actually I think maybe they're all really bad but like the

62
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,960
second one ends with like the fallen being like we're here we're

63
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,320
queer we're gonna kill you but then you know the world doesn't end

64
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,960
so like what then and they kind of they kind of tiptoe up to like doing

65
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,160
something interesting with it like how in the third movie there's like

66
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,720
you know John Turturro hanging out with Transformer refugees in Cuba.

67
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,360
Buy my book! Buy my book! I think it is also very fair to say that

68
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,480
uh a lot of it was shaped by frustration with Mr. Bay's Transformers franchise.

69
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,680
When describing Korra's outfits did you try to create an iconic look

70
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,080
for a potential adaptation? Yeah sort of what I thought were the most

71
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,160
visually I don't know 50s b-movie scenes. I keep

72
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,880
describing this uh tiered chiffon maxi dress from the

73
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,040
1970s and um I don't know why I decided to go with

74
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,080
that and not something more like you know 1950s um

75
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,600
but I think it was just it was kind of like a janky

76
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,720
like a janky version of that um you know something white and flowing and damsel

77
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,920
but also like cheap and polyester in 70s. When will

78
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,040
you write an omegaverse novel? I don't think I need to someone already

79
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,680
wrote an omegaverse axioms in fanfic. It's on AO3. No I haven't read it I'm

80
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,720
not allowed. In regards to Korra's experience with linguistics in college

81
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,720
have you ever taken any linguistics courses?

82
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,120
Yes at NYU I had what they call a um concentration

83
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,800
which is what it is when you don't have enough credits for a

84
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,280
minor but you had enough where they're like

85
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,360
ah we could put that on the degree somewhere whatever. Axioms in ready read

86
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,720
very much like the natural disaster films of the 90s. How much of this was

87
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,280
intentional? I didn't really set out to do that but I guess

88
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,480
some of that was inevitable because so much of like the plot and the structure

89
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,040
and the character dynamics was very much inspired by movies like that

90
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,320
and like towards the end of the process like after the book sold and while we

91
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,200
were in revisions like I kind of allowed myself license to

92
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,120
just like go all in on it. I've seen Independence Day probably more times

93
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,440
than I've seen any other movie. Let's just own it you know and it's like

94
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,080
there's a lot of Men in Black in there um

95
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,680
there's a lot of Invader Zim in there it's sort of like which is which is

96
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,560
funny because I saw that Jonan Vasquez posted like

97
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,840
check out my book haul and that was in it and I was like oh no

98
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,000
Pathetic humans fleeing in terror at the sight of Zim!

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,920
Nobody even looking at you! It's a show of respect!

100
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,840
Their stupid eyes can't handle all these!

101
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,040
Because I was watching the new Invader Zim movie uh

102
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,200
Enter the Florpus and as I was watching it I was like holy shit I forgot

103
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,880
how much Invader Zim um kind of crept into like the world

104
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,600
building it's almost sort of like uh Invader Zim played straight like

105
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,400
which I'm sure Jonan Vasquez would be horrified by

106
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,240
like even even uh Kaylee Donaldson of Pajiba pointed this out

107
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,840
it's sort of like ampersand is almost like a if Invader Zim

108
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,480
was competent but where are the flames I can't rule the world without cool

109
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,920
flames shooting up behind me

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,720
now that it's out can you talk about what it was like watching bumblebee with

111
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,600
this in your pocket bumblebee came out right before

112
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,280
the book went on submission I loved bumblebee because it was you know

113
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,480
the Transformers movie so the only good Transformers movie but it had a lot of

114
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,160
similarities and when I was watching it with uh Lisa for the first

115
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,880
time this one um she we were in the movie

116
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,760
theater and she just kind of like whispers to me like

117
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,520
this is a lot like your book and I'm like oh it's

118
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,640
they stole my idea not the other way around but the but the really funny

119
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,640
thing was uh when we were um the first blurb

120
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,920
Saint Martin's Press sent me that was like the cover copy

121
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,520
this thing it basically like it read it read

122
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,680
like the plot of bumblebee so much that it included things that were

123
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,600
in the movie bumblebee but were not in my book

124
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,120
for instance like we are being pursued by

125
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,360
like evil John Cena it's like but no that's not the plot that's not what

126
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,320
happens oh my god if the Axiom Zen series was adapted for

127
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,280
tv would you rather see it made into live action or animated

128
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,800
I don't know it depends on who's making it if it was animated I feel like it

129
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,160
would have to be like either anime or anime style you know

130
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,960
because it should feel a little aged up but yeah I

131
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,680
don't know I think I think that really depends on who's at the helm

132
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,080
and what the budget is because I think the thing is like if it was animated

133
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,680
for the content that it is it would probably be cheaper than live action

134
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,040
because like geez I I kind of doubt we're ever going to see

135
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,640
a live action version what language slang phrase do you use often that was

136
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,040
off limits due to the period setting that you chose

137
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,840
the truth is um I was a lot more careful about that for the sequel like I have an

138
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,680
entire thread that was neologisms that I started to write but had to cut

139
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,960
and I guess they would tend to be like internet thing like

140
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:00,640
uh you know like we can't use doge like much alien very invasion or stuff

141
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,960
like that even though that's already dated I also

142
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,480
kind of had a problem of like sort of in the opposite direction of like language

143
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,400
that was a really common then um but is like considered super

144
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,960
problematic now like as a for instance um like I think I had a

145
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,760
uh a scene where Felix Cora's brother calls something gay

146
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,160
in like a derogatory way which you know a 13 year old in 2007

147
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,200
absolutely would have um but like you know

148
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,640
we had these conversations about like do we want to be true to the period or keep

149
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,320
in mind who's reading it now and you know defaulted to the who's reading

150
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,000
it now even though it is accurate that doesn't mean it needs to be there

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,280
do you think your history of doing video essays will influence more folks to make

152
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,720
video essays analyzing your work is that an exciting prospect or a

153
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,360
dreadful one I mean I guess it's not really relevant to me because I

154
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
wouldn't watch it I don't I don't think it's

155
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,040
fair I get that not all authors are like that but I think just from an ethical

156
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,480
standpoint I shouldn't engage with stuff like that

157
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,680
like that's not for me that's for other people to have

158
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,520
discussions that said I think it would be more

159
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,640
likely for me if only because the type of viewer I have and the type of

160
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,120
audience I have is more likely to be interested

161
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,200
in video essays how much of your theories did you have done before it

162
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,720
queried I mean I had definitely had it mapped out by the time it sold

163
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,960
and we pitched them five and they bought one and they bought two more after the

164
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,200
pre-sale numbers for the first one came in so

165
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,880
thanks for that so basically three out of five are under contract and whether I

166
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,880
get to finish it I guess is contingent on how well the first three

167
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,080
do so a question for everyone else who has

168
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,600
read the book does everyone envision Lindsay as Cora while reading this

169
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,280
and if so what is Lindsay's opinion of this that sucks honestly

170
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,480
you know this is like something that most authors don't have to deal with

171
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,520
so I guess as an author I would like to die I would

172
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:55,440
like for people not to be thinking of me and other things that I've done

173
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,720
while they're reading it but obviously like you know like I say death of the

174
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,800
author for the most part is not a very applicable to the real world

175
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,160
theory that's just not realistic where do we send fan letters

176
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,160
um here this is my business email super early but what's your dream cast and

177
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,680
director for an adaptation Christian Slater would make a great

178
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,800
Nels oh yeah that would be I never thought of that yeah he'd be

179
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,480
perfect the only casting that I thought was kind of a good idea was

180
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,800
Pedro Pascal as Nels but you know we probably couldn't afford him

181
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,400
what build is Cora and Oblivion dark elf

182
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,000
uh mage but also she doesn't really like Oblivion because Oblivion sucks she

183
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:47,520
prefers Morrowind because it's better

184
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,520
should I read Axiom's end no it depends on what you're into

185
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,400
in your how to get a book deal video you said your agent pinpointed the issue

186
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,800
with why agents thought they could not sell this

187
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,520
and you fixed and suggested that you might share one day are you ready to

188
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,880
share it now are you ready one weird trick that

189
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,200
was keeping me from getting a literary agent was

190
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,120
Cora's age in the original draft she was 19 not 21 and you might be

191
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,200
thinking oh well really what

192
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,120
so the first chapter in the final version she's at work she's a temp

193
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,280
uh and she's dropped out of college but in the first draft she was in school she

194
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,600
was like it you know in college rather than

195
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,520
at work and so that first chapter felt a little too ya curious so it's not

196
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,160
really a deal breaker for like character age in genre fiction

197
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,480
it's more just like how it's presented and so the fact that she was

198
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,560
a little she was young and the first chapter was at school

199
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,920
felt a little too ya curious and so we aged her up

200
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,040
and that was it adding two years to her age

201
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,640
what advice would you give to beginner slash novice writers

202
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,920
for one thing don't make my mistake and over revise

203
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,600
i think another is um once you get to the editorial phase

204
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,320
except that most editorial notes are suggestions they're not mandatory

205
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,840
and editors don't expect you to incorporate

206
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,360
all of them let alone even most of them depending on the notes would you agree

207
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,480
that axiom sin falls within the horse girl genre

208
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,840
yeah since the setting is irl does that mean that lindsay ellis exists in the

209
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,000
universe of the setting you know i'm gonna go with no i'm just

210
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,720
gonna keep it simple no i was never born in this universe

211
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,480
the green brothers exist though what part of axiom sins were you unsure about

212
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,320
but you found turned out really well i guess sort of the dynamic between the

213
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,600
two leads i didn't know if people would buy into it

214
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,440
and that was kind of another reason why i was so

215
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,880
squirrelly about the actual content of the book um

216
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,000
because i didn't want to market it on almost sort of like this

217
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,880
borderline romance because publishing be sexist and i

218
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,000
but you know by that same token it's not for everybody

219
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,040
like it is a hard definitely not for everybody

220
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,560
and so i think the result is that a lot of people read it based on this sort of

221
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,200
like government conspiracy thriller blurb

222
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,200
that probably would not have if they knew that the

223
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,120
main substance of the book is not that and i guess the people that

224
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,680
did like it you know responded to it in the way that i was hoping so

225
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,960
i guess that but by that same token again

226
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,440
not for everybody the physicality of the aliens feels very vivid and visceral

227
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,240
while thinking of their anatomy what kind of visual and material references

228
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,880
did you make for yourself did you settle on their general shape

229
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,880
from the start or was it a longer process

230
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,160
it was kind of both because it's like i always had an idea of the

231
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,080
general shape that was always there from the very beginning but the details

232
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,760
um changed a lot and kind of only really settled towards the end

233
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,560
with the various characters having different opinions on the truth is a

234
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,080
human right debate where on that spectrum do you fall

235
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,760
uh regrettably i think i'm probably a centrist

236
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:03,200
what i think is what is true matters not as much as how the truth is

237
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,120
framed because any truth can be weaponized

238
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,880
but on the whole i think like it's it's more complicated than just

239
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,560
full transparency because you know again any true thing

240
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,960
can be framed in a way that ultimately furthers a uh completely

241
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,040
unrelated political agenda are you a pantser plotter or in between

242
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,080
hard plotter um outlined a lot do you naturally write in third person

243
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,960
or was this a choice made specifically for this book

244
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,880
was first person ever considered no i don't know i think in a weird way

245
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,440
first person feels more stylistic to me than third person for some reason

246
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,600
i guess if it's if it's in in my head anyway if it's in first person i feel

247
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,040
like there needs to be a narrative reason

248
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,520
like who is this person telling this story to and why

249
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,560
and i know logically that doesn't make any sense like third person is

250
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,240
just as much of a stylistic choice but i guess if i was going to write in first

251
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,080
person i would need there to be a reason like a narrative reason of like why this

252
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,720
person is telling their story how do you think your experience in

253
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,920
screenwriting influenced the novel well i feel like it has a very

254
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,040
screenwriting style i i feel like my prose is very utilitarian

255
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,960
and you know that's just a taste thing some people like that some people don't

256
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,000
um also just like in terms of structuring it

257
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,680
i think more than anything the structure like basically like

258
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,120
um points of attack inciting incidents act breaks

259
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,880
um different sequences taking place in different things and having different

260
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,200
tensions um framing it like that was very

261
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,600
influenced by screenwriting and apparently that is

262
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,280
becoming increasingly common what would you change about the first book

263
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,080
and how will you be adapting what you learned in the second book there were

264
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,120
times when i i kind of deferred to um

265
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,120
editorial um i think maybe to the book's detriment where

266
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,560
you know they'd ask for certain things and i'm not gonna say what they are

267
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,320
because then you're gonna be like oh where is it

268
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,160
but like i do it and then i you know in hindsight would realize like this feels

269
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,840
kind of forced but then i'd kind of leave it

270
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,600
i think the other thing is reading it too much like reading

271
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,640
it too many times and revising it too many times i think

272
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,880
that is i think that's definitely a trap first time authors

273
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,920
fall into whereas you know it's your first time and you want it to be perfect

274
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,840
but then like uh the result is you read over the same

275
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,560
sentences over and over and over and then they just start to lose meaning and

276
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,760
then you stop being able to contrast construct a sentence that

277
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,640
um you know is is flows well i noticed a lot of criticism

278
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,600
about like the writing style especially like in the first

279
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,440
third um and i think part of the reason it does feel kind of clunky is because

280
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,360
i read it too many times and i revised it too many times

281
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,160
and the result was that like you know the the words just stop

282
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,360
carrying meaning so for the sequel for the most part when i finished a draft i

283
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,040
would just put it away and do not look at it until it came

284
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,160
back from editorial with like here's what you need to do

285
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,280
the thing is like when you're doing revisions if you've looked at the

286
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,480
sentences too many times each time you look at it it becomes

287
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,240
harder and harder to restructure it into something that like

288
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:19,440
flows better or sounds better

289
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,800
what was the biggest most surprising change from your original draft book one

290
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,760
i guess it depends on what you consider the original draft

291
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,200
when i compare the trunked version to the final version

292
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,200
a the trunked version was like way too chicken shit about the you know primary

293
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,440
relationship therefore it was very sterile

294
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,240
and very no emotions allowed and the other biggie was where the

295
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,920
exposition happened and um there would be like these big

296
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,600
exposition dumps towards the beginning um which i you

297
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,840
know upon reflection i was like holy shit this

298
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,760
you know it works so much better if like when she meets ampersand she knows

299
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,920
nothing you know and so she kind of has it's a

300
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,360
journey of discovery rather than having all the information ahead of time

301
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,800
but i guess also like in in those super early drafts

302
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,360
what kind of ended up being the meat of the book wasn't really there at all

303
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,640
so like all these sort of getting to know you chapters that happen like in

304
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,560
the middle and in the bunker just did not exist like

305
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,760
even a little with regards to the ending when

306
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,680
ampersand goes but i'm not human i was like smiley face and then frowny face

307
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,040
can't decide which feeling to have how do you view it

308
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,320
i think that's correct that's the correct response to have

309
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,480
did ampersand lie about the known number of space faring species

310
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,840
no but absolutely take everything he says with a grain of salt he obviously

311
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,000
tends to omit truths if not outright lie and there are definitely some things in

312
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,120
the first book that he lied about stop fucking lying our amygdalins and

313
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,040
their super organism the great filter no ampersand was

314
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,440
telling the truth about that there's a lot of talk in the first book

315
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,120
about like the great filter and why in a sort of statistical likelihood

316
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,640
standpoint this other intelligent civilization

317
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,200
popped up relatively close to earth like only about 100 light years away which

318
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,640
you know in the grand scheme is like really unlikely

319
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,160
but no he was telling the truth about that the superorganism is not the great

320
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,600
filter although that will be elaborated on considerably in the sequel i remember

321
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,840
that ampersand said he had two sim files was that chefo and obelisk or was he not

322
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,680
including chefo because he's dead uh that was not

323
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,360
including chefo because he's dead he has two one is obelisk the other

324
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,480
that is a really good catch of a throwaway line because it is a

325
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,040
very important throwaway line and yes that will be explored considerably

326
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,800
what were the amygdalins evolutionary ancestors like and how do they get their

327
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,560
energy since they don't eat um well they do eat a little

328
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,080
christopher pauline's new book talks about this concept of like a

329
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,520
a human shit mind which is basically like a brain that is

330
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,880
you know kind of fed nutrients constantly

331
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,800
um and in this case they can kind of almost have like a star trek replicator

332
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,400
inside their own bodies so it's kind of like that basically like

333
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,400
similar or those that exist in the bodies of a similar get their energy

334
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,840
differently from everybody else because like you know espress and all the other

335
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,600
ones they don't have like these grand superpowers then that's basically

336
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,200
uh because they uh have a different form of energy

337
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,720
but it's it's kind of same ish and the simple answer is

338
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,960
i went with uh matter antimatter fusion and as for their ancestors

339
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,480
um i don't know if i'll ever really get the opportunity to go into this because

340
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,960
i have this whole like you know what kind of star did there's

341
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,600
planet well not because like in my mind it was like a moon that

342
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:41,440
ordered like a gas giant around like a um like a like a k-type star a red giant

343
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,560
um so the atmosphere would look very different and the greenhouse effect

344
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,960
would be very different the air pressure would be different

345
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,000
um and that's sort of being like why our sun is very like yeah you know it's just

346
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,880
like way brighter than they were evolved for

347
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,040
and that's part of why their eyes are so big

348
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,200
um that and that and big eyes is cute and alien

349
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,080
i guess it's like kind of a complicated question that i always kind of have in

350
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,200
the back of my mind while writing but i don't know if it'll ever actually make

351
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,000
it to the page because it may never be relevant to

352
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,040
the actual prose but the simple answer is like

353
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,120
you know ampersand mentions that it like the social group

354
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,520
being very more similar to gorillas than like monogamous humans

355
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,880
and their ancestors were also like strictly herbivorous which is part of

356
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,800
why humans are so like ah okay just like i kind of imagine like

357
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,280
if humans had evolved as like strict natural vegetarians and then

358
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,640
coming in contact with aliens that ate animals that would just

359
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,240
be like oh my god that's awful but i guess that's more subtext than

360
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,600
anything at the beginning of part four korra mentioned she can hear better

361
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,200
infliction even a slight accent with ampersand's voice

362
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,440
uh why does she hear it clearer before the bond i think that's just because

363
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:57,200
that doesn't really have anything to do with bonding that's just he improved the

364
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,640
the text to talk speech to sound more natural

365
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,480
he did not create that software that's just mac and talk and he figured out how

366
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,320
to like you know apply it to an earbud that he made but

367
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,040
really it's just over the course of the novel he improves his serie that

368
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,440
doesn't really have anything to do with uh any mystical et soul bonds

369
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,320
having gotten to the end and read the special thanks i have to ask is this

370
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,480
novel a low-key starscream fanfic i get that a lot and it's kind of a

371
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,360
weird question to me because i think on a personality level ampersand and

372
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:33,120
starscream have nothing in common i'm stupid i'm stupid

373
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,320
i guess they are both kind of jerks but like they're you know they're very

374
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,360
different characters um ampersand was not in any way

375
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,880
inspired by starscream i'd say obelisk was a little though there is a hidden

376
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,120
starscream in there i've seen one person catch it

377
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,160
how much of you is in korra and what other sources did you draw inspiration

378
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,880
from her personality i guess off the top of my head not a lot

379
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,400
to be honest like i guess we're roughly the same age

380
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,480
but her mid-2000s experience was very different from mine

381
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,920
and and like the way she handled things was very different from mine like she

382
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,120
was very unambitious her family is nothing like mine

383
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,040
i was extremely ambitious and like honestly

384
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,920
borderline entitled like i did not know how to deal with failure like i still

385
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,960
don't i also i also like to think i'm a lot funnier than she is

386
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,480
like i'm more witty than she is i guess in a weird way i think

387
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,040
i have more in common with ampersand and this sort of combination of being

388
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,920
really controlling really emotionally unavailable and borderline authoritarian

389
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:34,320
it in a weird way it's easier to pick out your similarities with an alien

390
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,000
character because he is representing something more

391
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,600
symbolic than just like a human character who has a regular

392
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,800
human personality and that can be a little more difficult to suss out

393
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,000
did you base nils off of any whistleblower in particular

394
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,880
yes it's julian Assange he was like i could try to be like oh you know he's

395
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,040
a combination nah it's julian Assange sorry

396
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,520
let me backpedal that a little bit his function in the world as celebrity

397
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,840
whistleblower is based on julian Assange his

398
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,440
personality is not or at least it wasn't intentional whenever i was

399
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,040
writing it way back in the day i like went way out of my way to

400
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,640
not research just on his life or i didn't want to read any interviews he'd

401
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,160
done i didn't want to know about him as a person because i didn't want

402
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,680
nils's personality to be based off of julian Assange

403
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,880
but inadvertently they definitely ended up having a lot in common

404
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,280
bless you for not killing the dogs and also for letting us know they were safe

405
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:33,440
i'll say this i will never kill a dog in a book that is the lindsey ellis

406
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,560
promise did you intentionally starve korra so she had to eat the whole plate

407
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,720
i ate the whole plate someone on twitter was like if there's no whole plate joke

408
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,880
in there i'm gonna be really disappointed and i just kind of was

409
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,800
like oh yeah that'd be funny so i just push it put it in there on a whim i

410
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,560
didn't really think about it and so now half of my twitter mentions are about

411
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:58,000
how you put the whole plate in there the whole plate the whole plate

412
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,280
what was the inspiration for ampersand's appearance would you ever consider

413
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,240
official art getting made i keep wanting to the inspiration is

414
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,080
sort of like this combination of um like just things i like to look at

415
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,440
things i find inherently like appealing not necessarily beautiful like

416
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,960
just striking i guess like i really like spiders

417
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,040
um i really like praying mantises we have a bunch of pet spiders and mantises

418
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,640
and also this sort of like hypothetical evolutionary ancestor of like

419
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,080
what does a bipedal herbivore look like because um

420
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,280
and maybe you'll have things like kangaroos or iguanodons

421
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,440
so i guess like structurally it's sort of a combination of like an iguanodon

422
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,640
and a dragon also because i just i like dragons

423
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,680
like if there's a dragon in a book there's a dragon in a thing

424
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,000
i'm here i'm here for that dragon is the is it a good dragon is it a bad dragon

425
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,560
is is it are we dragon shifters or are we are we riding dragons are we fighting

426
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,080
dragons i don't care i'm i'm i'm here for those dragons that's

427
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,400
part of why there's there's something a little draconian

428
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,760
in the way that they look not draconian dragon like

429
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,600
that was another word i got dinged for like no that's not what draconian means

430
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,120
and there was also incorporating like insectoid and arachnoid

431
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,480
characteristics not because they felt alien well yeah because they felt alien

432
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,320
but also just because i i i like them like they are appealing to

433
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,840
me personally but i got a mantis in my panties

434
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,680
okay from what i can tell korra is kind of a self-insert so in what ways is

435
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,920
korra different from you besides her dad of course

436
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,520
do male authors get this question i don't think she's a self-insert any more

437
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,440
than any like everyman style protagonist is i guess as

438
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,480
i mentioned earlier i don't really have much in common with her

439
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,880
personality at all like she's good with kids i am not you

440
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,320
know despite being an oldest her way of coping with the world is to kind of fade

441
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,760
into the background you know she's a she's more of a water

442
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,200
sign i guess she's kind of conflict averse i am very

443
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,920
confrontational i guess she's she's latina i'm not she's

444
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,160
catholic i'm not um never had any problems you know

445
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,080
supporting myself never had to move back in with my family

446
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,960
never had this sort of contentious relationship with my parents

447
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,640
certainly never called them by their first name

448
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,520
like you have everyman characters that are kind of a fish out of water because

449
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,920
like they need the world explained to them

450
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,080
some of the time and you know that is a really common thing especially in genre

451
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,680
fiction you know but that doesn't mean they're

452
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,280
self-insert it just just means that the reader needs an entry point and i guess

453
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,440
i kind of wonder like if if if if korra in commercial

454
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,000
fiction is considered a blank slate what wouldn't be how many dicks does

455
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,720
ampersand have

456
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:42,800
that's a complicated question um bex living in a post natural body and

457
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:49,360
being born sterile um he doesn't have any um reproductive organs but if he

458
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,640
did he wouldn't have a penis it would be a novapositor

459
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,160
but i guess the corollary to that is uh he does have some limited

460
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,320
shape-shifting ability obviously so i guess it depends on how

461
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,400
creative he wants to get he could have infinite well not

462
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,280
infinite but as many as you can fit did i imagine a parallel between the

463
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,360
hospital scene at the end of axiom's end and

464
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,040
the end of twilight well i mean you can make all the parallels you want

465
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,440
like you know and i have seen this a lot it wasn't intentional but i guess the

466
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,960
other thing i would say about that is uh you know convalescent scenes are pretty

467
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,680
common at the end of thrillers um because you know if someone gets hurt

468
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,800
a lot of times the denouement will take place in a hospital

469
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,480
um like you know even bright ends in a hospital

470
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,080
uh like uh the prequel to this uh futuristic violence and fancy suits

471
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,400
ends with a very similar convalescent scenes like very actually

472
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,200
similar um so i just say like yeah but i would

473
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,480
also argue that ending thrillers in hospitals is not at

474
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,120
all uncommon was it always the plan to end the first

475
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,080
book in the way that you did i thought the last line was fantastic and it left

476
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,040
a really strong impression you know that's funny because i get

477
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,920
really mixed reactions on the on the ending

478
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,680
i i was kind of surprised by that because i yes the ending was always

479
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,240
exactly what it was like there there was always a bondy moment at the

480
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,640
end of act two beginning of act three and this conversation that they have in

481
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,560
the convalescent stage in the hospital basically you know

482
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:23,280
where normally you know et leaves at the end of the book he decides to stay

483
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,360
and yes that was even from like super early first draft that was always the

484
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,840
ending um and i guess the thing that surprised

485
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,400
me is like some people really were like yes

486
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,000
what a great ending and some people were like wow that was so abrupt that just

487
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,360
ended and i was like yeah i guess i you know i was i was kind of surprised by

488
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,200
the people who thought it was abrupt because i in my mind i was like

489
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,880
it was very very set up

490
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,240
my friend's ex-boyfriend's roommate had a pug named monster truck and i

491
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,200
thought that was funny

492
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,800
sort of so a civilian is not going to travel

493
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,160
your friend or group is kind of an outlier and should not be counted

494
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,680
generally similars or in emperor stan's case an individual that is

495
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,000
stolen from basically the body of a similar are the ones that

496
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,280
explore because those are the bodies that are built to

497
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,040
withstand different planetary like gravities and air pressure and stuff

498
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,760
like that but being these sort of cyborg things

499
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,920
they don't need a lot of room they can just kind of go into stasis for you know

500
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,520
years and decades on end so yes they do have starships but they

501
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,600
kind of would more look like you know an apollo capsule like they're

502
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,280
really really small means that you know requires less thrust

503
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,440
to get up to light speed and and that is its whole own complicated thing if you

504
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,640
want to talk about like you know thrust and energy and getting up to

505
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,400
light speed and why that is impossible and why that would need so much energy

506
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,480
after a certain point so yeah despite the fact that their

507
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,400
bodies are pretty big their starships are

508
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,880
pretty small the majority of the mass is going to be

509
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,240
devoted to uh energy and energy production

510
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,280
the actual living spaces are really really small but the ones that are here

511
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,960
are not on earth they are safely away in orbit where humans cannot fuck with them

512
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,320
aside from ampersand who is your favorite monster boyfriend

513
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:20,960
i mean come on it's the beast he fell and i landed on my ampersand was

514
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,840
surprised at the speed humans had advanced in a few hundred years

515
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,920
was the precursor species to amygdala slower than humans in that regard

516
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,280
they were definitely slower they were way slower and uh

517
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,480
part of that is sort of like nature related

518
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,800
one of the sort of dynamics is uh ampersand being really surprised that

519
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:44,400
we go to space not because we have to do it to survive which is what

520
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:49,840
their ancestors did they only kind of started exploring um space as a as a

521
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,520
need for survival um meanwhile humans do it because it's

522
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,560
there you know because and that's just very like why would you

523
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,000
do something so dangerous if you didn't absolutely have to

524
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,360
and they're also kind of like naturally less competitive they're much more

525
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,640
risk averse you know meanwhile humans are just so dumb like

526
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,480
so it's not necessarily that they were less

527
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,080
problem-solving but like the things that make humans

528
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,120
the things that made our technology turbocharged like

529
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,200
being really competitive and being really risk-takey

530
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,240
um they didn't really have so that's part of why

531
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,880
they were a lot slower uh advancing wise why they would have

532
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,160
advanced over a period of like from developing writing to you know

533
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:43,120
cracking the space barrier would be like 20 30 000 years as opposed to our

534
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,520
six-ish five six thousand years was the genome's fake plan from the start or did

535
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,640
you side on it later yes uh very first draft genome died

536
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,160
do you have an era appropriate song for your couple ship i don't know

537
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,160
my instinct is like some cheesy 80s song like

538
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:05,040
this who funds nils or does he sell merch like

539
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,960
gay frog pills um he's not to the gay frog pills

540
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,960
stage of his career yet i wouldn't put it past him but right now he's funded by

541
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,400
donations i'm curious about the moment ampersand and korra's feelings changed i

542
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,760
have a solid idea for korra but less solid for ampersand

543
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,320
was it realizing she was also afraid of her own government yeah

544
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,840
actually i think yeah because i think that is like uh the most

545
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:31,760
traumatizing thing that ever happened to him was like being expelled from the

546
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,840
body politic you devoted your life to how do you feel about fan fiction and

547
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,720
fan art of your work which fan art has been most like your

548
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,280
vision um i feel positively about it i support it but i also feel like i

549
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,120
shouldn't comment on it because um you know i don't want to be like this

550
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,840
person is correct but you you know i think whatever you have in

551
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,600
your head is valid like you know your vision of the thing

552
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,040
that i wrote is it's not wrong although i guess my main

553
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,000
differentiation from in the fan art that i've seen it's like

554
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,480
the little i've seen of obelisk has him darker than um the rest of them like no

555
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,600
they're all the same color they're all kind of this silvery white thing

556
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:14,400
um and uh ampersand has a really big head

557
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,920
relative to like the rest of his body who are some of korra's favorite music

558
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,200
artists and songs um which of them would ampersand find

559
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,200
interesting or intriguing well to the latter half of the question

560
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,480
none of them they'd all kind of sound the same to him but for korra's favorites

561
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,600
i actually have a playlist for that and i'll link it in the description is

562
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,200
the similarity in concept between awoken and axioms and coincidental

563
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,400
did you find that your experience writing a human girl eldritch horror

564
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,960
romance translated well i get yeah i guess it's sort of like

565
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,960
awoken was the i was when you do an ironic version of a thing you kind of

566
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,920
want to take seriously and not just me because i think like

567
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,440
you know lisa's book is has similar to mine in a lot of ways

568
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,840
especially with its relation to awoken we had a jokey joke version of a

569
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,320
thing where we eventually wrote a book that

570
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:11,920
took a similar concept and took it seriously

571
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,440
would you like to write a meeting between korra and her dad

572
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,640
they will meet eventually will a member of either of the two absent

573
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,240
space-faring species sister species species x appear in the sequel

574
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,080
and will we acquire names for those species yes and yes

575
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,040
well they'll appear in this series let's leave it at that

576
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,680
will korra's linguist skills become relevant in the sequel it seems a little

577
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,640
odd that the protagonist is a linguist and yet she never has to do any of the

578
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,440
translating thanks to ampersand's auto translator

579
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,040
well a linguist is not a translator first of all those are two

580
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,480
very different things but the main reason i had her

581
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,320
like have a very rudimentary understanding of linguistics is i wanted

582
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,160
her to be able to put words to just how

583
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,000
little we understood and how for the most part

584
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,480
the study of human linguistics doesn't really apply to alien linguistics like

585
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,200
for instance a huge component of human linguistics is

586
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:09,040
just mouth sounds and um the way uh words are constructed or syntax so it

587
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,440
was it was less about her having a skill set that she could apply

588
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,640
so much as her being able to put words to

589
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,760
the sheer limitations of being able to apply

590
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,880
human language to this hypothetical alien language

591
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,400
i had the pleasure of experiencing your novel through the excellent audiobook

592
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,840
reading performed by stephanie willis and oliver thorn will they be reprising

593
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,760
their roles in the sequel um probably although the sequel will

594
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,920
have uh three readers i hope i think is there anything you had

595
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,240
to cut from axiom's and that will be in the sequel

596
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,600
um it's mostly world building stuff there was some stuff in earlier drafts

597
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,520
that was a reveal in the first book but i realized would be a more powerful

598
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,160
reveal in later books and then there's just some like world

599
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,120
building stuff like the conversation on gender

600
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,240
got shunted into later books so yeah i mean

601
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,680
not a whole lot it was mostly world building is there smut in book two or

602
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,240
are you going to make us wait longer yes

603
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,840
but whatever you're thinking you're probably wrong

604
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,040
since bush resigned who's the next president going to be

605
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,480
well it's dick cheney it was kind of surreal because i had to

606
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:20,640
type the words president cheney like at least a dozen times would irl kaveh get

607
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,360
along with book kaveh um yes uh but

608
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:30,640
mostly because both iterations uh kind of get along with everybody joke

609
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,800
question when is korra gonna get it in already

610
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:41,600
so let me just say of like the uh beta readers editors and agents who

611
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,120
have read the sequel um eyebrows have been raised is it

612
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,080
easier to write a sequel having established a core cast and

613
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,520
concept are the answers to narrative questions or problems more obvious

614
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:57,360
in my experience it was so much easier part of that was because i kind of came

615
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,640
up with the concept for the sequel before i came up

616
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,720
were really nailed the concept for the first one because in my mind

617
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,920
the first one is mostly set up to me um i know i know like the meet cute people

618
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,120
will always kind of like that the most but like really the

619
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,920
first one was like set up for where i wanted to go

620
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,120
the sequel has two point of view characters instead of one

621
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,560
and um i for some reason found that made it

622
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,160
so much easier like being able to hop from different points of view and also

623
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,200
just having done it before you have a much better idea of your process

624
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,040
so yeah i found the sequel so much easier to write than the first one

625
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,880
will sloop john b make an actual appearance in the future

626
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,880
yes could we expect a sequel to follow korra and ampersand or some new

627
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,920
characters both straightforward question are we

628
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,560
looking at a time skip between books if so how long

629
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,560
yes small time skip uh about three months when did you start planning

630
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,080
and writing the sequel to axiom's end again before the first book was even

631
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,880
written and i guess after the second one comes

632
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,200
out i guess i could talk about like what it was because primarily it was like it

633
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,960
was a character dynamic thing but mainly it was just this sort of

634
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,640
like broad premise idea of how does society cope

635
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:16,000
with this first contact scenario um where the world doesn't end but also

636
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,160
nobody really has any information like how does society cope with that and i

637
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,240
guess that was the thing that interested me more

638
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,160
than um anything that's really in the first book are we going to be seeing

639
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,120
more of that asshole journalist kave uh

640
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,680
i guess yeah here's the biggest spoiler of all yes

641
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:41,840
um kave is not only a major character in the second book he is also the second

642
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:46,240
point of view character and that's my big reveal and yeah and

643
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,640
so i guess for those of you who listens to my podcast

644
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,880
i guess we'll talk about that next year i did not know i was going to have a

645
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,680
podcast with a guy named kali oh you've seen cloud

646
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:00,240
alice right unfortunately oh my god do you love cloud

647
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:05,280
