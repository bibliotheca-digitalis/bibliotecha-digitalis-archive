0	4480	Good afternoon! I hope everyone is having a lovely war on Christmas.
4480	8400	If you're anything like me, you're all dressed up with nowhere to go.
8400	11840	Literally the first Christmas where I don't get to see my family
11840	20160	in all of my 36 years on this earth. Yeah, I'm fine with that.
20160	24880	This episode was brought to you by my publisher asking
24880	28640	when I'm going to do a content of promoting my book before Christmas.
28640	34080	Just under the wire. You can see it right here along with some other
34080	40480	gift ideas for the SFF fan in your life. It's only mostly
40480	44880	extremely nepotistic. I had a run-in with the oven if you're
44880	47680	wondering. So I wanted to do a Q&A for a while but
47680	50880	the thing about books is they take a lot longer to get through than
50880	53440	movies and generally when they're released it's not like everybody reads
53440	55600	it all in the same week. It's a very slow burn.
55600	58640	But it's been about five months so I figured I can
58640	63920	break this down into a no spoiler discussion or at least what I
63920	66720	consider no spoilers. Like if it's if it's in the
66720	70960	you know blurb on the jacket then it doesn't count as spoilers.
70960	74960	Spoilers section where I actually talk about the content of the book in a
74960	78720	spoilery way. Finally sequel stuff at the end and I
78720	81520	don't want to say it'll be spoilery but it would be like on the level of stuff
81520	85200	that you read like on the jacket blurb which incidentally has not been written
85200	87040	yet. So the way I did this was through
87040	91520	Twitter because that required the least amount of effort on my part.
97520	101280	What software did you use to write slash organize all the world building going on?
101280	104720	Is it a bunch of Google Docs? More specialized things with Scrivener?
104720	109360	Both. I use Google Docs for a lot of it like especially keeping track of like
109360	112560	timelines. Like there's like I guess sort of the
112560	116720	macro timeline of um you know alien civilization and when
116720	121520	we hit what milestone like becoming spacefaring becoming interstellar
121520	125760	you know becoming post-natural and then there's the micro timelines like
125760	130480	you know the human family trees and when so and so was born and what year they
130480	132560	were born and when they went to school and how they met.
132560	136400	But mainly I use Scrivener. I just have to have a really clear road map before I
136400	138960	actually do it and I use Scrivener for that and I find
138960	142720	Scrivener very good for organizing massive projects especially one
142720	147600	like this that is like a combination of epistolary novel and
147600	151600	uh regular prose novel because I have to categorize the different sections
151600	155280	especially in the sequel which has multiple points of view. In your video
155280	157680	talking about your book deal you mentioned reasons why it didn't sell in
157680	161440	it having to do with publishing trends. Would it be a spoiler for the sequel if
161440	164880	you went into those reasons now? No. But generally when we talk about
164880	167680	publishing trends publishers want something that is
167680	170880	similar to something that has already done well
170880	174880	because like Hank Green's book uh An Absolutely Remarkable Thing was like
174880	178720	the only comp we had when we had on submission. Besides his book there
178720	183120	weren't really any other you know best-selling sci-fi
183120	185360	novels that were also sort of contemporary
185360	189760	real world grounded type stuff. Publishers want to buy things that are
189760	192320	similar to things that have done well within the
192400	196880	last five years and um in terms of like commercial
196880	199360	science fiction there weren't a lot that were similar.
199360	202400	Did you deliberately set out to write basically the book Transformer should
202400	205040	have been? I mean if you're talking about the movie
205040	212560	uh maybe. I feel like so much of my adult life has
212560	216320	been shaped by frustration with Michael Bay and I
216320	220160	think like one of the things that like I kind of got obsessed with with the first
220160	223040	Transformers movie after it came out was that
223040	226960	it did kind of set up a really interesting premise which was that
226960	230400	okay aliens show up but the world doesn't end what now?
230400	234320	Especially after the second one um the the worst one
234320	237600	arguably no actually I think maybe they're all really bad but like the
237600	240960	second one ends with like the fallen being like we're here we're
240960	244320	queer we're gonna kill you but then you know the world doesn't end
244320	248960	so like what then and they kind of they kind of tiptoe up to like doing
248960	252160	something interesting with it like how in the third movie there's like
252160	256720	you know John Turturro hanging out with Transformer refugees in Cuba.
256720	261360	Buy my book! Buy my book! I think it is also very fair to say that
261360	266480	uh a lot of it was shaped by frustration with Mr. Bay's Transformers franchise.
266480	269680	When describing Korra's outfits did you try to create an iconic look
269680	274080	for a potential adaptation? Yeah sort of what I thought were the most
274080	278160	visually I don't know 50s b-movie scenes. I keep
278160	280880	describing this uh tiered chiffon maxi dress from the
280880	285040	1970s and um I don't know why I decided to go with
285040	290080	that and not something more like you know 1950s um
290080	293600	but I think it was just it was kind of like a janky
293600	298720	like a janky version of that um you know something white and flowing and damsel
298720	301920	but also like cheap and polyester in 70s. When will
301920	305040	you write an omegaverse novel? I don't think I need to someone already
305040	309680	wrote an omegaverse axioms in fanfic. It's on AO3. No I haven't read it I'm
309680	312720	not allowed. In regards to Korra's experience with linguistics in college
312720	314720	have you ever taken any linguistics courses?
314720	319120	Yes at NYU I had what they call a um concentration
319120	322800	which is what it is when you don't have enough credits for a
322800	327280	minor but you had enough where they're like
327280	331360	ah we could put that on the degree somewhere whatever. Axioms in ready read
331360	334720	very much like the natural disaster films of the 90s. How much of this was
334720	337280	intentional? I didn't really set out to do that but I guess
337280	340480	some of that was inevitable because so much of like the plot and the structure
340480	345040	and the character dynamics was very much inspired by movies like that
345040	348320	and like towards the end of the process like after the book sold and while we
348320	351200	were in revisions like I kind of allowed myself license to
351200	355120	just like go all in on it. I've seen Independence Day probably more times
355120	361440	than I've seen any other movie. Let's just own it you know and it's like
361440	364080	there's a lot of Men in Black in there um
364080	367680	there's a lot of Invader Zim in there it's sort of like which is which is
367680	370560	funny because I saw that Jonan Vasquez posted like
370560	373840	check out my book haul and that was in it and I was like oh no
373840	378000	Pathetic humans fleeing in terror at the sight of Zim!
378000	381920	Nobody even looking at you! It's a show of respect!
381920	385840	Their stupid eyes can't handle all these!
385840	389040	Because I was watching the new Invader Zim movie uh
389040	393200	Enter the Florpus and as I was watching it I was like holy shit I forgot
393200	398880	how much Invader Zim um kind of crept into like the world
398880	403600	building it's almost sort of like uh Invader Zim played straight like
403600	406400	which I'm sure Jonan Vasquez would be horrified by
406400	410240	like even even uh Kaylee Donaldson of Pajiba pointed this out
410240	413840	it's sort of like ampersand is almost like a if Invader Zim
413840	418480	was competent but where are the flames I can't rule the world without cool
418480	421920	flames shooting up behind me
430000	432720	now that it's out can you talk about what it was like watching bumblebee with
432720	437600	this in your pocket bumblebee came out right before
437600	441280	the book went on submission I loved bumblebee because it was you know
441280	444480	the Transformers movie so the only good Transformers movie but it had a lot of
444480	448160	similarities and when I was watching it with uh Lisa for the first
448160	450880	time this one um she we were in the movie
450880	453760	theater and she just kind of like whispers to me like
453760	457520	this is a lot like your book and I'm like oh it's
457520	460640	they stole my idea not the other way around but the but the really funny
460640	464640	thing was uh when we were um the first blurb
464640	467920	Saint Martin's Press sent me that was like the cover copy
467920	471520	this thing it basically like it read it read
471520	475680	like the plot of bumblebee so much that it included things that were
475680	479600	in the movie bumblebee but were not in my book
479600	483120	for instance like we are being pursued by
483120	487360	like evil John Cena it's like but no that's not the plot that's not what
487360	490320	happens oh my god if the Axiom Zen series was adapted for
490320	493280	tv would you rather see it made into live action or animated
493280	496800	I don't know it depends on who's making it if it was animated I feel like it
496800	500160	would have to be like either anime or anime style you know
500160	502960	because it should feel a little aged up but yeah I
502960	505680	don't know I think I think that really depends on who's at the helm
505680	510080	and what the budget is because I think the thing is like if it was animated
510080	513680	for the content that it is it would probably be cheaper than live action
513680	517040	because like geez I I kind of doubt we're ever going to see
517040	520640	a live action version what language slang phrase do you use often that was
520640	523040	off limits due to the period setting that you chose
523040	527840	the truth is um I was a lot more careful about that for the sequel like I have an
527840	531680	entire thread that was neologisms that I started to write but had to cut
531680	534960	and I guess they would tend to be like internet thing like
534960	540640	uh you know like we can't use doge like much alien very invasion or stuff
540640	542960	like that even though that's already dated I also
542960	546480	kind of had a problem of like sort of in the opposite direction of like language
546480	550400	that was a really common then um but is like considered super
550400	554960	problematic now like as a for instance um like I think I had a
554960	559760	uh a scene where Felix Cora's brother calls something gay
559760	564160	in like a derogatory way which you know a 13 year old in 2007
564160	567200	absolutely would have um but like you know
567200	570640	we had these conversations about like do we want to be true to the period or keep
570640	574320	in mind who's reading it now and you know defaulted to the who's reading
574320	578000	it now even though it is accurate that doesn't mean it needs to be there
578000	581280	do you think your history of doing video essays will influence more folks to make
581280	584720	video essays analyzing your work is that an exciting prospect or a
584720	589360	dreadful one I mean I guess it's not really relevant to me because I
589360	591360	wouldn't watch it I don't I don't think it's
591360	595040	fair I get that not all authors are like that but I think just from an ethical
595040	598480	standpoint I shouldn't engage with stuff like that
598480	601680	like that's not for me that's for other people to have
601680	603520	discussions that said I think it would be more
603520	608640	likely for me if only because the type of viewer I have and the type of
608640	611120	audience I have is more likely to be interested
611120	615200	in video essays how much of your theories did you have done before it
615200	618720	queried I mean I had definitely had it mapped out by the time it sold
618720	622960	and we pitched them five and they bought one and they bought two more after the
622960	625200	pre-sale numbers for the first one came in so
625200	628880	thanks for that so basically three out of five are under contract and whether I
628880	632880	get to finish it I guess is contingent on how well the first three
632880	636080	do so a question for everyone else who has
636080	639600	read the book does everyone envision Lindsay as Cora while reading this
639600	643280	and if so what is Lindsay's opinion of this that sucks honestly
643280	646480	you know this is like something that most authors don't have to deal with
646480	649520	so I guess as an author I would like to die I would
649520	655440	like for people not to be thinking of me and other things that I've done
655440	658720	while they're reading it but obviously like you know like I say death of the
658720	662800	author for the most part is not a very applicable to the real world
662960	666160	theory that's just not realistic where do we send fan letters
666160	670160	um here this is my business email super early but what's your dream cast and
670160	673680	director for an adaptation Christian Slater would make a great
673680	676800	Nels oh yeah that would be I never thought of that yeah he'd be
676800	680480	perfect the only casting that I thought was kind of a good idea was
680480	684800	Pedro Pascal as Nels but you know we probably couldn't afford him
684800	688400	what build is Cora and Oblivion dark elf
688400	692000	uh mage but also she doesn't really like Oblivion because Oblivion sucks she
692000	707520	prefers Morrowind because it's better
707520	711520	should I read Axiom's end no it depends on what you're into
711520	714400	in your how to get a book deal video you said your agent pinpointed the issue
714400	716800	with why agents thought they could not sell this
716800	719520	and you fixed and suggested that you might share one day are you ready to
719520	722880	share it now are you ready one weird trick that
722880	727200	was keeping me from getting a literary agent was
727200	733120	Cora's age in the original draft she was 19 not 21 and you might be
733120	737200	thinking oh well really what
737200	741120	so the first chapter in the final version she's at work she's a temp
741120	745280	uh and she's dropped out of college but in the first draft she was in school she
745280	747600	was like it you know in college rather than
747600	753520	at work and so that first chapter felt a little too ya curious so it's not
753520	758160	really a deal breaker for like character age in genre fiction
758160	762480	it's more just like how it's presented and so the fact that she was
762480	766560	a little she was young and the first chapter was at school
766560	769920	felt a little too ya curious and so we aged her up
769920	773040	and that was it adding two years to her age
773040	776640	what advice would you give to beginner slash novice writers
776640	779920	for one thing don't make my mistake and over revise
779920	783600	i think another is um once you get to the editorial phase
783600	788320	except that most editorial notes are suggestions they're not mandatory
788320	791840	and editors don't expect you to incorporate
791840	795360	all of them let alone even most of them depending on the notes would you agree
795360	798480	that axiom sin falls within the horse girl genre
798480	801840	yeah since the setting is irl does that mean that lindsay ellis exists in the
801840	806000	universe of the setting you know i'm gonna go with no i'm just
806000	808720	gonna keep it simple no i was never born in this universe
808720	812480	the green brothers exist though what part of axiom sins were you unsure about
812480	816320	but you found turned out really well i guess sort of the dynamic between the
816320	819600	two leads i didn't know if people would buy into it
819600	821440	and that was kind of another reason why i was so
821440	824880	squirrelly about the actual content of the book um
824880	830000	because i didn't want to market it on almost sort of like this
830000	834880	borderline romance because publishing be sexist and i
834880	838000	but you know by that same token it's not for everybody
838000	841040	like it is a hard definitely not for everybody
841040	844560	and so i think the result is that a lot of people read it based on this sort of
844560	847200	like government conspiracy thriller blurb
847200	851200	that probably would not have if they knew that the
851200	855120	main substance of the book is not that and i guess the people that
855120	859680	did like it you know responded to it in the way that i was hoping so
859680	862960	i guess that but by that same token again
863040	867440	not for everybody the physicality of the aliens feels very vivid and visceral
867440	870240	while thinking of their anatomy what kind of visual and material references
870240	872880	did you make for yourself did you settle on their general shape
872880	874880	from the start or was it a longer process
874880	878160	it was kind of both because it's like i always had an idea of the
878160	882080	general shape that was always there from the very beginning but the details
882080	885760	um changed a lot and kind of only really settled towards the end
885760	888560	with the various characters having different opinions on the truth is a
888560	892080	human right debate where on that spectrum do you fall
892080	895760	uh regrettably i think i'm probably a centrist
895760	903200	what i think is what is true matters not as much as how the truth is
903200	907120	framed because any truth can be weaponized
907120	910880	but on the whole i think like it's it's more complicated than just
910880	914560	full transparency because you know again any true thing
914560	920960	can be framed in a way that ultimately furthers a uh completely
920960	925040	unrelated political agenda are you a pantser plotter or in between
925040	930080	hard plotter um outlined a lot do you naturally write in third person
930080	932960	or was this a choice made specifically for this book
932960	936880	was first person ever considered no i don't know i think in a weird way
936880	941440	first person feels more stylistic to me than third person for some reason
941440	945600	i guess if it's if it's in in my head anyway if it's in first person i feel
945600	949040	like there needs to be a narrative reason
949040	953520	like who is this person telling this story to and why
953520	956560	and i know logically that doesn't make any sense like third person is
956560	960240	just as much of a stylistic choice but i guess if i was going to write in first
960240	964080	person i would need there to be a reason like a narrative reason of like why this
964080	966720	person is telling their story how do you think your experience in
966720	969920	screenwriting influenced the novel well i feel like it has a very
969920	975040	screenwriting style i i feel like my prose is very utilitarian
975040	978960	and you know that's just a taste thing some people like that some people don't
978960	982000	um also just like in terms of structuring it
982000	985680	i think more than anything the structure like basically like
985680	989120	um points of attack inciting incidents act breaks
989120	992880	um different sequences taking place in different things and having different
992880	997200	tensions um framing it like that was very
997200	999600	influenced by screenwriting and apparently that is
999600	1003280	becoming increasingly common what would you change about the first book
1003280	1006080	and how will you be adapting what you learned in the second book there were
1006160	1009120	times when i i kind of deferred to um
1009120	1013120	editorial um i think maybe to the book's detriment where
1013120	1016560	you know they'd ask for certain things and i'm not gonna say what they are
1016560	1018320	because then you're gonna be like oh where is it
1018320	1022160	but like i do it and then i you know in hindsight would realize like this feels
1022160	1023840	kind of forced but then i'd kind of leave it
1023840	1027600	i think the other thing is reading it too much like reading
1027600	1030640	it too many times and revising it too many times i think
1030640	1034880	that is i think that's definitely a trap first time authors
1034880	1037920	fall into whereas you know it's your first time and you want it to be perfect
1037920	1041840	but then like uh the result is you read over the same
1041840	1044560	sentences over and over and over and then they just start to lose meaning and
1044560	1047760	then you stop being able to contrast construct a sentence that
1047760	1052640	um you know is is flows well i noticed a lot of criticism
1052640	1055600	about like the writing style especially like in the first
1055600	1061440	third um and i think part of the reason it does feel kind of clunky is because
1061440	1065360	i read it too many times and i revised it too many times
1065360	1070160	and the result was that like you know the the words just stop
1070160	1073360	carrying meaning so for the sequel for the most part when i finished a draft i
1073360	1077040	would just put it away and do not look at it until it came
1077040	1080160	back from editorial with like here's what you need to do
1080160	1083280	the thing is like when you're doing revisions if you've looked at the
1083280	1086480	sentences too many times each time you look at it it becomes
1086480	1090240	harder and harder to restructure it into something that like
1090240	1099440	flows better or sounds better
1099440	1102800	what was the biggest most surprising change from your original draft book one
1102800	1105760	i guess it depends on what you consider the original draft
1105760	1109200	when i compare the trunked version to the final version
1109200	1113200	a the trunked version was like way too chicken shit about the you know primary
1113200	1115440	relationship therefore it was very sterile
1115520	1120240	and very no emotions allowed and the other biggie was where the
1120240	1123920	exposition happened and um there would be like these big
1123920	1127600	exposition dumps towards the beginning um which i you
1127600	1129840	know upon reflection i was like holy shit this
1129840	1133760	you know it works so much better if like when she meets ampersand she knows
1133760	1135920	nothing you know and so she kind of has it's a
1135920	1139360	journey of discovery rather than having all the information ahead of time
1139360	1142800	but i guess also like in in those super early drafts
1142800	1147360	what kind of ended up being the meat of the book wasn't really there at all
1147360	1150640	so like all these sort of getting to know you chapters that happen like in
1150640	1154560	the middle and in the bunker just did not exist like
1154560	1157760	even a little with regards to the ending when
1157760	1161680	ampersand goes but i'm not human i was like smiley face and then frowny face
1161680	1165040	can't decide which feeling to have how do you view it
1165040	1168320	i think that's correct that's the correct response to have
1168320	1172480	did ampersand lie about the known number of space faring species
1172480	1175840	no but absolutely take everything he says with a grain of salt he obviously
1175840	1180000	tends to omit truths if not outright lie and there are definitely some things in
1180000	1185120	the first book that he lied about stop fucking lying our amygdalins and
1185120	1189040	their super organism the great filter no ampersand was
1189040	1191440	telling the truth about that there's a lot of talk in the first book
1191440	1197120	about like the great filter and why in a sort of statistical likelihood
1197120	1200640	standpoint this other intelligent civilization
1200640	1205200	popped up relatively close to earth like only about 100 light years away which
1205200	1208640	you know in the grand scheme is like really unlikely
1208640	1212160	but no he was telling the truth about that the superorganism is not the great
1212160	1215600	filter although that will be elaborated on considerably in the sequel i remember
1215600	1219840	that ampersand said he had two sim files was that chefo and obelisk or was he not
1219840	1223680	including chefo because he's dead uh that was not
1223680	1227360	including chefo because he's dead he has two one is obelisk the other
1227360	1230480	that is a really good catch of a throwaway line because it is a
1230480	1235040	very important throwaway line and yes that will be explored considerably
1235040	1238800	what were the amygdalins evolutionary ancestors like and how do they get their
1238800	1242560	energy since they don't eat um well they do eat a little
1242560	1246080	christopher pauline's new book talks about this concept of like a
1246080	1249520	a human shit mind which is basically like a brain that is
1249520	1252880	you know kind of fed nutrients constantly
1252880	1256800	um and in this case they can kind of almost have like a star trek replicator
1256800	1260400	inside their own bodies so it's kind of like that basically like
1260720	1264400	similar or those that exist in the bodies of a similar get their energy
1264400	1267840	differently from everybody else because like you know espress and all the other
1267840	1273600	ones they don't have like these grand superpowers then that's basically
1273600	1277200	uh because they uh have a different form of energy
1277200	1280720	but it's it's kind of same ish and the simple answer is
1280720	1284960	i went with uh matter antimatter fusion and as for their ancestors
1284960	1288480	um i don't know if i'll ever really get the opportunity to go into this because
1288560	1292960	i have this whole like you know what kind of star did there's
1292960	1295600	planet well not because like in my mind it was like a moon that
1295600	1301440	ordered like a gas giant around like a um like a like a k-type star a red giant
1301440	1304560	um so the atmosphere would look very different and the greenhouse effect
1304560	1306960	would be very different the air pressure would be different
1306960	1312000	um and that's sort of being like why our sun is very like yeah you know it's just
1312000	1314880	like way brighter than they were evolved for
1314880	1317040	and that's part of why their eyes are so big
1317040	1321200	um that and that and big eyes is cute and alien
1321200	1324080	i guess it's like kind of a complicated question that i always kind of have in
1324080	1327200	the back of my mind while writing but i don't know if it'll ever actually make
1327200	1330000	it to the page because it may never be relevant to
1330000	1333040	the actual prose but the simple answer is like
1333040	1337120	you know ampersand mentions that it like the social group
1337120	1341520	being very more similar to gorillas than like monogamous humans
1341520	1344880	and their ancestors were also like strictly herbivorous which is part of
1344880	1348800	why humans are so like ah okay just like i kind of imagine like
1348800	1353280	if humans had evolved as like strict natural vegetarians and then
1353280	1356640	coming in contact with aliens that ate animals that would just
1356640	1360240	be like oh my god that's awful but i guess that's more subtext than
1360240	1363600	anything at the beginning of part four korra mentioned she can hear better
1363600	1367200	infliction even a slight accent with ampersand's voice
1367200	1371440	uh why does she hear it clearer before the bond i think that's just because
1371920	1377200	that doesn't really have anything to do with bonding that's just he improved the
1377200	1380640	the text to talk speech to sound more natural
1380640	1384480	he did not create that software that's just mac and talk and he figured out how
1384480	1388320	to like you know apply it to an earbud that he made but
1388320	1391040	really it's just over the course of the novel he improves his serie that
1391040	1395440	doesn't really have anything to do with uh any mystical et soul bonds
1395440	1398320	having gotten to the end and read the special thanks i have to ask is this
1398320	1402480	novel a low-key starscream fanfic i get that a lot and it's kind of a
1402480	1407360	weird question to me because i think on a personality level ampersand and
1407360	1413120	starscream have nothing in common i'm stupid i'm stupid
1413120	1416320	i guess they are both kind of jerks but like they're you know they're very
1416320	1419360	different characters um ampersand was not in any way
1419360	1422880	inspired by starscream i'd say obelisk was a little though there is a hidden
1422880	1425120	starscream in there i've seen one person catch it
1425120	1428160	how much of you is in korra and what other sources did you draw inspiration
1428160	1430880	from her personality i guess off the top of my head not a lot
1430880	1434400	to be honest like i guess we're roughly the same age
1434400	1438480	but her mid-2000s experience was very different from mine
1438480	1441920	and and like the way she handled things was very different from mine like she
1441920	1445120	was very unambitious her family is nothing like mine
1445120	1449040	i was extremely ambitious and like honestly
1449040	1453920	borderline entitled like i did not know how to deal with failure like i still
1453920	1456960	don't i also i also like to think i'm a lot funnier than she is
1456960	1460480	like i'm more witty than she is i guess in a weird way i think
1460480	1465040	i have more in common with ampersand and this sort of combination of being
1465040	1469920	really controlling really emotionally unavailable and borderline authoritarian
1469920	1474320	it in a weird way it's easier to pick out your similarities with an alien
1474320	1478000	character because he is representing something more
1478000	1481600	symbolic than just like a human character who has a regular
1481600	1484800	human personality and that can be a little more difficult to suss out
1484800	1488000	did you base nils off of any whistleblower in particular
1488000	1492880	yes it's julian Assange he was like i could try to be like oh you know he's
1492880	1495040	a combination nah it's julian Assange sorry
1495040	1499520	let me backpedal that a little bit his function in the world as celebrity
1499520	1501840	whistleblower is based on julian Assange his
1501840	1505440	personality is not or at least it wasn't intentional whenever i was
1505440	1509040	writing it way back in the day i like went way out of my way to
1509040	1512640	not research just on his life or i didn't want to read any interviews he'd
1512640	1516160	done i didn't want to know about him as a person because i didn't want
1516160	1519680	nils's personality to be based off of julian Assange
1519680	1522880	but inadvertently they definitely ended up having a lot in common
1522880	1527280	bless you for not killing the dogs and also for letting us know they were safe
1527280	1533440	i'll say this i will never kill a dog in a book that is the lindsey ellis
1533440	1538560	promise did you intentionally starve korra so she had to eat the whole plate
1538560	1542720	i ate the whole plate someone on twitter was like if there's no whole plate joke
1542720	1544880	in there i'm gonna be really disappointed and i just kind of was
1544880	1548800	like oh yeah that'd be funny so i just push it put it in there on a whim i
1548800	1552560	didn't really think about it and so now half of my twitter mentions are about
1552560	1558000	how you put the whole plate in there the whole plate the whole plate
1558000	1561280	what was the inspiration for ampersand's appearance would you ever consider
1561280	1564240	official art getting made i keep wanting to the inspiration is
1564240	1568080	sort of like this combination of um like just things i like to look at
1568080	1571440	things i find inherently like appealing not necessarily beautiful like
1571440	1574960	just striking i guess like i really like spiders
1574960	1579040	um i really like praying mantises we have a bunch of pet spiders and mantises
1579040	1582640	and also this sort of like hypothetical evolutionary ancestor of like
1582640	1586080	what does a bipedal herbivore look like because um
1586080	1589280	and maybe you'll have things like kangaroos or iguanodons
1589280	1593440	so i guess like structurally it's sort of a combination of like an iguanodon
1593440	1596640	and a dragon also because i just i like dragons
1596640	1599680	like if there's a dragon in a book there's a dragon in a thing
1599680	1604000	i'm here i'm here for that dragon is the is it a good dragon is it a bad dragon
1604000	1608560	is is it are we dragon shifters or are we are we riding dragons are we fighting
1608560	1612080	dragons i don't care i'm i'm i'm here for those dragons that's
1612080	1614400	part of why there's there's something a little draconian
1614400	1617760	in the way that they look not draconian dragon like
1617760	1621600	that was another word i got dinged for like no that's not what draconian means
1621600	1625120	and there was also incorporating like insectoid and arachnoid
1625120	1628480	characteristics not because they felt alien well yeah because they felt alien
1628480	1632320	but also just because i i i like them like they are appealing to
1632320	1635840	me personally but i got a mantis in my panties
1635840	1639680	okay from what i can tell korra is kind of a self-insert so in what ways is
1639680	1641920	korra different from you besides her dad of course
1641920	1645520	do male authors get this question i don't think she's a self-insert any more
1645520	1649440	than any like everyman style protagonist is i guess as
1649440	1652480	i mentioned earlier i don't really have much in common with her
1652480	1656880	personality at all like she's good with kids i am not you
1656880	1660320	know despite being an oldest her way of coping with the world is to kind of fade
1660320	1663760	into the background you know she's a she's more of a water
1663760	1667200	sign i guess she's kind of conflict averse i am very
1667200	1671920	confrontational i guess she's she's latina i'm not she's
1671920	1676160	catholic i'm not um never had any problems you know
1676160	1680080	supporting myself never had to move back in with my family
1680080	1682960	never had this sort of contentious relationship with my parents
1682960	1686640	certainly never called them by their first name
1686640	1689520	like you have everyman characters that are kind of a fish out of water because
1689520	1691920	like they need the world explained to them
1691920	1696080	some of the time and you know that is a really common thing especially in genre
1696080	1697680	fiction you know but that doesn't mean they're
1697680	1701280	self-insert it just just means that the reader needs an entry point and i guess
1701280	1705440	i kind of wonder like if if if if korra in commercial
1705440	1710000	fiction is considered a blank slate what wouldn't be how many dicks does
1710000	1712720	ampersand have
1714560	1722800	that's a complicated question um bex living in a post natural body and
1722800	1729360	being born sterile um he doesn't have any um reproductive organs but if he
1729360	1732640	did he wouldn't have a penis it would be a novapositor
1732640	1736160	but i guess the corollary to that is uh he does have some limited
1736160	1740320	shape-shifting ability obviously so i guess it depends on how
1740320	1744400	creative he wants to get he could have infinite well not
1744400	1747280	infinite but as many as you can fit did i imagine a parallel between the
1747280	1749360	hospital scene at the end of axiom's end and
1749360	1753040	the end of twilight well i mean you can make all the parallels you want
1753040	1757440	like you know and i have seen this a lot it wasn't intentional but i guess the
1757440	1762960	other thing i would say about that is uh you know convalescent scenes are pretty
1762960	1767680	common at the end of thrillers um because you know if someone gets hurt
1767680	1770800	a lot of times the denouement will take place in a hospital
1770800	1774480	um like you know even bright ends in a hospital
1774480	1780080	uh like uh the prequel to this uh futuristic violence and fancy suits
1780080	1784400	ends with a very similar convalescent scenes like very actually
1784400	1787200	similar um so i just say like yeah but i would
1787200	1790480	also argue that ending thrillers in hospitals is not at
1790480	1793120	all uncommon was it always the plan to end the first
1793120	1796080	book in the way that you did i thought the last line was fantastic and it left
1796080	1799040	a really strong impression you know that's funny because i get
1799040	1801920	really mixed reactions on the on the ending
1801920	1805680	i i was kind of surprised by that because i yes the ending was always
1805680	1810240	exactly what it was like there there was always a bondy moment at the
1810240	1814640	end of act two beginning of act three and this conversation that they have in
1814640	1818560	the convalescent stage in the hospital basically you know
1818560	1823280	where normally you know et leaves at the end of the book he decides to stay
1823280	1827360	and yes that was even from like super early first draft that was always the
1827360	1829840	ending um and i guess the thing that surprised
1829840	1832400	me is like some people really were like yes
1832400	1836000	what a great ending and some people were like wow that was so abrupt that just
1836000	1841360	ended and i was like yeah i guess i you know i was i was kind of surprised by
1841360	1845200	the people who thought it was abrupt because i in my mind i was like
1845200	1846880	it was very very set up
1850000	1856240	my friend's ex-boyfriend's roommate had a pug named monster truck and i
1856240	1857200	thought that was funny
1861040	1864800	sort of so a civilian is not going to travel
1864800	1868160	your friend or group is kind of an outlier and should not be counted
1868160	1871680	generally similars or in emperor stan's case an individual that is
1871680	1876000	stolen from basically the body of a similar are the ones that
1876000	1879280	explore because those are the bodies that are built to
1879280	1883040	withstand different planetary like gravities and air pressure and stuff
1883040	1885760	like that but being these sort of cyborg things
1885760	1889920	they don't need a lot of room they can just kind of go into stasis for you know
1889920	1893520	years and decades on end so yes they do have starships but they
1893520	1897600	kind of would more look like you know an apollo capsule like they're
1897600	1901280	really really small means that you know requires less thrust
1901280	1905440	to get up to light speed and and that is its whole own complicated thing if you
1905440	1908640	want to talk about like you know thrust and energy and getting up to
1908640	1912400	light speed and why that is impossible and why that would need so much energy
1912400	1914480	after a certain point so yeah despite the fact that their
1914480	1916400	bodies are pretty big their starships are
1916400	1920880	pretty small the majority of the mass is going to be
1920880	1924240	devoted to uh energy and energy production
1924240	1927280	the actual living spaces are really really small but the ones that are here
1927280	1930960	are not on earth they are safely away in orbit where humans cannot fuck with them
1930960	1934320	aside from ampersand who is your favorite monster boyfriend
1934320	1940960	i mean come on it's the beast he fell and i landed on my ampersand was
1940960	1943840	surprised at the speed humans had advanced in a few hundred years
1943840	1947920	was the precursor species to amygdala slower than humans in that regard
1947920	1951280	they were definitely slower they were way slower and uh
1951280	1954480	part of that is sort of like nature related
1954480	1958800	one of the sort of dynamics is uh ampersand being really surprised that
1958800	1964400	we go to space not because we have to do it to survive which is what
1964400	1969840	their ancestors did they only kind of started exploring um space as a as a
1969840	1973520	need for survival um meanwhile humans do it because it's
1973520	1976560	there you know because and that's just very like why would you
1976560	1980000	do something so dangerous if you didn't absolutely have to
1980000	1983360	and they're also kind of like naturally less competitive they're much more
1983360	1988640	risk averse you know meanwhile humans are just so dumb like
1989520	1992480	so it's not necessarily that they were less
1992480	1996080	problem-solving but like the things that make humans
1996080	1999120	the things that made our technology turbocharged like
1999120	2003200	being really competitive and being really risk-takey
2003200	2006240	um they didn't really have so that's part of why
2006240	2010880	they were a lot slower uh advancing wise why they would have
2010880	2016160	advanced over a period of like from developing writing to you know
2016160	2023120	cracking the space barrier would be like 20 30 000 years as opposed to our
2023120	2027520	six-ish five six thousand years was the genome's fake plan from the start or did
2027520	2032640	you side on it later yes uh very first draft genome died
2032640	2036160	do you have an era appropriate song for your couple ship i don't know
2036160	2040160	my instinct is like some cheesy 80s song like
2040560	2045040	this who funds nils or does he sell merch like
2045040	2048960	gay frog pills um he's not to the gay frog pills
2048960	2052960	stage of his career yet i wouldn't put it past him but right now he's funded by
2052960	2056400	donations i'm curious about the moment ampersand and korra's feelings changed i
2056400	2059760	have a solid idea for korra but less solid for ampersand
2059760	2064320	was it realizing she was also afraid of her own government yeah
2064320	2067840	actually i think yeah because i think that is like uh the most
2067840	2071760	traumatizing thing that ever happened to him was like being expelled from the
2071760	2075840	body politic you devoted your life to how do you feel about fan fiction and
2075840	2078720	fan art of your work which fan art has been most like your
2078720	2083280	vision um i feel positively about it i support it but i also feel like i
2083280	2087120	shouldn't comment on it because um you know i don't want to be like this
2087120	2091840	person is correct but you you know i think whatever you have in
2091840	2095600	your head is valid like you know your vision of the thing
2095600	2099040	that i wrote is it's not wrong although i guess my main
2099040	2102000	differentiation from in the fan art that i've seen it's like
2102000	2106480	the little i've seen of obelisk has him darker than um the rest of them like no
2106480	2109600	they're all the same color they're all kind of this silvery white thing
2109600	2114400	um and uh ampersand has a really big head
2114400	2117920	relative to like the rest of his body who are some of korra's favorite music
2117920	2121200	artists and songs um which of them would ampersand find
2121200	2125200	interesting or intriguing well to the latter half of the question
2125200	2128480	none of them they'd all kind of sound the same to him but for korra's favorites
2128480	2131600	i actually have a playlist for that and i'll link it in the description is
2131600	2135200	the similarity in concept between awoken and axioms and coincidental
2135200	2138400	did you find that your experience writing a human girl eldritch horror
2138400	2142960	romance translated well i get yeah i guess it's sort of like
2142960	2146960	awoken was the i was when you do an ironic version of a thing you kind of
2146960	2149920	want to take seriously and not just me because i think like
2149920	2153440	you know lisa's book is has similar to mine in a lot of ways
2153440	2157840	especially with its relation to awoken we had a jokey joke version of a
2157840	2160320	thing where we eventually wrote a book that
2160320	2171920	took a similar concept and took it seriously
2171920	2175440	would you like to write a meeting between korra and her dad
2175440	2178640	they will meet eventually will a member of either of the two absent
2178640	2182240	space-faring species sister species species x appear in the sequel
2182240	2186080	and will we acquire names for those species yes and yes
2186080	2189040	well they'll appear in this series let's leave it at that
2189040	2191680	will korra's linguist skills become relevant in the sequel it seems a little
2191680	2194640	odd that the protagonist is a linguist and yet she never has to do any of the
2194640	2197440	translating thanks to ampersand's auto translator
2197440	2201040	well a linguist is not a translator first of all those are two
2201040	2204480	very different things but the main reason i had her
2204480	2208320	like have a very rudimentary understanding of linguistics is i wanted
2208320	2212160	her to be able to put words to just how
2212160	2216000	little we understood and how for the most part
2216000	2220480	the study of human linguistics doesn't really apply to alien linguistics like
2220480	2223200	for instance a huge component of human linguistics is
2223200	2229040	just mouth sounds and um the way uh words are constructed or syntax so it
2229040	2233440	was it was less about her having a skill set that she could apply
2233440	2236640	so much as her being able to put words to
2236640	2239760	the sheer limitations of being able to apply
2239760	2242880	human language to this hypothetical alien language
2242880	2246400	i had the pleasure of experiencing your novel through the excellent audiobook
2246400	2249840	reading performed by stephanie willis and oliver thorn will they be reprising
2249840	2253760	their roles in the sequel um probably although the sequel will
2253760	2257920	have uh three readers i hope i think is there anything you had
2257920	2260240	to cut from axiom's and that will be in the sequel
2260240	2263600	um it's mostly world building stuff there was some stuff in earlier drafts
2263680	2267520	that was a reveal in the first book but i realized would be a more powerful
2267520	2270160	reveal in later books and then there's just some like world
2270160	2273120	building stuff like the conversation on gender
2273120	2276240	got shunted into later books so yeah i mean
2276240	2279680	not a whole lot it was mostly world building is there smut in book two or
2279680	2284240	are you going to make us wait longer yes
2284560	2287840	but whatever you're thinking you're probably wrong
2287840	2291040	since bush resigned who's the next president going to be
2291040	2294480	well it's dick cheney it was kind of surreal because i had to
2294480	2300640	type the words president cheney like at least a dozen times would irl kaveh get
2300640	2305360	along with book kaveh um yes uh but
2305360	2310640	mostly because both iterations uh kind of get along with everybody joke
2310640	2314800	question when is korra gonna get it in already
2315600	2321600	so let me just say of like the uh beta readers editors and agents who
2321600	2325120	have read the sequel um eyebrows have been raised is it
2325120	2328080	easier to write a sequel having established a core cast and
2328080	2331520	concept are the answers to narrative questions or problems more obvious
2331520	2337360	in my experience it was so much easier part of that was because i kind of came
2337360	2340640	up with the concept for the sequel before i came up
2340640	2344720	were really nailed the concept for the first one because in my mind
2344800	2349920	the first one is mostly set up to me um i know i know like the meet cute people
2349920	2353120	will always kind of like that the most but like really the
2353120	2355920	first one was like set up for where i wanted to go
2355920	2359120	the sequel has two point of view characters instead of one
2359120	2362560	and um i for some reason found that made it
2362560	2366160	so much easier like being able to hop from different points of view and also
2366160	2369200	just having done it before you have a much better idea of your process
2369200	2373040	so yeah i found the sequel so much easier to write than the first one
2373040	2376880	will sloop john b make an actual appearance in the future
2376880	2380880	yes could we expect a sequel to follow korra and ampersand or some new
2380880	2383920	characters both straightforward question are we
2383920	2386560	looking at a time skip between books if so how long
2386560	2390560	yes small time skip uh about three months when did you start planning
2390560	2394080	and writing the sequel to axiom's end again before the first book was even
2394080	2396880	written and i guess after the second one comes
2396880	2401200	out i guess i could talk about like what it was because primarily it was like it
2401200	2404960	was a character dynamic thing but mainly it was just this sort of
2404960	2408640	like broad premise idea of how does society cope
2408640	2416000	with this first contact scenario um where the world doesn't end but also
2416000	2420160	nobody really has any information like how does society cope with that and i
2420160	2422240	guess that was the thing that interested me more
2422240	2426160	than um anything that's really in the first book are we going to be seeing
2426160	2431120	more of that asshole journalist kave uh
2431120	2435680	i guess yeah here's the biggest spoiler of all yes
2435680	2441840	um kave is not only a major character in the second book he is also the second
2441840	2446240	point of view character and that's my big reveal and yeah and
2446240	2448640	so i guess for those of you who listens to my podcast
2448640	2452880	i guess we'll talk about that next year i did not know i was going to have a
2452880	2455680	podcast with a guy named kali oh you've seen cloud
2455680	2460240	alice right unfortunately oh my god do you love cloud
2460240	2465280	cloud oh my god no wow so that was a lot like that went on
2465280	2468720	long enough that the sun has completely changed
