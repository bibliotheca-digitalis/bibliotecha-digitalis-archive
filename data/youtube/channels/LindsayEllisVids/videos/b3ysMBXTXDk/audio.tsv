0	4800	Okay, so this week we are going to do something a little bit different.
4800	10800	Welcome to Loose Canon, where I go through different iterations of characters or franchises
10800	14400	that I either know a lot about or like for some reason.
14400	21200	This week we're starting with the duplicitous, shrill-voiced, eternal, second-in-command of the Decepticons...
21200	23700	Starscream.
23700	25200	I'm an adult.
25200	29200	You are either lying or you're stupid!
29200	32500	I'm stupid! I'm stupid!
32500	35200	...one of the most popular of all of the Transformers.
35200	39500	This is not to say that he is the best Transformer by any stretch.
39500	43700	That is obviously any of them but Starscream.
43700	49700	But he has remained one of the most well-known, in large part because he's one of the very few Transformers
49700	52500	that people outside of Superfans ever remember.
52500	56500	So, today we're going to talk about the many different iterations of Starscream
56500	60000	since he was first modeled and painted over 30 years ago.
60000	64500	Why should you be the Supreme God? I'm a much better choice!
64500	66800	And because there are a finite number of hours in the day,
66800	70200	I will not be discussing every depiction of Starscream ever.
70200	75800	My big blind spots are the comics and the video games and the toys, which...
75800	76600	Shut up.
76600	79300	You want to discuss those versions? Be my guest in the comments.
79300	83500	Talk about Kiss Players all you want because...
83500	85500	Oh my...
86000	93500	No, no, this retrospectively, only the cartoons and of course, my bae, Starscream.
102500	106500	Starscream's most prominent characteristic is that he is duplicitous.
106500	111200	The Decepticon who plans his escape is hardly a failure!
111200	115700	He pretends to be faithful to Megatron, but really wants to be the leader of the Decepticons.
119700	122200	He's also really bad at hiding this.
142200	144200	Like in this episode...
144200	148700	Like in this episode where the Decepticons get stuck in a time portal and decide,
148700	151200	hey, while we're here, let's take over Camelot.
151200	155700	Because it's there and finally Starscream will have something to rule over.
159700	160700	Yeah.
160700	167200	Aiming Lord Starscream to stand invincible in this primitive world.
167200	172200	So with all this in mind, Starscream was and continues to be one of the most popular Transformers.
172200	174200	Especially with the ladies.
174200	177700	This makes some sense if you consider that the ladies also love Loki.
177700	179200	I said...
181200	183200	No!
183200	187700	Now, Megatron, who is the new Decepticon leader?
187700	191200	So Starscream is like baby's first Loki.
191200	192700	If you're into that.
192700	195200	G1 Starscream is about as shallow as a puddle,
195200	201200	but one episode, Fire in the Sky, could be argued that it gave him a little bit of depth.
201200	205200	Starscream, why are you so concerned about this creature?
205200	207200	Because I knew him once.
207200	212200	Like, you know, like an inch, and that might explain the fangirl army part of it.
212200	217700	We find out that Starscream has something of a pre-war history with this guy Skyfire,
217700	220700	and he's also the only person former in the entire series
220700	223700	that he ever remotely seems to be concerned about besides himself.
223700	226700	I circled half the globe searching for him.
226700	229700	Of course, when Skyfire inevitably defects to the Autobots,
229700	232200	Starscream's like, whatever, take that,
232200	237200	and then their past and tragic-ish backstory is never spoken of again.
237200	238200	Ever.
238200	241700	But Skyfire is...is gone.
241700	243700	He won't be forgotten, Spike.
243700	246200	Yeah, thanks for digging him out, assholes.
246200	248200	And here's the wonderful thing about Starscream.
248200	251700	For those first two seasons that are burned into the Stone of Eternity,
251700	256700	he basically had the dumbest dynamic with his lord and ruler Megatron.
256700	258200	Even, you know, for an 80s cartoon.
258200	263200	Pretty much every time the nigh-indestructible Megatron gets, like, a scratch,
263200	266200	Starscream's all like, well, he's dead because I'm in charge now.
266200	269200	Megatron has fallen!
269200	272700	I, Starscream, am now your leader!
272700	275200	And then he was fired? Nope.
275200	279200	I am now the leader of all Decepticons!
279200	281700	And then they killed him? Nope.
283700	285700	You disgust me.
285700	290700	So one of the great mysteries of the ages is why Megatron even has career backstabber Starscream
290700	293200	as his second-in-command in the first place.
294200	298200	Although, if you go into this series expecting anything to make sense,
298200	300200	you're probably in the wrong place.
300200	306200	Wait a minute. Since when do ghosts tumble out of control through space?
308200	311200	So then came the movie.
311200	314200	Called Transformers, the movie.
314200	317200	Starscream finally gets to be the leader of the Decepticons
317200	321200	after Megatron gets a little, not dead, but dead enough.
321200	326200	Basically, and he gets a fabulous crown and everything, and then is immediately killed.
330200	333200	Along with basically the rest of the cast.
333200	337200	But, unlike the rest of the cast, Starscream came back.
337200	339200	A lot.
339200	345200	Starscream's ghost came back and possessed Cyclonus in an episode in season three called,
345200	347200	uh, well, Starscream's Ghost.
347200	349200	Uh, well, Starscream's Ghost.
349200	352200	We learned that he did indeed have something of the special,
352200	355200	as he's the only dead one who ever comes back.
355200	358200	And he possesses other Transformers.
358200	360200	Twice.
360200	364200	Then, ten years later, we've got Beast Wars, and he's back again!
364200	366200	In basically the same way.
366200	371200	They extended the whole ghost thing, and, oh, he's got the special too.
371200	375200	Like, he's got this mutant indestructible spark, so, you know,
375200	382200	somehow he time-travel into the future past, because Beast Wars is weird.
382200	388200	So he possesses Waspinator, yeah, for one episode,
388200	393200	and so now he's like a time-traveling mutant alien robot ghost.
395200	400200	Air Commander Starscream of the Decepticon Battle Fleet!
401200	405200	Which is weird, because the last time we see him, he's, uh...
405200	408200	I live again!
408200	412200	Uh, so he gets a new body, and the last time we see him, he's floating around.
412200	414200	Out there in space.
414200	418200	Galvatron shot him, but he's still got his body, so, you know, he's fine.
418200	420200	So the whole Beast Wars thing...
420200	422200	I don't even know.
422200	426200	Sadly, Chris Latta, who voiced the iconic original Starscream,
426200	429200	died a couple of years before the Beast Wars version came out.
429200	432200	And it's not the best Beast Wars episode by any stretch,
432200	436200	but, hey, at least it's a pretty good impression.
436200	438200	Next!
438200	441200	Why do the ladies love Starscream?
441200	446200	I've heard it's argued that it might be because of Transformers Armada.
453200	457200	This is one of the few animated series that was not made on the American side.
457200	459200	They did Born and Raised in Japan,
459200	462200	which might explain why they tried to give Starscream some depth,
462200	465200	and, you know, internal conflict, and a friend,
465200	469200	in the form of unreasonably tolerant and accepting anime girl
469200	472200	of infinite patience and trust and kindness.
472200	475200	I'm fine, you guys, but I don't think Starscream is.
475200	478200	He's an asshole. I just need to try harder.
478200	480200	Starscream is disillusioned with Megatron in this version,
480200	483200	but instead of wanting to just be the leader of all of the things,
483200	485200	he wants Megatron to die.
485200	488200	He also kind of wants friends, but he wants Megatron to die,
488200	490200	so he spends basically the whole run of the series like,
490200	493200	I don't know what I want, I don't know who I am.
493200	496200	He's basically the Jesus of this series in that he dies for everyone else,
496200	499200	which is weird, because it's Starscream.
499200	502200	So while one could argue that this version of Starscream
502200	504200	is a little more engaging than the others,
504200	507200	because he's got something of an arc over the course of the series,
507200	511200	and I feel like going down that road could have worked,
511200	513200	yeah, this is what we ended up with.
513200	515200	Leave me alone. Now leave me alone.
515200	519200	I want to be left alone now. I want to be left alone.
519200	522200	They don't understand what it's like to be a Decepticon.
522200	526200	It really doesn't help that his voice sounds like an angsty Krusty the Clown.
526200	530200	You can't possibly understand the humiliation that I've suffered.
530200	532200	Will you just leave me alone?
533200	534200	What the hell was that?
534200	537200	I don't need your sympathy. Now leave me alone.
537200	538200	Leave me alone!
546200	549200	Even the Minicons have abandoned me now.
554200	558200	Transformers Animated, or as I like to remember it, Transformers Chins.
558200	562200	You interrupted my speech!
562200	564200	You like chins, we got your chins.
565200	569200	So this was the first American animated version of Transformers since Beast Machines,
569200	573200	made to coincide with the first live-action movie. We'll get to that.
573200	577200	Unlike with Beast Wars, where they had an entirely new cast and premise,
577200	580200	this one is more of a return to basics for a younger set,
580200	585200	with basically the same, but much smaller, cast as the G1 cartoon.
585200	588200	Now let's try this again.
588200	591200	This version of Starscream was voiced by Tom Kenny,
592200	597200	who would also go on the following year to voice another beloved Transformer.
613200	616200	This show, unlike the G1 cartoon, also featured effort,
616200	620200	which right off kind of reveals the problem with writing Starscream
620200	625200	as his original little shit-heel self and maintaining any kind of internal logic to the show,
625200	627200	which this one, you know, tries to.
627200	630200	The result is that he's going to do his thing,
630200	634200	and inevitably gets booted from the Decepticons almost immediately
634200	637200	because he is the way he is, and then he spends the rest of the series
637200	641200	trying to take over from the outside.
641200	644200	It's either going to be that, or have Megatron be an idiot, and you know,
644200	646200	we can't have that, you know, he's got to be at least a little threatening.
646200	648200	He's not Gargamel.
648200	653200	This version of Starscream is also noteworthy for giving us a female version of Starscream.
653200	654200	Clone.
654200	657200	Where the clones represent, like, aspects to his personality.
670200	671200	Okay then.
671200	674200	Alright, now let's talk about the movies.
679200	685200	I'd argue that there aren't really characters in the Bay movies.
685200	690200	Really, there are events that happen around action set pieces,
690200	692200	and occasionally an actor will scream.
694200	696200	But, you know, we'll make do with what we got.
696200	701200	So, this version of Starscream looks like a pointy Dorito on roids.
702200	704200	Oh...
704200	708200	So, in the first movie, he doesn't show up until basically the third act,
708200	711200	and one must presume he's been off-screen chillin' somewhere.
711200	715200	So, when I found out that they cast voice actor Charlie Adler as Starscream,
715200	718200	I was like, hey, I know that guy. He's perfect.
718200	723200	You might know him as Ickis, or the Big Heads, if you're my age,
723200	725200	as well as a zillion other things.
725200	729200	So, I was kind of surprised that this was what we ended up with in the first movie.
732200	734200	Where is the cube?
734200	736200	The humans have taken it.
736200	739200	He only had, like, one line that ended up sounding really generic,
739200	743200	and I'm guessing he had to sound like a toy-selling badass.
743200	744200	One line.
744200	746200	The humans have taken it.
746200	748200	And then Megatron's like...
748200	751200	You fail me yet again, Starscream.
751200	754200	See, I guess that's supposed to be like a little fan moment,
754200	756200	like wink-wink, nudge-nudge.
756200	759200	You have failed again, Starscream.
759200	761200	It's like, what?
761200	763200	Who is this guy? Why did he fail you?
763200	765200	Because of the thing he got away?
765200	767200	I mean, he just showed up. He just showed up.
767200	769200	We don't know who he is.
769200	772200	They don't even mention that he's Megatron's second-in-command in the movies,
772200	776200	or that he's been in charge these last, oh, however many thousand years,
776200	778200	they said it was.
778200	780200	So impressive.
780200	784200	In fairness to Mr. Adler's voice work, it got better.
784200	788200	By which I mean, he was allowed to be more interesting in the next two movies.
788200	792200	Megatron, I was so relieved to hear of your resurrection.
792200	797200	Which is one of the very few things you can say was an improvement on the first one.
797200	800200	Someone had to take command.
801200	804200	He also gets a little more screen time, which I presume is why.
804200	811200	But the movies kind of quietly omit the whole Starscream trying to supplant Megatron thing.
811200	814200	They did maintain that sadomasochistic dynamic,
814200	818200	but at no point does Starscream ever try to take over the Decepticons.
818200	821200	So the result is just that Megatron's kind of an asshole.
821200	823200	I can't even rely on you.
823200	825200	What a simple insect.
827200	830200	Again, like every other character in these movies.
830200	832200	No, Optimus!
833200	838200	So with Starscream barely in all three movies, and when he is, he's just kind of there.
838200	842200	My master, such a brilliant scheme.
842200	845200	Basically, at no point is he interesting or memorable.
845200	848200	If you don't know Transformers, you'll be bored and confused.
848200	851200	And if you do know who he is, you'll be disappointed.
851200	853200	So I don't know who this is for.
855200	858200	At some rare points, they'll play him like he's this badass.
858200	863200	But in the end, he gets taken out by actual cannibal Shia LaBeouf.
869200	871200	And that's all she wrote.
871200	872200	Next.
875200	879200	All hail Starscream.
879200	882200	Aw, hell mother whining, yes.
882200	886200	This Starscream is fabulous!
888200	891200	He's also the best one.
891200	894200	See, G1 Starscream is always going to be my favorite,
894200	898200	because the silliness of him just fills me with such a glee, you know, and also nostalgia.
898200	899200	Hello.
899200	903200	I've had enough of this chivalrous nonsense!
903200	906200	Transformers Prime's Starscream is just the best package.
906200	910200	He's the best written, the most engaging, the best designed, best acted,
910200	914200	most watchable, most fabulous A-plus Starscream.
914200	917200	And it only took us 20-some tries to get to this point.
917200	920200	But once I finally hunkered down and watched it,
920200	925200	this series honestly, in my opinion, rivals Beast Wars in terms of just being the best one.
925200	928200	But I always had a hard time with Beast Wars anyway for a number of reasons.
928200	931200	Although Beast Wars does win on one count.
931200	933200	No annoying kids.
933200	935200	That's a discussion for another day.
935200	937200	We're supposed to be at a rock concert.
937200	939200	Do you know how long I've waited to see Slash Monkey?
939200	940200	Uh...
940200	941200	Forever!
941200	945200	So Transformers Animated shows us the problem with having a character like Starscream
945200	948200	in a show with a storyline that goes for any number of episodes
948200	950200	and actually changes from week to week.
950200	953200	Unless Megatron's a moron or the show doesn't make any sense,
953200	956200	he's going to get booted and spend the rest of the series in a subplot.
956200	960200	And the Megatron in this show is a stone-cold badass.
960200	962200	Despite your treachery,
962200	966200	I've allowed you to carry on this long because I took a certain delight
966200	969200	in following your string of failures.
969200	971200	But you finally become tiresome.
971200	975200	And somehow they manage to more or less stay on the same team for
975200	977200	almost a whole season
977200	980200	before he inevitably gets booted.
980200	982200	Starscream.
983200	986200	Aligned with no side.
986200	989200	Then he spends a good chunk of the series in a subplot
989200	992200	before eventually rejoining with the Decepticons.
992200	995200	He's probably the most competent version of Starscream to date,
995200	998200	finally striking a balance of cowardly and kind of badass,
998200	1002200	and plus he has those fabulous heels.
1002200	1003200	You go, girl.
1003200	1007200	So while I do think it's kind of a stretch to consider the concept fresh at this point,
1008200	1012200	at least they efforted enough to the point where it was actually a pretty good show
1012200	1015200	and a pretty good interpretation of the characters.
1015200	1017200	And for the based on toys thing,
1017200	1021200	which a lot of kids shows are now,
1023200	1025200	I guess that's as good as you can hope for.
1027200	1030200	See, there's this idea that the toys really are carte blanche
1030200	1032200	and the characters don't matter at all,
1032200	1034200	which I agree with on some level,
1034200	1035200	but not entirely.
1035200	1037200	Not with this franchise.
1037200	1042200	Otherwise we wouldn't keep seeing the same story over and over.
1042200	1045200	Is the story of the Autobots versus the Decepticons
1045200	1047200	with basically the same characters each time
1047200	1051200	worthy of telling over and over again?
1051200	1053200	Probably not.
1053200	1055200	But that's what we got,
1055200	1060200	and it's all rooted in a deeply, deeply silly 30-year-old cartoon.
1060200	1063200	Nobody touches back on me!
1064200	1066200	When you watch the original Transformers cartoon
1066200	1068200	in all of its bizarre, cracked-out glory,
1068200	1074200	there is a subtle cleverness to the way that it might have resonated with really young kids,
1074200	1077200	more than other similar series that came later,
1077200	1079200	is the fact that the Transformers' interactions with each other
1079200	1081200	so mirror that of little children.
1081200	1083200	No, I'm the leader!
1083200	1084200	No, me!
1084200	1087200	And then no real consequences ever.
1087200	1089200	As an adult, that's pretty dumb.
1089200	1091200	But as a kid, it resonates.
1091200	1094200	So when it gets adapted into different media,
1094200	1096200	be it more adult...
1099200	1101200	or just more sophisticated,
1101200	1102200	it's almost like a challenge.
1102200	1105200	How can you take an admittedly pretty limited character
1105200	1109200	and rehash it over and over and yet make it still work?
1109200	1112200	Especially if you're trying to go for a more sophisticated audience,
1112200	1114200	which kids are nowadays.
1114200	1116200	Sorry, Gin Wires and Millennials.
1116200	1120200	So what is the continued appeal of Starscream?
1120200	1123200	The key word here, I would argue, is motivation.
1123200	1126200	And this is an integral aspect for any compelling character.
1126200	1131200	Walter White, Tony Soprano, Mystique, Loki...
1131200	1133200	Whether they're good guys or bad guys,
1133200	1135200	they're deeply motivated, therefore compelling,
1135200	1137200	therefore you kinda like them.
1137200	1140200	You were made to be ruled.
1140200	1144200	I give the orders now, and this is my castle.
1145200	1148200	Your character can have the most convoluted, deep, meaningful,
1148200	1152200	intricate backstory of all of the characters that have ever existed,
1152200	1154200	but if they don't want something,
1154200	1158200	in a narrative that makes them a bit tougher to grasp onto and identify with.
1158200	1162200	So next to pretty much every other character on the show,
1162200	1165200	not only does Starscream show the clearest and most consistent character motivation,
1165200	1168200	but also the most well-defined personality.
1168200	1171200	Therefore, as a character, Starscream is probably the most memorable,
1171200	1176200	and adults tend to conflate remembering something with liking something.
1176200	1180200	You'll regret that you did not destroy me, Megatron!
1180200	1184200	I shall have my revenge!
1184200	1186200	Baby's first Loki.
1194200	1197200	I'm stupid! I'm stupid!
