00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
Okay, so this week we are going to do something a little bit different.

00:04.800 --> 00:10.800
Welcome to Loose Canon, where I go through different iterations of characters or franchises

00:10.800 --> 00:14.400
that I either know a lot about or like for some reason.

00:14.400 --> 00:21.200
This week we're starting with the duplicitous, shrill-voiced, eternal, second-in-command of the Decepticons...

00:21.200 --> 00:23.700
Starscream.

00:23.700 --> 00:25.200
I'm an adult.

00:25.200 --> 00:29.200
You are either lying or you're stupid!

00:29.200 --> 00:32.500
I'm stupid! I'm stupid!

00:32.500 --> 00:35.200
...one of the most popular of all of the Transformers.

00:35.200 --> 00:39.500
This is not to say that he is the best Transformer by any stretch.

00:39.500 --> 00:43.700
That is obviously any of them but Starscream.

00:43.700 --> 00:49.700
But he has remained one of the most well-known, in large part because he's one of the very few Transformers

00:49.700 --> 00:52.500
that people outside of Superfans ever remember.

00:52.500 --> 00:56.500
So, today we're going to talk about the many different iterations of Starscream

00:56.500 --> 01:00.000
since he was first modeled and painted over 30 years ago.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.500
Why should you be the Supreme God? I'm a much better choice!

01:04.500 --> 01:06.800
And because there are a finite number of hours in the day,

01:06.800 --> 01:10.200
I will not be discussing every depiction of Starscream ever.

01:10.200 --> 01:15.800
My big blind spots are the comics and the video games and the toys, which...

01:15.800 --> 01:16.600
Shut up.

01:16.600 --> 01:19.300
You want to discuss those versions? Be my guest in the comments.

01:19.300 --> 01:23.500
Talk about Kiss Players all you want because...

01:23.500 --> 01:25.500
Oh my...

01:26.000 --> 01:33.500
No, no, this retrospectively, only the cartoons and of course, my bae, Starscream.

01:42.500 --> 01:46.500
Starscream's most prominent characteristic is that he is duplicitous.

01:46.500 --> 01:51.200
The Decepticon who plans his escape is hardly a failure!

01:51.200 --> 01:55.700
He pretends to be faithful to Megatron, but really wants to be the leader of the Decepticons.

01:59.700 --> 02:02.200
He's also really bad at hiding this.

02:22.200 --> 02:24.200
Like in this episode...

02:24.200 --> 02:28.700
Like in this episode where the Decepticons get stuck in a time portal and decide,

02:28.700 --> 02:31.200
hey, while we're here, let's take over Camelot.

02:31.200 --> 02:35.700
Because it's there and finally Starscream will have something to rule over.

02:39.700 --> 02:40.700
Yeah.

02:40.700 --> 02:47.200
Aiming Lord Starscream to stand invincible in this primitive world.

02:47.200 --> 02:52.200
So with all this in mind, Starscream was and continues to be one of the most popular Transformers.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.200
Especially with the ladies.

02:54.200 --> 02:57.700
This makes some sense if you consider that the ladies also love Loki.

02:57.700 --> 02:59.200
I said...

03:01.200 --> 03:03.200
No!

03:03.200 --> 03:07.700
Now, Megatron, who is the new Decepticon leader?

03:07.700 --> 03:11.200
So Starscream is like baby's first Loki.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.700
If you're into that.

03:12.700 --> 03:15.200
G1 Starscream is about as shallow as a puddle,

03:15.200 --> 03:21.200
but one episode, Fire in the Sky, could be argued that it gave him a little bit of depth.

03:21.200 --> 03:25.200
Starscream, why are you so concerned about this creature?

03:25.200 --> 03:27.200
Because I knew him once.

03:27.200 --> 03:32.200
Like, you know, like an inch, and that might explain the fangirl army part of it.

03:32.200 --> 03:37.700
We find out that Starscream has something of a pre-war history with this guy Skyfire,

03:37.700 --> 03:40.700
and he's also the only person former in the entire series

03:40.700 --> 03:43.700
that he ever remotely seems to be concerned about besides himself.

03:43.700 --> 03:46.700
I circled half the globe searching for him.

03:46.700 --> 03:49.700
Of course, when Skyfire inevitably defects to the Autobots,

03:49.700 --> 03:52.200
Starscream's like, whatever, take that,

03:52.200 --> 03:57.200
and then their past and tragic-ish backstory is never spoken of again.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.200
Ever.

03:58.200 --> 04:01.700
But Skyfire is...is gone.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.700
He won't be forgotten, Spike.

04:03.700 --> 04:06.200
Yeah, thanks for digging him out, assholes.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.200
And here's the wonderful thing about Starscream.

04:08.200 --> 04:11.700
For those first two seasons that are burned into the Stone of Eternity,

04:11.700 --> 04:16.700
he basically had the dumbest dynamic with his lord and ruler Megatron.

04:16.700 --> 04:18.200
Even, you know, for an 80s cartoon.

04:18.200 --> 04:23.200
Pretty much every time the nigh-indestructible Megatron gets, like, a scratch,

04:23.200 --> 04:26.200
Starscream's all like, well, he's dead because I'm in charge now.

04:26.200 --> 04:29.200
Megatron has fallen!

04:29.200 --> 04:32.700
I, Starscream, am now your leader!

04:32.700 --> 04:35.200
And then he was fired? Nope.

04:35.200 --> 04:39.200
I am now the leader of all Decepticons!

04:39.200 --> 04:41.700
And then they killed him? Nope.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.700
You disgust me.

04:45.700 --> 04:50.700
So one of the great mysteries of the ages is why Megatron even has career backstabber Starscream

04:50.700 --> 04:53.200
as his second-in-command in the first place.

04:54.200 --> 04:58.200
Although, if you go into this series expecting anything to make sense,

04:58.200 --> 05:00.200
you're probably in the wrong place.

05:00.200 --> 05:06.200
Wait a minute. Since when do ghosts tumble out of control through space?

05:08.200 --> 05:11.200
So then came the movie.

05:11.200 --> 05:14.200
Called Transformers, the movie.

05:14.200 --> 05:17.200
Starscream finally gets to be the leader of the Decepticons

05:17.200 --> 05:21.200
after Megatron gets a little, not dead, but dead enough.

05:21.200 --> 05:26.200
Basically, and he gets a fabulous crown and everything, and then is immediately killed.

05:30.200 --> 05:33.200
Along with basically the rest of the cast.

05:33.200 --> 05:37.200
But, unlike the rest of the cast, Starscream came back.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.200
A lot.

05:39.200 --> 05:45.200
Starscream's ghost came back and possessed Cyclonus in an episode in season three called,

05:45.200 --> 05:47.200
uh, well, Starscream's Ghost.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.200
Uh, well, Starscream's Ghost.

05:49.200 --> 05:52.200
We learned that he did indeed have something of the special,

05:52.200 --> 05:55.200
as he's the only dead one who ever comes back.

05:55.200 --> 05:58.200
And he possesses other Transformers.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.200
Twice.

06:00.200 --> 06:04.200
Then, ten years later, we've got Beast Wars, and he's back again!

06:04.200 --> 06:06.200
In basically the same way.

06:06.200 --> 06:11.200
They extended the whole ghost thing, and, oh, he's got the special too.

06:11.200 --> 06:15.200
Like, he's got this mutant indestructible spark, so, you know,

06:15.200 --> 06:22.200
somehow he time-travel into the future past, because Beast Wars is weird.

06:22.200 --> 06:28.200
So he possesses Waspinator, yeah, for one episode,

06:28.200 --> 06:33.200
and so now he's like a time-traveling mutant alien robot ghost.

06:35.200 --> 06:40.200
Air Commander Starscream of the Decepticon Battle Fleet!

06:41.200 --> 06:45.200
Which is weird, because the last time we see him, he's, uh...

06:45.200 --> 06:48.200
I live again!

06:48.200 --> 06:52.200
Uh, so he gets a new body, and the last time we see him, he's floating around.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.200
Out there in space.

06:54.200 --> 06:58.200
Galvatron shot him, but he's still got his body, so, you know, he's fine.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.200
So the whole Beast Wars thing...

07:00.200 --> 07:02.200
I don't even know.

07:02.200 --> 07:06.200
Sadly, Chris Latta, who voiced the iconic original Starscream,

07:06.200 --> 07:09.200
died a couple of years before the Beast Wars version came out.

07:09.200 --> 07:12.200
And it's not the best Beast Wars episode by any stretch,

07:12.200 --> 07:16.200
but, hey, at least it's a pretty good impression.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.200
Next!

07:18.200 --> 07:21.200
Why do the ladies love Starscream?

07:21.200 --> 07:26.200
I've heard it's argued that it might be because of Transformers Armada.

07:33.200 --> 07:37.200
This is one of the few animated series that was not made on the American side.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.200
They did Born and Raised in Japan,

07:39.200 --> 07:42.200
which might explain why they tried to give Starscream some depth,

07:42.200 --> 07:45.200
and, you know, internal conflict, and a friend,

07:45.200 --> 07:49.200
in the form of unreasonably tolerant and accepting anime girl

07:49.200 --> 07:52.200
of infinite patience and trust and kindness.

07:52.200 --> 07:55.200
I'm fine, you guys, but I don't think Starscream is.

07:55.200 --> 07:58.200
He's an asshole. I just need to try harder.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.200
Starscream is disillusioned with Megatron in this version,

08:00.200 --> 08:03.200
but instead of wanting to just be the leader of all of the things,

08:03.200 --> 08:05.200
he wants Megatron to die.

08:05.200 --> 08:08.200
He also kind of wants friends, but he wants Megatron to die,

08:08.200 --> 08:10.200
so he spends basically the whole run of the series like,

08:10.200 --> 08:13.200
I don't know what I want, I don't know who I am.

08:13.200 --> 08:16.200
He's basically the Jesus of this series in that he dies for everyone else,

08:16.200 --> 08:19.200
which is weird, because it's Starscream.

08:19.200 --> 08:22.200
So while one could argue that this version of Starscream

08:22.200 --> 08:24.200
is a little more engaging than the others,

08:24.200 --> 08:27.200
because he's got something of an arc over the course of the series,

08:27.200 --> 08:31.200
and I feel like going down that road could have worked,

08:31.200 --> 08:33.200
yeah, this is what we ended up with.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.200
Leave me alone. Now leave me alone.

08:35.200 --> 08:39.200
I want to be left alone now. I want to be left alone.

08:39.200 --> 08:42.200
They don't understand what it's like to be a Decepticon.

08:42.200 --> 08:46.200
It really doesn't help that his voice sounds like an angsty Krusty the Clown.

08:46.200 --> 08:50.200
You can't possibly understand the humiliation that I've suffered.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.200
Will you just leave me alone?

08:53.200 --> 08:54.200
What the hell was that?

08:54.200 --> 08:57.200
I don't need your sympathy. Now leave me alone.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.200
Leave me alone!

09:06.200 --> 09:09.200
Even the Minicons have abandoned me now.

09:14.200 --> 09:18.200
Transformers Animated, or as I like to remember it, Transformers Chins.

09:18.200 --> 09:22.200
You interrupted my speech!

09:22.200 --> 09:24.200
You like chins, we got your chins.

09:25.200 --> 09:29.200
So this was the first American animated version of Transformers since Beast Machines,

09:29.200 --> 09:33.200
made to coincide with the first live-action movie. We'll get to that.

09:33.200 --> 09:37.200
Unlike with Beast Wars, where they had an entirely new cast and premise,

09:37.200 --> 09:40.200
this one is more of a return to basics for a younger set,

09:40.200 --> 09:45.200
with basically the same, but much smaller, cast as the G1 cartoon.

09:45.200 --> 09:48.200
Now let's try this again.

09:48.200 --> 09:51.200
This version of Starscream was voiced by Tom Kenny,

09:52.200 --> 09:57.200
who would also go on the following year to voice another beloved Transformer.

10:13.200 --> 10:16.200
This show, unlike the G1 cartoon, also featured effort,

10:16.200 --> 10:20.200
which right off kind of reveals the problem with writing Starscream

10:20.200 --> 10:25.200
as his original little shit-heel self and maintaining any kind of internal logic to the show,

10:25.200 --> 10:27.200
which this one, you know, tries to.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.200
The result is that he's going to do his thing,

10:30.200 --> 10:34.200
and inevitably gets booted from the Decepticons almost immediately

10:34.200 --> 10:37.200
because he is the way he is, and then he spends the rest of the series

10:37.200 --> 10:41.200
trying to take over from the outside.

10:41.200 --> 10:44.200
It's either going to be that, or have Megatron be an idiot, and you know,

10:44.200 --> 10:46.200
we can't have that, you know, he's got to be at least a little threatening.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.200
He's not Gargamel.

10:48.200 --> 10:53.200
This version of Starscream is also noteworthy for giving us a female version of Starscream.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.200
Clone.

10:54.200 --> 10:57.200
Where the clones represent, like, aspects to his personality.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.200
Okay then.

11:11.200 --> 11:14.200
Alright, now let's talk about the movies.

11:19.200 --> 11:25.200
I'd argue that there aren't really characters in the Bay movies.

11:25.200 --> 11:30.200
Really, there are events that happen around action set pieces,

11:30.200 --> 11:32.200
and occasionally an actor will scream.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.200
But, you know, we'll make do with what we got.

11:36.200 --> 11:41.200
So, this version of Starscream looks like a pointy Dorito on roids.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.200
Oh...

11:44.200 --> 11:48.200
So, in the first movie, he doesn't show up until basically the third act,

11:48.200 --> 11:51.200
and one must presume he's been off-screen chillin' somewhere.

11:51.200 --> 11:55.200
So, when I found out that they cast voice actor Charlie Adler as Starscream,

11:55.200 --> 11:58.200
I was like, hey, I know that guy. He's perfect.

11:58.200 --> 12:03.200
You might know him as Ickis, or the Big Heads, if you're my age,

12:03.200 --> 12:05.200
as well as a zillion other things.

12:05.200 --> 12:09.200
So, I was kind of surprised that this was what we ended up with in the first movie.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.200
Where is the cube?

12:14.200 --> 12:16.200
The humans have taken it.

12:16.200 --> 12:19.200
He only had, like, one line that ended up sounding really generic,

12:19.200 --> 12:23.200
and I'm guessing he had to sound like a toy-selling badass.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.200
One line.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.200
The humans have taken it.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.200
And then Megatron's like...

12:28.200 --> 12:31.200
You fail me yet again, Starscream.

12:31.200 --> 12:34.200
See, I guess that's supposed to be like a little fan moment,

12:34.200 --> 12:36.200
like wink-wink, nudge-nudge.

12:36.200 --> 12:39.200
You have failed again, Starscream.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.200
It's like, what?

12:41.200 --> 12:43.200
Who is this guy? Why did he fail you?

12:43.200 --> 12:45.200
Because of the thing he got away?

12:45.200 --> 12:47.200
I mean, he just showed up. He just showed up.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.200
We don't know who he is.

12:49.200 --> 12:52.200
They don't even mention that he's Megatron's second-in-command in the movies,

12:52.200 --> 12:56.200
or that he's been in charge these last, oh, however many thousand years,

12:56.200 --> 12:58.200
they said it was.

12:58.200 --> 13:00.200
So impressive.

13:00.200 --> 13:04.200
In fairness to Mr. Adler's voice work, it got better.

13:04.200 --> 13:08.200
By which I mean, he was allowed to be more interesting in the next two movies.

13:08.200 --> 13:12.200
Megatron, I was so relieved to hear of your resurrection.

13:12.200 --> 13:17.200
Which is one of the very few things you can say was an improvement on the first one.

13:17.200 --> 13:20.200
Someone had to take command.

13:21.200 --> 13:24.200
He also gets a little more screen time, which I presume is why.

13:24.200 --> 13:31.200
But the movies kind of quietly omit the whole Starscream trying to supplant Megatron thing.

13:31.200 --> 13:34.200
They did maintain that sadomasochistic dynamic,

13:34.200 --> 13:38.200
but at no point does Starscream ever try to take over the Decepticons.

13:38.200 --> 13:41.200
So the result is just that Megatron's kind of an asshole.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.200
I can't even rely on you.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.200
What a simple insect.

13:47.200 --> 13:50.200
Again, like every other character in these movies.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.200
No, Optimus!

13:53.200 --> 13:58.200
So with Starscream barely in all three movies, and when he is, he's just kind of there.

13:58.200 --> 14:02.200
My master, such a brilliant scheme.

14:02.200 --> 14:05.200
Basically, at no point is he interesting or memorable.

14:05.200 --> 14:08.200
If you don't know Transformers, you'll be bored and confused.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.200
And if you do know who he is, you'll be disappointed.

14:11.200 --> 14:13.200
So I don't know who this is for.

14:15.200 --> 14:18.200
At some rare points, they'll play him like he's this badass.

14:18.200 --> 14:23.200
But in the end, he gets taken out by actual cannibal Shia LaBeouf.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.200
And that's all she wrote.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.200
Next.

14:35.200 --> 14:39.200
All hail Starscream.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.200
Aw, hell mother whining, yes.

14:42.200 --> 14:46.200
This Starscream is fabulous!

14:48.200 --> 14:51.200
He's also the best one.

14:51.200 --> 14:54.200
See, G1 Starscream is always going to be my favorite,

14:54.200 --> 14:58.200
because the silliness of him just fills me with such a glee, you know, and also nostalgia.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.200
Hello.

14:59.200 --> 15:03.200
I've had enough of this chivalrous nonsense!

15:03.200 --> 15:06.200
Transformers Prime's Starscream is just the best package.

15:06.200 --> 15:10.200
He's the best written, the most engaging, the best designed, best acted,

15:10.200 --> 15:14.200
most watchable, most fabulous A-plus Starscream.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.200
And it only took us 20-some tries to get to this point.

15:17.200 --> 15:20.200
But once I finally hunkered down and watched it,

15:20.200 --> 15:25.200
this series honestly, in my opinion, rivals Beast Wars in terms of just being the best one.

15:25.200 --> 15:28.200
But I always had a hard time with Beast Wars anyway for a number of reasons.

15:28.200 --> 15:31.200
Although Beast Wars does win on one count.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.200
No annoying kids.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.200
That's a discussion for another day.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.200
We're supposed to be at a rock concert.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.200
Do you know how long I've waited to see Slash Monkey?

15:39.200 --> 15:40.200
Uh...

15:40.200 --> 15:41.200
Forever!

15:41.200 --> 15:45.200
So Transformers Animated shows us the problem with having a character like Starscream

15:45.200 --> 15:48.200
in a show with a storyline that goes for any number of episodes

15:48.200 --> 15:50.200
and actually changes from week to week.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.200
Unless Megatron's a moron or the show doesn't make any sense,

15:53.200 --> 15:56.200
he's going to get booted and spend the rest of the series in a subplot.

15:56.200 --> 16:00.200
And the Megatron in this show is a stone-cold badass.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.200
Despite your treachery,

16:02.200 --> 16:06.200
I've allowed you to carry on this long because I took a certain delight

16:06.200 --> 16:09.200
in following your string of failures.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.200
But you finally become tiresome.

16:11.200 --> 16:15.200
And somehow they manage to more or less stay on the same team for

16:15.200 --> 16:17.200
almost a whole season

16:17.200 --> 16:20.200
before he inevitably gets booted.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.200
Starscream.

16:23.200 --> 16:26.200
Aligned with no side.

16:26.200 --> 16:29.200
Then he spends a good chunk of the series in a subplot

16:29.200 --> 16:32.200
before eventually rejoining with the Decepticons.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.200
He's probably the most competent version of Starscream to date,

16:35.200 --> 16:38.200
finally striking a balance of cowardly and kind of badass,

16:38.200 --> 16:42.200
and plus he has those fabulous heels.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.200
You go, girl.

16:43.200 --> 16:47.200
So while I do think it's kind of a stretch to consider the concept fresh at this point,

16:48.200 --> 16:52.200
at least they efforted enough to the point where it was actually a pretty good show

16:52.200 --> 16:55.200
and a pretty good interpretation of the characters.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.200
And for the based on toys thing,

16:57.200 --> 17:01.200
which a lot of kids shows are now,

17:03.200 --> 17:05.200
I guess that's as good as you can hope for.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.200
See, there's this idea that the toys really are carte blanche

17:10.200 --> 17:12.200
and the characters don't matter at all,

17:12.200 --> 17:14.200
which I agree with on some level,

17:14.200 --> 17:15.200
but not entirely.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.200
Not with this franchise.

17:17.200 --> 17:22.200
Otherwise we wouldn't keep seeing the same story over and over.

17:22.200 --> 17:25.200
Is the story of the Autobots versus the Decepticons

17:25.200 --> 17:27.200
with basically the same characters each time

17:27.200 --> 17:31.200
worthy of telling over and over again?

17:31.200 --> 17:33.200
Probably not.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.200
But that's what we got,

17:35.200 --> 17:40.200
and it's all rooted in a deeply, deeply silly 30-year-old cartoon.

17:40.200 --> 17:43.200
Nobody touches back on me!

17:44.200 --> 17:46.200
When you watch the original Transformers cartoon

17:46.200 --> 17:48.200
in all of its bizarre, cracked-out glory,

17:48.200 --> 17:54.200
there is a subtle cleverness to the way that it might have resonated with really young kids,

17:54.200 --> 17:57.200
more than other similar series that came later,

17:57.200 --> 17:59.200
is the fact that the Transformers' interactions with each other

17:59.200 --> 18:01.200
so mirror that of little children.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.200
No, I'm the leader!

18:03.200 --> 18:04.200
No, me!

18:04.200 --> 18:07.200
And then no real consequences ever.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.200
As an adult, that's pretty dumb.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.200
But as a kid, it resonates.

18:11.200 --> 18:14.200
So when it gets adapted into different media,

18:14.200 --> 18:16.200
be it more adult...

18:19.200 --> 18:21.200
or just more sophisticated,

18:21.200 --> 18:22.200
it's almost like a challenge.

18:22.200 --> 18:25.200
How can you take an admittedly pretty limited character

18:25.200 --> 18:29.200
and rehash it over and over and yet make it still work?

18:29.200 --> 18:32.200
Especially if you're trying to go for a more sophisticated audience,

18:32.200 --> 18:34.200
which kids are nowadays.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.200
Sorry, Gin Wires and Millennials.

18:36.200 --> 18:40.200
So what is the continued appeal of Starscream?

18:40.200 --> 18:43.200
The key word here, I would argue, is motivation.

18:43.200 --> 18:46.200
And this is an integral aspect for any compelling character.

18:46.200 --> 18:51.200
Walter White, Tony Soprano, Mystique, Loki...

18:51.200 --> 18:53.200
Whether they're good guys or bad guys,

18:53.200 --> 18:55.200
they're deeply motivated, therefore compelling,

18:55.200 --> 18:57.200
therefore you kinda like them.

18:57.200 --> 19:00.200
You were made to be ruled.

19:00.200 --> 19:04.200
I give the orders now, and this is my castle.

19:05.200 --> 19:08.200
Your character can have the most convoluted, deep, meaningful,

19:08.200 --> 19:12.200
intricate backstory of all of the characters that have ever existed,

19:12.200 --> 19:14.200
but if they don't want something,

19:14.200 --> 19:18.200
in a narrative that makes them a bit tougher to grasp onto and identify with.

19:18.200 --> 19:22.200
So next to pretty much every other character on the show,

19:22.200 --> 19:25.200
not only does Starscream show the clearest and most consistent character motivation,

19:25.200 --> 19:28.200
but also the most well-defined personality.

19:28.200 --> 19:31.200
Therefore, as a character, Starscream is probably the most memorable,

19:31.200 --> 19:36.200
and adults tend to conflate remembering something with liking something.

19:36.200 --> 19:40.200
You'll regret that you did not destroy me, Megatron!

19:40.200 --> 19:44.200
I shall have my revenge!

19:44.200 --> 19:46.200
Baby's first Loki.

19:54.200 --> 19:57.200
I'm stupid! I'm stupid!
